Preface.
lo 'picture Queensland as it is, to trace its history, to describe the source of its wealth and its future
great expansion, and to give a fairly comprehensive account of the men who laid the foundations, as
well as those who are rearing the superstructure, represents a large and responsible undertaking. Its
magnitude is not to be measured by the fact that the population of Queensland is still under three-quarters
of a million, but rather by the great extent of the territory, the variety of the resources, and the remarkably
successful and active way in which a comparatively handful of people have blazed the track for the millions
of the future. Considered in that way, the study of the past and the present of Queensland is a fascinating
chapter in Australian development and the years that are to come open up a vista of intense interest,
Queensland, the argest State except Western Australia, is dearly marked out to be a great country, if not
three great countries. A State which possesses an area of 429,120,000 acres, practically all of which is
capable of being settled under some profitable form of pastoral, agricultural, or mining occupation, is bound
to attract population and take a prominent place among the big producing countries of the world.
Practically all that holds Queensland back is the lack of people to turn its potential wealth into actual
riches. Tens of millions could find prosperity and happiness where now there are but hundreds of thousands.
The object of this work, which is encyclopaedic in information, is to represent Queensland and the Queensland
people as they are to-day, and to stimulate a world-wide interest in them. The difficulties in the way of
preparation, compilation, and printing have been formidable. Queensland, to begin with, is a country of
magnificent distances. Away from the main centres of population the outposts of settlement are far apart.
Where it ivas thought ground might be covered in weeks, months have been taken up. War, the enlistment of
contributors and employes, and the shortage of paper also imposed unforeseen delays. To these causes are due the
deferred publication. The first volume will, as speedily as possible, be followed by the second and the third.
The work is well in hand, and we trust that the standard of completeness and accuracy uhich has been
aimed at will be considered as fully condoning and excusing the time that has been taken up. No pains
have been spared in securing the latest and most accurate data. Writers specially versed in their respective
subjects have been commissioned to present the information on the various matters which have to be dealt
with. There the aim has been to combine clearness, conciseness, and literary attractiveness. The support
of men who are taking an active part in industrial, commercial, and producing interests also has been enlisted,
and in the biographies, which form a part of the work, will be found evidence of labour and courage and
ability richly rewarded. Queensland, in fact, holds out a generous hand to men of this stamp.
It is in the varied fields of primary industries that Queensland is playing the greatest part; her day
of big secondary industries has yet to come. Her numerous flocks of sheep, and her great herds of cattle, spread
over the vast plains and tableland, pastures of the interior represent a rich and increasing source of wealth.
Queensland beef and mutton and Queensland wool and Queensland butter, like good wine, need no bush.
They are an asset any country would be fortunate in possessing. The sugar-growing areas of the tropical
and subtropical coastal lands, the dairying, the general agriculture, and the fruit-growing of the rich
temperate regions, and the mining and reserves of minerals scattered in profusion over extensive areas, attest
the variety of activities open to those who have capital for investment or energy and courage to employ in
life's battles. All cannot be rich in Queensland, but none need be poor. All cannot own provinces for sheep
and cattle runs, but none need he without land adequate in area to permit of successful farming. United


to healthful climatic conditions, varying from the bracing temperature of the spacious uplands to the
agreeable circumstances of the southern coastal regions, and from the latter to the warmer summers of the
tropical belt, are facilities for land and. sea communication and for industrial development which make
Queensland a wonderfully attractive country from an immigration and settlement point of view.
All this will be found set out with a wealth of detail in this volume and those which are to follow.
The activities of the Government in relation to education, railways, public health , and general administration,
the wide ramifications of local government, the growth of cities, towns, and townships, and the steady
development of the instrumentalities of a progressive and vigorous community will be treated with reasonable
tidiness. In covering this wide ground, ready and able assistance has been given wherever it has been
sought. To the State Government Intelligence and Tourist Bureau, to the various Government Departments
and public institutions, as ivell as to numerous other instrumentalities, we are indebted for valuable help.
Use also has been made of standard historical publications. Among these have been William Coote's
“ History of Queensland,” Pugh's Almanac, Henry Stuart Bussell's “ Genesis of Queensland,” J. J■ Knight's
“In the Early Days,” and Dr. Lang's “ Gooksland ” and “Queensland.” The volume now issued may
he taken as typical of the second and third These icill contain articles from able pens dealing with a variety
of subjects. Thus the historical section will be carried on to completion, interesting records of explorers and
explorations will be drawn upon, the origin and progress of the sugar industry, the development of the
pastoral industry, and many other subjects will be comprehensively treated. The personal and picturesque
will be represented by a large number <;f biographies and well-*electcd and graphic illustrations. Hang
of the articles were written by the late Phillip Champion de Crespigny (who gave his life in the service
of his country), his position as editor being taken by the late Ernest Sando Emerson, whose death occurred
early in the present year.

into this volume, they will, if considered sufficiently
important, he corrected in the second volume,
provided that the necessary particulars he for-

The History of Queensland:
its People and Industries.
NO STATE in the Australian Commonwealth,
and few countries in the world, possess the
diversity of resources and of living condi-
tions with which Queensland has been
endowed. Her climate ranges from the altitudes
of Stanthorpe, on her southern border, where
the cold nights and fresh crisp days rival those of
gurgle among overhanging shrubs and ferns and the
landscape blazes with the heterogeneous splendour of
mile upon mile of gleaming foliage.
Queensland is best known to people outside its
borders by reason of her pastoral industry. No doubt
the stock-breeding enterprise has for years been the
mainstay of her prosperity. Certainly it is into this
HEREFORD CATTLE, BLACKROCK CREEK, COOCHIN COOCHIN.
Victoria, to the burning arid plains of her western
interior, and to the sweltering humid sunshine of her rich
tropical coast. Her primary industry varies from the
skeleton enterprise of pastoral pursuit on wide stretches,
where only grazing can be made to pay, to the intense
culture of prolific rich soil under a bounteous rainfall.
Her scenery is rich in many types, from glaring desert
sands to tropical and forested mountains where rivers
B
one resource which investors have placed most of the
capital attracted to the State. Mainly that was
because the graziers of New South Wales and of
Victoria, with money to lay out in untried fields else-
where, happened to have made their fortunes from
sheep and cattle-breeding. That was the business they
understood, and consequently they desired to extend
their operations along the lines which already had


proved to them so profitable. Other influences helped
the rapid growth of Queensland’s pastoral industry.
Her plains were wide and rich and grew such prolific
grass as is rarely seen. A very much larger tract of
country might be obtained and worked in the northern
State than could be secured and operated on the same
expenditure of capital in the south. This has tempted
many a squatter to the continent’s north-eastern corner.
A fortune appeared nearer ; whilst the pastoralist, imbued
with the spirit of his calling, hopes to control all the
territory he can. This desire arises not from greed.
Acquisitiveness may or may not operate in forming his
wish. It happens to be part of the composition of the
normal pastoralist to strive to manipulate industry on
as big a stretch of workable country as he can secure
a title of leasehold over, just as every ambitious
sea captain hopes to command the biggest ship
obtainable. And many a man is attracted to the fron-
tier of settlement for the sake of the free, fresh life it
has to offer, because his tastes lead him to a life of
open-air and healthful physical effort, to long days in
the saddle among bush where no other man is, and to
that spirit which has led Britishers to conquer the
wilderness in so many climates and on such distant parts
of the earth’s surface.
Moreover, exploitation of the pastoral industry
required the expenditure of less capital than did the
opening up of other of Queensland’s resources, such as,
for instance, her mining fields. And stock-raising was
a business already well tested and found profitable over
most of the rest of Eastern Australia. So the north-eastern
of the Australian States came at first to be regarded
(and still is to some extent) by outsiders, with little
knowledge of her diversified soils and climates, as a
huge sheep and cattle run, somewhat homogeneous in
character, and destined to carry a population but sparse
when compared with that which might be supported by
such States as Victoria and New South Wales.
Nothing could be farther from the truth than that
the pastoral industry will remain Queensland’s sole
important claim to commercial recognition. Undoubtedly,
stock-breeding has brought millions of pounds of capital
pouring across her borders, and has laid the foundation
of subsequent development and progress. Equally cer-
tain is it that of all her immense territory a large
proportion is most productively used by being turned to
pastoral pursuits in fairly large areas, so far as the
most modern methods of industry permit us to know.
But the fact that most of the sugar consumed
in the Commonwealth is produced within the
borders of this State, accompanied by the further
truism that millions of acres of land suitable to the
same industry lie virgin, because of lack of transport
facilities, testify to the capabilities of the country for
the production of tropical and subtropical crops, when
sufficient financial inducement offers to the producer.
Most tropical and subtropical crops could b© grown on
some one or other portion of Queensland’s Pacific slopes.
The State comprises an area of 429,120,000 acres, but
so far only 1,060,000 acres are cultivated. It has been
officially estimated by the technical officers of the
Agricultural Department that included within the
borders are 50,000,000 acres suited by soil and climate
to profitably produce wheat. Yet of the 4,000,000
bushels of this grain consumed annually only 2,500,000
are grown locally. Millions of acres of the richest
agricultural land lie ready to be cleared of the forests
and jungles which draw a riotous life from the soil’s
fertility; whilst millions of acres more are bare from
any obstruction to the pioneering plough, but as yet
are too far removed from railways to render agriculture
attractive.
Queensland is rich in minerals and prolific in coal,
and numbers of large high-grade deposits await but the
drawing nearer of the iron road to become abundantly
reproductive. Timber forms an industry which until
lately was exploited in only the most unscientific and
wasteful manner. Horticulture struggles still in
swaddling clothes. For the production of citrus fruits
almost unlimited possibilities present themselves, but
little more than supplying portion of Australian needs
has yet been attempted. For the industry to become
firm and great, scientifically-managed canning factories
will have to be established, just as the Tasmanians
evolved means of fruit exportation. The wide choice of
climate and environment offering so pronouncedly to any
person desiring to live in Queensland is typified in the
horticultural industry. The intending grower may
select his land and cultivate apples, peaches, and other
cold-climate species on the hills of Stanthorpe, where
the conditions, in essential important features, rival
those of Southern Tasmania; or he may spend his days
beneath a tropical coast and ship away bananas, pine-
apples, and other fruits grown in a torrid zone.
Queensland’s crying need is for population, and
yet more population. Were her present inhabitants
multiplied tenfold, then many a now neglected oppor-
tunity would be seized and turned to productive
account. The few of the many possible industries
already attempted within her wide-flung borders have
proved so successful that the slender store of human
effort which the State possesses has become absorbed
in developing a small fraction of its possibilities.
No other State has so large an area of land lying
between the Dividing Range and the sea as has Queens-
land. The mountains which mark the division between
the waters flowing direct to the sea and those turned
inwards to the saucer-like interior of the continent, in
places recede more than two hundred miles from the
Pacific coast, and the intervening country is bounteously


watered with heavier rains than ever reach the western
plains.
The geographical character of the State has ren-
dered the centralization of population and commerce, as
it exists in Victoria and New South Wales, a physical
impossibility. Northern, Central, and Southern
Queensland have their ports separate from one another
and independent. The Queensland Legislature, in its
railway construction policy, has consistently striven to
enable the producer to get his produce to the outlet
which Nature has placed nearest to his point of produc-
tion. The immense distances which have to be coped
with have rendered such an object imperative. But
decentralization has also given remoteness from one
another to different divisions of the State. The
were increased by 50 per cent. The storage of fodder
is but rarely attempted and artificial fertilizers are
seldom used. Areas held are mostly too large to
encourage that concentration of effort which would
follow the filling up of the State with adequate popula-
tion. Mighty forests and virgin jungles clothe lands
capable of supporting a teeming habitation of prosper-
ous white people. Most of these are remote from means
of ready transport, and there are insufficient people
within the State to settle and develop them even
were all of them linked up by railways. Queens-
land’s whole problem of development centralizes on the
one word “Population!”
In government Queensland is the youngest of
all the Australian States, her Legislature having

pearl-fishers and sugar-growers of the far north, and the
pastoralists of the south-west, see as little of the pur-
suits and lives of one another as though divided by the
diameter of the whole globe. Lack of railway com-
munication and a thousand miles of territory separate
the miners of Ipswich from the drovers of the .northern
runs.
A great deal has been written and publicly spoken
about the temptation to a foreign aggressor offered by
the unoccupied and unexploited Northern Territory. Yet
the resources of Queensland are still but scratched. The
cereal-growers have not learned to fallow their land, a
lesson gained in Victoria and New South Wales a decade
and a half ago, when by its acquisition yields of grain

been created as late as 1859, the date of her separation
from New South Wales. The Parliament consists of a
Legislative Assembly of seventy-two members elected on
adult franchise, and a nominee Legislative Council. No
other State Legislature has interests so wide and varied
to control. Few countries of Europe are so large and
none possesses resources so varied by climatic and
geographical conditions as is the territory legislated for
by the Parliament which meets in Brisbane. Difficulties
in law-making and administration presented by immense
distances and primitive means of transit have been
overcome by politicians, who have found it impractical
in some instances to visit their constituencies more
frequently than once in three years. Obstacles have


been conquered with the exercise of technical skill
because of members so frequently having acquired a
first-hand knowledge of local conditions and industries
by years of residence among their electors before enter-
ing the field of politics.
Party strife has always burned warmly in the Par-
liament and on the hustings of Queensland. But not
until 1915 did the Labour Party, led by Mr. J. T.
Eyau, attain real power. Once previously a Labour
Ministry, led by Mr. A. Dawson, occupied the Treasury
benches for a few brief weeks, but lack of the requisite
majority sent them back to the cool shades of Opposi-
tion. Since and including the session of 1915 Queens-
land has probably exceeded all other States in the
amount of experimental legislation which she has placed
upon the statute book. We are still, in point of time,
at too clcse a quarter to those enactments to criticize
their effects here; but strenuous were the battles in the
two Houses of Parliament when such measures were
under debate. Many of them were excused, and some
undoubtedly justified, by the Great War; but party
bitterness rose to white heat, and a condition of hostility
not before paralleled in the history of the State,
characterized the relations of the two chambers towards
one another.
From the nature of the interests they must deal
with, several members of the Queensland Cabinet
usually find it necessary to travel for several mouths
during each year’s recess. Two or three months may
be occupied by a Home Secretary, determined to obtain
a first-hand knowledge of matters along the northern
coast and in the territory of the Gulf of Carpentaria,
in visiting those regions. Population may be scanty in
such remote places, but the industries clustering round
the peninsula ports form but the nucleus of bigger
things to follow the first pioneering effort. And the
north presents problems all its own. Though it is free
from a number of the scourges which rage in other
countries of similar latitude, first the State, and then
the Federal Government, have succeeded in excluding
or stamping out many germs of alien infection. Explor-
ing navigators, in the early days of discovery on the
north-eastern Australian coast, were in the habit of
sleeping ashore clcse to water, where mosquitoes
tormented them the whole of the hours of the attempted
rest, and never was their daring followed by the yellow
fever or malaria which would have been their lot had
they faced a similar risk in other regions where there is an
equally hot climate. The diseases peculiar to Northern
Queensland, and indeed to the whole of Australia in
the same latitude, are comparatively mild. Yet a
station has been established in the north of Queens-
land for the investigation of tropical sickness. No one
realizes more than does the Government that if steam-
boats of the future should acquire sufficient speed to be
able to reach any part of Northern Australia from a
port infected with some deadly and alien plague within
a space of time shorter than the incubation period of
that particular disease germ, then a problem of great
complexity will be presented for solution by both
Federal and State authorities.
The great area of Queensland has led to the
Government adopting its complete decentralization
system regarding the administration of the railways,
deputy-commissioners being installed in power, both in
the northern and central divisions. But in some other
departments of governmental State functions a similar
splitting up of authority is not practical, the Home
department controlling sanatoriums, mental hospitals,
and other institutions for the care of the afflicted at
distances of many hundreds of miles from the capital.
Yet the difficulties of remoteness have been overcome,
and the administration certainly is now not less efficient
than it is in the smaller States. Perhaps in few parts
of the world have the inventions of the telephone and
the motor-car wrought a greater change in and simpli-
fication of governmental functions and ordinary com-
mercial and industrial adjustments than has been the
case in Queensland, where distances have been conquered
and enormous savings effected in time by the evolution
of the use of electricity and petrol.
Queensland appears destined to hold a unique
position in the Commonwealth because of the poten-
tialities of her broad line of eastern coastal territory.
Already this mainly virgin strip of land has provided the
Commonwealth with most of the sugar required for home
consumption. During the Great War it has enabled
the people of Australia to obtain their sugar at a price
considerably below the world’s parity, and thereby reap
a direct reward for the taxation which had been borne
in order, at one and the same time, to institute the
White Australia policy and to protect the sugar industry
from injury which otherwise would have been inflicted
on it by the sudden withdrawal of black labour. As the
coastal belt has been scientifically tested to ascertain its
suitability for the production of various tropical pro-
ducts with successful results, there can be no doubt that
the filling up of the State with an adequate population
will exercise the effect of having these potentialities duly
exploited, with the result of making the nation more
self-contained than is now the case. Increased inde-
pendence of the black and yellow labour-produced com-
modities of Asia and other parts of the world will then
follow as a matter of course.
The spreading out and increasing of Queensland’s
industries which must follow increased population will
assuredly serve to minimize the effects of droughts,
which in the past have wrought such havoc in the
pastoral regions of the interior. With more people
living and more industries established in the State


the disasters of 1902 and 1915 would not be
likely of repetition. Up to the present, Queens-
land has been peculiarly progressive in her railway
policy, having more miles of track in proportion to the
population than has .any other country in the world.
Railways have been built over unoccupied tracts for
developmental purposes, and for the reason that, by
affording facilities for getting stock to relief country in
bad seasons, they afford one of the best safeguards against
drought which the pastoralist knows. Further settle-
ment would increase the length of tracks, and would
bring transport facilities into vast regions from which,
under present conditions, it is impossible to move sheep
or cattle when the natural herbage disappears. The
extension of agriculture, whether it is mixed farming
suitable to the Darling Downs, the wheat-growing to
which the Roma district is so well adapted, or the
tropical culture of the coastal strip, would render avail-
able great stores of artificially-produced fodder, which
in dry seasons are now unobtainable. A multiplication
of Queensland’s primary industries undoubtedly would
aid the existing industries, not only in extending local
markets, but also in giving that variety of production
which would yield independence in fighting climatic
adversity, as well as adding to the total of wealth
annually produced from a given area. A substantial
increase of population, such as may reasonably be
expected in the not distant future, by intensifying the
demand for land, must have the effect, in such a com-
munity as that inhabiting Queensland, of improving
methods of production in the older as well as in the
newer industries.
Queensland has more to offer to the immigrant than
has any other Australian State. The width of selec-
tion is more extended. Besides the fact of her natural
resources being more plentiful, she has a greater variety
of land and of living conditions within her borders.
Tropical agriculture on rich, mountain-skirted river
flats, pastoral pursuits on vast interior stations, pearl
fishing in warm seas, apple growing on southern alti-
tudes, mining in the burning heat of the Gulf country
or the pleasant climate of the south-east, city pursuits
in any of the busy coastal cities, dairying and mixed
farming on the volcanic tablelands all these
and many other callings present themselves to the
choice of the newcomer desiring to make his home
in this most-favoured corner of the great Southern
continent.
THE GEOGRAPHY OF QUEENSLAND.
The State of Queensland contains the north-eastern
corner of the Continent of Australia. It lies between
latitude 29° and 9° South and longitude and
138° East. The area is 429,120,000 acres, or 670,000
square miles, whilst the coastline is of more than 3,000
miles. The latter contains many deep and land-locked
harbours, while the adjacent waters are liberally dotted
with islands. Queensland is three times the size of
France, and is greater than any country in Europe,
except Russia. Both Germany and Austria-Hungary
might be contained in Queensland, with a margin to
spare. The State is five and a half times as extensive
as Great Britain and Ireland. From north to south
Queensland extends for about 1,200 miles, whilst the
maritime boundary continues sixty miles further north,
including a considerable number of islands. From east
to west the greatest width of the State is about 1,050
miles.
The State is naturally divided into two parts. The
mountain range which forms the line of demarcation
between the watersheds sloping inland and those through
which rivers flow direct to the sea, both in Victoria and
New South Wales, continues through Queensland in a
northerly direction. The Main Range is a low wall of
mountains, nearly parallel with the Pacific Coast. The
course of the range is somewhat irregular, but roughly
it divides the State into a strip of tropical coastal
country plentifully watered by a heavy rainfall, and a
vast interior where the principal difficulty the settler has
to contend with is aridity.
THE THREE DIVISIONS.
For purposes of convenience in legislation and
administration Queensland is usually treated as consisting
of three districts—Southern, Central, and Northern—
the boundary lines running east and west from the coast
to the boundary with the Northern Territory. A move-
ment has existed for many years to obtain severance for
the Central District and the Northern District, so as to
constitute one or two new States. The consummation
of Federation, with the transfer to the National
Parliament of all questions affecting the whole of the
Commonwealth, would seem to have given new grounds
for the arguments in favour of a closer subdivision of the
functions of State government. Yet of recent years the
agitation appears to have almost ceased to excite
attention.
In trade and commerce Queensland has, by the
normal course of industrial development, clearly become
divided into three distinct divisions, with Brisbane the
capital of the Southern, Rockhampton the capital of the
Central, and Townsville the principal centre and port of


the Northern District. No State of the Commonwealth
has so successfully escaped from the evils of excessive
centralization of trade to one city as has Queensland.
The cities mentioned form the real outlets of the
Enormous tract of country each has behind it. To no
small extent this has resulted from the wise policy of
railway construction adopted. No effort has been made
to choose routes with the object of artificially drawing
trade from the Central Division to Brisbane, or from the
far north to some southern outlet. The lines radiate out
into the back country from Brisbane, Rockhampton, and
Townsville, according to the natural possibilities and the
needs of industrial development.
According to “The Real Property Act of 1887,” the
following is a detailed description of the boundaries of
Central Queensland: —“The southern boundary com-
mences on the east coast at the mouth of the Kolan
River, and is bounded thence on the south by the
northern watershed of that river westerly to Dawes
Range; thence by that range and the range forming the
northern and western watersheds of the Rawbelle River
and its tributaries westerly and southerly to their
junction with the southern watershed of Ross and
Cracow Creeks; by that watershed westerly to the
Dawson River; by that river downwards to Bigge Range ;
by that range westerly to Carnarvon Range; by that
range westerly to the Great Dividing Range; by that
range westerly to the Warrego Range; by that range
westerly to the Cheviot Range; by that range north-
westerly and westerly to the confluence of the Thomson
and Barcoo Rivers; thence by a line due west to the
western boundary of the State south of the twenty-fifth
parallel of latitude. The western boundary extends in a
direct line northwards from south of the twenty-fifth
parallel of latitude to the twenty-first parallel of latitude.
The northern boundary commences at the last-named
parallel easterly to its intersection with the Selwyn
Range; thence by that range, Kirby Range, and the
range forming the southern watershed of the Flinders
River and its tributaries in a general easterlv direction
again to the twenty-first parallel of latitude; thence by
that parallel easterly to the Great Dividing Range; by
that range southerly to its junction with the southern
watershed of the Cape River; by that watershed easterly
to the confluence of the Belyando and Suttor Rivers;
thence by the Suttor River upwards to its head in the
Leichhardt Range; thence by that range and the
northern watershed of Funnel Creek and its tributaries
easterly and southerly to a spur forming the watershed
separating the waters of Marion and Rockydam Creeks;
thence by that watershed north-easterly to Cape
Palmerston on the east coast of the State; thence by a
line eastward to the eastern boundary of the State ;
thence on the east by the last-named boundary southerly
to Sandy Cape, and again on the south by a line westerly
to the point of commencement, inclusive of all islands
adjacent thereto south of the latitude of Cape Palmerston
and north of the latitude of Sandy Cape.”
From this definition the boundaries of the Southern
and Northern Districts respectively may be inferred.
RIVERS.
The rivers flowing into the Pacific take their rise
in the Main Range, and their course to the sea is
necessarily short. However the rainfall in the area they
drain is heavy, and the streams in many instances have
collected large bodies of water before emptying
themselves into the ocean. Some are navigable for
considerable distances inland, a notable example being
the Brisbane River, which, though only draining an area
of 5,300 square miles and being but 210 miles in length,
contains sufficient water for vessels of 10,000 tons
fourteen miles from its mouth, and is navigable for
twenty-five miles further by small craft. The
Brisbane, Logan, and Pine Rivers empty into Moreton
Bay, the Caboolture River into Deception Bay, the Mary
and Burrum Rivers into Wide Bay, and the Burnett,
Kolan, and Elliott Rivers into Hervey Bay.
The eastern side of the Central District is
particularly well served with rivers. The most
important of these is the Fitzroy, on the banks of which
Rockhampton stands. This stream, with its tributaries,
drains an area of 55,603 square miles, whilst its length
from Keppel Bay to its source is 520 miles. Rockhampton
is forty miles from the mouth, and large vessels are able
to navigate the whole of the course, whilst ships of small
draught proceed thirty miles higher up. Other navigable
rivers in the Central District include the St. Lawrence,
Byne, Calliope, and Kolan, and Baffle Creek. The Styx
River is also negotiable to ships, but is subject to an
abnormal rise and fall of tide. The Isaac River, after
a course of 152 miles, joins the Fitzroy. The Dawson
River also joins that stream after flowing for 312
miles through country enclosed partially by the
Expedition Range on the west, the Auburn and
Leichhardt Ranges on the east, and the Great Divide
on the south. The Mackenzie is another large river
flowing into the Fitzroy. The Dee River rises in the
Razorback and Gelobera Ranges and flows into the Don,
which junctions with Granville Creek, the two then
emptying into the Dawson River.
The most important river of Northern Queensland
is the Burdekin, draining a watershed of 53,529 square
miles and discharging into Upstart Bay. Other rivers
flowing into the sea on the north-eastern coast are the
Ross, Herbert, Tully, Moresby, Johnstone, Russell,
Mulgrave, Mossman, Daintree, Bloomfield, Annan, and
Endeavour.
Streams of considerable magnitude flow into the Gulf
of Carpentaria. The larger of these are the Jardine,


Ducie, Batavia, Pennefather, Archer, Kendall, Holroyd,
Edward, Coleman, Mitchell, Staaten, Gilbert, Norman,
Bynoe, blinders, Leichhardt, and Albert Rivers.
Rivers taking their rise on the western side of the
Main Range flow for great distances inland. The
system of the Southern District contains streams that,
turning south, flow into the Darling, which, after
traversing the whole distance of Western New South
Wales from north to south, joins the Murray, and after
passing for hundreds of miles along the Victorian border
enters South Australia, and finally reaches the sea on
the southern coast of the continent. Thus the Macintyre
system which has made possible pastoral industry over
such wide areas where profitable settlement would
othdi-wise be impracticable. In the far west of the
Southern District are the Paroo, Bulloo, and Wilson
Rivers, and Cooper Creek.
The most important streams in the west of the
Central Division are the Thomson, the Alice, the
Diamantina, the Darr, the Belyando, and the Georgina.
The Thomson River, after flowing for 240 miles, joins
the Barcoo, and both eventually become part of Cooper
Creek, which ultimately loses itself in the saucer-like
depression of South Australia.
CAMBANORA GAP, KILLARNEY DISTRICT.
,(or Barwon) River joins the Moonie after crossing the
New South Wales border; the Condamine, after rising in
the mountains above Killarney, flows through portion
of the Darling Downs and finally joins the Darling
River; and the Warrego rises in the Warrego Range,
receives the Nive, Ward, and Langle, and also junctions
with the Darling.
However, a number of the other western streams
fiow for hundreds of miles in an inland direction, and
finally lose themselves in the desert sand, no doubt
important sources of supplies to the artesian
The reader who has never visited the interior of
Australia is apt to form a quite erroneous impression
of the nature of these streams by the term “rivers” being
applied to them. Often they are mere chains of water-
holes. Frequently they quite dry up, except for reaches
where the course has cut an unusually deep excavation
and contains a body of water sufficiently large to
withstand the heavy drain evaporation makes in the dry
atmosphere and fierce sun of the continent’s arid heat.
Billabongs also form natural reservoirs which have saved
the life of many a traveller, as well as proving to be


worth fortunes to stock-owners. Billabongs are old river
beds. The streams flow not regularly and continually,
always bearing something about the same quantity of
water, but spasmodically, and periodically in heavy flood.
Seldom is the course cut deep in the land, and the
old beds are continually being filled at places with sand,
so that the route of the streams frequently changes. The
holes in the old beds become filled in flood times, and the
water thus imprisoned remains for years afterwards.
Sometimes the river marked on the map as though
it were a wide and noble stream presents no greater value
to the thirsty bushman than in indicating to him
where he may obtain drink if he dig for it. Though
water may have disappeared from the surface of the
ground, it is nearly always to be found under a few feet
of baked mud. In times of heavy rains these freak rivers
of the west are converted into mighty inland seas. The
water is perhaps of no great depth, but it may extend
as far as the eye can reach, the real bed of the stream
being stamped only by the rows of trees growing along
its banks, which thrust their bulk above the current.
In the far west the so-called rivers are little more than
ducts for carrying off the occasional flood waters of heavy
rains. The streams bear less water as they flow from
their source, many of them starting promisingly from
well-watered territory, but steadily deteriorating into
the chain of water-holes which is so typical of the far
interior.
LAKES.
No part of Australia is rich in lakes. Many of
those that are marked on the maps as such are in reality
little better than large swamps, which frequently dry up
entirely. However, Central Queensland boasts of two
inland bodies of water. The largest of these is Lake
Galilee, or Jochmus, fifty-six miles to the north of
Aramac. This stretch of water is eighty square miles in
area, the greatest length being nineteen miles, the
greatest breadth ten miles, and the average depth six
feet. At one end the water is fresh, whilst at the other
it is brackish. Lake Buchanan is near the border of the
Northern District, and about sixty miles to the north of
Lake Galilee. It is fifty square miles in area, and the
water is salt. Near the South Australian border are
several large salt lakes, though their actual area of water
fluctuates greatly with the series of seasons experienced.
Their names are Philippu, Koolivoo, and Machattie.
MOUNTAINS.
Mount Bartle Frere, near Cooktown, in Northern
Queensland, is the highest peak in the State, the summit
rising to 5,438 ft. above sea-level. Mount Roberts, in
the Central District, is 4,350 ft. high ; and Mount
Barney, which forms part of the Macpherson Range, in
Southern Queensland, is 4,300 ft. above sea-level.
The mountain system of most importance in
Queensland is the northern extremity of the Great
Divide, which, after forming a line parallel to the coast
through Victoria and New South Wales, crosses into
Queensland at Wallangarra, and traverses the whole
State, to which it forms a kind of backbone. The
Dividing Range, from a climatic and therefore industrial
standpoint, makes what is probably the most important
geographical feature in the eastern portion of the
continent. At places the mountains shrink to quite
small and ordinary looking hills, but so far as dividing
the eastern and western watersheds is concerned the
range is unbroken. At many spots it is wild and rugged,
and gives rise to numerous spurs penetrating for
considerable distances into the surrounding country.
Unfortunately, the Main Range is sufficiently
high to greatly influence the rainfall from the east. The
strip between the hills and the coast is well watered,
because the moisture-laden clouds from the ocean are
continually bringing refreshing downpours, which give
birth to the masses of tropical vegetation to be met with
frequently in that region. But the altitude which the
clouds must reach before they cross the range into the
interior serves to extract the rain, and so the ridge of
high land running down the whole length of Queensland
stamps the boundary between two totally dissimilar kinds
of climate —different in the humidity of the atmosphere,
in temperature, and in rainfall.
The Main Range extends from Wallangarra to
Maryland, from where the Harris Range branches off and
runs to the north-east. The Main, or Great Dividing,
Range, then stretches to the north-east for about forty
miles, where it again divides, one portion, under the
name of the Macpherson Range, running to the coast
and terminating at Point Danger. For something over
one hundred miles the latter range forms the boundary
between Queensland and New South Wales. From its
junction with the Macpherson Range, the Main Range
runs in a westerly and north-westerly direction to a point
about thirty-five miles distant, where it again divides.
The Bunya Mountains at Dalby are part of the system,
their highest point being Mount Mowbullan (3,605 ft.)
and Mount Haly (3,130 ft.). Running parallel with the
coast to near Ipswich is the Little Liverpool Range.
Forming the watershed of the Brisbane River are the
D’Aguilar, the Yabba, and the Cooyar Ranges, together
with the Main Range. Further north is the famous
Blackall Range, rich in natural resources of timber and
containing what is perhaps the richest soil in Queensland.
In the Central District, and near the coast, are the
Normanby, Funnel, Broadsound, Connor, Boomer,
Gogango, Rannes, and Cooper Ranges. To the north-
west lies the Denham Range, whilst on the southern
boundary of Central Queensland are the Burnett,
Dawes, Bigge, Carnarvon, Warrego, and Cheviot


Ranges. The Peak Mountains lie inland, and the
Expedition and Dawson Ranges are also removed from
the coast. West of these are the Zamia and Drummond
Ranges. Through the Central District the Great
Divide is further from the coast than in any other part
of the State, in places being separated by a journey of
a couple of hundred miles from the sea.
A considerable area of Central Queensland is
mountainous in character, whilst in other localities
numerous isolated peaks are dotted about. These
elevations are of basalt, slate, granite, trachyte, lime-
stone, or sandstone. Those around Rockhampton, St.
Lawrence, Gladstone, Peak Downs, and the Springsure
district are of unique formation, and are imposing in
appearance. The range at Springsure is notable for its
rugged outlines and quaint formation.
There are several tablelands of great size in Central
Queensland, being of considerable elevation and
remarkable for their wealth of natural timbers, their
scenery, and luxuriant vegetation, whilst the climate is
so favourable that the death-rate of the division of the
State in which they lie is the lowest in the Common-
wealth. The Alice Tableland lies to the north-west of
Jericho, the Buckland Tableland (2,000 ft.) and the
Consuelo Tablelands are situated in the Springsure
district, Hope Tableland is east of Tambo, Blackdown
Tableland (2,700 ft.) is south from Dingo, and the
Broadsound Tableland (from 2,000 to 3,000 ft.) is in
the St. Lawrence district.
The following are the heights of the loftiest points
in the various mountains and ranges of Central Queens-
land : —Broadsound Range, about 3,000 ft.; Denham
Range, about 3,000 ft.; Peak Mountains, about 2,000
ft.; Drummond Range, about 3,000 ft. ; Expedition
Range, about 3,000 ft.; Mount Archer, 1,612 ft.;
Berserker Mountains, 1,480 ft.; Mount Larcom, 2,048
ft.; High Double Mount, 2,545 ft. ; Castle Tower, 2,048
ft.; and Long Hill, 2,332 ft.
In the Northern District the Great Dividing Range
approaches closer to the Pacific Coast. The mountains
continue in a northerly direction for the full length of
the Cape York Peninsula. The range is bold and rugged,
containing many peaks of considerable altitude. All the
way from Townsville to the extremity of the peninsula
but a narrow strip of land lies between the broken sides
of the hills and the sea, all the rivers of any magnitude,
such as the Gilbert, the Mitchell, and the Archer flowing
west into the Gulf of Carpentaria.
THE COASTLINE.
The coast of Queensland contains many beautiful
harbours, which, together with the navigable rivers,
provide liberal accommodation for shipping. For
long distances at a stretch the coastal waters
are dotted with islands of varying size, and these,
too, provide safe anchorage for vessels during the
violent hurricanes to which the region is subject at
certain periods of the year. But the most remarkable
feature of the Queensland coast is the Great Barrier
Reef, which for more than one thousand miles runs
parallel to the eastern side of the continent. The reef
is a coral formation, and a wide, safe passage for the
largest ships lies between it and the land. In places,
however, this inside passage is bisected with minor reefs,
and though the whole area has been completely surveyed
by the Admiralty steamers have met destruction by
losing their bearings through the effects of storms
combined with currents, and so striking one of these
obstructions.
On the eastern coast the following ports have been
established:—Brisbane (the capital), Maryborough,
Bundaberg, Gladstone, Rockhampton, St. Lawrence,
Mackay, Bowen, Townsville, Lucinda, Mourilyan,
Innisfail, Cairns, Port Douglas, Cooktown, and, at the
extreme north, Thursday Island. The principal points
of interest along the coast inside the Great Barrier Reef
are : —Baffle Creek Port, Round Hill Head, Lady Elliott
Island, the Bunker Group of Islands, Bustard Head,
Port Curtis, Facing Island, Gatcombe Head, Curtis
Island, The Narrows (between Port Curtis and Broad-
mount Harbour, with Curtis Island on the east side).
Cape Capricorn, the Capricorn Group of Islands,
Port Alma, Sea Hill, Broadmount Harbour, Emu Park,
Wreck Island, Keppel Islands, Yeppoon, Water Park
Point, Townshend Island, Cape Townshend, Shoalwater
Bay, Percy Islands, Pine Islet, Broadsound Harbour,
Northumberland Isles, and Cape Palmerston.
In the Gulf of Carpentaria, Normanton and Burke-
town are established ports. Other natural harbours
lend themselves to providing for shipping requirements
at such times as the increase of settlement creates the
demand. In the matter of harbours Queensland
possesses great advantages. Bowen and Gladstone
Harbours compare favourably even with Port Jackson;
whilst almost every fertile district possesses some natural
coastal outlet for its present and future production.
POPULATION.
The estimated population of Queensland in 1917 was
669,467, exclusive of aborigines, or less than one person
to every square mile of territory. The population within
ten miles of Brisbane General Post Office was 168,393,
the proportion thus showing a lesser degree of centraliza-
tion than exists in any other of the mainland Australian
States. The people, however, are mostly concentrated in
the Southern District, which contains more than half a
million persons.
Queensland possesses one of the most healthy
climates in the wmrld, as shown by the following table of
death-rate per 1,000 inhabitants in various countries.


So far as is possible the figures given are for the year
1913:
Queensland ... ... ... ... ... 10*39
New South Wales ... ... ... ... 10*91
Western Australia ... ... ... ... 9*35
New Zealand ... ... ... ... ... 9*47
South Australia ... ... ... ... ... 10*82
Victoria ... ... ... ... ... ... 11*11
Tasmania ... ... ... ... ... ... 10*87
England and Wales ... ... ... ... 13*5
Canada ... ... ... ... ... ... 14*0
Scotland ... ... ... ... ... ... 15*3
Ireland ... ... ... ... ... ... 17*1
German Empire ... ... ... ... ... 17*2
France ... ... ... ... ... ... 17*9
Austria ... ... ... ... ... ... 21*2
Italy 19*6
Spain ... ... ... ... ... ... 23*3
Hungary ... ... ... ... ... ... 23*6
Russia (European) ... ... ... ... 29*9
The birth-rate per 1,000 inhabitants in 1913 for the
various portions of Australasia was:
Queensland ... ... ••• ••• ••• 30*26
New South Wales ... ••• ••• 28*83
Victoria ... ... ... ••• ••• ••• 25*82
South Australia ... ... ... ••• ••• 29*12
Western Australia ... ... ••• 29*40
Tasmania ... ... ... ••• ••• ••• 30*03
New Zealand ... ... ... ••• 26*14
Allowance should be made in estimating the value
of these statistics for the tendency of people in their
early prime to emigrate to Queensland, both from the
other Australian States and from overseas. This has
undoubtedly proved a factor in lowering the death-rate
and increasing the birth-rate. Yet the figures quoted
may be taken as disproving a common belief of the
northern portions of the Commonwealth being injurious
to health and tending to shorten life.
THE SCENERY OF QUEENSLAND.
Queensland is remarkable for the wide variety of its
scenery. Few parts of the world present contrasts so
sharp in physical features or in vegetation. The beauty
of mighty forests along the coastal fringe, and the
grandeur of rugged mountain ranges running up the
eastern side of the State, give place, in the vast and open
interior, to immense tracts of seemingly limitless plains
and to enormous areas of open-timber country,
relieved only by low ridges, which succeed one another
in unchanging monotony for hundreds of miles. Wide,
deep streams reach the Pacific Coast by passages cut
through high hills and across densely timbered flats,
where huge trees and dense undergrowth form an almost
impenetrable barricade, except where the conquering
axe and plough of the pioneer have established sugar
farms or some other forms of primary industry. But
away to the west, save in short periods of heavy rains,
the river courses are but long series of water-holes or
straggling scars on the face of plains, showing where
water once ran, but from where it has mostly evaporated.
The scenery about Brisbane hardly resembles that
surrounding any other Australian capital. The city
has been built on the banks of a wide and commanding
stream, which twists sharply through an orderless
profusion of timbered hills. The metropolis is environed
in native trees. While Melbourne and Adelaide have
been built mainly upon plains, and Sydney in a stunted
kind of scrub, the site for Brisbane has been hewed among
large open forest, much of which is still standing, even
in the suburbs. All around Brisbane are wooded ranges
stretching as far back as the eye can reach to the west,
the south, and the north, whilst in the far inland back-
ground the blue outlines of the Dividing Range mark
the boundary between the eastern and western
watersheds, and show the limits of the coastal climate.
Mount Coot-tha lies within five miles of the General
Post Office, and Mount Gravatt about a mile further in
another direction. Though endowed with somewhat
pretentious names, these are no more than hills, the
former being 743 ft. above sea-level and the latter 671 ft.
However, the summit of either is considerably higher
than most of the surrounding country for many miles
around, and a panoramic view of the whole metropolitan
area and a large section of the south-eastern corner of
the State stretches away as far as the eye can reach.
From Mount Coot-tha one of the most striking features
of the view lies in- the dark-green which everywhere
clothes the earth, from the distant sand-rimmed edge of
Moreton Bay to the dim blue of the far-distant western
mountains. From horizon to horizon the scene is filled
with tree-clothed ranges, except where the brighter
emerald of river-flats gleams through the darker shades
and forms a picturesque setting to the glistening waters
of the tortuous Brisbane River. The wealth of vegeta-
tion everywhere yields unmistakable evidence of a
plentiful rainfall.
To the far south-east, the aid of a telescope will
reveal Tweed Heads, where a township nestles alongside
the edge of the sea. Due south lies the Macpherson
Range, the dividing line between Queensland and New
South Wales. Towering over this line of hills, with its
outline dimned by the distance intervening, the peak of
Mount Warning meets the sky. This, however, is not
the highest elevation within view, though it is 3,850 ft.
above the level of the sea. A little further to the west
the horizon is bordered by Mount Goolman, Flinders
Peak (2,240 ft.), Mount Baney (4,300 ft.), and
Mount Lindsay (4,071 ft.). Still more to the west


BARRON FALLS CAIRNS RAILWAY, NORTHERN QUEENSLAND.


lies the Main Range, including Mount Huntley (4,153
ft.) and Mount Cordeaux (4,100 ft.); whilst Cunning-
ham Gap, of historic interest and romance from the days
of early exploration, shows against the sky-line like a
chip carefully chiselled from the mountain chain by some
giant hand desiring to open a way to the vast and fertile
Darling Downs beyond.
BEAUTIES OF THE EAST COAST.
The best known and most favoured of Queensland’s
scenic attractions lie along the eastern coast from
Brisbane to Cairns. This is the regular course of some of
the largest Australian coastal steamers, and the voyage
forms perhaps the most pleasurable winter excursion
available in Australian waters. In places the coast is
wildly beautiful, whilst every now and again the course
of ships lies through clusters of fairy-like islands dotted
about the face of the blue Pacific Ocean like gems of
emerald. During the calm weather usually prevailing
the scenery in these land-locked passage-ways is fairy-like
and inexhaustible in its changing interest. But unfor-
tunately the weather is as variable as the scenery, and
though the route for the whole distance lies within the
Great Barrier Reef of coral which runs parallel to the
coast for more than a thousand miles, at certain seasons
of the year hurricanes of death-dealing violence sweep the
face of the waters. Large and well-equipped steamers
have been lost in these regions, the oialy traces of them
ever to be discovered consisting of small .fragments of
wave-tossed wreckage ultimately washed ashore.
The isle-studded waters of the Queensland coast
contain no more beautiful spot than Whitsunday
Passage, extending from Gloucester Head in the north
to Cape Conway in the south, and dotted with islands
of unique and quaint formation. The place is approxi-
mately half-way between the northern and southern
extremities of the State, and the entrancing scenery it
presents is typical of what from time to time is met with
almost the whole of the way from Moreton Bay to Cape
York Peninsula. The passage is formed by more than
forty islands, clothed with a wild profusion of tropical
foliage of different shades and hues, and varying in area
from one to forty-three square miles. The islands
themselves, together with the Great Barrier Reef, afford
a perfect shelter from the wildest of the storms which
sometimes rage to the eastward, so that the deep blue
waters of the many straits bear a perpetual calm.
The islands of the Whitsunday Group are every-
where broken in outline, with wide, deep inlets running
in places for as much as three miles into their interior,
and with rugged mountains rising abruptly from the
water-line to an altitude of considerably over 1,000 ft.
Many of these havens of refuge possess great depths of
water, and a whole fleet might easily lie hidden about
the bays without discovery by passing ships. On the
inner side of Whitsunday Island lies Cid Harbour,
perhaps the most beautiful mixture of tropical
land scenery and peaceful blue sea to be found
anywhere in the world. The feature of this part of the
coast cannot be passed over without reference being made
to the panorama to be seen from Mount Oldfield, on
Lindeman Island. A whole cluster of isles opens out to
view from this point of vantage, the majestic beauty and
infinite variety of the picture holding the spectator fairly
spellbound with admiration at
. sea-girt isles
That, like to rich and various gems, inlay
The unadorned bosom of the deep.
Not less interesting than by sea is the scenery
viewed during the overland trip along the North Coast.
The journey as far as Rockhampton, a distance of 396
miles from Brisbane, may be made by rail, which nearly
all the way passes through a profuse wealth of tropical
vegetation, interspersed with sugar plantations, and
frequently presenting interesting and beautiful glimpses
of mountains. Much of the country passed through is
broken, whilst everywhere that the hand of the axeman
has not been busy, towering timber clothes hillside and
river-flat alike. Indeed, the vegetation is the first
feature to attract the attention of the traveller. Dense
masses of undergrowth struggle interminably for daylight
about the trunks of towering giants of the forest, which
fling their leafy heads for hundreds of feet into the air
above. Every now and again the route to the northward
is intercepted by some substantial stream flowing broad
and deep, with a body of water which tells of regular
and heavy rainfall about the surrounding hills. The
creeks here are not what would be so termed in the
arid west; they are substantial rivers, which would
transform the whole industrial possibilities of the interior
if lying on the western instead of on the eastern side
of the mountain ridge which marks the boundary between
the two classes of country and climate.
All along the North Coast the country is varied and
interesting. The streams flow at'times through wide
flats of rich alluvial soil, brought down from the hills
by their own flood waters; whilst elsewhere they tumble
furiously along rocky gorges cut deejo between the
frowning sides of the range. In places the hillsides are
little more than barren rock, but elsewhere the wealth
and variety of the foliage displays the existence of quite
another class of soil. In the latter localities a rich mould
has been made by centuries of decaying vegetation
accumulating layer upon layer.
The coastline is bold and rocky, and in places
grandly beautiful. A notable beauty spot between
Brisbane and Rockhampton, which is not more popular
only because its physical features are so little known, is
Noosa, where the river of that name enters the sea by


way of a coast on wdiich the waves have cut all kinds of
caves and quaint shapes in the solid barricade of rock
that in places forms towering cliffs. A piece of scenery
typical of the coast has been named Hell’s Gates, at
Noosa. With a strong north-east or south-east wind,
and an incoming tide, Hell’s Gates present a medley of
furiously fighting elements and thunders of noise as the
huge billows of the mighty Pacific surf dash their
stupendous bulk at the unyielding walls of stone. The
waves of the ocean, entering by a narrow passage, dash
violently like captured live things within the chamber
of frowning cliffs, and finally, with something between
a sullen roar and an agonized gasja of pain they retire,
after each onslaught, to gather force for another mad
So far as the paths of the tourists go, the famous
Barron Falls, on the Cairns Range, to the far north,
border on the edge of the unknown. The Chillagoe
Caves, the Royal Arch, and the Organ and Snow Caves
have frequently been visited by sightseers ; but among
the towering limestone cliffs between Chillagoe and
Mungana, which rear their fantastic peaks in all kinds
of quaint shapes, there are no doubt scores of unknown
caves awaiting the explorer to systematically
investigate the weird and unknown wonders concealed
beneath their rugged exteriors. This part of Queensland
promises a rich reward for the searcher for mineral
wealth or virgin beauty.
Barron Falls form a feature quite unique in

charge. The Devil’s Kitchen and the Boiling Pot are
other points of interest where the friction of the sea,
wearing through centuries, has worked peculiar effects
in the rocks of the coast.
Back from the shore the explorer after scenic
novelty quickly plunges into the depths of the forest.
With the roar of the restless waves still thundering in
his ears, he may find spots sheltered from every passing
breeze, where the scent from the tropical flowers and
leaves is almost overpowering in its intense sweetness,
and where a mixture of countless shrubs with giant ferns,
beneath a canopy of gum leaves, confines his path to
the dry bed of some mountain torrent or to a track
hewed through the forest by settlers.
Australian scenery, except for one spot in Tasmania.
In one -wild plunge the water drops a sheer thousand
feet. The Barron River, immediately above, saunters
for some distance along a relatively level bed and flows
gently through a little lake. For half a mile or so below
the latter the waters gurgle and rush through mountain
boulders which litter its course. But while you stand
gazing at this peaceful scene there drums on your ears
a ceaseless roar like nothing you ever heard in your life
before, unless perchance you have visited some of the
world’s show places in the other hemisphere. You
explore somewhat further along the track of the waters,
which gather speed and force and sound at every step
you take; but above all other sounds rises that


deafening din, and shortly you see the river turning to
foam and disappearing over the sheer side of a precipice,
leaping into the air, and, by a series of plunges, striking
ledge after ledge of rock, and bounding off again into
space, until finally it drops through a cloud of spray into
a whirling pool of whiteness below. Examination of the
gorge reveals never-ending beauties and perpetual interest
to the Nature-lover. Not the least among the latter
are the traces of the passage of mighty glaciers, suggest-
ing visions of prehistoric times when huge rivers of ice
cut channels for themselves through barriers of rock.
THE DARLING DOWNS.
The Darling Downs district presents a type of
scenery peculiar to itself, being unlike either the well-
watered tropical coast lands or the arid inland interior.
Literally, this is the garden of Queensland, being
situated upon the southern plateau, attaining to as much
as 3,000 ft. above sea-level, and varying in physical
features from rugged mountain ranges to wide-spreading,
open grass lands, in parts of which pleasant farms stretch
as far as the eye can roam. Toowoomba, which is the
largest town on the Darling Downs, though only some
101 miles from Brisbane, is elevated 2,000 ft. above
sea-level, being situated on the Main Range, which,
running north and south parallel to the coast, divides
the watersheds of the streams falling into the Pacific
from those flowing inland. A magnificent view of the
mountains is obtained from Picnic Point, close to
Toowoomba. Here peak after peak may be seen, with
open downs stretching away in the distance and all the
country round as far as the eye can reach bearing elo-
quent testimony of rich soil and abundant rainfall.
The panorama holds infinite interest to the naturalist,
who may discern a rough outline of the geological history
of the immense expanses spreading out at his feet, where
earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and the fierce torrential
rush of diverted inland seas have all played their part
in forming the landscape and giving character to the
soil.
Anything approaching a lengthy journey over the
Darling Downs reveals scenes of never-ending fertility.
After a sufficiency of rain, the chocolate-and-black soil
gives life to a prolific wealth of herbage, rarely
excelled in any other part of the Commonwealth.
Spreading flats are seen to hold stores of riches yet
but little exploited, whilst wide plains and great expanses
of open timber land maninfest a potentiality not fully
realized even by the Queenslanders themselves. There
are signs of the many geological changes through which
the wonderful plateau has passed since first it emerged
from the level of the sea. The coal beds which have been
discovered here and there show that great ferns and
mighty forests of giant trees of species now long extinct
have once grown upon its surface; whilst there is
abundant evidence to prove that at a later date the
landscape was covered by the waters either of a sea or
partially by groups of lakes. Here is a cluster of
flourishing farms on what in a bygone age was a great
marsh, clothed in a coarse, reedy vegetation, through
which wandered huge monsters, of which but a few
fossilized bones remain. Debris of mammoth skeletons
and fragments of shells as old as the hills themselves
have been dug up from the river beds in the country over
which you travel. The pleasant Downs, stretching
before your view, were formed by the same process as
led to the burying and preservation of relics of the flora
and fauna of prehistoric times. The lake beds and
marshes have been gradually filled by earth and decaying
vegetation held in suspension and then dropped by the
waters of long eras ago, whilst by an equally gradual
process the channels of the streams cut so deep into the
plateau as to completely and thoroughly drain the land,
thus leaving an intensely fertile soil of from four to
sixty feet in depth.
Farming land, ranking with the most fertile and
picturesque in the whole Commonwealth, lies along the
eastern side of the Darling Downs, where the plateau
first slopes off from the crest of the Main Range. Here
pleasant homesteads nestle in the brightest of emerald
paddocks, sheltered on each side by towering hills where
the dark-green of adjacent timber shades imperceptibly
into the blue of the more distant mountain tops. Crystal
streams ripple peacefully through borders of ferns and
shrubs, and a wealth of bright-plumaged birds makes the
sunlight merry with their ceaseless noise. In shaded
nooks the pure air is sharp and invigorating. The
ranges stand out bold and picturesque against the cloud-
less sky, and mighty boulders show their rugged masses
through the dense tangles of trees and clinging under-
growth.
The Stanthorpe district is typical of this portion of
the Darling Downs. Lying near the border of New
South Wales and close to the Main Range this part
of the plateau attains an altitude of 3,000 ft., whilst
immediately adjacent hilltops reach to over 4,000 ft.
To gaze down on the township of Stanthorpe from some
point of vantage near by is to bring to mind all the
characteristics of some Victorian or Tasmanian scene.
The surrounding land is divided and subdivided into
carefully cultivated orchards, where the temperate nature
of the climate enables apples, pears, and other Old World
fruits to be grown to perfection. Approximately 5,000
acres are under horticulture, and the landscape is studded
with English trees. The altitude gives a climate which
attracts seekers after health for hundreds of miles
around. The neighbouring district is full of interesting
features.
Close to the town—indeed, forming part of it—rise
hills of which the outlines draw the interest of the visitor


like a magnet. Near at hand are huge walls of granite,
turreted and shaped, as though the work of some ancient
race of giants. Mighty fissures here and there cut
through the masses of stone, where the action of water
through countless ages has maintained the relentless
change which Nature works in the triumphs of her own
past. The Bald Mountain is a gigantic mass of solid and
naked rock, dotted only here and there with a few
dwarfed shrubs, where little crevices in the rock have
permitted meagre collections of earth. Another peculiar
formation of the granite is the Sentimental Rocks, about
four miles from the town.
About twenty-five miles from Stanthorpe the district
holds scenery which is weirdly grand. The Severn
tumbles down a course with features resembling those
of a miniature Sierra Nevada. In rapid rushes the
stream pours over a rough canon-bottom, through huge
boulders which have tumbled from the mountains on
either side, whilst here and there the river pauses in
its mad career, and deep, cool pools make a pleasant
contrast to the noisy voice of the waters above and below.
Out to the west the varied and rugged picturesque-
ness of broken country gives place to gradually widening
plains, which stretch away to the interior as far as the.
traveller can see and for hundreds of miles beyond. Here
are vast expanses of waving vegetation, varied only by
the darker green of rippling crops, and dotted by the
dwellings of pioneering agriculturists. The station
homesteads in this area in many instances are places of
beauty, being surrounded with mature plantations of
varied sheltering trees of different shades, mingling their
foliage in a heterogeneous tangle of colour. The farm
houses passed by the way are in several stages of improve-
ment, some of them dotting the plains like so many
inverted boxes, unadorned by artificial vegetation and
the prey to every gale which sweeps the open spaces, but
others showing the beginnings of a cheerful and restful
environment, young plantations pushing their heads
above the tops of the enclosing fence posts and girdling
carefully tended flower-beds within.
THE INTERIOR OF THE STATE.
An impression of overwhelming immensity at first
interests and then depresses the newcomer to the mighty
expanses of Queensland's empty interior. Only a limited
class of people possesses anything like a comprehensive
conception of the rolling plains, the stretches of timbered
land, the interminable ridges, the endless succession of
dry watercourses, and the gradually intensifying aridity
which mark the stages of progress to the far west. The
overlanders, who travel not dozens but hundreds and
even thousands of miles across the face of the continent’s
silent places, are soaked in what may be described best
as the soul of the bush. You do not learn to know it
by skimming over the face of the country in train or
motor-car, and you can become familiar with it far less
by penetrating here and there by isolated routes into the
heart of the back country. But the stockman who has
spent week after week and month after month sitting
loosely in the saddle while a great mob of store cattle
graze and walk, with their heads turned always in the
one direction, has become intimate with every variation
in the character of the land he passes over, so that
differences appearing small to the casual observer, to him
denote great changes in the nature of the pastures and
the probabilities of obtaining water for his stock.
The aridity of the country, however, is apparent
from the outward features of the scenery. The timber
is of drought-resistent descriptions; the herbage has been
evolved by the struggle of the survival of the fittest to
withstand the trials of long periods of scarcity of
moisture. The country is not beautiful. To the stranger
its monotony grows almost sickening. But the bushman
has come to know the environment, and probably it
proves not less attractive to him than rugged mountain
ranges do to men who have been born and bred in more
picturesque surroundings.
The far north is less barren of physical attractions,
and possesses beauties peculiarly its own. Vegetation
is thick, grass grows long and plentifully, and timber
is entwined with dense masses of undergrowth, whilst
great rivers flow deep and strong. Here lies the virgin
wealth of Australia, a mighty territory untouched by
the hand of man —empty, prolific, and inviting. The
romance attaching to all fertile uninhabited places rests
on this great silent land, crossed by certain routes by
venturesome overlanders, but mostly unknown in its
silent potentiality and hardly exploited at all, even by
the most daring of pioneers.
THE CLIMATE OF QUEENSLAND.
Climate includes the peculiar state of the atmosphere
in any given place in the matter of temperature,
humidity, and meteorological conditions generally, in
so far as they influence life. Differences of climate in
various localities arise mainly from distance from the
equator, altitude above sea-level, distance from the
coast, and the prevailing winds. The first records of
a scientific climatology were left by Ptolemy, who
divided the surface of the globe from the equator to
the Arctic circles into parallel zones, each of which


corresponded to the increase of a quarter of an hour in
the length of a midsummer day. The foundations of
scientific meteorology in Australia were laid by Sir
George Kingston in South Australia in 1839. This
gentleman continued observations of the rainfall until
1878.
That the climate of Queensland should be highly
Beneficial in its effects on the inhabitants was the
expressed anticipation of observers from the time of
earliest free settlement, and this view has certainly been
justified by subsequent records, those extending up to
the time of writing the present article showing the
death-rate in this part of the Commonwealth to be
lower than that of any other State, except Western
Australia, and to compare favourably with the most
healthful parts of the world. In 1842 Surveyor
Clement Hodgkinson, in describing the coast from
Sydney to Moreton
Bay, wrote : —“The ex-
perience of over half
a century has proved
that no country in the
world is more exempt
from all the classes
of disorders which
originate in impure air
and deleterious miasma
than Australia.” In 1879
Collins had written :
“The Sydney climate is
allowed by all to be
fine and salubrious.” In
1846 Dr. Dorsey, of
Ipswich, wrote to Dr.
Lang as follows: —“We
have few diseases not
common at home, and
are exempt from many
that are common there.
On our first settlement there were many cases of
ague, but none proved fatal, and I have not seen
a case for three years. Women and children are
■subject to very few diseases. In short, it is almost
too healthy for doctors.” About the same time Dr.
Lang received a letter from Dr. Keith Ballow, who
had been eight years Government Medical Officer at
Moreton Bay, and who wrote: —“The district of More-
ton Bay is altogether an extremely healthy one, there
Being very few deaths from disease of any kind. The
■climate in the winter season is one of the finest in the
world. This district is not a profitable one for doctors.”
In his book, “Queensland,” Dr. Lang himself subse-
quently wrote : —“There is the utmost difference imagin-
able between the rigorousness of a Canadian winter of
six or seven months’ duration and the Paradisiacal
climate of Queensland, in which the productions of both
temperate and torrid zones grow harmoniously together,
and the process of vegetation goes on uninterruptedly
during the whole year.”
A similar story is told throughout the records of
exploration and first settlement in the interior of that
part of New South Wales destined to be constituted the
colony of Queensland in 1859. The journals of Oxley,
Mitchell, Gray, Eyre, Sturt, Gregory, Leichhardt,
Burke and Wills, McKinlay, and Stuart tell of much
sickness, but there is every reason to attribute it to bad
diet and to a reduced general health due to that cause,
and to physical exhaustion. Great sufferings also
sprang from bad and insufficient water and from great
heat; but there are no records of fever or other sickness
attributed to an unhealthy climate. A. Meston, in his
“Geographic History of Queensland,” relates that the
first cedar was cut in
Queensland by convicts
on the Logan and
Albert rivers in 1827.
The timber-getters went
north to the Mary and
Burnett, and thence far
north to the tropical
jungles of the John-
stone, Mulgrave, Bar-
ron, and Daintree. They
camped often on the
edges of, or in open
spaces in, dense scrub,
drank water full of
vegetation, eat the com-
monest of flour, sugar,
and salt beef, drank
much rum, and gener-
ally lived hard, rough
lives, and yet as a
rule enjoyed first-class
health, “for otherwise they could not have done the
heavy work which timber-getting demanded.”
QUEENSLAND PECULIARITIES.
From the days of first settlement the advantages of
the Queensland climate have been appreciated by those
living within what in 1859 became the boundaries of the
colony; but Australians with no personal experience of
the conditions of life in the north-eastern corner of the
continent, and critics who have never visited these
shores, have sometimes assumed a greater intensity of
heat than exists and dangers to the health of the inhabi-
tants which have never been felt. To no small extent
this has been given colour to by interested employers
of labour, who have endeavoured to bolster up a case
in favour of the importation of Asiatics and other

coloured aliens for service on the canefields and at
other tropical enterprises. That this view is unjustified
by the facts has been established by vital statistics
relating to the northern population, where life is as
long and the mortality as low as in any other part of
the continent.
The climate of Queensland may roughly be divided
into two sections—that prevailing in the coastal regions
to which the moisture-laden winds from the tropical
and semi-tropical seas bear a bounteous rainfall, and the
interior to the west of the “Great Divide,” where the
atmosphere is free from the marked humidity of the
compiled by the officials of the Commonwealth Bureau of
Meteorology:
Queensland contains the wettest-known place in the
Commonwealth. This is the district about Geraldton,

eastern strip and where the rainfall is much less,
decreasing progressively in the desert country of the
extreme west. At Geraldton, in the northern por-
tion of the eastern coast, the average rain for
twenty-one years was 145'27 inches per annum ;
whilst the fall along the boundary of the Northern
Territory, excepting its northern end, is below 10 inches
each year. A conception of the distribution of rain in
Queensland, as well as in the other States, may be
obtained from the map appearing on page 16. The
figures in the following table, showing the total
areas subject to various degrees of moisture, have been
c
where 211'24 inches have fallen in twelve months, and
where the lowest fall in a year was 69‘87 inches, the
range thus being 14D37 inches. The heaviest fall ever
recorded within 24 hours in the State was 35'71 inches
at Crohamhurst, on the Blackall Range, on February
2, 1893.
CLIMATE OF BRISBANE.
The climate of Brisbane, owing to the situation of
the capital in the south-eastern corner of the State, is
hardly typical of that of either of the main divisions
of the State. In several respects the conditions normal
at Brisbane are superior to those prevalent at any other

of the Australian capital cities. The sudden changes
from extreme heat to sharp cold, which form so pro-
minent a feature of the summer seasons of Adelaide and
Melbourne, and, in a lesser degree, of Sydney and
Hobart, are entirely absent from the southern coast of
Queensland. On the other hand, each summer day in
Brisbane usually brings a mild change early in the
afternoon, when the heat of the forenoon is pleasantly
tempered by a gentle sea breeze rarely failing to make
a cool and refreshing evening. The distressing extremes
of temperature with which the heat waves of the
southern cities bring sleepless nights, are absent from
the district about Moreton Bay between sundown and
sunset. Yet whilst the semi-tropical character of the
climate gives a greater evenness to the summer tempera-
ture, the higher humidity proves more trying to some
constitutions than do the more marked fluctuations of
the south. The winter climate of the Queensland
capital ranks among the most enjoyable and health-
giving in the world.
Official records, extending over a period of fifty
years ending with December 31, 1914, show the average
annual rainfall of Brisbane to be 48'05 inches. The
wettest months are February, March, January, and
December in that order. The averages given in the
following table are for the fifty years period, whilst the
numbers of wet days quoted for the various months
refer to days on which one or more points of rain fell
within the 24 hours:
The following comparisons of rainfalls at six capital
cities are based on various terms of years, as quoted in
each instance :
The highest temperature to be recorded in Brisbane
during a period of 27 years ending on December 31,
1914, was 108 - 9 on January 14, 1902. Taking the same
term as a basis for calculation, January ranks as the
hottest month, the mean shade temperature being 77 2
degrees, and the maximum mean temperature 85'4, the
latter also ranking as the highest of any month. The
coldest month is July, for which the average tempera-
ture is 58'1, and the mean minimum for which stands
at 48'0. The mean humidity stands highest in May
and June, for which the figure is 74, and lowest in
November at 59.
RAINFALL.
Uncertainty and scarcity of rainfall doubtless have
formed the principal obstacles in the path of pastoral
and agricultural settlement in the interior of Queens-
land. Articles in this work dealing with the primary
industries of the State give particulars of the damage
which drought at times has inflicted upon the prosperity
and progress of the community. The most severe periods
of aridity to occur since industry was firmly established
ever the major part of the interior have been in 1902
and in 1915.
Up to the present, lack of capital, coupled with
failure to appreciate the possibilities of modern scien-
tific methods, has retarded the application of knowledge
which latter-day investigation has rendered available in
the direction of militating against the evil effects of both
severe but temporary drought and milder but chronic
aridity. The State experimental farms have been used
to show that wheat-growers on the interior plains might
greatly increase their yields of grain by the adoption of
American methods of dry-farming; whilst it has been
demonstrated by practical experience that pastoral
enterprise may be greatly fortified against loss from dry
years by means of improved water conservation, artesian
boring, and by railway and road construction. Every
indication points to industry becoming increasingly
productive and progressively more stable as a source of
wealth in the drier regions of the State with the passing
of each year of closer settlement. The enormous areas
in which single holdings have been granted to individuals
and to joint stock companies have prevented steps being
taken to counteract the effects of climatic adversity.
Barely any headway has been made in Queensland
in the matter of conserving water for purposes of
irrigation, yet many parts of the State offer peculiar
advantages in average rainfall, soil, and the natural
conformation of the country, for the adoption of this
form of enterprise. Experience in many parts of the
world shows fertility commonly to co-exist with
aridity, and the facts all point to profitable achieve-
ments already consummated in the valley of the River
Murray by Southern Governments to be possible of
successful imitation in the Northern State.

The above figures, which have been compiled by
the Queensland Government Statistician, are not based
on the same period of years as previous figures, which
were taken from the records of the Commonwealth
Meteorological Bureau. Innisfail and Geraldton, which
are situated a short distance to the north of Mourilyan
Harbour, between latitudes 17° and 18° South, are
shown by all records to occupy the wettest spot on the
continent.
CYCLONES AND STORMS.
The north coast of Quenesland is visited at cer-
tain regular seasons by hurricanes of great velocity.
These usually occur during the first three months of the
year, and appear to have their origin in the neighbour-
hood of the South Pacific Islands, their path being a
parabolic curve of south-westerly direction. But of the
total taking their rise in that locality only a small pro-
portion reach the Australian coast, the majority recurv-
ing their path to the east of New Caledonia.
During the rainy portion of the year exceptional
falls sometimes visit various portions of the State. The
following list includes only instances when not less than
twenty inches were officially recorded to have fallen
within 24 hours:
In 1892 Brisbane was isolated for nearly a fortnight
and a considerable portion of the city and its environs
submerged by a flood on the Brisbane River. Since
then the river has been straightened and deepened, and
a repetition of that experience is regarded now as out-
side the range of possibility.

VITAL STATISTICS.
While the death-rate prevailing in any country is
directly and profoundly influenced by the general degree
of education and the living standard of the community,
favourable vital statistics cannot co-exist with adverse
climatic conditions. A beneficial physical environment,
as well as exceptional social and economic advantages,
has contributed to making Australians and New Zea-
landers the longest living and most healthy people in
the world. For having a low death-rate, Queensland
stands so high among Australian States as to refute any
suggestion of the tropical and semi-tropical nature of
the conditions prevailing in the north-eastern portion of
the continent proving unfavourable to the health of
Europeans.
A comparison of the infant mortality of the six
Australian States shows that, in proportion to aggregate
of population, fewest children under one year of age
die in Queensland.
The following table gives the general death-rate of
various States and countries:


The severe and trying heat of the interior of the
northern coastal districts of Queensland is compensated
for by the absence of rain during the winter months,
when for weeks together the chill of the nights alternates
with pleasant cloudless days. On the highlands sunny
winters are characterized by an atmosphere as health-
giving and invigorating as is to be found in any part
of the world.
THE GEOLOGY OF QUEENSLAND.
Contributed by H. I. JENSEN, D.Sc.
HISTORICAL.
The earliest work on the Geology of Queensland
was carried out by men who bear an illustrious name
in the field of Science, amongst whom the Rev. W. B.
Clarke and Messrs. Samuel Stutchbury and Richard
Daintree are prominent. To these three famous
pioneers in the field of Australian geology Messrs. Jack
and Etheridge dedicated their well-known work on the
geology of Queensland.
Prior to the separation of Queensland from New
South Wales the Rev. William Branwhite Clarke,
F.R.S., was engaged by the Government of New South
Wales to examine the Moreton Bay and Darling Downs
districts, which now form part of the State of Queens-
land. He made extensive observations on the extinct
fauna of the Condamine, the trappean rocks of the
Darling Downs, and the auriferous drifts and crystalline
schists of various localities.
Mr. Samuel Stutchbury, F.G.S., a distinguished
scientist, was appointed Geologist of New South Wales
in 1850, and was employed mainly in those parts which
now belong to Queensland. Mr. Stutchbury remained
in the colony till 1855, when his failing health com-
pelled him to return to England. His quarterly reports
to the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales are
full of interest. He described the basaltic formations
of the Darling Downs, the Ipswich coal measures, the
Glasshouse Mountains, etc., and his last reports deal
with the Gladstone, Colinton, and Fitzroy districts.
After this no work of importance seems to have
been done until 1868, when Mr. D’Oyley H. Aplin and
Mr. Richard Daintree, C.M.G., were appointed Govern-
ment geologists. Mr. Daintree had already rendered
magnificent service in the Victorian geological survey.
Mr. Aplin left the Queensland service in 1869, after
making reports on the Gympie mineral field, the
D’Aguilar Range, Neurum, Delaney Creek, the Stanley
River country, Jimnah, Talgai, and the auriferous
country of the Upper Condamine. Mr. Daintree was
meanwhile employed in the northern districts, and up
to the time of his departure in 1871 he made reports
on the Cape diggings, the Gilbert goldfield, the
Rockhampton mining district, Ravenswood and Towers
goldfields, and many other general reports. Mr. Daintree
went to London in 1871 in charge of the Queensland
exhibit, and remained there in the position of Agent-
General for Queensland.
In 1875 the Hon. A. C. Gregory, C.M.G.,
F.R.G.S., already noted as a surveyor and explorer,
was appointed Government Geologist, and held the
appointment till 1879. He published a number of
papers full of geological and mining interest. After his
retirement from the service he entered political life,
and was until his death in 1905 a highly-respected
adviser and critic in the Queensland Legislative Council
on all matters affecting the pastoral and mining indus-
tries of the State.
In 1877 Mr. Robert Logan Jack, F.G.S., who had
ten years’ previous experience on the Geological Survey
of Scotland, was appointed Government Geologist, and
became head of the department after the retirement of
the Hon. A. C. Gregory. Mr. Jack remained in charge
of the geological survey until 1899, and during this long
period of service toured the entire colony and made
extensive observations. He correlated his own work
with that of his predecessors and assistants, and framed
a geological map of Queensland in sufficient detail to
form a fine groundwork for his successors to add to.
His work is far too extensive for one to attempt to give
even a brief outline in an article like this. Suffice to
say, Jack must be ranked as one of the pioneers, and,
in fact, the greatest of the pioneers, of Queensland
geology, distinguished alike as a field-worker, an
organizer of an efficient department, and an author.
In conjunction with Mr. Robert Etheridge, jun., he
compiled a “Geology of Queensland,” published in
1892. . Mr. Etheridge contributed the Palaeontology, a
branch of science in which he ranks as the foremost
worker in Australia. Though Mr. Jack’s geological
map of Queensland is in the course of revision, it has
been the foundation-stone on which all subsequent
geological work has been piled. It is a monument to
the industry, the comprehensive faculty of observation,
and sound judgment of its author.
In 1883 Mr. Wm. H. Rands, A.R.S.M., F.G.S.,
and in 1889 Mr. Andrew Gibb Maitland, F.G.S., were


appointed Government Geologists. On Mr. Jack’s
resignation in 1899 Mr. Rands became geologist in
charge. His work, too, was very extensive. In 1902
he retired to take up private practice. Mr. Gibb
Maitland left the Queensland State service in 1896,
when he was appointed Government Geologist of
Western Australia, a position he still holds.
Mr. B. Dunstan was appointed to the Queens-
land geological staff in 1897. On the retirement of Mr.
Rands he became the officer in charge, and to-day holds
the position of Chief Government Geologist. He has
gentlemen have been in the geological survey for shorter
periods, yet done notable work. The following are
their names, with the years of their appointment and
resignation: —Professor S. J. B. Skertchley, 1895
1897; Dr. J. M. Maclaren, 1900—1901; C. F. V.
Jackson, 1901—1903; E. O. Marks, 1908—1913. Mr.
Cameron entered the service in 1897. He has made
extensive researches on the mineral resources of the
State, particularly the Ipswich coal measures. Mr. L.
C. Ball, who entered the department in 1900, has also
been mostly engaged on economic geology. Most of his

also carried out extensive field-work, chiefly in the
Fitzroy and Gympie districts. His “Mineral Index of
Queensland” is a monument of patient work, and is a
book of reference which will be found of the utmost
value to all mine managers and geologists. Mr. Duns-
tan is now engaged on the revision of the geological
map of Queensland.
The scientific staff of geologists under Mr. Dunstan
includes Messrs. W. E. Cameron, 8.A., F.G.S.,
L. C. Ball, 8.E., F.G.S., E. C. Saint Smith, F.S.T.C.,
F.G.S., and J. H. Reid, A.S.T.C. Several other
geological survey work has been done in the northern
mineral districts of the State, and has been of much
importance .to the metal-mining industry. Mr. Saint
Smith was appointed to the staff in 1913, and has
done good work on the geological survey of the artesian
basin. Mr. Reid, appointed in 1914, has been engaged
on the closer investigation of the Charters Towers gold-
field.
Very little geological work has been done by men
outside the Department, principally because imtil 1909
Queensland lacked a University from which advanced


students would spread out and undertake independent
researches. Now that defect has been remedied and
soon we may expect to see an energetic band of
geological workers from our young University who will
supplement the official work of the Government
geologists.
The principal researches made by men not in the
geological survey are those of H. I. Jensen, D.Sc.,
on the alkaline rocks of Southern Queensland; of Mr.
R. A. Wearne, 8.A., on the coal measures and volcanic
rocks of the Fassifern and Ipswich districts; and the
work of Dr. Richards on the volcanic rocks of south-
eastern Queensland.
One cannot leave this historical summary without
making mention of The Queensland Government Mining
Journal, the finest publication of its kind in Australia.
It is edited by Mr. Walter J. Morley, and is always
full of scientific and mining news of interest.
PHYSIOGRAPHY.
As Professor J. W. Gregory has neatly remarked,
the geographic structure of Queensland is a direct
expression of its geological nature. Geographically,
Queensland consists of three divisions, the first of which
is the mountainous stretch of Eastern Queensland that
approximates or borders the sea from the MacPherson
Range, on the New South Wales boundary, to Cape
York. This division is called the Queensland Highlands,
and consists of a variety of rock formations ranging
from highly crystalline rocks, some probably as old as
Archaean, through metamorphosed palaeozoic sedimentary
recks, and very slightly altered Mesozoic sedimentary
formations to Tertiary lavas, and but slightly consoli-
dated late Tertiary beds. The highlands constitute the
remains of a plateau which in former geological epochs
extended much further eastwards in the direction of
New Caledonia. Herein lies their geographical unity.
The area constituting this plateau was peneplained in
late Cretaceous or early Tertiary time, but the exact
geological age has not been determined. However, it
is certain that in late Miocene time the upward warping
of this peneplain commenced. The main uplift was,
however, in post-Miocene times, and was followed in
Pleistocene times by block-faulting, trough-faulting,
and extensive volcanic eruptions. Simultaneously the
dissection of the uplifted peneplain or plateau pro-
ceeded by the agency of subaerial denudation, and
several of the eastern portions of the continent subsided
beneath the sea through severe faulting.
The second geographical division of Queensland is
that of the Central Plains, or Great Plains, stretching
westwards from the base of the Eastern Highlands, and
consisting mainly of Cretaceous rocks belonging to the
Rolling Downs formation. This formation, which is
regarded as Lower Cretaceous, is capped in places by
outliers of the Upper Cretaceous desert sandstone, and
in other places by Tertiary marls and clays, many of
which contain Pliocene and Pleistocene fossil remains.
The Great Central Plains, which constitute about two-
thirds of the area of Queensland, formed a sea in early
Cretaceous times, the period of deposition of the Rolling
Downs. In the Upper Cretaceous the sea dried up and
became a series of lakes, some of which persisted into
late Tertiary times, and round the shores of which
sported giant marsupials and crocodiles. Increasing
aridity caused their complete disappearance. The Great
Plains division of Queensland is also important as being
the artesian area. The existence of subterranean water
supplies in the Cretaceous and underlying Triassic is of
the utmost importance to this area, as otherwise heavy
stocking of the country would be out of the question.
The third division consists of a projecting portion
of the Central Australian Plateau. This division con-
sists of Archaean and Pre-Cambrian crystalline rocks,
together with Cambrian limestones. It stretches from
the vicinity of Cloncurry and Mount Oxide in a south-
south-west direction towards Lake Eyre, and includes
the metalliferous rocks of the Cloncurry district and the
fine pastoral limestone country of the Barkly Tablelands.
There is no evidence of this area having been submerged
since the Cambrian period, but it shared in the pene-
plaination of the late Cretaceous or early Tertiary
period, and a disintegrated drainage led to the forma-
tion of isolated lakes from the silts and marls of which
Tertiary shells have been recorded.
The Highlands.—The Eastern Highlands, as already
stated, owe their relief to the Tertiary uplift of a great
peneplain and their varied scenery to faulting and rock
sculpture by stream-action. In the extreme south we
find Tertiary lavas disseminated over a wide area. The
MacPherson Range, on the New South Wales border,
owes its rugged escarpments and wild beauty to the
resistance to weathering influences of the acid trachyte
and rhyolite lavas. Here and there basaltic flows occur
as well, as for instance at Tweed Heads, yielding rich
chocolate soils, which under coastal climatic conditions
support a luxuriant scrub vegetation. Tambourine
Mountain, on the Coomera River, is the remnant of a
basaltic volcano. The Springbrook Plateau, the Coomera
Ranges, and, in fact, most of the country between the
Brisbane River and the MacPherson Range contains
remains of the huge lava flows—first acid-alkaline, later
basics—which have burst through the Triassic and
Jurassic sedimentary rocks of the region. West of this
area we have the Main Range and the Little Liverpool
Range, in both of which the earlier and alkaline
and later basic lavas, bursting through the Mesozoic
sandstones, have variegated the scenery and yielded
fertile soils. At Fassifern and at Mount Flinders, near
Ipswich, as well as on various points in the Main


Range, the trachyte intrusions rise as huge monoliths
out of the coal-measure plain. Around Brisbane the
principal heights are composed of very ancient crystal-
line schists, which are thought by many geologists to
be of the Pre-Cambrian age (Mount Coot-tha). Further
north we have the D’Aguilar Range, composed partly,
as at Mount Mee,
of ancient crys-
talline schists,
including glauco-
phane - epidote
schist, antho-
phyllite schist,
mica schists,
and hornblende
schists, capped in
places with Ter-
tiary basalt, in
part of graphic
granites and nor-
mal hornblende
biotite granite,
in part of Trias-
sic or Jurassic
sandstones, with
alkaline trachyte
dykes. Evidence
of faulting with
downthrow to the
east exists in
several places on
the eastern flank
of the D’Aguilar
Range. East of
the D’Aguilar
Range the trac-
hytic monoliths
of the Glass-
house Mountains
rise like towers
out of the nar-
row coastal plain.
The D’Aguilar
Range forms the
eastern rim of a
tableland region
partly composed
of ancient crys-
talline and granitic rocks, partly of Mesozoic sedi-
mentaries, with isolated volcanic cappings, which again
is flanked on the west by the basaltic range of the
Bunya Mountains. This tableland is the Stanley
River Tableland, forming good pastoral and agricul-
tural country. Further north the Jimnah country,
the Conandale Range, the Yabba Ranges, and other
ranges extending north to the latitude of Maryborough,
consist of the same heterogeneous medley of formations
as the I)’Aguilar Range and the Stanley River or Wood-
ford Tableland. A more eastward range, the Blackall,
consists essentially of trachytic and basaltic rocks, the
latter being by far the most extensive in area, form-
ing the later
flows. From the
narrow coastal
plain east of
Blackall Range
rise more mono-
lithic mountains
similar to the
Glasshouses, and
also of alkaline
trachyte forma-
tion, such as
Eerwah, Tinbeer-
wah, Coolum,
Cooroy, Cooran,
and Cooroora
heights.
The remarks
already made
about the south-
ern portion of
the Eastern
Highlands show
that this division
consists of a
series of parallel
and subparallel
ranges and table-
lands joined at
intervals by
spurs. The same
type of structure
continues right
up to Cape York.
The Main Divid-
ing range is more
imaginary than
real, being
merely the high-
est part of the
Eastern High-
lands forming
the divide between east and west flowing streams.
North of the Conandale Range, in the Mary Valley, we
get the true Permo-Carboniferous or Gympie rocks
entering more and more into the composition of the
Eastern Highlands. They commence to divide the
Mesozoic formations into two strips, one of which
follows the sea coast, the other the eastern border of
BARRON GORGE, NORTHERN QUEENSLAND.


the Great Plains. The Burnett Range, Dawes Range,
Broadsound Range, and many other ranges between the
Mary River and Port Mackay, are composed largely, if
not mainly, of Gympie rocks. In the Dawson and
Fitzroy River basins true Carboniferous rocks, belonging
to the Star series, cover a wide area, while the Dawson
coal measures, which also occur in this area, are of
Permo-Carboniferous, Greta, age. The Bowen coal
measures, also of Permo-Carboniferous age, constitute
the dominant formation between the Denham Range
and the coast. In the drainage area of the Burdekin
River, Devonian rocks, chiefly limestones and con-
glomerates, aggregating 7,000 feet in thickness, consti-
tute a great bulk of the highlands. The massive
limestone formation of the Burdekin has been compared
to the Great Barrier Reef, and is regarded by some as
an ancestor of the Barrier Reef, for although in late
Tertiary times the Australian continent has lost
ground in north-eastern Queensland by subsidence
and through downthrows by faulting, the continent
in previous geological periods from the Cambrian to
the Permian grew from the south-west towards the
north-east.
North of Townsville the Eastern Highlands are
composed of crystalline schists, granites, slates, grey-
wackes, and other rocks partly of undetermined age
and partly of known age. Silurian rocks, consisting of
black “stinking” limestones, with Halysites, quartzite,
slate, and schist, are extensively represented in the
Chillagoe area. Probably most of the metamorphic
slates and schists of the Northern Queensland mineral
districts are of this age, though some may be as old as
Pre-Cambrian. Existing geological maps show most of
this country as Gympie. However, all recent geological
investigations tend to show that in Northern Queensland
the Carboniferous rocks are less metamorphosed than in
Southern Queensland, and exist principally as sand-
stone cappings and outliers, or in trough-faulted
subsidence areas, as in the Little River coalfield near
Cooktown. Throughout the eastern part of that portion
of the Queensland Highlands which fringes the coast
from Townsville to Cooktown basaltic extravasation has
flooded the country with basalt, which yields the best
banana and sugar country of the north. The Johnstone
River, Cairns-Barron River, and Atherton-scrub coun-
try is all basalt capped. The precipitous nature of the
coastline from Halifax Bay to Cape York suggests that
faulting has played an important part in shaping its
physical features.
The coastline of Queensland is one of the most
interesting coasts in the world, both in regard to
scenery and as a scientific study. The extreme south at
Tweed Pleads and Burleigh Heads is what is geologically
termed a Rtickland coast, which is characterized by the
absence of coastal plain and by the highlands advancing
right up to the sea shore. Such a coast is regarded as
indicating that a movement of subsidence has been
prevalent for some periods past. From Stradbroke
Island to Great Sandy Island a coastal plain, though
usually a narrow one, is developed. Such a coast is-
known as a Forland coast, and is indicative of recent
elevatory movement. That elevation has been in pro-
gress along this stretch of coast is corroborated by the-
occurrence of raised beaches in places (as at Point
Arkwright), the gradual reclamation of Bribie Passage-
by natural agencies, the conversion of old-time marine
inlets and baylike lakes in open communication with,
the sea into, first, freshwater lakes, and later into
swamps (a process almost completed opposite Moreton
Bay, and still in progress at Laguna Bay), the formation
of huge sand dunes at Noosa Lakes, and other interest-
ing features.
From Great Sandy Island to Cape York the entire
coastline is a Rtickland coast. The former extension of
the mainland into what is now the Pacific Ocean is
proved by the submarine continuation for great distances
into the sea of many of the existing river valleys of
Northern Queensland. Besides the evidence of the-
drowned river valleys, the subsidence movement is also-
proved by the existence for 1,200 miles along the
Queensland coast of that wonderful reef of growing;
coral, capping dead coral rock, which is known as the
Great Barrier Reef. The Northern Queensland coast
is characterized by the mountains reaching to the very
shore, frequently with the development of great scarps.-
Many of these suggest that strong faulting movements
have aided the slower folding movements in accomplish-
ing the subsidence. Clear evidence of faulting having
O O O
played an important part in the breaking up of the
Eastern Highlands is obtained in the Bowen coalfield,
where the Middle Bowen beds have been let down by a
north-west-south-east fault against three groups of older
beds —namely, the volcanic rocks of the Toussaint
Range, the old schists and granites of the Clarke Range,
and the Lower Bowen Series on the flanks of the
Broadsound Range.
The soils and timbers in the Eastern Highlands
vary widely in accordance with the variations in
geological formation. The silicious rocks, sandstones,
granites, and rhyolites yield poor sandy soils, with open
hardwood forest chiefly composed of eucalypt species.
On the shallow and stony, yet chemically richer, slate
and schist soils the flora ranges from the open forest to
the “bastard” scrub type, while on rich basaltic and
alluvial soils dense jungle is usually found, in which
the softwoods flourish and the cedar, bunya pine, kauri
pine, and hoop pine are matted together with lawyer
canes and other vines. Vast areas of basaltic scrub
land, both in the south as on the Blackall Range, and
in the north as at Atherton, are now under cultivation


with sugar, bananas, and other crops, or sown with
paspalum for dairying purposes.
The Central Plains. —The great plains of Queens-
land are mostly unforested hut for belts of timber along
the watercourses, largely groves of gidyea and mulga.
The semi-arid to arid conditions of climate result in the
maintenance of a rich soil, as the leaching processes
which operate in the Eastern Highlands almost fail
here. Not only are the fertilizing ingredients preserved
in the soil, but the removal of rock waste proceeds so
slowly tin t the soils attain great thickness. As already
stated, this division comprises about two-thirds of the
The entire Queensland coastline bordering on the
Gulf of Carpentaria has recently undergone and is
perhaps still undergoing uplift, a continuation of that
Tertiary elevation which has transformed the Cretaceous
s 6a — all Australian Mediterranean Sea—into dry land.
It must be remembered that most of the Great Plains
division was beneath the sea from early Triassic to late
Cretaceous times.
Our Rolling Downs is to all intents and purposes
synonymous with our artesian basin. The age of the
water-bearing horizons is still a somewhat doubtful
question. Scientific men tend to differentiate into
LIMESTONE FORNATION, “TOWER OF LONDON,” CHILLAGOE DISTRICT, NORTHERN QUEENSLAND.
State, and owing to its deep, fertile soils and abundant
supplies of artesian water constitutes the cornucopia of
Queensland. The bulk of the area is built up of
Cretaceous strata, with patches of overlying Pliocene
and Pleistocene formation, yet the northern end of the
Great Plains bordering on the Gulf of Carpentaria,
known as the Plains of Promise, is constituted of
Tertiary estuarine and marine deposits, the result of
recent elevation, while the extreme south-eastern por-
tion, the Darling Downs, is largely black-soil plain of
Tertiary volcanic origin.
parties and groups, or schools. Thus in the case of
the artesian problem Messrs. Jack and Rands regarded
the Rolling Downs as the water-bearing beds and the
Blythesdale Braystone as the intake; while Pittman
assigned the artesian water almost wholly to the Trias
Jura, while the later researches of Mr. Dunstan and
his staff favour the view that our artesian waters are
confined in Upper Jurassic rocks. Likewise, as regards
the origin of artesian water, opinion is divided. The
followers of Pittman still adhere to the view that our
artesian beds form a basin like the Artois and London


basins, into porous strata of which subaerial waters
percolate and rise when tapped by bores through
hydraulic pressure. They assume that the freshness of
the water is maintained by circulation movement in the
artesian waters, which are imagined, not without reason,
to have outlets into the Gulf of Carpentaria and the
Australian Bight. The other school is that of J. W.
Gregory, D.Sc. of Glasgow, some years ago Professor at
Melbourne University. His view is that our artesian
waters are of Plutonic origin, have their natural out-
lets in the mound springs, and are expelled when tapped
largely by gas and steam pressure. While Professor
Gregory has advocated the muzzling or closing of
artesian bores to avoid waste when the water is not
required, other adherents of the magmatic-water or
Plutonic theory, such as Symmonds and Jensen, are
decidedly against closing down bores on account of the
tendency for the waters under restraint to burst the
casing and escape laterally into dry strata.
While the majority of our Queensland artesian
waters come from Mesozoic strata, the Carboniferous
and Permo-Carboniferous strata of the Northern Terri-
tory at Borroloola have been proved artesian, and the
occurrence of Permo-Carboniferous fossils in the artesian
strata of Hughenden and other country north of the
Cloncurry line is gradually lending colour to the belief
that much of the Northern Queensland artesian water
may come from late Palaeozoic strata.
In two places in the Eastern Highlands is there
a wide break or col (geocol), which has the effect of
bringing inland climatic conditions almost out to the
coast. One is at Brisbane, the other at Burnett River.
In the latter case we also have the Rolling Downs
formation transgressing over the affected area. They
are here known as the Maryborough Beds.
The Central Australian Plateau.— This area has,
like the Great Plains, deep, unleached, fertile soils, but
climatic conditions tend to aridity. While very distinct
from the Great Plains in geological nature, the area is
physiographically very similar to the Great Plains,
except in belts of mineralized metamorphic slates and
schists, as at Cloncurry.
STRATIGRAPHICAL GEOLOGY.
In dealing with this subject it will be most con-
venient to commence with the oldest formations and
finish with the newest. A very old series of gneisses
and schists occurs in places, and probably underlies all
other formations. Daintree regarded them as Silurian
on account of lithological resemblance to the Silurian
rocks of Victoria. There is, however, no doubt now
that both these very old Queensland rocks, and those
of Victoria which they resembled, are much older,
probably Archaean in age.
ARCHAEAN AND PRE-CAMBRIAN.
The largest area of rocks in the State now assigned
to the Pre-Cambrian formations is the Queensland
portion of the Central Australian Plateau, including
the Cloncurry mineral field and a belt of country
stretching thence towards Lake Eyre. This area con-
sists of granites, amphibolites, mica schists, granulites,
and gneisses, and includes, as at Mount Leviathan, near
Cloncurry, some vast deposits of iron ore of good quality.
This area has been variously assigned to the Silurian,
Devonian, Carboniferous (Gympie), and other periods
by different geologists; but there is now no doubt that
these formations are an extension of the Pre-Cambrian
of the Northern Territory, and bear the same relation-
ship to the Cambrian limestones of the Barkly Table-
land.
Another Archaean area is that of the Charters
Towers and Cape goldfields. Here there is a lower
series of gneisses, mica schists, and hornblende schists,
and an upper series, a portion of which may be early
Palaeozoic, of quartzites, schists, and slates. According
to Rands, the Archaean series here is from five and a
half to six miles in thickness; the rocks strike west-
north-west, and are therefore discordant to the direction
of the Great Dividing Range.
A third area of very old metamorphic rocks is in
the Gilbert, Woolgar, and Etheridge goldfields. They
consist of schists intruded by dykes of diorite and quartz
porphyry. The strike of the rocks is from west to east.
A fourth occurrence of Pre-Cambrian types is on
the western flanks of the Clarke Range, south of Bowen.
The line of granite rocks of the main range are
bordered on the west by quartzites and schists, with an
altered schorl-bearing granite.
A fifth outcrop is on the Peak Downs near Cler-
mont, where the Pre-Cambrian series consists of mica
and hornblende schists, striking north-east-south-west.
A sixth exposure is in the D’Aguilar Range at
Mount Mee, and thence at intervals to Jimnah and the
Conandale Range. The rocks here consist of mica
schists, granulites, epidote-glaucophane schists, horn-
blende schists, gneisses, graphic granites, schorlaceous
granite, and numerous other varieties of crystalline
schist possessing lithological characters indicative of the
greatest antiquity.
The Brisbane schists have been assigned to various
ages by different geologists. The balance of evidence
is, however, in favour of a Pre-Cambrian age.
LOWER PALAEOZOIC.
Cambrian. —The limestones of the Barkly Table-
land, which extend from the Northern Territory across
the border into Queensland, have yielded Cambrian
trilobites and the pteropod Salterella.


Ordovician. —Rocks of this age have not yet been
determined in Queensland, though they may be present
in the metamorphic massifs of Cloncurry and the Cape
goldfield.
Silurian. —Eeceptaculites has been recorded from
Mount Wyatt, while Holy sites has been determined in
the Chillagoe limestones. Silurian rocks are, in the
writer’s opinion, far more widespread than generally
supposed. Halysites is exceedingly abundant in the
black limestones of Chillagoe, and was first discovered
there by the present writer in 1899.
south-west, and dij3 to the north-west, and are estimated
by Jack to attain a thickness of 20,000 feet, the lowest
8,000 feet of which, however, may be of Lower
Palaeozoic age.
Middle Devonian rocks also occur in the mountains
of the Red River crossed by the Northern railway; in
the neighbourhood of Clermont on the Central railway,
and in the Hunter and Marble Islands in the North-
umberland Group, where, says Professor Gregory,
Middle Devonian limestones strike from north to south
and are faulted against granite.
TRACHYTE FORMATION, TIBROGARGAN MOUNTAIN, GLASSHOUSE MOUNTAINS.
UPPER PALAEOZOIC.
The Upper Palaeozoic systems —Devonian, Carboni-
ferous, and Permo-Carboniferous —are well represented
in Queensland.
Devonian. —The chief development of Devonian
rocks is in the Burdekin basin, where the series extends
from Pentland to Gilberton, in a band sixty miles long
by thirty miles broad. The rocks consist of con-
glomerates at the base, passing upwards into massive
coral limestones, with abundant fossils of Middle
Devonian age. They strike from north-east to
Carboniferous. —The Gympie and Star series were
formerly regarded as Carboniferous, but more recent
investigations show more and more that the Gympie
beds can be divided into two groups, the lower of which
contains Lepidodendron australe, Phillipsia, and Anei-
mites, which are characteristic of the Carboniferous,
and the younger of which contains neither Lepidoden-
dron nor Phillipsia, but contains instead an abundant
fauna comparable with that of the Hunter River basin
in New South Wales—that is, of a typical Permo-
Carboniferous facies. The Gympie beds proper is the


lowest series of the Carboniferous. They consist of
slates, thin-bedded sandstones, impure limestones, coarse
conglomerates, and carbonaceous beds, in which occur
Protoretepora ampla, Fenestella, Froductus cora, and
other Carboniferous fossils. The gold of Gympie occurs
principally in the plumbago beds and conglomerates.
The Gympie rocks are traversed by dykes and sills of
pyritous andesite and diorite. The southern part of the
Gympie field is traversed by a series of cross faults
running east and west. At Broomfield occurs another
outcrop of Gympie rocks. It rests on granite to the
west, and is faulted to the east against the Burrum
series.
In the northern half of the Burnett district and
in the Wide Bay district, and thence to Broadsound,
Gympie rocks are largely developed. In the Wide
Bay district they are separated from the coast by
twenty to thirty miles of Burrum formation, but from
Port Curtis to Notch Point they occupy most of the
coastline. They occur between Eidsvold and Lochaber
as sandstones, slates, and quartzites, striking east and
west. In the Cania goldfield the Gympie age of a series
of sandstones, slates, and limestones has been deter-
mined by the presence of Froductus semireticulatus.
The slates and quartzites of the Raglan goldfield are
also considered Gympie, and strike north-south with a
westerly dip. Near Rockhampton a great fossiliferous
limestone series striking north-west has been deter-
mined to be of Gympie age. On the Calliope River
marble is developed in them.
In Northern Queensland Gympie rocks are probably
mainly present as cappings of shale and greywacke,
while the metalliferous metamorphic formations for-
merly regarded as Gympie are probably Silurian and
older.
The Star Series. —The beds of this series are best
developed in the basins of the Great and Little Star
Rivers, tributaries of the Upper Burdekin. They
consist of sandstones and shales, with Lepidcdendron
and some conglomerates, as well as marine limestones.
The most extensive outcrop of the Star series is on the
Belyando River, and extends southward through the
Drummond Range. Fossil fish occur in this area. The
rocks are folded into a synclinal trough, which is axially
crossed by the Central railway near Bogantungan. To
the west of the Drummond Range the Star beds dip
under the basic lavas of Buckland Tableland. Another
synclinal of the Star formation occurs at the junction
of the Suttor and Burdekin Rivers, south of Mount
McConnell. This basin, which trends north-east-south-
west, includes Mount Wyatt, which has yielded the
Silurian fossil, Eeceptaculites.
Per mo-Carboniferous. —Rocks of undoubted Permo-
Carboniferous age are incorporated with the Carboni-
ferous Gympie and Star beds in the highly-disturbed
and compressed area of the Gympie goldfield. Permo-
Carboniferous rocks have a wide extent in Queensland,
spreading over the Bowen and Dawson coalfields, and
occur at intervals as far north as Cocktown.
The Permo-Carboniferous rocks of Queensland are
known as the Bowen beds and are divided into three
divisions, the Lower, Middle, and Upper Bowen.
These are most typically developed in the Bowen coal-
field, between the Bowen and Dawson Rivers, and
including the Leichhardt and Denham Ranges.
The Lower Bowen formation occurs in the north-
eastern part of the field, and consists of two rock types.
The first is a series of altered volcanic rocks, typically
developed in the Toussaint Range, where they are cut
to the south by a fault that brings the schists of the
western flank of the Clarke Range into contact with
Middle Bowen beds. The other type of Lower Bowen
rocks is a series of sandstones and shales, which in
places, as on the Pioneer River, have been highly
altered. These beds strike meridionally, and reach
the coast at Cape Palmerston.
The Middle Bowen formation consists of terrestrial
beds with Glossopteris and interlaminated marine
beds with Froductus corn. They are developed on
the edge of the Bowen coalfield, the centre of
which consists principally of Upper Bowen beds. The
latter are full of Glossopteris, and contain numerous
coal seams.
The Permo-Carboniferous fossils of Gympie, as
well as those of the Lower Bowen beds, point to these
strata being of the same age as the Lower Marine of
New South Wales. The Dawson River coalfield con-
tains the thickest seams known in Australia. One
seam near Comet is 80 feet thick. About thirty miles
south of Duaringa occurs an anthracite seam 11 feet
thick. The area is, however, much faulted. At the
Little River, in the Cape York Peninsula, there is a
trough-faulted area of Permo-Carboniferous rock, in
which coal seams have been located. Professor David
estimates the available quantity of Permo-Carboniferous
coal in Queensland at 100,000,000,000 tons. The
Permo-Carboniferous coals of Queensland have been but
little worked up to the present, on account of transport
difficulties.
MESOZOIC FORMATIONS.
The Triassic rocks do not seem to be represented in
Queensland, unless they underlie in part the Cretaceous
Rolling Downs formation. The Ipswich coal measures
have been in recent years assigned to the Upper Jurassic
period on account of their fossil contents, particularly
on account of Tceniopteris daintreei, which is regarded
by Professor A. C. Seward as being characteristic of a
Lower Oolitic age. The Burrum beds, which were


formerly regarded as being lower than the Ipswich beds,
have now been definitely shown to belong to a later
period—namely, to the Lower Cretaceous.
The Ipswich series occupies 12,000 square miles in
the south-eastern corner of Queensland, and contains most
of the worked coal mines of the State. They commence
with a series of volcanic rocks, trachytes and trachytic
tuffs (the Brisbane tuffs), above which rests a thick
series of conglomerates, sandstones, shales, and grits,
with interbedded coals and fireclays. The same series
occurs at Stewart Creek, near Rockhampton, where
they contain coal seams, one of which is 26 feet
thick.
The Burrum beds are Lower Cretaceous, and also
contain workable coal seams, intercalated in marine
strata. They attain a total thickness of 3,000 feet.
The three or four workable coal seams attain a thickness
of from 3 to 4 feet, and the coal is a black, brittle,
bituminous coal. The beds
contain the fossils, Tricho-
manites laxum, Thinn-
feldia media, Tceniopteris
daintreei, Corhula bur-
rumensis, and Utocellaria
terra, regina. The Bur-
rum beds extend along the
eastern coast from Laguna
Bay to Fraser Island, and
stretch inland for thirty
miles. One outcrop, the
Styx River coalfield, situ-
ated at the south end
of Broadsound, is a long,
narrow, down-faulted
strip surrounded by Gym-
pie beds.
Gretaceou s. —The
Lower Cretacious (Rolling
Downs) covers a great portion of Central Queensland.
The Ipswich beds seem to pass conformably into the
Rolling Downs. Gypsum is found in great quantity in
the Lower Cretaceous. The Lower Cretaceous was
formed during a great transgression of the sea, which
affected three-quarters of the total area of Queensland.
During the Upper Cretaceous a negative movement of
the sea restored land conditions, though vast lacustrine
areas persisted far into the Tertiary period.
The Blythesdale Braystones were formerly con-
sidered to be the intake beds of the Artesian area. It
has, however, recently been shown that they are very
impervious, and, moreover, more and more evidence
accumulates to show that the water-bearing horizons
are in the Jurassic and Triassic which underlie the
Blythesdale Braystones. The most characteristic fossils
of the Lower Cretaceous are Maccoydla, Cytherea,
MOUNT LINDSAY, MACPHERSON RANGE, EASTERN SIDE.
On the border of New South Wales and Queensland. Height above sea level,
4,100 feet. Composed of a basaltic and andesitic base resting on coal measures, the
cap being made of acid volcanic agglomerate containing beautiful black pitchstone.
Crioceras, Lamna, Belonostomus, Notochelone, Noto-
chelone Ichthyosaurus, Plesiosaurus, Jhchna flindei s-
ensis, Ammonites, Foraminifera, etc. The formations
are chiefly loosely cemented sandstones and claystones.
The Burrum beds, as already mentioned, belong to the
Lower Cretaceous.
The Upper Cretaceous (Desert Sandstone) consists
at the base of marine beds, with belemnites, Macco-
yella, and the sea-urchin, Micraster sweeti, from the
Maryborough beds near Maryborough, and Rhynconella
croydonensis in the Croydon beds. Leda elongata and
Avicula alata have been obtained from a patch of the
Maryborough beds, thirty-two miles west of Bundaberg.
Ostrea and Hinnites have also been obtained in the
basal beds of the Desert Sandstone. The bulk of
the Desert Sandstone is, however, unfossiliferous,
and from its microscopic texture was regarded by
Tenison Woods, and still is regarded by most
geologists as being of
windblown origin. It is,
however, fairly certain that
the scattered patches of
desert sandstone rising
mesa-like from the Rolling
Downs are the remains of a
once-oontinuous sheet, and
their stratification suggests
deposition under water,
marine or lacustrine. It is
supposed by Professor Gre-
gory that the formation
accumulated during the
retreat of the ‘‘Rolling
Downs Sea." The desert
sandstone consists mostly
of coarse sandstone, pass-
ing in the arid regions
into quartzite and line
white shales, which pass superficially into porcellanite.
The latter in places contains valuable deposits of
precious opal, associated with curious concretions known
to the miners as fossil pineapples. These are composed
of common opal pseudomorphous after glauberite, and
often occur together with what are termed “buns of
barytes.”
Gibb Maitland reported trachytic tuffs interstrati-
fied with the lower beds of the desert sandstone near
Port Mackay. This being the only recorded instance
of contemporaneous volcanic activity in the Cretaceous
the matter merits further investigation.
Professor T. W. E. David in a paper has described
interesting forms of infusoria belonging to the
Tintinnoidce in a diatomaceous radiolarian earth inter-
bedded with marls in the Rolling Downs formation,
near Mitchell.
HISTORY OF QUEENSLAND : ITS PEOPLE AND INDUSTRIES.


CAINOZOIC ERA,
More and more evidence has recently been accumu-
lated by the Queensland Geological Survey, especially
by Mr. W. Cameron, that Tertiary beds are very wide-
spread in south-eastern Queensland, capping the
Jurassic. Hitherto, with the exception of Limestone
Hill, at Ipswich, these beds have been regarded as
Trias Jura. The closer study and survey of these
deposits will be of great value in determining the age
of the volcanic rocks of Southern Queensland, and may
also somewhat reduce the area over which occurrences
of coal beds can be expected.
The Plains of Promise round the shores of the Gulf
of Carpentaria consist largely of silts brought down by
the Gulf rivers in the Tertiary period. However, the
Tertiary deposits of greatest interest in Queensland are
the mammaliferous drifts down the western slopes of
the Great Dividing Range and Queensland Highlands,
as at the Condamine River. These deposits have often
been cut through by recent streams, and the bones are
frequently deeply buried, as on the Peak Downs, where
bones were found at a depth of 188 feet. The remains
occur in river silts, breccias, and indurated muds, and
are exceedingly abundant in certain areas, which prob-
ably were the banks of waterholes round which the
animals congregated in times of drought. Freshwater
molluscs occur plentifully in these drifts— e.g., Melania
pagoda, Melania area, Melania subimbricata, Limncea
rimosa, Physa truncata —together with teeth of Cera-
todus and bones of the crocodile Paliirnnarelms pollens.
The most important of the bones found are those of
Diprotodon, Nototherium, Macropus, Sceparnodon,
Thylaceoleo, Thylacinus, Sarcophilus, Canis dingo, Sus
papuensis, Megalania prisca, Meiolania, etc. Professor
David regards these- drifts as synchronous with the
Pluviatile period of Kosciusko, which would be Pleisto-
cene and late Pliocene.
Bone caves occur in various parts of Queensland.
They are abundant in the Chillagoe limestones. The
bones are mostly the remains of marsupials, dingos, and
squirrels.
Raised beaches of late Tertiary age and kitchen
middens of the Post-Tertiary age occur on the coast.
Indications have been noticed of a raised beach 50 feet
above sea-level at Point Arkwright, while raised beaches
up to 15 feet above sea-level are of so general occurrence
as to suggest a recent negative movement of the sea,
connected in some way with the accumulation of the
Antarctic ice-sheet. The shores of the Gulf of Car-
pentaria have undergone a greater elevation, which is
still in progress. Patches of Post-Tertiary limestone
containing fossilized remains of Helix occur west of
Cloncurry. Another Tertiary and Post-Tertiary forma-
tion is that of the Great Barrier Reef and its numerous
islets.
IGNEOUS ROCKS.
A. Plutonic. —Altered granites, gneisses, horn-
blendites, epidiorites, and other highly-altered igneous
rocks, ranging from acid to basic, occur in the Pre-
Cambrian or Archaean formations of the Cloncurry
massive, as well as the D’Aguilar Range. The so-called
“metamorphic” granites of Pentland Hills, and between
Charters Towers and Ravenswood, as well as the horn-
blendic granites of Croydon, may be of Archaean age.
Most of the other granites of Queensland intrude the
Carboniferous, and are hence of Post-Carboniferous age.
As, however, large areas formerly assigned to the
Carboniferous, such as, for instance, the Chillagoe beds,
are now regarded as Silurian or even older, many of
the granites formerly thought Post-Carboniferous must
now be regarded as of the more indefinite Post-Silurian
age. That is the case in particular with the Cloncurry,
Herberton, Mareeba, and Chillagoe granites. The
quartz porphyrites near Townsville were intruded into
Glossopteris beds, hence are definitely Post-Carbonifer-
ous. The porphyries and porphyrites south of Laguna
Bay, between the Noosa Lakes and the Maroochy River,
are definitely Post-Jurassic, having cut through and tilted
the Ipswich coal measures in that vicinity. Mount Cooroy
consists largely of particularly interesting monzonite.
Llypabyssal and Volcanic Rocks. —The altered
lavas of the Toussaint Range in the Bowen district are
of Lower Bowen age. Lava beds no doubt occur in
still older Palaeozoic formations, but they have been so
metamorphosed that their origin is uncertain. In the
Triassic, or, rather, Jurassic, of the Ipswich coal
measures we have at the very base the volcanic forma-
tions variously known as the Brisbane tuffs. These con-
sist of tuffs and breccias, resting on the ancient Brisbane
schists, and overlain by the Ipswich coal measures. A few
sheets of basalt are recorded as being interbedded in
the Ipswich beds on the Darling Downs, but they are
doubtful, as they may possibly represent sills. In the
Cretaceous no volcanic rocks are known except the
doubtful instance of trachytic tuffs near the base of the
series at Port Mackay.
The great bulk of our volcanic and hypabyssal
rocks belong to the Tertiary. Groups of trachyte and
alkaline rhyolite stocks and necks occur at intervals
from the New South Wales border to Port Mackay,
including the volcanic necks of the MacPherson Range,
Main Range, Fassifern, Mount Flinders, the Glass-
house Mountains, the Yandina Group, the Cooroora
Group, the Springsure necks, the Yeppoon necks and
hills, etc., etc. Dykes belonging to the same series are
abundant in the Jurassic formations of the D’Aguilar
Range. These alkaline rocks are now regarded as
Upper Miocene or Lower Pliocene in age. The alkaline
eruptions were followed by a great extravasation of
andesitic and basaltic lava, accompanied in some places


(as on the Springbrook Plateau and the north end of
the Blackall Range) by rhyolites. The remains of these
basalt sheets remain as larger stretches on the Darling
Downs, Blackall Range, Bunya Mountains, etc., and
as more isolated cones in other places, as, for instance,
Tambourine Mountain, Buderim Mountain, etc.
In North Queensland great outpourings of basalt
also occurred, and the eruptions probably lasted there
into very late Pleistocene times, as hinted by the
persistence of hot springs in the Herberton district and
the perfect preservation of craters in that vicinity.
The andesitic outpourings probably took place in
the Middle Pliocene and the basaltic eruptions in Late
Pliocene, lasting in Northern Queensland into the
Pleistocene.
MINING GEOLOGY.
Queensland possesses practically every metalliferous
mineral of commercial value—gold, silver lead, copper,
tin, zinc, tungsten, molyb-
denum, etc., are all repre-
sented in the native state
or in combination as ores.
Most of these metallic
minerals occur in the
Palaeozoic or Archaean
rocks. Only in a few in-
stances, as at Noosa Head
and Mount Boppy, do w v e
get the metals in later
rocks, as the result of
Late Mesozoic granitic
intrusions.
Gold. —This metal may
occur in rocks of all ages,
but except in the alluvial
form it is generally confined
to the highly-metamorphosed Palaeozoic formations. At
Croydon and Charters Towers gold occurs in Archaean
or Pre-Cambrian granites, and to some extent in asso-
ciated schistose rocks. On the Woolgar-Etheridge field
the auriferous rocks are probably also of Pre-Cambrian
age. In the Chillagoe-Tate-Herberton district the
auriferous rocks are probably of Silurian age, and the
gold was introduced with the Post-Silurian granite
intrusions. At Gympie the auriferous beds are Permo-
Carboniferous age, and the gold was probably intro-
duced with the dioritic intrusions of Post-Permian
age.
Silver Lead. —Argentiferous galena occurs in the
Silver Spur district, near Stanthorpe, in metamorphic
rocks of Permo-Carboniferous age. In the Herberton-
Chillagoe district the silver lead occurs in Silurian rocks.
Tin occurs in Older Palaeozoic at Stanthorpe, Iler-
berton (Silurian?), and Croydon (Pre-Cambrian)
districts.
GREAT BARRIER REEF AT LOW TIDE, SHOWING BECHE-DE-MER.
NORTHERN QUEENSLAND.
Wolfram and Molybdenite occur in the same
formations as tin in the Herberton - Irvinebank
district.
Copper occurs in Pre-Cambrian formations of the
Cloncurry district, in the Silurian of the Chillagoe-
Mungana district, and in the Carboniferous, together
with mercury and gold, in the Kilkivan district. At
Mount Morgan gold and copper occur together in a
reck which is a silicious sinter, and by some is supposed
to be a geyser deposit.
Coal.—Oi all the economic minerals of Queensland
coal is perhaps the most important. This State has
Carboniferous, Permo-Carboniferous, Jurassic, and
Cretaceous coal beds of workable size. The best coals
are the Dawson River coals, but the development of
this vast coalfield can hardly said to be commenced.
The Ipswich and Burrum coals are brittle and bitumin-
ous, but these fields are worked, being easily accessible
and on the main trunk
lines of the State.
Oped is another min-
eral of economic import-
ance to the State of
Queensland. Minute
grains of precious opal
occur in cavities of
amygdaloidal trachytes
and basalts in the East
Moreton district, but the
workable deposits are
segregations in veins in
the desert sandstones, as
at Kidston and Opalton.
Mining is dealt with
elsewhere in this work.
ARTESIAN WATER.
Queensland has the largest extent of artesian basin
cf any State in Australia. It has also the bores with
the greatest flows. The water, containing a noticeable
percentage of soda salts, is unsuited for irrigation, but
is excellent for watering stock.
The artesian region being covered largely by Ter-
tiary loams and clays is exceedingly fertile and decked
with rich herbage. Forest trees are often rare or
altogether absent over large istretches, owing to the
seeds not germinating in the somewhat alkaline soils of
our great plains.
The artesian area is fringed with mound and mud
springs which, according to the supporters of the
Plutonic origin, afforded an outlet for the surplus
waters. This notion is rather strongly supported by
the fact that since the artesian basin was tapped by
bores the mound springs have in many localities
dried up.


THE FAUNA OF QUEENSLAND.
The fauna of Queensland presents a rich storehouse
for investigation by the biologist in search of facts
relating to the long dead progenitors of types now
extant in other lands. This is true not only of the north-
eastern corner of the continent, but indeed of the whole
Commonwealth, including Tasmania. But the coastal
regions of Queensland have been more prolific in main-
taining life, both vegetable and animal, than has any
other similar-sized area of Australia; and Queensland
yields some of the most interesting evidence of how the
flora and fauna of a long remote joeriod poured down
to the south across what now is Torres Straits
and other waterways separating us from Asia, but
which, in another age, were but parts of a land
connection.
Hence it is that the marsupial is found in America
as well as in Australia. Everywhere else this form of
life has been long since extinct. Little is known of its
ancient history, though strong evidence points to its
having an enormously lengthy career on earth. Traces
of marsupials have been discovered in European deposits
of great geological antiquity, dating from a time
before the forces of natural selection had evolved
mammals of a higher type. The marsupial found its
way into Australia, which was afterwards divided from
the continents to the north by the subsidence of land.
In Europe and elsewhere the operation of the law of
the survival of the fit” brought on to earth more virile
species than the pouched animal which so long had held
supremacy. The old type gave way before the new and
powerful competitors for the means of subsistence. But
the animals of prey and other modern creatures could not
extend into the southern continent because of the
geographical isolation of the latter. And in Australia
itself the same evolutionary forces were not at work as
in countries of a more prolific flora and different climate.
The marsupial remained in possession; and some,
isolated from the rest of the world when the southern
continent came to be cut off, not only ceased to
advance in organic development but actually receded
biologically. This was taking place with the human
species in Queensland before the land was settled by men
of a superior race. Also it occurred with marsupials,
as well as with other species. Certainly the marsupials
had actually fallen into decay. The few opossums
discovered in America may be regarded as a variety
adapted to fit some corner in the environment of that
country. The general sweep forward of biological
evolution had engulfed their related species all round
in common annihilation; but the opossums had escaped
almost by an accident, as it were, because of special
adaptation to meet certain of the difficulties of life
prevailing in that locality. But in Australia the
marsupial reigned supreme from sheer lack of competi-
tion, and because something in the character of the
environment had failed to evolve the family on to a
higher biological plane.
Of the links of land connecting the fauna of
Australia in general and Queensland in particular with
the outside world the last to disappear was that between
Cape York Peninsula and Papua. Hence it is that many
species are common to both the latter-named island and
Queensland. Among these are the tree-climbing
kangaroo and the cassowary, a great wingless bird,
confined, so far as this continent is concerned,
to one spot in the northern coast of Queensland,
and which is to be met with in many places in
the islands of the Papuan group. The cassowary and
the emu descended from a common ancestor which was
contemporary with the moa, at a period much earlier
than that at which the first traces of the latter giant
creature were left in New Zealand. Bower birds and
birds of paradise are found both in Queensland and
Papua; whilst the native pigeons of this country have
sprung from Papuan stock.
In an article dealing with the natural history of
Queensland, Mr. C. W. de Vis, M.A., one time curator
of the Brisbane Museum, sets out five fundamental
facts relating to the fauna of the State. They are
as follow:
(1) The fauna of Australia at large is concentrated
to a marked degree in the north-eastern
corner of the continent, Queensland to wit.
(2) The Queensland fauna includes also animals
intimately related to those of New Guinea,
some of them incapable of passing the straits,
e.g., tree-climbing kangaroos, cassowaries;
also marine rangers from the western tropics,
e.g., crocodile, dugong, great sea perch; also
fresh-water fish represented elsewhere only
in Africa and America, e.g., ceratodus,
osteoglossum; also animals peculiar to
itself.
(3) The old fauna of Queensland now extinct was
far more extensive and vigorous than the
present one.
(4) It contained at least one animal, a ground bird
now restricted to New Guinea (Papuan)
jungles (crowned pigeon), and a flightless
bird (moa) peculiar to New Zealand.
(5) Individuals of two kinds of fresh-water fish
(Murray cod, ceratodus) are in the south
found together living or extinct in two
distinct drainage areas separated by moun-
tain ranges.


There would appear to be little doubt that, before
Torres Straits separated Cape York from Papua, the
climate of the north-eastern portion of the continent
was considerably hotter than it is now, and the general
conditions accelerated a more virile and prolific growth
of both animals and plants than do those now prevailing,
vigorous as is the life of the coastal regions of the present
day. A brief review of the geological history of the
continent thus becomes necessary as a first step in the
study of either the flora or fauna of Queensland, or
indeed of any part of Australia. The mainland of the
Commonwealth, Tasmania, and New Zealand now are
separate islands, the latter being divided from either of
the two by some 1,700 miles of rolling ocean. But in a
remote period these lands were more or less directly
connected by land with Asia and South America, and
consequently with one another. The accompanying map,
which shows the ocean depths as over and under 1,500
fathoms, clearly in-
dicates the bound-
aries of the now
sunken links bind-
ing the southern
lands with the
north and the
east. By means of
these connections
the progenitors of
the existing and
extinct Australian
species first made
their way. Thus
we find the basis
of the fauna of
the country. Geol-
ogists are able to
afford information
regarding the period when these vanished isthmuses were
above sea level, for crystalline rocks occur in Fiji and
clay slates in the Marquesas group; and such rocks do
not appear in islands which have never formed part of
a continental mass. During the Palseozoic period there
was assuredly a large continent stretching from Asia
across the South Pacific Ocean, but at the close of that
period a big climatic change occurred over a large part
of the Southern Hemisphere. All the southern part of
Australia went through a severe glacial epoch, the
evidences of which are still to be distinctly seen in the
North-Western Division of Western Australia in the
Irwin River basin of that State, on Kangaroo Island and
the shores of Gulf St. Vincent in South Australia, and
at Bacchus Marsh in Victoria. During the Mesozoic,
which succeeded, the configuration of land and sea
within and around the continent became substantially
that which it now is.
OCEAN DEPTHS AROUND AUSTRALASIA.
The shaded portion is deeper than 1,500 fathoms.
While the old connection with Asia, and probably
South America, lasted, Australia and New Zealand
received the ancestral types of the present native fauna,
together with those of many of the species now extinct.
At one stage of the history of the earth reptilian forms
of life dominated the surface of the globe. Huge
creatures, resembling gigantic lizards, sometimes a
hundred feet in length, roamed through mighty forests;
whilst some of the large reptiles were armed with wings
and passed through the air. All species of this kind had
long since disappeared many ages before the advent of
man. The reptilian forms of life had passed their prime
before the migration of life into the southern continent;
and the birds of the air had reached to a high state of
development, whilst mammals had begun to put in an
appearance. The first of these latter were of low
organism and laid eggs. They were the Prototheria,
a division long since extinct in all other parts of the
globe, but sur-
viving in Australia
in tbe form of the
platypus and the
echidna. The lat-
ter is popularly
known as the
"native porcupine,”
though in reality
it is in no way
related to the true
porcupine. The
Metatheria (which
is a more highly-
developed division
of mammalia, and
brings forth its
young in a partially-
developed form, and
nourishes them at breasts encased in a marsupia or
“pouch” until completely developed) were extensively
spread over the world during the Tertiary period. But,
as mentioned already in this article, the Metatheria, or
marsupials, are extinct everywhere except in the Aus-
tralasian region and America, existing in the latter only
in the form of a few opossums. After the arrival of the
marsupials Australia became an island. New Zealand
had been separated at an earlier period, apparently
about the time of the greatest bird development.
Tasmania, Kangaroo Island, and other adjacent islands
remained part of Australia until comparatively recent
times. Except for bats, rats, and mice, whose means for
dispersal over wide areas and across seas are quite
exceptional, none of the Eutheria, or true placental
mammalia, ever reached Australia until introduced by
man. How the dingo arrived at these shores has never
been made clear; but the species is a near relation


to the dhole of India, and no doubt exists of the dingo
having been brought to the continent at no very
remote date.
The marsupials of Australia have descended from
some giant forms, of which the only knowledge is
derived from fossil remains. There was the diprotodon,
a kind of wombat larger than a rhinoceros, the casts
of whose complete skeleton are now in the principal
Australian museums. There was the Nototherium, an
animal as big as and in some respects resembling the
tapirs, a kangaroo standing about twelve feet high.
These species were vegetable feeders; but remains of
large extinct carnivora have also been found. One of
the latter has been named the Thylacoleo, because it is
supposed to have been a kind of pouched lion. The
Thylacinus or “pouched hyena” and the Sarcophilus or
“devil” are two species which survive now only in
Tasmania, but existed on the mainland contemporan-
eously with the gigantic creatures already referred to.
There were also struthious birds, allied to the moa
of New Zealand, and as large as an ostrich, whose
skeletons have been recovered along with the diprotodon
in the dried-up lakes of the swamps of the Lake Eyre
basin. Enormous alligators roamed far to the south of
the tropics, and a land lizard (Megalania) very nearly
akin to the present-day “goanna,” but upwards of
twenty feet in length, was the terror of the dry-land
creatures of the time. Giant turtles and huge tortoises
also appear in the life of this ancient period. As part
of the present-day fauna, including some varieties of
frogs, have their closest affinities now in South America,
it would seem that their ancestors came here while the
now submerged South Pacific continent reached as far
east as Patagonia.
Climatic and geographical changes which caused the
extinction of the diprotodon and his congeners, leaving
only their fossil remains distributed from Cape Leeuwin
to the Gulf of Carpentaria, must be held to have exer-
cised the influence accountable for the distribution of
the present fauna as now observed in each of the
Australian States. That fauna which is isolated from
the rest of the world will still compete within itself for
advantages in the battle for existence. A difference in
climate, of food supply, or predacious foes must neces-
sarily lead to modifications of form and habit to contend
with such change, or, in the alternative, must bring
extinction.
The predominating point of interest in the action
of the environment of Australia upon the fauna of the
country lies in the absence of biological progress on the
part of the various species. Owing to obscure causes,
species long since extinct elsewhere, and to be studied in
other countries only through such evidence as fossil
remains render available, have here stayed unchanged
through countless ages. The strenuous struggle for
existence elsewhere has evolved the tiger and the lion,
specially adapted to spring upon and quickly vanquish
their prey; the nimble deer, fitted to leap swiftly from
the movement of a bush in which may lurk some hidden
and hungry beast of prey; the giraffe, long-necked and
thus able to survive because of being able to reach the
tender leaves of trees beyond the reach of less favour-
ably formed competitors; and various other species each
possessing some advantage in a peculiar adajDtation of
frame or constitution. In countries where the conditions
are more favourable than they have been in Australia
for supporting a teeming animal life, species have more
rapidly and distinctly evolved special properties yielding
them specific advantages in contending against other
species. But on the island continent, and more par-
ticularly over the great interior where a scanty and
fluctuating rainfall has rendered the food sujiply scarce
and uncertain, strife between animals has not been
sufficiently keen to have similarly evolved capacity for
warfare or for competition as between species and species
or between individual and individual. Animal life has
been scattered sparsely over immense tracts of land;
and the force tending to eliminate any particular type
has not been so much the competition of another type
as it has been the failure of means of subsistence.
Probably the pouched kangaroo, with its propensities
for carrying its young long distances, and the swift-
running emu have been able to escape from the ravages
of prolonged droughts better than the more highly
evolved but less mobile beasts of prey belonging to the
jungles of India and the mighty forests of central Africa
or the impenetrable woods of American river basins.
Only where rainfall is heavy and the flora luxurious in
the comparatively limited coastal areas of the continent
has animal life been plentiful in the same sense as it is
plentiful in other continents; and here alone is the
zoology equally complex and containing a proportion of
flesh-eating species, as, for instance, the crocodiles of
Queensland and the devils of Tasmania, the dingo, of
course, having been a recent importation from other
lands, and therefore not being typical of the rest of the
fauna of the continent.
MARSUPIALS.
The greater part of the Queensland mammalian
fauna consists of marsupials, a class of animals not
discovered alive in any part of the world, except being
met with in the form of the opossums in America, until
found in Australia. No family of Australian marsupial
life is entirely absent from the north-eastern State.
Some of these consist in vegetable-eating species; whilst
others, such as the native cat, are carnivorous.
Kangaroos are still plentiful over most of Queensland,
but the larger types have already been driven to some
distance from the centres of population and settlement.


The kangaroos of Queensland are divided into a
number of varieties, ranging in size from the great
“old man kangaroo” to the kangaroo rat, which is
small enough to hide in a clump of grass. The various
types alter in accordance with the class of country
in which they live, the rock wallaby being specially
adapted to comply with certain conditions of life, the
black wallaby having been evolved to meet with
other conditions, and the tree-climbing divisions having
developed a remarkable and unique faculty which would
tree-climbing animal is believed to have descended from
ancestry of vastly superior size to that of the present
type. The timbered country of Queensland, together
with that of the remainder of the continent, abounds
with phalanges, popularly though incorrectly known
as opossums. Related to the latter is the animal
generally known as the “flying squirrel.” This is not
allied to the real squirrel, nor is it capable of real
flight, being able merely to glide through the air on an
inclined plane by means of webbing between its legs.

be of little use on the wide plains of the interior. The
latter varieties are regarded with great interest, not
only because of the remarkable way in which they
shelter from danger by sleeping and resting in the upper
branches of the forest, but also because of the close
similarity they show with the tree-climbers of Papua,
thus yielding evidence of a land passage connecting the
two countries at what, from a geological view-point,
could not have been a very remote period.
The koala, or native bear, is met with very fre-
quently in Queensland. This quaint-looking, tailless,
n 2
Thus it is able to pass considerable distances from tree
to tree without touching the ground. For a long while
it was believed that the wombat family of marsupial
was entirely absent from Queensland, but these burrow-
ing, root-eating, tailless creatures are now found to
inhabit the north-east of the continent. The wombat
belongs to a degenerated family of marsupials. Once
many varieties of them wandered over the face of the
continent, but most of these are now extinct. Among
other Queensland marsupials are a striped bandicoot
and a rat-like bandicoot.


The State contains but few carnivorous marsupials,
and what there are have greatly degenerated since
former times. Among these are three varieties of
“native cats,” the largest being the spotted-tail variety,
of which, however, the individuals are not larger than
some domestic cats. A member of the same family is
the brush-tailed rat, which though no larger than a
small rat is extremely savage, and is able to kill large
birds with one well-directed bite on the head. Mar-
supial “mice” are chiefly noteworthy as being active
destroyers of insects.
OTHER MAMMALS.
Apart from the marsupials the best-known mammal
of Australia is the dingo, or wild dog, a species sup-
posed to have reached these shores subsequently to man,
since no signs of the former are to be found among traces
of animals now extinct. Though particularly destruc-
tive to sheep, the dingo is a cowardly brute, hunting
alone and never attacking an animal able to defend
itself.
Queensland contains a
great quantity of bats,
varying in size from little
creatures no bigger than a
mouse to flying foxes which
extend a wing two feet or
more in length. The smaller
varieties live on insects,
but the larger kinds carry
destruction into the or-
chards of the fruit-grower.
Before the country came
to be settled the flying
foxes lived mostly on honey, and in distributing
pollen they performed a useful function. But the
settler to-day rarely misses an opportunity of engaging
in wholesale slaughter when he finds a camping-place
where the flying foxes sleep in thousands, hanging from
trees, during the daytime. Several types of rats and
mice, which are not marsupials, are to be found in
Queensland. In the north of the State a variety of
the large rat sometimes proves so prolific that it moves
about in swarms and causes considerable destruction.
The water-rat is indigenous to many parts of the State.
It is a large muscular species, inhabiting waterways
and frequently making itself obnoxious by raids on
poultry yards. A rare but interesting species is the
nimble little jumping-mouse.
In addition to the higher mammals there are two
species of a lower order of life which also are non-
marsupial. These belong to the Monotreme order.
Like reptiles, they possess but one posterior orifice and
they lay eggs. The milk glands are not furnished with
nipples. The two families of Monotremes are represented
NEO-CERATODUS FOSTERI
(THE CERATODUS, OR THE AUSTRALIAN LUNG FISH).
by the platypus (a remarkable aquatic creature of
unique structure, which inhabits the banks of rivers,
penetrating the latter by passage-ways opening beneath
the water and slanting upwards to the open air) and
the echidna. The latter is popularly known as the
“hedgehog” and the “porcupine.” This creature bears
no relation to either hedgehogs or porcupines. The
echidna is an ant-eater, and is armed with long sharp
quills, which effectively protect it from attack by snakes,
dogs, or other enemies. The claws of the beast are of
great strength, so that it is able to tear open the hardest
of sun-baked anthills, after which it speedily licks up
the insects within, being endowed with a long tongue
specially suited to the purpose. In the face of danger
in an open place the echidna burrows with extraordinary
rapidity and thus secures protection.
Another class of mammals belonging to Queensland
is to be found in the waters round her coast. There
are two families of such creatures, which long ago
deserted the land for the sea. They are whales and
dugongs. The former consist mainly of bottle-nose
whales and porpoises. On
almost every voyage along
the coast the latter may
be seen sporting round the
bows of the skip and plung-
ing through the waves
at an extraordinary speed
as they disappear into the
distance. Dugongs are to
be met with along the
whole of the coast, from
Cape York to Moreton
Bay, though they are not
now nearly so plentiful in the latter region as was
the case in the days of earliest settlement.
BIRDS.
Of approximately 875 birds known in Australia about
four-fifths are indigenous to Queensland, and of the latter
some are not found beyond her own borders. This
applies to the cassowary, the largest bird, which is much
heavier and more strongly built than the emu. Not
only is the State rich in the variety of its birds, but also
in the beauty of their plumage. The handsomest are
found among the rifle and bower birds, parrots, finches,
pigeons, dragoon birds, and wrens.
In his “Geographical History of Queensland,”
Archibald Meston enumerates the varieties of each
species of Queensland birds as follows: —Three eagles,
1 csprey, 4 falcons, 7 hawks, 1 kestrel, 1 buzzard, 4 kites,
2 harriers, 3 true owls, 6 hawk owls, 3 night jars, 7

tins, 1 bee-eater, 1 roller (dollar bird), 8 wood swallows,

their plumage as they flash through the sunlight. The
great palm cockatoo is confined to the north, but many
beautiful smaller varieties are to be found over most of
the State.
Of birds of prey, the Australian eagle, otherwise
known as the wedge-tailed eagle, or the eagle hawk,
occupies the pride of place. This is a true eagle,
measuring sometimes seven feet from wing-tip to wing-
tip. The Australian eagle is a savage bird, and when
hungry several of them may be seen following and
keeping close to a mob of lambing ewes, waiting to
pounce upon and carry away the first lamb to be
separated from its mother. When full-grown merino
sheep are unable to rise to their feet through weakness,
or through being caught in an unusual unevenness of
the ground while heavily clothed with wool, eagles will
quickly swoop down on the unfortunate animal, usually
opening the flank and tearing out the intestines before
death has taken place. The birds are most often to be
CROCODILUS POROSUS (COAST CROCODILE).
rails, 2 frigate birds, 1 swan, 4 geese, 1 tropic bird,
3 gannets, 2 grebes, 4 cormorants, 1 snake bird (darter),
1 pelican, 10 ducks. Terns, petrels, and other sea birds
are not included. Additions have lately been made. Sand-
pipers and other waders come and go in varying numbers.
Of all Queensland’s birds, the zoologist will find
most to interest him in the giant cassowary, which is
restricted to one spot on the north-eastern coast. No
evidence is available of this species having inhabited any
other part of the continent, though such was probably
the case. The cassowary is wingless, and is the last
survivor of a type otherwise long since extinct.
Among birds of flight the most important place is
occupied by the parrot family, though Queensland does
not possess any of the parrot proper. However, black,
white, and coloured cockatoos, and widely-varying par-
rakeets—all of the parrot tribe—exist in plenty, making
the forests resound again with their screeching, and
dazzling the eyes of the traveller with the brightness of
found where there is timber, but they will sometimes
roam far over the plains in search of food. In moun-
tain country they may be seen soaring in the upper air,
so far above as to appear little more than specks in the
blue of the sky; but they are provided with a wonder-
fully keen eyesight, which enables them to detect the
presence of their prey from great altitudes. Opossums
form part of their natural diet, but they are also able
to lift a large lamb and fly carrying it in their talons.
Related to the wedge-tailed eagle is the smaller crested
eagle. Sea eagles and ospreys live from food obtained
from swamps, rivers, and such lakes as the country
provides. In addition, falcons, goshawks, kestrels,
kites, harriers, and some other species live on little
birds, carrion, and such food as lies within their reach.
The snow-white goshawk is usually regarded as being the
most handsome of the birds of prey of Queensland.
Of owls, the great scrub owl is the largest and most
hardy. The Australian barn owl is very similar to the


barn owl of England. The boobook gives a call resemb-
ling that of the cuckoo. Nightjars and goatsuckers of
several kinds have been given the name of Morepork,
because they have a call of which that word is almost
an exact representation. Swiftlets, the builders of nests
which the Chinese use as an article of food, inhabit
the north of Queensland. The dollar bird visits the
south of the State in the summer. Kingfishers of dif-
ferent varieties are distributed over the State generally,
some of them being brightly and beautifully plumed.
The “laughing jackass,” however, which is a kingfisher,
is beautiful neither in feathers nor in voice, though his
loud, echoing “laughter” possesses a cheery note which
has made the bird univer-
sally popular among bush-
men. Plain and bronzed
cuckoos are to be found
in considerable numbers
in various parts of the
State.
Among remarkable
varieties must be men-
tioned the birds of para-
dise and the bower birds',
both of which belong to
a group that the north-
eastern corner of the con-
tinent possesses in common
with Papua. Three kinds
of rifle birds and a manu-
code are native to Queens-
land ; but none of them,
in splendour of plumage,
rival the paradise birds of
Papua. The bower birds,
however, attain their
greatest development in
Queensland. These crea-
tures are remarkable by
reason of their strange
antics while at play, and
the elaborate arrangements
they make for their queer dances. The regent bird,
satin bird, and spotted bower bird construct for a
playground a gutter-shaped pathway, bounded by
walls and made of grass. They run up and down
this path carrying shells, pieces of bone, and other
things which have attracted their fancy and which they
have collected. The crested bower bird finds a spot
where two saplings are a little way apart, with a vine
cr some other connection joining them. A family of
the birds then surround one sapling with a wall of inter-
laced sticks, some raising the structure to from six to
eight feet in height and ornamenting the outside with
moss and lichen. The other sapling is also surrounded,
though less elaborately. Between the two the birds
have their playground.
Papua is more richly endowed than is any other
part of the world in beautifully-plumed pigeons, and
this portion of the fauna of the northern island has
clearly extended southward, so that Queensland has
come to be well-stocked with many lovely varieties of
this species. Of these, the maroon-breasted fruit
type is the largest, whilst the small fruit pigeons
present the greatest contrasts in colouring. The plumed
bird and the wonga-wonga are also noted varieties.
Evidences have been discovered of the beautiful crowned
pigeon of Papua having at one time inhabited Queens-
land. The latter is a heavy
ground bird, and it could
not have flown across the
Straits, even if aided by a
strong wind, so that its
distribution, together with
that of the scrub hen, must
be regarded as further
evidence of the land con-
nection at one time binding
in one mass the continent
of Australia with the is-
lands of the north. The
scrub hens are chiefly re-
markable by reason of
burying their eggs in sand
mounds, where they are
allowed to remain until the
heat of the sun performs
the work of incubation.
Even more interesting is
the method of the scrub
turkey, which buries its
eggs beneath a mound of
rubbish three or four feet
in height and from fifteen
to twenty feet in diameter.
In this instance the incu-
bation is accomplished by
heat generated by the decomposition of the dead
vegetation. Mounds of this description may be found
in the bush in different parts of the State. From such
“incubators” the young birds issue forth fully fledged
and independent of parental aid.
Of the various other Queensland birds, most are
indigenous to some one or more of the other States.
Among the forests of the coastal regions, where the
map on page 16 shows the rainfall to be heavy, an
endless source of interest is provided for the Nature-
lover in the great variety of bright plumages and strange
notes, whilst the water of each lagoon fairly teems with
feathered things—stately black swans, ducks, teal,
PHASCOLARCTUS CINEREUS (THE NATIVE BEAR, OR KOALA).


divers, and hosts of other water-fowl and long-legged
feeders from swamps and the edges of billabongs,
REPTILES AND AMPHIBIA.
Among the reptiles of Queensland first place in the
matter of size, as well as of danger to human beings,
belongs to the crocodile, which is the common crocodile
of the wester pacific. It inhabits the rivers of the
State to the northward of Keppel Bay and the Fitzroy.
This man-eating creature grows to a length of twenty-
five feet, and a very long space of time is occupied by
it in attaining to maturity,
as much as fifteen months
being required by the
young to reach to a length
of that many inches. In
the fresh water in the north
of the State a much smaller
type of crocodile is found.
The latter reaches a maxi-
mum length of about eight
feet, and is harmless so far
as man is concerned. There
are no alligators in any
part of Australia, though
the name is often wrongly
applied to the native
crocodiles. Queensland is
inhabited by several kinds
of fresh-water tortoises,
whilst large marine turtles
are found along the coast.
The State contains a great
variety of lizards, though
none of them are venom-
ous. The smaller kinds per-
form a useful function in
keeping in check numbers
of insects, in the produc-
tion of which the north-
eastern corner of the
continent is so prolific.
Prominent in the lizard
family are the monitors,
to which the name iguana
has wrongly been attached. These creatures are from
six to seven feet long, but they have descended from
stock of double that size; whilst an allied type
of a bygone age measured thirty feet from nose
to tail. Monitors devour carrion, but they also
■eat poultry. Indeed, they are ready to consume
almost anything in the nature of flesh with which
they come into contact. Other members of the
lizard tribe present some remarkable and interesting
traits. The skink possesses a suit of overlapping scales.
CACATUA LEADBEATERI (COCKARINA, OR MAJOR MITCHELL PARROT).
THE PINK-CRESTED OR LEADBEATER'S COCKATOO.
The sleeping-lizard is a vegetarian, and its only notion
of defence is to open wide its mouth and display a
great blue tongue. The skinks are of varying shape.
Some of them have four serviceable legs. Others
possess only two very small legs; whilst the single pair
may be found sometimes in the front and sometimes at
the posterior end of the body. Others again are quite
without limbs of any kind. Geckos possess feet specially
constructed so that, whilst in search of insects to devour,
they can climb almost anywhere, and indeed may be
seen adhering to a window-pane and walking on a
ceiling, like flies do. The
frilled lizard of Queens-
land is able to walk for
some distance on its hind
legs, this gift doubtless
being a special adaptation
to permit of the creature
peering over surrounding
grass in its efforts to locate
possible sources of danger
or supplies of food. An-
other variety of lizard
lives underground, and is
often dug up about Bris-
bane.
Of about fifty varie-
ties of snakes found in
Queensland approximately
half are venomous, though,
of these latter not all are
dangerous, owing to vary-
ing degrees of effectiveness
in the poison which they
excrete and to the struc-
tural apparatus with which
they inject it into the
victim, Among venomous
species, the death adder is
the most poisonous, though
it is confined to certain
districts. In the Central
coastal district a poisonous,
orange-bellied black snake
attains to a length of ten
feet. A keel-backed variety, with a ridge down each
scale somewhat resembling the harmless water snake, is
also to be avoided. Some fatal bites, however, have
been received also from the black snake, which
is usually to be found near water, as frogs f rm one
of its principal articles of diet. Another venomous
type is indigenous to the western districts, whilst about
Brisbane most trouble is experienced from a species
marked with close-set black-and-white rings and bearing
a white crescent on its crown.


Chief among the non-venomous snakes are those of
the constricting family. Included in this class is the
common carpet snake, which attains to twenty feet in
length. Another variety is a black-headed rock snake
inhabiting the Central district. Specimens twenty-five
feet long of this type are said to have been captured.
The green and the red tree snake are not venomous and
are not members of the constricting family. Several
sorts of water snakes inhabit rivers and billabongs,
whilst sea snakes are to be found along the more
northern stretches of the coast. The latter are
venomous.
Frogs and allied species are the most plentiful
types among the amphibia of Queensland. This is
another result of the great quantity of insects indigenous
to the country. Toads also display many varieties.
FISHES.
The largest of Queensland’s freshwater fish is the
Murray cod, which is found throughout the river system
drained by the Darling and its tributaries. These fish
attain to a weight of from 50 lb. to 60 lb. The cera-
todus presents what, scientifically considered, is the most
interesting form of life in Australian waters. In some
of the streams of Queensland it co-exists with the
Murray cod, and it is believed to have in-
habited all the rivers of the Murray system.
The ceratodus is one of the oldest surviving species
in the world, and for this reason it has been referred
to as a living fossil. Its remains have been discovered
in rocks in Europe and in southern Asia, the evidence
being that the species flourished at a period considered
remote even by the reckoning of geologists. The creature
is armed with a kind of rudimentary lung in addition
to its gills, and it consequently is believed to be able to
breathe free air. The popular idea that it voluntarily
leaves the water at times for the dry la.nd is discredited
by zoologists.
The Queensland coast is particularly rich in edible
fish. In the northern waters the giant perch is some-
times 70 lb. in weight; whilst along the southern
extremity of the coast gropers are caught weighing
3 cwt. Schnapper and sea bream are plentiful, and
sea mullet ascend the rivers in great numbers. The
fishing industry as yet is undeveloped; but it is certain
that the natural resources of the coastal waters furnish
abundant supplies of what should become a cheap food.
The invertebrate marine creatures of waters adja-
cent to the Queensland coast include many interesting
and some commercially-valuable species. Chief among
the latter is the marine oyster. The clam is notorious
for its size—individuals being three feet in diameter—
and because of its great strength, which enableiS it to
hold down the luckless diver until he dies. Sea snails
are found in great profusion. Indeed, so numerous are
their varieties that they are held to equal nearly three-
fourths of all the other mollusca of Australia. Cuttle
fish are plentiful, but do not attain to the same great
size as they exhibit in some other waters. But the
marine creature which has exercised most influence on
the physical history of the country, and on its physical
geography, is the coral-builder—that being of low
structure, which in its myriads has reared up the Great
Barrier Reef extending down almost the whole of the
east coast of the State, and has formed so many of the
adjacent islands.
ENTOMOLOGY.
Queensland offers a vast field to be studied by the
entomologist. Brilliant moths and butterflies of all
conceivable colours and great range of size flit through
the timber of the coastal hills and glitter in the sunlight
of open places. Species of beetles are equally numerous,
and are widely different in size, form, and structure.
The name of "ladybird” has been fastened to a Queens-
land beetle nine inches long. The most numerous
insects are “white ants,” which erect great hills of earth
that the sun bakes on the surface to almost the hardness
of rock and are often a great deal higher than a man;
and the strange-looking structures may easily be mistaken
for outcrops of rock by the newcomer to Queensland as
he passes through the country by train or road. The
“white ant,” which eats away timber, and would destroy
any wooden house that was not protected, is
not really an ant. Flies, mosquitoes, dragon flies, and
other winged insects exist in great numbers, whilst
spiders offer a wide and interesting field, which con-
tains many unique specimens of strange habits. The
black spider is poisonous, as also are some other varie-
ties, though death is not likely to occur to an adult from
the bite of one of them.
Scorpions and centipedes are able to kill small
animals with the venom of their bite, but death to a
human being has not been known to occur from that
cause.
CONCLUSION.
The fauna of the country contains many other
species of invertebrates, which the limits of space will
not permit giving any detailed description of. It
may be emphasized that the half-explored and almost
unknown forests of the north and the little-investigated
waters of the coast offer an enticing field to rew r ard the
research of the biologist, as indeed they offer attractions
to the Government to turn to better account and more
thoroughly develop the economic resources they con-
tain. Very much yet remains to be found out about
the animal life of the mighty territory of Queensland,
peopled as it is by less than three-quarters of a million
inhabitants, most of whom are congregated in the south-
eastern corner of the State.


THE FLORA OF QUEENSLAND
The flora, like the fauna, of Australia in general,
and of Queensland in particular, yields abundant traces
of the migration of life to the continent from Asia,
and, in a lesser degree, from more widely-separated
parts of the world. The vegetation of the Common-
wealth may thus be divided into three sections:
Firstly, there is the autochthonous, or original class of
plants found scattered over all the States in more or
less abundance, according to the nature of the soil, the
climate, and the success with which immigrant species
have competed. Secondly, there is an element which
has come from other lands, mostly from Asia, and which
has, to a certain extent, pushed out and taken the place
of the more truly Australian types. And, thirdly, we
find a flora belonging to cold climates, closely allied to
species found on the Andes in South America. The
latter type is now confined to the mountain heights of
Tasmania, Victoria, and New South Wales.
The writer of an article appearing in this volume
dealing with the fauna of Queensland has pointed out
how the geological history of the continent and sur-
rounding regions has influenced the evolution of species.
The map appearing with that paper renders a clear
idea, by means of illustrating existing ocean depths,
of how Australia has been linked by continuous land
connection with Asia in the north, as well as with New
Zealand, and probably South America, in the east. A
number of animal species for long ages having their
homes in these regions could hot have reached Austra-
lian shores had the same waterways divided the conti-
nent from the outside world as have for a subsequent
period preserved the distinctive fauna which the
country obtained partly by biological evolution within
her territory and partly by migration. But the water
barrier, which would have proved impossible of passage
to great wingless birds and other large species incapable
of flight, would not retard the migration of vegetation
to the same extent. In ‘The Origin of Species,”
Charles Darwin has dealt exhaustively with the transfer
of flora from land to land and from continent to con-
tinent, over both seas and oceans; and he has quoted
abundant evidence to establish the likelihood of seeds
reaching Australia by means either of ocean currents
or by birds during the time when the coast-line of this
and neighbouring lands were approximately identical with
their present conformation. At the same time, a great
deal of flora, besides having migrated from elsewhere,
already had become established here before the sever-
ance of continent from the land mass of Asia.
Queensland possesses a greater wealth and variety
of vegetation than does any other portion of the con-
tinent. The richness of her natural pastures is prob-
ably unrivalled in the world. Among over a thousand
varieties of her timber are to be found types suitable for
every use to which wood can be put. Her wide interior
contains hundreds of species of fodder plants especially
adapted by Nature to withstand the ravages of pro-
tracted rainless periods. Her abundantly-watered
coastal districts are rich with a flora including some of
the most valuable timbers of India, but which long
since have become indigenous to this country. The red
cedar which Burma exports, and which is known as
Moulmein cedar on the London market, grows in
Queensland. The tree from which doomba oil is
obtained in Ceylon flourishes along our north coast, as
also does the species from which poon spars are cut.
In our tropical districts the ponga oil tree of India
is a common variety. Other trees identical with or
similar to varieties put to great economic use in older
settled lands, but which in this country have hardly
yet been treated as possessing any industrial value
whatever, constitute a vast field of national wealth yet
unestimated and unexploited.
HISTORICAL.
Though the flora of Queensland is more unique
than that of any other of the States, its general aspects
cannot be studied apart from those of Australia as a
whole. In the history of scientific investigation, as
well as in distribution of plants, the connection between,
say, the coastal districts of neighbouring States is
closer than the connection between the coastal district
and the interior of any one State.
Fur purposes of convenience the story of the study
of the botany of Australia may be divided into three
stages. The first of these periods extends from the
voyage of Dampier in 1697 to 1827, when, the Blue
Mountains having been crossed, Allan Cunningham led
an exploring party along the western foot of that range
and northward to the latitude of Moreton Bay. During
this time investigations were confined exclusively to flora
of the coast-line, the interior of the continent remaining
a closed book. Investigation during the second period
included the collection, examination, and classification
of plants of the interior; but the work of these early
botanists was beset with many difficulties. At that
period Australian colonial governments could afford
little to spend on scientific work not yielding direct
monetary results. Botanists and explorers worked, for
the most part, independently of one another, without
any co-ordinating assistance which would compare and
classify their discoveries as well as experiment with
the new species which were continually being obtained.
The third era began with the establishment of self-
government and the sudden advance in population and
wealth which followed the gold discoveries. The


governments of the separate colonies then began the
practice of annually sjjending portions of their revenues
in maintaining botanical gardens, managed with scien-
tific skill and used for original research. These gardens
opened the way to a close and accurate study of indi-
genous plants, as well as to the investigation of the
suitability or otherwise to local conditions of species
imported from abroad for economic and other purposes.
Although it was left to Carolus Linnaeus, who was
born in 1707, to found botanical science, as it is now
understood, English knowledge of the Australian flora
began in 1697, when Dampier published the account of
his voyage to the southern continent. This volume
contained rough drawings of a number of specimens
of plants which the explorer had brought to Europe with
him. Among these have been recognized the casuarina,
the tea-tree, the Sturt pea, and a prickly salmon
plant, besides others. Eighty-two years elapsed before
any addition was made to the slender store of botanical
information rendered available by Dampier. But the
next expedition proved much more fertile in its produc-
tion of knowledge of the flora of the southern continent.
On this occasion the eastern coast was explored, whereas
Dampier’s investigations were carried out on the western
side of Australia. In 1770 Dr. Solander, a skilled
botanist, accompanied Captain Cook, when they spent
a considerable time at various points along the coasts
of what now are New South Wales and Queensland.
In the territory of the latter Dr. Solander col-
lected at Bustard Bay, Broadsound, Cape Grafton,
Endeavour River, and Lizard Island. Altogether he
obtained specimens of about 1,000 species. This was
the beginning of something approaching accurate and
useful knowledge of Australian flora. In the following
year Menzies, a botanist, was with Vancouver’s expedi-
tion on the western coast of the continent; whilst in
1772 a botanist named Labillardiere, attached to
d’Entrecasteaux’s expedition, gathered specimens in the
south of Tasmania, the passage between Bruni Island
and the mainland of that State being named after the
leader of the party.
In 1799 and again in 1802 Flinders pursued investi-
gations along the coast. On the later of these two
voyages the famous explorer had with him the botanist
Robert Brown, whose name figures so prominently in
all works dealing comprehensively with Australian
plants and their discoverers. When Brown began his
collecting in the beginning of the century the total of
known Australian species stood at about 1,300; but so
successful was his energetic quest that the figure was
raised to 4,000 by the termination of the voyage.
Besides specimens being obtained from the southern
shores, between the eastern end of the Great Australian
Bight and Gulf St. Vincent, search was made along the
shores of the Gulf of Carpentaria and along the
north-west of the Northern Territory. Thus the results of
the expedition were as rich in variety as in the number
of specimens, for knowledge was thus obtained of the
most widely-separated —in heredity as well as in distance
—types of Australian vegetation. The differences
between the types found in the north and the south lay
deeper in origin than could have been supposed at the
time, for evidences since becoming available have shown
clearly that the immigrant species now figuring so pro-
minently in Queensland and the coast-line of the
Northern Territory must have reached these shores
while the western half of the continent was still
separated by water from the east. Since the fusion of
the two land masses an arid belt had divided two parts
into a southern and a northern section, except for the
connection along the eastern coast. Flinders terminated
this voyage in 1803, but not until eleven years later
were the botanical results published, and in the mean-
time the French explorer, Baudin, who had met the
Englishmen in Encounter Bay, pirated and published as
his own the discoveries of his English contemporary.
A few years later Allan Cunningham, whose name
was destined to become famous in connection with
Australian botany and exploration, was specially sent
by the British Government from Kew Gardens, where
he had been engaged in studying plant life, to investi-
gate plant life on the new continent. In 1817 Lieutenant
King, under orders from the Imperial authorities, set
out to survey the north-western coast of the continent.
Four years were spent on this work and other voyagings.
Cunningham was attached to the expedition, and he
made a collection of botanical specimens. The voyages
were made to include the north-east, and a number
of landings were made in what now is Queensland.
Collections were made at Rodd Bay, Percy Isles,
Cleveland, Halifax Bay, Rockingham Bay, Endeavour
River, as well as other points along the coast. In
1828 Cunningham, accompanied by C. Fraser, who at
that time was colonial botanist, mad© an investigation
of the flora between Brisbane and Cunningham Gap
in the Main Range. During the following year Cun-
ningham again was collecting in the neighbourhood of
the Brisbane River, and the Queensland hoop pine (an
Araucaria) has been named after him, whilst several
Queensland plants bear the name of Fraser.
The second stage in Australian botanical research
was opened by Cunningham in 1827 when, in command
of an expedition equipped at the expense of the Imperial
Government, he crossed the Blue Mountains, traversed
Liverpool Plains, and penetrated as far north as the
latitude of Brisbane. Altogether this indefatigable
investigator added the names of 1,300 new species to
the known list of Australian plants. He died in 1835,
when accompanying Mitchell on an exploring expedition.
At that time some 6,000 Australian flowering plants


were known, and considerable progress was being made
at grouping them.
The names of a number of colonial botanists occur
in connection with subsequent collections in Queensland.
BACA HYGROSCOPICA.
In 1836 James Backhouse found hitherto unknown
varieties about Brisbane, and a genus of the Myrtle
family (Backhousia) has been called after him. Sir
Thomas Mitchell collected on the
Warrego, Maranoa, Barcoo, Bel-
yando, and Noga in 1846, and his
name has been given to the native
pomegranate (Capparis Mitchellii).
Collections were made in Southern
Queensland, and from the Darling
Downs to Essington, by Leichhardt
during 1843-5. John McGillivray
obtained new specimens along the
Queensland coast in 1847-8; whilst
W. Carron, who accompanied the
ill-fated expedition led by Kennedy
to Cape York in 1848, added con-
siderably to the list of known plants.
A native Bauhinia (B. Carroni)
was named in his honour. J. T.
Bidwell’s name was given the
bunya pine (Araucaria Bidwilli),
though the first discoverer of
that celebrated species was An-
drew Petrie in the year 1840.
Bidwell collected at Moreton Bay and the Mary River.
The tree Randia Fitzalani was named after Eugene Fitz-
alan, who collected with Lieutenant Smith’s expedition
to the Lower Burdekin. William Landsborough, who
became known chiefly through exploration, collected
in North-western Queensland in 1861. Collecting was
done at Botany Bay by Dr. H. Beckler, who went with
the ill-fated Burke and Wills
expedition as botanist to the party.
W. R. Guilfoyle, of the Melbourne
Botanical Gardens, and Charles
Moore, who occupied a similar posi-
tion in Sydney, both collected in
Central and Southern Queensland,
the name of the latter having been
given to the Springsure cycad
(Macrozamia Moorei). M. A.
Thozet, who lived at Rockhampton,
rendered available a quantity of
valuable information connected with
the flora of that district, and sent
specimens to Baron Mueller, the
famous scientist, who was Govern-
ment Botanist of Victoria. The
name of this collector was given by
Mueller to the genus Thozetia.
Walter Hill, curator of the Brisbane
Botanical Gardens, accompanied Dal-
rymple’s expedition to the northern
coast in 1874, and his name has been
given to the scrub ironwood (Myrtus IJUlii). In 1889
F. M. Bailey, well known because of his published work
on Queensland botany, went with a Government
SARCOCHILUS HARTMANNI (MOUNTAIN ORCHID).
scientific expedition to Bellenden-Ker Range and the Mul-
grove and Russell Rivers, and during that enterprise he
added 100 new names to the list of plants of the State.


The Johnstone River hardwood (Backhousia Bancrofti)
was named after Dr. T. L. Bancroft, and the northern
kauri pine (Agathis Palmerstonii) and a Gryptocarya
were named after Christie Palmerston. Another success-
ful collector was Alexander McPherson, who devoted a
deal of attention to native fibres. In 1887 the botanist
Sayer, who was collecting on the Bellenden-Ker Range
for Baron Mueller, discovered a specimen of the
Dracophyllum Sayeri, which is considered to be one
of the most beautiful wild-flowers in the world. J. F.
Shirley, D.Sc., has accomplished valuable original work
in connection with lichens, and the Cupania Shirleyana
has been named in his honour. Successful collecting in
the Gulf country has been carried out by Edward
Palmer. The discovery of Meston’s Mangosteen (Gar-
cinia Mestoni), one of the best Australian wild-fruits,
and Piper (Chavica) Mestoni , or long pepper, lies to
the credit of A. Meston, who led the Bellenden-Ker
expedition of 1889. The standard work on the flora of
the State is F. M. Bailey’s “Queensland Flora,”
which contains the names of all the plants of
the State which had been discovered up to the time of
writing. Queensland was the first State to publish a
separate “Flora.”
Many hands have contributed to the classification
and naming of Australian plants, which now number
over 10,000 known varieties, including the higher varie-
ties of seaweeds and fungi. The established list of
veined-leaf plants is about 9,000, and is continually
increasing as fresh discoveries are made. Among early
workers who either wrote about Australian plants or
helped botanists engaged in that task was Sir Joseph
Banks. Solander and J. Rheinold Forster, both of
whom had accompanied Captain Cook, helped with their
pens, though the latter proved the more prolific author.
Sir J. E. Smith was responsible for the publication of
some illustrations of Australian plants in 1793; whilst,
in Paris in 1804-6, De la Billiardiere worked up and
published a summary of the then known flora of the
southern continent. But it was left to Robert Brown,
who had accompanied Flinders on his long voyage of
the coast, to lay the real foundations of the scientific
study of the botany of the country. In 1810 Brown
began the publication of a prodromus of Australian
flora, and in 1830 he brought out a volume supple-
mentary to this work. Brown’s draughtsman during
the voyage with Flinders (Bauer) in 1813, and Robert
Sweet in 1827, brought out volumes of Australian
botanical illustrations.
Floras have been published by the various States,
but these works have lacked unanimity in the adoption
of a common system of naming and grouping species,
and consequently they do not render the aid which
might be expected of them to the student desiring to
compare the flora of one State with another. A
comjDrehensive and at the time excellent work, “Flora
Australiensis,” was carried out by George Bentham,
but it does not carry the reader beyond knowledge
available in 1876. However, the work of recording
subsequent discoveries was undertaken by Baron von
Mueller in his “Fragmenta Phytographia Australiae.”
The same author in 1889 prepared a “Census,” which is
of great value in comparing the flora of the various
States with one another. But as this still is practically
the only work available for the purpose, the following
list of the principal older books in which Australian
plants were first described should be useful to the
student:

ELEMENTS OF AUSTRALIAN FLORA.
In his “Census of Australian Plants, 1889,” Baron
von Mueller enumerates 8,839 well-established species.
Additions made since that book was written do not
introduce any new principles into the discussion of the
flora of the country. Of the total dealt with by him,
von Mueller grouped the species into 156 natural orders,
comprising 1,409 genera.
The present article has already pointed out that
the Australian flora contains an autochthonous element,
a tropical immigrant element allied to the oriental
vegetation, and an arctic element allied to vegetation
MILLETTIA MEGASPERMA (NATIVE WISTERIA)
indigenous to the Andes in South America. The first
of these three groups, like the fauna of the country,
dates its first existence on the Southern continent to a
remote geological period, and contains many types long
extinct in other parts of the world. Species which
elsewhere have vanished when more modern types
have appeared in the arena of struggle for subsist-
ence in Australia have remained isolated from such
competitive strife, and the internal environment of the
FARADAYA SPLENDIDA.
continent has failed to itself either produce new types
analagous to those springing into existence across the
seas or to modify existing types along lines parallel to
those on which botanical evolution was shaping its course
under different conditions. Of the fossils found in Aus-
tralian rocks, some fifty are known to survive, and seven-
teen of this number are confined solely to this continent.
These belong to the genera Byhlis, Casuarina, Cephalo-
tus, Santalum, Nuytsia, Polympholyx, Persoonia, Gre-
villea, Hakea, Lomatia, Banksia, Dryandra, Callicoma,
Geratopetalum, Boronia, Eucalyptus, and Phylloglos-
sum. With the exception of Persoonia, Hakea, and
Boronia, all these genera have left their fossil remains
to be discovered in Europe, some of them having lived
as far north as Greenland and Spitzbergen, though they
have long since been exterminated from the Northern
Hemisphere by the competition of newer and better-
adapted species, or by climatic change, or both. North
America contains seven of the other species still sur-
viving, or species closely allied to them, and Brazil two.
The East Indian islands contain sixteen, Japan three,
the Island of Bourbon (off the African coast) one, the
Himalaya Mountains one, Syria one, Europe three, and
New Zealand two. Conversely, there are species which,
though in a far-ancient time they lived in Australia,
have since become extinct in this continent, but survive
elsewhere. Among these are the Sequoias (pines) from
which the giant pine of California is indistinguishable,
the latter now yielding the timber America exports from
Oregon to Australia, as well as to other places.


From these facts it will be inferred that at an
earlier stage of the world’s history specific species of
plants were much more scattered over the face of the
globe than is now the case. Indeed, such a conclusion
is irresistible. This may be accounted for by two
explanations. The climate of the earth may have
greatly altered, or plant life may have once possessed
greater adaptability to contend against difficult condi-
tions of survival than that which it is now able to
exercise. The latter theory is in contradiction to
what are generally accepted as the principles of
biological evolution. Species almost everywhere gain
in adaptability to withstand adversity, and only
in the odd instance of a decaying type do they
recede in fitness to survive. A third hypothesis is that
species may have lost general adaptability to many
environments because of modifications necessary to
securing increased special adaptability to peculiar and
limited environments. We have collateral evidence of a
very definite nature of the climate having changed very
materially in many lands, and particularly in Australia.
So great have been some of the climatic alterations in
this continent that the southern districts of South Aus-
tralia, Western Australia, and particularly Bacchus
Marsh, in Victoria, all show distinct geological signs
of a glacial period having been passed through in
those localities. Still other causes may have been
responsible for the much wider distribution of tree life
existing in the Tertiary period. An explanation has
been attempted to the effect that the development of
monocotyledons, including grasses, after the Miocene
period, affords sufficient reason to account for the modi-
fication of tree species, and particularly for an altera-
tion into highly-specialized forms adapted to special
local conditions. In support of this suggestion it has
been pointed out that the teeth of the early mammals
were better suited for masticating twigs, bark, and fruit
than for browsing on pastures. From these premises it
has been argued that instead of keeping down the
pastures as they now do, the mammals, by living exclu-
sively on trees, allowed the herbage of highly-inflam-
mable vegetation to accumulate so thickly, close to the
ground, that when summer fires occurred they wrought
terrific destruction, and all the flora on wide regions
was in danger in hot, dry weather of annihilation. But
the explanation of the origin of fires before the advent
of man presents a weak link in that chain of reasoning.
To return to the distribution of species now or at
some other period indigenous to this continent, apart
from the fascinating, if quite speculative theories as to
the causes of the various migrations, we find that the
flora of New Zealand during the Tertiary period dis-
played little affinity with that of Australia, but that
during the Mesozoic period many types were common to
both, whilst some of these latter survive to-day in the
shape of closely-allied species. Among those lingering
species are the Ginkgo pine of China and Japan, the
Araucaria or “Norfolk Island pine,” and the Dammara
or “Kauri" pine. Fossils of plants which are identical,
though of genera now extinct, are still more numerous
among the ancient coal beds of South Africa, India,
Tonquin, Australia, and New Zealand.
The immigrant forms in the Australian flora have
descended from families of comparatively recent date,
and not sufficient time has elapsed since their arrival
on this continent to allow for any marked modification
in their characters. Even on the north-eastern coastal
districts, which were connected with other countries at
a much later date than was any other part of Australia,
and where the immigrant tropical plants were more
suited to meeting the difficulties of Australian conditions
than were newcomers to other places in the continent,
numbers of species, after being cut off from reinforce-
ments, have died out in the face of competition with local
types. When the invasion of the east was occurring,
the west still existed as a separate island, and after the
continent altered its shape to something approaching
the present conformation the immigrant species of
tropical and semi-tropical regions along the north-
eastern coastal fringe were weakened with a cessation of
reinforcements, whilst the autochthonous flora, being
better adapted than the strange types to cross the arid
intervening space, were continually coming from the
west and strengthening the original species in its struggle
for supremacy. This caused the extinction of many
immigrant families and accelerated the modification of
other families. Where the oriental types gained the
ascendancy it had happened that the successful types
possessed traits specially fitting them to the kind of
fight for existence which the new environment
imposed.
Australian deposits were preserved in the eastern
side of the continent mainly by the outpouring of lava
from volcanoes having covered drift-deposits over wide
areas. Much of the country on which this phenomenon
occurred has been found rich in minerals, and mining
operations have brought to light the material on which
has been built so much of the knowledge gathered by
biologists. Some very interesting and unique instances
of this covering of igneous rock is to be observed in the
western district of Victoria and in the south-eastern
district of South Australia. A chain of extinct vol-
canoes dots this belt of country for more than three
hundred miles, whilst the lava sheets covering the
surrounding country in places take a peculiar crinkled
form, and are known as “stony rises,” the successive,
wave-like ridges being roughly parallel to one another
and attaining to from 10 to 40 feet in height. Many
of the volcanoes have been in active eruption in times
which, as time is reckoned by geologists, were as


yesterday. Resides fossils having been found in the
Silurian deposits beneath the rock, much later specimens,
such as trees identical with species now existing, have
been excavated from mines, several typical instances

having occurred about the Bitfield district,
where gum trees were found, not fossilized,
but preserved in such a state that though
apparently unaltered in shape they fell to
dust when removed. These appeared to
have been buried when still in a living state
and to have been covered with moulten rock
before decomposition had caused any material
changes. In other instances the outpouring
of lava has clearly occurred at times of
great antiquity.
THE QUEENSLAND SECTION.
Accompanying the article on "The
climate of Queensland” appearing in this
volume is a map showing the respective
rainfall belts of the continent. From this
may be gathered the natural divisions in the
flora of the Commonwealth and of Queens-
land. The differences in environment as
between the far interior and the coastal
region are, from a botanical view-point, of
the widest character, and have occasioned
the fundamental divergence between the
flora indigenous respectively to the two
types of country. Abundant rainfall, coupled with
fertile soil and tropical warmth, has produced a coastal
vegetation of a luxuriant and prolific description.
Within a hundred miles or more of the ocean the type
of plants to survive has been made up partly of
quick growers, sometimes of those thrusting their leafy
heads highest from the tangled undergrowth beneath.
others of the climbers able to encircle
within their trailing stems the greatest
quantity of forest giants around, and always
of those best able to compete fcr
space rather than to resist what may be
called the direct attacks of climate. Com-
petition, in the conflict of life in the tropics,
has lain between plant and plant rather than
between all plants and the vagaries of a
hostile environment. But when the botanist
approaches to the dead heart of the continent
he finds quite other influences at play and
quite other botanical results accruing. Away
from the coastal rainfall and approaching
the central desert, where sandhill rolls after
sandhill in parallel line for hundreds of
miles, or where vast arid expanses of bare
plain stretch to the heat-glimmering horizon
as far as the eye can reach, survival value
rests with the capacity to grow with a mini-
mum of moisture and to retain life in a state
of suspension during long periods of com-
plete absence of moisture. Between these

extremes the natural flora of the State bears modifica-
tions fixed according to the affinity of the prevailing
environment to the one or the other extreme of climate.


Whether belonging to the original Australian element
or to the immigrant cluster of families, each surviving
species has found the environment in which it has been
able to carry on the battle for existence by reason of
inborn adaptation to some set of circumstances existing
between the rich soil and arid climate of the interior
and the fertility and copious rainfall of the coast.
There are now something above 200 naturalized
plants flourishing in Queensland. The conditions of the
more prolific regions of the State so closely resemble
those of tropical countries, where a long settlement and
many generations of industry have led to close know-
ledge of the economic use of the natural flora, that the
free importation and successful cultivation of species of
all kinds of plants from abroad sometimes offered the
speediest way for the pioneers of this State to most
rapidly and with least risk turn the generous climate
and soil of the country to its profitable industrial use.
This has caused a partial neglect of indigenous species
which otherwise would have attained to a recognition
of their high value. A typical example of this truism
is provided by the native fruits.
QUEENSLAND TIMBERS.
Until quite recently the politicians and people
of Queensland had barely awakened to the value of
the resources lying untapped in the millions of acres
of mighty forests which were regarded rather as an
impediment in the way of the intending pastoralist or
agriculturist than as a marketable asset of high value.
Even to-day only the haziest notion is possessed by all
but a few botanists and other scientific investigators of the
worth of the local woods, both in variety and number of
economic species and in the approximate quantities of
each available for use.
For ornamental purposes, no less than for all kinds
of building, the forests of Queensland contain an
abundance of supply to support a large and remunera-
tive export trade. The continuance of the import trade
in household and office furniture is a result solely of
neglect to develop a natural resource; whilst the
fact of a larger amount of Queensland-made fur-
niture, or of such articles made elsewhere in the
Commonwealth from Queensland wood, not being sold
for consumption in southern States is further illustra-
tion of the results of the unfortunate habit of utilizing
imported commodities, coupled with a lack of local
enterprise, though the latter condition doubtless is
accounted for by so many other fields awaiting the
enterprise of the capitalist in this most potential of
States.
Of late years the Queensland Government has done
a good deal in the way of opening the eyes of the public
to the rare beauty and almost endless variety of local
timbers by displaying polished specimens at agricultural
shows and exhibitions, both at home and abroad; but
the expenditure of a great deal of capital is certainly
necessary for the development of this latent resource.
When all is said in extenuation of the lack of enterprise
displayed over so many years by capitalists and Govern-
ment in the neglect of this jDromising industry, ground
still remains for wonder at the long continuance of the
Australian import trade in timber for so many purposes
in the face of the cost of transit and the high price
charged to the consumer. So far back as 1895
Mr. A. Meston wrote that Queensland possessed in
her indigenous flora a thousand species of timber
"of all varieties, from the lightest to the heaviest,
the softest to the hardest, in all colours from ivory white
to ebony black, suitable to every purpose for which
timber is used in the civilized world.” And since these
words were written very much subsequent knowledge
has been gathered which, on application, would make
the local timber industry even more profitable than it
could have been a quarter of a century ago.
Owing partly to the large physical dimensions of
the State, as well as to delay in the expansion
of the timber industry, popular confusion still
exists in relation to the classification and names of
species of trees. In many instances identical species
are known by different names in different localities.
With the view of attaining some common understanding
among saw-millers and others, F. M. Bailey, F.L.S., at
that time botanist to the Government, prepared a list
of woods, together with the purposes for which they
were suited, as well as the popular terms by which they
were generally known. Mr. Bailey points out: —"The
arrangement here used is to point out that there are
woods adapted for the various uses to which this material
is applied. The kinds mentioned are a few only out of
the number suitable for the particular purpose, and
many are adapted for other work besides that under
which they may be placed.”
The classification, as given by Mr. Bailey, is as
follows :
Turnery —
Owenia acidula, F. v. M. Sour Plum.
Pleiogynium solandri, Eng. Burdekin Plum.
Acacia pendula, A. Cunn. Weeping Myall.

GRASSES.
From tlie view-point of her industrial history and
her industry as at present existing, the most important
section of the botany of Queensland lies with her grasses
and other fodder plants. No part of the Commonwealth
is so rich in natural pastures as is this State, and few,
if any, parts of the world are richer. In addition to
possessing a phenomenally large number of varieties
the State produces grass unrivalled both for the
rapidity of growth after rain and for its nutrition.
Pastoralists everywhere agree that for stock-breeding,
and particularly for fattening purposes, a mixture of
fodder plants is necessary, and that the best results
usually are obtained from a wide variety of plants.
Among the elements contributing to the success of
grazing enterprise in the north-eastern portion of the
continent is the large total of distinct species of pastures
and herbs available for use on each run. Twenty years
ago A. Meston calculated that 250 distinct species of
grass had been collected in Queensland and classified,
“very few of which could be classified as useless.”
Others have been added, to the list since. In 1844
Leichhardt, the explorer, gathered specimens of seven-
teen species of grass on thirty yards of cattle track
near Ipswich. Bailey, the highest authority on Queens-
land botany, has written that no part of the State can
be said to be destitute of good grass, and Meston wrote
of the “Mitchell” grasses of the interior: —“Their
special value lies in their astonishing vitality, as the
smallest shower of rain produces a remarkable resurrec-
tion,. transforming the presumedly dead plants into
living, green, healthy herbage. Even when dry they
are sweet and nutritious, specially adapted by Nature
to harmonize with their environment, and submit to
floods and droughts with equal equanimity.”
Some unfortunate changes in the proportions of
varieties of grasses growing in the pastoral areas of
Queensland have succeeded the occupation and settle-
ment of the country. These have been ascribed to the
mingled effects of over-stocking and drought. Probably,
however, the same results would have accrued had no
attempts ever been made to put more sheep and cattle
on the land than it was capable of properly carrying;
whilst droughts doubtless occurred with as much severity
and frequence before white men came to the country as
after. The killing-out of certain species of grass was a
necessary concomitant to any kind of pastoral settle-
ment. The presence in the land of a new kind of grass-
eating animal in the numbers which it paid the
pastoralist to stock their runs created a change of
environment destined to produce inevitable changes in
the flora. Sheep and cattle, but more particularly the
former, which are able to eat so much closer to the
roots of the plants, were certain to concentrate their
attentions upon the sweeter kinds of grass in preference
to others. The killing-out, or at least reduction of the
former was, therefore, bound to follow pastoral occu-
pation in many localities. The influences of occupation,
however, except in the case of prickly-pear areas, which
present another problem, have not in any case been
such that there are not plenty of good kinds of grasses
left in every area of real value; whilst, in very
many instances, the effect of stocking has been
thoroughly beneficial, inasmuch as coarse grasses have
gained in usefulness, and by reducing the length of the
pastures the sheep and cattle have increased its density.
Most people who have had any dealings with
pastoral matters in Queensland are familiar with the
name of “Mitchell” grass. In point of fact, several
grasses in different localities are known by this term.
Most of these are kinds of Astrehla, and are peculiar
to the far west. In the Gulf country a favourite grass
is Anthistiria membranacea, known as the Lands-
borough, Barcoo, or red grass. This species possesses
valuable fattening qualities, and stock consume it
greedily when it is in a quite dry condition. It grows
with great rapidity, and is suitable for hay-making.
The satin-top is a highly-nutritious species, which, when
the land is unstocked or only lightly stocked, attains to a
height of from four to six feet. Blue grass ( Andropogon
sericeus) is a nutritious, prolific, and quick-growing kind.
Kangaroo grass (Anthistiria ciliata), which covers so large
an area of Australia, is widely valued in Queensland,
as also are species of the genus Panicum. One of the
latter, P. flavidum, is known as Vandyke grass. Mixed
with these species are found love grasses (Eragrostis).
Unlike the scrub lands of so much of the remainder of
the continent, those of Queensland contain many rich
and easily-digestible grasses, a merit to be justly claimed
also for the swamps.
OILS AND FIBRES.
Useful essential oil is obtained from species of
Queensland Eucalypts. The Bachhousias and the Mela-
leucas are other myrtaceous trees, beside the Eucalypts,


yielding rich essential oil; and the weed popularly known
as “Brisbane Penny Royal,” of the order Lahiatce, gives
7 oz. of sweet oil from each 100 lb. of leaf. The nut-
like fruits of the northern district are so rich in oil as
to render their collection a probably profitable industry
of the future.
Good fibre has been shown to be contained in many
Queensland plants, and in some districts these grow in
considerable quantities. Other plants have been demon-
strated as suitable for pulping for paper-making pur-
poses. This fact, coupled with the prolific nature of the
forests, yields sufficient evidence to justify the inclusion
of paper-making in the list
of the Queensland industries
of the not distant future,
especially in view of the
rapid strides with which the
world’s demand is overtaking
the sources of supply being
exploited at the time of
writing.
FRUITS.
As already mentioned,
the cultivation of indigenous
fruits has been retarded in
Queensland by the ease with
which imported species may
be made to yield their best
results in the State. Other
industries, such as saw mill-
ing, has not been han-
dicapped in this way. It is
easier and cheaper to use local
woods than to use timbers
grown locally from imported
species, partly because of the
length of time which would
be involved in the latter
operation. While the forests
stand awaiting the axe of
the timber-getter, the horti-
culturist, to obtain satisfac-
tory results, would not only have to plant and grow
the local fruit trees, which would take as long as to
similarly cultivate imported species; but he would need
to develop the former by means of selection spread over
generations. It is true that many local fruits are
palatable in their wild state and contain considerable
food value, but the tendency is all in the direction of
inducing the private horticulturist, working for his own
profit, to permit indigenous species to lie in obscurity
whilst he markets kinds already familiar to the con-
sumer, and which have inherited the accumulated
labours of many generations of conscious and
e 2
unconscious selection and culling. Yet the Queensland
forests contain many native fruits which will one day
be highly favoured by the inhabitants, as well as be
exported to other countries.
Among the indigenous fruits should be mentioned the
Davidsonian plum (fruit of Davidsonia pruriens), which
is as large as a goose egg, very juicy, and refreshing.
The Herbert River cherry (Antidesma Dallachyanum) is
used for making jelly described as being equal to the
best red-currant. Several other indigenous fruits are
used for jam-making, especially Eugenias. A fruit of
North Queensland, named Garcinia Mestoni, is allied
to the mangosfceen. It is the
size of a large apple and
is very pleasantly flavoured.
Two members of the orange
family are indigenous to the
State, one of them being
found in the southern district.
In addition, the State pos-
sesses various kinds of edible
mushrooms.
MEDICINAL PLANTS.
A remarkable plant of
the west, popularly known
as “Pituri” or “Pitcherie”
(Duboisia Hopwoodi), may
be mentioned here. This
species grows as a low bush,
and the young shoots were
used by the blacks, who col-
lected them after a passing
fire had scorched the leaves
and older branches. The
shoots were dried and then
carried about in bags,
perhaps for hundreds of
miles and were treated
as being a very valuable
commodity by the natives,
who were in the habit
of bartering them for such
things as were most prized among them. The plant
was used, after being mixed with a certain ash, by
being chewed at corrohories a piece being passed
from black to black, each of whom held it in his mouth
for a few seconds. On long journeys a man would carry
a small piece of the stuff with him, finding that by
chewing it occasionally fatigue and other hardship were
more easily endured. At other times the plant could
be made to act as sleeping-draughts do on Europeans.
But no effect was produced in the direction of producing
courage. The use of pituri was observed by Kennedy,
the explorer, in 1847, and also by members of the
RIBBON FERN ON STAGHORN FERN.


Burke and Wills Expedition. King, the survivor of
that ill-fated party, said to chew the plant made him
forget his misery and the physical hardship which he
was suffering. In fact, he found that the plant acted
like alcohol. This is borne out by observation of its
effects on the natives. When one of them consumes a
quantity in excess of the ordinary he falls into so heavy
a sleep that he can be aroused only with difficulty. The
country on which the pituri grows lies on both sides of
the western Queensland border, whilst myoporoides,
another species of Duboisia, is indigenous to the eastern
coast of the continent. Meston says the active principle
is an alkaloid called “Duboisine,” possessing the same
power of dilating the eye as atropine of belladonna, but
of far greater potency. It was first introduced into
medical practice by Dr. Petit, of Paris, in 1878.
Active medicinal properties have been found in a
number of Queensland plants, and the flora of the
State offers a wide field for further investigation along
that line. For inhalation in phthisis the oil of the
broad-leafed tea-tree (Melaleuca leucadendron) has been
used as an antiseptic. The clarified gum of the white
gum tree (E. hcemastoma) has been found to possess
properties for healing cuts and old sores. A check on
diarrhoea has been discovered in the exuding crystallized
gums of bloodwood trees, Moreton Bay ash, and some
other Queensland species of Eucalypts. The local fever-
bark tree (Alsfonia constricta) yields a powerful tonic
of use in cases of general debility. It has also been
used effectively in the earlier stages of typhoid. The
leaves of Duboisia myoporoides yield an extract largely
availed of in ophthalmic practice.
GENERAL FEATURES.
The general, and what may be termed superficial,
character of the Queensland flora has often been
described, but frequent inaccuracies have been dropped
into by travellers and others not familiar with the
research work carried out by Australian botanists. The
popular names given to many indigenous species alone
are enough to throw the unwary off the track leading
to reliable information. For instance, the desert sand-
stone country produces a plant which, though called
spinifex is not a spinifex ; whilst a real spinifex found
in the coastal district is not called a spinifex. The
so-called silky oak belongs to the family of beef-woods
and honeysuckles. The ash of Queensland has no rela-
tionship with the real ash. The black currant belongs
to the potato family, and the blackberry is a ver-
benaceous plant. The list might be continued almost
indefinitely.
A common popular error lies in the belief that all
the trees are evergreen, and that the bark, instead of
the leaves, is shed annually. This generalization,
though nearly accurate, is not completely so. In the
Cape York Peninsula the following trees are deciduous:
—Cochlospermum Gillivrcei, Bombax Malabaricurn
(silky cotton tree), Stercidia quadrifda, Melia composita
(white cedar), Cedrela toona (red cedair), Sesbania
yrandiflora, Erythrina indica, Albizzia procera,
Sarcocephalus cordatus (Leichhardt tree), Euca-
lyptus platyphylla (popular gum-tree), and Ficus
colossea. A peculiarity of Quensland trees in general
lies in their leaves being set edgeways on the stems, so
that both sides of the leaves are alike. This greatly
reduces the shade-yielding properties of the foliage.
The heterogeneous beauty and luxuriant variety of
the Queensland flora may be easily inferred from its
close relationship with that of India. Hooker estimated
that there were 500 Indian plants in Australia. Since
that calculation was made others have been discovered.
The tropical jungles of Queensland contain foliage more
superb than that of any other part of the continent
and rivalling the splendour of the most picturesque
wilds of longer-known lands of similar climate. There
also, as in the more southern portions of the State,
wild flowers of rare loveliness and fragrant perfume
stand perhaps unsurpassed. Ferns vary from the most
delicate and perfect kinds to magnificent giant species
bearing fronds of enormous size. The tangled forests
are frequently rendered impenetrable to the foot of
man by richly-hued climbers, which weave about the
lower branches of the mighty trees and hang in great
festoons. A seemingly endless variety of bright colours
and a magnificent density of foliage, in which bright
flowers, beautiful orchids, and great variegated leaves
intermingle, present scenes of fairylike loveliness. At
certain seasons of the year the open country is rendered
beautiful by a blaze of wild flowers, among which may
be mentioned the Darling Pea, other leguminous plants,
various Pimeleas, Goodenias, terrestrial orchids, and
liliaceous and amaryllidaceous plants. The lagoons are
spangled with beautiful water lilies, whilst, except
where dearth of rain has restricted growth, pasture
lands display a wealth of green remarkable alike to
visitors from southern States and from overseas.
A distinctly Australian order of trees found in
great profusion in Queensland is the Proteacece, or silky
oak family. The timber from species of this family is
noted for the beautiful lines of its grain and the rich and
varied hues it takes when polished. The trees are
known popularly in the various districts to which they
are indigenous as beef-woods, honeysuckles, needle-trees,
Queensland nuts, geebungs, tulip flowers, wooden pears,
and spanglewoods. This order is found also in Cape
Colony, but otherwise, with few exceptions, in no other
part of the world. Yet at one time it was widely scat-
tered, and its fossil remains have been found in several
parts of Europe. Another order, which is of still
greater importance in Queensland, is Myrtacece ,


represented in Great Britain by small plants, but in
this State by the gums, ironbarks, bloodwoods, boxes,
peppermints, mahoganies, tea-trees, scrub cherries, and
bottle-brushes. Eighteen species of true grape-bearing
vines are indigenous to Queensland, and some of them
produce fruit, while living in a wild state, as large as
marbles. No doubt, if culti-
vated and subjected to selec-
tion, these could be turned
into new species of consider-
able value, as was the case
with types discovered in
America. There are two
Queensland species of limes
and five of raspberries. The
Chenopodiacece are repre-
sented in Queensland by the
extremely valuable salt and
cotton bushes, which grow in
the arid west, and besides
constituting a nutritious food
of which stock are very fond,
hold exceptional drought-re-
sisting properties.
Among naturalized plants,
some have found their way
to these shores by accident,
in spite of desire on the
part of the early settlers to
keep them out, and others
have been deliberately im-
ported. Among the former
are noxious weeds. The most
destructive naturalized plants,
so far as Queensland is concerned, certainly is the
prickly pear, to which a special article is devoted in
this work. It is no over-statement to allege that the
State Government is faced with no more difficult nr
important problem to solve in connection with the
pastoral industry of the country than that of the
eradication of prickly pear from tlie areas of which it has
taken possession and the prevention of it destroying
the productive value of other country. Other of the
imported noxious plants have found the environment
into which they have been transplanted remarkably
suited to their needs, and they have developed a
fecundity not previously pos-
sessed by them in countries
to which they were indigenous
and which contained many
parasites' and other natural
enemies which have kept
them in check. Thus the
Bathurst burr, which was
brought from Valparaiso in
the manes and tails of
pampas horses, first took
root in Australia along the
flats of the Murrumbidgee
in southern New South Wales
in 1850; whilst no more
than six years later, so
widely had it spread, that
seventeen men were being
employed to cope with it
on “Goomburra” station,
on the Darling Downs in
Queensland.
Among valuable species
which have spread widely
is couch grass, which is
supposed to have reached here
in horse fodder brought
from India, and it was first
seen growing in 1834 in Sydney. Four years later it
appeared in Brisbane. Italian rye grass was introduced
to New South Wales by Dr. Sherwin, who grew it at
Mittagong, from which centre it has since spread to
other districts, and has manifested valuable stock-
fattening properties.

THE QUEENSLAND ABORIGINES.

INTRODUCTION.
The border line which separates Queensland from
other neighbouring Australian States is one purely of
convenience, and although the geographical delineation
has some slight significance on account of existing local
conditions the original natives of Queensland show a
wonderful resemblance to the aborigines of other parts
of Australia, and consequently represent one race-
people or ethnic group, and are recognized as of a “very
primitive human type.” As to the origin of the Aus-
tralian race we have no conclusive evidence, though some
surmise that it is of a low Caucasian type. It would be


impossible to do justice to the subject here without much
conjecture and quoting many conflicting opinions. Skull
measurements, however, clearly show that our aborigines
are an impure race, standing considerably higher than
the Neanderthal man but lower than those of Egisheim
and the giant Cro-Magnon of prehistoric times. The
aborigines are nomadic hunters, rarely wandering far
from the narrow confines of their tribal territory, and
differing only from one another in certain degrees of
culture, viz., in physical and mental characteristics;
their ethnic characters being the same. These primitive
people belong to a doomed race, and the rapidity with
which they are passing is appalling. In the very early
days before civilization began to leave its mark upon
these people, families clubbed together in numbers of
200 to 300 for purposes of mutual protection and for
other facilities; now hordes of this size are seldom seen,
and the individual, however noble a savage he may
appear to be, is in his natural state sad, lazy, and
incapable of hard work, cares only for himself, though
perhaps extending in a lesser degree his patronage to
the small groups of some few families within the sphere
of his immediate protection.
The Queensland aborigines, together with other
members of the Australian race, have been shut off from
every kind of contact with the outer world from time
immemorial, and consequently, during the vast period
of time allotted to their evolution, have progressed very
slowly; and though they possess a language they are not
able to transmit their thoughts rapidly, but are forced
to use many round-about methods to express their
concrete ideas. The native, as we know him to-day, may
be able to count in a crude way by means of his fingers
up to ten, but when first discovered was unable to count
beyond two or three, any number above that becoming
“many,” or something of that sort, which with the
assistance of signs and gestures was calculated to aid
the understanding.
Writing in the ordinary sense of the word was
unknown, though we possess evidence of the use of
mnemonic objects in the so-called letter or message-
stick, and though they are capable of pictographic art
their rock drawings are of a very crude nature.
With the exception of the half-wild dingo,
domestic animals were unknown to them, and they were
forced to subsist on an irregular food supply, which
consisted mostly of fruits and other vegetable substances
together with animals caught in the chase. Their diet
also included grubs, insects, fish, etc., and it was the
duty of the women to collect, and if necessary, though
rarely, to cook the food for their men folk. The
aboriginal’s thoughts are only of the moment, and the
future is left to take care of itself. They had no know-
ledge of the cultivation of the soil, and not a single
case has ever been known of a wild Queenslander
planting any seed with a view to supplying a future
shortage of food.
Queensland differs from its neighbours in the com-
parative simplicity of its public life, and yet supersti-
tion stalked rampant through the land, filling the native
with fear and making him attribute all that he could not
understand to some baneful influence of magic; it is
thus he tries to explain all the numerous phenomena of
Nature, and the native magician or medicine-man
makes his people believe that he is capable of accom-
plishing the impossible in scores of different ways; thus
—to give two instances only —he can produce rain by
magic, or he is able to introduce “spirit children” into
the bosom of some unsuspecting female, when circum-
stances are favourable. But with the advent of civiliza-
tion these and many other magical practices are the
first to retreat into the background. The power of the
medicine-men is limited; there is no hereditary chieftain-
ship, and there are no elaborate totemic ceremonies;
there is no society of sorcerers and magic is of the
individual type. All magic powers are transmitted
orally and handed down from one medicine-man to
another. An example of private magic is associated with
the pointing and singing of the death bone, which is
calculated to reduce the victim, provided only he is
aware of it, to the lowest possible ebb and to produce
death unless some greater and more powerful
than he is able to adopt some counteracting
method, each acting perhaps quite unconsciously of
the other.
The native loves his corroborees, in which he
indulges for purposes of amusement and initiation. In
fact they are an essential element in his life, and
represent “the play, the song, and the dance.” It is
a feature of such gatherings that the performers were
elaborately decorated with feathers and their bodies
marked with designs of white and red clay, totemic
devices becoming less frequent with the march of
civilization, and being replaced in later years by
fantastic figures of a more or less modern type.
SOMATIC AND MORPHOLOGICAL
CHARACTERS.
In the matter of physical characteristics of the
natives there is some considerable variation. The native
possesses under ordinary circumstances a very fine set of
white teeth, which contrast markedly with his chocolate-
brown skin. He possesses curly hair, and the men usually
have an abundant growth of beard, and the hair on the
neck and back is particularly abundant, and often of a
soft, silky nature. Their stature varies somewhat, 5 ft.
5| in. might be taken as a fair average. They have
slender arms and legs, and possess the characteristic
dolicho-cephalic (narrow) head with an average index of

the platyrrhine (flat) nose, and thick lips. The
superciliary ridges (overhanging brows) are strongly
developed. The women are rarely seen with much hair;
custom demands that it should be periodically
cut to provide the menfolk, especially the son-in-law,

In temperament they
are like great overgrown

of tender feelings and

intensity. It is interesting
to note in this connection
how very enthusiastically
whites of both sexes speak
of the native men, women,
and children whom they
have had in their employ
for many years. A cor-
respondent only recently
in reply to one of my en-
quiries wrote : —“Although

lander resembles not the Negro but the low Cau-
casian type, from which some urge that he is
descended. The influence of environment in Queens-
land cannot be disregarded, seeing what an important
part it has played in the development of the
race in the past, particularly noticeable in the effect of
the food supply upon camp-life in general. When food

is scarce the native has naturally further to roam, and
his characteristically thin legs become thinner still—all
amusements, corroborees, and even the functions of
reproduction are suspended until some such food as

season of festivities, and the world is young once more.
SOCIOLOGICAL CHARACTERS.
Food Supply.
Queensland being at times subject to drought, the
food supply of the Queensland aboriginal, as has been
mentioned, cannot be regarded as of a very stable
nature, and there are times when the women particu-
larly are forced to go hungry. At such a time the edible
earths would come in
handy, and we know that
women are frequently forced
to still their appetites by
this means. There is no
doubt that within the
past the natives indulged
in cannibalism, and found
human flesh to their liking
—an indulgence probably
more due to superstition
than to actual necessity,
and perhaps to the neces-
sity for the restriction of
progeny, one of the greatest
curses of this doomed race.
There is very little cooking
necessary, occasionally the
seeds ground into flour
and made into cakes are
placed on the red-hot
embers, but otherwise their
food is mostly eaten raw.
The poisonous elements in
certain foodstuffs were eli-
minated by • a process of
careful washing in water.
The native possesses no
pottery, and more generally uses the larger leaves,
sometimes coolamuns and the like, as food utensils 1 .
Fire-Making*.
Fire was procured by the rubbing of two sticks
together until the friction caused a spark sufficient to
light a portion of the inflammable material which was
placed there for that purpose.
Habitations.
Their habitations varied in different localities
according to the material available at the time, the bark
of trees or the grasses growing in the neighbourhood


being used for the shelter of their native huts, which
might be cupola or peak-shaped, or even a simple
'‘lean-to.”
Clothing.
Their clothing was of the scantiest, though they
were fond of ornament, and enhanced their beauty by
decorations either hung on the body itself or by
bodily ornamentation. Men and women usually wore a
frontlet and a human-hair belt, and sometimes a meagre
covering in front; such pubic covers were seldom seen
under ordinary circumstances, but were usually worn
at corroborees.
Tools and Weapons.
They require but few tools for the purpose of
obtaining food, and such as they have are quite adequate
in a stupefied condition to the surface. Offensive and
defensive weapons are numerous, and comprise the
fighting spear, clubs, long-handed "swords,” boomer-
angs, throwing-sticks, the large characteristic spear-
shield of Northern Queensland, and the smaller "club’'
shields. In a close hand-to-hand fight, as the result of a
private dispute, the stone knife would be brought into
play by both parties.
When shifting camp all equipment is left behind
with the exception of such implements as are essential
for food production; perhaps the man—always on the
alert—would carry three spears and one wommera or
spear-thrower, and the gin all the surplus tools and
utensils, including the water-bag, yam sticks, and
boomerangs.
QUEENSLAND NATIVES.
for the purpose. These are of stone and wood, and
comprise grinding stones (lower and upper), stone
hammers, stone knives, stone axes, scrapers, and such
like, whilst the wooden club or nulla nulla was often
used as a missile in order with a well-directed blow to
fell some piece of game to the ground. Hunting spears
would also be used for this purpose. The boomerang,
doubtless in the past developed from the throwing-stick,
one of the most distinctive of all Australian weapons, is
used in various forms, and is a very formidable tool for
the hunting of game. A weapon of similar nature was
used by ancient Egyptian fowlers when killing wild duck.
The native is also an expert fisherman, and for this
purpose a spear, which he throws with wonderful
accuracy, would be used, or the method of poisoning
some waterhole would be adopted, causing the fish to rise
Navigation.
The native is not a navigator, but possessed a crude
raft for his short journeys in landlocked waters, now
rarely, if ever, seen. His single-sheet bark canoe, of
purely Australian origin, was chiefly propelled by
paddles of mangrove wood. Along the northern coasts
of Queensland the much safer dug-out was preferred.
It is now used with an outrigger, probably introduced
from New Guinea.
Recreations.
The native, though nearly always sad, is quite
capable of appreciating a joke, and has a distinctively
humorous side to his nature. He loves games and sports,
in which he is assisted by the younger members of his
tribe, who are from infancy taught to be experts in the


use of their toy weapons, and who by mimicking their
elders develop a great efficiency before even they are
called into man’s estate. As sportsmen their dexterity
is exceptional, and in tracking and running-down their
prey they manifest unusual skill.
Initiation.
As soon as the youth is old enough he is “made” a
man, and for some time secluded from all association
with women and girls. He has to submit to certain
INITIATION CEREMONY.
initiation ceremonies, many of which are of a very
painful character. He is given instruction in the details
of his totem and tabu, by which he learns that certain
foods are retained for the exclusive use of the elder
members of the tribe; he is shown the bull-roarer, and
has its uses explained to him.
Family Life.
Once initiated into the mysteries of manhood, he
is free to marry, and usually sets about to acquire for
himself a wife from such tribes into which he is legally
allowed to marry, carefully avoiding for fear of con-
sequences such members of the group who are not of the
class (clan) with whom marital relations are at any time
permissible. Marriage by capture is now rare in Queens-
land, though it was doubtless fairly general years ago;
by far the more common method was by arrangement
made by some close relations such as brothers of the
parties, etc., in any case the marriage custom of the
tribe should always regulate the whole method of
procedure. The children of such a marriage are often
made much of, and are often spoilt, always provided, of
course, that the scarcity of the food supply does not
demand the death of the infant in the first place. The
husband is often fond of his wife in his own peculiar
way, but should she in any way cross him or rouse his
anger he will not hesitate to deal out to her such blows
as he may consider essential to the proper chastisement
of his spouse. It has been said that on the whole the
family life is a moderately happy one. Hospitality is
certainly one of their virtues, and friendly visitors
are often entertained right royally by some tribes,
even to the temporary loan of a wife—their sincerest
expression of it.
Superstition and Magic.
Owing to the native belief that the death of any
individual member of the tribe is due to the direct evil
intentions of someone, it is not to be wondered at that
“death-feuds” pass from one generation to another
intermittently, and so the native lives in a constant
dread of injuries either by some magical means or by the
unseen hand of some enemy who may be on the lookout
to avenge some family wrong, real or imaginary, and
though revenge may not overtake him for some time,
sooner or later the inevitable is sure to happen. The
deeply-rooted superstitious belief in magic and superior
beings is entirely universal in Australia, and conse-
quently it is almost impossible for us to realize to what
extent superstition and magic plays a part in the
aboriginal’s life, and the so-called medicine-man is the
main medium through which both good and evil magic
are practised. Beliefs such as these are instrumental in
bringing about rites and practices, together with all
other ceremonies, especially those appertaining to
MAN PERFORMING MAGIC (POINTING BONE).
initiation, death, and burial, and the native goes to his
grave as a result of it.
Religion.
Religion in the ordinary sense the aboriginal has
none. The belief in an imaginary Being or Spirit is
mainly the outcome of fear. Instead of ancestor worship
we find a universal dread of the dead, a fear lest the
dead man should return and worry and annoy or in
some way injure a former companion. Death is understood


to be but a temporary, though prolonged, absence
of the spirit from the body, and during that period
methods of keeping the wanderer under control are
found necessary, as is shown by the removal of the
kneecaps, during the mummification process, adopted
by some Queensland aboriginals.* This delicate surgical
operation removes all possibility of future “walking-
about” and consequent annoyance, and to make this
doubly sure they adopt the custom of tying the corpse
up tightly in a sitting position (Northern Queensland).
Though not an object of worship, the sun nevertheless
exercises a beneficial influence upon the aboriginal. It
is with deliberate intent that members of certain tribes
sleep facing the sun and that they place their mummified
corpses in the same direc-
tion, because in the first
beginning of things, so
they say, “Sun bring up
fella first time.” The
Queensland aboriginal, how-
ever, reverences the so-cal-
led “Daramulun” (probably
akin to Buddai of the
Moreton Bay natives), a
“sky being” of superior
powers—their nearest ap-
proach to a god —whose
voice finds expression in
the bull-roarer, and pre-
sides over certain initiation
ceremonies, and who takes
care of the men’s shadows
when they go to him in
death. The regard and
reverence of the Queensland
aboriginal for his totem
(mostly an animal) need
not be dilated upon here;
suffice it to mention that
if the subject of totemisan
had a “religious” signi-
ficance in the early days,
tribes have been so broken up and dispersed that
the totum animal has lost most of its significance,
and omens are no longer given by it, the guidance of
recognized authorities and the rigid discipline, dictated
by the public opinion of the clan or totem, however,
remains a reality.
Death and Burial.
Customs appertaining to death and burial are
numerous, and vary in different localities. Whenever
death, then, occurs it is not regarded as the result of

rare peculiarity is housed in the Queensland Museum.
purely natural causes, but it is attributed to the revenge
of sorcerers. The native is not naturally subjected to
many diseases, but whenever, through contact with
civilization, he becomes attacked he falls a ready prey.
As soon as the breath leaves the body of a sick man
the man’s hut is pulled down, and the body is prepared
for burial by being tied up. In Northern Queensland
men of importance were mummified and placed in a
sitting position in a hollow tree or cave out of the reach
of the dingoes. Very rarely were children treated with
such courtesy, women apparently never. The dead were
buried in trees or caves, either wholly or in part; after
the flesh had been eaten the bones or a portion of these
were carried about for months prior to burial. The
widow mourns the loss of
her husband, covers herself
with mud, and avoids the
ordinary avocation of life
for a time, but as soon as
the days of her mourning
are over she becomes the
wife of one of the younger
brothers of her late hus-
band. In Southern Queens-
land a custom obtained
of skinning the corpse and
preserving the same in
memory of a relative;
when a man was killed, or
died, in the vigour of man-
hood, his nearest relatives
summoned all their friends
to a feast, and the body
was skinned, cut up, and
devoured amidst the wail-
ing of women and the
mournful chanting of men,
who detailed in melancholy
and monotonous strains the
virtues of the deceased
and the chief occurrences
of his life. The skin
was stretched upon two spears and rubbed with grease
and charcoal in order to assist in its preservation.* Not
infrequently the mother carries the dead body of her
child about with her until it has become dried up and
mummy-like, after which it is disposed of in some secure
spot. The dead are seldom mentioned by name again,
for they think it would not do; some mischief might
result, and the living have no desire to let the dead hear
them, to come and see who it was that called, and what
was wanted.
* A specimen in good state of preservation was obtained
from a cave in the Blackall Range, and is in the Queensland
Museum.

The History of Queensland.
CHAPTER I.
DISCOVERY OF AUSTRALIA.
THE discovery of Australia is shrouded in mystery
both as to date and to the identity of the
navigator who first penetrated so far from known
portions of the globe as to find the existence
of the great southern continent. For many years
Abel Tasman was believed to have been the earliest
mariner to sight these shores; but about the time
of Flinders it came to be recognized that the
shores of the Gulf of Carpentaria had been seen by
other Dutchmen about March of 1606, and again, some
months later, by the Spaniard, Torres, who sighted the
hills of Cape York Peninsula.
Historians now consider a much earlier discovery
of the continent to be established. That the Portuguese
had reached Australia prior to 1540 may be considered
as certain. The land was known to them as Great Java
or Terra Australis. Major, the well-known authority
on the history of Australian discovery, writes: —"Our
surmises, therefore, lead us to regard it as highly
probable that Australia was discovered by the Portuguese
between the years 1511 and 1529, and almost to a
demonstrable certainty that it was discovered before
the year 1542.”
Among other evidence of the continent’s existence
having been proved during the sixteenth century is the
following passage from C. Wytfliet’s "Descriptionis
Ptolemaicae Augmentum Louain,” 1598:—"The Aus-
tralis Terra is the most southern of all lands, and is
separated from New Guinea by a narrow strait. Its
shores are hitherto but little known, since after one
voyage and another that route has been deserted, and
seldom is the country visited, unless when sailors are
driven there by storms. The Australis Terra begins at
two or three degrees from the equator, and is ascertained
by some to be of so great an extent that, if it were
thoroughly explored, it would be regarded as a fifth
part of the world.”
Further testimony pointing in the same direction is
to be found from six ancient maps which, immediately
below Java, show a large continent of which the general
outline approximates the coast of Australia. These
charts bear strong internal evidence of having been made
prior to 1540. The earliest of them, which is reproduced
in this volume, was presented to the British Museum by
Sir Joseph Banks. Two of the others are in the
British Museum. The Rev. Julian E. Tennison Woods,
in his “Plistory of the Discovery and Exploration of
Australia,” expresses the conviction that all six are
copies of a French map, though the names of the
geographical features where marked are, with few
exceptions, Portuguese. These differences between the
outline of the continent shown on these drawings and
what we know to be the actual coastline is explained by
Mr. Major in the following words: —"With respect to
longitude, it may be advanced that, with all the
discrepancies observed in the maps here presented, there
is no other country but Australia lying between the
same parallel and of the same extent, between the east
coast of Africa and the west coast of America, and that
Australia in reality does lie between the same meridians
as the great mass of the country here laid down.”
The conclusion to be drawn from the evidence is
consistent with what would be expected to occur as a
result of the progress of navigation in other portions of
the globe. It was by the beginning of the sixteenth
century that a jDassage had been found round the Cape
of Good Hope, and a remunerative trade was being
carried on with the East Indies. Prominent in these
undertakings were the Portuguese. Visits were more
than likely paid to Australia by ships blown
out of their course too far south, and of which no
records have been handed down to posterity. It is to
be recollected that the portions of the coast most likely
to be visited, namely, those of the north-west, are of an
inhospitable appearance and unlikely to encourage
further investigation, the shore being low and sandy
and bearing a striking contrast to the vegetation-laden
islands with which explorers to these southern regions
had become more familiar. Moreover, the chances were
all against the navigators, not sailing with the set
purpose of discovering a new land, ever becoming aware
that the part of the continent which they happened to
have sighted or landed upon was not merely another
of the many southern islands. Probably not a few of


these daring sailors who set out in tiny ships which
to-day we would compare to cockle shells, left their
bones along the arid coast, where food was scarce and
water often difficult or impossible to find. The Spanish
probably shared in the earliest voyages to Australia,
but for international reasons the results of their investi-
gations were carefully concealed. The Dutch, however,
played a prominent part.
Claims to the discovery of Australia have been
made for navigators of dates far earlier than the
sixteenth century, though the foundations of these are
The theory has been advanced that Binot Paul-
mier de Gonneville touched at the Australian coast
in 1503. After rounding the Cape of Good Hope
this navigator encountered storms which carried him
far to the north-east, and when he was overtaken
by calm he had lost all knowledge of his bearings,
lie reached a large country, which he called
Southern India, and he remained there for a period of
six months, being hospitably treated by the natives,
and ultimately setting out on his return voyage with
one of the native princes on board. An English corsair

not now believed to rest on fact. In the thirteenth
century Marco Polo described large islands to the south-
east of Java, which were supposed to have been found
by the Chinese. Some colour is lent to the contention
that Celestials were the finders of Australia by the
fact that at that period China was engaged in carrying
on a large trade with the East Indies. It is, however,
probably that Mr. Marsden (the translator of Marco
Polo) and Mr. Major, are correct in their theory that
the southern countries alluded to in reality were the
Indian Archipelago.
plundered the ship, and the journals were lost, but a
declaration as to the facts was made by De Gonneville,
and after being corroborated by his officers it was sent
to the French Admiralty. Madagascar is now considered
to be the country to which De Gonneville in reality
refers. The contention that he reached Australia is
untenable in the face of the inhabitants having been
described as well advanced in civilization, a description
certainly not applicable to the natives of Western
Australia, which is the coast he would have touched if
he actually came into contact with Australia.


The discovery of Australia in 1520 has been claimed
to be one of the results of the voyage round the world
of Magalhaens in the ship “Vittoria.” Magalhaens,
after doubling Cape Horn, sailed westward, and
describes a large continent which he sighted to the south
of Java. The description applies with fair accuracy to
the coast of New Guinea, but certainly is not an
account of Australia. Though the discovery of
the continent in all probability rests with the Portu-
guese, it is on other and surer bases than that advanced
on behalf of Magalhaens.
The sixteenth century had passed before much more
than the bare fact of the existence of the southern
continent was known. In keeping secret what little
knowledge of the continent they had, the Portuguese
were actuated by considerations arising out of an
agreement with the Spaniards. The two countries had
decided to recognize an arbitrary line, the discoveries
on one side of it being the legitimate property of Spain,
and the discoveries on the other side being the right of
Portugal. It happened that Australia was on the
Spanish side of the line. The Portuguese were probably
anxious to keep the Spaniards ignorant of the new
continent, because they feared a trading settlement
might be established which would compete with the
interests of Moluccas, which the Portuguese had recently
claimed and obtained from Spain by reason of the same
agreement as was keeping the hands of the Portuguese
off Australia, in addition to a payment in money by
Portugal.
A new period of discovery begins with about 1595,
when Alvaro de Mendana sailed from Peru for the
purpose of founding a colony in the Solomon Islands.
Accompanying him was Fernandez de Quiros, who filled
the position of chief pilot. The expedition was not
successful. The navigators failed to locate the Solomon
Islands, but they discovered Santa Cruz, where efforts
were made to found a settlement. The attempt led to
the death of Mendana.
A result of the voyage was to direct the attention
of De Quiros to the existence of the great southern
continent, and it was largely he who laid the foundations
for future achievements. De Quiros, mistaking Santa
Cruz for what is now known as Australia, applied to
the Viceroy of Peru for assistance towards making
further investigations. The viceroy referred De Quiros
to Phillip 111., and armed him with letters in support
of his application. The monarch granted what was
asked of him, and the navigator returned to Peru
with the necessary authority. As a result, two large
ships and a smaller craft sailed from Callao under
the command of De Quiros at the end of 1605. The
second largest of the vessels was commanded by Luis
Vaez de Torres, after whom the strait to the north of
Cape York Peninsula has been named. The first
important result from the expedition was the discovery
of the New Hebrides, which were concluded to be the
looked-for continent, and were named Tierra Austral
del Espiritu Sancto. While at the New Hebrides the
ships separated, and the vessel commanded by Torres
continued the westward voyage unaccompanied by
either of the other ships, and in August, 1606, sailed
through the passage which now bears the name of
Torres. Torres describes the passage and the land to
the southward, which there is little room for doubt was
Cape York Peninsula. After leaving the New Hebrides,
which he found to be islands, he sighted what was
mistaken for the south coast of Papua, but was in
reality the Louisiade Archipelago. “From these,” he
writes, “we went along 300 leagues of coast, and
diminished the latitude which brought us into 9°.
From hence we fell into a bank of from three to nine
fathoms, which extends along the coast to 7|° S. lat.,
and the end of it is in s°. We could not go further on
for the many shoals and great currents, so we were
obliged to sail south-west in that depth to 11° S. lat.
There is all over it an archipelago of islands without
number, by which we passed, and the end of the
eleventh day the bank became shoaler. There were
very large islands, and there appeared more, to the
southward. They were inhabited by black people, very
corpulent, and naked. Their arms were lances and
arrows and clubs of stone, ill-fashioned. We could not
get any of these weapons. We caught in all this land
twenty persons of different nations, that with them we
might be able to give a better account to your Majesty.
They give much notice of other people, though, as yet,
they do not make themselves well understood.” It has
been thus concluded that Torres was the first white man
to gaze on the eastern coast and inland heights of what
now forms the State of Queensland. This opinion,
however, has not been universally adopted. It was the
opinion of Major, but the Rev. Julian E. Tennison
Woods points out that the natives are not corpulent,
and he says that such a thing as a bow is unknown
among them in the whole extent of the continent, and
nearly so in the adjacent islands. On the other hand,
it has been claimed that bows and arrows are sometimes
seen among a tribe at the extreme end of Cape York,
which settled there from the Darnley Islands. Mr. J. S.
Battye, public librarian to Western Australia, from
whose pen was published a history of that State in
1912, and who devotes a chapter to the early dis-
coveries of Australia, in the light of the latest evidence
holds to the belief that, despite the references of
Torres to islands, what he really saw was the coast of
Queensland.
Subsequently Torres sailed through the straits to
the north of Cape York, and he demonstrated that the
continent was separated by water from New Guinea.


Meanwhile Quiros had returned to Callao, which he
reached nine months after he had left it. He continued
to petition the Government for money for another
expedition, but his representations were not entertained.
Torres was unfavourably received at Manilla. His
despatch, which is the only record extant of his voyage,
was found by the British among the archives of the
Spanish Government at Manilla.
Meanwhile other investigations in southern seas
were proceeding. An important factor contributing to
the accumulation of geographical knowledge which was
to mark the next century lay in the formation of
the Dutch East India Company in 1602. This
was the beginning of an era of activity by the Dutch
in southern seas.
The first Dutch
ship to cleave the
desolate waters of
the Gulf of Car-
pentaria was the
yacht ‘ ‘Duyphen. ’ ’
On November 18,
1605, she was
despatched from
Bantam to explore
the coast of New
Guinea. She fol-
lowed a course
which was believed
to be west of that
country to 19° 45'
lat. The coast was
described as being
inhospitable and
inhabited by war-
like blacks, who
succeeded in mur-
dering some of the
crew. Lack of pro-
visions caused the
voyage to be dis-
continued. Flinders says that the course taken
by this ship lay within the Gulf of Carpentaria,
and that the land described was a short distance
to the south-west of Cape York. The date of
this expedition to the coast of Queensland was.
just five months earlier than the visit of Torres,
and the crew of the “Duyphen” were thus the
first white men to land on the soil of this portion
of the continent. The separate visits to the unknown
wilds of Northern Queensland of two independent
explorers from different nations, at a time when the
existence of the land was unknown, and when the
hardships and dangers of long voyages were so great,
constitutes a remarkable coincidence.
From the beginning of the seventeenth century the
discoveries made by the Dutch in the region of Australia
gathered thick and fast. In the ordinary course of their
trading voyages to and from Bantam, merchantmen
incurred considerable chances of coming within sight
of the continent, for they passed almost within the same
longitude, and ships of the type used in those early
days were liable to be blown out of their course for far
greater distances than separated the trade route from
the north-western shores of the great southern land.
Many a vessel must have left her battered fragments
to rot on the barren and uninviting shore of the west,
with no survivor to tell the tale of how she had met
disaster in the wild fury of some dark night when
the navigator had
considered himself
far from land or
rock. There would,
indeed, be little
chances of the
stories of these
grim tragedies of
the unexplored sea
reaching civi-
lized communities,
for sailors landing
on the shore alive
would probably
either die from
lack of food and
water, or would
fall in with hos-
tile blacks, whose
general inclination
was to murder
white men when
they could.
Among ships
to bring away
accounts of the
western coast of
the continent was the “Endraght,” which was com-
manded by Dirk Hartog, who landed at Shark Bay,
which was afterwards made familiar by the discoveries
of Dampier. Dirk Hartog left an inscription on a tin
plate on the northern end of the island which now
bears the name of his ship. The writing was as
follows:—"On the 25th of October, 1616, arrived here
the ship ‘Endraght,’ of Amsterdam; the first merchant,
Gilles Mibais van Luyck; captain, Dirk Hartog, of
Amsterdam; the 25th ditto set sail for Bantam; under
merchant Jan Steyn; upper steersman, Pieter Dockes
from Bil; A.D. 1616.”
Eighty years afterwards the inscription was found
by Van Vlaming, who commanded the “Geelvinck.”
SECTION OF MAP FROM JOMERD'S ATLAS IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM, DATED 1546.


He took away the original plate, replacing it by a new
one, on which he had copied Hartog’s writing, to which
he added the following:
“On the 4th of February, 1697, arrived here the
ship ‘Geelvinck,’ Amsterdam—Captain, Commandant
Wilhelm van Vlaming of Vlielandt; assistant, Jan van
Bremen of Copenhagen; first pilot, Micheel Bloem van
Estight of Bremen; the hooker ‘Myptaugh’—Captain
Gerrit Collaert, of Amsterdam; assistant, Theodorus
Heermans of the same place; then the galliot ‘Weseltje’
—Commander Cornelius van Vlaming of Vlielandt ;
pilot Coert Gerritz of Bremen. Sailed from here with
our fleet on the 12th to explore the south land and
afterwards bound for Batavia.” More than a hundred
years later —in 1801—the plate was found by an
expedition led by the Frenchman Baudin.
Frederick Houtman, in the “Dordrecht,” commanded
a fleet of eleven ships which explored the western coast in
1619. This expedition resulted in some amplification of
the knowledge of the coast line of the least fertile side
of the continent, and it bears a rather unique interest
from the fact that it resulted in the first suggestion
that the country might be gold-bearing. Jacob d’Edel,
who was supercargo of one of the vessels contained in
the fleet, wrote the following account in a letter of the
visit to the southern land :—“We anchored in 14 fathoms
in 32J° latitude, the bottom being level and hard; in
full sight of the land the sea was a hundred fathoms
deep. We used our best endeavours to make a landing,
which, however, could not be conveniently done owing
to the steep coast We then made all sail,
and the wind coming round a little, we stood out to sea,
not deeming it advisable to continue longer inshore in
this bad weather, with such large, heavy ships and such
costly cargoes as had been entrusted to our care, and
with great peril to lose more precious time; but being
content with having seen the land, which, at a more
favourable time may be further explored with more
fitting ships and smaller craft. We have seen no signs
of inhabitants, nor have we kept always near the coast,
since it formed large bays, which would have taken up
much time. Still, we kept seeing the coast from time
to time, until in 27° we came upon the land discovered
by the ‘Endraght,’ which land in the said latitude
showed as a red, muddy coast, which, according to the
surmises of some of us might not unlikely prove to be
gold-bearing, a point which may be cleared up in time.”
Among other evidence collected during that portion
of the seventeenth century of the part of the continent
lying nearest to the regular route of trading ships should
be mentioned data collected by Jan Cartensz, who
visited the coast of what now is the Northern Territory.
Portion of the party was murdered by the natives,
and the account of the voyage contains the following
statement: —“In this discovery were found everywhere
shallow water and barren coasts; islands altogether
thinly populated by divers cruel, poor, and brutal
natives, and of very little use to the company.”
Discoveries of the southern coast of Australia began
to be made in 1627. In that year Francois Thyssen, in
command of the “Gude Zeepaard,” sailed across the
Great Australian Bight. The country was called Nuyts
Land, in tribute to the chief passenger on the ship,
whose name was Pieter Nuyts, and who at a later date
filled the positions of Ambassador to Japan and
Governor of Formosa. The coast is believed to have
been followed from Cape Leeuwin to the eastern side of
the Australian Bight. The evidence collected was not of
a character to conflict with the unfavourable impression
of the possibilities of the settlement of the continent
which had been derived by discoveries on the western
and north-western coast. The view of the land
exposed to the Dutchmen consisted almost entirely of
seemingly endless leagues of sand ridges and high
forbidding cliffs. There were no rivers entering the sea,
and no testimony of any latent wealth awaiting
exploitation within the barren-looking country.
In the following year Do Witt sailed along the
north-western coast in the neighbourhood of Kimberley,
giving to it the name of De Witt Land. He was not
on an expedition of discovery, but was homeward
bound from India. During the same year the Dutch
East India Company sent out a fleet of eleven ships
from Texel on October 28. The ships rounded the Cape
of Good Hope, but in a subsequent storm one of them,
the “Batavia,” commanded by Francis Pelsart, became
separated from the others.
The “Batavia” was overloaded with crew and
passengers, and was unfitted for many weary weeks of
buffeting about searching for her bearings. The tale
of the experiences of those who comprised her company
form what is probably the most thrilling authentic
account of adventure in early Australian exploration.
For many days and nights the ship held to a course
which the navigators fondly believed was taking them
to Bantam. But on one bright moonlight night, when
fortunately the sea was calm and little wind was
blowing, the attention of the watch was directed to a
long gleam of white immediately ahead of the ship.
A few hurried sentences were exchanged, but doubts
were set at rest by the assurance of some of those on
duty that they saw but the reflection of the moon upon
the surface of the sea. Every one believed the ship to
be hundreds of miles from land, and the theory of the
moon’s reflection seemed perfectly sound. But in a
very few minutes the crew and passengers alike learned
that the white line was the curling crest of breakers
flinging their bulk lazily upon an unknown line of rocks.
In a very few moments the ship, which, small and incon-
venient as were the craft of that day, drew a tremendous


depth of water, was in the midst of the angry chop of
a deep ocean swell which had met with a pioneering
obstruction after swinging unimpeded half round the
globs. The ‘ Batavia” struck and held fast amidst small
islands off the western coast of the continent, and
shortly afterwards, to make matters more desperate,
a storm of wind and rain arose.
Pelsart gives an account of his dilemma in his
journal“ They could see no land, except an island
which was about the distance of three leagues, and two
small islands, or rather rocks, which lay nearer. They
immediately sent the master to examine them, who
returned at nine in the morning and reported that the
of it. But what hindered them most of all was the
brutal behaviour of some of the crew, who made them-
selves drunk with the wine, of which no care was taken.
In short, such was the confusion that they made but
three trips that day, carrying over to the island 180
persons, twenty barrels of bread, and some casks of
water. The master returned on board towards the
evening, and told the captain that it was to no purpose
to send more provisions ashore, since the people only
wasted those they had already. Upon this the captain
went in the shallop to put things in order, and was
there informed that there was no water to be found on
the island.”

sea at high water did not cover them, but that the
coast was so rocky and full of shoals that it would be
very difficult to land upon them. They resolved,
however, to run the risk, and to send most of the
company on shore to pacify the women, children, sick
people, and several as were out of their wits with fear.
About 10 o’clock they embarked in their shallop and
skiff, and perceiving that the vessel began to break
up they redoubled their diligence. They likewise
endeavoured to get their bread up, but did not take
the same care of the water, not reflecting in their fright
that they might be much distressed on shore for want
F
Eventually another portion of the ship’s company
was landed on a second island, but no water was
discovered, whilst only a limited supply was on hand.
Trouble broke out among the motley assortment of people
thus thrust on tiny spots of land in an unknown and
apparently uninhabited part of the globe. Water could
not at first be found on any of the islands; and part of
the crew desired to set sail in the boat in search of the
needed supplies in the adjacent islands or the mainland,
and, failing that, to steer for Batavia and obtain
assistance for those they had left behind them. At
first Pelsart would not agree to this suggestion, but


ultimately he consented to it. A deck was put upon the
boat, and Pelsart set out in charge of the hazardous
expedition.
Pelsart spent three days unsuccessfully searching
for water among the surrounding islands, and he then
steered for the mainland, where, owing to the heavy
surf, he was unable to land. The boat was then turned
to the northward, but kept close to the coast. On
June 14, ten days after the wreck, they noticed smoke
emanating from the land, and, though it was still
impossible to put the boat ashore, six of the crew
determined to swim through the surf and to discover
if where there was fire there must not be men, and
where there were men there must not be water. All
six landed in safety, and the whole day was spent in
searching for traces either of habitation or some stream.
Towards evening they discovered four blacks crawling
towards them on their hands and knees. On being
observed the natives fled. The sailors swam back to
the boat, but next day they landed again and obtained
a small quantity of fresh water. Encouraged by the
latter discovery, the men decided to explore the hills
which lay back from the coast, hoping to there find what
they sought. They met with no success, and Pelsart in his
journal wrote: —“For behind the mountain chain the
country was flat again, bearing neither trees nor
vegetation nor grass, and being covered everywhere
with high ant-hills built of earth, which in the distance
were not unlike Indian huts. There were also such
multitudes of flies that one could not keep them out
of one’s eyes.” The only discovery during this inland
excursion was the sight of eight blacks who would
“neither speak nor stop.”
Pelsart then left the locality, steering for some
distance further along the coast in a northerly direction,
but ultimately making a direct dash for Batavia, which
he succeeded in reaching on July 5. On his arrival
there the authorities made the frigate “Sardam” avail-
able for his use, and on July 15 he sailed in her for
the scene of the wreck.
After Pelsart had left the refugees on the islands
a grim tale of crime was developing. The supercargo,
a chemist named Jerome Cornelisz, with a number of
accomplices, had remained on the ship, with the hope
of refloating her and using her for piratical purposes.
Ultimately, however, the vessel broke up and the men
on board her were forced to make for one of the islands.
The original company was then divided over three
islands, and Cornelisz took command of that on which
he landed. It was resolved among the conspirators
to murder everyone on all the islands except about
forty men, who were to seize the ship on which Pelsart
returned. The following quaint contract was made
between them : —“We, the undersigned, in order to take
away all our distrust that exists or might arise amongst
us, bind ourselves herewith, on the salvation of our
souls, and on the solemn oath, that God shall truly
help us to be true to each other in everything and to
love each other as brothers; also promising not to do
each other any injury whatsoever in person or possession
without first verbally declaring to each other the breach
of the peace, in knowledge whereof we have signed this
contract on the 12th July, 1629, on the island Bataviae s
Herkhof.” To this most extraordinary document were
attached the signatures of the conspirators. The gang
then set upon their murdering enterprise, killing a
number of people on the island they were occupying.
Meanwhile a party with Webbye Hays, who for twenty
days had been searching for water, found it, and while
the murders were proceeding, the smoke from signal
fires telling of the welcome discovery gave joy to the
hearts of the people on the two other islands, who knew
nothing of the tragedy being enacted so close to them.
The conspirators were not successful in despatching
all but their friends. A number of the escapees saw
the smoke from the fire Hays had lit for quite a
different jmrpose, and they succeeded in reaching him
by means of a raft. The gang of murderers still were
extending their operations and visiting the other islands.
Wholesale carnage was carried on. But Hays had with
him a force of men, and these with the refugees
who had carried the news to him made about forty-five.
Cornelisz and his gang attacked the party led by
Webbye Hays, and although all the strength of arms
was with the murderers they nevertheless were beaten
off. Ultimately the ringleader was caught by strategy,
and many of his followers were killed. On Sep-
tember 13 Pelsart arrived back as the islands in the
“Sardam.” Hays was the first to come aboard the
man-of-war, and he informed Pelsart that those who
remained of the mutineers were planning to surprise
and seize the ship, a prophesy which within a few hours
proved to be true. The attempt, however, failed, and
the guilty gang all suffered the penalty of death. The
execution was carried out on Seal Island. Altogether
no fewer than 125 innocent men, women, and children
had been mercilessly slaughtered. After all but two
of the conspirators had been killed, the “Sardam” set
sail for Batavia, but she stopped on her course in order
to land and leave the surviving pair of the murderers
on the coast of Western Australia near Champion Bay.
During the next few years the continent was
frequently sighted by Dutch navigators, but no
important knowledge was gained of the land. Captain
Pool set sail on a voyage of discovery to the great south
land in 1636 with the “Amsterdam” and “Wezel,” but
he was murdered at New Guinea, and the expedition
returned.
Six years later the Dutch equipped another expedi-
tion, which was placed under the command of Abel


Janssen Tasman. The party was provided with two
ships, the “Heemskirk” and the “Zeehaan,” which left
Batavia an August 14, 1642, and Mauritius on
September 5. On the 4th of the following month
Tasman sailed again, the plan on this occasion being
to steer along the 44th parallel of latitude until reaching
the 150th meridian of longitude. If land had not been
sighted on this route, the ship was then to be steered
more to the northward. On November 17 Tasmania
was discovered. Land was first seen bearing east by
north. The spot has since been named Point Hibbs.
The attention of Tasman and his companions was
at once arrested by the marked difference between the
nature of the land ahead of them and those portions
of the continent described by previous discoverers. In
place of the interminable sandhills and all the traces
of an arid interior, the country was clothed thickly in
DIRK HARTOG'S PLATE, 1616.
a dense green forest, and behind the forest rose tiers
of mountains. Tasman kept sailing along the coast
until December 1, when he anchored in Frederick
Henry Bay. Next morning a landing was made. The
party believed it was on what formed part of the
main land of the continent, which was thereupon named
Van Diemen Land, in honour of the Governor of
Batavia of that time. For many years the title was
retained for Tasmania, but it was discontinued in
favour of that of the real discoverer of the island in
an effort to rid the place of the unfortunate association
which had attached to it during the days which it was
used as a convict settlement.
The surprise which the navigators had felt at what
they saw from the ocean of the new land was greatly
increased on closer inspection. Everywhere the scenery
f 2
was wildly magnificent—mountain chains rising up
against the skyline in orderless profusion, whilst the
growth of vegetation filled the Dutchmen with astonish-
ment. The journals of Tasman were lost, but an account
of the voyage was published in 1705 by Burgomaster
Witsen, who states that he obtained his data personally
from Tasman. What first excited the wonder of the
explorers was the great size of the trees, some of which
they described as being 60 feet from the ground to the
lowest of the branches. Surprise was also created at
the traces they found of the blacks having stripped the
bark off many of the tree trunks, as is a well-known
practice with Australian natives requiring material
either for canoes or for huts. This, coupled with steps
some seven feet apart which the blacks had used in
order to climb to the branches, gave the impression that
the place was inhabited by some mighty animals. On
VLAMING'S PLATE, 1697.
the 3rd instant the ships entered another bay, but the
surf was strong, and for that reason no boat was sent
ashore. However, the carpenter undertook to swim to
land, and he erected a poet and left a flag flying from
it at a rock which has since been recognized from the
description given. This was the last the expedition
saw of Tasmania.
In 1644 Tasman sailed to explore the northern and
north-western coasts of the continent. He was also
instructed by his Government to find out whether New
Guinea was separated from the mainland by water, the
nature of the discovery of Torres not then being known.
In the latter task he failed, but the expedition was rich
in valuable results. The north-western fringe of the
continent to as far as the 22nd degree was explored. The
following extracts from Witsen are interesting in


showing how easily explorers may fall into error
regarding weapons used by a strange people. The
blacks whom Tasman saw certainly could not have used
bows and arrows. What he mistook for such doubtless
were spears and other wooden implements of warfare.
The passages are as follows:
“In lat. 13° 8' south, long. 146° 18' [probably
near Victoria River], the coast is barren. The people
are naked and wicked, shooting at the Dutch with
arrows without provocation, when they were coming
on shore. It is here very populous.”
“In 14° 58', long. 138°, the people are savage and
go naked; none can understand them. In 16° 10', the
people swam on board a Dutch ship, and when they
received a present of a piece of linen they laid it on
their heads in token of gratitude. Everywhere there-
about the people are all malicious. They use arrows and
bows of such length that one end rests upon the ground
when shooting. They have also hazegayes and kalawayes,
and attacked the Dutch, but did not know the execution
of the guns.”
In Hullandia Nova (near Roebuck Bay) Tasman
found “naked black people with curly hair, malicious and
cruel, using for arms bows and arrows. They once
came to a number of fifty, double armed, dividing
themselves into two parties, intending to have surprised
the Dutch, who had landed twenty-five men, but the
firing of the guns frightened them so much that they
took to flight. Their canoes are made of the bark of
trees. Their coast is dangerous, there is but little
vegetation, the people have no houses.”
“In 19° 35' [about Dampier Archipelago] the
inhabitants are very numerous, and threw stones at the
boats sent by the Dutch to the shore. They made fires
and smoke all along the coast, which it was conjectured
they did to give notice to their neighbours of strangers
being upon the coast. They appear to live very poorly,
go naked, eat yams and other roots.”
Australia began to be known under the name of
New Holland after the last voyage of Tasman. It was
he who first clearly demonstrated that the south land
was one continent which did not extend to the south
pole. However, Tasmania and New Guinea were both sup-
posed to form parts of the mainland, whilst the eastern
coast was unknown. Had as many visits been paid to
the latter as took place to the western the rate of further
discovery probably would have been accelerated greatly.
All the explorers saw the worst and least hospitable por-
tions of the coast, and with the exception of the fleeting
glimpse of part of Tasmania caught by Tasman no one was
aware of what the more fertile portions of the seaboard
had to offer. No very important discoveries were made
regarding Australia from the time of the voyage of
Tasman until the close of the seventeenth century.
CHAPTER II.
LATER DISCOVERIES.
After the time of Tasman the first voyage of note
to be paid to Australian waters was undertaken by an
Englishman. This was Captain William Dampier, who
ranks as the pioneer of British discoverers of the nature
and coastline of this country. Dampier was born in
1652, and came of a Somersetshire family. He first
entered the merchant service, but also served for a short
while in the navy. When twenty-two years of age he
began life as a planter in Jamaica, but five years later
he joined a privateer and launched upon a career of
adventure. In 1683 he sailed round the world under
Captain Harvey. In 1688 he came to Australian waters.
Until the time of Dampier British navigators had
played little part in the discoveries of the southern seas
and the Pacific. The English could hardly be said to
feel any interest even in the existence of the great south
land. The attention of the nation was turned to these
shores by Dampier when he was returning from a
purely buccaneering venture, and who visited the coast
of the continent in an endeavour to steer a course to
civilization back from an expedition of piracy in China
seas by the most neglected route, so that he would not
be likely to fall in with Dutch or British ships, of which
he had reason to stand in some fear. Contrary winds
brought Dampier out of his course, and as a consequence
he came to the Australian coast. He landed in the
north-western corner of King Sound, at what is now
called Cygnet Bay, where the ship was beached for
cleaning and repairs. In his published record of the
voyage Dampier'gives a particularly interesting descrip-
tion of his experiences in the little-known south land.
“The 4th day of January, 1688,” he writes, “we
fell in with the land of New Holland in the lat. of
16° 50'. We ran in close by it, and finding no
convenient anchoring, because it lies open to the N.W.,
we ran along shore to the eastward, steering N.E. by
E., for so the land lies. We steered thus about twelve
leagues, and then came to a point of land from where
the land trends east and southerly for about ten or
twelve leagues, but how afterwards I know not. About
three leagues to the eastward of this point there is a
pretty deep bay, with abundance of islands in it, and


a very good place to anchor in. About a league to the
eastward of that point we anchored January the sth,
1688, two miles from the shore, in twenty-nine fathoms,
good bard sand, and clean ground.
“New Holland is a very large tract of land. It is
not yet determined whether it is an island or a main
continent, but I am certain that it joins neither Asia,
Africa, nor America. This part of it that we saw is
all low, even land, with sandy banks against the sea,
only the points are rocky, and so are some of the islands
in this bay.
turtle as such. Of these creatures there is plenty, but
they are extraordinarily shy, though the inhabitants
cannot trouble them much, having neither boats nor
iron.
“The inhabitants of this country are the miserablest
people in the world. The Hodmadods of Monomatapa,
though a nasty people, yet for wealth are gentlemen to
these, who have no house, and skin garments, sheep,
poultry, and fruits of the earth, ostrich eggs, etc., as
the Hodmadods have. And setting aside their human
shapes, they differ but little from brutes. They are
TASMAN'S MAP, FROM THEVENOT'S COLLECTION, 1663.
“The land is of a dry, sandy soil, destitute of water,
except you make wells, yet producing divers sorts of
trees; but the wood is not thick nor the trees very big.
Most of the trees that we saw are dragon trees, as we
supposed, and these, too, are the largest trees of any
there. We saw no sort of animal, nor any track of
beast but once, and that seemed to be the tread of a
beast as big as a great mastiff dog. Here are a few
small land birds, but none bigger than a blackbird, and
but few sea fowls. Neither is the sea very plentifully
stored with fish, unless you reckon the manatee and
tall, strait-bodied, and thin, with' small, long limbs.
They have great heads, round foreheads, and great
brows. Their eyelids are always half closed to keep
the flies out of their eyes, they being so troublesome
here that no fanning will keep them from coming to
one’s face; and without the assistance of both hands
to keep them off they will creep into one’s nostrils
and mouth, too, if the lips are not shut very
close; so that from their infancy being thus annoyed
with these insects they do never open their eyes
as other people. And therefore they cannot see far,


unless they hold up their heads, as if they were looking
at somewhat over them
‘‘We anchored, as I said before, and seeing men
walking on the shore, we presently sent a canoe to get
some acquaintance with them, for we were in hopes to
get some provision among them. But the inhabitants,
seeing our boat coming, ran away and hid themselves.
We searched afterwards for three days in hopes to find
their houses, but found none; yet we saw many places
where they had made fires. At last, being out of hojies
to find their habitation, we searched no farther, but
left a great many toys ashore in such places where we
thought they would come. In all our search we found
no water, but old wells on the sandy bays.
“At last we went over to the islands, and there we
found a great many of the natives; I do believe there
were forty on one island—men, women, and children.
The men, at our first coming ashore, threatened us with
their lances and swords, but they were frighted by
firing one gun, which we fired purposely to scare them.
The island was so small that they could not hide them-
selves; but they were much disordered at our landing,
especially the women and children, for they went
directly to their camp. The lustiest of the women,
snatching up their infants, ran away howling, and the
little children ran after squeaking and bawling; but
the men stood still. Some of the women, and such
people as could not go from us, lay still by a fire, making
a doleful noise, as if we had been coming to devour
them, but when they saw that we did not intend to
harm them, they were pretty quiet, and the rest that
fled from us at our first coming returned again. This
their place of dwelling was only a fire, with a few
boughs before it, set up on that side the wind was of.”
Dampier and his companions ultimately became
more familiar with the savages, and gave them
clothes, hoping that in return the blacks would aid in
carrying water barrels to the ship. “But,” says the
narrator, “all the signs we could make were to no
purpose, for they stood like statues, without motion,
but grinned like so many monkeys, staring one upon
another. For these poor creatures seem not accustomed
to carry burdens, and I believe that one of our ship
boys of ten years old would carry as much as one of
them.”
Dampier stayed at the place till the following
March, or something over two months. A week after
the arrival they beached the ship by the simple process
of taking her inshore, at a small sandy cove, as far as
she could float at a spring tide, “for the sea riseth and
falleth here about five fathoms.” At low tide the ship
was left high and dry, with dry sand for nearly half
a mile between her and the nearest water.
During the subsequent weeks trouble arose between
Dampier and his companions, whom he says, “I did
endeavour to persuade to go home to some English
factory, but was threatened to be turned ashore and
left here.” Dampier then decided to wait for some
favourable opportunity for leaving the ship. On
March 12 the vessel sailed from Australia, and as the
immediate result of a quarrel, but also as an outcome
of his own plans, Dampier and two others were put
ashore on the Nicobar Islands. They reached England
three years later, after suffering many hardships.
Some further discoveries were made in 1696 by the
Dutch, who sent out an expedition under Wilhelm van
Vlaming, with three vessels, to search for the ship
“Ridderschap van Holland,” which was missing. On
Christmas Day of the same year they sighted land,
which they discovered to be detached from the main-
land, and which they called Rottnest Island, on account
of the great number of wallabies’ nests they found.
Some wreckage was found here, but there were no
evidences to indicate whether it was connected with the
“Ridderschap van Holland.” Vlaming, with a party
of eighty-six men on January 5, 1697, landed on the
mainland, and explored some of the country in
the immediate neighbourhood, splitting up into three
divisions for that purpose. An outcome of the enter-
prise was the discovery of the Swan River, which was
named by Vlaming, on account of his having there
found a number of black swans, three of which were
captured and taken alive to Batavia as practical proof
of the accuracy of the accounts of the birds which had
hitherto been regarded as a myth.
In searching for the missing ship the expedition
kept along the coast to the northwards, but obtained
a very unfavourable impression of the character of the
continent. Shark Bay was reached cn February 4, and
the tin plate already referred to was discovered on
Dirk Hartog Island. Vlaming continued his voyage
along the coast until reaching North-west Cape on
February 21, when he returned to Batavia, having
discovered nothing of the fate of the missing ship.
The report of the expedition shows that the party
considered it had found nothing but a bare and desolate
country.
Three years later William Dampier, on January 14,
1699, again set sail for New Holland, of which he sighted
the western coast on August 1 following. He took anchor
at Dirk Hartog Bay, but renamed it Shark Bay. In
his journal Dampier describes the great numbers of
sharks found there, and how he discovered what he
believed to be the head of a hippopotamus in the stomach
of one of these great creatures. “The hairy lips,”
he writes, “were still sound, and the jaw was also firm.
Out of this we plucked a good many teeth, two of
which were eight inches long, and the rest as big as
a man’s thumb, small at one end, and a little crooked.”
Probably the head was that of a dugong, but certainly


standing in the savannah, which at a distance we
thought were houses, looking just like Hottentots’
houses at the Cape of Good Hope, but we found them
to be so many rocks. We searched about these for
water, but could find none, nor any houses nor people
where we landed, and there we dug for water. While
we were at work there came nine or ten natives to a
small hill a little way from us, and stood there menacing
and threatening of us, and making a great noise. At
last one of them came towards us, and the rest followed
at a distance. I went to meet him, and came within
fifty yards of him, making to him all the signs of peace
and friendship I could, but then he ran away, neither
would they nor any of them stay for us to come nigh
them, for we tried two or three times. At last I took
two men with me and went in the afternoon along
the seaside purposely to catch one of them if I
could, of whom I might learn where they get their
it was not what Dampier thought it to be. A great
deal of interesting material was collected by the same
explorer about this region. Dampier manifested a love
for natural history, and his observations have proved
to be singularly accurate. The first description of
kangaroos known to exist is given by him as follows;
“The land animals were only a sort of racoons, different
from those of the West Indies, chiefly as to their legs,
for they have very short forelegs, but go jumping upon
them as the others do, and like them are very good
meat.”
Being short of water, Dampier sailed in search of
it to the north, continuing along the coast. On the
31st of the month he landed about 150 miles south of
Cygnet Bay, where he had previously been. He had
established to his own satisfaction that the land
was not connected with New Guinea, but he had
not clearly proved whether New Holland consisted
of a series of
islands or in
reality was a
continent.

“On the 31st August, betimes in the morning,
I went ashore with ten or eleven men to search
for water. We went armed with muskets and cutlasses
for our defence, expected to see people there, and
carried also shovels and pickaxes to dig wells. When
we came near the shore we saw three tall, black, naked
men on the sandy bay ahead of us, but as we rowed in
they went away. When we landed I sent a boat with
two men in her to lie a little from the shore at an
anchor, to prevent being seized, while the rest of us went
after the three black men, who were now got on the
top of a small hill, about a quarter of a mile from us,
with eight or nine men more in their company. They,
seeing us coming, ran away. When we came on the top
of the hill where they first stood, we saw a plain
savannah about half a mile from us, further in from
the sea. There were several things like haycocks
that they could not then see us, we made a halt,
and hid ourselves in a bending of the sandbank. They
knew we must be thereabouts, and being three or four
times our number thought to seize us, so they dispersed
themselves, some going to the sea shore and others
beating about the sandhills. We knew by what
recounter we had with them in the morning that we
could easily outrun them, so a nimble young man that
was with me, seeing some of them near, ran towards
them, and they for some time ran away before him.
But he soon overtaking them, they faced about and
fought him. He had a cutlass, and they had wooden
lances, with which, being many of them, they were too
hard for him. When he first ran towards them I chased
two more that were by the shore, but fearing how it
might be with my young man I turned back quickly and
went up to the top of a sandhill, whence I saw him


near me, closely engaged with them. Upon their seeing
me one of them threw a lance at me, that narrowly
missed me. I discharged my gun to scare them, but
avoiding shooting any of them, till finding the young
man in great danger from them, and myself in some,
and that, though the gun had a little frighted them
at first, yet they had soon learnt to despise it, tossing
up their heads and crying 'Pooh, pooh, pooh,’ and
coming on afresh with a great noise, I thought it high
time to charge it again, and shoot one of them, which
I did. The rest seeing him fall, made a stand again,
and my young man took the opportunity to disengage
himself and come off to me; my other man also was
with me, who had done nothing all this while, having
come out unarmed, and I returned back with my men,
designing to attempt the natives no farther, being very
sorry for what had happened already. They took up
their wounded companion, and my young man, who had
been struck through the cheek by one of their lances,
was afraid it had been poisoned, but I did not think
that likely. His wound was very painful to him, being
made with a blunt weapon, but he soon recovered of it.
"The land hereabouts was much like the part of
New Holland that I formerly described; ’tis low, but
seemingly barricaded with a long chain of sandhills to
the sea, that lets nothing be seen of what is further
inland. At high tides, the tides rising so high as they
do, the coast shows very low, but when ’tis low water
it seems to be of an indifferent height. At low water
the shore is all rocky, so that then there is no landing
with a boat, but at high water a boat may come in over
these rocks to the sandy bay which runs along this coast.
The land by the sea for about five or six hundred yards
is a dry, sandy soil, bearing only shrubs and bushes of
divers sorts. Some of these had then at this time of
year yellow flowers or blossoms, some blue, and some
white, most of them of a very fragrant smell. Some
of them had fruitlike peascods, in each of which there
were just ten small peas. I opened many of them, and
found no more nor less. There are also here some of
that sort of bean which I saw at Rosemary Island, and
another sort of small, red, hard pulse, growing in cods
also, with little black eyes like beans. I know not
their names, but have seen them often in the East
Indies for weighing gold, and they make the same use
of them at Guinea, as I have heard, where the women
also make bracelets of them to wear about their arms.
These grow on bushes, but here also are fruitlike beans,
growing on a creeper sort of shrublike vine. There was
great plenty of all these sorts of codfruit growing on
the sandhills by the seaside, some of them green, some
ripe, and some fallen on the ground; but I could not
perceive that any of them had been gathered by the
natives, and might not probably be wholesome food.
"The land further in, that is lower than what
borders on the sea, was, so much as we saw of it, very
plain, and even partly savannahs and partly woodlands.
The savannahs bear a sort of thin, coarse grass. The
mould is also a coarser sand than that by the seaside,
and in some places ’tis clay. Here are a great many
rocks in the large savannah we were in, which are five
or six feet high, and round at the top like a haycock,
very remarkable, some red and white. The woodland
lies further in still, where there were divers sorts of
small trees, scarce any three feet in circumference,
their bodies twelve or fourteen feet high, with a small
head of small knibs or boughs.”
These were the last observations of New Holland
made by Dampier, and he sailed from the coast early
in September. For the following seventy years little
effort was spent in exploring the coasts of Australia.
Prospective enterprise in that direction had been killed
by the discouraging accounts of the western and
northern coasts.
CHAPTER III.
COOK’S VOYAGE ON THE EAST COAST
By the latter half of the eighteenth century great
changes had taken place in navigation, whilst the
relations between European nations had materially
altered. The Dutch and the Portuguese had lost their
maritime supremacy, and the discoveries made by the
earlier seafaring men to a considerable extent had sunk
into oblivion. Up to this time the eastern side of
Australia remained unknown. England was fast rising
to the mastery of the seas, rivalled only by France.
Yet neither nation embarked in a deliberate effort to
investigate the great southern continent which was
known to exist, but about which so little else had been
learned. That behind the barren sandhills of the
western beach there stretched the foundations of a great
empire was discovered by the British almost accidentally
through the agency of an expedition which the Royal
Society in 1767 resolved to send to the South Sea to
observe the transit of Venus. The Royal Society asked
the Government for funds to carry out the enterprise,
and the request was granted. James Cook was placed


in command of the ship to carry the expedition. He
had served in the navy, and had established a reputation
by reason of his scientific knowledge.
The party, consisting in all of eighty-five persons,
sailed on July 1, 1768, in the “Endeavour,” a barque
of 370 tons burden. She was fitted with twenty-two
guns, and carried provisions for eighteen months. The
expedition landed in New Zealand, and after the
astronomical observation, which had formed the primary
object of the enterprise, had been taken, efforts were
also devoted to exploring new lands. The latter enter-
prise was considered only a side issue to the main
purpose of the expedition, but it-was destined to add
a new nation and a new continent to the British
dominions. In April, 1770, the “Endeavour” set sail
from New Zea-
land, and taking
a north-western
course she met
with the south-
eastern coast of
Australia. The
ship then turned
north, following
the land along
the shores of
what is now
known as Gipps-
land, and which
forms one of the
most fertile pro-
vinces of the
whole continent.
But by a strange
coincidence, as
though a bad
reputation were
destined to al-
ways cling to
Australia, the
expedition was presented with the sight of a low,
sandy shore, with no very pleasing prospect for as
far beyond as they could see. In the distance
the outlines of mountains were observed, and it was
evident that the intervening country was timbered.
But no inlet presented facilities for landing, and no
evidence was afforded of the phenomenal wealth which
lay beyond the sounding surf. At this point Cook
became firmly convinced that Van Diemen Land, as
Tasmania was then called, was separated from the
mainland by water. He found support in this theory
in the nature of the currents and the heavy seas rolling
from the westward.
In the absence of any safe place for landing, the
“Endeavour” was held to her course to the northward,
but kept as close to the shore as was practicable. Changes
in the character of the land became apparent. The
low coastline gave place to more rugged features,
whilst evidences began to accumulate of a plentiful
rainfall and bounteous flora. Dense forests would give
place to expanses of grass and the valleys of streams
to broken hills and ranges, which, jutting into the sea,
made rocky capes. Almost with every mile fresh points
of interest were peresented to the eager gaze of the
scientists who had come across the globe to watch a
star, but had found a new realm. As they proceeded
farther north the mountains were found to lie
nearer to the coast, and consequently appeared
to become more lofty and broken, whilst the denseness
of the timber and magnificent character of many of
the trees grew
apparent from
the deck of the
barque, which at
times was so very
close to land that
natives could be
plainly distin-
guished. Many of
the scenes were
of attractive var-
iety, and filled
the explorers
with wonder that
so promising and
pleasing a conti-
nent could have
been left undis-
turbed by the
conquering hand
of white men
until that late
date. A number
of the promi-
nent features of
the coast was named by Cook as his ship
sailed past them. Unfortunately the “Endeavour”
sailed by Twofold Bay, one of the most beautiful as
well as the best sheltered harbours on the Australian
coast, without the inlet being seen, which, however,
is easily understood owing to the physical features of
the locality.
It was not until the “Endeavour” reached as far
north as Botany Bay that a landing was made. The
inlet received its name from Cook because of the
quantities of new plants discovered there by Dr.
Solander and Mr. Banks, two botanists who had
accompanied the expedition. The surrounding country,
clothed thickly in all kinds of foliage and inhabited
by quantities of bird and animal life, appeared to

the explorers in the light of a new-found southern
paradise.
After entering the heads, the crew saw an immense
expanse of water open up ahead of them. Natives were
seen on the shore whilst soundings at the entrance
were being taken. The blacks were fully armed, and
were quaintly painted, as was the custom with them
when about to engage in battle. Their weapons
consisted of spears and boomerangs. As the ship
approached the savages gestured threateningly, and
waved their weapons. The barque was brought to
anchor about two miles from the entrance and under
the south shore. Close at hand were several of the rude
huts which the natives used, whilst four men were
engaged in spearing fish, each being seated in a small
canoe. Cook and his companions were very much
astonished at the lack of intelligent interest displayed
by the savages at what to them was an unprecedented
sight, a characteristic which went to illustrate the low
standard of the native’s mind. While the ship was at
anchor an old woman, accompanied by three children,
emerged from the timber which lay some little distance
from the water. Other children ran out from the huts
to meet them. The old woman for a time appeared to
regard the “Endeavour” intently, but immediately
afterwards she quite calmly set about kindling a fire.
The fishermen then landed, hauled up their canoes, and
prepared their fish for cooking. None of them appeared
to be surprised at the ship. Apparently they hardly
felt interested in its appearance.
Preparations, meanwhile, were being made to land
from the barque, and a boat was soon launched and pulled
ashore. There then was enacted a scene of historic interest
so well known as hardly to require relating here. It was
hoped that the natives would prove as apathetic to the
white men putting foot on their soil as they had been
to the white men’s ship having entered their bay. But
expectations were not to be realized. The boat carried
forty men, and as they approached the shore two of
the natives came down to dispute the landing, though
the others fled. The landing party could not help
admiring the valour of the two blacks who were
prepared to challenge twenty times their number. Cook
tried to pacify the defenders, and threw them presents,
with which they seemed well pleased, but every effort
at further conciliation proved futile. Ultimately the
landing party was forced either to abandon the effort
at getting ashore or else do so by force. A charge of
small shot was fired at the legs of one of the blacks,
causing him to retreat. The party then landed, but no
sooner had they done so than the wounded savage
returned, armed with a shield, with which he hoped to
protect his legs from further attack of the sort which
had already drawn a considerable quantity of blood.
Both savages threw spears at the invaders of their
territory, but the weapons were dodged without diffi-
culty, and in retaliation some more small shot was fired.
The blacks then fled. Examination of the huts revealed
the presence of several babies, which explained the
frenzied resistance put up by the two men. The huts
proved to be of the most wretched description, whilst
each canoe was merely a strip of bark about fourteen
feet long tied together at both ends, and kept open
in the centre by sticks. The crew soon afterwards
returned to the ship, leaving the property and children
of the savages unharmed. The same day an excursion
was made to the north side of the bay, and there the
party found fresh water, which it stood in need of.
Next day Captain Cook revisited the huts, but he
found that presents which had been left for the blacks
were untouched. The children had been taken away;
but there was not a savage about the locality. An
exploratory voyage in one of the ship’s boats was made
round the bay, whilst another expedition was made
inland. Although natives were frequently met with, on
every occasion they fled at the sight of the strange
white men. Cook and his companions were deeply
impressed with many features of interest presented by
the new land. In dealing with their experiences at
Botany Bay, Captain Cook writes : —“We had a transient
and imperfect view of a quadruped about as big as a
rabbit. Mr. Bank’s greyhound which was with us got
sight of it, and would probably have caught it, but the
moment he set off he lamed himself against a stump
which lay concealed in the long grass. We afterwards
saw the dung of an animal which fed upon grass, and
which we judged could not be less than a deer, and the
footprints of another which was- clawed like a dog, and
seemed to be about as big as a wolf. We also tracked
a small animal, whose foot resembled that of a polecat
or weasel. The trees over our heads abounded with
birds of various kinds, among which were many
of exquisite beauty, particularly loriquets and cockatoos,
which flew in flocks of several scores together. We
found some wood which had been felled by the natives
with a blunt instrument, and some that had been
barked. The trees were not of many species. Among
others there was a large one which yielded gum not
unlike the Sanguis dractnis, and in some of them steps
had been cut at about three feet distance from each
other for the convenience of climbing them.”
The ship stayed several days in the bay, during
which the company spent all available time in investi-
gating the features of the country, collecting specimens
of the flora, and obtaining what knowledge it could
of the fauna. Natives were frequently met with, but
every advance of a friendly nature made by the white
men was misunderstood by the savages, who fled when
approached. Evidences were collected of the racial
curiosity being not confined to one side. The exploring


white men were given reason for believing that they
were frequently under the observation of natives hidden
among the trees, and that the latter had become fully
acquainted with the deadly nature of firearms, which
the explorers were frequently using to obtain specimens
of birds and other game. On only one occasion after
the first day of landing did the blacks adopt the
offensive. That was when three or four of the white
men, in the words of their leader, “took it into their head
to march up to them (twenty-two blacks), but seeing
the Indians keep their ground till they got pretty near
them, they were seized with a sudden fear very common
to the rash and foolhardy, and made a hasty retreat.
This step, which increased the danger it was intended
to avoid, encouraged the Indians, and four of them
running forward discharged their lances at the fugitives
with such force that, flying no less than forty yards
they went beyond them. As the Indians did not pursue,
our people, recovering their spirits, stopped to collect
the lances when they came up to the places where they
lay, upon which the Indians in their turn began to
retire.”
That the locality was suitable for successful settle-
ment, and that the soil was fitted for agricultural
pursuits, was a conclusion soon arrived at by this party
of the first white men to set foot on the ©astern coast
of the continent. The commander of the expedition
writes:—“We went up the country to some distance,
and found the face of it nearly the same with that
which has been described already, but the soil was much
richer, for instead of sand I found a deep black mould,
which I thought very fit for the production of grain
of any kind. In the woods we found a tree which bore
fruit that in colour and shape resembled a cherry; the
juice had an agreeable tartness, though but little
flavour. We found, also, interspersed some of the finest
meadows in the world. Some places, however, were
rocky, but these were comparatively few. The stone is
sandy, and might be used with advantage for building.”
Captain Cook goes on to relate how “the great quantities
of plants which Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander collected
in this place induced me to give it the name of Botany
Bay.”
At daybreak on Sunday, May 6, 1770, the
“Endeavour” sailed out of Botany Bay, and headed
northward along the coast. At noon on the same day
the ship stood abreast of what was to become Sydney
Harbour, which Captain Cook named Port Jackson,
“in which,” in the words of the navigator, “there
appeared to be good anchorage.” The ship at this time
was two or three miles from land. At sunset they were
abreast of an opening which Captain Cook called
Broken Bay.
The land, as the vessel reached farther north, was
seen to be growing more mountainous, whilst dense
forests everywhere prevailed inland, and the seashore
at places shone with the gleam of white sand, which
made a striking contrast with the deep green of the
foliage behind and the dark blue of the towering ranges
in the background.
Various points along what is now known as the
North Coast of New South Wales were passed and named.
Smoky Point received its title because of the great
smoke being made there from several fires.
CHAPTER IV.
INVESTIGATION OF THE QUEENSLAND COAST.
On Wednesday, May 15, the “Endeavour” came
abreast of what now forms the boundary line between
New South Wales and Queensland, and so began the
first known voyage of discovery along the southern
portion of the coast of the northern State. On this
day the ship was experiencing rough weather. Mount
Warning was given its name because of shoals and
difficulties of navigation passed within sight of that
peak. Point Danger received its designation because
of similar reasons. “To the northward of this point,”
wrote Captain Cook, “the land is low, and trends N.W.
by N., but it soon turns again more to the northward.”
Later in the same day the ship again met with shoals
and a projection of land, which was named Point
Look Out.
During the succeeding night the ship made rapid
progress to the north, and widened the distance between
herself and the shore. A course was then steered
towards the coast. The '‘Endeavour” was now close to
Cape Moreton, which received its present name from
Captain Cook, as also did Moreton Bay.
Captain Cook did not explore the bay, but he says
that some of those on board the ship thought that a
river emptied itself into the inlet because the sea at this
point looked paler than usual. This conclusion was
discounted by Cook himself, who, while not taking up
a negative stand, considered the evidence insufficient for
forming such a conclusion. The direction of the wind
precluded those on board the “Endeavour” from clearing
up the question, but future investigators were directed to


the locality by three hills which lie “but a little way
inland. They are remarkable for the singular form of their
elevation, which very much resembles a glasshouse, for
which reason I called them the Glass Houses.” These,
of course, were the Glasshouse Mountains which form
so familiar a sight to many Queenslanders. The only
other point of interest noted about what was destined
to become a centre of so much settlement and activity
in relatively so short a space of time, was smoke rising
inland from fires apparently kindled by the natives.
At 2 o’clock the next morning the ship made sail
on her northern course. The coast immediately met
with is described as being more barren and the soil
more sandy than any pax't of Australia with which these
navigators had yet come into contact. “With our
glasses,” wrote Cook, “we could discover that the sands,
which lay in great patches of many acres, were
moveable, and that some of them had not been long in
the place they possessed, for we saw in several parts
trees half buried, the tops of which were still green,
and in others the naked trunks of such as the sand had
surrounded long enough to destroy. In other places the
woods appeared to be low and shrubby, and we saw
no signs of inhabitants. Two water snakes swam by the
ship; they were beautifully spotted, and in every
respect like land snakes, except that the tails were
broad and flat, probably to serve them instead of fins
in swimming.” Next day the “Endeavour” passed
Fraser Island, which was easily mistaken for portion
of the mainland, and Indian Head received its name
because the crew saw a great number of natives
assembled there. Sandy Point obtained its name by
reason of two very large patches of white sand which
lay upon it. Cook rounded the point, and went on to
explore Hervey Bay, which was called after Captain
Hervey.
A landing was made at Bustard Bay on Tuesday,
May 22, 1770. Probably this was the first occasion for
white men to set foot on the soil of what afterwards
was to become the State of Queensland. Captain Cook
says: —“We landed a little within the fourth point of
the bay, where we found a channel leading into a large
lagoon.” After expressing the opinion that the soil
was not so good as that of Botany Bay, he goes on to
say, “The sea seemed to abound with fish, but
unhappily we tore our seine to pieces at the first
haul. Upon the mudbanks under the mangroves we
found innumerable oysters of various kinds, among
others the hammer oyster and a large proportion of
small pearl oysters; if in deep water there is equal
plenty of such oysters at their full growth, a pearl
fishery might certainly be established here to very great
advantage.”
The “Endeavour” passed Cape Capricorn on May 25.
Three days later Cape Manifold, Keppel Bay, and
Keppel Islands were named. Cape Townshend was
rounded a day later, and the ship entered an area of
shoals and islands, which were negotiated only with
difficulty. The “Endeavour” was ultimately brought to
anchor in an inlet, which Cook named Thirsty Sound,
because of his inability to find fresh water there. He
had hopes of laying up the vessel at this spot and
cleaning her bottom, but that intention was abandoned.
A landing was made, however. An unfavourable
impression was received of the surrounding country,
but Captain Cook formed the conclusion that it contained
iron ore, an opinion he arrived at by the eccentric
movements of his compass.
On the last day of the month sail was set, and the
following day Cape Palmerston was passed. After
sailing through a passage between the islands of that
locality Cape Hillsborough was brought into view.
Cape Conway and Repulse Bay (which lies between the
two projections) received the names which they are still
known by. Keeping still to the north, the “Endeavour”
pioneered Whitsunday Passage, which title was bestowed
by reason of the fact that the voyage through the
islands there was made on Whitsunday, June 3. Cum-
berland Islands were also named by Cook. The beauties
of the place could not fail to attract the admiration
which has since made it notable. The commander describes
the place in the following terms: —“The whole passage
may be considered as one vast harbour, exclusive of the
small bays and coves which abound on each side, where
ships might lie as in a lagoon. The land, both upon
the main and islands is high, and diversified by hill
and valley, wood and lawn, with a green and pleasant
appearance. On one of the islands we discovered with
our glasses two men and a woman, and a canoe with an
outrigger, which appeared to be larger and of a
construction very different from those of bark tied
together at the ends, which we had seen upon other
parts of the coast. We hoped, therefore, that the
people here had made some further advances beyond the
mere animal life of those that we had seen before.”
Cape Gloucester was the next feature of the coast
to be noted by Cook. Cape Upstart, Cleveland Bay,
and Cape Cleveland also derived their present names
from the commander of the “Endeavour.” Magnetic
Island was designated by that title becaxise the
compasses on the “Endeavour,” in the words of the
leader of the expedition, “did not traverse so well when
we were near it.” For the first time on the coast
cocoanut trees were observed on the land, the crew
remarking that the fruit at that time would have been
very acceptable. Halifax Bay was found to provide
good anchorage, on account of the shelter afforded by
the islands. The vessel, however, was kept to her course,
first Cape Sandwich and then Rockingham Bay being
the next features noted. No attempt to enter


and investigate the latter was made. Dunk Island was
named by Cook, and on June 9 Cape Grafton was
reached. The ship was brought to anchor here, and
Cook and a landing party went in search of fresh water,
Several streams were found, but they all were in places
made inaccessible by the rugged nature of the country
or the rocks and surf of the shore. Sail was set again,
and the exposed indentation on the cpast which was
next passed was called Trinity Bay.
Up to this stage Cook had successfully negotiated
the many dangers and difficulties besetting the explorer
along this unknown and island-dotted coast, with its
many reefs and hidden perils in the shape of unsuspected
currents and sudden violent storms. Cape Tribulation
was so designated because of a narrowly-averted tragedy
which threatened the whole
company of the “Endeavour”
within sight of that head-
land, and might have resulted
in the wealth of Australia’s
latent resources lying un-
discovered till a still later
date, with a possible loss of
the continent to the British
Empire. On the night of
Sunday, June 10, the ship
was speeding along before a
fair breeze in a clear moon-
light night, with every cast
of the lead showing deep
water. A keen look-out was
being kept, for once or twice
during the evening the depth
of water had fluctuated rather
suddenly, but no real menace
was seriously suspected, and
the utmost tranquility pre-
vailed on board, as, in con-
sequence of the variations
in the sea-bottom, the ship
had stood out to sea for
three and a half hours. But a few minutes past eleven
the water shallowed at once from twenty to seventeen
fathoms, and before the lead could be cast again the
ship had struck fast on a reef, where she remained
immovable.
Fortunately the weather was calm and the sea
smooth. The crew knew that the ship could not be near
land. "We had too much reason to conclude,” writes
Cook, “that we were upon a rock of coral, which is
more fatal than any other, because the points of it are
sharp and every part of the surface so rough as to
grind away whatever is rubbed against it, even with the
gentlest motion. In this situation all the sails were
immediately taken in, and the boats hoisted out to
examine the depth of water round the ship. We soon
discovered that our fears had not aggravated oilr
misfortune, and that the vessel had been lifted over the
ledge of the rock, and lay in a hollow within it. In
some places there was from three to four fathoms, and
in others not so many feet.” An anchor was taken out
to the deep water by the long boat. The narrator
continues:—“Our utmost force was applied to the
capstan, hoping that if the anchor did not come home
the ship would be got off, but to our great misfortune
and disappointment we could not move her. During
all this time she continued to beat with great violence
against the rock, so that it was with the utmost difficulty
we kept upon our legs, and to complete the scene of
distress we saw by the light of the moon the sheathing
boards from the bottom of
the vessel floating away all
round her, and at last her
false keel, so that every
moment was making way for
the sea to rush in which
was to swallow us up. We
had now no chance but to
lighten her, and we had
lost the opportunity of doing
that to the greatest advan-
tage, for unhappily we went
ashore just at high water,
and by this time it had
considerably fallen, so that
after she should be lightened
so as to draw as much less
water as the water had sunk,
we should be but in the
same situation as at first, and
the only alleviation of this
circumstance was that as the
tide ebbed the ship settled
on the rocks and was not
beaten against them with
much violence. We had
indeed some hope from the next tide, but it was doubtful
if she would hold together so long, especially as the rock
kept grating her bottom under the starboard bow with
such force as to be heard in the fore storeroom.”
Strenuous efforts at once were made to throw
overboard whatever was available for that purpose and
promised to lighten the ship materially by its absence.
Six cannon, iron and stone ballast, casks, hoop
staves, and other things were hurled into the sea.
“Everyone worked,” writes Cook, “with an alacrity
almost approaching to cheerfulness, without the least
repining or discontent, yet the men were so far
impressed with a sense of their situation that not an
oath was heard among them, the habit of profaneness,
CAPTAIN COOK.


however strong, being instantly subdued by the dread
of incurring guilt when death seemed to be so near.”
The crew was still engaged on the same occupation
when day broke, and the coastline was revealed about
eight leagues away, but without any intervening island
which might offer a landing place. What perhaps
formed the most terxdfying aspect of the situation was
that the ship did not carry boats enough to take away
all those on her. An adjacent island would have
afforded opportunity to land the party by making two
voyages, but at the distance the land lay, the destruction
of the ship must necessarily have involved considerable
loss of life, besides presenting terrible possibilities
during the last few minutes on the ship when there
would almost inevitably have been a struggle for what
means of escape were offering. High water was expected
at 11 o’clock in the forenoon. When the critical time
arrived, every effort to move the ship proved futile, and
as the water fell once more the sea rushed into what now
appeared to be the doomed vessel so fast that two
pumps continually working were unable to keep it out.
There was now no hope of getting the ship off till
the tide should rise again at midnight, and so badly
was the ship leaking that grave doubts were entertained
of her capacity to remain afloat if she should reach deep
water. At 5 o’clock in the afternoon the tide began to
rise, but so fast did the inrush of water increase that
a third pump was rigged up, but yet the water continued
rising in the hold. At 9 o’clock the ship righted herself.
The mental sufferings of all on board are graph-
ically described by Cook:—“We well knew that our
boats were not capable of carrying us all on shore,
and that when the dreadful crisis should arrive, as all
command and subordination would be at an end, a
contest for preference would probably ensue that would
increase the horrors of even shipwreck, and terminate
in the destruction of us all by the hands of each other;
yet we know that if any should be left on board to
perish in the waves they would probably suffer less upon
the whole than those who should get on shore, without
any lasting or effectual defence against the natives, in
a country where even nets and firearms would scarcely
furnish them with food, and where if they should find
the means of subsistence they must be condemned to
languish out the remainder of their life in a desolate
wilderness, without possession or even hope of any
domestic comfort, and cut off from all commerce with
mankind, except the naked savages who prowled the
desert, and whom perhaps were some of the most rude
and uncivilized upon the earth To those
only who have waited in a state of such suspense
death has approached in all its terrors, and as the
dreadful moment that was to determine our fate came
on everyone saw his own sensations pictured in the
countenances of his companions. However, the capstan
and windlass were manned with as many hands as
could be spared from the pumps, and the ship floating
about twenty minutes after 10 o’clock the effort was
made, and she was heaved into deep water.”
The ship was found not to make more water afloat
than she had done when on the rock. But already there
was a depth of three feet nine inches in the hold, and
the inflow was gaining on- the pumps. The crew, more-
over, was becoming exhausted. Twenty-four hours had
been spent in the most arduous toil, whilst the crew
was also suffering the effects of the great anxiety to
which it had been subjected. The pumps could be
kept going only by the men working in shifts of from
five to six minutes each, and those relinquishing the task
temporarily would fling themselves on the deck, where
they would lie almost motionless, with the water flowing
all round and over them. After almost frantic efforts
had been made the pumps began to gain slightly on the
leak, but it soon became apparent that the strain which
had accomplished this could not be maintained. In
the meantime some sail had been put upon the vessel,
as a kind of forlorn hope of reaching a harbour.
When the ship appeared doomed a suggestion was
made by a midshipman named Monhouse which proved
the salvation of the company. Acting on this proposal
a sail, made as watertight as possible, was passed under
the vessel by means of ropes, until it covered the hole
which was letting in the water. Such was the success
of this simple plan that instead of the leak gaining on
three pumps it was easily kept under by one. “This
was a new source of confidence and comfort,” writes
Cook, “the people could scarcely have expressed more
joy if they had Been already in port, and their views
were so far from being limited to running the ship
ashore in some harbour, either of an island or the main,
and building a vessel out of her materials to carry us
to the East Indies, which so lately had been the utmost
object of our hope, that nothing was now thought of
but ranging along the shore in search of a convenient
place to repair the damage she had sustained, and then
prosecuting the voyage upon the same plan as if nothing
had happened.”
The ship stood in for the shore, and early next
morning she passed two islands which were named Hope
Islands, because to reach them at one time represented
the furthermost limit of the crew’s expectations. The
following day, June 14, the entrance to a stream was
discovered. The opportunity had come none too soon.
After picking her way through shoals, and creeping as
near to the coast as was possible, the vessel had become
unmanageable, as the inflow of water had again obtained
mastery over the pumps. Advantage could not be taken
of the harbour at once. A fresh wind prevented the
vessel entering, and it was not until three days later that
she was taken in to the smooth water, and even then


she twice ran aground before being navigated into
shelter.
While the ship was being repaired an excellent
opportunity was presented for examining the flora and
fauna of the country, as well as the physical features.
A\ ith the exception of the stay of the expedition at
Botany Bay, this was the first time for white men to
investigate the east coast. At Endeavour River, as the
stream was named, Cook managed for the first time to
get into friendly contact with the natives. Naturally
the new land opened many unheard of wonders to the
eyes of the explorers. To the scientific members of the
party every day was packed with interest. To the
ordinary members of the crew some of the discoveries
made were not divorced from fear. One of the seamen was
greatly alarmed at the sight of a flying fox, which he
described in the following language: —“He was as
large as a one-gallon keg, and very like it; he had horns
and wings, yet he crept so slowly through the grass that
if I had not been afeard I might have touched him.”
A few days after landing Cook for the first time
met with a kangaroo. The animal had previously been
seen by other members of the expedition, and all sorts
of varied accounts had reached the commander of the
extraordinary creature which covered the ground by a
series of gigantic bounds. He writes: —“As I was
walking this morning at a little distance from the ship,
I saw myself one of the animals which had been so often
described. It was of a light mouse colour, and in size
and shape very much resembling a greyhound. It had
a long tail also, which it carried like a greyhound, and
I should have taken it for a wild dog, if instead of
running it had not leapt like a hare or deer. Its legs
were said to be very tender, and the print of its foot
to be like that of a goat, but where I saw it the grass
was so high that the legs were concealed, and the ground
was too hard to receive the track. Mr. Banks also had
an imperfect view of this animal, and was of opinion
that its species was hitherto unknown.”
After the party had been more than a week on
land acquaintance was made with the natives, four of
whom had appeared on the water with a small wooden
canoe to which an outrigger was attached. On this
occasion Cook decided to adopt a different means for
inducing the blacks to become friendly, and none of
the company took the slightest notice of the savages.
Ultimately two of the latter came close to the ship, and
talked in a loud voice. This was replied to by shouting
in a friendly tone, and though neither side could
understand a word of what the other was saying, the
blacks at last came alongside the ship, when cloth, nails,
beads, paper, and other presents were thrown to them.
For these offerings no satisfaction was expressed;
but when a fish was tossed to them they loudly
proclaimed their joy, and by signs intimated that they
would go away and bring their companions. Cordial
relations were soon established with the four blacks.
“Some parts of their bodies,” writes Cook in describing
them, “had been painted red, and the upper lip and
breast of one of them were painted with streaks of white,
which he called Carbanda. Their features were far from
disagreeable, their eyes were lively, and their teeth even
and white; their voices were soft and tuneful, and they
repeated many words after us with great facility.”
The natives brought others to meet the white men,
on each occasion introducing the strangers by name and
with much ceremony. On closer acquaintance it was
discovered that the skins of the blacks were not nearly so
dark as had at first been supposed; what had been
mistaken for the complexion in reality being the
accumulated leavings of smoke and dirt. The white
men assumed from this evidence that notwithstanding
the heat of the climate the savages contrived to sleep
in the heat and smoke of fires, as the only means for
keeping off the mosquitoes. Although not acquainted
with the native language, the visitors learned that
“kangaroo” was the native word for the strange animals,
one of which was shortly afterwards shot, and on being
examined at close quarters was minutely described in
the official account of the voyage.
The party had good reason to be pleased with
the country in which it was temporarily stranded.
Kangaroo was tasted, and proved to be excellent meat
to men who so long had subsisted on coarse ship fare.
Turtle was secured in plenty, and was described as being
greatly superior to the turtle obtainable in England.
Abundant fruit was also secured, as well as substitutes
for the customary vegetables. Just before the crew
landed an attack of scurvy had broken out on board the
ship. All traces of this disease completely disappeared
the first few days on land.
Having been about three weeks on shore the party was
afforded evidence of what a bush fire is like. This experi-
ence was encountered after a quit© large body of natives
had come on board the ship, who at first pleaded to be
given one of a dozen turtle which were on deck, and
afterwards attempted to secure the desired dainty by
force. Eventually the natives returned to shore in a
great passion, determined to wreak vengeance for not
having obtained what they wanted. A conflict followed,
in which it was necessary to pepper one of the blacks
in the legs with small shot. A means of inflicting injury
on the white men taken by the natives was by setting
fire to the grass. This threatened to burn a quantity of
the belongings of the expedition which had been landed
and left where they could easily be consumed by fire,
the members of the expedition not suspecting how
rapidly the dry grass would burn or how strong a fire
it would make. Only a few days before, by a lucky
accident, almost all the ship’s powder had been moved


from a spot where the flames would certainly have
exploded it. Fortunately a rescue was effected. The
dispute with the natives was ultimately settled.
Meanwhile great anxiety was caused to Cook and
his companions at the nature of the sea beyond the
entrance to the river. The ship had been navigated in,
but no passage could be discerned by which it
could be floated out again. Excursions were made
by means of boats, but nothing had been discovered
except banks of sand and shoals one after another
for as far as they were able to go. Observations were
taken from the top of a hill some few miles away, and
these showed almost endless sandbanks, which became
quite dry at low water. Only to the northward were
there any signs of the existence of a possible passage.
Eventually, however, all difficulties were overcome, and
the ship sailed into deep water.
Cook gives an interesting summary of what had
been discovered on this part of the new, strange
land: —“Besides the kangaroo and the opossum
that have been already mentioned, and a kind of
polecat, there are wolves upon this part of the coast, if
we were not deceived by tracks upon the ground, and
also several species of serpents, some of whom are
venomous and some harmless. There are no tame
animals here except dogs, and of these we saw but two
or three, which frequently came about the tents to
pick up scraps and bones that happened to lie scattered
near them. There does not indeed seem to be many of
any animal, except the kangaroo. We scarcely saw any
other above once, but this we met with almost every
time we went into the woods. Of land fowls we saw
crows, kites, hawks, cockatoos of two sorts (one white
and the other black), a very beautiful kind of loriquet,
some parrots, pigeons of two or three different sorts,
and several small birds not known in Europe. The face
of the country ... is agreeably diversified by hill
and valley, lawn and wood. The soil of the hills is
hard, dry, and stony, yet it produces coarse grass besides
wood. The soil of the plains and valleys is in some
places sand and in some clay. In some also it is reeky
and stony. In general, however, it is well clothed, and
has at least the appearance of fertility. The whole
country, both hill and valley, abounds with ant hills,
some of which are six or eight feet high and twice as
much in circumference. The trees here are not of many
sorts. The gum tree which we found on the southern
part of the coast is the most common, but here it is not
so large. On each side of the river, through its whole
course, there are mangroves in great numbers, which in
some places extend a mile within the coast. The country
is on all parts well watered, there being several fine
rivulets at a small distance from each other.”
After leaving the Endeavour River, the ship spent
several days trying to find a passage leading to the open
sea. Reefs and shoals appeared to hem in that part
of the coast. Five days after sail had been set Cook
named Cape Flattery, because he thought he saw a way
out in that direction, but was disappointed. On that
day the vessel appeared to get tangled in a regular maze
of reefs and islands, and in the hope of finding a way
out the commander landed and climbed a hill which he
named Point Lookout. The effort was destined to meet
with no success. Lizard Island and Eagle Island were
also visited, but the reefs appeared to lie everywhere.
On the following day, however, the ship was navigated
safely out of the danger zone. Once outside the shallow
water no ground could be found at a hundred and fifty
fathoms, and a big sea was rolling, the latter circum-
stances being recognized as a sign that neither land nor
shoals were near in the south-easterly direction from
which the swell was coming. The utmost relief was
experienced by everyone on board at having reached the
open sea. For nearly three months the ship had been
among shoals and reefs, surrounded by hidden dangers,
and often escaping destruction by the narrowest possible
margin. Three islands near the channel through which
the “Endeavour” reached the open water were named
the Islands of Direction.
But the perils which the “Endeavour” was to pass
through on the coast had not nearly ended with having
sailed out of the first ordeal. Only two days later,
at 3 o’clock in the morning, a long line of breakers was
discovered directly ahead. When the ship had stood
out from the ridge of spray and surf, against a wind
blowing directly on to it, for about two miles a calm
suddenly set in. To make matters worse no bottom
could be reached at a hundred and forty fathoms. Thus
there was no escape to be found in anchoring. The ship
began drifting steadily towards the long line of roaring
breakers, where a deep ocean swell was hurling itself
in a wild fury of flying spray. The only hope seemed to
lie in the boats. These were got out, but at best they
were able to do no more than postpone the fate
of the ship, which continued steadily to drift to the
long wall of angry foam and high-rising spray.
By the aid of oars the crews of the boats tried
to get the ship’s head turned away from the rocks.
“But it was 6 o’clock before this was effected,”
writes Cook, “and we were not more than a hundred
yards from the rock upon which the same billow which
washed the side of the ship broke to a tremendous height
the very next time it rose, so that between us and
destruction there was only a dreary valley, no wider
than the base of one wave, and even now the sea under
us was unfathomable, at least, no bottom was to be
found with a hundred and twenty fathoms.” When
death seemed but the matter of a few minutes, a slight
breeze sprang up, and with the aid of the boats it
proved enough to give the ship a slight motion obliquely


from the reef. But suddenly revived hopes were doomed
to meet with early disappointment. In less than ten
minutes complete calm again set in, and the ship once
more drifted directly towards the breakers, ultimately
reaching to within two hundred yards of the reef. But
once more a light breeze sprang up, and almost simul-
taneously the man aloft reported a small opening in the
reef. The gap in the rocks was of no greater breadth
than the length of the ship, and it lay about a quarter
of a mile away. On the far side lay smooth water.
Thus was a ray of hope introduced into what had
appeared a position whence there could be no escape.
A desperate struggle to reach the opening then
ensued, the rowers in the boats which were trying
to tow the ship being aided by the lightest possible of
winds. The most strenuous efforts, however, proved
breaking on the long line of coral grew closer. A
second opening in the reef was now discovered, and a
small boat was sent to ascertain whether it presented a
possible passage, for the ship was now closer to it than
to that first sighted. On a report being received that
the vessel might possibly negotiate the channel, which
however was full of dangers, it was resolved to make an
attempt which offered the only gleam of hope. Again
a light breeze arose, and with its aid, as well as that
of the boats, the “Endeavour” approached the entrance
of the channel, through which she was rapidly rushed
by a violently running stream of water, that left her
lying in the smooth water within. Her anchor was then
cast in nineteen fathoms. Thus did Captain Cook
discover the Great Barrier Reef, which lies parallel to
the eastern coast of Queensland for almost its whole
GOVERNMENT HOUSE AND DOMAIN, FROM PARLIAMENT HOUSE IN THE LATE SEVENTIES.
fated to meet with disappointment in a most unexpected
way. The ship was brought opposite to the opening in
the barrier reef, but it was only to meet with an ebb
tide flowing out like a milletream, and against which it
would have been utterly futile to attempt making any
headway. Indeed, the current for a while postponed
the danger to the "Endeavour” by carrying her for a
quarter of a mile away from the rocks within a few
minutes, and later in the day enabling the boats to get
the ship two miles from the line of surf.
But the advantage was short lived, for when the
tide turned, the current dragged the vessel closer to the
rocks once more. The crews in the boats did their best
to contend against the drift of the ship, but it was all
to no purpose, and the thunder of the deep ocean swell
distance. The navigator describes the reef in the
following words':—“Rocks and shoals are always
dangerous to the mariner, even where their situation
has been ascertained. They are more dangerous in seas
which have never before been navigated, and in this
part of the globe they are more dangerous than in any
other, for here they are reefs of coral, rising like a wall
almost perpendicularly out of the unfathomable deep,
always overflowed at high water, and at low water dry
in many placesand here the enormous waves of the
vast Southern Ocean, meeting with no resistance,
break with inconceivable violence in a surf which no
rocks or storms in the northern hemisphere can produce.
The danger of navigating unknown parts of this ocean
was now greatly increased by our having a crazy ship,


and being short of provisions and every other necessary,
yet the distinction of a first discoverer made us
cheerfully encounter every danger and submit to every
inconvenience, and we chose rather to incur the censure
of imprudence and temerity which the idle and
voluptuous so liberally bestow upon unsuccessful forti-
tude and perseverance, than leave a country which we
had discovered unexplored, and give colour to a charge
of timidity and irresolution.”
Although so many days had been spent in reaching
the open seas, Cook now resolved that he would remain
inside the reef and within sight of the land. He feared
if he once again crossed to the eastern side of the rocks
they might deflect his course too far from the continent,
and he was anxious to ascertain whether New Holland
was separated from New Guinea by water. The
“Endeavour” was kept at anchor until certain needed
repairs had been effected to one of the ship’s boats.
Land was about nine leagues distant, and within sight
of the ship was a lofty promontory, upon which Cook
bestowed its present name of Cape Weymouth.
At six the next morning sail was set, and the
“Endeavour” resumed her course, cautiously feeling her
way over the unknown waters which bristled with
hidden dangers and innumerable reefs. Cape Grenville
and Temple Bay were thus passed and named, the ship’s
pinnace preceding the barque and sounding the way.
On Tuesday, August 21, the “Endeavour” was abreast
of Cape York. Newcastle Bay was named and described
by Cook, and on the same day a landing was effected.
“As I was now about to quit the eastern coast of New
Holland,” wrote Cook, “which I had coasted from
latitude 38° to this place, and which I am confident
no European has ever seen before, I once more hoisted
English colours, and although I had already taken
possession of several particular parts, I now took
possession of the whole eastern coast, from latitude 38°
to this place, latitude 10|° S., in the right of His
Majesty King George the Third, by the name of New
South Wales, with all the bays, harbours, rivers, and
islands situated upon it. We then fired three volleys
of small arms, which were answered by the same number
from the ship. Having performed this ceremony upon
the island, which we called Possession Island, we
reimbarked in our boat, but a rapid ebb tide setting
N.E. made our return to the vessel very difficult and
tedious. From the time of our last coming among the
shoals we constantly found a moderate tide, the flood
setting in to the N.W. and the ebb to the S.E. At this
place it is high water at the full and change of the
moon, about 1 or 2 o’clock, and the water rises and falls
perpendicularly about twelve feet. We saw smoke
rising in many places from the adjacent lands and
islands, as we had done upon every part of the coast,
after our last return to it through the reef.”
A course was found to the westward through the
innumerable islands which cluster round that portion of
the coast. Wallis Islands and Prince of Wales Islands
were among those named on this voyage by Cook, who
here departed from the coast of New Holland, and con-
tinued his discoveries along the coast of New Guinea.
It was Cook’s impressions of Australia which in so
short a space of time brought British settlement to
the eastern side of the continent. No very glowing
description is given by him of the industrial possibilities
of the continent, though his account differs materially
from that of earlier discoverers, whose voyages took
them no farther than the arid west coast. After leaving
Cape York he wrote: —“New Holland, or as I have
called the eastern coast, New South Wales, is of larger
extent than any other country of the known world
that does not bear the name of a continent: the length
of the coast along which we sailed, reduced to a straight
line, is no less than twenty-seven degrees of latitude,
amounting to near 2,000 miles, so that its square surface
must be much more than equal to all Europe. To the
southward of 33° or 34° the land in general is low and
level; farther northward it is hilly, but in no part can
be called mountainous, and the hills and mountains
taken together make but a small part of the surface in
comparison with the valleys and plains. It is upon the
whole rather barren than fertile, yet the rising ground
is chequered by woods and lawns, and the plains and
valleys in many places covered with herbage. The soil,
however, is frequently sandy, and many of the lawns,
or savannahs, are rocky and barren, especially to the
northward, where in the best spots vegetation was less
vigorous than in the southern part of the country; the
trees were not so tall nor the herbage so rich. The grass
in general is high but thin, and the trees, where they
are largest, are seldom less than forty feet asunder; nor
is the country inland, as far as we could examine it,
better clothed than the sea coast. The banks of the
bays are covered with mangroves to the distance of a
mile from the beach, under which the soil is a rank
mud that is always overflowed by a spring tide. Farther
in the country, we sometimes met with a bog, upon
which the grass was very thick and luxuriant, and some-
times with a valley that was clothed with underwood.
The soil in some parts seemed to be capable of improve-
ment, but the far greater part is such as can admit of no
cultivation. The coast, at least that part of it which lies
to the northward of 25° S., abounds with fine bays and
harbours, where vessels may lie in perfect security from
all the winds. If we may judge by the appearance of
the country while we were there, which was in the very
height of the dry season, it is well watered. We found
innumerable brooks and springs, but no great rivers;
these brooks, however, probably became large in the
rainy season.”


CHAPTER V.
THE FIRST SETTLEMENT OF AUSTRALIA.
After Cook’s first voyage to the coast of what was
destined to become the State of Queensland a long
period of inactivity ensued, so far as that part of the
continent was concerned. Indeed, the results accruing
from the visit of the “Endeavour” were postponed
generally. Only two powers were at that stage of the
world s history likely to take advantage of the discoveries
made. They were France and England. During the
years when these countries otherwise might have been
colonizing the southern continent, France was suffering
the social and political unrest which was to break into
the conflagration of the bloody revolution, whilst
England was engaged in war with her American colonies.
In 1772 the French sent Captain du Fresne on a
voyage of discovery to New Holland, and he landed on
the coast of Tasmania, where an encounter took place
between the Europeans and the natives. No important
results accrued from the expedition, so far as the
development of Australia was concerned, except that it
served as an impetus to prompt other navigators to
visit Australia.
During the next year Captain Cook again set out
from England, this time with two vessels. Cook himself
sailed in the “Resolute,” whilst Captain Furneaux
commanded the “Adventure.” On the way the ships
separated, and Cook sailed for New Zealand, whilst
Furneaux made a course for Tasmania, which he reached
on March 9. Impressions gained by the company of
the “Adventure” of the dense vegetation with which
Tasmania was clothed, and of the magnificent fresh-
water streams entering the sea, added to the curiosity
in England as to the possibilities of successfully
colonizing New Holland. Furneaux left believing
Tamania to be joined to the mainland. For the
following four years no visitor approached Australian
waters.
In January of 1777 Cook once more touched upon
the coast of the land he had done so much to make
known. This time it was on the coast of Tasmania
where he landed, having entered Adventure Bay, which
Furneaux had previously discovered. Cook was filled
with enthusiasm at the prolific and verdant nature of
the vegetation, the beautiful hills, the towering forest,
and the sparkling streams of fresh water. What he
saw was further evidence to stimulate the colonizing
activities of the British Government in regard to these
new lands in the south. After spending a week at
Adventure Bay, Cook sailed for New Zealand.
For eleven years after the final departure of Cook
silence brooded over the new continent. No sail specked
the horizon round her thousands of miles of coastline,
and no white man’s foot trod her soil. Great and far-
reaching events were absorbing the whole attention of
civilization on the opposite side of the globe, and for
a few more years the natives of Australia’s unknown
interior were allowed, uninterrupted by any unwelcome
civilizing hand of white men, to pursue the primitive
savagery which had been theirs for so many generations.
The subsequent settlement of New South Wales provided
the beginnings of the colonization of Queensland.
The awakening came in January of 1788, when
memory of the previous visits of the Europeans must
have been almost forgotten by the natives who had
come into contact with them. Botany Bay appears
always to have been a comparatively thickly populated
portion of the coast, possibly on account of the facilities
for catching fish which its waters offered. It was here
where Englishmen again landed, in a party consisting not
of one ship’s company paying a flying visit in order to
carry away tales of the unknown southern continent,
but no fewer than a thousand souls conveyed in a fleet
of ships and equipped for the permanent occupation of
the country. Altogether there were three men-
of-war, six convict ships, and three vessels laden with
stores, arms, and other necessary material for planting
a penal establishment in an unexplored wilderness. The
American War of Independence had closed the old
outlet for convicted persons whom it was desired to
deport from the parent country, and in consequence an
expedition had been sent to Botany Bay under the
command of Captain Phillip. Nothing could have been
much more remarkable than the varied assortment of
people making up the new colony. The prisoners
included members of almost all classes of society.
Educated men who were being punished for what then
were regarded as political offences, but which now would
not be regarded as any offence at all, were herded with
the most brutal and hardened of hereditary criminals.
The officials were inspired with the then prevailing
idea that convicted persons could be managed only by
the application of unrelenting force, and the whole
party was awed at the task of founding a settlement on
an isolated continent, about which so little was known,
and which was separated from civilization by many
weary months of sailing even in the best and fastest
ships then afloat.
Unlike the landing of Cook at the same place, the
approach of the first boatload of Captain Phillip’s party
met with no resistance from the natives. The crew of
the first boat, which was followed at short intervals by
others, made demonstrations of friendship which
apparently were understood by the blacks. The white


men landed without conflict, and the blacks were soon
mixing with them endeavouring to understand the
strange collection of novel sights, and gazing admiringly
at the gaudy naval uniforms of the officers in command.
Botany Bay had been selected for the site of the
settlement by the British authorities on the strength
of the description which Cook had given of it. Certainly
that discoverer cannot be blamed for permitting his
imagination to run away wth him, or even of writing
any account not characterized by accurate observation
and keen critical judgment. That the examination of
the place by the expedition led to disappointing results
was not the fault of Cook but of the Home Government
for not first making an examination of the coast with
the object of finding whether the many bays with which
it was marked might not offer some more favourable
sight. Captain, or Governor, Phillip found that the
eastern side of the bay, where fresh water lay, was
shallow and exposed to easterly winds. The western
side of the bay was more sheltered, and afforded deeper
water, but no drinking water could be found in the
neighbourhood. As the first object in view was the
building of a town, Phillip naturally hesitated about
starting operations on any site but which he thought
might offer reasonable chances of permanent success.
The situation was filled with a good deal of
perplexity. Here was a colony of people, the minority
of whom were enforcing discipline, which for their own
protection, as well as for other reasons, they could not
relax on the majority, sent across the globe to found
a settlement on a spot found to be unsuitable for the
purpose. No one on board knew if any other part of
the coast would supply the requirements they needed.
Except what Captain Cook had written, nothing was
known of the two thousand miles of the eastern
coast on which he had been instructed to found
a town. Governor Phillip did not dare to land his
company at Botany Bay, fearing the difficulty of getting
them embarked again, when the necessity arose for
sailing elsewhere, as he intended to do if he could
discover some more hospitable locality.
The fleet remained at anchor in Botany Bay while
Phillip put out on to the ocean in an open boat and
sailed northward along the coast. His enterprise was
soon crowned with success beyond his wildest expecta-
tions. He had not proceeded more than a few miles
before discovering a wide opening in the high cliffs
of sandstone which form the coast in that region. On
the summit of the cliffs natives stood waving spears at
the intruder as he drew nearer to the land. Immediately
behind the opening in the coast was a headland which
gave the inlet the appearance of being no more than
an indentation in the walls of stone which face the
ocean just there. But as the boat penetrated the bay
unexpected expanses of landlocked water opened up on
both sides. In a very few minutes the little craft was
sailing on perfectly still water, where not even a trace
of the swell from without had penetrated. The
crew was filled with wonder. The bay, which Cook had
not troubled to examine, but had merely passed on
his way and had named Port Jackson, was showing
itself to be perhaps the finest natural harbour in the
world. Estuaries, islets, points of land, and tiny coves
stretched as far as could be seen in almost every
direction, whilst the land was covered with thick timber
and thickly laden with a great variety of luxuriant
vegetation. The harbour bore an almost fairylike
beauty, and the farther the boat explored the more
numerous became the openings and landlocked waters
stretching away in the distance. After proceeding about
six miles up the bay, Phillip saw a spot which he
thought offered particular facilities for forming a
settlement. A landing was effected here, and the spot
named Sydney Cove, after Thomas Townsend Viscount
Sydney, who was a member of the younger Pitt’s
administration.
Governor Phillip spent three days exploring the
neighbourhood of Sydney Cove, and so satisfied was he
with what he found that he returned to Botany Bay
with instructions that the ships should immediately sail
for the newly-found harbour. Next day was chosen
for the move, but at daybreak the little colony met
with a startling surprise. As the rays of the rising sun
lit up the horizon to seaward two strange ships came
into sight. None on board believed that any European
was within thousands of miles, and the utmost excite-
ment prevailed to ascertain who the newcomers were.
As the ships entered the bay, for which they proved to
be bound, they were seen to be flying the French colours.
They were the exploring ships “Astrolabe” and
“Bossole,” under the command of La Perouse. The
Frenchmen had put in for wood and water with which
to continue their expedition, and their surprise at
finding a British fleet at anchor within the harbour was
at least equal to the astonishment they themselves had
produced in the minds of the first comers. The French
expedition remained with the Englishmen until
March 10, when it sailed away, never again to set
eyes on Christian people.
As soon as the convicts and their guards had been
got on shore, together with the necessary equipment,
a commencement was made towards clearing the land
and erecting storehouses and other buildings. The work
necessarily was slow, for the prisoners could not be
made to work as free labourers would have done.
Escapes were of frequent occurrence at first, but the
men who broke away had nothing to look to but
starvation in an uninviting wilderness or death among
unknown savages. Usually, after a few days spent
alone, they were anxious to return and receive the


punishment they knew would be theirs. Many of these
had implored La Perouse to take them away with him,
but in each instance he had the applicants returned to
their guards.
Meanwhile Phillip was making periodical jour-
neys inland. The dense timber and undergrowth
rendered such woxdc most difficult; indeed, for years
afterwards the Blue Mountains presented a barrier to
the interior which resisted every attempt to cross so as
to reach the opposite slopes. During his term of office
as Governor of New South Wales, Phillip sent Captain
Philip Gidle King to establish a settlement at Norfolk
Island. It was there that the son of the latter,
afterwards Rear-Admiral Philip P. King, the celebrated
explorer, was born.
Within the second year of the occupation of the
January, 1789, provisions threatened to run short, and
the “Sirius” had to be sent to the Cape of Good Hope
for supplies. The vessel returned to Sydney in May
of the same year, but in 1790 no other stores had been
received, and a famine was threatened. The allowance
of food to the inhabitants had to be cut down, and as
the “Sirius” had been wrecked at Norfolk Island the
same means for obtaining relief as had existed in the
past were cut off. No ship had reached Sydney from
England since the expedition had arrived. “On the one
side was an unknown shore and a shipless sea, on the
other an apparently limitless country inhabited by
savages, in which not a step could be taken without
danger of being totally lost, a country which produced
no wild fruit or root fit for the sustenance of man, and,
with the exception of a wandering kangaroo or a shy,

continent, the first claim of gold having been discovered
was made. A convict named James Daley produced a
piece of what appeared to be stone bearing a considerable
quantity of precious metal. He refused to say where
the stone came from, but Governor Phillijo compelled
the man to walk before him to the spot, threatening
him with instant death if he did not reveal the locality.
Daley then protested that he had filed down a yellow
metal buckle, mixed with it some particles of gold
filed from a guinea, and had blended the whole with
clay which he had rendered very hard. Considerable
doubt exists as to which of the man’s two statements
contained the truth.
The following two years proved pregnant with
suspense and difficulty for the infant colony. In
swift emu, no game of any size fit for food.” The
community was faced with starvation. This state of
suspense and difficulty continued until half way through
the year. On June 3 the “Lady Juliana” arrived from
London with a cargo of provisions and livestock. At
short intervals four other ships followed, and the
position was thus alleviated.
After having been Governor for five years, Phillip
sailed for England on December 11, 1792. Through
constantly occurring difficulties and many privations
he had never once lost his confident optimism in the
successful future of the settlement. Undoubtedly the
conditions of life during these first few years imposed the
utmost strain on the endurance of the responsible
officials, and it is recorded of Phillip that he voluntarily


and cheerfully shared with those under his command
the hardships which shortage of food and the lack of
facilities for production imposed. In many respects the
colony was founded on lines quite unique in the history
of the conquest of new lands. Phillip exercised the
functions of the complete autocrat responsible to no
power in the same hemisphere. That he exercised his
wide functions wisely was shown by the subsequent
success of the colony and by the skill in which the
community in his charge was piloted through the perils
of the early days. Had his command been more
restricted, probably the same results would not have
been attained. “Powers equal to those of the first
Governor of New South Wales,” writes an authority on
Australian history, “if held, have never been exercised
by any other official in the British dominions. He could
fine £SOO, regulate customs and trade, fix prices and
wages, remit capital as well as other sentences, bestow
grants of land, and create a monopoly of any article of
necessity. All the labour in the colony was at his
disposal; all the land, all the stores, all the places of
honour and profit, and virtually all the justice.” The
same historian goes on to describe the difficulties with
which the colony was faced and the dreary surroundings
among which Governor Phillip maintained his happy
expectations, in the following words:—“Under the
absolute government described, the settlers were crowded
together on a narrow space, a promontory cleared of
dense forest. The soil was barren sand; every yard
required for cultivation had to be gained by removing
enormous trees of a hardness that tried the temper of
the best axes wielded in skilled hands.” When Governor
Phillip left the settlement the number of livestock was
182, the land under cultivation totalled 1,703 acres, and
the population about 3,500 souls, exclusive of those on
Norfolk Island.
Governor Hunter succeeded Governor Phillip, but
the former did not arrive at Sydney until 1795. During
the intervening three years the charge of the settlement
fell upon the shoulders first of Major Francis Grose and
then of Captain Paterson. Of this period perhaps the
most notable event was the arrival on January 10 of
the "Bellona, which brought the first shipload of free
settlers to Australian shores. Special terms had been
offered by the Government to these daring pioneers of
the unknown wilderness. Each was furnished with
agricultural implements, provisions sufficient to last for
two years, and assigned servants. The newcomers first
settled a few miles to the west of Sydney, but they
afterwards moved to Hawkesbury River, where the soil
was so much more prolific. One of the handicaps under
which the colony had to labour was the poverty of
nearly all the soil within many miles of Sydney.
The search for more prolific land which could be
cultivated without the enormous expenditure of labour
in clearing away timber, which was entailed in founding
any branch of agriculture in the coastal country, led to
numerous efforts at crossing the Blue Mountains. For
many years the attention of the colony was concentrated
more on discovering what lay beyond the sandstone
cliffs and rugged peaks than on any other exploration.
Little doubt now remains that a convict named
Wilson crossed the Blue Mountains in 1799. Several
attempts had been previously made to accomplish the
same purpose, including one by Lieutenant Bass in 1796,
but all had been fated to meet with disappointment.
The account given by Wilson was disbelieved at the
time by all but Governor Hunter. It has since been
ascertained that the convict was strictly adhering to
the truth in his statements, and historians are strongly
of opinion that he penetrated as far as the Lachlan
River. Unfortunately no advantage was taken of the
very valuable discovery.
Lieutenant Barreiller set out in an endeavour to
cross the range, but the deep ravines and unscaleable
precipices baffled all his efforts, and he returned to
confess failure. A couple of years afterwards Mr. Caley
made the attempt, and though he succeeded in pene-
trating much farther into the unknown than any free
explorer had done before, he was not able to reach the
other side of the mountains. Successive other attempts
met with similar failure. Deep ravines, high cliffs
rising abruptly from the tangled forest below, craggy
watercourses, dense undergrowth, and the chaotic lie
of the ranges themselves, completely defeated the best
thought-out plans of all the explorers until 1813.
In the latter year Lieutenant Lawson and Messrs.
Wentworth and Blaxland set out to repeat the efforts
which so often before had met with failure. The
expedition was the result of dry weather, the effects of
which had been accentuated by the colony, together
with its flocks and herds, having outgrown the means
of subsistence offered by the barren and limited space
between the range and the sea. The grass had all
disappeared, and sheep and cattle were dying
fast. After crossing the Nepean River and becoming
entangled in a maze of difficulties, the party at last
found a spur which appeared to lead in the required
direction. The explorers kept to the ridge of the rising
ground, and though being compelled to fight a con-
tinuous series of obstructions, they at last found
themselves upon the summit of the main range.
A beautiful valley opened out before the admiring
eyes of the discoverers. Abundant grass clothed its
slopes, and refreshing streams provided ample water.
Here was relief for the whole colony, which was suffering
such hardships, and which so ardently was hoping for
the successful result of the efforts of the explorers. But
from the lie of the rivers it was clear that the dividing
line between the eastern and the western watersheds

had not yet been crossed. For some distance the party
penetrated the valley, and at each mile it advanced
the country improved. Having established the fact that
the worst difficulties of the passage to the interior of
the continent had been passed, and finding themselves
threatened with an early shortage of provisions, the
party returned to Sydney, having discovered Bathurst
Plains, and with the tidings of the relief to the colony.
Immediately upon the return of Messrs. Lawson,
Wentworth, and Blaxland, the deputy surveyor-general
of the colony (Mr. Evans) was sent out to follow up
the welcome discoveries. On November 26 he reached
the termination of the journey of the others, and four
days later he crossed the great dividing range between
the two watersheds. Mr. Evans discovered the
Macquarie River, which he followed until December 18.
Wide, fertile plains, where kangaroos, emus, and other
native game abounded, were passed on either side. The
luxuriant pasturage offered undreamed of opportunities
for pastoral enterprise, whilst the stream teemed with
fish. The land was untimbered, and free of stones,
characteristics which at the time were considered as
presenting difficulties to the settlement, owing to the
absence of building materials, but which in reality
meant that the country, instead of being fit for
agriculture only after a mighty forest had been grubbed,
as was the case nearer the coast, was ready for the
plough without any preparation whatever. Mr. Evans
and his party penetrated to a point 100 miles west of
the Nepean River in a straight line before returning to
Sydney.
The discoveries of the country beyond the mountains
opened a new hope to the inhabitants of Sydney, and
presented fresh and dazzling prospects for the future of
the State. The first thought was to move the starving
stock to where the pastures were so plentiful and water
so abundant. The construction of the road over the
range was undertaken without any delay, and in January,
1815, it was finished. This point marks the beginning
of the real industrial future of New South Wales. How
rapid was the immediate progress is illustrated by the
following figures:
CHAPTER VI.
EARLY SYDNEY.
Until 1859, when separation was granted to the
northern colony, the history of Queensland is contained
within the history of New South Wales. It was the
political evolution of the parent settlement which
formed the basis of the mode of self-government after-
wards applied to Moreton Bay, and it was from Sydney
that exploring parties in search of pastoral land in the
north radiated. Thus, following on the conquest of the
Blue Mountains in 1812, came the discovery of the
Darling Downs.
Up to Governor Macquarie’s term of office, from
1810 to 1822, the colony proved the victim to many
dissensions, in which the authorities themselves were
torn into conflicting parties. In 1808 Governor Bligh,
who had succeeded King, was placed under arrest and
kept in captivity for twelve months, whilst Major
Johnston, commander of the New South Wales Corps,
carried on the functions of representative of the King.
Bligh was popular among the free settlers and the better
part of the emancipists, and ultimately he was allowed
to take command of the “Porpoise,’’ on the undertaking
being given by him that he would sail for England.
However, he sailed for Van Diemen Land, where an
attempt was made to seize him, as a result of communi-
cations received by the authorities there from Sydney.
The attempt failed. Bligh remained about Australian
waters until Governor Macquarie arrived in December,
1809. He followed Macquarie into Sydney, and a few
weeks afterwards sailed for England, where Major
Johnston was afterwards tried by courtmartial on a
charge of mutiny. The latter was cashiered from the
service. The whole quarrel had arisen over commercial
matters, and it served to very strikingly manifest the
dangers arising from the constitution of such a settle-
ment, situated so many months’ sail away from the
centre of government.
Rapid progress was made in all directions during
Macquarie’s term. Writing to Earl Bathurst just after
his arrival back in England, the late Governor said:
“I found a colony barely emerging from infantile
imbecility, and suffering from various privations and
disabilities, the country impenetrable beyond forty
miles from Sydney, agriculture in a yet languishing
state, commerce in its early dawn, revenue unknown,
threatened with famine, distracted by faction, the
public buildings in a state of delapidation and


mouldering to decay, the population in general
depressed by poverty, no public credit nor private
confidence, the morals of the great mass of the
population in the lowest state of debasement, and
religious worship almost totally neglected. Such was
the state of New South Wales when I took charge of its
administration on January 1, 1810. I left it in February
last, reaping incalculable advantages from my extensive
and important discoveries in all directions, including
the supposed insurmountable barrier called the Blue
Mountains, to the westward of which are situated the
fertile plains of Bathurst, and in all respects enjoying
a state of private comfort and public prosperity.” The
opinion expressed here by Macquarie of the condition of
the settlement when he took charge of it was fully
corroborated by the views uttered by Bligh before the
arrest of the latter. Bligh had painted the condition of
the colony in the most gloomy of colours.
The foundations of a great and immediate industrial
expansion had been laid in Macquarie’s time, and during
the years 1821-1825, when Sir Thomas Brisbane held
the office of Governor, an increased stream of free
immigration began to flow from the United Kingdom
to Australia. Prior to then only a few families had
voluntarily come to the colony. Accounts of the great
fertile plains beyond the Blue Mountains, of the growing
prosperity of the early pioneers, and of the untold
potentialities of the new land generally, were beginning
to make headway in the United Kingdom.
In the early twenties it was decided to establish
penal settlements to the north of Port Jackson, and one
was formed at Port Macquarie. Mr. Oxley was ordered
to explore Port Bowen and Moreton Bay, which task
was carried out by him in 1823. As a consequence of
his discovery of the Brisbane River the settlement was
moved from Port Macquarie, and what is now the city
of Brisbane was founded.
The following year the Legislative Council was
constituted, the Proclamation appearing in the Sydney
Gazette of August 11, 1824. The Governor received the
following despatch from Earl Bathurst, Secretary of
State :
“Downing Street, January 19, 1824.
“Sir,
“It being provided by the Act of the 4th
George IV., cap. 96, that His Majesty may, by warrant
under His Royal sign manual, constitute and appoint
a Council for the Colony of New South Wales, and that
the Governor, with the advice of such Council, shall have
power and authority to make laws and ordinances for
the peace, welfare, and good government of the said
Colony, I have the honour herewith to transmit to you
His Majesty’s mandamus nominating the five principal
officers in the Colony to seats on the Council.
“I am to desire that you will particularly explain
to the gentlemen selected that the nomination of the
present Council is only intended to be pro tempore, that
the warrant will be revoked as soon as I shall have
received from you the names of ten of the principal
merchants and landholders whom you may consider
eligible to form the Council, from which His Majesty
will select as many as may be deemed proper. I,
however, reserve to myself the power of submitting the
names of any of the members of the present Council for
re-appointment, should I consider it to be advisable.
“I have the honour to be,
“Sir,
“Your most obedient and humble servant,
“Bathurst.
“Governor Sir Thomas Brisbane, K.C.8., etc., etc., etc.”
This first Legislative Council was composed of
the following officials:—William Stewart, Lieutenant-
Governor; Francis Forbes, Chief Justice; Frederick
Goulburn, Colonial Secretary; James Bowman, Principal
Colonial Surgeon; and John Oxley, Surveyor-General.
The following year these appointments were revoked in
accordance with the intentions expressed in the letter
already quoted. A new Council was appointed, but it
consisted of all the same members as the old, with the
exception of Mr. Oxley, whose place was filled by
Archdeacon Scott. The new Council continued sittings,
interrupted by only short intervals, until 1825, when
legislation was passed regulating the granting of hotel
licences and the sale of spirits and other liquor in New
South Wales and Van Diemen Land, the relief of
debtors in prison, the regulation of shipping, the
regulation and collection of customs and duties* the
prevention of smuggling, the regulation of postages of
letters in New South Wales, and the naturalization of
aliens.
The Imperial Parliament granted trial by jury in
1824, and the same year the Supreme Court of New
South Wales was established. Mr. Francis Forbes was
appointed to be the first Chief Justice, and the court, in
its criminal jurisdiction, sat for the first time on
June 10, 1824. The first civil jury was empanelled on
November 1, 1824. During the same year the censorship,
which previously had been exercised over the Press, was
removed. During the four years of Governor Brisbane’s
term of office the population of the Colony increased
from 29,783 to 33,675, and the revenue from £36,231 to
£71,682. Brisbane was subsequently recalled as a
result of commercial embarrassment which followed his
action in establishing a colonial currency which raised
the pound sterling 25 per cent, in value.
Several important events in the evolution of the
settlement of Australia took place during the six vears
in which Lieutenant-General Ralph Darling filled the


position of Governor. His first official act was the
declaration of the independence of Van Diemen Land,
which ceremony was performed by Darling while on his
way to New South Wales in 1825. This was the first
separation of a political kind made in the administra-
tion of the colony. Queensland was still unexplored,
and practically the whole of the white population on
the continent was clustered about Sydney, except, of
course, for the early settlement made by the penal
authorities in Tasmania.
Governor Darling utilized his powers in a manner
which appears distasteful to the democratic spirit pre-
vailing in Australia during more recent times. One of
his first acts was to appoint a new Legislative Council,
consisting as follows : —President —The Governor ;
perpetual clause should be part of any temporary law;
no law was to be re-enacted to which the Royal assent
had once been refused without express leave for that
purpose having been first obtained through the Imperial
Government, nor was the enactment of any law repealing
any law passed by the Legislative Council to be pro-
posed, whether the same had or had not received the
Royal approbation, unless a clause was inserted therein
suspending and deferring the execution thereof until the
King’s pleasure should be known concerning the same;
no laws whatsoever—except upon some unforeseen
emergency —were to be made to continue for less than
two years, neither was any Act to be passed whereby the
revenue might be lessened or impaired without special
leave or commands thereon ; no law or ordinance was to
PETRIE'S BIGHT AND WHARFES IN THE LATE SEVENTIES.
Official Members—Colonel Stewart (Lieutenant-Gover-
nor), Chief Justice Forbes, Archdeacon Scott, and
Alexander Macleay (Colonial Secretary); Non-official
• Members—Messrs. John Macarthur, Robert Campbell,
sen., and Charles Throsby. The non-official members
were not included in the Executive Council. The
Governor lost little time in limiting the self-governing
powers of the colony, though, as he himself appointed
the Council, it may easily be seen that these, in any
case, were visionary rather than real. Just two months
after the new Council had been sworn in Darling laid
before it an extract of the King’s Instructions, which
was ordered to be entered in the minutes.
The Instructions laid down rules for observance in
the enactment of laws. The chief points were: —No
be proposed for the nationalization of aliens, nor for
divorce, nor for establishing a title to lands, tenements,
and real estates in the territory or its dependencies,
originally granted to, or purchased by, aliens antecedent
to naturalization; no law or ordinance of an unusual and
extraordinary nature and importance whereby the
Crown’s prerogative or the property of the subject might
be prejudiced; nor any law, whereby the trade or ship-
ping of the kingdom should be in any way affected, was
to be proposed until the draft of such laws or ordinances
had been transmitted through the Secretary of State for
Royal pleasure.
Considerable political controversy stirred the colony
during the immediately subsequent years. One result was
the institution, under the Governor’s direction, of a


series of libel cases. The libel law at that time con-
tained very drastic provisions, and the proprietors of
The Monitor and The A ustralian were both prosecuted
civilly and criminally, and were heavily fined as well as
imprisoned. In 1827 a stringent law regulating the
publication of newspapers was passed, but the provisions
of this legislation were amended in 1830. About the
same time legislation was passed providing for trial by
jury. A clause enacted that no man who had been
attainted of crime, 1 unless he had received a pardon,
should be qualified to serve on a jury. This was inter-
preted as excluding the great bulk of the Emancipists,
and a storm of conflict was aroused.
During the last year of Darling’s term—on August 2,
1831 —a notification appeared in the Sydney Gazette to
the effect that in future Crown lands would be disposed
of by auction sale only and at a minimum price of ss.
per acre. The terms of sale were that 10 per cent, of the
purchase-money was to be paid in the form of a deposit,
and the rest was to be forthcoming within a month. In
the event of default the deposit was forfeited and the
land resubmitted for sale.
The industrial development of the colony was inter-
rupted by an unfortunate boom and consequent reaction,
beginning about 1826. About that time the Australian
Agricultural Company was extending operations over
very large areas of land, and was actively buying up all
the stock it could get, in order to make its various hold-
ings productive. The purchases were made rapidly and
on an extensive scale. The result was greatly increased
returns for pastoralists, who hitherto had lacked buyers
for the natural increase of their flocks and herds. The
stock market became a centre of gambling. “Barristers
and attorneys, military officers of every rank and civilians
of every department, clergymen and medical men, mer-
chants, settlers, and dealers in general were seen pro-
miscuously mingled together every Thursday” at the
cattle market each striving to outbid the other. When
the high prices reached a culminating point a long
drought happened and lasted for three years. Stock,
which had been bought at fictitious values, died in thou-
sands, and all the owners had to show for their specu-
lation was the liability represented by long-dated bills
which they had given in payment. They had depended
on reselling the stock in order to meet the bills; but the
buyers had vanished from the market; pastoralists all
were sellers; and the bills were falling due simultaneously.
Many fortunes were lost and families ruined. Distress
became common, and matters were made worse by the
high prices ruling for foodstuffs, the latter circumstance
being a direct result of the boom. In the craze to be
possessed of cattle, landholders had altogether neglected
agriculture, and in consequence grain, which otherwise
would have been produced locally, had to be imported
from Van Diemen Land and elsewhere.
The financial depression produced a considerable
check on the influx of free immigration. But about 1831
settlers again began to make their way to Australian
shores. In that year Dr. Lang brought about sixty
Scotch mechanics with their wives and families, whilst
about the same time a shipload of female immigrants
arrived from Ireland. In 1837 the growth of the settle-
ment by free immigration was further helped forward by
Dr. Lang. For some years he had been endeavouring to
induce the Government of New South Wales to earmark
that part of the revenue which was derived from land
for the purpose of assisting free immigration. But his
appeals were in vain. Then he turned his attention to
the Imperial authorities, where his arguments met with
a more encouraging reception. In consequence of the
case put forward by Dr. Lang, the Bight Honourable
Lord Glenelg, Secretary of State for the Colonies,
organized an agency for the promotion of voluntary
emigration. The scheme proved of great benefit,
and added a considerable proportion of a desir-
able class of population at a time when progress
depended more on immigration than on any other
single factor.
CHAPTER VII.
FOUNDING A CONSTITUTION
The Legislative Council, which up to that time had
passed laws for New South Wales, was superceded in
1843. When the Council met in January of that year
Governor Gibbs, in his opening speech, announced that
an Act had been passed in the last session of the Imperial
Parliament for the better government of New South
Wales, and that it had been received and proclaimed in
the colony during the then current month. The Council
was directed, under the Act, to make the necessary pro-
visions for giving effect to the Imperial enactments under
which a Parliament was to be constituted in the colony.
The Council had been summoned at an early date to
comply with these directions. The Council was there-
upon to commit political suicide by passing a Bill in
accordance with the Imperial legislation.
“An Act for the better government of New South
W ales and Van Diemen Land,” as passed by the Imperial
Government, was then laid upon the table of the Council.
The official ‘History of New South Whies” gives the
following epitome of the measure ; —“By it a Legislature


of one House was constituted to consist of 36 members,
of whom six were to be Government officers, six Crown
nominees, the remaining 24 to be elected by the poeple,
viz., 18 for New South Wales proper and six for Port
Phillip. The franchise was a £2O rental, or a freehold
of £2OO in value; and the qualification for elective mem-
bers was property to the amount of £2,000, or of £lOO
yearly value. Provision was also made for local govern-
ment in different parts of the colony by means of Dis-
trict Councils, which should have power to make and
maintain public works and buildings; to raise the means
of defraying expenses connected with the administration
of justice; to provide for the support of schools and
kindred institutions; and for other matters specially
subjected to their direction. Schedules were annexed to
the Act providing for the yearly payment of £51,600
for the heads of the executive and administrative
dejDartments (Schedules A and B), and of £30,000 for
public worship (Schedule C).” A Bill to provide for the
division of the colony into Electoral Districts, and for
the election of members to serve in the Legislative
Council, was read a first time in the Council on
January 24, and was finally passed on February 23, 1843,
the old Council then terminating its existence.
The new form of government fell far short of meet-
ing the wishes of the people of the colony, who were
prepared to be satisfied with little short of complete
local autonomy. One grievance was that any official
appointed by the Imperial authorities should be paid a
salary raised by New South Wales. This applied par-
ticularly to the Governor. Objection was taken to the
expenditure of any money raised in the colony resting in
the power of the British Legislature. But feeling ran
most strongly on the management of the lands not having
been entrusted to the local governing body. There were
several reasons for this attitude. One was that whatever
value the land possessed had been given to it by the
settlers, and that morally the land belonged to them, and
not to the Government of the United Kingdom. This
was accentuated by what was strongly felt to be the
blundering mismanagement of the land question. The
colonists were of the opinion that statesmen on the oppo-
site side of the globe were not in a position to decide
most successfully what was the best policy of settlement
to pursue; and a particular grievance lay in the high
purchase price of £1 per acre, which had greatly retarded
the alienation of the freehold. It was not doubted in
those days that settlement, to be successful and per-
manent, must proceed on a basis of private ownership.
Indeed, no other practical system was in operation. A
further cause of complaint was to be found in the
undemocratic nature of government without representa-
tion, which prevailed in so many spheres of legislative
and administrative activity over which the local Legis-
lature held no jurisdiction. The expenditure of the
purchase-money of the land on objects outside Australia
caused continual heartburning.
These sentiments found expression in the Legislative
Council during 1850, when resolutions were passed on the
motion of Mr. William Charles Wentworth, a barrister,
who sat for Sydney. Next year the Council received
in reply a despatch from Earl Grey, who was then
Secretary of State for the Colonies. He pointed out that
“the Home Government was anxious to give to the Legis-
lature the fullest power, consistent with safety, of
amending the Constitution.” Those powers and their
limitations were set out. Earl Grey pronounced himself
as unfavourable “to any hasty attempt to establish a
more elaborate Legislature than existed.” He declared
it to be absolutely essential that the salaries of the prin-
cipal Government officials should be granted permanently
and provided for by Acts in the same manner as charges
on the Consolidated Fund in the United Kingdom, and
therefore only susceptible of alteration by Acts of the
Legislature. Half the revenue derived from the sale of
New South Wales lands was spent, he stated, on emigra-
tion and therefore directly benefited the colony.
Naturally little satisfaction was felt at the reply of
the Imperial Government. No comfort was taken from
the fact of half the proceeds of land sales being spent
on immigration. The colonists had good grounds for
knowing that whatever benefit such an outlay might
otherwise have brought to them, it had been utterly
nullified by the Imperial authorities having fixed so high
an upset price on Crown lands. Assistance might be
offered to immigrants, but that assistance would fail to
attract them to the remote shores of Australia, when
land could be obtained so much more cheaply in the
longer-settled regions of America and elsewhere. It
rankled in the mind of the inhabitants of New South
Wales to think that the Imperial Government was per-
petuating, in their case, the very errors of misrule which
had led to the War of Independence and the loss of the
American colonies.
In the following year the Legislative Council again
formally protested at the method under which the colony
was being governed. A Select Committee was appointed,
and it drafted a “Declaration and Remonstrance,” in
which the viewpoint of the inhabitants of New South
Wales was expressed in strong terms. The document
sets out the causes of grievance as follows:
We, the Legislative Council of New South Wales,
do accordingly hereby solemnly protest, and declare as
follows;
Ist. That the Imperial Parliament has not, nor of
right ought to have, any power to tax the people
of this colony, or to appropriate any of the
monies by authority of the Imperial Legislature;
that this power can only be lawfully exercised
by the colonial Legislature; and that the
Imperial Parliament has solemnly proclaimed
this power by 18 Geo. 111., cap. 12, sec. 1., which
Act remains unrepealed.


2nd. That the revenue arising from the public
lands, derived as it is mainly from the value
imparted to them by the labour and capital of
the people of this colony, is as much their pro-
perty as the ordinary revenue, and ought there-
fore to be subject only to the like control and
appropriation.
3rd. That the Customs and all other departments
should be subject to the direct supervision and
control of the colonial Legislature, which should
have the appropriation of the gross revenues of
the colony, from whatever source arising; and
as a necessary incident to this authority the
regulation of the salaries of all colonial officers.
4th. That offices of trust and emolument should be
conferred only on the settled inhabitants, the
office of Governor alone excepted; that this
officer should be appointed and paid by the
Crown; and that the whole patronage of the
colony should be vested in him and the Execu-
tive Council, unfettered by instructions from
the Minister of the Colonies.
sth. That plenary powers of legislation should be
conferred upon and exercised by the colonial
Legislature for the time being; and that no
Bills should be reserved for the signification of
Her Majesty’s pleasure unless they affect the
prerogatives of the Crown or the general
interests of the Empire.
Solemnly protesting against these wrongs, and
declaring and insisting upon these our undoubted
rights, we leave the redress of the one and the
assertion of the other to the people whom we represent
and the Legislature which shall follow us. [The Council
being about to dissolve by effluxion of time.]
The report and recommendations of the Select Com-
mittee, including the above extract, were carried in the
Council by 18 votes to 8.
The new Legislative Council was determined not to
let the matter of constitutional reform sink into oblivion.
Indeed, feeling through the colony was such that the
matter would not have been permitted to rest, even
though the Council itself had been hostile to reform. A
Select Committee on Grievances was appointed, and it
drew up two draft petitions to the Queen and to both
Houses of the Imperial Parliament. The committee’s
report, together with the petitions, were adopted by
21 votes to 8. The petitions included that drawn up by
the previous Council. It also went on to say:
That these grievances having formed the subject
of repeated representations and complaints from the
former Legislative Council, all of which have met with
neglect or disregard from your Majesty’s Colonial
Minister, we owe it to ourselves and to our constituents
to denounce to your Majesty, as the chief grievance
of which the people of this colony are subjected, the
systematic and mischievous interference which is exer-
cised by that Minister even in matters of purely local
concernment.
That while we are most anxious to strengthen and
perpetuate the connection which still happily exists
with our fatherland, we feel it a solemn duty to your
Majesty and our fellow-countrymen in the United
Kingdom to declare that it will be impossible much
longer to maintain the authority of a local Executive
which is obliged by its Instructions to refer all measures
of importance, no matter how great the urgency for
their immediate adoption, for the decision of an
inexperienced, remote, and irresponsible department.
The petition went on to urge that the colony be
granted a Constitution constructed on similar lines to
that of Canada.
A despatch was received in reply from Sir John
Pakington, who had succeeded Earl Grey as Secretary
of State. The document was favourable in tone towards
the wishes of the colonists. It set out:
In compliance with the opinion expressed by the
Council in favour of a Constitution similar in outline
to that of Canada, it was the wish of Her Majesty’s
Government that the Council should establish the new
Legislature on the bases of an elective Assembly and
a Legislative Council nominated by the Crown.
A Select Committee was appointed for this purpose,
and on September 17, 1852, it presented its report, which
provided for a Parliament consisting of two Chambers.
Considerable difficulty had been experienced in drawing
up a scheme for the formation of a Legislative Council
which would properly discharge the functions of a House
of Review and would provide what was in those days
regarded as a sufficient check on the democratic tenden-
cies finding their vent in the Legislative Assembly. The
members of the Committee were by no means unanimous
in their findings as to the Council. Some of them con-
sidered that the nomination of the Council should be
left wholly to the Executive, with an understanding that
not more than one-third of the former was to hold posi-
tions of emolument. Others preferred an elective body,
on the lines subsequently adopted in Victoria and in
Tasmania, with a high property qualification. Still
others favoured the Second Chamber being elected with-
out restriction. A section of the Committee favoured
the Governor having the nomination for life of two-thirds
of the Legislative Council out of persons who had been
elected members of the past or present Council, or who
might be elected to any future Assembly, the other third
holding office during pleasure. The recommendations
were embodied in two Bills, which, however, were
ultimately discharged from the notice paper.
A year later another Select Committee was ap-
pointed, with Mr. Wentworth as chairman, to prepare
a Constitution for the colony. This body suggested cer-
tain alterations in the scheme recommended by the
Committee of the previous session as regards the con-
stitution of the Legislative Council. It considered that
the House was pledged to one on similar lines to that of
Canada. It desired to have a form of government
analagous to that of Great Britain. It had no wish to
sow the seeds of a future democracy, and until it was
satisfied that the nominated or the future elective
Council, which it recommended, would have the
object it had in view, of placing a safe, revising,
deliberative, and conservative element between the


Lower House and Her Majesty’s representative in the
colony, it did not feel inclined to hazard the experiment
of an Upper House based on a general elective franchise.
Actuated by these views, it had introduced into the Con-
stitution Bill two clauses analagous to those in the
Imperial Act for making more effective provision for the
Government of Quebec. That Act authorized the Crown,
when it thought proper, to confer any hereditary title
of honour, rank, or dignity, and to annex thereto an
hereditary right of being summoned to the Legislative
Council. It was not prepared to recommend the intro-
duction into New South Wales of a right by descent to
a seat in the Upper House. But it was of opinion that
the creation of hereditary titles—leaving it to the option
of the Crown to annex to the title of the first patentee
a seat for life in such House, and conferring on the
only. This was to be in addition to the franchise already
existing. The number of members in the Assembly was
not to exceed the number of the then existing Council,
whilst the 18 additional elective members, who would
be substituted for the nominees, would be distributed
among the Electoral Districts which had been consti-
tuted by the Electoral Act of 1851 when the previous
constitutional change had been brought about. An
important clause of the Bill gave to the Parliament of
the colony full power to alter the Constitution whenever
there should be a majority of two-thirds in both Houses
favourable to such change, reserving to the Queen the
right of assent.
Another important feature of the Bill was in regard
to the Civil List proposed, which was less by £24,700
than the Civil List proposed by the Select Committee of
CARTING TIMBER TO LAMINSTON MILL, BEAUDESERT DISTRICT.
original patentees and the inheritors of their titles a
power to elect a certain number of their order, to form,
in conjunction with the original patentees then living,
the Upper House of Parliament—would be a great
improvement on any form of Legislative Council
hitherto tried in any British colony.
However, in other features the Committee was less
reluctant to grant to the people some power over the
government of the affairs of the country in which they
lived. In the Bill proposed for adoption, the Committee
recommended a wide extension of the elective fianchise.
It was there proposed that members of the Legislative
Assembly should represent and be voted for by all per-
sons with a salary of £lOO per annum, and to all
occupants of any room or lodging paying £4O per annum
for board and lodging, or £lO per annum for lodging
the previous session. The Civil List had already proved
a matter for serious dissension in the colony, which had
imposed on it the obligation of setting aside fixed annual
sums for payment of officials sent out to fulfil various
public functions. Clearly the community could not
claim to possess the advantages and privileges of self-
government if not permitted to spend its own money in
its own way. The Committee, of which Mr. Wentworth
was chairman, hoped to provide for no set sum being
earmarked for the payment of the officials, leaving them
to be provided for by the annual vote of Parliament.
However, the Committee retained in the Civil List a
sufficient sum for pensioning off all the higher Govern-
ment officials whose positions might be absorbed under
the form of Responsible Government proposed to be
adopted.


An interesting feature of the report of this Com-
mittee, sitting in the early fifties, was the recommend-
ation it contained for the institution of a system of
Federal Government, which, however, was not destined
to materialize until very nearly half a century later.
The Committee found “that one of the most prominent
measures required by the colony, and the Australian
colonies generally, was the establishment at once of a
General Assembly to make laws in relation to the inter-
colonial questions that had arisen or thereafter might
arise among them.” As the incorporation of such a
jurisdiction in the Constitution Act might excite jealousy
the Committee confined itself to making a suggestion
that the establishment of such a body had become indis-
pensable, and to the expression of a hope that the
Minister for the Colonies would at once see the ex-
pediency of introducing into the Imperial Parliament
a Bill for that express purpose.
The Select Committee had prepared two Bills
which were presented to the Legislature at the same time
as the report. These were “A Bill to confer a Con-
stitution on New South Wales and to grant a Civil List
to Her Majesty,” and the draft of a Bill which it was
proposed should be passed through the Imperial Parlia-
ment, authorizing the Queen to assent to the Constitution
Bill.
The political creed which obtained most play in
those days was often widely separated from the convic-
tions of the bulk of the people. Widespread protest
found expression in all populated parts of what then
was New South Wales at what was regarded as far too
conservative a scheme of government. The free, open
life of the new country had led men to hope for a
breaking down of many of the class differences which
they hoped to have left behind them in the land of their
birth. Where men are to spend a few years contending
against the primitive difficulties of Nature, the
tendency is towards the destruction of artificial social
barriers. Except within the immediate neighbourhood
of the convict settlements, where necessarily officialdom
reigned supreme, such certainly has been the experience
in Australia. But officialdom was strongly entrenched
within the single-chamber Legislature prevailing at the
date we are considering. It was a form of officialdom
drawn with few bonds of sympathy or recognized mutual
interest with the body of the people. In Victoria it had
produced bloodshed at Eureka, and in New South Wales
much discontent had been hidden through finding no
constitutional channel of expression. But the people
were, nevertheless, determined that when the colony
adopted a Constitution they would, if need be, contend
hard to secure what they regarded as adequate and
efficacious popular representation.
A few days after the Select Committee’s report, when
the accompanying Bills had been published through being
presented to Parliament, a public meeting was held in
Sydney, and as a result a “Constitution Committee” was
formed. The latter body quickly organized a much
larger meeting, which was held on August 15. Resolu-
tions were enthusiastically carried protesting against
what was regarded as the creation of a colonial aristocracy
and what was looked on as the undue rural representation
proposed by the Select Committee. The next day Mr.
John Bayley Darvall, a barrister who represented the
County of Cumberland, presented to the Legislative
Council a petition of protest which had emanated from
the meeting and was signed by 2,630 persons. Other
meetings were held in the various centres of population
throughout the colony, and like resolutions were arrived
at. The popular feeling of the time was representatively
expressed at a meeting held in Sydney whilst the Bill
was passing through the Legislative Council. This
gathering decided the best method of Parliamentary
Government to be by two Houses, both based on popular
suffrage, the Upper House to consist of one-third as many
members as the Lower House, and to be elected for a
longer period and to retire at different intervals of time.
These opinions were sent to the Queen in the form of a
petition. The Constitution propounded was somewhat
similar to that now in operation in Tasmania, excepting
that in the island State the Upper House is elected on
a property qualification.
The “Constitution Committee” in November com-
pleted a somewhat different scheme. It asked (1) that
there be two Houses of Parliament, (2) that both be
popularly elected, (3) that the Lower House consist of
not more than 54 members who should come up for re-
election at least every three years, (4) that the Upper
House consist of not less than 18 members elected by not
more than six electorates and to hold their seats for nine
years, and (5) that no Civil List be established by the
Constitution Act.
The voice of the people, as represented in the
various protests which had been made, was destined not
to sway the Legislative Council. The Bill was introduced
in charge of Mr. Wentworth, and it passed through all
its stages without material alteration. The measure pro-
vided for a Legislative Council consisting of not less than
21 members holding their seats for five years from the
date of the summons to the Council, but all members
who were summoned after the expiration of the first five
years to be entitled to hold their seats for life. The
Assembly was to consist of 54 members, who were to
retain their seats for not longer than five years without
re-election.
The following resolutions, which were adopted by
the Legislative Council without division on the passage
of the Constitution Bill, serve better than anything else
could, to display the mind of the Legislature regarding
the formidable task which it had just done so much


to solve in the manner most in accordance with
its ideals:
1. That in the opinion of this House a “Bill to
Confer a Constitution on New South Wales and to
Grant a Civil List to Her Majesty,” which has just
passed this House, is an embodiment of all the rights
for which this House and preceding Legislative Coun-
cils have for years past been contending, and will,
when passed into law, redress all the grievances
enumerated in the petition to Her Majesty and both
Houses of Parliament adopted on December 5, 1851.
2. It gives plenary powers of legislation in all
matters of local and municipal concernment.
3. It prevents, except in certain enumerated cases
relating solely to the prerogative of the Crown and
Imperial interests, the double power of veto, which
has hitherto been the source of much uncertainty and
dissatisfaction.
4. It greatly enlarges the basis of popular repre-
sentation.
5. It establishes among us, for the first time, an
independent judiciary.
6. It abolishes the schedules annexed to the
Imperial Act now in force, and involves the necessary
implication that the Imperial Parliament has no right
to tax the inhabitants of this colony or to appropriate
any portion of its revenues.
7. It surrenders to the control of the Legislature
the waste lands of the Crown, subject to the main-
tenance of the vested rights and other interests that
have grown up under existing laws; and
8. To the like control and appropriation the entire
consolidated revenues of the colony, from whatever
source arising, except that portion which is voluntarily
granted to Her Majesty by way of Civil List.
9. And as a necessary consequence it establishes
Responsible Government, properly so called, and
places in the hands of responsible Ministers the
appointment of all offices of trust and emolument
within the colony, thus giving to the inhabitants
thereof, as nearly as circumstances will admit, the
same rights and privileges which belong to their
fellow-subjects in the United Kingdom.
10. In framing this Bill it has been the anxious
desire of this House that the Legislative Council and
House of Assembly should form as close an approxima-
tion as possible to the constitution of both Houses of
the Imperial Parliament, and the whole scope of this
measure is to give stability to those British institutions
which we have, to introduce those which we have not,
to cement that union which now happily exists between
this colony and the parent country, and to per-
petuate, if possible, that identity of laws, habits, and
interests which it is so desirable to render enduring.
11. Such being the intention of this Bill, and the
power of framing it having been delegated to this
House, under an admission that it was more competent
than Parliament itself to devise a suitable Constitution
for this colony, this House desires to record its earnest
hope that His Excellency the Governor-General will
lose no time in forwarding to the Minister for the
Colonies this Bill for the signification of Her Majesty’s
pleasure thereon; and that His Excellency will be
pleased to accompany it with such explanations as
he may deem necessary, to show the large majorities
of both the nominated and elective members by which
it has been supported in all its stages, and ultimately
passed.
12. That the draft Act of Parliament brought up
by the Select Committee to authorize Her Majesty to
assent to the Bill, of which a copy is hereto appended,
be transmitted to the Governor-General, with a request
that His Excellency will be pleased to forward it to
His Grace the Secretary of State for the Colonies, as
being a fit enactment to give the required validity to
this Bill.
The House then resolved, on the motion of Mr.
James Macarthur, that the Hon. Edward Deas-Thomson,
the Colonial Secretary (or Premier) of that time, and
Mr. William Charles Wentworth, who were both about
to visit England, should be “requested and empowered”
to give the Constitution Bill their advocacy and to
combat any objections likely to be taken to the passing
of the legislation through the Imperial Parliament to
give it validity. The two emissaries left Sydney on their
mission early in 1854.
The Legislative Council having adopted the recom-
mendations of the Select Committee, and having passed
the Bills which that body had recommended, did not in
any way serve to allay the public hostility to the kind
of Constitution proposed to be conferred upon the colony.
Feeling still ran high among the majority of the people
at what was regarded as the inadequacy of the repre-
sentation given to those who formed the larger portion
of the community. This unrest gradually began to find
expression in Parliament itself. Although the list of
resolutions already quoted had been carried without
division a totally contrary set of motions was next year
brought forwmrd in the Legislature and was supported
by a substantial minority of members. The author of
these was Mr. Darvall, who already had identified him-
self with the more democratic tendencies of the times.
They were as follows:
1. That the New South Wales Constitution Act,
sent home for the consideration of the British Parlia-
ment, was passed by this Council in opposition to the
wishes of a large majority of the colonists, who desire,
as a basis of their future local government, a Repre-
sentative Legislature, and a just distribution of the
elective franchise.
2. That if this Act shall unhappily become law,
the Government of the colony will fail to obtain that
confidence of the people without which it cannot be
either useful or powerful, and the future welfare and
peace of the colony will be disturbed by the introduc-
tion of those changes which can now be effected without
difficulty or confusion.
3. That it is the manifest desire of Her Majesty’s
advisers, and of the Imperial Parliament, to confer
upon the colonists a form of local government in
accordance with their wants and wishes; and as this
Council, as now constituted, does not represent the
opinions of the people of New South Wales, and is
constructed on principles fundamentally opposed to
the British Constitution, it is expedient and just that
the constitution of the local Government should be
determined by the wisdom of Parliament, and not by
the now existing local Legislature.
4. That the foregoing resolutions be embodied in
an address to the Governor-General, with a request
that His Excellency will be pleased to communicate
them to the Right Honourable the Secretary of State
for the Colonies for the information of Her Majesty.


A considerable debate followed the moving of these
resolutions. There was, however, but little chance of
them being carried. The Legislature represented
officialdom and the wealthy classes in an overwhelming
preponderance. When the House went to a vote, the
question was decided in the negative by 24 to 10.
Meanwhile Mr. Wentworth and the Hon. Edward
Deas-Thompson had reached England on their mission.
On July 3 the latter sent out a despatch to the Speaker
of the Legislative Council. He informed the House
that the Constitution Bill had been amended by the
Colonial Office and had passed the House of Commons.
The House of Lords was expected to agree to it without
further alteration. But the amendments which had been
made were important. He stated that the Colonial Office
had introduced a power of destroying majorities, and
that legislating by bare majorities of the members pre-
sent in all cases (excepting only the squatting question)
had been introduced. He declared that the only securi-
ties the measure contained against the destructive
innovations which had been made lay in the fact that
the vested rights of the Crown tenants were upheld and
the nominated Upper House was permitted. The com-
munication was read to members of the Legislative
Council on October 2. On the last day of the same
month that body received official notification that the
legislation had passed both Houses of the Imperial Parlia-
ment and that it had received the Royal assent. The
information was conveyed by the Governor-General in a
message accompanied by an Act of Parliament “by
which Her Majesty had been enabled to assent to a Bill
(as amended) of the Legislature of New South Wales to
confer a Constitution on New South Wales. Together with
these a despatch was received from Lord John Russell,
who was then Secretary of State for the Colonies. The
latter statesman pointed out that the local Legislative
Council had exceeded its powers by passing the Bill.
“However," he continued, “it was more expedient to
preserve in form, as well as in substance, the measures
which had been fully considered and finally enacted by
that Legislature than to substitute direct Parliamentary
legislation. Clauses of a purely local nature were there-
fore unaltered. But those portions of the provincial
enactment which controlled and regulated the future
power of the Crown as to the reservation and disallow-
ance of the Colonial Acts, and as to the instructions to
be given to the Governors respecting them, had been
omitted by the Imperial Parliament."
An interesting feature of Lord John Russell’s
despatch was contained in that portion dealing with the
proposal New South Wales had made regarding the
establishment of a federal union of the Australian
colonies. The Legislative Council was assured that the
matter had received the fullest consideration by the
Imperial Government, which, however, had concluded
that the time was not opportune for taking such a step.
The Colonial Legislature was informed attention would
be bestowed upon any further propositions regarding the
same subject received from any of the Australian
Legislatures.
A month later the Council was notified that Her
Majesty’s assent had been granted to the Constitution
Act. Thus was established the Constitution of the
colony of which Queensland then formed a part. It was
the Parliament constructed on the lines laid down by this
legislation which resolved upon the separation of what
hitherto had been known as the Moreton Bay District
some four years later.
CHAPTER VIII.
EARLY LAND TENURE.
As the first settlement in Queensland took place
while the northern colony still formed part of New
South Wales, and while both were subject to the same
laws and government, a proper understanding of the
conditions of tenure and the history of pastoral and
agricultural settlement of what was first known as the
Moreton Bay district must be based on some acquaint-
ance with the first occupation by stock-breeders and
others of the parent State.
Sydney was the centre from which all the earliest
excursions in search of new territory set out, and the
Parliament in Sydney to which the settlers in the
Moreton Bay district, including the Darling Downs, held
whatever right they possessed to country being used by
them for stock-raising or other purposes. When a
separate State was constituted in 1859 the new-born
Queensland Parliament took over a set of conditions
moulded by the Legislature of the neighbouring colony.
In the space of half a century the attitude of the
Australian people has completely changed regarding the
land question. This has been due to two causes.
Economic thought has altered. Till fifty years ago, and
later, freehold was regarded as the one sure foundation
upon which to build an enduring agricultural and
pastoral settlement. All the older economists had
preached the virtues of freehold and the evils of lease-
hold ; whilst no one had sufficiently differentiated between
the merits of leasehold from a private owner and


leasehold from the Crown on a wisely-devised plan of
fixity of tenure and proper compensation for improve-
ments in the event of change of tenants. The early
colonial legislators were always ready to part eagerly
with the public lands, because they considered that the
increase in the area of alienated freehold and the
increase in industry and production were synonymous
terms. One of the keenest disputes with the Imperial
authorities was caused by the latter insisting on an upset
price of <£l per acre being charged for the fee-simple
of all areas in what was then New South Wales, and
by the inhabitants considering that settlement and
industry were unduly retarded by so high a figure being
demanded. The other cause for the complete change
of conviction regarding the land problem has been due
to the force of circumstances. The problem of settling
the continent seemed so tremendous to the small com-
munity with homes on the eastern side, in the forties
and fifties, that no one then foresaw the possibility of
who pushed out into the unknown with a flock or herd
with which he intended to found a station, though
naturally he was admired as being of the type doing
most to build up the future prosperity and well-being of
the colony. In some instances grants of land were
made, and in 1831, as already mentioned in these
pages, the Sydney Gazette contained a notice
that in future Crown Lands would be disposed of
by auction sale only, and at a minimum price of ss. per
acre. But no considerable progress was made with the
disposal of the land. The great bulk of the country
would find no purchasers because the extent was so vast
and settlers so few. Indeed, the interior of the colony
was officially referred to as “Waste Lands,” and its
unauthorized occupation was recognized. It waS, of
course, impossible for the settlers indefinitely to continue
taking what land they required without reference to any
authority. Although most of the country was still
unexplored, unrestrained and unregulated occupation
MERINO SHEEP ON THE DARLING DOWNS.
half-a-century bringing a condition in which the farming
industry, and the more productive forms of settlement
generally, might be retarded by all the best land having
gravitated into the hands of a few, and the natural
demand caused by refrigeration and other improved
means of transporting products having increased land
values beyond the wildest dreams of early speculators.
While the problem perplexing the Australian Parlia-
ments now often is to find the right sort of land to
meet the needs of the settlers who desire to follow a
particular occupation, thus causing the creation of
Closer Settlement Acts, the question confronting the
early Legislature of the parent State was to find settlers
who would take even the best of the land.
The earliest pastoral enterprise of Australia was
largely carried on without legal right to the land used.
But a few thousands of people were settled upon a
continent approximating three million square miles in
area, and no envious eyes were cast upon the pioneer
must necessarily breed discord in those localities where
industry could be most practically carried on. Certain
legislation protecting Crown lands from “encroachment,
intrusion, and trespass” had been passed in 1832. In
1836 Governor Bourke had found it necessary to present
a Bill to the Legislative Council of New South Wales
aiming at the restraint of the unauthorized occupation
of Crown lands. The Governor informed the House
that the Bill had been prepared at the special request
of a number of respectable colonists, who had claimed
that a number of offences were being committed as a
result of the absence of regulation of use of “Waste
Lands.” The measure proposed that within certain
limits “Waste Lands” would be accessible under regula-
tions already in force for those areas. Permission to
occupy land outside those limits might be obtained from
the Government in the form of licences, which would
be renewable annually, and would be granted to persons
of “good repute” to depasture sheep and stock. These


licences would protect the holders against proceedings
being taken against them under the proposed Act. The
measure, which thus prohibited the occupation of any
lands without some sort of legal authority, was passed
a month later.
Three years later, further legislation dealing with
the same matter was passed by the Legislative Council.
This was a measure laid on the table by Sir George
Gipps, who was then Governor. It made provision for
the establishment of a certain police force to operate
outside what was called “the limits of location”—that
is, in those wide areas in which the licences applied.
The police were to be paid for by means of an annual
assessment on stock depastured beyond the “limits of
location.” The assessment was at the rate of |d. per
head on sheep, Hd. per head on cattle, and 3d. per
head on horses. A commissioner, armed with power for
keeping peace, was to be appointed for the districts
beyond the “limits of location.”
Some years later this Act was discontinued, the
grounds being that the Governor had frequently
represented that Her Majesty was the sole owner of the
“Waste Lands,” and therefore interference by the
Council was unnecessary; that, so long as that owner-
ship existed, the Council was not justified in imposing
a peculiar tax on squatters in particular ; that the
powers conferred on the commissioners were arbitrary
and unconstitutional; that the Act had been passed on
the understanding that the licence fee should not be
increased, which compact had not been kept, and that
new regulations had been made by the Crown regarding
waste lands, in spite of the remonstrance of the Council.
Meanwhile great discontent had been generated
throughout the colony at the interference of the
Imperial authorities in raising the minimum price at
which Crown lands might be purchased. Originally the
upset price had been ss. per acre, whilst the minimum
rental of leased land was fixed at 20s. per area lot.
The former figure had been increased, first to 12s. and
then to 20s. This raised objection in two ways.
Colonists who would have liked to become proprietors
of freehold found themselves restricted to such an
extent that as much money was now required to buy one
acre as previously would have purchased four. The
resentment was increased by the knowledge that the
step had been taken by a Department at the other side
of the globe, and at the order of people who had never
seen the continent. People who had no wish to become
settlers or landholders also entertained resentment.
They had good reason to know that the restriction had
decreased the sales. The quantity of land to be dis-
posed of annually had materially declined since the
minimum price had been raised. All classes of the
community were anxious to see settlement extend on a
permanent basis as rapidly as possible. In September,
1846, the opinion of the country was reflected in
Parliament, when Mr. Robert Lowe moved, among other
resolutions, “That the raising of the upset price of
land, first to 12s. and then to LI per acre, has rendered
waste land unsaleable.” This motion was carried. Ihe
House also resolved, “That while this price is main-
tained the squatting question can never be settled on a
just and satisfactory basis,” and “That the minimum
upset price of land ought to be reduced to a sum not
exceeding its value.”
To the disappointment of the colonists, these pro-
tests produced no effect on the Imperial Government.
In June of the same year a despatch was received from
Earl Grey enclosing a copy of certain regulations which
it was contemplated to establish in pursuance of an
“Act to amend an Act for regulating the Sale of Waste
Land belonging to the Australian Colonies, and to make
further Provision for the Management thereof.' This
measure had recently been passed by the Imperial Par-
liament. The Act imposed penalties for the
unauthorized occupation of waste lands. During the
following month a Select Committee was appointed, on
the motion of Mr. John Fitzgerald Leslie Foster, a
member for Port Phillip, to inquire into what ought to
be the minimum upset price of land in New South Wales.
Only a few days later a despatch came to hand
from the Secretary of State on the subject of the pro-
posed Orders. In this document Earl Grey stated that,
before proceeding further with the contemplated
measure, he had considered it important to obtain the
opinion of the late Governor of New South Wales, and
that before his recent death Sir George Gipps had given
him advice and assistance in the revision of the proposed
regulations.
The Orders-in-Council annexed to this despatch
divided the colony into three districts —the settled, the
intermediate, and the unsettled. Leases for runs of
land within the unsettled districts were to be granted
for not more than fourteen years, the rent being pro-
portioned to the number of sheep, or equivalent number
of cattle, which the run should be capable of carrying.
Each run should be capable of carrying at least 4,000
sheep, or an equivalent number of cattle ; and it should
not in any case be let at a low r er rent than <£lo per
annum, to which £2 10s. should be added for every
additional 1,000 sheep, or equivalent number of cattle,
which the run was able to carry. The Commissioner of
Crown Lands was to name one valuer, the occupier
another, and the two together were to appoint a referee.
The rents of runs were not to interfere with any existing
assessments on sheep or cattle, nor with the right of the
Colonial Legislature to impose from time to time such
assessments as might be deemed advisable. The rules
applicable to intermediate lands were to be the same
as those for unsettled lands, except that the leases were


to be limited to eight years, and that it should be
competent for the Governor, after sixty days’ notice, to
offer for sale all or part of the lands of such runs.
Leases of the settled lands, exclusively for pastoral
purposes, were to be granted for terms not exceeding
one year; and it was to be competent for the Governor
to make general rules under which holders of purchased
lands in the settled districts should be permitted to run
stock on any adjacent Crown lands.
The local Legislature, as soon as receiving this
despatch, referred it for report to the Committee of
which Mr. Foster had secured the appointment.
The Committee just referred to, of which Mr. Lowe
was chairman, presented a lengthy and detailed report
on September 27. It declared it seemed, from the
evidence of all the witnesses, that the sum of £1 per acre
did not represent in any degree the exchangeable value
of land in New South Wales. The declaration of Par-
liament, therefore, that land should not be sold till
quality could be obtained in New South Wales a-t ss.
The present and actual interests of the latter had there-
fore been sacrificed to the present and visionary
prospects of the younger settlement. But the ruin of
the land fund of the colony, the dispersion of her
people, and the stoppage of immigration had not been
the only results of this minimum price being fixed. The
most serious consequence lay in the Act of the Imperial
Parliament and the Land Orders issued thereunder,
which had been referred to the Committee by a vote of
the Council. The Imperial Government, it was pointed
out, could prohibit land being sold at less than £1 per
acre, but could not make the land worth that sum, nor
declare, because it w 7 as unsold, that it should be unoccu-
pied, nor prevent those who occupied it from drawing
the inferences which their position naturally suggested.
The Committee pointed out that the squatters, forced to
occupy and prevented from buying, virtually obtained
without purchase all the advantages which purchase
WHEAT IN STOCK, STATE FARM, ROMA, WESTERN QUEENSLAND.
it realized £1 per acre amounted to a declaration that
it should not be sold at all, except under abnormal
circumstances. As a result of the increase in price, the
sum realized from the sale of land in 1846 was less than
one-fourth the amount derived from the same source in
1837. During the five years immediately succeeding
the raising of the minimum price to £1 the total sales
had brought in but two-thirds of the amount derived
from land sales in the year 1837. This was in spite of
the fact that the population of the colony had increased
from 85,000 in 1837 to 196,000 in 1845. It could be
proved, said the Committee, by unquestionable evidence
that it was not with a view to the welfare of New South
Wales, but of South Australia, that the prohibitory
price had been imposed. Colonel Torrens and his
brother Commissioners (the founders of the South
Australian Colony) felt it would be impossible to
obtain £1 for land there while land of the same
h 2
could give them. The law which rendered these lands
unsaleable practically made them a present to the
occupants. Consequently there had arisen in the colony
a party which held a vested interest in maintaining the
prohibitory price, which stood as a guarantee that their
occupation would never be disturbed.
Dealing with the Orders in detail, the Committee
commented that if the minimum upset price were to be
maintained the lands would be substantially divided by
the Orders into two classes—the confiscated and the
unconfiscated; the former being equivalent to the inter-
mediate and unsettled and the latter to the settled
districts. If land were to remain in the possession of
its present occupant till sold at £\ an acre it mattered
little whether his lease were held for eight or fourteen
years, as it was his for ever, not because his title was
good, but because no one would be able to take
advantage of its defects. The Committee expressed


surprise that in the local division of the colony so narrow
a space should be allotted to the settled and interme-
diate districts respectively, and that these divisions
should have been formed with so singular a disregard to
the local peculiarities of the colony. The Committee
also objected to a prohibition to cultivate which was
contained in a section of the Orders. The prohibition
had been inspired by a desire to compel the purchase of
land by granting a monopoly in agriculture to holders
of freehold. But as land could never be sold to any
extent at the then established minimum price the rule
amounted to an absolute prohibition of cultivation
altogether. Out of a territory of 300,000,000 acres, not
25.000 acres had been sold in the previous four years,
and if the 300,000,000 acres were to remain desolate
until bought at this rate, it would require 48,000 years
for the completion of such an operation. The Orders
proposed that each run was to be capable of carrying
4.000 sheep. This would mean that a number of the
humbler squatters would be dispossessed in order to
make room for their more wealthy neighbours. In other
ways the squatter was made absolutely dependent upon
the will of the Crown. The provision for granting
leases for purely pastoral purposes would ruin many
industrious people, who, though quite unable to pur-
chase land at £1 per acre, had cultivated waste lands
to the great advantage of the surrounding distinct. The
Committee quite disagreed with Earl Grey’s contention
that a high-priced land and the squatting system might
mutually support one another. In no case, it con-
tended, could a system of sale, and of occupation
without sale, support one another. Sale was antagonis-
tic to temporary occupation, which in turn was con-
versely antagonistic to sale. If sales were brisk
temporary occupation was destroyed, whilst if temporary
occupation were prevalent it destroyed sale.
A reply was received from Earl Grey to the Select
Committee’s report on September 22, 1848. The argu-
ments he used in opposition to the agitation for the
speedy alienation of land at a cheap price were very
much the same as would be advanced to-day in the light
of subsequent experience. He saw, in his mind’s eye,
the aggregation of great areas in the hands of single
individuals. His despatch stated that the opinion of
the Committee seemed to rest on the assumption that
there ought to be an almost unlimited facility for the
acquisition of the public lands; they appeared to con-
sider it a fault if the sales of such lands as belonged to
the Crown should intermit. That system, however, had
until a recent date been applied to the settlement of
all the British colonies, and everywhere had been
attended with universal failure. In British North
America large areas had fallen into the hands of single
individuals to the detriment of the colony. The same
policy had ruined settlement in Western Australia.
Since a fair price had been demanded for land in New
South Wales upwards of a million sterling had been
collected from sales, and the money had been ajrplied
to obtaining a supply of labour, which was still deficient.
However, immigration had increased the population by
nearly 63,000 persons, whose passage had been aided
from the Land Fund, besides 18,000 persons who had
paid their own way after assisted immigration had been
established. This increase in population had advanced
the colony in wealth and prosperity, and had enabled its
change from a convict to a free colony. Long before Sir
George Gipps had declared that if they were to be
guided by colonial advice in fixing the price at which
lands could be sold for pastoral purposes, the smallest
coin would be too large a sum for an acre. This opinion
was born out by other observers. Considering the
importance of the subject, Earl Grey had called together
the Colonial Land and Emigration Commissioners, and
they had entirely concurred with his views.
A Select Committee on Crown Lands had been
appointed on June 12, with Mr. Lowe as chairman.
It submitted a lengthy report on October 3, reiterat-
ing the objections against the high price of land, and
affirming that this great instrument of colonization
would be forestalled and pre-occupied until its price was
reduced to ss. per acre. It emphasized the anomaly
of the local Legislature, which had been entrusted with
the appropriation of the ordinary revenue for the pur-
pose of public works, not being similarly empowered to
spend the moiety of the land revenue, which was devoted
to the same purpose. Serious evils had sprung into
existence from placing that portion of the Land Fund
applied to emigration at the disposal of the Home
Government. The colony and the Home Government
had an equal interest in promoting migration, but it
was in the interest of each to make the other pay as
much as possible. In settling these conflicting interests
the colonies had gone practically unrepresented. The
colony of New South Wales had been compelled to pay
all, and she had involved herself in debt for this object.
Had the moneys been at the disposal of the Legislative
Council a system would have been formulated by which
Government, parish, emigrant, and colonist would have
contributed equally to that in which they were equally
interested. But the emigrant was there to defend him-
self, the Government had its Ministers and the parish its
guardians; so upon the colonists the whole weight of
migration fell. The quit rent of 2d. per acre on most
of the land was more than a rack rent. The Committee
made an ardent appeal for the question of the expendi-
tine of its money to be left to the local Legislature,
as being the body best qualified to spend it wisely, both
because of holding responsibility directly to the people
most inteiested, and because of possessing a degree of
local knowledge impossible of attainment by any


Department of the Imperial Government. The Legisla-
tive Council duly adopted this report and ordered it to
be forwarded to the Secretary of State.
About this time attention was being increasingly
turned to the Moreton Bay district, as Southern Queens-
land was then termed. A penal station had been
established and land settlement was proceeding with a
fair degree of rapidity. The increasing population of
what since became New South Wales, as separated from
the northern colony, proved sufficiently powerful to
push a convict settlement to Moreton Bay. On
July 14, 1850, a despatch was laid on the table of
the Legislative Council informing the House that inde-
pendently of such immigrants as it might receive as a
result of the expenditure of colonial funds, Moreton Bay
would be entitled, on account of the number of ticket-of-
leave men sent there, to at least two ships sent to it
with free immigrants, carried at the expense of the
United Kingdom, and that the ships would be dis-
patched at once. Incidentally to the same subject, Mr.
Darvall, about the same time, moved the following
series of resolutions, and they were passed without
division :
(1) "That since the year 1836 the Land Fund,
amounting to £1,179,000, has been expended under the
direction of Her Majesty’s Government in relieving Great
Britain of a portion of her distressed population, in all
78,500 souls, comprehending 27,700 adult labourers.
(2) “That this revenue has, for the same purpose,
been charged with a debt of £IOO,OOO.
(3) “That although this expenditure has been
beneficial in some respects, it has exhausted the means
of obtaining that continuous supply of labour which
the colonists most urgently require, while unmixed
advantages have been derived from this outlay by
Great Britain, by whom no part of the expense has
been borne.
(4) “That during the whole of this period the
colonists were justly entitled to the administration of their
own Land Fund, and that if such power had not been
withheld from them they would have procured contribu-
tion towards the cost of emigration from Her Majesty’s
Government, or the over-populous parishes in England,
Ireland, and Scotland.
(5) "That it is no part of the duty of the colonists
to pay for the importation of immigrants nor to receive
criminals, and that the same principles of sound policy
which have induced Her Majesty’s Government to give
compensation by way of free labour for the introduction
of exiles entitle colonists to expect that the same amount
of Imperial funds shall be expended in the introduction
of free labour into New South Wales which has been
disbursed for this purpose out of the colonial revenue.
(6) “That these resolutions be embodied in a
humble address to the Queen, and that the Governor
be requested to transmit the same to the Right Honour-
able the Secretary of State for the Colonies.”
In August of the same year the Legislative Council
passed further resolutions of a similar character. The
second of these, which are quoted below, deals with the
old-standing dispute centralizing round the expenditure
by the Imperial Government of moneys derived from the
sale of public lands in New South Wales. The mover
was Mr. Wentworth, and three of the resolutions read
as follows:
(1) “That it is a grievance that the salary and
establishment of the Governor, so long as he continues
to be a strictly Inrperial officer, appointed by the Home
authorities and responsible only to them, are not
defrayed to the extent of half out of Imperial funds.
(2) “That in the opinion of this House the
Schedules A, B, and C appended to the Imperial Act,
5 and 6, Victoria, cap. 76, are a grievance; that they
are opposed to the Declaratory Act, 18 Geo. 111., cap.
12, sec. 1, which places the appropriation as well as the
imposition of all taxes in the several Legislatures of
the colonies; and that the tendency of these schedules,
independent to the fundamental objection to their enact-
ment by the Imperial Parliament, is to encourage a
wasteful expenditure of the public moneys and to
destroy all responsibility in the governing power to the
people’s representatives.
(3) “That in the opinion of this House the Imperial
Act, 5 and 6, Victoria, cap. 30, which places the
management of the lands of the colony and the appro-
priation of the revenues thence arising beyond the con-
trol of the House, is a grievance; that inasmuch as the
whole value of these lands has been imparted to them
by the settlement of the colonists, and by the labour
and capital which they have expended upon them, and
this value consequently belongs to the whole colony, it
follows that the entire revenues thence arising, whether
by sale or rent, ought of right to form part of our
ordinary revenue and be subject to the sole control and
appropriation of the local Legislature, and although by
the Bill now before Parliament for the better govern-
ment of the Australian Colonies it is proposed to vest
in the General or Federal Assembly to be thereby
constituted, the power to redress this grievance, this
House—seeing the uncertainty that any two of these
colonies will agree to set this General Assembly in
motion—that the process for calling it together, even
though they should so agree, is very dilatory, and that
there is little chance of any unanimity in regard to a
uniform price for the public lands of these colonies, so
diverse in climate, production, and soil, does not look to
any relief from a legislative body so unfitted to deal with
this grievance, and insists on the justice and expediency of
vesting plenary powers with reference to the public lands
of these several colonies in their several Legislatures.”


During 1851 the Council was called together to
consider measures needed for giving effect to the pro-
visions of the Imperial Act which had lately been passed
for the better government of the Australian Colonies,
and to deal with the separation of Victoria, which up
till then had been known as the Port Phillip Bay district
of New South Wales. Queensland, of course, still
formed part of the latter colony. A despatch from
Earl Grey was laid upon the table of the House. In
it he stated that land revenue was of a totally different
character from revenue raised by taxation. The prac-
tice had been to expend half the income derived from
the sale of land on emigration. This was an appropria-
tion tending directly to increase the value of the land
from which it was derived. After providing for this
and necessary expenditure on aborigines, and sundry
other charges, the land revenue ought, as far as
possible, to be spent in local improvements in the
districts from which it arose.
On April 8, 1851, the Legislature, on the motion
of Mr. Wentworth, appointed a Select Committee to
prepare a remonstrance against the new Constitution
Act which the Imperial Parliament had passed. The
report of this body has already been dealt with in the
seventh chapter of this work. It is, however, necessary
to quote here the opinions the Committee expressed
regarding the policy the Imperial Government had
adopted regarding the alienation and administration of
colonial lands. The report sets out, among matters
already dealt with: —“After the reiterated reports,
resolutions, addresses, and petitions which have pro-
ceeded from us during the whole course of our Legisla-
tive career against the Schedules appended to 5 and 6
Victoria, cap. 76, and the appropriations of our ordinary
revenue under the sole authority of Parliament; against
the administration of our waste lands, and our terri-
torial revenue thense arising ; against the withholding
of the Customs Department from our control; against
the dispensation of the patronage of the colony at the
dictation of the Minister for the Colonies; and against the
veto reserved and exercised by the said Minister, in the
name of the Crown, in matters of local legislation—
we feel that we had a right to expect that these un-
doubted grievances would have been redressed . . . ;
or that power to redress them would have been con-
ferred on the constituent bodies thereby created, with
the avowed intention of establishing an authority more
competent than Parliament itself to frame suitable
constitutions for the whole group of the Australian
Colonies. These, our reasonable expectations, have
been utterly frustrated. The Schedules, instead of
being abolished, have been increased. The powers of
altering the appropriations in these Schedules, conferred
on the Colonial Legislatures by this new Act, limited as
these powers are, have been in effect nullified by the
subsequent instructions of the Colonial Minister. The
exploded fallacies of the Wakefield theory are still clung
to; the pernicious Land Sales Act is still enforced; and
thousands of our fellow subjects (in consequence of the
undue price put by that mischievous and impolitic
enactment upon our waste lands, in defiance of the
precedents of the United States, of Canada, and the
other North American Colonies, and even of the neigh-
bouring Colony of the Cape of Good Hope) are annually
diverted from our shores, and thus forced against their
will to seek a home for themselves and their children
in the backwoods of America. Nor is this all. Our
territorial revenue, diminished as it is by this most
mistaken policy, is in a great measure confined to the
introduction among us of people unsuited to our wants,
and, in many instances, the outpourings of the poor-
houses and unions of the United Kingdom, instead of
being applied in directing to this colony a stream of
vigorous and efficient labour, calculated to elevate the
character of our industrial population.” The Com-
mittee went on to declare “that the revenue arising
from the public lands, derived as it is mainly from the
value imparted to them by the labour and capital of
the people of this colony, is as much their property as
the ordinary revenue, and ought therefore to be subject
only to the like control and appropriation.” Later in
the same year further protests were formally passed
by the Legislature.
Little satisfaction was gained by the local Legisla-
ture by its remonstrance sent to the Secretary for State,
and Earl Grey’s reply was transmitted to the House by
message from the Governor on July 13, 1852. The
Secretary of State for the Colonies denied that the
waste lands of New South Wales, or the revenue
derived from them, were in any reasonable sense the
property of the inhabitants, or that their representa-
tives ought to have, as of right, the control and disposal
of that revenue. The waste lands of the vast colonial
possessions of the British Empire were held by the
Crown as trustee for the Empire at large, and not for
the inhabitants of the particular provinces, divided by
arbitrary geographical limits in which any such waste
lands happened to be situated. Otherwise the first
inhabitants of any of these vast provinces were inde-
feasibly entitled to administer all the lands and revenues
of the great unexplored tract, called a province, of
which they occupied an extremity, wholly without
regard for the interests of the nation which had founded
the settlement, perhaps at great expense, in order to
form a home for her own emigrants and a market for
her own industry. When, and on what conditions, it
might be desirable to transfer the control of the waste
lands of a colony to its local Legislature was a question
of expediency and not of right, and he considered that
the Austtalian vaste lands were Ibr the present wisely,


as well as rightfully, vested in the general Government.
The Waste Lands Act had been adopted on the recom-
mendation of a Committee of the House of Commons,
and its object was to give permanence and more com-
plete effect to a course of policy then already adopted.
The extraordinary advance the colony bad made in
wealth and prosperity was due to the adoption of that
policy. ,
Of course, such a communication was not permitted
to go unanswered. In the following month Mr. Went-
worth moved the appointment of a Select Committee to
prepare a reply to the despatch of Earl Grey. Three
only eight nominated members against it. It was
denied that the present value of the waste lands had
been mainly given through the expenditure incurred by
Britain in founding, maintaining, and defending them.
It being obvious that whatever value was imparted to
the waste lands was derived from the labour and capital
of the colonists, it followed that such value of right
belonged to those who had created it, and that therefore
the Crown was a trustee, not for the inhabitants of the
Empire at large, but for the colonists alone. Therefore
the territorial revenue ought to be as much under the
control and appropriation of the Council as the ordinary
SPECIMENS OF CORAL FROM THE BARRIER REEF, NORTHERN QUEENSLAND.
days later the Committee brought up its report, which
was adopted in the form of resolutions by the Council
and transmitted to the Secretary of State and to the
Imperial Parliament. The reply particularly dealt with
a portion of the despatch which alleged that the remon-
strance had not proceeded from a body accurately
expressing the feelings of the community. The reply
pointed out that, of the Council of thirty-six members
concerned, twenty-four were elective and twelve nomin-
ated. Of these, seventeen elective members and one
nominated member voted for the remonstrance, and
revenue. It was not the least of the manifold Aus-
tralian grievances that the Emigration Commissioners
had placed in their hands the expenditure of territorial
revenue wholly derived from the exertions of the settlers.
It was the belief of the Committee that the Emigration
Commissioners were mainly influenced by those to
whose interest it was that the less desirable class of
people should be shipped to Australia.
In May of next year the Council received a
despatch from Sir John Pakington, who had succeeded
Earl Grey as Colonial Secretary. The change was happy


fcr the future development of the Constitutions cf the
Australian colonies. The new Minister rose to the
realization of the impotence of the Government in the
United Kingdom to manage the details of administra-
tion of the local affairs of a little-explored country on
the opposite side of the globe. It was largely to him that
New South Wales, which at that date embodied Queens-
land, owed its thanks for the greater degree of self-
governing powers which followed his elevation to office.
The despatch stated that the Home Government was
fully impressed with a sense of the importance to be
attached to the petition, not only as proceeding from the
great majority of the Legislature of the colony, but as
reiterating that statement of the causes of their discon-
tent which had been deliberately urged by their pre-
decessors. It also had been influenced by the gold
discoveries, which had imparted unforeseen features to
their political and social conditions. It had now to
deal with a state of affairs which had no parallel in
history, and which must, in all human probability,
stimulate the advance of '‘population, wealth, and
material prosperity with a rapidity alike unparalleled.
The general good order and conduct of the multitudes
attracted to the gold deposits rendered the self-govern-
ment of the people the more necessary. The present
Imperial Government, however, concurred in opinion
with their predecessors as to a portion of the grievances.
It agreed with Earl Grey that there was no just
cause for complaint as to the distribution of Crown
patronage in the colonies. It was unable to concede
the claim advanced by the colonists to the administra-
tion of the lands as one of absolute right; but it
concurred in Earl Grey’s opinion that when and on what
conditions it might be desirable to transfer the control
of the waste lands of a colony to its local Legislature
was a question of expediency and not of right. It
had, however, arrived at the conclusion that the time
was come at which it was their duty to advise Her
Majesty that the administration of these lands should
be transferred to the colonial Legislature after the con-
stitutional changes adverted to in the petition had been
effected. Without believing that the operation of the
Land Sales Act had been in truth pernicious to New
South Wales, and with a strong persuasion that much
benefit had resulted to the Australian colonies in general
from that adherence to fixed principles in the disposal
of the Land Fund which it enforced, it was of
opinion that those benefits were no longer such as to
countervail the disadvantages attending its restrictions.
This meant that in regard to the control of the
lands the colonists had attained all they had agitated
for over so long a period. But Sir John Pakington was
not destined to remain long in office. He was suc-
ceeded by the Duke of Newcastle. The new Govern-
ment, however, concurred fully in the conclusions
arrived at by those in power immediately before them.
A despatch from the Duke of Newcastle, written, of
course, when he was already in office, was received by
the local Legislature simultaneously with that written
before the change in Government had taken place, by
Sir John Pakington. The Duke of Newcastle said that
he and his colleagues cordially adopted the conclusions
arrived at by the late Government regarding the
future administration of the waste lands of the Crown.
He was informed that a Committee of the Council was
engaged in the preparation of a scheme for the amend-
ment of its Constitution. As soon as a new Constitution
had been passed, and had received Her Majesty’s assent,
the disposition of the waste lands and the appropriation
of the accruing funds would be placed without reserve
under the supervision and control of the Legislative
authority of the colony.
After the Constitution Bill had passed through all
its stages during the following December, the Council,
among other declaratory resolutions, passed the follow-
ing :
“It [the- proposed new Constitution] surrenders to
the control of the Legislature the waste lands of the
Crown, subject to the maintenance of the vested rights
and other interests that have grown up under existing
laws; and
“To the like control and appropriation the entire
consolidated revenues of the colony, from whatever
source arising, except that portion thereof which is
voluntarily granted to Her Majesty by way of Civil
List.”
The Council also declared that the “Bill to confer
a Constitution on New South Wales and to grant a
Civil List to Her Majesty was an embodiment of all the
rights for which the then existing House and preceding
Legislative Councils had for years been contending, and
would, when passed into law, redress the grievances
enumerated in the petitions to Her Majesty and to both
Houses of Parliament.”
The land question still remained of supreme import-
ance in the minds of the people of New South
Wales and of what is now Queensland. They
held no doubt about pastoral enterprise lying at the
bass of whatever progress the colony was likely to make
in industry, prosperity, or growth of population, and
they well knew that pastoral enterprise could not pro-
ceed at any fast rate when squatters were not able to
obtain land by purchase at a price which the profits of
their industry would enable them to pay, or to acquire
any security of tenure without purchase on practical
terms. Leases and cheap rentals, on long terms and
with compensation for improvements on the expiration
of the term, would have attracted many more producers
than cared to risk their labour and capital on the terms
then offering.


On November 29, 1854, a Select Committee on
Crown Lands, which had been appointed on the
motion of Mr. Charles Cowper, the member for
Cumberland, brought up a report. However, a
majority of the members decided that owing to
the great importance of the whole question, and the
much more extended inquiry which it would receive, it
was not expedient to pledge the Committee to that
report.
In January of 1857, a Constitution and control of
her waste lands having by that time been conferred on
New South Wales by the Imperial Parliament, Mr.
John Hay introduced a Bill “to regulate the Sale of the
Waste Lands of New South Wales.”
Parliament was prorogued on March 18, 1857. The
Governor’s Speech on that date made reference to the
land question. He said that until a period of sufficient
leisure to admit of careful deliberation was afforded it
had been considered necessary to postpone any general
measures relating to the administration of the waste
lands of the Crown.
The Governor’s Speech at the assembling of the
second session of 1857, which began on August 11,
dealt further with the land problem. His Excellency
announced that a Land Bill would be introduced which,
while preserving the good faith of the Crown, would
render the acquisition of land in fee-simple more easy
to all who were likely to bring it into profitable use
and thus facilitate the permanent settlement, and, at
the same time, the productiveness of the colony. On©
of the most important objects of the measure would be
to augment, without pressing upon any class of the
community, the means available for public improvement,
and more especially for those great works of internal
communication which were so much desired.
In August of the same year Mr. Stuart Alexander
Donaldson, member for Sydney Hamlets, and Treasurer,
made the first financial statement in which a responsible
Government of the colony had been called upon to
review a self-devised system of finance. He estimated
the proceeds of land sales at £210,000 and the rent of
lands at £248,000. Whilst explaining the latter item,
the Treasurer said it was the intention of the Ministry
to introduce legislation to consolidate the laws relating
to the waste lands, but he would not go into details, as
they would be fully dealt with, he said, in the Land
Bill of Mr. Hay.
The Bill referred to was duly introduced on October
22, 1857, by Mr. Cowper. The measure classified the
waste lands of the colony under four heads —town,
suburban, agricultural, and pastoral. The minimum
upset price per acre was to be: —For town lands, £8
per acre; for suburban land, £2 per acre; for agricul-
tural land, £1 per acre; and for pastoral land, ss. per
acre. The House agreed to the second reading of the
Bill by thirty-six votes to eight. However, during the
Committee stage, Mr. Robertson moved that the further
consideration of the measure be postponed for six
months, and the resolution was negatived only by the
casting vote of the Chairman. The Bill was withdrawn
in consequence.
In the following year land legislation was passed
through all stages and received the Royal assent. This
was represented in a measure to impose an assessment
on runs in the unsettled and intermediate districts, and
to increase the rent of lands leased for pastoral purposes
within the settled districts of New South Wales. The
Bill was introduced by Mr. Robertson on August 12.
In 1859 three Land Bills were introduced by Mr.
Robertson, who held office as Secretary for Land and
Works. They were entitled the Crown Land Sales Bill,
the Crown Lands Occupation Bill, and the Leased Lands
Occupation Bill. However, all three measures were
discharged from the business paper, two of them on the
motion of Mr. Robertson himself.
No further land legislation was passed prior to the
separation of the Moreton Bay district, now known as
Queensland, which took place the same year. It is,
therefore, to be noted that before Queensland became
a separate colony the parent Parliament had fought for
and obtained complete self-government, including the
administration of Crown lands, coupled with possession
of what revenues were received from leasing or selling
the areas which settlers were able to use.
CHAPTER IX.
THE BIRTH OF QUEENSLAND.
The people of New South Wales appear to have first
seriously turned their attention to the resources of
Queensland, or the Moreton Bay district, as this State
was called at that time, in 1823. It was in that year
when the wide, fertile expanses of the Darling Downs
were discovered by Allan Cunningham, the distinguished
botanist. In September of the same year the Govern-
ment cutter “Mermaid” was sent with stores to New-
castle, and with instructions to afterwards proceed
northward to Port Bowen, Port Curtis, and Moreton
Bay. On the vessel was the Surveyor-General, John
Oxley. Port Bowen and Port Curtis were te be


investigated, and all three harbours were to be reported
upon as to their suitability for use as sites for forming new
convict settlements, where men, not usefully employed
in the older stations, and incorrigible prisoners might be
sent.
Moreton Bay had, of course, been discovered by
Cook and afterwards visited by Flinders. When the
“Mermaid” dropped anchor in her wide waters a tribe
of natives rushed down to the waterside, and among
them was a man much larger and of lighter colour than
the others. To the astonishment of the ship’s crew, He
addressed them in English. Though naked and painted,
little observation was required to discover that he was a
European. Meanwhile the natives were demonstrating
affection for their alien comrade with many wild
gestures. The stranger was taken on to the ship, but
so potent had been the influences of living several years
among the natives, and so deep was his excitement at
being discovered by his countrymen—for he was an
Englishman—that little information could be obtained
from him that night.
Next morning it was ascertained that the man’s
name was Thomas Pamphlet. His tale was taken down
in writing. Pamphlet said he had set out with three
others—Richard Parsons, John Finnigan, and John
Thompson—for Illawarra. They had left Sydney in a
large open boat, the object of the voyage being to obtain
cedar. Plowever, they were overtaken by a violent
gale, which blew with hurricane violence for five days
and five nights, and drove them many miles out of their
course. The four men, who had no means of locating
their position when the storm died down, imagined they
were to the southward of Tasmania—or Van Diemen
Land, as it was then called. In consequence they
turned the boat in a due northerly direction, and for
twenty-one days they were so badly in need of water
that John Thompson died of thirst. Then the boat was
wrecked on Moreton Island; but the three survivors
still imagined themselves far to the south of Port Jack-
son. The party easily reached the mainland and set
out on foot to reach Sydney, but as they were so much
astray in their location they turned their footsteps away
from instead of towards the goal. Pamphlet became
footsore after they had advanced about fifty miles, and he
returned to the starting-point, meeting and remaining
with the tribe he had been found among. Shortly after-
wards Finnigan and Parsons fell out, and the former
had returned. At the time of the “Mermaid’s” visit,
however, he was away on a hunting expedition with the
chief of the tribe. Till then Parsons had not been
heard of again, though the following year he also was
discovered. Finnigan arrived the following day.
The greatest benefit accrued to the expedition and
to the progress of British settlement by the crew of the
“Mermaid” having found these two men. Both Cook
and Flinders had sailed away without suspecting the
existence of the Brisbane River. They both believed that
no considerable stream emptied itself into Moreton Bay.
Finnigan gave such information that Oxley, in the
whaleboat was able to steer into the mouth of the stream
and by sundown had sailed up its majestic waters for
twenty miles from the sea. The next day the expedi-
tion was continued, and Oxley realized that he had
found what, for purposes of navigation and commerce,
was one of the most useful streams on the Australian
coast. Oxley declared himself as feeling justified in
believing that the sources of the river were not to be
found in a mountainous country, but rather that it
flowed from some lake, which would prove to be
the receptacle of those interior streams crossed
by him (Oxley) during an expedition of discovery
in 1818.
Pamphlet and his companions appear to have been
treated with peculiar kindness by the Queensland blacks,
who supplied them with such housing as they themselves
possessed and with the best of the food they had. The
same attitude was adopted to the white men by all the
tribes with which they came into contact. One remark-
able feature about the natives was their ignorance of
boiling water. Whenever the white men brought water
to the boil the blacks would bolt away as fast as their
legs would carry them, and they would refuse to return
until the fluid was emptied out again. The blacks
appear to have been industrious and kindly in their
habits. Both men and women spent the days either in
collecting food or in preparing nets and other traps
with which to procure fish and meat. Fish and kan-
garoo nets were made from the bark of kurrajong trees.
During months spent among them, Pamphlet
declared that he never saw a man hit or otherwise ill-use a
woman. The men, however, fought duels which often
ended fatally.
The expedition and the discovery of the Brisbane
River was destined to be fraught with potent results
at an early day. In September, 1824, John Oxley
again set out for Moreton Bay. This time his ship was
the brig “Amity,” which carried a civil establishment,
prisoners, and stores. The intention was to plant a
settlement somewhere on the shores of Moreton Bay.
A detachment of the 40th Regiment, under the com-
mand of Lieutenant Butler, was also on board as a
guard. For a beginning the new settlement was placed
on Red Cliff Point, and the “Amity” returned to Port
Jackson, carrying with her Captain Pearson, Oxley, and
the King’s botanist (Allan Cunningham), reaching Port
Jackson on October 21. But before leaving Moreton
Bay Oxley had made a thorough examination of the
neighbourhood, and he had ascended the Brisbane River
to a point forty miles higher up than that which he had
penetrated on the occasion of his first excursion. The


Surveyor-General returned fully convinced that the
stream communicated with the interior waters. One
reason for this opinion lay in the fact that he had found
fish hitherto known only in the western watershed.
During this expedition the “Amity” picked up Parsons,
the third member of the party of wrecked white men,
of which the first had been discovered by the crew of
the “Mermaid.” On her return voyage the “Amity”
left Moreton Bay by the Southern Passage, which was
called after her. By this route fifty miles were cut off
the distance to Sydney. However, in 1847, the
“Sovereign” was wrecked there in heavy weather when
endeavouring to make this passage, and for many years
afterwards no other ship of considerable size attempted
the same straits.
On November 11 the “Amity” returned to the
infant settlement at Moreton Bay. On this occasion the
brig carried the Governor (Sir Thomas Brisbane), after
whom the river had been named, the Chief Justice, the
Surveyor-General, Captain John Macarthur, and
but she ultimately succeeded in making it plain that she
desired to be rescued and carried back to civilization.
The natives had always treated her with every kindness,
but they had always refused to permit her to communi-
cate with any passing ship. She had gained access to
the “Rattlesnake,” however, by inducing her captors to
take her on board in order that she might shake hands
with her countrymen.
The woman’s maiden name had been Barbara
Crawford. Her father had been a tinman, and was a
Scotchman living at Sydney. She had married a man
named Thompson, and together with him had resided
at Moreton Bay. However, they had left that settle-
ment in the cutter “American” for Port Errington,
where they intended to make a new home. After
having made a considerable portion of the voyage, the
ship fell in with one of the storms which rage so fiercely
on the Queensland coast, and the little vessel was cast
upon Prince of Wales Island, all the ship’s company,
except herself, being drowned. Captain Stanley liberally

Francis Stephen. After an exceedingly rough passage
the “Amity” entered Moreton Bay by the northern pas-
sage. Afterwards Sir Thomas Brisbane and the Chief
Justice proceeded twenty-eight miles up the river, and
expressed surprise at the magnificence of the stream, as
well as at the size of the trees they saw. Upon his return
the Governor insisted on the removal of the settlement
some miles up the river, and thus was laid, in 1824, the
foundations of the City of Brisbane. The Amity
arrived back at Port Jackson on December 4.
A strange tale of the bush came from Cape York
some years later, and this time it was a woman who
played the leading part. The survey ship “Rattle-
snake,” under the command of Captain Stanley, was
lying at anchor when a landing party brought off a
white woman and some of a tribe of natives, who had
come to the mainland from Prince of Wales Island.
The European had been five years with the blacks, and
she had almost forgotten the English language. For
some time she could only be understood with difficulty,
rewarded the blacks for their good treatment of the
woman, who was afterwards .able to provide useful
testimony of the habits of the natives of Torres Straits.
On March 17, 1825, the “Nancy,” dispatched to
Moreton Bay with supplies for the settlement of Bris-
bane, was compelled to return through being in a leaky
condition. In the following May the “Hercules” made
the voyage, having on board Archdeacon Thomas
Hobbes Scott. He held services in the church of St.
James on June 9.
A few months later Major Lockyer set out from
Sydney in the cutter “Mermaid” to explore the Brisbane
River to its source, in company with a pilot named
Gray. In his ultimate report he writes, among other
conclusions: —“I think it very probable that the large
swamp, into which the river at Bathurst loses itself,
occasionally overflows and is the cause of the tremendous
floods that at times take place in the Brisbane River.”
In June, 1827, Captain Logan made an interesting
excursion on foot up the Brisbane River. On July 25,


1827, he forwarded a report to the Colonial Secretary,
part of which is well worth quoting. He wrote:
“I proceeded up the Brisbane River on June 7 —as
will appear by my journal—with the view of heading
the river lately discovered (the Logan), reaching Mount
Warning, and from thence taking the most direct route
to the Tweed. However, I found it impossible, not-
withstanding every exertion, to get through the thick
scrub which covers the mountain in that direction. I
was in consequence obliged to return to the settlement
without accomplishing the object of my journey. How-
ever, I have much satisfaction in reporting that the
country through which I travelled exceeded my most
sanguine expectations, and is everywhere exceedingly
well watered, and I have no doubt, whenever it may
suit the views of Government to open it for settlers, it
will be found the most desirable district for that purpose
hitherto found in the colony. After the sailing of the
Wellington’ I will take the opportunity of proceeding
to the spot from whence I saw what I supposed to be
the Tweed, and from thence endeavour to make a direct
route. The distance did not seem to me to exceed fifty
miles.”
Portion of the journal referred to reads as fol-
lows :
“June 7. —Left the settlement at four o’clock in
the morning, proceeded up the Brisbane, and arrived at
Limestone Hills, on the left branch, at ten o’clock at
night. Distance, fifty-seven miles.
“June B.—Sent the boat back to the settlement and
proceeded overland. Directed my course S.S.W. in the
direction of Mount Dumaresq. The country very fine.
Black vegetable mould on limestone bottom. The
timber consists of eucalyptus — viz., ironbark, blue gum,
box, appletree, and a variety I have not hitherto seen.
Men being very much fatigued, halted for the night;
distance, thirteen miles. Resumed at eight o’clock next
morning. Country superior, for eight miles, to yester-
day’s. Shot two beautiful parrots —a new species not
hitherto found in the colony. Came to a large swamp
several miles in extent; skirted it for some miles and
then crossed it. Came again on the Brisbane, running
N.E. ; crossed it, and proceeded up the left bank.
Approached Mount Dumaresq towards evening. The
country now exceeded in beauty and fertility anything
I had before seen. In the bed of the river I found
specimens of coal and crystal. Distance, twenty miles.
“June 10.-—Commenced this day’s journey at half-
past eight o’clock. Crossed a beautiful plain two miles
in width and about three miles in length ; very lightly
timbered; no preparation necessary for the plough share.
At half-past nine entered a thick scrub at the foot of
Mount Dumaresq, which continues to the summit.
Found several turkeys and a remarkably large pigeon,
upwards of three pounds weight. Gained the top of
the mountain at three o’clock. Had a grand and exten-
sive prospect. The Limestone Hills bore N.N.E. I
had traversed the valley of the Brisbane for about
thirty-six miles, and it appeared about the same in
breadth. I may safely rely that there is in this beauti-
ful vale at least half a million acres, excellently watered
and fit for any purpose to which it may be applied. I
could likewise distinctly see the windings of the Logan
through an extensive and beautiful country eastward
from Mount Dumaresq, and only separated from the
valley I had quitted by moderately elevated ground.
In descending the mountain on the southern side I had
to encounter a difficult scrub, which I could not clear
before sunset. Luckily I found water in a ravine where
I stopped for the night. Distance this day, twelve miles.
"June 11. —Resumed my descent through the scrub
at eight o’clock ; after much difficulty cleared it at ten
o’clock. Found a branch of the Logan at the base,
running northward; the river here passed through a
large swampy plain well adapted to graze cattle. Saw
a large flock of emus, the first seen in the vicinity of
Moreton Bay. The course of the river making a detour
to the west, left its bank; the grass thereon being on
fire obliged me again to cross the river. Proceeded up
the left bank for some miles; the mountains towering
on every side reminded me of a Pyrenean valley. At
four o’clock killed a large kangaroo, which was very
acceptable to the men. Distance, twenty-five miles.
"June 12.—Continued my route to the south. The
river branched into several streams; we were evidently
near its source. Walked for some hours over a hilly
country, admirably adapted for grazing sheep ; came to
a creek at the foot of Mount Shadford, and shot an
emu on the bank. Ascended the mountain, which was
the most fatiguing part of the journey. It unfortunately
began to rain on my reaching the summit, accompanied
by a thick fog, which prevented me from having so
extensive a prospect as I expected. I was surrounded
by mountains on all sides, but I could not get a view of
Mount Warning. To continue my route to the south-
ward would have been very difficult, and would have
protracted the journey beyond the time; I therefore
determined to steer eastward and gain the low country.
Descended the mountain to the eastward and halted for
the night in a native encampment. Distance, fifteen
miles.
“June 13.—Continued my route eastward over a
very difficult and mountainous country. At length per-
ceived Mount Warning directly in my course; on
approaching the base found the principal branch of the
Logan. The stream was so rapid I had some difficulty
in crossing. Encamped on the right bank, and imme-
diately commenced to ascend, in hope of reaching the
summit, but could only gain a peak not more than half
way to the top. All attempts appeared to be hopeless


at the east and north sides, and it would have detained
me two days longer to have made a detour to the west-
ward, probably with as little chance of success. I
therefore returned to the encampment with the intention
of proceeding on my journey in the morning. Distance,
fourteen miles.
“June 14.—Made another attempt to ascend the
mountain on the north side ; had a very extensive view.
Recommenced my journey to the east. Proceeded for
some miles without much difficulty. Crossed another
river, which washed the S.E. side of the mountain and
united with another a few miles below. Crossed some
beautiful valleys, well watered with mountain streams.
Got into an extensive scrub, which prevented my making
way to the east. Towards evening made a detour to
north to clear the scrub, and got into open forest
country before sunset. Distance, twenty miles.
“June 15.—Started at sunrise. Proceeded east;
passed through a fine hilly country covered with a most
luxuriant mould. This part of the country is the best
I have seen either for sheep or cattle, and is most
abundantly watered, each valley possessing a beautiful
rivulet. Passed several considerable streams which unite
with the Logan. Towards evening my route eastward
was completely terminated by mountains covered with
pine scrub to the summits. Perceiving a stream run-
ning north, I determined to follow the course for a few
miles for the purpose of finding a more even way to
cross the mountains to the sea coast. Distance, twenty-
five miles.
••June 16.—-Started N.E. over a hilly country,
somewhat inferior to yesterday, but well adapted to
pasturage. Distance, fifteen miles.
“June 17. —Ascended a ridge of mountains; could
see nothing but mountains to the eastward, covered with
pine scrub. Provisions were nearly exhausted and the
men’s shoes worn out; determined to steer northward
and join the settlement. Proceeded down the banks of
a river through a rich tract of country. Saw several
kangaroos, but the dogs were so weak they could not run
them down. Fortunately, before sunset killed one;
stopped for the night. Distance, twenty miles.
“June 18. —Continued my route. Passed through
a rich valley. Towards midday left valley on my right.
My route now lay over some rocky ridges; the worst
country I have passed through. The men greatly
fatigued. Distance, sixteen miles.
“June 19. —Continued north the first part of the
day. Country was very good; much improved in
appearance to that traversed yesterday. Towards noon
it became swampy. At two o’clock we arrived at the
Logan ; not fordable. Stopped for the night. Distance,
twenty miles.
“June 20.—Made several unsuccessful attempts to
cross the river; moved up the bank about eight miles.
“June 21. — Proceeded up the river about two miles.
Crossed at a ledge of rocks. Steered north for the
settlement. Timbered with finest oak; considerable
number of swamps. Distance, twenty-two miles.
“June 22, —Recommenced my route for Brisbane
town, for a few miles through a swampy country;
towards midday arrived at Cooper Plains and crossed
Canoe Creek. Reached the Brisbane River opposite
the settlement at four o’clock.”
On July 16 of the same year several points of
Moreton Bay received their names by Government
order. The “Isle of Stradbroke” was so called “in com-
pliment to the Honorable J. 11. Rous, commanding
H.M.S. ‘Rainbow’ —the first ship of war to enter More-
ton Bay.”
Another order deals with the spot now so well
known in Queensland as the position of a Government
benevolent asylum. It sets out:—“The point of land
on the Isle of Stradbroke (which is intended as the site
of a public establishment) [quarantine], opposite to
Peel’s Island, is named Dunwich; and the anchorage
where the ‘Rainbow’ lay, Rainbow Beach. The channel
between the Isle of Stradbroke and Moreton Island is
named Rous Channel.” A further order announced
that the river recently discovered at Moreton Bay —
immediately to the southward of Brisbane —should be
called the Logan, as a record of the Governor’s appro-
bation of the zeal which Captain Logan, the comman-
dant of Moreton Bay, had evinced in adding to the
important discovery made by Mr. Oxley, the Surveyor-
General, of the River Brisbane in the year 1823.
April, 1829, was stamped with one of the ugly
stains which did so much in the early days to blacken
the name of the new continent in the eyes of people in
the Old World. On the eighteenth of the month, two
convicts, named Thomas Matthews and Thomas Allen,
were hanged for having knocked down and brutally
battered to death one of their comrades named John
Carroll. A few days later James Sullivan was hanged
for having killed a companion, Patrick McConderan.
Both were convicts. The former declared that he had
committed the crime in order that he might ‘‘himself
be freed from suffering worse than death.”
There is little room for doubting that the prisoners
were treated with exasperating brutality. Very much
of the crime committed was brought on by the severity
of the control; whilst men, transported for trifling
offences, whom tactful and considerate treatment might
have turned into valuable colonists, were transformed
into hardened criminals.
In 1828 the eastern settlement of Australia suffered
a deep loss in the death of one who had done so much
in exploration and development work. On February 26
of that year Oxley obtained leave of absence because of
ill-health. Major Thomas Livingston Mitchell, the


well-known explorer of new country in south-eastern
Australia, was appointed temporarily in his place; but
on May 25 Oxley died from sickness produced by over-
work. The following day Major Mitchell was gazetted
to the appointment. The deceased official had entered
the public service at an early age, and for sixteen years
he filled the post of Surveyor-General, which was
one of the most important the colony at that stage of
its growth had to offer. In the Government Order
which appointed Major Mitchell, the following is part
of the reference made to Mr. Oxley:—“His exertions in
the public service have been unwearied, as has been
proved by his several expeditions to explore the interior.
The public have reaped the benefit, while it is to be
apprehended that the event, which they cannot fail to
lament, has been accelerated by the privations and
fatigue he endured during the performance of these
arduous services. Mr. Oxley eminently assisted in
unfolding the advantages of this highly-favoured
country, and his name will ever be associated with the
dawn of its advancement. It is always gratifying to
the Government to record its approbation of the services
of meretorious public officers, and in assigning to Mr.
Oxley’s name a distinguished place in that class, to
which his devotion to the interests of the colony has so
justly entitled him, the Government would do honour to
his memory in the same degree as it feels the loss it
has sustained in his death.”
A tragic event occurred in the Moreton Bay district
in 1830. Captain Logan had then been four years in
command of the settlement. At the end of the year
he was to have returned to Sydney, after having ener-
getically, if somewhat harshly, discharged his duties to
the infant colony. Very much of his term of office he
had spent in leading exploring parties, both on sea and
land, and greatly had he added to the knowledge of
the nature of the land about Brisbane, and indeed for
a big radius beyond. His last desire was that, before
relinquishing the duties he had discharged for nearly
half a decade, he might complete a map which would
show the results of all the efforts made by himself and
others to examine the neighbourhood of Brisbane. On
October 9 he set out with a servant named Collison, of
the 57th Regiment, and five prisoners to correctly lay
down the twistings of the Brisbane River between Pine
Range, Lockyer Creek, and Mount Brisbane. He in-
tended to examine the windings of Lockyer Creek, which
left the main channel at the foot of Mount Brisbane and
returned by the Pumice-stone stream and Glasshouse
Mountains. The party took its requirements on two
pack-bullocks. When it was nearing the Pine Range
it found itself faced by a band of two hundred
hostile blacks. The latter were well up on the
side of the hill, and when the party was beneath the
savages rolled down large stones ; but they did not
succeed in inflicting any damage upon the explorers.
Collison fired a shot over the heads of the natives,
causing them to withdraw, and no spears or other
weapons were used. Other natives were encountered,
and in every instance their demeanour was threatening
and manifestly hostile. However, Captain Logan
apparently felt little alarm. On the return journey,
when near Mount Irwin, he remained some time behind
the others in order to carry out some geological investi-
gation. He had instructed the party where to camp
for the night, and he arranged to catch up with them
later in the evening. That was the last time he was
seen alive. During the night the party thought they
heard several coo-ees and four or five gunshots. They
replied, but the sounds died away.
At dawn two men were sent to follow the horse
tracks of Captain Logan. This they continued doing
until about noon, when between fifty and sixty blacks
made their appearance, waving their implements of
warfare. For some hour or more the natives followed,
endeavouring to get at close quarters, but ultimately
they broke away in the direction of Mount Irwin. That
was the way Captain Logan had gone the night before.
The two searchers met with no success in their quest.
But three days later another party found a space eaten
round, where a horse had been tethered. They also
discovered the tracks where Captain Logan had taken
the animal to water, and where he had lit a fire at the
stump of a tree and roasted chestnuts. The body of
neither man nor beast could be found, and it was
concluded that the former had sprung upon his horse
when suddenly attacked, and that he had succeeded in
making good his escape. The party then returned.
As Captain Logan made no appearance, a third
party set out to discover his whereabouts. They fell
in with still another body of men bent on the same
mission. The latter was under the command of a
surgeon named Cowper. After a lengthy search Mr.
Cowper found Captain Logan’s waistcoat and some
leaves of his notebook. They were covered with blood.
The next day Mr. Cowper found the horse, which had
been killed, covered with branches of trees and lying
at the bottom of a shallow creek. On the bank of the
stream, and only a few yards away Captain Logan’s
body was found in a grave, only about two feet deep.
The back of the head had been beaten to pulp with
waddies. The body was taken to Brisbane and finally
sent to Sydney. A Government Order bestowed high
praise upon the deceased commandant, who had “on
several occasions, at great personal risk, explored the
country to a considerable extent, and on one of these
he discovered a river which, in compliment to his ser-
vices, was named the Logan.”
About this time feeling towards the convict
element was running high. Arising from this


there was a persistent rumour at Moreton Bay
that poor Logan's death had been brought about by
the blacks having been incited to active hostility by
runaway prisoners who were living among the natives.
However, there was certainly no evidence advanced in
support of this somewhat wild theory.
The prisoners at Moreton Bay comprised many
grades of men. Some had been transported because of
stealing small quantities of bread for hungry children,
or other offences which to-day would meet with ao
greater punishment than the infliction of a light fine.
Others rvere brutal and irreclaimable criminals, who
exercised a contaminating influence on all with whom
they came in contact. All were treated with unrelent-
ing and debasing severity. The officials in charge of the
penal establishments held full power to inflict the most

crime for the punishment of which the sentence of
death is of law awarded, by solitary confinement,
according to the discretion of such commandant or two
or more magistrates; but that no such offender shall be
whipped more than three times for the same offence,
nor shall a greater number of lashes than one hundred
be inflicted upon any offender in one day. And I do
further declare and direct that no order for increased
labour or other punishments, except solitary confine-
ment, shall be carried into effect without the consent of

heart-rending punishment upon prisoners, about whose
guilt they were the sole judges. The wonder was that
some of the convicts, after regaining their liberty,
managed to live successful and reputable lives, and in
some instances to honestly amass considerable sums of
money.
An illuminating illustration of the official attitude
to the human beings who had been transported to penal
servitude is afforded by a proclamation issued by the
Governor, Lieutenant-General Darling, in October,
1830. The important portion of the proclamation read
as follows: —“Now I, the Governor aforesaid, do, by
this proclamation, declare and direct that the com-
mandants or persons in charge of the several penal
settlements now established in this colony, or its depend-
encies respectively, or any two or more magistrates in
any reason why the punishment should not be carried
into effect, will state the same to the commandant in

the offender can bear without endangering life.
In 1833 the “Isabella” brought to Moreton
Bay twenty of the class of convicts called
“specials.” These were men drawn from the
higher classes of society, who were held by the
authorities to have possessed all the benefits of good
education and early moral training, of which they had
failed to take advantage. Idle and dissolute habits had
made them industrially useless, even when engaged in
forced labour. Early in the same year a number of


these “specials” managed to make good their escape in
a Government boat, and though tlie “Isabella” made a
long and tedious search for them the effort proved quite
futile. The “Isabella” afterwards returned to Sydney
laden with specimens of the prolific nature of the locality
where the Brisbane settlement had been established.
Among these were cedar-tree rails, and specimens of
Moreton Bay wood. In August, 1834, a cargo brought
from Brisbane by the “Harriet” was sold by auction.
Among the sales resulting were 32,000 feet of cedar in
plank at per foot, and 8,000 bushels of maize at
3s. to 3s. 2d. per bushel.
In 1835 all the south-eastern portion of Queensland,
from the spot where Rockhampton now stands to the
County of Macquarie, in New South Wales, ran a very
narrow escape of falling into the grip of a mighty
private monopoly. The moving spirit in this happily
abortive enterprise was one Major Benjamin Sullivan,
who endeavoured to form a joint stock company which
would use poorer people from the United Kingdom,
whom it would assist to migrate on a grant of over
20,000,000 acres of the best of the coastal land.
The prospectus of this cool proposal is sufficiently
interesting to be worth quoting in part, even at this late
date, when private trusts, combines, and monopolies
are regarded with so much suspicion. The document
reads as follows :
“1. It is proposed that a joint stock company shall
be formed, to be called ‘The Eastern Australian Com-
pany,’ with a capital of one million sterling, to be raised
by twenty thousand shares of £5O, and paid in five
instalments.
“2. That the said company shall petition the Crown
to grant to it all the territory from 24° to 31° 10'
south latitude, and from the eastern seacoast of
Australia, including its adjacent isles, to 150° east
longitude, or from the coast to as far westward as the
dividing mountain range will permit, free from all
reserves and rights on the part of the Crown, save that
of the right of erecting such military and naval build-
ings as from time to time may be found necessary for
the protection of such territory and for the honour and
dignity of the Crown.”
A great number of clauses here follow, giving a
mass of detail and quoting authorities. The document
then goes on to say:
“The place where it would be advisable for such a
company to commence operations from should be Bris-
bane town, on the Brisbane River, which empties itself
into Moreton Bay, where the Crown possesses at present
several buildings of brick and stone, as also cattle, all
of which will be acquired by the company; therefore it
is recommended by the sixth clause that land should
be purchased at a fair and reasonable valuation from
the Crown, at three years’ credit.
“According to the existing regulations, His
Majesty has directed that none of his Crown lands shall
be given away, but that such should be sold, and that
in New South Wales such sale shall not be under the
minimum price of five shillings per acre, for the purpose
of establishing a fund to assist individuals of Great
Britain and Ireland in emigrating to it.
“Such a company as the one proposed cannot expect
to have land granted to it by the Crown but by pur-
chase ; nevertheless it may be presumed that His Majesty
would be favourably disposed towards such a company,
and that he would therefore be induced to command
that the proposed lands should be allowed to be pur-
chased by such company at the aforesaid fixed valua-
tion, in the course of fifty years, by annual instal-
ments. ”
Probably not before or since has so startling a
suggestion ever been made for the alienation of
Australia’s natural resources. Those, however, were
not the days when great aggregations of capitalistic
control were regarded with the suspicion prevailing
at the present day. The Standard Oil Trust had
not arisen like a mighty giant to crush competition.
The American Beef Trust had not ruined stock-raisers
at the same time as increasing the price of
meat to consumers. Shipping combines had not
arbitrarily fixed freights to suit only themselves. The
forces of active competition were still clearly at work in
all the industrial and commercial spheres. Monopoly
had not begun the slaughter of the natural forces of
demand and supply. Yet the proposal of Major Sulli-
van contained a good deal more than the Government of
that day could swallow. The proposal to hand over
what was perhaps the most prolific portion of the conti-
nent to a private syndicate, which was to pay only five
shillings per acre, spread over a period of fifty years,
the Government retaining only the right of defending
the company’s property from foreign aggression, was
something more than the Imperial Government could
consent to. The joroposition was rejected.
Then Major Sullivan addressed a letter to the
people of New South Wales. The epistle is quoted in
full in “The Genesis of Queensland,” by Mr. Henry
Stuart Russell. The document reads as follows:
“To the free inhabitants of New South Wales.
Port Macquarie, August 20, 1836.
“Gentlemen—ln the latter end of 1832 I undertook
the laborious task of drawing up a systematic plan for
colonizing the different parts of this immense island
without imposing any additional burden upon His
Majesty’s Home Government, and proposed therein that
the experiment should be tried by an incorporated joint
stock agricultural, commercial, and political company
on the eastern coast—that is, from 31° 10' to 23 0 30'
south latitude.


“That plan, from several unforeseen circumstances,
I was prevented from transmitting to His Majesty’s
Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies till the
month of September, 1833.
“In December, 1834, I was honoured with an
answer from Mr. Spring Rice, through Mr. Lefevre,
the Under-Secretary of State, dated the previous month
of July, stating that ‘His Majesty’s Government, having
no intention of forming any settlement in that quarter,
Mr. Spring Rice regrets that he is thus precluded from
entertaining any project of the nature of that which
you have submitted, and that he is the more concerned
in being obliged to come to such a decision from the
care and attention which you have bestowed upon the
subject.’
with two other Germans, were taken to Brisbane by the
“Isabella,” leaving Sydney on March 20. Other Ger-
man clergymen had come from England by the same
ship, and these were to follow their colleagues at the
earliest opportunity, and the whole were to form the
“Presbytery of Moreton Bay.” All the 235 immigrants
had been selected by the Rev. Dr. Lang, a colonial,
when that gentleman was on a visit to the United
Kingdom. In dealing with the work which this Dr.
Lang did for Queensland, Mr. Russell, in “The Genesis
of Queensland,” gives the following account:
“The merits of Dr. Lang’s enthusiastic work for
Moreton Bay came to light prominently on the second
day of the opening year 1839. A meeting was held in
the School of Arts, Sydney, in aid of this mission.
BANANA GROVE, AT WOOMBYE, NORTH COAST RAILWAY.
“1 have the honour to be, gentlemen, your most
obedient humble servant, Benj. Sullivan.”
The years 1838 and 1839 contain some interesting
events in the immigration of Germans to these shores.
On January 25, 1838, the “Minerva” from Greenock
arrived in Sydney with 235 emigrants, among whom
an unfortunate outbreak of typhus fever had occurred,
so that the ship’s company had to be immediately placed
in quarantine. Among the new arrivals were thirteen
German clerics, with their wives and children, who had
made the voyage with the intention to establish a
mission station in that part of New South Wales which
now forms Queensland. The thirteen were all ordained
clergymen, and the mission station was to be under the
supervision of the Synod of New South Wales. These,
Dr. Lang had in 1836 made application to the
local Government for assistance towards establish-
ing German Presbyterians at Moreton Bay, bub
met with no favourable reply. Subsequently two
more appeals were made, and at length the Government
promised a sum equal to what might be raised by
private subscriptions for the purpose. When Dr. Lang
went home he visited Germany and arranged at Berlin
for the selection of twenty persons, clergy and laity,
who consented to join the undertaking. They had
sailed from Greenock under the charge of the Rev. Mr.
Schmidt, and, as already shown, had arrived just
a year ago, proceeded to the settlement, and
been principally engaged ever since in building
their dwellings, etc. The full amount of £517


contributed and granted had been slightly exceeded
by disbursements.”
There is little doubt that these practically assisted
German immigrants formed the magnet which after-
wards drew to Queensland so large a number of their
countrymen, who have so much added to the perplexity
of the Federal Government during Great Britain’s war
against the German Empire.
About this time the Government appears to have
grown tired of the penal settlement at Moreton Bay.
The blacks had grown particularly troublesome, whilst
the 1,400 odd convicts showed great ease in escaping.
The physical features of the country appeared to favour
such enterprises. Consequently the steamer “Sophia
Jane” was sent to Brisbane to bring back a large por-
tion of the Government paraphernalia. She returned
with the Commandant, Major Colton, and his family;
Lieutenant Aitken, of the 28th Begiment; Mr. Parker,
the Superintendent of Stock; Messrs. White, Spicer,
Sheridan, and Hallan, Mr. and Mrs. Cox and four
children, 57 female and 19 male prisoners, 23 soldiers,
and others. Left behind were a subaltern, commissariat
officer, assistant surgeon, and some prisoners. The penal
station was allowed, however, to remain. It was the
discovery and exploitation of the wonderful land west
of Brisbane as well as along the coast which gave the
quick subsequent spurt to the development of the
settlement.
CHAPTER X.
DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTH-WEST.
The growth of Brisbane and of southern Queensland
is due largely to the settlement of the Darling Downs.
That fertile region offered to pastoralists something more
promising in productiveness than most of what they had
yet discovered. The exploration of the colony will be
specially dealt with in a separate part of this work; but
to understand the industrial and commercial evolution
of the place it is necessary to trace the impressions gained
by the earliest travellers of that region of which
Toowoomba is now the commercial capital.
The first comprehensive knowledge of the Darling
Downs was obtained by Allan Cunningham, the Govern-
ment Botanist, in 1827. Fourteen years before the ex-
plorers Messrs. Blaxland, Lawson, and Wentworth had
passed over the Blue Mountains. Subsequently Mr.
Oxley had penetrated as far north as the latitude of
31°. Cunningham desired to know what lay beyond.
He placed before Governor Darling a project for jour-
neying from Liverpool Plains to the shores of Moreton
Bay. His Excellency immediately fell in with the pro-
ject, and the necessary equipment was prepared for the
expedition. It was arranged that the party should pro-
ceed as far to the westward as circumstances permitted.
Six servants accompanied Cunningham. They had
eleven horses and provisions enough to last for fourteen
weeks.
Cunningham reached the Darling Downs in the
middle of the winter of that year, and we can well under-
stand the enthusiasm with which he regarded the
panorama of rich land which stretched away before him
as far as the eye could reach, and unaltered day by
day as he made his progress northward. The impressions
following on the discovery of this fertile region are
sufficiently interesting to be worth quoting. They are
in extracts from Cunningham’s journal, and read
as follows :
“June I.—The smokes which we had for the last
two days observed to rise from the country to the north-
ward and eastward of us, considered with the frequent
screeching in that direction of the white cockatoo (a
bird loving to inhabit forest lands in the neighbourhood
of rivers), fully satisfied me that we were on the verge
of a desirable country. At our usual hour of departure
in the morning we, hastening from the spot on which
we had passed the previous night, pursued our way in
an east-north-east direction.
“Beyond a patch of stony forest ground of rather
open character we crossed (at our second mile) a rocky
creek dipping easterly, having some clear pools of water
in its channel and grass on its margin. From the pitch
of a ridge immediately above this watercourse we had a
most agreeable though confined view of an extensive
range of open country lying in the direction of our
course, which from its ample feature and prospect I
doubted not would in its examination abundantly reward
all our labours in penetrating to it, through a consider-
able tract of desert country, stretching back to the south-
ward of the parallel of 29°. A hollow in the forest
ridge immediately before us allowed me distinctly to
perceive that, at a distance of eight or nine miles,
open plains or downs of great extent appeared to extend
easterly to the base of a lofty range of mountains, lying
north and south, distant about thirty miles. With the
fullest expectation of being able to reach the western
margin of these downs at an early period of the day, we
proceeded forward at a quickened pace through an open
growing forest to our eighth mile, when our observed
latitude appeared to be 28° IF 10" S. Already had the


land become much thinner of timber, and we had not
advanced half a mile further before we came upon a
patch of open plain, skirted by a low ridge of forest hills
on its western side, and by a closely-wooded forest ground
on the opposite point.
“On climbing a low stony ridge in our way it was
really with the greatest satisfaction that we perceived
we had approached within two miles of the downs, and
as small patches or strips of mist extended throughout
their whole length, and a line of swamp oak stretched
along their south-western extreme, it was clearly shown
us that these extensive tracts of timberless land were
not wanting in water. Upon accomplishing a journey
of thirteen miles (the last one extending over a com-
mencement of the great plains) we arrived at the left
bank of a small river, about fifteen yards in breadth,
having a brisk current to the north-west. There was in
“The anglers caught several fine cod, and while thus
successfully occupied on the bank of the river three
natives were remarked in the adjoining forest ground
on the opposite bank firing the dried herbage of these
woods; they did not, however, venture to approach
towards my people, but without manifesting the least
alarm walked leisurely away to the more distant parts of
the forest.
“June 6. —Immediately after noon of June 6 we
quitted our resting-place and proceeded up the river
about half a mile, crossed to the opposite bank at a ford
previously discovered by one of my party. From this
stream, which I named Condamine River, in compliment
to the officer who is aide-de-camp to His Excellency the
Governor, we entered upon the extensive downs before
us, pursuing our way to the east-north-east along their
southern margin. During the afternoon of the 6th and
PINEAPPLE PLANTATION, WOOMBYE, NORTHERN QUEENSLAND.
all parts of its channel, in the neighbourhood of the spot
at which we had made, very deep water, which afford-
ing every encouragement to my people to employ a period
of the afternoon in fishing, I sent them away along the
left bank, furnishing each with hooks and lines.
“In the meanwdiile I obtained some sets of lunar
distances with the sun, the mean result of which gave
me for the meridian of my tent 151° 39' 45"; but as for
the accurately measured distance between it and the
north-easternmost encampment of this journey (the situ-
ation of which was determined by several observations
aided by correct bearings to certain fixed points on the
coastline), upon being reduced placed the position of
my encampment If' to the eastward. Its situation may
be stated as follows:—Long., 151° 41' 30" E.; lat., by
observation at noon of sth, 28° 9' 37" S.; its mean eleva-
tion above the seashore, by barometer, being 1,402 ft.
following day we travelled throughout their whole
extent to the base of the mountains that bound them
on their eastern extreme, and during the progress
of our journey made the following observations on their
apparent extent, soil, and capability. These extensive
tracts of open country, which I subsequently named (by
permission) Darling Downs, in honour of His Excellency
the Governor, are situate in or about the mean parallel
of 28° 8' S., along which they extend, each eighteen
miles, to the meridian of 152°. On the northern side
they are bounded by a very gentle rise of lightly-wooded
ridge, and on their opposite margin by a level forest of
box and white gum of ordinary timber. A chain of deep
ponds, supported by streams from lofty ranges immedi-
ately to the eastward, passes along the central lower flats
of these downs throughout their whole length, and
uniting in seasons of heavy rains falls westerly into


Condamine River. Their breadth varies in different parts
of the lengthened surface, appearing at the western
extremity not to exceed one and a half miles, whilst
towards the eastern limits it was estimated at three
miles. The lower parts, by a deeply-grooved water-
course, form flats, which, in consequence of their per-
manent moisture, furnish a very considerable range of
cattle pasture at all seasons of the year, the grasses and
herbage exhibiting generally in depth of winter an
extraordinary luxuriance of growth. Among the mass
of excellent vegetation produced on these flats, no plant
appeared more striking in its growth than a species of
rib grass (Flantago struthionis), the leaves of which
measured from 12 to 15 in. in length.
“From these central grounds rise downs of a rich
black and dry soil, which extend several miles to the
eastward, and as they furnish an abundance of herbage,
and are conveniently watered, yet perfectly beyond the
reach of those irrigations which take place on the flats in
wet seasons, they constitute a most valuable sound sheep
pasture, the permanently dry nature of which may be
inferred from the fact of there being a difference of
300 ft. between the upper or eastern limit and the Con-
damine River, as shown by the mean results of
barometrical admeasurements.
“Towards the close of the afternoon of the 7th,
having gained the forest ground on the eastern verge of
the downs, we continued our course to the northward
and eastward about one and a half miles through a truly
beautiful apple-tree forest, abounding in kangaroos ;
when upon reaching the base of a remarkable flat-topped
mount, forming the termination of a portion of the
lateral range to which I had taken a bearing when
twenty-five miles to the south-west, I encamped on the
bank of a narrow creek, furnishing plenty of water, and
upon a patch of the finest meadow pasture I have seen
in New South Wales.
“Here I gave my wearied horses two days’ rest,
some having been reduced to a state of extreme debility
and all having suffered considerably in condition by the
severity of the journey form Liverpool Plains.
“Whilst, therefore, they were recovering a degree
of strength by rest and sound pasture, I was busily
engaged examining the dark brushes which clothed the
adjacent mountain from its base to its very summit, the
vegetation of which appeared altogether tropical.
“The morning of the Bth proving exceedingly fine
I set out from the encampment, accompanied by one of
my party, to ascend the table mount above our tents,
from the elevated summit of which I had promised
myself an extensive prospect around. After pushing our
way through a mass of dense thicket investing the foot
and flank of this eminence, we gained an open spot on its
flat summit in about two hours, and were gratified ex-
ceedingly by the extensive view afforded us of the country
from the north by way of west, and thence to south and
south-south-east to the more remarkable points, of which
bearings were taken.
“At north-north-west, and especially at north, the
country presented a broken and irregular surface, form-
ing a series of heavily-timbered ridges, extending later-
ally from the more elevated chain of mountains immedi-
ately to the eastward, and which, stretching in the
direction of the meridian, appeared to constitute the
main or dividing range of this part of the interior.
“From the north-west to west, and thence to south,
the eye surveyed a vast expanse of open country tame
and uninteresting in the distance, but exhibiting within
a range of twenty miles every feature of hill and dale,
woodland and plain, to diversify the ample, outstretched
landscape.
“Large clear patches of land lying to the north of
Darling Downs were named Peel Plains, whilst others,
bearing to the south and south-east of an ample
undulating surface, were entitled Canning Downs, in
o ’ o 7
honour of the late Right Hon. George Canning. The
extent of these downs easterly we were unable from the
point on which we stood to observe, but on the south they
were bounded by a lofty ridge of hills, lying nearly east
and west, which was named Harris Range.
“Directing the view to the north-west beyond
Peel Plains an immeasurable expanse of flat country met
the eye, on which not the slightest eminence could be
observed to interrupt the common level, which, in con-
sequence of the very clear state of the atmosphere, could
be discerned to a very distant blue line of horizon verging
on the parallel of 27° and meridian of 151°.
“Extremely gratifying as it was to take a bird’s eye
survey of so extensive a range of pastoral country as
appeared beneath us (the discovery of which had recom-
pensed us for the privation we had met with in our
journey extending by admeasurement 340 statute miles
from Hunter River), still the question arose in my mind
from what point so fine a country could be approached,
seeing that at east and north-east, in the direction of
Moreton Bay, a very lofty range of mountains, immedi-
ately bounding us, constituted a barrier very difficult to
be passed.
“As all observation easterly towards the coastline
was thus prevented we descended to the tents, heavy
weather having come on from the north.
This flat-top eminence, which I observed formed
the north-western angle of a body of lateral hills ex-
tending from the leading range of these mountains, was
named Mount Dumaresq, and along its northern side a
grassy valley, stretching from the great downs north-
easterly to the immediate foot of the main range,
received the appellation of Millar Valley.
“Rain having set in, it continued almost without
intermission for forty-eight hours, until the morning of


the 10th inst., when fair weather was again restored
to us, and we quitted our encamping ground with
the intention of penetrating towards the higher points
of these mountains, from the summits of which I
expected to obtain bearings to the fixed points on the
coast. Pursuing a course to the south of the base
of a thickly-wooded ridge, stretching from Mount
Dumaresq, about four miles to a second hill of tabular
figure, we passed round its foot, and altering our course
to north-east entered a very beautiful grassy vale,
bounded by a lofty lateral ridge, and like Millar Valley,
leading directly to the base of the principal range.
“Advancing about five miles up this vale, which
I named ofter Captain Logan, the present indefatigable
commandant of the penal settlement at Moreton Bay,
I again halted on a small brook meandering through
north-north-east, was, however, remarked, to the pitch
of which the declivity from the head of Millar Valley
seemed very moderate, and as this gap appeared likely
to prove on examination a very practicable pass through
these formidable mountains, I determined to employ
a day in exploring it. The next day was spent in
exploring the Gap.”
“These mountains,” wrote Cunningham, “to the
western base of which we approached from a sterile
southern region, form the dividing range in this part
of the country, and give rise to the waters falling as
well on the coast as westerly to the distant interior;
and as the barometrical observations made on the lateral
range gave a result of 3,735 feet, and the extreme ridge
appeared at least 300 feet higher, its elevation above
the level of the sea may be considered about 4,100 feet.
GATHERING GRAPES AT ROMA, WESTERN QUEENSLAND.
to the south—a remarkable double-headed mount of the
same range, bearing north-east by east, about ten miles.
Dense brushy forests clothing the bases of the lateral
ranges immediately overlooking our encampment were
productive of a number of curious plants not before
known; and it was in these I first clearly and satisfac-
torily recognized the pine (araucaria), which I had
formerly observed in greater numbers in the dark
brushes of the Brisbane River.”
Cunningham then remained at this depot for three
days, examining the surrounding country and its
vegetation. The weather proved unfavourable for an
examination of the main range in order to discover
how best to find a pass by which to reach Brisbane.
But "a very singular, deeply-excavated part of the
range, bearing from my station on the lateral ridge
The forest ridges, which were heavily timbered with
stringybark of great bulk, were found clothed to their
summits with grass of the most luxuriant growth, and
being well watered by numerous trickling rills, originat-
ing between the shoulders of the hills, constitute a very
specious range of the richest cattle pasture.
"Upon examining the hollow-back of the mountain
ridge it was found to be very nigged and difficult, large
masses of rock having fallen down from the lands on
each side into the gap, which was overgrown with strong
twining plants. Immediately to the south, however, the
range presented a very moderate surface, over which a
line of road might be constructed without much labour,
as the rise from Millar Valley proved by no means
abrupt, and the fall easterly from the range to the
forest ground at its base appeared of singularly easy


declivity. Looking north-easterly the eye wandered
with pleasure over a fine open grazing country, very
moderately timbered, with patches of clear plain, and
detached wooded ridges to diversify the surface, and
in no part did there appear the slightest obstacle to
prevent a communication either with the southern
shore of Moreton Bay or the banks of the Brisbane
River.
“In taking a general view of the very superior
country at which the labours of my party terminated,
northerly, it was gratifying to observe the range of
luxuriant pasturage, this subject of our discovery, in
its plains, rising downs, open woodlands, valleys, and
even elevated forest ranges, has thrown open to our
most extensive flocks and herds, in a genial climate, and
at an elevation of 1,800 feet above the seashore.
“Its timbers, moreover, add to its importance. The
summit and flanks of the ranges produce great abund-
ance of well-grown stringybark, whilst the lower ridges
furnish stately pine of the species already well known
on the Brisbane, varying from sixty to eighty feet in
height, and as small saplings of the red cedar were
observed on the margin of the brushes investing the
base of the hills, large trees of this valuable wood are
doubtless to be met with in their more remote recesses.
Although neither coal nor limestone was found in this
tract of country, a quarry of freestone, seemingly well
adapted to building, could be easily opened on the
bank of a creek about two miles south of Logan Yale.
In fine, upon the consideration that we are occupying a
country in which, in the absence of navigable rivers, an
expensive land carriage must ever be resorted to in the
conveyance of produce of the inland to the coast, the
value of this extensive range of pastoral country is
not a little enhanced in its proximity to the seashore,
and the seeming facility with which we may reasonably
conclude from the moderate appearance of the inter-
jacent country to the eastward of these mountains, the
fleeces of its growth, as well as the general produce of
its soil, will at some future time be borne down to the
shores of Moreton Bay. The base of these mountains
is a compact whinstone; on the higher ridges was
observed amygdaloid of the trap formation, with
nodules of quartz, whilst the summit exhibited a por-
phyritic rock, very porous, containing numerous minute
quartzose crystalizations.”
While camped at Logan Vale Cunningham encoun-
tered one native, who fled in great alarm to the thicker
bush. Cunningham concluded that from the man's fear
of the strangers that he must fear white men because
of never having heard of the settlement on the shores
of Moreton Bay. This he considered was evidence of
there being but little communication between the blacks
on the east and on the west sides of the Dividing Range.
Upon quitting Logan Vale on June 16, the party
commenced its journey to the southward through what the
leader described as “a fine open forest country, abound-
ing in excellent pasture and tolerable timber, and
watered by a reedy creek falling westerly, evidently into
the Condamine River.”
Cunningham's discoveries led to the occupation of
the Darling Downs. He returned overland to Sydney,
having enjoyed but one glance through the mountain
barrier to the country surrounding the settlement of
Brisbane. The settlement of the Downs did not advance
for thirteen years, and then went through the usual
pioneering stages which have characterized most of the
conquest of the Australian inland resources.
Another early traveller through the Darling Downs
was Henry Stuart Russell. His opinion of them he
wrote as follows: —“After a few day’s rest, during
which my first impression of the Darling Downs was
quite and forever effaced, as I became less green to their
real worth, apart from the wealth which they bore upon
their bosom in essential adaption to the requirements of
the sheepfarmer, the varied richness of herbs and grasses,
the depth of the flat soil, the open plains, on which 4,000
sheep could be watched with as much ease as 500 in the
closely-timbered forest land to which they had been
accustomed, and above all things, the evidence that the
climate was of so happy a medium that catarrh lost its
terror, and the prognostications of knowing-ones far
away south that the wool would, so near the tropics,
quickly become ‘poor,’ were set at nought by manifest
improvement—l was assured, in some respects which I
did not understand, no burr, no grass seed, no well!
I was in an Elysian field; and truly it was, as I learned
to take in all its features, a scene of great beauty, and
beauty stamped in value I had no sense of yet. And
this tarpaulin triangled upon the ground by a few
poles, lashed together at the top by greenhide, was a
head station ! only temporary, however. One little tree
leant away from it; the trees were very sparse on the
ridge at the back; a dog, cross of greyhound and I know
not what else, in fact, ‘lucher-like,’ was chained to it;
the ashes of a fire which was played out by sun heat;
a few quart pots, iron pots, a double-barrelled gun
(Rogers), and under the tarpaulin a cask which was full
of salt mutton; half the inevitable damper on top of
it; and hidden by another tarpaulin pegged to the
ground, the necessaria qucedam alie vivendi, tea, sugar,
tobacco, etc.” The same writer goes on later to describe
these early impressions in the following language: “The
long reach of treeless (barring those absurd grass-trees
and their top-knots) grass plain from the east and up
the watershed, narrowing as it ascends in that direction,
widening as it descends to us, and yet widening until
it elbows itself into the expanse of prairie through which
we had ridden from the crossing-place; the long, rank
grass wavering and shimmering under a light breath of


air now and then, soothing the glare of the sun; the
ridges and forest dwarfed by distance, always, in me
at least, raising the wish to know what was beyond them
again: the feeling among the few who, having run
Leslie (the pioneer of the pastoral resources of the
Darling Downs) to earth, had yet set eyes on these new
spots, which themselves, as yet untrodden, beckoned us
on and on, all combined to light up a panorama of
present enchantment which receded into a dissolving
view of recesses yet in gloom.”
The journals of Cunningham contain an interesting
account of an expedition made to the Gap which bears
his name, from the eastern side. On August 18, 1828,
the party set out towards the Limestone Hills in a
south-westerly direction, facing the hollow in the main
range, which can be seen from elevated positions even
from Brisbane. The first portion of the journey was
through a variety of nearly level country. At first
of the feet of the bullocks which were being used, and
which had travelled over stony ground. Considerable
difficulty was met with in climbing the rapidly rising
ground, through which it was necessary to pass in order
to get to the Gap. A halt was called early in the after-
noon, within four miles of the mouth of the Gap, which
a man was selected to push forward to and examine.
He found himself, however, faced with a wall of perpen-
dicular rock, rising from a ravine, stopping his progress
after he had advanced in direct distance about three
miles. Cunningham here writes: "From the precipitous
aspect of this hollow in the main range, its elevated
appearance, its breadth between the boundary heads,
added to the impracticability of gaining its level from
the spot on which our tents stood, I was induced to
conceive that the Gap into which I had simply looked
from its western side in June, 1827, and which certainly
did appear to offer a very practicable passage through
ORCHARD AT MAPLETON, NORTH COAST RAILWAY.
the timber was thick, but gradually the land became
more open. It was apparent that open downs were
being approached. Near Mount Forbes, which had been
named in 1824 by Mr. Oxley, water was discovered after
a very uncomfortable experience caused by the lack
of it. A few miles further on a pleasing aspect of well-
grassed plains was met with. In many parts the
pastures were very verdant, and the locality was watered
by a large creek to which Cunningham gave the name
of Bowerman, in compliment to the third officer in
charge of the Government magazine at Parramatta.
The country next passed through contained abundant
grass, but a scarcity of water was conspicuous. The
locality was suffering from the effects of a drought,
which had for a long while prevailed over the surround-
ing districts. On approaching to the Gap the progress
grew necessarily slow, because of the extreme tenderness
to the eastward, was very distinct from the one now
before us, and as the Dividing Range to the north of
us trended out easterly, I felt disposed to believe it
was to be discerned a few miles in that direction. With
this impression on my mind we left the spot on which
we had rested in the morning of the 22nd to proceed
round the extremes of the lateral ridges, a day’s journey
to the north, intending to observe attentively as we
travelled along the grassy valley we had crossed every
indentation of the main range. We immediately entered
the valley, and in five miles reached its head, which to
the eastward is bounded by rather elevated open forest
hills.” After continuing for a couple of miles the ex-
plorers descended to an apple-tree flat, watered by a creek
running to the northward, beside which they camped.
Cunningham determined to remain encamped in
the same spot until a fuller knowledge of the immediate


neighbourhood should be ascertained. With that end in
view he sent two of his men to climb to the top of the
highest peak of the main range they could find, and
from there to look for the pass through which their
leader had looked to the eastward during the previous
year. Late in the afternoon they returned with a full
description of the country to the westward, and with
the news that no other gap in the mountains could be
found. From this and other evidence “it was rationally
concluded that either the hollow-back we had just left
was the identical pass of last year, or it was in the
immediate vicinity.”
A return was then made to the Gap first approached.
The party was possessed “of the fullest determination to
examine leisurely the main range about it, from the
extreme points of which I felt quite certain the last
year’s gap would be discovered.” A camp was made
about three miles from the entrance of the Gap. An
experienced member of the party was sent to attempt
the pass by means of ascending ridges which appeared
to lead to the highest point of the pass. At dark he
returned with news of his success, and related how he
had looked over an extensive panorama to the west of
the main range. Included in the landscape spreading
before, and of which he was able to recognize, were
the Darling and Canning Downs, patches of Peel Plains,
and several remarkable points of the forest hills on that
side. The latter served to fully identify the Gap with
that through which Cunningham liad seen the coastal
country during the previous year. Thus was the
Government botanist in a double sense the discoverer
of the Gap in the mountains which rightly bears his
name. He had found it both from the west and from
the east.
Naturally Cunningham was determined not to quit
the gateway to the prolific western downs until he had
thoroughly explored the practicability of the pass. The
botanist early next morning, accompanied only by his
servant, set out to penetrate the hollow-back. He
utilized a ridge, on which the acclivity was very gradual,
though the surface made transit rather slow because of
the great number of stones which were met with.
Keeping to the ridge, however, the two men found their
way with no particular difficulty to opposite the summit
of the pass, over which towered a great mountain on
either side. The real difficulties now began. The foot
of the pass had been gained, but directly ahead was a
steep slope leading to the level of the entrance. After
proceeding some distance through dense timber the
explorers reached the foot of a wall of brre rock,
stretching into the pass from the south. But investiga-
tion showed that to the north this barricade dropped
to the common level. With the utmost ease Cunning-
ham was thus able to reach the highest point in the
pass. They then walked through to the spot at which
the western country could be seen. Afterwards Cun-
ningham gave a, detailed explanation of how a road
might be constructed through the Gap.
The real settlement of the Darling Downs began
after the thirties. Allegations have been made of
an earlier beginning. But no station was formed there
before 1840. The country available for the stock-
owner in those regions displayed all evidences of abun-
dant fertility. Those who had set out on excursions of
discovery found that the grasses and herbage generally
possessed peculiarly nourishing quality, horses and oxen
being able to accomplish more work when not stable-fed
in the interior of what is now Queensland than the same
animals could get through in more southern regions.
But Moreton Bay was far from the centre of Australian
pastoral activity; and every year was adding to the
quantity of rich, suitable country known of but as yet
unexploited. There was, moreover, the element of
speculation and risk in carrying enterprise far to the
north, where sheep-farming had not yet been tried, and
where many pastoralists confidently believed that the
wool would deteriorate in quality.
The first settler of the Darling Downs was Patrick
Leslie. In contradiction to certain statements to the
contrary he himself wrote: “I believe no white man
(but runaway convicts, and I believe none such ever
were on the downs) ever set foot on Darling Downs
from the time Cunningham discovered them till I went
there. As for any stations being formed before 1840 it
is simple rubbish.” Russell in “The Genesis of Queens-
land” adopts the same view. He writes: “It took
thirteen years (from 1827) for the rare stalk on which
he (Cunningham) had grafted the first shoot of civiliza-
tion to bear ever a bud; but then how rapid the
blossoming; how plenteous the harvest!”
On February 21, 1840, Dr. John Dobie, Walter
Leslie, and Patrick Leslie arrived in the New England
district of New South Wales in search of a road down
the Clarence River. Before leaving Sydney Patrick
Leslie had heard from Allan Cunningham a full account
of the marvellous new country which he had discovered
to the westward of Moreton Bay. In company of a
servant named Peter Murphy, Patrick Leslie left
New England and proceeded in a northerly direction ;
and on March 14, after crossing the Severn River, they
came to Pike Creek, and on March 20 they made the
Darling Downs. They explored the Condamine to
Canning Downs, and other portions of the Downs,
ultimately returning to Falconer Plains, where Dr.
Dobie was encamped. They unavailingly besought him
to accompany them back to the Darling Downs; but he
refused to leave the Clarence. This was in April. A
few days later Walter Leslie arrived from Sydney with
sheep, drays, and other equipment. In his diary
Patrick Leslie writes: “We had twenty-two men, all


ticket-of-leave, or convicts, as good and game a lot of
men as ever existed, and who never occasioned us a
moment’s trouble; worth any forty men I have ever
seen since.”
The party set forth with 4,000 breeding ewes, 24
working bullocks, a team of horses and dray, and 10
saddle horses. That was the equipment with which
they determined to begin to conquer the pastoral
resources of the Darling Downs, and incidentally of
Queensland. The expedition’ arrived on the Condamine
River on June 4 without the loss of a single animal, or
the breaking of even a bullock-chain, so suitable was
the land over which it had passed for pastoral
enterprise. Two days later the Leslies and Murphy left
the plant in charge of the men on the river, and went
out to investigate the surrounding country.
The pioneers of those days were explorers as well as
the founders of industry in the unknown wilderness.
Drawn by the subtle romance of conducting big
then formed Canning Downs head station. They took
up all the country from the bottom of Toolburra to
the head of the Condamine, including the tributaries.
At a later date they gave up what came to be known as
the Glengallan Creek to the Campbells, and Sandy
Creek to the Aberdeen Company, besides some other
country to others. Thus was a beginning made with
the settlement of the interior of what was to become
Queensland.
In his diary Patrick Leslie writes: “We (on July 2)
encamped the drays, etc., on the knoll on which Tool-
burra head station was afterwards built, and on July 7
I left Walter at Toolburra, and making my way by our
own marked tree line, I met Dalrymple on the 9th, with
our cattle, at Quart-pot Creek, camped the night with
him, and next day I went on and made the Severn
River on the 12th. Found Cox had formed a cattle
station since we passed up. Stopped the night there,
and having next day made Blaxland’s station on Fraser
CANE TRIAN AT MACKAY.
undertakings on a skeleton scale, where no white man
had previously set foot, the first graziers were continually
inspired to take bold risks and accomplish big things.
The Leslies and Murphy were determined that their
effort should not fail through lack of either courage or
energy on their own part. Having parted from the
others, they shaped their course to the north, and
crossed what are now known as Allora, Spring Creek,
King Creek, Hodgson Creek, Cowrie, and other settle-
ments. Later they crossed through Cunningham Gap to
the coastal side of the main range, and passed on to the
Bremer River, intending to reach Brisbane. After-
thoughts generated fear of arriving at the settlement
without credentials, and the three men returned to the
Condamine, where they reached the camp on July 1.
Next day they formed their head station about four
miles down the stream, at Toolburra. This place was
afterwards sold to a squatter named Gordon. The Leslies
Creek, also formed since we passed up; on July 14
came on to Wyndham’s station, where we commenced
blazing our line on our way up. . . . Hodgson
must have reached the Darling Downs early in Sep-
tember, being the first who went off on my line. We
were the only people on Darling Downs for fully three
months, we arriving on June 4, Hodgson in September.
I think King and Sibley were the next settlers,
or probably Isaac, who went out with Hodgson, may
have selected Cowrie before King and Sibley arrived. I
am not sure of this, but if Isaac selected before King
and Sibley, the latter had their stock up before Isaac.
It was Frederick Isaac who went up with Hodgson.
“It is a fact beyond any doubt that the farthest
northern stations in New England when I went out to
the Downs were Garden and Bennett’s, on the east side
of New England, and George Wyndham’s station on
the west side of the same district; and drawing a line


from Garden and Bennett’s to Wyndham’s, no
squatter had ever a hoof to the northward until we
took ours.
“When our blacks became so far tamed as to hold
communication with us they told us that the thing
which terrified them most (when they first saw me and
Murphy four miles below Toolburra on March 20) was
our dismounting, their full impression being that man
and horse were one animal. Is it likely such would
have been their impression had any white man ever
been on the Downs, as Messrs. Sutherland say ?
“As to Warwick, it was never thought of till the
end of 1847, when the Government instructed me to
select a spot for the township on the Condamine below
Canning Downs, and it must have been in 1848 when
the first settlement took place.
“In 1847 George Leslie had a sheep station on the
very spot where Warwick now stands. I think it was
in 1848 that the first land sale was held, and I was the
first man who bought a lot, being instigated to such
speculation, extending to <£4, by a sawyer named John
Russell, a well-known character in those days, who
when the first lot was put up addressed me as follows:
'Come here, Patrick Leslie, buy that little lot for
luck ; you were the first man here, be the first to buy.’
And I bought it.”
Leslie states that neither Drayton nor Toowoomba
existed till long after. In 1848 Drayton consisted only
of “Bill Horton’s” public-house and a shanty or two,
with one well for the town. Toowoomba also first began
to exist long after the first pastoral settlement.
In 1841 Cunningham Gap was first crossed by
wheeled vehicles. Messrs. Hodgson and Gilbert Elliot,
two partners, the latter having been aide-de-camp to Sir
G. Gipps, made the Pass with drays from west to east,
but found themselves utterly unable to return. Then
an effort was made by the Commandant, Lieutenant
Owen Gorman, to get across from east to west. He had
an Irish jaunting car specially constructed for the
purpose. A convict named Baker, who knew the
country better probably than anyone else, was ques-
tioned and taken with the Commandant. A pair of
armed constables completed the party. Baker had
lived as an escaped prisoner for some years in the
neighbourhood of the Gap. The ultimate objective was
to visit Hodgson and Elliott, who had returned home
by a longer route. For days Gorman traversed through
the timbered land, with occasional open plains, which
intervened between the mountains and Brisbane.
Llaving reached the bottom of the pass, all but
Baker were unable to believe in the possibility of
ascending the height appearing to tower before them.
But the convict knew hie way, and he knew it practic-
able of negotiation even to a vehicle. Away went Baker
ahead, showing a route which obviated the sudden rises,
and brought the party to the summit with less effort
than had appeared possible before the attempt had been
made. Before them swept the Darling Downs, prolific,
clothed thick in pastures, with plains interlocked
by timber belts. Behind stretched the coastal forests,
whilst on either side towered mighty heads, thrusting
skywards their dizzy summits for some 2,000 feet above
where the travellers stood.
The descent was duly negotiated, and the party
began a delightful journey through the rich and
luxuriant pastures, over some of the most prolific soil
yet found in Australia.
The development of the Darling Downs, and indeed
of south-western Queensland generally, henceforth
became more rapid. The fertility of the land, coupled
with its soundness for stock, soon became noised abroad.
The finding of a passage through the mountains for
straining teams and heavily laden drays had made access
to the coast the easier. Provisions could be obtained
the more readily and wool taken with less labour to the
seaboard than hitherto. The Darling Downs began its
rapid growth in industrial prosperity and general
well-being.
CHAPTER XI.
TRANSPORTATION.
The first penal settlement at Moreton Bay was
established in 1824. The officer in charge was Lieutenant
Miller, of the 40th Regiment, who had been sent from
Sydney in charge of prisoners. The site first used was
Red Cliff Point, which had been fixed upon for temporary
use by Oxley. The expedition sailed from Port Jackson
in September. The same year Captain Bishop took
command, and was succeeded by Captain Logan in 1825.
The horrors of penal servitude in other parts of
Australia were certainly repeated at Moreton Bay.
Persistent statements were made by men on the gallows
that desperation had driven them to murder as a means
whereby they might find relief in the forfeiture of their
own lives. It was in the penal days current statement
that the men would cast lots for cutting each other’s
throats in order to get rid of their own lives by being
hanged. The Commandant at Moreton Bay against whom
were made the most serious statements of treating the
prisoners with unnecessary and often barbarous cruelty
was Captain Logan.


There is no doubt that others in charge of the
settlement besides Captain Logan were guilty of a degree
of severity and brutality in dealing with prisoners which
would not be tolerated now in any British colony or by
any modern civilized community. But Moreton Bay,
with usually between 1,200 and 1,500 convicts at the
settlement at a time, was remote from other habitations
of white men, and the isolation was intensified by the
infrequency of visits by vessels from Sydney or elsewhere.
William Coote, in his unfortunately uncompleted
"History of Queens-
land,” estimates
that from April,
1836, until four
years later, the set-
tlement remained,
with one exception,
unvisited save by
prisoners and offi-
cials and small ves-
sels bringing the
necessary supplies,
and at a later
period by a few
who had obtained
permission to re-
side for purposes
of trade. The
surrounding coun-
try was peopled
by treacherous and
war-like tribes of
savages, whom, it
was commonly be-
lieved, were incited
to acts of plunder
and murder by the
influence of escaped
convicts, who pre-
ferred living among
the blacks to return-
ing to the horrors
of penal servitude.
Under circum-
stances such as
those, brutality
towards the convicts would arise not so much from a
natural hardness of heart as from the moral
deterioration bound to be produced among the ruling
class under such conditions of life as prevailed. Timidity
in administration necessarily would carry with it harsh-
ness verging on ferocity in punishing breaches of disci-
pline, and especially attempts at escape. Flogging was
common, toil at a treadmill was frequently imposed, and
the use of chains formed a common expedient for
keeping the prisoners in check. What would have
been the results of a more humane method of manage-
ment it would be futile now to speculate. Certainly
likely larger than that prevailing in any other Australian
the gangs contained their proportion of irreclaimable
and probably hereditary criminals —a proportion very
convict settlement. The influence of these men would
necessarily be all in the direction of hardening and
debasing those who, in different surroundings, might
have presented a more promising field for the efforts
of the reformer.
Perhaps the most
blameworthy factors
in the early policy
of administration
lay in the absence
of proper classifica-
tion of the con-
victs according to
character, record,
and crimes for
which they were
respectively con-
victed, coupled
with isolation of
the different types,
and in the absence
of such occupations
as, by employing
and as far as pos-
sible developing the
mental capacity of
the unfortunate
beings, might have
germinated and
stimulated the
growth of whatever
slumbering moral
attributes even the
worst of them
held beneath the
ill-effects of a per-
nicious early en-
vironment. Quite to
the contrary of what
would have been
at once the most successful and most humane method of
treatment, the prisoners were employed for long hours
at the most monotonous of manual toil, were guarded
in the closest confinement at night, and were cut off from
the uplifting influences which would have been derived
from literature by some of those among them able to
read. No interest in life was permitted to the convict
either in hours of work or of rest, whilst those holding
control themselves were exposed to the evils of a kind

of life which could not do other than exercise a pro-
gressively harmful influence on moral and mental traits.
Some illuminating lights are cast upon the penal
settlement by James Backhouse, a Quaker missionary and
also something of a naturalist, who in 1836 visited More-
ton Bay accompanied by his friend, George Washington
Walker, and who afterwards published a journal of his
observations, which, being long since out of print, is
not now readily accessible to the general reader. Re-
ferring to the absence of literature, Backhouse wrote:
“At Eagle Farm we again visited the female prisoners,
for whom a selection of tracts was left with the super-
intendent; they expressed thankfulness for them, being
very destitute of books, even of Bibles, which the
prisoners generally have not access to even on First-
days.” On another occasion Backhouse visited Eagle
Farm, which was then under the supervision of John S.
Parker, who resided with his wife in a small cottage.
Some seven hundred acres of land had been cleared by
male prisoners at a previous date, and the land had
been cultivated chiefly with maize. At the time when
Backhouse was at the settlement no male prisoners were
kept at Eagle Farm, a small number of females having
taken their places. The latter were “employed in field
labour during the day; they are kept in close confine-
ment during the night, and strictly watched during the
day. Yet it is found very difficult to preserve order
among them. The number of women at Eagle Farm is
now forty. Though these women are twice convicted,
and among them no doubt are some of the most depraved
of their sex, yet they received from us religious visits
with gladness. . . .” Elsewhere he expresses the belief
that, “as in most other cases, crime has been nursed by
strong drink, which has occasioned their re-conviction,
and some of them seem far from being properly sensible
of their miserable condition.” Some of the women were
very young. Seventy-one were confined in the main
penitentiary, and were employed at washing, needle-
work, picking oakum, and nursing.
At this time the treadmill was continually
used as a place of punishment. Backhouse describes it
as being generally worked by twenty-five prisoners at a
time. But when it was used as a means of special
punishment sixteen men were kept upon it for fourteen-
hour shifts, with only the interval of release afforded by
four being kept off at a time in succession. The men
are said to have greatly felt the strain of this at first,
but “notwithstanding the warmth of the climate they
became so far accustomed to the labour by long practice
as to bear the treadmill with comparatively little disgust
after working upon it for a considerable number of
days.” Backhouse found many of the convicts occupied
in landing cargoes of maize, or Indian corn, from a
field down the river, and others in divesting it of the
husks. The missionary, referring to what he saw when
inspecting these tasks being carried out, complains:
“To our regret, we heard an officer swearing at the men
and using other improper and exasperating language.
The practice is forbidden by the commandant, but it is
not uncommon, and in its effect is perhaps equally
hardening to those who are guilty of it and those who are
under them.” An extraordinary lack of all sense of pro-
portion is manifested by the protest at a practice which,
after all, the bulk of the prisoners must have been quite
as familiar with before transportation as afterwards, in
the face of the revolting cruelty and slow-drawn torture
so often shown to exist in the methods by which convict
settlements at that period were managed. Backhouse
mentions that at the time of his inspection the main
Moreton Bay prisoners’ barracks, though constructed to
accommodate 1,000 men, was occupied by only 311.
Backhouse was one of the few visitors to Moreton
Bay in convict days not biassed towards sympathy with
officialdom by plainly apparent personal motives. At
that time little in the nature of independent and healthy
criticism penetrated the dark wilderness which had
engulfed the hapless convicts, together with their
guards. But Backhouse, like most of the visitors,
assimilated and by acquiescence accepted the general
attitude of the Government officials, backed up as it was
by the opinion of very many of the free private colonists,
though the latter were clearly inspired with the desire
for cheap labour. Officials were autocratic in their
methods, and were fortified in their positions by the
knowledge that information of happenings at penal
settlements could reach the ears of higher authorities
only by channels controlled from the penal settlements
themselves. The free, unofficial section of the popula-
tion was bound to the officials by many social and poli-
tical bonds, the former being strengthened by the
isolated nature of the population to an extent long
since passed away. Very many of the early free
settlers of Australia generally either displayed an
apathetic lack of interest towards the convict system
or else were ready to accept the barbarities, so far as
they knew them to exist, of the settlements as an evil
inseparable from the prevention of crime in the countries
from which the prisoners were drawn. That the latter
attitude was adopted by many people otherwise of a
generous character is rendered abundantly manifest by
the writings of such men as Backhouse —men who, while
ready to devote their lives to the welfare of others, yet
failed to see the quite unnecessary horrors grafted on
to the convict system by the prejudice, ignorance, and
fear displayed by so many of the officials sent to Aus-
tralian shores with autocratic powers, and sent from
Sydney to Moreton Bay holding powers of life and death
over chained gangs of their fellow-beings. Of all human
activities probably the last to show signs of a developing
civilization has been the suppression of crime and the


treatment of breakers of laws. The doctrines of advanced
contemporary penologists show that there still remains a
primitive savagery even in twentieth-century gaol ad-
ministration. The critic of to-day, therefore, with the
advantage of a broadened Christianity and nearly a
hundred years of added psychical research, may very
easily unduly blame missionaries and other compara-
tively independent people of the thirties and earlier who,
unconsciously biassed by all the forces of usage and
accepted standards, failed to see, in what we now believe
to be their true light, methods which debased and
brutalized the old-time convicts, at the same time carry-
ing danger to the lives of warders and officials who so
actively stirred the hatred of the abandoned wretches
with everything in life worth living for irretrievably
discipline. When leaving Moreton Bay the little vessel
conveying the missionary and his companions back to
Sydney was temporarily prevented by contrary winds
and rough sea from putting out upon the ocean. The
party landed upon Amity Point, being rowed ashore by
convicts. April had not passed, and the weather was
oppressively hot. The passengers thereupon took com-
passion upon the crew, who were perspiring freely at
their oars beneath a glaring sun. Handkerchiefs were
passed to the straining men, and Backhouse writes;
“Though prisoners they may be allowed to wipe per-
spiration from their faces with them, but so strict is the
discipline that they would not be allowed to tie them
round their necks. . . . Some of the soldiers
and prisoners applied for tracts, which they received

lost to them. Missionaries, naturalists, and others likely
to write records of their observations, for the most part
visited the early penal settlements in no critical frame
of mind, and it is not to the records they left which
the historian must search for enlightenment as to the
practices carried on at the penitentiaries. On the
other hand, the officials themselves took all the care
possible that such information should be safeguarded,
and when the convict settlement was broken up at
Moreton Bay all the records which might have thrown
light upon the previous management were carefully
removed.
However, the writings of Backhouse, who certainly
was no hostile critic of the authorities, contain odd
statements illustrative of the senseless severity of the
gratefully along with a few books—including Testaments.
They were very destitute of books, the only Bible I
heard of at the station belonging to the pilot.”
The same writer’s description of his voyage from
Sydney to Brisbane, made during the previous March,
yields a tale pregnant with its suggestion of the intense
suffering which must have been borne by the unfor-
tunate convicts. The excursion was made on the sailing
ship “Isabella,” of 126 tons burden. On this small
craft were crowded 44 prisoners, a guard of 15 soldiers,
a sergeant, two corporals, the wife of a soldier, 16 of a
crew, including the master (James Boyle) and the mate
(Joseph Moffat), together with Backhouse and his com-
panion (G. W. Walker), making a total of 78 people.
Backhouse writes;—“l went among the prisoners, who


were secured in a forehold by chains from ankle to
ankle, above which passed a long chain, bolted at each
end to the deck, so as only to allow them to move a few
feet. . . . These men were very clean when they
came on board, and their prison was fresh whitewashed,
so as to make it as comfortable as such a place could be
to men fastened on a chain, without blanket or other
bedding, on the bare boards. Most of the prisoners
looked pale from seasickness, not being allowed to come
on deck, for since the attempt at mutiny on board the
‘Governor Phillip’ about a year ago, which occurred
when a chain of the kind described above was opened
for the purpose of taking off a few prisoners to let them
have air on deck, the captains of these vessels, for their
own safety, have kept the prisoners constantly below.”
Backhouse, during the voyage, entered the hold to
preach to the prisoners, but says his companion was
unable to accompany him. The reason for this incapa-
city is mad© evident from a subsequent passage in the
journal, which describes the conditions in the interior
of the ship in the following words:—“The rolling of the
vessel and the warmth of the weather have made the
prisoners look very sickly; many of them hardly attempt
to sit up.” Under these dreadful conditions the voyage
was made in five days, which, with the ships then
used, must be regarded as a fast passage. And
this experience was not uncommon. The prisoners were
being conveyed in the customary method.
A general reluctance has been displayed by
recorders of early Australian events towards dwelling
on the conditions prevailing at the penal establishments.
The tendency has lain not in the direction of distorting
facts so much as of passing hastily over the period con-
stituting so deep a blot on the story of British coloniza-
tion, and it was left, not to an historian, but to Marcus
Clarke, the novelist, to give the only graphic and sub-
stantially the most accurate and complete picture of a
phase of the conditions incidental to the transportation
system. Coote, a skilled and accurate selector and com-
piler of the records of colonization, whom death, unfor-
tunately for the State, overtook before he had finished
his excellently-begun “History of Queensland,” in
commenting on the settlement destined to form the
nucleus of the city of Brisbane, writes:—“l have seen
one book of memoranda, by which it would seem from
the kind and quantity of tailoring and cobbling
recorded, that the higher class of officials were not
unmindful of the value of an economically supplied
wardrobe; in fact, from all I can learn, the prisoners,
when not employed on such cultivation as was indispens-
able, were generally engaged in the most useless possible
avocations. As to moral improvement, w© may judge
of the effort made towards it by the good Quaker’s
(Backhouse) narrative. When the formality of an
official religious instruction was omitted, books almost
unknown, and all labour reduced to a mere mechanical
routine of the simplest and dullest kind, it is not to be
wondered at that the criminal became desperately
wicked, the simple idiotic, and the active mad. They
who emerged from that slough fit for the association of
the ordinary society of a civilized community deserve
far greater credit than most of their one-time gaolers,
for such an escape must be regarded as in direct oppo-
sition to the inevitable influences of the system those
gaolers were appointed to and did encourage and
enforce.”
Again, the same authority writes:—“l have heard
narratives of punishment so ingenious in their refine-
ment of torture that I am almost disinclined to give
credence to the facts they embodied, and yet from the
general concurrence of testimony can hardly refuse
assent. And, moreover, statements of the kind involve
a citation of authority—a citation in most cases from
the evidence of sufferers, and therefore in these days
almost as grievous as the original infliction. It seems
almost indispensable to abstain from particular instances
although the general conclusions I have derived are
exceedingly unfavourable to the commandants of the
day.” And again:—“That from 1824 to 1839 Moreton
Bay must have been a place of torment to every con-
scientious man of right feeling in it can scarcely be
doubted, when we consider the facts, as to either
Government or convicts, which have been allowed to
escape from the dark secrecy at first enforced to conceal
still darker deeds, and since acquiesced in from a sense
of common disgrace.”
Following upon the discovery by Allan Cunningham
of the overland route from Moreton Bay to the Darling
Downs and the interior of south-western Queensland
came the declaration of Brisbane as a free settlement
on May 4, 1842. Another development for which
the colony was indebted to the same explorer was the
opening of overland connection between Brisbane and
the Upper Hunter River. The transportation of
prisoners to Flew South Wales was discontinued in 1840,
but no criminals were sent to Brisbane after 1839, whilst
on May 5 of that year all the convicts were sent away
from the latter settlement, except those few without
whom necessary work could not be carried on. The
task of clearing away the traces of the penal establish-
ment had been commenced by Lieutenant Gorman, then
the Commandant, in 1839, whilst the survey of the city
and its environs was commenced during the same year.
The removal of the convict settlement from Moreton
Bay was met with general satisfaction. The authorities,
indeed, had themselves grown sick of the place. It was
far from headquarters, and the physical features of the
surrounding country made the possibility of escapes very
great. This was emphasized by the comparatively large
number of men who actually did get clear away into


the unexplored wilds, some of them to live hermit-like
lives in the silent interior, whilst others took up with
the blacks. The treatment of these unfortunate people
was such that they would prefer death to returning to
their former captors.
The news that Moreton Bay was to be thrown open
created no small stir in Sydney, and the Hunter River
Steam Navigation Company arranged to put on a
steamer to start from Port Jackson for Brisbane on
February 18. On March 19 following the same company
sent the “Shamrock” on the voyage. Among the
passengers were the Governor (Sir George Gipps) and
several high officials. The object of the vice-regal visit
was to officially proclaim Moreton Bay a free settlement,
as had occurred in the case of Port Macquarie before.
At that time shipping could not easily proceed up
the river to Brisbane because of the bar stretching
Bay a free settlement took place, and the “Shamrock”
returned to Sydney on the 30th.
As late as 1856 the people of Moreton Bay in particu-
lar, and of New South Wales in general, became greatly
alarmed at a rumour that what is now Queensland was
about to be separated from New South Wales for the
purpose of reviving transportation to the former territory.
On the motion of Mr. (afterwards Sir) Henry Parkes the
following resolutions were carried without division :
“1. That this house, with feelings of sincere and
unmingled gratitude recognizes in the act of Her Most
Gracious Majesty, by which the transportation of
British criminals to these Australian Colonies was made
to cease and determine, the concession of a great and
complete measure of justice which was sought by the
unanimous prayers of the colonists, and has been pro-
ductive of general and permanent satisfaction.

across its mouth. An agitation was on foot to move the
headquarters to Cleveland Point, which juts out into
the bay. The Governor was asked to decide the knotty
problem; and at his request the party was taken to
Cleveland before approaching Brisbane. It was found
that so low and shelving was the shore that dry land
could be reached only by walking a considerable distance.
Nor was that nearly the worst. As soon as the boat
was left the landing party found themselves floundering
deep not on a clear sandy bottom but in black mud.
The chances of Cleveland being selected as the position
of what was to become the capital of the future Queens-
land had been completely smashed by the effort at
landing in a low instead of a high tide. Brisbane hence-
forth remained the chief centre of the settlement. On
the 28th inst. the official ceremony of declaring Moreton
“2. That in the opinion of this House the com-
pliance of Her Most Gracious Majesty with the prayers
of the colonists in the settlement of a question so long
agitated, while it has confirmed the feelings of loyalty
and attachment to the Mother Country, which happily
exists in these communities, has led to the most bene-
ficial results, in their improved social condition, and
their rapid progress in political character and commer-
cial prosperity.
“3. That in the opinion of this House any steps on
the part of Her Majesty’s Government to revive the
transportation of convicts to the northern portion of
New South Wales, or to any part of eastern Australia,
or the islands adjacent, would be regarded as a breach
of faith by the colonists, would create universal dis-
content and lead to consequences greatly to be deplored.


“4. That the foregoing resolutions be embodied in
an address to the Governor-General, with a request that
His Excellency will be pleased to transmit them to the
Principal Secretary of State to Her Majesty.”
Some years before these resolutions were passed
transportation to the Australian colonies had been
wholly ceased. This was the result of colonial public
feeling. The vast majority of the population was
opposed to the system under which Great Britain
dumped her criminals into this new and fruitful land.
A small minority was of a contrary belief, but so
obviously self-interested was their attitude that it
carried but little weight. The class which held this
opinion was composed of employers desiring cheaper
labour. With the discovery of gold in the southern
States great scarcity of workmen threatened to cripple
all industry except mining, and the dearth of shepherds
represented a very big problem for pastoralists to face.
But the movement in favour of abolishing the transpor-
tation system had started long before the gold rushes
began. Happily the rumour ended in nothing material
being done to alter the existing state of affairs.
The Legislative Council of New South Wales in
July, 1839, received a despatch from Lord Glenelg,
Secretary of State, intimating the concurrence of the
Imperial Government in the colonial view as to the
expediency of discontinuing the assignment of male
convicts, as a step towards the entire discontinuance of
assignment throughout the colony at as early a period
as practicable.
Each year the desire of the colonists to have trans-
portation terminated grew more vigorous, and was more
persistently expressed. For a long while the Imperial
Government appeared to be inclined to continue sending
convicts to these shores whether they were wanted or
not. However, before the gold rush broke out the
anti-transportation movement had created so lively a
public sentiment regarding the matter that the end was
won. Yet in October of 1846 the Legislature of New
South Wales received a despatch from Mr. Gladstone,
who was then Secretary of State for the Colonies, stating
the intention of the Government of Great Britain not to
alter the practice of transportation to New South Wales
so far as New South Wales was concerned, without the
general approval of the colony or the portion of it affected
by such alteration. At the same time, while the Govern-
ment desired to lessen the number of convicts yearly sent
to Van Diemen Land (Tasmania), it was disposed to
doubt whether the absolute exclusion of transported
convicts from New South Wales should continue. The
Home Government sympathized with the impatience of
the colonists of New South Wales under the system
which prevailed there some years ago, and could well
understand that the recurrence of that system, the
resumption of transportation on a scale even faintly
resembling the former one 5> must be regarded with a
just jealousy and alarm.
As a result of this despatch the Legislature, on
October 13, in accordance with a motion from Mr.
Wentworth, resolved upon the appointment of a Select
Committee to consider the issues raised and to report
to the House. Meanwhile public opinion had been
aroused to a high pitch of excitement. Many meetings
were held, and on the 13th of the same month numbers
of petitions were presented to Parliament. They came
from most of the important provincial centres of popu-
lation, as well as from the capital itself. At one of the
gatherings held at the latter a resolution was adopted,
and Avas embodied in one of the petitions, setting forth:
—“That this meeting has heard with the deepest feeling
of alarm and regret that it is proposed to renew the
system of transportation to this colony, and they cannot
conceive any circumstances under which such a measure
was justifiable.” Some 7,000 signatures were attached
to this petition. On the 31st of the same month, the
day following the presentation of the petitions and
eighteen days after its own appointment, the Select
Committee brought in its report. Considering the state
of the public mind, expressed so emphatically during the
same month and the well-known hatred of the
great bulk of the people to the transportation system,
the finding of the Committee constituted a remarkable
document, tacitly concurring with the despatch of the
Secretary of State and contemptuously disregarding the
colonial sentiment.
It carried recommendations that an equal number
of female and male convicts should be transported, that
free immigration be fostered simultaneously, and that
there be no aggregation of convicts in masses.
Naturally a report of this character increased the
alarm which already had swept the country. People
began to feel that they were abandoned by their own
representatives in what ranked among the dearest of
their collective aspirations—that of ridding the colony
of the name it had earned as a dumping-ground
for the worst criminals of the United Kingdom,
besides other serious evils which the system had intro-
duced, such as the introduction of many of the most
undesirable hereditary traits. But the good sense of the
Legislative Council ultimately corrected the harm done
by the Select Committee, and the following motions
moved by Mr. Cowper were carried in September, 1847,
by eleven votes to seven :
“(1) That this Council disapproves of the prin-
ciples avowed and recommendations contained
in the Report of the Select Committee
appointed to inquire into and report upon
the Despatch of the Rt. Hon. the Secretary
of State for the Colonies to Governor Sir
Charles Fitzroy, dated April 30, 1846,


respecting the renewal of transportation to
this colony; and desires to record the
expression of its opinion that a return to the
system of transportation and assignment
would be opposed to the wishes of this com-
munity, and would also be most injurious to
the moral, social, and political advancement
of the colony.
“(2) That an address be presented to His Excel-
lency the Governor, transmitting a copy of
the above resolution, and respectfully
requesting that His Excellency will be
pleased to forward the same to the Rt. Hon.
the Secretary of State for the Colonies, for
the information of Her Majesty’s Govern-
ment.”
In March, 1848, the Legislative Council received a
despatch from Earl Grey, the Secretary of State for the
Colonies, setting out terms on which the Imperial
Government would be prepared to send exiles and
ticket-of-leave holders, who would be followed subse-
quently by their wives and children, and by an equal
number of emigrants, to New South Wales at the
expense of the British Treasury.
On April 1 the House carried a resolution announc-
ing a willingness to co-operate with the British Govern-
ment in the scheme of reformative discipline which had
been outlined, and in the suggestion that the colony
should receive the people named. But it was urged that
greater success would be more likely to be attained by
the exiles being accompanied rather than followed by
their families.
On May 22 a despatch was received from Earl Grey
stating that in consequence of the resolutions passed
by the Legislature of New South Wales in September,
1847, no change would be made in the existing arrange-
ments of transportation. A second despatch from the
same source enclosed the copy of a despatch received
by the Secretary of State from the members of the
employing class in Sydney, and alleging a great scarcity
of labour in the colony. The petitioners asked for the
resumption of transportation on the lines laid down in
Mr. Gladstone’s despatch of 1846. A third despatch,
received on the same day as the others, dealt with the
question of ticket-of-leave men and those holding
conditional pardons. These, of course, constituted quite
a different class to the real convicts. The latter were
congregated together and worked in gangs under the
eye of overseers. But the holders of tickets of leave and
of conditional pardon were more of the character of
free men in all but the matter of returning to the
United Kingdom, which was forbidden. In the
document referred to, Earl Grey stated that he had first
thought the idea of sending exiles to New South Wales
would have to be abandoned, because of the condition
that an equal number of free emigrants must be sent
at the expense of the Imperial Government. Recon-
sideration, however, had led him to believe that the
colonists would prefer receiving a moderate number of
convicted persons to the entire abandonment of the
system. He therefore proposed that the Order-in-
Council by which New South Wales was declared no
longer a place for receiving convicts under sentence for
transportation should be abolished.
No sooner had the contents of these documents
been revealed than a storm of public protest swept
the country like a wave of flame. The Anti-Transpor-
tation Committee formed the centre of effort which was
to be directed in opposition to what appeared the
determination of the Imperial Government, and a few
of the large employers among the colonists, to bring back
the evils of the past. The committee organized an
immense meeting, from which a petition was presented
to the Legislative Council, representing the duty and
determination of the colonists by every legal and
constitutional means to oppose the revival of transpor-
tation in whatever form it should appear. Nor was
this the only protest from the people. Meetings were
held on the subject in almost every centre of settlement
throughout the colony. Nor did Parliament on this
occasion speak with any uncertain voice. The following
resolution was carried on the voices, no division being
called for :
“That a humble address be presented to Her
Majesty, respectfully setting forth that this
Council, having maturely considered the
despatch from the Rt. Hon. the Secretary of
State for the Colonies, dated September 3,
1848, declined to accede to the proposal
therein contained for the renewal of trans-
portation to this colony, and strongly
protests against the adoption of any measure
by which the colony would be degraded into
a penal settlement. That this Council,
therefore, would earnestly entreat Her
Majesty to be graciously pleased to revoke
the Order-in-Council by which this colony
has again been made a place to which
British offenders may be transported.”
Meanwhile public feeling had been generating to a
white heat. It happened that only ten days after the
Legislature had passed the resolution just quoted, the
ship “Hashemy” arrived from England with 212 male
convicts on board. This created a storm of indignation
that appeared likely to put the loyalty of the young
colony towards the Motherland to a severe test. The
convicts appeared to have been thrust upon the settle-
ment in spite of the deliberately and frequently


expressed sentiments both of the people themselves and
of their constitutional representatives in the local
Legislature. On the arrival of the ship an immense
meeting of 5,000 persons assembled in unfavourable
weather at Circular Quay. Mr. Robert Campbell
presided. Resolutions were carried solemnly protesting
against the landing of the convicts, and requesting the
local Government to send back the prisoners, if necessary
at the colony’s own expense. A deputation then waited
on the Governor in connection with the matter; but it
was unsuccessful in attaining its object, being informed
that deputations could not be received without previous
notice of their visit having been given. A week later a
second meeting was held. This time a petition was
drawn up, asking for the dismissal of Earl Grey and
asserting that the differences between the sentiments of
the Governor and the opinions of the people had
demonstrated the necessity for Responsible Government
being estabilshed for the colony.
The Legislative Council’s address of June 1, 1849,
was replied to in a despatch from Earl Grey, which
reached the Council on June 11, 1850. The Secretary
of State for the Colonies had displayed an unfortunately
obstinate determination to oppose the will of the
colonists in a matter which could hardly fail to raise
the bitterest of antagonism. The despatch began with
an explanation of the class of convicts sent. That was
calculated to go but a short distance towards allaying
the indignation of the colonists at the Imperial
Government having sent any prisoners in the teeth of
the oft-repeated protests. Earl Grey then pointed out
that the convicts had been sent in conformity with the
arrangement approved by the Legislative Council in
April, 1848. It had been determined that no more
convicts would be sent to New South Wales while the
colonists objected, but the Government had considered
the revoking of the Order-in-Council naming New
South Wales as a place to which convicts might be sent
as unnecessary till it should clearly appear that the
Legislature had deliberately adopted, as its final con-
clusion, a determination that no more convicts ought
under any conditions to be sent to any part of the
colony.
Then followed the portion of the despatch most
likely to arouse the anger of the people living in New
South Wales, with their future bound up in the welfare
of the colony. Earl Grey continued that as it appeared
that convicts were more needed and would be more
willingly received at Moreton Bay than in the other
districts, for the present they would be sent thither. Of
course, the Moreton Bay district at that time formed
portion of New South Wales. The despatch was full
of self-contradiction. It appeared that in spite of one
profession to the contrary, the Imperial Government
was determined to send convicts to some one or other
part of the colony. This view was corroborated by a
later despatch received on July 14, from the same
source. This document announced that independently
of immigrants sent into New South Wales and paid for
from colonial funds, Moreton Bay would be entitled to
have not less than two ships sent to it with free
immigrants, introduced at the expense of Great Britain,
in consideration of the number of ticket-of-leave men
sent to the same settlement. The immediate dispatch of
the two ships was also announced. On the receipt of
this communication the Legislative Council, without a
division being called for, passed the following resolu-
tions on the voices :
“(1) That since the year 1836 the Land Fund,
amounting to £ 1,179,000, has been expended
under the direction of Her Majesty’s
Government, in relieving Great Britain of a
portion of her distressed population, in all
78,500 souls, comprehending 27,700 adult
labourers.
“(2) That this revenue has, for the same pur-
pose, been charged as a debt of <£loo,ooo.
“(3) That although this expenditure has been
beneficial in some respects, it has exhausted
the means of obtaining that continuous
supply of labour which the colonists most
urgently require, while advantages have
been derived from this outlay by Great
Britain, by whom no part of the expense
has been borne.
“(4) That during the whole of this period the
colonists were justly entitled to the adminis-
tration of their own Land Fund, and that
if such power had not been withheld from
them they might have procured contribution
towards the cost of emigration from Her
Majesty’s Government, or the over-populous
parishes of England, Ireland, and Scotland.
“(5) That it is no part of the duty of the colonists
to pay for the importation of emigrants, nor
to receive criminals; and that the same
principles of sound policy which have
induced Her Majesty’s Government to give
compensation by way of free labour for the
introduction of exiles entitle the colonists
to expect that the same amount of Imperial
funds shall be expended in the introduction
of free labour into New South Wales which
has been disbursed for this purpose out of
the colonial revenue.
“(6) That these resolutions be embodied in a
humble address to the Queen, and that the
Governor be requested to transmit the same
to the Rt. Hon. the Secretary of State for
the Colonies.”


On the 30th of the following month a further series
of resolutions was moved in the Legislative Council,
and was passed after several amendments had been
either negatived or withdrawn. This was adopted
partly in response to the request from the Imperial
Government for a final declaration of the colonial view
regarding transportation. Two of the motions read as
follows:
"(1) That a humble address be presented to Tier
Majesty, respectfully setting forth (with
reference to the despatch of the Rt. Hon.
the Secretary of State for the Colonies to
His Excellency Sir Charles A. Fitzroy,
dated November 16), that this Council
These resolutions were transmitted to the Imperial
Government with a request that what was asked for
should be acceded to “with the least possible delay.”
Meanwhile a section of landholders, particularly in
that part of New South Wales which after separation
became the southern portion of Queensland, had
determined to leave no stone unturned to secure and
retain a supply of cheap convict labour. Probably the
efforts of these pastoral pioneers would have been still
more strenuous had they known all the ordinary industry
of Australia to be on the verge of a labour famine, when
flocks and herds were to be deserted by shepherds and
stockmen, when ships were to be stranded in ports for
lack of crews, and when work everywhere was to be

adopts as its final conclusion that no more
convicts ought under any conditions to be
sent to any part of this colony.
“(2) That as there can be no security for the
social and political tranquillity of the
colony until the convict question is set at
rest, this Council humbly repeats the prayer
which was contained in an address to Her
Majesty from this Council dated June 1,
1849, viz. : ‘That Her Majesty will be
graciously pleased to revoke the Order-in-
Council by which this colony has been again
made a place to which British offenders may
be transported.’ ”
brought to a standstill because of most of the population
having flocked to the newly-discovered goldfields. New
population was destined to pour into the south at the
rate of a quarter of a million per annum, and
to be sucked up in the mining rushes as soon as it
arrived. These stirring times had not begun when the
squatters of northern New South Wales entered upon a
campaign in support of the transportation system. Their
efforts took the form of two petitions forwarded through
the Governor to the Imperial authorities, praying for
the continuance of the inflow of prisoners.
In October of 1851 the Legislative Council received
despatches from the Secretary of State. The first was
in reply to the petitions favouring transportation. Earl
j2


Grey announced his willingness to comply with the
request put before him : but the Government was not
prepared to act in opposition to the desires of the
Colonial Legislature. If, however, the Legislative
Council cared to alter its opinion, requesting that
convicts in limited numbers should be sent to the
northern district, he did not know why it should not
be done.
The other despatch received at the same time was
in reply to the resolutions passed by the Council, and
which have been already quoted. The document stated
that Her Majesty would be advised at an early
opportunity to revoke the existing Order-in-Council
declaring New South Wales a place to receive convicts.
But if the new Legislature of New South Wales,
after the separation of Victoria, should adopt the
view in favour of transportation which had been
given expression to by the squatters in the north, or if
in order bo procure prison labour for themselves, the
northern district of New South Wales should apply for
a further division of the colony, then another Order-
in-Council might be substituted limiting the districts
to which convicts might be sent to those areas where
their services might be required.
The effect of the latter of these despatches was for
the Legislative Council to reaffirm the former decision
“that no more convicts ought under any conditions to
be sent to any part of this colony.” The Council also
pointed out, in a series of resolutions which it carried,
that as productive goldfields had recently been dis-
covered, added weight would be given to the objections
against transportation. On December 10 the Legisla-
tive Council received a copy of a despatch from the
Secretary of State revoking the Order-in-Council
appointing New South Wales as a place to which
convicts might be sent.
When the pending separation of the Moreton Bay
district of New South Wales and its formation into a new
colony assumed increasingly concrete form, a fear sprang
up throughout the general bulk of the community that
the step was being taken as a means to revive transpor-
tation to the northern region. The feeling against the
system had increased rather than diminished in intensity
as time had worn on. The belief that the year 1841
might not have seen the last of the transported felons
arriving in the settlement on the Brisbane River
extended into the Parliament in Sydney; and in
November, 1857, a number of resolutions dealing with
the matter passed the Assembly on the motion of Mr.
(afterwards Sir) Henry Parkes without division. The
principal of these was :
“That in the opinion of this House any steps on
the part of Her Majesty’s Government to
revive transportation to the northern portion
of New South Wales, or to any part of
Eastern Australia or the islands adjacent,
would be regarded as a breach of faith by
the colonists, would create universal discon-
tent, and lead to consequences greatly to be
deplored.”
Fortunately, transportation was not revived; and
the Colony of Queensland, neither before nor after
becoming separated from New South Wales, has never
again been the dumping-ground of convicts from across
the seas. Brisbane had seen the last of the bad old
order of things in 1841.
CHAPTER XII.
DAWN OF DEVELOPMENT.
The beginnings of the separation of Queensland from
New South Wales date from 1825, when Van Diemen
Land was created a State, and Queensland given separate
representation in the Parliament at Sydney. Ten years
later a slice was cut off eastern Australia, and was
termed South Australia. For many years the main part
of the continent remained in the hands of the Govern-
ment of Western Australia, whilst a narrow, though
much more fertile and better watered strip of territory
lay under the jurisdiction of the authorities at Sydney.
What may still be regarded as the natural boundary
of the south of Queensland was indicated by Sir Thomas
Mitchell, then Surveyor-General of New South Wales.
This famous explorer showed how a remarkable line of
demarkation in soil and flora lay at the twenty-fifth
parallel. He proposed to call the country to the north
of the tropic “Capricorn!a.” Under this suggestion, a
colony between “Capricornia” and New South Wales
would thus possess 350 miles of coastline.
The story of the separation of Queensland from
New South Wales is not a plain narrative of a move-
ment growing steadily to full maturity. While a
considerable section of those living to the north of what
is now the boundary between the two States were
altogether in favour of a separate seat of Government
being set up north of Sydney, there were settlers in
the same area of quite different opinions. Particularly
among the latter was a class of people who feared that
separation was desired only as a forerunner to the
establishment of convict labour in the Morebon Bay


country. Very many of the large landholders still
entertained anything but friendly feelings towards the
abolition of the convict, whose labour was so much
cheaper to the employer than was that of the free
worker. This latter question formed the bitterest
political warfare of the time.
In the very early days life in the Moreton Bay
district was full of dangers and difficulty. To the north of
Moreton Bay, which is about sixty miles long and twenty
wide, and is bounded on the east by three islands, lies
Fraser Island, stretching for about sixty-five miles along
the coast, and having an average breadth of ten miles.
In the early days Fraser Island was infested with savage
blacks. The number of natives was estimated at no
less than 2,000. The island receives its name through
Captain Fraser, of the ship "Sterling,” being wrecked
at the entrance between the island and the mainland,
and as soon as he reached dry land on the island being
slaughtered. It was considered that the comparatively
large population subsisted mainly from fishing, the
surrounding waters being infested with life, whereas the
soil is of a poor description. These workers in the far
north of Australia experienced darker dangers than
were met by the settlers in the southern States, where
the natives were neither so numerous nor so hostile.
An interesting examination was made of the neigh-
bourhood of Port Curtis by Captain Flinders. Portion
of that explorer’s own account is worth quoting in his
own words: "This part of the east coast,” he says,
"had been passed in the night by Captain Cook, so that
both the openings escaped his notice, and the discovery
fell to our lot. In honour of Admiral Sir B. Roger
Curtis, who had command at the Cape of Good Hope,
and been so attentive to our wants, I gave it the name
of Port Curtis, and the island which protects it from
the sea, in fact, forms the port, was called Facing
Island. It is a strip of rather low land, eight miles in
length and from two to half a mile in breadth, having
Gatcombe Head for its southern extremity. The
northern extremity to Port Curtis is accessible only to
boats, but ships of any size may enter the port by the
south opening.”
The same locality was visited by Mr. Oxley in 1823,
when he was in search for the site for a penal establish-
ment. This voyage was described by Mr. Uniacke, a
scientist who accompanied the explorer, but who died
soon after his return to Sydney. Referring to Port
Curtis, Mr. Uniscke observes: "On arrival on board the
ship, the master reported that he had discovered a fine
fresh-water stream emptying itself by an outlet which
was visible astern of the vessel to the southward. From
his account Mr. Oxley was induced to defer our
departure to Port Bowen for another day in order to
have an opportunity of viewing it himself. Accordingly
he and Mr. Sterling started early the next day, while
I remained behind to collect specimens of minerals on
Facing Island for the Governor. Late in the evening
they returned, having proceeded up the river to about
where the tide reached, and Mr. Oxley deemed it of
sufficient interest to remain three or four days in order
to examine the country more minutely. Accordingly the
next morning early we again left the vessel, taking three
days’ provisions, and proceeded with our boat about
twelve miles up the river, where w© pitched our tent on
a bank about 40 feet above the level of the water. The
soil was of the richest description, and calculated to
grow cotton, sugar, indigo, and all other Indian
productions. There were, however, marks of the flood
having reached at least fifteen feet higher than the level
of our encampment, owing to which the whole surface
was covered about two inches deep with drift sand.
Indeed, the floods here in the rainy seasons must be
tremendous, as we observed in many of the trees, at
least sixty feet above the level of the water, the remains
which had been deposited by successive inundations.
On the banks we saw three or four different kinds of
timber, but the small quantity rendered them unimpor-
tant. The river was covered with multitudes of teals,
widgeons, and wild ducks, and on the banks I shot two
swamp pheasants (a pretty black bird, not unlike the
English pheasant in shape), and a very beautiful
species of small deer not known in Sydney. Shortly
after dinner we proposed to get to rest, with an intention
of proceeding farther up the river at a very early hour
next morning. We turned out the moment it was light,
dispatched our breakfast, and getting into the boat, pro-
ceeded about six miles further up the river. The
country which we passed this day was similar to what
we had seen on the day before. The timber, however,
was becoming larger and more plentiful. In many
places the right bank of the river was composed of a
remarkably fine slate, while the left was a hard, close-
grained, grey granite, and the soil everywhere rich and
fertile. Before we returned we ascended a high hill,
on the left of which was a beautiful and extensive view
for many miles through a rich brush country, the banks
in many parts being clothed with timber. To the river
we discovered here Mr. Oxley gave the name of
the Boyne.”
A glowing description was given of the surrounding
district; and the people of New South Wales learned
that another and prolific province was included within
their wide-flung borders.
In the early thirties, and indeed until the abolition
of the convict system, the penal establishment effectually
held up the populating of the country, as well as its
industrial development. Private persons were not
allowed to approach to within fifty miles of the prisons;
and, with the exception of what Allan Cunningham had
discovered of the country to the west of the main ranges


of mountains, nothing was known of the country outside
the Moreton Bay district. To make the utmost use of
the convicts was therefore the only means, in any way
approaching adequacy, to give to the territory any
compensation for having to maintain the stigma
of keeping the criminals. Yet at Moreton Bay
nothing useful or successful appeared ever to be
accomplished by the prison labour. No substantial
permanent works, such as necessary wharves or lasting
public buildings, were erected. The prisoners should
have been used to perform such functions as would have
laid the foundations of private settlement and private
enterprise. But that course was not followed. In his
book on Queensland, Dr. Lang points out: “(1) The
overseers had a small allowance for every acre of land
cleared by the convicts under their superintendence. To
render the source of revenue more productive, it was
only necessary to select thinly-timbered land, without
reference to its quality; and accordingly Moreton
Island, a mere collection of sandhills, of no use what-
ever for cultivation and but thinly covered with cypress
pine trees, was cleared by the convicts. The timber,
which would now have been very valuable for orna-
mental furniture, was in the meantime destroyed. (2) A
wharf or jetty for lading and unlading vessels was
constructed at considerable expense, at least of convict
labour, towards the mouth of the Brisbane River, on the
Government establishment of “Eagle” Farm; but after
it was completed it was discovered that there was a
mud flat or sandbank between the wharf and the deep
water, which effectually prevented any vessel from
getting up to it. (3) A swamp on the Brisbane River,
near Brisbane, was drained at a very considerable
expense, under the idea that it would be well adapted
for the growth of rice, and the superintendent had it
sown accordingly; but instead of sowing the grain in its
natural state of paddy, it was sown in its manufactured
state of rice, procured for the purpose from a merchant’s
store in Sydney. It was much the sa-me as if
an English farmer had sown his field with pearl barley.
Of course, the settlement was pronounced unsuited far
the cultivation of rice.” Under management of this
kind, it is easily to be seen that the eastern side of
Australia held districts which on the only evidence
available had attractions greatly superior to those
presented in reports of the Moreton Bay territory.
James Backhouse, in the diary relating to his visit
to the Moreton Bay settlement in 1836, about two years
before the establishment of the station of German mis-
sionaries, which was introduced as a result of the efforts
of T)r. Lang, gives the following brief description of the
infant town of Brisbane, as it appeared then to him:
“Brisbane town is prettily situated on the rising
north bank of the river, which is navigable fifty miles
further up for small sloops, and has some fine cleared
and cultivated land on the south bank, opposite the
town. Adjacent to the Government House, and on the
same side as the town, is the Commandant’s garden and
twenty-two acres of Government garden, for the growth
of sweet potatoes, pumpkins, cabbages, and other vege-
tables for the prisoners. Bananas of two varieties grow
here in abundance. The best flavoured goes under the
name of plantains. It is full of seeds, and is not the plan-
tain of many other countries. Grapes, guavas, pineapples,
citrons, lemons, shaddocks, etc., thrive luxuriantly in
the open ground, the climate being nearly tropical.
Sugar-cane is grown for fencing, and there are a few
thriving young coffee plants, but not old enough to bear
for two or three years, if they survive transplanting.
The bamboo and Spanish reed have been introduced;
the former attains to about 70 feet in length, the upper
20 feet bending down with a most graceful curve.
Coffee and sugar will probably at some period be culti-
vated here as crops. The surrounding country is undu-
lating and covered with trees. To the west is a range
of high woody hills, distant in a direct line five miles.”

Major Sir Hamilton John Goold-Adams, G.C.M.G., C.B. March, 1915 (still in office)
SIR GEORGE FERGUSON BOWEN, G.C.M.G. (1859-1868).
The first Governor to be appointed to the infant
colony of Queensland was Sir George Ferguson Bowen,
who was born in Ireland in 1821. Sir George Bowen
was the son of the Rev. Edward
Bowen, and was educated at the
Charterhouse School and at Trin-
ity College. At an early age the
future governor became conspicu-
ous by reason of his literary
attainments. Among his works
which attracted widespread atten-
tion were “Ithaca in 1850’’ and
“Mount Athos, Thessaly, and
Epirus.” When thirty-six years
of age Sir George Bowen was
appointed President of the Uni-
versity of Corfu, which position
he held for four years. He then
became Chief Secretary, and
remained at that post until 1859,
the year when he accepted
the Governorship of Queensland.
Three years previously Sir George
Bowen had married Countess
Roma, the daughter of Count
Roma, who was President of
the Senate. Sir George Bowen was enthusiastically
received by the people of the newly-constituted
colony, and he quickly gained in popularity. But
unfortunately his eight years of office were destined
not to pass without unhappy incidents. A wave of
depression swept the colony during the early sixties.
The cause of this setback lay in
no single factor; but in many
quarters the Governor was blamed
for what was happening. Very
much of the hostile criticism was
certainly quite unjustified, and
there now is no doubt that misfor-
tunes over which he could have
exercised no control were laid at
his door. The high degree of com-
petence possessed by Sir George
and the high estimate in which
he was held by the Imperial
Government were made manifest
by the career of that gentleman
after leaving Queensland shores.
In 1867 he was appointed to the
Governorship of New Zealand, a
position which he held for five
years. During that term he
enjoyed the utmost popularity,
and his departure was met
with universal regret. In 1872
Sir George Bowen assumed the Governorship of Vic-
toria, then the most populous and important of the
Australasian colonies. On taking up his new duties
GOVERNOR BOWEN.


he received a highly-complimentary despatch from the
Imperial Government. He spent several years in Vic-
toria, and when leaving was appointed Governor of
Mauritius. During his term of office in Victoria Sir
George Bowen displayed considerable ability, and his
departure was keenly regretted.
COLONEL SAMUEL WENSLEY BLACKALL (1868-1871).
Colonel Samuel Wensley
Blackall, who was Governor of
Queensland from August, 1868,
to January, 1871, was born in
Ireland on May 1, 1809. He was
the eldest son of Major Robert
Blackall, H.E., 1.C.5., of Colam-
ber Manor, in the County of
Longford. The future Governor
of the young colony graduated at
Trinity College, Dublin, taking
his degree as Doctor of Law in
1833. He served in the 85th
Light Infantry, afterwards be-
coming major in the Longford
Militia and subsequently honor-
ary colonel in the Leitrim Militia.
Colonel Blackall was elected to
the House of Commons by the
constituency of Longford, and
held his seat for three years. He
was at another period High
Sheriff for Longford and for
Tyrone in 1861. Colonel Blackall
accepted the Lieutenant-Governor-
ship of Dominica in 1851, a post
which he retained until 1857.
In 1862 he became Governor
of Sierra Leone and in 1865
Governor-in-Chief of West Afri-
can Settlements. Two years later
he vacated the latter appointment
and in 1868 became Governor of
Queensland, in succession to Sir
George Bowen. Colonel Blackall
died at Brisbane on January 2,
1871, and was buried there. The
deceased Governor had married
twice. His first wife, whom he
married in 1833, was Georgina,
the daughter of Henry Rowles,
of London. His second wife was
Kate, the daughter of James
Bond. The last-named lady died
in 1864, after sixteen years of
married life.
GOVERNOR BLACKALL.
MARQUIS OF NORMANBY (1871-1874).
The Marquis of Normanby,
George Augustus Constantine
Phipps, was the third of Queens-
land’s Governors. He arrived at
Brisbane in August, 1871, and
departed in November, 1874.
Born in 1819, the early period of
his career was devoted to the
army. He entered the Coldstream
Guards as ensign, and when nine-
teen years of age became lieuten-
ant. In 1844 he married the
daughter of Captain Russell,
R.N., and the same year was
appointed deputy-lieutenant of
Yorkshire. Three years later he
entered the House of Commons
as member for Scarborough,
voluntarily resigning after four
years in order to accept the office
of Comptroller of the Queen’s
Household. Two years later the
Marquis was appointed Treasurer
of the Queen’s Household. In
1858 he became Governor of Nova
Scotia. In 1863 his father died
and he succeeded to the peerage ;
but not till three years later did
he deliver his maiden speech
in the House of Lords, when
he moved the adoption of the
Address-in-Reply to the Throne.
Five years later he came
to Queensland. In his Aus-
tralasian career the Marquis of
Normanby followed in the foot-
steps of Sir George Bowen, the
first Queensland Governor. The
first appointment of each was
as Governor of Queensland; each
left Queensland in order to be-
come Governor of New Zealand ;
and each became Governor of
New Zealand. The Marquis was
appointed to New Zealand in
1875 and to Victoria in 1879.
MARQUIS OF NORMANBY.


WILLIAM WELLINGTON CAIRNS, C.M.G. (1876-1877).
Sir William Wellington Cairns, C.M.G., was the
fourth Governor of Queensland, being appointed in 1874
and holding office until 1877. Few colonial Governors
have had so wide and varied
an experience of oversea Imperial
matters as that gathered by Sir
William Cairns. At a time when
the nation was most in need
of capable administrators and
officials to work on the outposts
of Empire, the future Governor
of Queensland was throwing him-
self into the service of his country
with whole-souled ardour. The
son of Mr. W. Cairns, owner of
estates in Ireland, he was born in
1828. His father was the younger
brother of Lord Cairns, Lord
Chancellor of England.
Before he had passed from
his teens Sir William had decided
upon a career of activity in the
more distant parts of the British
dominions, and when only twenty
years of age he proceeded to the
East. Four years later he was
twelve months later was made Lieutenant-Governor
of Malacca. The latter position, however, he retained
for only a year, as in 1868 he was appointed
Lieutenant-Governor of St. Chris-
topher, Nevis, and Anguilla, in
the West Indies. Two years later
he was promoted to British Hon-
duras, where he remained for
four years. In 1874 further
advancement was made by Sir
William Cairns, who in that year
became Lieutenant-Governor of
Trinidad. But very soon after
receiving this last-named appoint-
ment failing health compelled
him first to obtain leave of
absence and then to resign. The
same year he was offered and
accepted the Governorship of
Queensland.
In 1877, when leaving
Queensland, Sir William Cairns
accepted the Governorship of
South Australia, but bad health
again asserted itself, and the
same year he was compelled
GOVERNOR CAIRNS.
appointed a writer in the Civil Service of Ceylon.
For the next fourteen years he continued this
occupation, but in 1866 he visited England, and some
to sail for his native country. In 1877 he received
the honour of K.C.M.G. in recognition of his services
to the Empire.
SIR ARTHUR EDWARD KENNEDY, G.C.M.G., C.B. (1877-1883)
The fifth Governor of Queens-
land was Sir Arthur Edward
Kennedy, G.C.M.G., C. 8., who
had enjoyed a long and brilliant
career before coming to these
shores.
Sir Arthur was descended
from the ancient Scottish family
of Kennedys, at the head of which
was the Earl of Cassilis. Sir
Arthur, who was born in 1809,
was the third son of Hugh Ken-
nedy, of Culha, in County Down,
Ireland. The future Governor of
Queensland was educated at Trin-
ity College, Dublin, and when
eighteen years of age he entered
the army, becoming ensign in the
11th regiment. In 1832 he was
made a lieutenant, and in 1840
he became captain in the 68th
Light Infantry. Eight years later
he retired from the army. In
1846 he had been selected, though
at the time serving in the army,
to fill the position of county
inspector under the Board of
Works. He afterwards became
relief commissioner and subse-
quently inspector of poor-laws
until the latter office was abolished
in 1851.
After Captain Kennedy left
the army he entered the Colonial
Department of the Civil Ser-
vice, where he speedily rose to
an important position, being
appointed Governor and Com-
mander-in-Chief of Vancouver
Island and its dependencies in
GOVERNOR KENNEDY.


British North America. In 1854 he became Governor
of Western Australia, a post he held for eight years to
the satisfaction both of the colonists and the Imperial
authorities. Indeed, so highly did the latter appreciate
his services that as a mark of Queen Victoria’s approval
he was knighted on August 23, 1867.
The following year he left Australian shores to
assume the office of Governor and Commander-in-Chief
of the British Possessions in West Africa. Sir Arthur
Kennedy’s next move was in consequence of having been
appointed Judge at Sierra Leone in the Courts of
Mixed Commission with Foreign Powers for the
suppression of the slave trade. In 1872 he became
Governor of Hongkong, which office he retained for
five years.
Sir Arthur Kennedy took up his duties as Governor
of Queensland during April, 1877, and he held office
until May, 1883.
SIR ANTHONY MUSGRAVE, G.C.M.G. (1883-1888).
Sir Anthony Musgrave, who
arrived in Queensland during
November, 1883, was the son of
Anthony Musgrave, M.D., of the
Island of Antigua, and was
born in 1828. In 1850 he was
appointed private secretary to
Mr. Mackenzie when the latter
was Governor-in-Chief of the Lee-
ward Islands. A year later young
Musgrave entered as a student of
the Inner Temple, but he was
never called to the Bar. In
1852 he was appointed treasury
accountant at Antigua, and two
years afterwards assumed the
office of colonial secretary at the
same place.
Sir Anthony’s busy colonial
life brought many changes of
scene, and in 1860 he became
Administrator at Nevis, and six
months later at St. Vincent. He
was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of the latter place
in May of 1862. Two years later he became Governor
of Newfoundland, and in Janu-
ary, 1869, he filled a similar posi-
tion in British Columbia. In 1872
he became Lieutenant-Governor
of Natal, in 1873 Governor of
South Australia, and in 1877
Governor-General and Captain-
General of Jamaica. Sir Anthony
was made C.M.G. in 1871 and
K.C.M.G. in 1875. In 1854 he
married Christiana Elizabeth, the
daughter of the Hon. Sir William
Ryan, of Antigua. Five years
after marriage the lady died. The
future Governor of Queensland
afterwards married Jeannie
Lucinda, the daughter of David
Dudley Field, of New York.
While in occupation of the posi-
tions of Governor and Commander-
in-Chief in Queensland Sir
Anthony died in October, 1888.
He had then been five years all
but a month in the colony. He was the author of
“Studies in Political Economy” and several pamphlets.
GOVERNOR MUSGRAVE.
SIR HENRY WYLIE NORMAN, G.C.B., G.C.M.G., C.I.E. (1889-1895).
Of Governors of Queensland, Sir Henry Wylie
Norman, who reached the colony as representative of
Queen Victoria in May, 1889, and held office for six
years, was certainly one of the most distinguished.
Born in 1826, the future governor was the son of James
Norman, who led a seafaring life for many years, but
afterwards settled down to commercial pursuits in Cuba,
where he married Charlotte Wylie. James Norman
died at Havana in 1853, but he was survived by his
widow till 1902.
Henry Norman started his career with but few
advantages, his subsequent progress being due to a keen
brain and strong character. After some little schooling,
which left but the slenderest of education, he joined
his father at Calcutta when sixteen years old, being
then consumed with a keen desire for a life on the sea.
For a while, however, he had to content himself with
such clerical work as he could find. But the spirit of
adventure was destined to be not long curbed, and on
March 1, 1844, he secured appointment as a cadet in


the infantry of the Bengal Army. The following month
he joined the Ist Bengal Native Infantry as ensign.
With a splendid enthusiasm, of which in those stormy
days the Indian Empire stood much in need, the young
officer threw himself heart and soul into the profession
of arms. While on active service the number of his
escapes from death formed the subject of comment
among his brother officers. At the outset of his career
the attention of Earl Roberts was attracted by his
“extraordinary memory’’ and his “natural liking and
aptitude for work.’’ Norman was almost continuously
on active service in India for some years, and he
rapidly rose in rank, being an undaunted worker, not
only at practical undertakings on the field but also at
such studies as were necessary to more than make up
for the defects in his early education. Few young
officers have left the memory of so
brilliant a career; but, says a
biographer, “his reward lagged
because his years were fewer
than his services.” By 1859 he
had been mentioned twenty-three
times in despatches. On August
16, 1859, he became C.B. In
1863 he was appointed A.D.C.
to Queen Victoria, which honour
he retained until 1869, when he
was promoted to major-general.
In 1859 Norman returned to
England much worn in health by
the exceeding activity of more
than a decade of campaigning.
He was warmly welcomed in the
mother country, and during the
following year was appointed
assistant military secretary to the
Duke of Cambridge; but a year
later he was ordered back to India
to take part in the great scheme
of army reorganization then going on in that part of the
Empire. From then on Norman turned his attention
more to civil administration than to military service, and
what the army lost colonial government gained. In 1862
Norman was appointed first secretary in the military
department of the Government of India, a position
he retained for a little over eight years. During
the seven years following he was a member of the
Council of the Governor-General of India, where he
displayed a high standard of diplomatic skill. He was
made K.C.B. in 1873, and was promoted to lieutenant-
general in October, 1877. Five months later he was
appointed a member of the Council of India. In 1882
he became general, and was sent to Egypt to settle
various complicated problems which had cropped up
there. In 1883 he became Governor of Jamaica, and
for service rendered in that country he received the
G.C.M.G. in 1887, the same year as he was decorated
with the G.C.B. for military service. The next post
Norman filled was that of Governor of Queensland, to
which colony he came under unusual circumstances.
In describing Sir Henry Norman’s appointment to
the vice-regal position in Queensland, “The Dictionary
of National Biography’’ states: —“In 1889 he dis-
interestedly accepted the Governorship of Queensland
in order to relieve the home Government of a difficulty
caused by the unpopular appointment of Sir Henry
Blake.” In Queensland quiet times succeeded to angry
constitutional controversies. The colony was, however,
soon involved in financial troubles, and Norman showed
his public spirit in offering to share in the reduction of
salary to which the members of the Legislative Assembly
had to submit. The responsible
Minister freely sought his advice,
and when he retired, after the
close of 1895, Mr. Chamberlain
expressed high appreciation of
the Governor’s long and valuable
services.
Sir Henry Norman’s active
career far from ended on his
departure from Southern shores.
While in Queensland he was
offered the post of Governor-
General of India, on the death of
Lord Lansdowne. This position
Norman accepted, though he was
then 67 years of age. However,
he found the excitement and
worry attached to the responsi-
bilities too great for his physical
strength to cope with, and a few
days later he withdrew his accept-
ance, to the regret of Lord Kim-
berley, the Secretary of State for
India, by whom Norman had been approached, through
Lord Ripon, Secretary of State for the Colonies. This
was in 1893. On his return to England the ex-governor
undertook and successfully discharged a large number
of public functions. During the latter end of 1896 he
was appointed President of a Royal Commission con-
stituted to investigate the conditions of sugar-growing
colonies. In pursuing these inquiries Sir Henry found
it necessary to cruise round the islands, an occupation
well suited to his personal liking. In 1901 he was
appointed Governor of Chelsea Hospital, and on June 26,
1902, he was raised to the rank of field-marshal. During
the following year he took part in the South African
War Commission. But at that time his health was
fast failing, and on October 26, 1904, he died, being
buried with full military honours at Brompton Cemetery.
GOVERNOR NORMAN.


Sir Henry Norman married Selina Elia, daughter
of Dr. A. Davidson, in 1853. That lady died in 1862
at Calcutta, leaving four daughters and one son, Henry
Alexander. The latter died in childhood. In 1864
Sir Henry married Jemima Anne, the daughter of
Captain Knowles, but during the following year the
husband was again left a widower. In 1870 he married
a third time, being united to Alice Claudine, the
daughter of Teignmouth Sandys, of the Bengal civil
service. By the last marriage there were one daughter
and two sons, Walter and Claude, both of whom entered
the army.
LORD LAMINGTON, G.C.M.G. (1896-1901).
Lord Lamington, the second
baron (created 1880) (Charles
Wallace Alexander Napier Coch-
rane Bailley, G.C.M.G., cr.
1900; G.C.1.E., cr. 1903; D.L..
J.P., 8.A., F.R.G.S., lieutenant-
colonel in the Lanarkshire Yeo-
manry), was Governor of Queens-
land from April, 1896, to 1901.
He was born on July 29, 1860,
being the son of the first baron,
who had married Annabella, the
daughter of Andrew Robert
Drummond and the grand-daugh-
ter of the fifth Duke of Rutland.
The future Governor of Queens-
land was educated at Eton and
at Christchurch, Oxford, where
he took the degree of Bachelor of
Arts. During the parts of 1885
and the following year he acted
as assistant private secretary to
the Marquis of Salisbury, that
statesman at the time mentioned being Prime Minister
of England. Lord Lamington was elected to the House
of Commons for St. Pancras in
1886, and he held the seat four
years. After relinquishing poli-
tics Lord Lamington set out on
travels, and portions of 1890 and
the following year he occupied in
a journey from Siam to Tonquin.
In 1895 Lord Lamington was
appointed Governor of Queens-
land, though not until April of
the following year did he arrive
in the colony to take up his new
duties. He departed about five
years later, amidst the general
regret of the community, among
whom both he and Lady
Lamington had become deservedly
popular. Two years after leaving
Australia the ex-Governor of
Queensland was appointed to a
similar vice-regal position in Bom-
bay, where he remained until
1897. Lord Lamington owns about
12,000 acres of freehold property in England. His heir
is his son, the Hon. Victor A. W. B. Cochrane Bailley.
LORD LAMINGTON.
SIR HERBERT CHARLES CHERMSIDE, G.C.M.G., C.B. (1902-1904).
Among colonial Governors who abandoned active
and successful military careers for the more peaceful
occupation of civil administration ranks Sir Herbert
Charles Chermside, G.C.M.G., K.C.M.G., C.M.G.,
C. 8., who arrived in Queensland as the official repre-
sentative of the Crown in March of 1902 and left during
1904.
Sir Herbert Chermside was born at Wilton, near
Salisbury, on July 31, 1850, and was the second son of
the Rev. Seymour Chermside and the grandson of Sir
Robert Chermside, In 1899 he married Geraldine
Webb, of Newstead Abbey. There was cne child, a
daughter, born of the marriage in 1910. Sir Herbert
was educated at Eton, and he entered the army in 1868.
Two years later he became lieutenant in the Royal
Engineers, and during 1882 he was promoted to the
rank of captain and then of major. Three years
later, and again in 1887 he received further advance-
ment. In 1898 he was raised to the rank of major-
general. During portions of 1877 and the subsequent
year he held the position of military attache in the
Turko-Russian War; in 1878-9 he was engaged in duties
relating to Turkey; and from 1879 to 1882 he held the
post of military vice-consul at Anatolia. Immediately
after leaving the last-named post, Sir Herbert joined the
Egyptian Expedition of that year and he was awarded
a medal in recognition of the services he rendered.
From 1883 to 1888 he served in the Egyptian Army,


during the latter portion of the period being in the
Soudan and forming a member of the Suakin expedi-
tions during 1884 and 1885.
These years represented a busy
and responsible period in the
life of Sir Herbert. For two
years, beginning in 1884, he was
Governor-General of the Red Sea
Littoral, and from 1886 to 1888
he was commanding the forces on
the Egyptian Nile frontier. He
was in command in action at Sar-
ras. In 1888-9 he held an office as
consul, and during the latter year
he became military attache at Con-
stantinople, a post he retained for
seven years. From 1896 until
1899 he held the post of British
military commissioner and com-
mander of the British troops in
Crete. From the last-mentioned
year until some twelve months
later he acted as commander
of the Curragh district. In the South African war
he commanded the Third Division.
Thus after active and strenu-
ous years, during which arduous
military service was mixed with
responsible administrative duties,
Sir Herbert Chermside brought
to Queensland the kind of repu-
tation most likely to gain for
him the admiration and good-
will of a community themselves
engaged upon the Empire-
building task of founding
a new and important por-
tion of the British dominions.
The record of his term of office
on Australian soil shows that as
a Governor in a land far removed
from the theatres of military
strife Sir Herbert was able to
succeed to an extent no less
marked than he already had done
in the profession of arms.
GOVERNOR GHERMSIDE.
LORD CHELMSFORD, K.C.M.G. (1905-1909)
Lord Chelmsford was the tenth Governor of Queens-
land and the third member of his family to hold the
title, which was created in 1858. He was born
on August 12, 1868, and was the son of the second
Baron Chelmsford, who had mar-
ried Adria Fanny, the eldest
daughter of Major-General Heath,
of the Bombay Army. The future
Governor of Queensland was edu-
cated at Winchester College and
at Magdalene College, Oxford,
where he took his B.A. degree,
which he followed up in 1892 by
taking his M.A. He also gradu-
ated in law and became a barrister
by profession. From 1892 to 1899
he was a Fellow of All Saints’ Col-
lege. At an early age Lord Chelms-
ford took a keen interest in public
affairs, and in 1900 he became a
member of the London School
Board, a body exercising a deep
and wide influence over a large
educational field. He remained
attached to that authority until
legislative machine in any part of the world. A year
later he was forced to sever his connection with the muni-
cipal life of the capital of the United Kingdom on
account of accepting an appointment to come to Australia
as representative of the King.
However, in 1913, on his return
to London, Lord Chelmsford be-
came an alderman of that city.
Lord Chelmsford was about
four years Governor of Queens-
land, leaving the northern State
in 1909, when he assumed a simi-
lar position in New South Wales.
The latter appointment he re-
tained until 1913, at which date
he returned to England. In 1894
he married the Hon. Frances
Charlotte Guest, the daughter of
the first Baron Wimborne. Two
sons and four daughters were born
of the marriage. Lord Chelms-
ford, whose full family name is
Frederick Jolin Napier Thesiger,
was decorated with the dis-
tinctions of K.C.M.G. in 1906
LORD CHELMSFORD.
1904, when he became a member of the London County
Council, an institution more intimately touching the
lives of some millions of people than does any other
and G.C.M.G. in 1912. He is a Knight of Grace of St.
John of Jerusalem in England and Chancellor of the
Order of St. Michael and St. George.


SIR WILLIAM MACGREGOR, G.C.M.G., C.B. (1909-1914).
Rarely has so large a measure of spontaneous good
feeling gone out from the people of an Australian State
to the official representative of the Sovereign as that
which expressed itself in regret at the departure from
Queensland of the Right Plon. Sir William MacGregor
in 1914 after that gentleman had filled the position of
State Governor for five years. Sir William was the eldest
son of John MacGregor, and was born in Scotland in
1847. In 1883 he married Mary, the daughter of R.
Backs. One son and three daughters resulted from the
marriage.
In the early years of his life Sir William followed
the profession of medicine, and among the positions
he held in that connection was that of resident
surgeon and resident physician at the Glasgow
Royal Infirmary and resident doctor at the Royal
Lunatic Asylum, Aberdeen. He
was appointed assistant Govern-
ment medical officer at Seychelles
in 1873, surgeon at the Civil
Hospital, Port Louis, Mauritius,
in 1874, and chief medical officer
at Fiji in 1875. From the early
eighties onwards Sir William
turned his attention increasingly
to functions of civil administra-
tion on the outlying parts of
the Empire. He became receiver-
general and administrator of the
Government and acting - high
commissioner and consul-general
for the Western Pacific, adminis-
trator of British New Guinea in
1888, and lieutenant-governor of
the same possession in 1895;
Governor of Lagos in 1899 and
Governor of Newfoundland in
1904. The latter post he retained until 1905, when
he left the Northern Hemisphere to assume an analogous
position in Queensland.
Among the distinctions with which Sir William
was honoured were: K.C.M.G. in 1889, C.B. in 1897,
and G.C.M.G. in 1907. He became a Privy Councillor
in 1914, and he holds many honorary and other Univer-
sity degrees. Among these are Hon. D.Sc., Camb.;
M.D., Aber.; Plon. LL.D., Edin.; LL.D., Aber.;
F.F.P.S., Glasgow. He is a Fellow of the Royal
Geographical Societies of England and Scotland and of
the Royal Anthropological Society of Italy. He holds
the Albert Medal (second class) and the Clarke Gold
Medal for saving life at sea. He attained the Watson
Gbld Medal in 1872, and also the Founders’ Medal of
the Royal Geographical Society of England, as well as
the Mary Kingslay Medal.
To Sir William fell the distinction of declaring the
sovereignty of Queen Victoria over British New Guinea
on September 4, in the year 1888. At the Coronation
of His Majesty King Edward in 1902. Sir William
officially represented the West African Colonies and
Protectorates.
While in Queensland Sir William identified himself
intimately with the local University, which was estab-
lished during his term of office. The inauguration of
the University of Queensland took place on December
10, 1909, in the presence of a large and distinguished
audience, the ceremony passing off with great eclat.
Following his departure from the State a number
of prominent Brisbane and country residents interested
in education inaugurated a move-
ment to establish a medical school
to perpetuate, in connection with
the main Queensland seat of
learning, the memory of the
departed Governor. But the
European War broke out at
that time, and all thoughts of
collecting substantial voluntary
subscriptions not connected with
the struggle on the opposite side
of the globe had to be indefinitely
postponed. But the popularity of
the late Governor was amply
demonstrated by the enthusiasm
with which the public received
the project and by what appeared
to be its assured success until the
public thought became clouded
with the tragic events following
the first few days of August, 1914.
Although well advanced in years, Sir William never
wearied of traversing the wide State of Queensland and
thereby obtaining a first-hand knowledge of its far-
scattered people and its many and varied resources. In
gathering facts about the State’s needs and possibilities,
the Governor was materially aided by the familiarity
with principles of natural science which he had gained
in studying and practising medicine. Nor were the
people slow to recognize the strenuousness with which
the representative of the Crown was performing his
duties. His popularity rapidly spread through the
influences of his visits to remote bush centres, and the
last few weeks of his residence in Brisbane were filled
with a long round of functions expressive of appreciation
of his late work and regret at his departure.
GOVERNOR MACGREGOR.


MAJOR SIR HAMILTON JOHN GOOLD-ADAMS, G.C.M.G., C.B.
(March, 1915 —still in office).
Major Sir Hamilton John Goold-Adams, G.C.M.G.,
C. 8., the twelfth Governor of Queensland, was born
in County Cork,. Ireland, on March 15, 1858, his father
being the late R. W. Goold-Adams, of that county,
where also his ancestors had been settled for several
generations. He received his education in his native
place, and chose as a vocation the Imperial Army, in
due course being appointed to the Royal Scots Fusiliers.
At twenty years of age he had risen to the rank of
lieutenant, and six years later proceeded to South
Africa, where he served under Sir Charles Warren in
the Bechuanaland Expedition. In
1885 he was gazetted to a cap-
taincy, in August of that year
being appointed commanding
officer of the Bechuanaland Bor-
der Police. He was again com-
mandant in 1888, and in the
following year received promotion
to his majority. In 1893 he took
command of the field force
operations against the Matabele
tribe, and for his services in this
campaign was presented with the
Matabele medal.
Subsequently he acted as
Resident Commissioner of the
Bechuanaland Protectorate, which
post he held until 1895. He
served for practically the whole
of the duration of the war
between the British and the
Boers, and received the honour
of being mentioned in despatches.
Sir Hamilton holds the South
African medal with clasps, the conspicuous part played
by him in the defence of Mafeking, on the occasion of the
memorable seige of that town, entitling him to signal
credit. In January, 1901, he was appointed Deputy
Administrator of Orange River Colony, became
Lieutenant-Governor in August of the same year, and
in 1907 Governor of the colony, which office he held
until 1910. He was appointed High Commissioner of
Cyprus in 1911, and on November 5, 1914, formally
annexed the island on behalf of the British Crown,
to which it had been ceded by treaty many years
previously.
Sir Hamilton’s appointment to the Governorship
of Queensland was gazetted at the close of 1914, and
on March 15, 1915, he made his advent to the State
which was to be the scene of his future administration.
He was immediately installed in office, the oath being
administered by the Chief Justice, Sir Pope Cooper,
and from the first he demonstrated his ability to cope
with the unusual difficulties in legislation and states-
manship brought about by the conditions resulting on
the unprecedented conflict of
Nations inaugurated in Europe
in August, 1914. Prior to his
arrival, Sir Hamilton already
had established his reputation as
a tactician and diplomat, and
throughout the stirring times
that followed his installation he
maintained his grip of the public
esteem which was accorded him
immediately following his appear-
ance on Queensland soil, and
achieved a measure of popu-
larity which he has since
retained.
In 1894 Sir Hamilton had
conferred upon him by Her late
Majesty Queen Victoria the
Order of C.M.G., and this
honour was followed by that of
C.B. four years later. The fur-
ther distinction of K.C.M.G.
became his in 1902, and in
1907 he was created Grand
Commander of the Order of St. Michael and St.
George.
In 1911 Sir Hamilton celebrated his marriage with
Elsie, youngest daughter of Mr. Charles Riordan, of
Montreal, Canada, and of this union there is issue one
son. Lady Goold-Adams has evinced great zeal and
energy in promoting patriotic work among the women of
Queensland, and in every respect has demonstrated her-
self a true supporter and sympathizer with all forms of
worthy philanthropic effort.
GOVERNOR GOOLD-ADAMS.


Pastoral.
Though each year the industries of Queensland
become more diversified in character, and the area of
country devoted to cattle, sheep, agriculture, etc.,
considerably enlarged, the pastoral enterprise still holds
its premier position, and is the largest contributor to the
State’s sources of wealth and production. In the earliest
days of Queensland settlement no other business of any
considerable magnitude competed with that of the
grazier in attracting the attention or the capital of the
early colonist. Each year now brings its fresh steps
towards a more complex industrial life, and as the State
develops so does it become more self-contained. But the
sheepbreeder and the cattle-raiser are destined for many
years to control the basis upon which most of the
prosperity of the general community ultimately rests.
GENESIS IN QUEENSLAND.
Owing to its geographical features and the natural
difficulties cutting off its vast and fertile interior from
the first Australian centres of colonization, Queensland
remained the last to draw to its untried poten-
tialities the pioneer stockraisers who spent the first half
of the last century in pushing their industry over the
most productive parts of the State.
The pastoral possibilities of the interior were not
to be made known through the medium of the settlement
at Moreton Bay. At the back of that embryo town lay
heavily-timbered land and some open plains. The latter,
however, were covered with a class of grass that, when
unstocked, appeared too coarse to provide suitable feed
for sheep, or even cattle. The land, moreover, was
mostly hilly, and much of it was exceedingly wild. The
blacks were numerous and warlike. As compared with
the wide, open plains, or lightly-timbered country of
New South Wales, where stock might easily be mustered,
and over which transit was met with comparatively few
natural difficulties, the Moreton Bay district seemed to
offer a minimum of success from a maximum of effort,
and to deserve but little early attention from a pastoral
viewpoint. It is true that behind the ranges lay the
prolific Darling Downs. But not until 1827 had the
Darling Downs been discovered; and then they were
reached by Allan Cunningham, who had proceeded from
Sydney and not from Moreton Bay. Till after that date
the mountains had baffled all efforts to cross them.
Thirteen years later the first pastoralisb to enter upon
what now is Queensland marked the site for his home-
stead on the Darling Downs. This pioneer was Patrick
Leslie, a personal friend of Cunningham, who had heard
from the great explorer of the possibilities of the new
territory to the north. At that date a considerable area
of New South Wales had been stocked, and the pastoral
industry in the south and the west of the Murray was
already extending beyond the experimental stage.
The actual beginnings of the pastoral enterprise,
which in 1840 began to overflow into Queensland, dates
from 1788, when Governor Phillip landed 7 horses, 7
head of cattle, and 29 sheep at Port Jackson. By the
year 1800 the latter had increased to 6,124, and the
cattle to 1,044. But before the close of the eighteenth
century steps were being taken to lay the foundations
of the Australian wool-producing industry. The pioneer
of this movement was Captain Macarthur, who was
convinced of the suitability of the soil, pastures, and
climate of Australia to the evolution of a high type
of wool-producing sheep. He started with some ewes
from India, but the progeny of these were quickly
raised in standard by the use of three valuable Spanish
merinos secured from South Africa. The flock thus
established was evolved by artificial selection. Macarthur
proved to be a born stock-breeder. He set out with one
ideal. He desired a type which would yield considerable
fleeces of high-quality wool. Considerations of carcass he
treated as of secondary importance. He saw that the
sheepbreeder, if the industry were to attain to large
dimensions, must look for his remuneration to the export
of wool and not to the sale of surplus stock in a meat
market dependent for its demand on the slender needs
of the colonial population. In 1803 Macarthur took some
bales of his wool to England, where it created consider-
able attention, the supply reaching Great Britain at that
time being exceedingly limited and prices ruling very
high. Indeed, four years later a bale of Macarthur’s
wool sold at 10s. 6d. per lb. In 1804 Macarthur bought
seven rams and a ewe from the Kew stud flock belonging
to King George 111. These had been bred from
merinos of the negretti variety, which had formed
portion of a present to King George from the King of
Spain. The negrettis possessed those characteristics which
Mr. Macarthur most desired to implant into his Aus-
tralian flock. They were thick set, hardy sheep, very
densely covered with bright wool of a fine, high-quality


fibre. Macarthur, before returning to southern shores,
obtained the promise of the grant of such lands “as
would enable him to extend his flocks in such a degree
as may promise to supply a sufficiency of animal food
for the colony as well as a lucrative article of export
for the support of our manufactures at home.” Not until
after Wentworth and others had crossed the Blue
Mountains in 1813, however, was the merino destined
to show the real development to which it was capable
under Australian skies. Once having traversed the
ranges dividing the interior from the coastal watersheds,
the sheep improved so rapidly and altered so completely
that new types began to be evolved. Macarthur died
in 1834, but his widow continued his policy of breeding,
and not until 1858 was the flock dispersed. Most of
the Tasmanian studs were founded on stock obtained
from the first of successful Australian sheep-breeders.
The surplus from Tasmania soon found a ready market
handicap. In addition, the cost of carriage proved
enormous, and it had to be borne solely by the pioneer-
ing pastoralist himself, whether it was for his wool in
transit to a port or for stores being carted to the station.
Moreover, in the first days of pastoral occupation, little
was known of contending against the drought menace.
The possibilities of artesian boring had not been tested;
and even the excavating of adequate storage tanks
involved the expenditure of considerable capital, as well
as of labour, of which perhaps neither was available in
remote places.
In the early sixties the substantial testing of the
possibilities of the west took place, and results
proved that both climate and pastures had exceeded
the most sanguine expectations. Cattle and sheep
stations were founded in great numbers, the Govern-
ment, after 1869, giving 21-year leases to settlers who
would stock the holdings to the extent of twenty-five

in Victoria, which was attracting the energies of
pioneering pastoralists long before the gold discovery
in 1851.
The first daring spirits, who pushed out with their
flocks and herds determined to found homes and estab-
lish a new industry in the great silent wilds of
Queensland, met with little of the reward which by
reason of the services they were rendering to subsequent
generations rightly should have been theirs. New South
Wales was settled from a common centre which was a
port. But Queensland was being settled from New
South Wales; and graziers in the latter territory often
were cut off by many hundreds of miles from any outlet
for produce. While one clip was being shorn from the
backs of the sheep sometimes the previous clip would not
have reached a market. To men with little capital the
long wait for monetary returns thus imposed a severe
sheep or five head of cattle to the square mile. Great
fortunes appeared to loom out of the immediate future.
Unfortunately these expectations were not realized in
the years immediately following. The west of
Queensland had been subject to a boom. In their haste
to get there, pastoralists had bought inferior sheep;
they had borrowed money at too high a rate of interest;
they had miscalculated the cost of transport; and the
labour troubles awaiting them in the unpeopled heart
of the continent presented an unexpected handicap. On
the whole, those who had devoted their land to cattle
met with more speedy success than did those who
had stocked their holdings with sheep. Many of the
latter fought adversity for long, strenuous years,
and then had to leave the back country, into
which had been sunk all their worldly possessions. It
was left to their successors to make the desert blossom.


In the seventies a further change took place.
Capital from Victoria and New South Wales was in
need of fresh outlets. This money was mostly held by the
big landowners of the two southern States. Squatters of
this description had accumulated fortunes from proper-
ties in the western district of Victoria, the Riverina dis-
trict of New South Wales, and other well-established and
prosperous areas. Surplus wealth they desired to
invest in pastoral enterprise, as that was the business
which they understood, and which had already yielded
to them so bounteously of its fruits. With the abund-
ance of money thus becoming available new methods
rapidly evolved, or rather, southern methods began to
be extensively applied in Queensland. Substantial efforts
were made at efficient water conservation; whilst the
wasteful and primitive practice of shepherding sheep
was abandoned, the runs being enclosed with wire fences.
The fencing of runs and their subsequent subdivision
into paddocks, enormous as those divisions usually were,
rendered practical the heavier stocking of the land,
and it was found that the more heavily the land was
stocked the better it became from the grazier’s view-
point, for the pasturage became less coarse, whilst the
tramping of many feet backwards and forwards as
flocks and herds swept over the runs in search of food
served to harden the surface of the ground in such a
manner that rain more quickly ran off it into the con-
servation tanks, and the creeks ran more readily
after each considerable fall. Means of transport were
continually improving; and the Government was follow-
ing an enterprising policy of pushing developmental
railway lines into the back country. In addition to these
benefits a marked rise took place in the price of wool
during 1873, and higher rates were then reached than
had been obtained for years before. For the following
nineteen years the pastoral industry grew and flourished
—a source of wealth to the State and a well from which
many private fortunes were drawn. In 1902 the State
was enveloped in the clutches of the most disastrous
drought experienced since pastoral occupation had first
begun. This period of misfortune will be returned to
later in this article.
PASTORAL LIFE.
Pastoral life in Queensland, along with that in the
other States of the Commonwealth, has passed through
three distinct eras since the first station homestead was
planted in the then little known wilderness and the first
flock of sheep was gathered at night into the rudely-
constructed yard, whilst the shepherd, whose function
it was to guard them each day, slept in his humble hut
near by, his dogs close at hand.
At its beginnings, the life of the Queensland
pastoralist was filled with strenuous endeavour and real
danger to life and limb, whilst none of the comforts
and conveniences now to be found at every homestead
were ever seriously regarded as practicable of transport
over the hundreds of miles separa'ing the little party
of stock-raising pioneers from the nearest centre of popu-
lation. The shearer, or boundary-rider of to-day, lives
the life of a king compared with the rough experiences
of those who followed Patrick Leslie into the unknown
wilds of unexplored Queensland in the early forties.
Before he found the site for his future home the pioneer
of those days must travel with flocks and herds, accom-
panied by waggons conveying all the plant and equip-
ment for the first few years of effort in carving out a
permanent pastoral holding in a territory containing
unknown dangers in the way of hostile blacks, who
sometimes waged all the war they were capable of
against both the invading white man and the strange
animals with which he was flooding the country. In
those first days of occupation of the State’s interior
there lurked always the danger of death from thirst and
from the loss of bearings as the bushman followed his
employment, alone sometimes for weeks, spending long
days in the saddle and camping at night with only the
star-lit dome of heaven for a covering.
At that period the division lines between runs were
indefinite. Fences were unknown; and no great store
was set upon the exact area available to the individual,
for in each case he had the use of much more land than
he could sufficiently stock. Cattle were branded with
the distinctive mark of the owner, and they roamed at
will, the squatter knowing they would not leave the
proximity of water and that but few of them would
stray beyond the limits of the country he and his stock-
men would cover when next they scoured the face of
the wilderness at the time of periodical mustering.
Sheep were differently treated, for they had to be
protected from dingoes, blacks, and other dangers.
Divided into flocks of from 1,500 to 2,000 each mob
was placed in the care of a shepherd who lived in a hut,
beside which was constructed a yard. He was possessed
of two or three well-trained sheepdogs, by the aid of
which the flock was nightly returned to its shelter. The
method was wasteful in the labour it entailed, wasteful
in the quantity of pasturages it left untouched or that
it destroyed in the nightly driving of the flock home-
wards. But in those days no other method was practical.
The station homestead took the nature of a depot
cut off by hundreds of miles of untracked wilds from
the nearest port. Six months, or even longer, might be
occupied in the conveyance of stores to some of these
early outback stations. Mails arrived at rare
intervals, months sometimes elapsing before news
arrived of the world now grown so remote. The visit
of a stranger was an exciting event. The hardships of
the climate were more difficult to withstand than in
modern times, which have brought within the reach of


the station-holder the benefits of large, airily-con-
structed buildings, a more varied diet than the pioneers
enjoyed, and other comforts which railways and roads
have since rendered available.
In spite of the dangers and difficulties it had to offer,
possibly rather because of some of them, the life of the
pioneering pastoralist held a subtle fascination for men
of the type who had deliberately left the land of their
birth to seek fortunes in the little-known southern
continent. Accompanying both discomforts and menaces
to life and limb was satisfaction from the spirit of
conquest and the sense of freedom accompanying the
realization of enormous spaces where no title deeds were
disputed, but where, instead, the pioneer was given a
free hand to work out his own salvation confronted with
stupendous difficulties raised on his track by Nature, but
impeded by none of the deflecting intricacies belonging
to the more complex scheme of things in the busier
and their wool clips to markets, and to establish
such improvements about their homesteads as the
slender means and capital at their disposal rendered
possible.
With the application of capital came wire fences,
a better conservation of water, finer and more elaborate
station buildings, ultimately the successful boring, for
artesian water. Wire fences considerably increased the
carrying capacity of the runs, as also did the establish-
ment of a better system of water conservation, so that
shorter distances need be travelled by thirsty stock in
search for drink. The aetivities of the pioneer pastoralist
thus grew rapidly more diversified. Shearing became
a more serious undertaking, involving the employment
of more men, because larger flocks had to be dealt with;
besides which more thorough methods of wool classi-
fication and of generally handling the sheep as well as the
fleeces came into vogue. Fencing contracts, tank

haunts of man. These men knew they were pushing into
the unknown another outpost of the Empire. They were
carrying on the fight fought by British men from
the first genesis of the Empire. Counteracting the
effects of immense solitudes and an occasional almost
overpowering loneliness was a busy activity, entailing
long days of arduous physical labour alternated with
nights of deep healthful sleep earned by long endeavour
in a good cause. It was the spirit of adventure which
responded to the call of the Queensland wilds.
A SECOND PHASE.
The application of southern capital in the early
seventies brought great changes in the character of the
lives of the Queensland pastoralists. Up till then the
time and energies of the pioneers had been devoted
mostly to guarding flocks and herds by means of their
shepherds and stockmen, to getting their surplus stock
excavation contracts, and building contracts wei'e let,
and the work supervized by the pastoralist, or else the
latter undertook the task, employing hie own men and
shouldering the whole responsibility himself. The
shepherd gave place to the boundary-rider; and the
latter was generally stationed at some remote part of the
run often more than a day s ride from the homestead.
A great change had come upon the pastoral
country. The tentative experimental enterprise of
driving out flocks and herds to graze on huge territories
entirely in their native condition had given place to
the beginnings of an ordered industry, systematically
applied by the aid of technical skill working with a
sufficiency of financial resource. To the mind of the
pastoralist there now appealed the satisfaction of doing
concrete things on a huge scale, of autocratically con-
trolling the industry over an area as large as an English
county. When drought came, or other natural adversity


swept the territory in which he worked, success
or failure would lie solely in his hands, if, indeed,
success were to be attainable by human effort. But he
was better off than had been the case a few years before,
because there were available the results of the expendi-
ture of capital with which to fight the hostilities of
Nature. There were about him the accumulating results
of his own accomplishments, in improvements which
each year he added to the station.
During this period there were time and resources
available for the enlargement and beautifying of the
home. The permanence of the pastoral industry had
become abundantly apparent; and round what had not
so many years before formed little better than huts and
camping-place, growing plantations thrust their leafy
heads above the levels of the fences, whilst whole clusters
of buildings, scattered about the main dwelling-house,
gave the appearance of an embryo township of stability
and substance.
Life in the great pastoral interior was now gather-
ing to itself many of the comforts of country life
prevailing in the southern and more closely settled
States. In a great deal of the far-back northern and
north-western country, especially where the resources are
devoted to cattle-breeding rather than to wool, very
primitive conditions still remain. It is still true, where
owners employ managers to control their station-hold-
ings, themselves living elsewhere, that less of attractive-
ness appertains to the life at the station than where the
holder of the run is himself carving out the destinies of
the enterprise. But in the main the character of the
earliest pioneering life has vanished.
With the fencing of runs, the construction of roads,
and the application of capital to the runs themselves,
communication with the outside world, as well as
between the various stations, became more frequent and
regular. The breed of horses came to be improved, and
this made transport easier and more rapid. The life of
the pastoralist and his employes grew more settled and
ordered than it had been before. Most of the physical
dangers and much of the discomfort of the first
period had been eliminated. But the work was no less
strenuous than before. The great distances still lay
within the boundaries of the run. The paddocks
enclosed by wire fences were so vast that a muster
of one of them occupied all the time of a gang of
mounted men from early dawn till dark for many days.
The increase in the stock and in the employes imposed
more numerous and larger problems upon the mind of the
pastoralist. On a big station, from every distant
piont of the holding, sheep must be mustered for
shearing and brought into the shearing-shed in a
never-failing stream, always maintaining its volume,
whilst never causing congestion at the common centre
where the fleeces were tumbling upon the boards and
round the feet of the shearers. The whole plan
of the working of a big station must be mapped
out beforehand in the brain of the pastoralist; and on
his unaided shoulders falls the sole responsibility for
every error of judgment and every unfortunate decision.
More than on any other single factor the success of the
enterprise depends on whether the pastoralist is or is
not a successful stock-breeder. Both in wool-growing
and in cattle-raising returns are mostly determined by
the character of stock being used; and all over Australia
pastoralists are endeavouring, by means of careful
selection, to improve types, and particularly to evolve
those suited to withstand the difficulties of life peculiar
to the natural environment of the district in which
they are to be used.
Thus, if the second era of pastoral life in Queens-
land carried fewer of the hardships and dangers to be
met with in the earliest days of pioneering, yet it
demanded far greater technical knowledge, and was
spread over a far wider range of subjects than was called
for two or three decades before. Many fortunes were
made in pastoral Queensland during the two decades
beginning with the seventies; and numbers of stately
Toorak mansions owe their existence to this period,
when good seasons coincided with good prices and
capital in sufficient quantity came to be applied to the
fertile plains and downs of Queensland’s great interior.
LATER CHANGES.
The third era in the pastoral life of Queensland
dates from the beginning of the 20th century, though
it is true that the severe drought which culminated in
1902 brought ruin to very many graziers, and imposed
losses on others which required years to overtake.
The motor car, and the extension of telephone
services into the back country, have done much to
revolutionize pastoral life in the out-back parts of Queens-
land. The pushing out of railways has also operated
in the same direction. In the earlier stages of settle-
ment the dominating feature of life on a big Queens-
land station—and almost all Queensland stations were
big as measured by southern standards—lay in great
distances and the isolation which great distances impose.
The telephone, the motor car, and the railway track
have served to annihilate distance. The little community
living on a far-back station is no longer compelled to
wait often for weeks in darkness so far as knowledge
of the outside world is concerned. And an excursion to
a neighbouring homestead no longer occupies days before
the visitors again reach their homes. Distance has
been vanquished. The journey which, when horses pro-
vided the sole means of transit, involved camping in
the open, is easily covered in the space of a few hours
by a smooth-running car. And the telephone, wherever
it has penetrated, has brought the station manager


within instant touch with the nearest telegraph office,
and thus with all the rest of the Commonwealth. And
this is not the only advantage obtained where the
telephones exist, for station is connected with station
in a network of lines, so that though hundreds of miles
may often separate homesteads, yet the residents of
these depots on the almost limitless plains are able to
chat to one another almost as easily as though they were
next-door neighbours in some suburban street.
Modern machinery has done much to alter the
industrial side of pastoral life, particularly on holdings
devoted wholly or partly
to wool-growing. Machine-
shearing has quickened the
annual task of taking off
the clips; and it has also
resulted in the work being
better done. The combs and
cutters run closer to the
skin and cut more evenly
than did the old-fashioned
blades. Consequently, from
the lambs that come in for
the first shearing a heavier
weight of fleece is shorn.
The machine-shearing plant
requires the services of a
qualified engineer and a
skilled mechanic. It has
added to the technique of
station management and to
the profits of pastoral
enterprise.
Artesian boring has
been the means during later
years of enabling the pas-
toral industry to be pushed
over vast areas of country
where stock could not be kept
alive if the owner were de-
pendent on surface water.
Queensland contains many
wide tracts of fertile but
arid land, where the feed
is of excellent quality, but where in the earlier
days it was impossible to found stations because of
the absence of water for drinking. Boring tapped
the underground supplies at depths of sometimes
3,000 feet; and bounteous flows shot into the sunlight,
giving rise to little creeks which might be utilized for
any purpose the pastoralist pleased. Great quantities of
water have been discovered in this way almost all over
the interior of the State. Sometimes stations are
entirely dependent for their security upon such supplies,
and in other instances artesian bores add greatly to the
value of holdings which, though they might be worked
with the conservation of surface water, are rendered
much more secure in times of drought, and more profit-
able at all times, by bringing the underground supplies
to the surface.
A great deal of controversy of late years has waged
round the permanence of the artesian supplies, in which
the volume of the water flowing to the surface has
somewhat diminished. Professor Gregory has held that
bores have tapped a kind of exhaustible storage lying
beneath the ground, and that when this storeage is
finished the bores will cease
to supply the needs of
the pastoral industry. How-
ever, the more generally
accepted theory is that the
bores tap not a storage but
a continually-flowing under-
ground supply fed annually
by the seasonal rainfalls of
Queensland, and flowing
towards the sea in a
southerly direction. The
diminished flow is to some
extent accounted for by cor-
rosion which takes place in
the bore casing and to
other influences. But what-
ever the future may have in
store, there can be no ques-
tion about the important
and beneficial part artesian
boring has played in the
progress of the pastoral
industry of Queensland.
A further phase of
this third era of pastoral
life has been represented
by the tendency of the
Government to divide and
subdivide the land, so that
in most districts the hold-
ings are decreasing in area.
This subject is specially dealt
with in an article appearing elsewhere in this work.
1 lie rapid and substantial rise in the world’s prices
for beef, which began in a marked degree before the
great European war, and which continued at an
accelerated rate after the outbreak of hostilities, has
resulted in the selection of much virgin cattle country
in the north of Queensland. The enhanced rates made
the industry profitable where before it could not be
carried on to advantage. There was every prospect of
the higher rates being permanent. America had ceased
to be a meat-exporting country and had become a
ARTESIAN EORE AT CHARLEVILLE.


meat-importing country. Her demand had overtaken her
supply. The world’s demand was overtaking the supply.
Though the war added to this development, there were
sufficient reasons to justify the extension of the cattle
industry in Queensland, even without the results pro-
duced by the European conflagration.
Unfortunately, at a critical time, a disastrous
drought overtook the State of Queensland; and during
the whole of 1915, and part of 1916, when high
prices were ruling for all pastoral products, sheep and
cattle were dying in millions from starvation and thirst.
This retarded a pronounced forward movement which
undoubtedly otherwise would have taken place. The
earliest effects of the war coincided with this protracted
period of rainlessness, and the State was greatly
disturbed by the combined effects of both.

“CRESSBROOK” Station, on
the Brisbane River. Pre-eminent
among the pastoral properties of
Queensland, from the historic stand-
point is “Cressbrook,” founded
in 1841, the well-known “Glen-
gallan” Station, on the Dar-

ling Downs, alone having preceded
it in the date of its founda-
tion. The late David C. McConnel,
who, so far as any other record can
be discovered, was the first white
man to set foot on that portion of
Queensland soil embraced in the
Brisbane Valley district, first took
up the area and called it “Cress-
brook,” after a property belonging
to the family in Derbyshire, Eng-
land, and it possesses the distinction,
rare among landed holdings in
Queensland, of having continued in
the same family right from the
commencement up to the present
time. The estate is watered by the
Brisbane River and Cressbrook
Creek, which, with their respective
tributaries and a chain of lagoons,
yield an abundant and permanent
water supply. All the river and
creek lands are of rich alluvial soil,
and are largely used for the produc-
tion of lucerne, prolific crops of
which are raised with comparative
ease. Early in its history the station
became noted for its herd of short-
horns, in the breeding of which Mr.
McConnel took a deep interest,
importing his stud bulls and cows
from England. In more recent time,
after entering into partnership with
his eldest son, the late J. H.
McConnel, it was decided to aban-
don the shorthorn breed in favour
of Herefords, the latter in his
opinion being better beef cattle, and
constitutionally superior for breed-
ings purposes on the outside run
owned by the firm. This decision has
been amply justified, and the
“Cressbrook” herd for many years
past has been famous throughout
Queensland, the shorthorn herd
having been sold to Messrs. Bell
and Dangar, of New South Wales,
about 1883. After the death of the
founder in 1885 the firm was car-
ried on under the name of D. C.
McConnel & Sons, with Mr. J. H.
McConnel as managing partner
until # 1908, when the lastnamed
gentleman purchased his brothers
and sisters’ interest, and continued
operations on his own behalf. Dur-
ing these years the area of “Cress-
brook” was gradually reduced,
being subdivided into smaller farms,
and Mr. J. H. McConnel, with a
view to promoting settlement and
encouraging the farming industry,
established a milk factory on Cress-
brook Creek. This was an enter-
prise involving much risk, and
unfortunately the first manager of
the factory proved himself not to be
the expert he was supposed, much of
the milk sent out by the factory
being a failure. In the event, Mr.
McConnel shut down the factory,
and sent Mr. W. A. Munro to
America, thoroughly to study the
methods in vogue there. The result
of this procedure was highly satis-
factory. Mr. Munro upon his return
was appointed manager, and the
Cressbrook milk was soon so well
established on the Australian mar-
kets that when, in 1907, the well-
known Swiss firm of Nestle decided
to start in Queensland, as elsewhere
in Australia, it proved worth its
while to buy out Messrs. D. C.
McConnel & Sons rather than risk
competition by so popular a rival
firm. Of the original estate only
about 12,000 acres remain, and this
it is proposed to reduce still further,
to the smallest possible area com-
patible with the requirements of the
Hereford herd. At the time of
writing (1917) the outside properties

worked in conjunction with “Cress-
brook” are the leaseholds of “Glen-
haughton” and “The Auburn,”
which are supplied with bulls from
the “Cressbrook” pastures. These
properties are owned by the share-
holders in the firm of McConnel and


Kirk, Limited, of which Mr. W. H.
Kirk is also general manager. The
homestead at “Cressbrook” is very
picturesquely situated about J-mile
from the river, between which and
the house lies a long stretch of
lucerne. Beyond is a fine range of
hills. Mr. D. C. McConnel, finding
the locality where he had first
camped upon coming to the district

1841 removed to the present posi-
tion, 7 miles distant from the
original spot, and 60 feet above
water level. Here he settled, build-
ing of cedar two good rooms, with
a verandah, and a fireplace of home-
made bricks, to which were added a
large store and a kitchen wing, and
a little later two additional rooms.
Before building he made inquiries of
the blacks as to flood marks, and
was told that the river never rose as
high as his foundations. This, how-
ever, proved to be incorrect, as on
many occasions, notably in the 1865
flood, the water topped the verandah
sleepers, while in the great floods of
1901, on February 2, and again on
February 17, the river rose 3 feet
above the floor in the old house, and
18 inches in the addition which was
built in 1864. Though constructed
entirely of timber, the “Cressbrook”
house is very substantially built, and
the family, having become greatly
attached to the home which it has
done so much to make beautiful,
prefer to run the risk of flood to
building elsewhere. After Mr. J. H.
McConnel’s death in 1914, his wife,
preparatory to taking up her resi-
dence with her daughters at “Cress-
brook," made very considerable
alterations in the house, which have
added greatly to its picturesque ap-
pearance. The native timber in the
vicinity is abundant, and promises
to be very fine in years to come.
Much tree-planting also has been
done, and considerable time and
trouble have been given to the lay-
ing out of a large garden, which is
always kept in good order. A fea-
ture of the grounds is a bunyah tree
of great height, believed to be the
oldest of its species in Australia,
which, though battered by many
storms, is still symmetrical and a
landmark in a wide radius. This
was one of two grown from nuts
from the Bunyah Mountains, and
planted by Mr. D. C. McConnel
about 1841, the other having been
removed after a few years to give
more space to the survivor. At the
present time there are very exten-
sive station buildings and a new
manager’s residence, while all of the
cottages have gardens. The central
object of interest is the Victoria
Chapel, overgrown with Virginia
creeper, and enclosed by a low
batoned fence, which was built in
1901 by Mrs. J. H. McConnel, with
her husband’s consent, in honour
of their silver wedding. Within this
enclosure lie the graves of Mr. J. H.
McConnel, his sons and grandchild,
also the graves of employes who
have died at “Cressbrook” since its
erection. Reference must be made
to the township of Toogoolawah
(named after the place of Mr. J. H.
McConnel’s birth), which was laid
out in 1904, its growth coinciding
with the progress of the milk factory
and the farming industries sur-
rounding it. Toogoolawah is a well-
planned and thriving village, and
many of the residents, following the
example set by “Cressbrook,” take
special pride in their gardens. The
main street, called Cressbrook
Street, has been planted with trees
by the Amateur Gardening and
Progress Association, in which Mrs.
J. H. McConnel is specially inter-
ested. The late Mr. David Cannon
McConnel was a son of the late
James McConnel, and was born at
the Polygon, Ardwick, Manchester,
on January 14, 1818. Upon reach-
ing man’s estate, and receiving
his portion under his father’s
will, he decided to emigrate to
Australia, and sailed for New
South Wales on February 19, 1839
He was a man of scientific tastes,
very quiet and retiring in social life,
and gave very little indication in
his manner of the indomitable and
enterprising spirit which actuated
him, and which in the early days of
Australian settlement were so indis-
pensable, being generally character-
istic of the pioneer. On arrival in
New South Wales in the same year
he explored the Moruya and New
England districts, and made pur-
chases of sheep and cattle on the
Williams and Gloucester Rivers in
that State. He then pushed on to
the Severn, and passing the present
site of Tenterfield, crossed the
Great Dividing Range and traversed
the Darling Downs, seeking country
upon which to settle his stock. He
gave a thought to “Glengallan,”
but a friend had got in a little ahead
of him, so he passed on. He then
took up as one run “Rosewood” and
“Tarampa,” below the range, but
was not satisfied with the prospects
offered by this locality, and moved
on again. Continuing his travels,
Mr. McConnel ‘‘marked his trees”
on Cressbrook Creek, a tributary of
the Upper Brisbane, there being the
first to establish stock on a run to
the east of the main range of
Queensland. Here he erected a
temporary home, growing maize,
and it is probable also wheat. In
those days all provisions, with the

exception of meat, had to be pro-
cured by means of bullock-dray
from Ipswich (then called Lime-
stone), and there were often delays
in the arrival of supplies, when it
became necessary for Mr, McConnel
to grind his grain in primitive
fashion between two stones. He
purchased some splendid pedigreed
shorthorn bulls from the Australian
Agricultural Company’s place at


Port Stephen, which were aug-
mented with more of the same class
imported from England, and so
began the building up of the fine
“Cressbrook” herd, so well known
to members of the pastoral com-
munity. From about 1848 to 1862
Mr. D. C. McConnel was in part-
nership with an elder brother, Mr.
John McConnel, who built a small
brick house, which was always
known as “The Cottage,” where he
lived with his wife and son. The
Messrs. McConnel acquired “Dur-
undur,” in the Caboolture district,
which upon dissolution of the part-
nership was retained by the elder
man, Mr. D. C. McConnel remain-
ing at “Cressbrook.” In 1847 Mr.
D. C. McConnel returned to Eng-
land, leaving in charge of his
Queensland interests Mr. Henry
Mort, a member of the well-known
Mort family of New South Wales,
and father of Mr. A. E. L. Mort,
of “Franklyn Yale.” It was Mr.
McConnel’s intention not to return
to Australia, but to devote his
attention to farming pursuits in the
Old Country, and with this purpose
in view he spent a year in Yorkshire
studying farm work in its various
branches. In 1848 he married Mary
Macleod, daughter of the late
Assynt, and of his wife, Catherine
Rose, daughter of John Rose, son
of Baillie Rose, of Nairn, and
Moore, Brisbane.

Dr. Lang’s immigrant ships, the pas-
sengers on board, who were mostly
of Scottish descent, proving them-
selves later a very sterling set of
pioneers. Settling at Kangaroo
Point, in a small wooden cottage,
Mr. McConnel shortly afterwards
purchased land at Bulimba (then
Toogoolawah), and built the first
stone house in Queensland —a fine
two-storeyed structure of white free-
stone. At that time he owned a very
considerable amount of land on both
sides of the river, and for some years
he raised crops of lucerne, Italian
rye grass, maize, cotton, etc., with
success, besides which he rented a
number of farms on easy terms to im-
migrants, with the right of purchase.
In the new stone house at Bulimba
his eldest son, James Henry, was
born. About eight months later he
took his wife and child to “Cress-
brook,” which he had fitted up,
as far as circumstances allowed, in
a manner befitting the reception of
his family. Mrs. McConnel, upon
her introduction to her station home,
was agreeably surprised to note the
absence of the element of roughness
which she had expected, and she
gave herself over with considerable
enthusiasm to the congenial task of
adding touches of beauty to the

Early in 1849, with his wife, he

time did not permit of a prolonged
residence at “Cressbrook,” and she


returned to Bulimba, where she

returning to Queensland in 1862.
For the following ten years the
McConnels made their home at
“Cressbrook,” a large wing being
added to the original house to
accommodate the increasing family.
They took much personal interest in
the men employed on the station
and in their wives and families,
securing educational facilities for the
children, even in those early days,
promoting religious influence, and
making provision for social and re-
creative opportunities by fitting up a
reading-room at the station and dis-
tributing literature of an interesting
and improving character.. In cele-
bration of their silver wedding, Mr.
McConnel purchased, cleared, and
fenced a block of land in Esk, which
he presented for the erection of a
church and manse. In 1873 Mr.
J. H. McConnel took over the
management of “Cressbrook,” and
Mr. D. C. McConnel bought a pro-
perty 6 miles up the river from
Brisbane, called by its former owner
“Witton Manor,” which name was
retained by the McConnels. This,
henceforth, became the headquarters
of the family, who, however, fre-
quently made visits to “Cressbrook.”
Mr. McConnel was one of the
pioneer advocates of inoculation for
pleuro-pneumonia among cattle. He
became the earliest director of the
first bank to open for business in
Queensland, his colleague being
Captain R. J. Coley. He died in
London in 1885. Whilst residing
at “Witton Manor” Mrs. McCon-
nel, a lady of great refinement and
culture, representing the finest type
of Scotswoman, interested herself in
the English, Scotch, and Irish set-
tiers who were making homes all
around them, and became impressed
with the necessity for special hos-
pital accommodation for sick and
injured children, the general hospital
being crowded with adult sufferers,
and no room left for sick little ones.
Inviting a large number of ladies to
“Witton Manor,” she laid before
her visitors the cause of the young
patients whose needs had made such
a strong appeal to her own heart,
and in this way was set on foot the
movement which culminated in the
establishment of the Brisbane Child-
ren’s Hospital, opened on March 11,
1878, which is now one of the
largest institutions in Australia.
During the course of her life Mrs.
D. C. McConnel published in book
form, for private circulation, some
account of her experiences as a
pioneer’s wife, which makes an
interesting contribution to the liter-
ature dealing with the early days.
The declining years of her life were
snent in the Old Country, where she
died in 1910. By their own wish,
Mr. and Mrs. D. C. McConnel were
buried at Ipswich, Queensland. Mr.
J. H. McConnel married in 1876 a
daughter of Mr. William Kent,
of Jondaryan, Darling Downs,
and from that date made “Cress-
brook” his permanent home. His
name as a stockbreeder, agricultur-
alist, and able financier, was a
household word in Queensland, and
as a generous friend and employer
he had few equals. His hospitality
was unfailing, and his genial, cheery
manner obtained for him many
friends. Mr. J. H. McConnel’s
two elder sons having died in
childhood, in 1910 he took into part-
nership his third son, Mr Edgar

McConnel, who for many years held
the rank of captain in the Queens-
land Defence Force, volunteered his
services for the present war. Owing
to unavoidable circumstances, how-
ever, so far he has had to be content
to “do his bit” in training recruits
at the Brisbane camp. His younger
brother, Mr. Kenneth Hamlyn
McConnel, joined the forces at the
close of 1914, shortly afterwards
proceeding to the front. He took
part in the campaigns in Egypt and
Gallipoli, and obtained a lieuten-
ancy in the infantry, subsequently
being sent to France, where he was
seriously wounded in the offensive
at Pozieres on July 24, 1916.

the property of Mr. Eric Walter
McConnel. This property was first
taken up in the early forties by
Messrs. Frederick and Francis Bigge,
two English gentlemen, who came to
Queensland in 1840 and subsequently
secured the tract of country sur-
rounding the mountain which had
been named in honour of Sir Thomas
Brisbane, an early governor of the
Mother State. Here they settled
down to pastoral pursuits, for many
years being prominent in the busi-
ness of horse-breeding, and ulti-
mately both partners returned to
England, leaving the late William
Bowman in charge of their interests
at “Mount Brisbane.” The Bowmans
continued to reside on the station
until 1891, and upon their retire-
ment Mr. E. W. McConnel was
offered the post of manager by the
Hon. Alex. Raff, who was control-
ling affairs in Queensland for the
Messrs. Bigge. Whilst occupying
this position he was joined, in 1893,
by Mr. Philip Matthew Bigge, a
cousin of the founders of the station,

who spent about four years at
“Mount Brisbane,” gaining experi-
ence in the pastoral industry under
the guidance of Mr. McConnel. In
1895 an arrangement was made by
which the latter gentleman and Mr.
P. M. Bigge secured a 14 years’
lease of the property—then compris-
ing 35,000 acres—and conducted
operations under the style of Bigge
and McConnel, and when this time
had expired they purchased 25,000
acres of the estate. Shortly after
this transaction the partners sub-
divided and disposed of 7,500 acres
to smaller settlers, and the members
of the little community thus formed
have met with almost uniform pros-
perity, the settlement being regarded
as among the most successful in
Queensland. In 1910 a further pur-
chase was made of “Consuelo,” situ-
ated 65 miles from Springsure, and
this station is still held by the firm
under the supervision of a manager,
Mr. C. W. Ogg, who has acquired a
small interest in the property. Ex-
tending over about 750 square miles
of country, this run carries some
18,000 head of cattle, and has, in
addition, proved favourable to the
production of a fine type of horses.
Mr. P. M. Bigge married, in 1897,
a daughter of Mr. Graham Hart, of
the firm of Messrs. Flower & Hart,
solicitors, and took up his residence
at Brisbane. His death occurred at
Southport in the year 1913, after
which event his widow, who still re-
tains an interest in “Mount Bris-
bane,” proceeded to England, where
she has since resided with her only
son. In 1914 Mr. E. W. McConnel
purchased the “Mount Brisbane”
homestead, with some 10,000 acres
of the surrounding land, inde-
pendently of the interests which he
held in the whole estate, and also

to remove the original structure,

of the brothers in the forties, from
the low-lying position which it for-
merly occupied to its present higher
site, the house being practically re-
built at this period. Since that time
modern additions have been made by
Mr. E. W. McConnel, but the home
still retains its individuality as a
pioneer dwelling, in the respect that
it is built throughout of the valuable
cedar wood indigenous to the district,
Surrounded by extensive lawns and

cessful in getting some of the best
blood procurable. “Mountßrisbane,”
as already mentioned, in former days
was renowned for its equine stock,
but as the land become more closely
settled it was found that the horses
did not thrive so well in small areas,
and accordingly Mr. McConnel re-
linquished the breeding of thorough-
breds on a large scale, and now con-
fines his efforts to draughts of the
Clydesdale type, for which purpose
he imported from Scotland two
valuable Clydesdales — viz., “High
Sheriff” and “Chapmanton Jess,”
a stallion and mare, both closely
connected in breeding with “Baron’s
Pride,” Scotland’s horse par ex-
cellence —an animal which main-
tained an unbeaten record for
14 years in that country. Mr.
Eric Walter McConnel is a
pastoralist with inherited proclivi-
ties for the successful handling of
stock and the management of im-
portant commercial interests. Born
at “Cressbrook” Station, Queens-
land, on March 11, 1863, he is a
son of the late David Cannon
McConnel, founder of that pro-
perty; he had for paternal grand-
father the late James McConnel, of
Manchester, one of those princes of
industrial enterprise whose achieve-
ments have served to mark successive
epochs in the history of invention
and manufacture; while his earlier
ancestors farmed their rich acres at
Hannastown and Beoch in Kirkcud-
brightshire, in the south of Scotland.
In 1860 the late David Cannon
McConnel was led to devote a great
deal of time and attention to the
subject of his ancestry, the substance
of his discoveries being embodied in
a volume printed in Edinburgh in
1861. On April 3 and 4 of that year
(1860) a meeting of six McConnel
brothers was held in Manchester for
the purpose of deciding upon the
adoption of armorial bearings more
in accordance with the history and
tradition of the family than those
assumed by their father, James
McConnel, who about 1817 first
made use of such ensigns, having
caused a search to be made in the
Lord Lyon Office, Edinburgh, and
in the Herald Office, Dublin, with
the result that he assumed the fol-
lowing arms;—“Party per fesse vert
and argent, a stag trippant between
three trefoils counterchanged. Crest,
a stag’s head erased argent, charged
with a trefoil vert. Motto, ‘Victor
in arduis.’ ” In 1860 a combination
of circumstances rendered it advis-
able that his eldest son should regis-
ter his coat-of-arms, and an investi-
gation disclosed that the above were


the ensigns memorial of O’Connel, of
Derrynane Abbey, County Kerry,
and that no armorial bearings had
been registered under the name of
McConnel. This search in Edinburgh,
however, revealed the fact that the
name of McConnel was identical with
that of Macdonald, a passage occur-
ring in a work by Wm. Buchanan,
published in 1723, reading as fol-
lows: —“Macdonald, M’Connel of
Largie. The name of M’Connel is
always so designed by way of emin-
ence and without any further dis-
tinction. Macdonald of Slate mar-
ried the daughter of King Robert
11., and is ancestor of Macdonald of
Largie.” It was evident that the
McConnels had no right to the
O’Connel arms, and spurred on by
this new and startling information,
Mr. David Cannon McConnel took
up the matter with his accustomed
thoroughness, his researches going to
prove in a highly-conclusive manner
that although before the 16th and
17th centuries the history of the
family is shrouded in considerable
obscurity —on one hypothesis an
Irish origin being attributed to
them —the true source of the M’Con-
nels is to be found in the Highlands
of Ayrshire, whence they migrated
to Galloway,’ in which place the first
clear records begin. The earliest
ancestor bearing the name M’Connel
of whom record exists is - John
M’Connel, who lived in and farmed
the Beoch, in the parish of Tongland,
district of Galloway, near Kirkcud-
bright, and married a Miss M’Clel-
lan, of Nether Crae, about the year
1690, this lady belonging to a Gallo-
way family who were well known as
prominent Covenanters. John Mc-
Connel’s lot was cast in troublous
times, when religious persecution
cast its baleful shadow over the land
and Galloway was treated as though
it had been a revolted province. He
had four children, of whom Samuel
married Margaret M’Millan, their
third child, James, born 1723, being
the father of James McConnel, the
great cotton-spinner of Manchester.
This earlier James McConnel mar-
ried Mary Cannan, described as a
“beautiful but fragile woman,
whose waist could be encircled by
her husband’s two hands,” and who
died at the age of 24, being suc-
ceeded by a second wife in 1770.
Born on Beoch Farm in 1762, as
a young man of 20 James McConnel
the younger proceeded to Chowbent,
in Lancashire, where his maternal
uncle, Mr. William Cannan, carried
on business as a machinist, in part-
nership with a Mr. Smith. After
serving his apprenticeship to the
trade with this firm, Mr. McConnel
left Chowbent for Manchester in
February, 1788, and shortly after-
wards started in business as a
machine maker on his own account.
In 1791 the firm of Sandfords,
McConnel, & Kennedy was formed,
operating as machine makers and
mule-spinners in Manchester for
about four years, after which
McConnel and Kennedy formed an
independent partnership. This firm
carried on the combined industries
of cotton spinning and machine mak-
ing in a building near Shooter’s
Brook, and became responsible for
various improvements in machinery,
among these being the first arrange-
ments for a single and double-speed
on the mule when driven by power.
Their correspondence of that date
shows that great advances were tak-
ing place, and it is interesting to
note they recommended their cus-
tomers to order mules of 240 spindles
each, in place of 144, which had been
thought to be the limit a year or two
before. A century later McConnel
and Co., Limited, were spinning on
mules ranging from 2,000 to 2,600
spindles per pair. The cotton spin-
ning branch of the business went
ahead by leaps and bounds. In 1833
their staff of employes numbered
1,545 persons, or more than 200 in
advance of any other firm in Man-
chester at the time. Big buildings
arose in due course, and in 1869 the
firm was well to the fore in adopting
gas as an illuminant, a plant for this
purpose being introduced on the pre-
mises. After the death of Mr. James
McConnel, for 30 years the business
was carried on by his three sons—
Henry, James, and William—and
upon the formation of the Fine
Spinners and Doublers’ Association,
Limited, in 1898, Messrs. McConnel
and Co., Limited, decided to join
this magnificent trade combination,
Mr. John W. McConnel, who had
succeeded his father, Mr. William
McConnel, in the business, being
appointed to the board, upon which
he has retained his seat ever since.
Preserving its identity, the firm
continued its developmental scheme,
and many new and important
buildings testify to the success of its
operations. Innumerable improve-
ments have been carried out in every
direction, all modern appliances now
being found throughout the many
mills owned by the firm. On May
28, 1799, Mr. James McConnel
married, at Gonaldstown Church,
Nottinghamshire, Margaret Houlds-
worth, second daughter of Henry
Houldsworth, who was born on her
father’s farm, “Gonaldston Hagg,”
on July 11, 1778. Of this union
there were 13 children, of whom
David Cannon McConnel, father
of the gentleman under review,
was the eleventh. ERIC WALTER
McCONNEL received his early
education at grammar schools at
Brisbane and Ipswich. He con-
tinued his studies in Italy, Germany,
and Switzerland, and subsequently
proceeded to England, where he
took a course at the College
of Agriculture at Downton, near
Salisbury. Having completed his
training course, at 20 years of age
he returned to his native land and
joined at “Cressbrook” his brother,
the late James Henry McConnel, a
gentleman well known as one of the
most prominent stock experts in
Queensland, under whose able
tuition the young pastoralist made
rapid strides in the attainment of
that knowledge especially necessary
to his future career. Upon the de-
mise of his father in 1885, the exist-
ing firm of D. C. McConnel & Sons
was continued under the same title,
Mr. E. W. McConnel being included
in the partnership, which also owned
in those days “Glen Haughton,”
“Apis Creek,” “Clifton,” “Moura,”
and “Banana” Stations. The
management of the old firm now
devolves on the shoulders of Mr. E.
W. McConnel. Mr. McConnel takes
considerable interest in public affairs
and has occupied the office of chair-
man of the Esk Shire Council and
also of the Esk Co-operative Butter
Factory, of which be was one of the
founders. For nearly a quarter of a
century he has held the Commission
of the Peace, is a member of the
West Moreton Rabbit Board, and
takes a leading part in all matters of
local interest. He is recognized as a
“good sport,” his colours frequently
being seen on the premier race-
courses of Queensland, besides which
he is fond of shooting and is regarded
as a first-class shot. In the year 1895


Mr. McConnel married Susan, second
daughter of the late Dr. Hugh Bell,
F.R.C.S., M.D. (Lond.), on© of the
best-known medical practitioners of
Queensland, of which union there are
three sons, Keith, the eldest, being
at present (1916) a student at Har-
row, the famous and historical centre
of learning in England.
HENRY PLANTAGENET SOM-
ERSET, M.L.A., “Caboonbah,”
which well-known property occupies
a picturesque block of country
watered by the Brisbane River, and
commanding beautiful views of
the D’Aguilar Range and other
distinctive scenery, is the second
son of the late Colonel C. H.
Somerset, C. 8., who, as Colonel of
the 72nd Highlanders, commanded
a flying column with great distinc-
tion during the Indian Mutiny; and
grandson of the late Lieut.-General
Sir Henry Somerset, K.C.8., K.H.,
Commander-in-Chief of the British
Forces in South Africa during
the Kaffir Wars of 1850-55, subse-
quently Governor and Commander-
in-Chief of the Bombay Presidency
prior to and at the time of
LIEUT.-GEN. SIR HENRY SOMERSET,
K.C.B., K.A.
the Mutiny, and later Governor of
Gibraltar, where he died and was
buried. The late veteran was the
eldest son of Lord Charles Somerset,
a noted Governor of Cape Colony,
second son of Henry, fifth Duke of
Beaufort, and brother of Lieutenant-
General Lord Raglan, K.C.8.,
K.C.H., etc., who was Commander-
in-Chief in the Crimean War, and
of Lieutenant-General Lord Edward
Somerset, G.C.8., etc., Lieutenant-
Colonel Lord John Somerset and
Lord Robert Somerset—noted gen-
erals under Wellington in the Pen-
insular War and at Waterloo. In the
Art Gallery at the Executive Build-
ing, Brisbane, a copy may be seen of
the historical print of the Duke of
Wellington’s great banquet after
Waterloo, at which these four mem-
bers of the Somerset family were
present, together with Lady Somer-
set and her three daughters. This
notable military family is descended
through John of Gaunt and Cathe-
rine Swynford from Rollo, the
Norse sea-king (grandsire of William
the Conqueror), and also from
Alfred the Great and King Malcolm
of Scotland, while the family name
of Plantagenet is derived directly
from the ancestor sovereigns of that
line, who reigned in England during
the Middle Ages. Another ancestor,
John de Botecourt, an eminent mili-
tary commander, took a leading part
in the Scottish Wars of Edward 1.,
being entrusted with the government
of the strongest castles, the com-
mand of the Fleet, and other duties
of the highest importance. He was
summoned to the Parliament of
England as Baron Botecourt, 1305-
1324. Perhaps, however, the most
notable ancestor of the Somersets was
Edward, second Marquis of Worces-
ter (called Earl of Glamorgan by
Charles I.), who invented the piston
and was the first to utilize in a
practical manner the force of steam,
to whom, as a matter of fact, the
credit of having made the earliest
steam engine is due. He supplied
the City of London with water
pumped by steam; but the war
with Cromwell prevented him from
realizing his intention of “making
coaches to go without horses and
ships without sails,’’ for which pur-
pose he had gone as far as to obtain
letters patent from King Charles.
“The Life, Times, and Scientific
Labours of the Second Marquis of
Worcester,” to which is added a re-
print of his “Century of Inventions
(1663), with a Commentary there-
on,” by Llenry Dircks, civil engi-
neer, etc., is now a standard work.
It is an interesting historical fact
that this Edward’s father, Henry,
fifth Earl and first Marquis of Wor-
cester, a devoted Royalist, garri-
soned Raglan Castle, and, at his
own expense, held it for nearly four
years against Cromwell’s forces.
Mr. H. P. Somerset was born in
South Africa, in May, 1852, and
subsequently spent a few years in
India with his parents and other
members of the family, including his
brothers, William Henry, a retired
COLONEL CHARLES HENRY SOMERSET, C.B.
captain of the Royal Navy; Charles,
lieutenant, R.N., deceased; and a
sister, Georgina Frances, who be-
came a Sister of Mercy of All Saints’
Anglican Sisterhood at St. George’s
Home, Cape Town. Mr. Somerset
recalls many interesting incidents in
connection with his residence at
Mahabuleshwar, such as seeing a
village, from which the natives had
fled, occupied by baboons, who
robbed the bazaar and stalls and
threw the corn and pomegranates
from hand to hand to other baboons
right away into the hills; and a
great procession of elephants, among
which one bore tier on tier of bas-
kets full of baby girls, who were
sacrificed by being cast into the
river; but especially the flight by
night at the outbreak of the
Mutiny in that district, when, by
hiding in the jungle during the day,
his mother, accompanied by one
faithful servant, Mahdoo, escaped
to Poonah and Bombay, whence she
embarked with her children by the
troopship “Eastern Monarch,”
which took fire and was burning all
the way up the English Channel, the
passengers finally being slung into
Portsmouth wherries at Spithead.
As a result of the death of both
parents through the Mutiny, in 1862


Mr. Somerset became an inmate of
the home of his godmother, Lady
Wyndham, his grandfather’s sister,
afterwards, with his brother Charles
and his sister, going to reside with
his grandmother, Lady Somerset, at
Ryde, Isle of Wight. From Paul’s
Naval School, Ryde—where he was
coxswain of the school boat—Mr.
Somerset became a candidate and
passed first as a foundationer to
Wellington College, where he subse-
quently took his place in the sixth
form (mathematical) and became a
cap in the school football team and
a member of the choir for five years.
He won the Kingsley Steeplechase
in 1869 and 1870, in record time
—which, incidentally, was never
beaten until the course was changed
—and was head steward of paper-
chases, or “head of the runs,”
also instituting paper-chases for
small boys and a Junior Kingsley,
as it was called. As a foundationer
he was a Queen’s cadet, but by the
action of Gladstone in doing away
with purchase in the Army and with
Sandhurst as a Cadet College, Mr.
Somerset, with other foundationers,
was deprived of the advantages
which should have been his, in virtue
of his father’s services and death, of
MR. HENRY PLANTAGENET SOMERSET,
M.L.A.
being a Queen’s cadet, which meant
training at Sandhurst and a com-
mission in the Army, free of pur-
chase. As a result he was compelled
to enter for the first open competi-
tive examination for direct commis-
sion in 1870, and proving very suc-
cessful was invited by the head-
master of Wellington College—Dr.
Benson, subsequently Archbishop of
Canterbury —to return to the Col-
lege for the Christmas term. In
January, 1871, he accompanied his
cousin, Captain C. Morland, to
Paris, immediately after the evacu-
ation by the Prussians, and had the
exciting experience of just escaping
being shut up in that city during
the days of the Revolution. Con-
tinuing their travels to Cologne and
thence to Dresden, they remained
in the latter city for three months,
and witnessed the triumphal return
of the Saxon troops and the unveil-
ing of the statue of “Germania” in
the Alt Market, beside being made
to realize something - of what was
meant by war by visiting the hos-
pitals, viewing the transport of
troops, and seeing the French pri-
soners at the Fortress, Konigstein.
Returning to England, Mr. Somer-
set interviewed his guardian, General
Edward Somerset, with regard to his
loss of the advantage that should
have been his as a Queen’s cadet,
and with him proceeded to London
to place the matter before Field
Marshal the Duke of Cambridge,
who fully concurred and undertook
to secure for these sons of soldiers
the privileges to which they were
entitled, but for which no provision
was made. Whilst waiting for his
commission, in July, 1871, Mr.
Somerset took passage for Moreton
Bay by the clipper barque “Pol-
maise,” bound direct for Brisbane.
His advent on board this vessel
proved a godsend to the passengers,
as he and a young Devon farmer,
named Tucfcett, were the only two
men to remain sober when crossing
the Line—the captain in a fit of
delirium tremens being worse than
useless and all the officers incapable.
A terrific cyclonic hurricane threat-
ened the vessel at night-time, and
perceiving its approach young
Somerset—who had had yachting
experience and spent much time
working for fun with the sailors on
deck and aloft on the “Polmaise,”
frequently steering the ship—with
Tuckett’s assistance let all the sheets
go—the sail being set square and
the studding sail rigged—then, lash-
ing himself and his helper to the
spindle of the wheel, managed to
bring her head round and prevent
her from being taken aback, and
spent the whole of the night in
steering the ship as best they could
under bare poles, but in the oppo-
site direction, until relieved in the
morning. In Queensland Mr. Somer-
set’s first act was to sell his
forty-acre land order, granted by the
Government, for £4O, and to buy
for £25 a horse called “Pedlar,”
which had won various hurdle races
and had been driven as offside leader
to the Eagle Farm races by Prince
Alfred on his visit to Brisbane in
1868. Upon this steed he accom-
panied Mr. William Bowman to the
Clarence River district in New South
LIEUTENANT ROLLO SOMERSET.
Wales, returning with a mob of stud
Hereford cattle to “Mount Bris-
bane” Station. At Christmas-time
he proceeded to “Cressbrook,” then
occupied by Mr. D. C. McConnel
and his family, and on New Year’s
Day, 1872, participated in sports,
winning much renown for his jump
of 6 ft. 2 in., in which he beat the
aboriginal “Long Jimmy,” from
“Colinton,” whose best achievement
was 6 ft. He spent a truly glorious
six months at “Cressbrook,” being
in the saddle most of his time, and,
on the finely-bred horses, “Lantern”
and “Matty,” both by “Sailor”
(imp.), became a good bush rider,
and hunted kangaroos almost daily,
accompanied by a splendid pack of
dogs. Eventually he received his
commission as ensign of the 52nd
Regiment, and as an equivalent for
the loss of privilege referred to, the
Duke had kept his promise by ob-
taining for him and other Queen’s
cadets three years’ seniority over
those who had passed their examina-
tions at the same time. Mr. Somer-
set, however, had become enamoured
of the freedom and charm of bush
life, and while thanking the Duke
for his intervention declined the
commission, with the request that


his name might be left on the list,
with permission to serve in the event
of war breaking out against Great
Britain—a request that was com-
plied with. Applying himself to
the demands of the life he had
chosen, in 1874, accompanied by his
cousin, Arthur Somerset, he tra-
velled for sale 350 bulls out west
to the Barcoo, the trip occupying
over six months of the wettest season
ever known, which necessitated
swimming and the rafting of a wag-
gon with plant and stores over
every river and creek on the
route. Considerable ingenuity was
displayed by Mr. Somerset, who
carried pulley blocks and No.
8 fencing wire, also light sets
of blocks and tackle and big
iron rings, fishing lines, and light
long ropes. His method was for
one to swim over with the fishing
line, to which was attached the
light rope, the wire following. After
making the end of the wire fast,
pulleys and rings were reeved on
the wire, and the waggon was slung
across Ipaded with rations, etc. At
the Warrego River —where 30 bul-
lock teams were stuck up for months
—he borrowed galvanized washtubs,
with which he made a tub raft and
conveyed the waggon and stores
across; and at the Nive, which was
swift and full of tall, thin, flooded
gum trees, he camped a week and
literally built a bridge of wire, which
he covered with sandalwood faggots,
and was again successful in landing
his impedimenta safely on the fur-
ther side, swimming the stock across
lower down the stream. The flour
thus carried sold at Tambo for
2s. 6d. per lb. Riding back alone
with six horses from Barcoo to
Cressbrook, a distance of 700 miles,
Mr. Somerset was appointed to take
out the first mob of cattle to stock
“Mount Marlow” run, on the Lower
Barcoo. The cattle had been started,
and he caught them up at the
boundary of the “Cadarga” and
“Boondoona” runs, where he found
that many of the cows had dropped
their calves. He avoided taking
delivery, and, leaving the drover
asleep, caught a thoroughbred four-
year-cld mare, “Joan,” and gallop-
ing off at 9 p.m., passed “Burran-
dowan” at daylight and reached
“Cressbrook” at 9.30 p.m., having
done the 142-mile journey in 24|
hours, without rest or bite for man
or horse. With a dray to carry the
calves, he rejoined the mob, and
despite many delays, caused by the
calving of the cows along the road,
he arrived at length at “Mount
Marlow,” where he formed the sta-
tion, assisted by James McPherson,
“The Wild Scotchman,” formerly a
notorious bushranger, who had been
liberated from confinement by Sir
Maurice O’Connell, partly through
the advocacy of Mr. Somerset,
under whose father McPherson’s
father had served in the Indian
Mutiny. During the two years that
he managed “Mount Marlow” on
behalf of Mr. McConnel, Mr. Somer-
set had many adventures. On one
occasion he was out alone, tracking
strayed horses,* when his mare, gal-
loping at dawn through a gidya
scrub, jumped a fallen tree and
landed in an earth-crack, breaking
both her forelegs and pinning her
rider under her. Here he lay all
day until found at sundown by wild
blacks—one of whom proved to be
an aboriginal whose life he had saved
about a year previously—who car-
ried him about 16 miles into the
station, where his recovery from
hernia was accomplished in an acci-
dental manner by his being badly
slung in a hammock. When “Mount
Marlow” was sold in 1877 he started
alone for “Cressbrook” with 137 of
his own horses, and after two days
and nights of hard work disposed of
131 of these at “Ruthven” Station,
continuing his lonely journey with
six animals. Before leaving for
England about a year later he be-
came engaged to Mr. McConnel’s
eldest daughter (Katherine Rose),
whom he married at the British
Legation, Berne, Switzerland, in
July, 1879. Returning to Queens-
land, he accepted an engagement to
manage “Ramornie” Station and
Meatworks, on the Clarence River,
New South Wales, for the late C.
G. Tindal, and continued here from
June, 1880, to the close of 1885,
when he purchased “Bonshaw” and
“Gunyan” Stations for Mr. Tindal.
Subsequently, in April, 1886, he
took charge of “Gordon Brook”
Station, on the Clarence, for the
late Thomas Hawkins Smith, for two
years. In July, 1888, he secured,
under the 1884 Land Act, some
20,000 acres at Mount Stanley as
grazing farms, a re-survey of which
he succeeded in getting with con-
siderable difficulty, and at his own
expense, before he would comply
with the conditions relating to
fencing. As a result, many settlers
since have benefited by the altera-
tion of the survey regulations from
cardinal points to features of country
for grazing farms. His preparations
for the formation of a home at
Mount Stanley were completed
when, upon the suggestion of his
brother-in-law, an exchange of ter-
ritory was effected, Mr. Somerset
taking full possession of “Caboon-
bah” (5,000 acres), while 10,00 C
acres of Mount Stanley were used
by Mr. McConnel. Erecting a home-
stead, he came into residence dur-
ing March, 1890, and leasing ad-
joining country, initiated horse and
cattle raising on an extensive scale,
with Mount Stanley as a depot. Mr.
Somerset was one of the heavies!
sufferers by the great flood in Feb-
ruary, 1893, when the Stanley
River, owing to a rainfall of 36
inches in 24 hours at Crohamhurst,
on the Blackall Range, came down
like a wall over 50 ft. high, rising at
“Caboonbah” to 74 ft. 3 in., and
sweeping away 729 fat bullocks, be-
sides milch cows, draught horses,
and thoroughbred mares. The silt-
ing up of the Brisbane River de-
layed the ocean steamer in reaching
the meatworks, where he had 640
carcases in the freezing chambers,
and upon its arrival in England the
whole of the consignment had to be
thrown in the Channel. Mr. Somer-
set sent a horseman to Esk with a
telegram to the Postmaster-General
warning Brisbane and Ipswich of
the oncoming flood, and a fortnight
later, when the river rose again,
despatched a messenger to Cabool-
ture, the Esk telegraph lines having
been destroyed by the former flood.
“Caboonbah” subsequently was
made a flood-warning station, with
a telegraph line from “Cressbrook,”
the family operating the Morse in-
strument, which was in use for 8|
years, when a telephone service was
substituted. Owing to the losses sus-
tained through these floods Mr.
Somerset was forced to sell his
Mount Stanley grazing farms to
clear “Caboonbah” of unavoidable
debt. In 1903 the big drought again
threatened to play havoc with his
schemes, but as the river gradually
fell a healthy growth of flood couch
grass was exposed, which proved to
he the salvation of the stock and
that of the neighbouring farmers,
who by the generosity of Mr. Somer-
set were permitted to drive their
stock to the river-bed to crop the
herbage so providentially come by.
In 1904 he entered Parliament,
being returned as member for the
Stanley electorate after a stirring


contest at the polls. At the next
election he was again successful,
beating his former opponent and
another; was returned unopposed on
three successive occasions, and at
the election of 1915, in which he
again contested the seat, he scored
an easy victory. The pioneer farm-
ers of the Blackbutt district recog-
nize with lively gratitude the
services of Mr. Somerset, who by
his personal influence and exertions
obtained for them the extension of
the railway to Blackbutt, and
various other advantages. He was a
member of the Divisional Board and
Shire Council from 1890 to 1904,
being chairman in the latter year,
resigning these offices upon entering
Parliament. lie succeeded the late
J. H. McConnel as president of the
Esk-Toogoolawah Pastoral, Agricul-
tural, and Industrial Association,
and is a recognized judge of horses,
acting in this capacity for many
years at shows in Hew South Wales
and Queensland. Of his two sons
and six daughters, the eldest son,
Hollo, born in 1895, at the outbreak
of the present war enlisted as a pri-
vate and took part in the Gallipoli
campaign, afterwards proceeding as
2nd lieutenant to France, and being
concerned in the glorious taking of
Pozieres, where, he writes, his bat-
talion w r ent through the Germans,
licking them up as a bush fire does
grass. He received promotion to
lieutenant, Ist Battalion, A.1.F.,
and is now (1917) acting-adjutant to
his colonel. He received the Military
Cross “for conspicuous gallantry in
action. He led two attacks against

“CECIL PLAINS” Station, on
the Darling Downs, was originally
taken up by Messrs. Henry Stuart
Russell and Gerald Brooks in 1841,
and can claim the distinction of
being one of the first pastoral runs
formed in Queensland. It is splen-
didly watered, both by subartesian
sources and by the Condamine and
North Branch Rivers, which flow
through the estate for a distance of
about 14 miles. Numerous wells
supplement the natural supply, and
even in seasons of the severest
drought the water has never been
known to fail. The average rainfall
for the district over a period of 25
years was 28’570 in., the highest
record for one year being 44’730,
and the lowest H’47o. Two-thirds
cf the soil vary from a rich loam to
the heavier kinds of black soil, and
among the many natural grasses
which flourish freely there are no
noxious weeds; while other pests,
such as rabbits, are also conspicu-
ous by their absence. The carrying
capacity of the holding in normal
seasons is about 90,000 sheep, 2,000
cattle, and 400 horses, and the area
is excellently suited to mixed-farm-
ing and agricultural purposes, both
by reason of its rich soil and abund-
ant water supply. "Cecil Plains”

cipally as a cattle run, the opinion
then prevailing being that the terri-
tory was unsuited to sheep, and the

latter class of stock was not intro-
duced upon the run until 1865. In
1850 Mr. Russell, who was then sole
proprietor, was joined in partnership
by the late Hon. James Taylor,
M.L.C., who ultimately bought him
out in 1859. The property remained
in the hands of the Taylor family
until it was purchased for purposes
of closer settlement by the Queens-
land Government for the sum of
£242,000. At the time this transfer
was effected' the original area had
been reduced by about half, and the
run now comprises some 130,000
acres, of which 100,000 acres is open
black soil plain, interspersed with
clumps of shade timber, heavily
grassed in summer with blue and oat
grasses, which give way to a pro-
lific crop of herbage in winter. There
are wide stretches eminently adapted
to wheatgrowing and to lucerne,
and it is probable that when the
area is occupied by settlers the
greater part of it will be devoted to
the production of cereals and other
crops, and to mixed farming. A
line of railway stretching from
Oakey on the western route to
Evanslea has already been con-
structed, and at no distant time will
be extended to “Cecil Plains,” Par-
liament already having passed a Bill
of authorization. The late Hon.
James Taylor, M.L.C., whose death
occurred at Toowoomba on October
19, 1895, was one of the oldest
pioneers on the Darling Downs, and
at the time of his death was largely
interested in pastoral properties,
being the owner of “Mount Marlow”
and other large holdings in addi-
tion to “Cecil Plains.” He repre-
sented the constituencies of Drayton
and Toowoomba in the Legislative
Assembly for several years, and was
first called to the Legislative Council
in 1871, and afterwards in 1881,
remaining a member until August,
1893, when he resigned on account
of ill-health. “Cecil Plains” owed
much of its successful development
to the energy and ability of Mr.
James Taylor, the present chairman
of the Taylor Estates Company,
Limited, and the only surviving son
of the late James Taylor. This
gentleman was born at Toowoomba
in 1860, and received his education
at the Brisbane Grammar School.
He was brought up to pastoral
pursuits, and for many years was
actively engaged on “Cecil Plains.”
Mr. Taylor has held office as vice-
president of the Royal Agricultural
Society of Queensland, treasurer of
the Darling Downs Pastoralists’
Association, and president of the
Toowoomba Turf Club.
TINDAL & SON. The firm of
Tindal & Son owns the following
properties, viz.: —“Ramornie” and
“Newbold,” on the Clarence River,
New South Wales; “Gunyan,”
“Bonshaw,” and “Trigamon,” in the
vicinity of Texas, the boundaries
of which enclose land both in
Queensland and New South Wales;
and “Albany Downs,” on the
Maranoa River, Queensland. The
founder of the firm was the late
Charles Grant Tindal, who died at
Eversley, Hampshire, in January,
1914, in his ninetieth year, after a
long, eventful, and useful life. His
father was well known in Birming-
ham, where he was a leading citizen


for many years and manager of
the Bank of England in that
city. He had previously served
in the Navy, in which he
reached the rank of captain,

being several times mentioned in
despatches for exploits in the war
with France, and after leaving the
Navy he was for some years manager
of large silver mines in Mexico. His
father’s brother, Sir Nicolas Tindal,
was also well known as an able law-
yer, and latterly as Chief Justice of
the Court of Petty Pleas. The late
Mr. Tindal was educated at King
Edward’s School, Birmingham, and
after the close of his scholastic
career he spent a year or two
on a large farm, in the early
forties sailing for Australia. On
arrival he first visited an old
naval friend of his father, Captain
Ogilvie, R.N., at Merton, on the
Hunter River, soon after joining
that gentleman’s son, the late Hon.
E. D. Ogilvie, at “Yulgilbar,” a
station he had lately taken up on
the Clarence River. Here Mr. Tin-
dal gained his “colonial experience,”
after which he did some exploring
and droving in what is now
Queensland, and later on bought
“Koreelah,” at the head of the
Clarence, where for some years
he led a very strenuous life,
facing dangers and hardship with
a courage that gradually brought
its reward. At this time he
was his own fencer, horsebreaker,
and bullock-driver, and old hands
have testified to the writer that in
each capacity there were few to equal
him. Whilst at “Koreelah” he was
joined by his brother Frederick, a
kindred spirit. Leaving his brother
at “Koreelah” he bought “Ramor-
nie,” lower down the Clarence, about
18 miles above Grafton (then known
as "The Settlement”). After selling
“Koreelah” about 1855, he paid a
visit to England, bringing back a
wife in 1856, a sister of Messrs.
Smith and Rhoderick Travers, who
afterwards came out and owned re-
spectively “Gordon Downs” and
“Aramac.” During his absence un-
happily his brother had been drowned
while crossing the river at the dan-
gerous Eatonsville Falls, and it is a
strange coincidence that both his
other brothers were drowned while
on their way to join him, one in
the “Duncan Dunbar” and one in a
schooner at the Clarence Heads.

MR. ChARLES FREDERICK TINDAL.
About 1862 Mr. and Mrs. Tindal,
with four children, went to England,
and while there Mr. Tindal suc-
ceeded in forming the Australian
Meat Company, with a view to start-
ing meat-canning works at “Ramor-
nie,” and also making Liebig’s Ex-
tract, having secured directions for
so doing from the inventor, the old
Baron Liebig. Leaving his family
in the Old Country, Mr. Tindal re-
turned to Australia, and with the
assistance of the late Mr. T. Cord-
ingley, and later of Mr. A. Gee
(both since well known in the meat
export and preserving trade), he
started the meat works at “Ramor-
nie,” which from 1866 to 1915
worked without exception for several
months each year, killing in one or
two seasons as many as 19,000 head,
but usually about 5,000. Although
not absolutely the first to can beef
in Australia, the company was the
first to make a commercial success of
the business and the first to make
extract by Liebig’s process. After
starting the works in Australia, Mr.
Tindal returned to England as the
London manager of the company,
and thereafter spent most of Iris life
in England, though he and his
family came out in 1879 and re-
mained for two years, and again
in 1886, on this trip remain-
ing nearly four years. Mr. Tindal
was always an enthusiastic lover of
good stock, and began importing
good bulls and horses as soon as he
“found his feet” at “Ramornie. '
Among the numerous thoroughbred
horses he imported were “Pitsford”
(winner of the Two Thousand
Guineas and second to “Voltigenr”
in the Derby), “Livingston,” and
“Jack Spring” (both well-known
performers and fashionably bred),
and “Warlike” and “Reugny”
(winner of the Liverpool Grand
National). He also bought “Sir
Hercules” and “Cassandra,” and
from their union bred “Yattendon,”
who was foaled at “Ramornie” in a
paddock named after his dam, and
who in his time was the most success-
ful sire in Australia. “Sir Her-
cules” was over 20 years old when
“Yattendon” was foaled (as was

“Cassandra”), but was again sold,
and, it is believed, served several
seasons more. About 1854 Mr. Tin-
dal imported a Suffolk stallion
named “Essex,” the first of many


others of this breed, several of which
(notably “Rendlesham Sprightly”)
were prize-takers at leading English
shows. About 1889 the “Ramornie”
Devon herd was started, and has
been kept as a small but very choice

of quality and constitution, com-
bined with considerable size. Only

and other English shows), and at pre-
sent (1917) two wonderfully fine bulls

ling anything that does not reach
a very high standard. These Here-
fords are specially remarkable for
the excellence of the hind-quarter,
once a weak point in the breed. The
stud was founded by the purchase of
12 heifers bred by the Auckland
Stud Company of New Zealand, all
of which subsequently produced
calves sired by the stud bull “Stu-
dent,” bred by the same company.
These picked heifers were descended
from cows imported from Great
purchased by Mr. Elwyn. In 1891
another 15 heifers were secured from
“Tocal,” these being lineal descen-
dants of such well-known Herefords
as “Minerva,” “Last Day,”
“Venus,” “Fancy,” “Lioness,”
and “Orphan Lassie,” imported by
the great breeder, Mr. Charles Rey-
nolds, and later the stud was further
increased by the advent of 20 choice
young cows from the property of Mr.
R. Wyndham, of “Leconfield,” on
the Hunter River. Among this last
lot were “Elsie Wilton II.” (hy

and winner of four first prizes in
England, was also selected and
despatched to Australia by the fine
old pastoralist, whose interest in his
Antipodean enterprise continued un-
abated. This bull was followed from
“Big Ben” (by “Westminster,”

imported cows, was purchased by


Messrs. Tindal & Son in 1913 from
Mr. Anthony Hordern, of “Milton

together with 10 calves, all by
“Shraden Welcome,” which noted

Tanner. “Shraden Welcome” is by
“Commandant” (E.H.H.B. 22044),
dam “Prunella 111th,” by “States-
man” (E.H.H.B. 14938). The cows
were:—(l) “Beauty II.,” bred by

sire “Major Homo” (20179), dam
“Beauty,” by “Snowdrift” (20338),

at the present time are “Wonder

ney in 1911, bred by Mr. Frank Rey-
nolds and purchased by Tindal and
Son for 330 guineas; “Sir Edgar,”
also “local” bred, first prize, Syd-
ney, in the same year, for two-year-

J. A. Beattie and sold by him to the
“Mayflower,” imported by the
Auckland Stud Company. Perhaps
the best cow at “Gunyan” at the
present time (February, 1917) is the
imported cow “Lady the 94th.” She
is an enormous cow, of great length
and full of quality, and her record
for the last four years is as follows:

stud herd, at the time of writ-
ing, consists of about 500 breeding
cattle, all of which are already
registered in the Australian Stud
Book, or are eligible for inclu-
sion therein. A few well-handled,
stabled stud bulls are always kept
ready for the inspection of stock-
holders, and only the progeny of
picked pedigreed cows are offered for
sale by Mr. Elwyn, who sees eye to
eye with the owners of the stud in
the matter of making a close study


to maintain the high reputation of
what is generally admitted to be one
of the finest, if not the finest, stud
herd in Australia. The average
number of bulls bred annually, ex-
clusive of the 12 to 15 per centage of
careful rejections made by the mana-
ger—whose object is to produce
Herefords of strong constitution
and robust build —is 160, and for
these there is no lack of buyers,
who are principally Queenslanders,
though a number of small lots of
cattle are sent to stations in New
England, the Clarence River, and
other parts of the Mother State. So
popular indeed are the “Gunyan”
cattle that it is no unusual thing for
the stock of over 14 or 15 months
to be quite cleared out, and though

1879, Mr. Tindal turned his atten-
tion to pastoral matters, and after
a brief sojourn at ‘‘Aramac,”
Queensland, proceeded to “Ramor-
nie,” where, after a few years of
experience gained under the guid-
ance of the former manager of the
meatworks, Mr. H. P. Somerset,
M.L.A., he assumed control of the
concern, becoming general manager
on behalf of his father in Australia.
In 1911 the late Mr. C. G. Tindal
transferred all his Australian pro-
perties to Mr. C. F. Tindal, following
which the latter took up his residence
at Armidale, New South Wales,
which he finds a convenient centre
from which to administer his business

tives of the stud, all agree that the
hallmark of pure-breeding is stamped
clearly upon every bull or heifer

pastures with a desirable type of
stock, creditable to Australia and
distinguishing the property upon
which it has been bred as a
thoroughly well-managed and up-to-
date proposition. The rejected males
of the stud are converted into steers,
and the females are turned into the
common herd to become breeders
of beef cattle. For convenience

are also found in the near vicinity.
With the exception of “Albany
Downs”—an area of 200 square
miles 50 miles from Mitchell, which
is used to raise stores for fattening
at “Gunyan”—all the estates are
devoted almost exclusively to the
breeding of high-class stud cattle,
and to the fattening of bullocks
for the beef markets. CHARLES
FREDERICK TINDAL, the pre-
sent principal of the firm of Tindal
and Son, is a native of New South
AVales. He was born at “Ramornie”
in November, 1857, and received his
affairs and occasionally visit his
estates on the border, the manage-
ment of which he entrusts entirely
to the capable hands of Mr. Elwyn.
Mr. Tindal married his second
cousin, Edith, daughter of the late
Rev. Henry Tindal, of Frankton,
near Rugby, England, by whom he
had a family of five sons. Of these,
the eldest (Charles Henry) and
the youngest (Arthur) in 1916
enlisted for war service in Eng-
land, the fourth (Nicolas) is
fighting in France, and the second
(Archibald Arthur) was killed in
action in France in September, 1916.
The third son (Travers) died in Eng-
land some years ago. Mr. C. H.
Tindal, prior to volunteering, man-
aged ‘‘Ramornie.” He married in


December, 1912, Gladys, daughter
of Mr. Sholto Cay, of Mack’s
Creek, Queensland, and has one
son and one daughter. The late
Mr. A. A. Tindal, pre-
vious to donning khaki,
was sub - manager at
“Gunyan.” He married
in June, 1912, Dorothy,
eldest daughter of the
late V enerable Arch-
deacon Moxon, of Graf-
ton, New South Wales,
and had issue a son and
a daughter. At the time
of his death he was a
second lieutenant in the
R.F.A., and saw five
months’ active service at
the Front. The Queens-

Tindal & Son, Mr. Her-
bert Fraser Elwyn, to
whom must be accorded
the honour of founding
and building up one of
the best Hereford stud

tralia as a youth in 1878, and pro-
ceeding to “Ramornie” acquired his
to the position of overseer of the
meatworks, a post he held for four
years. In 1886 he became manager
of “Gunyan” and the other newly-
acquired border stations
of the firm of Tindal and
Son, and has since de-
voted his energies exclu-
sively to the building up
of the firm’s interests,
especially distinguishing
himself by his good work
in connection with the
founding and developing
of the famous Hereford
stud herd. Mr. Elwyn
has made his place, not
only in pastoral circles,
but equally in the hearts
of the people with whom
he has been most closely
associated in the country
of his adoption. He takes

medical practitioner, Mr. De Burgh
Persse joined the Imperial Military
Forces, being gazetted to the 22nd
Regiment, in which he received his
commission without either examina-
tion or purchase in virtue of his
being a graduate of Trinity College,
and also in recognition of deeds of
valour performed at the time of the
Indian Mutiny by his paternal
uncle, Colonel William Persse, who
served for many years with the 16th
Lancers in this portion of Her
Majesty’s dominions, and whose
name lives to-day in the memory of
the younger officers of that memor-
able campaign still surviving, and
by tradition among the troops who
inherit the glory and honour won
for British arms by heroes who
counted not the cost of valour in a
bygone age. Early in his career Mr.
De Burgh Persse was brought into
intercourse with the late Sir John
Young, then Governor of the State
of New South AVales, and hearing
from him good reports of Queens-
land, which about that time had
secured her rights as an independent
colony, became inspired with the
desire to try his fortune in this wild
free country, where the extension of
the British Empire was being
pushed on by methods of peace which
“hath her victories no less renowned

than war.” Accordingly, throwing
up his commission, he straightway
took passage for the land of the
Southern Cross by the sailing vessel
“Golden City,” arriving at Moreton
Bay on March 5, 1863. Faced with


the worthy problem of how best to
command success in a country to the
conditions of which he was abso-
lutely a stranger, Mr. De Burgh
Persse accepted an invitation to join
MR. BURTON PERSSE, MASTER OF GALWAY HOUNDS, IRELAND.
a party proceeding to Rockhampton
for the purpose of taking up country
suitable for pastoral purposes on
Isaac and Connor Rivers. This
party was composed of several noted
pioneers, viz., Messrs. McKenzie,
McHenry, Wheeler, McArthur,
and John Hardy, all seasoned vet-
erans of the bush, who made small
account of the hardships of the way,
which were sufficient to daunt any
novice built of less tenacious fibre
than the young Irishman of 22, who
on this trip was gaining his first
taste of “colonial experience” under
somewhat drastic conditions. Rain
fell incessantly day after day and
night after night; the boiling of the
billy was an operation fraught with
some difficulty, and any precon-
ceived ideas of a prolonged and
delightful picnic which may have
been indulged in by the newcomer
were speedily dispelled. The long
hours of droving while it was
light and 6 hours of watching
when darkness came on, seemed
endless, while the precious interval
devoted to slumber appeared to pass
like a flash. Though battling with
all his might to “see it through,”
Mr. De Burgh Persse at length was
prostrated by an attack of fever and
ague which compelled him to give
in, and the party, by this time
having run short of provisions, and
being reduced to living from hand
to mouth on whatever the locality
might provide in the way of food,
it was thought expedient that he
should return to more civilized
regions where he could obtain proper
nourishment and regain his strength
without any further throwbacks.
Accordingly he returned to Brisbane
v i a Rockhampton, where he recouped
his lost vigour, and nothing daunted
prepared to set forth on further
adventures in the bush country. This
time his objective was the Maranoa
district, where he had decided to
take a position as rouseabout on “Tei-
eryboo” Station, wisely concluding
that the practical knowledge he
could gain in this capacity would be
worth much to him when his turn
came to make an independent bid
for fortune in the direction of pas-
toral enterprise in his adopted
country. Having placed his “new-
chum” days far behind him and
obtained a grip of the best methods
of handling stock and conducting
station affairs generally, which
would have done credit to a far more
experienced hand, Mr. De Burgh
Persse in January, 1864, relin-
quished his duties on this property
and once more found his way to the
capital, shortly afterwards being
offered by the Bank of Australasia
the management of “Tambourine”
Station, on the Albert River, which
he accepted, taking up his duties on
March 17 of that year. After con-
trolling affairs successfully here for
about 12 months, on behalf of the
above institution he disposed of the
property to the late Captain Wil-
liams, and almost immediately was
appointed by the bank to the man-
agement of “Maroon” Station, at
the head of the river, which he
retained fgr some time. After the
sale of this station to the late Hon.
Thomas Lodge Murray-Prior, Mr.
De Burgh Persse became inspector
of pastoral properties for the same

financial authorities, and continued
to act in this capacity until his pur-
chase of “Tabragalba” on Septem-
ber 4, 18G5, by which act he
inaugurated his association with


pastoral enterprise on his own ac-
count, which has continued for
over half a century. He was
one of the first in Queensland

having done so at “Tabragal-
ba” and at most stations in the
Logan and Albert districts as far
back as 1866. Having brought
“Tabragalba” into good working
order, Mr. De Burgh Persse placed
it under the care of an experienced
manager, and in November, 1870,
he returned to his native land,
and spent a pleasant sojourn at
the old family seat in Ireland.
In November of the following year
his marriage took place, and August,
1872, saw him once more bound for
the “Queen’s Own Land,” which
now lay very near to hie heart. A
few months later he made a journey
to the western district, beyond
Bowen Downs, for the purpose of
taking up further territory, that he
might the more largely identify
himself with the industry in which
all his interests were centred. In
this intention, however, he was
temporarily thwarted, the object of
his desire, “Cork” Station, on the
Diamantina River, having already
attracted the attention of another
pastoralist, who had lost no time in
securing the prize for himself. In
1874 Mr. Persse went out to
“Kyabra” Station, on the Cooper,
and thence to Farrar Creek, where
his venture was crowned by the
acquisition of a large tract of
country, one portion of which
became known under the appellation
of "Connemara,” and the remainder
as “Palparara,” both of which
names were bestowed by their
pioneer proprietor. The blacks were
very numerous in this locality, and
prior to the advent of Mr. De Burgh
Persse had never seen a white man.
MR. DE BURGH PERSSE WITH HOUNDS IN IRELAND, 1873.
Keeping “Tabragalba,” his present
home, as a centre from which he
stocked the new properties with
cattle of his own breeding, the
young squatter continued to cast his
eyes over the promising open coun-
try in the remoter districts, which
only awaited development by the
hand of man to yield rich results
as first-class pastoral territory, and
in the course of time he founded
“Tally-ho” Station, on the Mayne
River, a tributary of the Diaman-
tina, which he named in accordance
with his traditions as a sporting
gentleman, and subsequently took up
yet more virgin country in “Buck-
ingham Downs,” on the Burke and
Wills Rivers, where the surplus
stock from “Tabragalba” again
found new and excellent pastures.
“Lake De Burgh,” called by the
explorer Favenc “Nothing in Sight,”
was a later acquisition, this station
afterwards being held by Mr. John
Costello, while the various other
rune by degrees were disposed of to
prominent stock and station men,
“Buckingham Downs” passing into
the hands of Messrs. Goldsbrough,
Mort, & Co., “Palparara” to Mr.
Herbert Hughes, and “Connemara”
to Messrs. Cox & Dowling. “Hawk-
wood” and “Yerallay” (also known
as “Rocky Springs”) he still retains,
in addition to the home property
“Tabragalba,” the second of these
being under the management of his
eldest son, who resides upon the
station. In 1880 Mr. De Burgh
Persse again revisited his homeland,
and spent nearly two years at Castle


Lambert, County Galway, making
himself an fait with all the condi-
tions of life under which a country
gentleman in Ireland rode and

when upon the death of his eldest
brother, he was recalled to Ireland,
and for three years filled the posi-
tion of head of the family at Moyode
Castle, taking his brother’s place as
the life and soul of the district.
Among the most honourable and
important of the posts he held as a
landed proprietor in Ireland was
that of Master of the Galway
Blazers, an office occupied in turn
by many of his predecessors at the
castle. For two years he wielded the
horn, and upon his resignation the
hunt club, in general meeting
assembled, resolved and placed upon
record “the sportsmanlike, liberal,
and princely manner in which he has
hunted the County Galway hounds
for two seasons, 1889-90 and 1890-1.”
The record also stated “he came for-
ward and accepted the mastership
at a period when the affairs of the
hunt were in much confusion, and
the pack of hounds much deterior-
ated. Notwithstanding this, during
the two seasons he was master, he
showed unrivalled sport, and by his
liberality and sportsmanlike ability
resuscitated the fame of the world-
renowned Blazers, and raised the
pack to its present standard of
excellence”; to which are added
other remarks of a highly compli-
mentary character. The serious
drought of 1892 brought Mr. Persse
back to Queensland, when he again

he resigned from the House. He
was one of the founders of the Royal
Bank of Queensland, which opened
its doors in 1886, and held a seat
on the directorate for many years.
In commercial circles he is widely
known as one of the founders of the
Queensland Meat Export and
Agency Company, Limited, of which
concern he has been a director for
over 20 years, at the present time
being chairman of the company.
He started the Cold Storage Com-
pany at Singapore, which is univer-
sally admitted to be the most suc-
cessful concern of its kind in the
East; is president of the Logan and
Albert Agricultural Pastoral Soci-
ety, in the foundation of which he
played a prominent part; and takes
a* keen interest in the affairs of the
Raub Australian Gold Mining
Company, of which he is chairman,
personally visiting the mine on
various occasions. Mr. He Burgh
Persse is an ardent sportsman, and
besides being president of the Logan
and Albert Jockey Club, which he
assisted to found, he is a member
and trustee of the Queensland Turf
Club, much of the credit of secur-
ing from the Government of the day
the site of the present course being
attributable to him. He is also the
oldest member of the Queensland
Club, besides being connected with
a number of other organizations of
a social, charitable, or literary
nature. Mr. De Burgh Persse mar-
ried in 1871 Mary Persse Blair,
daughter of the late William Blair,
of Cappa, Kilrush, County Clare,
Ireland, a well-known Scottish mer-
chant, who on his retirement settled
in Ireland, the issue being two sons
and three daughters. The eldest
son, Charles Dudley, married Violet
Vivian Parry-Oakden, daughter of
Mr. Parry-Oakden, formerly Com-
missioner of Police in Queensland,
and has one son and one daughter;
the second son, De Burgh Persse,
married Fanny, daughter of the late
Hon. R. M. Collins, of “Tamroo-
kum” Station, the issue being two
sons and twin daughters. His eldest
daughter married Mr. Edgar Joyce,
of “The Overflow” Station, Beau-

daughters; Eileen, the second
daughter, married Fitz-Pierce Joyce,
of Eidsvold, and has three daugh-
ters and three sons; the third daugh-
ter, Jessie Madeline, being the wife
of Mr. C. S. Delpratt, of “Tam-

Mrs. He Burgh Persse reside
when in Queensland, is situated
some four miles from Beaude-
sert, the homestead, which was built
in 1864, being surrounded by some
14,000 acres of rich, undulating
pasture land, varied by valleys and
mountainous country, which is
copiously watered by running creeks,
billabongs, and sparkling springs.
Built throughout of cedar, the
homestead is very spacious, contain-

MR. THOMAS B. MURRAY-PRIOR.
Murray-Prior is freely interwoven
with the history of the State, Mr.

Honourable Thomas Lodge Murray-

and “'Bromelton” Stations. Born at
Wells Somerset, England, in 1819,
he came to Sydney, New South
Wales, in 1839, subsequently settling
in Queensland, where he became first
Departmental Posmaster-General for
the colony, which position he held
for about five years. After the
separation of Queensland from New
South Wales he was Postmaster-
General in the second Herbert Minis-
try (July 21 to August 7, 1866),
and held the same office in the
Mackenzie Ministry (August 15,
1867, to November 25, 1868), and
the Palmer Ministry (May 3, 1870,
to January 8, 1874). He was
appointed to the Legislative Council
in February, 1866, succeeding the
Hon. D. F. Roberts as Chairman of
Committees on July 31, 1889, and
in the absence of the President of
the Council, Sir Arthur Palmer, he
frequently occupied this position.
Lie died on December 31, 1892. His
son, the late T. de M. Murray-Prior,
father of the gentleman under review,
who succeeded to the properties,
evinced considerable interest in
matters of public moment, and in
1902 was elected to represent Fassi-
fern district in the House of
Assembly, a seat he was destined to
fill for but a brief period, as within
a few months of his election he
joined the great majority. The late
gentleman, who was a Queenslander
by birth, enjoyed a wide reputation
as a breeder of prize stock, his short-
horn cattle and Arab horses carry-
ing off many of the most coveted
honours of the day. He owned the

Arab stallion '‘Pathfinder,” at the
time one of the best-known horses
in Queensland, and also imported
from India “Trojan,” another noted
Arab sire, both of which accounted
for prize stock of the highest quality.
The subject of our review was edu-
cated at Armidale, New South
Wales, where he continued until 18
years of age. Upon the conclusion
of his studies he returned to
“Maroon” Station, and 12 months
later, upon the death of his father,
when he was appointed one of the
trustees of the estate, he became
manager until the property, which
originally comprised 10,000 acres,
was sold for purposes of closer settle-
ment. The old homestead, with 600
acres of land, was retained by Mr.
Murray-Prior, who carries on the
old name, which is one of the links
in the chain of historic associations
connected with its picturesquely
wooded hills and well-grassed pas-
ture lands. This area has been
devoted by the present owner prin-
cipally to the breeding of shorthorn
cattle from stock originally intro-
duced by his late father from the
“M.C.” stud, and a number of short-
horn cows imported from New
Zealand, the progeny from which
have been frequent prizewinners at
Brisbane shows. Mr. Murray-Prior
has still further improved this excel-
lent breed by the introduction of
strains of the highest class from the
most noted studs in other States of
the Commonwealth, and at the pre-
sent time the breeding herd consists
of about 50 cows of the finest short-
horn type. In addition to this

Prior has recently been giving some
attention to mixed farming on
“Maroon,” and confidently antici-
pates good results from this depar-
ture. He holds the Commission of
the Peace, is a member of the
Goolman Shire Council, and a
committeeman of the Boonah Agri-
cultural Society. In 1911 he was
married to a daughter of Dr. FI. M.
Lightoller, of Brisbane, and has
two sons and one daughter.
The late JOHN ARTHUR
MACARTNEY, F.R.G.S., who died
at Ormiston, near Cleveland, on
July 10, 1917, was well known
as an explorer and one of the most
prominent pioneer pastoralists of
Central Queensland and the North-
ern Territory, having owned at one
time or another as many as 32 sta-
tion properties in these districts and
Victoria. He was born at “Creagh
Glebe,” between Baltimore and Skib-
bereen, in the South of Ireland, on
April 5, 1834, and came of distin-
guished parentage, his paternal
grandfather, Sir John Macartney,

M.P., of the last Irish Parliament,
First Baronet of Lish, having
received the honour of knighthood
in recognition of his exertions in
promoting the inland navigation of
Ireland, the baronetcy being con-
ferred by George 111. on January 4,
1799. Sir John was born on March
9, 1747, and married firstly Anne,
daughter of Edward Scriven, a
descendant of the Barclays, of Urie,
Scotland, the issue of this union
being three daughters and four sons.
After the death of this lady he
married Catherine, daughter of the
Rt. Hon. Hussey de Burgh, Lord

Chief Baron of Ireland, by whom he
had one son and one daughter. His
fifth son, Hussey Burgh, father of
John Arthur Macartney, and well-
known in later years as the Very
Rev. H. B. Macartney, D.D., first
Dean of Melbourne, which office he
held for 50 years, was born on
April 10, 1799, and on March 7,
1833, married Jane, daughter of
Edward Hardman, of County Louth,
Ireland, by whom he had three
sons and five daughters. He died at
Melbourne in 1894. For generations
the Macartneys were residents of
Belfast, and took a prominent part
in the government of that town; and
it is interesting to record that
between the years 1613 and 1843
members of this family on no less
than 31 occasions held the office of
Sovereigns of Belfast, this being in
those days the title of the chief
magistrate of the city. The family
arms are : Or, a stag trippant, within
a bordure, gu; crest, a hand holding
a slip of a rose tree, with three roses
thereon; mottoes, Stimulat sed

John Arthur Macartney received his
early education at Lucan School,
and subsequently under the Rev.
Dan. Flynn, D.D., in Harcourt
Street, Dublin. In his fourteenth
year he was brought to Australia by
his father, who accompanied Bishop
Perry, the first bishop appointed to
establish the See of Melbourne : and
for a time he lived with his cousins,
the Greenes, of Woodlands, at their
home about 15 miles from Mel-
bourne, and continued his studies
with them under the supervision of a
private tutor. Subsequently he went
with his relatives to “Glenwillan,”
a station belonging to the Greene
family in the Wimmera district, to
see the shearing, and whilst there
gained a good deal of valuable
experience in connection with gen-
eral station life, in association with
his cousin, Mr. Rawdon Greene, who
at a later date became interested in
“Peak Downs” and other country in
Queensland, and who died at New-
mayer Valley, in the Gulf of
Carpentaria. Mr. Macartney next
entered the office of Sir Charles
Sladen, attorney, of Geelong, after-
wards Treasurer of Victoria, but

uncongenial to his tastes, he relin-
quished his connection after 12
months, and for a time moved about
the country, picking up a consider-
able amount of useful knowledge in
his wanderings to and fro. When the
Victorian gold diggings broke out in


December, 1851, he purchased a
horse and dray, a cradle, stores, etc.,
and started for the fields, taking
with him a midshipman, Mr. Rowe
(a “new chum”), a brother-in-law
to Dr. Magee (Bishop of Peter-
borough) and an old Tasmanian con-
vict. His objective was Golden
Gully, Fryer Creek, and Mount
Alexander (now known as Castle-
maine), which, were booming, a few
diggers making fortunes with find-
ings of from one to two pounds of
gold per day, while unless a man
got over 2 oz. of gold per load
he threw up his claim in disgust,

then Attorney-General for Victoria,
who was a connection of Mr.
Macartney’s family; and subse-
quently accompanied Judge Barry
on several circuits, in the course of
which he gained considerable legal
experience. One case which created
deep interest at the time was the
trial of four out of 20 men who had
robbed the s.s. “Nelson” of from
68,000 to 70,000 ozs. of gold just as
the vessel was leaving Hobson’s Bay
for London. Against these Judge
Barry pronounced a sentence of 15
years’ imprisonment. In the Geelong
circuit Captain Butler, a notorious
bushranger, was tried on three
account, his father securing for him
a property called “Wandillygong,”
situated on the Ovens and Buckland
Rivers, which had been taken up by
the late James Tyson some 10
years previously for Mr. Buckland,
whose stock in the Riverton district
was suffering severely from drought.
This station not meeting with the
young pastoralist’s approval, he dis-
posed of it as part payment for
another property lower down the
Ovens River, about 22 miles from
Wangaratta, called “Warronly,”
and here at that early period he
frequently entertained such men as

was wont to relate how after
a shower of rain it was an
easy matter to fill a matchbox
with small pieces of gold from
the mounds of earth thrown out
from the claims. Whilst still per-
sisting in the rough life of the gold-
fields he received from Mr. (after-
wards Sir) Redmond Barry, who had
just been appointed to a judgeship,
an offer of the position of associate,
at a salary of £250 per annum, which
he accepted, being at that time
between 17 and 18 years of age. He
was coached for his new duties
by Sir William Foster Stawell,
separate charges of bushranging, for
which he received a sentence of 11
years on each separate charge, mak-
ing a total of 33 years, a feature of
the pronouncement being that at the
beginning of each term of 11 years
he should spend three years in irons.
It was commonly reported that
Butler was the victim of great
brutality on the part of his guards,
from which he released himself by
jumping overboard from a hulk at
Williamstown, thus securing deliver-
ance by death. After he had spent
about 18 months with Judge Barry,
Mr. Macartney turned his attention

Featherstonhaugh (police magistrate
at the Buckland, and father of the
well-known Mr. Cuthbert Feather-
stonhaugh), and many other Govern-
ment officers, who thoroughly enjoyed
a week-end at the hospitable home-
stead thrown open to them. In
1857, having endeavoured with-
out success to secure suitable
pastoral holding in the Riverina
district, Mr. Macartney decided to
go farther afield, and entering into
partnership with Mr. E. G. Mayne,
of Beechworth, he started in Sep-
tember of that year on a trip of


inspection of the more sparsely
settled northern areas of what was
then the immense colony of New
South Wales. Voyaging up the coast
by the S. S.
“B o o merang,”
they reached the
mouth of the
Brisbane River
on October 4,
but being
stranded on a
mudbank did
not arrive in
Brisbane until
the following

at a small hotel,
Mr. Macartney
stayed a week
in the infant
city, where he
first made the
acquaintance of
Mr. and Mrs.
James Leith

wards Colonel)
Feez, and others,
with whom he
subsequently became very intimate.
Purchasing a couple of horses,
he took them by steamer to

visit to Moreton Bay; and after
making his way up the Burnett
River to Gladstone, or, as it was
then called, Port Curtis, he dined on
Christmas Day, 1857, at Barney
Point, with the Government Resi-
dent, Captain (afterwards Sir)
Maurice O’Connell, who owned
“Riverston” Station. Captain O’Con-
nel possessed a number of fine, well-
bred horses, which he utilized for
running the mail between Mary-
borough and Gladstone, then a fort-
nightly service. In those days almost
all the country taken up was occupied
“Mount Larcombe,” “Raglan,” and
“Gracemere,” receiving a cordial
welcome at the last-mentioned sta-
tion from the Messrs. Archer (Colin,
William, and James), who kept open
house, and had a wide reputation for
hospitality. Making “Gracemere”
his headquarters for a few days,
during the first week in January,
1858, Mr. Macartney, in company
with Mr. George Murray (later
Police Magistrate of Brisbane), Mr.
John Murray, and Mr. Dan. Con-
nor, rode into what is now the
flourishing centre of Rockhampton,
“Canoona,” and here he fell in with
a Mr. Campbell, who had applied
for the area of country afterwards
known as “Waverley,” and owned
by the subject of this sketch for close
on 40 years. Mr. Macartney went
out with him to inspect the run, and
the upshot of the occasion was that
Mr. Campbell agreed to transfer all
his interests in the land to his com-
panion, and “Waverley” became Mr.
Macartney’s property. Shortly after-
wards he started on his return
journey to Sydney, and en route
purchased about 3.000 ewes at

farther north were there any fences,
the whole of the land lying open,

Berry was part-owner and manager,
giving from 7s. to 10s. per head.
After visiting the New South Wales
capital, where he purchased another


horse for his own use, Mr. Macartney
returned to Queensland, and being
unable to stock his property at the
moment, on account of its some-
what remote position, he made

arrangements with Messrs. Ramsay
and Gaden to allow him to depasture
his sheep on “Canoona,” in the con-
sideration of his erecting huts and
yards. The opening up of the
Canoona goldfield had occurred
during his absence in Sydney, and
when, assisted by Sir John Macart-
ney (his cousin) and a black boy, he
brought the sheep from “Rawbelle,”
they found crowds of people living
in tents and other crude habitations
on the banks of the Fitzroy River.
This was in August, 1858, and
during the following few months Mr.
Macartney, with Sir John and a
man named Robert Graham, both
of whom had come from Victoria to
take up country in Queensland,
made several expeditions in the out-
lying region with this purpose in
view. As a result, “Waverley” still
being too far away to utilize for
stock, in December, 1858, he took
up “Glenmore,” on the north side of
the river, between the watershed of
Alligator Creek and Moore Creek,
a very valuable property, which he
retained for about two years. By
this time large numbers of those
attracted by the gold rush had left
the district; nevertheless, a big
crowd still remained, and formed
the nucleus of the present popula-
tion of Rockhampton. A survey of
the town was commenced by Mr.
Clarke, of Calliope, but by the time
the permanent survey was carried
out by Mr. A. F. Wood, large tracts
of country had been taken up all
over the district, the Archer family
alone having 50 miles’ frontage to
the south side of the Fitzroy River
and 15 miles on the north side, while
in land their holdings extended as
far as and embracing Westwood.
This family contributed largely to
the development of the district,
keeping in their immense stores
many articles indispensable to set-
tlers but unobtainable in Rockhamp-
ton, which they cordially allowed to
be supplied to outside pastoralists in
need of such. Mr. Macartney in-
vested in town allotments at the
first and second land sales held in
Rockhampton, and as an instance of
the fluctuation of land values, it
may be of interest to note that a
piece of land in the centre of the
town for which he had paid .£l6 and
resold for £530 was afterwards dis-
posed of by a syndicate for £1,200,
and as late as 1909 was still totally
unimproved and probably not worth
more than £3OO. At the beginning
of 1859, with Mr. P. F. Macdonald,
Sir John Macartney, and a black
boy, he set out on an expedition
from Glenmore, in the course of
which he explored the Isaacs and
Mackenzie Rivers, and took up a
good deal of country, following up
the Isaacs and Connor Rivers, and
returning via Collaroy. They also
crossed the range and visited “Wav-
erley,” which still lay in a totally
unsettled district; and after this
trip, which extended over three
weeks, Mr. Macartney set out with
Mr. Dan. Connor, two white men
named Driscoll and Fuller, and a
couple of black boys, with the pur-
pose in view of discovering a pos-
sible route over the range between
“Waverley” and Collaroy. This
they were unsuccessful in locating,
and it was left to Mr. Allingham to
discover a dray crossing in the year
1860. From 1859—in which year
Mr. Macartney paid a visit to Mel-
bourne, riding overland from Syd-
ney —up to 1863, there was a strong

demand for country in Queensland,
and according to the Land Act of
the New South Wales Government
hundreds of square miles could be
taken up on a single tender and left


unstocked and unoccupied. After
separation took place, however, this
unsatisfactory state of things was
looked into, with the result that the
Queensland Government passed an
enactment making it
compulsory for any-
one taking up land
after April 1, 1863,
to stock it. Mr.
Macartney first placed
stock on “Waverley”
in the early part of
1860, having pro-
cured from Messrs.
Archer 250 head of
cattle, with which he
proceeded with the
necessary equipment
to form a station on
the remote property.
Provided with two
American diggers’
cottages and a quan-
tity of general gear,
he travelled with
bullock drays to the
spot, and having
installed Mr. Henry Bridson as
manager, left in the month of March
for Gayndah, where he purchased
1,150 cattle from the Honourable
B. B. Moreton, at Wetheron, which
were immediately taken to “Waver-

more or less exciting nature. Among

from Melbourne, on which occasion
Mr. Macartney had the honour of
being the first to take a boat into
Broadsound. The craft, a small
sailing boat, belonged to a man
named Murphy, and was hired by
Mr. Macartney to take round five
though a fine oarsman, was totally
ignorant of sailing craft; and Mr,
Macartney’s serviceable knowledge
was confined to familiarity with the
main features of the coastal moun-
tains. A certain Dick
Casey, however, the
only other man
aboard, was a very
good seaman, and
with this not particu-
larly reliable crew
the boat started on
her rather risky
voyage. For two days
and one night they
sailed down the river,
leaving it on the
second night, and
after several narrow
escapes safely entered
Broadsound, whence,
with a stiff breeze
behind, they sailed at
a great rate up the
St. Lawrence Creek
to within four miles
of “Waverley,” going
higher up than any boat has
since ventured with cargo, and
landed their freight on a high
bank above the site of the present
police paddock. It was afterwards
conveyed to the station in bullock
drays. In 1859 Mr. Macartney

adjoining now began to be taken up,

Although master of the little vessel,
Murphy knew practically nothing of
the sea, nor of the coast; Mr. Mayne,
tendered for country now known as
“Huntley,”“Wolfang,” and “Cheese-
borough,” and his tenders clashing
with those of a Mr. Ker, he paid
to the latter the sum of £BOO to


withdraw in his favour, which being
done the laud became his. In the
next year he took up “Avon Downs,”
near Logan Downs. Boxing Day,
1859, witnessed the first race meet-
ing held in Rockhampton, the course
being situated near the Yeppen-
Yeppen Lagoon, and Mr. Macart-
ney rode in both the hurdle
races, being one of the crack
riders of the district. His feats
of horsemanship are almost too
well known to need recapitulation,

to Rockhampton during the early
part of his residence on the station.
On these occasions (about once a
month) he would ride the 125 miles in
one day, receive his mail and answer
it, discharge what business he had

encounter with the blacks, Mr.
Macartney had two white men and
a black boy with him, but although
two attempts were made upon his
party in a single night by the abori-
ginals, all were fortunate enough
to escape. Afterwards, however, the
men on the station were obliged to
build a stockade to ward off the
attacks which became frequent, and
the blacks caused considerable
trouble by prowling about the home-
stead area and disturbing the cattle
for a long time. Some disease got
into the herd eventually, forcing an
abandonment of the run, which was
200 miles from the nearest settle-
ment, on the Roper River, and the
stock was moved to Mr. Macartney’s
station, “Auvergne,” by Mr. John

Mr. Macartney’s partnership
with Mr. Mayne was dis-
solved by mutual consent
in 1884. In 1887 he was joined
by Mr. Hugh Lewis Heber-
Percy, and this connection, which
extended over 32 years, was termi-
nated in 1909. On January 4, 1861,
his marriage took place with Anne
Flora, eldest daughter of the late
Alexander Fairlie Cunningham Wal-
lace-Dunlop, a member of the well-
known family of that name in
Scotland. Mrs. Macartney’s father
came to Australia in 1852, and
was engaged for a period in
pastoral pursuits in Victoria, estab-
lishing the well-known property
“Hexham Park.” He was also
interested in politics, and was a
member of the Legislature of
Victoria. Mrs. Macartney died on
October 15, 1911, leaving a family
of four daughters and four sons.
Of the sons, Lieutenant-Colonel
Henry Dundas Keith Macartney,
born in 1880, and educated at
Geelong, in his eighteenth year
received a commission in the
Royal Australian Artillery. He
was for some time A.D.C. to General
Finn, Commander-in-Chief of the
Commonwealth Forces, and subse-
quently proceeded to England,

where for three years he studied
different military subjects. After
returning to Australia he was
appointed one of the instructors at
the Royal Military College, Dun-
troon, where he remained until he
received the appointment to second
in command of the Ist Squadron
Australian Flying Corps. He volun-
teered for service abroad many times
before being permitted to go, the
Defence Department, in considera-
tion of the fact that he was the only
certificated machine-gunner instruc-
tor then in Australia, refusing his
application on the score that he
could best serve his country by
remaining in the Commonwealth.
Lieutenant-Colonel Macartney was
married in 1912 to a daughter of Dr.
Zichy Woinarski, of Wolfdene,
Mornington, Victoria. Mr. Macart-
ney’s eldest daughter, Constance
Madeline Frances, married the late
Captain Mountiford Longfield, of
County Cork, Ireland, who, while
on active service as captain in the
Hampshire Yeomanry, in the South
African War (1899-1902) against
the Boers, succumbed to a
fatal wound. His son, William
Brinkley Macartney Long-
held, is a captain in the
Royal Dublin Fusiliers now
(1917) fighting in France.
“Ormiston House,” situated
on a point commanding a
most extensive and enchant-
ing view of Moreton Bay,
is surrounded by over 200
acres of land, and has con-
siderable historic interest
from the fact that it formed
the site of the pioneer sugar
plantation mill of Queens-
land, the chimney-stack of
which still stands upon the
estate. This venture was
inaugurated by the Hon. Cap-
tain Louis Hope in 1862,
and he was responsible for
the erection of a homestead,
which was afterwards im-
proved and modernized by
Mr. Macartney. Though he
was a large landowner, Mr.
Macartney’s record was actu-
ally more that of an explorer
than a squatter, and in
recognition of his exploring
achievements, early in the
year 1880 he was made a
fellow of the Royal Geograph-
ical Society—a well-earned
distinction. As a worker in
the direction of promoting
settlement, of discovering
and opening up new country, cr
inducing others to take up lands
for pastoral occupation, and so
developing the resources of
Central and Northern Queensland,
he was deserving of the highest
praise from all sections of the com-
munity, and to such pioneers as the
late Mr. John Arthur Macartney,
the State owes a debt of gratitude
which can never be estimated ade-
quately. Mr. Macartney held the
Commission of the Peace for over 50
years, having been gazetted to that
office as far back as 1862.


JOHN SHANNON, “Wyalla,”
Toowoomba, who holds an honoured
name among the first ranks of
Queensland pioneer pastoralists, was
born in 1841 on the Hunter River,
New South Wales. When upon
the threshold of manhood he
decided to leave his native State
and to seek his fortune in the

wide, undeveloped districts of
Queensland. He was the owner of a
few good horses, which he gathered
together by dint of hard work and
a certain spirit of enterprise which
distinguished him from the first,
and having youth and health in his
favour, was keen to prove his ability
he reached the latter settlement
after a six-months’ trip full of
dangers and hardships, and never
lacking in excitement. He was re-
peatedly stuck up by bushrangers,
and floods were encountered, causing
great delay and anxiety. One
fence only was met with
during the journey, the pro-
perty thus protected being
one on the Namoi River,
owned by Messrs. Lloyd
Brothers, of “Burrburrget. ”
Drayton was then the chief
town on the Darling Downs,
Toowoomba being a swamp,
and Ipswich (then known as
Limestone) was looked upon
as the capital of Queensland.
Mr. Shannon arrived in time
to see the commencement of
the first railway in Queens-
land—the line between Ipswich
and Drayton—at a period
when river boats formed the
principal means of transit
from the former town to
Brisbane, the trip occupying
twelve hours—from 6 a.m. to
6 p.m. Having arrived safely
at Brisbane, he took the
steamer for Rockhampton, a
small paddle boat called
the ‘'Williams,” and em-
barked on what proved to be
a very haphazard voyage,
on account of the inability
of the skipper to locate Keppel Bay.
The little craft cruised up and down
between Bowen and Maryborough
in not the best of weather, and only
after the third trip was the course

gnawing at each other’s tail. Upon

taken charge of by the engineer,
Wallace, who succeeded in bringing
her into port. The 30 horses, how-
ever, owing to the delay, were in a
bad way between the rough seas and
primitive state. The dwellings were
mostly huts, or shacks, constructed
with palings from Hobart Tas-
mania, and hence called “Hobart
Town humpies,” while the roads and


so-called streets were in such a state
of bog that the place was very
appropriately nicknamed “Mud-
hampton.” At this period the central
west was just beginning to open up
in earnest. Gold rushes to Clermont
and Canoona, and the opening of the
Peak Downs copper mines were the
events of the times. Provisions were
very dear, and a bag of flour was
frequently valued at the worth of
two horses (scarce as these animals
were), whilst a bottle of quinine
would be bartered for the lot, when
fever and ague (malaria) played
havoc among the new colonists.
Bushrangers and blacks also were
very real dangers, and the man who
travelled unarmed never travelled
far alone. Floods were another
source of peril; waggons and drays
being the only means of transport,
progress was necessarily very slow,
and escape from a precarious

a volume. On one occasion, when
returning from a lengthy journey,
he was aware that bushrangers were
on his track, and knowing that these
“bush burglars” would follow their
usual custom and rip open every-
thing likely to be used as a

gone, and he at once concluded that

hiding-place, he sewed £3OO in notes
into the flap of an old pair of horses’
winkers, and that they might the
better escape detection, threw the
winkers carelessly away in the long
grass, some yards from his camp.
At first streak of dawn Mr. Shannon
and noticing that tlie animal was
gnawing something in the long grass,
turned aside out of sheer curiosity
to see what it was. To his astonish-
ment he saw a portion of a pair of
winkers, and upon examination
found to his joy the flap into which
his treasure was sewn untampered
with, the other flap being missing.
Evidently the dingos had been
prowling round the camp during the
night, and had carried off the “safe
deposit” for their morning meal.
Riots on the diggings amongst the
Chinese and all sorts of lawlessness
were rife. Even a gold commissioner
was tried and hariged for murdering
his own escort, Mr. Shannon form-
ing one of the jury to pronounce
judgment at this memorable trial.
Mr. Shannon married in 1865, and
brought his young wife to Crescent
Lagoon, near Rockhampton, where
he had previously selected land.


This country, however, was subject
to floods, and the couple, with their
infant sons, had some trying ex-
periences. In 1870, therefore, he
invested in a small cattle holding

near Lily Yale, on the Peak Downs,
called “Crinam,” but sheep were
driving cattle from the west, and in
1872 Mr. Shannon moved again,
purchasing a practically unstocked
cattle station at the head of the
Fitzroy watershed, in the Leich-
hardt district, known as “Saltbush
Park.” Sheep had been tried here,
but failed, and Mr. Shannon drove
overland 700 fine cattle, which he
had purchased from Mr. Black, of
“Yamala” Station, to stock this
new country. With these he laid
the foundation of one of the best-
known and most profitable cattle
stations in Queensland, and subse-
quently considerably enlarged its
area by the purchase of “Car-
dowan” and a portion of the “Col-
laroy” resumed area. The earlier
years of the enterprise were marked
by the usual struggles which
attended the efforts of pioneer
pastoralists in Queensland, flood,
drought, and diseases among the
stock all contributing to retard a
rapid advance towards prosperity.
After many months of constant
effort and industry, a period of
comparative affluence would seem to
be about to crown their labours with
well-deserved success, when from
one or other of the causes mentioned
all these bright hopes would be
dashed to the ground, and a
fresh start rendered necessary. All
through the seventies and eighties
the uphill way had to be trod. Both
1872 and 1873 were very dry years,
and the new country being without
fences of any description gave the
cattle a liberty of which they took
very full advantage. The grass was
scant, and it seemed as though they
would never settle down in their
fresh quarters. Again and again
they rambled through the dense
scrub back to “Peak Downs,” and a
number of them were never re-
covered by the owner. In 1874 one
of the sudden big floods to which

the district is subject came down
the river, which to the newcomers,
without any previous experience of
such an occurrence, was a most
unexpected and calamitous visitation.
The greater part of the herd was
drowned, and having only about
700 head to breed up from, Mr.
Shannon took a trip to the south
and brought 300 fine heifers from
“Glenprairie” Station. A second
flood coming six weeks later, 25 per
cent, of the new draft were also
lost—a sufficiently heartbreaking ex-
perience. The year 1875 was marked
by the outbreak of pleuro, which
played red havoc among the cattle,
killing off quite half the herd,
despite every attempt being made to
save them by inoculation. In 1884
a record flood, which rose feet
higher than any other known before
or since, came down in the night as
the result of phenomenal rains on
the watershed, none having fallen
locally at “Saltbush Park.” On
this occasion three-fourths of the
herd were overtaken by the waters,

milkers were swept away. The low-
lands of the run being more richly
grassed than the higher portions,

tures, and the 1884 flood coming
without warning left no time for
rescue. Now, by means of telephonic
communication, such calamities are
easily averted, the stock being
removed to the highlands immedi-
ately the message comes through.
Undaunted by his setbacks, Mr.
Shannon battled on, and gradually
extended his interests, purchasing
“Eungella,” “Stockton,” and “Con-
way” Stations, in ’ the South
Kennedy district, and “Ho<?an-
thulla,” in the Warrego all
of which he has since sold. In 1909

an excellent reputation. This sta-
tion was also noted for the fine
draught and saddle horses bred on
the run. The latest improvements in
fencing, machinery, dips, dams,
wells, bores, and irrigation are
always adopted, and in favour-

vation and large haystacks
are to be seen in the vicinity
of the homesteads, in prepara-
tion for the possible lean
years to come.
Mr. Shannon
takes the keenest
interest in the
welfare of his
native land, and
served his fellow-
ratepayers for
many years as a
member of the
St. Lawrence Di-
visional Board,
for over three
decades riding
regularly 150

(1917) in his 76th year, he is in
the saddle every day, sitting more
erect than many a man of half
his years, and thoroughly enjoying a
mettlesome steed. He delights in a
horse-muster, and will still run a
wild mob over mountain and creek
to a standstill. A true patriot, he
has always been a liberal supporter
of hospitals and other charitable
institutions, and in 1914 he donated
a Red Cross kitchen to the 11th
Light horse, which he called the
“Saltbush Park Kitchen.” In May
1916, Mr. Shannon suffered the loss
of his wife, after over 50 years of
wedded life. The late Mrs. Shannon
was Margaret, third daughter of

Wales, previously a pioneer of the

where he had formed “Goondi-
windi,” “Callandoon,” and “Um-
bercollie” Stations. The last-named
place was the birthplace of Mrs.
Shannon, who was the first white
child born in the district. Through
the early days of his married life
Mr. Shannon owed much to the wise
counsel and companionship of his
wife, who proved herself a true
helpmeet through rain and shine.
“A sweet-souled, strong, and gener-
ous gentlewoman,” she exercised the
graces of hospitality and charity at
all times, and as a type of the brave
and capable wife of the Australian
pioneer she earned the admiration of
all classes of the community. Mr.


Shannon purchased “Wyalla” in
1907, and here the pleasant and
beautiful things with which they
are surrounded have been freely
shared with a large circle of chil-
dren, grand-children, and friends.
WILLIAM ROSS MUNRO, of
“Boombah,” St. George, and “Ross
MR. DONALD MUNRO.
Roy,” Indooroopilly, was born at
Tariaro, New South Wales, on
February 20, 1850, and is a son
of the late Donald Munro, who came
from Dingwall, Scotland, where his
family held an honoured position
among the oldest inhabitants of that
district, many of the Munros hav-
ing occupied prominent public offices
for several generations past in that
part of Scotland—that of Governor
of Dingwall Gaol being held by the
father of the late Donald Munro.
Mr. William Ross Munro’s mother
was Maragaret McPherson, a mem-
ber of the noted McPherson family
of Inverness, the traditions of which
extend as far back as those of the
Munro clan, of which Sir Hector
Munro, of Fowlis Castle, is the pre-
sent chief. Her father, Urquhart
McPherson,. was an officer of Inter-
nal Revenues. The late Donald
Munro engaged in sheep-farming
for some years, but disposed of his
property and sailed for Australia in
the merchant vessel “John Grey,”
bringing with him his family of
four children—two sons and two
daughters. Three sons and three
daughters were afterwards born
to him under the Southern Cross,
and of these four sons and four
daughters still survive. Upon his
arrival in 1848, he joined a
cousin, Alexander Munro, who
had preceded him from Scotland,
and had established himself in

the glamour of the famous Turon
gold diggings cast its spell over the
canny Scotsman, as on many another
of more inflammable temperament,
and caused him to resign pas-
toral administration for the time
being to respond to the fickle
goddess’s beckoning smile in another
direction. The result of this venture
was disappointing, his efforts failing
to command any signal success, and
after a few months on the field he
returned to the scene of his former
labours, and purchasing a share in
“Tariaro,” forthwith assumed the
duties of managing partner. Eventu-
ally the possibilities of the pastoral
industry in Queensland impressed
themselves upon his mind, and dis-
posing of his interests in New South
Wales, he came northward, and
while looking for country heard of
the existence of a small tribe of
blacks who were absolutely devoid
of hair. He made a point of seeing
the natives, locating their camp on
the Culgoa River, a tributary of
the Balonne. They were 13 in num-
ber, and boasted not a hair between
them. The last member of the tribe
died at St. George in 1893. Mr.
Munro finally selected an area
on the Narran River, south-
west Queensland, which he stocked
with sheep, and inaugurated as
a wool and mutton proposition in
the year 1860. Having been bred in
the cold and bracing highlands of
Rosshire, Mr. Munro soon pro-
nounced the climate of Queensland
unsuitable for wool production, and
once again selling out, he reinvested
his capital in the Mother State, pur-
chasing “Keera,” in the mountain-
ous district of New England, which
became the home of the family for
many years, and is now in possession
of Mr. Hugh R. Munro, a brother
of the gentleman under review. The
late Donald Munro met his death at
48 years of age, whilst on a pros-
pecting expedition, the object of
which was to secure another property
to work in conjunction with
"Keera.” Being short of fresh pro-
vision, he partook of tinned fish,
with the result that ptomaine poison-
ing ensued, and terminated fatally.
After this unfortunate incident the
station was carried on for a time by
his sons, and eventually was sold to
Mr. Thomas Cook, of “Touran-
ville,” New South Wales. Mr.
H. R. Munro purchased a share in
the property, and upon the death,
some time later, of the senior partner
(Mr. Cook) became sole principal.
Prior to the sale of “Keera” Mr.
William Ross Munro and his bro-
ther (Mr. A. G. Munro) had disposed
of their interests in the property
and conjointly purchased the old
historic estate, “Weebollabolla,”

his share to his brother, and
purchased the well-known pro-
perty, “Boombah,” near St. George,
Queensland, from Messrs. Baker


Brothers, this holding originally
having been taken up from the
Crown in 1850 by the Hangar fam-
ily, who worked it solely as a cattle
proposition. When Mr. Munro took
over the estate it was stocked with
a herd of 5,000 shorthorns, and the
first act of the new owner was to
sell the bulk of these, reserving a
few picked cattle for stud purposes.
The stock fetched 255. per head —a
marked difference from the prices of
the present day, when £8 and £lO
represent the value of the average
beast. Since that time the stud has
been carefully built up by Mr.
Munro, who has introduced new
blood from the best herds in Aus-
tralia, and in addition has imported
six pedigreed bulls from England,
bred by Mr. J. Hobbs (of Maisey-
hampton), Mr. Hickling (of Not-
tingham), and Lady Cathcart (of

well-known breeders of this popular
type. The conditions under which
Mr. Munro began his task were the
reverse of easy. Made roads were
non-existent in the district, and the
nearest railway communication was
touched at Warwick, nearly 300
miles distant. Few of the luxuries
of civilization were procurable, and
hard and continuous labour was the
lot of most. Rough times were the
order of the day, and the capacity
to “hang on” was a very necessary
ingredient in the make-up of a
pioneer pastoralist. Only a strong
man could face the disappointment
and trials connected with the de-
velopment of such a proposition as
that upon which Mr. Munro had
embarked, and it is only just to say
that he came triumphantly through
the ordeal, bearing his setbacks with-
out complaint, and always sturdily
setting to work to retrieve his posi-
tion in as short a time as possible.
By his expert administration of the
cattle department he has succeeded
in retaining the purity of type for

development of the sheep section. Mr.
Munro favours the merino breed,
and many of the finest studs in the
Commonwealth have contributed to
the very excellent flock which has
made the reputation of “Boombah”
as a wool- and mutton-producing
property, the 30,000 merinos grazing
on “Boombah” pastures reflecting
the greatest possible credit upon the
founder and up-builder of sheep-
breeding in this particular locality.
Before the days of closer settlement,
when the area of “Boombah” ran
into 120,000 acres, the flock num-
bered double its present tally, but
in 1890 it was severely decimated

The present area of “Boombah”
Estate is 30,000 acres freehold

date, however, on account of the

Munro is the eldest son of the six
children born to his parents in
Australia, and received his early
education under private tuition at
“Keera” homestead. Subsequently
he continued his studies under the
late Rev. J. Penril, at the Glebe
the supervision of his eldest brother.
He continued in this connection
until 1873, when he disposed of his
interest in the estate and joined in
the purchase of “Weebollabolla

written, in 1881 relinquishing this
connection to take over the “Boom-

Point Collegiate School, and still
later attended the high school, West
Maitland, where he completed his
scholastic career. Leaving school at
17 years of age, he joined the family
of the district, and for many years
was a member of the Balonne Shire
Council, during his association with
this body filling the chair for several
terms. He was a committeeman of


the St. George Hospital, and is
still president of the institution.
In 1909 he decided to take up
his residence at Brisbane, and
with this object in view he purchased
his present home, “Ross Roy,” a
handsome residence within easy reach
of the metropolis. “Ross Roy,” situ-
ated about a quarter of a mile from
Indooroopilly railway station, is
well known as one of the finest resi-
dences in the Brisbane district, and
is a modern, well-built, two-storeyed
house, surrounded by well laid out
grounds, where garden beds and
neatly-trimmed borders, palms, and
ornamental shrubs and trees all con-
tribute charm to the vicinity. From
the balcony a magnificent view greets
the eye, the panorama extending for
miles in all directions. The grounds
cover an area of six acres, wherein
shady nooks and arbours abound,
and for the actively-inclined a fine
tennis court has been laid down.
From “Ross Roy” Mr. Munro super-
vises the conduct of his pastoral in-
terests in the Maranoa district, visit-
ing his several properties at frequent
intervals. A thorough sportsman,
soon after settling in Brisbane Mr.
Munro purchased a number of
thoroughbreds, and turned his atten-
tion to the “sport of kings.”
With “Persian Jewel,” by “Persian
Knight” (imp.), he captured the
blue riband of the Queensland turf
in 1910, and in the following year
won the Moreton Handicap with the
same horse from a field of 16 starters.
Mr. Munro won his second Derby in
1914 with “Fogbell,” by “Misty”
(imp.). Among other horses he also
owned and raced were “Artful
Lady,” “Bernie Lass,” and “Mute
Lady.” He retired from the turf
in 1916. In 1885 Mr. Munro’s mar-
riage took place with Marie, daugh-
ter of Mr. Dugald Cameron, of
“Camlet” Station, near St. George,
of which union there is a sur-
viving family of three sons and
two daughters. The eldest son,
Roy, resides at “Boombah,” where
he manages the affairs of the
station on his father’s behalf.
The second, the late Colin Cameron
Munro, in 1915 proceeded to Eng-
land, where he secured a lieuten-
ancy in the Royal Field Artillery.
After a period spent in training he
saw active service in France, and was
killed in action on the western front
on Easter Sunday, April 23, 1916.
Colin Munro united considerable
charm of personality with true man-
liness and a fervent spirit, which
endeared him to a large circle of
friends. He was always a leader
among his fellows, and “proudly,
though with sorrow,” his name has
now been placed first on the St.
George roll of honour, where it will
remain a mute testimony to the
loyalty and hatred of oppression
fostered by the family which for so
many years had been associated with
the foremost movements in the dis-
trict. William Ranald, the third
son, in 1916 left for England, via
America, on arrival becoming at-
tached to the Royal Flying Corps,
and is now (April, 1917) under-
going a course of training at Oxford.
The fourth son, Keith Ross, joined
the Australian Imperial Force
shortly after the outbreak of the
war, and proceeded to the front with
the sth Light Horse. He took part
in the Dardanelles campaign, and
remained on the peninsula for half
a year. He was twice wounded, and
also suffered from enteric fever,
eventually being invalided home to
London. When sufficiently recov-
ered he joined the Royal Naval
Flying Corps, and saw active service
in France for nine months. He
married in England, in 1917, Miss
Betty Styles, and securing furlough,
arrived in Australia in March of
that year, returning to the scene of
hostilities two months later. He
holds the rank of 2nd lieutenant.
Mr. Keith Munro was reported miss-
ing on August 15, 1917.
DUGALD CAMERON, J.P.,
“Camlet” Station, near Bollon,
South-west Queensland, is a son of
the late Donald Cameron, a High-
lander from Argyleshire, who came
to New South Wales in the year
1836, and settled on the Hunter
River in that State. This worthy
pioneer followed farming pursuits
on country situated between Mait-
land and Morpeth, at a time when
only a few of the oldest settlers,
including such families as Robert-
son, White, McPherson, Beaton,
etc., whose names have since become
historic, had taken up land in that
portion of New South Wales. Mr.
Cameron sprang from a family the
members of which followed agrarian
pursuits as far back as the days
when the wars of the clans made his-
tory in the Highlands of Scotland
hundreds of years ago. Following
his arrival in Sydney, as was only
natural, Mr. Cameron turned his
attention to agriculture, considering
that he would achieve the best
results in this field of industry. He
continued on the land for upwards
of half a century, until the time of
his death. Mr. Cameron left 78
descendants, including the subject
of this memoir, who was born on the
Hunter River on May 24, 1837. In
the absence of outside facilities for
education, Mr. Dugald Cameron re-
ceived instruction in scholastic sub-
jects from his parents at home, and
at an early period began to make
himself useful on the farm, where
he remained until 14 years of age.
About that time his adventurous
spirit being attracted by the
romance of a prospector’s life, he
followed the rush to the Victorian
gold diggings, then springing into
prominence. He played a man’s
part in the rushes to Bendigo, Bal-
larat, Daylesford, Ararat, and the
surrounding fields, and persevered
in this life for three or four years,
without, however, receiving the least
encouragement in the way of sub-
stantial results. While still in his
teens, with thousands of other dig-
gers, he left Victoria in the rush to
the Port Curtis district of Queens-
land, but at Rockhampton his pre-
vious experience being repeated, he
decided to abandon the search for
the precious metal. Returning home
after a brief period, the north again
claimed him, and within a very
short time he was busily employed
in connection with pastoral enter-
prise in the Maranoa district. Mr.
Cameron may be said to have been
the pioneer of pioneers in this por-
tion of the State. He gained his
early experience in stock and station
pursuits on a property on the New
South Wales-Queensland border, and
in 1862 launched out on his own
account by the purchase of “Mug-
geralla,” on the Culgoa River, in
the same locality. After retaining
this station for a short time, he sold
it and purchased “Minnoon,” which
property he worked for five or six
years. At different times Mr.
Cameron owned “Wild Horse
Plains,” “Charlton,” “Tilquin,”
“Tongy,” and “Camlet” Stations,
and it is safe to aver that during
his lengthy association with these
properties he had many experiences
of a varied nature, frequently look-
ing defeat in the face, but never
acknowledging himself to be beaten,
even when brought financially to the
brink of ruin keeping his head up
and discharging every penny of debt
incurred. Although his efforts to


achieve success were not rewarded
by the measure of prosperity which
they deserved, he established a repu-
tation for honour and integrity,
which is a most valuable inheritance
for those who come after him. Mrs.
Dugald Cameron is a daughter of
the late William Nichols, formerly
of Suffolk, England, a pioneer
farmer of the Port Stephens district

of New South Wales, where ulti-
mately he became interested in the
pastoral industry. This lady has
proved herself a true helpmeet to
her husband throughout their long
life together, and has played an
important part in the work
empire-building. By this union there
is issue four sons and eight daugh-
ters, of whom but one daughter re-
mains in the old home to minister
to the requirements of her aged
parents and cheer them in the de-
clining years of a long and honour-
able life. The four sons are all
engaged on the land. The eldest
daughter is the wife of Mr. W. Ross
Munro, of “Boombah”; the second
(surviving) married Mr. Ranald
Macpherson, who manages “Whyen-
bah” on behalf of Mr. Munro; the
third is the wife of Mr. G. N.
McMicking, of “Manus” Station,
Tumbarumba, New South Wales;
the fourth married Dr. Henry
L’Estrange, of Brisbane; another is
married to Mr. T. Easton, of Clif-
ton, Darling Downs; while the
youngest is the widow of the late
Percy McArthur Bowman, of the
well-known Bowman family, whose
early connection with “Mount
Brisbane” Station is closely linked
with the history of that district.
Mr. and Mrs. Cameron still live in
active association with pastoral pur-
suits at “Camlet/’ one of the oldest
stations in South-west Queensland.
Though making no pretention to
modern style, the homestead has its
own charm, and loyally preserves
the tradition of genial hospitality
characteristic of earlier days.
RANALD MACPHERSON,
manager of “Whyenbah” Station
on behalf of Mr. W. Ross Munro, is
a native of London, where he was
born on May 15, 1860. He is the
second son of the late Rev. Ranald
Macpherson, of St. Luke’s Estab-
lished Church of Scotland, and
springs from a very old Highland
family, the Clan Macpherson, of the
famous Cat crest. The Macphersons
won much renown as fighters, and
by the law of the sword established
their right of leadership in the days
of the great battles of the clans.
They were indeed recognized as a
fighting clan par excellence, and
were much feared by the Low-
landers, and held in wholesome
respect by the cream of the High-
land heroes of war and the chase.
The home of the family for genera-
tions was Badenoch, near Inverness,
where the name of Macpherson is
still well known. Mr. Ranald Mac-
pherson received his education at
the far-famed Edinburgh Academy,
where he was a student for some
years, and subsequently in 1875 he
entered a shipping office at Leith,
obtaining there a useful acquaint-
ance with commercial life. After
four years in this connection he de-
cided to leave the land of his fathers
and to seek the shores of Australia,
to the young Scot a region of
romance and adventure, where for-
tunes were to be rapidly made by
mining, pastoral, or other avenues
of enterprise. His advent to the land
of the Southern Cross dates back to
1881, and upon arrival in New
South Wales he spent a brief period
in gaining the necessary “colonial
experience” with distant relatives,
who had been settled for some time
in the neighbourhood of Albury, in
the Mother State. In 1884 he
accepted the position of sheep over-
seer at “Old Cashmere” Station, on
the Maranoa River, Queensland, the
property then being in possession of
the late Robert McMicking. Here
he’spent three years, during which
he considerably enlarged his experi-
ence of stock and general local
conditions, and at the close of this
period was offered a similar post by
Mr. W. Ross Munro, on “Boom-
bah” Station, St. George. After
filling this position for some time, he
became manager of “Boatman”
Station, on the Nebine River, which
was then being newly formed, and
continued to control operations there
for about five years. He was next
persuaded to join the Public Service
as land ranger in that portion of the
country, but after spending nearly
a decade in this work, decided that
the hoped-for promotion was too
long in coming and that pastoral
enterprise offered better prospects
for speedy advancement. Accord-
ingly in 1909 he resigned from the
service to undertake the duties of
manager of “Whyenbah” for Mr.
W. Ross Munro, and has since re-
tained this appointment. In 1915
Mr. Macpherson acquired on his
own account the “Honeymah” Es-
tate, a property of 21,000 acres,
adjoining “Whyenbah,” which he
purchased from Mr. Munro, who had
retained this area in addition to the
present “Whyenbah” territory,
when a large portion of the original
run was resumed bv the Government
some time previously. Mr. Macpher-
son married in 1895 Catherine Anne,

second daughter of Mr. Dugald
Cameron, of “Camlet” Station, near
Bollon, and has one son and one
daughter. The fighting instincts of
his race prompted their son to offer
himself in the world struggle now in
progress, and at the time of writing
(1917) he is in France “doing his
bit” for the Empire.


THE BELL ESTATES. Among
the more important pastoral inter-
ests of Queensland, a prominent
place must be given to the estates
held by the family of the late Mr.
J. T. M. Bell, To his son, Mr.
Ernest Thomas Bell, has chiefly
fallen the general administration of
these properties, among which may
first be mentioned “Coochin Coo-
chin,” a freehold of some 20,000
acres, situated near the thriving
town of Boonah. This was pur-
chased in 1882 as a fatten-
ing depot for “Camboon” Station,
and has a notable reputation for
its fertility and the excellence of
its stock. The comfortable home-
stead is delightfully situated on an
elevation between two plains, en-
circled by an amphitheatre of moun-
tains rising to a height of 5,000 feet.
To the west the Great Dividing
Range stretches north and south,
marking the divide between the
eastern and western waters of Aus-
tralia. More to the north may be
seen Mount Castle (alias the “Sleep-
ing Assyrian”), where the Little
Liverpool Range branches off. In a
south-westerly direction Mount Cor-
deaux and Mount Mitchell hold the
famous Gap, named after that in-
trepid explorer, Allan Cunningham,
who first discovered this pass through
the mountains, thereby establishing
communication between Moreton
Bay Settlement and the western
tableland. In the same quarter lie
Spicer Peak and Spicer Gap,
through which pass, in later years,
Engineer Clinton constructed a road
by means of convict labour from the
Moreton Bay Settlement. More to
the south lie Mount Roberts (5,000
feet) and Mount Wilson, named by
Allan Cunningham and Captain
Logan in 1828, when they were
in search of a pass through the
mountains. From Mount Wilson
the Macpherson Range stretches
away in an easterly direction to the
coast, marking the boundary be-
tween Queensland and New South
Wales territory. To the south-east
the rugged battlements of the two
Barneys terminate this entrancing
panorama. Before the tick regula-
tions came into force and the border
traffic ceased, all the stock fattened
on “Coochin Coochin” was sent to the
Sydney saleyards and to the Ramor-
nie Meat Works. They are now sold
in the Brisbane yards, and a very
keen demand for them comes from
Queensland meat works. The station
turns off about 2,000 fat bullocks
annually, besides carrying a pure-
bred Hereford stud herd and a num-
ber of horses. The stud herd is an
excellent one, and was established
by the late Mr. Bell, who purchased
45 head of pedigreed female cattle
from that noted breeder, the late
Mr. Nolan, of “Elah,” New South
Wales, in which herd the blood of
the famous imported bull “Pearl
Diver” predominated. Later addi-
tions were 20 head from “Tocal” (Rey-
nold’s), which were descendants of
the famous cows, “Minerva” (imp.),
“Last Day,” “Carissima,” and
“Temptress.” In 1896, 30 heifers
were added to the stud, prin-
cipally of “Count Comely” blood,
bred by the late J. H. Angas,
of South Australia. The executors
of the estate subsequently imported
two beautiful heifers from England,
MR. J. T. M. BELL.
bred by Mr. W. B. Tudge— i.e.,
“Golden Lady,” by “Goldfinder”
from “Teme Lady,” and “Marvell,”
by “Wonderful” from “Noble Fro-
lic,” first-prize winner at Lord
Tredegar’s show, first and champion
at M.A.S., and first at L.A.S., etc.
With the heifers, two bulls were
also imported, “Lord Jasper,” by
“Ony Jasper” from “Gipsy Coun-
tess,” and “Easter Monday,” by
“Royal Rameses,” ex “Gwendoline.”
From the outset only high-class bulls
were used, such as “Prince,” de-
scended from “Latona” (imp.),
“Master Wilton,” from “Elsie Wil-
ton” (imp.), “Minerva’s Magician
2nd,” “Majestic” (imp.), “Long-
fellow” (imp.). At the present the
sires in use are “Lord Jasper”
(imp.), “Pollux,” by “Shraden”—
“Welcome” (imp.), and “Lord
Blenheim,” by “Blenheim” (imp.).
The stud herd is used exclu-
sively for the breeding of bulls
for “Camboon” and its auxiliary
stations, “Planet Downs” and
“Shotover.” “Coochin Coochin”
freehold was transferred to Messrs.
E. T., F. M., V. D., and
B. C. Bell in 1914, in accordance
with the will of the late J. T. M.
Bell. Subsequently, owing to the
claims of the district for closer settle-
ment, some 6,262 acres were offered
at auction and realized up to £27
per acre, averaging £8 11s. “Coo-
chin Coochin” now comprises 13,440
acres, an area principally devoted to
fattening the bullocks bred on
“Camboon.” “Camboon,” acquired
in 1875 by the late Mr. Bell, and
situated on the Dawson River, origin-
ally was used for the depasturing of
sheep and cattle, but later was
found to be cattle country par excel-
lence. It is now applied exclusively
to this industry. In the first in-
stance it comprised some 600 square
miles, but this- area has been con-
siderably reduced owing to resump-
tions. In 1897 it carried a herd
of nearly 20,000 high-class Here-
fords, ranking as possibly the finest
herd in Australia at the time. After
the disastrous drought of 1902-1903,
however, the bangtail muster of the
latter year revealed that only 800
head remained on the station, and
in order again to stock up the
“Yarrow Creek” (N.S.W.) and
“Emu Creek” herds were purchased,
representing some 7,000 head, and
there are now about 10,000
head of cattle on the run. The
country has been fenced and ring-
barked and subdivided into pad-
docks, yards and dips were erected,
and wells and sub-artesian bores
sunk in the back-country. Wind-
mills and engines were installed to
raise the water into 20,000 and
30,000 gallon tanks for the supply
of the stock during dry periods.
There are now seven engines em-
ployed in raising water, as they are
found more satisfactory and reliable
than windmills, which are sometimes
becalmed at the time their agency is
most needed. Besides cattle, horse-
breeding occupies quite an important
place on this property, which car-
ries about 400 head of saddle horses
and Clydesdales, of which latter
breed the late Mr. Bell was an
ardent admirer and enthusiast. He
began breeding over 35 years ago,
from horses brought from New


South Wales, where they were bred
by the late Hon. Walter Douglas.
Ever since sires have been purchased
from leading Australian establish-
ments, and particular attention has
MR. ERNEST THOMES BELL, M.L.A.
been paid to keeping the type pure.
The draughts from “Camboon” are
readily conceded to be a very fine
lot and among the best produced in

is situated some 20 miles from the
Dawson River, on Ox Track Creek,
and about 50 miles from Banana. The
old dwelling-house was considerably
added to and improved, and is
N
roomy and comfortable. A school
has been established for the station
children to attend, and among other
advantages possessed by the place is
a telegraph station on the overland
telegraph route. Since 1904 the
property has been under the
management of Mr. F. M. Bell,
J.P., who in 1911 married Miss
Rica Darvall. tie has a son and a
daughter. Mr. Bell manifests a
cordial interest in local affairs, and
represents his division as a council-
lor on the Banana Shire Council.
Owing to the area of “Camboon”
being so much reduced by resump-
tions by the Crown, and to meet the
difficulties occasioned by continued
dry spells, it became necessary to
secure additional country on which
to pasture stock. The executors of
the estate, therefore, arranged to
lease the “Normanby” paddocks, in
the Fassifern district, and “Widgee”
Estate, near Gympie. Subsequently,
in 1913, purchase was made of
“Planet Downs” and “Shotover”
Stations, in the Springsure district,
comprising some 700 square miles of
country. “Planet Downs,” which
carries some 10,000 head of cattle
and 300 head of horses, is used as a
breeding depot for “Camboon” and
“Coochin Coochin,” and is under
the management of Mr. Edward
Grey, cousin of Sir Edward—now
Viscount—Grey, the British diplo-
matist. The Bell family has been in-
timately associated with the history
and progress of Australia during the
past 100 years, and has done a
large share of pioneering work, more
particularly in the States of New
South Wales and Queensland. In
1806 Ensign—afterwards Lieutenant
—Archibald Bell, with his wife and
family of two sons and three daugh-
ters, left England in the sailing ship
“Sophia,” of some 400 tons, to join
the 102nd Regiment, N.S.W., under
Major Johnston, and commanded
the Governor’s guard when Major
Johnston entered the gates of Gov-
ernment House and arrested Gover-
nor Bligh. In 1808 he was recalled
to England to give evidence in con-
nection with the arrest, and upon
his return retired to his estate,
“Belmont,” near Richmond, on the
Hawkesbury. From this home Archi-
bald, the second son, started in 1823
on an exploration trip, with the
object of discovering a possible route
across the Blue Mountains. His first
effort was unsuccessful, but on his
second attempt, in the same year,
he succeeded in marking and clearing
a track right across the moun-
tains until a junction was effected
with the road previously marked out
by Lawson, Wentworth, and Blax-
land. This road has since become

known as “Bell’s Line,” and has
been used as a travelling stock route,
and it is now generally admitted
. that this is the route which should
have been chosen for the laying
down of a railway over the moun-
tains. In consideration for his ser-
vices to the colony, Archibald Bell
FLIGHT-COMMANDER B. C. BELL, D.S.C.
was granted 1,000 acres of land by
the Government of the day, and in
his search for suitable country he
crossed by what is now known as
Wiseman’s Ferry Road, striking the
Hunter River at Patrick Plains


(Singleton), where he met Howe and
Singleton, the first white men to
penetrate this district, who had
reached the spot a few days earlier.

acres on the banks of the Hunter,
and called the place “Corinda,”
after which, returning to Belmont,
he brought back the first mob of
cattle ever introduced to the virgin
pastures of the Hunter River dis-
trict. Thomas Bell, the youngest
son of Lieutenant Archibald Bell,
took up country on the Liverpool
Plains, where he lived for some con-
siderable time. He married Eliza-
beth North, daughter of Major
North, and had one son, James
Thomas Marsh Bell, who, born in
1840 and educated at King’s
School, Parramatta, was
studying law at the time of
his father’s death, when he
was compelled to relinquish
his studies. For some time
after this date he man-
aged properties on behalf
of his uncle, George Henry
Cox, until he acquired a
property of his own near
what is known as the
Hanging Rock, on the
Namoi River, New South
Wales. In the early seven-
ties he moved further
north, and purchased "Um-
bercollie” and “Minimie”
Stations, near Goondi-
windi, in Queensland, and
in 1875 acquired “Camboon,” on
the Dawson River, near Banana,
when he took Mr. F. C.
Hyde into partnership. In the
same year he married Gertrude
Coochin,” and here he came to re-
side with his wife and family. Vari-
ous other stations were worked con-
jointly with this property, including
“Louisavale,” in the Brisbane Val-
ley district, “Wallabella” and
“Combargno,” in the Surat district,
and operations were continued by
Mr. Bell until his death in 1903.
The demise of this gentleman re-
moved another link with the his-
toric past in the sphere, not of public
life or office, for which he had no
desire and persistently refused to
enter, but as one of Australia’s
hardy old pioneers, who left the
more settled confines to help subdue
the wilderness and carve out homes
for themselves and their families in
the bushland of an undeveloped
country. Five sons and three daugh-
ters were born to the late Mr. Bell,
the eldest of whom, James Archi-
bald, resides in New Zealand.
The properties have since been
managed by the late Mr. Bell’s
executors, among whom are included
his widow and two sons — viz., Ernest
Thomas and Francis Marsh Bell.
Another son, Mr. Bertram Charles
Bell, who was touring in England
at the outbreak of the war in 1914,
volunteered for active service, and
drove the first Queensland motor
ambulance car in Flanders and
Northern France. When the Red
Cross took charge of the ambulance
work he resigned and joined the
Royal Naval Air Service as a pilot.
After receiving his commission he
was sent to France with the No.
1 Squadron, being stationed at
“COOCHIN COOCHIN” HOMESTEAD.
Dunkirk, where he engaged in recon-
noitring, raids, and spotting for
the Fleet. He has taken part in
other exciting experiences, and was
successful in bringing down an enemy

Mrs. Bell’s ma-
ternal grand-
father was
Thomas Walker,
born in 1792,
who was engaged
in the Peninsular
War, Waterloo,
and other great
conflicts, after-
wards being ap-
pointed to the
commissariat in
Sydney. He
married Anna Elizabeth Blaxland,
and died in Tasmania. Mrs. Gertrude
Augusta Bell, who was one of the
first white women to reside on the
Dawson River, is the authoress of
various literary works, in the early
years of her married life writing
under the name of “Sydney West.”
Among these may be mentioned
“Under the Brigalow,” the scene of
which is laid near the station;
“Sarabande,” published in 1915,
and “Reminiscences of Old Syd-
ney,” which were published in The

ERNEST THOMAS BELL, J.P.,
M.L.A., representative for Fassi-
fern in the House of Assembly,
was born at “Camboon,” on the
Dawson River, on March 31, 1880,
being a son of the late James Thomas
Marsh Bell, a native of the Hawkes-
bury district of New South Wales,
who became one of the early pioneers
in the pastoral industry in Queens-
land, owning and controlling "Coo-
chin Coochin, ” “ Combargno, ’
“Wallabella,” and “Camboon” sta-
tions. Mr. E. T. Bell received his
education at the Toowoomba and
administration of the combined pro-
perties owned by the late Mr. Bell,
to which “Planet Downs” Station has
since been added. In 1913 Mr. Bell
was a candidate for the Fassifern
seat in the State House of Assembly,
at the bye-election which took place
in that year, on which occasion,
though opposed by representatives
of both Labour and Liberal parties,
he secured an overwhelming major-
ity of 1,566 votes. That his popu-
larity suffered no diminution during
his two years’ term of office was
manifested by his re-election in 1915,
it down at the third attempt.
At the time of writing he is
acting Flight Commander of his
squadron. In 1915 Mrs. Bell and
her three daughters went to

new era in the progress of the dis-
trict. Pie married in 1910 a daugh-

The “ LYNDHURST ” and
“DULACCA WEST” Studs, the
property of Mr. C. E. McDougall,
J.P.—Nearly a century has elapsed
since Allan Cunningham first pene-
trated the country to which he gave
the name of the Darling Downs,
after the then Governor of New
South Wales, Sir Ralph Darling.
Thirteen years later Patrick Leslie,
with his party, following the same
route, came to this favoured spot,
and being greatly impressed by the
richness of the soil and the luxuri-
ance of the herbage, took up an
area of 1.000,000 acres and stocked
it with sheep, etc. In the course
of time this large area was reduced
by resumption and purchase, and
among the smaller estates formed
was “Lyndhurst,” comprising 700
acres of the choicest land in the
fertile valley through which the
Condamine wends its way. This
property ultimately came into the
hands of the late M. S. McDougall
in 1875, and was carried on by him
until the time of his death some
seven years later, when his son, Mr.

several properties have been sub-
divided, fenced, and placed under
cultivation, lucerne being grown
on a very large scale. “Lyndhurst”
has established a big reputation for
the breeding of pure shorthorn

chased the sire “Archie” and a
number of well-bred blood mares.
“Brasenose” (half-brother to “Go-
zo”), “Musketoon” (by “Trenton”
—“Mona,” imp.), “Ardon” (“Tar-
tar”—“Ardea”) followed in succes-
sion, proving a very useful quar-
tette of sires. “Barrallan,” one of
the gamest and fleetest horses ever
seen in Queensland, was got by
“Ardon.” The latter sire was sold
to Mr. R. H. Dangar several years
ago, but later was repurchased by
Mr. McDougall in the hope of pro-
ducing another animal equal to re-
peating the fine performances re-
corded by “Barrallan.” In 1905
Mr. McDougall imported “Ladur-
lad,” by “Ladas” out of “Tres-
sure,” by “Bend Or,” this horse
being selected in England for Mr.
McDougall by Mr. J. E. Brewer,
the well-known Victorian sports-
man. “Ladurlad” proved an un-
qualified success, and was the lead-
ing sire in Queensland until “Syce”
deposed him from this position. His
stock won most of the principal
events on the Queensland Turf, in-
cluding the Hopeful Stakes, Derby,
and Brisbane Cup. “Ladurlad”
broke a leg in 1911 and was
destroyed, and subsequently Mr.
McDougall purchased “Syce,” a
chestnut horse (15.2), showing great
quality, plenty of bone, and re-
markable muscular development.

minence during the past two
decades. The inception of the stud

of the Eclipse Stakes, valued at
£lO,OOO, filling second place.
“Syce” was a wonderfully game
horse and possessed of an excep-
tional turn of speed, as was evi-
denced by his running five furlongs
in 57 seconds, carrying 9 stone. He
was a great performer, and as will
be seen by reference to his pedi-
gree, was extremely well bred.
In England “Syce” won the follow-
ing races: —Caterham Plate, Ep-
som; Members’ Plate, Warwick;
Belmont Plate, Epsom; Chaddesden
Plate, Derby; Members’ Plate,
Warwick; Surbiton Handicap, San-
down Park; was second in the Stud

Rous Memorial, Goodwood; Lough-
ton Plate, Brighton; Emscote Wel-
ter Handicap, Warwick; Sussex

Epsom; Chaddesden Plate, Derby;
Batthyany Plate, Lincoln. “Syce”
was phenomenally successful at the
stud, and sired the following win-
ners:—“Lord Vindex,” first Q.T.C.
Two-year-old Handicap, Flying
Handicap, Sires’ Produce Stakes,
Denman Plate (w.f.a.), September
Handicap; second Q.T.C. Derby
Stakes to “Lordacre”; “Lyndhurst
Lady,” “Merry Syce,” “Sir
Syce,” “Dr. Butler,” “Sympo-
sium” (second Q.T.C. Hopeful
Stakes, won by “Baltic Sea,” first
Q.T.C. Champagne Stakes and
Two-year-old Handicap), first Q.T.C.
Derby (1917), “The Bounce,” “Star
Robe,” “Azorine,” “Lady Syce,”
“Sir Syce,” “Gulabi,” and “Syce
Lad,” winner of the Hopeful Stakes
(1917). The total prize-money
won by these horses amounts
to over £8,700, a record which
has never been approached by any
other sire used in Queensland. In
March, 1917, Mr. McDougall sub-
mitted ten youngsters to the ham-
mer, including brothers to “Lord
Vindex” and “Dr. Butler,” and a
sister to “Star Robe.” All were
sold, the brother to “Lord Vindex”
realizing 420 guineas, the general
average being well over 200 guineas,
a very satisfactory result consider-
ing the conditions then prevailing.
In 1915 Mr. McDougall imported
“Seremond,” a sire of great promise.
“Seremond” was selected in Eng-
land for Mr. McDougall by Mr. C.
C. Edmunds, manager for Lord
Rosebery, who spent considerable
time in inspecting available sires
before making a final choice. This
fine horse introduced into Queens-
land fresh strains of the best and
stoutest blood in England. “Sere-
mond” is a powerful, lengthy, up-
standing bay or brown horse, by
“Desmond,” the champion English
sire of 1913, whose progeny ac-
counted for £158,798 in stakes.

Stakes at Goodwood, the Brighton

and “Shogun,” besides being placed
in numerous other first-class events.
The introduction of such a beauti-
fully-bred horse to the “Lynd-
hurst” stud is bound to improve the
standard of Queensland bloodstock.
At the same time Mr. McDougall
imported “Fuglebury,” by “Fugle-
man,” out of “Lady Yatesbury” by
“John Morgan”; grand dam, “Cin-
der” by Hampton,” g g dam “Pom-
peia” by “Julius,” and he has since
raced this mare with considerable
success. He also purchased four
highly-bred mares at Sydney in
1916, two of them, “Mallaig” and
“Culture,” being amongst the
brood mares sent from Mr. Dun-
can’s Waikanae Stud in New Zea-
land. “Culture” is a chestnut
mare by “Boniform” from “Cul-
roy,” by “Wallace” from “Hor-
tense”; “Mallaig,” a bay mare by
“Clanranald” from “Happy Val-
ley/’ by “Wallace” from “Far

Another still more notable addition
to the “Lyndhurst” mares is
“Fadgie” (imp.), by “Symington”
(son of “Ayrshire”) from “Cy-
nane,” by “Cyllene” from “Sun-
tai” by “Donovan.” Mr. McDougall
also secured “Wise Bird,” by

and “Greencap”), “Odonto” (dam
of “Rolad” and “Donto”). The
shorthorn stud was formed in 1893,
in which year ten heifers were pur-
chased from Mrs. Waddel, of “Ben-
venue,” Singleton. Within 12
months over a score of heifers were
added from the same stud, all of
them being descended from pedigree
cattle bred by Messrs. Baldwin and
Dangar. When the "Canning
Downs” stud was dispersed in 1902,
Mr. McDougall bought 50 high-class


pedigreed stud cows and heifers,
all running back direct to four
cows imported from England
by the late Hon. J. D. Macansh,

20 cows were secured at the break-
up of the “Wooroowoolgen” stud.
In 1908 10 cows were purchased
from “Gordon Brook” and 33 from
“Durham Court” (the late C. Bald-
win’s famous stud) were afterwards
added to the herd. Only first-class
sires have ever found a home at
“Lyndhurst,” among which may be
mentioned “Prince of Goolhi” (win-
ner of over 20 prizes in New South
Wales), “Beverley Duke 20th,”
“Beau Tregunter 31st,” “Lord
Russell 44th” (all bred by the late
J. H. Angas, of South Australia),
“Blood Royal” (inbred to Dangar’s
famous “Lord W alnut family),
“Bapton Patriot” (imported by the
late H. C. White), “Earl of Wynd-
ham sth” (imported from New Zea-
land), “Baldwin’s Peer” (by the
525-guinea bull “Spicy Peer”), and
“Clipper’s Duke” (imp.). Other
stud bulls are “Lyndhurst Royal
Peer,” five times champion at the
National Show, Brisbane, twice
champion at Toowoomba, and six
times champion at Warwick, a re-
markable total of 13 champion-
ships, carrying the honour and dis-
tinction of the purple ribbon;
“Clogher Augustus” (imp.), reserve
champion in 1915 and champion m
1916; and “Hampton Bowling sth
(imp.), a prize-taker in England.
Representatives from the (‘Lynd-
hurst” stud have been uniformly
successful in the show ring. At
Brisbane in 1915 Mr. McDougall
carried off champion and reserve
champion bull and champion and
reserve champion cow, and in 1916
champion and reserve champion
bull and champion cow. In the
group sections he has practically
swept the board, in spite of the
strongest competition. About 150
high-class pedigree cows are now
located at “Lyndhurst,” almost all
descended from the four cows im-
ported by the Hon. J. D. Macansh,
the remainder of the stock having
been sent to form the stud at
“DULACCA WEST,” which pro-
perty is under the capable manage-
ment of Mr. J. G. McDougall, a
younger brother, and a great short-
horn enthusiast. The last-named pro-
perty, situated near Yuelba, on the
Western railway line, comprises
about 50,000 acres of first-class cattle
country. Since taking possession in
1905, Mr. McDougall has pursued
a vigorous policy of ring-barking,
fencing, and other developmental
work. The timbers found on the
run include brigalow, myall, and
belar, while an adequate water
supply is obtained from three creeks
which flow through the property.
The nucleus of the “Dulacca West”
herd was formed by the introduc-
tion of 100 pedigreed cows from
“Lyndhurst” and a couple of bulls
—“Blood Royal” and “Sturdy
Jock,” the last-named being a
grandson of “Imperial Purple.”
Numerous other highly-bred bulls
have since been used, and the
standard of the herd has been main-
tained at a high level. There are
now with the bulls over 400 very
high-class cows, recently seen by
that prince of shorthorn judges, Mr.
Harry Bracker, who expressed him-
self very strongly on their uniform
shorthorn type, size, and quality.
There is a steady demand for young

bulls bred on the station, at prices
ranging from 30 to 50 guineas. The
horses at “Dulacca West are
all thoroughbreds. There are 20


stud-book mares, and the “Ayr Lad-
die” horse, “Hartfell,” is the princi-
pal sire. “Hartfell” registered some
good wins in his time and has to
his credit the A.J.C. Epsom Han-
dicap, the Mooney Valley Cup (Vic-
toria), and several other important
events. Being such an enthusiastic
breeder of blood horses, it is only
natural that Mr. McDougall should
devote much of his time to further-
ing the interests of the Turf. He
is ever to the fore in all movements
bearing on the welfare of “the sport
of kings,” and his influence is
always directed to the improvement
of the conditions under which it is
controlled. He is a member of the
Queensland Turf Club and president
of the Warwick Amateur Picnic
Race Club. He is a keen supporter
of “picnic” race meetings, and it is
safe to aver that in this field of
C. E. McDougall’s great-grand-
father, Alexander McDougall, the
founder of the family in Australia,
first settled in the Hawkesbury dis-
trict, forming there a home which
was noted for its beautiful orchards
and its resemblance to the stately
homes of the Old Country which he
had left behind him. His son,
John Kerr McDougall, who was
born on the Hawkesbury, acquired
pastoral properties on the Hunter
River, in the Musselbrook district,
and was the father of a large family
of sons and daughters, of whom
Malcolm Septimus McDougall was
the seventh son. The latter gentle-
man was born at “Roxborough
Place,” an estate near Parramatta,
in which district the McDougalls,
the Suttons, the Rouses, and vari-
ous other notable pioneer families
lived in close proximity. Upon

time before they were able effectu-
ally to establish their prior claim,
hence the name “Texas”— i.e.,
“disputed country.” This property
was owned by the Tindal family;
together with other estates on the
Barwon River, for a great many
years. Eventually Malcolm Sep-
timus McDougall settled on the
Clarence River and devoted his at-
tention to stock-breeding, in course
of time winning a reputation for
being one of the best judges of stock
in New South Wales. He owned
“Ermington,” a property adjoining
“Ramornie, ” which subsequently
was owned by the Tindal family;

tioned station, he took over the
management of “Texas,” and for

CHARLES EDWARD McDOU-
GALL, J.P., is a native of Queens-
land, having been born at Texas on
December 4, 1865. He is the fourth
son of the late Malcolm Septimus
McDougall, of New South Wales,
who pursued his scholastic studies
at The King’s School, Parra-
matta, near Sydney, and afterwards
achieved prominence in the pas-
toral industry of that State. The
McDougall family originally came
from Scotland to New South Wales,
where it was numbered among
the pioneer landed settlers, owning
some of the old historic properties
at a period when portions of Sydney
which are now densely populated
were under grass and timber. Mr.

leaving school Mr. M. S. McDougall
first tried his fortune on the Turon
goldfields, joining there his brothers
who, prior to the discovery of this
field, had taken up “Texas” Sta-
tion, which for the time being they
abandoned for the more romantic
life of the gold diggings. In com-
mon with many others, however,
they soon discovered that the possi-
bilities of prospecting, for the
average digger, were considerably
overrated, and that the excitements
of pioneering the “Never-Never”
country, in which mysterious region
“Texas” at that time lay, were
equally fascinating and offered more
reliable chances of success. Return-
ing to their neglected station, they
found that the country had been
“jumped” by another enterprising
behalf of his brother’s heirs. In
1869 he acquired “Gunyan” Sta-
tion, on the Dumaresq, now owned
by Messrs. Tindal & Son, which he
conducted for about seven years,
when owing to the encroachment of
settlers he sold out and shortly
afterwards, in 1875, purchased
“Lyndhurst” from Mrs. Gore,
widow of the late St. George Gore,
who 60 years ago erected the sub-
stantial stone homestead which still
stands on the property in an excel-
lent state of preservation. In 1877
he purchased “Clifton” Station, in
south-western Queensland, near
Cunnamulla, which the family owned
up to the year 1902. Malcolm
Septimus McDougall—who died in
1882— -married in 1859 Blanche
Eliza, daughter of the late Captain


Edward Weston, of Horsley, New
South Wales, a lady whose grand-
father, Colonel Johnstone, played a
leading part in the crisis in New
South Wales history which led to
the expulsion of Governor Bligh
from his high office, when the mili-
tary commander himself assumed
control of affairs, which he retained
until official appointments were
made by the Imperial Government.
Colonel Johnstone then retired to a
farm in New South Wales, where he
lived and prospered until his death
in 1817. Mrs. McDougall proved
herself to be one of the noble daugh-
ters of Australia who so ably
assisted their husbands to pioneer
the country, and undeterred by risk
of drought or flood she braved the
terrors of the unknown bush for the
sake of the companionship of the
man of her choice. Mrs. McDougall
resides with her son at “Lyndhurst’’
and is still (1917) in the enjoyment
of excellent health. Mr. Charles
Edward McDougall received his
education at the Toowoomba Gram-
mar School, having been one of the
students enrolled at the opening of
that institution by Mr. Mclntosh,
the capable headmaster, who was
responsible for the scholastic train-
ing of many of Queensland’s leading
citizens. He left school at the age
of 16, about which time his father’s
death occurred, and thus early in
his career was compelled to assume
responsibilities usually shouldered
by much older men. Mr. McDougall
from the first showed excellent
judgment with regard to stock, and
as he gained practical knowledge
and experience he found himself
able to command success in all the
departments which he chose to
handle, and at the present time
there is no corner of the Common-
wealth which owns interests in the
pastoral industry where his name
and reputation for the breeding of
cattle and horses have not become
household words. In 1890 he com-
menced business as a stock a,nd
station agent at Warwick, founding
the firm of McDougall & Company.
The firm has been a great success,
and each year large numbers of
horses, cattle, and sheep are sold
and important sales of land effected.
Early in his career the young pas-
toralist began to display an interest
in the public affairs of the district
and to take a prominent part in the
organizations created for the better-
ment of general conditions, especi-
ally those under which pastoral
enterprise was carried on. His
exceptional administrative talents
were early recognized, and when the
Rosenthal Shire was inaugurated,
over 30 years ago, he was asked by
the ratepayers of the district to
allow himself to be nominated tq a
seat on the council, to which request
he gave his assent. He was duly
elected at the head of the poll, and
since has held the seat without a
break in his tenure of office. He
has topped the poll on all occasions
on which there was a contest, and
has been frequently returned with-
out opposition. On various occa-
sions he has served as chairman of
the council. For a lengthy period
he has been a member of the East-
ern Downs Horticultural and Agri-
cultural Association, which has its
headquarters at Warwick, and after
acting for over 20 years on the
council he was elected to the office
of president rendered vacant by the
death of Sir Arthur Morgan,
Lieutenant-Governor of Queensland,
etc. The death of Sir Arthur also
deprived the National Agricultural
Association of Brisbane of its pre-
siding genius, and it fell to the
lot of Mr. McDougall to assume
the mantle of his distinguished
predecessor in this office. On many
occasions he has been pressed to
become a candidate for Parlia-
mentary honours, but has persist-
ently declined all overtures of this
nature. His reluctance to enter the
political arena, however, did not
prevent him from taking an active
part in advancing the views of the
old Conservative party, so ably
represented in the past by leaders
of the calibre of Messrs. Mcllwraith,
Nelson, and Byrnes, and later, on
the formation of the present Liberal
Party, he transferred his allegiance
to the new body, which he has con-
sistently supported ever since. He
is a member of the committee of
the National Political Council of
Queensland, and has held His
Majesty’s Commission of the Peace
for nearly a quarter of a century.
That Mr. McDougall’s labours have
not passed unnoticed is evidenced by
the esteem in which he is held, not
only on the Downs, but throughout
the whole of Queensland. His un-
tiring efforts to bring about an im-
provement in the breed of short-
horn cattle and blood horses have
been of incalculable value to the
State, and undoubtedly have given
a great stimulus to the breeding of
stock on the very best lines.
JOHN SAMUEL KEEN. No
one will ever be able to tell the
world just how much Australia owes
to that splendid army of men who
in the early days gave themselves to
the task of pioneering the bush
country of the future Common-
wealth and, disregarding all the
attractions of city life, lived in the
loneliness and isolation of the in-
terior, there laying the foundations
of that prosperity which Australia
has enjoyed in ever-increasing de-
gree in spite of the periodical set-
backs by drought and the almost
heart-breaking difficulties which so
often seemed to persistently dog the
footsteps of men “out back.” The
early pioneers are now few and far
between, but some who endured the
hardships of long ago have given
to the States sons and daughters
who are of the same sturdy stock
and the same indomitable spirit as
those brave men and women of old,
and these children are a vital factor
in establishing Australia’s pros-
perity of to-day. One of these
sturdy pioneers is Mr. John Keen,
father of Mr. J. S. Keen, who was
born at the “Cowpasture’’ (as it was
then called), now known as Camden,
some 40 miles from Sydney. His
parents had arrived from England
only a couple of years before his
birth in 1836, and when the little
Australian was only two years of
age his father passed away. The
widow and family removed to the
Maitland district, and a few years
later were to be found engaged in
farming pursuits on the Patterson
River at Hinton. At this time the
principal building materials were
slabs and bark, and the style of
architecture was varied in the ex-
treme. All the same, just as
“stone walls do not a prison make,
or iron bars a cage,’’ these humble
huts were for the most part happy
homes, and around these hearths
were inculcated those principles
which, carried through life, make a
man a good citizen, a firm friend,
and an honest trader. The broad
sweeps of cultivated land familiar
to people nowadays were in those
times only visions of the future, for
the scrub was very thick and stumps
of large trees dotted the landscape.
On the land the Keens occupied Sir
John See’s people made their homes
at a later date. For several years
the new settlers found the seasons
were dry and floods were unknown,
but in 1857 the Hunter River gave
an exhibition of what it could do


when it swelled in its pride. In this
district the Keen family farmed the
flats and grazed the high land, but
at last, in order to increase their
holding, they moved on to Portree,
continuing to raise crops and farm
stock, also breeding high-class
horses very successfully. Mr. John
Keen is a lover of horses, as well as
a good judge of them, a trait which
he has handed down to his sons.
At the age of 21 Mr. Keen married
Miss Ada Scammell, three years his
junior, and who through a long life
was a model wife and mother, a wise
counsellor, and a far-seeing business
woman. Her courage was of a high
order, and she cheerfully shared
the privations and disappointment
drought and other adverse condi-
tions occasionally imposed. Her fore-
sight was remarkable, as one illus-
tration will show. When coal was
first discovered in the Maitland dis-
trict she urged her menfolk to secure
some of the land to hold for the
future, in which she had visions of
just such developments as have since
taken place. For good and sufficient
reasons her advice was not taken,
but her anticipations were correct,
as they generally were. Mrs. Keen
was one of those queenly women who
wield an influence for good wherever
she lives, and whose children are an
asset of no small value to the com-
munity in which they may play
their part. She died in 1910, es-
teemed by a very wide circle of
friends and loved for her good

works. Mr. John Keen, still hale
and hearty, remembers the convicts
who were stationed at Maitland, for
as a lad he used to see them
march down the Stockade Hill, East
Maitland, to work on the roads or
to help build the present gaol. He
can also recall the first and last
execution in Maitland to which the
public had access to, when two
natives paid the extreme penalty of
the law. In those early days also
the Sydney steamers used regularly
to come to Morpeth, among them
being the “Rose,” “Thistle,”
“Lubra,” and others. Life had its
thrills in those days, and Mr. Keen
was of that disposition that he found
interest in them all. There were
floods, droughts, fires, bushrangers,
and local excitements, and as a
matter of course the constant
struggle with Nature to take up
one’s attention; but though there
were many depressing intrusions
Mr. Keen’s courage and tenacity
always enabled him to come
up smiling from the severest
bouts with Dame Nature. Mr.
Keen was by no means a stick-at-
home, and the Louisa Creek dig-
gings (now Hargraves, New South
Wales) only needed to whisper for
him to feel the gold fever. He was
on this field in 1851, and put in
about 18 months amongst the ex-
citements of the rush. Though he
did not find another “Blackfellow’s
Nugget” he and his party did not

do at all badly. Later, the discovery
of gold on the Ovens River (now
Beechworth) again drew Mr. Keen
away from home, but on this field
he did what other wise men have
done for their profit—he went into
business instead of digging for him-
self, and his wisdom was justified.
The means of communication with
Melbourne at that time was by
team, and Mr. Keen made several
journeys to the southern capital.
Twice he camped on the banks of
the Yarra, near where the old bridge
stood, and up the hill behind his
camp stretched the white-and-brown
houses of “Canvas Town.’’ Yet a
third time did the call of gold lead
Mr. Keen afield. This time he
joined a party which “humped
bluey” to the Snowy River rush
from the South Coast port of
Merimbula, where a steamer from
Sydney had landed them. On this
field the party also did well, though
they often had to sit idle for a fort-
night at a time on account of the
snow. In 1882 Mr. Keen left
Portree for “Dolgelly” Station,
away up near the Queensland bor-
der. The big drought, which began
in 1880 and ran into 1885, was a
very trying experience, and had not
the owner and his wife been imbued
with that same spirit of tenacity as
their forbears they would no doubt
through with about enough to make
what was practically a fresh start.
They had endured the hardships
without losing courage, and when
the drought broke the family reaped

adversity as in prosperity. In 1902

railways then to relieve the starving
stock, either by bringing fodder to
them or by taking them to more
favoured districts) Mr. Keen saw it
through, as before. Though the pro-
perty had been so improved that it
was the last to feel the drought, it
was “pinched” in the end and felt
its full force, but whatever have
been the discouragements the Keens
have never abandoned a property
once they were in possession. After
several years on “Dolgelly” Mr.
Keen left the place in charge of his
son, Mr. John Samuel, and returned
to Hinton, in which centre he had
received his early education. Suc-
cessive rein ovals were to Osterley,
Morpeth, and Manly, Mr. Keen
finally taking up his residence at
Waverley, Sydney, where he is now
spending the autumn of his life in
peace and contentment. Mr. Keen
always took a keen interest in public
matters, and was well known in
sporting circles through the fine
horses he bred. He was a good sup-
porter of shows, and his name ap-
pears on the membership roll of the
Royal Agricultural Society, Sydney.
For seven years he was a church-
warden at Hinton, and carried
through several important under-
takings. Mr. John Samuel Keen

he acquired “Polideroi,” in New
South Wales, also one of the
many Retreat stations and “Tar-
tha” cattle station, the latter two
being in Queensland. Life on these
properties was of the usual type for
the most part —struggles with fickle
Nature, lack of communication
with markets, situations demanding
courage and resourcefulness, and
occasionally trouble with the natives.
On one occasion, when the family
was on “Dolgelly,” Mr. Keen was
surrounded by a crowd of excited
blacks, who for some fancied wrong
were determined to kill the subject
of our sketch. The gins, however,
remembering favours received at the
hands of the family, resisted the de-
signs of the men, and at last, by
means of persuasions and threats,
calmed them, and spears and nullahs
were laid aside and the intended vic-
tim allowed to go in safety. When
Mr. Keen’s father removed from
“Dolgelly” his son took over the
management, though his home was
practically at “Polideroi.” For
years he successfully guided the
affairs of both properties, which
continued to improve in value and
efficiency. Now, with his family,
Mr. J. S. Keen resides at “Roys-
ton,” just outside the border of
Goondiwindi. Mrs. Keen is a daugh-
ter of Mr. Sam. Fielder, well known
throughout Australia as one of the
best judges of horseflesh in the
Commonwealth and as one of the
most expert trainers in the' profes-
sion. A daughter completes a happy
trio. Upon the introduction of the
new scheme of local government, Mr.
J. S. Keen was appointed by the
Government to be one of the first
shire councillors for Boolooroo Shire,
Gwydir district, and he is a magis-
trate of New South Wales. Mr.
Keen is not that type of man to
whom publicity is a necessary of life ;
he prefers to keep in the background
and help in a practical way any
movement for the well-being of the
community. He is satisfied to quietly
do his share in building up the
prosperity of his country by manag-
ing to the best advantage that little
bit of his native land which is his
particular care, believing that the
way to national greatness and the
good of the whole community is
along the path of industry, whereby
the natural resources of Australia
may be made to contribute to the
needs of other peoples, while giving
employment and reward to those
who, in the ample expanses of the
interior, face the difficulties which
would appal many city dwellers, and
where they overcome the shy per-
versity of a somewhat fickle and nig-
gardly Nature. The Keen family
has had some worthy connections
during its history in Australia. The
grandmother of Mr. J. S. Keen, on
his father’s side, was a lady of Rox-
burghshire, Scotland, being a daugh-
ter of a well-known gentleman
farmer of Kelso district, William
Dodds by name. She was a sister to
the late Hon. Alexander Dodds,
M.L.C., who died in Sydney in
1892. An elder brother, James, had
arrived in Australia in 1821, being
led to come to this country by the
wife of the then Governor, Sir
Thomas Brisbane, who was from the

John Samuel Keen, left Leith,
Scotland, in the ship “North
Briton,” on January 1, 1834,
passed the Cape on June 21, and
arrived in Sydney on August 28. A
shipping note in The Australian,
announcing this vessel’s arrival,
said:—-“This vessel came within
forty miles of Sydney during the
gale on Monday night (the ‘North
Briton’ arrived on a Thursday), but
Captain Morrison very judiciously
bore up for Jervis Bay and re-
mained there two days. Had the
late captain of the ‘Edward Lombe’
taken this precaution, in all prob-
ability the lives and property by this
unfortunate vesesl might have been
saved.” Mr. Alex. Dodds, soon after
his arrival, proceeded to Maitland,
where he entered business, in which

he was engaged for 35 years. He
was electoral returning officer, was
one of the first aldermen when the
council was formed, and, taking the
mayoral chair in his second term,
held it for 12 consecutive years. In
1862 he was elected to the Legisla-
tive Assembly as member for East
Maitland, seven years later losing his
seat by two votes only. In 1885 he
was appointed to the Legislative
Council, and he was a member of
that body at the time of his death
in 1892. Mr. Keen’s grandmother,
on the maternal side, was an Eng-
lish lady, who was married to a
solicitor of Temple Court, London,
whose name was Perrier. Two
daughters and a son were the issue
of this marriage, but the son died
when midway through the medical
course he had chosen. Mr. Perrier
died shortly afterwards, leaving the
family to the care of his cousin, who
eventually married Mrs. Perrier.
This cousin, Mr. Scammell, was,
among other things, master of the
hounds, or gamekeeper, for the Duke
of Buckingham, and his hobby was
gardening, a fancy he probably got
from his brother, who lived and
worked in Kensington Gardens. Mr.
Scammell, having heard of the at-
tractions of Australia, the new El
Dorado, left England with his
people, and after a long voyage
arrived in Sydney about the year
1837. The grant of land given them
being hard to get at, the family re-
mained in Sydney and became very
closely associated with the Deas
Thompsons. Mr. Deas Thompson
was sent out by the Home Govern-
ment to be clerk to the Legislative
Council under Governor Bourke,
this being before the days of respon-
sible government. Mr. Scammell
married Governor Bourke’s second
daughter, and so close was the inti-
macy between the two families that
when an infant child of Mrs. Scam-
mell died it was buried in Governor
Bourke’s vault in the churchyard of
St. John’s, Parramatta, where mem-
bers of the Deas Thompson family
also lie. Soon after the birth of the
youngest daughter, Ada, the Scam-
rnells moved to Nelson Plains, and
here and on the River Hunter they
spent many happy and useful years.
Mrs. Scammell had studied nursing
in Paris, and in the district in which
she made her home her services were
always in request, and in the absence
of a medical man she became prac-
tically the district physician, always
giving of the best of her skill. She
utilized to the full all the medicinal
herbs she could get or grow, and
hundreds who sought her advice
remembered with gratitude her skill
and attention. Her gentleness and
kindness were known far and wide.
Mr. Scammell led his family in liv-
ing an exemplary life, and his child-
ren were held in the highest respect,
and when the youngest married Mr.

J.P. It was at the beginning of the
present century that the Texas dis-
trict of Queensland attracted the
active attention of pastoralists in
search of scope for their capital and
energies. Early records indicate that
this country—of which “Arcot”
formerly was a part—was first taken
up in the forties by the well-known
McDougall family, and derived its
name, Texas, i.e., “disputed coun-
try,” from the circumstance that at
an early period of its history an
issue arose as to the rightful owner-
ship of the area. The territory lies
on the New South Wales boundary
of the rich, southern Queensland
district, where a satisfactory rain-
fall is combined with a prolific type
of soil. As late as 1908 the first
resumption was made of the old
“Texas” run, and at that time the
Government threw open a number
of grazing blocks, for one of which
Mr. C. A. Munro was the success-
ful applicant. The result has been
that the property then secured by
him, and to which he gave the name
of “Arcot,” has since become well
and favourably known among breed-
ers of stock both in Queensland and

by his association with earlier enter-
prises of a similar nature, he soon
had the satisfaction of witnessing a
number of solid improvements well
in train, while the holding began
to assume the appearance of a
thoroughly well-organized property.
Since that time it has continued to
progress by leaps and bounds, and
at the present time (1917) ranks
among the most progressive pastoral
propositions of the district. Situated
some 16 miles from the village
of Texas, “Arcot” lies in the midst
of undulating country, of which a
distinguishing feature is the lime-
stone ridges which occur with notice-
able regularity. It is well tim-
bered, chiefly with box and ironbark,

and an adequate water supply
has been secured by artificial
means, many sub-artesian bores
supplementing the principal natural
sources, which are conserved by the
construction of several concrete
dams. Tire latter have stood the test
even of a very severe season, water
still remaining in the dams at the
break-up of the drought of 1914-15.
Mr. Munro is responsible for the
erection of the picturesque modern
homestead, which is fitted with the
most up-to-date conveniences. The
pleasant outlook over wooded hills
and valleys which it commands, and
the presence of lawns and flower-beds
adds considerably to the charm of this
roomy and comfortable residence.
In addition to these, there is an
orchard, where fruit trees of many
varieties flourish. The outbuildings
are of a character befitting the gen-
eral standard of the property, being
well-designed and properly appointed
in accordance with twentieth cen-
tury ideas, including an iron hay-
shed, which this season (1917) was
filled with hay; and in all respects
attention has been paid to the many
items entailed in the building-up
of a successful enterprise. Cattle,
horses, and sheep are bred on
"Arcot,” and expert attention has
been given to the production of types
which should advance- the reputation
of the place, and establish a prestige
not easily to be surpassed in Queens-
land. That this aim has been at-
tained is now a matter of common
knowledge, and the "Arcot” stock
is well in demand wherever its qual-
ity has been tried. The "Arcot”
herd of polled Durhams was founded
by Mr. C. A. Munro, at "Kondar,”
near “Goondiwindi, in the year
1904, with a roan polled bull on
shorthorn cows, the greater number
of the latter having been purchased
from Mr. John Burgess, of "South
Canning Downs.” The bull was by
a "Weebollabolla”-bred sire, a son
of "Charming Duke VII.”, bred by
Sir William McCulloch, and was
known as "Kondar Poley.” His
dam was a roan polled cow, bred on
"Goodar,” and descended from a
family which had been polled for
several generations, as vouched for
by an old stockman who had seen
20 years’ service on the last-named
station, when the herd was pur-
chased by Mr. Munro’s father (Mr.
A. G. F. Munro), in 1892. The cow
in question had three or four gener-
ations of “Weebollabolla”-Durham
blood in her, and by the testimony
of the same reliable authority pos-
sessed no strain of any other breed
but the Durham. Accordingly, Mr.
Munro felt himself to be on very

safe ground when he started his
enterprise, the first aim of which was
the elimination of the damanging
and useless horns, which in count-
less cases, have caused serious losses
in trucks to fat cattle, and are
always a source of danger to yarded
beasts. "Kondar Poley” sired about
50 per cent, polled calves, and from
these the best heifers were retained,
as well as one or two bulls for use
on horned cows after the old bull
was disabled by an injury. From
that time onward picked herd and
stud bulls from "Goodar” were used
on the polled cows, which always
threw a large proportion of polled
calves. Horned bulls offered the best
chance of keeping the most desirable
qualities found in the Durham to the
fore, as by using these Mr. Munro
was enabled to secure bulls sired by
“Lord Ruddington” (imp.), and
"Marengo” (prizetakers at Sydney
Royal Show); "Bovril,” imported
from Scotland; and "Lord Weston,”

and a “Spicy Peer” bull named

“Red Ryan,” purchased in 1914,
thus have left their mark on the
herd. At the present time the polled
females on “Arcot” number about
150, and of these from 50 to 70 are
of stud quality. There are also nine
polled bulls, reds and roans, three
of which are yearlings, and six in
use in the herd. The standard aimed
at by Mr. Munro has been a large
square beast of the Bates type, com-
bining quality with heavy flesh and
a hardy constitution. It was con-
sidered an essential point to retain
the quiet, tractable disposition which
was so pronounced in the first sire,
“Kondar Poley.” This has proved
an easy matter, as the calves are
almost invariably quiet, in this
respect contrasting very favourably
with the Aberdeen-Angus as regards
the working of them in the yards or
paddock. This quality also enables
them to settle down quickly and
thrive when moved from one place
to another, where less docile animals
will suffer some setback from a
change of locality. The desirability
of breeding a Durham beast without
horns first occurred to Mr. Munro
upon seeing a herd of 50 to 60 polled
cows, all shorthorn colours, on a
farm near Tamworth, about 25 years
ago. They were being milked by an
old man and his wife, who used no
bails, but simply carried a milking
stool from cow to cow as they stood
chewing the cud. Later (about 1900)
a mob of 1,000 dehorned bullocks
from “Womblebank” sold like hot
cakes in the Moree saleyards, a/nd
this strengthened a resolve to
produce and fill a demand for a
fattening beast without horns l . Mr.
Munro’s opportunity came when, in
1901, a polled bull calf entered the
“Goodar” yards with his dam, a
roan of good shape, with plenty of
soft hair. Though a number of horned
cows are still used for breeding pur-
poses, they are mated with polled
bulls, and it will be a matter of a
few years only to attain the desired
goal, when there will be only poley
bulls and cows on the place. The
offspring then will all be polled, and
a number of bulls will be bred for
sale as well. The “Charming” fam-
ily is well-known to all stud men
among Durham breeders as one of
the best in Australia, and it was
with a young bull by Charming
Duke V 11.,” bred at "Weebo la-
bolla,” that Mr Munro’s father
won the championship at the Sydney
Royal Show about the year 1895,
while a heifer by the same bull twice
secured secondary honours in her
class on that occasion, and was a
winner at most of the shows held
between Maitland and Tenterfield,
invariably carrying off premier
awards. This cow, when mated with
“Lord Ruddington” (imp.) produced
the bull “Marengo,” who came off
with flying colours at the Sydney
Royal Show when shown as a year-
ling, and afterwards as a two-year-
old. Upon both of these occasions
he -was awarded first prize, and
undoubtedly would have become a
further distinguished prizewinner,
but, unfortunately, after returning
from Sydney, he fell down a river
bank and broke his neck. The horses
at “Arcot” occupy a full share of
the time and attention of the work-
ing staff, including the owner, as
about 60 mares are breeding. The
country, being of limestone forma-
tion, produces animals with good
feet and sound bone, and they de-
velop well at an early age. The
draught entire, “Nugget,” a picture
of which appears in connection with
this article, has been used with suc-
cess for several seasons on medium
draught and light mares. He was
bred by Messrs. Higgins Bros., of
Sandy Creek, Warwick, his dam
being a “Maryvale” mare (“Wien-
holt”), and his sire by “Ivanhoe”
from a Maryvale mare The
Wienholt draughts are well known
throughout Australia, and with such

the Southern Cross, and coming to
Australia in the early days hence-
forth identified themselves wholly
with the life and development of the
young country of their adoption.
Mr. A. G. F. Munro in early man-
hood entered into partnership with
his brother, Mr. W. Ross Munro, of
“Ross Roy,” Indooroopilly, who
joined him in the acquirement of
“Weebollabolla,” a well-known pas-
toral property in the Moree district
of the Mother State, which they
worked together for some years, the
former subsequently becoming sole
proprietor, and there bringing up
his family of nine children, six of
whom survive. At a later date he
purchased “Goodar,” near Goondi-
windi, and during the quarter of a
century which has elapsed since he
first made his advent to this State,
he has thoroughly established his
reputation as one of the most pro-
gressive pastoralists of that district.
The “Goodar” herd of shorthorns is
well-known as one of the best in
Queensland. Mr. A. G. F. Munro
now divides his time between “Wee-
bollabolla” “Boonal,” and his
Queensland property. Mr. Charles
Alexander Munro received his edu-
cation principally at Moree and
Maitland, completing his scholastic
course at Cooer Academy, at Bowen
Fels, in the Blue Mountains, where
he matriculated in 1891. He was
intended by his father for the legal
profession, and leaving school in
1892, entered the law office of Mr.
T. M. Newman, of Tam worth, where
he studied for three years, complet-
ing his five years’ articles under the
well-known legal light, Mr. Yille-
neuve Smith, of Sydney. Weary of
office life monotony and finding
town life uncongenial, after pass-
ing his Intermediate Law Examina-
tion, he succumbed to the call of
the bush, and putting the idea of
professional life behind him, came
to Queensland, and for a time took
charge of one of his father’s proper-
ties, “Boonal,” near Boggabilla. In
1900 he launched out on his own
account, taking up a grazing area
near the Moonie River, in the same
district, which, however, eventually
proved a well-nigh impossible pro-
position on account of the prickly-
pear incubus. Compelled at length
to admit that he was sinking too
much in an effort to overcome the
pest, and wasting some of the best
years of his young life, he aban-
doned the hopeless task, and settled
down to the working of a farm
called “Wyemo,” which he acquired
on the Severn, or Dumaresq River,
near Texas. In 1908 he took
up his present property, and while
still retaining “Wyemo,” has since
devoted the most of his time and
attention to the development of a
pastoral enterprise, in which he has
been rewarded with a gratifying
measure of success. Mr. Munro has
cordially identified himself with the
various organizations controlling the
interests of the district in which he
resides, and is a member of the Car-
narvon Rabbit Board, and commit-
teeman of the Texas Hospital; while
formerly, when resident near Goon-
diwindi, he served on the shire
council for a considerable period.

became a well-known manager of
the Queensland National Bank. Of
this union there are a son and two
daughters.
FREDERICK DUNDAS COR-
BET GORE, J.P., Goondiwindi,
was born at “Bodumba” Station,
south-west Queensland, on April 14,
1853, and is the third son of the late
St. George Richard Gore, whose
advent to the colony dates back to
1838, and who subsequently held the
portfolio of Minister of lands in
Queensland for a brief period. This
gentleman was well known as one of
the pioneer pastoralists of the south-
western districts, as early as 1841
taking up “Yandilla” Station, on
the Darling Downs, and later re-
moving to “Bodumba,” both historic
properties in that part of the State.
To the former station he brought his
wife (Frances Caldwell, of “Lynd-
hurst”) and child, who came over-
land from Morpeth, New South
Wales, in a tilted cart, with a bul-
lock in the shafts and a horse in the
lead, in the days when buggies and
other modern vehicles were prac-
tically unknown in the country dis-
tricts of Australia. In the fifties the
late Mr. Gore acquired “Lynd-
hurst,” now the property of Mr.
C. E. McDougall, J.P. The records
of the Gore family reach back
to 1621, when Sir Paul (Poule)
Gore, first baronet, settled in Ire-
land during the reign of Queen
Elizabeth. The Queensland branch
of the family is directly descended
from Sir Ralph, the fourth baronet,
of whom the late St. George Richard
Gore was a grandson. Mr. Frederick
Dundas Gore was educated at gram-
mar schools at Warwick and Ipswich,
and at the close of his scholastic
studies served a five years’ appren-
ticeship to engineering in Sydney.
He then entered into partnership
with Mr. F. 11. Needham, late of
“Canning Downs,” and embarked
upon pastoral enterprise at “Koree-
lah,” New South Wales, where he
spent three years, gaining valuable
experience. Later he filled various
managerial posts, being stationed in
this capacity at “Glenelg,” “Glen-
lyon,” and “Pikedale” successively,
MR. FREDERICK DUNDAS CORBET GORE.
and afterwards conducted “Clare-
vaulx,” near Glen Innes, on his own
account for seven years. In 1896
he took over the management of
“Callandoon” for the estate of the
late Dr. Jenkins, and continued
there for 12 years, until the property
was purchased by the present owner.
Having disposed of other landed in-
terests which he held in this vicinity,
he joined his eldest son, St. George
Richard Gore, J.P., at Goondiwindi,
and has since taken an active part
in the conduct of the stock and
station business carried on by the
firm at that centre. Mr. Gore was
a member of the first shire council
at Inglewood, later becoming asso-
O # 7 &
ciated with the Waggamba Shire
Council, of which he is now (1917)
chairman. He is also a member of the
Maclntyre Pastoral and Agricultural
Association. He married in 1881
Margaretta Stenhouse, daughter of
the late McDonald Gunn, of Pike-
dale, and has three sons and one
daughter. St. George Richard Gore,
the eldest son, was born in 1883, and
received his education at Glen Innes,
New South Wales. At the termina-
tion of his studies he became engaged
in marine pursuits for four years,
during which period he visited many
places of interest in different parts
of the world, and subsequently spent
some time on “Yandilla” Station,
also for a few months acting in the
capacity of drover. Subsequently he
established himself as a stock and
station agent at Goondiwindi, and
the business is now the leading
concern of its kind in south-west
Queensland. He was married in
1910 to Lulu Ruth, daughter of Mr.
E. P. Armstrong, of Glen Innes,
New South Wales, and has issue one
son and one daughter. The second
son, Frederick Dundas Corbet Gore,
offered himself for service in the pre-
sent European war, and after serv-
ing in the Gallipoli campaign, is now
identified with the Royal Flying
Squadron, British Aerial Service.
The third son, Ralph Thomas, a bar-
rister by profession, and for some
time associate to Sir Samuel Griffith,

DONALD WEIR OLIVER
McINTYRE, “Strathmore,” Goon-
diwindi, was bom at Tatyoon, near
Ararat, Victoria, on May 12, 1866,
and is a son of the late Lachlan
MR. DONALD WEIR OLIVER McINTYRE.
Mclntyre, who hailed from the
Highlands, in Sutherlandshire,
Scotland, and eventually came to
Australia to seek his fortune under
the Southern Cross. Arriving in
1848, at Geelong, he was among the
first arrivals at the Bendigo and
Ballarat gold rushes, and was also
present at the historical Eureka
Riots, more than half a century
ago. He followed the mining in-
dustry for some years, but failing
to reap any very material advan-
tage from prospecting he turned his
attention to another walk in life,
becoming interested in the pastoral
industry in the Garden State with
the late W. R. Scott, his brother-
in-law. In 1879, accompanied by
his wife and family of young child-
ren, he took up his residence on
“Bogamildi” Station, New South
Wales, the property of Messrs. W.
R. Scott & Co., and here he carried
on as a stock-owner until the time
of his death in 1893. The late Mr.
Mclntyre left a widow, two sons,
and one daughter, of whom the
eldest, the subject of our notice,
received his education at the local
school in the place of his birth, and
before reaching his teens left Vic-
toria for New South Wales. At 12
years of age he became engaged in
shepherding on the same property
on which his father was employed,
and as he grew older worked in
various capacities on the station,
becoming expert at horse-breaking,
cattle-mustering, and droving, in
which avocations he continued until
his 27th year, when he and his
brother took up selections on an
adjoining run. In 1896 he sold out
his interests in that district, and
coming to Queensland purchased
“Sendee,” a small cattle station
on the Moonie River, which he
managed successfully until 1900,
when he disposed of the place. Two
years later, when that portion of
the old “Welltown” run upon
which be now resides was thrown
open for closer settlement, Mr.
Mclntyre selected 5,460 acres with
the object of forming a permanent
TROOPER G. W. McINTYRE.
home, and since that time he has
taken up an additional 11,000 acres
in the same district, the whole of
this large area being applied by him
to farming and grazing purposes.
“Strathmore” is situated only a
few miles distant from the Toobeah
railway siding and 32 miles in a
westerly direction from Goondi-
windi, and is partly timbered with
coolibah, the presence of which
indicates exceptional fertility of
soil. The “Welltown” area has
proved no exception to this rule,
and the country is famous all over
Queensland for its qualities as
grazing land, being considered
among the best in the State. Mr.
Mclntyre fills a prominent place in
local affairs in the district, and is
well known for the interest he takes
in everything tending to its ad-
vancement. It is a recognized thing
that his services are always at the
disposal of his fellows for the
betterment of the community in
general, and his efficiency and ex-
perience make him a most useful
member of the various organiza-
tions by which progress is directed
and the well-being of the residents
established. For nearly a decade
he has served on the Waggamba
Shire Council, and the Maclntyre
Pastoral and Agricultural Society
has found his services as a com-
mitteeman of the utmost value over
a lengthy period. He was one of
the earliest to be associated with
that important and useful institu-
tion, the Grazing Farmers and
Settlers’ Association, and ever since
its inception has occupied a seat
on the executive. He is president
of the Caledonian Society, and
in all quarters he has earned
the respect and esteem of his fel-
lows and the gratitude of the rate-
payers, whose interests he has made
in so large a measure his own. He
married in 1894 Cecilia, daughter
of the late J. Rampling, a well-
known pioneer of the mining indus-
try in this State, and has four song

their prospects for the sake of their

against the Turks.


“MERRIWA,” near Boggabilla,
via Goondiwindi, is the property of
Mr. Robert Fitzgerald Evans, J.P.
This property, which comprises some
60 to 70 thousand acres of land, of
MR. RICHARD FITZGERALD.
which 27,000 acres are freehold, is
situated on the border country of
Queensland and New South Wales,
Goondiwindi, 11 miles distant,
being the railway town, while the
village of Boggabilla, just within
the boundary of the Mother State,
is the centre of population nearest
to the station. It is one of the
oldest-settled properties in that part
of the country, originally having
been taken up by a man called
Howe, from whom in course of time
it was purchased by the late Rich-
ard Dines, who bequeathed it to his
son, Mr. George Dines, of this dis-
trict. It next came into the pos-
session of the present owner, who
entered upon its administration in
partnership with his late father, and
in 1906 took over the entire inter-
ests, since which date he has con-
ducted the station solely on his own
account. The property has under-
gone various changes in area during
its history, a portion having been
resumed lay the Government of an
earlier period for purposes of closer
settlement. At the time of its pur-
chase by the present proprietor its
boundaries already ran into Queens-
land, and Mr. Evans has since
secured a big additional area of
leasehold on the northern side of
the River Mclntyre, to which fine
stream “Merriwa” has a 9-mile
frontage. Therefore, although the
homestead and the main portion of
the property is on the New South
Wales side of the border, a large
and important part still remains
which is under Queensland jurisdic-
tion, and the prominent interest
taken by Mr. Evans in the advance-
ment of that portion of the North-
ern State, where so many of his
possessions lie, entitles him to cor-
dial recognition as a loyal and
thorough-going Queenslander. A
frontage of 14 miles to the Whalan
Creek is a further advantageous
feature from the point of view of
water supply, and this is also
augmented by three large lagoons,
which even in the droughtiest sea-
son have never been known to run

no necessity for artificial conserva-

portion there has been considerable
erection of tanks and dams, and
with the supplementary help of sub-
artesian bores, the country here has
been developed to the fullest extent.
The “Merriwa” pastures, which are
used principally for sheep of the
merino type, although the breeding
and fattening of cattle is also
carried on on a fairly extensive
scale, are luxuriantly clothed with
nutritious natural grasses, these in
winter giving place to the various
species of herbage which form such
wholesome sustenance for stock dur-
ing the off season. A very modern
and completely-appointed homestead
has been erected by the present
owner, which in comfort, conveni-
ence, and style can be equalled by
very few pastoral homes in either
State. It contains about 11 rooms,
exclusive of the apartments reserved
for the use of the house staff, the
kitchen, bathrooms, and other
offices, and though no fault can be
found with the arrangements from
a utilitarian standpoint, the feature
which immediately arrests the atten-
tion of a visitor to “Merriwa” is
the cultivated artistic taste dis-
tinguishing the decoration of the
home, and the laying out of the
beautiful grounds surrounding it,
to which it is plainly evident much
thought and time have been de-
voted. The garden-beds, in which a
variety of blooms shed their lar-
gesse of colour and fragrance on all
who come within their vicinity, are
diversified by cool, green lawns and
rosaries, where the “queen of flow-
ers’’ is found in many shades and
sizes, vine trellises providing the
shade so lovely and welcome on hot
summer days, and a well-kept
tennis-court, which tells its own
tale of vigorous and health-giving
exercise freely indulged in by the
inmates of this favoured home. Near
at hand are seen also the up-to-date
electric power house, motor garage,
the cottages of workers upon the
estate, and a fine array of outhouses

is a marked feature of “Merriwa,”
making a sojourn within its pre-
cincts, of however short duration, a
very pleasant experience and one to
be remembered. ROBERT FITZ-
GERALD EVANS, J.P., the pre-
sent owner of the station, was born
in Sydney, New South Wales, on
October 4, 1874, and is a son of the
late George Evans, a native of
Middlesex, England, who came to
Australia in the early fifties, while
still quite a boy, and in course of
time became a prominent member
of the legal profession in the metro-
polis of the Mother State, where he
was one of the most widely-known
practising solicitors during the
eighties and nineties of the past
descendants, while they still hold a
property at Springfield, near Syd-
ney, formerly owned and occupied
by the founder of the name in New
South Wales. The very first pas-
toral holding belonging to the
Fitzgeralds in Australia was an
Imperial grant to Richard Fitz-
gerald, the great-grandfather of Mr.
Robert Fitzgerald Evans, in the
year 1814, which was used by that
gentleman as a head station, from
which various other properties sub-
sequently acquired either by him or
his son, the Hon. Richard Fitzgerald,
were administered. An enumeration
of some of these holds a certain his-
toric interest for pastoralists of a
later period, more particularly for
period when Queensland as a self-
governing State did not exist,
“Dabee” (before mentioned) and
“Tongy” are both held by the
children of the late Robert Fitz-
gerald, the former having witnessed
its century of years in the family,
and the latter verging towards its
hundredth year. Mr. R. F. Evans’s
mother on the maternal side sprang
from a family named Rouse, also
well-known in the early history of
New South Wales, as among the
first free settlers in that country,

historic squattages “Biragambil”
and “Guntawong,” near Mudgee,
which originally were one property,

centurv. He married in the year
1868 Emily, daughter of the late
Hon. Robert Fitzgerald, M.L.C.,
and by this marriage united himself
with one of the oldest and most his-
toric families in Australia, the name
of Fitzgerald having been closely
identified with the establishment of
Home government in the older
colonies of the great island contia-
ent. The Fitzgeralds were also
among the history-making pastoral
pioneers of the Commonwealth, the
original homestead erected by the
family on the present township site
of Windsor, New South Wales, now
utilized as an hotel building, hav-

those in whose veins runs the blood
of the Fitzgeralds, though repre-
sented through the distaff side of
the family only—the male possess-
ors of this old Irish name having
all died out in Australia. Besides
“Dabee,” “Tongy” (New South
Wales) was taken up by Richard
Fitzgerald, a portion of this being
the Imperial grant made to him
upon his arrival; while “Yarra-
man,” “Midkin” (near Moree,
New South Wales), and “The 80l-
Ion” (now the site on which the
township of St. George, Queensland,
stands), were pioneered by the late
Robert Fitzgerald, besides which
several others of lesser historical
importance were taken up at a
into the pr&sent two stations. The
late George Evans, father of the
present owner of “Merriwa,” had a
family of four sons and two daugh-
ters, of whom two sons and two
daughters survive, the gentleman
under review being the elder of the
two sons, and the only representa-
tive of the old Fitzgerald family now
connected with the pastoral indus-
try. Mr. Robert Fitzgerald Evans
received his education principally
by private tuition, and eventually
matriculated under the tutorship of
Mr. Frank Butler, who at that
period held a prominent place in
letters in the Mother State. Hav-
ing concluded his scholastic studies,
and being destined by his father


for the legal porfession, he applied
himself to the pursuit of law for
about a year, but evincing a dis-
inclination for indoor life, eventu-
ally he relinquished his connection
with his father’s office, and proceed-
ing to “Dabee” became absorbed
in obtaining a rudimentary know-
ledge of the pastoral industry under
his maternal uncle, the late Robert
Fitzgerald, M.A. The station life
proved very much more to his
mind, and he forthwith decided to
embark upon a pastoralist’s career,
with this purpose in view remaining
with his uncle to gain the necessary
Pott, a widely-known and highly-
competent pastoral manager, from
whom he gained a valuable contri-
bution towards his equipment of
knowledge. By this time, having
reached man’s estate, Mr. Evans
returned to the paternal roof-tree
for a brief period before consolidat-
ing his plans for future enterprise
on his own account, and eventually
he purchased, in conjunction with
his father, his present property,
“Merriwa,” and in the 22 years
which have since elapsed he has
established himself as one of the most
prominent stockowners who have

large, and especiallv of the district
in which he has resided for the
lengthy period of 22 years, very
few of such schemes have ripened to
fruition without his generous co-
operation and assistance. He is an
honoured member and ex-president
of the Maclntyre Pastoral and Agri-
cultural Society, and for nearly a
score of years the Commission of the
Peace for New South Wales has
been held by him. A cordial advo-
cate of all clean forms of manly,

later he embraced an opportunity of
making himself au fait with the
methods and plan of operation on
a sister property, taking the post
of jackaroo on “Restdown” Station,
near Cobar, the property of Mr. A.
Burgess. His dudes here proved
more strenuous, and the serious
business of stockraising found in
him a very apt and earnest student.

that was possible on this station, he

made of that district, with its
central town of Goondiwindi, a
region of pastoral industry noted
throughout the Commonwealth. In
1906 Mr. Evans purchased his
father’s interest in the property,
and has since conducted operations
solely on his own behalf. He is
prominent not only in his capacity
as a large landholder and breeder
of stock, but also as a townsman of
Goondiwindi and a citizen of
Queensland and the Commonwealth.

dial interest in all movements hav-

porter of the dashing game of polo,
a game which was very popular in
the district. This was his favourite
field sport, and for three years he
occupied the presidential chair of
the Goondiwindi Polo Club. In 1906
Mr. Evans married Hilda, third
daughter of the late Alexander
McKenzie, a well-known figure
among the pastoralists of the Cook-
town district of Northern Queensland
and a descendant of the McKenzie
clan so prominent in the history of
Scotland many centuries ago.

brilliant bowling performance on this
occasion was presented with an in-

club, of which also he was made an
honorary member for three years.
He won the bowling average for the
first eleven of the St. Kilda Cricket
Club, and on one occasion repre-
sented Victoria against New South
Wales in interstate lawn tennis. Mr.
Ross’s personality endeared him to
all at the school (of which he was one
of the first prefects), and upon his
leaving the unusual honour of a
presentation by masters and boys
was accorded him. His schooldays
past, he left Victoria, and went
for pastoral experience to “Myall
Creek” Station, in the Inverell dis-
trict of New South Wales. Subse-
quently he joined his brother in a
small sheep-grazing property, situ-
ated near Kyneton, Victoria, and
later the “Strathaird” Estate, near
Goulburn, New South Wales, was
acquired by the firm, this being
managed by Mr. Hugh Ross during
the few years that it remained in
their possession. In 1881 Mr. Ross
married a daughter of the late Cap-
tain Zouch, of Goulburn, and re-
turning to Victoria again took up
his residence at Kyneton, where he
continued with his brother until 1884,

Jenkins, acquiring with the property
some 60,000 sheep and several
thousand head of cattle. This con-
nection was discontinued at the end
of a year, when a division of the
property took place, Mr. Ross re-
taining the portion known as the
river country and “Boobera,” on
which was situated the original
homestead and buildings, his part-

occasion, when pressed for time, he
drove them 60 miles without a halt,
doing the distance in seven and a
half hours. Upon the expiration of
his lease in 1905, “Serpentine” was
offered to the Government for sub-
divisional purposes. The offer not
being accepted, eventually the pro-
perty was purchased by Mr. Ross in
conjunction with the late Mr. John
Cooke. These gentlemen decided to
subdivide it on their own account,
and in about 12 months’ time the
whole of it, together with the
adjoining estate, “Silesiam Downs,”
acquired by Mr. Ross from the
executors of the late J. Russell, was
disposed of to neighbouring farmers
at a handsome profit. Having sold all

Ross decided to come to Queensland,

run with the sheep, and at the time
of writing (1917) there is a superior
herd of purebred Herefords on the
property. Deeming it advisable to
secure some cheaper breeding coun-
try for cattle, in 1910 Mr. Ross
purchased the “Chudleigh Park”
Estate from Mr. Tom Ellis, of New
South Wales, a property lying on
the basalt tableland, about 140 miles
north of Hughenden. At the time
this carried about 13,000 head of
shorthorn cattle, and promised to
be a profitable investment, but,
unfortunately, after it had been in
possession of Mr. Ross for about
three years the manager (Mr. Robert
Watson) died, and not caring to in
stal another manager in a place so
remote, he disposed of the run.

subsequently subdivided into small
blocks and sold to adjoining farmers
and graziers. As a bigger area of
dry country suitable for the breeding
of sheep became a necessity, in 1913
Mr. Ross purchased from the late
Mr. Charles Bailey “Minnel,” a
grazing farm, situated about 27
miles from “Callandoon,” and 10
miles distant from Toobeah railway
station, with which place it is con-
nected by telephone. The garden at
“Minnel” is celebrated for its fine
citrus fruits, oranges and lemons of
superior quality being produced
there in great abundance. Mr.
Ross’s last investment in pastoral
lands was the purchase of “Glen-
earn” leasehold, in the Surat dis-
trict, at the latter end of 1914, just
on the eve of the worst drought ever
known in that part of the country,
in consequence of which he suffered
very heavy losses. Like the majority
of pastoralists, however, he has kept
his optimistic spirit all through, and
considers that the future holds ex-
cellent prospects for the industry in
Queensland. Mr. Ross has always
been distinguished for a recognition
of his obligations outside of his own
private interests, and whilst resident
in Victoria held the Commission of
the Peace for many years, and acted
as returning officer for the electoral
district of Dalhousie. At “Serpen-
tine” he was a member of the East
Loddon Shire Council, and he also
was paid the compliment of being
shearing and kindred matters were
adjusted. Being generally acknow-
ledged as a keen judge of horses, he
frequently acted in that capacity for
the Royal Agricultural Society of

Victoria, his services also being fre-
quently requisitioned in connection
with many of the leading shows of
that State. The homestead at “800-
bera,” which forms the temporary
residence of Mr. Ross and his family,
is prettily situated on the bank of
the Boobera Lagoon, one of the finest
inland sheets of water in New South
Wales, and though unpretentious
laid on to all parts of the house and
garden. There is also an excellent
hot-water service, and in addition to
the lagoon water an abundance of
rainwater is conserved in tanks. As
a result of these arrangements, dur-
ing the period of the great drought,
no anxiety was experienced in regard
to the water supply, either for
garden or household purposes. There
is also an air-gas service, and excel-
lent sanitary arrangements, includ-
ing a septic tank. Mr. Rcss’s first
wife died in 1907. He married for
the second time in 1912, Emily,
daughter of the late Mr. F. Hines,
of “Merri Merrigal” Station, New
South Wales. His family consists of
three sons and three daughters. Of
these the eldest daughter is the wife
of Mr. E. J. Hamilton, of Victoria,
in which State she resides ; while the
second daughter married Hr. Spen-
cer Roberts, formerly of Toowoomba,
but now practising at Stanthorpe.
Of the sons, the eldest, Mr. Mac-
donald Ross, present manager of
“Callandoon” Station, was educated
at the Brighton Grammar School,
thence proceeding to the University
of Melbourne, where he became resi-
dent at Trinity College. Whilst
there he won his blue for running
and cricket, and in intercollegiate
contests won the 440 and 120 yards
hurdles championships. He was a
contestant in the event for the
amateur championship of Victoria
over hurdles, being beaten on the

stand, and from this the water is
tape by the narrow margin of three
inches. Upon leaving the University
he served his articles to the legal
profession, and was admitted to
practise as a solicitor at the


Victorian Bar. About this time, how-
ever, his father having decided to
leave Victoria for Queensland, Mr.
Macdonald Ross determined to
abandon his profession for the freer
country life, for which he had always
cherished an inclination. At the
latter end of 1913 he met with a
serious polo accident, and was com-
pelled to spend the greater part of
12 months in hospital. Thanks,
however, to the wonderful surgical
skill of his medical attendants, he
made a complete recovery, and has
since been able to resume his duties
on the station with almost all of his
former energy and vigour. In 1910
he married Miss Clarice Robertson,
of Victoria, and has two sons and
a daughter. Mr. Jack Ross, the
second son, attended the Brighton
Grammar School with his brother
for a time, but deciding early in
favour of a country life, he became
a student at the Dookie Agricultural
College for several years, subsequent
to which he assisted in the manage-
ment of the “Serpentine” Estate.
He accompanied his father to
Queensland, and after a few years’
experience on “Callandoon” em-
barked on independent operations on
“Boobera” Estate, which had been
presented to him by his father. This
area proving too confined for his
ambition, he acquired the “Banga-
low” grazing farm, situated between
Goondiwindi and Milmerran, which
he at once took steps to improve.
Mr. Jack Ross spent several thou-
sands of pounds in ringbarking and
in clearing the country of prickly
pear, and is reaping the benefit of
this outlay, the “Bangalow” area
sustaining a herd of some 2,000 head
of cattle. Shortly after acquiring
these properties the present war
broke out, and as soon as he was
assured of his brother’s recovery he
volunteered for active service, being
among the first to join the Colours.
He sailed for the front with the
sth Light Horse as quartermaster-
farrier-sergeant, and took part in
the campaigns in Egypt and Galli-
poli. From the peninsula he was
invalided to London, and after
being many months in hospital there
eventually was ordered back to Aus-
tralia and discharged as unfit for
further duty. He is now engaged
in the administration of his pastoral
interests. Mr. Jack Ross in his
younger days was an athlete of some
note, and among other distinctions
won the old boy’s championship of
his school over three distances, his
brother, Macdonald, having scored
a similar triumph the previous year.
The youngest son, Frank Ross,
received his education at the Mel-
bourne Grammar School, Victoria,
leaving the institution when 18
years of age. After spending a few
months with his father at "Boo-
bera,” he returned to Victoria, and
joining the artillery sailed for
France early in 1916. After serving
with his battery for 15 months he
was wounded by shrapnel in the
shoulder, but the wound not being
of a serious nat ~e he soon was able
to rejoin his battery. Miss Marcia
Ross, the youngest member of the
family, is finishing her education at
the Glennie School, Toowoomba.
Like the other members of the
family, she has displayed a penchant
for sport, and two years in succes-
sion won the tennis championship of
the school, thereby securing the cup
presented under those conditions.
ARTHUR PETHER, of “Wagoo”
Station, St. George, Queensland,
was born at Rosedale, near Sale,
MR. ARTHUR PETHER.
in the Gippeland district of Victoria,
on December 9, 1870. He is the
third son of the late Henry Pether,
an Englishman, who was one of the
earliest free settlers to arrive in
Tasmania. The late gentleman,
while in his teens, removed to the
mainland, and found employment
on pastoral runs in South Australia,
later removing to Victoria, where
he followed grazing pursuits for some
years. He was a lover of a good
horse, and in the early days was a
strong supporter of racing both in
Victoria and New South Wales.
Prior to the death of his father the
subject of our review started on his
own account, leasing land on the
Kiandra Ranges, New South Wales,
also at Hay in that State. For some
time he was a well-known figure on
the stock routes of the Mother
State, and he gained some notice as
a dealer in sheep and cattle, at
times in large numbers. With the
coming of the drought in 1906 Mr.
Pether was compelled to seek grass
for his stock, and directing his foot-
steps towards Queensland he was
successful in finding good pastures
on his holding. With the assistance
of the New South Wales Govern-
ment he railed 1,000 head of mixed
cattle and a quantity of plant from
Tumut to Coonamble, personally
supervising the transfer, and even-
tually, after a considerable amount
of searching, arrived at what is now
known as “Wagoo” Station. Follow-
ing the discovery of this tract of
country he disposed of his property
in New South Wales in 1908, and
came to reside permanently in
Queensland. Mr. Pether adopted
the native name of “Wagoo” for his
holding, which is a leasehold of
20,000 acres, situated at the junc-
tion of the Maranoa and Condamine
Rivers, the stream at that point
being known as the Balonne River.
“Wagoo” is highly improved, the
property being fenced and sub-
divided into a number of paddocks
of convenient sizes. The timber has
been “rung,” and there is a plen-
tiful supply of water for all purposes.
The homestead is situated some 22
miles from St. George township,
the nearest railway station being
Thallon, distant about 74 miles.
The country carries cattle, horses,
and sheep, and the keen judg-
ment of the proprietor is best
evidenced by the fact that the
“Wagoo” stock invariably brings the
best ruling market rates. Principal
attention is given to the raising of
sheep, but a goodly number of cattle
and horses are run on the station.
Mr. Pether gives most of his time
to the development of his enterprise,
but the various local sporting bodies
count him as a sound supporter, and
his name appears in the membership
list of several clubs. He was married
in 1896 to a daughter of the late
James Hurle, of Hay, New South
Wales, and has a family of two sons
and four daughters.

stitution, Mr. Coventry found it
necessary to relinquish his northern
proposition, and disposing of his in-
terest in “Woodhouse” to his part-
ner, the late Mr. Scott, he came to
a more southern locality, purchas-
ing the old “Goondiwindi” Station
from a family of the name of Mar-
shall. After remaining on this hold-
ing for about a decade, he sold out
to the “Callandoon” Estate and re-
turned to the home of his childhood
in the New England district of New
South Wales, whither he had come
from his native Scotland in his early
teens. Settling once more at “Blair
Hill,” he spent the declining years
of his life in retirement, and died in
his eightieth year, having proved
himself a good citizen, a faithful
friend, and a pioneer, the record of
whom honours the pages of this work.
The gentleman under review, Mr.
John Barker Coventry, received his
education at the Glen Innes Gram-
mar School, and upon the comple-
tion of his studies followed in the
footsteps of his forbears, both in the
old country and the new, turning
his attention naturally to matters
connected with stock and landed in-
terests. Through the years of his
latter teens, and for some time sub-
sequently, he continued to reside
on the parental estate, eventually
assuming the reins of control on his
father’s behalf. In his twenty-seventh

year he launched out on his own
account, and in 1901 purchased
his present holding, “Strathalpine,”
from the late J. K. Mackay, the
improvement and development of
which has absorbed the whole of his
time and energies ever since. The
estate consists of both freehold and
leasehold land, aggregating about
14,000 acres, which is devoted chiefly
to cattle, although the culture of
tobacco is also carried on to some
extent. It is situated on both sides
of the River Dumeresq, which at
this point is known by the name of
“Severn,” and a pleasant locality
has been chosen for the homestead,
which though comfortable and suited
to the present requirements of the
family, is destined at no very dis-
tant date to give way to a more
modern and commodious structure.
Mr. Coventry takes considerable in-
terest in the advancement of the
district, and plays his part con-
scientiously as a citizen whose aim
is to improve the conditions under
which he and his compatriots are
living, whilst he is a consistent sup-
porter of charitable and patriotic
organizations. He received the
Commission of the Peace over a de-
cade ago. Married in 1903 to Ethel,
daughter of the late T. Boland, a
well-known vigneron of Lochinvar, in
the Maitland district of New South
Wales, he has a family of two sons
and one daughter.


PATRICK FLEMMING, “Tra-
lee,” Texas, one of the best-known
characters of the border districts of
Queensland and New South Wales,
is an Irishman hailing from Tralee,
County Kerry, where he was born
on March 17, 1849. The cognomen
of Flemming was one of the most
ancient family names in that part of
the Emerald Isle, where his father
had resided for a lengthy period,
but owing to the “distressful” con-
ditions prevailing in his native land
during his boyhood but few educa-
tional avantages were available to
this descendant of a good old Celtic
stock. In his early youth he reaped
the benefits of some instruction bv
the religious order known as the
Christian Brothers, and thencefor-
ward his training was almost wholly
on practical and utilitarian lines.
While still in his teens he left his

native land for the distant shores of
Australia, of which country many
romantic stories had found their
way to the Old World. Mr. Flem-
ming arrived in Sydney on January
23, 1867, by the old emigrant ship
“Light Brigade,” and obtained his
first employment on a farm in the
Singleton district of the Mother
State. He soon became proficient in
guiding a plough and in handling
stock, at the time when a work-
ing day of 14 hours’ duration
was nothing out of the com-
mon on a wage of 10s. a week,
with bed and board thrown in. The
rise of the tin-mining industry at
Stanthorpe, Queensland, in 1872,
considerably improved the prospects
of the worker, and Mr. Flemming
lost no time in proceeding to the
scene of activity, riding the whole
distance from Singleton to the tin-
fields, undeterred by the incredibly
rough experiences encountered on
the route. Almost immediately he
obtained work at 10s. per day, and
for four years continued on the
mines, during which period he de-
nied himself all but the barest neces-
saries of life in his endeavour to
gather sufficient capital to make
a beginning in another direction
on his own account. At length
he saw his way clear to take up a
block of land of 320 acres in the
locality which has since become
known as Borella, which was the
name given by him to his homestead
in very early days, and so earned
the distinction of being the pioneer
of small settlement on the border
country at a period when there was
not a foot of land taken up on either
side of the river, except as pastoral
leasehold. For years it was uphill
work to make ends meet, and in
order to raise funds for the proper
development of his holding Mr.
Flemming was wont to accept

pastoralists in the vicinity, leaving
his young wife and little children to
struggle on as best they might under
the shelter of the small humpy which
formed their first home. In course
of time, however, the day arrived
when he felt he might safely proceed
wuth the improvement of his land,
delayed by the prolonged absence
which had rendered real progress
impossible; and so marked was the
financial result of this change of
policy that before long he found
himself in a position to purchase an
adjoining block of similar size to
his earlier holding, thus doubling
his chances of success. With the

development of his 640 acres a pros-
perous future was assured, and
henceforward Mr. Flemming, with
an eye to the settlement of his child-
ren after him, embraced various


opportunities for the judicious ac-
quirement of further property, and
at the present time (1916) he owns
over 2,000 acres of freehold, in ad-
dition to several thousand acres held
on lease, the whole being adminis-
tered by the various members of his
family. The estate, which has five
miles’ frontage to the Uumaresq
River, is mainly devoted to cattle,
though a considerable quantity of
tobacco is cultivated. The old home,
“Borella,” is now leased by Mr.
Flemming to his son-in-law, Mr.
Henry A. Patterson, he himself,
with his good wife, now living in
retirement at Texas. A shrewd,
hard-headed man, he has made ex-
cellent use of his money, the value
of which he learned in a hard school,
and he now contributes of his super-
fluity to the many charitable and
patriotic objects deserving of sup-
port —the cause of Ireland and the
Roman Catholic Church being spe-
cial objects of his bounty. He has
played a prominent part in the
support of the church in the
neighbourhood, almost from the
foundation of his homestead having
thrown it open as a meeting-place
for the adherents of that faith for
the celebration of Ploly Mas’s. Mr.
Flemming married, on November 17,
1870, at Singleton, New South
Wales, Ellen, daughter of the late
Cornelius McPhillips, of Balie-
borough, County Cavan, Ireland—-
an old Celtic family dating back for
homestead so well known by travellers
in that district. Her energy, industry,
and patience were big factors in the
scheme of prosperity now so happily
achieved by this couple, and the

respect and esteem in which they
are by their fellow-members of
tlie community in Texas.

“Murragoran” is situated on the

Goondiwindi township. The estate
comprises over 2,000 acres of freehold
land, undulating in character, with
some rich river flats, and has
proved highly suitable both for
grazing and cultivation, to which
purposes it is applied by Mr. Nor-
man Marshall. Originally the whole
of the country was timbered, but a
certain amount of clearing has been
done, as, for instance, on the 300
acres which are now devoted to
wheat-growing. Cattle are grazed in

and dates its foundation back to the
early forties. It thus holds its own as
one of the earliest settlements of a
pastoral nature in south-western
Queensland, “Umbercollie” being in
full swing as a mixed sheep and
cattle station long before the incep-
tion of Goondiwindi township. Sub-
sequently the station passed into the
hands of the late Mr. Dines, a name
prominently known in the history of
the pastoral industry in the Border
district, where he owned large areas
of land, both in Queensland and
New South Wales. From this
gentleman it was purchased by the
Messrs. Marshall Brothers, which
firm included in its personnel the
late Harry Marshall, the oldest iden-

sold to Messrs. Bell & Hyde (the
first-named partner being the father
of the present Mr. Ernest Thomas

expert knowledge and ability which
he is able to bring upon this im-
portant departure, must shortly take
a foremost position among similar
enterprises in the State. The late
William Henry Treweeke was born
on April 24, 1837, in Cornwall,
England, where his father owned
and worked farm property. Being
of an adventurous nature, and
realizing the limited opportunities
afforded by the Homeland, the young
Cornishman responded readily to the
idea of working out a career in a
far-distant country, where every-
thing was still in the making,
and eventually he decided to
seek the greater freedom and
wider scope which the new land
offered. He reached Orange, New
South Wales, in the year 1857, and
for a time after his arrival pursued
the arduous life of a miner, but it
was to follow the occupation of a
grazier that he had come to Aus-
tralia, and he soon left the gold-
fields. He first became interested in
station property near Orange, to-
gether with two brothers, but after
a few years of successful operations
preferred to strike out alone, and
sold his interest right out to the
brothers. At that time the very rich
pastoral lands of Queensland were
attracting great attention, and Mr.
Treweeke, deciding to make a per-
sonal inspection of the country,
eventually became the possessor of
“Umbercollie” in June, 1875. Mr.
Treweeke pursued the vigorous de-
velopment of the land, which already
has been outlined, and continued the
personal administration of his estates
until the time of his death, which
occurred in 1886. After taking up
his residence at “Umbercollie” he

always cordially recognized his duty
to the community of which he was a
member, and took an active interest
in the progress of the district. He
occupied a seat on the local divi-
sional board, and identified himself
in whole-hearted manner with all
movements tending to the public
welfare. The late Mr. Treweeke
married in 1862 Maria Theresa,
daughter of the late Richard Glas-
son, of “Godolphin” Station, in the
Orange district, and of this union
there was issue three sons and three
daughters. After his demise the
management of “Umbercollie” was
entrusted to the capable hands of
Mr. D. M. Cameron, now of “Well-
town” Station, until the eldest son
of the family—Mr. William Henry
Treweeke'—became sufficiently ex-
perienced to assume control. This
gentleman continued to hold the
reins until the year 1900, when he
transferred them to Mr. Richard
Hugo Treweeke, himself removing
to New South Wales, where he is
now well known in the district sur-
rounding Mungindi as proprietor of

He married in 1872 Mary Ursula
Dillon, daughter of the late Captain
Boyce, of Sydney, by which union
there was issue three sons and two
daughters. Of the sons Mr. Bur-
goyne Tomkins received his educa-
tion at the high school, East
Maitland, and upon the completion
of his scholastic course joined the
staff of the Australian Joint Stock
Bank, now the Australian Bank of
Commerce, choosing clerical work
for the time being to give himself
an opportunity of recovering from
the serious effects of a riding acci-
dent which he had met with in his
eighteenth year. The excellent com-
mercial training which he received
during the short period he remained
in the service of the bank since has
proved of considerable value to him.
Being anxious, however, to follow
his original intention of engaging in
pastoral enterprise, he resigned his
position when he felt that he was
sufficiently recovered, and under the
tuition of one of his brothers gained

again changed hands, Messrs. Cook

Mr. Tomkins, as already written.
“Moogoon” comprises over 60,000
acres of country, mostly flat, with
occasional ironstone ridges, and is
fenced and subdivided into 15 pad-
docks of varying size. It is well
grassed with natural pasturage, in
addition to which a considerable
area has been placed under Rhodes

include box, belar, and brigalow.
The Coomooran Creek, a waterway
of considerable dimensions, flows

smaller streams add their quota to
the main source of supply. Several
dams have been constructed to con-

has specialized in'the breeding of a
good utility type of station draught

have met with marked success in
the local show-ring. A superior class
of polo pony is also bred at “Moo-
goon,” and Mr. Tomkins is recog-
nized as one of the largest breeders
of this kind of stock in the Com-
monwealth. Before the outbreak of
the present war he was successful in
disposing of a large number of these
ponies. In 1914 he purchased
“Blythdale,” in the Roma district,
and has since worked this holding
in conjunction with “Moogoon,”
using it principally as a breeding
station. He interests himself in the
advancement of the district, and has

ANDREW FITZHERBERT
EVANS, “Oona Yale,” Goondi-
windi, was born near Dalby, Queens-
land, on December 13, 1867, and is
the eldest son of the late Augustus
MR. AUGUSTUS FITZHEEBERT EVANS.
Fitzherbert Evans, a prominent
Queensland pastoralist of an earlier
period of the history of the State.
The father of the last-named gentle-
man was Andrew Fitzherbert Evans,
a native of Wales, England, who for
a considerable time held rank as an
officer in the Indian Army. Upon
the late seventies. His son, the
above-mentioned Augustus F. Evans,
from an early age was associated
with his father in stock and station
enterprise, and while still quite a lad
was entrusted by his father with the
management of “Stonehenge,” a
property on the Downs. His capable
and efficient handling of the prop-
erty soon attracted the favourable
comment of those who were fitted to
judge of efficiency in this direction,
and he was offered the management
of “St. Ruth” station by the North
British Australasian Company,
which he accepted. During the years
that he held this position the late
gentleman brought to bear upon his
work the same excellent judgment
and expert knowledge that had for-
merly distinguished his control of
affairs at “Stonehenge,” and as time
passed, having considerably aug-
mented his experience by virtue of
the extended period of his connec-
tion with the industry, he found
himself chosen for further promo-
tion. About this time the resignation
of the general manager of the com-
pany occurred, and the vacant
appointment was offered to Mr.
Evans, by whom it was accepted
and retained for 16 years. He was
highly successful in this capacity,
and the affairs of the company en-
joyed an era of prosperity under his
control. At the clase of the period
devoted his personal attention to its
development. A few years later he
went into complete retirement at
“Mount Gordon,” the original home
of the Evans family in Queensland,
MR. ANDREW FITZHERBERT EVANS.
and so named in honour of Mr.
Evans’s maternal grandfather, Cap-
tain George Gordon, an old Scottish
shipmaster, who is recorded to have
been among the earliest maritime
visitors to Australian shores. This
home, which was occupied by the
Andrew Fitzherbert Evans of an
his retirement from that service he
came, to Australia, and engaged in
pastoral pursuits in New South

century ago, his death occurring in

referred to, the late Mr. Evans re-
tired to his own estate, “Rockland,”
near Warwick, which he had
acquired during the course of his
connection with the company, and
earlier era for many years, is now
used as a town residence by the
gentleman under review, who, with
his family, spends the major por-
tion of the summer season there. Mr.

the guidance of his father at Tool-
burra, near Whrwick, where the
family resided after the late gentle-
man assumed the duties of general
manager of the North British Aus-
tralasian Company. At 18 he had
shown himself sufficiently advanced
four years at “Rockland,” during
which he made himself thoroughly
conversant with the various branches
of work connected with stock hand-
ling, and having attained to man’s
estate, was eager to test his acquire-
ments in a more difficult field. This
was provided in the shape of a new
property which had just been taken
up by the late Mr. Evans, consisting
of portions of the old “Callandoon’’
and “Winton” properties, shortly
before thrown open by the Govern-
ment of the day for closer settlement
purposes. With his brother, George,
the young pastoralist transferred his
attention to this estate, which was
called “Oona Vale,” and for six
years, together they bent their ener-
gies to the development of the hold-
ing on up-to-date lines, proving the
stuff of which they were made by the
excellent work accomplished during
that time. When at length the late
Augustus F. Evans retired from
“Rockland,” he recalled his son
George to take over control of that
property, leaving the elder brother
to continue the administration of
“Oona Vale.” These properties, to-
gether with the old family residence,
“Mount Gordon,” are now held by
the executors of the late Mr. Evans’s
estate on behalf of the widow and
family. Mr. Andrew Fitzherbert

third son of the late Augustus F.
Evans, already referred to. During
his lifetime he took a keen interest
in the advancement of the district,
and was elected a member of the
Rosenthal Shire Council, for a term
holding office as chairman. He mar-
ried in 1901 Miss Alice Bennett, sis-
ter of Mrs. A. F. Evans, of “Oona
Yale,” by whom he had issue two
sons and a daughter. His wife pre-
deceased him by about two years.
The second son of the late Augus-
tus F. Evans, Mr. Leonard Edward
Duff Evans, for several years was
an officer connected with the Queens-
land National Bank, Warwick, and
subsequently joined the permanent
staff of the old Queensland Military
Forces, attaining to the rank of
lieutenant. At a later date he be-
came interested in farming pursuits
in the Warwick district, where he
now resides. He married Miss Wind-
year, of Sydney, in 1900, and has
one son and two daughters.
ALBERT EDWARD BRACKER,
J.P., “Edgecumbe,” Texas, was
born at “Warroo” Station, Southern
Queensland, on August 2, 1864,
being the youngest son of the late
Moore, Brisbane.
MR. ALBERT EDWARD BRACKER.
Frederick Bracker, one of the pas-
toral pioneers of this State, who
came from his parental home in Ger-
many when quite a young man to
throw in his lot with those who took
upon themselves the task of carving
out homes and fortunes from virgin
scrub and untouched forest tracts in
the land of the Southern Cross. He
is recorded as having been associated
with “Rosenthal” Station in the
capacity of manager, and is remem-
bered by breeders of merino sheep in
the early days as one whose expert
knowledge of that type of animal
was responsible to some extent for
its introduction to Queensland and
the consequent success of the breed
on the pastoral areas of this country.
In the early forties he took up a
block of land and founded”Warroo”
Station, which was held directly by
his sons after him until 1912, when
it was sold by them to the present
owners (the Underwood family),
being one of the comparatively
few properties in Queensland which
have remained in the hands of
the same family connection for
over half a century. The late Fred-
erick Bracker married a Miss Ross,
who came from Scotland in the early
days with her father, who after-
wards became one of the pioneer
pastoral settlers on the “edge of
beyond,” and of the union there
was a family of nine children, the
surviving sons being still connected
with the pastoral and grazing indus-
try. The subject of this memoir,
Mr. A. E. Bracker, received his
education at the Toowoomba Gram-
mar School, and concluding his
scholastic course at that institution
at 17 years of age he returned to the
place of his birth, and applied him-
self to the acquirement of stock and
station experience. The properties
in the vicinity of his own station-
home mostly carried mixed stock,
and sheep, cattle, and horses all
found place on his father’s estate,
which comprised other pastoral areas
at some distance from the parent
run. Young Bracker, therefore,
undertook the duty of droving the
flocks or herds along the tracks from
station to station, the whole proposi-
tion being under the management of
his eldest brother, Mr. H. Bracker.
In this way he obtained valuable
experience in various departments of
the station industry, and after about
12 months of droving life returned
to headquarters, where he enlarged
his knowledge in a general way by
work among the stock on the home
pastures, taking considerable respon-
sibility upon his shoulders and fre-
quently assuming the management
of the estate during his brother’s
absence. When eventually “War-
roo” w T as sold the partnership which
existed between the brothers until
1912 terminated, and the gentleman
under review came to Texas, where
he purchased the landed interests of
Mr. Edwin Hollingsworth, an old
identity of the district, and settled
down to the development of the
“Edgecumbe” estate. Here he in-
augurated grazing operations on a
fairly extensive scale, his previous
experience proving very valuable in
the building up of a prosperous
business proposition, which also in-
cluded the cultivation of tobacco,
MR. EDWARD BOYD CULLEN.
a crop in the production of which
Texas may be said to be the Queens-
land centre. With his brothers, Mr.
Bracker has obtained a well-deserved
reputation as a judge of the various
breeds of cattle, and in this connec-
tion it may be mentioned that the
property, “Lesbrook,” now owned
by Mr. William Bracker, which is
part of the old “Warroo” area, is
noted for carrying the most splen-
didly-bred stud stock in the Com-
monwealth. Whilst resident on
“Warroo” the various members of
the family found themselves called
upon to sacrifice a considerable
amount of time and thought to the
demands made upon them in the
interests of the general community,
to whom the advancement of the
district and the improvement of con-
ditions of industry, trade, etc., were
very vital matters to be dealt with
by the most capable and able men
in their midst. Feeling himself thus
adequately represented by his elder
brothers, Mr. A. E. Bracker took
advantage of the exemption allowed
him to pursue the more diligently
his study of the numerous details in
connection with their joint private
enterprise, and though far from in-
different to the well-being and pro-
gress of the place he has confined his

WILLIAM JAMES HOOPER,
J.P., “Tallwood” Station, Goondi-
windi district, was born at Rand-
wick, Sydney, on January 27, 1855,
and is the second son of the late
MR. WILLIAM JAMES HOOPER.
George Hooper, a native of Stroud,
Gloucestershire, England, who while
yet in his teens turned his back
upon the old Homeland to carve out
a career for himself under Southern
skies. Sprung from a race of farm-
ers, upon his arrival in Australia
in the early thirties, he directed his
attention to agrarian pursuits in
New South Wales, and is recorded
as having been one of the first two
purchasers of land at Randwick.
His energy and industry com-
manded success, and in 1864 he dis-
posed of the major portion of his
property in the Mother State to
enter upon pastoral enterprise on
his own account at “Hawkwood”
Station, in the Burnett district of
Queensland, now owned by Mr. De
Burgh Persse. He carried on
operations here for 20 years, during
which period he experienced his full
share of the difficulties that invari-
ably beset the path of the pioneer
pastoralist, both droughts and
floods being included among his
setbacks. After disposing of “Hawk-
wood” he visited his old home in
England, and upon his return to
Queensland lived in retirement
until his death, which took place at
Brisbane in 1888, by which event
the State lost a good citizen and the
pastoral industry one of its wor-
thiest pioneers. The late gentleman
was survived by a family of three
sons and four daughters. Mr. W.
J. Hooper received his education at
a private college at Randwick, leav-
ing school to join his father at
“Hawkwood” in January, 1869.
He continued to reside on the sta-
tion until the property was sold, in
the intervening years gradually
taking over the management, re-
lieving his aged parent of respon-
sibility. After the property was
acquired by Mr. De Burgh Persse
his services as manager were re-
tained by that gentleman for two
years, and in 1887 Mr. Hooper
joined Mr. Sydney Wallace-Barnett
in securing an eight years’ lease of
“Merriwa” Station, on the borders
of Queensland and New South
Wales. At the expiration of the
lease this partnership was dissolved
by mutual consent, and in 1894 Mr.
MR. G. W. BURNRTT HOOPER.
Hooper purchased “Tallwood” graz-
ing farm, embracing the old “Tail-
wood” homestead and its surround-
ing 20,000 acres, to the administra-
tion of which he has since given his
personal attention. The country at
the time of Mr. Hooper’s first
occupation was chiefly a dense belar
scrub, with very little carrying
capacity for stock, but during the
15 years of his residence on the
property he has directed his best
efforts to the task of subduing
Nature to his own ends, and has
achieved an immense amount of
developmental work, with the result
that “Tallwood” is now considered
one of the most highly-improved
grazing farms in Southern Queens-
land. “Tallwood” is situated in
the near vicinity of the railway
station of that name, some 54 miles
west of Goondiwindi, on the South-
western line. It is a portion of one
of the numerous old pastoral runs
which were subdivided into com-
paratively small blocks and thrown
open for selection by the Govern-
ment of the day, in 1890 and 1899
respectively. He retired from the
personal control of the place in
1908, since which date he has re-
sided at Markwell Street, in the
picturesque suburb of Hamilton,
contenting himself with occasional
visits to “Tallwood” and other pro-
perties in which he is financially
interested. Mr. Hooper is a mem-
ber of several organizations con-
nected with the pastoral industry in
Queensland, among his other offices
serving as one of the two representa-
tives of the pastoralists of Queens-
land on the Queensland State Wool
Committee. He is president of the
Queensland Grazing Farmers and
Selectors’ Association, of which he
was one of the founders, a body
which has been responsible for many
of the excellent provisions embodied
in the land laws of the State, and
which has done much in the inter-
ests of closer settlement, to the
great advantage of the community
in general. He has always dis-
played an active and intelligent in-
terest in the public affairs of the

Mr. Hooper married in 1887 Ade-
laide, daughter of the late William
Henry Baynes, a pioneer of 1852,
who in that year came from Eng-
land to Victoria, where he was num-
bered for a time among the gold-
diggers at Ballarat. Mr. Baynes
afterwards settled in Melbourne for
known in connection with the de-
velopment of the meat-preserving
industry, which he assisted to
pioneer in the infant colony. He
was also identified in various other
ways with the commercial and social
life of the place, and for a time was
a partner, with Mr. T. B. Stephens,
in the proprietorship of The Courier
newspaper. He also figured in Par-
liamentary circles, during a portion
of the eighties representing the
Burnett district in the Legislative
Assembly. He died at Batavia on
September 4, 1898. Mr. and Mrs.
Hooper have a surviving family of
one son and three daughters. The
eldest son, the late G. W. Burnett
Hooper, enlisted in the Australian
Imperial Forces, and proceeded to
the front early in 1916 to “do his
bit” in the sanguinary conflict rag-
ing in Europe, by this act proving
himself a true citizen of the Empire.
He saw active service in France and
met a soldier’s death in the field of
action on February 27, 1917, being
killed by a shell which landed in the
trench his platoon was defending.

cal examples of the old-time station
dwellings. Additions to the original
structures, which were of very
modest dimensions, have been made
with due regard to artistic effect,
with the result that most picturesque
homes have been evolved from the
primitive abodes of pioneer times.
At “Newinga” the country is com-
fortably clothed with timber to
within close vicinity of the garden
fence, whilst at “Willarie” practic-
ally all the timber surrounding the
homestead area has been cut down.
Evidences of progressive spirits at
work abound in all directions on the
Goldsbrough, Mort, & Co., of Mel-
bourne, who had held possession of
the land for some considerable time.
In 1913 the adjoining property of
“Newinga” was acquired from
Messrs. Broughton & Burns, the
estate coming into the market
shortly after the death of the late
Mr. Broughton in the previous year.
CHARLES HOWARD WEBSTER
(the co-administrator with Mr.
Wright of these properties) was
born at East Melbourne, Victoria,
on August 26, 1877, and is a son
of the late John Webster, a well-
known pastoralist of the early days
of squatting enterprise in Victoria,


when as owner of “Cobram” and
“Kull’s Range” Stations his lies-
pitality and public spirit endeared
him to all those members of the
community who came within the

range of his activities. He was also
well esteemed in commercial circles,
having held mercantile interests in
Melbourne. Belonging to the band
of early pioneers who landed from
the Old Country in the early fifties
and took their part with their fel-
lows of the period in the building
up of the British Empire beyond
the seas, he deserves the grateful
recognition, not only of his imme-
diate descendants, but also of the
wider world of those who enjoy the
fruits of the labours of these
nation-builders, and are thus under
special obligation to every plucky
son of England, Scotland, and Ire-
land who braved the risks of the
unknown and gave of their best to
a country yet in its swaddling
clothes. The late Mr. Webster —
who hailed originally from Aber-
deen, where his progenitors had
long been established in commercial
pursuits —died in Melbourne in the
year 1887, leaving a family of three
sons and six daughters. The gentle-
man under review received his edu-
cation at East St. Hilda Grammar
School, St. Hilda, Victoria, and
having completed his collegiate course
at 17 years of age, he began commer-
cial life in the Melbourne office of
Messrs. McLean Brothers & Bigg,
where he obtained a useful training
in the methods of the mercantile
fraternity. A year later he decided
to direct his attention to the pas-
toral industry, and, taking a posi-
tion as jackaroo at “Newinga”—
then the property of Messrs. Scott
and Macmillan, the former of whom
still retains an interest in the sta-
tion—he gained his first experience
on the run of which he is now part
owner. After a couple of years, in
order to enlarge his knowledge of
the various branches of work con-
nected with the handling of sheep
and cattle, he undertook droving
and general stock work for about
five years, and when “Newinga”
was disposed of by Mr. Scott to
Messrs. Chapman & Higgins he was
offered the management of the
property by the new owners, on
whose behalf he held control for
about seven years. In 1907, when
the place again changed hands,
Mr. Webster became manager of
“Cobham Lake” and “Packsaddle”
Stations, New South Wales, proper-
ties comprising 2,400 square miles,
where he remained for nearly two
years. In 1909 he purchased
“Ballingarry,” on the Moonie
River, which however he sold
shortly afterwards, when he be-
came one of the proprietors of the
present company, and the firm hav-
ing been duly founded and launched
with the purchase, first of “Wil-
larie” and subsequently of “New-
iuga,” upon the acquirement of the
latter station he was at once in-
stalled thereon as resident partner
and manager, and has continued to
administer affairs ever since. The
South - western railway passes
through the “Newinga” estate, the
Gradule railway station being situ-
ated within its boundaries, while
60 miles away, in an easterly
direction, lies the thriving township
of Goondiwindi. A public-spirited
man, Mr. Webster has at heart the
advancement of the district in which
he resides, and on many occasions
has been asked to allow himself to
be nominated for offices in connec-
tion with the public organizations
controlling its welfare, but owing
to his remote position from the
general meeting-place, either at St.
George or Goondiwindi, and the
consequent loss of time which would
be entailed in travelling to and fro,
he has been unable to see his way

clear to accede to the requests of
his fellow-ratepayers. He, however,
takes an interest in all forms of
clean sport, being an active advo-
cate of cricket, tennis, etc., and a


patron of the “sport of kings” when
opportunity offers and his duties
allow him a respite. Mr. Webster
married in 1915 Ethel Alice, daugh-
ter of Mr. John Cameron, of Til-
quin, Bollon, Queensland —one of
the oldest pioneer pastoralists of the
State, whose name and family re-
cord are household words in the
western district—and has two sons.
BAKCLAY THOMSON WRIGHT
was born in Melbourne in 1886, and
is a son of Mr. James Wright, a
member of an old Scottish family
and one of the best-known mercan-
tile princes of the Victorian metro-
polis, whose arrival in Australia
dates back to about the same period
as that of the Websters, the Hentys,
the Riverina district. Here he
spent seven years in various capaci-
ties, and upon severing his con-
nection with this property came
to Queensland, where he spent
about 12 months on “Victoria
Downs” Station, near Charleville.
Here he remained until the forma-
tion of the Willarie Pastoral Co.,
when he undertook the management
of the “Willarie” run, and con-
tinued to control operations on this
property until June, 1916, when
the claim of the nation upon its
eligible men for military service
made its appeal to him, and he
voluntarily renounced his own per-
sonal ambitions and enlisted in the
Australian Imperial Forces, having
and has issue one son and two
daughters. Mr. Cramsie is a son of
the late John Cramsie, of the well-
known firm of Cramsie, Bowden,
and Co., who for many years had
large mercantile interests both in
Victoria and New South Wales.
For some nine years the late John
Cramsie represented the Balranald
electorate in the New South Wales
Parliament. He was at this time
a partner in “Strathdarr” and
“Cameron Downs,” two station
properties situated in Central
Queensland. The gentleman under
review, after many years of station
experience, became overseer and
acting-manager of “Strathdarr,”
subsequently becoming one of the

the Swallows, the Hosies, and other
well-known leading families of the
Garden State. Mr. Barclay Thom-
son Wright is a former student of
Scotch College, Melbourne, and in
his own person adds lustre to the
reputation of the old institution,
having, in common with many other
of the “old boys,” heard and
obeyed in these latter days the
bugle call of duty when the Mother-
land sounded the signal to arms in
defence of the high ideals of liberty
and peace only with honour. After
leaving school he spent a period in
a mercantile establishment in Mel-
bourne, and while still in his teens
took a post as jackaroo on Messrs.

since sailed for the scene of action.
The other three members of the
company —Messrs. J. Wright, Scott,
and Cramsie—have large interests
of their own, apart from their con-
nection with the above-mentioned
properties, Mr. Scott owning a
pastoral run at Moree, New South
Wales, and Mr. Cramsie, in addi-
tion to similar interests, extensive
mercantile enterprises in the same
State. Mr. Scott is a Victorian by
birth. His father, who hailed from
Scotland, was one of the pioneers of
the grazing industry in Victoria,
and held landed interests near
Ararat, in that State. Mr. J. T.
W. Scott married Agnes Don, a
daughter of the late John Webster,
founders and a partner in the
Longreach Wool Scouring and Meat
Extract Co., Cramsie, Central
Queensland, this township having
been named after him in view of
the fact that he was personally in-
terested in its creation. Mr. Cram-
sie has pastoral interests in New
South Wales, and is a shareholder
and managing director of the firm
of Cramsie & Lethbridge, Limited,
stock and station agents, Sydney,
He is also a member of the Stock
Owners’ Council of Advice for New
South Wales. In 1897 he married
a daughter of Mr. J. A. Mclntyre,
of “Waterloo” Station, Inverell,
New South Wales, and has one son
and two daughters.

with the late Neil Black, one of
the early pastoralists of that State.
Subsequently, he was offered, and
accepted, the control of “Spring
Vale” Station, Victoria, on behalf
of his brother-in-law, Mr. Donald
Swan, but whilst so engaged on that
property, was caught by the lure of
the red metal, and resigned his
duties to follow the rush to the
Ballarat gold diggings. Both here
and at Bendigo, he worked as a
prospector with little success, and,
eventually, returned to the pastoral
industry, joining the late Miles
Fletcher, a fellow gold-digger, of
whom he had made a mate, in the
selection of a property known as
“Nangeela,” situated on the Gle-
nelg River, which they worked as
a wool and mutton proposition. This
partnership was not of long dura-
tion, and the friends parting com-
pany by mutual consent, Mr. Taylor
returned to the “Spring Vale” dis-
trict, and resumed the manage-
ment of the property which he had
formerly relinquished. He con-
tinued at “Spring Vale” for some
years, becoming well and favourably
known in pastoral circles, and, at a
later date, found still larger scope
for his energies and gifts, as man-
ager of “Hyde Park” Station. Here
he remained until, under the Act
of 1865, he became a landowner on
his own account —selecting country
in the Dundas district, to which he
gave the name of “Rockbank.” He
remained there until 1877, when he
disposed of the holding, and came
to Queensland, where the “Merino
Downs” run previously had been
selected by his son, the subject of
this memoir, who had come from
Victoria in 1876 for that purpose.
The late Mr. Taylor lived at the
homestead, surrounded by his
family, until the time of his death
in 1890. A family of two sons and
five daughters survived him. One of
his sons, the late George Taylor,
jun., who held the “Merino Downs”
property after his father’s death,
has since died. The four surviving
daughters are all married to mem-
bers of the pastoral community in
Queensland. Mr. John Taylor, the
owner of “Russell Park,” was born
at “Nangeela” Station, Victoria, on
July 12, 1854. He received his edu-
cation under private tuition at the
homestead and, upon the termina-
tion of his studies, gained an ex-
cellent acquaintance with the de-
tails of station management at
“Nangeela,” under the guidance of
his father. He became highly pro-
ficient in the handling of stock,
and displayed so much efficiency
and judgment in pastoral matters
that, in 1876, he was commissioned
by his parent to come to Queens-
land in search of suitable country
to enable him to extend his field of
operations. After the expenditure
of considerable time and care, Mr.

variety of natural grasses, among
which bluegrass takes the principal
place, make the locality very valu-
able as a stock run, and the usual
herbage plants also flourish in
abundance according to their season.
The question of water supply was
early taken in hand by Mr. Tay-
lor, with the result that half-a-dozen
wells, fitted with windmills, and a
similar number of tanks of large
holding capacity, are now included
among the improvements of the run.
Among other work, ringbarking of
the original timber has been carried
on on an extensive scale, opening up
large areas of grass land, and less
than one half of the property now
remains untouched by the axe.
Contrary to the general practice
among pastoralists, Mr. Taylor,
although at that period unmarried,
built a homestead which, in every
respect, was well fitted to take its
place as one of the typical pastoral
homes of Queensland; so that, from
the first, he was able to spend his
leisure hours amid pleasant and con-
genial surroundings. The house was
erected about 1882, and still holds its
own among the more modern homes
of the district. In the early days it
was considered the leading station
residence in the neighbourhood of
Surat, and since the time when its
walls first were reared, it has been
the birthplace of Mr. Taylor’s seven
children. After the erection of the
homestead, Mr. Taylor gave his at-
tention to the important matter of
fencing, and, it is worthy of men-
tion, that he was the first in the
district to erect fencing capable of
withstanding the inroads of dogs
and marsupials, the whole of his
boundary being protected with
wire netting suitable to this purpose.
For his earliest, flocks he went to
“Bendango” Station, where the
famous “Talgai” blood was to be
procured, and later introduced stud
sheep from “Esk Yale” and
“Bellevue,” Tasmania, with the
best results. Until recently, Mr.
Taylor confined himself to these
strains, but the prominence at-
tained by “Wanganella” stock dur-
ing the past few years, could
scarcely be ignored by so far-
sighted a pastoralist, and, in course
of time, rams from the noted New
South Wales stud were purchased,
and have since left their stamp upon
the sheep. Having established his
flock on the soundest lines, Mr.
Taylor made a study of the types
produced by crossing of the various
strains, and, for the past few years,
has bred his own flock rams, his
experience in this direction, based
on observation, going to prove that
a greater measure of success was to
be obtained by the adoption of such
a procedure than by the continued
introduction of sires from other
places, where different conditions
prevail. For many years he has

excellence in the production of wool,
by showing what is possible in that
direction. The expert care and skill
exercised by Mr. Taylor is plainly
evidenced by the returns, “Rus-
sell Park” wool invariably topping
the price lists at the markets, and
by its excellence commanding a
ready sale whenever it is offered.
The carrying capacity of “Russell
Park” allows a flock of 10,000 sheep
to be depastured on the property all
the year round, excepting in
drought seasons, when it becomes
necessary to find other grazing
grounds for a portion of the stock.
There is seldom any diminution in
the size of the flock, but, in specially
favourable periods, the number has
been largely increased. In earlier
days, Mr. Taylor took a very promi-
nent part in local affairs, and gave
his personal attention and influence
to every movement tending to the
advancement of the district. On
two occasions he was elected chair-
man of the Warroo Shire Council, of
which body he was a member for
many years. He has been a member
of the Western Pastoralists’ Associa-
tion ever since the inception of that
body and, for a lengthy period,
served on the Council of the Asso-
ciation, while the Grazing Farmers’
Association of Queensland also
claims him as a member. He was
gazetted a Justice of the Peace by
the Nelson Administration in the
nineties, and has exercised the
Commission with fidelity ever since.

giving him prestige in this field, and
proving of considerable service in
various ways. Of a retiring dis-
position, he is slow to express his
opinion upon a subject, but, when
he gives voice to his sentiments,
his words carry weight, and he is
listened to with respect. Mr. Taylor
married in 1883 Anna Louisa,
daughter of the late David Frew,
a well-known personality all over
Australia in the days when railway
construction was first occupying the
attention of the ruling authorities.
The late gentleman was a Scots-
man, who came from the West
Indies to Australia at a time when
adventurous spirits from all parts
of the older world were drawn
hither by the sensational reports of
the outbreak of the Victorian gold-
diggings in the fifties. An accoun-
tant by profession, at a later date
he filled the appointment of senior
officer in the railway construction
branch, and brought to the dis-
charge of his duties a praiseworthy
zeal, which also distinguished him
when, as sometimes happened, he
gave his assistance to the promoters
of private enterprise in this avenue
of Empire development. Of the
union there is a family of five sons
and two daughters, of whom the

“WARROO” Station, the prop-
erty of the Underwood family. This
well-known pastoral holding, situ-
ated some thirty-five miles from St.
George, was taken up in the early
sixties by the McDougalls, the
country then being in its virgin
state. Later, it came into posses-
sion of a financial institution, from
which it was purchased by the late
Richard James John Underwood,
about the year 1890. The area then
was considerably larger than it is
to-day, the policy of resumption
adopted by the Government, and
selections from its acreage by the
smaller settlers (who have made ex-
cellent use of the holdings which
they were fortunate enough to se-
cure) having been responsible fcr

son of another Richard J. Under-
wood, whose father, the late James
Joseph Underwood, was the founder
of the family in Australia. The
last-named gentleman, hailing from
England well over a century ago,
was among the first of the pioneers
who trod the shores of New South
Wales, when Port Jackson was little
more than a village showing no
signs of becoming a populous and
prosperous seaport, while the site
upon which the City of Sydney now

stands, likewise, was primeval, un-
peopled bush. Mr. Underwood be-
came one of the original landholders
in the great Island-continent, and
his name has come down to posterity
as the founder of the historic Un-
derwood Estate, comprising lands at
Paddington, Summer Hill, Home-
bush, and other localities in Ihe
vicinity of Sydney. The progenitor
of a hardy and fearless race, he left
to his adopted country the legacy
of a family of sons and daughters
who, in their turn, have assisted in
populating many parts of Australia.
One of his sons—the abovementioned
Richard J. Underwood —held an
official post for many years under
Imperial Naval authority, and it
was his son again who, in course of
time, became the owner of “War-
roo” Station, and the immediate
predecessor of Messrs. Edward
Benam and Arthur Kingston Under-
wood, the present administrators of
the property. At the time of the
purchase by the late Mr. Under-
wood, “Warroo” was principally
worked as a cattle proposition, but,
more recently, following the ex-
ample of other large properties in
the district, sheep have been intro-
duced to the pastures, and good
returns have been recorded as a
result of this variation of policy.
The old homestead, built over sixty
years ago, and which still serves as
the family abode, is a typical pioneer
home—a low-roofed, rambling, but
withal picturesque building, con-
structed of rough slabs which stand
as an object lesson of the risk run
in their ventures by the early set-
tlers of Queensland. Bored through
these slabs are port-holes, where a
rifle or blunderbuss could be in-
serted from within, forming a means
of defence from the attacks of the
savage and hostile aboriginals by
which the district was infested, at-
testing in emphatic manner the way
in which the brave men of the past
took their lives in their hands when
they penetrated the wild bush
region to blaze tracks for those who
should come after them. The late
Mr. Underwood was well known in
this district, of which he was a
resident from his early teens —prior
to taking over the “Warroo” lease,
holding managerial posts at “Gul-
anbah,” “Dareel/ and “Yambur-
gan” Stations, and, for a time,
owning “Brynog,” in the Surat
district. During these years he ex-
hibited all the traits of an upright
and sterling character, and took his
part in the administration of law
and order, at the time of his decease

every way open to him, he did his

community to which he belonged.
He was also looked upon uniformly
as a “good sportsman” in the days
when this designation implied the


possession of all tlie most gentle-
manly qualities. The racing trophies

Mr. Underwood died in 1910, leav-
ing behind him a worthy reputation
as a reliable and enterprising
settler, who earned the respect and
affection of all with whom he came
into contact, and whose death made
a long-felt blank in the district
where he had resided during the
greater part of his life. Mr. Under-
wood’s widow—a daughter of one
of the pioneers who came from
England many years ago, to make
their home in the land of the
Southern Cross, and settled in New
South Wales, still resides at “War-
roo,” where the generous hospitality
for which the old homestead was
noted in the days when the country
was still in the making, still is
practised, the “stranger within the

late John Gilmour who, a native of
Alloa, Scotland, came to Australia
in 1836, and settled near Adelaide,
where he engaged in agrarian pur-
suits. He became very successful as
a wheat-grower, and was the earliest
exhibitor of South Australian wheat

held in London in 1851. The late

in 1890 leaving behind him a worthy
name as one who had achieved suc-
cess and assisted in pioneering work
of a highly important character. He
left a family of four sons and four
daughters, all of whom have settled
on the land, engaging either in
agricultural or pastoral operations,
in various parts of Australia. Mr.
Alexander Gilmour, received his
education at Whinham College,
North Adelaide, and having com-
pleted his scholastic course he
rejoined his father in the old
home, and, under the careful super-
vision of the older man, became an
expert in agricultural matters. His
inclination, however, tended to-
wards the sheep and wool industry,
and, from an early age, he made a
scientific and practical study of
sheep. In pursuance of this aim he
was fortunate as a youth in gaining
the good opinion of the late John
Murray, founder and father of sheep-
raising enterprise in South Aus-
tralia. During the years of his
early manhood, Mr. Gilmour re-
ceived from Mr. Murray a most
valuable training in the many de-
tails pertaining to the successful
conduct of a sheep station; and,
even as a boy, so keen was he that
he thought nothing of riding fifty or
sixty miles to a show, where he
thought there might be something
for him to learn about sheep and
wool, and where the words of wis-
dom pronounced by the judges, might
be stored up for future use. Whilst
still in his teens, he assumed charge
of his father’s comparatively small
flock, and, during his period of
management, was successful in win-
ning over 400 prizes, sending his
exhibits to all parts of the State,
as well as to the Royal Show at
Adelaide. In 1880, the late John
Gilmour took up a pastoral lease at
Mount Burrel, in Central Aus-
tralia, but a protracted drought
supervening, the run was abandoned.
It is claimed by the Gilmour brothers
that they grew the first wool ever
produced in Central Australia, this
having to be carted 1,000 miles to
the Adelaide markets, a trip which
usually occupied twelve months.
Mr. Alexander Gilmour remained
in the parental home until after

the charge of the merino and

Gilmour served as adjudicator to
most of the Agricultural and Horti-
cultural Associations in South Aus-

capacity for periods of from six to
twelve years consecutively. Subse-
quently he fulfilled similar duties in
New South Wales and in Queens-
land, and his record includes the
attendance as an official at not less
than 150 shows. He was one of the
first to strongly advocate the appoint-
ment of a sole judge of sheep at
such functions and, during his 40
years’ experience, he has on many
occasions undertaken the duty
single-handed, frequently receiving

Station, near Surat, a property
owned by Messrs. Elder, Smith, and
Co., Ltd., of South Australia. Here
he spent nearly a decade, even-
tually resigning once more to be-
come master of his own fortunes
by the acquisition of a pastoral
holding, of which he took personal
control. The property upon which
Mr. Gilmour now resides, known as
“Tarilla,” in the neighbourhood of
Surat, fell to his lot by ballot,
originally having been a part of the
resumed portion of the “North
Burgorah” run, which was offered
by the Government for closer settle-
ment purposes, in 1908. Mr. Gil-
mour began his operations upon this
country in 1909, and has since given
right from the commencement, giv-
ing due attention to fencing, ring-
barking, and well-sinking, the con-
struction of large tanks for the con-
servation of water also being taken
in hand. As a result of this im-
provement work, the property has
considerably improved in carrying
capacity and, at the time of writing,
given an average season, is easily
capable of sustaining a flock of
20,000 sheep. The erection of a
homestead was an important step
forward, the present comfortable
dwelling-house being built in 1910.
Mr. Gilmour estimates that, since
taking up the holding, about £B,OOO
has been expended in improvement
work, and it is his boast that

His great experience, good judg-
ment, and keen interest in pas-
toral' enterprise, placed him in
the position to command the
best posts obtainable among the
pastoral people of his day; but Mr.
Gilmour’s mind was set on an in-
dependent career, and taking up
country in the Central State, he
initiated his venture, which he con-
ducted on highly successful lines.

count for some years, and attaining

The earliest “Tarilla” block, com-
prising 14,000 acres, has since been
added to by the purchase of two
other properties, which has brought
the area up to 26,000 acres. The
country varies in character from
flat to undulating, the stretches of
pasture land lying back from the
Balonne River—which gives a water
frontage of three miles to the estate
—being regarded as especially valu-
able. The indigenous timber in-
cludes belar, box, coolibah, and

grasses are found all over the run.

progressive policy of development

abovementioned sum having been
made, before it was spent, on the
property. He is a strong advocate
for the South Australian type of
merino sheep for Queensland coun-
try, and his reputation as one of
the best-known judges of sheep in
the Commonwealth, necessarily gives
his opinion on this point great
weight. He takes a keen interest
in affairs pertaining to the general
weal, and for some years occupied
a seat on the Warroo Shire Council,
serving as chairman of that body for
some considerable time. He is also
a member of the St. George District

been associated for many years. He

to which he was appointed by the
Denham Administration some years
ago. A good sportsman, Mr.

occupied his present office of
vice-president of the Surat Jockey
Club, of which he is a staunch sup-
porter, his membership having ex-
tended over seventeen years, during
several of which he served as hon-
orary judge, besides which he is a
member of the St. George and other

1880, Elizabeth, daughter of the
late Charles Martin, an Englishman
by birth, and an old South Aus-
tralian pioneer, who became a well-
known figure in commercial circles
at Mount Pleasant, South Aus-
tralia, and of the marriage there is

which he now resides, on the first
block of land taken up by his late
father, Mr. William Marsh, to
which the name of "Perwell” was
given, after the home in England
of Mr. Marsh’s maternal grand-
mother. This lady, Mrs. Martha
Alcock, with her husband, the late
John Alcock, arrived in Australia in
1852, and after remaining for about
a year in the Mother State, the
couple became pioneer settlers in the
Ada Driver, Brisbane.
MR. JOHN WILLIAM MARSH.
Maclntyre district of south-west
Queensland. Mr. Marsh’s grand-
parents on the paternal side of the
family also came from England,
arriving in Australia in the forties,
and the Queensland branch of the
connection was founded in 1864,
when the late William Marsh and
his brother, Mr. Thomas Marsh,
made their advent to this portion of
the great island-continent, and
established a partnership for the
carrying on of pastoral enterprise on
an extensive scale. Mr. William
Marsh, being a family man, had a
bigger stake at the moment in the
success of the venture than his
brother, who remained for many
years a bachelor, and being the
elder of the two by several years,
he naturally took the initiative in
those matters which made for the
establishment of the enterprise on
a permanent basis. As a result of
their inspection of available lands
the brothers in 1866 took up the
"Hillsborough” lease, near Mitchell,
in the Maranoa district, which pro-
perty in the early days of settle-
ment, comprised about 200 square
miles. "Hillsborough,” prior to
the arrival of the Marsh brothers
had been in the hands of the London
Chartered Bank, from which finan-
cial institution it was purchased by
the new arrivals, who thus showed
their grit and fearlessness, the
“Never-Never Country,” upon the
confines of which the property was
situated, being full of perils, and
its working fraught with much diffi-
culty and hardship. Brisbane at
that time was but a small settlement
with one hostelry, a police office, and
a small Government office, and all
supplies for the station had to be
procured from Ipswich, which at that
time carried on a somewhat irregular
shipping trade with Sydney. From
Ipswich, therefore, the station-
holders were able to procure
the necessities of life and supplies
for the working of their properties,
and the transport of these to “Hills-
borough,” which was regarded as
among the farthest “out-back”
places, in bad weather took as long
as five months, a bullock waggon
being used to cover the distance. As
a result it was the usual thing to
have four wagons on the road
at one time, two coming from
the port with supplies and two
taking wool, sheepskins, and other
products of the stations into
town for marketing, or for ship-
ment to other ports. A glance
MR. THOMAS MARSH.
at the old station books, still intact
at the homestead, shows that the
"Hillsborough” property carried
some 7,000 sheep, which at that
period were always under the care


of shepherds, dingos being numer-
ous and rapacious, and the natives
(although no serious depredations
were placed to their account) wild
and requiring a watch always to be
kept at night. In 1878 the sheep
were all sold off, cattle proving the
more profitable class of stock for the
district. Even as late as this date no
fences had been erected, and the
cattle had to be yarded at night,
and handled in much the same
manner as the sheep. Eventually a
boundary fence marked the con-
fines of “Hillsborough” to define
the pastures of the occupants when
other settlers came along, and in
course of time the Government re-
sumed portions of the large area
known under that name, the adjoin-
ing stations, “The Overflow” and
“Glencoe,” having been formed out
of the old lease. The late William
Marsh, whose death occurred in
1903, was well beloved bv those
who, now in the autumn of their
days, remember the kindly, honest,
Australian of an earlier period,
who toiled and endured much in
his efforts to found a home
for those who should come
after him, and to help build
up the British Empire over-
seas. Of his union with Mary
Alcock a family of three sons
and three daughters survive,
of whom the sons all follow
in the footsteps of their
father in the pastoral indus-
try, while two daughters are
married respectively to Mr.
A. Cameron, of “Woodlands”
Station, and Mr. Frank Doug-
las, of “Eversfield” Station,
Mitchell district, and the
third is the widow of
the late Henry Corbett, well
known in commercial circles
in the Maranoa district and
at Toowoomba, in which lat-
ter place Mrs. Corbett now
resides. The subject of this
notice, Mr. John William
Marsh, received his education
from a tutor on the home
property, and in the intervals
allowed by his studies obtained
an excellent knowledge of stock and
station pursuits. Eventually he be-
came a valuable assistant to his
father and uncle in the administra-
tion of affairs, and continued to
its construction being the durable
native pine. The posts, which are
enormous in size, were squared with
the adze, and the partitions are
filled with trimmed logs laid length-
wise one on another, and even now,
after some 60 odd years, retain their
pristine soundness. The bark, which
was left intact on these logs, is still
in an excellent state of preservation,
and adds considerably to the artistic-
ally rustic appearance of the walls.
Cedar doors and fittings put the
finishing touch to a unique and
attractive interior, and the whole
structure presents an aspect of mas-
sive strength, as though in its build-
ing it were intended to stand against
the assaults of the elements for ever.
Mr. Marsh, who recognizes his duty
as a member of the community, has
served for a number of years as
Justice of the Peace, to which com-
mission he was appointed during the
latter years of the reign of King
Edward VII. He married in 1896

work in association with them until
the demise of the former gentleman,
when the estate was divided, the old
homestead with its surrounding acres
falling to his share. Mr. Thomas
Marsh, his uncle, started on his own
account on that portion of the estate
which adjoins “Hillsborough,” and
known as “Surprise,” where he
still resides. This gentleman married
in 1896 Jane, daughter of the late
James Anderson, of “Kinnoul,” via
Taroom, and widow of the late
Charles Woodland, of Dalby,
Queensland. The “Hillsborough”
Estate, which comprises 30,000
acres, is situated on the Maranoa
River, and is approached by the St.
George—Mitchell road, lying 55
miles from the former town and 80
miles from Mitchell. Mr. J. W.

by his father, only recently again

ROBERT COPLAND LETH-
BRIDGE, J.P., “Forest Yale,”
Mitchell. Around the ancient name
of Lethbridge, in its earlier forms of
Lodbroc Lathbroke Lethbroke,
after the manner of those remote
times, clustered traditions which
serve to indicate what manner of
men they were who founded the line
in the early dawn of English history.
Turning over the pages of authors
who have made it a labour of love
to trace such traditions, and to per-
petuate them on the printed page,
we read from Vestigan (“Restitut
of Decayed Intellege in Antiquit,”
GOVERNOR KING.
p. 175): —“The King of Denmark
raised an army, and sent it over into
England, under two famous cap-
tains, Hunga and Hubba, the two
sons of Lethbroke, whom the rather
to encourage to revenge, their sisters
wrought with their needles on an
ensign the proportions of a raven
or, rather, an eagle, which they did
bear as no small sign of their good
luck.” And again—‘‘He Lothbroo
(Lethbroke Lethbridge), leaving
behind him a numerous issue, three
of the younger sons, Ivor, Hunga,
and Hubba, came into England with
purpose to revenge the ghost of their
murdered father, but rather to pro-
vide for their own livelihood, being
banished according to the custom of
their country, which always forces
the younger children to prey for
themselves abroad —wherein, being
like young rooks drove from their
nests, they took that bird for their
cognizance, which, being embroid-
ered by their vestal sisters in a ban-
ner, consecrated after the horrible
rites of their paganish superstition,
they sate it up as the Royal Stan-
dard, calling it by the name of the
Reafen, i.e., Raven” (author of
“Worthies of Devon”). In 1838, an
English writer, James Lethbridge
Templar, was responsible for the
following;
Ere England first felt the Danes’ broad-
sword and flame,
A suppliant and exile, King Lodbroc
he came:
For achievement no less than for poetry
famed,
And from his buckskin inexpressibles
named—
(For in those heathen days a good stout
pair of breeches
Were a mark of almost inexhaustible
riches).
Returning to Denmark, he coveted still
The fair cornfields of England, her vale
and her hill.
Ere long, the Black Eagle exultingly
soared
O’er town, hill, and valley, all won by
the sword;
Nor waned the Danes’ power till on

But still, in the far west, a remnant

The late Robert Copland Leth-
bridge, father of the owner of
“Forest Vale,” was born near Laun-
ceston, Devonshire, England, and
inherited the spirit of adventure and
enterprise for which his ancestors
were noted. The new overseas
colonies of Great Britain in Aus-
tralia, attracted the attention of the
young scion of a hardy race, and
shortly after his marriage in 1825,
he severed the ties that bound him to
the land of his birth, for the
purpose of seeking his fortune in
the great island-continent of the
Southern Seas. Upon coming to
Australia, he launched out in pas-
toral enterprise at “Werrington,”
a property near South Creek, in
the vicinity of Penrith, Parramatta
district, which was a land grant
made on January 1, 1806, by Gov-
ernor King to his daughter Mary
R
(Mrs. R. Copland Lethbridge)
under instructions from King
George. Subsequently “Leigh-
wood,” in the rich sheepfarming
and wheatgrowing district sur-
rounding Goulburn ' was acquired.
Severe reverses, resultant upon the
depressed financial conditions of the
time were suffered by Mr. Leth-
bridge, who, however, maintained
an undaunted front through all,
and, by dint of the diligent practice
of his profession in Penrith, suc-
ceeded in weathering the storm. He
died at the last-mentioned town in
1865, at the age of 65, leaving a
family of five sons and two daugh-
ters. Equal in power and position
with the pagan conqueror of “the
fair cornfields of England, her vale
and her hill,” in more modern times
the maternal grandfather of Mr.
Robert Copland Lethbridge, Captain
Philip Gidley King, whose qualities
of statesmanship were of a very high
order, for a term controlled the
destinies of New South Wales, in
the capacity of Governor. As Lieu-
tenant King, a young officer with
considerable experience in the ser-
vice of the British Navy, he came on
board the “Sirius” with the first
fleet to Australia in May, 1787.
During the voyage his fine charac-
teristics became apparent to Gover-
nor Phillip, and, before its close, a
lasting friendship had sprung up be-
tween the two, which resulted in the
selection of King for more respon-
sible and arduous duties, A few
days after disembarkation at Sydney
Cove he was despatched by Governor
Phillip to take possession, on behalf
of the Crown, of Norfolk Island,
where his exceptional talent and
capacity for organization were given
full scope. He safely steered his
barque through the storms of ship-
wreck, scarcity of food supply, and
the tempers and dissatisfactions of
turbulent prisoners, soured by the
decisions of the law which had
enforced their departure from their
country “for their country’s good.”
When he visited England in 1790,
his achievements were officially ap-
proved, and, in the following year,
he was sent back with the rank of
Post-Captain to assume the office of
Lieutenant-Governor Oi the Island.
The little colony proved a difficult
proposition: the military guard mu-
tinied, and Captain King had to
resort to the expedient of arming
the convict settlers to suppress the
rising, which action subsequently
received the approval of the Home
authorities. Great offence, however,
was evinced in some quarters, par-
ticularly among the Imperial troops
of New South Wales (themselves
more celebrated for their mutinies
than for their service), who never
forgave the degradation of the Nor-
folk Island soldiery. Captain King
succeeded Governor Hunter in New
South Wales, where he made stupen-
dous efforts to cope with the peculiar
difficulties of administration of a
colony of convicts of the most de-
praved and hardened character, a
task fraught with disappointment
and almost unavoidable failure. Dis-
gusted with the brutality of the con-
victs and the low standards set b 7

by the British Admiralty to com-

north-west coasts of Australia, a
task which took him four years to
complete, and upon his return to
England, he presented to the Gov-
ernment such a comprehensive report
that there was little but detail work
left to do for those who followed
him. At a later date he also sur-
veyed the South Australian coast
on behalf of the Admiralty; and in
1830 he retired, settling in Sydney,
where he died in 1856, being sur-
vived by seven sons and one daugh-
ter. Of Governor King’s three
daughters, one became Mrs. Runci-
man, another Mrs. Hannibal Mc-
Arthur, and the youngest, who was
born at Government House, Syd-

naval officers, administrators, and
others to whom the honour of their
fellow-citizens is due for the active
share they have taken in the exten-
sion of the British Empire under the
Southern Cross. The subject of
this notice was the fourth son of his
parents, and was born at “Werring-
ton,’’ New South Wales, on Sep-
tember 11, 1838. He received his
education at The King’s School,
Parramatta, under the head-
mastership of the late Rev. Robert
Forrest—a name very prominently
connected with early educational
records in Australia. Leaving this
institution at fifteen years of age,
Mr. Lethbridge undertook the duties
of jackaroo on a station in Gipps-
land, Victoria, owned by the firm of
John King & Co., and known as
“The Ridge.’’ Here he remained
for five years, towards the close of
this time being promoted to the
management. For two or three
years following his resignation of
this appointment, he rented and
worked on his own account a prop-
erty called “Scarne,” in Gippsland,
which he relinquished in 1870. He
next spent about a year in the em-
ploy of the owners of “Sydney Cot-
tage’’ Station, when he gained some
droving experience, taking three long
trips in charge of stock, in the course
of which he travelled many hundreds
of miles. He was commissioned to
proceed to Queensland to inspect

of his brother-in-law, the late

of Messrs. King and Lethbridge,
and in 1872 Mr. Lethbridge
brought his wife and family to
take up their residence there.


Three years later Mr. King dis-
posed of his interest, and two
brothers, the Messrs. Elliot, who had
been admitted to the firm, were
bought out by Mr. Lethbridge at a
considerably later period, since when
he has continued sole proprietor.
When first taken up, the “Forest
Vale” run covered about 525 square
miles, but, as a result of the policy
of resumption adopted by the Gov-
ernment, on two occasions large
areas were cut away and subdivided
for closer settlement, making drastic
reductions in the mileage of the
original holding. The broad stretches
of undulating country, well watered
by the Maranoa River and various
creeks, and luxuriantly grassed, form
ideal cattle pastures, and departing
from the example of his predecessor,
who had developed the place as a
sheep station, Mr. Lethbridge from
the first devoted his attention to the
building up of a herd, and at one
time had upwards of 15,000 head of
cattle on the run. The ravages of
the 1902 drought, however, very
seriously impoverished the “Forest

an illuminated address and a gold

and has assisted prominently in
the founding of the various

the advancement of the place. He
was for a lengthy period a member
of the Leichhardt Rabbit Board,
and served as chairman of that body,

of a piece of plate and an address,

his profession at Narrandera, New
South Wales, at the outbreak of the
present European War. Dr. Leth-
bridge offered his services to the
military authorities and, as a unit
of the Army Medical Corps, with
the rank of major, has been serving
in France. He married Miss Gwen-
dolin Hall, a member of an old New
South Wales family. Mr. Leth-
bridge’s eldest son, Mr. J. C. K.
Lethbridge, resides at “Warren
Point,” Mitchell. The second son,
Robert Luxmoore, of “Werring-
ton” Station, North Queensland,
married Beatrice, daughter of the
late John Fulford, of “Lyndhurst”
Station, North Queensland, and has
three sons and two daughters. The
third, Arthur Forrest, of “Tiver-
ton,” Clifton, married Miss Mar-
garet Bromhall, of Queensland, and
has three sons and two daughters.
The fourth, George Frederick, re-
sides at “Forest Vale” homestead,
and, since the retirement of his
father, has assumed the management
of the property. He married Louisa,
daughter of the late E. F. Morgan,
of Mount Morgan fame, and lias a
son and a daughter. The sixth son,
Robert Copland, married Miss Ger-
trude Cosgrove, and has one daugh-
ter. Of the daughters, one married
the late Mr. J. R. Nimmo, of “Oak
Park,” North Queensland, and has
four sons and two daughters. Two
of the Nimmo brothers are attached
to the Australian Imperial Forces,
and are at present (1918) stationed
in Egypt. Mr. F. W. Manning, well
known in Queensland and the Ar-

Murphy, a well-known pastoral
manager in Queensland, who died in
1914, leaving issue two sons and one
daughter.
JOHN COPLAND KING LETH-
BRIDGE, J.P., “Warren Point,”
Mitchell, was born on July 18, 18C7,
at “Scarne,” a property in Victoria,
which at the time was leased by his
father, Mr. Robert Copland Leth-
bridge, now of “Forest Vale,”
Queensland. In 1872 the family
removed to Queensland, and the
gentleman under review attended
the Toowoomba Grammar School
prior to completing his education at
a private academy at Allora, near
AVarwick, conducted by the Rev. H.
J. Campbell. After two years at this
institution he received the appoint-
ment of junior clerk in the Mitchell
branch of the Queensland Bank,
where he remained for four years.
At the close of this period he was
transferred to the Adavale branch
of the same bank, subsequently fill-
ing the post of accountant at Charle-
ville, whence he was transferred suc-
cessively to Gympie and Mackay.
AVhilst at Mackay Mr. Lethbridge
decided to engage in pastoral pur-
suits, for which he had always had a
penchant, and accordingly resigned
from the bank’s service. In 1890 he
took a position as jackaroo on “Oak
Park” Station, the property of his
brother-in-law, the late J. R.
Nimmo, for the purpose of gaining
experience in the handling of stock
and other branches of work. After
remaining for some considerable time
at “Oak Park,” he accompanied an
experienced drover, who was in
charge of a mob of cattle from
“Wando Vale” Station for delivery
at “Cullingrel,” in New South
Wales, a trip which occupied over
twenty-seven weeks of time. Having
familiarized himself with most of
the phases of droving and other
branches of pastoral enterprise, in


1892 he launched out on his own
account as a drover, his start in this
direction being given him by the
firm of Elliot, Lethbridge, & Elliot,
of "Forest Vale,” for whom he took

a large mob of cows to “Gunnedah,”
New South Wales. Continuing this
life for six years, he included in his
experiences two long overland trips
with big mobs of cattle to Victoria.
In 1898, however, he was offered the
dual post of manager of “Tyrconnel
Downs” and “Ularunda” Stations,
near Morven, by the Bank of New
responsibilities, on behalf of the same
institution. Three years later Mr.
Lethbridge purchased from Mr. P.
Shannon a block of land known as
“Warren Point,” on the Maranoa
River, near Mitchell, and being
joined in partnership by his brother .
Arthur forthwith set to work upon
the development of this holding. In
1903 the firm enlarged its boundaries
by purchase of “River View” and
“Dunmore Park,” on the opposite
side of the river, and in course of
time, as circumstances pei’mitted,
dissolved, Mr. J. C. K. Lethbridge
becoming sole proprietor. Shortly
afterwards he further extended the
scope of his operations by the
acquirement from Mr. Aaron Hos-
kins, of “Taurida” Station, a free-
hold property with an area of 5,000
acres, adjoining “Warren Point,”
bringing the aggregate acreage held
by Mr. Lethbridge in the vicinity of
Mitchell up to about 12,000, the
greater part of which is freehold.
In addition to this, he owns other
landed interests in the Ulandilla
district. Sheep form the mainstay
of the “Warren Point” proposition,
but a large number of cattle are
grazed on the property, and Mr.
Lethbridge also gives considerable
attention to agriculture, at one time
having as many as 700 acres under
wheat. Great credit is accorded Mr.
Lethbridge for so successfully
demonstrating the qualities of the
soil for the production of cereals.
Even greater success has attended
the cultivation of citrus and other
fruits, the orchard at “Warren
Point” being one of the finest to be
found in the length and breadth of
Queensland. The excellent results

Subsequently the administration of
“Nive Junction,” on the Warrego,
and “Woodlands,” on the Western

other properties were added to
these earlier blocks, which were
worked conjointly by the brothers

mutual consent, the partnership was

no small measure to the expert know-
ledge and industry of Mr. H. Henry,
who keeps well abreast of the latest
scientific methods as applied to


horticulture. “Warren Point,” where
Mr. Lethbridge resides, is situated
on the bank of the Maranoa River,

of the district have successfully
appealed to Mr. Lethbridge, and he
has willingly shouldered his share of
member of the Booringa Shire
Council. He succeeded his father to
a seat on the Leichhardt District
Rabbit Board, and at the time of
writing (1917) occupies the presi-
dential chair of the Maranoa Pas-
toral, Agricultural, and Industrial
Association. He has done much

half a century ago, and his passing
was regretted by a large circle of
acquaintances. The McLean family
is descended from amongst the fore-
most of the ancient Scottish clans,
and has its headquarters at Castle

qualities of courage and resolution,
conspicuous traits in the character
of the early pioneers of the State,
Mr. Scott bravely ventured beyond
the sparsely settled fringe of habi-
tation in Western Queensland, and
with commendable foresight selected
the country now known as “Hornet
Bank” Station, which led to his
becoming the farthest outback settler
on the promising pasture lands
watered by the River Dawson.
Before a very long period had
elapsed the station was destined to

station in various capacities for some
time prior to thus launching out on
his own account. Subsequently Mr.
Gordon was joined by a Mr. Fraser,
who brought his wife and family of
nine children to reside on the station,
and devoted his energies to turning
to the best practical account the
wide areas which had thus come
under his control. The region,
however, was infested with trouble-
some natives, and poor Fraser and
his family were ultimately called

“HORNET BANK” Station, the
property of Messrs. Andrew Robert

Scott, J.P., and Robert Logan Scott,
J.P., is situated on the Dawson
River, some 30 miles from the town-
ship of Taroom. The property was
established as a pastoral run as far
back as the early fifties, by the late
Andrew Scott, and, at the time of
its foundation was distinguished as
being the pioneer enterprise of
the locality. Endowed with those

his hands full with other develop-

the Rockhampton district, consented
to let the river property, then
known as “Goongarry” Station, the
aboriginal nomenclature thus dis-
tinguishing this particular part of
the country, on a temporary lease
to Mr. Gordon, who had been
upon to pay the extreme penalty as
the price of empire-building on' the
“edge of the beyond” in the days
when the Australian nation was vet

end, he proceeded to avenge the
untimely death of his early friend
by joining the bitterly-outraged
white population which, though
small and scattered, was roused
to fury by the massacre, and
history records that during the
ensuing weeks hundreds of natives
were killed by these self-appointed
upholders of the law, who, finding
that the Government of the day was
unable to cope with the situation,
took matters into their own hands,
and meted out a terrible punish-
ment to the aboriginal tribes.
Subsequently Mr. Scott changed the
name of the property to “Hornet
Bank,” and personally entered upon
its development. He carried on this
work along careful lines for some
considerable time, and his efforts

disposed of to purchase “Victoria

conceived the desire to purchase
“Vindex” Station, near Winton,
Western Queensland. In connection
with his latest venture he took into
partnership the late Andrew Gordon,

Scottish forbears in their under-
takings, pushed still further west,
and added to his pio-
neering laurels by the
establishment of “Max-

Richmond, which he
developed successfully
with the sturdy “Hor-

he afterwards sold at
a profit, and desiring
to settle a little nearer
to civilized centres, nego-
tiated the purchase of

Mr. John Turner, the
situation of which,
immediately south of

admirably suited to his
purpose. Having secured
the place, and found it
well adapted to the
requirements of a fat-

he placed it under the
management of his
eldest son, Andrew

very good results. The original

and perfect pastoral property, using
for this purpose the pick of
the territory which had thus
been brought within the scope of
his control. Having
achieved his aim, Mr.
Scott disposed of that
portion of the land
which he considered of
minor value, and with
the co-operation of his
sons settled down to a
more scientific develop-
ment of the station
which years before had
marked the beginning
of his career as a pas-
toral , pioneer. He died
at the ripe old age
of 84, following after
three years the wife
who had shared with
him the strenuous
days and early hard-
ships of pioneering life,

and practical support
did her full share in
bringing about the success that

will long be remembered, not only
by those of their own blood, who
owe them a special debt of gratitude
for the heritage of goodwill whicli
the old name carried with it, but
and as time advanced the late Mr.
Scott perceived with increasing
clearness the geographical advan-
tages which would be secured by the
acquirement of the adjacent holding
known as “Eurombah” Station, by
which he was hemmed in on three
sides, and which possessed superior
watercourses to those upon which
“Hornet Bank” depended for its
supply. Accordingly he seized his
opportunity to make himself owner
of the whole area, thereafter apply-

also by those who were associated
with them in kindred pursuits, who
enjoyed their hospitality, and who
have handed down to their children
traditions of the early days, in
which the name of Andrew Scott
and his helpmeet occupy an impor-
tant place. “Hornet Bank” Station,
as has been indicated, in common
with most properties of a similar
nature, has witnesed various
changes of acreage since first it was
taken up as virgin country, with all
the bright possibilities of develop-
ment gently hinted in waving, grassy
pastures and freely-flowing streams.
When completed by the addition of
that part of “Eurombah” retained
by the late Mr. Scott, and in
conjunction with the outstation
“Baroondah,” the area covered about
700 square miles, but owing to
resumptions by the Government from
time to time this has been consider-
ably reduced. It is justly regarded
as one of the most highly developed
and improved pastoral properties of
Queensland, and its status as an
exclusively cattle station is of the
very first importance. The herd,
which numbers upwards of 10,000,
has been bred from pure Durham
shorthorns, the experience of the
present owners fully justifying the
judgment displayed by their father
the founder of the station, in his
selection of this popular type as
eminently suitable to the conditions
obtaining in the Dawson district.
A considerable amount of money has
been expended in fencing, and even
when the property embraced the
acres since disposed of, the run was
enclosed on all sides by a substantial
three-wire fence. Since the reduc-
tion of area occurred this important
department of development work has
received yet greater attention, and a
large number of paddocks, ranging
in size down to 1,500 acres, have
been formed, which keep the stores
and fats in their appointed pastures,
well on the range, and yet con-
venient for mustering when required.
These paddocks are watered chiefly
by the River Dawson, which holds
pride of place among the streams of
this locality, where its flow has
never been known to cease. As it
meanders, ribbon-like, through the
grass country its silver thread may
be taken as indicative of the natural
advantages of the whole property,
which have been turned to best
account by the owners, who by the
construction of many dams have
practically solved the difficulty which
in times of drought is apt to confront
filled with ability various public
offices, being regarded as so valuable
a member of the community that
hardly any scheme affecting the
welfare of the residents was entered
upon without his cordial approval
and practical co-operation. Among
other matters he gave some attention
to military affairs, and held a cap-
tain’s commission in the Volunteer
Forces of Queensland. He married
Miss Clara Georgina Panton, a
daughter of one of the well-known
pioneers of the Moreton Bay district,
and has a surviving family of two
sons and one daughter. “Mount
Dawson,” the home of Mr. Wal-
lace O. Scott, is a charming estate of
about 200 acres, situated on an
elevation commanding a fine sweep
of the surrounding ranges. The
house is enclosed by flower gardens
and spacious lawns, while a profu-
sion of ornamental trees and shrubs,
and a fine orchard, add beauty to
the scene. Mr. Scott also owns
“Brookfield,” a grazing farm of
7,000 acres, lying about 14 miles
distant from “Hornet Bank,” it
being a portion of the area formerly
resumed by the Government. This
is now under the management of his
second son, the eldest, Andrew
Anderson, having joined the Queens-
land section of the Australian Im-
perial Forces sent to assist the
Motherland in the great struggle
against the Central Empires of
Europe. He went right through the
Gallipoli campaign, and in 1915 was
the Australian cattle and sheep
breeders who have neglected this
very important precaution. On a
billabong, or backwater, of the
Dawson the homestead is situated,
the site of which is about 70 miles
distant from Yuelba railway station,
on the western line, which lies almost
due south of “Hornet Bank.” The
original dwellinghouse dates back
over half a century, and served for
25 years, when it was superseded by
a new structure, which even to-day
is up-to-date in every respect, and
surpasses in comfort and convenience
many of the more modern station
homes which have sprung up in this
and other of the pastoral districts of
the State during the past few years,
At the present time the station is
under the management of Messrs,
Andrew Robert Scott and Robert
Logan Scott, the eldest and youngest
sons respectively of the late Andrew
Scott, while Mr. W. O. Scott, the
remaining partner, has retired from
active participation in the station
operations, and resides at Mount
Dawson Range, a few miles distant
from the City of Toowoomba. Mr.
Andrew Scott, who, at the period of
writing, concentrates his energies
chiefly on the affairs of the station,
in earlier life was well known on
the Darling Downs, when he was
engaged in the management of
“Grantham” Station on his father’s
behalf. During this time he mani-
fested considerable interest in the
advancement of the district, and


invalided home after a severe attack
of enteric. After regaining his
health he again enlisted, and was
killed in the year 1917 in France
whilst gallantly fighting cn the side
of the Allies in the cause of freedom
and right. He held the rank of
second-lieutenant at the time of his
death. Mr. Scott is owner of the
blood stallion “Orellius,” a splendid
animal bred in the stud of the late
King Edward VII., and imported to
Australia by Messrs. Moses & Sons,
local government, as a member of
the Taroom Shire Council. He is
also a member of all the principal
race clubs, his reputation as a
breeder, particularly of thorough-
breds, entitling him to consid-
erable respect in racing circles
throughout the State. He mar-
ried Annie, daughter of the late
James Anderson, of “Kinnoul”
Station, whose name, though not
included among the actual pioneers
of Queensland, will long be
the affairs of the enterprise. He
also is a married man, his wife being
Sarah Pointon, daughter of Mr.
John Becker, a well-known citizen
of Taroom, by whom he has three
daughters. In addition to the fore-
going, mention must be made of a
fourth brother, Mr. Thomas. Allison

dent lines, a grazing area of about

honourable man, whose record of good
work faithfully accomplished is one
of which his descendants may be
justly proud. Of the union there is

youngest son of the late Andrew
Scott, has been identified with
pastoral duties on the home station
during practically the whole of his
life, and devotes the greater part of
his time to the successful conduct of

other members of his family, has
made his influence felt in the neigh-
bourhood wherein he has passed his
life, and for three years represented
the constituency of Murilla in the
Legislative Assembly of Queensland.

father was a commercial man of note
in the early days of Taroom, and has

as one of those distinctly English
he had been brought up, had the
adventurous strain in his nature
excited by the golden lure at the
time of the big rush to the Bendigo
diggings in Victoria, and left hie
native land to try his fortunes
on the goldfields. Varied success
attended his efforts, but he experi-
enced sufficient encouragement to
warrant his sending to England for
his family only three or four years
after his advent. His wife, accom-
oanied by two sons, viz., Messrs.
•John and Daniel Penhallurick, then
mere lads, responded to the summons
to betdn life with her husband in a
new country, but the subject of this
notice, owing to the unsatisfactory
state of his health, was left in
England, and it was three years
later when he at length sailed for
Australian shores. Fortunately the
change of cbmate worked excellent
results. and he rapidly gained
strength, ultimately becoming one of
the most robust of men, well fitted
to the strenuous pioneer work to
which he turned his attention, and
to the begetting and bringing up of
a large family to enter into the
fruits of his labours, and hand down
to a succeeding generation the good
old Cornish name. Mr. William

Owing, however, to the stress and
strain of financial pressure at that
property, it may be mentioned, is
still in the possession of the family,
Mr. Penhallurick’s eldest brother
being in occupation. When 17 years


of age, the gentleman under review,
who was his father’s youngest son,
joined forces with Mr. Daniel Pen-
hallurick in obeying the impulse to
start on independent lines, and with
their parents’ consent, left the
paternal rooftree, where they felt
the lines of development to be some-
what too conservative and unpro-
gressive, and turned their faces
northwards with the object of carv-
ing out for themselves a wider and
less tramelled career on the land.
After making due observations they
took up selections at Durham Ox,
Victoria, on their own behalf and
that of their father and brother,
comprising in all a farm of 1,280
acres, and bringing to bear on this
new proposition all the energy
and enterprise of their enthusiastic
youth, soon proved their ability, in
spite of comparative inexperience,
to forge ahead and make good in

Success crowned every strenuous
effort, and blessed by good seasons,
they were soon on the high road
to prosperity. Having thoroughly
established the venture, the result
of a conference between the partners
was an agreement that the two

its claim in their calculations. Land
which afterwards attended their
operations as pastoralists. Having
put their hand to the plough, they
never looked back, but even through
temporary throwbacks held fast to
the ideal which had first tempted
them to break the ties which linked
them to their childhood’s home, and
branch out on more extended fields
of enterprise. After about four
years the brothers disposed of this
property, and returned to the
Durham Ox home for a time, before
deciding on a yet more important
tilt at fortune in more distant
latitudes. In 1883 a departure was
made for Queensland; on this occa-
sion the eldest and youngest brothers
forming the party to set out in
quest of territory, whilst Mr. Daniel
Penhallurick remained in charge of
the Victorian interests, later taking
Durham Ox as his own portion.
Having made careful inspection,
their choice fell upon “Tooloombilla”
Station, near Mitchell, founded
about a decade previously by the
late Dr. Fullerton, and consisting of
some 200 square miles. The stock
on the station amounted to 9,000
sheep, and with these the run was
sold as a going concern for ,£9,000.

in the Riverina district, where they
took up 6,000 acres on the Edward
River, and here the brothers laid the
solid foundation of that success
Since that early period many
changes have taken place, and fre-
quent additions of adjoining areas
have enlarged the boundary lines
considerably, so that at the present


time the property as owned by Mr.
Daniel Penhallurick comprises about
400 square miles. On account of the
havoc wrought among the sheep by
the depredations of dingoes, the first
move made by the new proprietors
of “Tooloombilla” was to begin the
development of the place for cattle,
and with this end in view the wool-
producing population of the pastures
was gradually disnosed of to make
way for a cattle-carrying proposi-
tion, in which class of stock success-
ful deals in a large way were made,
the cattle being fattened and sold
again in profitable markets. For
two years the station was carried on
by Messrs. John and William Pen-
hallurick, at the end of which period
they were again joined in partner-
ship by their brother, Daniel, who

assumed his share of the manage-
ment, leaving William free to take
over the sole control of the stock,
for which duty he had proved him-
self thoroughly efficient. The original
homestead, built over 40 years ago
by Dr. Fullerton, is still in use as
a dwelling-house, and appears in the
accompanying photograph in much
the same condition as when it came
into the hands of the Penhallurick
brothers three decades since. By
degrees additions to the property
were made, “Havelock,” “East-
lands,” and "Munnaweena” being
incorporated into the parent holding,
and in 1893 the firm acquired the
well-known pastoral station in the
Warrego district known as “Alice
Downs,” 250 square miles in area,
where Mr. William Penhallurick,
who was the initiator of almost
every forward move made by the
partners, forthwith took his family,
and settled down to the arduous
task of making the new venture in
every way a successful one. The old
spirit of grit and determination
which had animated his first endeav-
ours to handle his life’s opportu-
nities (in the making of which he
played an active part) to the greatest
advantage had not deserted him,
and though in his fortieth year, he
entered upon the work before him
with much of the old zest for over-
coming difficulties and turning every-
thing to the best account. The usual
anxieties attendant upon a fresh
enterprise were not lacking in con-
nection with the development of
“Alice Downs,” and at the com-
mencement each season was faced
with a good deal of doubt, which
by degrees gave place to confidence
and satisfaction, as the prosperity
of the station became apparent
in every department. His expert
knowledge with regard to stock
prevented the possibility of any
error of judgment in this respect at
the outset, and his thorough equip-
ment of practical experience in the
management of pastoral properties
commanded the respect and eulo-
gium of those best fitted to pro-
nounce an opinion on such matters,
and who watched the steady pro-
gress which accompanied the working
out of his methods, with admiration
and whole-hearted approval. In
1900 the three brothers by mutual
consent dissolved their connection,
the eldest taking the Victorian pro-
perties, together with a fixfed cash
amount, the second receiving as his
share “Tooloombilla” Station, and
Mr. William Penhallurick retaining
“Alice Downs,” which became en-
deared to him by long association
and the interest attendant upon
the successful working out of
an important scheme. He re-
mained in residence there in all for
14 years, during which period three
of his children were born. In 1905
he decided to come nearer the coast,
and “Alice Downs” accordingly
was put into the market and sold,
the last of the family whose home
it had been for so long leaving there
on Christmas Day of the above-
mentioned year. The new home was
at Toowoomba, where Mr. Penhal-
lurick turned his attention to acquir-
ing real estate, various valuable
properties coming into his possession.
For a time he lived contentedly
enough in retirement in the pretty
villa known as “Thirlmere,” over-
looking the park, and removed from
the immediate bustle of the thriving
town; but before long his natural
activity began to rebel against the
lack of interest in an idle life, and
he soon found himself engaged in
the purchase and subsequent disposal
of several properties in the Warrego
district, on which he was able to
make a satisfactory profit. “Wards-
dale” Station, near Charleville, he
held for some considerable time,
placing thereon those of his sons
who were old enough to begin their
apprenticeship to pastoral life, prior
to taking up more permanent resi-
dence at “Rodley,” in the Burke
district, which was purchased by
Mr. Penhallurick in 1914. This
northern station at the time of
purchase was without stock, and
practically unimproved, but the
young scions of pioneer parentage
have proved themselves true “chips
of the old block” in the manner in
which they have attacked the prob-
lem entrusted to them by their
father to solve. Setting to work
with a will, they have already
effected considerable improvement
on the run, which it is intended to
develop as a sheep station, and have
begun the breeding of merinos from
the famed “Wanganella” blood,
this type having been tested and
proved suitable to the district, while
its wool-producing qualities are too
well known to require comment.
Mr. Penhallurick in 1889 married

of the firm of George Logan & Sons,
Limited, was born in the Williams
district, New South Wales, on
August 15, 1840, and is the third
son of the late Thomas Logan, of
Parading Grounds, in that State.
The Logan family originally was
founded on Scottish soil, but eventu-
ally certain members crossed the
Irish Sea and settled in Ireland,
from which country the late Thomas
Logan emigrated in the early thir-
ties, accompanied by his wife and
vessel being one of the first free
emigrant ships to reach Port Phil-
lip, Victoria. On the same vessel
with the late Thomas Logan was a
family party numbering 17, amongst
whom was his father and step-
mother ; so the Logans can claim to
be amongst the oldest of Australian
clans. The late Thomas Logan’s
father, John Logan, with his family,
settled at Port Stephens, New South
Wales, while Mr. Thomas Logan’s
proceeded to the Williams district,
in the immediate neighbourhood,
and obtained employment as over-
seer of convict labour on three sta-
tions owned by a Mr. Nolan, one of
the earliest pioneer pastoralists of
the .Mother State. Viewing the
severity with which the convicts were
treated from a more humane and
Christian standpoint, in which
opinion he found himself at variance
with the owner of the station, and
on account of a dispute with the
latter on this question, he decided to
throw up his position, and started
for himself in a small way as a
farmer and grazier in the same
locality. He grew the first wheat in
that district, which he was obliged
to harvest in the most primitive
fashion, cutting it with the reaping
hook, threshing the crop with the
flail of past generations, and grind-
ing it by hand with the old-fashioned
stone. With his family he had to
suffer many privations in common
with most of the early settlers. His
two horses cost him £5O apiece, and
cattle were only to be obtained at
an enormously high price, all the
stock at that time having to be

hard-earned funds until he found
himself in a position to start out
on his own account. He was one of
the most hardworking and industri-
ous of men, and having a big heart
and sound body nothing was too dif-
ficult for him to tackle, from the
pick on the goldfield to the axe in
the forest, and wherever lie went he
was successful. Mr. Logan is an
excellent instance of one who has
learnt his lesson in the hardest of

His earliest home in the northern
State was "Brookfield,” a farm pro-
perty of some 2,000 acres, situated
a few miles from the capital, on the
northern side of the Brisbane River,
which he took up under the Land
Act of 1868, shortly after that
enactment came into force. A por-
tion of this property is still in Mr.
Logan’s possession. Here he re-
sided for about 15 years, until 1880,
when an area of the old "Colinton

tion, upon which occasion he secured
the block on which “Pine View”
homestead stands, and subsequently

becoming owner of the “Avoca” and

the Brisbane River, comprising
12.000 acres, together with all the
stock then grazed upon these pas-
toral lands. Eventually Mr. Logan
disposed of some of this land, but he
still retains 6,000 acres of freehold
surrounding the home, which he
built soon after coming into posses-
sion of the property, and "Pine

the largest consolidated freehold
areas on the Brisbane River water-
shed. After the completion of the
first developmental work necessary to
commence operations, he launched
out on a still larger scale in the pas-

with his sons, Messrs. Raymond,

ALFRED JOHN COTTON, J.P.,
“Hidden Vale,” Grandchester, was
born in the Channel Islands, his
native place being the town of St.
Heliers, Jersey, where he first saw
the light on June 21, 1861. He is
the only surviving son of the late
Charles Nelson Cotton, merchant of
London, who was descended from a
long line of mercantile progenitors,
carrying on business pursuits chiefly
in the world’s metropolis. Upon the
conclusion of his scholastic educa-
tion, which he received under private
tuition at Brighton, England, Mr.
A. J. Cotton was apprenticed to the
mercantile marine, serving his inden-
tures on a small barque of 700 tons
burden, owned by the old London
shipping firm of Messrs. John Brodie
and Sons, and known as the “Ede-
line.” Upon leaving this boat he
continued his training in two other
of the company’s vessels, viz., the
“Isles of the South” and “Clara,”
the latter being a name worthy to
be recorded in the history of Queens-
land as one of the sturdy craft which
safely bore across the wild waves
of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans
large numbers of emigrants from the
Mother Country bound for the
remote Australian colony. Mr.
Cotton concluded his indentures on
this vessel while at Hong Kong in
the year 1879, receiving promotion
to the rank of third mate, being
then in his nineteenth year. His
first experience in the way of exer-
cising official control was connected
with the handling of a band of 500
Chinese coolies on a trip to Antigua,
in the West Indies, which lasted 90
days. During the course of this
voyage he had every opportunity of
proving his capacity, and assisted in
successfully coping with several out-
breaks of a mutinous character,
which called for the display of
prompt decision and resolute action,
incidentally revealing his possession
of these qualities, which have been
to a great extent responsible for his
later prosperity in the land of his
adoption. In 1880 Mr. Cotton
accepted the post of third officer on
a larger vessel, the “Dartford,”
which until quite recently was used
by the Union S.S. Company as a
training ship for cadets, and a year
or two later, upon arrival with this
vessel at Sydney on his first trip to
the island continent of the southern
seas, he resigned his berth, and
retiring from seafaring pursuits
turned his attention to the acquisi-
tion of such experience as was
then considered necessary in the
equipment of a young Britisher with
his eye fixed on the ultimate goal of
successful pastoral enterprise. With
this purpose in view he sought and
obtained a position on the “Yaleroi”
S’heep and cattle Station, in New
South Wales, not far from the
Queensland border, and during the
three years that he spent on this
property seized every opportunity
that offered to acquaint himself with
all the best methods of handling
stock, in his leisure hours seeing
visions and dreaming dreams of a
bright future, in which wide land
areas and big mobs of fat cattle
played a prominent part. Having
attained proficiency he resigned his
post at “Yaleroi” to enter ujoon

overseer at the shearing-shed at “Tal-
oona” Station, where he continued
for some time. Eventually he
acquired a complete drover’s plant,
but not having sufficient ready cash
to defray the whole expenses of the
outfit he was compelled to seek out-
side financial assistance, the sound
reputation which he had already
established standing him in good
stead on this occasion. He con-
tinued droving for over six years
between New South Wales and
North Queensland, becoming among
the best known of the contractors
of the day in this line of occupation,
and winning the confidence of the
pastoralists by the care and skill
with which he managed the large
mobs of stock entrusted to his con-
trol. During this period he exer-
cised economy in many directions,
and at the close of the six years had
husbanded his resources sufficiently
to enable him to purchase an inte-
rest in “Goorganga” Station, near
Bowen, in the Herbert district of
Queensland, which at that time pro-
mised excellent things. For five
years matters on the station pro-
ceeded favourably, and the smile of
Fortune appeared to be definitely
cast in the direction of the young
pastoralist, but unhappily this satis-
factory condition of affairs failed to
continue with the advent of the tick
pest, which made serious inroads
amongst the stock, and finally
reduced the proposition to wreck and
ruin, practically the whole of the
cattle succumbing to the ravages of
the pest. Thus after nine years of
steady perseverance in the building
up of what he justifiably had hoped
would prove a permanent and liberal
source of income, and being now on
the shady side of 30, Mr. Cotton was
again compelled to start life at the
bottom rung of the ladder, with
nothing but a strong confidence in
his ability and knowledge of the
pastoral industry to inspire him with
courage for the future. His belief
in the possibilities of Queensland as
a first-class cattle country was
unbounded, and leaving a substitute
to look after the poor remnants of
stock on “Goorganga” and retrieve
what he might of the fallen fortunes
of the firm in that locality, he
turned his attention to the buying
and selling of stock, at first in a
small way, but speedily enlarging
his operations as prosperity attended
his initial efforts. In this venture
he was backed by the Bank of New
South Wales, the directors of which
institution readily met his request
for temporary assistance, not only by
reason of their confidence in his
integrity, but also in recognition of
the excellent business capacity and
thorough knowledge displayed by
him in previous dealings in stock.
Fortified by this practical and moral
support, Mr. Cotton was soon on the
crest of the wave, his deals increas-
ing in both magnitude and impor-
tance until it became a generally
recognized fact that his transactions
in stock were the most important in
the State. Upon the outbreak of the
South African War he successfully
handled contracts from the Imperial
Government for the supply of horses
aggregating 10,000 head, in the
selection and securing of which he
personally travelled all over Queens-
land and the northern portion of
New South Wales. Having once

acquired the ownership of many of
the well-known pastoral properties
for which Queensland has obtained
so deservedly high a reputation. His
choice always ran in the direction of
cattle stations, and following on his
first venture at “Goorganga,” came
successively “Powlathanga,” near
Charters Towers; “Coalbrook,” in
the vicinity of Hughenden; “Bau-
hinia Downs,” “Goomally,” and
“Redcliffe,” in the Springsure dis-
trict; “Lawn Hill” and “Pun-
jaub,” Burketown district; “Inker-
man” and “Woodstock,” Townsville
district; “Mount Spencer,” Mackay
district; “Maryvale,” Chari eville
district; and “Canobie,” in the
Cloncurry district. Mr. Cotton has
since disposed of all these properties,
and his present pastoral interests lie
chiefly in the Northern Territory,
where in conjunction with the Hon.
James White, of “Muswellbrook,”
New South Wales, and Mr. F. J.
White, of “Saumarez,” in the same
State, he owns the large cattle
station known as “Brunette Downs,”
covering 9,000 square miles of coun-
try. “Brunette Downs” mostly con-
sists of undulating open downs, well
covered with Mitchell and Flinders
grasses, interspersed with patches of
gidya, and is splendid cattle country.
The herd now numbers between
30,000 and 40,000, but it is esti-
mated that when the run is fully
improved it will easily carry 150,000
cattle. The bulls in use come from
various parts of the Commonwealth,
the famous “Warroo” blood largely
predominating. An inexhaustible
supply of good stock water is pro-
vided by eighteen sub-artesian bores,
from which water is raised by means
of windmills and oil and gas l engines.
Several earth tanks, with a capacity
of from 250,000 to 300,000 gallons,
have been excavated, and additional
bores are being put down at the rate
of six per annum. The original
homestead was replaced in 1915 by a
fibro-cement building, and first-class
accommodation has been provided for
the employes of the company, water
being laid on to their quarters and
bathrooms fitted. Extensive stock-
yards have been erected, and all the
most modern methods introduced.
Motor cars are employed in working
the property, and have proved a
valuable acquisition. A fair number
of horses are bred each year, prin-
cipally for station requirements,
about 1,000 animals being grazed
on the run. The nearest railway
siding is at Cloncurry, and from this
centre supplies are transported to
the station by camel teams, the com-
pany owning 40 of these “ships of
the desert.” The Gulf Cattle Com-
pany, which controls “Brunette
Downs,” was formed in 1912, with
Mr. A. J. Cotton as managing
director. Once a year Mr. Cotton
visits the station, making the journey
by motor car, and remains for from
three to four months directing oper-
ations. His residential property,
“Hidden Vale,” consists of a 10,000-
acre freehold block situated some
four miles distant from the small
rural township of Grandchester, on
the main southern railway line, 44
miles from Brisbane. Originally
forming part of the old “Franklyn
Vale” Station, it is sheltered in the
main by the Liverpool Range of
hills, and in every respect is admir-
ably adapted to the purpose to which
it is mainly devoted by Mr. Cotton,
viz., the breeding of high-class stud
shorthorn bulls. Numerous springs
occur on different parts of the pro-
perty, which, however, is watered in
the main by Mort’s Creek, a

from the neighbouring mountain

and romantic name by which the


estate is known is particularly appro-
priate in view of tlie situation of Mr.
Cotton’s residence, wliich takes the
traveller by surprise no matter from
which direction it is approached.
The house has a southern aspect, and
stands on the edge of an elevated
plateau rising some 200 feet above
the lower portions of the property,
which it overlooks, and in many
respects is pleasantly reminiscent of
the picturesque modern homes built
by well-to-do lovers of mountain air
and scenery on the warmer slopes of
the high tablelands of Switzerland.

the site is enhanced by glimpses of
natural loveliness on all sides, and
made still more enchanting by the
hand of man in the laying out of
glorious gardens and lawns. It has
also its utilitarian value, inasmuch
as this side of the property is
nearest to the railway—the main
mail route to the southern States
passing within four miles of the
homestead. The residence erected

refined, and homelike. Within easy
vicinity of the house are the neces-
sary out-offices, such as motor gar-

stables, and stable-yards, etc., have
been built on the flat in the valley

distant from the house. The pro-
perty was bought by Mr. Cotton in
the year 1900, and since that date
his efforts have been directed to
bringing the estate into the front

schools in England.

Henry Mort, M.L.C., who before the
separation of Queensland from the
HON. HENRY MORT.
Mother State figured prominently in
jmlitical circles as a member of the
legislature of New South Wales.
The late gentleman was born at

December 31, 1818, his family being
a prominent one in that part of
Britain as far back as the early

portion of the seventeenth century.
Upon reaching man’s estate he left
the home of his fathers to join his
brother, the late T. S. Mort, who
had settled in New South Wales in
the year 1838, subsequently becom-
ing a well-known personality in the
early days of the colony. After
arrival Mr. Henry Mort spent
about eighteen months in gain-
ing pastoral experience on vaxdous
station properties, notably at
“Burrowa” and on the late Mr.
(afterwards Sir) John Hay’s station
in the Riverina. In 1842 he took
charge of some shorthorn bulls
imported from England for the late
David Cannon McConnel, of “Cress-
brook,” which he overlanded to the
station from Moreton Bay. He ac-
cepted a position on the “Cress-
brook” property, which at that time
was conducted both as a sheep and
cattle station. A rough diary kept
by Mr. Mort during this period con-
tains some interesting references to
the passing events of his station life,
which ran through the gamut of
mustering the sheep and cattle, gar-
dening, ploughing, well-sinking, giv-
ing lessons to a Manchester lad in the
art of bullock-driving, while “mak-
ing up the account books” was also
a part of his duty. Recreation in
wet weather consisted of “making
cigars, smoking, eating watermelon,
and wishing it would stop rain-
ing.” Allusions to the bill of fare
show that kangaroo-tail soup and
kangaroo steak were considered deli-
cacies, and mention is made of sweet
potatoes, 3 lbs. in weight, grown
from four-month-old vines. Wheat
was grown in small quantities, a
patch giving a crop of 189
bushels, while maize grew to the
height of five feet within six weeks
of planting. The blacks are men-
tioned as being troublesone in the
neighbourhood, and principally on
this account a “heifer station,”
which was formed by Mr. McConnel
and his brothers about 20 miles
higher up the Stanley Creek, had to
be abandoned. Mr. Mort refers to
the lack of surgeons and of religious
teachers in the district, stating that
“in the districts of Moreton Bay and
Darling Downs there are 66 stations
or farms, all except three of which
are within 120 miles of a settlement.
At these 66 stations there are 100
masters or superintendents who pos-
sess upwards of 20,000 sheep, 18,000
horned cattle, and 1,000 horses, and
employ 1,000 men and about 50
women, making a total number of
1,150 souls wholly destitute of
religious instruction, besides many
hundreds of savages (who, by
the way, are now considered
incapable of becoming civilized).
Many of these (he adds) have
been convicts, and addicted to the

examples, without having any minis-
ter of religion to warn them from
the precipice on which they stand,
and to remind them that there is
a hereafter.” Air. Mort concludes


this paragraph with the remark that
if he were a clergyman he would
gladly become a bush missionary on
a salary of £2OO a year. The death
of Robert Balfour, one of the origi-
nal owners of “Col in ton” Station,
is also mentioned. Another incident
noted is in connection with the
heavy floods of 1844: “The rain
yesterday caused the Cressbrook
Creek to rise about 8 feet, in
consequence of which a some-
what ludicrous though dangerous
experience happened to the over-
seer and one of the shepherds
who attempted to cross the creek
riding the same horse. They got
about half way across when the
stream became so rapid that it
unhorsed both men, neither of whom
could swim, and had they not for-
tunately caught hold of an over-
hanging branch of a swamp oak they
would assuredly both have been
drowned. As it was, they had to
remain suspended on the tree for
several hours, when they were at
last happily released from their
perilous situation by the exertions of
two shepherds (both expert swim-
mers) who made a rope of strips of
blankets, with which they managed
to haul the unfortunates across, but
just as the second man was within a
few feet of the bank the rope broke,
and down he went, and had not one
of the shepherds very boldly dived
in to his assistance he would very
certainly have found a watery
grave." A little further on the
horse across the Condamine; and a
poor fellow who was taking a load
of supplies from Limestone (now
Ipswich) had his dray and bullocks
washed away whilst crossing the
Bremer; besides which several men,
bullocks, and drays have been lost
in like manner, so that travelling has
been entirely suspended for many
days.” A flock of culled sheep is
mentioned as having been sold at
2s. 6d. per head, “a very good price
these times.” When Mr. D. C.
McConnel left for England in 1848
Mr. Mort took over the management
of “Cressbrook,” which he continued
until the return of Mr. McConnel in
1849. During this period his
family being born at Cressbrook.
Upon retiring from his duties on
this station, in 1849, he purchased
“Franklyn Vale, then chiefly used
as a sheep run, and comprising the
country within an area, the extreme
points of which are Walloon in the
east, Tent Hill Scrub (near Gatton)
in the west, while in the north the
ranges beyond Grandchester were
included within its boundaries,
which ran as far in a southerly
direction as Mount Mistake—the 320
acres of pre-emptive area surround-
ing the spot where the homestead
now stands. “Franklyn Vale” is

Commissary-General of New South

and save!, daughters, two of the
the original owners. Like many
other runs in the coastal districts
of Queensland, it was discovered
that the territory was pre-eminently
cattle country, and in the early


fifties Mr. Mort having decided that
the ground was not suitable for
sheep pastures, gradually converted
it into a cattle station. Mr. Mort
conducted the property personally

until the end of the year 1854, when
he joined his brother, Mr. T. S.
Mort, in partnership, founding the
firm of Messrs. Mort & Co., the rami-
fications of which extended over the
whole of Australia. This well-known
firm was one of the principal con-
tributors to the building up of the
Australian nation, playing a very
important part in the nurture of her
various industries, and incidentally
doing its share towards history-
making in the land of the Southern
Cross. The late Mr. James Laidley,
after whose family the town of Laid-
ley derives its name, about this time
acquired an interest in “Franklyn
Vale,” and continued his associa-
tion with the property for some
years. In 1871 Mr. Mort admitted
as a partner his son-in-law, the late
E. K. Grace, and for five years the
latter gentleman filled the role of
managing partner on the station.
Upon his departure for the Mother
State the property came under the
control of a succession of managers,
among whom was numbered the late
Colonel Ricardo, who purchased an
interest in the property; and in
January, 1891, Mr. A. E. L. Mort,
who was then about 28 years of age,
was taken by his father into partner-
shin, and for a time managed the
estate on behalf of the family, until
in 1906 he became sole proprietor.
The late Mr. Mort made his entry
into political life as member for the
West Moreton constituency in the
second Parliament of New South
Wales, on which occasion he polled
245 votes for the whole of the
West Moreton District against 103
secured by his opponent, Mr.
Challinor. Subsequently he was re-
turned as representative for the West
Macquarie District, N.S.W., and
after a lengthy period, during which
he did yeoman service in the House,
he received the honour of being
appointed to the Legislative Council
in 1879. His decease occurred at
Sydney on September 6, 1900. The
“Franklyn Vale” estate has under-
gone various changes since it first
came into the possession of the
late Mr. Henry Mort, the Queens-
land Government of the day
resuming about half of the
original lease at the time of the
separation of this State from the
parent colony of New South Wales.
In 1868 another large area was
resumed, leaving “Franklyn Vale”
a freehold property of 10,000 acres,
of which a small portion has since
been disposed of by the present
owner. The original homestead
dates back to 1849, but fell into dis-
use as a dwelling in 1873, upon the
erection of the present building,
which has been added to from time
to time as occasion demanded. Like
many of the old station homes of
Queensland, with little pretence to
any consistency of architectural design,
it yet has a charm all its own,
uniting comfort in the interior with
a picturesque outside appearance,
which has been enhanced rather than
destroyed by the additions of more
modern times. The house stands in
a glorious situation on the crest of
a hill, commanding an extensive
view of the valley in front, being
overlooked in its turn in the far
distance by the towering heights of
the Liverpool Mountains, and nearer
by the Little Liverpool Range. In
places the pasture land gives way to
patches of tillage, some 200 acres of
the estate, chiefly along the banks of
the Franklyn Vale Creek, being
under cultivation, and the whole
scene is one of exquisite peace and
beauty. This creek, which meanders
for some distance through the pro-
perty, adding greatly to the loveli-
ness of the landscape, plays a very
important part in the operations of
the estate, and has never been
known to run dry. In front of the
homestead is a very pretty garden,
with extensive lawns and rose-beds,
where a great variety of blooms
make bright patches of colour and
shed a delicious fragrance on the air.
Ornamental trees are also in evi-
dence, with their own particular
individuality, together with shrubs
of beautiful foliage, frequently
covered with the brilliant plumes of
blossom characteristic of this class of
arboreal growth in the semi-tropical

climate of Queensland. The pro-
perty, which as before-mentioned, of
recent years has been developed
chiefly as a cattle fattening depot,
is worked in conjunction with


“Redbank” Station, on the Burnett,
and “Avoca” Station” on the Bris-
bane River, both of which estates are
also owned by Mr. A. E. L. Mort,
“Redbank” being a pastoral lease com-
prising about 140 square miles, and
“Avoca” a smaller freehold property,
situated on the upper reaches of the
Brisbane, both of which are devoted
exclusively to cattle-raising. Upon
the home estate, “Franklyn Vale,”
considerable attention is also given
to dairying. Mr. A. E. L. Mort is
a native of New South Wales,
having been born at Sydney on
November 11, 1862. He received his
primary education at Mittagong,
and later proceeding to England
completed his scholastic career in
the Old Country, subsequently
becoming engaged in the woollen
industry in Yorkshire. The experi-
ence thus gained he supplemented
during a sojourn in Germany, and in
1882 returned to Australia, and
entered the office of Messrs. Mort
and Co., in Sydney, where he
obtained a most valuable insight
into different phases of commercial
enterprise. In 1891 he took over
the personal management of “Frank-
lyn Vale,” and has since resided on
the station, giving the whole of his
time and attention to the affairs
under his control, and making a
speciality of the breeding of Here-
ford cattle, to which class of stock
he has found the Queensland coun-
try peculiarly suited. Mr. Mort
was created a Justice of the Peace
in the late nineties by the Philp
Administration. He married in

leaving this institution he adopted
the sea as a profession, joining the
mercantile marine as an apprentice
to Messrs. Cowlishaw Bros., of
when he decided to abandon sea-
faring life, and settle on the land in
Australia. Coming to Queensland
he obtained employment on the


“Marnbull” Estate, near Ualby, and
here received a grounding in breed-
ing and handling sheep, and in
station management generally. In
1889 he accepted the position of
overseer on “Gundibindyal” Station,
near Temora, New South Wales, and
remained in charge of this property
until the place was sold in 1890.
After some experience of droving
and bush work Mr. Crocker became
overseer on “Llangollen” Station,
near Merriwa, New South Wales,
which position he occupied for three
years, and in the meantime passed
the New South Wales Government
examination for the position of
inspector of stock. In 1894 he was
offered, and accepted, the post of
stock inspector at Moama, New
South Wales, and in 1896 was trans-
ferred to Mudgee, where he remained
in charge of the district until 1905.
At this time the country was
recovering from the effects of the
great 1902 drought, and as many
pastoral areas were offered for

ally on the creeks and flats, is
exceedingly rich and fertile, lucerne
and other crops being grown to
great advantage. The low-lying hills,
which form splendid grazing, are of
black soil, timbered principally with
ironbark, the flats having a growth
of appletree and gum. The iron-
bark timber is gradually being
killed by ringbarking, to improve the
carrying capacity of the land. The
appletree, the leaves of which afford
good feed for stock, are left stand-
ing, and likewise the gums, which
grow to an immense size, and will
undoubtedly have considerable com-
mercial value in the future. Another
valuable feature is the seam of coal

All over the remainder of
the property good fences
have been erected, and im-
provements have been car-
ried out on a substantial
plan. The estate is devoted
to the breeding of cattle and
horses, for which it is par-
ticularly adapted. The home-
stead is approached by a
good road from Gatton,
which meandering through
wooded valleys, crossing
running streams, and anon
rising to higher ground,
makes a picturesque drive;
while the situation of the
dwelling in the valley of
the well-known Blackfellow
Creek, which has its
source in the surrounding
hills, is one of great
beauty. The house is
built on the mountain side, in a nest
of verdure girded by hills of varying
height. Its architecture suggests
spaciousness and comfort, and
with its many rooms, wide veran-
dahs, and general homeliness,
forms an ideal residence. At ‘ Point

ally occur, drought is unknown, and
extremes of heat and cold are never
experienced. Mr. Crocker is a man
of wide sympathies, and identifies
himself freely with the interests of

extensive reader of standard works

own land and brought up their
children to lives of activity and use-
fulness. They were settled at Sheriff,
Hales, Shropshire, England. Mr.
A. IT. Whittingham’s father, Mr.
George Whittingham, and his
brother, Mr. John Whittingham,
home in 1852. They were both young,
and both were attracted by the pros-
pects which Australia offered. But
like many of the pioneers who lived
to achieve success, they had to make
their own way. They emigrated to
Australia not with money, but to
make money. At that time the most
alluring road to fortune was mining.
To the imagination it was strewn
with wealth. Everyone was under the
golden spell. Messrs. Whittingham
were no exceptions. They went to one
of the rushes in the Bendigo district.
They worked hard, and had some
luck, but they did not acquire riches.
After giving goldmining a fair trial,
they decided to test the possibilities
of New Zealand. The change was
advantageous. In New Zealand they
embarked in general business, and
did very well. As merchants, Whit-
tingham Brothers were recognized as
an enterprising and prosperous firm.
It was in these years really that the
foundations of the family fortunes
were laid. In the early seventies the
Messrs. Whittingham returned to
Australia, and settled in Melbourne.
It was then that they became inter-
ested in pastoral pursuits. Their first
purchase was “Alice Downs,” a vast
run in the Blackall district in Central
Queensland. Pastoral holdings in
those days were more like provinces
than estates of normal proportions.
'“Alice Downs,” a magnificent sheep
station, was then about 1,200 square
miles in extent. The owners were

that the area now is 300 square miles.

Northern Queensland. In one way or
another they had pastoral or other
interests in pretty well every State
in Australia. They were among what
might be termed the most successful
of the second generation of pioneers
in Queensland. They were not of the
men who first opened up Central
Queensland to pastoral occupation,
but they entered at the transition
stage. When they took over “Alice
Downs” the days of hardships and
of isolation were far from over.
Many people would think them not
yet passed, but the fortunate owner
of this run now has a railway within
a few miles of what perhaps is the
finest homestead in Central Queens-
land, and there are few of the incon-
veniences which belonged to pastoral
life thirty or forty years ago. When
Mr. Whittingham’s father first
visited the station he had to travel
over 300 miles by horse or buggy
after leaving the railhead. Compared
with existing conditions living was
in a primitive stage; but it was
hardy, interesting, and with all the
vicissitudes of season and markets,
far from wanting compensations.
Like neighbours and pastoralists near
and far, they suffered heavily in
drought times. In 1898 the firm
shore 200,000 sheep, and in 1914 all
that remained were 21,000. When
1893 ushered in the bank crisis in
Australia, Messrs. Whittingham dis-
posed of their other pastoral holdings
and concentrated themselves upon
“Alice Downs.” They continued to
hold it until 1904, when Mr. A. H.
Whittingham and his brother Harold
bought the property. Mr. Whitting-
ham’s connection with “Alice Downs”
was brought about by the death of
his elder brother. He was intended
for the medical profession, but
when that sad event occurred he
relinquished his studies to identify
himself with the family interests. The
late Mr. George Whittingham and
his wife, Mrs. Selina Whittingham,
had three sons and one daughter.
The eldest, George Holt, died in
1898, and the youngest, Harold, in
1916. Mr. A. H. Whittingham was
born in Dunedin, New Zealand, on
September 20, 1869, and was a child
of about two years when his parents
left the Dominion and settled per-
manently in Melbourne. The family
home was Merton, Caulfield, Vic-
toria. Sent first to private schools,
Mr. Whittingham later attended the
Geelong Grammar School, from
which he matriculated. Proceeding
to England in 1888, he entered at
Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where he
followed the usual Arts course.
Deciding then to take up medicine,
he apjjlied himself to that branch of
study, and for rather more than
three years studied at St. Mary’s
Hospital, London. It was while thus
engaged that his father and his eldest
brother died. He then gave up
medical work, and returned to Aus-
tralia to look after the interests of
his younger brother and sister, and
generally to acquire practical experi-
ence of pastoral work. The death of
Mr. George Whittingham left his
brother, Mr. John Whittingham, the
head of the firm, which had extensive
properties in Victoria and Queens-
land. For about 18 months Mr.
HON. A. H. WHITTINGHAM IN HIS "NAPIER” CAR.
A. 11. Whittingham worked on
“Canally” Station, in the Riverina
district. Then he was sent to look
after “Alice Downs,” in the Mitchell


district, near Blackall. As manager
of this extensive property he acquired
an intimate knowledge of the various
phases of the industry, and proved
his capacity to deal with business on
a large scale. After about six years
of experience in this way, he and his
brother Harold bought the station
from the old firm. This was in 1904,
and some four years later Mr. A. H.
Whittingham bought out his brother
and became the sole proprietor. The
property lies in the heart of the
richest pastoral country in Queens-
land. The Central West, as the
region is called, is a country of great
sheep runs and prosperous towns,
but also it is rich in mineral re-
sources. Gold, copper, coal, and
precious stones all are mined for suc-
cessfully, and in their production help
to swell the collective wealth of the
State. But it is as a wool-producing
area that it is best known and for
the present purposes most interest-
ing. “Alice Downs,” one of the
largest runs, has been highly devel-
oped. Located some 12 miles from
the town of Blackall, it is made up
of gently undulating country, broken
here and there by low ridges, and is
lightly timbered with boree, gidyea
scrub, and edible bushes. To the
advantage of a frontage of 8 miles to
the Barcoo River have been added
the ample water resources of three

artesian and four sub-artesian bores.
Only those*who have seen country in
the dry seasons before the artesian
supplies were tapped can realize what
subterranean water has done for
Central Queensland in general and
each station in particular. The first
bore put down on “Alice Downs” was
sunk in 1888. A flow of 500,000 gal-
lons was struck at a depth of 2,900
feet, and for 30 years now there has
been no appreciable lessening of the
supply. Since that date seven or
eight other bores have been sunk.
The property and the flock through
long years of capable management
have been sedulously built up. Mr.
Whittingham and his manager (Mr.
D. W. Gaukrodger) have spared
neither effort nor money on the
improvement of the wool production
of the station. The flock was bred
from Tasmanian blood, and periodic-
ally additions have been made from
the same source. Mr. Whittingham
maintains a stud flock, from which

the rams used on the station are
bred. Of late years he has refreshed
the strain from outside, and the
“Wanganella” and “Boonoke” rams
which have been introduced have
been, strikingly advantageous. “Alice
Downs” wool justly has a high repu-
tation. Choice parcels of greasy at
recent sales brought 25|d. per lb.
Cattle and horses also are bred on
the station. Usually there is a herd
of about 1,000 head of shorthorns,
bred from bulls that have taken
champion prizes at the Rockhamp-
ton, Longreach, and Blackall shows.
Good draught horses, bred from New
Zealand and other stallions, are
reared for use on the station. Norm-
ally the property carries about 80,000
sheep, but in exceptional seasons
could easily carry a far larger num-
ber. The management, however,
runs no risks from overstocking, and
is content with keeping the carrying
capacity at a high scientific level.
When the droughts come, as come
they do, after intervals of good years,
Nature exacts her toll, but the
country is astonishingly recuperative
and traces of bad times quickly dis-
appear. Still, the policy pursued is
one of progress with safety. The ex-
perienced pastoralist needs no incite-
ment to that. The penalty of over-
stocking is too heavy to be lightly
risked. With reserves of water and
fodder plants, “Alice Downs” is able
to reduce losses to a minimum. To
do this in the 1898-1902 visitation
about 60 men had to be constantly
employed in cutting scrub for sheep
and other stock. For three years Mr.


Whittingliam and his brother were
practically chained to the station,

been comparatively small. This partly
is due to the improved condition of
the run and partly to prudent and
far-seeing management. When Mr.
Whittingham first settled in the dis-
trict he was fresh from the Riverina,
and conditions in the central district
were very different. He soon became
acclimatized, as it were, and as the
lessening burden of management
gave him more leisure, he identified
himself with the pastoral, local, and
social interests of the district. In
conjunction with Mr. Gaukrodger he
also became interested in “Lance-
vale” and “Westhill,” two adjacent
properties. He took an active part
in local government, and on one
occasion unsuccessfully contested the
Barcoo electorate against Mr. George
Kerr, who afterwards became Minis-
ter for Railways. The predominance
of the Labour vote in the Barcoo ren-
dered it impossible for any squatter
to win. Yet there was a very pressing
.need for the great interests of the
electorate to be represented in the
Legislature. This was recognized by
the appointment of Mr. Whitting-
ham to the Legislative Council in
1912. He sits there practically as
the representative of the pastoral
industry as well as the non-party
interests of the community. As
president of the United Pastoralists’
Association in a special way he voices
the views of those who are actually
concerned in the industry, and has
been able to render valuable services
to the State by adequately voicing
the interests of the most important
branch of primary production. Out-
side of personal business, which
impels him to identify himself with
all questions affecting stock and land
laws, he finds his chief hobby and
recreation in racing. At an early
stage of his residence in Queensland
he became a member of the Queens-
land Turf Club committee, and has
since become well known as a breeder
and owner of successful racehorses,
Naturally he took a keen interest in
the Blackall Racing Club, and shared
with his neighbours and the towns-
people the western sympathy with
genuine, clean sport. Not a few good
performers have come from the
“Alice Downs” stud, and Mr. Whit-
tingham’s racing colours (blue and
gold hoops with gold cap), long
familiar on the racecourses of Central
Queensland, have since won distinc-
tion in the metropolis. In his
Blackall days Mr. Whittingham’s
“Victory” won several races and cap-
tured many a blue riband in show
rings, while his station-bred “Faith”
and other blood horses did well on
the turf. Love of equestrian sport, in
fact, is a heritage. Mr. Whitting-
ham's father was a keen sportsman,
but with him the specialization was
in coursing. The Waterloo Cup was
one of his rewards. Mr. John Whit-
tingham, like his nephew, was more
attracted by racing. Among Mr.
A. H. Whittingham’s successes on
the Ascot course, Brisbane, may be
mentioned the “Hopeful Stakes”
(twice) with “Steely” and “Dunin-
ald,” and the Queensland “Guineas”
and the Q.T.C. “Derby,” which were
accounted for by “Lordacre” (Lin-
acre” (imp.) —“Rosette.”') When
Mr. Whittingham and his brother
took over “Alice Downs” the home-
stead was a commodious structure
built of pise in 1885. It belonged to
a period, however, when the mode
of living kept up as it were a working
connection with the pioneer days.
Still, the house was pleasantly situ-
ated, and surrounded by a spacious
garden, and respected as a typical
centre of western hospitality, it was
in most respects the typical home-
stead of a prosperous western

squatter. Of late years it has been
completely modernized and enlarged,
and is unsurpassed among the coun-
try homes of the district. Surrounded
by broad verandahs, from which a
fine view of the magnificent undulat-
ing downs may be obtained, encircled
with a well-kept garden—an oasis of
colour and fragrance in a low,
spreading plain of waving grass —
and furnished and equipped on
thoroughly modern lines, it is in
every respect a pleasant place of
residence. Life on “Alice Downs” is
an education in the spaciousness, the
independence, and the essential viril-
ity of western life. Mr. Whittingham
made it his home until a few years
ago, and though he no longer lives
there, he is a frequent visitor. While
he was a resident he took a prominent
part in the public and social life of
Central Queensland. Tie was chair-
man of the shire council, chairman
of the Marsupial Board, chairman of
the hospital committee, and Master
of the Blackall Masonic Lodge (E.C.).
On removing to Brisbane new inter-
ests enlisted his sympathy. As a
member of the Legislative Council
the periodical revisions of the Land
Laws claimed his principal attention,
and he is a regular attendant and a
speaker whose views are heard
with respect. He was prominent in
opposing as undemocratic and dis-
honourable the repeated attempts to
abrogate the bargain as to rents made
with the pastoralists as embodied in
the Land Act of 1910. Naturally he

is a strong opponent of the proposals
for abolishing the Legislative Coun-
cil, and placing the varied interests
entirely in the hands of a
one-chambered Legislature. The effort
made to get power to commandeer the
meat works without the safeguard
that it must be done on just terms
was also opposed by him. But natur-
ally it is as a recognized authority
on all questions affecting the pastoral
industry that Mr. Whittingham
speaks with special weight. Outside
actual politics he has diversified in-
terests. As president of the United
Pastoralists’ Association, which has
its headquarters at Union Bank
Chambers, Queen Street, Brisbane,
he has important responsible work to
do. He was preceded in the chair
by Mr. W. W. Wood, the late
Mr. John Cameron, and the
late Mr. William Allen, all experi-
enced pastoralists. The United Pas-
toralists’ Association has been and is
a most valuable institution. It has
bound the pastoralists together by
common ties, and enabled them to
speak with one voice and act in unity.
A PAIR OF HACKS AT "ALICE DOWNS.”
Mr. Whittingham has seen its work
grow during his term of office, and
he has been an energetic and vigilant
guardian of its interests. He is also
chairman of the Union Trustees Ltd.,
a director of the A.M.L. & F. Co.,
Ltd., and a member of various
boards, as well as president of the
Queensland Club. Thus between
politics, business, sport, and social
life, Mr. Whittingham has very little
unoccupied time, and what not a few
men would regard as very inadequate
leisure. In June, 1914, Mr. Whit-
tingham was married to Miss Cecile
Taylor, daughter of Mrs. Lumley
Hill, of “Bellevue” Station, Esk dis-
trict. By marriage he became con-
nected with several of the oldest
squatting families in Queensland.
Mrs. Lumley Hill was a daughter of
Mrs. George Harris, who in the early
days was the gracious and hospitable
hostess at “Newstead,” the old-
fashioned bungalow house which
occupies the picturesque knoll at the
junction of the Brisbane River and
Breakfast Creek. Mr. George Harris
was the head of the then big mer-
cantile house of J. &G. Harris. Mrs.
Lumley Hill was previously married
to a son of the late Hon. James
Taylor, M.L.C., referred to elsewhere
in these pages. Mr. Lumley Hill
was largely .interested in pastoral
property, and years ago was an
influential member of the Legislative
Assembly. Mr. Whittingham’s only
sister is Mrs. Norton Grimwade, of
Melbourne. Private address, “May-

in the Hunter River district he
entered the commercial house of
Hughes & Hoskins, where he con-
tinued for several years. About four
years after his arrival, however, he
turned his attention to pastoral
enterprise in association with his
wife’s cousin, Mr. William Humph-
reys, one of the pioneers of the
Moreton Bay district, who first took
up “Mundoolun,” and gave to that
property the name by which it has
since become so widely known. Mr.
Collins was admitted into partner-
ship by Mr. Humphreys, and joining
him at “Mundoolun” began the
building-up of the great pastoral
enterprise which eventually led to
the formation of the firm of John
Collins & Sons, which has played so
important a part in opening up and
stocking with sheep and cattle large
areas in Queensland and elsewhere
in Australia. Mr. Collins purchased
his partner’s interests in 1847, and
engaged in sheep-raising at “Mun-
doolun” until 1861, when realizing
the unfitness of the coast country for
sheep-breeding on an extended scale
he decided to move his flock to the
Dawson. Starting out in 1861 he
spent a couple of years travelling
and resting the sheep on hired coun-
try near Taroom, at the expiration
of this period purchasing “West-
grove,” and subsequently “Box
Vale.” The Dawson country proving
unfit for sheep, some years later a
removal still further westward was
resolved on by Mr. Collins, who was
now receiving material assistance in
the handling of the stock from his
sons, Robert Martin and William.
In 1875 “Morney Plains” and
“Whitula” Stations, near the present
town of Windorah, were taken up
and stocked, Mr. Collins’ two sons
being the actual pioneers of that
part of Queensland and the first to
take sheep as far west as Cooper
Creek. The firm took up about the
same time “Mount Leonard” on the
Diamantina River, which station,
together with “Morney Plains,” was
disposed of by them in the following
year. In 1877 “Whitula” was sold at
a satisfactory figure, and about this
time “Springvale,” west of the
Diamantina River, was acquired,
and later sold. Shortly afterward a
tract of new country, known as
“Mount Merlin,” on the Mort River,
in the Gregory North district, was
purchased, and an adjoining block
of considerable dimensions having
been also secured the Messrs. Collins
bought “Warenda,” which, first
stocked with cattle, was afterwards
converted into a sheep and cattle
station. “Warenda” was sold to the
late Edward Wienholt in 1881.
Originally “Mount Merlin” was
stocked with cattle, and has since
been worked exclusively as a cattle
run. Twenty years later (in 1903),
having experienced the necessity of
holding a large area of country for
even a moderate-sized herd, Messrs.
MR. WILLIAM COLLINS.
Collins & Sons bought the adjoining
run “Chatsworth,” unstocked, and

2,000 square miles, as one property.

partnership in the far west of
Queensland include a large area be-
tween the Diamantina and Georgina

selection in 1899 badly lacked for

taken up by the Messrs. Collins over
20 years previously and abandoned
on account of its dryness. The
adjoining run, “Coorabulka,” was
next secured, but being unable to
obtain the necessary plant for boring
purposes practically all the cattle
were lost in 1900-1, only 300 being
saved out of a herd of 5,000. Since
then the firm has put down 10
artesian bores, which provide an
ample supply, rendering “Coora-
bulka” one of the safest runs for
water in the west. In 1878 a partner-
ship was entered into with the late
Sir Thomas Mcllwraith and the late
lion. W. Forrest, operating under
the style of the North Australian
Pastoral Company, and large areas
of country in the Northern Territory
were taken up and stocked with
cattle. Before this the company
purchased “Tnkerman” and “Wood-
stock” Stations, on the Burdekin
River, North Queensland, together
with the large herds of cattle depas-
tured on these runs. A proportion
of these cattle was removed to the
Northern Territory, where "Alex-
andria” and “Soudan” Stations, on
the Playford and Rankin Rivers
respectively, were formed. Fairly
large herds were built up on these
stations, but on two occasions the
numbers were reduced to a quarter
of their normal size through drought
and failure of the water supply.
During the past few years the com-
pany has put down a number of sub-
artesian bores, obtaining excellent
supplies of water, which with the aid
of powerful steam pumping plants are
raised 250 to 300 feet into large
receiving tanks. The stations are now
carrying about 40,000 cattle, and are
independent of natural surface
water. In 1883 the firm of Collins,
White, & Company was formed, in
the personnel of which were included
the Hon. Simon Fraser, the late Sir
Malcolm McEachern (both of Mel-
bourne), and Mr. Albert W. D.
White of “'Bluff Downs,” North
Queensland. This new combination
purchased “Eulolo,” “Beaudesert,”
and “Strathfield” Stations, adjoining
properties situated near McKinlay
in the Burke district, and proceeded
to make extensive improvements,
which included 16 artesian bores and
hundreds of miles of fencing. By
the close of 1896 a flock of 120,000
sheep and 37,000 head of cattle was
grazed on these areas, but at the
present time, owing to the dry
seasons and partly to the resumption
by the Crown of large areas,
these numbers have been reduced

home on the station. He continued
to give his exclusive attention to the
development of the pastoral interests
of his firm until 1896, when the re-
sponsibilities of political life put
forward a successful claim upon his
time and energies. In the last-
mentioned year he was returned at
the head of the poll by the Albert
constituency, and during the three
years that he retained this seat he
was a pillar of strength to the
Liberal Party. At the close of that
Parliament he dropped out of active
political life, and from that time
onwards confined his efforts to the
furtherance of the pastoral and com-
mercial prosperity of Queensland. His
(and Mr. William Collins’) close con-
nection with the foundation of many
of the State’s largest business con-
cerns without doubt was one of the
determining factors in the scheme of
their success, and the solid bases on
which they rest to-day and the con-
sistent manner in which they have
flourished are standing tributes to
the ability which was brought to
bear on their organization. Mr.
Collins was a consistent advocate for
the reservation of that large area
now known as the Lamington
Plateau. He urged on succeeding
Governments, and also brought to
the notice of the public, its claims as
a national park and ’health resort,
So long ago as September, 1896, he
read before the Queensland branch
of the Royal Geographical Society
of Australasia a paper which he
prepared dealing with this magnificent
area. He piloted Lord Lamington (a
former Governor of Queensland,
after whom it is named) and his
party over the plateau, and although
it is now the proclaimed National
Park of Queensland, Mr. Collins did

not live to see the fruit of his
efforts in that direction. In 1913
he was honoured by the offer
of a seat in the Legislative Council,
and was once again prevailed upon
to accept the burden of states-
manship. It fell to Mr. Collins to
move the Address-in-Reply, an effort
which was distinguished by the cul-
ture and earnestness characteristic of
all his utterances. He was, however,
in failing health, and the strenuous-
uess of public claims, added to his
other duties, only served to hasten
the end. He died on August 18,
1913, leaving behind him a worthy
record of work well accomplished and
a name that is synonymous with all
that has contributed to the well-
being of the community, whose des-
tinies he helped in so sincere and
effective a manner to mould. Of the
late Robert Martin Collins it may
justly be said that his public life and
private character endeared him to all
classes. His career was one of which
a young country might well be
proud, for added to his unswerving
integrity, strong mentality, and
sound practical common sense, was
the intrepid courage which incited
him to blaze the trail in many
untrodden areas of the vast interior
and to carry out schemes of develop-
ment which required the power of
large and spacious thought. His
memory has been perpetuated by his
family who erected All Saints’
Memorial Church at “Tamrookum.”
When consecrating the church, His


Grace the Archbishop of Brisbane
(Dr. Donaldson) paid glowing tribute
to the noble nature of the deceased
gentleman. “His life was a noble
and glorious one, his public actions
were of the loftiest, and his outlook
on all subjects was the most spacious.
His love of family tradi-
tion was a passion. He verily be-
lieved that in the home life the best
and most gracious elements of human
character could be nurtured, thence
to be carried into all relationships
with our fellow-beings.” He left a
widow, six daughters, and one
son, the latter (Mr. C. J. Collins)
now being managing partner of
the firm of John Collins & Sons.
The late WILLIAM COLLINS, oi
“Nindooinbah,” who up to the time
of his death was a member of the
firm of John Collins & Sons, was the
second son of the late John Collins,
and was born at “Mundoolun” in the
year 1846. Like his brothers, he
received his education at Mr. Castle’s
Calder House School, Sydney, and
almost immediately after the termin-
ation of his studies commenced pion-
eering work in association with his
father and elder brother. He assisted
in 1863 in the formation of “West-
grove” Station, at the head of the
Dawson River, and was occupied
with the administration of that pro-
perty until 1875. After this country
was finally declared unsuitable for
part in the development of the firm’s
interests in Queensland and the
Northern Territory, purchasing large

addition to these valuable services
he assisted in carrying on the large
grazing business in the Logan dis-

deal of freehold land, principally for
fattening cattle for the freezing
works. Subsequently a large portion
of the land was cut up into farms
and sold for dairying purposes.

between the large wool-broking firms
and the innovators was long and
severe, but at length Mr. Collins’
persistency of purpose won the day.
As a result all the leading wool-

Henry King, Sydney.
MR. WELLINGTON COCHRANE BUNDOCK .
Wellington Cochrane Bundock, a
native of Devonshire, and a son of a
British naval officer who flourished in
the days when the “wooden walls of
England” were her pride and glory,
being descended from a family who
followed the naval profession as far
acquirement of landed property at
Bridgeman, on the River Gwydir,
where he settled down to pastoral
pursuits on a tract of country which
he developed as a sheep station.
Subsequently he disposed of this pro-
perty to take up “Wyangarie”
Estate, on the Richmond River, then
owned by his brother-in-law, and
thenceforward continued to reside in
this locality, which is noted as one
of the most beautiful spots in New
South Wales. It is an interesting bit
of history that this country was
originally discovered by a convict
of the name of Craig, an escapee
from Moreton Bay, Brisbane, who
lived with the aborigines for years,
and in their company passed through
this and all the coastal country
as far as Trial Bay, where he
gave himself up to the authorities.
On his way he had discovered a num-
ber of strayed and lost Government
cattle, and was offered a free pardon
on condition that he showed where
they were. This he did, and sub-
sequently made a living by conduct-
ing settlers to the newly-discovered
lands. Among these was the late
E. D. S. Ogilvie, of “Yulgilbar,”
Clarence River (brother-in-law of
the late W. C. Bundock), who took
up “Wyangarie,” which soon passed
into Mr. Bundock’s possession.

the whole of a herd of 14,000 cattle

by the new owners to be cattle
country par excellence , and shortly
afterwards the sheep were sold to
make room for the large herd of
high-class shorthorns which since has
been built up. After Mr. Francis
Bundock’s retirement in 1904, Mr.
C. W. Bundock, the sole remaining
proprietor, admitted into partner-
ship Mr. Patrick Salmon, who

were everywhere numerous and
hostile, and at no time were
the lives of the settlers safe
from their vindictive visitations.
In those now far-off days, however,
the vista held no terrors for the

the footsteps of those who had
earned the proud name of "gallants

now bravely confronted perils and
problems of a different nature, and

nation in the opening up of the


country. The work called for much
personal sacrifice, but the very diffi-
culty of pioneer enterprise frequently
had the effect of bringing out the
best in those who offered themselves
upon this altar, and in common with
his fellow-toilers on the field Mr.
Charles Wyndham Bundock regards
the country of his adoption with a
very real affection, which is the best
evidence of the value of her service
•to him in bringing out the latent
qualities of his manhood. Memories
of these days recall to his mind the
honest though rugged friendships of
the times of romance that are gone,
and the bush friends, few, but tried
and faithful, long since passed away.
In 1898 Mr. Bundock inherited
from his father his present station
property, “Kooralbyn,” first taken
up in 1870 by Mr. John Haygarth.
Originally this estate formed part of
the old “Tamrookum” run, and was
purchased as freehold, which it still
remains, the acreage having been
varied somewhat throughout the
intervening period. It contains some
12,000 acres of exceptionally good
grazing land, embracing some very
rich flats here and there along the
precipitous character. Good shelter
for stock abounds, the country being
well timbered with various kinds of
native trees, among which the valu-
able ironbark predominates, and for
its water supply the estate is chiefly

extra accommodation became neces-

mountain, from which the property

“Natal Downs,” “Kooralbyn” is
conducted as a cattle run, the only
other stock grazed on the pastures
being a small flock of sheep for
station use, and the usual mob of
horses kept for the requirements of
the property. Mr. Bundock is a
keen lover of a good horse, and he
sees to it that the equine representa-
tives of “Kooralbyn” breeding are
well above the average. In. his
youth he had considerable experience
in the pigskin, sporting silk with
some success, and still keeps up a
degree of activity in this direction,

personal friend, and the familv still
holds in its possession letters that
passed between Hugh Macdonald
and Governor Macquarie at the
time the trouble arose between the
latter and the military office in Syd-
ney. Mr. C. L. Macdonald, with his
brothers (Macquarie and Stephen),
was educated at Mr. Bradley’s
private school, Sydney, with a fin-
ishing course at Dr. Lang’s college
in the same city. It is interesting
to note that the lads were accus-
tomed to bathe in any part of Syd-
ney Harbour without any fear of
sharks, which apparently at that
period had never ventured into the
harbour. Mr. Macdonald and his
brothers were each in turn offered
commissions in the Army by Gov-
ernor Macquarie, which they de-
clined, their preference leaning
towards land settlement, in conse-
quence of which the family incurred
the severe displeasure of their old
friend. The first position of trust
occupied by Mr. C. L. Macdonald
after leaving school was that of
manager of a large farm owned by
a relative, and situated on the Hun-
ter River in close proximity to- the
site of the present town of Morpeth.
Subsequently, in 1841, in company
with his brother Macquarie, he
travelled across the Darling Downs
and formed “Dugandan” Station,
on the Teviot Brook, which they
stocked with sheep that they had
overlanded from New South Wales.
During the period of his residence
on “Dugandan,” with the help of
the natives he and his brother cut
the first track through the “Dugan-
dan” scrub, by means of which
they were enabled to Jake their bul-
lock teams to Moreton Bay . (Bris-
bane), by way of Limestone (Ips-
wich). The Boonah railway line now
runs almost side by side with the
route followed by the old track. Mr.
C. L. Macdonald on one occasion
had the honour of piloting through
this scrub the first Governor of
Queensland, Sir George Bowen, by
whom at a later date he was ap-
pointed to the Commission of the
Peace, the “Government Gazette”
notifying the appointment bearing
date January 1, 1863. After a short
time at “Dugandan” he sold his
interest to his brother, and acquired
on his own account the “Crows’
Nest” and “Perseverance” Stations,
which in turn he disposed of to
settle on “Nundubinmere,” in the
New England district, and close to
“Ballandean” and “Tenterfield”
Stations. In 1858 another move
was made from “Nundubinmere,”
to which station Mr. Macdonald
brought his bride, and where his
eldest two children were born, to
“Bromelton,” on the Logan River,
adjoining “Dugandan,” which he
purchased from Mr. Fairholm, and
which became his permanent home.
After settling at “Bromelton” he
took into partnership the brothers,
MR. CAMPBELL L. MACDONALD, JUN.
Messrs. Thomas and Francis John
Coulson, a connection which was
broken by the withdrawal of the
former gentleman after a short
period. With his remaining partner,
some few years later, Mr. Macdonald

as “Crystal Brook,” which they con-
verted into a good-sized holding by
MR. THOMAS HENRY MACDONALD.
the addition of adjacent country
that they were able to take up.
One thousand breeding cattle were
sent out from “Bromelton” to stock
this new venture, and eventually the


herd developed into one of the larg-
est and best in that district. In
1896 Mr. F. J. Coulson retired from
the partnership, his interest being
acquired by Mr. Macdonald, who
remained sole proprietor during the
remainder of his life, though from
MR. HUGH LINDSAY MACDONALD .
that date onward he received the in-
valuable assistance of his three
sons, Macquarie, Campbell Living-
stone, and Hugh Lindsay, whose co-
operation was of the greatest pos-
• sible benefit to him in his declining
years. In 1907 he decided to cut
up and sell a portion of his ‘‘Bro-
melton” estate, and during that
year disposed of a fairly large block
on the Teviot. The following year
several agricultural farms on the
Logan River were purchased from
him by arrivals from Victoria, and
after his death, which occurred in
1909 at the ripe age of 90 years and
11 months, the disposal of farms on
the river was continued by his trus-
tees until nearly two-thirds of the
original estate had passed into other
hands, the old homestead and sur-
rounding land being retained by
the family, in whose possession it
yet remains. "Crystal Brook,’’
which in the intervening years since
its selection had been the scene of
extensive improvement work, fenc-
ing and bores considerably increas-
ing the carrying capacity and en-
hancing the value of the holding,
was also disposed of by Mr. Mac-
donald’s trustees in 1913, just prior

the land, caused by drought, low
prices for stock, etc., were his por-
tion, but in the long run he had the
good fortune to triumph over them
all. Throughout his life in the bush
he was successful in maintaining
friendly relations with the aborigi-
nals, and although he narrowly
escaped molestation by them on
more than one occasion, be had the
satisfaction of being able to say that
he never had to resort to the use of
firearms in his dealings with the
blacks. He was recognized on all
sides as a man of ability, and on
several occasions was requested to
stand for Parliament, an honour he
always steadfastly declined. His
interest in politics, nevertheless, re-
mained always very keen, and his
influence was responsible for the
registering of many votes in sup-
port of the party he favoured. Much
of historic interest is necessarily
bound up with the career of one
wdio spent a full half-century in a
new country like Queensland, and
as a link with a remoter past it is
worthy of note that Mr. Macdonald
had for godfather Major Wellman,
who fought in the battle of Corunna
and was in command of the party
which attended the burial of Sir
John Moore on the evening of that
great battle. Referring to the

period of his early youth in the
Mother State, the origin of the
name of Macdonaldton is easily
traceable to the circumstance that
Mr. Macdonald’s father originally
owned a considerable portion of the
area upon which that populous sub-
urb of Sydney is situated. About
the time of his advent to Queens-
land no attempt at settlement had
been made on the south side of the
Brisbane River, and the present site
of Stanley Street was occupied by
a chain of waterholes, which Mr.
Macdonald and others had to cross

with their wool teams for the pur-
pose of grazing their bullocks where
the city of South Brisbane now
stands. The north side was chiefly
occupied by a convict settlement,
and travellers coming in from the
bush had to obtain a pass from the
Commandant before crossing the
river to the settlement where the
few business places existed. “Bro-
melton,” which, it may be men-
tioned in passing, was the birth-
place of Mrs. Campbell Praed, w r as
noted for a large lagoon in front
of the homestead, which was sup-
posed by the blacks to be bottomless
and the haunt of a bunyip. Prior
to the 1902 drought its depth was
taken, showing 85 feet of water,
and since that period the lagoon
has never overflowed. Mr. Macdon-
ald married in 1854 Miss Rachel
Clark, of Kent, England, then re-
siding in Brisbane with her parents,
and the result of this union was a
family of six sons and eight daugh-
ters, all of whom, with the excep-
tion of one son. survived their
father, and are settled in Queens-
land. Mr. and Mrs. Macdonald were
renowned for their large-hearted and
genial hospitality both to friends and
strangers alike, and there was admit-
tedly no limit to the accommodation
that the old home at “Bromelton”
could be made to provide in time of
need.


COLIN JOHN CAMPBELL
PHILP, of “Wyaralong” Station,
Beaudesert, was born at Townsville,
Queensland, on August 17, 1879,
and is the eldest son of Sir Robert
Philp, K.C.M.G., who came from
Glasgow to Australia in 1862, and
subsequently, after a period in the
office of Messrs. Bright Bros., mer-
chants, of Brisbane, became one of
the founders, in 1863, of the well-
known mercantile and shipping firm
of Burns, Philp, & Co., Limited.
Fragmentary records of the “Philp
family of Fife” appearing in the
“Registrum Sigilli Regum Scotorum”
and other public documents of
Scotland give an interesting out-
line of the history of this ancient
family, which has been established
in the County of Fife, Scotland, for
many hundreds of years. Of such
antiquity, indeed, are the remotest
traditions relating to the Philps that
it is highly probable that the family
sprang from autocthonous stock,
strong evidence in this direction
being given by the following quaint
old rhyme, which though conceived
in a spirit of vain-glory, which is
certainly not a characteristic family
trait, is worth quoting:
There were Philps in Fyff ere heather
blowed,
There were Philps in Fyff ere Leven
flowed,
So An’sters, Horsbrughs, Duffs, and
Crewes
Are to the Philps mere parvenus.
According to tradition, the family
held a feudal fief in the Ochil Hills
seventeenth century, claimed descent
from “Philp, ye Chamberlayne of ye
Bruce”; but this is erroneous, as
the office of chamberlain was un-
known until the time of King David

landowners in the county of Fife
from very early days, and among
other possessions held by them were
the Barony of Kippo and large hold-
ings at Lindores (Lundorus), New-
burgh, Balgonie, and Borriehoill
(Boar Hill), the last-named property
continuing in the family until the
notaries, clerics, physicians, and
merchants, upon occasion members
of the family have made more
distinguished appearances on the
broader stage bf Scottish history.
One Philp, in the office of secretary
to the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland,
made a spirited, if bloodthirsty,
appeal in the name of the Lord-
Lieutenant to the gentry of the
Border counties to “ruit out” by
force of arms the disturbers of the
peace of the realm. Another held
military command in the north of
Ireland in the reign of James I. and
VI., and appears to have had some
anxious moments during the rebel-
lion of “Odoghertie” in 1608. James
Philp already mentioned, was clerk
to the Privy Council. John Philp,
Abbot of Lindores, was one of
the last Roman Catholic jirelates
before the Reformation, and Dr.
Henry (or Henricus) Philp, as a
follower of John Knox, took a pro-
minent part in the establishing of
the Reformation, and was the first
divine of the Church of Scotland to
be honoured with the degree of the
Doctor of Divinity, his prominent
position in the church, no less than
his erudition, being attested by the
fact that he was chosen by the Uni-
versity of St. Andrew to read a
Latin discourse before that learned
pedant, King James I. and VI.
This notable Philp is commemorated
by a monument at Arbroath, where
he long ministered. His son has

by which it is still known. After

ARTHUR JOHN McCONNEL,
J.P., “Dugandan” Station, Boonah,
was born at the world's metropolis on
May 17, 1856, and is a son of the late
Hon. John McConnel, who shared
with others the hard-won honours of
early pioneer enterprise in connec-
tion with the pastoral industry of
Queensland. The late gentleman
was among the very earliest of those
to seek their fortune in the northern
portion of what was then an immense
territory known under the name of
New South Wales—the separation of
Queensland from the Mother State
being then in the far distant future.
He arrived at Moreton Bay in 1842,
having left his native city, Man-
chester, England, to join his brother,
the late David Cannon McConnel,
who had preceded him to the newly-
opened territory in the southern
hemisphere some two years before.
Coming to Cressbrook (named after
his elder brother’s property in
Derbyshire), at the head of the
Brisbane River, David McConnel
took up the station known ever since
under that name, which has now
attained the distinction of being the
oldest pastoral property still remain-
ing in the hands of the family of
the original proprietor. In 1842,
when his brother arrived, the latter
found the historic “Cressbrook” just
formed and well on the way to
and silk spinning on a large scale,
and by virtue of his previous occupa-
tion was in a measure handicapped
for the duties required of him in the
role of pioneer pastoralist. Follow-
ing the example of his junior,
HON. JOHN MCCONNEL.
however (David was 12 years younger
than his brother), he resolutely dis-
carded any hampering traditions
and habits of his former life, and
settling down at “Cressbrook” he
proceeded with determination and
established commercial interests at
the settlement of Cressbrook; also
that in the middle forties he owned
“Helidon” Station —now only an
historic memory; while in 1848 he
joined his brother David in the pur-
chase of “Durundur” Station from
the Archer family, and worked that
property in conjunction with “Cress-
brook” on terms of partnership.
Upon the departure of David for the
land of his birth, on an extended
holiday tour, John McConnel took
up his residence on the latter pro-
perty, exercising complete control of
affairs during the absence of the
founder of the station. In 1862 the
partnership which had existed
between the two sturdy pioneers for
so lengthy a period was dissolved,
David retaining “Cressbrook,” and
his elder brother taking over the
sole proprietorship of “Durundur,”
which he made his headquarters,
while spending a considerable por-
tion of his time at Sandgate, near
Brisbane. In 1864 Mr. McConnel
entered the Parliamentary arena, and
sat as a member of the Legislative
Council until compelled by deafness
(a constitutional affliction, aggra-
vated by the rough life he had led)
to retire. In 1875 he took into
partnership Mr. H. C. Wood (at a
later period a member of the Upper
House), and continued pastoral
prosperity. John McConnel had
been brought up to the silk-spinning
industry by his father (the late

1831), who was engaged in cotton

years of age, having won for him-
self an honoured name which will be
for ever enshrined in the annals of
the country which he made in so
loyal a sense his own. Mr. Arthur
John McConnel, J.P., the subject of
this memoir, was the only son of his

was brought to Australia, where he

Boys’ Grammar ' School. Upon
entering his teens he was sent to
England to complete his studies,
and having spent a couple of
years at the well-known Clifton
College underwent a course of
private tuition, upon the termination
of which he returned to Queensland
in the year 1876. Taking up his
residence on his father’s station,
“Durundur,” he devoted himself to
general pastoral pursuits, and in
1881 inaugurated there the famous
Hereford herd, which has proved
such a brilliant success, and from
which so many notable studs have
been founded. Among others, Mrs.
Lumley Hill’s well-known “Bellevue”
herd was established with stock bred
by Mr. McConnel. In 1895 Mr.
McConnel entered into partnership
dissolved, Mr. McConnel making his
departure on a trip to England
shortly afterwards. At the close of
the same year he once more set foot

interests in these properties. A
word must be given to the pictur-

in the breeding of Hereford cattle,
and as was only natural became one
of the pioneers of the Australian

has always displayed the greatest
enthusiasm in connection with this

of the society in 1885 he has under-

“Faasifern” at this time was a cattle
station, but sheep were introduced
from “Blythedale” by the new
owners, and these did well for a few
years, when they were replaced by
cattle, as it was found that poison-
ing the dingos led to an enormous
increase in marsupials. These became
so numerous that they had to be
fenced out by wallaby-proof paling
fences, a work involving great
expense. Kangaroos also were a
great nuisance, and drives were
instituted, 20,000 being shot during
a period extending over a few
.months. When the sheep were
replaced by cattle the dingos
increased rapidly in numbers, and
prevented the recurrence of this
pest. The “Fassifern” property
gradually became a freehold estate

descendant of one of the most ancient
of the Irish families who for cen-
turies past have made their home in
the West of Ireland, and whose pro-
genitors were allied to the Welsh and
British princes of a still earlier
period, whence their claim to rela-
tionship with the founders of the
Celtic race. “Thomas Joyce is
recorded amongst the first of the
Irish families, who have so long held
sway in the ‘lsland of Saints and
Scholars,’ to have been the first of
the name who came to Ireland,
having sailed from Wales in the
reign of Edward 1., and arrived with
his fleet at Thomond, in Munster,
where he married Onorah O’Brien,
daughter of the chief of that dis-

he directed his course to the western
port of Connaught (or Connacht, as
it was then written), where he

country. While on the voyage his
wife was delivered of a son, who was
called Mac Mara, or ‘Son of the Sea.’

remarkable for their extraordinary

Joyce country. The families of
Joyce Grove, in the County Galway,
Oxford in Mayo, and Woodquay, in
the town of Galway, and Mervue,
near that town, are the descendants
of this old family.” The subject of
this notice, Mr. Edgar Joyce, came
to Queensland with three of his
brothers in the year 1885, and, as
before stated, belonged to a large
family, various members of which
migrated to different parts of the
world. Proving himself of like
calibre with the intrepid pioneers
who had preceded him in the open-
ing up of the new country, he threw
himself into rough work of the bush,
never disdaining to take the brunt of
any fresh enterprise, and loyally
assisting in the development of a
station property near Dalby, which
was taken up by his brother, the
late William J. Joyce. From here
he graduated to a more responsible
position in the western districts,
near Boulia, where he managed
“Chatsworth” Station for some years
before returning to his native land
in 1891. Upon taking up his resi-
dence once more in Queensland, Mr.
MR. EDGAR JOYCE.
Joyce purchased his present estate,
known as “The Overflow,” and
straightway applied himself to
solving the problem set by Nature
before those who essayed to form
homes for themselves on the virgin
soil, where primeval forest or scrub
had hitherto held sole sway. He has
met with much success in his under-
taking, and whilst engaged in the
conduct of his own operations has
taken a prominent part in all move-
ments for the advancement of the
district, proving himself a very
useful member of the community
with which he has cast in his lot.
Mr. Joyce married in 1900 Maria
Henrietta Elizabeth, daughter of
Mr. De Burgh Persse, to whom refer-
ence is made elsewhere in this work;
and of this marriage there is issue
one son and eight daughters.
Captain GRAHAM ERNEST
MYLNE. On a commanding emi-
nence, ovexdooking the beauties of
Moreton Bay stands the well-known
old residence, “Lota,” where for
some years has lived Mr. Graham
Ernest Mylne, a scion of one of the
oldest families in this State. Mr.
Mylne was born in 1866, his birth-
place being that well-known pastoral
holding, “Amby Downs.” His
father, Captain Graham Mylne, was
born in 1832, and his parents
mapped out for him a military
career. After the completion of his
education, and subsequent to his
military training, he went to India,
at that time the military training
ground for all young bloods whcse
ambition ran high. While there he
took an active part in the work of
quelling the Indian Mutiny, an
incident in Anglo-Indian history
that had so significant a bearing on
the subsequent destiny of the realms
of the rajahs as an integral part of
the British Empire. He was at the
first relief of Lucknow under Com-
mander Sir Colin Campbell. When
British rule had been fully restored
throughout India Captain Mylne
came to Queensland in the same
vessel that brought Governor Bowen
and R. G. W. Herbert, arriving in
the year 1857. He left India in
order to take possession of a cattle
station known as “Etonsville,” on
the Clarence River, in New South
Wales. This property belonged to


his brothers, who had come to New
South Wales 15 years earlier, and
settled at “Etonsville.” The brothers
paid a return visit to England, and
subsequently again took passage for
Australia by the “Dunbar,” the
MR. GRAHAM MYLNE.
wreck of which at the Gap, just
outside Sydney Heads, on the night
of August 21, 1857, was one of the
most tragic events in Australian
history. The death of his brothers
left Captain G. Mylne in the position
of sole heir to the family estates in
Australia. Afterwards he held
“Amby Downs,” in the Maranoa
district, in conjunction with the
Hon. R. G. W. Herbert and Mr.
John Bramstone. By the request of
Sir Arthur Palmer he was induced
to add public responsibilities to his
private cares. Pie contested and
triumphantly carried the seat for
Warrego in the local Parliament,
and was foremost in drafting and
carrying a new Land Act, a
measure that at the time was
regarded as a monument of legisla-
tive competence. His distinguished
military service and social status
marked him for vice-regal recogni-
tion, and therefore he was appointed
extra aide-de-camp to Governor Sir
George F. Bowen. Captain Mylne
sprang from an eminent Scottish
family, whose home estate in Perth-
shire was known as “Mylnefield.”
The family forebears held by royal
charter the original title of “Mas-
ter Masons to the Kings of Scot-
land,” a distinction that in the days
when the charter was issued was a
mark of high honour. Captain
Mylne died in 1876 at “Etonsville,”
New South Wales, at the early age
of 44, his son, Mr. Graham Ernest
Mylne, succeeding to the estate. He
was educated at Boyd’s Preparatory
School, in Brisbane, from which he
went to the Sydney Grammar School,
under the distinguished scholar, the
late A. B. Wiegall, whose name still
is revered by his old pupils. From
the Sydney Grammar School young
Mylne went to Hutchin’s School, in
Hobart, Tasmania, whence he gradu-
ated for entry to the Royal Military
College, Sandhurst, England. When
lie was nineteen years of age he
joined the famous Lincolns, a
regiment whose lustre remains un-
dimmed. After considerable service
and exjoerience with his regiment
he returned to his native land in
1893. He served first as lieutenant,
then as captain, with the New
South Wales Imperial Bushmen
throughout the whole period of the
Boer War. When peace was declared
CAPTAIN GRAHAM ERNEST MYLNE.
Captain Mylne returned once again
to Queensland and resumed pastoral
work. Eventually he became man-
aging partner of the partnership of
Collins, White, & Co., holders of
“Eulolo,” “Strathfield,” and “Glen
Ormiston” Stations, carrying both
cattle and sheep. His beautiful
home, “Lota," built by his grand-
father, the Hon. W. D. White, in
1856, stands in 11 acres of ground,
the area being portion of the original
400-acre property. Here the present
thriving seaside town of Manly was
formed, and also the adjoining village
known as Lota. In 1910 he married
Kathleen, daughter of the late Com-
mander Nicholls, R.N., the issue of
the union being two daughters and
one son.
“THE HOLMWOOD,” the pro-
perty of Mr. J. T. Turner. This well-
known station property originally
formed a portion of the large “Dur-
undur” cattle run taken up in the
early days by the Archer family,
from whom it was afterwards pur-
chased, in 1848, by the late Messrs.
David and John McConnel, who
worked it in conjunction with their
“Cressbrook” Station. In 1881 the
famous Hereford herd, for which the
station has since become so deserv-
edly noted, was founded by Mr.
A. J. McConnel, now of “Dugan-
dan.” In December, 1901, the
homestead, “Durundur,” together
with the fattening station, “Mount
Kilcoy,” and “Holmwood,” was re-
purchased by the Government, and
in the following year the whole area
was subdivided for closer settlement
and offered for sale. “The Holm-
wood" area after spirited bidding
was secured by Mr. Turner at about
LI,OOO above the upset price.
Since then the property has been
thoroughly reorganized and many
improvements effected. In the first
instance Mr. Turner divided the
area surrounding the home enclosures
into ten paddocks, varying in size
from 4 to 400 acres, and forthwith
started farming and cattle-breeding
operations on careful lines, continuing
to elaborate his scheme as increasing
prosperity rewarded his further
efforts. At the present time the
estate presents a park-like appear-
ance, the natural grasses being
augmented by the sowing of pas-
palum and Rhodes grass. The


indigenous timber—ironbark and
blue gum—has mostly been cleared,
and crops are cultivated, consisting
chiefly of fodder for the use of the
stock, including lucerne, hay, etc.,
and root crops of different kinds.
The stud paddock is well designed,
and among the outbuildings the
properly-appointed stabling and a
structure with cement flooring for
the washing of cattle attract special
attention. The estate is watered by
the Stanley River and Stoney Creek,
from which water is pumped for the
supply of the workmen’s cottages, the
stables, and for agricultural require-
ments, the homestead being served by
rainwater from large underground
and overhead tanks. The house is
lighted by means of a Quirk’s air-
gas plant, and a sewerage system is
installed. In January, 1911, Mr.
Turner purchased “Sebastopol,”
with its out-station "Kylmore,” a
property near Westwood, on the
Central Western railway line. This
tract of country he works in conjunc-
tion with "The Holmwood,” using
it as a depot in connection with his
cattle and horse-breeding enterprise.
Well grassed, with stony ridges, flats
of rich black soil, and patches of
brigalow, "Sebastopol” has proved
an ideal locality for stock-raising.
The watercourse known as Sandy
Creek flows through the property,
and half a dozen wells have been sunk
to depths of from 30 to 50 feet,
are a feature of the place, and
a dip is to be found both at "Sebas-
topol” homestead and at the out-
station. At the present time (1918)

MR. JAMES THOMAS TURNER.
this station carries some 200 head of
horses and 1,400 Hereford cattle—
a comparatively small number on
and success was a foregone conclusion
when he first directed his energies to
this branch of enterprise on his own
behalf. Being desirous to bring into
prominence the claims of Woodford
for railway facilities, he became a
strong advocate for the establish-
ment of a butter factory in the dis-
trict, and commenced the breeding
of a Hereford herd with a view to
strengthening his advocacy of this
scheme in the most emphatic man-
ner. In 1902 he purchased the
pure-bred bull, "Cynthius II.” (by
"Cynthius” (imp.), 324), from the
"Durundur” Estate, which he
mated with twelve stud Hereford
cows, secured from Mr. W. Loder, of
Singleton, N.S.W. "Cynthius II.”

3rd, 1904; 2nd, 1905; 3rd, 1906; let
1907; 3rd, 1908. Among the eminent
sires bred on "Holmwood” may be
mentioned "Sir Cynthius,” winner
of first prize, Brisbane, 1908, and of
several special prizes in that year;
3rd, Brisbane, 1909 and 1910; Ist
and champion, Rockhampton, 1910.
Other distinguished members of the
stud secured from other quarters in-
cluded the sire "Defiance” (now de-
funct), which won 3rd prize, Sydney,
1907; 2nd, Brisbane, 1907; Ist,
Brisbane, 1907, for sire and pro-
geny; Ist and champion, all breeds,

his mark in the herd. "Finstall,” bv

I rom "Avondale” he gets a lot of
blood of the great sire "Figaro,”


imported from England by the late
Mr. H. Beattie. For the purpose of
introducing new blood on the female
side, in 1914 Mr. Turner purchased
several heifers from Mr. S. Rey-
nolds, of “Duninald,” N.S.W. Two
special heifers included in this lot
were “Lady Permian,” 2 years, and
“Lily Permian,” 1 year, the last-
named being a full sister to “Royal
Permian,” sold for .£lBO at the Syd-
ney Show, 1914, at the age of 1 year
and 9 months. Others are by “Lord
Horace” (imp.), besides which Mr.
Turner has a heifer by “Cotmore,”
winner of a championship at the
Sydney Show, which he has named
“Cotmore Queen.” The “Holm-
wood” Herefords secured a well-
deserved popularity from the first,
and now find their way to all parts
of Queensland. Mr. Turner also gave
his attention to Jersey stock, but
desiring to launch out in yet another
direction— viz., the breeding of beef
cattle —and being hampered for
room, he sold most of the dairy cattle
in 1913, only a few stud-bred Jerseys
from imported stock being retained.
In August, 1912, he sold a draft of
32 stud Hereford cows and heifers
to Mr. J. P. Lawless, of “Windera,”
who saw them for the first time on
their arrival at his station. In a

letter to Mr. Turner, Mr. Lawless
stated that he was very pleased with
the cattle, but “liked the heifers
much better than the dams”—a very
fine tribute to the breeder. For
many years Mr. Turner cherished
the idea of pioneering the Sussex
breed of cattle in Queensland, as he
considers this would prove the ideal
type to suit Australian conditions,
and his intention was to visit Eng-
land to select stock of this particular
breed with which to inaugurate a
Sussex herd at “The Holmwood.”
The outbreak of the present Euro-
pean war, however, frustrated his
intention for the nonce, and in the
meantime he took the opportunity
of purchasing in 1915 two two-year-
old heifers and a yearling bull
from Mr. Campbell Newington, of
Oakover, Ticehurst, Sussex, England,
which he only secured at great ex-
pense. These animals—the bull
“Oakover Briar Bth” and the two
heifers, “Oakover Twin sth” and
"OAKOVER ROSALIND” (IMP.), BY "TUTSHAM TREADOR,” AGE 3½ YEARS, AND HER CALF,
“HOLMWOOD ROSALIND,” BY “IRONSIDE.”
“Oakover Rosalind”—were landed
at Brisbane at the end of June,
1915. With these Mr. Turner has
formed a nucleus for the establish-
ment of a small stud, and is now
awaiting his opportunity to import
fresh blood from the Old Country.
The newcomers have thriven well,
and the fact that during the first few
months after their arrival they actu-
ally put on flesh, although running in
comparatively bare paddocks, bears
out the statement that the Sussex
breed is noted for its hardiness and
indicates that the strain will do well
in Queensland. At the Smithfield
(Eng.) Fat Stock Show, 1915, the
first prize Sussex steer proved to be
the heaviest animal of all breeds
under two years. Although deeming
it a wise policy to introduce new
blood from time to time, Mr. Turner
gets the best results from sires of
his own breeding, and at present he
is using “Viceroy,” a grandson of
“Cynthius II.” While regarding
Herefords as a first-class beef breed,
he is of opinion that the Sussex will
prove as good, or even better, on
account of its hardy constitution,
which is evidenced by the rapidly-
growing popularity of the breed in
the South American States and in
Rhodesia, South Africa, a veritable
hotbed of insects and cattle diseases.
Some fine blood horses have been
bred by Mr. Turner, who owned and
used “Tall Darrell,” son of “Darra-
well,” winner of a Melbourne Cup,


for stud purposes. At the Brisbane
Show, 1905, with “Tall Darrell,” his
son ‘‘Darrawin,” and daughter
‘‘Chloe,” he carried off first prize
for sire and two of progeny. With
"LADY PERMIAN,” BY “PERMIAN” (IMP.).
“Darrawin” he easily secured pre-
rnier honours in a very strong class
of two-year-olds. “Darrawin” was
the sire of “Brisbane,” presented to
His Majesty King George V. by the
Denham Government. The arrival
of this magnificent horse in London
created something in the nature of a
sensation. A few good ponies are
also bred, and with “Pert,” a pony
mare, Mr. Turner has won a number
of championships. In Suffolks he
out of “Chloe,” by “Tall Darrell,”
is a splendid type of mare. Her
beautiful hunter type of colt foal,
by the young stallion “Wooroona,”
by “Badajos,” is, in Mr. Turner’s
estimation, the right type of colt to
breed. The principal sires in use at
the present time at “The Holm-
wood” and “Sebastopol” are “Bada-
jos” by “Patriot”—“Quatre Bras,”
and “Wooroona” by “Badajos” —
“Petticoat,” in the blood section,
and “Douglas” and “Bowstring”
(“Bowman”—“Smart”)in the Suffolk
Punch department. Mr. James
Thomas Turner is a son of Mr. John
Turner, being born at “Goddonwick”
recoi’ds of which can be traced back
to the very early days of history in
“Merrie England.” For generations
the ancestors of Mr. Turner success-
fully tilled the soil in their native
county, and became known through-
out England as breeders of high-
class cattle, particularly of the
Sussex strain. Mr. John Turner was
born at Balcombe, and left home
when quite a young man, having
determined to “paddle his own
canoe.” He was in London at the
time of the great riot (about 1850),
and was sworn in as a special con-
stable, experiencing a “lively” time
whilst executing his duties. After a
life of adventure, Mr. John Turner
settled down to yeoman life, taking
to wife Miss Amelia Smith Burbury,
a member of a very old family of
Ifield and Horsham, Sussex County.
He filled many public positions, and
for a lengthy period owned and ran
the Lindfield and Hayward Heath
Harrier Hounds, on the London,
Brighton, and South Coast line. Mr.
J. T. Turner received his education
at the Lindfield British School until
he was fourteen years of age, after-
wards assisting on his father’s farm,
where cattle-breeding, sheep and
horses, and general farming on an
extensive scale were carried on.
Mastering all the details of these
industries with surprising ease, he
became so expert in the business
that at seventeen years of age he

was considered competent to take
over the entire management, and
continued to direct operations with
considerable success until his father
gave up the property. Whilst engaged


in the work for which he had
shown such aptitude, his attention
was attracted by accounts of Britain’s
dominions beyond the seas, and
finally, at the age of twenty-one,
resolved to cross the ocean and
launch out on his own account in the
land of rosy promise. Mr. Turner,
with his elder brother John, left
England in the “Parramatta” in
December, 1886, and reached Bris-
bane on February 6, 1887. After
spending a few weeks in “getting his
bearings ’ in the new latitudes into
which he had steered his barque, Mr.
Turner decided that practical work
vas the shortest way towards the
independent position which was his
ultimate aim. Accordingly he took
a position as stockman on “Durun-
dur" Station, then owmed by Messrs.
McConnel and Wood, and comprising
an area of 70,000 acres, freehold.
Living at the homestead, he was for-
tunate in getting his first Australian
experience under favourable condi-
tions, and after becoming accustomed
to the handling of stock in true
Queensland style was given charge
of the fattening station, known as
"Mount Kilcoy.” This was in 1891,
and shortly afterwards he married,
and settling down at “Kilcoy,” con-
tinued there until August, 1894. In
the meantime the estates—-“Durun-
dur,” 1 Kilcoy,” and “Conandale”—
were taken over by the Bank of

Australasia, when Mr. Turner
received the appointment of stud-
mater at “The Holmwood,’’ where
the stud was considered one of the
finest in Australia. The marked
improvement which early manifested
itself in the already fine herd quickly
demonstrated his fitness satisfac-
torily to carry out the duties of the
important post he had accepted. His
exhibits became a feature of every
agricultural show, and were awarded
hundreds of trophies. Early in
1901, upon the retirement of the
general manager, Mr. Turner was
offered and accepted the control of
the whole estate, and after the
resumption of “The Holmwood,”
“Mount Kilcoy,” and “Durundur,”
in December of that year, he con-
tinued to manage affairs on behalf of
the bank, which retained the use of
the resumed portion until October,
1902. Whilst still retaining the
management of “Conandale” for the
Bank of Australasia, Mr. Turner

commenced the improvement of his
newly-acquired property, subse-
quently concentrating the whole of
his time and attention upon his own
interests. The public organizations
of the district claim his co-operation,
and he was appointed to the Com-
mission of the Peace in 1900, being
now senior Justice of the district.
He has seen a lengthy term of ser-
vice in the Caboolture Shire Council,
and for four years was president of
the Woodford Agricultural Show
Committee, besides which he is
called upon to act as adjudicator at
various shows throughout the
country districts. He was the first
in the district to run his own motor-
car, and when Lord Chelmsford
visited the locality, during his
regime of Governor, to Mr. Turner
fell the honour of escorting him to
the different points of interest in the
Blackall Ranges. Mrs. Turner is a
daughter of the late James McLen-
nan, of “Wooloowin,” formerly of
Scotland. There is a family of two
sons and two daughters.
“TAABTNGA” Station, the pro-
perty of Mr. Arthur Youngman,
is one of the oldest historical hold-
ings in the Kingaroy district, hav-
ing originally been taken up by Mr.
C. B. Haley, who held it for 25
years, when he sold out to Mr.
Thomas Alford. After a residence
of several years this gentleman in
turn disposed of the property to the
present owner, who entered upon the
personal management of its opera-
tions in December, 1887. The ori-
ginal owner of “Taabinga” started
it as a sheep run, and its wool com-
manded a high reputation for many


years. As time went on, however,
cattle gradually replaced the sheep,
until at length it came to be
regarded solely as a cattle property,
achieving a name for its fine
“TAABINGA” HOMESTEAD.
shorthorn herd. From the inception
of the present ownership in 1887 every
effort was made to maintain and im-
prove the high standard of the exist-
ing herd by the use of the best bulls
obtainable in this State or New
South Wales. Further, by ring-
barking the heavily-timbered ridges
and flats not only were the grasses
made denser and sweeter, but the
creeks and water-courses had their
supplies of water immensely in-
creased. It thus became possible to
subdivide the property into reason-
able-sized paddocks, and con-
sequently the carrying and fattening
capacities of the land were enor-
mously improved. Under such
improved conditions the shorthorn
herd was steadily improved, until it
won a high reputation for its stock
on account of their size, quality, and
density of flesh. In addition to the
station herd, from which drafts of
bullocks and cows were sold annually
as fats, a large number of store
cattle was also fattened, the yearly
turnover for a long period averaging
between 4,000 and 5,000 head.
After the experiences of the 1901-2
drought an interesting development
in the herd was the introduction of
pedigreed red Norfolk polled bulls,
and the result of this change of
breed on the shorthorn cows was
most marked, their progeny being
noted for early maturity and robust
constitution. “Taabinga” has al-
ways been famed for its horses, but
never to such a degree as in its early
history, when it was owned by the
Messrs. Haley Brothers, who im-
ported some of the finest Arab and
English thoroughbred sires ever in-
troduced into Queensland, the names
of such stallions as “Beeza” and
“Thomanby” being well known to
all lovers of horseflesh in the State
in the years gone by. With its rich
natural grasses, wonderfully shel-
tered position, and fertile soil,
“Taabinga” has proved itself a first-
class cattle property, and now,
under conditions of closer settlement,
is establishing a reputation that for
the size of the estate is second to
none in the State for agricultural
and dairying purposes. Maize is the
staple product of the land, and the
climate and soil unite to make this
one of the best maize districts in
Australia, in proof of which it may
be pointed out that in six months
from the first stroke of the axe
virgin scrub soil will produce a
flourishing crop of this cereal. Since
Mr. Youngman’s first advent to
“Taabinga” the district has wit-
nessed many radical changes, among
which the most important has been
the subdivision of the larger hold-
ings in the vicinity into farm areas
of limited dimensions, and it is a
convincing testimony to the splendid
qualities of the soil and climate that
although at the time of his arrival
the whole population might be
counted on the fingers, at the pre-
sent date it has become one of the
most closely-settled areas in Aus-
tralia. An interesting feature in the
development of the property under
notice has been the introduction and
establishment of artificial grasses on
both scrub and forest soils. Rhodes
and paspalum are the two most
popular summer grasses, Rhodes es-
pecially having proved a wonderful

success, and by the use of these
grasses the grazing and consequently
the dairying capacity of the land has
been increased, as much as from 400
to 500 per cent.


JAMES ISAAC MARKWELL,
“Archookoora,” Kingaroy, was born
on April 19, 1843, and is a son of
the late Isaac Markwell, who came
to Moreton Bay with his family in
1849. At the outset of his career in
the land of the Southern Cross the
late Isaac Markwell had in his pos-
session a capital of a few hundred
pounds, and this he invested in a
farm at Bulimba, near Brisbane.
Messrs. D. C. McConnel, W. Barlow,
and Kilner were purchasers of farms
adjoining Mr. Markwell’s holding,
and all became fellow-sufferers in the
non-success of their respective pro-
positions. After three or four years
of disappointing experiences, Mr.
Isaac Markwell relinquished his
undertaking, and in conjunction
with his brother initiated a general
storekeeping business at Bulimba,
which at a later period attained a
considerable reputation as “Grimes
and Petty’s.” Ten years later Mrs.
Isaac Markwell’s death occurred, and
from that date Mr. Markwell ceased
to take any active interest in the
business. The subject of this notice
was six years of age upon his arrival
at Moreton Bay, and subsequently he
attended school for about two years.
He then passed to another institu-
tion conducted by Mr. Lines in the
old School of Arts, concluding his
scholastic career at a school presided
over by Mr. Carvosso, father of the
present Dr. Carvosso, of Brisbane.
L T pon the termination of his studies
Mr. Markwell commenced farming at
Bulimba, where he continued for six
years. About this time, awaking to
the fact that rent was absorbing an
undue proportion of his profits, he
purchased a small block of land on
the Logan River, under the terms of
the first Land Act passed in the
colony, and proceeded upon the de-
velopment of this holding. Mr. Mark-
well made this departure just about
the period of the financial crisis of
1864, when sensational occurrences
took place in Brisbane. The troubles
which arose naturally militated
against the transaction of any
payable business, whether in the
direction of stock-raising or in any
ether avenue of trade, and various
projects were considered for once
more bringing about a state of
prosperity in the colony. Among
ether suggestions the idea of sugar-
growing was mooted, and cotton
planting was also tried, the latter,
however, never proving a positive
success, although it was persevered
with for some years under the
stimulus of a Government bonus.
Sugar, on the other hand, proved a
payable crop, and Mr. Markwell
planted some few acres of cane on
his newly-acquired property, which
was sent for crushing to the Logan
Home Mill, one of the first mills
built in Queensland, The balance of
his land was utilized for grazing
purposes, and eventually he directed
his attention to the formation of a
herd of shorthorn cattle, which
afterwards was transferred to a
property on the Upper Logan. This
was a venture to which he was in-
cited by his father, who suggested
the forming of a partnership, con-
sisting of himself, the gentleman
under review, and a younger son,
and was inaugurated on a much
more important scale than any in-
vestment previously made by any

member of the family, with the re-
sult that the herd rapidly increased
to nearly a thousand head. In 1879,
after nearly eight years, the earlier
block of land (called “Ingleby” by
Mr. Markwell, but now known as
“Cedar Grove”) was sold and the
partnership dissolved. Mr. James
Isaac Markwell and his two brothers
then started on a tour of explora-
tion, with the object of discovering
suitable grazing land, and continued
this quest for three months before
their efforts were crowned with suc-
cess. At length, however, they were
successful in securing the two fine
blocks of land in the Burnett dis-
trict, which have since become
known as “Kingaroy” and “Brook-
lands.” Both properties were used
for the fattening of stock for the
markets, and so well handled were
the cattle that they became known
on the Brisbane markets as the
“spoon-feds.” After seven or eight
years’ tenure of the properties men-
tioned, Mr. Markwell purchased the
interest of one of his brothers in
“Kingaroy,” while at the same time
the other brother secured a half-
share in “Brooklands,” by which
arrangement Messrs. James and
Charles Markwell became owners of
an equal share in both properties
and continued to carry on the in-
dustry conjointly for five years, when
the partnership was dissolved, Mr.
James Markwell becoming sole pro-
prietor of the holdings. He now
began to look farther afield for
investments, and being advised of
the sale of “Eddyston Yale” Sta-
tion, on the Maranoa River, he
visited the run and decided to pur-
chase, with the intention of working
it in conjunction with “Brooklands”
and “Archookoora,” another fine
block of country which he had pur-
chased in the interval, and upon
which he now resides. “Eddyston
Yale” was bought by him at a stock
valuation of £1 per head, but owing
to the distance intervening between
this and the other properties, and
the low prices ruling, the venture
was not a success. Mr. Markwell,
after having persevered at “Eddyston
Vale” for four years without making
any headway, sold out minus any
profit on the transaction. In the fol-
lowing year good rains fell and pros-
pects improved, and taking advantage
of this brighter aspect of affairs he
disposed of “Brooklands.” Mr.
Markwell also owns a block of land
on the Condamine, and until recently
was the possessor of a property called
“Ormond,” at the head of the Bur-
nett River, which he disposed of
on account of the departure of two
of his sons for the war, leaving
no member of the family free to
undertake the management of this
estate. Mr. Markwell married in
1886 Adelaide Eliza, daughter of
Mr. George Comfort, of Melbourne,
and has three sons and one daugh-
ter. His eldest son, Aubrey, was
enrolled as a volunteer in the A.I.F.
in October, 1916, and the second,
Reginald, went into camp at Enog-
gera in March, 1916. It is interest-
ing to note that no fewer than 18
members of the Markwell connection
in the Old Country have enlisted
and are now on active service.

son of the late William Field Butler,
who sprang from a family which
for several generations past has been
than the forbears of Mr. William
Butler, whose career under the
Southern Cross forms the subject of
this article. Going back to the reign
of Henry VIII., the Butler family
claims kinship with the Ormond But-
lers, who for many generations have
been remarkable for their adherence
to the principles of civil and religious
liberty, and Mr. Butler also traced
his line of ancestry direct from the
great Reformer, Oliver Cromwell,
his great-great-grandmother on the
maternal side being Ann Cromwell,
the great-granddaughter of the Pro-
tector. In 1757 the great-grand-
father of Mr. Butler founded a wool-
stapling business at Royston, and
subsequently his son, John, married
in 1772 Miss Elizabeth Field, of
Cockerhoe, a granddaughter of Ann
Cromwell, above-mentioned, by
whom he had issue nine children,
of whom the late William Field
Butler was one. Mr. William Butler
received his education at Denmark
Hill, Camberwell, London, and con-
tinued his studies at this institution
until 16 years of age. Upon leaving
school he was offered by his father
the best advantages possible for ob-
taining a sound training in the farm-
ing industry, a premium of £lOO a
and methods of practical farming,
Mr. Butler felt competent to under-
take a position of some responsibility

ships engaged in trading with Aus-
tralia, and arrived in Sydney at a
period before Queensland was de-
clared a separate colony, the date of
his arrival being February, 1854.
During the long voyage of five
months, with his fellow-passengers—
about 30 in number—Mr. Butler in-
dulged in much building of castles
in the air respecting his future in
the new colony, which was regarded
by them all as a veritable “land of
promise.” His letters of introduc-
tion from the homeland included
one to Mr. Holt, then the leading
• * * i ®
spirit in the pastoral and wool in-
dustry of Australia, and from him
he received his choice of a position
on a station, either as jackaroo, to
learn the industry in an easy, if not
always thorough, fashion, without
pay, or to begin on the lowest rung
of the ladder with the men in the
hut, who gained a wide knowledge
by dint of hard work under strenu-
ous conditions, and varied, often
bitter, experiences. From such, it
may be remarked, frequently have
sprung those who have made their
mark in the building up of the pas-
toral enterprise in the pioneer stage
of a country's history, and there
have been in Australia very many
wealthy pastoralists who acknow-
ledge with pride that by their un-
aided efforts they have built up the
fabric of their fortunes and gathered
every detail of their business by
practical experience in earlier days.
The latter position of the two offered
—that of rouseabout, with its allow-
ance of £7O per annum, which
seemed a considerable sum to the
alert and handy “new chum”—was
chosen, and Mr. Butler began
his initiation into the handling
and management of stock on
“Ramies” Station, near Port Cur-
tis, where he remained for over two
years. With the energy and earnest-
ness which were his prominent
characteristics, he applied himself to
(he work in hand, and scon became
so proficient in the various branches
of station activity that before very
long he was promoted to the duties
of sheep overseer, with an increase
in salary. Towards the close of 1856,
refusing the management of “Ba-
nana” Station, he proceeded south
and spent a short holiday in Sydney.
Subsequently he took a position as
second in charge on a droving trip,
which involved the overlanding of a
mob of sheep from Moreton Bay to
Melbourne, at a time when the gold
fever, promoted by the rich dis-
coveries of the precious metal in
Victoria, was rampant in all centres
of population in Australia. The
temptation of being within the
charmed radius overcame the adven-
turous spirit from the north, whom all
the comforts of home and advantages
of civilization had not sufficed to keep
in his native haunts, and the only
matter for wonder would have been

During this time he took the risks of
the game like the man he afterwards
proved himself to be, still keeping a
smiling face whether rejoicing in a
stroke of good luck or down to his
last shilling. Finally, be decided to
return to the life which he felt was
more suited to him, and for which
he had fitted himself in earlier days,
augmenting the knowledge gained in
the old land by further experience
in larger spheres in the land of his
adoption. In reference to his career
on this side of the equator, an
towards the close of the year 1861 he
was appointed manager of “Cress-
brook” Station. This position be
held for some considerable time, at a
later date accepting the post of
manager of “Durundur” Station,
then the property of Mr. McConnel’s
brother John. In 1867 he accepted
a commission from the Honourable
Louis Hope to proceed to the Comet
district to take the supervision of
“Albinia Downs” Station, near Rol-
leston, where he spent two years.
Resigning this position, he came
nearer the coast and assumed the
management of “Barambah” Sta-
tion, on behalf of the Bank of New
in which he resided up to the time
of his death on June 6, 1917. Whilst
still engaged in the management of
his station, acting on the advice of
the Hon. Louis Hope, he took up a
block of land at Royston—a portion
of the “Durundur” run—and made
considerable progress in the de-
velopment of this holding even
before the “ Kilcoy ” property
came into his hands. Less than
a decade ago he disposed of
“Royston” to purchase “Targinnie”
Station, some 10 or 12 miles distant
from Gladstone, and placed this pro-
perty under the management of his
third surviving son, Frank Wells

interesting record is to be found in
a volume published in London by
Hurst & Blackwell in 1901, entitled
“Pages from the Journal of a
Queensland Squatter,” by Oscar De
Satge, where reference is made to
Mr. Butler as engaged in the late
fifties on an important overlanding
trip, extending from the Darling
Downs to the Campaspe, in Victoria,
on behalf of Dr. Rowe, a well-known
pastoralist of the early days, this
being the second trip made by Mr.
Butler. In 1860 Mr. Butler again
came into touch with the late D. C.
McConnel, who offered him employ-
ment of a general nature, and
South Wales, under the direction of
the late Alexander Archer—after-
wards drowned in the wreck of the
“Quetta”—who will be well remem-
bered by old pastoral pioneers as a
just and humane financier and “a
friend in need” to many. When
‘ Barambah” was sold Mr. Butler
transferred his services to “Kilcoy”

late Honourable Louis Hope, and
conducted the management of this
station successfully for 36 years,

the far-off days of early pioneering
enterprise in Australia, sailed from
Liverpool by the ship “Emigrant”
in the month of May, 1852, and
arrived in Melbourne a few months
later. The fever of excitement
created by the discovery of important
Dorado in the southern hemisphere.
Upon arrival in the land of the
Southern Cross the late James Moore
at once proceeded to Bendigo, where
about 12 months of a gold-digger’s
life proved sufficient to disillusion
him with regard to the prospects of
making a sensational fortune by
means of spade or pan. At the end
of that period, therefore, he applied
his patrimony to establishing a wine
and spirit business on the field,
which he also made a depot for the
supply of manifold general necessi-
ties of the miner. In this enterprise
he was joined in partnership by his
two brothers, Messrs. John and
William Moore, and the late Robert
Dunn, and together the quartette
ministered to the requirements of
the rough-and-ready toilers for the
illusive red metal at Bendigo until,
about a year later, they perceived a
better opening on the field of Bal-
larat, then rapidly coming into
prominence, and accordingly removed
to that centre. Here they continued
their successful trading operations
for about seven years, when the
partnership was dissolved by mutual
consent. The Moore brothers, hav-
ing been attracted by the then new
colony of Queensland, set their faces
northward, and settling in the
Maranoa district, founded three
stations, including ‘‘Foyleview” and
“Teeswater,” adjoining each other.

time after the death of James Moore
his widow married his younger bro-
ther, John, and with the three


children continued to live at
“Moorelands.” In the year 1883
Messrs. John and William Moore
purchased “Colinton” Station, then
one of the largest and most import-
ant pastoral properties in the Bris-
bane Valley, for which they dis-
bursed a sum amounting to consider-
ably over .£BO,OOO. Upon the com-
pletion of the purchase the family
came to reside on the newly-acquired
estate, which was administered by
the late John Moore, who prior
to his death decided to subdivide
its 44,000 acres for purposes of
closer settlement. Before the time
appointed for the sale, however, he
joined the great majority, and in
1903 the estate was cut up and sold,
the homestead and some 1,400 or
1,500 acres of the surrounding land
falling to the bid of Mr. T. H.
Moore, the present owner. In addi-
tion, he secured another block of
over 3,600 acres of the same estate,
situated some six miles distant from
the homestead, which has since been
utilized by Mr. Moore as a grazing
and mixed-farming proposition. The
original “Colinton,” which takes its
name from a place in Scotland, was
first taken up by a Scotchman, a
Mr. Forbes, in the late thirties, and
is thus one of the oldest-established
properties in Queensland, which had
yet 20 years to run ere her right to
independent government was ac-
knowledged by the home authorities.
From this ownership it passed into
the hands of a Mr. Raff, from whom
it was purchased by the Messrs.

and is the second son of the late
James Moore. He received his edu-
cation at a private school in Bris-
bane, subsequently attending the
Brisbane Grammar School, which he
left to complete his scholastic career
at Eton College, Sydney, under the
headmastership of that well-known
preceptor, Dr. Sly, now practising
at the New South Wales Bar. At
the termination of his course in this
felt would prove useful to him in the
serious business of life. In 1893 he
returned to "Colinton,” where he was
able shortly afterwards to assume the
responsibilities of management, and
continued to control affairs for the
firm until the sale of the property in
the above-mentioned year, when he
bought in the portion he now owns,
as already written. Since that date
he has conducted operations on his
own account with satisfactory re-
sults, his affairs having prospered in
a way that reflects much credit upon
the guiding genius at the helm.
“Colinton” Station is situated on
100 miles. The property is inter-
sected by the Brisbane Valley rail-
way line, and a railway station,
about one and a half miles from the
homestead, is one of the conveni-
ences of its excellent situation. Both
of the blocks of country owned by
Mr. Moore are served by the Bris-
bane Waters, "Top Happy,” the
second holding, having its situation
on Happy Creek, one of the numer-
ous tributaries of the larger river.
Besides the permanent water supply
with which both estates are favoured
from natural sources, dams have
been constructed to remove the re-
motest chance of a scarcity of this
essential factor in a flourishing stock
proposition. The properties are
highly improved in other directions,
dips, fencing, and other necessary
developmental work being all of
up-to-date design. The country is
mostly undulating in character,
though flats of great richness occur
frequently, whereon is generally
found an abundant growth of gum;
other timbers indigenous to the
locality being the silver ironbark
and wild apple. A commodious,
comfortable, up-to-date, and attrac-
tive bungalow residence forms the
dwelling-place of Mr. Moore and his
family, this having been erected in

which was destroyed by fire early in
that year. The home is most

itself to indicate that the gentleman

Buchanan’s immediate ancestor de-

birth for a land whose sunny spaces
were vaunted by returned travellers
as fit breeding-ground for a virile
race of Anglo-Australians, it was
with the idea of building up a home
and fortune for those who should
come after him and carry on the
good old name under new conditions
of life. The sturdy pioneering Scot,
upon arrival in Queensland,
straightway proceeded northwards
to Bowen, where he became engaged
in the delivery of merchandise from
the wharves to the town. He found
abundant scope for his energies in
this and other work of a similar
character, and on one occasion was
numbered among the earliest party
to take a wheeled conveyance to the
Cape River diggings at the outbreak
of that well-known goldfield, being
commissioned to convey a number of
diggers who had arrived at Bowen
with their swags over the 200 miles
of dreary track which intervened

far-distant parts of the country to
this remote spot, he found it advis-
able to transfer his headquarters to
Townsville, which, becoming the
port for Cape River, rose rapidly to
a position of some importance, and
thenceforward for a considerable
period continued the work of carting
supplies, etc., for the diggers to and
from the goldfield. In 1868-9, with
his young son, the subject of this
notice, he extended his trips with
horse teams out west through
Lammermoor and Hughenden as far
as “The Dead Finish,” a name
which has now become a very misty
recollection even in the memories of
the older of the surviving pioneers
of that district. In this trip he was
accompanied by the late Edward
Palmer, known all over North
Queensland in the early days as
“Overland Ned,” on account of his
connection with the relief expedition
led by McKinlay, which, leaving
Cooper Creek, travelled to the Gulf
of Carpentaria in an endeavour to
discover traces of the ill-fated ex-
plorers, Burke and Wills. The
advent of middle-age brought the
late David Buchanan to the decision
to discontinue the somewhat rough
life of the roads, and disposing of
his carrying plant he turned his
attention to hotel-keeping, assuming
the role, of Mine Host of a hostelry

of new mining discoveries, he relin-
quished operations at this centre and
established himself in a hotel on the
Kirk diggings, which he conducted
for some considerable time, return-
ing to Ravenswood when the rush to
this field declined. Here he secured
the licence of another hotel, which he
conducted up to the time of his death.

before in this article, in conjunction
with the late George Homersham,
with whom Mr. Buchanan formed a
partnership, which existed until the
time of Mr. Homersham’s demise.
Being of a comparatively small area,
“Blair Athol” failed to satisfy the
ambition of the young pastoralist,
and having successfully carried on
sale disposed of all the stock on the
station. The new firm, upon assum-
ing control of the property, at once
removed all the cattle and horses
from “Blair Athol” to restock the
“Longton” pastures, the latter pro-
perty being far superior to their
earlier run, which shortly afterwards
passed into other hands. As’ a re-
suit of the energy and ability
brought to bear upon their opera-
tions by Messrs. Buchanan and
Homersham success after success re-
warded their efforts, and the trials

lie removed to Esk, where he pur-
chased his present residential pro-
perty, comprising over 700 acres, and
has since lived in partial retirement
in this pleasant spot, his eldest son
remaining on the station to take over
the reins of management. The
“Longton” Estate consists of good
grazing country, well provided for
in the matter of water supply by
wells and dams, which augment the
natural provision afforded by the
Cape River, where some good per-
manent waterholes are found. The
character of the land is fairly level,
and a variety of timber, indigenous
to the district, prevails—ironbark,
bloodwood, gidgea, brigalow, and
various smaller trees, all of which
yield building material suitable for
station uses, flourishing in different
parts of the run. The grasses
native to the locality are abundant
and nutritious, and the paddocks of
“Longton” show a generous growth,
affording excellent pasturage for a
large number of stock. The progres-
sive spirit of the owners is strikingly
indicated by the many improvements
which have been introduced. Over
the deepest well on the property a
windmill rears its head towards the
open sky, at another the pumping is
performed by an oil engine, while
steam power is also used for a num-
ber of purposes. The adoption of
these modern appliances has called
forth the approbation of neighbour-
ing pastoralists, and it is generally
operations until 1904 with Mr.
Homersham he purchased “Long-
ton” Station from its previous pro-
prietary, the Scottish Australian In-
vestment Company, who prior to the

days of the venture in a very short
time became a thing of the past.
Mr. Buchanan resided on the station
with his family, retaining the control
conceded that “Longton” is the best
fitted run in the district. The sta-
tion is used principallv for cattle
grazing, the shorthorn strain pre-
dominating, and the “Longton”


beef cattle have won a very good
reputation. The stock is driven to
Pentland Siding, on the Northern
Railway Line, a distance of some
50 miles from “Longton,” and
thence railed to Townsville, 140
miles further on, where they are sold
to the Townsville Meat Works.
“Koburra,” the auxiliary property
owned by the firm, was first taken
up by Mr. Buchanan and his partner
with “Blair Athol,” in 1867, and
when the latter run was disposed of

Government to be used as a grazing

ago, when the history of Australia
was still an unwritten page. The
O’Mara family can claim descent
from one of Ireland’s oldest clans,
and traces its line on the paternal
side back to the days, many cen-
turies ago, when the name was first
woven into the shadowy legends of
the Emerald Isle. By a coincidence
Mrs. John O’Mara’s maiden name
was the same as that of her husband,
and although for centuries there had
been no connection between the two
families, her progenitors, with those
of John O’Mara, are known to have
been large landed proprietors, own-
ing the major portion of County
Tipperary over 400 years ago. Mr.
Patrick O’Mara, after his arrival in
Australia, administered large tracts
of grazing country in the Kiama
district of New South Wales, and
was well known among the members
of the pastoral community of the
day. Of his family of nine children,
six were sons, and these and their
descendants for the most part have
trodden in the footsteps of their
forebear on Australian soil, many of
them at the present time being en-
gaged in the primary industries “on
the land” in New South Wales. Mr.
O’Mara’s father, John O’Mara,
joined the great majority when he
was still comparatively a young
man, being only 50 years of age.
For some years prior to his decease
he had relinquished contracting, and
when his death occurred was occu-
pied in grazing interests at Cooma.
The fortunes of the family of which
the gentleman under review is a
member, however, principally were
laid by his maternal grandfather,
Mr. Timothy O’Mara, who in days
almost prehistoric, so far as the
white man’s occupation of Australia
is concerned, owned the pastoral
properties of “Mount Pleasant,”
near Dalgety; “Ironmongie,” in the
same district ; and “Kyban,” near
Ninetybell, which in course of time
descended to his children and grand-
children, and are still in the family,
in the original division “Iron-
mongie” falling to the lot of Mr.
E. J. O’Mara and his mother. There
is a story current concerning a f ormer
owner of the latter estate, which, as
representing the spirit of the time
in some sections of life in Australia,
is worth quoting. It is related that
on one occasion this individual took
some 800 cattle from the station
to Sydney, and having sold them at
£5 per head, spent the whole of the
profits that he made by the trans-
action during the following six
weeks in so-called “good-fellowship”
and “devil-may-care” living, having
to borrow half-a-crown at the end
of that period to supply his imme-
diate wants. When Mr. Edward J.
O’Mara was 10 years of age he went
to live at “Ironmongie,” and here
he received his primary education,
shortly after entering his teens

three years later, when the
decease of his mother made it neces-

administration of the family estate,

that year was the signal for further

changes, and the estate was sold to
another branch of the family,
Mr. O’Mara subsequently coming
to Queensland. From boyhood it
had been his dream to be free to


throw in his lot in the sub-tropical
country, where growth was phenom-
enally rapid and fortunes could be
made—and lost—in an incredibly
short time, and finding himself free
at length from the responsibilities
which had met him on the very
threshold of life, he decided to give
rein to his desire, and set forth
on a tour of inspection. Only
three months later he tcok pos-
session of his present homestead,
having been fortunate enough to
secure as a financial partner Mr.
Henry O’Mara, the well-known Jer-
sey breeder, and owner of “Banga-
low” Station, who is his uncle on
his mother’s side. This arrangement
continued until the early part of
1917, when the partnership was dis-
solved by mutual consent. “Cleeve”
Station originally formed a portion
of the old “Wellshot” run, which
historic property once held the dis-
tinction of being the largest sheep
run in Australia, and was capable
of grazing a flock of over a quarter
of a million on its extensive pastures.
The land policies brought in by
Governments of later days, however,
ordained the reduction of these big
station monopolies, and the area of
“Wellshot” has shrunk considerably,
despite which fact, as a result of
extensive improvements, the carrying
capacity of the station is still a
quarter of a million. That por-
tion of the station now known as
“Cleeve” attracted the special atten-
tion of the State authorities bent
upon closer settlement arrangements
on account of its rich soil and
generally valuable qualities for till-
age farms, and accordingly it was cut
up into numerous 300-acre blocks
for agricultural purposes. Eventu-
ally the country was proved to be
more suitable for grazing on account
of its geographical position, and by
degrees the various blocks were ac-
quired under one ownership, and the
“Cleeve” property thus was formed,
comprising about 26,000 acres of
some of the finest land in the dis-
trict. The excellent character of the
soil is sufficiently demonstrated by
the fact that its carrying capacity
is a slxeep to an acre and a half, but
since taking over the control Mr.
O’Mara has been so successful in
improving the land that a larger

abundant sustenance on the well-
grassed areas which distinguish the
station. “Cleeve” is situated some
7 miles distant from Longreach, and
possesses a very comfortable home-
stead, which was erected by the
late Dr. Hewer, from whom the pro-
perty was purchased by Mr. Robert
Telford, the predecessor of the pre-
sent proprietor. From the first it
has been used as a sheep proposition,

resulted in bringing the flock well
up to the standard for the district

industries being catered for by the
gentleman under review. The class
of country mainly found on
“Cleeve” partakes of the character
of open downs, well clothed with
timber, which besides providing
good shelter for the stock, is found
very suitable for general utility
purposes. Coolibah and boree are
predominant among the trees,

which he specially excelled. Since
coming to Queensland he has cordi-
ally identified himself with the
various movements for the promo-
tion of manly outdoor recreation in
the district where he resides, and
is recognized as one of the foremost
spirits in this particular direction,
He married in 1907 Alice, daughter
of the late James Curtis, a native
of Ireland, who came to Australia
and settled at Milton, New South
Wales, eventually becoming well
known as one of those useful
pioneers of the Mother State, whose
ravages of the disastrous drought of
1914-15 reduced the sheep to a
third of their original number, yet
so wonderful was the recovery made
by the flock that by April, 1917, the
tally of five figures was once more
reached. This satisfactory result was
only accomplished by means of care-
ful manipulation of the resources at
command, and Mr. O’Mara has
proved himself master of the situa-
tion by his expert control of both
the flock and the property, and by
his power of adaptation in difficult
straits. From year to year he gives
close attention to the improvement

efficiently carried out, and fences,

which fostered in him that love of

expedition of 15 men, under
the leadership of Robert O’Hara
Burke, with G. J. Landells and
W. J. Wills as second and third
in command, left Melbourne to take
part in the exploration of Northern
Australia, which was then occupying
a good deal of public attention.
Arriving at Cooper Creek, a depot
store was formed there, and Burke,
Wills, and two others set out for the
Gulf of Carpentaria. They followed
the edge of the Stony Desert to the
point reached by Sturt, on October
21, 1845, and then steered for the
Gulf at the mouth of the Flinders
River. After passing through the
Cloncurry Ranges, they followed a
tributary of the river of that name,
which must have been either the
Corella or the Dugald, and on Feb-
ruary 11, 1861, Burke and Wills
reached tidal water in the Gulf. The
melancholy story of their return
journey and tragic end is well
known. Subsequently various expe-
ditions were formed to search for the
missing explorers, and among these
was one led by John McKinlay,
which passed throught Sturt Desert
to the Cloncurrv district and on-
wards to the Gulf, in the course of
their travels visiting the exact
locality afterwards taken up by the
late Edward Palmer for pastoral
purposes, and named by him “Cono-
bie.” About three years after
McKinlay’s expedition, Edward Pal-
mer left the Burnett River with
sheep, and eventually arrived at the
10-mile waterhole, now known as the
Stanley Waterhole, on May 24,
1864. Here he formed his station—
now called “Conobie” on the west-
ern bank of the Cloncurry River,
situated about midway between Nor-
manton and Cloncurry, being 95
miles due north of the latter town,
from which it is reached by a fairly
good road. Mr. Palmer stocked the
run with sheep, but subsequently,
like most of the Gulf squatters, he
substituted cattle for the flocks, and,
by the year 1893, had a magnificent
herd. In conjunction with his part-
ner, Stevenson, he held a big area of
land under the liberal provisions of
the Pastoral Leases Act of 1869,
and portions of this after a time,
being forfeited to the Crown, were
thrown open under what was called
“Occupation Licence,” consisting of
a lease, renewable yearly. In 1897
Mr. R. E. R. Ilillcoat secured the
lease of that portion of the run
known as “Boomarra,” and held it
under the terms of the Act for
several years, but upon the passing
of the 1910 Act, under which the
Government is able to resume a por-
tion of the property once in every
10 years, the rental being appraised
by a Board, he acquired a 42 years’
lease of the property. The area of
“Boomarra” at the time of writing
is 375 square miles of open downs,

blue-grass, and in good seasons there
is an abundance of herbage of all
kinds, including pea-bush. Good
water is obtained from Dismal
Creek, which twists and turns
through the property, providing a
single frontage of 25 miles. Though
not a permanent stream, this creek
contains a number of deep water-
holes, in which good water may be
procured during eight or nine
months of the year. Eight wells
have been sunk to a depth of from


30 to 50 feet, and of these five have
been fitted with windmills for pump-
ing purposes, horse-gear being used
in connection with the remainder.
Huge tanks, of from 25,000 to
35,000 gallons’ capacity, have been
installed at the wells, and up-to-date
troughing arrangements complete an
excellent water service, by means of
which the stock are kept continually
supplied. The Gulf country, having
experienced no drought during the
past 35 years, on many occasions has
been able to afford relief to cattle
and horses from Central and South-
ern Queensland at such times when
conditions in those portions of the
State were the reverse of satisfac-
tory. The rainfall is fairly reliable,
the average from 1897 to 1915 being
21T7 inches, and it is interesting to
note that the highest fall over 19
years was 3,851 points, and the low-
est 1,260 points, while an event
worthy of record was a fall in 1915
of 16 inches in a single day.
“Boomarra” is securely fenced on
the boundary with timber posts and
two strands of barbed wire, and is
subdivided into 10 paddocks, in
addition to the smaller home
enclosures. The homestead contains
10 rooms, and there are besides the
usual storerooms, men’s quarters,
cart sheds, etc., all the appurten-
ances necessary to the carrying on of
a successful cattle station being
found in due order. The shorthorn
strain is predominant at “Boo-
marra,” and there are on the pro-
perty about 8,000 cattle, which are
sent to Townsville and to the various
northern meat works, and some
250 horses of mixed types. The

William Hillcoat, son of the late
Rev. Henry Brougham Hillcoat
D.D., of Bath, was born at that
famous watering-place, and left
England with his wife in November,


1851, arriving at Port Adelaide,
South Australia, on February 1,
1852. Whilst waiting to get over
the bar at the mouth of the river
he made the acquaintance of Mr.
Alex. F. T. Grant, and arranged to
go on to his station, “Tyeka,” about
eight miles from Gawler, where he
remained for some little time. Later
he took a 12-months’ lease of “Tena-
fete,” in the Hundred of Para
Wirra, County of Adelaide, having
the use of 250 acres, owned by Mr.
Grant: but of this he was unable to
make a success, and in the early
part of 1854 commenced dealing in
cattle and sheep. In 1856, in part-
nership with Major Warburton, he
purchased a station on Yorke Penin-
sula, at the figure of £23,000, and
carried on this property, trading

largely in cattle, sheep, and horses,
until October 1 of the same year.
His operations here, also, however,
were barren of good results, and
shortly after the latter date he came
to South Maitland, New South
Wales, where he remained until the
rush to the Gympie Goldfield
occurred. Joining the throng of
goldseekers, upon arrival on the field
he erected a stamper battery on
behalf of a Sydney business firm,
and received the appointment of
manager, which he held for about
12 months. The mill was then
removed to the “Black Snake” Mine,
near Kilkivan, and here he con-
tinued as manager until this mine
closed down, when he took up two
selections of land at Ashley and
Wodonga respectively, and entered
upon fanning pursuits. Eventually
the late Mr. Ilillcoat returned to
Sydney, where he died on Febru-
ary 17, 1907. His wife, whom he
married in England on August 26,
1851, was Miss Katharine Ellen
Mant, daughter of an eminent
solicitor practising at Bath, and the
family consisted of four daughters
and five sons, all of whom still
survive, with the exception of
the eldest daughter, whose death
occurred at Sydney in the year
1907. Mr. Reginald Edward Rowe
Hillcoat was born at Maitland, New
South Wales, on November 19,
1860, and received his education
chiefly under the tuition of his
father. He accompanied his family
upon their removal to Gympie, and
after a time took a position as
jackaroo on “Giggomgam” Station,
where he obtained a valuable

were sent to South Australia and
New South Wales, and occasionally
to the Palmer district of Queens-

in partnership with Mr. Edward

portion of the property which now
forms ‘Boomarra,” special stock-
men being employed to look after
the mob, which at first numbering
500, by 1897 had increased to 2,500.
In April, 1896, Mr. Hillcoat pro-
ceeded to the run to take personal

of the late George Coxon, a native
of Newcastle-on-Tyne, England, who
came to Australia in 1857, when
about 35 years of age. After arrival
the latter gentleman made his head-
quarters at Ballarat, where he prac-
tised as an engineer, the profession
he had followed in his native land.
Upon various occasions he joined in
rushes to newly discovered gold
fields, his professional knowledge
enabling him to undertake important
technical work for mining companies
operating in these embryo settle-
ments. Mr. Coxon also interested
himself in farming and pastoral pur-
suits, taking up a block of grazing
country near Casterton, in Western
Victoria. This run he worked with the
assistance of his sons. Eventually

autumn of life, his death occurring
in the year 1893. The late Mr.

the globe being due in no small
measure to such enterprising colon-
ists as he proved himself to be. Not
least among the benefits conferred
by him upon the land of his adop-
tion was the legacy of a family of
four sons and four daughters, whom
he left to carry on his name and the
traditions of his line. Seven of the
eight survive, and the four sons have
all been closely identified for over
half a century with pastoral pur-
suits in Queensland and the sister
States. The eldest, John, has united
agriculture with stockraising on his
property in Victoria, while the
remaining three have settled in
Queensland. George (the gentleman
under review) is numbered among
the pastoralists of Longreach;
Francis owns “Glendower” Station,
in the Prairie district of Northern
Queensland; and the youngest,
James Edward, is the proprietor
of '“Elwell” Station, in the Mutta-
burra district in the north-west.
Mr. George Coxon was born at
Gateshead, Newcastle-on-Tyne, Eng-
land, on May 29, 1850, and came
to Australia with his parents when
seven years of age. At that period
the facilities for education in the
country districts of Victoria were of
the most meagre description, rough
times being the lot of the sons of
most of the early arrivals. As a con-
sequence young Coxon enjoyed few
of the advantages which a modern
schoolboy takes as a matter of
course, and when about 17 he began
active life on the land, co-operating
with his father and brothers on the
home property at Casterton, which
was devoted chiefly to sheep. He
continued at this work until his
twenty-fifth year, when he struck
out for himself, taking up a block
of land adjoining his father’s, and
carrying on operations there until
1879. About that time the bigger
scope offered by Queensland for pas-
toral activity impressed itself upon
him, and disposing of his interests
in Victoria, he came to the northern
State, and settled on the Darling
Downs, where he selected a holding
suitable for farming purposes, and
proceeded to develop it as a mixed
enterprise, with sheep as the prin-
cipal line of industry. Here, how-
ever, very heartbreaking experiences
awaited him, a severe visitation of
drought annulling the work of years
by decimating his flock and render-
ing his agricultural areas barren and
profitless. Other setbacks combined
to discourage and dishearten the
brave spirit, which, however, too
proud to admit failure, although
called up to sacrifice almost all that
he depended on to make life worth
living, determined to defeat the
hard fate which dogged his foot-
steps, and to make a fresh start
in a more promising field. Selling

the Darling Downs property, Mr.
Coxon, accompanied by his wife and
family, and taking with him a work-
ing plant, travelled across country
to Longreach, a journey which was


made almost unbearable at times by
the myriads ot flies and mosquitoes
which attacked the party, while the
delays which occurred through one
cause and another were a frequent
source of anxiety and irritation. At
length, however, the long distance
of 700 miles was safely covered, and
the destination duly reached. But
a lengthy period elapsed wdiilst the
business of finding suitable country
for the purpose Mr. Coxon had in
view was proceeded with. Finally,
after two years of patient effort, a
holding near Isisford was selected.
The run was situated on the Barcoo
River, and giving to the new
“Wakefield” paddocks, but this
number does not represent the full
carrying capacity of the country, a
cycle of good seasons alone being
needed to wipe away the blighting
effects of past droughts and to in-
crease the total of stock. The pro-
perty is held in the names of various
members of the Coxon family, who
have taken up respective areas, each
on his own account, and added them
to the run, to be worked together

development of the area. Since its
selection by Mr. Coxon in 1898, the
“Wakefield” Estate has become one
of the well-known properties of the
district. The area has been added
to from time to time by purchase
and selection, and comprises 120,000
acres, with a carrying capacity of
45,000 sheep in normal seasons, this
number having been grazed on the
run just prior to the 1914 drought.

good deal of timber is still standing

Mr. Coxon during his residence in
the central district of Queensland
always played a leading part, in
promoting the general advancement
of the community of which he
formed a unit, and for the past 20
years he has served as a Justice of
the Peace, to which commission he
was gazetted by the Liberal Admin-
istration in office during the late
nineties. He took a leading part in
the public life of the Barcoo district,
for some years occupying a seat on
the council of the shire, and subse-
quently being elected to the Isisford
Shire Council, of which he enjoyed
the distinction of being a founda-

to the interests of the big section of
Australian citizens who make their
livelihood on the land have been
universally acknowledged by the
leading members of this influential
organization, who have been glad
to avail themselves of his counsel
and advice in connection with their
official and private obligations and
concerns. Similarly, his 40 years of

residence in the pastoral districts of
Queensland having brought him
intimately into touch with matters
relating to the questions of water
supply, his opinion carried, consider-
able weight with the delegates who
sat on the Dominion Commission in
Queensland in 1913, when he was
one of the witnesses to give evidence
on the subject of artesian water.
Upon that occasion Mr. Coxon gave
expression to a theory which occa-
sioned much cogitation among the
learned commissioners, his conten-
tion being that the artesian or deep
water obtained was sea water, wdiich
had lost its saline quality more or
less as a result of the filtration which
must needs take place in its progress
through the rock. This theory, it is
interesting to note, has since been
endorsed by some of the leading
scientists of America. Charitable
movements and institutions have
always had a sterling supporter in
Mr. Coxon, and for many years he
did good work on the hospital com-
mittee of Isisford, of which he was
a member. He married in 1878 Mary
Ann, eldest daughter of the late
Joseph Mott, who with his wife,
Eliza, was numbered among the
early settlers, first of South Aus-
tralia and latterly of Victoria. The

the young; man to the southern con-
tinent. The late Mr. Bergin was
accompanied by his brother Michael,
and reached Port Phillip during the
latter part of 1852, when the excite-
ment attaching to the new fields was
at its height. Soon after their
arrival the brothers joined in the
rush to Bendigo, where they opened
a business as general storekeepers
and gold-buyers, trading as Bergin
Bros. The venture prospered, and
branches were formed at Fryer
Creek, Castlemaine, and other

centres from which the precious
metal was being obtained. But
the brothers missed the stirring
adventures of the rushes to new-
found deposits of gold, and they
subsequently took part in several of
the latter, leaving their stores in the
hands of managers. About this time
Mr. J. D. Bergin, realizing the
strong demand for meat at a popu-
lous field like Bendigo, and the
large purchasing powers of the
miners, bought a draft of 500 fat
bullocks in the Moree district of
New South Wales, and brought them
overland to the Victorian settlement,
where they were sold at high prices.
This was the first mob of cattle to be
sold by auction on the diggings,
and new yards were specially con-
structed to accommodate the cattle.
During the overland journey Mr.
Bergin met the late William
Butler, of Kilcoy, who was taking a
flock of sheep to the same destina-
tion, and the two pastoralists of the
future made their first acquaintance
en route. In the early sixties the
Bergin brothers dissolved partner-
ship, and Mr. J. D. Bergin came to
the Wide Bay and Burnett districts
of Queensland. In this locality he
took up a large area of country,
and stocked it with cattle. The
run commanded a good frontage to
the Mary River, and the new holder
erected stockyards and inaugurated
other improvements. In the early
days in that part of Queensland
troubles came quickly to the pioneer -
ing pastoralists, and Mr. Bergin ex-
perienced considerable difficulty with
the blacks, whilst visitations from
excessive floods were severe, and
wrought considerable destruction.
Mr. Bergin continued on the hold-
ing until just before the discovery
of the Gympie goldfields in 1867,
when he sold out to his brother-in-
law, the late Isaac Moore, of Baram-
bah. A portion of the area, then
known as “Obi Obi” Station, is
now included in the boundaries of
“Kenilworth” Station. Asan example
of the rough conditions to which the
family had to submit in the early
days of Mr. Bergin’s pastoral enter-
prise it may be mentioned that when
living at “Obi Obi” Station, though
having been presented by Mr. Ber-
gin’s brother with a buggy and set
of harness, the family found the
roads in such fearful condition that
they were unable to use the vehicle,
so that when Mrs. Bergin under-
took the journey to Brisbane she

was able to do so only by facing the
distance on horseback. On selling out
on the Mary River Mr. Bergin came
to Brisbane to live, and he invested
extensively in freehold estates in
the metropolis, becoming owner of
several blocks of land in the heart
of Brisbane. Mr. Bergin was respon-
sible for opening up the most direct
route between Brisbane and the
then flourishing settlement of
Gympie, and subsequently he piloted
to the latter place a party of lead-
ing metropolitan merchants anxious
to take advantage of the rapidly-
growing commercial opportunities
offering at the northern centre. The
track at that time was very rough,
the usual time occupied by bullock
drays in covering the distance being
three months. Mr. Bergin resided
in Brisbane for about five years, but
on the expiration of that period he
secured the leasehold of “Samford”
Station, part of which was freehold.
Here he engaged in breeding beef
and dairy cattle, as well as other
stock, sending his produce for sale
to Brisbane. This enterprise he
continued until 1894, when he took
up his residence at Milton, near


Brisbane. Four years previously he
purchased "Grassmere” Station, a
run 100 miles south of the town of
Mitchell, comprising some 350 square
miles of good mulga country. The pro-
perty was partly improved and suit-
ably divided into paddocks. The

main difficulty in working the sta-
tion arose from the shortage of
water, and during the drought of
1897-8 so severe were conditions that
90 per cent of the herd was lost.
This experience provided a striking
contrast to the season of 1890, the
year in which Mr. Bergin took pos-
session, heavy floods then providing
an ample supply of water. After
working the run for ten years Mr.
Bergin sold “Grassmere” to Mr.
Arnold Wienholt. Mr. J. I). Bergin
married Jane, the youngest sister of
the late Mr. Isaac Moore, who came
to Australia from County Down,
Ireland, where his family had
tilled the soil for many genera-
tions. The issue of this union
was six sons and four daughters,
of whom all but two sons survive.
The third son, Hugh Philip, is a
member of the legal firm of Bergin
and Caine, Brisbane, while the
youngest, Kavan, enlisted in the
A.T.F. in 1915. He proceeded to
France with the Artillery, and has
been on active service ever since, with
the exception of a short period of
leave which he spent in London. Mr.
Basil Bergin was born at Brisbane,
and early in life assisted his father
on the home property at Samford.
When “Grassmere” was purchased
the young man went to that station,
and remained there until about
1898, when he took charge of
“Carpentaria Downs,” a fine cattle
station in the Cooke district, where
he remained six months. In 1901,
Mr. J. D. Bergin having consider-
ably curtailed his pastoral opera-
tions, Basil, in conjunction with his
brother, Vincent, started in busi-
ness as graziers and cattle dealers,
securing a lease of “Tcomoo,” a run
comprising about 420 square miles,
lying some 30 miles to the north of
“Grassmere.” The brothers use the
station mainly for breeding and
fattening cattle, and up to the year
1912 sent large supplies to the
Sydney market. Since then, how-
ever, the output has been sold to
the various Brisbane Meat Works.
The run is splendidly watered,
three artesian bores supplying up-
wards of half a million gallons each,
and the greatest possible use is made
of this valuable asset. The water is
taken for considerable distances by
means of drains and the natural
fall of the land, and in addition
there are a number of large dams.
Since the partners entered into
possession a considerable sum has
been spent on further improvements,
fencing, and the conserving of
water. The herd of cattle usually
totals about 9,000 head, whilst con-
siderable attention has been success-
fully devoted to maintaining a good
type of saddle horses. The run
consists of open mulga country,
lightly timbered and well grassed
in normal seasons. In 1912 the
two brothers extended their enter-
prise by purchasing from the
Darling Downs and Western Lands
Company “Merivale” Station, which
lies 90 miles to the north of Mitchell.
The run consists of 350 square miles,
of which part is freehold and part
leasehold. An average of 10,000
head of cattle is carried here, a good
type of serviceable shorthorns having
been established. Each year these
are improved by judicious selection,
and bulls are bred on the property
for all the stations belonging to the
same owners. Saddle horses and
Clydesdales are also produced at
“Merivale,” and an excellent stan-
dard has been set up. Altogether
a considerable number of horses are
depastured on the holding. The run
is watered by Merivale Creek, but
in addition to that source of supply
several substantial dams have been
constructed, whilst operations to-
wards discovering and making avail-
able artesian water were commenced
in 1917. The country is excellently
adapted for grazing purposes and is
famed for its fattening properties,
ironbark ridges alternating with
apple-tree flats. In 1916 “Marlong,”
a property of 100 square miles, and
adjacent to “Merivale,” was pur-
chased. The run is well improved,
and the two are worked conjointly.
Previous to this the brothers had
bought “Currawilla,” a holding of
1,100 square miles in the Gregory
north district. As at “Merivale,”
cattle are bred and stores purchased
for fattening at the more northerly
holding. The grasses possess fine
nourishing properties, whilst in the
back country mulga and gidya grow
profusely. The homestead on this
property is regarded as one of
the finest in the west country.
Several excellent stockyards have
been erected and other substantial
improvements made. Farrar Creek,
which contains permanent water,
flows through the station, and
greatly lessens the difficulty of
securing an adequate and reliable
water supply. Other creeks of
smaller dimensions intersect the
holding, and these have been supple-
mented by the construction of dams
for storage purposes. At the time of
writing (1917) several sub-artesian
bores are in course of construction.
Mr. Basil Bergin is a keen sports-
man, and frequently runs horses of

ings. He is a member of the

property situated at Meldreth, in
close vicinity to the historic town
above mentioned. Being of an adven-
turous disposition, the late gentleman
decided to test his fortune in this
land of promise, and disposing of his
interests in the Mother Country,
he embarked with his family on
board the "Mary Ann” in 1854,
landing at Victoria, where he immedi-
ately turned his attention to farm-
ing pursuits. His first venture was
to lease a farm at Warrnambool,
where he made a special feature of
the cultivation of potatoes with only
fair results. Two years later he
settled at Penshurst, where he

secured a small block of about
100 acres, subsequently adding to
this until he had increased his pos-
sessions to 1,200 acres, forming an
estate excellently suited to mixed-
farming and grazing pursuits. Here
he continued for about 29 years,
ultimately selling out in 1885, when
he removed to Temora, New South
Wales, whither his son had preceded
him by a few years, where he lived
a retired life until his demise in 1892.
Although declining to accept the
responsibilities of office on behalf of
the community of which he formed
a unit, the late Mr. East com-
manded the respect and esteem of
those with whom he came into con-
tact, and his death marked the
removal of one more of the worthy
mid-century settlers who efficiently
continued the pioneering work so ably
begun by those who preceded them.
Mr. G. T. East, arrived with his
parents in Victoria when only two
years of age, and received his early
education in a public school at Pens-
hurst, completing his scholastic
studies under a private tutor at his
father’s homestead, where at the
same time he obtained a good work-
ing acquaintance with the principles
of general farming and the manage-
ment of stock. In his nineteenth
year he struck out for himself, tak-
ing up a selection of 230 acres nearly
adjoining the paternal property,
where he initiated farming onera-
tions on similar lines to those so
successfully adopted by Mr. East,
sen. This land was very swampy in
character, and as an instance of the
enterprise and determination of
these pioneer settlers of Victorian
country districts, it may be men-
tioned that Mr. G. T. East on his
own initiative devised a scheme of
drainage whereby he was successful
in reclaiming about 200 acres of this
hitherto useless area, rendering it in
every way suitable for purposes of
cultivation. Eventually deciding
that the time had come to seek a
wider scope for his activities, he
sold the property and applied
for a selection of 2,560 acres at
Temora, in New South Wales.
Only two months after his applica-
tion was sent in payable gold was
discovered in the neighbourhood of
his selection, and owing to pressure
of mining interests the greater part
of his newly-acquired holding was
thrown open as a goldfields reserve.
The portion of which he finally

found himself possessed was an area
of 640 acres, to which later on he
was able to add by purchase a fur-
ther 960 acres, and ultimately he
increased the area to 2,100 acres.
During his residence in this district
Mr. East had many opportunities
of entering upon promising min-
ing speculations, allurements which
always proved vain. He speedily
perceived, however, the favourable
opening for further enterprise in his
own particular field of industry
offered by the huge influx of popu-
lation, promoted by the gold dis-
coveries of the district, and in con-
junction with a partner he secured a
lease of the local flour mill, and

12 months, when a fire destroyed the
mill and all the stock. Nothing
daunted, Mr. East at once erected
an up-to-date mill, after three
years’ operations selling out to his
paitner, with whom he had also been
successfully engaged in the business
of machinery agents and auctioneers
in Temora. Prior to this trans-
action he visited Queensland, a
trip undertaken chiefly for the
benefit of his health, and being


greatly delighted with the climate,
and favourably impressed with the
conditions of land settlement, he
determined to make this State his
permanent home. Accordingly, in

grazing property situated near War-
wick, and comprising about 4,800
acres of land, which was applied by
Mr. East chiefly to woolgrowing,
and sheep and cattle fattening.
Since that time he has owned many
station properties, among which may
be specially mentioned “Marra

“Lockwood,” near Charleville;
“Tathumnarra,” near Augathella;
and “Kihee,” adjoining the well-
known “Durham Downs” property

CHARLES MONTAGUE CURR,
of “Ruwenzori,” Warwick, was born
in 1868 in the old and famous
mining town of Ravenswood, Queens-
land, and is the second son of the
late Marmaduke Curr, a name well
known in the early history of the
southern! portion of the Australian
continent. The origin of the family
under the Southern Cross dates
back to pioneering days in Tasmania,
when the late Edward Curr, grand-
father of the gentleman under re-
view, accompanied by his wife,
formerly Miss Micklethwaite, of
“Ardsley Hall,” Yorkshire, came to
the island, then known as Van
Diemen Land, in 1826, as manager
on behalf of the old Van Diemen
Land Company, a combination which
had secured an immense Crown
grant of about 350,000 acres, in
which he was himself a large share-
holder, carrying with it the right
to employ as many convicts as they
chose to apply for from the Govern-
ment. This undertaking at that time
was considered to be the most
important project of its kind south
of the equator. Edward Curr, who
was a man of considerable force
of character, made his influence
strongly felt in the public life of the
day, and was a strenuous supporter
of the separation movement by
which Victoria asserted her
right to an existence inde-
pendent from the mother
colony of New South Wales,
with powers of self-govern-
ment equal to those possessed
by the older settlement. He
was popularly known as the
“Father of Separation,” and
it was a remarkable coincid-
ence that after an active
life, in which he had em-
ployed Lis powers to the
fullest extent for the bring-
ing about of this and other
developmental changes for
the benefit of his fellow-
citizens, his untimely decease
should occur on the very
day that separation was
finally granted by the Brit-
ish Parliament. Another
fact of considerable interest
in the family annals is that
the father of the late
Edward Curr was the inven-
tor of the iron rail which
has become such an indis-
pensable factor in connection with
railway traffic all over the world.
Mr. C. M. Curr’s father, the late
Marmaduke Curr, as a young man
in Victoria to come and exploit this
promising-looking territory. After
their arrival these men immediately
set to work in the vicinity of the
creek pointed out to them by Mr.
Curr, and had the satisfaction of
discovering gold in payable quantity
in less than 24 hours. This find
being noised abroad, the inevitable
rush followed, and from the canvas
town which marks the inception of a
new mining field gradually rose the
thriving town of Ravenswood. Mr.
Curr himself derived considerable
benefit from the increase of popula-
tion in the district on account of the
improved prices which he was able
to demand for his cattle. Though
not a breeder of stud stock, he was
very successful in raising beef bul-
locks, and on one occasion he estab-
lished what was considered a record
by sending to the markets 30 fat
cattle, the weight of which averaged
about 1,200 lbs. per head. He
established the stations “Merri
Merriwa” and “Gilquinnia,” and
subsequently became the proprietor
of “Cardigan” Station, which he
acquired by purchase whilst resident
on the Burdekin River. In 1879 he
penetrated the far north, right up
into the Gulf country, where he
took up “Abingdon Downs,” an area
of 500 square miles, highly suitable

the month of June, 1863. To him
the credit is due of having been
mainly instrumental in the first dis-
covery of gold on a portion of this
property, which afterwards became
known as Ravenswood. Having had
some experience in mining in his


sixty-fourth year of his age. The
late Mr. Curr left a family of three
sons. Mr. Charles Montague Curr,
the subject of this memoir, received
his early scholastic training under
private tuition at his father’s home-
stead, subsequently finishing his
education at a school at Manly, New
South Wales. Leaving this institu-
tion at eighteen, he became
associated with his father in
pastoral pursuits on "Abingdon
Downs”; after the demise of the
latter gentleman, with his two
brothers, inheriting the property, to
which he has since added an auxili-
ary area of 500 square miles. Here
he devoted his attention to the
building up of an improved short-
horn herd, and about the year 1913
disposed of the run, which at the
time was carrying about 12,000 head
of stock, to Messrs. Rogers and
Marsden. In 1908 he purchased
"Miranda Downs,” a property 1,060
acres in extent, which he has since
sold to Mr. Alexander Hay, of New
South Wales, who at the time
of writing is on active service.
Eventually, in the year 1916, Mr.
Curr settled on his present pro-
perty, "Ruwenzori,” near Warwick,

as a residence for his family, and to
which he has since made many
additions, and introduced modern
appointments throughout. Mr. Curr
is possessed of an adventurous dis-
position, and is fond of sport, par-
ticularly of shooting big game. For
this purpose he took his first trip
into the wilds of Central Africa in
1910, and during the 10 months of
his absence spent four months in this
fascinating pastime, bringing back
trophies of his skill of sufficient
number and variety to fill a moder-
ate-sized museum. These are now
adorning the interior of his bungalow
residence. At a later date he made
two further trips to Africa, accom-
panied by his wdfe and Mr. William
Hutson, late pastoral manager for
the Bank of New South Wales in
North Queensland, and on one occa-
sion traversed the route taken in a
previous season by ex-President
Roosevelt, of America. It is worthy
of mention that in one season he,
with his brother, Mr. W. B. Curr,
was successful in killing 17 lions,
which was regarded as a record at
the time. On his third and last trip
Mr. Curr became a member of a
company formed in Narobi, in
British East Africa, having for its
object the working of a goldmine,
called "Kilimasazie,” meaning “a
mountain of money,” where a reef
had been discovered, 22 feet in
width, assaying 44 ozs. of gold to
the ton. He also owns an interest in
another mine, about four miles dis-
tant from this place, known
as "Rohogo,” which is
yielding good results, but
neither of these promising
propositions can be worked
efficiently until the world is
at peace again. Mr. Curr
was in German East Africa
when the present great war
broke out, and he and his
party were allowed to depart
on the day following only
on condition that they
immediately returned to
British territory, to do
which they had to make
their way over 70 miles
of rough country, taking
nearly 17 days on the
route. Mr. Curr returned
home from this trip in
February, 1915. Whilst
resident in the northern
portion of the State, he
occupied for some time the
office of president of the
Croydon Agricultural, Pas-
toral, and Mining Associa-
tion. He was married in
1900 to Mary Theresa,
daughter of the late James Ambrose,
well known in the cattle-dealing
trade of Queensland, and has five
daughters.

BROWNE, “The Palms,” Welling-
ton Point, was born in the year
1863, at the foot of the Anakie Hills,
about 20 miles north of Geelong,

Victoria. His father, the late Mr.
John Browne, one of the early
pioneers of Victoria, was born in
the parish of Borgue, Kirkcud-
brightshire, Scotland, on May 24,
1818. Coming to Victoria at an
early age, he was one of the first
settlers on the site where Portarling-
ton now stands. He turned his
attention to sheep-farming, but after
a few years sold out, and took up, or
purchased “Moppianum,” a cattle
run in the vicinity of the historic
The homestead was on the banks of
the Wardy-Yallock (or Woady-Yal-
lock) Creek, and the country is
described as being open forest
country. Much of the land on this
estate being of a gold-bearing charac-
ter, the encroachments of prospectors
and others when gold was discovered
made serious inroads on his pastures
and disturbed his cattle, and he
therefore sold “Moppianum” and
purchased “Narada,” a sheep pro-
perty 20 miles north of Geelong.
His name, however, has been pre-
served in “Brown’s Diggings,” which
attained historic importance in
earlier days, and winch was called
after the owner of “Moppianum,”
an estate which embraced all the
country subsequently known as
Brown’s, Scarsdale’s, and Newtown,
and the Galatea Gold Mine, after-
wards opened up, is in the near
vicinity of the old homestead. The
late Mr. Browne married Eliza
Tennant, eldest daughter of the late
Robert Linton, pastoralist of “Emu
Park,” near Pitfield, Ballarat, who
was a near neighbour. Mrs. Browne
was born at Mount Park, Greenock,
Scotland, on November 30, 1829,
and arrived in Victoria in 1838, her
death taking place in July, 1910.
Mr. John Browne, as before stated,
after leaving “Moppianum,” pur-
chased “Narada,” a sheep property
20 miles north of Geelong, Victoria,
which he held until 1886, when he
sold the larger portion of the pro-
perty to Mr. F. W. Armytage, only
retaining about 800 acres, to which
he gave the name of “Narada West,”
the “Narada” property was repur-
chased by Mr. T. M. Browne, who
now resides there, and another
brother, Mr. P. M. Browne, some
years ago purchased a property at

what was his father’s original home-
stead, where he has taken up his
residence. Mr. Montgomery Stew-
art Browne is the third youngest in
a family of six sons and one daugh-
ter, all but one of whom still
survive. He was educated at a
private school in the Anakie dis-
trict, and acquired his first know-
ledge of sheep on his father’s
gold-mining town of Ballarat. A
notice appearing in The Port Phillip
Gazette of February 23, 1849, gives
particulars of this run at the time
of being taken over by Mr. Browne.

and on which he lived until the time
of his death in 1896. This property
is now owned by his youngest son,
Mr. W. G. Browne. In the early
part of the year 1915 the whole of

twentieth year, when with his three
elder brotlaers he came to Queens-
land in the year 1883, going first to
the Moonie country, where his uncle,


the late Mr. Samuel Browne, who
was one of the pioneers of sheep
grazing in Queensland, had taken
up and stocked the properties
known as “Tartha,” “Canmaroo,”

“Coomrith,” and ‘ North Ingleston.”
Remaining with his uncle for about
six months, he got an insight into
the old method of shepherding, but
he never took kindly to this class of
work. Subsequently, with his
brothers, he went to the central
western country, and settled near
Tambo, in the district,
taking up country on conditional
purchase terms; later, when Mr.
C. B. Dutton’s Land Bill came into
force, taking up the grazing farms
known as “Narada Downs,” “Holi-
ness,” and “Lumeah,” situated near
Tambo, and between Tambo and
Charleville, the latter being the rail-
way town from which wool, etc., is
despatched and supplies obtained,
“Narada Downs” and “Holiness”
comprise some of the best grazing
land in Western Queensland, prin-
cipally open rolling downs, lightly
timbered, and clothed with a variety
of good grasses. Both are well
watered by a system of dams,
tanks, and subartesian bores, upon
which a very large amount has
been spent, all three properties
(including “Lumeah”) being highly
improved. “Lumeah” comprises
mulga country, which, though
inferior in carrying capacity, is a
great stand-by in drought time,
especially when worked in conjunc-
tion with the other runs already
named. The stock carried on these
areas number about 60,000 sheep,
300 cattle, and 120 horses. The
firm of Browne Brothers, of which
Mr. M. S. Browne is one of the
partners, is. well known in the
central districts, and wool bearing
the “Narada Downs” brand is keenly
competed for at the Brisbane wool
sales, where most of the clip is sold;
and an exhibit of this wool at the
Franco-British Exhibition in Lon-
don, gained the gold medal, of which
the firm is deservedly proud. Of
recent years the separate members
of the firm have retired from active
management; one of them, Mr. J. S.
Browne, having sustained a very
serious injury to his spine, the result
of his horse falling on and crushing
him at “Toliness” in 1905, and he
now resides in Melbourne, while the
other meiftbers of the firm also reside
in Victoria, with the exception of the
subject of this review, who retired
from personal active management
of the above-mentioned grazing farms
at the end of 1909, after 26
years of strenuous work in bringing
these properties to their present
highly-developed state. They are
now under the care of managers,
whose operations are occasionally
supervised by visits from one or
the other of the partners. Mr.
M. S. Browne in settling at Wel-
lington Point, where he has made
hie home, has selected a very pretty
and progressive district, principally
devoted to fruitgrowing and dairy-
ing, and situated 19 miles by road
from Brisbane. His property, “The
Palms,” comprising 39 acres, is
situated south of the railway line,
which passes through the property,
the railway station being about one
mile distant. About six acres
are, under cultivation at the
time of writing; pineapples,
bananas, paw-paw, citrus, and other
fruits being grown. The house is
outlined against a background of
beautiful trees and palms, which
were planted some 28 to 30 years
ago, and are therefore fully devel-
oped and at their best. The property
was originally owned and laid out
by Mr. James Pink, a former
curator of the Brisbane Botanical
Gardens, and a horticulturist of high
standing. The flower garden which
surrounds the house contains a fine
collection of rose trees and other
blooms, and to its cultivation Mr.
Browne devotes most of his spare
time. He takes an active interest
in local matters, and is a member of
the Wellington Point Agricultural
Society and Progress Association; of
the local cricket club; and of the
Presbyterian Church, of which he is

also a trustee. Mr. Browne married
in 1903 Isabella, daughter of Mr.
Samuel Johnston, of “Waterview,”
Bundaberg, who was a well-known
pioneer of the sugar and sawmilling
industries of Bundaberg. There is
a family of three sons and two
daughters.
The late FREDERICK ARCHI-
BALD BLACKMAN, who may be
described as the pioneer pastoralist
of the Port Curtis country, was
the founder of “Warro” Station in
that district, on which holding he
settled with his brother in the year
1853, being then only 18 years of
age. The deceased gentleman was
born in Sydney on August 8, 1835,
being a son of the late John Black-
man, a London merchant, who for
health reasons left his native land
in the early thirties. The latter
gentleman brought with him his
wife and four young children, in-
tending to settle with his family on
a pastoral holding. For this pur-
pose he came armed with capital and
the requisites necessary to squatting
enterprise in those primitive days.
On arrival, however, conditions
were found to be extremely unsettled
in the country districts, and Mrs.
Blackman did not care to expose her
children to the perils inseparable
from life in the wilds of the bush,
where attacks from savage blacks
were of frequent occurrence, and
most of the conveniences of civiliza-
tion entirely absent. John Blackman
consequently determined to estab-
lish himself as an auctioneer in
Sydney, and while following this
occupation he died in 1846. About
two years after his father’s death,
the sons, Robert and Frederick, came
to Queensland, with the object of
opening in Maryborough a branch
of the business of their brother-in-
law, Christopher Newton, who was
a general merchant in Sydney. But
the call of the wild proved too
strong for the spirit of adventure in
the blood of the two lads, and they
engaged in the work of exploration.
It was not long before the lot of
leadership fell to Frederick, and
accompanied by two others, he made
a perilous overland journey from
Maryborough to Gladstone for the
purpose of reporting on the Calli-
ope goldfields. The young leader
w-as but 17 years of age, and his
companions were a faithful black-
boy and a morose and treacherous
German named Haudt. On one occa-
sion the latter when in a furious
temper took his gun and threatened
to shoot the other two members of
the expedition. But young Black-
man was nothing daunted, and seiz-
ing his own weapon, declared in
tones about which there was no mis-
taking that he would shoot first.
Fortunately the foreigner knew the
Englishman to be the better shot of
the two, and he afterwards asked
forgiveness for what he had done,
declaring that all his life he had
been subject to fits of ungovernable
temper. But naturally real harmony
was not again restored. The mental
strain of an expedition carried out
MR. FREDERICK ARCHIBALD BLACKMAN.
under such circumstances may be
well imagined. The journey covered
a distance of 220 miles, and the last
hundred was beyond the furthest
limits of. pastoral settlement of the
time. The natives of that country
were then very hostile, having made
several murderous attacks on the
stations. These assaults were always
carried out at night; but not fully
realizing the risk which they ran,
the little band of travellers were in
the habit of sleeping without any
guard. Yet the journey was brought
to a successful termination, the Ger-
man giving a parting illustration of
his true character by disappearing
with a horse which did not belong to
him. Soon after this expedition,
Frederick Blackman, with his
brother Robert, took up a run n
the Port Curtis district, bestowing
upon it the title of “Warro,” which
was the native name for a mountain
in the vicinity. Beginning opera-
tions here in 1853, they were
granted their occupation licence in
1855. For a while the brothers con-
centrated their efforts on breeding
pure merino sheep. However, this
class of stock proved unsuited to
the coast district, and a herd of
cattle was procured and bred from.
Both sheep and cattle were then
worked together with a fair measure
of success for several years. In 1861
the brothers dissolved partnership.
Robert taking the sheep and found-
ing a station named “Rockwood,” on
the Pioneer River, whilst Frederick
remained at “Warro,” where he
retained the cattle. “Warro” orig-
inally contained within its bound-
ary the present “Thornhill” Estate,
but on account of the hostile spirit
of the native tribes the Messrs.
Blackman, with the object of secur-
ing a near neighbour who would
make common cause with them
against the enemy, and help in
effectively repelling these aboriginal
raids, resigned the portion of the
run beyond Granite Creek to a Mr.
Charlton, who was afterwards killed
by the limb of a tree falling on him.
“Thornhill” then came into the hands
of the Glennie family, James Glennie
acting as trustee for his daughter,
Mrs. Carden Collins and her child-
ren, accompanying them to the
Port Curtis district, and undertak-
ing the administration of the pro-
perty. “Thornhill,” now a flourish-
ing estate, almost the whole of
which is freehold, at present is in
the hands of Messrs. Gibson Bros.,
the “sugar kings” of Bundaberg.
In 1860 Mr. F. A. Blackman mar-
ried an English lady, then on a
visit to Sydney. In 1874, for
the sake of the education of his
children, and to obtain the advan-
tages of a change of climate, he
placed a manager on “Warro,” and
settled in Hobart for six years. Here
two more children were born, the
family comprising seven sons and
five daughters. In 1881 a return
was made to Queensland, and a
home formed at Hamilton, where
Mr. Blackman thenceforth resided
almost up to the time of his death,
which occurred on January 18, 1906.
Following his return from Tasmania


he purchased “Barwon Park,”
in the Leichhardt district, and
stocked it with ca’ttle from “Warro,”
the carrying capacity of the latter
station being then considerably over-
taxed. After the drought of 1902
the stock on “Barwon Park” was
practically wiped out, 8,000 head
of cattle on that station per-
ishing during the period of dis-
aster, while the “Warro” herd
also was diminished by 2,000 head.
Eventually “Warro” was purchased
by Mr. Blackman’s fourth son,
Harry, who is still resident there,
while “Barwon” was taken over by
the second son, Walter, who dis-
posed of it at a later date. Mr.
Blackman’s period of residence in
Brisbane was marked by a keen
interest in all that should tend to
the advancement of the pastoral
industry, and he was instrumental
in founding the Queensland Stock-
breeders and Graziers’ Association,
an institution with which he was
closely identified as honorary secre-
tary and treasurer, until compelled
by failing health to discontinue
these offices. In connection with the
treatment of disease® in stock, he
was in constant correspondence with
the Pasteur Institute, and through
the medium of the Press dissemin-
ated valuable information obtained
from this source. On several occa-
sions he was asked to act on an
advisory board to the Government
on stock matters, and was instru-
mental in getting Drs. Loir and
Germont from the Pasteur Institute
to experiment with a view to stamp-
ing out pleuro and other diseases in
cattle. He was a born mechanical
engineer, and an example of his
skill in this direction may be seen
at the Brisbane Museum, where
there is an exact model of the
“Warro” stockyard, built abso-
lutely to- scale, with every mortice
and tenon exactly in accord with
the original. The “Viper,” a species
of hypodermic syringe, made speci-
ally to suit the rough usage of the
stockyard, and now largely used in
South Africa as well as all over
Australia for purposes of inocula-
tion, was invented by him, and he
also invented a lever-bail, which is
still in use at “Warro,” and has
beeia copied by many other Queens-
land stations. Among his other
inventions was a branding bail,
a pneumatic pump, and sundry
ingenious gate-fastenings ; also an ear
instrument to relieve certain causes
of deafness. He ran a paddle-
wheeler, worked with the machinery
from an old clock, on a waterhole
in the vicinity of his house, and fol-
lowed this craft in a canvas canoe
of his own construction. Besides his
skill as a mechanic, he contributed
freely to the newspapers on current
topics of the day, and in addition
wrote several stories, which were
published in serial form in some of
the southern journals. He was the
author of a book entitled “Adven-
tures in Queensland,” under the
nom de plume “Australia,” of
which the first edition sold right
out, inducing Mr. Blackman to pub-
lish a second edition. During his
lengthy residence in the bush, he
took a keen interest in matters of
natural history, and besides form-
ing an interesting collection of his
own, he forwarded numerous speci-
mens to the naturalist Mr. Krefft,
and to the Brisbane, Sydney, and
Hobart Museums, among his con-
tributions being many previously
unknown snakes and land shells. So
highly did the museum trustees ap-
preciate the manner in which he
had worked for them, that they pre-
sented him with a most valuable
collection of books on natural his-
tory. His widow, now 82 years of
age (1916) resides at Hamilton with
an unmarried daughter, and with
the exception of one son, who has
settled in New South Wales, all his
sons are scattered over the State of
his adoption. Two of Mr. Black-
man’s grandsons, after training at
Salisbury Plains, are now on active
service, and two of his nephews
from New South Wales have fallen
in the service of their country. In
this connection it is interesting to
note that his great-uncle, Captain
John Blackman, fell at Waterloo, a
tablet to his memory being erected
in a church at Brussels.
PETER FITZALLAN MAC-
DONALD, of “The Range,” Rock-
hampton, was born on September 4,
1830, at Campbelltown, New South
Wales, in which locality his father,
the late Alexander Macdonald, was
engaged in farming and cattle-
raising pursuits. He received an
early education at King’s School,
Parramatta, and became associated
with the industry carried on by
his father until the outbreak of
the Turon gold-diggings, when he
aspired in common with the other
young men of the day to “try his
luck” on the newly-discovered field.
Later he found his way to Bendigo,
and met with considerable success in
his search for gold, but being pros-
trated by a serious attack of typhoid
fever, he was reduced to a condition
of extreme weakness, and had to
abandon his claim on Golden Flat,
despite the possibilities which it
offered, and take a position as over-
seer on a sheep and cattle run near
Geelong, where he remained from
1851 to 1854. He was then pro-
moted to the management of the
property, and continued in that
capacity until 1857. The reports of
the exploration work of Mitchell
(afterwards Sir Thomas), Kennedy,
and Leichhardt, were always eagerly
read by Mr. Macdonald, and the
narratives of these intrepid explorers
obtained so strong a hold over his
mind that at length nothing could
hold him back from personal par-
ticipation in so fascinating but
dangerous field of enterprise. Com-
ing to Queensland with a party,
he started from Port Curtis in
November, 1857, and leaving the
Fitzroy River the last week in Novem-
ber, with five weeks’ rations, travelled
westward in view of Lake Salvator
and the beautiful peaks to the east,
a distance of 360 miles in a direct
line from Keppel Bay. Upon the
return journey, arriving near the
junction of the Comet and Mac-
kenzie Rivers, rain commenced,
which continued without one hour’s
intermission for 21 days, and during
19 days neither sun, moon, nor stars
were visible. At that time they had
only about seven days’ provisions re-
maining, which they intended to
divide into 19 days’ allowance,
expecting by that time to reach a
station. The country was every-
where under water, and it was
impossible for the horses to travel,
as they floundered at every step,
and became as poor as old working
bullocks, being literally nothing but
skin and bone, and losing every hair
except from their manes and tails.
After many ineffectual attempts to
make a few miles in the direction of
home, they found themselves com-
pelled to camp in the midst cf thick
scrub, on a clear patch of about 10


acres, surrounded by water, where
they remained for 19 days, during
which period they scarcely saw a
living creature, all the birds and
animals evidently having sought
higher and firmer ground. Mr.
Macdonald spent many weary days
hunting for food, but encountered
only tracks where animals had been.
Small birds occasionally were seen,
which were killed with a blow from
a stick, but these, with bullfrogs,
crayfish of an inferior kind, huge
frogs, iguanas, crows, snakes, and
lizards, though eagerly sought after,
were very rarely found. Small
her ries, the roots of briars, and the
bottle-tree formed the staple articles
of diet during the earlier days of
this period of famine, but later
these were augmented by horseflesh,
which was ravenously consumed. A
slain emu provided the party of
three with food for 11 days, during
which they tasted neither flour, tea,
nor sugar, and this was the only bird
or animal above the size of a crow
that they had had the good fortune
to encounter. Of the latter (crows)
there were plenty, and although
regarded as birds of ill omen from
their habit of following persistently
in the wake of the party, in numbers
equal to the members of the expe-
dition, or of each little detachment
that might separate itself from the
others, they were freely utilized to
fill the scanty larder of the half-
starved men. Upon occasions when
Mr. Macdonald undertook short
journeys alone, he was invariably
attended by a single crow, and this
having fallen a victim to his rifle
bullet, its place was soon taken by
another, which would continue to
follow until despatched in the same
manner. Eventually he reached the
farthest out-station from Rock-
hampton, and here met a relief
party, equipped by public subscrip-
tion, which had been sent out to
search for the party, as it was
known that they had started out
with only five weeks’ provisions, and
then had been absent 12 weeks. As
may be imagined, when relieved Mr.
Macdonald was in a very weak state,
having been reduced in weight from
14 st. to 11 st. 4 lb. The week fol-
lowing his return to Marlborough he
started for Canoona, which centre
he reached on March 8, 1858. In
a short and interesting account of
his expedition, published in London
in 1859, in a book entitled "Aus-
tralian Facts and Prospects,” Mr.
Macdonald expressed his belief that
from 100 to 300 miles back from the
coast the country is superior for
sheep and cattle to any other part
of Australia that he had seen, with
the sole exception of some pastoral
areas in Victoria. To quote his own
words: "There is a richness and
velvet-like freshness in the foliage
which, together with the beautifully-
shaped hills, conical peaks, and fine
deep rivers, form a landscape grand
and picturesque beyond the power
of description; such scenery as an
artist or a lover of the beautiful
in Nature might gaze upon for
a lifetime without wishing for a
change”; and again, "Nearly one-
fourth of the country over which
we travelled is unavailable for pas-
toral purposes in consequences of the
thick scrub, great scarcity of water,
and innumerable native dogs and

savage blacks, yet nearly the whole
of it already had been taken up by
speculative, or better known as
‘drawing-room’ tenders, chiefly from
Sydney residents, to secure river
frontages by copying the descrip-
tions taken from the journals of
Mitchell and Leichhardt.” He also
engaged in making rough surveys,
preparing the best plans he could
from his imperfect knowledge of the
country, and armed with these, he
would proceed to Victoria, and
endeavour to induce capitalists to
inspect with a view to purchase.
Among the latter was Mr. H. S.
Wills, who became the owner of
"Cullin-la-ringo,” and subsequently
was murdered on the run on October
17, 1861, with 19 of his party, only
one man—John Moore—escaping.
During this expedition Mr. Mac-
donald took up a number of runs,
including “Columbria,” "Fernlees,”
"Glendarrawill,” "Emerald,” "Ya-
amba,” and other well-known pas-
toral leaseholds, and he is one
of the few who have continu-
ously retained some of the
original leaseholds right up to the
present day. In 1860 he relin-
quished the stirring life of an ex-
plorer, and turned his attention to
the development of his various lease-
holds. In this he met with the usual
vicissitudes suffered by the Aus-
tralian pastoralist, being at times
almost reduced to penury as a result
of drought. In the memorable
period extending from 1900 to
1902 he was only able to save
about 5 per cent, of the sheep and
cattle on his various runs. Mr.
Macdonald’s name came promi-
nently before the public in connec-
tion with the "Great Northern”
Run case, Mr. Macdonald bringing
a suit against the Crown (Macdon-
ald v. Tully). The action extended
over a number of years (1869-1880),
and excited widespread interest and
voluminous comments in the Queens-
land Press. The action originally
came before Mr. Justice Lutwyche
in October, 1869, and after argu-
ment the jury awarded plaintiff
damages £16,926. The final trial
occupied the attention of the court
for five months (May 13 to Sep-
tember, 1880), and resulted in the
plaintiff obtaining judgment for
£22,700, with certain costs. Mr.
Macdonald figured in Parliamentary
circles for several years as represen-
tative for Blackall in the House of
Assembly (1884-1889), He is a life
member of the National Agricul-
tural Association, Brisbane, and of
the Rockhampton Agricultural and
Pastoral Association, and of various
other organizations of a like nature,
besides which he has played a useful
part as a member of various public
bodies having for their object the
promotion of the general welfare of
the cammuirity.- During the eighties
he was proprietor of The Daily
Northern Argns newspaper, which
after passing out of his hands
changed its title to The Eeeord,
under which name it is still pub-
lished as an evening paper in Rock-
hampton. He married in 1861 Julia
Louisa, daughter of the late Charles
Ayrey, Mount Gellibrand, Geelong
district, Victoria, and has a surviv-
ing family of two sons and two
daughters.


ANDREW HARPER STIRRAT,
“Euroa,” via Gladstone, is the
eldest surviving son of Mr. David
Stirrat, of “Mount Alma” Station,
in the same district, the gentleman
under review having been born on
that property in the year 1872. Ho
received his early education under
private tuition at home, subse-
quently being sent to Toowoomba,
and still later to Brisbane, for the
completion of his scholastic studies.
Upon leaving school he became con-
nected with the staff of Messrs. Par-
bury. Lamb, & Co., of the latter
city, with whom he gained a valu-
able four-years’ mercantile experi-
ence. In 1892, returning to “Mount
Alma,” he spent six years in work
amongst the stock, at the close of
which period, having acquainted
himself in a thorough manner with
all phases of station life, he assumed
the management on his father’s
behalf, and retained this post until
1910. He commenced independent
enterprise in 1899, in which year
he concluded a profitable deal
in cattle, and about the same
time acquired a grazing farm,
18,000 acres in extent, on the
“Dumgree” resumption area. In
1903 he purchased “Rannes” cattle

station, a property then owned by
Messrs. Gilchrist, Watt, & Co.,
comprising 7,000 acres freehold and
200 square miles of leasehold, with
Y
4,200 head of stock, at a later date
disposing of ‘Dumgree” selection to
his brother. “Rannes” was held by
him for some few years, but eventu-
ally the route of the projected rail-
way-line being surveyed through the
estate, the leasehold was resumed
by the Government at improvement
value in 1910, whilst the freehold
was sold to a private purchaser for
£7,000. Meanwhile, in 1906, Mr.
Stirrat bad purchased “Kroombit,”
a property with an approximate area
of 535 square miles, carrying some
6,800 head of cattle, which proved
a profitable transaction, yielding
very satisfactory returns. Later, at
the time that “Rannes” passed out
of his possession, and additional
country was required for the stock
which had been depastured on that
run, he became the purchaser in
1912 of the well-known “Banana”
Station, carrying about 1,300 head
of mixed cattle on 90 square miles
of country. This enabled him to
meet the situation, “Kroombit” and
“Banana” between them being of
sufficient acreage to receive the
whole of the “Rannes” herd. The
two fully-stocked properties were
then worked in conjunction by Mr.
Stirrat, who made of the latter a
fattening station, while devoting
his earlier holding more exclusively
to breeding purposes. In 1914 he
still further enlarged his landed
possessions by the purchase of
“Monte Cristo” (150 square miles)
and “Mount Larcombe” (14,400
acres freehold), upon which he in-
augurated similar operations. In
MR. ANDREW HARPER STIRRAT.
1916, deciding to dispose of a couple
of his estates, he sold “Monte
Cristo,” bare of stock, and “Ba-
nana” stocked, at satisfactory
figures, retaining “Kroombit” and
“Mount Larcombe,” to which pro-
perties he has since confined his
operations. “Kroombit” Station
consists of 535 square miles, much
of which is broken and tableland
country, of granite and basaltic
formation, together with hilly
country, suitable to catlle-raising,
watered by the Kroombit, Callide,
and Karaboe Creeks, and various
wells. A considerable amount of
improvement work has been accom-
plished, and the property is divided
into about 15 paddocks, where at
the present time (1917) a herd of
some 4,500 Hereford cattle are run,
the full carrying capacity of the
pastures being about double that
number. “Mount Larcombe,” wat-
ered by a creek of the same name,
and by the Five-mile Creek, wells,
and other watercourse, is also well-
improved, and subdivided into 20
paddocks. Mr. Stirrat, who con-
tinues the personal supervision of
the properties from his private resi-
dence, “Euroa,” a fine homestead,
situated on Mount Alma, in 1902

daughters and one son.

MR. JAMES WORTHINGTON.
301 miles from Brisbane, is the
eldest son of the late James Worth-

named property. He was born in
the year 1874, at the seaport town

of Gladstone, Queensland, where his
father was well known as one of the
leading commercial men of the place.
The late James Worthington was a
native of Lancashire, England, the
date of his birth being 1827. He
was trained for the profession of an
engineer, and for a number of years
was connected with the work of the
great north-western railways in
England. At the age of 37 he came
to Australia, with the intention of
embarking on the calling of a
grazier, and for the purpose of mak-
ing himself acquainted with the con-
ditions of the country of his adop-
tion, he obtained employment on
“Toweran” and other stations,
where he continued until he had
achieved his object. Subsequently
he established a butchering business
at Gladstone, and at a later date
extended his operations to Hew
Caledonia, to which country he regu-
larly shipped large numbers of fat
bullocks. He maintained his own
steam launch in the interests of the
business, and the trim little craft
dashing about the Bay of Gladstone
became a very familiar sight to the
residents of the town. In 1874 he
found himself in a position to realize
the ambition which first had
prompted him to leave his native
land for the wide and unde-
veloped tracts of Britain’s overseas
dominions, and his decision being
made to take up a tract of land
for grazing purposes, he forthwith
acquired 50 square miles of the wild
coastal bush country near Gladstone,
out of which he successfully formed
the prosperous station, which has
since descended to his son and
partner. The country chosen proved
well suited for stock, being heavily
grassed, and timbered with blood-
wood, spotted gum, and other valu-
able timbers; while undulating in

character, it has a distinguishing
feature in the ironbark ridges which
occur very frequently throughout
its extent. By its position it en-
circles Rodd Harbour, and is
scarred with tidal creeks,
which abound in fish,
oysters, prawns, etc., and
its vicinity to Bustard
Head, where Captain Cook
landed, gives it some his-
toric interest. Upon taking
up this country the late
Mr. Worthington erected
the present homestead,
which still is in an excel-
lent state of preservation,
and straightway entered
upon the work of improve-
ment. For this purpose he
was fortunate in being able
to command practically
unlimited black labour,
the district being largely
populated with aboriginals
who, on account of the
abundance of fish, oysters,
and game of all sorts, gave
very little trouble to tire
white settlers, and generally were
found willing to work for a small
wage. The late Mr. Worthington
built up his enterprise, undeterred by


the obstacles and setbacks, which, in
common with other pioneers, he was
called upon to endure, and at the
time of his death, which occurred in
MR. W. V. WORTHINGTON’S MOTOR LAUNCH, "WAVE,” 20 H.P.
1906, he was one of the best-known
men throughout the northern dis-
tricts. He was connected with most
of the local organizations, having
held among other offices that of Past
Grand Master of the Masonic Lodge.
He was married at Rock-
hampton in the year 1873
to Caroline, daughter of
Lieutenant Perry, by whom
he had a family of six
children. His eldest son,
Mr. William Valentine
Worthington, received his
education under private
tuition on his father’s sta-
tion, where he spent the
whole of his boyhood years.
Sport during this time
played an important part
in his life, and he became
an adept in shooting, fish-
ing, and boating, also as
time went on taking a
hand in mustering the
cattle and in the general
work of the station. Mr.
Worthington’s mother, a
delicately-nurtured woman,
was resident on the pro-
perty in the pioneering era,
when for the period of seven
years she never saw another white
woman. It is interesting to note in
passing that this lady returned to
Australia in 1917 after an extended

The country has been the scene of a
considerable amount of improvement
work, and besides carrying some
4,000 head of cattle, affords
pasturage for 80 head of
horses, and a small flock
of about 200 crossbred
sheep, which have thriven
well in the vicinity. Mr.
Worthington has followed
in his father’s footsteps,
and is distinguished for the
interest he takes in mat-
ters of local importance,
being regarded as an
authority on the affairs
of the district. He cordi-
ally identifies himself with
various organizations, giv-

member for some con-

of aquatic pursuits, and

with a 20 - horsepower
engine, which is able to
make the trip to Glad-
stone in three hours. This vessel is
also the means of providing con-

ceeded to take up their residence

journey was made by sea, in a steam
launch called “The Wave,” all re-
quisites for the station having to
be brought from Gladstone in the

man settled on the Hunter River,

where he engaged in grazing pur-
suits, to which were afterwards
added mixed farming and viticul-
ture. Shortly after arriving he
married a lady who had been a
fellow-passenger on board the boat
by which he had voyaged from the Old
Country, and his family of seven
sons and four daughters were all
born upon the “New Freugh”
estate. Mr. P. J. C. McDouall re-
ceived his primary education in
New South Wales under tutors,
subsequently attending a private
school until he reached the age of
15. He then became associated with
his father on the home farm, and
as years went on took over full
control of the property, making a
special feature in his administration
of the cultivation of lucerne, which
he grew with considerable success.
After the demise of the late Mr.
McDouall in 1891, the gentleman
under review continued the manage-
ment on behalf of his brothers and
sisters, all of whom had been left
an interest in the estate. In 1906
the property was sold, and the pro-
ceeds divided, and Mr. P. J. C.
McDouall went into partnership
with Mr. J. L. Wilson in the pur-
chase of “Calliope” Station, Queens-
land. “Calliope” was then in the
hands of Mr. J. Thomson. The new
owners at once proceeded upon a
vigorous plan of development. The
property, which is situated on the
Calliope River, embraces 21,673
acres of freehold, together with
leasehold totalling 34,000 acres.
Large sums of money have been laid
out by the management upon the
improvement of the country, especi-
ally over the freehold area, where
it is estimated that over £,\ sterling
to the acre has been spent, with
highly satisfactory results. “Calli-
ope” Station is a valuable grazing
property, the country being undulat-
ing in character, and of granite
formation, interspersed with a little
basalt, with a fertile soil favourable
to the growth of nutritious indigen-
ous grasses. It is used by Messrs.
Wilson and McDouall principally for
stockraising purposes, the herd con-
sisting of from 2,000 to 4,000 head
of cattle of the shorthorn and Here-
ford types. Cultivation, however, is
carried on to some extent, and to
the proprietors of “Calliope” Sta-
tion is given credit of being prac-
tically the pioneers in this district
to introduce the local production of
maize and lucerne and other popular
fodders. From 300 to 400 acres are
usually devoted to cropping for
greenfeed and ensilage, which is
greedily sought after by the stock.
The whole of the property has
been ringbarked, which has added
considerably to the carrying capacity
of the land, and among other
improvement work the erection of

DUNCAN URQUHART, “Fair-
view,” Banana, owner of “Har-
court,” “Denby,” “Black Downs,”
and “Salisbury” Stations, in the
same district. These properties,
which all lie within the Port Curtis
division of the State of Queensland,
conjointly embrace a total of 257
miles, and are devoted entirely
to cattle-grazing. “Harcourt,” the
earliest holding acquired by Mr.
Urquhart, was founded by him as
a sheep run in 1872, but after a
seven-years’ trial it was found to be
unsuitable for that purpose, partly
on account of the spear grass which
largely prevailed, and partly as a
result of the frequent floods in the
Dawson River, upon which stream
the station is situated. Accordingly
in 1879 Mr. Urquhart disposed of
his flocks, and purchased from Mr.
Bell, of “Stowe” Station, near
Gladstone (his former employer), a
draft of shorthorn cattle, which
upon being introduced to the “Har-
court” pastures throve satisfactorily.
Some years later young stud Here-
ford bulls and heifers were procured
from “Braeside,” on the New South
Wales border of Queensland, and
during the decades which have since
elapsed the “Harcourt” Herefords
have become very widely known
and now enjoy the reputation of
being one of the finest herds in the
State. The country on “Harcourt”
Station consists of ojaen river flats,
succeeded by belts of brigalow scrub,
which give way to lightly-timbered
undulating stretches of country,
lying well back from the river
frontage. The holding has an excel-
lent water supply in the fine stream
of the Dawson, while in the portions
remote from the river there are huge
lagoons, which have never been
known to fail. Under the Lands Act
of 1884, smaller settlers began to
exercise the right of selecting coun-
try in the sixrrounding area, and
Mr. Urquhart found it necessary to
fence his run as the boundaries of
the smaller holdings were defined.
Later he acquired a second property,
known as “Denby,” on the other
side of the Dawson, directly oppo-
site the “Harcourt” area. This
station, which comprised 26 square
miles of country, very closely re-
sembling “Harcourt” in its general
characteristics, was also stocked with
cattle, the two properties being
worked conjointly by Mr. Urquhart.
A further addition was made to his
landed estate when “Fairview,”
where he now resides, came into
Mr. Urquhart’s possession by pur-
chase from Mr. Hugh Mathieson,
the former owner. This property
consists of 84 miles of country,
watered by the Banana Creek, which
has some good reaches of permanent
water, one of these, over a mile in
length, never having been known
to lower its level, even in the most
severe drought. Bores have also
been put down at the back of the
run, and these, fitted with the
necessary pumping apparatus, afford
an ample supply of water at all
seasons. Mr, Urquhart also owns the
“Salisbury” property, in the same
district, and in 1915 he further ex-
tended the scope of his operations
by purchasing from Mr. Norton, of
“Emerald” Station, a place called
“Black Downs,” situated on the
MR. DUNCAN URQUHART.
heights of Expedition Range. This
is a splendidly-watered holding, 87
miles in extent, where the fertile
black soil which is characteristic of
the district produces a prolific
growth of natural grasses and herb-
age. The total area owned by Mr.
Urquhart has a carrying capacity of
over 8,000 head of cattle, but at the
present time (1917) not one of the
runs is fully stocked, 3,000 represent-
ing approximately the strength of the
herds on all the stations. The ups
and downs common to all pastoral
enterprise have not been escaped by
the sister properties, and from
time to time losses have been sus-
tained from varying causes. The
tick pest appeared on “Harcourt”
and “Denby” at the time when the
greater part of Queensland was suf-
fering from the same visitation, and
in addition to the losses then in-
curred by Mr. Urquhart, a few hun-
dred head of his stock also suc-
cumbed to red-water. To minimize
the risk of loss from these causes,
he first gave his attention to the
construction of dips, but found
considerable difficulty in securing a
water-tight trough under the ordin-
ary methods of construction. Even-
tually he hit upon the expedient of
laying down a dip made entirely of
iron, riveted after the fashion of
boiler plates, at a cost of TlOO.
Strange to say, since the completion
of this expensive improvement no
occasion for dipping has occurred
on any of the runs, and this dip has
never been brought into use. Against
red-water Mr. Urquhart has re-
sorted to inoculation, with very
great success. The big drought of
1902, which descended over Queens-
land with devastating results and
decimating many of the largest
flocks and herds in the State, treated
“Harcourt” and “Denby” lightly
in comparison with many other pro-
perties. Out of the 5,000 head of
cattle Mr. Urquhart was successful
in saving 2,000, which he justly
considered a notable achievement,
judging by the small salvage effected
by some of his fellow-pastoralists.
In normal seasons the herd numbers
between 4,000 and 5,000, besides
which there are about 200 horses,
but the drought of 1914-15 reduced
the cattle by 1,700 head and
the horses to 60. Mr. Duncan
Urquhart’s career has not been lack-
ing in elements of romance, and his
reminiscences are racy and full of
interest. Born in 1836, he is (1917)
in his eighty-first year, and can look
back upon a long life of honest effort
and strenuous work, which in due
time brought its own substantial
reward. His native place was “Glen
Harcourt,” Invernesshire, Scotland,
and he is the only son of his
father, the late Andrew Urquhart,
whose calling was that of a shep-
herd in the Highlands of Rosshire.
As the lad grew up he became as
familiar with the haunts and habits
of the flock as the older man, who
made a constant companion and
assistant of his son. Mr. Urquhart
continued in this employment until
his twenty-fifth year, when he de-
cided to come to Australia, his
parents consenting to this step on
account of the high-spirited dispo-
sition manifested by the young man,


who could rarely resist the tempta-
tion of a pot-shot at the fine deer
which roamed over the property of
the laird of Gairloch. in whose
employ his father was shepherd
Accordingly, in 1861 he sailed by
the “Persia,” a large, three-masted
sailing vessel, which took four
months and three days to accom-
plish the voyage to the antipodes.
Arriving by this boat at Port Cur-
tis, Queensland, Mr. Urquhart cut
a resplendent figure in his native
Highland costume, which he was
accustomed to wear as his ordinary
dress, and which, it may be men-
tioned in passing, he only discarded
in favour of trousers after he had
been 18 mouths in the colony. With
two other young Scotsmen, similarly
conclusion arrived at was that he
was not a “white mary,” i.e.,
woman, but “close up to it.’’
Upon reaching “Stowe” Mr. Urqu-
hart and one of the other young
men, J. Mclntosh by name, were
given a hut together and entrusted
with the charge of a flock of sheep.
When taking these out to the graz-
ing run Mr. Urquhart saw his first
emu, and decided from its appear-
ance that it was a wingless bird. He
set off to chase the novel biped, and
followed it for hours, losing his be-
loved “dirk” in the chase, and
incidentally losing himself for some
hours, only with considerable diffi-
culty finding Mclntosh and the sheep
again late in the day. Another of his
adventures was of a decidedly painful
rescue his garments when the hor-
nets had retired, satisfied with their
victory. Early in 1862 he decided
to bring his parents and only sister
out to the glorious, sunny land
which he found so congenial, and
seeking the advice of his employer
(Mr. Bell) in regard to the matter
of securing passages, be was invited
by the latter to accompany him to
Sydney, whither he was bound for
the purpose of disposing of his
season’s wool clip. The young
Scotsman could scarcely speak a
word of English, and his Gaelic was
incomprehensible to most of those
with whom he came in contact. Mr.
Bell therefore very kindly took upon
himself the business of arranging for
Mr. Urquhart’s passage by the

attired, he readily attracted the
attention of the late Mr. Bell, of
“Stowe” Station, who had rowed
out to the ship in the hope of secur-
ing some Scotch immigrants as
station hands, and the three burly,
kilted shepherds were immediately
engaged by that gentleman, with
whom they left the boat to proceed
direct to the station. On the way
thither they encountered hundreds
of aboriginals, who at the sight of
them evidently launched out into
a sharp argument, which developed
almost into a fight. Mr. Bell ex-
plained that the point under dis-
cussion was whether Mr. Urquhart
was a man or a woman, his hairy
face denoting the male sex, while his
skirt proclaimed him a female. The
character. He had been told that
the wild bees of Australia were quite
harmless and their honey very good ;
and one day seeing what he took to
be a fine large nest of bees on the
limb of a tree, about 10 feet from
the ground, he determined to sample
the product for himself. Taking off
his boots, he climbed the tree,
crawled along the limb, and put his
hand in the nest, only to discover
that he had disturbed a nest of
hornets ! These strongly objected to
the intrusion, and fiercely attacked
him, both on the face and beneath
the kilt. Mr. Urquhart fell to the
ground, with numbers of the irri-
tated insects clinging to him, and
flinging off kilt and jacket, he ran
for his life, only returning later to
“Star of Peace,” then lying in Port
Jackson, and also secured passages
for his parents and sister to return
with him from Scotland. Young
Urquhart, after paying £3O for his
passage, was presented by Mr. Bell
with £2O in cash, which he grate-
fully accepted, inwardly resolving
that his generous employer should
sometime be repaid. Armed with
the precious tickets for his family,
he reached the shores of Britain in
about three months’ time, and
immediately set out for his home in
the Highlands. His relatives were
overwhelmed with surprise and
pleasure at his return, and gladly
fell in with his plans. He had left a
sweetheart in Scotland, who showed
much distress at the prospect


of being left alone once more,
that, urged by his father, he decided
to make her one of the party, and
accordingly brought out a wife on
his second trip to Australia. Arriv-
ing at Brisbane by the “Norman
Morison,” the party travelled to
“Stowe” Station, where the whole
family entered into Mr. Bell’s ser-
vice early in 1864. Two years late
Mr. Bell’s death occurred, and the
administration of affairs fell into
the hands of his son, who shared
the good opinion formed by his
father in respect to Mr. Urquhart’s
management of the sheep and the
attention given by him to his
employer’s interests. Some three
pastured on “Stowe” Station, were
shorn by Mr. Bell’s men, and the
wool was marketed with that from
the station shed. In 1872 Mr. Bell
again sent for his trusted man and
said: “The sheep have increased to
7,000 head, and you have a credit
in cash with me for £212, clear of
the cost of your sheep and the ex-
penses of shearing and marketing.
I have not room on ‘Stowe’ for so
large a number. Take John Fin-
layson, your brother-in-law, and
your father to' look after your flocks,
and select land for yourself. I will
let Finlayson and your father out
of my service, so that you will have
their good help; and good luck go
Scottish shepherd’s first bid for
fortune by independent enterprise.
For many years after that period
Mr. Urquhart’s whole time and
attention were fully occupied in the
building up of the enterprise whicli
had been launched under such satis-
factory auspices, and the success
that attended his efforts has been
well-deserved. Stone by stone was
added to the fabric of his prosperity,
and now, in the winter of his days,
he enjoys the peace and leisure
which a well-spent life has brought.

years afterwards he sent for the
Scotsman one day, and addressed
him in the following commendatory
ters: “Urquhart, you have been a
good man on Stowe, and I know
what my father intended to do for
you before he died. T am going
to do it now. There are 1,800 ewes
in that yard, and sufficient rams for
the flock. They are yours. Take
them and run them on my country
until they shall have increased and
made some money for you.” Mr.
Urquhart with much gratitude
accepted this generous gift, and for
the next few years the sheep

saddled his horse and pack-horses,
and pushed out to the north-west,
towards Banana, and thence west-
wards in the direction of the Daw-
son River. Here his gaze fell on the
country out of which he afterwards
formed his “Harcourt” Station, and
returning to Mr. Bell at “Stowe,”
he arranged for bullock teams to
transport his family and household
goods to their new home. The sheep
and some cattle were travelled to
“Harcourt,” and in a few weeks
had settled down contentedly on the
pastures which were the scene of the

WILLIAM SCOTT, J.P., owner
of “Glenmoral” Station, situated on
the Dawson River, was born on
October 15, 1827, at Broomie Hill,
Flex, near Hawick, Scotland, and is
a son of the late James Scott, of
Roxburghshire. He springs from a
very old family, the earliest records
of which relate to a William Scott,
of “Branxholme,” a place men-
tioned in “The Lay of the Last
Minstrel” by Sir Walter Scott, who
was himself a member of the connec-
tion. A certain John Scott, when
hunting with King Malcolm of
Scotland, killed a deer in the chase,
and picking it up, carried it on his
shoulders to the king, to whom he
presented it. The king knighted him
as Sir John Scott, of Buccleuch,
bestowing upon him a territory, and
subsequently the family was elevated
to the peerage, with a dukedom.
Mr. Scott, of “Glenmoral,” is
descended from a branch of the
family, the members of which for
generations have farmed land owned
by the Duke of Buccleuch. Mr.
William Scott’s father, who held the
“Newstead Mill” Farm on the
estate, was responsible for the form-
ation of the first Farmers’ Club, at
Melrose, in the year 1830. The
gentleman under review received his
education at the latter place, and
when he attained the age of 21 years
his father took for him on lease the
“Greenwell’s Farm,” Roxburghshire,
where he continued to live until
1863. “Greenwells Mansion” form-
erly had been the residence of Mr.
Gilbert Elliot (afterwards Speaker
of the first Parliament of Queens-
land), who rented the farm from
the Duke of Buccleuch. In 1863,
when Mr. Scott’s lease expired, he
sailed for Queensland in the vessel
“The Flying Cloud,” and arrived
at his destination on February 20,
1864, after a slow passage. The ship
was becalmed in the tropics for a
fortnight, and when at length a
breeze sprang up they had to sail
down to the 45th degree of latitude
in order to obtain the advantage of
the trade winds. At this extreme
point they sighted large numbers of
icebergs. Upon arrival at Brisbane
Mr. Scott presented a letter of intro-
duction to the then Speaker of the
House of Assembly, the Hon.
Gilbert Elliot, from his brother,
Admiral Elliot, a staunch friend of
the Scott family, and a very warm
welcome was accorded the new
arrival. He was introduced to some
of the leading pioneers of the
period, with whom he discussed his
prospects. Among Mr. Scott’s ship-
mates was a Captain Eyre, who
came to Queensland for the benefit
of his health. Mr. Scott and he had
foregathered much on the voyage
out, and as he was more or less an
invalid, Mr. Scott often dropped in
for a chat with him. One day the
captain said, “I hear there are two
newly - imported bulls down in
McAdam’s stables; you should have
a look at them.” By a curious coin-
cidence Mr. Scott found these to be

two shorthorns he had seen at the
Highland Society’s show, Kelso,
just before he left Scotland, where
they had gained first and second
prizes in their class. At the
stables he met the owner, a Mr.
Stenhouse, who offered Mr. Scott a
position as jackaroo, without salary
or travelling expenses. Accepting
the offer, Mr, Scott accompanied
Mr. Stenhouse to “Niall” Station,
on Clarke’s Creek, a tributary of
the Burdekin River, the journey
being made in the “Diamantina.”
Besides the bulls, a fine Collie dog,
a dray and a pair of horses were
shipped. The vessel called at Rock-
hampton, and at Mackay and
Bowen, then very primitive towns,
the journey by water ending about
2 miles up the Burdekin. After con-
siderable trouble the bulls and other
cargo were safely landed, and a start
made for the station, Mr. Stenhouse
driving the dray, Mr. Scott leading
one of the shorthorns, and a boy the
other. The journey of 170 miles to
“Niall” was completed without mis-
hap, about six weeks from the time
of departure from Brisbane. Mr.
Scott was given charge of the
imported bulls and other stock, and
sent to an out-station on Christmas
Creek, about 30 miles from the head
station. One of the bulls was a
vicious beast, and when going on
foot for his horse, which was always
kept hobbled, he had to be careful
to keep out of sight of the beast.
At this time the blacks were causing
considerable trouble in the dis-
trict, and Mr. Scott believes that
his freedom from molestation was
due to the natives’ fear of this
vicious animal. Though he rode
unarmed when tending the stock,
Mr. Scott was well provided with
firearms, having two rifles and a
shot-gun. Returning one evening,
he perceived marks of horses’ hoofs
near the hut, and upon entering
found that all his firearms had dis-
appeared. Jumping on his horse, he
followed the tracks, and eventually
came up with his quarry, which
proved to be a party of drovers over-
landing 1,000 head of cattle to new
country on the Gulf for Mr. J. G.
Macdonald. The drovers had been
attacked early in the morning of the
day they took the firearms, and the
blacks had scattered the cattle and
robbed the camp of all its equip-
ment. After some parleying Mr.
Scott was successful in getting back
his rifles, the shot-gun being pur-
chased by the drovers. After re-
maining on Mr. Stenhouse’s pro-
perty for 12 months, Mr. Scott re-
turned to Brisbane, where he met
a Mr. Turnbull, whom he had
known in Scotland, and who owned
a station on the Dawson River
known as “Bundi.” He engaged
himself to the gentleman at £1 per
week, and in 1865 proceeded to
“Bundi,” shortly afterwards going
to “Mitchell Downs” Station, where
he assumed control of the sheep-
washing department of the shearing
operations. Returning to “Bundi,”


he was entrusted with the task of
overlanding 2,000 wethers to Ips-
wich, where they were sold by
auction, this being the first lot of
sheep to pass through the public
yards. This was in 1866. Mr. Scott
remained at “Bundi” Station for
some considerable time, during
which he obtained an excellent
acquaintance with the methods of
sheepraising under Australian con-
ditions. Subsequently he transferred
his services to “Redford” Station,
the property of
the late W.
.Miles, then Mi-
nister for Rail-
ways in Queens-
land, and con-
tinued there as
manager until
October, 1867.
Leaving “Led-
ford,” he was
employed for
some time on
“Isla” Station,
on the Dawson,
and at a later
date took charge
of the sheep-
washing at Mrs.
McNab’s “Ki-
anga” Station,
now the pro-
perty of the
Sutherland fam-
ily. Mrs.McNab
asked him to
go to “Minnie
Downs” for 300
rams which had
been sent there
for sale two
years before,
but had not
been sold. Mr.
Scott disposed
of 50 of the
rams, and hav-
ing satisfactor-
ily arranged the
business, he was
offered the man-
agement of “Ki-
anga.” Under the previous manage-
ment the station had incurred a debt
of £lO,OOO, but by the exercise of
economy and strenuous exertion Mr.
Scott was successful in reducing this
debt by half. Wise expenditure was
a part of his policy, and in many
instances he instituted up-to-date
methods on the station, one of his
improvements being the putting
down of a sheep-washing pool,
fitted with hot water pipes, by which
the temperature of the water could

be raised to 102°. A good clip was
returned, and the wool upon being
marketed in London realized the
satisfactory amount of £5,000.
Being unable to obtain a better
price than ss. per head for 2,000
fat wethers, Mr. Scott determined
to keep them for another year.
Meanwhile he put them to the
shears, the wool realizing £9OO,
and subsequently the sheep were
sold, realizing 7s. per head. With
the proceeds of this transaction Mr.
Scott purchased cattle from Mrs.
McNab. In 1872 he bought "Glen-
moral” from the late Mr. Mayne, of
"Ghinghinda” Station, the property
having a 19-years’ lease still to run,
and two years later he severed his
connection with "Kianga,” and has
since devoted his time and attention
exclusively to the administration of
his own estate. The property at the
time of purchase embraced 30 square
miles of available country, in addi-
tion to large areas of scrub which

understood to be auxiliary to the
more profitable tracts of land,
Heavily-timbered ranges of hills
were varied by stretches of brigalow
scrub, and a fairly good water supply
was provided by natural creeks and
lagoons. The question of water con-
servation has received much atten-
tion from Mr. Scott and his sons,
and at present there are from 8 to 10
wells and bores on the estate,
which provide
an abundant
supply of ex-

topped the London market in 1912,
the whole clip being sold at 14d. per

founded mainly with “Rawbelle”
cattle, purebred herd bulls having
been secured from that estate in the
eighties and again in the nineties.

The herd was further improved in

on the station, and in 1914 two fine
bulls, "Prince Warrion” and “Lord

tion, were purchased at 32 and 110
guineas respectively, while later
purchases in “Maroon’s Duke of
York” and “Ringleader” have still
further enhanced the prestige of the
stud. “Prince Warrion” and “Lord
Cambridge” were both sired by

being “White Rose” by “Earl of

are now (1917) in train to have the
pedigreed stud shorthorns at “Glen-
moral” included in the herd-book
of the society. It is worthy of men-
tion that in 1917 a Government
cattle expert visited “Glenmoral”
and purchased five bulls at 30
guineas each for a stud herd which
is being formed for State purposes.
It speaks volumes for the “Glen-
moral” herd that these were selected
from the cattle bred on the run
before the introduction of the
“Maroon” bulls, the superiority of
this herd over that of ordinary
station cattle being thus very clearly
demonstrated. Mr. Scott has won
a well-deserved reputation for the
keen interest he takes in stock, and
for his excellent powers of discrim-
ination with regard to their value
and qualities, and in earlier days he
acted as judge of shorthorn cattle at
the National Show in conjunction
with-Messrs Mant and Johnson, of

RAWDON BENTLEY BRIGGS,
of “Swindon” Station, Burnett dis-
trict, is the eldest surviving son of
Rawdon Briggs, shipowner and mer-
chant, of Hull and Wakefield, York-
shire, England, and a freeman of the
former city. Rawdon Briggs was the
son of the late Harrison Briggs,
whose father, John Briggs, married
Mary, elder daughter of Christopher
Rawdon, of Billborough, the last-
mentioned, born 1690, being the fifth
in descent of the name and place, and
sheriff of Yorkshire in 1739-40. His
grandsons and grandsons-in-law were
the chief founders of Briggs’ Bank
in Halifax, Yorkshire, during the
latter part of the eighteenth century,
the original partners in this enter-
prise being Mr. Briggs’ great-uncle,
Rawdon Briggs, D.L., and Messrs.
Rawson, Rhodes, and Ralph. Owing
to the financial upheaval in the early
portion of the nineteenth century
this firm became one of the first to
take advantage of the Joint Stock
Companies Act, after the Battle of
Waterloo, and was converted into
the Halifax and Huddersfield Bank-
ing Company. Mr. R. B. Briggs’
mother was Esther Mary Holme®,

daughter of Thomas Holmes, of

Sheriff in 1810. The subject of this

notice received his early education
at the West Riding Proprietary
School, Wakefield, and afterwards
at Exley’s School, which school and
he was placed with a tutor at Bath,
with the object in view of entering the
Foreign Office, for which he was pro-
mised a nomination, but eventually
abandoned this intention in favour
of a commercial career. He gained
his first experience of office life with
the firm of John W. Carter, Son, and
Company, Limited, of Liverpool,
and Mincing Lane, London, but be-
fore the completion of his term
obtained release from his indentures
for the purpose of joining his elder
brother, William, and a friend, who
had sailed for Australia with the
intention of pioneering the cotton-
growing industry in Queensland.
Mr. Briggs took passage on Septem-
ber 10, 1861, by the “City of Bris-
bane,” a boat bound for Moreton
Bay, which destination was reached
in April, 1862, his party including
three farm servants, whose passages
were paid by Messrs. W. and R.
Briggs. Upon arrival he found that
the vessel by which his brother had
sailed had not yet come into port,
and rather than wait in idleness he
took one of his men, an old family
servant, and assisted to clear the
first scrub ever felled on Oxley
Creek, after which he was engaged
in fencing on the Ipswich Road until

placed at Mr. William Briggs’ dis-
posal for the purpose of selecting
suitable land for the object the
brothers had in view. After some
three weeks’ search this was satis-
factorily secured, a site on the then
unsettled lower reaches of the North
Pine River being chosen, which pro-
mised admirably to answer the pur-
pose for which it was required. The
ground first was cleared and cotton
was planted on the holding at a cost
of about £35 per acre, to which was
given the name of “Berrimbah
(aboriginal for “present place”).
Just, however, as a most magnificent
growth was showing on the planta-
tion and the picking of the crop was
about to commence, the too-frequent
reward of the pioneer was accorded
Mr. Briggs, a flood sweeping down
the river and overwhelming the
crop, which was covered to a depth
of several feet—a calamity which,
needless to say, proved the death-
blow of the enterprise. It may be
interesting to note in passing that
that plantation was situated about
38 miles from Brisbane town, on the
old Northern Road, and a friend
and neighbour, Mr. Thomas Petrie,
of “Murrumba,” who had been set-
tled higher up the river for 18
months previously, becoming con-
vinced that a shorter route to the
metropolis could be discovered,
volunteered to lead a party to recon-
noitre the country, with the desired
result. To effect the making of the
new track, which reduced the dis-
tance to under 18 miles, each set-
tler sent a couple of hands, and it
may be stated that the present line
of railway, which was constructed 30
years later, runs alongside this track.
Mr. Petrie was well known as an
explorer, and in 1862, at the request
of Governor Bowen, he undertook an
expedition to open up the timber
and other resources of the North
Coast towards Double Island Point.
For the supply of this expedition Mr.
Briggs was asked by Mr. Tom Petrie
to join him in bringing up a load
of stores in his whaleboat from Bris-
bane, and after a rough, wet pas-
sage, and upon completing the for-
ward voyage, he was the guest of
his friend’s father, Mr. Andrew
Petrie, one of Queensland’s oldest
pioneers, who recounted to him
many interesting stories of the
earliest days, this intercourse being
esteemed a high privilege by the
younger man. After the disastrous
flood referred to, leaving his brother
to wind up the affairs of the planta-
tion, Mr. Briggs decided to move
farther afield, and with a liberal ( !)
equipment, consisting of the horse
he rode, a blanket strapped in front,
and eight sovereigns, in January,
1864, he sallied forth from Ipswich.
Upon the subsidence of the waters,
which had converted the road to the
19-mile stage into an almost impass-
able bog, continuing on his way, he
encountered a stranger on horseback,
who proved to be Mr. Arthur Wein-
holt, travelling from “Fassifern”
Station. In the course of conversa-
tion, Mr. Weinholt enquired the
locality whence Mr. Briggs had come
and whither he was bound, receiving
as answer, “Anywhere to make a
living.” His companion thereupon
stated that he was on his way to
join his brother Edward at Jon-
daryan, on the Darling Downs,
whence it was their intention to
proceed to the Western district to
stock up a run, and he extended a
cordial invitation to Mr. Briggs to
throw in his lot with them. This
offer was accepted, and thus was
formed the beginning of a friend-
ship of years, continuing until Mr.
Weinholt left the colony. In 1866
Mr. Briggs was offered pastoral in-
spection work on contract from
Messrs. Bright Bros. & Co., on
behalf of the Trust and Agency
Co. of Australasia, which eventu-
ated some twelve months later
in his permanent appointment
as pastoral inspector for the com-
pany for Queensland —the first per-
manent appointment of the kind,
Mr. Briggs believes, ever made in
Australia. About 1869 his duties
took him to “Havilah,” on the
Bowen River, which property he
disposed of to a Mr. Henderson, of
Ballarat, Victoria. The country
here was inhabited by aboriginal
tribes of exceptionally fine physique,
who lived in their primitive state,
adhering to their own manners and
customs. Upon one occasion, when
riding for his mail to the main road
up the river, some five miles distant
from the station homestead, Mr.
Briggs, in following the track, which
led over a dry, winding creek or
billabong, in a zigzag direction,
noticed in the bed of the billabong
numerous fresh tracks, indicating
that the blacks were hunting in the
adjoining scrub. Crossing the river

and obtaining his mail, upon the
return journey he came upon a
hunting net stretched across the bil-
labong-bed, and recognizing in this
a device of the natives to entrap him
he made a detour up the high left-
hand bank, whence he saw that the
other bend of the billabong was


similarly netted. Increasing his pace
to a hard gallop, he struck the road
about 100 yards further on, and in
his rear saw some 50 to 80 blacks,
armed with spears and waddies,

running parallel with the road on the
edge of the scrub on either side.
Mr. Briggs kept his horse moving at
just sufficient pace to prevent the
runners from converging, and for-
tunately succeeded in reaching home
safely. Subsequently, after confer-
ring with the manager of the run,
they came to the conclusion that this
attempt was in reprisal for some act
of injustice perpetrated against
them by some neighbouring or dis-
tant settlers, since no other attempt
had been made to interfere with the
working of the station since “Havi-
lah” had been founded some four or
five years previously. Deciding on a
policy of conciliation, Mr. Briggs
directed the station hands to kill
a bullock and, in company with a
stockman, sought the native camp
and invited some of the blacks to
come in and receive the carcase, at
the same time making it clear that
they were not at liberty to approach
the homestead proper under any cir-
cumstances. This course proved
completely successful, and during
his six or seven months’ residence at
“Havilah,” despite the fact that
adjacent stations lost several shep-
herds by murder, no further trouble
was experienced on account of the
aboriginals on the station. He re-
mained in the employ of the Trust
and Agency Company for about
eight years, and subsequently, after
an interval of about two years,
spent in the working and extension
of a sugar plantation on the Lower
Herbert River, in 1876 he made a
decision to start on his own account
in the pastoral industry. With this
end in view he selected the property,
to which he gave the name of
“Oakfield,” on the Boonara Creek;
but finding the purchase of stores,
etc., a matter of much difficulty,
necessitating very long journeys, he
ultimately decided to try another
venture. In partnership with the
late Honourable Peter Macpberson,
M.L.C., he purchased the Crown

from the late H. D. Caswell,

Mr. Macpherson for about four
years, when a dissolution was
effected. Mr. Briggs pursued the
development of the proposition, but
encountering a period of untoward
vicissitudes, which played havoc
generally with the prosperity of the
pastoral industry in Queensland, he
found himself in such a position as
to call for the surrender of all his
worldly goods to his bankers, with
the exception of a few personal
effects, buggies, horses, furniture,
etc., and about £BO in cash. Mr.
Briggs walked out of “Tenninger-
ing” owing no man aught—a cir-
cumstance revealing clearly the
character of the man and the pre-
dominance in him of those prin-
ciples of integrity and honour which
govern the actions of the finer type
of man. During his tenure of this
property his sons had selected the
block of land out of which, by de-
grees, with his co-operation, they
formed the “Swindon” run, in the
original instance only the nucleus
of the present fine area of some
60,000 to 70,000 acres, inclusive of
all the family holdings, being taken
up by them. “Swindon,” which
now embraces most of the resumed
portions of the original pastoral
leases of “Tenningering” and
“Yenda” (Mingo), is situated about
four miles, as the crow flies, from
the old homestead of the former sta-
tion, and at that early period had
been stocked with from 200 to 300
head of cattle, in addition to which
500 bullocks had been purchased
with a legacy received by Mrs.
Briggs from England, which were
placed on agistment with her brother-
in-law, Mr. H. L. Lawless Pvne, of


“Cloyne.” These bullocks, which
were purchased at a cost of £1 per
head in 1899 were sold at Enoggera
during the course of the following
18 months at six to eight guineas
per head—in those days considered
an excellent price. The profits re-
sulting from these sales made pos-
sible the acquirement of country
adjacent to the original selection, and
as this extension was utilized for the
pasturage of additional stock, and
the returns from the regular de-
velopment work grew larger, still
more country was taken up, and in
course of time the station assumed
its present dimensions. By compari-
son with the rich lands of the Bur-
nett basin and the headwaters of the
Perry, the region is somewhat poor,
securely fenced with two barbed
wires and one plain, the main part
of the boundary fences being
threaded with three barbed wires.
About 200 miles of fencing have been
completed, and 20,000 acres have
been brought under the ringbarkers’
axe, the balance of the uncleared
land being taken in hand systematic-
ally. The run is provided with three
drafting yards, situated in conveni-
ent centres, and the presence of a
similar number of cattle-dips on the
property removes the necessity for
driving the stock the long distances
which is so detrimental to their
well-being. The cattle on “Swin-
don” are shorthorns, the nucleus
of the herd having been formed with

tion, one of the explorers and
earliest settlers of this day. The

but as an offset against the less
fertile nature of the soil, the locality
is an exceedingly healthy one and
provides excellent breeding country.
It embraces the steep and rugged
upper spurs of the main range
dividing the waters of the Perry and
Burnett Rivers, with some good
flats intervening on the south. On
the north the country is high, with
a salubrious climate, and is mainly
timbered with ironbark, gum, and
bloodwood. On some of the spurs
the soil is very fertile, and the creek
frontages are heavily grassed with
couch and other fattening herbage,
making fine pasture for stock. The

prevalent climatic conditions. Mr.
Briggs has taken a keen interest in
local government, and since the in-
ception of the Divisional Boards Act
of 1879 until three years ago he
served continuously as councillor;
while upon the conversion of the
boards into shires in 1903 he filled
the office of first chairman of the

RICHARD RAWDON BRIGGS,
“Darfield,” Wetheron, was born at
Bowen Terrace, Brisbane, in the
year 1871, and is the second son of
Mr. Rawdon Bentley Briggs, of
“Swindon” Station. He was taken
to the Burnett district by his
parents when he had reached the
age of six, and received his educa-
tion at the Maryborough Grammar
School, upon the completion of his
scholastic course at 17 years of age
returning to the paternal rooftree
to assist his father in the manage-
ment of “Oakfield” cattle station,
where he laid the foundation of a
thorough knowledge of stock, par-
ticularly of cattle-raising in its
various departments. In 1900, in
conjunction with his father and
brother (Mr. Rawdon Briggs, jun.),
he took up the country now known
as “Swindon,” which in earlier
days formed a portion of the old
“Tenningering” Station, the latter
—which was well known as one of
the immense stock runs of a very
early period—having originally
comprised an area of some 200
square miles. When the “Swindon”
country was first acquired by Mr.
Briggs and his partners, the region
was all unimproved forest, to every
appearance of poor quality; its far
from promising aspect, however,
served to bring it within reach of
the modest financial resources of the
three pioneers. The money neces-
sary to purchase this undeveloped
tract of land had been gathered
with considerable difficulty, much
self-sacrifice and economy having
been exercised by all concerned in
the venture. The two brothers, out
of the forty shillings a week which
formed the sum of their combined
earnings, with unfailing regularity
put by thirty shillings a week, to
which a like sum was added by their
father and mother, and the £3OO
thus accumulated by the close of
two years was invested in the
“Swindon” acres, the margin being
used for the initial work of im-
provement. The area of the pro-
perty first acquired was 6,500 acres,
and upon this holding a house was
erected, while the fencing of the
boundary and work of subdivision
—at a cost of £l5 per mile—also
came in for immediate attention.
The ringbarking of the forest was
accomplished at a cost of 9d. per
acre, after which the stocking of
the place was entered upon, for
which purpose 72 heifers were pur-
chased at £4 per head. Prior to
the arrival of this draft one solitary
bullock, purchased for 325. 6d., held
undisputed sway over the newly-
acquired acres. About this time
various pests began to make their
appearance in the Burnett district,
zamia, or ricketts, playing havoc
with the stock, and the Briggs
family, taking full advantage of this
epidemic, purchased all available
stock, which was to be had at a price
commensurate with the risk. A
number of heifers were secured at
a price of ss. a head, and these,
luckily escaping the disease, added
to the fortunes of the family.
Shortly afterwards the dreaded tick
made its appearance, and stock-
owners in all directions began to
take alarm and to dispose of their
cattle to anyone who would part
with a mere trifle in cash and take

the risk of holding the stock. This
afforded a second opportunity to the
enterprising newcomers. Richard
and his brother, having previously
grasped the principles of inoculation
and of dipping from the Government
bacteriologist, forthwith erected a
dip, and securing the blood from an
immune beast, set steadily to work
to take possession of all mobs that
were offered them—the animals
ranging in value from 20s. to 255.
per head—and to dip and inoculate
each lot. As a result their losses
from tick and the attendant red-
water disease never exceeded 1 per
centum, but although they took
every opportunity of declaring their
faith in the success of these methods
they were unable to persuade the
neighbouring pastoralists to take the
minimum of risk involved. These
big purchases were made by the
Messrs. Briggs with no contract of
any kind, the terms being “pay when
you can,” and as they were thus
enabled to gather together large
numbers of stock, a speedy increase
in the sjze of their holdings became
necessary, and three more blocks of
land, each comprising 2,200 acres of
undeveloped country, were added to
the possessions of the firm. A
vigorous policy of ringbarking,
boundary fencing, and subdivision
once more was the order of the day,
the fencing consisting of three
barbed wires, which made a service-
able and durable fence. By the year
1905 the run, which had been ex-
tended to 18,500 acres, carrying
from 1,500 to 2,000 head of cattle
of mixed breeds, had become
thoroughly established as a success-
ful proposition, and in the following
year Mr. Richard Briggs determined
to launch out on his own account,
for which purpose he purchased
“Holroyd” run from Mr. John Fox,
of “Wigton” Station. This property,
which consisted of 7,000 acres, well
fenced, and a large portion of which
was rung, he secured for the
astonishingly small sum of £l3O.
Shortly afterwards he selected 8,000
acres of the adjoining country, and
stocked it with 500 head of cattle,
which in the course of three years
had increased to about 1,000 head
on the station, exclusive of fats
which had been marketed. At the
close of 1910 Mr. Briggs again en-
tered into partnership with his bro-
ther, and “Holroyd” and “Swin-
don” being junctioned in the ar-
rangement, he assumed the duties of
manager of the firm. In 1913 he
disposed of “Holroyd,” bare of
stock, for £2,500. In the same year
a younger brother joined the firm,
and the area of “Swindon” was
increased to 46,000 acres, carrying
about 5,000 head of stock. In 1914
Mr. Richard Briggs again severed
his connection with the firm, retain-
ing his share of the land and stock,
which amounted to about two-
sevenths of the whole, and shortly
afterwards he purchased 1,000 acres
of the “Wetheron” freehold estate,
since when he has secured “Wa-
lloon,” a property of 7,000 acres on
the Barambah River, which was
acquired by way of exchange from
bis brother for a portion of his (Mr.
R. R. Briggs) share in “Swindon.”
As an additional venture he has also
taken up a block of 700 acres of


excellent brush land at Wetheron,
under the “Pear Selection” condi-
tion, which provides for land to be-
come freehold if the pear is eradi-
cated within five years, and upon
while in a public capacity he has
dealt with at least 100 square miles.

HAROLD HUBERT WILSON,

late William Herbert Wilson, the
early founder of the fortunes of

REV. ARTHUR WILSON, D.D.

back into the Middle Ages, and in-
clude connections with such noble
families as Wedderburn, Scrym-
geour, Silford, Roxburgh, Athol,
Clarke, Dagleish, Chernside, Airlie,
and Dundee, to whom many refer-
ences are made in history. Mr.
Wilson received his education chiefly
under the guidance of a private
tutor, and upon the completion of
his studies paid a visit to “Wether-
ton” Station, the property of the
Hon. B. B. Moreton, with the pur-
pose in view of enlarging his know-
ledge of the pastoral industry. From
his earliest infancy he had been
brought up on cattle stations, and
in this way had become familiar with
almost every detail of the operations
carried on; but although while still
a youth he was as completely au fait
with the various departments of the
station industry as his father he was
desirous to augment this knowledge
by some acquaintance with the
methods of procedure on other
Queensland properties. To achieve
this end, which he considered neces-
sary to the completion of his tech-
nical education, he visited the above-
mentioned station, afterwards pro-
ceeding to “Burrandowan” and
several other of the leading cattle
properties in the State, where, mak-
ing the best use of the splendid
opportunities afforded him for study-
ing the differing breeds of horses
and cattle, he laid up the founda-
tions for an expert knowledge on
this subject of such paramount
importance to the pastoralist. The
keen application of the powers of his
mind to the fine points of stock-
breeding has been productive of
excellent results, the practical evi-
dences of a thorough early training
being clearly indicated throughout
the whole of his subsequent career.
Coincident with his studies in this
direction, he also devoted his atten-
tion to the important subject of land
surveying, under the tuition of his
brother-in-law, the late Mr. E. M.
Waraker, who was acting in the
capacity of deputy Surveyor-General
for Queensland, and this connection
proved of the utmost value to him,
inasmuch as it involved his accom-
panying his brother-in-law on his

travels over the greater part of the
rural districts, and so promoted his
intimate acquaintance with the
character of the country in different
portions of the State. So expert did
Mr. Wilson become in this sphere
of knowledge that after awhile he
found no difficulty in placing his
finger on any portion of the map of
Queensland and pronouncing it
good, bad, or indifferent as to soil
and conditions, while he was able

readily to indicate the location of
land most suitable for horse and
cattle breeding, and those parts of
the State where sheep would prove
the most suitable proposition. Mr.


Wilson's knowledge on these sub-
jects was generally conceded to be
so thorough, and his gifts so versa-
tile, that in 1891, when he was but
21 years of age, he was offered and

accepted the post of manager of
‘‘Cooranga" and “Dykehead” Sta-
tions, the property of the Scottish
Australian Investment Company,
which embraced an area of 780
square miles, carrying 21,000 cattle
and a large number of horses. The
young manager’s methods of control
soon proved to be such as to entirely
justify the opinion formed by the
owners of his great capabilities and
his comprehensive knowledge of
stock. His policy from the first was
to build up a herd of cattle of which
position ranking second to none
among the finest beef animals to be
found in the whole of the State.
Mr. Wilson continued to control
operations on “Cooranga” and
“Dykehead” for 20 years, during
which period the properties suffered
varying fortunes according to the
character of the seasons. In 1902,
when Queensland experienced the
worst drought known in its history,
even under the desperate circum-
stances he had to contend with in
common with other stockmen, Mr.
Wilson’s prestige suffered no eclipse,
the stations under his charge emerg-
ing from the terrible ordeal in much
better condition than many in even
more favoured localities. This was
boggy waterholes, and the resultant
strain upon their emaciated frames,

also an important factor in the pre-
vention of any great_ mortality
amongst the herds, and in the year
following the drought a testimony to
the success of his methods was given
in the fact that both of the stations
under Mr. Wilson s management
were able to show as many, or more,
cattle than any other property in
the Burnett district. Another of the
secrets of Mr. Wilson’s success was
his consistent endeavour to keep the
stock quiet and prevent as far as pos-
sible the wildness which frequently
any station-owner might be proud,
and his association with these pro-
perties resulted in the raising of the
standard of the herd from rough

due almost entirely to Mr. Wilson’s
untiring efforts to maintain a supply
of good water, easily accessible to
stock, in the form of sand-troughs,
thus enabling the cattle to evade
produces injury to the herd and
is highly detrimental to their
well-being and their survival to
more prosperous days. During the
years of Mr. Wilson’s connection


with “Cooranga” and “Dykehead”
the nibbling process of closer settle-
ment had been allowed full play in
this district, and to the man who
had thrown his whole energies into
the improvement of the area under
his control this was so discouraging
that he decided to relinquish the
reins of management. He had addi-
tional motive in coming to this deci-
sion from the fact that the private
interests which he had acquired in
other quarters were making an in-
sistent demand on his personal
attention, and he felt that the time
had arrived to concentrate his acti-
vities on his own properties in this
and other districts. Since that time
Mr. Wilson has resided at Gayndah,
from which centre he has kept in
touch with the different departments
of his pastoral enterprise. Pre-
dominant among his interests may
be placed the breed-
ing of equine stock,
his reputation as a
keen and enthusi-
astic lover of horses
being quite as wide
as the State itself.
Mr. Wilson’s career
in this connection
is, perhaps, one of
the most interest-
ing in Queensland,
where he is well
known as a pro-
minent breeder of
remounts and artil-
lery horses for the
Indian army.
Ponies also form
a marked feature
of his stud, and in
this class he has
taken some 80
blue ribbons, and holds unbeaten
records in the prize ring at various
shows throughout the State. In the
blood, saddle, and buggy class sec-
tions Mr. Wilson lias taken some
hundred blue ribbons at important
shows in different parts of Queens-
land, while in all he is the proud
possessor of over 350 first and about
30 second prizes in connection with
all classes of equine stock. In beef
cattle he has registered over 100 first
prizes to his credit, and secured a
notable distinction on one occasion
at the Gayndah Show, when his ex-
hibit of three fat cows was awarded
first prize in competition with three
imported English cows, all in the
beef section—an instance which
alone shows the high standard
achieved by Mr. Wilson in cattle
breeding. This wonderful record of

prize-taking extended over a period
of about eight years, during which
he was awarded a medal from
the Queensland Government as a
memento of his remarkable suc-
cesses in the show rings of the State.
Mr. Wilson is also in possession of a
large bound volume of certificates
from the various agricultural socie-
ties in connection with his exhibits.
His services as adjudicator in the
cattle and horse section at some of
the most important shows in Quens-
land have been frequently requisi-
tioned, and his decisions have never
yet been challenged during the time
in which he has acted in this capa-
city. In recent years he was ap-
pointed a registered judge of horses

Association, 1916-1917.
Dear Sir—
We, the undersigned members of the
committee of the above association, de-
sire to express our keen appreciation of
the splendid services rendered by you to
the association whilst fulfilling the posi-
tion of president. In that position we
were privileged to follow you in your
efforts to further the progress of the
association. That you have proved a
trustworthy guide is illustrated by the
splendid results achieved. In every
respect the year’s undertakings consti-
tute a record for the association.
Your keen perceptibility, your tireless
energy, your impartiality, your gener-
ous heart, have been the main factors
to the wonderful growth of the associ-
ation.
Many of the signatories to this
testimonial of appreciation have been
associated as committeemen with you
as president during your continuous six
years’ term of office, and with every
advance made they have felt fortified
with the knowledge that you were their
leader. Your every action was an in-
centive to “push on,” and the result of
the good advice given is found in the
records of the society which were placed
before the members of the association
to-day.
Not only is your good work appreci-
ated by the members of the committee,
but the general members of the associ-
ation also view with pleasure your
golden worth as a worker for the
association both in labour and money.
In asking you to accept this testi-
monial from your co-workers in the
year 1916-1917, we feel sure we are
voicing the opinions of past members of
the committee.
In conclusion, we hope you may be
able for many years to come to allow
your services to be placed at the dis-
posal of the association to further its
growth and usefulness, and thus soon
place our association in the premier
position of country associations.
We are, Mr. President, your co-
workers in the interests of the associ-
ation.

HISTORY OF QUEENSLAND : ITS PEOPLE AND INDUSTRIES


THOMAS PROVINCE, “Won-
bah,” Bundaberg, was born in
County Tyrone, Ireland, in the year
1836, and is the eldest son of the
late Thomas Province, of the same
county. He received his education
at a local school, and upon the ter-
mination of his studies was asso-
ciated with his father in farming
pursuits for several years, at 17
proceeding to Scotland, where he
commenced farming at a place called
Craigfir, near Maybole, in Ayrshire.
Here he remained until 1857, in
which year he took passage by the
ship “Herald of the Morning,” and
arrived at Sydney, New South
Wales, after a voyage of four
months’ duration. Almost imme-
diately he left the mother State
for Queensland, then on the eve
of separation, and coming to the
Wide Bay district accepted an en-
gagement with Messrs. Skinner and
Lamb, owners of “Dalgangal” Sta-
tion, upon which property he gained
his first colonial experience. When
the station passed into other
hands Mr. Province entered the
employ of Messrs. R. B. & J. C.
Ridler at “Yarrol.” Here he con-
tinued to improve his knowledge of
sheep and station work generally,
and by the close of the 15 years
which he spent on this estate he had
3,000 merino sheep from Mr. Rid-
ler, and by arrangement with that
gentleman grazed his flock on the
station pastures until he was able

years the opportunity for which
he was waiting occurred, and Mr.
This country was totally unimproved
and some necessary developmental
work was immediately set in train,
huts for the shepherds and stock-
yards being erected, and other im-
provements begun. Shortly after
stocking his run Mr. Province pur-
chased “Roslyn” from Messrs.
Dingle & Hunter in 1875, a property
embracing 33 square miles and
watered by Eastern Creek and its
tributaries; and, making this his
head station, he built a homestead
and entered with energy and zeal
upon the building up of his pro-
position, Ringbarking and fencing
operations first occupied his
attention, the latter work being
carried out on the boundary with
four plain wires, and in some
instances a two-rail fence being
made to do duty. From the first he
introduced both cattle and sheep on
to these areas, bringing over to
“Roslyn” some of the “Dangan-
gal” flock, which he had purchased
at an earlier date, and for a few
years the mutton and wool industry
was given a prominent place in Mr.
Province’s enterprise. Gradually,
however, a good deal of trouble
arose among the sheep on account of
the prevalence of the noxious spear-

disaster he cleared his pastures of

provided with an adequate water

Province highly suitable for a head-
quarters station. He accordingly
removed his residence from “Ros-
lyn” to “Wonbah,” and initiated
improvement work of a very
thorough nature thereon. The ring-
barkers got to work on the standing
timber, which in many portions of
the run was fairly dense, and sub-
sequent clearing operations were
carried out with all possible expe-
dition. Acre by acre was denuded
of forest and scrub growths, and
rich grassy pastures lay bathed in
the open sunlight until—except for
the clusters of shelter trees and the
cattle camps —the whole country
took on the park-like appearance
which it presents to-day. Substan-
tial fences of three barbed wires were
run round the boundary, and the
subdivisional fences were also taken
in hand with all possible expedition,
these being constructed with two
barbed and one plain wire. Special
attention was next given to the form-
ing of drafting yards, after which
came the construction of six dips,
with the necessary facilities for the
rapid and effective handling of stock.

THOMAS RALSTON PRO-
VINCE, “Roslyn” Station, near
Mount Perry, is the only son of Mr.
Thomas Province, of “Wonbah,”
to whom extended reference is made
in the preceding article. He was
born at “Yarrol” Station, to the
west of Gin Gin, in the Burnett
district, in the year 1864. At that
time his father held the position of
sheep overseer in the employ of Mr.
Robert Ridler, and the early days
of the young Queenslander were
spent on “Yarrol,” where he natur-
ally became familiar with the
routine of station life. During this
period Mr. Thomas Province ac-
quired the “Roslyn” country and
started operations on his own ac-
count, taking his family to reside
with him in the homestead which he
erected on the then undeveloped
run. After removal to the new
home in 1875, the gentleman under
review, being then 11 years of age,
continued his studies, which hitherto
had been of a somewhat desultory
character, under the guidance of a
private tutor, and subsequently he
was sent to school at Gayndah,
finally completing his scholastic
career at the Maryborough Gram-
mar School. At the age of 17
he returned to “Roslyn” to assist his
father in the work and management
of the property. At the time of its
acquirement by Mr. Province, sen.,
the station had been used exclu-
sively for cattle, but in pursuance of
a policy of extension and enterprise
the new owner introduced sheep of
the merino type, small drafts of
which he had secured by purchase
from the flocks of “Yarrol” and
other pastoral properties in the same
district, and by the year 1883 was
running some 25,000 sheep, together
with about 1,000 cattle. The flocks
and herds ranged over an area
of about 200 square miles, the whole
of which was comprised in the “Ros-
lyn” run of that period, affording
ample room for almost unlimited ex-
pansion and enterprise. In the late
eighties, however, the price of wool
suffered a big decrease, dropping as
low as 3d. per lb., and as that figure
would scarcely defray the heavy cost
of cartage from the station to the
boat at Maryborough, whence the
wool was transported to London,
Air. Province decided to withhold
the season’s clip from the market
and to ship two seasons’ product to
Great Britain in the following year
—a plan which answered very well,
as the wool was sold at the satis-
factory figure of lid. per lb. The
wool markets, however, still remained
very uncertain, and for this and
other reasons Mr. Province, sen.,
determined to devote his attention
exclusively to the raising of cattle.

MR. THOMAS RALSTON PROVINCE.
With this end in view the sheep
were gradually disposed of, and
by 1886 had almost completely
disappeared from “Roslyn.” The
experience gained in the manage-
ment of the flock nevertheless proved
of considerable value to the younger
man, widening his knowledge of the
pastoral industry generally and
enabling him in later years to decide
on the most profitable course to take
in regard to his independent enter-
prise, without the expensive and
troublesome method of experiment.
In the year 1883 Mr. Province, sen.,
purchased “Wonbah” Station, and
removing thither with most of his
family, left his son, whom he had
admitted into partnership, in con-
trol at “Roslyn.” Being full of
energy and zeal, Mr. T. K. Province
determined to leave no stone un-
turned in his efforts to make a com-
mercial success of the proposition he
had in hand. The management of the
stock was now a matter of routine
in a great measure, all the details
connected with its carrying out, as
a matter of custom, being now at
his fingers’ end; but there was still
much improvement work to be done
on the property, and in this direc-
tion his - activities found plenty of
scope. The fencing and subdivision
of the large area first taken up was
far from being completed, and this
work was put into train by Mr. T.
R. Province, who had six miles of
fencing erected on the method of
split posts with two rails, at a cost
of £65 per mile. This was a some-
what costly style of enclosing pad-
docks, and the next 20 miles were
built with three, and in some cases
four, plain wires, costing from £2B
to £3O per mile. Ringbarking was
also taken in hand, in the course
of a few years some thousands of
acres being cleared; and here, as in
other places where this method of
preparing country for stock purposes
has been adopted, the interesting

phenomenon presented itself of new
springs making their appearance in
many places, considerably augment-
ing the available supplies of water.


In 1901 Mr. Province, jun.,
selected on his own account several
portions of the “Roslyn" run which
had been resumed by the Govern-
ment, and some five years later, by
mutual consent, the partnership be-
tween himself and his father was dis-
solved, and he has since worked the
station on his own account. Since
this time Mr. T. R. Province has
continued operations on a profitable
basis, notwithstanding that, in com-
mon with all other owners of landed
interests, he has suffered the ups and
downs distributed by fortune with
female stock. In the original in-
stance the area of the “Roslyn"
run extended over 200 square miles,
the greater part of which consisted
of leases from the Crown. In 1884
the first of the Crown leases expired,
and by the close of 1886 the large
area above-mentioned was reduced
by about one-half. Since that period
other portions of “Roslyn" have
fallen to the Crown, and at the pre-
sent time (1916) the run comprises
some 80 square miles of country held
under different forms of land tenure,

weather conditions were such as to
operate solidly against the prosperity
of the station, heavy losses being in-
curred among the cattle as a result
of the adverse state of affairs. Again,

vividly remembered by pastoralists
and farmers, the drought played
havoc at “Roslyn," and fully 25

developmental work completed by
Mr. T. R. Province during the past
few years is found in the fact that,
although reduced to only half of its
former dimensions, the property car-
ries approximately as many head of
stock as in former days were sus-
tained on the 200-mile run. The
breed favoured by Mr. Province is
a good type of shorthorn, and in
order to maintain a hardy constitu-
tion in the herd in recent years
he has introduced some Devon
bulls, prociu-ed from “Glenmoan"

igue and delay of unnecessary
droving over long distances. The
“Roslyn" country presents a variety
of characteristics, the changes in the
soil usually being indicated by the
species of timber, which include
ironbark, spotted gum, appletree,
rosewood, and wattle. The Burnett
River threads its way through the
estate, and is the principal source
from which water is obtained, the
supply being augmented by the

BRYAN WILLIAM PALMES, of
“Hainault” Station, near Eidsvold,
is a Yorkshireman, having been born
in 1856 at Hornsea, in the county
where his father, the late William
Lindsay Palmes, was well known as
the vicar of the parish. Originally
from Somerset, the Palmes’ is now
one of the most ancient of Yorkshire
county families, the family seat,
known as "Naburn,” having been
occupied by their successive genera-
tions for 700 years. A curious and
interesting event which happened
during the era of the present genera-
tion of Palmes was the recovery of
a ring bearing the family crest,
which is now in possession of the
present landlord and vicar, a bro-
ther of Mr. Palmes, of “Hainault.”
This ring was ploughed up in a
field on Marston Moor, and upon the
identification of the crest was re-
turned to the family, who place a
high value on it as an heirloom. The
subject of this article received his
education at St. Peter’s College,
York, subsequently attending a
scholastic institution at Gosport. His
early ambition was directed to enter-
ing the Navy, but ultimately he
altered his intention and joined the
merchant service, acquiring the
necessary training under Messrs.
Anderson & Anderson, now known
as the Orient Company. His voyages
during the period of his apprentice-
ship were between London and Ade-
laide, and this gave him ample op-
portunity for conversation with
wealthy squatters and station-
holders from Queensland, who fired
his imagination with tales of the
great opportunities offered by the
wide pastoral areas still unoccupied
in the fertile sub-tropical north-
eastern portion of Australia. Cattle-
men sounded the praises of Queens-
land as an ideal region for the
building up of huge herds, and big
sheep-farmers vaunted its advantages
for pasturing flocks of a tally
undreamed of in the experience of
the British-bred sailor, and the words
thus casually spoken remained in his
memory. After successfully passing
his examination for second officer,
Mr. Palmes sailed for the most part
between Sydney and San Francisco,
and having completed seven years
at sea he decided to resign
from the merchant service and
devote his attention to pastoral
pursuits. Accordingly he came
to Queensland, and to obtain the
knowledge requisite as a prelimin-
ary to embarking on independent
enterprise he accepted a position
as jackaroo on “Goochie” Station,
situated in the Wide Bay dis-
trict, and managed by Mr. H.
Missing. Under the efficient tute-
lage of this gentleman Mr. Palmes
rapidly assimilated the rudiments of
his task, and laid in a stock of
general information anent the indus-
try which proved of considerable
benefit to him in later days. At the
same time every facility was afforded
him for acquainting himself with
the practical side of station opera-
tions, of which he was not slow to
take advantage, and the three years
spent on "Goochie” proved an excel-
lent apprenticeship for his more
ambitious schemes for the future. In
1880 he at length decided to strike
out for himself, and in partnership

with a brother he secured -by selec-
tion a block of 1,700 acres, situ-
ated at Tiaro, in the Wide Bay dis-
trict, which the partners imme-
diately began to develop as a cattle-
raising proposition. Some years later
—in 1883—a tragic event occurred,
when the brother of Mr. Palmes met
with an accident in the bush, and
when discovered had been dead for
some time, the body having been
partially devoured by dingos. Prior
to this sad occurrence, in the early
part of 1882, Mr. Palmes had occa-
sion to accompany some drovers who
were taking cattle from “Miva” to
"Cracow” Station, a half-share of
which latter property had recently
been placed upon the market by the
owner, Mr. John T. Atherton, who
also owned “Miva.” His impressions
of the “Cracow” country upon this
trip being extremely favourable Mr.
Palmes decided to purchase the
half-share offered for sale, and after
completion of negotiations consented
to take over the management of the
place, which he retained until the
property was disposed of some 21
years later. The “Cracow” run at
that time extended over a wide area
of 200 square miles of unimproved
country, through the grassy spaces
of which the cattle roamed at will.
The absence of fences was brought
home very speedily to the new
manager by the discovery that the
cattle brought from "Miva” to
"Cracow,” at considerable expendi-
ture of time and trouble, invariably
at the earliest opportunity returned
to their old run. The first work,
therefore, to be put in hand was the
enclosing of the boundary with a
good strong fence, which cost about
£2O per mile, timber posts strung
with plain wires being used for this
purpose. This completed, Mr.
Palmes directed his attention to
other necessary improvements, until
by degrees he got things in shape
sufficiently to proceed unhindered
with the main work of the station—
the breeding and fattening of cattle.
Many ups and downs were included
in the experience of the pastoralists
of the day, among which the fluc-
tuation in the prices of cattle was
among the most serious, such fluc-
tuation for an extended period
always being from bad to worse,
from the pastoralist’s point of view.
At times values dropped so low as
not to warrant the fees necessary for
droving. In the late eighties or
early nineties Mr. Palmes, with
others, was persuaded to give his
favourable attention to a scheme
promoting the conversion of market-
able cattle into tinned meat for ex-
port to London, and for this purpose
he sent a draft of 300 head to the
meatworks. The project turned out
to be a heart-breaking experience
when the account sales finally came
to hand from London, Mr. Palmes
receiving a cheque for 18s., which
sum represented the net profit ob-
tained on his 300 head of bullocks!
In 1901-1902 the great drought,
which almost put the extinguishing
touch on pastoral operations in
Queensland, caught "Cracow” in its
iron grip, and during that and the
following year the herds on the sta-
tion dwindled from 7,000 head of
well-conditioned cattle to about 30
skeletons, which miserable draft was


all that survived when the drought
broke at the close of 1903. The
partners agreed to sell, and a
last-mentioned year. At an earlier
date, in 1896, Mr. Palmes had taken
up in his own account the “Hainault”
stocked up with cattle. These, how-
ever, likewise perished during the
disastrous season of drought, and he

became necessary before he could get
into touch with any stock-owners
willing to dispose of their cattle.
It may be mentioned that, owing to
the severe losses incurred by land-
holders during the 1902 drought the
Government stepped in and allowed
the sufferers a 10-years' extension of
their leases, which afforded them an
opportunity of recovering in part
from the wreck of their prosperity
caused by the awful devastation of
that never-to-be-forgotten period in
the history of the State. In 1906
Mr. Palmes augmented his “Hain-
ault” property by the purchase of
“Lyndale,” a holding of 20,000
acres, in the same district, and con-
tinued with vigour the developmental
work necessary to bring his estates
into rank with the best in the coun-
try. A large amount of boundary
fencing and subdivision into suitable
enclosures for the easier handling of
the stock has been completed, and as
much ringbarking accomplished as
allowed under the terms of the
lease. In 1912 “Glandore” was added
to the list of holdings under Mr.
Palmes’ proprietary, this being a
block of fenced and well-improved
pastoral country. “Hainault” Station
is provided with an adequate water
supply, numerous wells having
been sunk and dams constructed
for conservation purposes. Various
windmills, with the necessary plant
for pumping purposes, have been
erected, by means of which an
excellent flow of good stock water is
easily procured. Every well is pro-
vided with a tank with a holding
capacity of from 20,000 to 40,000
gallons and these in turn serve
automatically the troughs from
which the cattle drink. Mr. Palmes
is inclined to think that the whole-
some quality of the water
accounts in a large de-
gree for the remarkable
healthiness and good "doing”
qualities of the stock gener-
ally. The combined estates
carry some 5,000 head of
cattle all the year round, a
due proportion for marketing
purposes being fattened annu-
ally. Mr. Palmes also owns
a sheep station in addition
to his other properties in
"Townshend” Island, lying
about 80 miles north of Rock-
hampton and 2 miles from the
mainland. The area of the
land is about 26 square miles,
and carries a flock of from
3,000 to 4,000 sheep. Mr.
Palmes was married in the
year 1885 to Ellen, daughter
of the late Paul Lawless,
of "Booubyjan,” a property
which owns the distinction of
being the only holding in the
Burnett district which is still
held in possession by the de-
scendants of the original pro-
prietor. Of this union there is issue
two sons and four daughters. Both
of the sons joined the Australian
Imperial Forces, and are now (Dec.,
1916) on active service at the front.

the present head of which is Sir
William Eliott. The family seat,
Stubs Castle, is situated near
Hawick, in Roxburghshire, North
Britain. The Eliotts have sprung
from Gilbert Eliott, of Stobs—
"YENDA” HOMESTEAD.
“Gibby wi’ the gouden gartins”—
whose grandson, Gilbert, was created
knight-baronet by the King in per-
son on the field of the Battle of
Scone in 1643, and was afterwards
made a baronet by Charles 11. in
1666. General Eliott (Lord Heath-
field), whose name has been handed
down to history as the famous de-
fender of Gibraltar, was collaterally
connected with the family. The
name of that great fortress appears
on the Eliott coat-of-arms, the
crests being, first, a hand couped at
the wrist in armour holding a cut-
lass in bend both proper; second, a
key palewise proper; and, third, an
open dexter palewise couped at the
wrist charged with an eye, both
proper. Mr. E. Willoughby Charles
Eliott is a grandson of the late Gil-
bert Eliott, C.M.G., M.L.C., who
was a well-known public figure in
Queensland, and who was the third
son of the sixth baronet. The sub-
ject of this notice was born at
’ “Greenwells,” Walcha, and received
his education at a public school and
under private tuition, which was
administered, in the first instance,
at the station homestead, and after-
wards at Randwick, near Sydney.
Upon the completion of his studies
the young man first turned his
attention to the cultivation of sugar-
cane at Port Macquarrie, but after
a short trial at the work resolved that
pastoral pursuits would be more to
his liking, and he consequently relin-
quished the latter occupation in fav-
our of cattle-raising. With the
enthusiasm of the pastoral spirit
strong in his blood, Mr. Eliott
came to Queensland, where, if dis-
tances were vast, so was the scope
opening before the eye of the pro-
spective raiser of stock. Wide spaces
seemed to be waiting, but lacking
the necessary technical knowledge
in administration, Mr. Eliott
determined that before he risked his
cajhtal upon the task of making a
cattle station pay he would equip
himself with the needed technique
and with familiarity of local
MR. F. WILLOUGHBY CHARLES ELIOTT.
conditions. Accordingly he accepted
the position of jackeroo on "Degilbo
Station, where he spent seven years
under the direction of the late Mr.
William Sly, during this somewhat
lengthy period becoming closely inti-
mate with the work of cattle-raising
in its various branches. But Mr.
Eliott desired something more than
the merely local knowledge apper-
taining to some particular district.
He was anxious to secure a thorough
grasp of the many ramifications in-
fluencing pastoral success and failure
in the north-east of the continent,
and in order to achieve this end he
undertook the overlanding of a mob
of 1,000 bullocks to “Ardock” Sta-
tion, on the Bulloo River, in the
remote west of the State. Tra-
velling slowly over the country in
that way, he was able to closely
observe the many changes in the
natural features of the various dis-
tricts through which he passed. The
journey added largely to the fund
of experience he had already gained
and also brought him into touch
with newer methods of pastoral
management. Moreover, the mere
experience of taking so big a draft
of cattle so far in itself constituted
a most valuable series of lessons to
one about to devote his energies to
the management of pastoral hold-
ings. Having duly delivered his
charge in good condition at the


appointed destination, Mr. Eliott
returned to the Burnett River dis-
trict. Realizing from what he had
just seen that the western country
did not provide for his activities
that arena he was so anxious to find,
he accepted the management of
“Yenda” Station, a holding which,
devoted entirely to cattle-raising, pro-
vided ample scope for the skill and
determination with which the young
manager was so well endowed. Mr.
Eliott has ever since then been in-
timately associated with the same
property, of which he is now part
proprietor. At the commencement
of his connection with “Yenda” very
little had been done in the way of
improvements, but immediately on
taking charge Mr. Eliott initiated
developmental operations, which
ultimately ended in placing
“Yenda” on an equal footing
with the most up-to-date and
scientifically managed properties in
Queensland. The carrying capacity
of the run was soon increased by the
provision of an adequate water sup-
ply and by the proper subdivision of
the place into paddocks; whilst the
returns were rendered more secure
by the protection from the worst
effects of drought which these altera-
tions provided. Upon the day that
young Eliott made his advent at
“Yenda” to take over control of the
station carpenters arrived to begin
the erection of a new homestead, a
typical station dwelling, with wide
verandahs and large airy rooms.

midable task which lay ahead of him
in subduing the pristine riot of virgin

any real developmental work had
been attempted till then. To at-
tack this space and make it of pro-

assurance of success. On “Yenda,”
as in so much of the rest of the
pastoral areas of Australia, the first
substantial progress began with the
fencing in of at least a portion of

some of the older hands to recognize

was needed to convince Mr. Eliott
that if he was to make the best nse
of the run entrusted to his manage-
ment he must begin with the work
of laying out paddocks. In that way
the growing stock could be best cared
for, and the bullocks intended for
fattening topped-up in the most
expeditious manner. He first pro-
ceeded to fence in an area of 20,000
acres, which in turn was subdivided
into seven paddocks of various
dimensions. In the longer-settled

greatly increased by the destruction
of timber and scrub growths, and

were introduced to the pastures here
at an early stage in the station’s his-
tory. When Mr. Willoughby Eliott
assumed control the herd was com-
posed principally of a Devon and
shorthorn cross, and his strain was
continued for many years, but at
the expiration of the lease, when
the country was thrown open for
selection, a change of type was de-
cided upon. When the lease ran out
it was resolved by Mr. Dight, who
at that time was owner, to take up
20,000 acres under the new terms.
Subsequently a further area of
11,500 acres was selected, and the
leasehold of these two properties
combined forms the present “Yen-
da.” Under the more modern con-
ditions now prevailing, the “Yenda”
country is found to be too rich and
valuable to devote to cattle-breed-
ing. Too long a period is absorbed
in waiting for the young stock to
mature to permit of part of the
estate being devoted to establishing
supplies of “stores.” Consequently
the present practice is to purchase
drafts of bullocks and cows and to
fatten them for market. The run
usually carries from 4,000 to 5,000
head which are being treated in this
way. Throughout the early history
of the station, and until 1904, blacks
were employed in handling the herds
under the direction of several white
stockmen. In those days the natives
were very numerous in the dis-
trict, and they proved themselves
remarkably efficient among the
cattle. The year 1895 witnessed
the death of Mr. Dight, and Mr.
Eliott then became proprietor of the
estate, conjointly with several
others, the management still re-
maining in his hands. Having thus
succeeded in turning what, when he
first took control, was a primitive
leasehold run into a fully-improved

and highly-productive freehold es-
state, Mr. Eliott has since exten-
sively and usefully interested himself
in affairs appertaining to the inter-
ests of the district and the adminis-
tration of its government, and for
a period extending over thirty-one
years has been a member of the local
shire council. He was created a
Justice of the Peace by the Philp
Government, and at the time
of writing fills the office of
chairman of the Marsupial Board.
Mr. Eliott is well known in racing
circles, and is president of the
Gayndah Jockey Club. He has
owned and successfully raced several
notable performers, among which
may be mentioned “Flaxen,” by
“Flavus” (imp,), with which he won
the Queensland Derby in 1908 and
the Rosehill Cup, New South Wales.
Mr. Eliott had entered into negotia-
tions with the German Government
for the sale of “Flaxen” when the
great European War intervened and
prevented the completion of the
transaction. “Matouree,” winner of
several races both in New South
Wales and Victoria, was another of
his horses to establish a creditable
record. He also holds the Kidston
Government Gold Medal for cham-
pion blood stallion, which he won
with “Melodian,” a sire that
scored many successes in various
parts of Queensland. Mr. Eliott
derives his interest from the turf
on the higher plane of a
breeder of good stock rather than
on that of the mere sporting man.
It is the former, rather than the
latter, who is the real sportsman,
and who directly uses the Turf as an
instrument for the improvement of
the national standard of thorough-
bred stock. During recent years

JOSEPH BALL, “Rosebank”
Station, via Mount Perry, was born
in County Surrey, England, in 1858,
and is the eldest son of the late
Joseph Ball, a British railway official
who, before leaving his native land,
occupied the post of stationmaster
at Norwood Junction, a busy point
on the London, Brighton, and South
Coast railway systems. Being desir-
ous of improving his position in life,
the late Mr. Ball in 1868 decided to
come to Australia, and accordingly
with his family sailed in that year
for Queensland. Upon arrival at
the infant settlement at Moreton
Bay he selected land on the Albert
River, in the Logan district, and
started general farming operations,
turning his attention to cotton-
growing, corn producing, and other

departments of the agricultural in-
dustry. After two years of this life,
however, he found the call of his
former occupation too strong to be
resisted, and offered his services to
the railway department in Queens-
land. Despite the fact that he had
satisfactorily discharged the duties
appertaining to the responsible
position filled by him at Norwood
Junction in England, he entered the
Queensland service on the lowest
rung of the ladder, but after a short
interval was able to convince the
officials in authority of his compet-
ence and worth, and forthwith re-
ceived rapid promotion through the
various grades of the department.
Eventually he was appointed to the
position of stationmaster at Indoo-
roopilly, and was stationed there
when the first railway bridge was
erected over the Brisbane River,
which structure was washed away by
flood waters in the great rising of
the river in 1893, being replaced by
the present fine Indooroopilly rail-
way bridge some years later. Mr.
Ball retired from the service in the
late eighties, and his decease oc-
curred in the year 1896. After the
farm at the Albert River was aban-
doned by the late gentleman, his
son, the subject of this memoir, con-
tinued to develop the property as a
mixed agricultural and grazing en-
terprise, but discovering at length
that under the prevailing conditions
agriculture was a losing proposition

locality. The year 1894 was marked
by his advent to the Burnett district,
when he entered into partnership
with Mr. Gill, who had taken up a
selection, 6,700 acres in area, which
they worked together for a period
extending over about three years,
About this time several settlers re-
moved from the Logan to the Bur-
nett district, availing themselves of

down to the development of his block
of country as a cattle-raising pro-
position. The land as yet was
totally unimproved and guiltless of
fences, and Mr. Ball’s first act was
to pitch a tent and turn his ener-
gies to enclosing his property by the
erection of a boundary fence, after
which the work of sub-division en-
gaged his attention for some con-
siderable time, the fences, which
were constructed with posts and
wire, costing some £26 per mile to
erect. The country was fairly
heavily timbered, but Mr. Ball,
however, in common with the other
men from the Logan, had experi-
enced the good results that always
accrued from judicious clearing of
the green timber, and he lost no time
in applying the axe in a wholesale
fashion on his own land, thus mak-
ing an ocular demonstration of his
confidence in this up-to-date treat-
ment of virgin country to be
applied to stock-raising purposes.
The first mob of cattle purchased by
Messrs. Gill & Ball for the stocking
of their holding consisted of 350
store bullocks obtained from “Rodd’s
Bay” Estate in 1895, and with this
modest purchase the pastoral history
of “Rosebank” may be said to have
begun. Considerable attention was
given from the first to augmenting
the natural water supply of the pro-
perty —which was provided prin-
cipally by Splinter Creek, which
intersects the estate —and wells were
sunk at convenient intervals, the
presence of moisture at an easy
depth in almost any locality making
this work a comparatively simple
matter. Mr. Ball reaped abundant
reward for his foresight in this
direction at the time of the severe
drought of 1902-1903, when owing
to the existence of the wells and the
improvement of the country gener-
ally he suffered a loss of only about
1 per cent, as against 50 per cent,
experienced by holders of large un-
improved areas. He was, however,
less fortunate when, in 1903, the
tick pest made its appearance in the
Burnett district, and dips being then
almost unknown in that part of the
country he was among the heavy
sufferers, his herd being decimated
by the loss of fully 10 per cent, of
their entire number. In 1906 Mr.
Ball selected an additional block of
between 5,000 and 6,000 acres of
unfenced and unimproved hilly
country in the Gladstone district,
which he has since enclosed with
substantial fences, subdivided into
paddocks, and ringbarked, 25 miles
of fencing, at £26 per mile, alone
representing a considerable amount
of time and labour. This country is
watered by Deception Creek, in
addition to which there are various
wells, providing an ample supply of
good water for the stock. In 1910,
finding that his herd had increased
to such an extent that further graz-
ing ground was a practical necessity,
Mr. Ball took advantage of the
Homestead Act of that year to
acquire in the name of his eldest
son, Mr. Henry Ball, a 3,600-acre
holding, which is now carried on in
conjunction with the other two pro-
perties. As a preliminary prepara-
tion for occupation, before any cattle
could with safety be placed upon the
new pastures, £BOO had to be spent
in improvements, fencing, ring-
barking, dips, and stockyards, all
receiving a proper share of atten-
tion, a good supply of water yielded
by the Pine Mountain and Monal
Creeks obviating the necessity of
well-sinking. This property now
carries about 500 head of mixed
cattle. Mr. Ball has continued his
progressive policy steadily from year
to year on all his estates, which are
now all adequately provided with
dips, yards, and all the necessary
arrangements for handling economic-
ally large herds of cattle. He is
justly regarded as one of the most
prosperous and successful men of the
district, and a supporter of all

equally well-known figure in social
circles. He married in 1890 Mary,
daughter of Mr. Henry Browne, of
County Leitrim, Ireland, by whom
he has issue six sons and three
daughters.


HARRY POWNALL, "Kol-
onga,” near Mount Perry, was
born at Logan Village, Queensland,
in 1870. He is the eldest son of the
late John Pownall, who reached

Australia from England in 1864.
Mr. Pownall, who was accompanied
by his brother Thomas, proceeded
to the Logan district, where they
took up separate holdings and
became engaged in grazing and
farming pursuits in that district.
Mr. Harry Pownall received his
primary education at a school in the

completing his scholastic training in

rooftree, he obtained a thorough
grounding in the numerous details
of work connected with the cattle-
raising industry. Horse-breeding
also was carried on on a limited
scale, and Mr. Harry Pownall
reaped the additional advantage of
gaining some practical experience in
this important department on the
home property. The death of his
father in tire early eighties left the
burden of management to be taken
up by his young son, and at a very
early period it fell to his lot to
shoulder responsibilities usually
faced only by men of maturer
years. Having demonstrated his
capacity to successfully handle the
family fortunes, some few years later,
in 1892, he obtained the consent of
his mother and other members of the
family to sell the farm on the Logan,
which was freehold property, and to
seek fresh country farther afield. A
suitable offer having been made and
the farm disposed of, Mr. Pownall,
with his brother William, turned
their steps northward on a quest for
land which should possess the quali-
fications necessary for successful
development as a pastoral property.
With this purpose in view they
travelled to Gladstone, a distance of
300 miles, and inspected some coun-
try in that vicinity which had been
recommended to their notice; but
failing to find what they wanted
there, passed from district to dis-
trict, spending three or four
months in this search, until their
choice finally fell on an area of about
6,400 acres in the neighbourhood of
“New Cannindah” Station, near
Mount Perry, in the Burnett dis-
trict. In aboriginal nomenclature
the place was designated "Ko-
longa,” and Mr. Pownall decided to
perpetuate the musical word by
giving that name to the property,
which has since become well known
under this appellation. The country
was yet in its virgin state, the “Ko-
longa” run being the first grazing
farm to be taken up in that locality,
and as a natural consequence the
brothers were confronted by the big
initial task of preparing the land for
stocking, unaided by the presence

and experience of any forerunners,
which would have made the work
considerably easier. However, being
full of youthful strength and enthu-
siasm, they applied themselves with
vigour to the necessary fencing and
ringbarking without any delay,
these being the preliminary opera-
tions of paramount importance.
Their first act was to fence the
boundary with one barbed wire and
two plain wires threaded through
posts cut from bush timber, of which
there was an abundance, and the
whole of the 14 miles of fencing
which was required to complete this
strenuous undertaking was accom-
plished by the two young pioneers’
personal exertions. This completed,
the matter of subdivision was taken
in hand, and a further 11 miles of
fencing, also erected by the personal
labour of the brothers, enclosed six
paddocks of suitable size for the
grazing and handling of stock. Even
under these circumstances the work
proved to be costly enough, each
mile of fencing representing £25 of
the money which had to be care-
fully hoarded for the purchase of
the necessary stock so soon as the
grazing pastures should be ready for
occupation. Ringbarking was as
yet unpractised in the country round
"Kolonga,” but the Messrs. Pownall
determined to leave- no stone un-
turned to ensure the prosperity of


their venture, and being well aware
of the big increase of value taken
on by laud denuded of its green
timber they prepared to make a
practical demonstration of this to
the surrounding run-holders. By
dint of hard work the brothers
soon achieved marked results, and
the country rapidly took on a dif-
ferent aspect. Despite their hard
work and economy, the financial re-
sources of the combination were not
sufficient to warrant the purchase of
an adequate number of cattle with
which to stock their place, and in
order to tide over the period neces-
sary to allow of the building up of
a sound proposition by means of
natural increase arrangements were
made to take stock on agistment at
five shillings per head per annum,
and from this source was drawn
the principal means of revenue for
the first four years of the venture.

In the meantime the breeders
which had been brought from the
Logan district were proving prolific,
and the pastures soon became
picturesque with the young and
healthy herd, which derived its
nourishment from the nutritious
natural grasses and herbage which
was one of the features of the
“Kolonga” country. This increase
in the number of the herd, further
augmented by some purchases made
in 1898, soon rendered agistment
unnecessary, and indeed impossible,
as all the country owned by the
firm was required for the mainten-
ance of its own stock. In 1889,
after a friendly consultation with
Mr. Thomas Province, of “Wonbah,”
who strongly advised the substitu-
tion of sheep for cattle, on the
grounds that they afforded a more
speedy turnover, Mr. Pownall pur-
chased 550 pure merino ewes from
Messrs. Marshall & Slade, of “Glen-
gallan” Station, and with these as a
nucleus he built up a nice little flock
in the course of three years. This
date, however, marked the com-
mencement of the big drought which
brought so much disaster to stock-
owners in Queensland, and although

and 20 per cent, of cattle, owing to
the unprecedented rise in price for

he received an average figure of
17s. 6d. per head. The sheep were
then replaced with cattle, a good
quality of shorthorn being favoured
by Mr. Pownall, who has obtained
good results from this type. Some
time before the beginning of the
drought the property known as
“Langley” was selected and formed,
and a little later was sold unstocked
to the late Mr. Harry Bailey, a
larger and more suitable area of land
adjoining “Kolonga” being taken
up by the firm. Shortly afterwards
a dissolution of partnership was
agreed upon, Mr. Harry Pownall
retaining the parent property as his
share of the estate and his brother

operations, and with this purpose in
view purchased a holding of about
1,400 acres in the Gladstone district,
also selecting an additional area ad-
joining. Ringbarking and other de-
velopmental work were immediately
put in hand, and to-day a well-
improved freehold block, known as
“Stockwell,” testifies to the thorough-
ness of the progressive policy which
was vigorously applied by the
owner in the earliest stages of its
history as a grazing area. The Boyne
Valley Railway now runs within a
mile of “Stockwell.” Six years
after the acquirement of this hold-
ing, in 1909, the increasing pros-
perity of the proposition demanded
still wider territory to support its
growth, and another grazing lease,
4,500 acres in dimensions, now
known as “Dooloo,” was secured.

and ringbarking were necessary be-
fore the land could be utilized for
pastoral enterprise. The initial work
accomplished, however, stock was
introduced, which throve very well
under the new conditions, and at the
time of writing (1917) this holding
carries about 500 head of cattle. In
1911 Mr. Pownall added yet another
property to his list of pastoral hold-
ings by the purchase of “Mooroon-
crie” (in aboriginal nomenclature
meaning “box tree”) from Mr. A.
E. Banks. This estate has an area
of 8,500 acres, and having been con-
siderably improved before coming
into the present owner’s hands, it
can be fairly heavily stocked with-
out overtaxing its capacity. The
management of “Mooroongie has
been entrusted by Mr. Pownall to
his sons, Messrs. John and Charles
Pownall, who have proved them-
selves very efficient administrators of
its affairs. The latest acquirement
of territory made by the owner of
“Kolonga” is the “Maratah’ es-
tate, formerly in the possession of
Mr. Norman Rule, from whom it
was purchased by Mr. Pownall in
1916. This property covers an area
of 36,000 acres of undulating coun-
try, in every respect well suited
to the requirements of cattle,
the water supply especially com-
mending itself as adequate to the
size of the estate. The Three Moon
and Splinter Creeks, which form the
staple supply, are supplemented by
various tributaries, and by a certain
amount of conservation in the shape
of wells, etc., fonning ample provi-
sion for the 4,000 head of cattle
which are pastured upon this area of
country. In the various properties
owned by Mr. Pownall a great
variety in the quality of soil and
character of the land is included,
indications of which are recognized

WILLIAM THOMAS POW-
NALL, “Dackiel,” Mount Perry,
is the third son of the late John
Pownall, and was born at his
father’s homestead, “Oaklands,” in
1873. After a course of private
tuition at home he was sent
to school in Brisbane, where he
remained until about 1884, in
which year his father crossed
the “Great Divide.” Upon the ter-
mination of his studies he joined the
other members of his family on the
Logan, where for some years he was
associated with his brother in the
management of the grazing pro-
position formerly carried on by
his parent. In 1892 the home
property was sold, and Mr. Pownall
accompanied his brother, Mr. Harry
Pownall, to the Burnett district,
MR. WILLIAM THOMES POWNALL.
where, after making a thorough in-
spection of the available country,
they took up land for grazing pur-
poses, which afterwards became
known as “Kolonga.” At a subse-
quent date further areas were
acquired, including “Langley,”
which was acquired in 1896.
This estate, however, subsequently
was disposed of upon a favour-
able offer being received from
the late Harry J. Bailey. After
carrying on in partnership for some
considerable time the business con-
nection between the two brothers
was dissolved, and the gentleman
under review became proprietor of
“Dackiel,” a property comprising
about 8,100 acres, which had been
taken up by the firm some time
previously. The latter estate at
this time was entirely unim-
proved, but Mr. Pownall was san-
guine of success, and set to work
with energy and perseverance upon
the preliminary work, doing a con-
siderable amount of this with his
own hands, which was no light
undertaking. The subdivision of
the land into paddocks of suitable
size involved the erection of about
15 miles of fencing, and this was
carried out on a system of one
barbed and two plain wires, costing
from £2O to £25 per mile. Ring-
barking also called for immediate
attention, and this work has been
persevered with until at the present
time (1916) the whole area has been
dealt with by the axemen, opening
up much valuable pasture land. The
character of the country on “Dac-
kiel” is undulating, with a few fine
flats on the frontages of the Splinter
and Cattle Creeks, which intersect
the property, and, augmented by
several dams and a couple of wells,
yield an abundant water supply.
The ridges, which occur at frequent
intervals, are of granite and basaltic
formation, and are timbered with
ironbark, which is chiefly confined to
the higher levels, gum and apple-tree
flourishing on the flats. Lime-
stone country is also found within
the boundaries of the estate, and the
whole area is well suited to the re-
quirements of a cattle proposition,

social functions of the place. He
married in 1903 Emily Eowe, young-
est daughter of the late William
Jeynes, of Dalby, and has three
sons and two daughters.


GEORGE CLEMENT OUT-
EIDGE, J.P., “Kerwee,” Mount
Perry, was born in 1880 at Sugarloaf,
near Stanthorpe, where his father,
the late Arthur Henry Outridge—a
MR. ARTHUR HENRY OUTRIDGE.
native of New Zealand, who in 1861,
at 11 years of age, accompanied his
parents to Queensland —had been
appointed master of the local State
school in 1874. Upon leaving
Sugarloaf in 1885 he spent the
following sixteen years as head-
master at the Nundah School, and
in 1901 was appointed to a similar
post at New Farm—in which district
he had received his education—and
here he continued his duties until
within four days of his demise, on
May 22, 1899. He married a
daughter of Mr. W. A. Noble, of
Stanthorpe, by whom he had
issue three sons and one daugh-
ter. The late William Alfred
Noble, was a striking personality,
well worthy of more than passing
mention. Born in New South Wales
in 1825, he turned to seafaring life,
and at the age of 20 was captain of
a whaling vessel and a champion
harpooner. Compelled by rheumatic
trouble to relinquish marine pur-
suits, he obtained a position on
"Durundur” Station, Queensland,
as manager, about 1850. He next
acquired the "Caboolture” pro-
perty and engaged in pastoral
enterprise on his own account, and
as a side issue kept a dairy herd,
carting the butter to Brisbane, a
distance of 40 miles, in a bullock
waggon. Mr. Noble’s encounters
with the blacks were of an exciting
nature, and as his wife and young
family were also at “Caboolture”
these were fraught with much
anxiety. Murders of white people
were of frequent occurrence, and on
one occasion a number of his cattle
were speared. Being too remote for
police assistance, Mr. Noble decided
to interview them alone, and rode
towards their camping-place. The
moment they seized their spears to
attack his rifle spoke with sure result,
the remainder promptly dispersing.
He sold “Caboolture” to reside near
Brisbane for the sake of his child-
ren’s education, and subsequently
became engaged in tin-mining .at
Stanthorpe, where he also estab-
lished a general merchant’s business.
He held the Commission of the
Peace and was closely identified with
the Methodist Church as a lay
preacher, sometimes riding 40 and

50 miles to hold services for the
benefit of the outlying settlers.
After leaving Stanthorpe he eventu-
ally made his home in Toowoomba,
where his death occurred in 1906.
Mr. George Clement Outridge re-
ceived his education under his
father’s tuition, and eventually be-
came a lithographic artist with the
Outridge Printing Co., of Brisbane.
His heart, however, was in bush
life, and finally, in 1907, the
call of the land conquered, and
with his father’s assistance he
bought "Trelinga” Station, nine
miles from Eidsvold, a highly-
improved property of some 9,000
acres, well stocked with sheep and
cattle. Mr. Outridge disposed of
the sheep, finding cattle more suit-
able, but during the seven years
that he remained at “Trelinga” he
suffered the ups and downs of a
pastoralist and gained much prac-
tical experience, finally emerging
from the ordeal unbranded by
failure. In 1914 he sold “Trelinga”
and purchased “Kerwee,” his pre-
sent property, embracing 10,000
acres of grazing farms, together with
50 square miles of occupation leases
at Rawbelle. At “Kerwee” he has
built a comfortable homestead of
modern design, and has completed
much fencing and other improve-
ment work. Mr. Outridge was a
member of the Eidsvold Shire Coun-
cil for seven years, until resigning,
serving as chairman; and holds the
Commission of the Peace. He mar-
ried in 1908 Elsie Lange, eldest
daughter of Mr. C. W. Zillman, of
the Chief Engineer’s Department,
Queensland Government Railways,
and granddaughter of one of the
pioneer Moravian missionaries, who
did great service in civilizing the
blacks in the early days of the State.
There are three .sons of this union.
Mr. Outridge’s elder brother,
Harold, also yielded to the call of
the open life. Passing from the pro-
fession of school teacher to that of
chemist, eventually he joined his
uncle in the pearling industry off
Thursday Island. He lost his life
during the hurricane “Mahina” in
1899, when 50 vessels foundered and
300 coloured men were drowned.

THOMAS PIPER BAILEY,
“Old Cannindah” Station, Mount
Perry, is the eldest son of the late
Thomas Bailey, of the same place,
who came to Queensland from New
MR. THOMAS BAILEY.
South Wales in the year 1860. Upon
reaching man’s estate the late Mr.
Bailey turned his attention to pas-
toral work in New South Wales,
accepting a position as overseer on a
property owned by the Grant family
in that State. He soon proved him-
self very expert in the management
of sheep, and gained the confidence
of his employers in so marked a man-
ner that when they enlarged their
operations by the purchase of “Dal-
gangal’’ Station, in Queensland,
Mr. Bailey was requested by them to
undertake the task of establishing
the flock on the new property.
Accepting the responsibility of this
enterprise, he packed his worldly
belongings in a dray and with his
wife and family set out from Cassilis
township in New South Wales for
his new home, the whole party
travelling in the same primitive
manner, the bullock dray being at
that time the only means of convey-
ance in the district. The journey
was accomplished without mishap,
the only incident standing out in
the memory of the younger portion
of the family being their attendance
at a circus performance when pass-
ing through Dalby. Upon arrival
Mr. Bailey assumed the duties of
overseer and sub-manager at “Mul-
gildie,” an out-station of “Dalgan-
gal,” which was used as a sheep
run, and when at a subsequent date
the Messrs. Grant Bros, disposed
of this portion of their property
Mr. Bailey remained with the
new owners in the same capacity.
Shortly afterwards “Mulgildie”
again changed hands, Messrs. Gil-
christ, Watts, & Co. coming into
possession, by whom his services
were retained until they in turn
sold out to Mr. Kent Weinholt.
Having determined by this time to
make a bid in the direction of inde-
pendent enterprise, Mr. Bailey re-
sio-ned the post of overseer, and
having purchased “Old Cannindah”
Station from Messrs. McKay and
Caswell, in the year 1871, he com-
pleted the task of rebuilding the
original homestead, which under his
practical direction assumed a more
modern aspect and formed a com-
fortabl© dwelling-house for his wife
and family when, in 1874, he
brought them to reside under the
roof which he had prepared for
them. In those days the property
embraced an area of 66 square miles
of country, the major portion con-
sisting of beautiful fertile flats,
intersected by undulating ranges,
which in many places were clothed
with dense bush and grass-tree
growths and well watered by Splin-
ter and Tinnebang Creeks. Although
for many years the property had
been the head station of Messrs.
McKay & Caswell, it was almost
totally unimproved, and Mr. Bailey’s
first business was to take in hand
the important matter of fencing. As
most of the boundary fence had to
be built with split-timber posts and
rails, this work was accomplished
only at heavy expense, the cost
mounting up to some <£6o per mile,
and with the subdivision fences,
for which wire was used,
absorbed most of Mr. Bailey’s time
and energies for the first two years
of his residence on “Old Cannin-
dah.” At the outset he gave his
attention almost exclusively to the
breeding of horses, running neither
sheep nor cattle on the estate, and
considerable success attended his
operations, his colts selling at from
£lB to £25 per head. Realizing,
however, that a change of system
might result in still more satisfac-
tory returns, he inaugurated his
cattle herd with the purchase of
small mobs of mixed cattle of vari-
ous breeds. This departure was
made about the year 1875, and from
that time onward Mr. Bailey de-
voted himself to the building up of
his cattle proposition with excellent
results. He died in 1890, having
placed to his credit a record of
worthy pioneering work of over half
a century’s duration in the Mother
State and in Queensland—nearly the
whole of his 74 years being engaged
in the pastoral industry. The sub-
ject of this memoir, Mr. Thomas P.
Bailey, received his scholastic in-
struction from a private tutor, his

studies being varied with practical
experiences in cattle-raising and
station work generally. He came
with his parents to Queensland in
the year 1860, and after the death


of his father undertook control of
the home property in the interests
of the family. Embarking upon a
vigorous policy of improvement, he
pushed on ringbarking and clearing
of the original estate fell to the
Crown at the expiration of the lease
under which it had been taken up,
and Mr. Bailey then secured, under
the provisions of the Act providing
improvement work which has been
completed being the erection of dips
and suitable drafting yards. In
1902 the tick pest appeared, and
owing to the non-inoculation of
operations, by this means rapidly
improving the value of the land as
a grazing area, especially in the
vicinity of the homestead. In 1893
half of the station area was resumed
by the Government under an Act
which had been passed to promote
closer settlement, and finally the
run was cut up into three blocks,
one of which was secured by Mr.
Charles Bailey, a brother of the

for priority, the homestead block of
8,500 acres, the balance being un-
improved and useless as an indi-
vidual holding. Taking up this
block on behalf of his father’s estate,
he purchased on his own account

block of “New Cannindah” compris-
ing about 4,000 acres, and a further
area of 1,300 acres on the “Yarrol”

other two, though lost to the family
for a time, were repurchased by
Mr. Bailey in 1901 and 1915 re-
spectively. In 1903 the other half
consist of ironbark ridges, other
timbers being bloodwood, oak, wat-
ties, and several species of gum.
Upon these blocks he runs about

effects of the double disaster had
practically disappeared. Subsequent
droughts, when threatening, have
been prepared for by a disposal of

being retained. Mr. Bailey in-
terests himself in the public
affairs of the district, and is a
member of the Pastoralists’ Asso-
ciation. He is unmarried, and
resides at the old homestead with
his brother and two sisters, and in
this connection it is worthy of men-
tion that his lengthy experience and
excellent judgment have always been
placed at the disposal of the other
members of his family, who freely
recognize their value, the widow and
children of his brother James, who
purchased land at Boompa and met
his death through an accident in
1892, especially relying on his advice
in regard to the administration of
their property.
CLIVE ELLIOT CASWELL,
“New Cannindah” Station, Mount
Perry, is a son of the late Henry
Drew Caswell, and grandson of the
late Commander William Caswell,
R.N., who fought in the wars against
Napoleon, and also took part in the
American War of Independence,
subsequently coming to New South
Wales with his wife, one son, and
one daughter in 1830. He received

Government, and settling in the
COMMANDER WILLIAM CASWELL.
Hunter River district, at Port
Stevens, entered upon pastoral pur-
suits, and resided there until shortly
before his death, which occurred at
sea on his way to England. Six
daughters and a son were born to
him in New South Wales, the date
of birth of the latter (Henry Drew
Caswell) being 1834. Educated at
the Normal Institution, Sydney,
where he concluded his studies in
1851, Mr. H. D. Caswell entered
mercantile life in the Union Bank
of Australia, Sydney, and after a
year’s connection with that institu-
tion returned to the Hunter River
to take over the management of his
father’s properties. When the Ben-
digo gold rush occurred he proceeded
to the diggings, where he met with
some success, and in the year 1858
he made his first trip to Queensland,
and in partnership with Patrick
McKay purchased “Cannindah”
Station, then known as “Splinter
Creek,” which property still remains
in the hands of the two families.
Mr. H. D. Caswell married Jane
Nixon, youngest daughter of Mr.
Archibald Blake, of Liverpool, Eng-
land, the marriage taking place at
Raymond Terrace, New South Wales,
in the year 1859, and shortly after-
wards they took up their residence
on “Cannindah.” Mr. Caswell
selected a portion of the resumed
“Holinga” area, and for a short
time was in possession of “Palpar-
ara” Station, near Blackall, which
he held in partnership with Mr. H.
M. Hughes. He also owned “Ten-
ningering” Station for some years.
In 1878 he purchased the homestead
of “Euston,” near Toowoomba,
where he died in 1887. Of a family
of six daughters and two sons, all
but one daughter survived him. The
elder son, Mr, Clive Elliot Caswell,
at the age of nine years was sent to
Southey’s Boarding School, Oak-
lands, Mittagong, and afterwards
attended the Toowoomba Grammar
School, where he completed his
scholastic course at 17 years of age,
returning to the paternal rooftree at
“New Cannindala” in 1884. The
area of “New Cannindah” at that
time extended over 320 square
miles, the original run having em-
braced “Old Cannindah” and 180
square miles of country in the direc-
tion of Many Peaks, known as
“Bompa,” the latter area having
been resumed for closer settlement
early in this century. Upon the
decease of Mr. H. D. Caswell in
1887 the various estates passed into
the hands of the family trustees, of
whom Mr. Clive Caswell was one,
and to him was entrusted the
general management of the joint

interests pertaining to his relatives
and himself. At the present time,
in addition to “New Cannindah,”
he controls the “Redcliffe” Estate
on the Dawson River, comprising an
area of 230 miles, and “Coother-
stone,” in the Claremont district,
with an area of 400 miles, while he
is also personally interested in other
large pastoral properties. “New
Cannindah,” which now consists of
75 square miles, plus 10,000 acres
of freehold, includes both flat and
undulating country, timbered in
certain parts with ironbark, gum,
bloodwood, box, etc. It is well im-
proved, the fencing being substantial
and up-to-date, the homestead com-
modious and comfortable, and the
dips sufficiently numerous to pre-
vent the necessity of long journeys
for the stock, while very fine crops
are produced on the lucerne flats.
“Redcliffe,” situated on Mimosa
Creek, is also very well developed,
being fenced and subdivided and
provided with windmills and oil
engines for the purpose of pumping
water from wells which have been
sunk in several localities. This
estate is used chiefly for breeding
purposes, serving as a nursery to
“New Cannindah,” and carries
about 8,000 head of breeders and
young cattle.


Agriculture.
A GENERAL SURVEY OF THE GROWTH OF THE INDUSTRY.
Agriculture in Queensland, like many other Aus-
tralian industries, had its genesis in the penal days.
Nowhere can authentic evidence be found that the
aborigines raised or tended crops of any description.
Their gins and lubras dug yams and fern roots, but
Nature did all the gardening for them. They had
periods during which they lived almost wholly upon
vegetable diet, just as they had other periods when fish
or ’possum, kangaroo, and bandicoot was the chief item
of the menu. These periods were seasonal, and always
marked the ripening of certain berries, fruits, and
nuts, the Bunya nut feasts being typical of them all.
The whites, therefore, had no lead to follow so far as
the natives were concerned. They brought their own
seeds and plants, and only by experience learned which
were most suitable to the soil and climate. In Miss
Constance Petrie’s (now Mrs. G. P. Stuart) book,
“Keminiscences of Tom Petrie” (her father) are to be
found many interesting glimpses into the agricultural
life of the early days of the Moreton Bay settlement.
From these, as from every other available source, it
becomes clear that the first attempts to make the soil
yield produce for the sustenance of man were limited to
the most rudimentary methods of gardening. Small
plots were enclosed and tended by convicts, the impres-
sion being at first that the work, even though the results
should be insignificant, would at least keep the prisoners
busy. The wonderful prolificness of the soil, however,
and the fact that the climate permitted two and some-
times three crops a year to be raised, soon convinced
the officials that gardening had great possibilities, and
ere long quite extensive crops, for those days, of maize
were being grown and harvested.
So gardening was amplified until the vegetable
needs of the small community were almost continuously
provided for. Possibly had not so much developmental
work been necessary in other ways, both inside and out-
side the settlement, it might have occurred to the official
mind that Moreton Bay readily could have been made
to produce the wherewithal to form a system of ex-
change with the mother settlement in New South Wales.
History shows, however, that if any thought of building
up such a basis of independence ever entered the official
mind it was not carried into execution. Indeed, even
the spirit and foresight displayed by Joseph during the
seven fat years in Egypt of old were absent, and it is
BB
on record that when an unfavourable spell of weather
happened, and the crops suffered or failed, the com-
munity went on “short commons” or “did without”
until supplies could be obtained from New South Wales.
Thus was a splendid opportunity missed at the first of
making Queensland an agricultural-producing centre,
and for many a year the same spirit of laissez faire,
later on followed by the antagonism of the squatters to
farming and farming interests, made of the colony an
agricultural importing centre rather than that which
time and energy have proved it to be so admirably
adapted for—a large and successful exporter of food-
stuffs.
Still, very considerable progress was made during
the penal days, and when in 1842 the whole district was
proclaimed a free settlement there was ample evidence
that the value of the soil and the climate were fully
appreciated in some quarters. Both Dr. Lang and
the late William Coote in their works, when dealing
with those early days, made mention of the growth of
gardening into the wider significance of agriculture,
and some surprise was expressed at the abundant yields
of the chief crop —maize. The proclamation seems to
have given an impetus to those most closely concerned
with the advancement of the settlement, and Dr. Lang
in his “Cook’s Land,” under date 1847, laid particular
stress upon the great efforts made in the gardens of the
officials to test the growth and value of tropical fruits,
sugar, and cotton. The spirit to extend operations also
had seized upon the little communities, and when
Patrick Leslie, with his convict servant Peter Murphy,
attracted by the glowing account of the fertility of the
country across the range which Allan Cunningham had
discovered in 1827, fared forth to the Downs, he
set the fashion for migration not only from New South
Wales, but from the Moreton Bay coast. Beginning
in 1840 rapid settlement followed, and soon vast tracts
of the Downs were taken up as sheep runs.
At first gardening was carried on, as on the coast,
to obtain home supplies of table vegetables only. In
some instances, however, squatters less limited in vision
or desire than their more exclusive fellows made ex-
periments in the growing of cereals. But it was not
until the advent of small selectors many years later that
the agricultural development was represented by more
than mere patches of corn, vegetables, and fruit-trees.


No greater material progress was made on the coast,
but when the “Fortitude” arrived in 1849 witli many
farmers on board, new interest was aroused in the
industry. Major Boyd tells ns that gangs of convicts
felled the scrub on the banks of the Brisbane River
adjacent to the barracks; with the hoe they planted
maize among the stumps and tree-trunks under the con-
stant surveillance of armed guards, and when the com
was ripe dragged it in carts to the windmill (now the
site of the Observatory) on Wickham Terrace. There
the maize was ground into “hominey,” an important
item in the menu of those days, as it still remains in
the penal establishments throughout Australia. Mean-
while the “Fortitude” immigrants, with a band of
Moravian missionaries, took up land at what is now
known as Nundah, and became “the real pioneers of
agriculture in the infant settlement.”
It was Dr. Lang’s intention that these immigrants
should establish the cultivation of cotton, a crop which
he had every reason to believe would be eminently
suitable to the soil and the climate. Heavy crops were
obtained from the river flats, and the quality of the
cotton was of high grade; but owing to the difficulty
of obtaining cheap labour for the picking the venture
was not successful until after the outbreak of the Ameri-
can civil war in 1861, when the cotton-spinners of Lanca-
shire were glad to pay almost any price for the supplies
available in Queensland. When America again started
producing full supplies the Queensland growers found
it impossible to compete, and the growing of cotton gave
place to crops of more trade value. The vision of Dr.
Lang, however, was made manifest during the short
period of success. His was the big Australian idea of
making the colony an exporter of agricultural commodi-
ties necessary to the old-world countries where primary
production had taken a secondary place to industrial
activity. Possibly far greater progress would have been
made along these lines but for the antagonism of the
pastoralists. They saw hope for the young colony only
in the raising of sheep and cattle and the exportation
of wool, tallow, and hides. They strenuously objected
to agriculture as a waste of time and (more self-
interestedly) as a probable usurper of the best of the
lands they held at peppercorn rentals. Certainly the
squatters developed Dr. Lang’s ideas along their own
lines, and by their pertinacity helped to make Queens-
land the great producer she is of wool and meat; but
Dr. Lang aimed at the birth and growth of an in-
dependent yeomanry, the squatters’ activities resulted
mainly in the building up of two well-defined classes in
the'country—rich employers and badly-paid employes.
But the pastoralists were not to have it all their
own way in the shaping of the industrial destiny of the
community. Other factors were introduced or obtruded
themselves which made agricultural development of
some sort imperative. The discovery of gold opened
up wide possibilities for the free immigrants who
were steadily being brought from Home. As rush fol-
lowed rush and the mining centres settled down to
productive work, the demand for fresli foodstuffs gave
ample scope for those men who had “no honey-tooth
for gold” to make a lucrative living at farming, and
they availed themselves of the opportunities offered.
The antagonism of the squatters to anything but pas-
toral development, however, was very strong, and
wherever the agriculturists made progress they felt the
heavy hand of their power. The pastoralists had pre-
dominating influence in Parliament, and it was easy for
them to secure pre-emptive rights by which they con-
verted large blocks of the best land into freehold. They
also obtained possession of “strategic areas” by which
“they were able to close against settlement immense
tracts pre-eminently suitable for farming.” Dealing
with this jiarticular phase a writer in “Our First Half-
Century” said: —“To such an extent was the right of
pre-emption used that many squatters seriously crippled
themselves, the price paid being too high for grazing to
be remunerative on their freehold lands. W hen, in
after years, it would have been to their advantage to
subdivide and sell to farmers, it was not in thier power
to give titles. In the course of time railways were built
through some of these large estates, but their earning
power was seriously hampered by country capable of
supporting a very large agricultural population beinsg
devoted to pasturing sheep and cattle. As the most
satisfactory solution of the difficulty, successive Govern-
ments have repurchased a number of properties at a
cost exceeding a million sterling, and resold them in
small areas to farmers, with highly gratifying results
both to the settlers and the State.”
With the development of the gold-mining industry
and the rapid increase in population both in the
country districts and the coastal settlements and centres,
the demand for agricultural produce, however, in-
creased, and the artificial interference of the squatters
was not sufficiently powerful to block the growth of
farming altogether. The best and most accessible areas
being closed against them, selectors were forced to take
up scrub lands “on steep mountain slopes and in river
pockets which were useless to stockowners.” But they
were a persevering crowd. Facing the virgin bush,
often far away from any semblance of a road, they set
to work with axe and saw and fire, and literally hewed
and burned their holdings out from the heart of the
dense undergrowth. Corn was planted as they cleared,
the seed being sown almost haphazard on the blackened
soil, and here and there favourable places were selected
for table vegetables. Pumpkins also were grown, and
on this meagre vegetable fare many of these “cockles,”
as they were called, worked their way to independence.


Their life at first was hard, and even to-day there are
a few of these original selectors alive who tell of sub-
sisting for months at a stretch on nothing but black tea,
ground or powdered corn, and pumpkins.
The predatory raids of bush birds and animals
made severe inroads on the crops, but with the growth
of settlement, the erection of fences, and the intro-
duction of livestock upon the holdings, the native pil-
lagers were driven back into the bush. The making of
roads and the growth of traffic also had their effect, and
gradually farming centres were formed which to-day
support one of the most prosperous and contented sec-
tions of the community. The old laborious methods of
cultivation by grub-axe, spade, and hoe have given
place to the most up-to-date systems. Maize, pumpkins,
inaccessible scrub, they were at least within the region
of heavy rainfall, and, even where some distance from
permanent streams, suffered little from drought.
Settlers who went over the range, profiting by the ex-
perience of the pastoral pioneers regarding the viccisi-
tudes of climate, avoided the mistake of relying upon a
single crop, or, to use a homely phrase, of putting all
their eggs in one basket—an error which brought ruin
to thousands upon thousands of the people who flocked
from the Atlantic seaboard to the arid regions of
America, west of the Mississippi. Mixed farming
became the general rule on the further side of the Main
Range, so that, if wheat or maize fields failed, the
farmers had their flocks and herds and their shearing
cheques as a stand-by until the next harvest was

and potatoes still remain standard crops, but to these
have been added lucerne, sorghum, and other fodder
crops valuable both for trading purposes and for the
building up of that great asset of the State, the dairying
industry. What the development of agriculture would
have been to-day without the antagonism of the early
pastoralists no one can say; but this it is only just to
record, that without the untiring work and the splendid
self-sacrifice of the original “cockies" the present pro-
sperous condition of the industry would have been
impossible.
An interesting comparison has been drawn by Major
Boyd between our early agricultural settlers and those
of the United States and Canada. “Though our
early selectors," be wrote, “were driven into almost
bb2
garnered. It is sometimes said with scorn that there is
comparatively little real farming in Queensland; but
the conditions peculiar to settlement in the State are
responsible for the trend of agricultural development.
In the United States and Canada, the flood of immi-
gration and the part played by the great railway com-
panies as landowners and promoters of settlement to
provide traffic for their railways led to the creation of
small holdings, which in turn led to intense cultivation
of field and orchard crops. In Queensland immigration
has never been conducted on an extensive scale, and,
indeed, for over a decade almost ceased. There was no
great demand for land, and as the mistaken belief long
prevailed that the quantity of arable land was small,
the area of so-called agricultural farms was made


sufficiently large to enable a man to make a living
from stock-raising, dairying, and pig-breeding. Field
labourers being scarce and stock cheap, the farmer’s aim
has rather been to grow feed for his stock than crops for
human consumption. He has followed the line of least
resistance, so using his land to carry on his operations
with family labour and a little casual assistance during
the busy season.”
That our agriculturists were wise has been proven
by subsequent events. Labour in the rural districts
has grown steadily clearer, and even with a succession
of fair seasons the limitation of the farmers’ activities
to cereal and corn growing, with the consequent
employment of men all too frequently given to
“striking,” could not have proved remunerative. By
the adoption of mixed farming and the use of family
labour progress has been achieved where otherwise
failure, or at least stagnation, could have been expected.
And although in many instances parents who themselves
had had to strain and contrive and battle strenuously
to build up their homes and holdings worked their
own children by far too long and too closely, the result,
taken by and large, has been to make the industry
self-contained and stable. Unconsciously to numbers
of the farmers, too, they have been building up to
the inevitable development of the agricultural future —
co-operation. The tendency of the unionized workers
has been to make seasonal employment sufficiently
profitable to pay for living expenses for the year. This,
of course, cuts out any possibility of our farmers’ suc-
cessful competition in normal times with countries
where cheap labour is available. Co-operation conse-
quently must ensue, and with it will come the greater
and closer settlement of many areas, for the rural
workers themselves will have to become producers, or
migrate to the towns and take up employment for which
most of them are totally unsuited.
As a result of this growth of mixed farming there
has been an astounding development in dairying and
pig-breeding with all their accompanying employment
in secondary industries. Both these branches of farm-
ing, together with lamb fattening, are the direct result
of local conditions upon agriculture, but they have
proved to be so jDayable that the great and rapid ex-
tension of the agricultural industry is assured. For
many years past there has been an almost constant
resumption by the State of millions of acres of land held
under pastoral lease to meet the growing demand for
closer settlement. Now, with the repatriation of our
soldiers and the desire that provision shall be made to
attract British soldiers when they shall have been
demobilized or discharged, it is certain that a still
greater proportion of resumption will have to be made.
The adequate population of the State depends almost
entirely upon closer land settlement. The coastal lands
—south, central, and northern—have been proved; the
Downs and the south-east have been proved; and on
the limitless areas of the west already have sprung up
agricultural centres which year by year extend and
attract fresh settlers. Slowly but steadily the destiny of
the State forms itself out of the past and the present,
and the independent yeomanry which Dr. Lang dreamed
of appears to be the inevitable outcome. It will have
taken long to evolve as years are counted in Australia,
but measured by the standards of the Old World the
several stages leading to the desired end have been
rapid indeed.
THE SCOPE OF FARMING.
The scope of farming in Queensland has been set
out under several heads as follows: —“The most profit-
able crops are those for which there is a world-wide
demand but only a limited area of production, and
therefore little competition for the grower; or, altern-
atively, crops which by reason of natural advantages
the farmer can produce more abundantly and at less
cost than his competitors. Next in value are crops for
which he has a monopoly in a limited but protected
market, or enjoys natural advantages which give him a
partial monopoly in such a market. Of less value, but
still profitable,, are crops which he can place on the
market as cheaply as his rivals.” Dairying and pig-
breeding come under the first head. There is world-
wide demand for the produce from both branches, and
Queensland has all the natural advantages necessary
to make well-directed enterprise in them both successful
and lucrative. These facts our farmers have turned
to profit with an energy which has been almost sur-
prising of late years. Less than thirty years ago the
greater part of the butter used in the colony was
imported from the south. That, it would appear, was
one of the natural results of a policy of free trade,
for when in 1888 a protective tariff was introduced, the
dairying industry began to make rapid progress. The
Government of that day, too, made additional provision
for the growth of the industry by sending out experts
in charge of travelling dairies. As in the southern
colonies progress was rapid, and very soon followed the
evolution of home-made butter into the factory-produced
article. Just a year before that—in 1887—a Depart-
ment of Agriculture was started. The objective was
to inaugurate and encourage the introduction of labour-
saving machinery, new and improved methods in cul-
tivation and manipulation of crops, the introduction of
new seeds and plants, and the inaugurating of annual
conferences (which have been largely successful in
extending the benefits of scientific and enlightened
enquiry among agricultural, pastoral, and horticultural
producers. These conferences have widened the know-
ledge of our farmers as to the various phases of the

industry as carried on in different parts of the world,
and have induced habits of thought and work which
have led to practical experiments with soil, climate, and
products which are always necessary to prove the value
or worthlessness of new theories in agriculture as applied
under special conditions. A splendid part of the early
work of this Department was the establishment of an
Agricultural College at Gatton. Experience had proved
the necessity of training the youth of the country in
practical and theoretical agriculture and of providing
advanced object-lessons and training in various branches
of the industry for those already engaged in agricul-
tural pursuits. The work was approached with enthu-
siasm and carried out with energy. The College was
founded upon a vast area combining river flats of rich
alluvial deposit and ridges of inferior quality, and all
eminently suited for experimental work. Several hun-
dred acres are suitable for irrigation purposes, and with
a plentiful supply of water in the Lockyer River, which
borders the farm on one side, work on these lines can
easily be carried out. The buildings are all constructed
on the most modern plan, lighted by electricity, and
every attention has been given to the hygienic
aspect of such an institution devoted to the training
of young men.
Experiment farms also have been established in
different parts of the State, and the work carried on
has been most undoubtedly beneficial to the agricul-
tural industry generally. The effect of these special
provisions, however, has been very particularly felt in
the dairying branch, and in no other public activity
has such astonishing progress been made.
The Dairying Industry.
Dairying is one of the newest but one of the most
important sources of Queensland’s wealth. The industry
practically started on a large scale with the century, and
subsequent development has been phenomenal. Not only
have the oversea exports shown a sustained and rapid
growth, but the quantities of butter each year sent to
the southern States is continually increasing.
As among the Australian States, Queensland
occupies a unique record in regard to dairying. Whilst
the butter production of Victoria and most of New South
Wales stands practically suspended during the colder
portion of each winter, the temperate nature of the May-
August period in the more northern State enables the
output of milk and butter to be maintained uninter-
rupted all the year round. The consequence is that the
Melbourne and Sydney markets draw upon Queensland
to a considerable extent for supplies during the
colder months. Large quantities of Queensland butter
have also been shipped to Western Australia.
A very large area of the State is naturally suited
to meeting the requirements of dairy farmers. Practic-
ally the whole of the coastal strip, extending from
Cooktown, in the far north, to Tweed Heads, on the
borders of New South Wales, is fitted for the profitable
production of butter, cheese, and condensed milk. In
the interior, possible dairying land runs out to as far
west as Emerald, and in the southern district to beyond
Roma. In the south the dairying land extends west
from the coast for at least 300 miles, and in places to
considerably further. Very much of the dairying land
consists of rolling downs and grassy slopes. In many
instances these are lightly timbered, so that herds are
afforded a natural shelter from the extremes of the
climate. For many years the Darling Downs was the
only part of the State producing butter for export ; but
the industry is now thoroughly established on a stable
basis in the Lockyer, Stanley, Fassifern, Logan, Mara-
noa, Wide Bay, Burnett, Blackall, and Central Districts;
whilst in the north the industry is being successfully
applied in the Mackay, Bowen, Lower Burdekin (Ayr),
Charters Towers, Herbert River, Johnstone River, Tully
River, and the Cairns districts. The possibilities of a
rapid further expansion in the Atherton district are
particularly promising.
The rapidity with which dairying has grown is made
apparent by the fact that, whilst 780,000 lb. of butter
had to be imported annually some twenty years ago, in
1913 35,199,387 lb. were manufactured within the State,
in addition to 5,395,050 lb. of cheese. During 1913 the
following quantity of butter was examined by Govern-
ment inspectors as being destined for export:
The change has been brought about by the
co-operative system of establishing butter factories. In
the old days farmers sold home-made butter to the local

The following table illustrates the progress made by the
industry during the years of its most rapid growth:
Accompanying the improved market for cream, a
considerable improvement has taken place in the dairying
stock throughout the State. To no small extent this has
been due to the educational efforts put forward by the
Agricultural Department. Qualified officers have been
appointed for the purpose of periodically visiting each
of the dairying districts and testing the herds of indi-
vidual breeders. A result has been the weeding out of
the less productive animals, and a selection for stud
purposes of the strains of blood yielding the greatest
amount of butter-fat. With the aid of these officials
some interesting particulars were obtained about three
years ago of cattle in use in the Darling Downs, West
Moreton, North Coast, and Beaudesert districts, the
total number of cows dealt with being 7,073. The
following facts were established :
“The highest average milk yield of a herd of cows
per diem was 21'4 lb. of milk per cow.
“Mean average milk yield of a herd of cows per
diem was 12'2 lb. of milk per cow.
“Lowest average yield of a herd of cows per diem was
5'3 lb. of milk per cow.
“Highest average butter-fat test of the milk of a
herd was 4'9 per cent, butter-fat.
“Lowest average butter-fat test of the milk nf a
herd was 33 per cent, butter-fat.
“Highest average commercial butter yield of a herd
of cows per diem was LO6 lb. commercial
butter per cow.
“Lowest average commercial butter yield of a herd
of cows per diem was T 6 lb. per cow.
“In comparing the returns of two herds, each con-
sisting of forty milch cows, for a similar
period of lactation of, say, 300 days in each
instance, and applying the above actual
highest and lowest yield of commercial butter
at a valuation of lOd. per lb., we find the
following figures are revealed:
“The herd of forty cows, with an average produc-
tion of I‘o6 lb. of commercial butter per cow
per diem, in 300 days would return £530,
and the herd of forty cows, with an average
production of T 6 lb. of commercial butter
per cow per diem, in 300 days would return
only £BO, leaving a difference of £450
between the earning capacity of the herd of
highest production and that of the herd of
lowest productive capabilities.
“Applying the above figures of productiveness in the
same ratio to the whole of the dairy stock in
this State, which are set down as 365,000 in
number, we get the following comparative
results :
“365,000 milch cows of the highest average produc-
tion would, in 300 days, return £4,830,000.
“365,000 milch cows of the lowest average produc-
tion would, in 300 days, return £730,000.
“Compared on a tonnage basis it is found that
365,000 cows of the higher standard of pro-
ductiveness would yield 51,750 tons of butter
in 300 days.
“And 365,000 cows of the lower standard of pro :
ductiveness would yield 7,821 tons of butter
in 300 days.”
Dairying offers greater facilities for earning an
early independence to men of small capital than does
any other Australian industry. Practically all the
requirements for making a first start are contained in
an established reputation for understanding the rudi-
ments of the business and a stable character. Few
holders of large areas of land suitable for butter
production care to themselves launch into the industry on
a big scale, employing the necessary labour. The reason
advanced for this attitude is that hands are difficult to
obtain and the work requires constant supervision. The
result of experience has caused the land-owners to prefer
hiring out their properties to small farmers on a rental
based on sharing the production. A man who is able to
milk, and especially if he has a family able to assist him,
may in this way borrow land for his purpose, and if he
has no money may usually obtain the use of a herd from
his landlord. The latter takes a proportion of the yield
in return for the use of his land and capital. Neither
incurs any cash liability and both benefit from good
seasons. Unlike enterprise in wheat-growing or many
other industries, the income is earned at once. The
factories pay for milk fortnightly, and the farmer is able
to pay his current expenses from the beginning of his
business without drawing on capital. Very many free-
holders, who now are wealthy men, have made their first
start as share farmers, in a very few years being able

to pay part of the purchase money of farms and quickly
work off the remaining mortgages.
The intending farmer does not require a large
amount of capital to enable him to start on land of his
own, though probably he will not be able to command
the use of so large a herd in this way as if he was to
make his beginning on the share system. More difficulty
may be experienced in finding suitable Crown lands
available for selection than in securing a piece of some
large estate to be rented on shares or on a straight-out
rental. The dairyman must be near a butter factory
or a railway line. In cases of very heavily timbered land
the cost of clearing may represent as large an outlay
as the amount of purchase money of equally fertile
freehold already alienated. However, with a sufficient
quantity of such country the dairyman can usually be
earning money with a herd which he keeps increasing as
he continues ojaening his land to the growing pastures.
Crown lands are obtained on very easy terms of
payment, and a man who is determined to work hard for
the first two or three years may safely start dairying on
a 160-acre block with a capital of from £2OO to £3OO.
Considerable assistance is granted to settlers by the State
Agricultural Bank, which makes advances at the rate
£1 for £1 up to £2OO for buildings, ringbarking, clearing,
fencing, draining, or water conservation. The same
institution also advances 12s. in the £1 of a fair estimated
value of the holding, with the improvements made and
proposed to be made. These advances are repayable in
instalments extending over a period of twenty-five years,
with 5 per cent, added for interest.
The Agricultural Department has devoted a great
deal of attention to collecting information for the intend-
ing settler, and the following is an approximate estimate,
based on official figures, of the cost of starting a dairy
farm of 160 acres:
In addition to the above it may be interesting to
give a practical instance of a dairyman who bought land
from a private vendor and commenced his industry under
circumstances in all ways typical of hundreds of others.
This selector paid £5 Is. 3d. per acre for a holding of
200 acres, and of the purchase money he paid £lOO as
deposit. In addition, during his first year, he paid
£4OO for eighty cows at £5 per head. The latter were
young springers bought from the owners of the estate
and paid for at the rate of ss. per week, an arrangement
w-hich permitted of their cost being met from the fort-
nightly milk cheque received from the butter factory.
Thus from the first year’s outlay was paid the whole
purchase money of a large herd and a considerable sum
of the purchase money of the freehold of the land. The
This selector milked forty of his eighty cows during
the first year, and during the first April his cheque for
milk and cream amounted to £3B, whilst during August
and September the monthly cheques on each occasion
came to £26. The receijhs for the first year came to
£IOO, of which £3OO was from the sale of cream and
£IOO from the disposal of pigs. The farmer expected
his second year’s returns to amount to at least £650.
Instances of dairy farmers starting with but the
most slender capital and working in two or three years to
comfortable positions might be multiplied indefinitely.
There is perhaps no industry in the world offering such
opportunities for rapid advancement from the smallest
beginnings as does dairying in Queensland. However, it
would not be correct to assume that, under present
industrial methods, enterprise in dairying is not subjected
to a certain amount of risk. In the past considerable
loss has been caused to dairy farmers by periodical visi-
tations of drought, and in the case of men beginning
operations on new holdings the set-back on occasions has
proved ruinous.
In the older settled districts means for overcoming
drought are each year becoming more firmly established.
The dairy farmer is not called upon to fight such long
periods of rainlessness as bring destruction to the fax-
western pastoral industry, where whole years may elapse


without sufficient falls occurring to produce a growth of
pasturage. In the dairying districts the droughts are
of comparatively short duration; but if proper provision

has not been made against them in the way of fodder
storage, the effects may be intense. Very much of the
soil in the dairying districts is porous in texture, so that
evaporation of moisture proceeds rapidly during the hot
weather. During long spells of dry weather, country of
this character cracks on its surface, and large quantities
of rain are needed to produce beneficial results. In
certain of the dairying districts, and particularly on the
worked into a fine tilth, which forms a kind of blanket
and prevents the joenetration of the air. This is an
application of the main principle of American dry-farm-
ing, which has been brought to a high pitch of develop-
ment, and has served to conquer the desert in the arid
west of that country. Another plan which has brought
great success to the few Queensland dairy farmers who
have used it is the systematic conservation of fodder. In

Downs, so slight is the water-holding capacity of the

useful growth during a drought of not long duration.
no way can fodder be so successfully kept as in the form
of ensilage. Industry, except in a pioneering skeleton
form, is as yet in such an early stage of development that


but little headway has been made by the great majority
of farmers to protect their enterprises against the effects
of possible climatic adversity. But in individual
instances, where the dairy farmer has adopted a far-
seeing policy of meeting the requirements of the future,
the wisdom of the expenditure entailed in money and
energy has become abundantly evident at the first spell
of dry weather. Several methods are in use for making
ensilage. Some farmers merely dig a hole in the ground
and bury the fodder. So long as water and air are
excluded the results are perfectly satisfactory. But the
more reliable plan is by the construction of silos.
The approximate cost of silos, built on holdings
reasonably adjacent to facilities for the transport of
material, is 20s. per ton in reinforced concrete, 12s. 6d.
per ton in wood, and 15s. per ton in galvanized iron lined
with concrete. Most silos in Queensland have a capacity
of about one hundred tons of fodder. As far back as
1911 there were ninety-seven farms in Queensland
making ensilage, which in the twelve months aggregated
5,804 tons, and was valued at £12,000. Since then a
slow increase has taken place in the use of ensilage, but
the development has not been proportionate to the estab-
lished benefits of the method.
The advantages of ensilage making are perhaps not
more substantial in any part of the world than they are
in Queensland, where the wealth of growth of all kinds
of herbage at certain seasons of the year is remarkably
prolific, and where disastrous droughts appear with
monotonous regularity. When the climatic conditions
are favourable, an inevitable waste of nutritious herbage
occurs through all the dairying districts of the State.
The farms do not contain enough stock to eat down the
natural pastures, and no immediate use exists for any of
the artificially grown crops. For the dairyman to pro-
vide against drought is merely a matter of gathering
in the herbage when it is plentiful, and storing it for
use when less favourable conditions prevail. Mr. E.
Graham, the Queensland Government Dairy Expert, has
stated : —“The general use of silos should place Queens-
land in the premier position of any dairying country in
the world, and be an insurance against the 'dry snaps’
we from time to time must- face. . . . Canada boasts
of over half a million silos. The cold winter conditions
make the silo essential in such countries, but in Queens-
land the ensilage could mostly be used for swelling
profits.”
The dairying industry is based upon co-operation.
Not only is a kind of working partnership frequently the
basis of land tenure, under which the farmer works a
freehold farm, but the butter factories are mostly com-
panies in which the shares are held by the producers.
The establishemnt of co-operatively owned butter
factories has been liberally encouraged by the State.
Loans are advanced to these enterprises, repayment
being in fourteen years, and the interest being at 4 per
cent.
Of recent years cheese-making has been assuming
growing importance, and an increasing number of fac-
tories have been established to turn out this product.
Whether the producer receives most profit from his milk
being turned into butter or into cheese depends on the
respective prices of the two commodities on the overseas
market. The most fortunately situated country is that
possessing machinery and facilities for the manufacture
of both products. A large quantity of capital has been
invested by private firms in the establishment of con-
densed milk factories, which are continually increasing
their output. Bacon factories, which are also extending
their operations, depend largely on dairying for their
existence. Bacon is beginning to rank as an important
article of export.
CEREALS AND MINOR CROPS.
Let us now take a passing survey of the State as a
producer of crops. Under the heading of crops for
which our farmers enjoy a monopoly in a limited but-
protected market—or natural advantages which are
equivalent to a partial monopoly—are sugar, maize,
tomatoes, tropical and citrous fruits, and cigar tobacco.
The Commonwealth tariff gives Queensland a practical
monopoly for sugar. She has a virtual monopoly for
tropical fruits, being the only State in which these are
produced in excess of requirements. The warmer
climate and earlier crop give her temporary command
of the southern markets for citrous fruits, tomatoes,
maize, and a number of minor pro-ducts before they
mature in the cooler south —an advantage that will
extend in time to many other crops with the increasing
interchange arising from interstate free trade. Chief
among products which can be placed as cheaply on the
market as in other countries are the cereals. Queens-
land has all the essentials of a great grain-producing
country, and there can be little doubt that in the near
future she will take her place as a large grain-exporting
centre.
Queensland possesses a wider variety of agricultural
resources than can be claimed for many countries.
Whilst tropical crops are profitably grown along the
coastal districts, wheat flourishes on the inland slopes,
and on the southern tablelands horticulturists are culti-
vating a continually extending area with British fruits.
The number of Queensland’s products lias never been
limited by the characteristics of her soils or climate, for
the unique diversity of these are as yet but barely
realized. In the coastal regions sugar growing has
proved so profitable that scarcely anything has been done
by private enterprise in experimenting with other
crops, whilst in the vast interior land has been so cheap
and settlement so scattered that only a first beginning

has been made in either growing fodder crops or pro-
ducing cereals. Official estimates have set the area of
the State as fitted for wheat growing at 50,000,000
acres; but yet, of the 4,000,000 bushels needed annu-
ally for local consumption, more than half usually has
to be imported.
During recent years agriculture has shown a steady
increase in Queensland, both in the aggregate area
cultivated and in the per capita average production.
From 1904 to 1913 the area under cultivation increased
from 577,896 to 920,010 acres. The value of primary
products for 1912 was estimated to be equal to .£29 Bs. Id.
for each of the population, and for 1913 it was officially
calculated to be £34 16s. 2d.
An important feature in the agriculture of any
country lies in the average size of the areas cultivated.
The following table shows the number of farmers cultivat-
ing their land during 1913, together with the individual
areas treated and the distribution of the industry over
the various districts of the State:
It will thus be seen that farms of fifty acres and a total increase of 75,590 acres. The average area
upwards contributed an increase of 63,543 acres out of cultivated by all farmers was 43 acres.

WHEAT-GROWING.
Though about 200,000 acres is, up to 1915, the
maximum area cultivated in Queensland for wheat, this
cereal is destined to become one of the principal products
of the State. Immense areas on the western slopes are
eminently fitted for cereal growing by methods of cultiva-
tion designed to counteract the effects of fluctuations in
the character of the seasons.
Hitherto the wheat-growers of Queensland have
proved less advanced in the methods they have employed
than are those of the southern States, and particularly
those of South Australia and Victoria, where very much
more experience has been gathered in fighting against
spells of dry weather. Yet in spite of inferior cultivation
the wheat farms of Queensland return a higher average
production than do those of any other Australian State,
with the sole exception of Tasmania, where wheat is
grown only on a very limited scale on a small and
specially selected area of land. The latter contention
is demonstrated very clearly by the following return,
extending over a period of ten years:
to be learned both in the northern districts of Victoria
and in South Australia. The last-named State ranks
now among the largest wheat producers in the Common-
wealth. Some fifteen or twenty years earlier the average
returns secured by South Australian farmers ran only
from four to seven bushels per acre. The application of
newer methods, including sufficient cultivation of the
ground and the liberal use of fertilizers, resulted in the
average yield jumping to about eleven bushels to the
acre. Thus, whilst complete immunity from the effects
of severe drought cannot be claimed yet, the farmers in
the south have at least demonstrated that they can
confidently count on having a payable crop in the vast
majority of seasons, under a rainfall certainly not more
copious than is that of Queensland.
Officially it has been calculated, on carefully
collected data, that some 50,000,000 acres of Queensland
are fitted in soil and climate to profitably produce wheat.
The success of the cultivation of this immense area will
depend on landholders making use of knowledge already
available from other States and countries. In Queens-
land land is rarely fallowed before the first crop is put
in, yet southern experience has demonstrated quite
conclusively that the maximum of success cannot be
attained without fallowing, and that the neglect of the
method often leads to the total loss of all the money
and labour devoted to the particular crop involved, under
conditions which would have brought moderate profit had
the soil been properly worked. Fallowing and subse-
quent sufficient cultivation store the moisture within the
soil, checking evaporation. A general neglect of
sufficient and properly designed fertilization has also
characterized Queensland’s efforts at wheat-growing.
The truth of the foregoing facts has been
strikingly demonstrated by the Agricultural Depart-
ment at the Government Experimental Farm at
Roma, 318 miles west of Brisbane. In his official
♦ Ou area reaped and sown.
One reason why a greater area of Queensland has
not been cultivated hitherto for wheat has lain in
occasional total losses of crops from drought. Although
the average yield is higher than the other States, the
risks of loss, as from year to year, have been greater.
Yet these violent differences in the returns result
directly from faulty cultivation. The same lesson had
report of this institution, Mr. R. E. Soutter, the
officer in charge, states: —“Our State is not, as is
erroneously supposed by many people, too dry, owing
to the light average rainfall during the winter months,
for wheat to be extensively cultivated, and it is hoped
that the day is not far distant when such will be generally
recognized, and she will take the place she should in

its production, and produce not only for her internal
requirements but for export as well, in the same manner
as she has done in other directions. In anticipation of
such coming to pass, as well as to facilitate matters in a
country like Queensland, a good deal of experiment and
research work is necessary, more especially in the newer
districts. This has and is still being done, and although
the results achieved and the information gained have not
been made use of by the farmers to the extent their
values warrant, the growing of approved varieties and
demand for good-quality seed is increasing every year,
and instances of the adoption of better systems of land
preparation and the cultivation of growing crops are more
frequently encountered.”
The following table of results from experimental
plots shows the yields actually achieved, together with
the cost of fertilization :
The cost of cultivation of the above crops was as
follows:
The remarkable feature about the foregoing returns
lies in the striking contrast they present to the crops
obtained by farmers in the same region carrying on their
industry under the same climatic conditions. The
average wheat yield obtained in the Roma district, out-
side the Government Farm, was 7'44 bushels to the acre.
The knowledge used bn the experimental station,
together with the expenditure of a few additional
shillings for more thorough cultivation and fertilization,
thus resulted in the production of approximately three
times the quantity of grain obtained under the system
of management most generally followed throughout
Queensland. The higher yield depends on—(1) Suffi-
cient cultivation of the soil, both before and after
planting ; (2) use of the fertilizer needed by the particular
soil being worked; (3) use of a variety of wheat specially
evolved to resist conditions of drought.
Excellent work has been accomplished by the Agri-
cultural Department in breeding varieties of wheat to fit
the peculiarities of local conditions. The work has been
proceeding for a long term of years, and by crossing, as
well as by selection of seed, new types have been raised
with such success that in certain districts, where rust
once proved an ineffective bar to successful cultivation of
grain, the evil has been completely overcome. Excellent
results have also been achieved in establishing varieties
for withstanding other adverse local influences.
MAIZE.
The area under cultivation for maize is not nearly
so large as might be expected, considering the yields
obtained. One reason for this is that in the districts
suitable for the crop the attention of landholders is
almost entirely monopolized by sugar-cane growing.
Some districts, in every way adapted by soil and climatic
conditions for the production of maize, actually import
supplies for their own consumption. Sharp fluctuations
are evident in the area under maize. In 1913 there were
156,775 acres under cultivation for this crop, as against
117,993 acres a year previously. However, in 1910 the
quantity of land growing maize was 180,862 acres. The
decline of this branch of agriculture was not due to a
decreasing price, as the market rates increased as between
1910 and 1913. A more likely cause lies in the want of
care in methods of cultivation, more particularly in the
selection of seed, and the continual cropping of the same
land without rest. This is to some extent borne out by
the fact that in 1913 the average yield in the Atherton
district, where maize-growing was a comparatively new
industry, was 39T4 bushels to the acre, whereas in the
Moreton district, which has been growing the same crop
probably for a longer period than has any other part of
Queensland, the average was only 2T07 bushels.
MINOR CROPS.
A reluctance has been shown up to the present by
agriculturists in the coastal districts to devote much
attention to any branch of tropical agriculture outside


sugar-cane growing. This is explained, no doubt, by
the high cash returns obtained from sugar plantations,
and the great value attaching to land as soon as its
suitability to cultivation for that purpose is established.
The sugar industry is dealt with in a special article
appearing elsewhere in this volume. The Agricultural
Department has conducted a good many experiments
with such crops as coffee and spices, and the results
attained have demonstrated that these forms of farming
might be profitably followed. Within the last two years
quite a number of people have imported cocoanuts for
planting, principally in the northern part of the State
surrounding the Gulf of Carpentaria and on the adjacent
islands. Further south, plantations varying in size have
been laid down at Cape Bedford, the Bloomfield River,
Port Douglas, Ella Bay, Maria Creek, Cardwell, Mouri-
lyan, and Clump Point. There are also thirty-seven
consequently made by the Queensland Government as to
conditions prevailing in Texas, a considerable cotton-
growing State. It was found that in Texas black and
white workers are paid the same wages, but that the
whites are the more efficient, and that three-fourths of
the labour employed is white. Moreover, it was further
ascertained that the number of whites is increasing more
rapidly than the blacks. In dealing with the evidence
obtained from Texas, the annual report for 1914 of the
Queensland Agricultural Department states as follows:
“Small farms are the rule, the day of large planta-
tions having passed into oblivion, and the holder usually
plants most of his arable land with cotton because of
all crops it is the most reliable, from which he can obtain
immediate payment. Dairying and agriculture, with
stock-raising, are there subsidiary issues, instead of, as has
been the case here, the principal products of the farm.
GROUP OF DAIRY CATTLE AT “TAMROOKUM,” BEAUDESERT.
European growers north of Ingham. Some twenty
growers northward from Mackay are cultivating coffee.
Along the north coast varying areas are also devoted to
cotton, tobacco, arrowroot, spices, rubber, and fodder-
crops. The success of these enterprises depends on how
the profits resulting from them compare with those from
sugar - cane farming. The tendency appears to be
towards increasing the variety of tropical agricultural
enterprise.
A good deal of attention has been devoted from
time to time by the Government to the possibility of
successfully growing cotton in Queensland. An
important phase of this question lies in the nature of the
labour likely to be employed on the fields, as neither the
State nor National Legislature will be likely to encourage
any industry depending on blacks or other Asiatics for
carrying on any part of the work. Investigations were
“With this irrefutable evidence from the British
Consul at Galveston, in Texas, that generally cotton-
raising there costs as much as it would do here, and with
the opportunities of a market that cannot be satisfied,
at values that will produce a profit at least equal to that
which can be obtained from a like area under cereals or
maize, it would seem that opportunities are being lost in
this State. The circumstances of the disasters of the
several periods of cotton-growing here cannot be over-
looked as being a dangerous factor in preventing the rise
of enthusiasm again, but greater difficulties have before
this been overcome, and under the existing conditions of
an advance by this Department of l|d. a lb. upon seed
cotton delivered in Brisbane, and with the knowledge
that after sale the balance will be returned to him less
only the actual charges for marketing, it would seem
that the farmer should again give this crop a trial. The


difficulty of picking is also not insuperable, because this
crop can be taken at leisure, not as other staple crops,
which must be harvested and handled as soon as ripe.
“The climatic conditions and soil are also of the best
for this plant, and upon the verdict of Americans
who speak with knowledge of the industry, the possi-
bilities of profitably cultivating cotton, even as a
subsidiary crop, are as great as they are in the United
States. The possibilities of a cotton-picking machine have
been inquired into, and though it appears that such a
machine is within the range of fact, it has not yet come on
to the market in a commercial form. The Agent-General
and the Department of Agriculture of the United States
were good enough to be interested, and to investigate this
matter upon behalf of this Department.
“The result of a conference between the Dominions
Royal Commission and the British Cotton Growers’
Association, so far as this subject is concsrned, was a
recommendation for the services of a cotton expert to
spend at least three years here, making experiments and
giving growers practical instruction. This was in
October last, but nothing definite has yet accrued regard-
ing the appointment of an expert, the last information
available being that the Imperial Institute, which was
entrusted with the selection of the expert, is seeking the
services of a gentleman who was in March last employed
in Nigeria.
“In May last nine bulk samples of cotton, of different
varieties of cotton that had been grown here, were sent
to London for valuation upon a commercial basis. This
was done by a firm of brokers of high standing, upon the
assumption that the bulk would be equal to the sample,
and also for a commercial quantity of not less than a ton
of lint of each kind. The prices varied from B'ood. to
9'ood. a lb. at a time when middling American lint was
valued at 7'2od. a lb. These valuations are proof of
the possibility of cotton being grown in Queensland
upon a profitable basis if the people will take it up.”
IRRIGATION.
Though means of water conservation form the
outstanding need of all primary industry over the larger
part of Queensland, no comprehensive scheme of
indgation has yet been seriously considered by the
Government. In 1914 the total area under irrigation
was only 11,904 acres, which, however, showed an
increase of 2,500 acres on the figures of 1912. Of the
larger total, 8,255 acres were in the Ayr, Bowen, and
Bundaberg districts. There were also 496 artificially
watered acres at Cunnamulla and 250 aeres at Hunger-
ford.
It may thus be seen that, so far as irrigation has
been adopted at all, it has been applied to districts
where the rainfall is already relatively heavy. That the
enterprise has proved profitable is demonstrated by the
extension of the area treated. Where the intense
culture of fodder crops is so much needed as the means of
providing security against drought practically nothing
has yet been done in the required direction. The great
obstacle has lain in the heavy cost which would be
entailed in damming the rivers in order to get the
required water storage.
Tropical Industries.
That Queensland possesses an immense source of
scarcely tapped wealth in her adaptability to a wide
range of tropical primary industries is fully recognized
by experts with special knowledge of those matters, and
who have made a study of her differing, soils and
climates. With a well-watered coastline extending
from the twentieth to the eleventh degrees of latitude,
considerable differences of mean temperatures are found
to grade off from her southern boundary to Cape York,
whilst for the few crops which may flourish best in a
dry atmosphere her western slopes offer conditions which,
in the far interior, merge into the desert, and which,
with varying latitudes and altitudes up to 3,000 feet,
offer an abundance of differences in natural environment.
Many important and promising tropical industries
have never been experimented with in Queensland.
With a sparse population and excellent returns from
the industries already established on an immense
territory, the landholders and the Government have
been kept busy in developing what has already proved
to be successful. That the Commonwealth has been
importing commodities which might have been produced
profitably in Queensland denotes no lack of enterprise
on the part of Queenslanders. Had energies been
diverted into new channels, it must have been at the
expense of industries already established, and a lessened
production of sugar, bananas, meat, or some other
Queensland prodiict would have resulted. But the war
has greatly altered the outlook of commercial and
industrial matters. Australia of the future certainly
will seek to be as self-contained as is practical, and, even
though she may have to pay something for it, the nation
will endeavour to feed herself to the fullest extent
possible. Certainly it is to the great State in the north-
eastern section of the continent to which all eyes will
be turned for the output of those raw products, the
growth of which depends on rich soil and a tropical or
sub-tropical sun, with varying degrees of rainfall. With
an average annual downpour of some 150 inches at
Geraldton, shading off to vanishing point in the far west,


Queensland possesses. l the latter characteristic, whilst
her coastal lands, consisting so largely of deep volcanic
soils and rich alluvial flats, possess a fertility surpassed
in no part of the Commonwealth. Her western lands
also contain enormous tracts which are intensely prolific
when sufficient moisture reaches their surface.
Already Queensland has shown how splendidly
adapted she is for yielding a high production of a
tropical crop in the success of her sugar industry. This
aspect of the subject is specially dealt with in a portion
of this work. Some eight per cent, of the Commonwealth
consumption is met from the north-eastern State, and
through what has been done there the nation throughout
the war was enabled to purchase the commodity at
below the world’s parity, and thus escape the evils
resulting from the famine which resulted from huge
quantities of best being shut up in Germany and
Austria. That the whole of the nation’s needs have
not been met internally has arisen from causes which
have had nothing to do with the limits of Queensland’s
resources. The latter are not even yet known.
Without going into the question of industries about
which no local knowledge has been made available by
means of experimenting, it is interesting to note what
has been done in certain other tropical industries, some
of which have not yet been adopted on a scale sufficiently
large to place them on the footing of immediate national
importance, but others which have come to rank as
important assets to the State and the Commonwealth.
Among these are bananas, rice, arrowroot, ginger,
cotton, tobacco, dates, and vanilla.
Bananas have been grown successfully in Queens-
land from the earliest days of free settlement. The
first plantations were in the neighbourhood of Brisbane,
but the cultivation of the fruit extended gradually
northward, following in the wake of the pioneering
landholder. The tropical northern coastal lands soon
became the principal district for the production of this
product, and the industry was engaged in mainly by
Chinamen. But the tree rarely lasted more than six
years, and they found it more profitable to move on to
new land than to fertilize the old. Consequently, the
supply of suitable country adjacent to means of trans-
port rapidly gave out. This synchonised with a shortage
in the output from the Pacific Islands, with the result
that a sharp rise in price took place. This proved perhaps
the most fortunate circumstance which could have
occurred, because white landholders were thereby induced
to increase the area devoted in the south to banana
cultivation. The banana, being a heavy feeder, requires
much manuring, but of late years it has been found
that successful plantations may be established on quite
poor soil if the manuring is heavy enough from the-
start. The plant, however, thrives best in a site near
the sea, as it requires a certain amount of salt from the
saline air. Most of the bananas consumed in Australia
are grown in Queensland, and the trade is of large
importance to the State and highly profitable to those
with the requisite knowledge who are engaged in it.
Queensland contains plenty of land suitable to
tobacco-growing. For example, considerable areas lie
in the Texas and Inglewood districts. The industry has
proved profitable, but as yet is in but its first stages of
development; the annual production being within the
neighbourhood of 500,000 lbs., whereas at present there
is in Australia a demand for 2,500,000 lbs. of Queens-
land pipe tobacco, which might easily be increased to
5,500,000 lbs., according to the authority of Mr. R. S.
Nevill, Instructor in Tobacco Culture to the Queensland
Government. Like most industries which have not long
been applied in any particular country, tobacco culture
in Australia has not been made as profitable as otherwise
it might have been, but in the United States growers
have found the manufacture of leaf pay them at 3ld.
per lb. However, the fact that the Queensland output
has been increasing for some years up to the outbreak
of war—conditions after then probably being abnormal
and not forming a fair basis to judge by- —served to
demonstrate that even with systems of management
which stand in need of some alteration and development
good results have been attained.
Over fifty years ago the arrowroot industry was
established by the late Mr. George Grimes at Oxley
Creek, where he erected a plant for manufacturing
arrowroot on a commercial scale. Before then Major
Boyd, now editor of the Queensland Agricultural
Journal, had been growing the same crop, and was
manufacturing the product with the most primitive
appliances. The latter gentleman then concentrated
his attentions on producing the raw material and supply-
ing it to the mill of Mr. Grimes. The bulbs were sold
at £2 10s. per ton, and on the rich virgin scrub lands
between the Oxley Creek and Rocklea the yield was
enormous. In the Beenleigh district, south of Brisbane,
no fewer than five mills are now fully occupied in
dealing with the raw product coming forward from a
few miles of surrounding country. Queensland has
sufficient land suitable to the purpose to enable her to
supply the whole of the needs of the Commonwealth.
A remarkable point about the sale of Queensland, or
“Australian arrowroot,” as it is called in England, is
that it cannot be sold in Great Britain without some
qualifying term attached such as “Queensland” or
“Australian arrowroot.” How this has come about is
rather interesting. When the Drugs and Food Act was
passed by the Imperial Parliament it was specified
that “Arrowroot is the product of the plant Maranta
arundinacea.” That is what Bermuda and Mauritius
arrowroots are made from. Manufactured arrowroot
from the Ganna edulis was then practically unknown


in Great Britain. Practically there is no difference
betwen the two. It lias actually been stated that
Queensland arrowroot is an adulterant! Whereas it is
generally conceded that, so far from that, it is preferable
as a food to the Bermuda product. The purple variety,
whch is, as said, exclusively cultivated in Queensland,
grows to a great height, often rising to eight feet or
nine feet. It has very large, broad, ribbed leaves; and
as many as fifteen to twenty stalks rise from a single
stool, each stalk representing a large bulb. In the
flowering season the plant sends up a long, straight
spike, from the head of which bursts a beautiful bunch
of bright scarlet flowers, having the appearance of those
of the common canna, known as ‘‘lndian shot,” but far
larger. The seeds do not often mature, however, as
do those of the canna family generally. The bulbs
from which the arrowroot of commerce is prepared form
a compact mass on and near the surface of the soil,
and so prolific is the plant that from a single stool as
much as sixty lbs. and even eighty lbs. weight of bulbs
lias been dug.
The must extensive rice-growing centre in Queens-
land is on the Logan River, near Beenleigh, to which
locality the crop was introduced in 1869 by Major Boyd.
Previously to that the Chinese had grown ric'e on rather
an extended scale on the northern rivers, whilst the
State botanist, Mr. F. M. Bailey, has described a species
of wild rice growing in the swampy lands on the latter
region as being indigenous to the State. The seed
obtained by Major Boyd was of one of tlie Japanese
varieties. Other landholders in the same district took
the enterprise up, but, through lack of change of seed,
the quality quickly deteriorated, and the crops came to
be consumed only as fodder, the seed saved being used
only for planting subsequent crops with. On these some-
what wasteful lines the industry was carried on for a
good many years. But valuable experience was being
gained. In the light of local knowledge, Mr. Fred. Wm.
Peek, of Logaholme, arrived at the conclusion early in
the century that rice would prove highly remunerative
in southern Queensland. The facts used in the follow-
ing calculations are taken from what that gentleman
learned from direct observation in that locality: —ln
ordinary situations, with only a fair cultivation, from
thirty to forty bushels of sixty lb. of paddy can be
obtained per acre, which is double the wheat yield, the
average crop of wheat being from fifteen to twenty
bushels per acre. In some instances these quantities
have been exceeded in both crops, but a fair average is
given for comparison. The value of wheat per bushel
ranges from 3s. to 3s. 6d., whilst the value of rice sold
to the local mill averages from 4s. to ss. per bushel
delivered at the mills. Then dry rice chaff is of great
value as a feed for stock and horses, and if placed on
the market and once fairly tested it would probably
command a ready sale. The straw is less hard, and
when well dried compares favourably with oaten straw,
and a fairly low estimate would give (according to the
variety growm) from three to four tons per acre, of an
estimated value of <£2 to £3 per ton, or an average to
the grower per acre of straw and grain of £ls 10s. per
six months’ crop. Of course, in favoured districts two
crops can be obtained in the year —that is where frosts
do not appear. Then the above figures would have to
be doubled as a yearly income, but in the Logan district
only one crop of rice is taken, to be followed by a late
crop of some other kind, such as oats, etc. Of course,
the greatest benefit is derived by the grower on a large
scale if he does his own milling. A glance at the prices
paid for paddy and the prices now obtainable for the
finished product will be worth consideration. Take the
price of rice, duty paid, for best Japan at £24 jjer ton.
The commonest quality of imported rice, “Rangoon,”
will fetch, duty paid, £l9. This price gives a fair
margin of profit to the local miller if he sells at £lB
per ton. The samples milled at the Pimpama Island
Mill are of a very high grade, and closely resemble
“Patna” in shape of grain, but slightly darker in colour.
Taking, then, the local rice at £lB per ton market value,
to produce which one ton ten hundredweight of paddy
would be required (according to records taken at recent
trials) to be milled, of a value of £l2 9s. 9d.; this would
leave a margin of £5 10s. 3d. Paddy rice is bought
locally like wheat at 2,240 lb. per ton, deducting the
cost of milling, the average of about £2 per ton leaves
the miller a net profit of £3 10s. 3d. per ton. To this
must be added the value of the pollard, which also is
of great use as feed for calves, pigs, or poultry when
steamed and then mixed with separator milk. Its
commercial value is certainly not less than £2 to £3
per ton.
The history of coffee-growing in Queensland is a
story of ups and downs. Perhaps this is not remarkable
when an industry is being started for the first time.
But other factors entered into the matter besides the
inexperience of growers. During the nineties there was
what might be called a boom in coffee in Northern Queens-
land. Unfortunately, after people had been looking
very favourably on the industry and had planted a good
deal of land, prices materially fell as a result of over-
production in Brazil. Raw coffee in Queensland fell
to 4Jd. per lb., though by 1912 it had risen again to
71 d. This sudden depression in the market, coupled
with technical mistakes in production such as are
inseparable from pioneering a new industry, led to
some plantations being abandoned and general disap-
pointment among those who had engaged upon the
enterprise. The main points of difference between coffee
culture as a business proposition twenty years ago and
now are—lncreased settlement of the country; greater


facilities of transport; improvement of prices; a spirit
of more open-mindedness, though perhaps of greater
caution (and therefore, more business-like and sound),
towards the subject; and a fuller knowledge of the
requirements of the staple in this country
obtained from the experience of earlier
growers. Plantations which successfully
survived the period of depression and are
now sources of profit to their owners are
situated at Mount Buderin, Mackay, Ather-
ton, and Kuranda, many of them yielding
returns of from eight to ten hundred-weight
per acre in specially good seasons. Reference
to the agricultural statistics as appearing in
a report of a few years ago of the Depart-
ment of Agriculture and Stock will show
that the average returns for the two dis-
tricts of Mackay and Herberton were 2,304
lb. and 1,046 lb. respectively per acre;
and everyone knows that a district average
must include at least a percentage of
indifferently worked as well as the properly
worked plantations. Unfortunately for the
country, very little is heard of these suc-
cessful plantations—not half as much as
of the failures. Most of these growers are maim-
turing their own coffee, and find a ready local
sale for it, and that within a radius of a few
miles only. Their product, therefore, is seldom
shipped south to the big markets of the Commonwealth
GRANADILLA PASSION VINE, KURANDA, NORTHERN QUEENSLAND.
—often not shipped at all, and, while there is an absolute
consumption of every iota produced, the amount is
insufficient to materially affect the market. Hence
Melbourne and Sydney and the south generally know
cc
little and hear less of what coffee is being produced.
According to Mr. H. Newport, the Government
Instructor in Tropical Agriculture, coffee may be grown
in the coastal districts of the whole of Queensland

north of the tropic of Capricorn, and in a few
isolated and well-sheltered places even to the south of
Brisbane. The returns from a properly opened and
cultivated estate of say ten acres will be about two tons
in the third year, about three and a half in the fourth,
and ten hundredweight per acre, or five
tons, from the fifth year on. A larger
return is quite possible in a favourable
season, or with good and careful cultiva-
tion ; the highest returns per acre obtained
lately being nearly three times as much,
and fifteen to sixteen hundredweight per
acre not infrequent under such conditions.
The values vary according to quality, but
should not average less than 6d. per lb.
in the parchment (£56 per ton), or 7|d.
per lb. cleaned and hulled (£7O per ton).
Good qualities may reach 10d., or even
Is. per lb. The returns from a ten-acre
estate from the fifth year may, therefore,
be taken as worth about £350 (cleaned or
hulled), of which from £l5O to £2OO should
be net profit. Although coffee yields no return
until the third year, the plants will con-
tinue to yield during the whole of a
man’s life-time. Whilst the labour diffi-
culty may make the industry unsuitable to the
capitalist in a large way of business, there is
nothing to prevent the small farmer carrying out
the whole of the work with his own family, if he

should happen to have children who have passed
the school age.
Very few dates are produced in Australia, but
there are some grown in the dry western country of
Queensland and on the Main Range of as good quality
as any turned out from any part of the world. The
date palm requires a high temperature, dry atmosphere,
and a plentiful supply of water. The Queensland Agri-
cultural Journal asks: “Why we should import dates
when we can so easily grow them is among the many
things one cannot understand. We might just as well
cease growing pineapples, oranges, and mangoes, and
import them from other countries.” The crop might be
made very profitable, and in the few places where it has
been attempted excellent results have been attained.
That cotton-growing may be made to pay in
Queensland under modern conditions has been amply
demonstrated by the results actually achieved. In the
early days of the State’s independent existence a good
deal of capital was lost in a somewhat comprehensive
effort to establish the industry, again demonstrating the
old truism that an industry should he pioneered on a
small scale, and that considerable expansion should be
postponed until experiment has demonstrated the best
methods to employ and the results likely to accrue. The
initial set-back naturally caused many people to regard
the enterprise with feelings of some timidity. But
this is gradually wearing away. The following par-
ticulars are of some yields obtained during 1907 under
practical farming conditions. Similar returns were
secured in 1915 —a drought year but on a limited
What would appear to be the most reliable calcu-
lations set down the cost of cultivating an acre with
cotton seed and of picking and marketing the crop at
£3 6s. 4d. Cotton does not require anything like the
richest of soils, but it needs certain soil characteristics 1 .
The most suitable portion of Queensland for the
industry, so far as existing experience shows, is that of
West Moreton.
Vanilla is recorded as having been grown in the
Brisbane Botanic Gardens and at Bowen Park as early
as 1866, and it was distributed to northern localities at
several subsequent dates, but no commercial results
accrued. Few parts of the world are suitable to the
somewhat high-priced product yielded by this plant, but
the Government Experimental and Demonstration plots
at Cairns have shown that the plant, wdiich is an orchid,
will thrive better under the conditions in Northern
Queensland than in almost any part of the earth. In this
connection Mr. H. N. Ridley, in Spices, page 31,
points out that Queensland evidently has special
advantages in the nature of its scrub lands for vanilla.
“In the ordinary tropical forest the trees are of all
sizes and so irregular in growth that it would be very
troublesome to clear the undergrowth so that the trees
could be connected by trellises or poles in a convenient
way. So readily adapted a woodland as the Australian
bush appears to be is rarely found.” ihe profit per acre
form vanilla is quoted in the Seychelles as £2oo, and
in Tahiti at some £l2O. So far as Australia is con-
cerned, everything has to be learned about the industry
beyond the fact of what the Government has ascertained
at Cairns, and which would make the possible profits
appear almost incredibly large.
Pineapples form what up to the present is the most
popular and profitable crop for the “small man
to grow. The yields are attained comparatively early,
and very heavy peracreage receipts are earned. The
Australian market is supplied mostly from Queensland.
Ginger will grow to perfection in any fit soil
on all the suitable lands of the coastal districts of
Queensland, and the commodity is in universal demand.
The two essential requirements are sunlight and
moisture; but there is no more difficulty in growing
ginger than in growing arrowroot, peanuts, castor oil,
or sunflower. The process of planting differs! little from
potato planting. The highest quantity is obtained on
deep, rich, black scrub or virgin forest soil. It can be
grown year after year on the same ground, and when
the soil becomes too poor to grow “white ginger,” an
inferior variety—the blue —will yield good crops.
Planted in October it is ready for digging in July or
August. An average yield can be estimated at from
1.000 to 1,500 lb. of dried ginger to the acre, whilst
2.000 lb, have often been secured. Prices for ginger
vary. As much as £lO per cwt. is often paid in the
London market for the very highest class of white
ginger, but the usual market price to-day averages all
round from £2 2s. to £3 10s. per cwt. for Jamaica
ginger, the same for Cochin, and 18s. to 18s. 6d. per
cwt. for Japanese.


There is a good opening for intending fruitgrowers
in Queensland. The industry has long been thoroughly
established, and there are continually recurring inquiries
as to the best places to start horticulture with a reason-
able prospect of success. It is not only the increased
demand for fruit that causes these inquiries; for fruit-
growing has a strong attraction for many would-be
agriculturists as compared with general farming,
dairying, or stockraising.
Queensland embraces from the 11th to the 29th
degrees of south latitude, and it extends from a humid
eastern seaboard to an extremely dry interior, some
fifteen degrees of longitude west. It is, therefore—of
many climates and varied rainfall—a country possessing
a great diversity
of soils, many of
which are of sur-
prising richness.
It is more or less
heavily timbered
with either scrub
or forest growth,
or consisting of
wide, open plains
that are practic-
ally treeless; and
it is of many
resources. It is
capable of pro-
ducing within its
own borders all
that man re-
quires, from the
extreme tropical
to temperate pro-
ducts. Queens-
land, once its
possibilities are realized and turned to profitable account,
is destined to become one of the most fruitful countries
in the globe, well able to support a large and thriving
white population. The State is possessed of what from
a fruitgrower’s point of view is an excellent climate,
not by any means so extreme as is often represented.
Great cold is unknown, frost being unusual on any
portion of the seaboard, but common during the winter
months on the tablelands. But even where there are
frosts the days are pleasantly warm. Summer is
undoubtedly warm, but it is usually a bearable heat,
and sudden changes are extremely rare, so that though
trying in the humid tropical seaboard, it is not of the
most severe type, and compares favourably with the
tropical heat met with elsewhere- This is clearly shown

by the stamina of the white race, particularly those
living in the country districts, where both men and
women compare favourably with thQse of any other part
of the Empire.
Queensland offers exceptional advantages to the
intending fruitgrowers, and the following may be
quoted as examples: All kinds of tree life are rapid
in growth, and fruit trees come into bearing much
sooner than they do in colder climates. In addition
to their arriving at early maturity, they are also as a
rule heavy bearers; their fault, if anything, being
towards over-bearing. Fruits of many kinds are so
thoroughly acclimatized that it is by no means
uncommon to find them growing wild and holding
their own in the
midst of rank
indigenous vege-
tation without
receiving the
slightest care or
attention. In
some cases, where
cultivated fruits
have been
allowed to be
come wild, they
have become
somewhat of a
pest, and have
kept down all
other growths; so
much so that it
has been actually
necessary to take
steps to prevent
them from be-
coming a great
nuisance, so readily do they grow and so rapidly do
they increase.
The very ease with which fruit can be grown, when
planted under conditions of soil and climate favourable
to its development, has had a tendency to make growers
somewhat careless as compared with those of other
countries, who have to carry on their industry under
circumstances demanding a thorough attention in
order to be made profitable. Latterly, however, there
has been a considerable improvement in the working of
Queensland orchards, growers finding that it does not
pay to produce second-quality fruit, and therefore they
are giving much more attention to the selection of
varieties, cultivation of the land, pruning the trees, and
keeping fruit pests in check. This improvement in care


and management is resulting in a corresponding
improvement in the quantity and quality of output, so
that now commercial fruits—that is to say, the fruits
grown in commercial quantities—compare favourably
with the best types of similar fruits produced
elsewhere.
Queensland has practically an unlimited area of
land suitable for fruit culture, much of which is at
present in its virgin state, and is obtainable on easy
terms and at a low rate. Government land is valued on
an average at £1 per acre, and privately-owned land
suitable for fruitgrowing can be purchased at from 10s.
to £5 per acre, according to its quality and its distance
from railway or water carriage. This State has plenty
of land, but what it lacks is population to work it.
The Government of Queensland, through its Depart-
ment of Agriculture, is always ready to give full
information to intending settlers, to assist them in their
selection of suitable laud, to advise them as to the
kinds of fruit to plant, to give practical advice in the
cultivation, pruning, manuring, and general manage-
ment of the orchard, as well as in the disposal or
utilization of the fruit when grown; in short, to help the
beginner to start on the right lines, so that he may be
successful.
There is also little, if any, fear of over-extending
the fruitgrowing industry, as if proceeding on right
lines and on sound business principles Queensland can
raise fruit of the highest quality at a price that will
enable her to compete in the markets of the world,
especially now that there is direct and rapid communi-
cation at frequent intervals with Canada, the United
States of America, the East (Japan, Manilla, etc.),
Europe, and the United Kingdom.
Unlike the colder parts of the world or the extreme
tropics, Queensland is not confined to the growing of
particular varieties of fruits, but owing to the great
extent of country and its geographical distribution she
is able to produce practically all the cultivated kinds
of the woi’ld, and many of them to great perfection.
There are, however, one or two tropical fruits that are
exceptions, such as the durien and mangosteen (whose
range is extremely small), and one or two of the berry
fruits of cold countries, which require a colder winter
than that experienced in any part of north-eastern
Australia. It will, however, be seen at once that a
country that can produce such fruits as the following
offers a very wide choice indeed to the pros-
pective grower, viz. : —The mango, pineapple, banana,
papaw, granadilla, guava, custard apple, litchi, soursop,
coconut, bread fruit, jack fruit, monstera, alligator
pear, and others of a purely tropical character; the
date, citrus fruits of all kinds, passion fruit, persimmon,
olive, pecannut, cape gooseberry, loquat, and other fruits
of a semi-tropical character; as well as the fruits of
the more temperate regions, such as the apple, pear,
plum, peach, apricot, quince, almond, cherry, fig,
walnut, strawberry, mulberry, and others of minor
importance, in addition to grapes of all kinds, both for
wine and table and of both European and American
origin.
The eastern seaboard, extending from the New
South Wales border in the south (a few miles to the
south of the 28th degree of south latitude) to Cape York
(some twenty miles north of the 11th degree of south
latitude), contains the best districts for the growth of
tropical and semi-tropical fruits. The coastal climate,
however, varies considerably, and is governed by the
proximity or otherwise of the coast ranges. When the
latter approach the coast there is always more rainfall,
and as they recede the rainfall decreases. With one or
two exceptions, where the coastal range is a considerable
distance inland, the eastern coastal districts have a
sufficient rainfall for the successful culture of most
fruits, though they are subject to a dry spell during
winter and spring. As summer approaches thunder-
storms become prevalent, and are accompanied by more
or less humid conditions, which though good for fruit
development, are not quite so enjoyable as the drier
months. Summer is the wet season, and the rainfalls
are occassionally very heavy. The weather is warm and
oppressive, particularly in the more tropical districts;
but these very conditions are those that are best suited
to the production of tropical fruits.
Practically all the coastal district has a sufficient
rainfall for the growth of all fruits suitable to the
climate, though there are occasionally dry spells during
the spring, when a judicious watering would be a great
advantage. This does not imply a regular system of
irrigation, but simply the conserving of surplus moisture
in times of plenty by means of dams across small natural
watercourses or gullies, by tanks where such do not
occur, or from wells where an available supply of under-
ground water may be obtained. The water so conserved
would be needed only occasionally, but it would be an
insurance against any possible loss or damage that might
accrue to the trees during a dry spell of extra length.
So far little has been done in coastal districts in con-
serving water for fruitgrowing, the natural rainfall
being considered by many to be ample; but in the
opinion of experts irrigation would be found to represent
a good investment, as it would be the means of securing
regular crops instead of an occasional partial failure,
due to lack of sufficient moisture during a critical period


of the tree’s growth. Were rainfall evenly distributed
throughout the year, it would be ample for all require-
ments. Unfortunately, however, it is not evenly
distributed, the heavy falls taking place during the
summer months. The rainfall shows that there is no
fear of a shortage of water at any time. The only need
is to conserve the surplus for use during a prolonged
dry spell.
The conditions are extremely favourable for the
glowth of all tropical and semi-tropical fruits, as during
the period of greater
heat, when these fruits
make their greatest call
for moisture, there is
an abundance of rain,
and during the other por-
tions of the year, when
the call is not so heavy,
it is usually an inexpen-
sive matter to obtain
a sufficient supply to
keep the trees in the
best of order.
Throughout the
southern half of this
seaboard frosts are not
unknown on low-lying
ground, but are ex-
tremely rare on the actual
coast, or at an elevation
of 300 to 400 feet above
the sea, so much so that
no precautions are neces-
sary to prevent damage
from this cause. In the
more tropical north frosts
are unknown on the coast,
and there is no danger
to even the most delicate
plants from the cold.
Running parallel with
the coast, Queensland has
a series of ranges of low
mountains, running from
2,000 feet to nearly 6,000 feet, the general height being
from 2,000 to 3,000 feet. At the back of these ranges
are tablelands, sloping generally to the west. On and
adjacent to these ranges in the southern part of the
State there are fairly sharp frosts in winter, but the
days are warm and bright. This is the district best
adapted for the growth of deciduous fruits and vines,
table varieties doing particularly well. It is a district
well adapted for mixed farming and dairying as well
as fruitgrowing. The climate is even and healthy, and is
neither severe in summer nor winter. The average
rainfall is some 30 inches, and is usually sufficient,
though there are dry periods, when a judicious watering,
as recommended for the coastal districts, would be of
great value to fruit and vegetable growers.
The more northern end of this tableland country
has a much better rainfall —some forty inches per
annum —and frosts, though they occur at times, are not
common. Here there are no extremes of heat and cold,
and lying as it does inland from the most trying
portion of the trojDical
seaboard, it forms a
natural sanatorium.
In the district, fur-
ther west the rainfall
decreases; the summers
are hot with a dry
heat, as distinct from
the more humid heat of
the coast. There are
frequent frosts in winter,
particularly in the
southern part of the
State. Fruitgrowing is
only carried on to a
slight extent at present,
and then only with the
help of water, but when
the latter is obtainable
very good results are
secured. Grapes do well,
both wine and table, and
for raisin-making. Citrus
fruits are remarkably
fine, the lemons especi-
ally being the best grown
in the State. The trees
are less liable to the
attack of many pests,
the dryness of the air
retarding their develop-
ment, if not altogether
preventing their occur-
rence. The date palm
is quite at home here, and when planted in deep
sandy land, and supplied with sufficient water, is a
rapid grower and heavy bearer. As an offset to the
smallness of the rainfall there is a good supply of
artesian water, distributed over a wide range of
country, that can be obtained at a reasonable rate, and
suitable for irrigation purposes. All the water is not so
suitable, however, as some of it is too highly mineralized,
but there are large areas of country possessing an
artesian supply of excellent quality for this purpose.
CLUSTER OF MANDARIN ORANGES.


It will thus be seen that Queensland has roughly
three distinct belts of fruitgrowing country:
(1) The eastern seaboard, and the land adjacent
to it, suitable for the growing of tropical
and semi-tropical fruit.
(2) The coastal tablelands, suitable for the
growth of deciduous fruits, vines, olives, and
citrus fruits in parts.
(3) The central tablelands, suitable for the
growth of grapes for table and drying, dates,
citrus fruits, etc., but requiring water for
irrigation to produce profitably.
These may be described as follows :
Soils of Eastern Seaboard.
Several distinct types of soil are found that are
well adapted to fruitgrowing, but they all have one
general characteristic which is a sine qua non of success,
viz., they must possess good natural drainage, so that
there is no danger of their becoming water-logged or
soured during periods of continued or heavy rainfall,
as these conditions are fatal to fruit-culture under
tropical and semi-tropical conditions.
Of such soils the first to be considered are those of
basaltic origin. They are usually of a chocolate or rich
red colour, are of great depth, and in parts more or
less covered with basaltic boulders, in others entirely
free from stones. The surface soil is friable.and easily
worked, and the subsoil, which is usually of a rich red
colour, is easily penetrated by the roots of trees and
jfiants grown thereon. Occasionally the subsoil is more
compact, in which case it is not so good for fruit-tree
growth, but is better adapted for that of sugarcane,
corn, grass, etc. These basaltic soils are usually rich,
and are covered in their virgin condition with what is
termed scrub—a dense mass of vegetation closely
resembling an Indian jungle. The scrub growth is
totally distinct from forest growth, in that the bulk of
the timber growing in it, much of which is of large size,
is of a soft nature, and once cut down soon rots away.
Imagine a dense wall of vegetation, consisting of large
trees running up to 100 or 150 feet in height, with
trunks ranging from two to eight feet, and even more,
in diameter, and between these trunks an impenetrable
mass of smaller growths, all of the most vivid green
colour, together with innumerable vines and creepers
that are suspended from the branches of the trees
(hanging in festoons) or creeping up palms and bamboos,
ferns and orchids of many kinds (both on the ground
and growing on the tree trunks), as well as many
beautiful foliage plants only found in hothouses in
England, and you will have a faint idea of what a
virgin scrub in coastal Queensland is like. Much of the
timber of the coastal scrub is of considerable commercial
value for building purposes and furniture-making, and
is, or should be, so utilized prior to felling and burning
off. True scrub lands are not by any means the most
difficult to clear, though to a “new chum” the work
will appear at first of a Herculean character. Brushing
the dense undergrowth and then felling the timber
costs from £\ 10s. to £2 per acre, according to
density, size of timber, and proportion of hardwood trees
contained in it, and once this is done the fallen mass
is allowed to become thoroughly dry, when it is burnt
off. A good fire is half the battle, as the subsequent
work of burning off the heavy timber left from the first
conflagration is comparatively light. No stumps are
taken out, as the bulk is found to rot out in a few years,
and its presence in the soil is no detriment to the planting
of such crops as bananas, or even citrus fruit trees.
No special reparation of the land, such as breaking up,
is necessary prior to planting. Holes are dug, trees
or bananas put in, and the whole cultivation for
the first few years consists in keeping down weed
growths with the chipping hoe. Once the stumps have
rotted out the plough and other implements of culture
take the place of the hoe. These soils are especially
adapted for the growth of oranges, limes, mandarins,
mangoes, bananas, pineapples, papaws, custard apples,
strawberries, and cape gooseberries in the south; in
fact, for nearly every kind of tropical and semi-tropical
fruit. Some basaltic soils are occasionally covered with
forest in the place of scrub, or a mixture, part scrub
and part forest. Forest country, as distinct from
scrub, is open-timbered land, with little under-
growth, and no vines or other creepers. The timbers
are also, as a rule, very hard, and the stumps will not
rot out. Such land, when at all heavily timbered, is
much harder to clear and get ready for fruitgrowing
than true scrub, as all timber must be felled and burnt
off, and all stumps and roots taken out, so that the
land can be thoroughly broken up and brought into a
good state of tilth prior to planting. These soils are
suitable to the growth of similar fruits to the true
scrubs, but as a rule they are not so rich.
The second class of soils suitable to fruitgrowing is
of alluvial origin, and is of a sandy, loamy nature,
of fair depth. It is usually met with along creeks
and rivers, or in the deltas in their neighbourhood, but
the growth is seldom so strong as on the red volcanic
soils. Heavy alluvial soils are not suitable for fruit-
culture, and are much more valuable for the growth of
farm crops, but the light sandy loams and free loams
of medium character suit all kinds of fruit to perfection.
These soils usually are easy to work. They retain
moisture well when properly worked, and frequently
are capable of being irrigated, whether from adjacent
creeks or rivers, or by water from wells. This
country is amongst the best for citrus fruits, and
438
HISTORY OF QUEENSLAND : ITS PEOPLE AND INDUSTRIES.


is well adapted for the growth of pineapples and
bananas, as well as of most other tropical fruits, when
free from frosts.
The third class of soils are free sandy loams, either
scrub or forest. They are of various colours, and range
in texture from light sandy loams to medium loams;
they possess excellent drainage, and though when
covered with forest are not naturally rich, yet make
excellent fruit soils and respond rapidly to systematic
cultivation and manuring. They are usually of sand-
stone or granitic origin, and grow good crops for the
first few years, when they become more or less exhausted
in one or more available plant foods, and require
manuring. These soils, like the sandy alluvial loams,
are easy to work, retain moisture well when kept
in a state of perfect tilth, and respond readily to
manuring. They will grow all kinds of fruits when
free from frost.
There are other soils on which fruit can be grown,
but those mentioned represent the most suitable. The
country in which these soils occur is often much broken,
particularly in rich scrub country; it is fairly level
when of alluvial origin, and more or less rolling, as a
rule, when of a sandy, loamy nature. High, ridgy, free,
loamy country is usually the most free from frost and
alluvial flats the most liable to it.
Soils of the Coastal Tablelands.
Starting from the southern part of the State,
adjoining the New South Wales border, the fruit soils
are all of granitic origin. The country is much broken,
but between the ridges and along the creek flats there
is a considerable area possessing soils varying from a
coarse granitic. They change considerably in quality, but
are, as a rule, easy to work, and retain moisture well.
They are covered with open forest, and are particularly
adapted to growth, but not to the same excellence as
the others mentioned.
Proceeding north, the fruit soils are either sandy
loams or loams of a brownish colour of volcanic origin.
The former are suitable for almonds and wine grapes,
and the latter for peaches, apricots, pears, apples, and
especially olives.
Further north a few of the fruits may be grown
on loamy soils, together with citrus fruits, but com-
mercially deciduous fruits are confined to the southern
end of this district, the winter temperature being too
high for their successful growth further north, as the
trees get no winter rest, hence do not mature their fruit-
bearing wood properly.
Soils of the Central Tablelands.
At the southern end of the State the fruit soils are
all of a sandy nature. No other class of land is used to
any extent, as sandy soil alone will retain sufficient
moisture for the growth of grapes and fruit trees during
dry spells, and even then only when kept well and
deeply worked. Further north, where suitable artesian
water is available, the best fruit soils are also free loams
of a sandy nature, either alluvial or open forest soils,
but deep, and possessing perfect drainage, as irrigation
on land without good natural drainage is fatal to fruit
culture. These sandy loams are also easy to work.
Though by no means rich, they, on account of their
depth, grow good crops of fruit by means of irrigation,
and the fruit, such as dates, oranges, lemons, and
grapes, is of very fine quality. The fruit soils of this
district are covered either with open forest —the trees
being of comparatively small size—or with a scrubby
undergrowth, through which a few larger trees are
scattered. Nearly all the timber of this district is
extremely hard, is more or less stunted, and burns
readily. Hence clearing is not a very expensive item.

HISTORY OF QUEENSLAND ; ITS PEOPLE AND INDUSTRIES.


Ipswich and Vicinity.
IPSWICH.
The city of Ipswich is full of historic and industrial
interest. Lying about twenty-four miles by rail from
Brisbane, this centre of pioneer settlement held early
claims to be constituted the capital of the embryo
colony, and at one time it certainly formed the com-
mercial centre of the infant pastoral industry. Indeed,
in an official minute written at the time of his visit
to Queensland, in 1842, Governor Gipps advised that
Ipswich should be the capital, but other counsels pre-
vailed, and the centre of administration was fixed at
Biisbane. At that time the railway from Grand-
chester terminated at Ipswich, and until the middle
seventies, when the line was extended to Brisbane, wool
and other produce were brought down by river, whilst
stores were transported to the same point in like
manner.
To-day Ipswich ranks as a thriving inland city of
great natural attractiveness and rare industrial possi-
bilities. Abundance of both water and coal, coupled
with extensive areas of first-class agricultural land,
formed sufficient inducement to lead to the establish-
ment of a town which to-day has a population of about
10,000 inhabitants within the civic borders, which
until recent times did not exceed four square miles,
whilst outside this area there dwells a considerable
suburban and farming population. In the year 1917
the rateable property within the city boundary was
valued officially at <£400,000.
Lying on the Bremer River, a tributary of the
Brisbane, Ipswich is delightfully situated, the surround-
ing hills, with their wooded slopes, dotted here and
there by village and farm, dipping into innumerable
valleys, which finally are lost to view in the distant
haze, forming a magnificent panorama. The city
arteries have been planned with an eye to the require-
ments of a growing centre, Brisbane Street in particular
being a very fine thoroughfare, on each side of which
are to be seen substantial premises of modern design,
which reflect the enterprise of the business community,
and are worthy to rank with the best architectural
features for which the city is noted. The many
beautiful homes erected in and about Ipswich yield
evidence of long-established and solid prosperity—a
prosperity which is derived from a diversity of interests,
manufacturing being mixed with agricultural pursuits
to such an extent that the usual Australian dependence
upon seasonal vagaries is conspicuous by its absence.
Limestone Hill, as Ipswich was originally known,
attracted attention very soon after the first convict
settlement had been established at Moreton Bav.
Captain Logan, the first Commandant, was appointed
in 1824, and from that time onwards a steady stream
of new arrivals set in. Captain Logan, who was an
energetic explorer, led several exjieditions to Limestone
Hill, and his impressions of the place are recorded
in his journal. On June 7, 1827, he wrote:
"Left the settlement (Brisbane) at four o’clock
in the morning; proceeded up the Brisbane, and
arrived at Limestone Hill on the left branch at ten
o’clock at night; distance, 57 miles.” The locality he
described as ‘‘a grand and extensive prospect.” Fur-
ther on he says:—“l may safely report that there is in
this beautiful vale at least half a million acres, excel-
lently watered, and fit for any purpose to which it
may be applied.”
Lime-burning appears to have been commenced at
the site of the Ipswich of to-day during the first few
years of the settlement at Moreton Bay. At that time
a kiln, constructed by convict labour, had been estab-
lished ; whilst an overseer and five prisoners were
carrying out the work of lime-burning. Allan Cunning-
ham, who is recorded as having been at Limestone Hill
on August 12, 1828, whilst engaged in finding the way
to cross the gap in the mountains (named after him)
from the east to the west, makes reference to these
operations in a despatch written by him in the
year 1828:—"From 300 to 400 baskets of excellent
lime are burnt weekly at this station, which is
regularly conveyed down by boat to Brisbane town,
and there used in the buildings in progress. The lime-
stone at Bremer River is very different in appearance
from the calcareous rocks of Argyle, Bathurst, or Wel-
lington Valley. From these it differs, not simply in
colour, which is either yellowish-brown or brownish-
white, but also in its quality, it containing much earthy
matter, without impressions of shells or organic
remains.”
But the real development and progress of Ipswich


began with the early forties. When Spicer Gap was
discovered, at no great distance from Cunningham Gap,
squatters began to pass freely backwards and forwards
through the range. It was then that pastoralists with
their stock trekked northward from the more settled
regions of New South Wales to the prolific Darling
Downs, which Allan Cunningham had discovered as
far back as 1827. By this time the track from
that fertile tableland to the coast of Moreton Bay
was well known, and Limestone Hill formed a
convenient stopping-place on the way, as well as a port
from which wool going down and stores coming up
might be embarked and disembarked from river vessels.
Also, Brisbane had been declared free from the convict
settle in Queensland. Russell writes: —“Limestone in
1840 ! Who, after clearing through the last stretch of
flats, ridges, gullies, and nasty creeks, could have
flattered himself that he would so soon break in upon

slur and the restriction prohibiting civilians approach-
ing within fifty miles. Henry Stuart Russell, in his
“Genesis of Queensland,” describes the impressions of
one of the first of the parties which stumbled across
the embryo settlement, when the passage from the
Darling Downs to the sea coast was first in the making.
Included in this band of travellers were Pemberton
Hodgson, who was a brother of Sir Arthur Hodgson,
and Gilbert Elliot, who afterwards became Speaker of
the Queensland Legislative Assembly. The party did
not cross by means of Spicer Gap, but through Cun-
ningham Gap, where the way had been set a few
months earlier by Patrick Leslie, the first squatter to
among past regrets; they are so often dwelt upon among
the memories without words of those who afterwards
knew you well, and so knowing, esteemed and honoured
you. See the keen, honest, embrowned features of as
good a specimen type of Somersetshire and soldier as
ever stepped in shoe leather. See again, by his side
stands the earnest, active, faithful wife, who has
dared to brighten by her presence this dark corner of
the land. What a contrast! The upright and intelli-
gent man, and the so winsome helpmate, willingly
allotting to themselves the charge of a prison post, a
gang of hardened outlaws, whose compulsory labour
was utilized under the eyes of the plough station near


by.” The George Thorn mentioned in these high terms
of praise by Russell was the father of George Thorn, who
was Premier of Queensland from June, 1876, to March,
1877. In 1841 George Thorn had become the pioneer
storekeeper of what was destined to develop into the busy
city of Ipswich. Having obtained a stock of clothes
and other commodities likely to be needed by travelling
stockmen, squatters, and jackaroos, he began to trade
at that early date. The same hardy settler was exten-
sively growing maize and introducing the nucleus of a
herd of cattle on to pastures adjoining his cultivation
fields. How rapid was the subsequent progress of the
district may be estimated from the fact that, between
January 24 and February 8, 1859, sixty drays were
counted passing down the Main Range loaded with 500
bales of wool for shipment from Ipswich to Brisbane.
The first railway in Queensland connecting Ipswich
with Grandchester was opened in July, 1865. The first
extensions were to Toowoomba and Dalby, and it was
not until June, 1875, that Ipswich and Brisbane were
linked up by rail.
In the early sixties cotton was largely grown, and
for a time the industry made excellent headway. Higher
prices had resulted from the American Civil War, and
to stimulate the production of this important commodity
the Government of the day offered a bonus to growers
of ten pounds 500 lb. of ginned cotton exported
to England. Subsequently the bonus was reduced to
five pounds, and later still to two pounds ten
shillings. Ultimately the bonus was withdrawn, and
from this and other causes the industry gradually
languished.
In 1907 the Commonwealth Government granted
a bonus of 10 per cent, on the market value of
Australian-grown and ginned cotton, an imperative
condition being that it should be grown by means of
white labour only. This bonus finally expired on
June 30, 1916.
Ipswich was proclaimed a local authority on March
2. 1860, and was declared a city on December 3, 1904.
In 1859 the town contained 3,000 inhabitants. To-day
the population of the suburbs approximately equals
that of the city proper, so that within a five-mile radius
there are about 24,000 souls. In the district of which
Ipswich is the industrial and commercial centre there
are 50,000 inhabitants. The five-mile radius includes
the suburbs of Newton, Silkstone, Booval, Tivoli,
Workshops Estate, and Churchill.
The movement to establish a Greater Ipswich was
set afoot many years ago, but was not warmly welcomed
by the adjoining shires. In 1912 the Home Secretary
granted permission to the Ipswich Council to take a poll
of the ratepayers on the question of extension of
boundaries. This was held on March 15, 1913, but the
advocates of the scheme failed to carry the day. On
June 6 of the following year a conference was held
between the Ipswich, Bundamba, and Brassall Shires at
the instigation of the Home Secretary, and as a result of
this meeting the Greater Ijiswich Shire was gazetted on
July 1, 1916, and the boundaries of Ipswich Shire were
extended to take in the shires of Brassall, Bundamba,
Lowood, Purga, and Walloon, while certain alterations
were made to the boundaries of Esk and Rosewood
Shires, and, to prevent any confusion, the old Ipswich
Shire was renamed Moreton Shire. The Greater Ipswich
Council consists of twelve aldermen, this being an addi-
tion of three members to the old council. To Mr. P,
W. Cameron fell the distinction of being the first Mayor
of Greater Ipswich, to which high office he was elected
by his fellow-aldermen on March 16, 1917.
More than half the coal produced in Queensland
comes from the immediate neighbourhood of Ipswich—
Loamside, Rosewood, Walloon, Redbank Plains, Swan-
bank, Dinmore, Blackstone, and Bundamba being all
coal-mining centres. The surrounding agricultural
areas are highly prosperous, the production of
butter being exceedingly heavy, whilst the fertile
nature of the land, coupled with the plentiful coastal
rainfall, render mixed farming a regular and substan-
tial means of livelihood. Butter, cheese, and condensed
milk are all exported from this rich territory, on which
primary industry is so firmly established that already
individual farms have been handed from father to son
for two and three generations.
It is, however, as a manufacturing centre that
Ipswich is most widely known throughout the other
portions of the State. Not only were woollen and
cotton factories established there many years ago, but
the city contains the chief centre of the Queensland
railway workshops. At this establishment, which is
situated in North Ipswich, more than 1,000 hands are
employed.
This brief description of Ipswich can best be con-
cluded by quoting the words of a visiting journalist
from New South Wales, who wrote: —“If you want
light and health-giving air take train or motor-car to
Ipswich, a town which is to Brisbane as Parramatta is
to Sydney, having once been the capital of Queensland,
but which, unlike Parramatta, is now very brisk and
very wide awake, which is no doubt owing to the pres-
ence of large railway workshops. Ipswich has many
hills, and you are told it is the modern Athens,
and for site it might easily claim the title.
The view from Denmark Hill is worth the necessary


and rather steep climb; but the chief
beauty lies in the hills, mainly of trachyte
formation, which surround it like a crown, and in the
is here that you may say that every garden has its
Jacaranda, and planted side by side with it the Grevillea

foliage which abounds everywhere, for this is a most
fertile district, with its river flats covered with alluvial
soil, which in a volcanic district is especially rich. It

like those of the capital, are burning with a glowing
fire of hospitality.”
VIEWS AT IPSWICK.


The late GEORGE THORN. The
name of the Thorn family is inti-
mately and honourably associated
with the history of Ipswich, which
prior to the forties was a penal station
known as Limestone Hill. Beyond
the existing boundaries towards
Brisbane free settlers might not go,
for Brisbane then was also a penal
settlement, and the representative of
the Government was charged with
keeping forbidden areas inviolate.
Mr. George Thorn was then superin-
tendent. A writer who knew and
loved him states that when in
Sydney he was the right-hand man
of the Governor, Sir Richard Boui’ke.
When he was transferred to Lime-
stone Hill, at that time regarded as
beyond the confines of civilization,
Mr. Thorn left to take up his post
with the good wishes of all. He was
born near Stockbridge, Hants, Eng-
land, on April 11, 1806. According
to Mr. H. S. Russell he was a non-
commissioned officer in the 34th
Regiment, but probably a more
correct account is that he served for
some time in the 4th (Queen’s Own)
Regiment in England and elsewhere,
attaining the rank of colour-sergeant.
In 1833 he emigrated to New South
Wales, settling in Sydney. Soon
after he entered the Town Survey
Department, and in this service he
came in contact with Sir Richard
Bourke, and he was present with His
Excellency at the first survey of
Melbourne. Later on he was trans-
ferred to the Commissariat Depart-
ment, and it was while employed in
that then important department that
he was appointed to the superintend-
ency of the Limestone Hill station,
where he arrived with his wife and
eldest son, George, in 1838. In
addition to having charge of the
convicts he had also- under his care
all the Government stock in the
district and the supervision of the
agricultural activities carried on with
prison labour at what was called the
Plough station. Here Mr. Thorn
successfully grew wheat, the first-
ever grown in Queensland. While
Limestone Hill remained a penal
settlement he continued in charge,
but on the colony being made a free
settlement early in 1842 he retired
from the Government service, and
became more and more intimately
associated with the development and
communal life of the town. Mr.
Thorn was regarded as the father of
Ipswich. For many years he was
an alderman, and occupied a very
prominent place in the town and
district. His death occurred in
1876. Mr. George Thorn, jun., was
educated at the local grammar
school, from which he passed to the
University of Sydney, where he took
the degree of B.A. Turning to pub-
lic life, he became a member for the
electorate in which he was brought
up. Early in his career he was
associated with the two men who
have left the most enduring mark on
the public life and history of
Queensland. These were Sir Thomas
MTlwraith and Sir Samuel W.
Griffith. When the second Macalis-
ter Ministry in which he held the
portfolio of Postmaster-General was
defeated in 1876, he was commis-
sioned to form a new administration.
The Ministry, in which Mr. Thorn
combined the offices of Premier,
MR. GEORGE THORN.
Postmaster-General, and Minister
for Public Works, remained in power
from June 5, 1876, to March 8, 1877,
when a reshuffle took place, and Mr.
John Douglas became Premier, with
Mr. Thorn as a colleague until
November, 1877. Mr. George Thorn
did not again hold office, but he con-
tinued a member of Parliament for
many years, and after his defeat at
the polls continued to take a keen
interest in public affairs until his
death. The family has still its asso-
ciations with Ipswich, but branches
of it have spread far and wide.
Ipswich folk, and especially those of
advanced years who have fresh
memories of the old days, recall with
pleasure and respect what they knew
or heard of the father of Ipswich and
his family.
The late HUGH CAMPBELL,
of Ipswich, was born at Tobomory,
Scotland, on November 18, 1829.
His father, the late Donald Camp-
bell, a blacksmith by trade, subse-
quently emigrated to New South
Wales, arriving at Port Jackson in
1838 with his three sons, Hugh,
Lachlan, and John, and one daugh-
ter, Sarah. Upon arrival, finding
things in a very unsettled state, he
accepted an engagement on “Dart-
brook” Station, on the Severn River,
one of the farthest northern rivers
in that State. Here he was
employed by the late Samuel Coxen,
for whom lie worked for 12 months,
eventually starting on his own ac-
count at Scone. Mr. Campbell
afterwards removed to Tamworth,
where he remained for about two
years, and whilst there he heard of
the discovery of splendid pastoral
land on the Darling Downs by
the Leslie Brothers, and as a
result he decided to migrate to
the northern country, which was
declared open- for settlement on
February 10, 1842. Journeying to
Sydney shortly afterwards, Mr.
Campbell and his family left Port
Jackson for Moreton Bay in a small
steamer called the “Nancy,” among
his fellow-passengers being the late,
William Patrick, who was bound for
“Mount Brisbane” Station, under
engagement to the Messrs. Frederic
and Francis Bigge. Mr. Hugh Camp-
bell ‘ then a lad of 12, recollected
their vessel passing the steamer
“Shamrock,” conveying Sir George
Gipps, the Governor of New South
Wales, into Sydney Harbour, upon
his return from an official visit to the
respective Government settlements
at Moreton Bay—namely, Brisbane,
Redbank, and Limestone, in March,
1842. Mr, Donald Campbell and
his party continued their journey
from Brisbane to Ipswich bymeans of
bullock drays, and upon reaching the
inland settlement—where the only
building in existence was the resi-
dence of the superintendent, the late
George Thorn, sen.—a home was first
formed at West Ipswich, on a site
opposite the present cattle-pound.
Miss Campbell (afterwards Mrs.
Wm. Horton, of Drayton), it may be
mentioned, was the fourth white
woman to arrive at Ipswich, her
three predecessors being the late
Mrs. George Thorn, her sister (Miss
Hancock), and Mrs. Wm. Patrick.
The aboriginals were very numerous
in the neighbourhood of the set-
tlement, and on one occasion the
Campbell children saw fully one


thousand of them camping near a
spot known as the One-Mile. Fi'om
West Ipswich a removal was made
to the Toowoomba Road, where Mr.
Donald Campbell established himself
as a blacksmith and wheelwright.
Later he transferred his pre-
mises to a spot near Tiger Lane, and
after one or two more removals
finally made a permanent home on
property which he purchased at one
of the early land sales in Ipswich,
situated on the corner of East and
Limestone Streets—now occupied by
the Ipswich Building Society—where
his death occurred in 1857. The
gentleman under review, who fol-
lowed in the footsteps of his
parent in the blacksmithing trade,
in the lengthy period of his residence
since he first set foot in Ipswich,
was never absent for more than a
few days at a time from the town of
his adoption. He witnessed the
expansion of Ipswich from a lime-
kiln, or sheep run, to a city;
the erection of the first build-
ings, “Black Neale’s’’ “Red
Cow’’ Hotel and the “Queen’s
Arms”; the establishment of the
first general store and boarding-
house by “Schemer” Smith in Bell
Street; the opening of the first school
by a man named Munro under the
same roof as Smith’s store; the ad-
vent of the first bakery and saddlery
businesses by Martin Byrne and
Christopher Gorry respectively, and
the first butcher’s shop by Mr.
Thomas Geraghty on the northern
side of Union Street, known in the
early days as “Thompson’s Row.”
He clearly remembered both the
Red bank and Ipswich penal settle-
ments, that of the '‘Plough” Sta-
tion, near Ipswich, frequently hav-
ing been visited by him. The traffic
on the river in pre-separation days
was carried on between Ipswich and
Brisbane by means of flat-bottomed
boats propelled by oars, South Bris-
bane for many years having been the
water terminus of the Darling
Downs—to which fact was due the
agitation pushed on so energetically
by the pastoral fraternity to make
Cleveland the principal port for
Moreton Bay, and Mr. Campbell was
able to recall the very notable event
of the arrival at the “head of naviga-
tion” of the “Experiment,” the first
steamer from Brisbane, commanded
by the late Captain Alymeer
Campbell. Almost the whole popu-
lation, about 100, assembled to
witness the heading of the steamer
for the wharf, its arrival being
heralded by the tooting of the
Scotch bagpipes. This was in 1846,
and from 1849 to 1859 the town
made great headway. Stores, banks,
and churches were established; the
first newspaper in Ipswich, The
North Australian, was issued in
October, 1855, and four years later
The Ipswich Herald appeared. The
present Court House was completed
in 1859, postal facilities were im-
proved, and the ordinary conditions
of civilized life began to be generally
observed. Mr. Campbell’s recollec-
tions of horse racing dated back as
far as 1846, when races were held
at Cooper Plains, and he recalled
the inauguration of this sport in
Ipswich in 1857, under the reoime
of the North Australian Jockey
Club, which continued until the
death of the late Sir Joshua Peter
MR. HUGH CAMPBELL.
Bell in the early eighties. Mr. Camp-
bell acted as clerk of the course for
a considerable number of years.
Mr. Campbell was one of the oldest
turfites in Queensland, and in the
early fifties was one of the prominent
cricketers of Limestone. Mr. Camp-
bell married a daughter of the late
Malcolm McLean, who settled in
Ipswich in 1848, and had ten sons
and five daughters. He died on
July 30, 1917.
The late Reverend JOSEPH
WALKER was one of those minis-
ters who have left their impress on
the religious life of Southern Queens-
land, where he filled a successful and
lengthy pastorate. He was born
near Manchester, England, on May
12, 1840, and in his twentieth year
entered the ministry in connection
with the Primitive Methodist
Church. On April 18, 1864, he
married Harriet, daughter of the late
Samuel Ives, bookseller and sta-
tioner, of Paternoster Row, London,
and in the following year, after a
strenuous and successful term in the
great industrial centres of the north
of England, he left for Australia at
the urgent request and under the
auspices of the Missionary Society
of his Connexion. After a protracted
voyage in the sailing vessel “Light-
ning,” Mr. Walker, accompanied by
his wife, landed at Melbourne and
entered upon the duties of an im-
portant pastorate at Fitzroy, Mel-
bourne, which he filled with much
acceptance until 1873. Early in that
year he accepted a unanimous call
to the pastorate of the Congre-
gational Church at Ballarat. Mr.
Walker’s energy and devotion is still
held in warm remembrance by Bal-
laratarians, and his name is associ-
ated with the fine church in Dawson
Street, of which he laid the founda-
tion stone. He was also Chairman
of the Congregational Union of
Victoria for 1882-83 and District
Chief Ruler of the Independent
Order of Rechabites. In July, 1885,
in response to a call to become pastor
of the Ipswich Congregational
Church Mr. Walker proceeded to
Queensland and entered upon a very
successful term of service in connec-
tion with the mother church of the
State. The first Congregational
Church in Queensland was opened in
Ipswich on March 11, 1855, and it
is a coincidence that the late Rev.
Dr. Nelson (father of the Right
Hon. Sir H. M. Nelson) officiated at
the morning service, and the late
Rev. E. Griffith (father of the Right
Hon. Sir Samuel Walker Griffith)
preached at the evening service.
When Mr. Walker arrived the cause
consisted of the central church and
four branches, and during his
ministry the number of healthy
branches was increased to nine,
three assistant ministers being ap-
pointed to aid him in his fine centre
of religious activity. In 1893 the
original Sunday-school building was
washed away by the great flood, to
be superseded, however, by the pres-
ent structure, which is recognized as
the finest of its kind in Australia,
the foundation stone of which was
laid by the then Governor, the late
Sir Henry Norman, G.C.B. The
Reverend Joseph Walker way elected
President of the Queensland Con-
gregational Llnion in 1887 and again
in 1901. He was one of the founders


of the Christian Endeavour Society
in Queensland, and evinced an
active interest in every movement
having for its object the common
weal. In 1899 he resigned the Ips-
wich pastorate and, accompanied by
his wife, preceded as Australian
delegate to the World’s Christian
Endeavour Convention at Detroit,

he spent some time in denominational
work in the Homeland, returning to
Queensland in 1901. At the earnest
desire of some Ipswich friends Mr.
Walker started the Congregational
Church at Cracknell Road, South
Brisbane, where he continued his
labours right up to the day of his
death, on March 30, 1905. He was
survived by his devoted wife and two
sons, the elder of whom, Mr. James
Ernest Walker, was educated at

Scots College, Ballarat. After some
years of commercial training in the
Australian Joint Stock Bank he
entered as a student of St. Andrew’s
College and the University of Syd-
ney, where he was successful, gain-
ing with honours the degrees of B.A.
and LL.B. He was admitted to the
New South Wales Bar on October
30, 1896, and to the Queensland Bar
on February 19, 1897, and com-
menced practice in Ipswich in the
last-named year. In 1901 he was
joined in partnership by his brother,
Mr. Samuel Herbert Walker, and
the firm of Walker & Walker was
formed, an office being opened in
Brisbane in 1902. Mr. J. E. Walker
is a member of the Masonic fratern-
ity, his lodge being the Modestia,
E.C., of which he is past master.
He married in 1905 Yera Bridson,
daughter of the late Hon. T. B.
Cribb, and has two sons and one
daughter. Mr. S. H. Walker, the
second surviving son of the late
Joseph Walker, is also a native of
Melbourne, and received his educa-
tion at the Ballarat College and Ips-
wich Grammar School, later pro-
ceeding to St. Andrew’s College and
the University of Sydney, where he
gained with honours the degree of
Bachelor of Arts. Subsequently he
was a member of the teaching staff
of Scots College, Sydney, and New-
ington College, Stanmore. Mr. S. H.
Walker was articled to Mr. J. C.
McGregor, and subsequently to Mr.
Alexander McNab, of Chambers,

mitted as a solicitor of the Queens-
land Supreme Court on June 4,
1901. He displays a keen interest in

The late Honourable LEWIS
THOMAS, M.L.C. Probably there
w T as no more interesting career in
Queensland than that of the gentle-
man under review. Perhaps his most
striking characteristic was his re-
markable perseverance—a trait that
has enabled the British race to do
wonders. It was undoubtedly this
element in his character which, in a
large degree, was responsible for his
success in coal mining. We was born
at Talybont, North Cardiganshire,
Wales, on November 20, 1832, his
father, the late Thomas Thomas,
being engaged in the carrying trade
in that district. Before he was nine
years of age, the little Welsh lad was
put to work in a woollen factory,
where he remained for some six
years. At fifteen he began life in
the lead mines of Esgerhir and
Bwlchgwyn, and subsequently was
engaged for three or four years in
the coal mines and iron works of
South Wales. In July, 1859, he
left the Old Country for Australia,
having come to a decision to risk his
all in a tilt at fortune under the
Southern Cross. Landing at Vic-
toria, he set out at once for the
gold diggings, and spent eighteen
strenuous months on the fields, with
results not sufficiently encouraging
to tempt him to persevere in this
direction. Accordingly, in April,
1861, he left the sister State for
Queensland, where he became iden-
tified with the coal-mining industry,
which was then in its infancy in the
new country, and worked for about
three years and a half on the coal
mines. He next took up half the
contract for the construction of the
railway tunnel piercing the Little
Liverpool Range—now known as the
Great Victoria Tunnel; upon the
completion of which important work
he decided to give his undivided
attention to the development of the
coal resources of the colony, the dis-
trict around Ipswich having shown
good indications of being rich in this
class of mineral wealth. In 1866
he commenced coal-mining at Tivoli,
the method of procedure in those
early days being to start work on
some of the outcrops showing on the
sides of the steepest hills. Horizontal
tunnels were excavated with com-
parative ease, and small waggons, or
barrows, were employed to wheel
out the coal. His operations at this
centre did not prove remunerative,
and he removed to Blackstone,
where, in conjunction with the late
John Malbon Thompson, a well-
known Ipswich solicitor, alderman,
and member of Parliament, he con-
tinued the search for the “black
diamonds.” In the long run, success
attended his efforts, and Mr. Thomas
may well be regarded as the pioneer
of coalmining in Queensland. From
the above-mentioned year until well
on in the eighties he worked assidu-
ously at his pit at Blackstone, and
opened up the famous “Aberdare”
Colliery, which is situated in the
valley to the south of the palatial
residence, “Brynhyfryd.” In view
of the possibility of the extension of
the railway line from Ipswich (which
city had heen the railway terminus
for the Darling Downs up to 1875)
to Brisbane, Mr. Thomas opened a
new mine at Dinmore in September,
1870. He had erected large chutes
on the bank of the Brisbane River,
HON LEWIS THOMES.
near Riverview, to facilitate the
loading of steamers plying between
Brisbane and Ipswich. With the
extension of the railway system in
Queensland, coal mines were further
developed, and Mr. Thomas, who
meanwhile had returned to the
“Aberdare,” began to reap the
benefit of his strenuous work in
opening the coal measures in the
Bundamba area. To his shrewdness
and persistence is due much of the
splendid development, not only of
the coal-bearing country in that
region, but also of the excellent
markets which rewarded the enter-
prise of the “Coal King,” as he was
generally known. By the year 1881
the expansion of his proposition
had attained to such dimensions that
the construction of a private branch
railway line from the coal mine con-
necting up with the main line at
Bundamba became a necessity, and
in carrying out this scheme Mr.
Thomas once more proved himself
one of Queensland’s pioneer spirits in
independent entei'prise. Four years
later Mr. and Mrs. Thomas, accom-
panied by their only daughter (now
Mrs. T. Bridson Cribb), visited
England and Wales. On their return
they were tendered a “welcome
home” by the good people of Black-
stone on December 8, 1885. In 1891
he built the palatial residence to
which reference already has been
made on this page, from the tower
of which a fine view of the surround-
ing country can be seen, the prosper-
ous townships of Blackstone, Silk-
stone, and Booval clustering in the
near vicinity, while farther to the
north the Bremer River winds its
way east to junction with the wider
waters of the Brisbane. Political
life began to absorb Mr. Thomas’
attention towards the close of the
last century, and in 1893 he was
returned as member for Bundamba in
the Legislative Assembly, which seat
he occupied until 1899, subsequent
to which he was called to the Legis-
lative Council, and continued to
serve in this Chamber until the time
of his decease on Feburay 16, 1913.
The late Mr. Thomas possessed in
no small degree an enthusiasm for
music, education, and religion, and
organized in 1877 the first Eistedd-
fod in Queensland, which has since
become an annual event at Black-
stone, the Welsh suburb of Ipswich.
He afterwards donated such gener-
ous prizes as enabled gatherings to
be held, year by year, in Ipswich,
Gympie, Maryborough, Toowoomba,
Brisbane, and other centres, and it
is computed that in this way he gave
considerably over £I,OOO towards
the annual Eisteddfod prizes. In
1909 he presented a scholarship to
the University College of Wales,
Aberystwyth, for the benefit of boys
from the parishes of Llanfihangel-
geneu’r-Glyn and Llancynfelin and
for this purpose he purchased Wes-
tern Australian debentures to the
value of £I,OOO, which he trans-
ferred to the College, the income to
be applied for the maintenance of
a scholarship tenable at the College,
and to be known as the “Lewis
Thomas Scholarship,” preference to
candidates to be given to the sons
of parents of small means, who have
been educated at Talybont. Mr.
Thomas was exceptionally liberal in

his support of all educational move-
ments, especially in connection with
the Ipswich Girls’ Grammar School,
the Ipswich Boys’ Grammar School
(to which he presented the “Lewis
Thomas Scholarship,” the conditions
being similar to those attached to
the Welsh Scholarship!, and the
Technical College. He was a
staunch supporter and liberal con-
tributor to the Congregational
Churches at Blackstone and Ipswich,
their form of worship being the one
to which he was at all times a
devoted adherent. Mr. Thomas mar-
ried in 1859, shortly before leaving
for Australia, and the long period
of eighteen years elapsed before the
husband and wife were reunited,
various reasons prolonging the time
of separation, which terminated upon
Mrs. Thomas’ arrival in Queensland
in July, 1877. On July 8, 1909,
Mr. and Mrs. Thomas celebrated
their golden wedding at “Brynhy-
fryd” (meaning in Welsh “Pleasant
Hill”). The late Lewis Thomas has
been described as “one of the
pioneers of Queensland. ... Of
a rugged personality, possessed of
unflagging energy and an indomit-
able spirit, which enabled him to
persevere in the face of apparently
unsurmountable obstacles, he was
just the stamp of man required by
this distant post of the great British
Empire in the strenuous days of its
youth.”
The late BENJAMIN CRIBB,
founder of the firm of Cribb and
Foote, Ipswich, was born at Poole,
in Dorsetshire, England, on Novem-
ber 7, 1807. His father was captain
of a merchant vessel trading between
Newfoundland and the Mediter-
ranean, and on many occasions took
with him on his voyages his sons,
Robert and Benjamin, who shared
with him the exciting experience of
being wrecked off the Newfoundland
coast. The late Captain Cribb
received injuries at sea which
brought on an illness, terminating
in his death some years later, and
following on this event his sons were
thrown upon their own resources.
Having been brought up to the
grocery trade, Mr. Benjamin Cribb,
in virtue of the exceptional business
faculties of which he had proved
himself the possessor, was offered
the responsible position of head of
the largest grocery establishment in
his native town, which he filled with
credit for some years. Aiming at a
larger sphere he proceeded to Lon-
don, and in partnership with a
younger brother, the late Robert
Cribb, started a manufacturing
business, principally of blacking and
matches, their output being dis-
tributed over a fairly wide radius.
Eventually both brothers were in-
duced by the representations of Dr.
John Duumore Lang (the ardent
champion of emigration, who did so
much to colonize the Moreton Bay
district, after successfully charter-
ing three ships for Port Phillip,
Victoria) to dissever the ties which
bound them to their native land and
make their tilt at fortune on the
other side of the globe. Mr. Robert
Cribb preceded his brother in the
vessel “Fortitude,” the first of Dr.
Lang’s immigration ships to come

tp Moreton Bay. This arrived in
January, 1849, being followed by
the “Chaseley” and the “Lima,”
Mr. Benjamin Cribb being a pas-
senger on board the former of these
two, which, leaving England in
December, 1848, reached her desti-
nation on May 1 of the following,
year. The advent of the Lang immi-
grants completely revolutionized
society in Brisbane and Ipswich,
appearing as they did in long-faced
black hats, frock coats, and gloves,
while the costumes of the residents
of Moreton Bay in those times con-
sisted principally of cabbage-tree
hats, blue dungaree shirts, and mole-
skin trousers. Almost immediately
after arrival, Mr. Benjamin Cribb,
with the scanty means at his dis-
posal, secured premises at the corner
of Queen and Albert Streets, Bris-
bane (the site now occupied by the
Strand pictures), which he named
“Moreton House,” where he carried
on for a year or two, eventually sell-
ing his interests to the Messrs.
Kingsford. He then proceeded to
Ipswich, and started in business in
1849 in premises situated between the
railway bridge and Thain’s boarding-
house. Thenceforward he became
intimately associated with the his-
tory and progress of Ipswich and
the West Moreton district. From the
first the business prospered, and
within a short time Mr. Cribb found
it necessary to secure larger prem-
ises, his choice finally falling on the
block in Bell Street, upon which the
present fine stores now stand. About
1852 Mr. John Clarke Foote arrived
in Ipswich, and shortly afterwards
received the appointment of manager
for Mr. Cribb, some two years later
being admitted as a member of the
firm, which has since become so
widely known under the style of
Cribb & Foote. From this time
onward Mr. Cribb devoted all his
energies to the development of his
enterprise, which with the assistance
of his able and energetic partner was
soon brought into a foremost place
among similar commercial concerns
in Australia. In those days, when
cotton-growing was a Queensland in-
dustry of considerable magnitude,
Messrs. Cribb & Foote’s transactions
greatly helped the man on the land,
and the firm thus played an import-
ant part in the development of the
resources of the West Moreton dis-
trict. They established cotton-gins
and stores in the several centres,
ginned the cotton for the farmers,
and sent it to the markets of the
Old Country, as large a quantity
as 7,000 bales having been for-
warded in a single year. Cribb and
Foote practically financed the cotton-
farmers, and were instrumental in
tiding very many settlers of West
Moreton over their difficulties in
times of drought, flood, and fire. To
illustrate the shrewdness and sagac-
ity of Mr. Benjamin Cribb, an
authentic story of his early business
career may find place here. At that
period—6o odd years ago—the gen-
eral method of conducting business
was by the 1.0.XJ. paper currency.
Ipswich, or Limestone (by which
name it was originally known) was
then the terminus or receiving depot
of the Darling Downs country for
wool and other products of the
Downs, and Mr. Cribb’s growing
popularity as a general storekeeper

did not at all please the contempor-
ary business men, one of whom em-
barked on a scheme to give his rival
a setback. For this purpose he
strolled round the town, collecting
Mr. Cribb’s 1.0.U.’5, for which he
gave his own in exchange, and in
due course presented his bundle of
paper money and demanded payment
on the spot, hinting at the same
time that unless the cash was imme-
diately forthcoming an appeal would
be made to the Court. Mr. Cribb,
however, had got wind of the pro-
ceedings, and had taken the precau-
tion to go round in his turn and
gather up the 1.0.U.’s of the other
man, whom he now invited into his
office, that “the demand might be
attended to." Producing his oppon-
ent’s I.O.U’s, which exceeded the
amount demanded, he remarked,
worked unceasingly. He also con-
cerned himself actively in the Bill
for the amendments in the Constitu-
tion Act of New South Wales, pro-
viding for the alterations of bound-
aries and increasing the number of
electorates, the framing of the Dis-
trict Courts and Municipalities Acts,
etc. He succeeded the late Mr.
George Thorn, sen., popularly known
as the “Father of Ipswich," as
representative of the West Moreton
constituency, on April 20, 1861, and
once again in harness, continued,
with the exception of one session
only, to represent the constituency
of Ipswich in the Queensland House
of Assembly until the prorogation of
Parliament on July 15, 1874. In
municipal matters Mr. Cribb also
took a very active part. The incor-
poration of the town (as it was then)
devotion to the cause of religion was
one of his most outstanding charac-
teristics, and throughout his life he
continued a consistent member and
most liberal supporter of the Congre-
gational Church. It was mainly
through his exertions that the sub-
stantial structure in Brisbane
Street, in which the adherents
of this section of the Christian
Church have met for worship for
many years, was erected, and his first
donation of .£5OO to the building
fund was followed up by much per-
sonal effort towards the clearing off
of the small debt that remained on
the edifice at the time of its opening,
He was president of the British and
Foreign Bible Society, in which he
took a very prominent interest, con-
tributing freely to its funds, and
seldom missing a meeting of its

‘ You, of course, will have no objec-
tion to accept your own paper money,
and I”-—it was Mr. Cribb’s turn
now—“desire the balance in cash
at once, otherwise I shall appeal to
the Court!” Suffice it to say that
there were no further attempts made
to oust Mr. Cribb from Ipswich.
But not only as one of Queensland’s
most eminent commercial men will
Mr. Cribb be remembered. He
played an important part in public
life, representing the interests of
the Ipswich electorate in the House
of Assembly for some 15 years in
all. He was member for Stanley
boroughs (the seat for Ipswich and
Brisbane) in the New South Wales
Parliament in 1858, before separa-
tion became an accomplished fact,
towards which desired issue he

absorbed his attention for a con-
siderable time, and he left no stone*
unturned to bring this matter to
fruition. He was an alderman of the
town council from 1862 to 1863, re-
signing office in the latter year. The
establishment of the local school of
arts was also due in a large measure
to bis advocacy and practical co-
operation in its initial stages, and
after its inception he served both as
president and treasurer of this useful
institution for some years before it
fell into the hands of the municipal
council. He was the prime mover
in connection with the founding of
the Ipswich Boys’ Grammar School
(the first of its kind in the State),
and filled the office of trustee, also
carrying out the duties of treasurer
up to the time of his death. His
committee. The Bush Mission also
found him a warm friend and
helper, and was able to accomplish
much useful work as a result of the
practical encouragement afforded to
its agents by Mr. Cribb and others
likeminded with him. Mr. Benjamin
Cribb died on March 11, 1874, whilst
attending a meeting in the Congre-
gational Church, Ipswich, being
seized with an illness which termin-
ated fatally within a few minutes.
He was twice married, his first
alliance being contracted some time
before his departure from England.
His wife, who was a native of Doug-
las, in the Isle of Man, accompanied
him to Australia with their three
children, viz., Benjamin, Annie
(afterwards the wife of the Rev. S. J,
Green), and Thomas Bridson (all

since deceased). Another child of this
marriage was Mrs. W. Haigh. The
second Mrs. Cribb was a Miss Clarissa
Foote, sister to the late John Clarke
Foote, the issue being four sons
and three daughters, viz., Messrs.
Joseph F., James C., Henry S. and
Ernest Cribb, Mrs. W. R. Spence,
Mrs. W. D. Grimes, and Mrs. B. G.
Wilson. Subsequent to the demise
of the founder of the firm of Cribb
and Foote, the conduct of the busi-
ness was continued by his widow and
by the late Hon. J. C. Foote until
1891, when both retired in favour
of younger members of their respec-
tive families. On May 3, 1899, the
firm celebrated its fiftieth anniver-
sary, the function taking the form
of a “jubilee picnic,” to which all
the employes, with their wives and
families, were invited. The picnic
was held at a pretty spot on the
Fassifern railway line, known as
Hillside, about 10 miles distant from
Ipswich, and close upon 500 persons,
representing the firm’s various busi-
ness houses in Brisbane, Ipswich,
Fernvale, Lowood, Laidley, and
Gatton, gathered to celebrate this
notable occasion. Under the excel-
lent organization of Mr. James C.
Cribb, the whole of the arrange-
ments were carried out without a
hitch, everything that was pos-
sible being done to make the outing
a never-to-be-forgotten one. The ban-
quet, which was presided over by Mr.
T. B. Cribb, M.L.A., was marked by
the greatest enthusiasm, showing
plainly that the utmost good feeling
existed between the principals of the
firm and those in their employ. Mr.
Joseph Ivett, the chief clerk and an
old employe of Cribb & Foote, in
the course of his remarks voiced the
sentiments of all present by saying:
“I desire on behalf of the employes
to offer the firm our hearty congratu-
lations upon its having attained
the jubilee of its business life.
Fifty years! How much has been
written and how much has been done
during that period ! When we glance
at the photographs on the menu
cards, what pleasant memories they
bring to those of us who were
acquainted with the two gentlemen
whose counterfeit presentments there
appear—the late Mr. Benjamin
Cribb and the late Hon. J. C. Foote.
We recall the many kindnesses ex-
tended to us by these gentlemen—
they who were the founders of the
firm whose ’ubilee we are celebrating
to-day. rejoice to-day because
the founda/ ions of that business are
sure and sound, and because we
know that the present representa-
tives of the firm are following in the
footsteps of the founders. The prin-
ciples of uprightness and integrity
are to be found in their actions, and
to this we are indeed pleased to bear
testimony. Those of us who have
been employed by Messrs. Cribb and
Foote for any length of time can
also testify to the courteous way in
which we have always been treated
by the firm, and this has been an
incentive to us to do the very best
we can in the interests of our
employers. I know that I am voicing
the heartfelt wishes of you all when
I extend to the firm hearty congratu-
lations upon this, the occasion of
its jubilee. On behalf of you all,
I wish the individual members of
the firm happiness, long life, and
success.” All present then rose and
responded cordially to Mr. Ivett’s
invitation by prolonged applause,
terminating with three hearty cheers
for Messrs. Cribb & Foote. Mr.
Thomas Bridson Cribb on rising to
respond was also greeted with loud
and prolonged applause. Mr. Cribb
said : “I have very heartily to thank
Mr. Ivett and all of you, not only
on my own account, but also on
account of those who are associated
with me in the business, for the very
kindly expressions which were given
voice to by Mr. Ivett and endorsed
by you all. A jubilee, unfortunately,
does not come very often, and it
makes one feel that he is getting old
when he has passed the jubilee of
life. I do not suppose that there will
be many of us spared to take part
in the centenary celebration of the
firm, but if any of you are, I trust
that you will then spend as enjoyable
a time as you are having to-day. In
acknowledging the words spoken by
Mr. Ivett, I desire to acknowledge on
behalf of the firm our hearts’ appre-
ciation of the faithful and honest
service which has been rendered us
from time to time by those whom we
have employed. Our regret is that
we were not able to have had all our
past employes with us to-day. I
thank you very heartily for the
kind expressions voiced by Mr.
Ivett.” Mr. A. J. Foote, who was
received with warm applause, en-
dorsed the remarks made by Mr.
Cribb. He said: “I feel confident
that the present position of the firm
is due in a great measure to the true,
loyal, and hearty support which it
has always received from its
workers. The firm’s employes are a
body of men and women who are
not afraid to put their shoulders to
the wheel. I feel proud to be a
member of a firm which has such a
splendid band of willing workers and
I wish you all individually every
happiness and future success.” Mr.
Jacob Born, as one of the oldest
employes of the firm, bore testimony
to the good feeling which existed
between the firms and its work-
people, and eulogized the late as
also the present members, tor the
very considerate way in which they
always treated their employes. A
mammoth jubilee cake wos a feature
of the celebration, decorating the
centre of the festive board, which
was spread in a large marquee
pitched on the western slope of
Greenmount, from the summit of
which a beautiful view of the sur-
rounding country may be obtained.
At a very early date in the history
of the firm, owing to the rapid
extension of the business, it became
necessary to seek increased accom-
modation. A fire breaking out and
badly gutting the back stores on
July 27, 1865, precipitated the
matter, with the result that in 1866,
the site at the corner of Brisbane
and Bell Streets was purchased by
Messrs. Cribb & Foote. Subse-
quently other blocks were acquired
as the exigencies of the busi-
ness demanded, the property known
for years as the original site
of the Bank of Australasia com-
ing into possession of the firm about
1889, when considerable enlarge-
ments were made in the several de-
partments. The present fine premises
in Bell Street were opened on
November 29, 1912, the occasion
being synchronous with the beet
wishes of many thousands of cus-
tomers. The building has a frontage
to Bell Street of 165 feet by a depth
of 132 feet, and adjoins the old brick
drapery shop, but is set back 10 feet
from the rear of the Brisbane Street
premises, so as to form a light court
between the old and new blocks. The
structure is three storeys in height,
and of brick construction, finished
with red facing bricks, tuck pointed,
relieved with blue facing bricks in
piers and semicircular arches, and
having cemented entablature, pedi-
ments, cornices, aprons, strings, and
brackets. The beams or girders over
the shop fronts carrying the super-
structure are composed of concrete,
reinforced with three heavy kahn-
bartrusses, built in situ, which are
encased with keylock lathing and


cemented in order to resist combus-
tion. Similar beams have been con-
structed where required in other
parts of the buildings. The ground
floor has two entrances from Bell
Street, with island showcases in the
centre of each, paved with black-and-
white tesselated tiles. The silky oak
entrance doors are very imposing,
with their elliptical panels of bev-
elled plate glass, and special atten-
tion has been given to light and
ventilation. The plastered walls,
coloured a soft tint of cream, and
dressmaking, millinery, and tailor-
ing, and a telephone exchange is in-
stalled. Communication between the
new and old premises is provided by
means of enclosed gangways bridging
the 10-foot area separating the
blocks. On the third floor two
luncheon rooms have been provided
for the use of the employes, and
here also is the firm’s board room.
The luncheon rooms open on to the
roof garden flats, measuring 58 feet
by 36 feet and 47 feet by 29 feet
respectively. A large dray and cart
connected with a septic tank system,
installed by Hurll & Co., Sydney,
Electric lighting is used exclusively
in the premises, about 320 lights
having been installed, each fitted
with Holophane glass shades, de-
signed to distribute the light without
glare. The windows are illuminated
with lights of 200 candle-power each,
placed over the footpath, and jmo-
vided with inclined shades to direct
the light into the windows. Electric
power is now used for many pur-
poses, and the powder-generating

the choice designs of Wunderlich’s
pressed metal ceilings, with posts
and beams en suite, painted white
and light buff respectively, with flat
colour finish, and the delicate tints
of the leadlight windows over the
shop fronts give a quiet charm to
this floor. The first floor is a very
fine department, beautifully lighted
and well ventilated practically on the
four sides. The second floor is fitted
up to carry reserve stocks, and is
also laid out as workrooms for

ern side, recessed under the first floor
of the main building, and having
spacious yard accommodation with
good macadamized formation. A
double trolly track, 9 feet wide, has
been concreted in on the western
side of the building. A water-tower
has been erected at the south-west
angle, and a tank of 9,000 gallons
capacity supplies a hydrant service
operating at each floor. On the top
floor are located the lavatories,
plant is placed in a substantial brick
powerhouse of two storeys, detached,
some distance from the main build-
ing. Two separate generatino- units
are provided, each comprising a
dynamo belted to a 45 b.h.p %as
engine, with suction gas producer,
A storage battery is installed on the
first floor, and is of sufficient capacity
to supply the full load for a con-
siderable period if necessary. The
pneumatic tube cash system wae in-
stalled throughout these premises at


their erection, and latterly through-
out the older portion of the stores,

Limited. The shop fronts are dis-
tinctive in character, and give
plenty of scope for the art of the
window dresser, as the plateglass
windows are pi - actically continuous,
the stanchions being covered with
mirrored panels. A base of polished
white marble sets off the fronts and
the island showcases. The cost of
these handsome and commodious
premises exceeded £40,000. Thus,
step by step, progress has been made,
and the expansion of the firm’s opera-
tions has been commensurate with
the general advancement of the dis-
trict and the State. For many years
Cribb & Foote have occupied the
honoured position of being one of the
biggest firms of importers and traders
in Australasia, Filling the role of
universal providers, almost every
conceivable article may be obtained
at their stores, which, occupying a
large area in the centre of Ipswich,
form one of the most important land-
marks of the city.
The late Honourable JOHN
CLARKE FOOTE, M.L.C., was
born at Caine, Wiltshire, England,
on July 10, 1822. He was a son of
the late Rev. Joseph Foote, who came
to Australia from the Old Country
to found a Church at Richmond,
Tasmania, in the early days of that
colony’s history. He brought with
him his seven children, Messrs. John
Clarke, Alfred W., James (after-
wards a well-known storekeeper of
Brisbane Street, Ipswich), and
Joseph Foote, and three daughters,
who married respectively the late
Banjamin Cribb, Mr. J. G. Cribb (of
Brisbane), and Mr. T. Bennett. Mrs.
Bennett is now the only surviving
member of the original Foote family.
Mr. John Clarke Foote received his
primary education at a private school
in Gloucestershire, England, during
his student days acquiring a know-
ledge of chemistry. Tie voyaged to
Moreton Bay by the vessel “Emi-
grant,” among his fellow-passengers
being the parents of His Jlonour Mr.
Justice Real. A malady termed the
“black death” broke out on board
ship, and the doctor falling a victim
to the disease, Mr. J. C. Foote took
up his duties and carried out the
dispensary work. After four months
spent in quarantine on Stradbroke
Island, Mr. Foote set foot in Bris-
bane towards the close of the year
1850, and subsequently engaged
with the late David Cannon McCon-
nel, of “Cressbrook” Station, spend-
ing three months on the station
in pastoral avocations. He next
accepted an appointment as teacher
at the German settlement near Nun-
dah, and later came to Ipswich to
take over the management of the
London Stores, established in Bell
Street by the late Benjamin Cribb.
After filling this post for a couple
of years he was admitted into part-
nership by Mr. Cribb, and played
an important part in the building up
of the firm’s interests in Ipswich and
elsewhere. Following the death of
Mr. Benjamin Cribb, the business
was continued under the supervision
of Messrs. J. C. Foote and Joseph F.
Cribb (on behalf of Mrs. Cribb, sen.).
On July 31, 1891, the former made

over his share to his three sons,
Messrs. Ambrose J., William H.,
and Joseph Foote, and retired
from the business. On May 12,
1877, Mr. John Clarke Foote was
appointed to the Legislative Council
by the Thorn Administration. He
was .deeply interested in politics, and
although he did not come promi-
nently before the public gaze, he
exercised a practical sympathy with
all institutions of a philanthropic
nature, and was always to the fore
in any movement havin" for its
object the advancement of the town
and district. For many years he was
one of the trustees of the Ipswich
Boys’ Grammar School, and he was
a vice-president of the Queensland
Pastoral and Agricultural Society.
Religious matters claimed his sincere
attention, and in his early days
at Ipswich he acted as precentor of
St. Stephen’s Presbyterian Church.
Upon the establishment of the Wes-
leyan Connexion at Ipswich he asso-
ciated himself with that denomina-
tion, and worked energetically in its
interests as long as he was able to
get about, occasionally occupying the
pulpit. He was one of the most
effective class leaders the Church
ever possessed, was on the local
preachers’ plan, and for upwards of
35 years filled the office of superin-
tendent of the Sunday school, also
conducting a Bible class for young
men up to within 18 months of his
death. He was keenly interested in
gardening, and was a consistent ex-
hibitor and frequent prizewinner at
the annual shows held by the
Ipswich Agricultural and Horticul-
tural Society during its most flour-
ishing days. Mr. J. C. Foote died in
the seventy-third year of his age.
His eldest daughter became the wife
of the late Hon. T. Bridson Cribb.
The personnel of the firm has under-
gone many changes. Upon the
death of Mr. T. B. Cribb his widow,
Mrs. M. L. Cribb, succeeded to his
interests, retiring from the firm in
1916. Prior to this date Mr. J. C.
Cribb and Mr. Joseph Foote had
retired, leaving Messrs. Joseph F.
Cribb, Henry S. Cribb, Ambrose J.
Foote, and William 11. Foote in
control, and these last-named gentle-
men constitute the present firm of
Cribb & Foote.
The late Hon. THOMAS BRID-
SON CRIBB, M.L.C., a one-time
member of the influential firm of
Messrs. Cribb & Foote, was one of
the most widely-known and respected
residents of Ipswich, in which town
he spent almost the whole of a life
which fell short by two years only
of the allotted span of three score
years and ten. Born in London on
December 1, 1845, he was brought
to Australia by his parents when
only four years of age, his father,
the late Banjamin Cribb (of whom
an extended notice appears elsewhere
in this work), subsequently becoming
the founder of the big mercantile
firm above-mentioned, which rapidly
attained a high reputation as one of
the foremost commercial enterprises
of the Commonwealth, and the busi-
ness organization of which has been
one of the triumphs of the industrial
capital of Queensland. Young
Cribb received his education at the


Ipswich Boys’ Grammar School,
founded by his father in conjunction
with other prominent men of the
district, and was one of the first 16
boys who attended the opening

out by the late Sir George Ferguson
Bowen, first Governor of Queens-
land, on September 25, 1863. At the
termination of his scholastic career,
the late Mr. Cribb entered upon
business pursuits in the office de-
partment of his father’s firm, and
in this capacity he became closely
associated with the growth and
expansion of its operations, eventu-
ally being admitted into partnership.
He had always manifested a keen
interest in political affairs, and again
following in the footsteps of his
parent, qualified himself for Parlia-
mentary life, and in 1893 was ap-
pointed a member of the State Legis-
lative Council. Three years later he
acceded to representations made by
his fellow-citizens, and resigned his
seat in the Council in order to contest
the Ipswich electorate as a candidate
for the Legislative Assembly, upon
which occasion he was returned by
the largest vote ever granted to a

to that date. Mr. Cribb was well
known to be endowed with the in-

the average, and these gifts were

through the harassing period of the
big drought, which was one of the
most trying experiences through
which Queensland has ever been
called upon to pass. In a courageous
endeavour to meet the difficulties of
the situation, Mr. Cribb, as State
Treasurer, introduced the measure
subsequently used to bring about his
defeat in the elections of 1903, when
his career in the political arena
practically terminated. Before then
Mr. Cribb had retired from the firm
of Cribb & Foote, and henceforth he
lived in partial retirement, devoting
his energies and abilities to the

his death he was president of the

of the Ipswich Congregational

many years with unfailing devotion.


On June 13, 1913, only three months
before his death, which occurred on
September 4 of that year, Mr.
Cribb was again appointed a member
of the Legislative Council, but on
account of failing health was unable
to take his place in the Chamber.
Of him it was well said, “In all
walks of life he proved himself a
man; kind and unassuming, he was
universally and admired,
and in him Ipswich lost a notable
personality and one of her most illus-
trious public men.” Mr. Cribb mar-
ried Lucy, eldest daughter of the
late Hon. J. C. Foote, M.L.C., and
was survived by a widow and family
of five sons and two daughters, the
latter being Miss Cribb, M.A., of

and Mrs. J. E. Walker. The eldest
son, Thomas Bridson Cribb, J.P.,
of “Brynhyfryd,” for over 21 years
was associated with the firm of
Cribb & Foote, retiring in July,
1916. He is prominent in Masonic
circles, being a past master of the
Modestia Lodge, 3587, E.C., and of
the Limestone Mark Lodge, 660,
E.C.; second principal of the Royal
Arch-Chapter Toowong Lodge, 2306,
E.C.; commander of the Royal Ark
Mariners, Toowong Lodge, 526;
assistant grand director of cere-
monies, Grand Lodge, E.C.; and
grand junior overseer, Mark Grand
Lodge, E.C. He is president of the
Cambrian Choir, Ipswich, and a
patron of the Ipswich branch of the
Royal Society of St. George. Mr.
Cribb volunteered for active service,
but failed to pass the requisite test,
He married on April 1, 1901, Mary,
only daughter of the late Hon. Lewis
Thomas, M.L.C., by whom he has
issue two sons and two daughters.
The second son, Herbert Bridson,
now (1917) serving in France with
the A.1.F., is an assayer by profes-
eion, and for several years was with
the Mount Morgan Gold Mining
Company, besides spending some time
at Many Peaks. Subsequently he
entered the Government Department
of Mines, resigning his post in
1915 to join the A.I.F. He left
Australia in April, 1916, with the
12th Reinforcements, 26th Infantry
Battalion, and was wounded on the
western front in October, 1917. The
third eon, Roy Bridson, spent two
years with David Jones, Limited,
Sydney, and afterwards held a
responsible post in Cribb & Foote’s.
He answered his country’s call by

JAMES CLARKE CRIBB, J.P.,
formerly member of tbe Legislative
Assembly, representing the constitu-
ency of Bundamba, who resides at
“Garowie” (aboriginal nomenclature
“Figtree Camp”), Ipswich, was
born on October 4, 1856, at the
small but important settlement then
known as Limestone, from which the
big industrial capital of Queensland

MR. JAMES CLARKE CRIBB.
has since evolved. He is the fourth
son of the late Benjamin Cribb, the
founder of the widely-known firm of
Cribb & Foote, one of the largest
business organizations of the Com-
monwealth, and a landmark of
Ipswich history. During his boyhood
he attended a local school, where he
completed his education at 17 years
of age, and having discarded his
schoolbooks turned his attention to
the responsible duties of life. His
first business experience was obtained
in the drapery department of the
firm above mentioned, with which he
continued his connection for a
lengthy period extending over three
decades, during which time he was
admitted as one of the principals of
the concern. In July, 1904, Mr.
Cribb decided to retire from active
business pursuits, and accordingly
disposed of his interest to the other
members of the firm. While still a
busy man of commerce, taking his
place daily on the round of routine
in the big warehouse in Ipswich, he
was approached by the ratepayers
of Bundamba Shire Council, who
were anxious to secure the services
of one who had proved his ability in
various directions to represent them
in the local governing body. Having
gained the consent of the gentleman
concerned, they duly elected him to
office, and for some time he con-
tinued his association with this
organization, proving himself a very
useful addition to the circle sur-
rounding the Council table, and
always commanding an attentive
hearing. As his gifts as an admin-
istrator became more definitely
marked, and he acquired the matur-
ity of style in public speaking which
gave still further weight to his
utterances, Mr. Cribb’s special quali-
fications for Parliamentary life
began to attract attention, with the
result that in the early part of 1893
he contested the Rosewood constitu-
ency, which had been represented by
the late Mr. Hargrave, and was suc-
cessful, beating his opponent at the
polls by a big majority, despite the
fact that it was his first public
appearance on the platform. The
promises made by him on the
hustings were no mere air-
bubbles, and it was characteristic
of the man that he spared himself
no effort or pains in championing the
interests of his constituency. Owing,
however, to severe pressure on his
time and strength, made by impoi't-
ant development policy in the special
department of Messrs. Cribb and
Foote’s business for the control of
which he was responsible, Mr. J. C.
Cribb found it advisable to retire
from public life for a time, and at
the expiration of the term for which
he had been elected he declined re-
nomination for the seat. Three years
later, having piloted his forward
movement in the warehouse to a suc-
cessful stage, he once more gave his
consideration to the claims of the
country, and at the approach of the
general election of 1909 allowed him-
self to be nominated for the mining
constituency of Bundamba. He again
scored a victory, and during the
whole of the period that this elec-
torate was in existence, sat as its
representative in the Assembly.
When the Act authorizing the re-
distribution of seats came into force,
Bundamba was merged into other
electorates, and Mr. Cribb then be-
came a candidate for Bremer con-
stituency, which combined all the
northern portion of the town of
Ipswich with the surrounding dis-
tricts, also including a part of the
old Bundamba electorate. At the
ensuing election he was again re-
turned, and it is worthy of mention
in this connection that during the
whole of the 19 years that he served
as member of Parliament he never
once was defeated at the polls, and
this despite the fact that the Bun-
damba district especially was noted
for the strength of its Labour vote.
He was conspicuously fortunate in
winning and retaining the confidence
of the electors, by whom he was
always regarded in the light of a
personal friend as well as their
deputy in the affairs of State—one
who would fight their battle with
unremitting vigilance and with the
skilled weapons of which he was so
expert a master. A man of marked
personality, his very presence carried
weight, and his sterling character
and good judgment gave him so wide
an influence with all sorts and con-
ditions of men that to him was very
generally ascribed much of the tran-
quility which existed at that time
in industrial circles about Ipswich.
It is worthy to be handed down
among the annals of the period as
a matter of history that among the
many valuable services rendered to
his day and generation by this
eminent Queensland statesmen, his

claim to a place in the public coun-
sels of the country was substantiated
by his method of dealing with
industrial problems alone. He
was instrumental in bringing about
an amicable agreement between
employes and proprietors in the coal-
mining industry, and allowed himself
to be made the pivot of a scheme
which worked admirably for a


lengthy period, the main feature of
which was the meeting together, in
pre-arbitration days, of masters and
men to arbitrate, discuss the general
conditions of things, and to settle

points of difference in an amicable
manner. In these gatherings Mr.
Cribb was an important factor, and
by his intelligent grasp of the situa-
tion, fine business acumen, and ex-
cellent tact, he held the balance by
which the general good of the com-
munity concerned might be ascer-
tained. Another reform measure was
brought about, almost entirely as a
result of his advice, based on an
intimate knowledge of the prevailing
conditions in the local coal industry.
A regulation was brought in by
Parliament enabling the Railway
Department to procure coal at a
schedule price, thus doing away with
the undesirable competition which
arose through the system of calling
for tenders, resulting in a bare profit
for the owners and an equally unsat-
isfactory state of things from the
point of view of the employe. Mr.
Cribb was distinguished by a very
strong sense of justice, and though
a staunch Liberal in politics, he
never allowed his vision to become
obscured by party considerations or
any other motives equally unworthy
of the representative of a district
where all shades of political opinion
found a home. Fair, straightfor-
ward public dealing and full atten-
tion to the wants of the worker
equally with those of the owner were
among his cardinal virtues, and so
successful was he in impressing those
with whom he was brought into con-
tact with this habit of his mind that
even in the ranks of the Labour sup-
porters those who were open to
reason yielded him their support.
Another matter worthy of record,
and giving evidence of the influence
he wielded in high places, is found
in the fact that in consequence of his
impregnable belief in the future of
the coal industry on the Bundamba
belt, by persistent agitation he was
able to force the hands of the author-
ities of that period (even against the
expert advice of the Mining Inspec-
tor), and to promote the construction
of the present loop line of railway
to serve that district. This line has
abundantly justified Mr. Cribb’s
progressive policy by becoming the
means of transport for the biggest

output of coal in the whole of the
wide coal-bearing region in the vicin-
ity of Ipswich, a development which
would have been improbable without
the stimulus given by the existence
of the line, which thus proved a most
incontrovertible witness of the value
of the field to the State. Mr. Cribb
retired from parliamentary life in
1915, having declined nomination
for the general election of
1915, when the Liberal Government
suffered defeat at the polls. His
reason for this retirement was to be
found in failing health, which, how-
ever. has not prevented him from
displaying a cordial interest in the
various organizations with which from
time to time he has been associated
in an official capacity. Mr. Cribb
has always been looked upon as a
yeoman supimrter of all movements
for the betterment of the district,
and his sympathy with indigent and
suffering humanity, and with all
efforts to promote the prosperity of
commerce, education, and religion,
has become a foregone conclusion.
He is a member of the Ipswich Hos-
pital committee, and director of such
important enterprises as the Ipswich
Gas and Coke Company and the
Queensland Woollen Company. He
acts as trustee of the Ipswich Girls’
Grammar School, and for several
years was chairman of the Girls’
Central State School Council. His
religious activities have found full
scope in the Congregational com-
munion, and for many years he was
one of the most prominent workers
in the local church of that denomina-
tion, taking especial interest in the
important Sunday-school department,
and serving as superintendent of the
Sunday school for a very lengthy
period. Over 30 years ago (in 1882-
1883) he took a trip round the world,
in the course of which he visited
numerous places of historic interest,
not only in England and America,
but in foreign lands, considerably
enlarging his knowledge of men and
things, and garnering up experience
which has proved of much benefit to
him during the years which have
since elapsed. Mr. Cribb married in
February, 1884, Alice Elizabeth,
MR. COLIN CLARKE CRIBB.
eldest daughter of the late Rev.
F. H. Browne, at that time pastor
of the Richmond Congregational
Church, Melbourne, who at an
earlier period was pastor of the local


church at Ipswich, where he con-
tinued for seven years, from 1874 to
1882. Of this union there is a family
of three sons and four daughters,
and of the sons two have answered
the call to fight for King and coun-
try in the stupendous European war
now being waged between Germany
and the allied nations. Mr. Cribb’s

profession of civil engineer, being in

field in France in November, 1917.
Subsequently in one of the numerous
engagements with the enemy he was
"gassed,” and at the time of writing
(December, 1917) is in hospital in
London. The second son, Gunner
Harold Clarke, was a student at the
Ipswich Boys’ Grammar School at
the time of the declaration of war,
but although still a minor, in 1916
followed the example set by his
brother, and in May of that year left
with the 108th Howitzer Battery,
entered the arena of commerce as
a junior in the office of Cribb
and Foote. Commencing at the
lowest rung of the ladder, he gradu-
ally worked his way upwards, pass-
ing from one department to another,
in this way gaining a comprehensive
knowledge of the business in all its
branches. As the years passed on,
greater responsibility fell to his
share, and to-day he fulfils the duties
of office manager to the firm, besides
which he is on the board of directors.

of lawn tennis, and was amateur
champion of the West Moreton
district for twelve months. Mr.
Cribb is a life member of the
L.T.A. of Queensland. He was
one of the founders of the Queens-
land Hunt Club, and while that
body existed proved himself one
of its most ardent and practical sup-
porters and followers, being noted
as a fearless rider and the owner of
some of the best hunters to be found
in the State. He played in A grade
cricket with considerable success, and
was a keen advocate of Australia’s
national sport. His grit and muscle
have also been well tested in the
football field, and he achieved promi-
nence as a "forward” when the game
was played under the old Victorian
rules. His club, then under the
captaincy of Mr. Tom O’Sullivan
(now Judge O’Sullivan), was the
premier team of the district, and
Mr. Cribb had the honour of being
included in the team chosen to do
battle for Queensland against New
South Wales about the year 1884. He
was captain of the quartette chosen
to contest the honours with a team
of New South Wales polo players in
Sydney in the late nineties, the other

and breeder of blood stock for the
past 30 years, and his name has
come prominently before the leading
stud-masters of the world as a sound
and fearless judge of the thorough-
bred trotter. In the year 1909 he
purchased from Mr. George Ireland,
of Newcastle, N.S.W., ‘ Major Hall”
(record then champion trott-
ing pony of Australia. This pony
took first and champion in the
14-hands class at the Royal Show,
Sydney, in 1908, and held the £-mile
gravel track championship of Queens-
land, covering the distance in 2.244.
In March of the following year he
secured “Twinkle Bells,” by “Abbey
Bells” (imp.) —“Twinkle,” who as a
three-year-old held the mile record
for Australia. At Richmond,
Victoria, “Twinkle Bells” trotted a
mile in the record time of 2.19, and
she held the trotting championship
of Queensland in 1910. Other pur-
chases included “Twinkle” (dam of
“Twinkle Bells”), “Sparkling Bells”
(2.15), and “Evening Chimes,”
winner of the valuable Richmond
Futurity Stakes in 1910, recording
2.31 for the distance. Among other
fine performers owned by Mr. Cribb
may be mentioned “Rex Wilkes”

“Princess Gulvallis,” the lastnamed

other importation of Mr. Cribb’s
was “Marvin Wilkes” (2.12 J), prob-
ably the finest trotter ever intro-
duced to Australia. This horse was
bred in America, and is a descend-
ant of the world’s greatest quartette
—“Nutwood” (world’s champion
sire of brood mares), “Electioneer”
(world’s champion sire of trotters),
“Belmont” (216 descendants in the
2.10 list), and “George Wilkes”
(world’s champion sire of sires; sons
sired 3,004 in Standard list). “Mar-
vin Wilkes” stands 16 hands, and
represents the perfect type of harness
horse. At Santa Rosa, California,


U.S.A., he captured a £I,OOO stake
in record time, since when he has held
champion honours in New Zealand,
Victoria, and Queensland. In 1910,
at the National Show, Brisbane,
Mr. Cribb’s horses carried off the
stallion and reserve championship
of Queensland in the Trotters’
Section. With “Idolwood” Mr.
Cribb won - the whole six events at
the National Show of 1915, and
established a fresh record (2.23|) for
two-year-olds, which time is still
unbeaten. Since 1909 he has been a
most successful exhibitor, winning
as many as 52 events at a single
exhibition, and the gold and silver
trophies, medals, and ribands in his
possession are legion. His present

"MARVIN WILKES,” BY "DON MARVIN” —“NORA 5.”
JACOB BORN, one of the most
widely-known and respected resi-
dents of West Moreton district, first
arrived in Ipswich on November 28,


1863, having left his native place,
Ernsthausen, Frankenburg, Hesse
Cassel, on August 1 of that year.
Arriving at Hamburg on August 9,
he deposited the full amount of his
passage money, and secured a berth
on board the barque “San Fran-
cisco,” 404 tonnage, under Captain
Stortewbecher, which sailed from
Cuxhaven, at the mouth of the Elbe,
on the fourteenth day of the same
month. Upon this vessel were some
264 immigrants to Australia, most
of whom were brought out under
the auspices of the German Immigra-
tion Agency, as conducted by Messrs.
J. C. Heussler & Co., the Brisbane
agents of that scheme. The medical
man, who acted as superintendent,
was Dr. Walthardt, and there were
between 60 and 70 single men on
board, among whom were a large
number of skilled mechanics. The
“San Francisco” moored at Moreton
Bay on November 26, 1863, and on
the following day her passengers
were landed at Brisbane. Mr. Born,
who was an orphan, and had come
to Queensland entirely on his own
responsibility, being then in his
eighteenth year, decided to proceed
to Ipswich by the paddle-wheel
steamer which bore the same name
as the inland town, and upon pay-
ment of a shilling fare, in due
course was landed at the old A.S.N.
Company’s wharf, situated at the
foot of Bell Street, Ipswich. He was
accosted by the late John North,
who was in charge of the back stores
of Messrs. Cribb & Foote, and by
their carter, the late John Reid, but
being ignorant of any language but
his native German, he was unable to
make any intelligible reply. The
Ipswich agent for the navigation
company took compassion on the
young stranger, and allowed him to
leave his box in the slab store be-
longing to the company, and upon
the following day he was noticed by
the late Hon. John Clarke Foote,
M.L.C., who proved a friend in
need. Calling to his assistance as
interpreter Mr. Francis Klein, he
interrogated the lad, and immedi-
ately engaged him for work in the
back stores, where he commenced on
December 1 his lengthy connection
with the firm of Cribb & Foote. He
was domiciled in quarters at the
residence of the late J. C. Foote,
who had a house and a fine garden
in Martin Street, and soon acquir-
ing the English language, began to
feel at home in the new and strange
land to which he had ventured,
another friend who evinced a kindly
concern in him being the late James
Hockley, who subsequently became
head of the firm of Hockley Limited,
in Maryborough. When Mr. Born
arrived at Ipswich this city was the
land terminus of the Darling Downs,
and the steamer traffic on the river
between Ipswich and the metropolis
was then at its height. It was no
unusual sight to see Bell Street,
East Street, and Bremer Street all
crowded with teams of bullocks,
either unloading wool from the Con-
damine or waiting to be traded with,
with stores for the “never never”
country. On February 26, 1864,
Mr. Born was present at the cere-
mony of the turning of the first sod
at North Ipswich, of the southern
and western railway, and he also

witnessed the opening of the first
section of 21 miles of that line on
July 30, 1865. During the latter
part of the sixties cotton-growing
was the principal occupation of the
farmers throughout West Moreton
district, and Mr. Born well remem-
bers the terrible hardships experi-
enced by the farming population
through the collapse in 1866 of a
firm of English bankers with whom
the Queensland Government was
negotiating to meet the “railway
bill.” The navvies on the railway
constructional work at Helidon went
out on strike. Bad times were encoun-
tered by almost everyone, among the
chief sufferers being many of the
farmers in West Moreton, who had
only just taken up land under the
new Land Act. It was about this
period (in 1866) that Messrs. Cribb
and Foote placed Mr. Born in a
position of responsibility, commis-
sioning him to visit the whole of the
surrounding farming district for the
purpose of ascertaining who of the
distressed farmers required financial
aid. This proved an eye-opener to
Mr. Born, who confessed that he
could have had no conception of the
misery suffered by the people on the
land through no fault of their own,
but simply because they could not
obtain any return for their products,
cotton, maize, potatoes, etc. During
the sittings of the monthly land
courts held at Ipswich in the latter
part of the sixties and early part of
the seventies, Mr. Born carried as
much as £3,000 from Messrs. Cribb
and Foote to the courts, to be applied
to the purpose of assisting the
farmers to tide over any difficulties
they experienced in meeting the
rents due. In 1871 he was placed
in charge of the stores and cotton-
ginning factory at Churchbank, and
during the eighties occupied a simi-
lar position at Fernvale, becoming
one of the best-known identities of
the district. For the past half-
century he has been one of the most
prominent workers in the Liberal
cause, either throughout the West
Moreton district or in Ipswich. In
no part of Queensland has ‘ there
been a more consistent worker than
Mr. Jacob Born, and the party
through his arduous efforts, scored
considerably more political triumphs
than defeats. Mr. Jacob Born at all
times, no matter how strenuous the
battle, has always retained the good-
will of both parties. For a quarter
of a century he has been an active
member of the board of management
of the Ipswich General Hospital, is
a member of the Ipswich Chamber of
Commerce, and is also prominent in
the councils of the Queensland Pas-
toral Association. During the flood
disasters of 1890 and 1893 Mr. Born
was untiring in his efforts to render
aid to those in need, travelling for
that purpose on both occasions many
miles throughout the district. For
nearly 50 years he was a teacher in
the local Methodist Sunday school,
and for 44 years has been a consis-
tent visitor to the Ipswich Hospital,
cheering many sufferers by his
attention and sympathy. In 1870
Mr. Born was married to Miss Hew-
lett, sister of Mr. W. FI. Hewlett,
of Ipswich, and of this union there
is a family of five sons and three
daughters.

known as one of its most conscien-
tious, hard-working, and useful citi-
zens, devoting a large amount of
time to the fulfilment of public
duties and exerting considerable in-
fluence in the numerous organiza-
tions of which he was at various
times a member. The late Mr.
Cameron was born on September 13,
1840, at New Amsterdam, Berbice,
British Guiana, South America, his
father being Alexander Cameron,
eldest son of John Cameron, of Glen
Nevis and Ben Nevis, in the high-
lands of Scotland, and his mother a
daughter of Count Matthias von
Rodder, of Bavaria. When nine
years of age the lad was taken to
England, and for the next three or
four years he was busy with his
studies in the Motherland, attending
schools there and in the Island of
Jersey. In August, 1852, he
crossed the Channel to France,
where for nearly two years he was
a student at the well-known St.
Servan College. Returning to Eng-
land he left Gravesend for Australia
by the vessel “Panthea,” and
reached his port of destination,
Moreton Bay, on July 25 of that
year. On the day following his ar-
rival in Brisbane he voyaged up the
river to Ipswich by the Government
steamer “Swallow',” and joining his
uncle, the late D. Cameron, upon
what was then the “Tarampa” pas-
toral run, he continued with this
relative for about a year, gaining a
useful experience of bush life dur-
ing that period. In August, 1855,
he returned to Ipswich, where he
first entered the employ of Messrs.
Panton & Co., at a time when the
city was in its infancy, not even
possessing a school. In 1857 he
transferred his services to Mr. F. A.
Forbes, another merchant of Ips-
wich—afterwards Speaker of the
Legislative Assembly—but in De-
cember, 1859, two years later, he
re-entered the house of Panton and
Co., where he remained until 1864.
In that year, having obtained a good
grip of commercial principles and of
the general conditions of the country
where he had cast in his lot, he
turned his attention to independent
enterprise, and in conjunction with
the late David Hughes, of Newtown,
established the firm of Hughes and
Cameron, general auctioneers, which
with this personnel carried on
operations successfully until the death
of Mr. Hughes in 1875. Mr. Cameron
then admitted into partnership the
late William Salkeld, M.L.A., who
eventually withdrew from the

Mr. Cameron's death, which oc-
curred after a few hours’ illness on
June 29, 1912. The late gentleman
took a keen interest in everythino


pertaining to affairs of local govern-
ment, and his connection with the
public organizations of Ipswich ex-
tended back over a very lengthy
period. For over a score of years
he was a member and for some time
treasurer of the Board of Manage-
ment of the Ipswich General Hos-
pital, which at the time when he
relinquished his office of control was
financially in a very healthy condi-
tion, giving clear evidence of expert
conduct of its receipts and expendi-
ture during the lengthy period that
he had continued in charge of this
department. In 1900 he was re-
turned by a section of the ratepayers
of the Bundamba Shire Council as
representative of No. 3 Division,
which seat he continued to hold,
proving himself a valuable force in
the counsels of that body, and for
a couple of terms effectively carry-
ing out the duties of chairman of
the council, while the office of chair-
man of the finance committee, which
he held for several years before his
demise, gave him the opportunity of
exercising a judicious superintend-
ence over the expenditure. Mr.
Cameron was chosen to represent the
council on various local bodies, not-
ably the old Ipswich Traffic Board
-—of which he was president for
several years—and the Ipswich Joint
Hospital Board, which also elected
him president; an office he occu-
jhed until death cut short his
career. During the later years
of his life he became associated
with the Woody Point Progress As-
sociation, of which he was elected
president, and in this live organiza-
tion he was recognized as one of the
most active members—in whatever
body he accepted membership giving
as much careful thought to its
affairs as though the business under
consideration were his own. In 1866
the late Mr. Cameron married Eliza-
beth, daughter of the late S. P.
Welsby, by whom he had issue four
children — viz., Mr. Pearson Welsby
Cameron; Mr. H. W. Cameron, of
“The Grange,” near Brisbane; Mrs.
Davies, wife of the Rev. James
Davies, of Woodville, South Austra-
lia; and Mrs. G. J. Manson, of
Ipswich. Two brothers and a sister
also survived him—Messrs. A. P.
Cameron and Glen Cameron and Miss
Helen Cameron. The subject of this
article, Mr. Pearson Welsby Came-
ron, was born at Cooneana, near
Ipswich, on May 27, 1870, and re-
ceived his education at the Ipswich
Grammar School. Upon the ter-
mination of his scholastic course, at
17 years of age, he began active life
under the guidance of his father in
the office of Hughes, Cameron, and
Co., at Ipswich, where he gained a
useful experience in the clerical
branch of the business prior to tak-
ing over the chief responsibility in
the practical management of the
auctioneering department, which he
combined with his former duties.
After the demise of his father he
became proprietor of the business,
and has since continued its opera-
tions on his own account with suc-
cessful results. From his very boy-
hood Mr. Cameron has displayed an
unusually keen interest in the public
affairs of the district where he ~was
born and in all events concerning
the welfare of the community at
large. He enjoys the distinction of
having been the youngest member
of the committee of the Queensland
Pastoral and Agricultural Society,
in which body he has held every
office with the sole exception of that
of treasurer since he was first elected
to the committee over a quarter of
a century ago, his membership in
the society dating back several years
prior to his advent upon the board
.of control. He was president of that
body for two years —during 1913
and 1914 —filling the position with
eclat and materially assisting the
society by his mature judgment, his
energetic handling of its affairs, and
his unremitting industry in all
movements for the promotion of its
interests. In 1907, as a result of
some difference of opinion having
occurred among the ratepayers of
the Prassall Shire, Mr. Cameron was
induced to offer himself as a candi-
date for No. 2 Division, and
although then defeated by a small
majority he made very excellent use
of the opportunity afforded him to
show his mettle on this occasion. By
his public utterances he was able to
impress the residents with the fact
that he possessed a thorough and
unusual grasp, not only of local
government generally, but in par-
ticular of the affairs of this shire,
and when about a year later a
vacancy again occurred in the same
ward by the retirement of the sitting
member, and Mr. Cameron renewed
his candidature, the electors gave
convincing proof of the confidence
with which he had inspired them by
returning him to the seat with an
overwhelming majority of votes.
This was in 1908, and he continued
to act as representative for No. 2
Division until his voluntary retire-
ment some years later, after having
in the meantime been re-elected at
the ordinary poll. Subsequent to
this retirement he declined further
responsibility of the kind on account
of the claims made upon his
time by his private business
interests until, upon the decease
of his father, the ratepayers of
Bundamba Shire returned him as
member of the council for the bal-
ance of the late Mr. Cameron’s un-
expired term of office. To this seat
he was re-elected in the following
year (1913) and continued to serve
as a member of this body until 1915,
when he was prevailed upon to ac-
cept the office of alderman in the
Ipswich City Council, and thereupon
severed his connection with the Bun-
damba Council, in conformity with
his opinion that it was inadvisable
to hold a seat on the control of two
adjoining municipal bodies at the
same period. He still continues his
association with the West Ward of
the Ipswich municipality, where he
has made his influence felt among
his fellow aldermen. About 20 years
ago he was appointed a Justice of
the Peace, and still fills his
appointed place upon the Ipswich
bench of magistrates. Always distin-
guished by conspicuous public spirit
and strongly imbued with a sense of
the duty owed by the earnest and
right-minded citizen to his fellow-
men, Mr. Cameron has held a pro-
minent place before the residents of
the district where he resides as one
who never shirks the moral obliga-
tion laid upon his conscience to

was, therefore, a forgone conclusion
that he should have a hand in the
affair's of that admirable institution,
the Ipswich centre of the Queens-
land Ambulance and Transport
Brigade, with which organization he
has been associated since the forma-
tion of the local brigade as an inde-
pendent centre, holding for many
years the office of honorary trea-
surer, which he still retains. He is
chairman of the committee of the
Ipswich Technical College, with
which institution he has been asso-
ciated as a member for very many
years, and represents the Ipswich
Municipal Council upcn that body.
He is also a member of the board of
the Ipswich Fire Brigade. The most
prominent Australian of Scottish
descent in the district, he fittingly
occupies the post of president of the
Caledonian Society and Burns Club,
having filled this chair for several
years. His recreations have partaken
more or less of a general character,
although in earlier years he was an
active participator in those pastimes
in which the horse plays an import-
ant part, specializing in the sport of
EE
polo, in which he was highly effic-
ient, being well known to the players
of that brilliant and risky game all
over Southern Queensland. He is a
valued member of the Ipswich
Orchestral Society, his connection
with this body dating back to the
inception of the society, and during
his long period of membership, from
1901 to the end of 1914, he filled
the office of honorary general
secretary, being very active in the
discharge of his manifold duties, and
by his efforts directing affairs on
very successful lines. He has now
been elected to the office of vice-
president, for which he possesses
every qualification. Although he is
a performer on the organ, he chiefly
favours the ’cello, and is recognized
as a very able exponent of its possi-
bilities. His interests in another
direction are testified by the fact
that he is a vice-president of the
Ipswich Horticultural Society, which
owes him a weighty debt of grati-
tude, inasmuch as he was chiefly in-
strumental in reviving it to renewed
life when its vitality was at a very
low ebb about a decade since. Mr.
Cameron makes a hobby of photo-
graphy, and as in most matters to
which he gives his attention he is
something of an enthusiast in this
sphere of art, and was first presi-
dent and one of the leading spirits
in the Ipswich Amateur Photogra-
phic Society, of which he was a
founder. He married in 1915 Ann
Grauer Dewar, daughter of the late
Peter Brown, a pioneer of Ipswich
and well known as a building con-
tractor of that city, where many old

and historic buildings remain as
monuments to his skill. Mr. Brown
on several occasions occupied the
office of Mayor of Ipswich.

the late James Walsh opened his
offices for the transaction of law
business in 1858 in the same build-
ing where his modern representative
still receives his clients. It was
taken over from Mr. Walsh in 1862
by the late Honourable J. Malbon
Thompson, who carried it on until
1880, in which year the late W. K.
Havard, in partnership with the
late Honorable (afterwards Colonel)
J. F. G. Foxton, assumed control.
Upon the death of Mr. Havard in
1883 the late Pollet Loftus Cardew,
who had previously served his ar-
ticles with the firm, returned from
Dalby, where he had been practising
since the completion of his articles,
and entered into partnership with
the Honorable J. F. G. Foxton,
after which the personnel continued
unchanged until 1896.- From that
date until 1909 Mr. Cardew con-
ducted affairs on his own account,
when a further change took place
by the admission as a member of the
firm of his nephew, Mr. Henry Grcs-
venor Simpson, who since the demise
of the senior partner in 1916 has con-
tinued as sole principal. HENRY
GROSYENOR SIMPSON was born
at Ipswich on May 28, 1876, and is
the only son of the late Henry
Grosvenor Simpson, whose father,
George Morant Simpson, the descend-
ant of an old Yorkshire family, left
England for Australia in 1827, and
settled in New South Wales, where
he followed his profession of public
accountant until his decease in 1865.
His son, the late Mr. H. G. Simp-
son, was born in Sydney in 1841,
and received his education at St.
James’ Church of England School.
Upon the conclusion of his studies
he turned his attention to the pas-
toral industry, first proceeding to
Bathurst, where he was with his
uncle, the late William Sutor, for a
time, afterwards residing in the
Forbes district. He came to Queens-
land in 1870 to take over the
management of “Pilton” Station,
on the Darling Downs, and in 1872
purchased “Bellevue” Station, in
the Ipswich district, which he sold
in 1893. Subsequently he was

manager of “Undullah,” in the
Logan district, going thence to
“Clifton/’ on the Downs, and later
taking charge of other properties.
Mr. Simpson died at Ipswich on
November 9, 1913. His son,
Mr. H. G. Simpson, received
his education at the Ipswich
and Brisbane Grammar Schools,
and in March, 1893, began his law
studies, being articled first to the
late Colonel Foxton, and completing
his indentures with the late Mr.
P. L. Cardew, of the same
firm. He was admitted as a soli-
citor in 1899, and ten years later
became a partner in the firm, with
which he had been connected
throughout the whole of this period.
Upon Mr. Cardew’s death he took
up the full practice on his own be-
half, and has since continued under
the old style of P. L. Cardew and
Simpson. As a native of Ipswich,
Mr. Simpson has always been pro-
minent in all movements by which
the advancement of the community
might be promoted, and he has held
many important official positions of
an honorary nature. For a decade
past he has served on the council of
the Queensland Pastoral and Agri-
cultural Association, and he is a
committeeman of the School of Arts,
with which he has been connected
for several vears. He has occupied
a seat on the Hospital Board for
some considerable time, and is a
director of the Ipswich Building
Society. He is a strong advocate
for clean and manly sport, having
in his younger days played football
and tennis a good deal, golf being
his favourite recreation at the pre-
sent time.
The late POLLET LOFTUS
CARDEW, was a son of the late
Pollet Cardew, whose father, the
Rev. John Haydon Cardew, was
rector of Curry Malet, Somerset,
England. Pollet Cardew, who was
born at the latter place in the year
1817, left his native land for
Whitehead , Ipswich.
MR. POLLET LOFTUS CARDEW.
Australia in 1845, landing at Svd-
ney, and later, extending his travels
to Queensland, became engaged in
pastoral operations in the Burnett,
Dawson, and Ipswich districts. After


separation of the northern colony
from New South Wales took place
in 1859, he was offered a seat in the
Legislative Council, which, however,
he felt himself compelled to decline
on account of pressure on his time
of private interests. He did good
service in the capacity of police
magistrate at Charleville, Stan-
thorpe, and elsewhere, between the
years 1868 and 1888, and proved
himself a worthy citizen of his
adopted country. His death oc-
curred at Stanthorpe on September
12, 1900. His son, the subject of
this article, was born at “Mount
Flinders’’ Station, near Ipswich, on
January 18, 1856, and received his
education at the Ipswich Grammar
School. In 1874 he was articled to
the legal profession under the late
Honourable J. Malbon Thompson,
and was admitted as a solicitor
on April 6, 1880. After prac-
tising for a short time at Dalby
he settled down to the practice of
his profession at Ipswich, where he
first formed a partnership with the
late Honourable J. F. G. Foxton,
which existed from 1881 to 1898.
After severing this connection he
continued the Ipswich branch alone
until 1915, when he took Mr. H. G.
Simpson into partnership, and the
firm thus constituted carried on right
up to the time of his death—the
latter event occurring at Brisbane
on May 30, 1916. The late gentle-
man was prominently associated with
the public life of the town, and
there were few institutions for the
promotion of the general advance-
ment of its welfare which could not
claim him as a member. For a num-
ber of years he was president of the
Ipswich Hospital, and also rendered
valuable service to the same institu-
tion as a committeeman. He held a
position on the directorate of a num-
ber of mercantile companies, among
which may be mentioned the Queens-
land Woollen Company, Limited,
the Ipswich Gas Company, Limited,
and the Ipswich and West Moreton
Building Society. For upwards of
12 years he was one of the directors
of the Australian Mutual Provident
Society in Queensland. He was
chairman of the Royal Bank of
Queensland for a term, and a mem-
ber of the board of directors of this
institution for a number of years.
He was also one of the committee of
the Queensland Pastoral Associa-
tion. Upon several occasions he was
invited to stand for Parliamentary
honours, but always declined to
allow himself to be nominated. In
early life he was interested in mili-
tary matters, holding rank as cap-
tain of the Mounted Infantry, and
it is interesting to note that the late
Colonel W. T. Deacon served as
lieutenant under his command. He
was enthusiastic in regard to out-
door recreation, and cordially identi-
fied himself with the various sport-
ing bodies of the town and district,
having been a patron of the Ipswich
Bowling Club from its inception and
a member of the local polo team, in
which sport the team made its mark
as champion for Queensland many
years ago. He was also one of the
trustees of Bundamba racecourse for
a number of years. Mr. Cardew had
strong religious principles, and was
a staunch adherent of the Anglican
Church, serving for many years as
warden of St. Paul’s, Ipswich. He
married in 1882 Miss Victoria Per-
rier, and of this union were born
one son and two daughters. His
death came as a great shock to his
numerous friends in Queensland,
and by this event Ipswich lost a
foremost citizen and one of the best-
known and most highly-esteemed
men in the whole of the district.
G. R. WILSON, J.P., of Ips-
wich, was born on August 21, 1852,
and is a son of the late George Har-
rison Wilson, who crossed the At-
lantic from England in his youth
and settled in Newfoundland, where
after about 10 years’ residence he
had the misfortune to lose his pos-
sessions in a disastrous fire. At this
time Australia was a much-talked-of
region among the dwellers of the
Northern Hemisphere, and George
Harrison Wilson determined to try
his fortune in the land of the
Southern Cross. Accordingly, with
his wife and five children, he took
passage by the old historic vessel,
the “James Clark,” and after a
five months’ voyage landed at Syd-
ney, where he formed a partnership
with the late H. E. Tidswell and
established a general merchants’
business in Clarence Street, under
the style of Tidswell, Wilson, & Co.
Having seen this concern launched
on thoroughly successful lines, Mr.
Wilson conceived the scheme of ex-
tending his operations, and with
this purpose in view came to Queens-
land in September, 1853, shortly
after his arrival founding in Ips-
wich the business of G. H. Wilson
and Co. Its transactions prospered
from the first, and for over 40 years,
under the persona] conduct of the
founder, it continued to make good
the promise of its early days, attain-
ing a very prominent position among
the commercial enterprises of the
city and holding its own as an im-
portant landmark of the pioneer
days of Ipswich. Upon the demise
of the late George Harrison Wilson
in 1899 the city was deprived of one
of its most respected and useful citi-
zens, whose progressive spirit had
been an important factor in the
advancement of the district, and
who had always made his influence
felt on the side of right. Keenly
interested in public affairs, the
cause of education and religion alike
commanded his warmest support,
and he played a leading part in the
foundation of the Ipswich Grammar
School, of which he was a trustee,

HARRY FERRETT, J.P.,
“Armley,” Brisbane Road, East
Ipswich, was born at “Wallann”
Station, on the Condamine River,
Queensland, on January 23, 1856,
and is a son of the late Harry Fer-
rett, a younger brother of the late
John Ferrett, who made his appear-
ance in Legislative circles in Queens-
land in the late fifties, and for up-
wards of a quarter of a century re-
presented Maranoa .and West More-
ton successively in the Legislative
Assembly. The Ferrett family came
originally from Dorsetshire, Eng-
land, where for many generations
its members have been well known,
being closely associated with the
various phases of life in that part
of the country, and taking a pro-
minent place in the affairs of the
Anglican Church. Records made in
the annals of the time are still
extant showing the good standing
of the Ferretts as members of the
Established communion, and in all
ether departments of social service
in which they were engaged, and as
staunch yeoman citizens of the most
reliable type they commanded the
respect and honour of all their
compatriots. The late John Ferrett
came to Australia by the ship
“Fairlie,” arriving at Sydney in the

year 1838, with but limited capital
but with a heart full of courage and
resolve to make his tilt at fortune,
and, incidentally to do his part
in the building up of the British
Empire in this remote region. Almost
immediately he entered the employ
of the Dangar family, on their sta-
tion properties at Gostwyck Plains,
where he devoted all his energies to
obtaining a good grip of the many
details of the pastoral industry. A
few .years later, having possessed
himself of a good knowledge of stock,
he launched out on his own account,
founding the old “Wallann” Sta-
tion, a property which since lias been
subdivided for purposes of closer
settlement, and of which as a whole
only a few records of historic and
sentimental value remain. Wallan
Creek (note the drop of the final
“n”), on the Western line, is situ-
ated at about the centre of the old
property where Mr. Harry Ferrett
was born, the homestead of the
period, which was the scene of this
event, being herewith reproduced.
The late John Ferrett subsequently
became a candidate for political
honours, and was returned as repre-
sentative for Maranoa district, in
which capacity he achieved his repu-
tation as a picturesque personality

Ferrett, appearing in the old
Queensland Guardian newspaper in
1862, may be quoted from in order
to convey some idea of the “Man of
Maranoa,” as he is wittily styled by
the versatile writer of a series of
such articles, who selected him as
“possessing no everyday physio-
gnomy” to figure among 16 eub-
jects for word-portraiture chosen
from the Legislative Assembly of
the day. “The Man or Maranoa,
John Ferrett, Esq.,” the descrip-
tion begins, “is a feature of the
House of Assembly; even at St.
Stephen’s he would be a man of
note. Lord Palmerston could not
fail richly to enjoy the peculiarities
of the honourable gentleman’s style
of eloquence; and even if the Fourth
Estate endeavoured to ignore him
he could not be altogether unknown
to fame. . . . One of the great
merits of our Maranoan Tully is his
originality. Not content with the
title of parens patrice, which has
been unanimously assigned to him,

and the very mention of Maranoa
finds him eager and ready for the
fray. But he has higher ends in
view than the establishment of a
patrol or the building of a bridge.
The ills that the flesh of man is heir
to excite his tenderest sympathies,
and he sheds on the Medical Bill the
light of his knowledge and experi-
ence. He goes heart and soul into
the questions brought before the
Native Police Committee, and
strikes out the great idea of iron
collars for the blacks. Time and
space would fail to particularize the
many instances in which his Midas
touch has turned the most unpromis-
ing materials into gold. It matters
little at what length a subject may
have been discussed, or how thread-
bare it may seem, the rising form of
the Man of Maranoa is always an
intimation that some fresh light is
to be thrown upon it. Mr.
Ferrett is as original in the manner
as in the matter of his speech.
His language is plain and
matter-of-fact, enlivened, however,
with much sly drollery and an im-
perturbable good humour.

dom omits the name of Mr. Ferrett,
and in committee work he does not
spare himself.” By way of conclu-
sion, the article continues: —‘‘There

the world than our little Maranoan,
and some who discharge their legis-
lative functions with less honour.
There is not an atom of harm in

Ferrett will be, at the end of a long
career, to say, ‘To the best of the
light that was in me and power
given I have endeavoured to do my
duty.’ Would we could all make
the same affirmation.” Not long
after the late John Ferrett had es-
tablished himself on “Wallann”
Station, he sent for his brother
Harry, father of the present Harry
Ferrett, and the two brothers to-
gether carried on operations at the
station until the death of the
younger man, who lost his life while
attempting to cross the flooded Con-
damine River in the year 1860,
whilst returning with his. bullock
team from a trip for supplies, which
had to be brought from the coast
to what was then a region of the
‘‘Never Never” country. After the
demise of the late Harry Ferrett,
his widow and two children —the
elder of whom, a daughter, was born
in England—remained for some
years on ‘‘Wallann” Station with
their relative, John Ferrett, who
proved himself a considerate and
generous 'friend to the bereaved
family. Eventually the widow mar-
ried a Mr. Hollamby, and with her
husband and children came to re-
side at Ipswich in the year 1864.
The subject of this notice, then a
lad of eight, received his primary
education at a public school in Ips-
wich, completing his scholastic
career at that historic and successful
institution, the Ipswich Grammar
School. At the close of his school-
days, at 17 years of age, he entered
upon office duties, but soon found
the cramped indoor life unsuited to
his tastes, and, returning to his
uncle’s station, applied himself to
mastering all details connected with
the pastoral industry. He continued
on the station in all for about 22
years, when it passed out of the
possession of the late John lerrett,
transferring his services to the suc-
cessor of that gentleman, the late E.
A. Gaden, for whom he acted more
or less in a managerial capacity for
14 years. When the death of the
late John Ferrett occurred in 1894
Mr. Harry Ferrett relinquished his
connection with pastoral pursuits in
order to attend to affairs connected
with the estate of the deceased
gentleman, and after the settlement
had been satisfactorily effected he
settled down to permanent residence
in Ipswich, where he has made his
home ever since. Since retiring into
private life Mr. Ferrett has come
prominently into touch with the
various organizations having as their
object the advancement of the dis-
trict, and although possessed of con-
siderable disinclination to figure as
a public man, he has never shirked
any duty or personal sacrifice that
he felt was required of him to the
achievement of any worthy end. His
name has been associated with many
of the progressive movements of his
time, and as occasion demanded he
has accepted the responsibility of
office on behalf of his fellow-citizens
for the carrying out of law and
order in the district where all his
interests lie. For over a decade he
has exercised the Commission of the
Peace, to which he was appointed by
the Liberal Government then in
power, and he has always been a
strenuous worker in the Liberal
cause since he first assisted in the
return of the late Sir Hugh Nelson
to Parliament many years ago.
Shortly after he began his settled
residence in Ipswich, Mr. Ferrett
was approached by the ratepayers
of East Ward with the request that
he should allow himself to be nomin-
ated to represent them on the town
council. Having been duly returned,
he bestirred himself so vigorously in
the interests of his ward that he
aroused the opposition of the party
chiefly concerned in vested interests,
with the result that on the occasion
of the ensuing election their influ-
ence was directed against him, and


he failed to secure a majority of
votes. He served as a member of
the Bundamba Shire Council for 19
years, and for several terms
filled the office of chairman
of this body, at one period
retaining the post for three
successive years. During his
lengthy service as a shire
councillor, in which a con-
siderable proportion of the
best years of his life has
been spent, he proved him-
self a moving spirit in the
affairs dealt with by this
body, esteeming no effort
too great if the desired end
might be attained, and much
of the useful work carried
out at that time may be said
to stand as a monument to
his unflagging enthusiasm
and industry in the public
cause. For a number of
years he was deeply inter-
ested in the coal-mining
industry, expending no

Upon his removal to
East Ipswich he trans-

activities to that
neighbourhood, and
has since evinced an
equally earnest spirit
in the discharge of his
office of people’s war-
den, and also in that

he filled for some
years. Mr. Ferrett

20, 1897, to Annie

FREDERICK GOLEBY, J.P.,
Ipswich, is a native of England, hav-
ing been born at Brundsish, Suffolk,
on March 19, 1859, from which place
his father, the late James Goleby,
emigrated to Queensland in the year
1865, with his wife and family of
four young children. The late
gentleman after arrival obtained em-
ployment from the Government of
MR. JAMES GOLEBY.
the day in railway construction
work, and continued in this service
until his career was cut short by
death after the completion of 30
years’ faithful labour in this branch
of public enterprise, in which he
played a worthy part and one not
lightly to be estimated from the
point of view of development of the
country. A generous meed of praise
should be accorded to these excellent
workers for the general weal, who
toiled on uncomplainingly, unre-
warded by any of those advantages
enjoyed so much as a matter of
course by those who reap the results
of their labours at the present time.
By the late Mr. Goleby’s death in
1891 the State was deprived of one
of the most efficient railway inspec-
tors ever appointed in that capacity
in Queensland, but he left to the
country a valuable heritage in the
persons of his six sons and four
daughters, all of whom have worthily
upheld the name and honour of the
founder of their family under Aus-
tral skies. Mr. Frederick Goleby re-
ceived his education at the local
schools of Ipswich, and at the age
of 13 was apprenticed to the saddlery
and leather trade under the late
Alexander Morrison, of Toowoomba,
with whom he remained for four
years. Upon the completion of his
apprenticeship Mr. Goleby made
independent plans to gain experi-
ence, not alone along the avenues of
his trade, but in relation to the
general conditions of the country
in which he expected to settle
down for the remainder of his
life. Accordingly he penetrated fur-
ther inland, travelling among the
outback stations in the western dis-
tricts, where he paid particular at-
tention to gaining a thorough know-
ledge of the requirements of the
pastoral community for articles in
his particular line of trade. Having
succeeded in obtaining a good grip
of the general situation in these
parts, and justified his enterprise in
making the trip, by the acquisition
of personal friends and of future cus-
tomers in this remote region, in 1881
Mr. Goleby returned nearer to the
hub of things, and settling down in
Ipswich made his tilt for fortune by
establishing himself in business on
his own account in that town,
shortly after celebrating his twenty-
first birthday. His youth was
against him, and some very bitter
and disappointing experiences fell to
his lot at the outset of his venture,
but gaining courage and standing
with maturer years he gradually
surmounted all difficulties and in
time won his way to the front rank
of business men in the town, and
his premises now form one of the
landmarks of Ipswich, having from
time to time been extended from
the modest beginning of some 35
years ago to their present consider-
able proportions. The fine large
structure which greets the eye in a
peregrination through Brisbane St.
was erected by Mr. Goleby in 1914,
and in its up-to-date style and
modern appointments it heralds the
full awakening of the city to a realiz-
ation of the advantages of coming
into line with twentieth century
ideas in respect to commercial archi-
tecture. The connection commanded
by the business has steadily grown,
and now extends not only over the
whole of the West Moreton, Darling
Downs, and Stanley districts, but
also much farther afield, Mr.
Goleby’s reputation for straight
dealing and the quality of work-
manship exhibited by his staff
being thoroughly well known over
a very wide radius. From the very
earliest days of his residence in
Ipswich, Mr. Goleby has taken a
serious view of the responsibilities
of citizenship, and has been promi-
nently connected with all movements
for the betterment of the com-
munity at large, giving freely of his
time and money to the sacred cause
of charity, and also to the advance-
ment of the interests of the youthful
portion of the population. In early
manhood, before the more important
duties of life began to absorb his
attention to the exclusion of what

was merety pleasurable, he freely
yielded himself to the attractions of
outdoor recreation, making a deter-
mined stand for clean principles in
any form of sport to which he ac-
corded his patronage, and since the
weightier matters of the public wel-
fare have made a successful bid for
his personal co-operation this same
spirit of integrity has actuated him


in the performance of bis duties in
a more important sphere. Tie was

nine years, in 1906 being honoured
by election to the mayoral chair.
He was the leading spirit in the
foundation of the Ipswich Chamber
of Commerce, and
enjoyed the distinc-
tion of being first
president of that body.
In 1900 he was elected
a member of the com-
mittee of the Ipswich
General Hospital, and
has retained that office
ever since, filling the
position of treasurer
for two years, and
occupying the presi-
dential office in 1916.
He is also a committee-
man of the Technical
College of Ipswich,
which seat he has held
for a decade, and has
served as chairman of
this important body.
For 12 years he has
been connected with
the local Cemetery
Board, for some con-
siderable time filling
the role of chairman. A staunch
adherent of the Protestant Epis-
copalian Church, he is regarded
as one of the pillars of the local

a number of years has discharged
the duties of warden very efficiently,
while he ever holds himself ready to

ried in 1881 to Ellen, daughter of
the late Thomas King, a pioneer of
the late sixties, who came from
Gloucestershire to Moreton Bay by
the sailing vessel “Bayswater” and
subsequently was associated for
many years with the railway depart-
ment of the Government service, in
which he enjoyed a well-deserved
popularity. Upon his retirement
Mr. Thomas King took up his resi-
dence in Ipswich, and at 70 years of
age, whilst absent on a trip to Eng-
land, died at Exeter, in Devonshire,
where he is buried. Of the union
there are two sons and two daugh-
ters, of whom the former, Messrs.
Thomas James Arthur Goleby and
Frederick John Goleby, being asso-
ciated in the business with their
father on terms of partnership, are
taking an active part in the prac-

JAMES PARKER BOTTOM-
LEY. J.P., Grey Street, Ipswich,
is an Englishman who, over 30
years ago—-in 1884—left his home at
Whitehead, Ipswich.
MR. JAMES PARKER BOTTOMLEY.
Bradford, in Yorkshire, where his
forbears, a sturdy line of men, had
been prominent in farming and
meat-purveying circles. The youngest
his teens, he naturally turned to
pursuits with which he was familiar,
finding employment on the staff of
Messrs. Watson Bros., of Ipswich.
The conditions of commercial life at
that early period were rather severe,
demanding plenty of grit and a good
physique to stand the strain. The
hours were long, frequently extend-
ing from 4.30 o’clock in the morn-
ing until 7 at night. Nevertheless
o o
the young Britisher continued at
his post and spent three years with
this well-known firm, during which
time he obtained considerable know-
ledge and experience of a necessary
character, which stood him in good
stead ill his subsequent career. Leav-
ing Messrs. Watson Bros., he en-
tered into partnership with another
man in a small business at Black-
stone, subsequently selling out his
interests there and establishing a
similar concern on his own account
at Bundamba. His success in this
venture laid the foundation for
future prosperity, but after carry-
ing on here with good results for
four years he was one of the suffer-
ers by the disastrous flood of 1893,
being washed out of house and home
three times within a fortnight in
this ever-memorable season, when so
many others had a like experience.
Shortly afterwards he admitted into

is still associated with him, the firm
carrying on business under the name
of J. P. Bottomley & Co., and with
industry, taking up land in the
Burnett and Western districts.
Messrs. Bottomley & Co. still retain
their interests in the latter areas.


Mr, Bottomley was created a Justice
of the Peace in the late nineties,
and has found scope for his public
activities in various other channels,
filling the position cf member of the
Purga Shire Council for nine years,
during four of which he occupied
the chair, and serving for two years
as alderman for the West Ward of
the Ipswich City Council. He was
president of the Queensland Pas-
toral and Agricultural Society for
four years, and still retains his seat
on the council of that influential
body. He is president of the Ips-
wich Chamber of Commerce, with
which institution he has been asso-
ciated from its inception, and he
was one of the founders of the Ips-
wich and West Moreton Mutual Ac-
cident Insurance Company, which
flourished for a considerable time,
and had the reputation of being one
cf the most successful examples of
co-operation in Australia. His in-
terests also have extended to the
field of sport, and he is the present
president of the Ipswich Bowling
Club, finding his own recreation in
this favourite pastime. Mr. Bot-
tomley was married in 1887 to Isa-
bella Louisa, daughter of the late

were educated locally at the Gram-
mar School, are all liberally
endowed with the patriotic spirit,
and since the outbreak of the Euro-

MR. VOCTOR HAROLD BOTTOMLEY.
A.1.F., prior to taking which step,
as a lieutenant of the senior cadets,
he devoted a good deal of time to
military matters in the Ipswich dis-
trict. The second, Albert Edgar Bot-
tomley, was a sergeant in the Citi-
zens’ Forces (1 Ith Darling Downs In-
fantry), and was called upon by the
military authorities to serve on the
instructional staff after the outbreak
of war. He has since made every
effort to obtain permission to pro-
ceed to the front, but by the ruling
of the military orders has had per-
force to remain at his post in
Queensland, and for nearly two
years has discharged the duties of
staff sergeant-major at the Enoggera
Camp. Victor Harold Bottomley,
the youngest son (born in 1897), at
the termination of his scholastic
course, entered upon business pur-
suits under the guidance of his
father, with whom he was so asso-
ciated for some years. When the
call came for men to enlist, despite
his youth, he offered himself for
active service, but falling short of
the standard fixed by the authori-
ties, was rejected. After a lapse of
time he again presented himself for
enlistment, once more to be refused
on the score of his youth and conse-
quent lack of robustness. Fixed in
his determination to devote his ser-
vices to his king and country, and
spurred by the example of his com-
panions, many of whom already
were in the firing-line, he undertook
a course of physical training and
made such excellent progress that
he was accepted as a member of the
A.1.F., and at the end of the year
1915 found himself on his way to
the scene of hostilities. He saw
active service in France, and was
seriously wounded in his first fight,
while taking part in a trench raid
at Fleurbaix, subsequently being in-
valided to England.
DANIEL SHINE, J.P., Bris-
bane Street, Ipswich. This well-
known and highly-respected pioneer
hailed originally from County Cork,
Ireland, where he was born in the
year 1847, and made his first advent
to Moreton Bay on August 15, 1864.
He voyaged from the Old Country
by the Blackwall ship “Fusilier,”
under command of Captain David
Carvosso, this being the boat which
brought the first instalment of iron-
work and other material necessary
for the construction of the first sec-
tion of the Queensland railways, in
the above-mentioned year. Mr.
Shine had learned the trade of a
wheelwright in the Old Country,
and shortly after his arrival in
Queensland he secured work in con-
nection with the erection of the
Mihi Creek railway bridge. Upon
the completion of this contract he
accepted further employment on the
erection of the bridge across the
Three-Mile Creek, which, in the
early days, was regarded as one of
the most dangerous and difficult
crossing-places between the towns of
Ipswich and Dalby. Whilst en-
gaged in squaring timber for “Mur-
phy’s Bridge,” Mr. Shine met with
a serious accident, caused by the
head of an axe, which was being
used by his mate, flying off and
striking him on the temple. He
was carried in a state of un-
consciousness to Ipswich, where
through the good offices of the late
Dr. K. I. O’Doherty (then resident
in the district), he was gradually
restored to convalescence. Later
Mr. Shine, in conjunction with
the late Martin Beavis, under-
took a big contract of fencing on
“Buaraba” Station, then the pro-
perty of the late Sir Joshua Peter
Bell, which extended over several
years, during which period he ob-
tained bis first experience as a
shearer, acting in this capacity on
“Buaraba” and “Cooyar” Stations


when the shearing seasons came
round. Mr. Shine won the reputa-
tion of being a first-class fencing
hand, and was employed by the late
Sir ,T. T. Bell on “Buaraba” con-
tinuously from 1865 to 1869, re-
linquishing this connection in the
latter year to establish himself as a
general storekeeper in Ipswich,
although when shearing-time ap-
proached, and the vision of a sub-
stantial cheque floatad before him,
lie usually took leave of absence
from his commercial ties, and
found his way to the old haunts,
once more to wield the blades with
dexterous hand. From a mcdest be-
ginning in Ipswich, Mr. Shine in
course of time found his business
increasing so considerably that
larger premises became a matter of
necessity, and accordingly he secured
a store nearer to the centre of the
city, from which he was dislodged
some time later on account of fire
breaking out and destroying the
building. From there he removed to
his present site in Brisbane Street,
where he has continued to carry on
operations successfully ever since.
In addition to his storekeeping in-
terests, Mr. Shine is also engaged
in the farming industry, being the
owner of “Lucerne Park,” Fernvale,
one of the finest agricultural proper-
ties in the West Moreton district.
He takes considerable interest in the
public affairs of the district, and
industrial enterprise by lending his
influence towards the establishment
of the Ipswich Woollen Factory, of
which he was one of the first pro-
visional directors. Mr. Shine and

MR. DANIEL SHINE.
Mr. W. E. Hargreaves are the only
surviving members of this earliest
directorate, which was formed with
29 members in 1874. In various
other ways Mr. Shine has shown an
active concern in the advancement
of the Volunteer Kifle Brigade, hav-
ing been present at the first big
demonstration of the Volunteer
force, held in Toowoomba in 1875.
In his younger days, in Ireland, he
was a smart athlete, and especially
excelled in running and jumping,
which were his favourite pastimes.
Since coming to Queensland he lias
achieved an excellent reputation as
a good all-round sportsman, and is
the owner of several first-class per-
formers, among which may be speci-
ally mentioned “Traveller,” a well-
known winner of many events in the
late nineties; “Saintly Princess,”
by “Galgreina”—“Holy Princess,”
which mare was purchased by Mr.
Shine when in Ireland. To stats
that “Galgreina” is by “Gallinule”
is a sufficient guarantee of her pos-
sibilities to those best able to judge
in regard to these matters. Mr.
Shine married in 1869 Miss Healy,
a native of County Kilkenny, Ire-
land, who arrived in Queensland in
1864 by the “Castle Eden,” experi-
encing a very rough trip, the vessel
losing all her masts in a fearful
storm, during which the ship was
struck by lightning, and had to be
jury-rigged, in which condition she
arrived at her destination. Much
credit is due to Mrs. Shine for the
whole-hearted and devoted manner
in which she has done everything in
her power to further her husband’s
interests, proving herself a true

acted on the board of management
of the Ipswich Hospital, and be has
also done his share in assisting
of worthy enterprise in the city,
He has also given a portion of
his leisure to military affairs, and
for over five years in the seventies
was associated with No. 2 Company

word. The worthy couple have a
family of three sons and three
daughters, and in 1912, with their
youngest daughter, Miss Kate


Shine, they left Queensland for a
pleasure trip to the United King-
dom, seeing something of the various
Asiatic and European ports of call,
and especially enjoying their visit
to Ireland, where they visited their
relatives in Cork and Kilkenny,
finding much to interest them since
their departure from the land of
their birth nearly 50 years before.
MAJOR WILLIAM JOHN
CLATWORTHY, V.D., “Sand-
hurst,” Ebbw Yale, was born on
August 30, 1863, in North Devon,
England, being the eldest son of the
late George Clatworthy, a well-
known resident of that county. He
received his education in his native
town, and upon the termination of
his scholastic studies was employed
as a teacher for 12 months, subse-
quently serving a term of appren-
ticeship to the building trade, in
the course of which he assisted at
the restoration of Filleigh Church,
an event which stands out in his
memory on account of the interest
attached to such a piece of work.
At 19 he left his native land by the
sailing barque “Zamora,” arriving
at Cape Moreton, after an adventur-
ous voyage extending over nearly
accepted employment of various
kinds during the earlier months of
his sojourn in the new country,
eventually establishing himself as a
contractor in Brisbane. In 1885 he

received the appointment of mana-
ger of the Brisbane depot in con-
nection with the Queensland Brick
and Tile Company, which he re-
tained until the company went into
Virginia Brick Company, ojoerating
at Virginia, North Coast line. In 1911
the Virginia Company was reformed
with additional capital and named
the Enoggera and Virginia Bricks
and Pipes, Limited, and a new
works was designed and erected at
Alderly by Major Clatworthy, who
personally controlled affairs in the
dual capacity of manager and engi-
neer until 1914. In that year he
accepted the position of manager
and engineer to the Ebbw Vale
Brick Company, Limited, and the
works under his expert supervision
have been remodelled, with new
machinery and plant, in order to
cope with the increasing demands of
the trade, a specialty being made of
sanitary pipes and appliances and
electrical conduits. Having a keen
predilection for military matters
and a desire to fit himself for the
defence of his adopted country
should occasion arise, in 1889 Major
Clatworthy availed himself of an
opportunity to join the Queensland
Volunteer Rifles, in which corps he
remained until 1894, having at-
tained the rank of colour-sergeant.
He applied for and received his first
commission in the Ist Queenslanders

rose to his present rank of Major,

gaining initial experience of the new
conditions under which henceforth
he would be pursuing his trade, he
liquidation some eight years later.
In conjunction with several others,
Major Clatworthy floated a new
concern under the style of the
commanding the 9th Regiment for
two years. Upon the occasion of the
late Lord Kitchener’s visit to Aus-
tralia in 1911 he was presented with


the long service medal at the hands
of that eminent soldier, and in 1913
he was one of five to receive the
Victoria Decoration during the
regime of the then Governor of
Queensland, Sir William McGregor.
Major Clatworthy is a member of
the United Service Institute and
acts on the committee of that insti-
tution. He is a Past Master of the
Sandgate Masonic Ledge, No. 2670.
He married as his first wife a daugh-
ter of Mr. Thomas Tyzer, of Bir-
mingham, England, who died in
1909, leaving two daughters. Sub-
sequently Major Clatworthy es-
poused Annie, daughter of the late
Thomas Lawless, a well-known pro-
duce merchant of Brisbane, and of
this union there are two sons and
one daughter.

with his wife and family at Cape
Town, there securing a Government
appointment as superintendent of a
benevolent institution, which post he
retained until his departure for
Queensland some years later. After
arrival in this State, Mr. Woodford,
sen., in order to obtain the benefits
of an open-air life, turned his atten-
tion to market gardening in the
vicinity of Ipswich; but subse-
quently, on account of failing health,
he retired from active pursuits and
passed away in 1905, after complet-
ing over 20 years of useful life in
the land of his adoption. He was
survived by a widow, two daughters,
and five sons, all of the latter being
settled in Queensland, where the
fortunes of the family were pioneered
by his eldest son, the gentleman
under review. Mr. Alfred John
Harry Woodford received his educa-
tion on the Isle of Wight, in which
part of the United Kingdom his
parents resided during his boyhood
years. At 14 he was apprenticed
to the carpentering trade at Ryde,
and having completed his indentures
gave serious consideration to the
prospects offered him by the Old
Country in the way of advancement.
His progressive spirit refused to be
satisfied with the probable scope for
his activities which this survey
showed him was all he could reason-
ably expect. Combining a roving
disposition with this faculty for push,
he brought his powers of persuasion
to bear upon his parents with such
success that early in 1881 the whole
family made their exodus from the
British Isles to South Africa, as
already written. Mr. A. J. H.
Wcodford here followed his trade as
a carpenter, obtaining employment
from the Government on the con-
struction of the railway line to Kim-
berley, and was engaged in this
work until 1884, when he returned
to England with his mother and
other members of the family, whose
constitutions had suffered as a result
of continued residence in a place
where the climate had proved un-
suitable to their health. Six months
of life in his native land, however,
sufficed to prove to him conclusively
that the conditions there were not
of a nature to allow of the expan-
sion which, with mature years, ap-
pealed to him as an imperative
necessity in whatever walk of life he
might elect to earn a livelihood.
About this time, hearing good re-
ports of Queensland, in the far-off
continent of the Austral seas, he
decided to test for himself the

reached him, and accordingly set
his face towards the land of the
Southern Cross. Mr. Woodford ar-
rived at Moreton Bay in February,
1885, by the ship “New Guinea,” on
her first voyage to Queensland, and
shortly after landing he proceeded
to Ipswich, with only a few pounds
in his pocket by way of capital,
which he soon increased by working
for wages, his first employer being
Mr. A. Macgregor, an old identity
of the inland town. During the
brief period, about two years, which
intervened after the arrival of Mr.
Woodford until he was joined by his
father, the young man by dint of
ability and industry, combined with
a passion for fair dealing and up-
right conduct, had achieved a suc-
cess that reflected the greatest pos-
sible credit upon his character and
methods, and justified him in induc-
ing Mr. Woodford, sen., and subse-
quently the other members of the
family to follow him to Australia.
He continued to serve a succession of
masters, carefully husbanding his
earnings until 1891, when he found


himself in a position to start on his
own account as a contractor and
builder, and almost from the first
met with so marked a success
that at the time of writing
he has attained a position in
the front rank of those following
this calling in Southern Queensland.
In 1900 he completed the erection
of the Technical College at Ipswich,
and some other important Govern-
ment undertakings have been in-
eluded among his contracts. The

associations of his younger days, and
viewing with considerable interest
the historical battlefields of the
Boer War, as well as the towns and
cities made memorable by being the
scenes of incidents in the various
campaigns. Whilst in England he
was able to convince many persons
of the advantages to be gained by
settlement in Queensland, with the

buildings in Brisbane and Bell

Woodford’s ability, and the position
he holds among those of his craft,
this contract being one which ran
into figures approaching £30,000.
In 1905 he again revisited his native
land, and took the opportunity dur-
ing the course of his travels to make
himself conversant with the vari-
ous improvements and up-to-date
methods introduced by experts in

100 souls to make their homes in
this State—all of whom have proved
themselves worthy citizens, adding
considerably to the wealth of their
adopted country. Upon his return
to Queensland he resumed his busi-
ness with renewed vigour, and bring-
ing to bear upon his work the wider
experience of modern methods ob-
tained during his trip abroad, he
may be said to have registered even
greater successes than previously.

president. He was one of the
founders of the Royal Society of St.

honorary treasurer to this organiza-
tion for some considerable time. He
is also a warden of the Church of
England, of which communion he
has been an adherent since his
youth. Mr. Woodford was married
in 1886 to Margaret Jane, daughter
of Mr. John Laidlaw, an old resi-
dent of this State, and has a family
of five sons and two daughters.

father, who had decided that he
would make a builder of the lad,
and took some pains to instruct

youth, has stood Mr. Williams in
such good stead during his subse-

Mr. Williams, as upon so many
clever craftsmen of his day, that the
conditions controlling the life of the
worker in the Old Country were
needlessly restricted, and that in

secured an engagement to build the

from active pursuits in 1910. In
addition to his other ventures, Mr.
Williams, over 40 years ago, selected
land in the Karlin district, upon
which he took up his abode and


engaged in agricultural pursuits. He
is the pioneer of the Gregor Creek
country, in which district he still
retains landed interests. In 1904,
accompanied by his wife and one of
his sons, he revisited England, and
shortly after his retirement in 1910,
he indulged himself in another well-
earned trip, but had the misfortune
to take his passage by the “Peri-
cles,” which vessel was wrecked on
the Western Australian coast. Hav-
ing but little leisure during his
business life, Mr. AVilliams refrained
from taking a prominent part in
public affairs until after his retire-
ment, but he always took a cordial
interest in the welfare of the dis-
trict. Eventually, finding himself a
man of leisure, and being approached
by the ratepayers, he accepted
their request to take office in
place of the late Alderman
Stephenson, and he has since served
in this capacity. He is a staunch be-
liever in the doctrines of the Re-
formation, and has held membership
in the Protestant Alliance for be-
tween 30 and 40 years. Married in
1869 to Georgina, daughter of the
late Emanuel Oakhill, a member of
an old yeoman farming family of
Gloucestershire, he has eight sons
and four daughters. Of the sons, one,

WALKER & CO., proprietors of
the Aberdare and Aberdare Ex-
tended Collieries, near Ipswich.
This well-known firm was estab-
lished in 1900, in the first instance
the partners taking up on lease 112
acres of the “Cooneanna” Estate,
to which area was given by the new
proprietary the name of “Fair-
bank.” Operations were commenced
on the surface by excavating an in-
cline tunnel to cut the seam of coal
known as the Aberdare seam,
originally opened up and named by
the late Honourable Lewis Thomas.
When the last-named gentleman re-
tired from active participation in
the industry, he generously handed
over the original Aberdare mine
to his staff of employes, to be worked
by them on the co-operative system,
and the mine was conducted for
about a decade, when, from a variety
of causes, the proposition was aban-
doned. Shortly afterwards Walker
and Co. stepped in and took up the
lease, and the first move of the new
owners was to sink the present
Aberdare shaft on another part
of the property. The marked suc-
cess which has attended the firm’s
operations goes to prove that the
principle of co-operation is not so
infallible as its advocates would have
all believe. Since entering into pos-
session the proprietary has made
the mine a thoroughly profitable
investment, and the complete

absence of trouble among the workers
is a feature worthy of emphasis.
Subsequently the development of the
Aberdare mine enabled AValker
and Co. to inaugurate operations on
a more extensive scale, and their
knowledge, both theoretical and
practical, becoming enlarged with
wider experience, entirely estab-
lished their faith in the future pros-
perity of the coal industry in the
district. Thenceforward every avail-
able shilling which the partners
could command was spent on the
property, and each day witnessed a
steady increase in the quantity of
coal won from the mine. With the
profits derived from this source the
firm pushed on the development of
the area under its control, sinking
the Aberdare Extended, follow-
ing which Nos. 1 and 2 tunnels were
excavated. The total annual output
is now well over 110,000 tons, and
the firm holds large contracts for the
supply of coal to several of the most
important mercantile companies in
the Commonwealth, chief among
which may be mentioned the Orient
Steam Navigation Co., Limited, the
Adelaide Steamship Co., Limited,
the Queensland Government Rail-
ways, the Brisbane and South Bris-
bane Gas Companies, and other pri-
vate firms. The late AA ILLIAM
GEORGE AVALKER, father of the
founders of the business of Walker
and Co., hailed from London, Eng-
land, where he was born in the early
thirties of the last century, and
where his progenitors had followed
trading and industrial pursuits for
generations past. While yet in his
teens, the late Mr. Walker decided
to try his fortune in southern lati-
tudes, and his choice falling on
Moreton Bay he took passage in the
“Artemesia,” the first emigrant
ship to cleave the waters of the
northern settlement. In common
with most of the younger members
of the population of Australia, Mr.
Walker allowed his imagination to
be fired with reports of fortunes
made in a day on the goldfields, and
when the Rocky River rush set in
he shouldered his swag and, in com-
pany with thousands of others,
made his way to the New England
district of New South AVales, where
he applied himself to prospecting
work with a heart buoyed up by the
tales of romance which met his ear
on every side. Dame Fortune, how-
ever, looked upon him with disdain
in the gold-mining arena, and find-
ing himself reduced to the position
of a mere wage-earner on the field,
in 1849 he returned to Moreton Bay
district and invested what remained
cf his small savings in a carrying
plant, with the purpose in view of
carting supplies from Brisbane to
the inland stations, and bringing the
wool from these properties to Ips-
wich, which at that time was the
hub of the carrying trade, its posi-
tion at the head of the navigable
portion of the Brisbane River mak-
ing it the most suitable depot for
receiving merchandise for despatch
to the bigger centres in Australia
or the Old World. Subsequently


the late gentleman sold his teams,

with the construction of the first sec-
tion of the western line of railway.
Still later he was among the pioneers
of land settlement in the Rosewood
district, where he selected a block
for agricultural purposes, and went
into residence thereon. Before actu-
ally launching out on the develop-
ment of this holding, however, he
became interested in the discussion
on the possibilities of the develop-
ment on a large scale of the coal-
mining industry in Queensland. For
the purpose of associating himself
with this form of enterprise he re-
turned with his family to Ipswich,
where he began work on the mines,
and as his sons reached a responsible
age he arranged for them to be
taken on by the foremen, and thus
gave them the opportunity of learn-
ing all the details of coal-mining by
practical experience, which proved a
most valuable apprenticeship for
their future career. From 1875
right onward until the time of his
death in 1899, the late Mr. Walker
continued his connection witli the
mines at Ipswich, and after working
for some years as a specialist, in the
early eighties he took up a block of
land at Tivoli for mining purposes,
which he founded under the name of
ff 2
the Boxwood Colliery, and com-
menced operations on his own ac-
count, with the assistance of such
of his sons as were of an age to
co-operate with him in this venture.
Mr. Walker developed this proposi-
tion to a considerable point of suc-
cess, and some years later sold out
at a profit to a company, by which
eventually the mine was worked out.
Subsequently he discontinued par-
ticipation in active pursuits, and
lived in retirement, having by his
long and useful career in the land
of his adoption abundantly earned
the period of rest and leisure which,
as the result of years of strenuous
toil, he was then able to enjoy. He
married a Miss Perry, sister to Mr.
Whitehead, Ipswich.
MR. HENRY WALKER.
Thomas Perry, a colonist of over 60
years’ standing, who has long been
associated with the firm of Walker
and Co. Mr. Walker’s first connec-
tion with the Perry family dated
back to the Rocky River gold rush,
where he formed a close friendship
with an elder brother, the late Wil-
liam Perry, which led some time
later to a meeting between Mr.
Perry’s sister and his friend, and
resulted in a mutual attachment and
their subsequent marriage. By this
union there was a family of seven
sons and one daughter, the latter
being the wife of Mr. William Mil-
ler, one of the partners of the firm
under notice. Mr. Thomas Perry
came from Ireland to Moreton Bay
with his parents in the vessel
"Genghis Khan,” and though now
the only surviving member of his
family, his sister Isabella, the wife
of the late Mr. Walker, having died
on March 28, 1916, is still hale and
hearty and in full possession of all
his faculties. Prior to a long con-
nection with the timber trade in
Queensland, in which he spent about
a quarter of a century, Mr. Perry
was engaged in carrying work,
chiefly in Western Australia. In
later years, at the instance of the
Messrs. Walker, he undertook cer-
tain duties in connection with the
firm’s business, which, though of a
responsible nature, are not onerous,
and leave him with a fair proportion
of leisure, as befits his advancing
years. He was married in 1874 to a
daughter of the late John Hunter,
a stonemason, who emigrated from
Scotland to Australia in 1855, and
for many years was well known in
industrial circles in Ipswich, and
has one son and five daughters.

a brief period. As a little lad of
10 years old he was taken from his
studies to add his mite of earnings

rapidly springing up in the parental
home. His first employment was
that of a shepherd boy on the
McDougall family estate, which post
he held for three years, by which
time he was able to take up station
work of a more general character.
As he gained in independence of
spirit and in sturdiness of physique
he made further flights, holding

positions on various stations in the
western districts, eventually return-
ing to Toowoomba, where he spent a
short intervening period before the
departure of the family for Ipswich,
whither he accompanied them. By
this time, although still in his early
teens, he was able to take a man’s
part in the completion of several
contracts entered upon by his father,
and when the latter gentleman de-
cided to turn his attention to coal-
mining the younger one followed his
example for some time. Being
offered a post of a more lucrative
nature at Gladstone, he relinquished
his former occupation and spent
about two and a half years as a
worker on the construction of the
Government jetty at that port.

proving too profitable, he disposed of

independent lines in the Bundamba
coal district, his special department
being the control of the timber work
on the mines. He married Isabella
Palmer, daughter of the late Thomas
Green, an Ipswich pioneer of the
fifties, and has one daughter.
HENRY WALKER, the second
son, was born at Ipswich on March
16, 1864, and was educated at the
Ipswich and Rosewood State schools.
At 11 years of age he left school and
gained a short experience of farm
work, afterwards taking a lad’s posi-
tion under the late Mr. Wright at
the Eclipse Colliery, and as he
grew older continuing to work in
various mines in the district for a
number of years, in the early
eighties becoming engaged chiefly on
contract work at the New Swan
Bank Colliery at Dinmore. When
the firm of Walker & Co. was formed
Mr. Henry Walker was the first
manager appointed to control opera-
tions at the Fairbank Colliery,
which position at a subsequent
period he resigned for 12 months in
order to leave himself free to take
in hand the special training of his
son in the technical and practical
points of the coal-mining industry,
this son now being underground
manager at the Aberdare Ex-
tended Mine. Having completed
this task to his satisfaction, he re-
assumed his managerial duties until
1911, when he took charge of the
sinking of the Aberdare Extended
shaft, and when that work was com-
pleted and the mine was producing
he transferred his sphere of opera-
tions to the commercial side of the
business, acting as business and sales
manager, which post he held until
the present year (1916), when the
practical department once more
claimed his expert attention, and he
is now managing the Aberdare
Extended. Mr. Walker married
in 1886 Margaret, daughter of the
late James Auld, a colliery pioneer
of Queensland, who came from Scot-
land over half a century ago, and
for over 40 years was connected with
coal-mining in its early stages in
this State, being engaged in proving
properties and boring operations.

he entered the employ of the late
Honourable Lewis Thomas in the
Blackstone district. After reaching
man’s estate he relinquished the
coal industry to try his luck at gold-
mining at Gympie, where he soon
worked himself up to the position of
foreman, and subsequently became
manager of several mines in that
locality, among which the South
Smithfield and Glenmire took
pride of place. He also followed the
same occupation in the Cooktown
district, eventually returning to
Ipswich to take full charge of all
machinery on the coal-mining area
controlled by the firm, which posi-
tion he still continues to hold. He
married in 1888 Alice, daughter of
the late George Thompson, a con-
tractor, of Manchester, England,
and has issue five sons and five
daughters. The fourth son, ALEX-

energies to the furtherance of the
scheme. Upon the establishment of
the firm of Walker & Co. in 1900 he
was one of the quartette of brothers
who took the responsibility of in-
augurating operations upon their
shoulders, and he has contributed
in no small measure to the success
of the proposition. He managed the
Aberdare mine from its inception
in 1909 until the present year
(1916), when the position was taken
over by a younger brother, giving
on September 13, 1873, and at the
termination of his education, which
he received at the North Ipswich
State school, he started work in the
mines at 12 years of age. He was
“put through his paces" by his
father at the Boxwood Colliery,
and profiting by the advice and help
of his elder brothers gained a good
grip of his duties while still a mere
youth. Subsequently he took a posi-
tion as machine boy at the Waters-
town brickworks, resigning this
position two years later to return to
duties of business manager on behalf
of the firm. Mr. John Fulton
Walker in 1900 took to wife Ellen,
daughter of Mr. George Hudson, a
member of the well-known pottery
manufacturing firm of that name in
the Ipswich district, and a former
resident of Dinmore, by whom he
has a family of three sons and two
daughters. CHARLES WALKER,

attended the local State school until
his twelfth year, when, like his

Mr. Alexander Walker well-deserved
release from toil after 25 years of
steady and consistent labour. In
1893 he was married to Margaret

land, and became well known among
the pioneers of the West Moreton
restrict. His family consists of two
sons and two daughters. JOHN

was born at Walloon, near Ipswich,
coal-mining at the Whitwood No.

propositions in the district, where
he considerably enlarged his experi-
ence in the practical side of the in-
dustry. Eventually, having much
faith in the future of coal-mining in
Queensland, he joined the present
firm, and in 1912 was appointed to
the management of the Aberdare
Extended mine, which post he re-
tained until four years later, when
he relinquished it to assume the
brothers, he abandoned his school-
books to turn his attention to wage-
earning. The nearest pit to the old
home was the Waterstown, and
here he obtained his ©arly experi-
ence, since when he has had excep-
tional opportunities to perfect him-
self in all departments of the in-
dustry. For some time he was en-
gaged in gold-mining at Gympie,
and also spent some years on the
Darling Downs, where he opened up
and managed the Balgowan Collieries


on the Rosalie Plains, ultimately
finding his way back to Ipswich to
associate himself with his brothers
in the firm of Walker & Co., and
is now manager of the Aberdare
Colliery. He was married in 1900
to a daughter of Councillor John

of Queensland, is descended from an
old English family, a member of

Walker has always proved himself an
efficient worker, and at the present
time has charge of the underground
operations at the No. 1 Tunnel on
the Aberdare mine. Mr. Robert
\\ alker in 1902 espoused a daughter
of Mr. Thomas Brittain, a member
of an old Birmingham family, who
followed the brickmaking trade in
Queensland. There are two daugh-
ters by this union.
The late JOHN WRIGHT, of
Tivoli, near Ipswich, was born on
June 30, 1837, at Coolbawn, County
Kilkenny, Ireland, being the des-
cendant of a long line of colliery
owners who carried on operations in
that county for many generations,
and were well known among the
better-class population of the Emer-
ald Isle. The late gentleman was
engaged in the work of his father’s
colliery until about 30 years of age,

when he decided to seek wider fields
of enterprise, and with his young
wife and two children embarked by
the sailing vessel “Naval Reserve,’’
which left Ireland for the infant
settlement of Moreton Bay, arriving
on February 26, 1867. Upon arri-
val at his port of destination the

for those dependent upon him, in
respect to which prospects at first
seemed far from bright. He ac-
cepted temporary employment in
Brisbane at a wage which nowadays
would be scoffed at by a mere boy,
but being far from satisfied with
this opening shortly afterwards pro-
ceeded to Ipswich, where the coal-
mining industry had had its incep-
tion some time previously, a small
mine there being the only one in
existence in the State. Mr. Wright’s
knowledge, both technical and prac-
tical, of this important branch of
mining soon secured for him a
position on the Tivoli mine—from
which the township takes its name—
owned by the late Messrs. Hooper
and Robinson, and he continued in
this connection for about five years.
In 1873 he made arrangements to
lease a coal-mining preposition,
situated at Tivoli, on the north side
of the Bremer River, and giving the
now well-known name of Eclipse to
the property, with a few men to
assist him, he started cn his own
account. In this way Mr. Wright
became one of the first colliery
owners in Queensland, and with the
help of his handful of men from
this small beginning worked up his
enterprise until by the close of three
decades after its inception as many
as 120 miners were required to keep
up the big output of the mine. A
fine seam of coal, 13 feet in depth,
was struck, which was estimated to
be one of the thickest coal deposits
operated upon in the State, and
large contracts were undertaken by
Mr. Wright for the supply of the
Mount Crosby Pumping Station
(Brisbane Board of Waterworks),
the Ipswich Pumping Station, the
Queensland Woollen Company, Ltd.,
the Electric Lighting Company of
Toowoomba, the Queensland Rail-
way Department, and many other
big firms. As many as 45 horses
and 50 bullocks were kept to deliver
the coal to the various depots, and
in course of time an extension rail-
way was constructed, with a ter-
minus adjacent to this mine, by
which large quantities of the
mineral were despatched to different
destinations. The discovery that a
feature of this coal was its excellent
coke-producing properties marked a
new era in Mr. Wright’s enterprise,
and almost immediately he began to

specialize in this department, giving
his closest attention to what has be-
come widely known as the celebrated
"Eclipse” coke, which rapidly became
in great demand from all quarters.


Commencing with the modest number
of six ovens in 1878, he was con-
tinually finding it necessary to add
to this supply, until within 30
years as many as 4o ovens had been
elected, which were kept continually
in use. Big consignments of coke
were constantly under order by the
leading foundries and breweries of
the State, the Mount Morgan Gold
Mining Company, and from the
\ arious copper-mining centres. The
slack from these furnaces also was
found to be specially suitable for
certain purposes, occasioning a big
Oakey, on the Darling Downs, which
mine his sons are still engaged in
working. A man of quiet disposi-
tion, reserved, and unassuming, the
late Mr. Wright yet always held
himself ready to assist in works of
charity and usefulness, being im-
bued with that broad Christian
spirit which characterized so many
of the noble-souled pioneers who
braved the perils and hardships in-
cidental to their lot with the true
abandon of sacrifice towards what
they considered a worthy end, and
carried that principle into the other
daughter of the late George Wright,
also a Kilkenny man, and descend-
ant of a line of the Celtic race con-
ceded in Ireland to be as old as
Kilkenny itself. She now lives in
retirement at Tivoli, where the last
50 years of her life have been spent,
and where all but two of her 16
children were born and brought up.
She is surrounded by her daughters,

demand in southern and western
Queensland. The tctal area of the
“Eclipse” mining property owned
by the late Mr. Wright was 300
acres freehold; but not content with
concentrating his energies on the
one locality, he directed his atten-
tion to other coal-bearing districts,
and bringing an expert knowledge
to work was mainly instrumental in
opening coal mines at Purga, Wal-
loon, and Burrum, in addition to

spheres of action upon which they
entered. For half-a-century of his
life he enjoyed the co-cperation of a
good and faithful wife, who proved
herself a true partner cf his joys
and sorrows, and excellently played
the part of the cheery, hopeful help-
meet, with whom the adverse cir-
cumstance could be bravely met and
the disappointment turned into an
occasion of thankfulness, since it
formed the opportunity to unite the
two who shared it into a closer bond
of fellowship. Mrs. Wright is the
in their father’s footsteps in the
coal-mining industry, personally at-
tending to the working of the mines
in which they are interested. Of her
large family, two sons and five
daughters now survive. The late
Mr. Wright died in May, 1915,
leaving a name honoured and re-
spected by the residents of Ipswich
district and an example which might
with advantage be followed by those
who aim at leaving the world a little
more advanced in some particular
direction than they found it.


SAMUEL WATSON, J.P., one
of the oldest residents of Ipswich
city, in the vicinity of which he has
resided for over 67 years, is a son
of the late Richard Watson, a native
of County Fermanagh, Ireland, who
prior to his departure from his
mother country had served for eight
years as a sergeant in charge of sta-
tions in connection with the Irish
Peace Preservation Police. Richard
Watson, with his wife, arrived at
Sydney, New South Wales, by the
sailing vessel “Alfred,” in January,
1841, and the subject of this memoir
was born about two months later, on
St. Patrick’s Day. For about 18
months subsequent to his birth his
parents remained in Sydney, in 1843
coming to Moreton Bay, where Mr.
Watson had accepted a position in
the Border Police at Woogaroo,
under the late Dr. Simpson, the
Border Commissioner and officer in
charge of the whole district, inclu-
sive of Wide Bay. When the first
land sale of town lots was held in
Brisbane some time later the new-
comer availed himself of the oppor-
tunity to purchase two one-acre
allotments at Little Ipswich—now
known as West Ipswich—and here
he settled down to dairying and
other rural occupations, becoming
the owner of a very considerable
number of cattle, and earning the
distinction of being among the first,
if not the first, small stock-owners
of Queensland. He also, by acci-
dent, was the pioneer grower of a
cotton plant in Queensland, the
identity of the seedling being un-
known until pronounced upon by
the late Dr. J. Dunsmore Lang, who
happened to see the carefully-
tended “flower” in his neighbour’s
garden. Eventually land in the
Walloon district was selected by the
late Mr. Watson, and a removal of
the whole family to that vicinity was
the signal for the enlargement of
their borders in various directions,
advantage being taken of the 1866
Land Act by both Richard Watson
and his sons —now grown into man-
hood—to make considerable acqui-
sition of country suitable for stock-
raising purposes round about Ta-
rampa, where a further removal was
made some time later, and where
Mr. Richard Watson ended his days
after a useful life in the country of
his adoption. Mr. Samuel Watson
received his primary education at a
scholastic institution conducted by
the late Daniel M’Grath—one of
the pioneer instructors of youth in
Queensland —the building in which
he pursued his early studies being a
slab structure erected on the site
now occupied by the Christian Bro-
thers’ School in Ipswich. Sub-
sequently he attended classes pre-
sided over by the late S. F. White-
head, M.A., to whom he has always
been ready cheerfully to accord a
most grateful acknowledgment of his
indebtedness, stating that he re-
ceived more real benefit from the
time he spent with him than under
the tuition of any other school-
master. After leaving school he
became associated with his father in
avocations incidental to life on the
land, and eventually selected under
the provisions of the Land Act of
1863 a block of land on the Lockyer
Creek, where he established himself,
MR. RICHARD WATSON.
building a homestead which has
since become well known as “Yiew-
field.” On this salubrious spot Mr.
Watson inaugurated dairying opera-
tions on an extensive scale, as many
as 100 cows with full udders daily
gathering to the milking-sheds dur-
ing the summer months. His enter-
prise included the manufacture both
of butter and cheese, the former
commodity—which was entirely the
result of Mrs. Watson’s hand labour,
only an old-fashioned churn being
used on the farm—being brought to
Ipswich in firkins of 56 lb. and 100
lb. respectively, in consignments
usually of about a ton on each occa-
sion. The price realized for the
first consignment averaged between
2s. 6d. and 3s. per lb., and as the
excellence of the quality became
known a ready market was always
forthcoming for the product, and
Mrs. Watson was awarded numerous
prizes at the agricultural shows of
that primitive era, a circumstance
which gave zest to her strenuous
and unremitting labours. Husband
and wife alike were accustomed to
consider a 16-hour day the ordinary
thing, every minute of which was
crowded with its own duty, and no
light labour at that. The outset of
their married life was marked by a
period of financial depression in the
State, and the outlook was none too
promising, but the necessary courage
and grit to carry them through
were never lacking in either partner,
and their united efforts ensured sig-
nal success in the long run, despite
temporary setbacks, such as were
encountered by all the pioneer set-
tlers. At the outset the lessee of
the old “Tarampa” run was very
antagonistic to his country being
taken up by settlers, and he threw
what obstacles he could in their way
until he found that his efforts were
wasted and that it was a better
policy to make the best of the new
condition of things and to cultivate
a friendly spirit towards these and
other of the smaller selectors who
came to interfere with his undivided
sway in this region. As a bushman
Mr. Watson was second to none, and
it is recorded of him that when the
little “humpy” which served as a
home for the young couple during
the first two years of their married
life became too small for their in-
creasing family, and he resolved to
erect a more commodious dwelling,
single-handed he felled the timber,
cross-cut the logs, and parbuckled
them on the dray and on the saw-
pit for the sawyers to cut them into
scantling boards ready for the help-
ers he had engaged to undertake the
actual work of building the house.
At this time, although only about
91 stone in weight, he was possessed
of remarkable physical strength and
had a heart like a lion, being full
of indomitable energy, determination,
and pluck. He could accomplish
the almost incredible feat of milking
his 100 cows himself, starting at
about three o’clock in the early
morning, and anon be in the saddle
by 10 or 11 a.m., intent upon some
other piece of business. No idle
bread was ever eaten in the little
home at “Viewfield”; but the ut-
most liberality prevailed in the com-
missariat department when catering
for the necessities of the inner-man


of any employes was in question.
As the house referred to was near-
ing completion the cotton-picking
season commenced, and to assist in
this work Mr. Watson engaged some
boys from Ipswich, who found them-
selves embarked upon what appeared
to be a prolonged picnic, so generous
were the arrangements made in re-
gard to their provisioning. Cotton-
growing was the chief industry car-
ried on by Mr. Watson on an
auxiliary farm of 40 acres, and he
attained good results in the earlier
years of his enterprise in this direc-
tion, in one season realizing 2s. 6d.
per lb. on his cotton after being
ginned, while he also received a
bonus of £5 per bale for the same
product. His splendid vegetable
growths commanded universal ad-
miration, cabbages turning the scale
at from 20 lb. to 30 lb. each, and
shorthorn carrots weighing on an
average as much as 4 lb. each. In
the early eighties he suffered con-
siderably from the prevailing
drought, and lost his fine herd of
about 80 cows, with 150 mares and
foals; but, true to his type, he
never relinquished hope, and started
off again, undaunted, to build up his
fortunes as best he might. He was
accustomed to fatten a good deal of
stock for the butchering trade, in
the early days commanding as much
as £8 or £lO for heifers per head ;
but subsequently the price of cattle
reached so low a figure that he de-
cided to launch out on what he felt
would be a thoroughly paying pro-
position. Accordingly he entered
upon negotiations with his brothers,
Messrs. Richard and John Watson,
and his brother-in-law, Mr. Rod-
erick McLeod, to establish a butch-
ering business in the town of Ips-
wich, and for a time at least
supplied a number of the beasts for
slaughter from his own pastures.
This proved a most successful under-
taking, and eventually Mr. Samuel
Watson purchased his partners’ in-
terests, since when he has continued
to conduct the business as sole pro-
prietor, with the assistance of his
sons, one of whom, Mr. Samuel
Watson, junior, also manages a big
similar concern on behalf of his
father in the heart of Toowoomba.
Mr. Watson is a breeder of the Nor-
folk red-polled cattle, using as
sires three magnificent stud bulls of
this type, with a good strain of red-
polled cows and heifers. He has
always had great success in his
cattle-breeding ventures, and in ear-
lier days beat all competitors in the
shows held by the East and West
Moreton Pastoral and Agricultural
Society in their sale-yards at
Churchill, where all the station-
holders in West Moreton were wont
to exhibit their stock. In the fat
cattle section he was seldom beaten,
and he has in his possession a goodly
collection of prize cups, certificates,
and blue ribbons, testifying to the
unvarying excellence of his exhibits.
Mr. Watson has always been a lover
of a good horse, and for over 40
years has been engaged in breeding
enterprise, giving his attention to
all classes of equine stock, and in
this department he has pro-
duced many excellent specimens of
thoroughbreds, coachers, draughts,
and ponies. The splendidly-bred
blood stallion, “Pero” (by "Master
Whitehead, Ipswich.
MR. SAMUEL WATSON.
Magus” out of "Mincemeat”
"Cegoly,” an Arab, imported by
Messrs. Hardy and Weinholt, of
"Fassifern” Station), which was
used as sire at one time at "View-
field,” was responsible for a good
deal of the fine, reliable stock which
achieved such good results, not only
on the property where they nibbled
their first blades of grass, but also
on behalf of neighbouring land-
holders, intent upon strenuous
development work, in which the
assistance of a good strong animal
was an urgent necessity. Four of
“Pero’s” sons— viz., "Horwood,”
"Speculation,” "Orphan Boy,” and
"Combo”—were staunch retainers
of "Viewfield,” and in their
owner’s opinion —an expert one—
were hardly to be surpassed for
camp and cutting-out purposes. Of
these the favourite was "Horwood,”
kept by Mr. Watson for his own
exclusive use, and ridden by him
as a camp horse for fully 20 years;
but "Speculation” and "Orphan
Boy” were also splendid hacks, the
former frequently doing 90 miles in
a day, and the latter carrying his
master from dawn to dark, without
so much as champing his bit. The
celebrated hunter "Sultan,” who
won the double first prize (£4O) for
the best light and heavy weight
hunter at the Brisbane Exhibition
in his year, was also bred by Mr.
Watson; a further triumph by this
performer being registered on an-
other occasion, when he ran the
great Victorian horse, "Fairfield,”
very closely for the honours, the
latter winning by a point from
"Sultan,” who was awarded second
prize. Various other prizes fell to
the lot of this fine horse when ex-
hibited by Mr. Watson at the local
country shows; and in steeplechas-
ing events Mr. Watson’s two sons
found ideal co-operators in "Sul-
tan” and “Dreamer,” the latter
horse being also in possession of the
owner of "Viewfield.” “Adrian,”
another thoroughbred, was the win-
ner of numerous honours at Ipswich,
Gatton, Esk, and Goodna, and was
several years at the stud; while
among other sires successfully used
at “Viewfield” may be specially men-
tioned the renowned Norfolk cob,
"Despatch,” by first-class imported
stock; "Plunger,” a good coaching
stallion; and the handsome black
pony, "Kelso,” all of which have
maintained a consistently good repu-
tation and raised excellent progeny,
each in his own class. "Kelso” has
won prizes in every show in which
he has been exhibited, including the
championship at the National Show,
Brisbane, on two occasions. His de-
scendants are in good demand, the
highest prices always being cheer-
fully paid by purchasers requiring
ponies of this type. Indeed, the
S6W brand is popular in any mar-
ket. Mr. Watson enjoyed great
prestige for his horsemanship, and
the great care he took of his favour-
ite saddle-horses became a byword
among his associates. He not only
bred, but trained and rode his own
horses, and many events were won
by him on the old North Australian
Racecourse. No keener sportsman
ever pronounced upon the points of
a likely performer, and in the early
days of the colony, when the race
meetings of the North Australian


Jockey Club were regarded as the
principal meets in Queensland, and
everyone in and around the town of
Ipswich for many miles took the
most ardent interest in the doings
of the local “turf,” the owner of
“Viewfield” was in the forefront on
every occasion. He witnessed the
great race for the Queensland Cham-
pion Sweepstakes of 100 sovs. each,
with 1,000 guineas added by the
North Australian Club, which was
won by the late Mr. John Tait’s
chestnut mare “Zoe,” and which
was run off on May 29, 1861; and
recalls the sporting identities who
gathered to watch this and kindred
events, among them Sir Joshua
Peter Bell, the Hon. W. H. Yald-
wyn, Francis E. Bigge, Thos. de
Lacy Moffat, John Panton, John
Hardie, Arnold Wienholt, and a
host of others, including Hugh
Campbell, senior, who acted as clerk
of the course for a very lengthy
period at an era when all the officials
wore their scarlet coats and knee
breeches at every meeting. As an
amateur rider, in the early sixties,
it was generally conceded that there
were in the district very few superior
to Mr. Watson, and on one occa-
sion, on the old racecourse, he rode
a dead-heat in each of three events.
Subsequently he was elected a
steward of the Jockey Club, and he
still retains his scarlet coat, with its
buttons bearing the initials “N.A.
J.C.” all intact. When the name
of the club was changed, on Septem-
ber 17, 1886, to the Ipswich Turf
Club, he continued to be one of the
leading spirits in the later organiza-
tion, and served as one of its stew-
ards as long as the club existed.
His racehorses, “Adrian,” “For-
rester,” “Pretender,” and others,
were well known on this course, and
he was also a cordial supporter of
country meetings in the vicinity of
Ipswich. As a man interested in
mining, Mr. Watson is not perhaps
widsly known, nevertheless he has
dene his share in endeavouring to
forward the development of the
mineral resources of Queensland.
Close on half a century ago he em-
ployed a couple of men to prospect
for him in various localities for gold
and other minerals, and on his pro-
perty at Eskdale has had a large
number of shafts sunk, ranging in
depth from 10 ft. to 107 ft., being
convinced that there are some rich
reefs to be found in this region.
He was the first to discover copper
in West Moreton, his discovery
being a true fissure lode, and he
owns a freehold of 75 acres contain-
ing copper on Cressbrook Creek;
while he has also spent a large
amount of money in employing pros-
pectors in New South Wales. Mr.
Watson has always evinced consider-
able interest in public affairs, and
has held the Commission of the
Peace for nearly 50 years. He has
actively concerned himself in poli-
tical matters, and on one occasion
acted as deputy returning officer in
a Parliamentary election at his resi-
dence at Clarendon, when the poll
was closed riding 25 miles with the
ballot-box strapped to his saddle to
deposit the returns at Ipswich. An-
other time he secured the return of
his candidates by having seven of
his best horses saddled up early on
the election day, and by this means
bringing the electors to the polling-
booth at Fernvale to record their
votes. In January, 1866, Mr. Wat-
son married Margaret Noonan, a
representative of one of the early
pioneering families of West More-
ton, by which union there are four
sons and four daughters. In 1916
the venerable couple celebrated their
golden wedding at Ipswich, on
which occasion a large party of re-
latives and friends gathered to do
them honour, and some handsome
gifts were received by them, besides
hearty congratulatory messages from
various parts of the State. Mr. Wat-
son’s four sons—Samuel R., Wil-
liam J., Thomas G., and Robert P.
—are all associated with their father
in his business, and also follow in
his footsteps in their activity in
local affairs, their membership on
various committees testifying to the
sincerity of their desire to serve the
community of which they fcrm a
part in a worthy manner.
ARTHUR FOOTE, Limited, Ips-
wich. This big joinery business,
which is the principal concern of its
kind in the commercial capital of
Queensland, was established in the
month of October, 1898, by the
present head of the firm, who opened
up operations on a modest scale in
Bremer Street. His restricted capi-
tal allowed him the assistance of
only one man and a boy, who, how-
ever, with himself, were easily able
to handle the work, which at that
period was carried out in a shed
measuring 34 by 22 feet. It is an
interesting circumstance that his
adult assistant has continued in the
business right from its inception up
to the present time. So persistent
was Mr. Foote in his bid for success,
so undaunted by any temporary
throwback, and so thorough and
efficient in the accomplishment of
the work that came his way that
the little shop in Bremer Street be-
gan to attract attention, and large
orders from influential quarters
varied the monotony of the small
routine. By degrees success showed
unmistakable evidence of having
come to stay, the integrity, energy,
and thorough knowledge of his trade
possessed by Mr. Foote being the
main factors to bring about this
favourable condition of affairs. An
increase in the staff became neces-
sary, and a removal to bigger pre-
mises in North Ipswich. Work
flowed in, and at the present time
(1916), in less than a score of years
from the commencement of the en-
terprise, the business has developed
to such proportions that, approxi-
mately, half a hundred employes are
now required to tend the whirring
machinery and discharge the thou-
sand and one details connected with
the firm’s extensive output. Joinery
work of every description is turned
out on the premises, fittings and fur-
niture for offices, schools, and
churches, etc., and the firm has
established a very wide connection,
extending, not alone over the West
Moreton district, but throughout
the entire length and breadth of the
State. ARTHUR FOOTE, the
principal member of the firm, was
born on August 3, 1850, at Comp-
ton Pauncefoot, Somersetshire, Eng-
land, and is a son of the late George
Foote, who, in common with most of
his family connection, followed agri-
cultural occupations in his native
county before his advent to the land
of the Southern Cross. For genera-
tions the progenitors of the Foote
family had resided in Somersetshire,
where as farmers of the sturdy yeo-
man class they occupied an import-
ant place in the community. From
this section of the British people
sprang many of those more adven-
turous spirits in whom lay dormant
a desire to escape from the tradition
of their fathers and to achieve for
themselves some greater degree of
prosperity than the limitations of
life in the Old Country made pos-
sible. In these rose high the ambi-
tion to go forth and conquer under
the flag of peace the wide tracts of
country in different parts of the
world which lay unfruitful and use-
less until the pastoralist and the
farmer should appear with their
herds and their ploughshares to


change the primitive conditions and
make the wilderness to rejoice in the
possession of flourishing homesteads
and fat flocks and fields. Amoiw

of age, when in consequence of the
death of his father he had to turn
out to earn his livelihood. After
working for some time in a bakery,
at 14 he was apprenticed to the
trade of wheelwright and carpenter,
and put in seven years of steady
work, giving close attention to the
details necessary to command suc-
cess. For the six years following his
release from his articles Mr. Foote
continued to work at his trade as a
journeyman, and although having to
compete with first-class craftsmen on
every hand—of whom there was no
lack in a country so thickly popu-
lated as England—he fought his way
up and soon fitted himself for a more
important post, eventually becoming
foreman to the well-known firm of
Harris & Sons, of Woking, Surrey,
which post he filled for a decade.
With a view to obtaining yet wider
scope for his abilities, he decided to
emigrate, and with his wife and the
young family which was growing up
round him, towards the close of 1888
took passage for Moreton Bay, in
January of the ensuing year first
setting foot upon Queensland soil.

cate of temperance in every walk of
life, and especially alive to the wis-
dom of inculcating in the young
those principles of moderation and
self-control which, he contends,
prove the best safeguard in the hour
of temptation. The third son,
Walter, was also born on English
soil, in 1886, and after arrival in
Queensland in due course received
his education at the Ipswich State
school. Upon the termination of his
studies he became associated with his
father and brothers in the joinery

his time and attention ever since.

EDWARD JOHN LOFTUS
EASTON, J.P., who is the chair-
man of the Bundamba Shire Coun-
cil, was born on April 13, 1863, at
“Terrawinaba” Station, near Goon-
diwindi, where his late father,
Frederick Charles Easton, was en-
gaged in the pastoral industry for
a number of years. The late Mr.
Easton came originally from Edin-
burgh, at which important centre
members of his family line for a
lengthy period back have augmented
the ranks of professional and army
men, his father holding medical
rank in the 15th Hussars. Frederick
Charles Easton arrived in Victoria
at the age of 17, the spirit of ad-
venture having moved him, even at
that early stage of his career, to go
forth in search of new experiences,
and in 1845 he found himself play-
ing his part in the early pastoral
enterprise of that State, letters of
introduction from various influen-
tial persons in the Old Country
readily securing for him a position
as jackaroo on one of the large sta-
tion properties of Victoria. Subse-
quently he came to New South
Wales, where he filled the post of
manager of “Yallaroi” Station, on
the Hunter River, on behalf of the
late Sir Arthur Palmer, and some

considerable time later he was
offered and accepted the appoint-
merit of manager of the old historic
“Yandilla” property, owned by the


Gore family, the affairs of which he
controlled until he had amassed suf-
ficient capital to make a bid towards
independent enterprise. With this
end in view he tcok up “Terrawin-
aba,” a sheep proposition, upon

which he bestowed a considerable
amount of labour for about a de-
cade, eventually selling out in order
to select land on the Darling Downs,
near Clifton, this property, known
as “Ellenton," which is yet in the
family, being occupied at the pre-
sent time by the late Mr. Easton’s
widow and her two sons. Mr.
Easton’s life in Victoria and New
South Wales was full of risk from
various causes, and he met with
many rough experiences, it being
recorded of him that on one par-
ticular occasion his life was in dire
peril when, soon after his arrival in
the land, he was in charge of an
out-station, and several convict
shepherds, over whom it was his
duty to exercise control, attacked
him with violence and left him well-
nigh lifeless. He was well known
in the early days of Queensland as
a successful breeder of blcod horses,
and did useful work as a pioneer
pastoralist of a type fortunately
not rare at that formative period of
the country’s history. Honourable
to a degree, all of his actions were
directed by a spirit of true manli-
ness, and charitable thought and
action were the rule of his life. He
readily won the affection of those
with whom circumstance brought
him into contact, and became widely
known and respected throughout the
district where his pastoral interests
lay. His wife, a native of New
South Wales, was a daughter of the
late Edward Agnew, a clerk of petty
sessions at Muswelbrook, whose ear-
lier days were spent in the Indian
Civil Service, and who upon his death
left a name which is yet remem-
bered by many residents of the
Mother State. To Mr. and Mrs.
Easton was born a family of four
sons and four daughters, six of
whom survive. The subject of this
memoir, Mr. E. J. L. Easton, re-
ceived his primary education at the
Spring Hill State School, complet-
ing his scholastic training at the
Toowoomba Grammar School, which
institution he left at 17 years of
age. Returning to his home at Clif-
ton, he continued under the paren-
tal rcoftree until, upon attaining to
man’s estate, he took a position as
sub-manager offered to him by Mr.
Hurtle Fisher, in which he spent
four years, the duty of overlanding
stock occupying the major portion of
his time. During this period he
made use of some excellent oppor-
tunities to pick up a few good blood
horses, and eventually entered into
partnership with Mr. Fisher in the
establishment of a racing string, for
this purpose taking a lease of Jost
Vale now Hidden Vale near
Grandchester, which property was
used for grazing the horses and as
a training centre. The success which
attended this venture led him at a
later date to undertake the work of
training and racing on his own ac-
count, and shortly afterwards he
established himself at Booval, where
he still continues in this sphere of
enterprise. Mr. Easton also owns
a property which originally was part
of the old “Pilton" Estate, on the
Darling Downs, where he carries
on mixed farming, dairying, and
lucerne growing; and he has made
various investments in real estate in
the vicinity of Ipswich. Although
much absorbed in the claims of his
private proposition, Mr. Easton
always has allowed his interest to
be engaged in matters of public
moment, and has spared a generous
margin of time for those duties
which naturally fall to the lot of an
intelligent and progressive citizen.
Since his advent to the Ipswich dis-
trict he has been a prominent figure
in most of the public affairs of the
community of which he forms a
unit, and has occupied a seat in the
Bundamba Shire Council for over
six years, holding the office of
chairman during the year 1916.
For a lengthy period he has been
cordially recognized as one of the
most active members of the Queens-
land Pastoral and Agricultural
Society, and was elected president
of this organization for 1915-16. He
is a warden of the Anglican Church
cf All Saints at Booval, and is
known all over the district as a man
of irreproachable character, upright
in all his dealings, and a stickler
for integrity in all departments of
life. He never spares himself in any
matter by which he considers the
welfare of the district will be pro-
moted, and anything which he takes
up he fulfils with the utmost con-
scientiousness. He is a trustee of
the Bundamba racecourse, and in
his younger days was universally
known to all the racing enthusiasts
of Queensland as a highly successful
amateur rider, earning a reputation
also as an excellent judge of a good
horse. Numerous successes fell to
his lot, and in 1889 and 1890 he
won the Brisbane Cup with “But-
tons" and “Realm" respectively;
while his “King Cleo" was victori-
ous in the Champagne Stakes, the
Autumn Stakes, and the Queens-
land Derby in the year 1913-14. On
behalf of outside owners he pre-
pared “Persian Jewell," winner of
Miley, Brisbane.

Mr. Easton has some very excellent
young blood horses of the best rac-
ing strain in the Commonwealth,
drawn from the most successful
studs of the Southern States, and
with these he confidently anticipates
scoring yet further triumphs at some
future date. In 1893 Mr. Easton

dent of Ipswich, and has two sons

HANCOCK BROTHERS, Ltd.,
sawmillers and timber merchants,
North Ipswich. This well-known
business was established in Ipswich
as far back as 1872 by the late
Thomas Hancock, sen., the founder
of this branch of the Hancock family
in Queensland, who died in 1891 at
the age of 75 years. Born in Corn-
wall, England, in 1816, the late
gentleman followed the trade of a
wool-comber in the Old Country, in
1851 coming to Sydney, New South
Wales. Some nine years later,
accompanied by his three sons—
Josias, Thomas, and John—and one
daughter, he turned his attention to
the gold-mining industry in Queens-
land, prospecting with but little re-
ward for the labour expended. Per-
ceiving better prospects of success
in the timber trade, father and sons
became engaged in pit-sawing timber
for building purposes at Pine
Mountain, near Ipswich, pursuing
this enterprise for two years, which
period was marked by the start of a

small steam plant in the Rosewood
scrub. Shortly after erection this
mill was enlarged, and thencefor-
ward it was apparent that a sure
foundation had been established for
sawmilling by these pioneers, who in
those early days of the industry
found ready sale for their timber in
Ipswich and the West Moreton dis-
trict. Following the opening of a
timber yard in North Ipswich, a
small mill was erected in Canning
Street, and later a lease was taken
of the pioneer sawmill of the dis-
trict, previously conducted by the
late James Reilly, the latter mill
eventually being purchased from the
widow of the late proprietor. This
site is still occupied by Messrs. Han-
cock & Sons, Limited. The Rose-
wood mill, situated in the midst of
virgin scrub and forest lands, served
as a constant feeder to the larger
mill at Ipswich for many years, the
timber being carted to town by
means of four-horse teams and wag-
gons. Many hardships, through fire
and flood, and from other causes,
were encountered in these early days
of sawmilling. Floods, which oc-
curred very frequently between 1880
and 1887, often inundated a large
part of the town of Ipswich, and
invariably proved a serious setback
to all the timber firms, while in 1885
Messrs. Hancock Brothers’ mill and
stocks of timber were almost com-
pletely wrecked by a disastrous fire.
From time to time the firm under-
went successive changes in personnel,
Mr. Thomas Hancock, sen., retiring
in 1884, leaving Josias Hancock and
Thomas Hancock, jun., in possession
of the business. The youngest son,
John, though not a member of the
firm, was at this time in charge of
one of the important departments of
this growing business. Two years
after the senior proprietor’s retire-
ment, Josias disposed of his interest
to Thomas Hancock, jun., under
whose enterprising management a
new mill was erected at Dugandan,
and the foundations of another laid
at Villeneuve, where extensive tim-
ber lands were purchased just before
his death in 1897 at the age of 53.
For some seven years subsequent to
the death of Mr. Thomas Hancock
operations were supervised by the
trustees of the estate, who relin-
quished control to the late Thomas
Walter Hancock, eldest son of the
late gentlemen, in the year 1904.
His regime was marked by a steady
progress of the business, though in
the first year or two the timber trade
was dull in most parts of the State.
In 1910 a boom in the timber busi-
ness was in evidence, but in that
year Mr. Thomas Walter Hancock
died, making further changes neces-
sary. In 1911 the business was

converted into a limited company, the
shareholders being the four sons and
four daughters of the late Thomas
Hancock, with Norman Edward
Hancock as managing director, and
including upon the directorate
Messrs. Robin Ernest and Sidney
Harold Hancock, all members of the
family directly concerned. In pass-
ing on from this brief review of the
history of one of the most important
timber firms in Queensland, men-
tion must be made of Mr. William
Tunstall, jun., to whom is due much
of the popularity and good reputa-
tion of the business in its later years.
At the transition stage of the firm’s
operations, after the death of the
late Thomas Hancock, jun., the
management devolved almost en-
tirely upon the capable shoulders of
this gentleman. Mr. Tunstall’s ser-
vices were fully appreciated by the
trustees, for whom he acted as mana-
ger, and he still retains his place in
the firm, with which he has now
been associated for over a quarter of
a century, at the present time dis-
charging the responsible duties of
secretary. The late Thomas Han-
cock, father of the present members
of the firm, was a native of Corn-
wall, England, but on account of his
early association with Ipswich, to
which town he was brought by his
parents in his boyhood days, by
degrees he came to be looked upon
almost in the light of a native of the
inland city. He took a keen interest
in the growth and progress of the
land of his adoption, and gave cor-
dial support to all that appealed to
him as pertaining to the public weal
and the betterment of trading and
industrial conditions. His decease,
like that of his worthy father, was
the signal for widespread regret
throughout the West Moreton district,

where the loss of two colonists
of such sterling character and enter-
prising spirit was felt to be a general
cause for mourning among those who
stood sentinel at the outposts of


Empire and who cherished the best
ideals for the national prosperity.
Mrs. Hancock, the widow of the late
Thomas Hancock, who now lives in
retirement in Ipswich, has also
played her part and made her sacri-
fices, as an Englishwoman with
worthy traditions behind her, upon
whom has devolved the important
duty of bringing up a large family
of sons and daughters to take their
place in a young country and assist
in the working out of its destiny in
the world’s history. Mrs. Hancock
came to Queensland as a girl with
her parents, her father, the late
William Hayne, settling in Ipswich,
where he followed his trade of black-
smith and wheelwright on his own
account for over 20 years. Of her
marriage with Mr. Hancock there
was issue five sons and five daugh-
ters, of whom two are now deceased.
The eldest surviving son, Norman
Edward Hancock, who, as already
stated, acts as managing director of
the firm of Hancock Brothers, Ltd.,
like all of his brothers and sisters,
is a native of Ipswich, where also he
received his education, and in course
of time became connected with his
father’s business, which has been the
scene of his labours ever since. He
is identified with various organiza-
tions, being a member of the local
Chamber of Commerce, deacon of
the Congregational Church, and a
industry a t Mackay, and lias two

F. E. BARBAT & SONS, engi-
neers, iron and brass founders, and
bolt manufacturers, North Ipswich.
This large and important business is
one of the thriving concerns which,
established in Ipswich in the seven-
ties, soon made the fact apparent
that they had come to stay. The
founders were Messrs. F. G. Spring-
all and J. Frost, engineers well
qualified to launch a big enterprise
in a growing centre ; and, undaunted
by the many difficulties which were
bound to arise in pursuance of such
an undertaking, this firm became
the pioneer in locomotive construc-
tion in the State, the “No. 1
Queensland,’ ’ for use on the local
railways, being completed on Octo-
ber 11, 1887. At a later date
Messrs. Springall & Frost floated
the business into the Phoenix Engi-
neering Company, and under this
title continued to operate until,
about the year 1900, when the ven-
ture was put into the market and
was purchased by Mr. F. E. Barbat.
That gentleman, with the co-opera-
tion of his sons, has since carried on
the enterprise with conspicuously
good results. The works are very
extensive, occupying an area of over
four acres, on a portion of which a
railway siding has been constructed.

and Sons. Mr. Felix Edward Bar-
bat, the senior member, was born at
Maryborough, Victoria, on Novem-
ber 7, 1858, and is a son of the late
Felix Barbat, sawmiller and general
contractor, of that place. The last-
named gentleman hailed originally
from France, being a Parisian who,
on account of the political disturb-
ances, left his native land in the
early fifties. Mr. Barbat landed in
Victoria in the flower of his man-
hood, being then just over 30 years
of age, at a time when the romance
attaching to the early goldfields was
at its height, Bendigo and Ballarat
being regarded as veritable El
Dorados. He soon became a well-
known figure among the prospectors.
Subsequently he instituted a carry-
ing business between the infant
metropolis and the goldfields. He
next started storekeeping on his own
account, establishing as many as 10
or 12 branch stores over the widely-
scattered fields of the sister State.
Mr. Barbat was the proprietor of
the first bakery and general store at
Avoca, in which district eventually
he settled down, there making his
permanent home. He is remembered
as the pioneer of the timber trade
in that district, and as the builder
of the first bush tramway for the
conveyance of logs from the virgin
forest. Felix Barbat was a staunch
MR. A. J. BARBAT.
friend, and his loyalty to the rugged
mates of honest worth was pro-
verbial. The late Mr. Barbat left a
family of three sons and two daugh-
ters, in whom the admixture of
French and Irish nationality—their
mother being an Hibernian—has re-
sulted in a character of the ideal
type for colonizing a new country,
all of the offspring having proved

themselves good citizens of their
native land. The gentleman under
review, Mr. Felix Edward Barbat,
was the eldest son of the family,
and owing to the primitive conditions
amid which his youth was spent,
received but a scanty education,
having to fend for himself from a
very early age. In his seventeenth
year he obtained a position with
Messrs. Miller Bros., who had
taken a contract in connection
with the Port Augusta to Charlotte
Springs railway. For four years the
young man was closely identified
with this work, and subsequently
he was employed as assistant engi-
neer. At the age of 23, after hard
MR. P. A. BARBAT.
study and fighting many difficulties,
he was able to establish himself in
practice as an architect in Sydney.
For three years he followed this pro-
fession with considerable success,
one of the monuments of his skill
in this direction being the Rand-
wick Hotel, which still bears favour-
able comparison with the more
modern structures of a later area.
Eventually he passed to the busi-
ness of a general builder and con-
tractor. The wharfs at Circular
Quay, the Petersham Viaduct, and
a number of railway stations, be-
sides other public works all over the
country, were of his construction,
and whilst these large contracts were
in course of completion, necessitating
large supplies of steel structure
work, Mr. Barbat decided to under-
take this department on his own
account. In this way he was led to
turn his attention to the iron and
steel industry, with far-reaching re-
sults. During these years, from
time to time, he was extensively
interested in gold-mining, being an
investor of considerable magnitude.
Among other such ventures, he took
up the lease of the Sebastopol mine,


near Temora, which he developed at
extensive cost. The fates, however,
were unpropitious, and having suf-
fered heavy losses he directed his
attention to Western Australia,
where he did much prospecting,
taking with him machinery from
Sebastopol to the Lake Way district
in that State, undeterred by the
heavy cost of freight. Here, although
gold was found and worked in con-
siderable quantities the high wages
and labour conditions generally
MR. V. P. BARBAT.
made continuance impossible, and
the mine eventually was abandoned.
Meanwhile Mr. Barbat had been
busy establishing a timber business
in Perth, which, when the mining
proposition proved a failure, he sold,
forthwith deciding, for family rea-
sons, to turn his face eastwards.
This was about the time when the
Ipswich railway workshops were
being built. Mr. Barbat secured the
contract for the steel constructional
work of these shops, and whilst he
was engaged in carrying out the con-
tract the old Phoenix foundry and
engineering works were placed on
the market. Perceiving in the ac-
quisition of these works an excellent
opportunity to realize his desire to
keep his sons round him, he became
the purchaser, and has successfully
conducted the business ever since,
the whole of his seven sons being
associated with him in the enter-
prise. Since his advent to Ipswich
Mr. Barbat has taken keen interest
in the public affairs of the town and
district. At one time he contested,
though unsuccessfully, its Parlia-
mentary honours in the Liberal in-
terest. He was appointed a Justice
of the Peace by the Philp Adminis-
tration in 1904. For many years
he has been a committeeman of the
Queensland Pastoral and Agricultu-
ral Society, of which for three years

he was president. He was one of
the founders, and two years presi-
dent, of the Ipswich Chamber of
Commerce, and is still acting on the
executive committee. When the
Kidston Government introduced the
Workers’ Compensation Act and in-
surance premiums rose he assisted

directors of that institution until
its winding-up, which was necessi-
tated by the conditions of the later

Government. Mr. Barbat has been
twice married—first in 1883, to a
daughter of the late John Carr, a
pioneer from Ireland, well known in
the early days of mining in Victoria,
of which union there are four sons.
After the death of this lady he mar-
ried Cecelia, daughter of the late

neer, of Avoca, by whom he has

BISHOP & WOODWARD, cloth-
ing manufacturers, East Street,
Ipswich (J. G. Bishop and F. G.
Woodward). This well-known firm
was established in 1911, when it
secured the clothing manufacturing
department of the Queensland Wool-
len Mills at Ipswich, which, though
at a very low ebb, possessed big pos-
sibilities. Being experts, the partners
were not discouraged by the prospect
of an extended period to be spent
in working up their trading connec-
tion, their confidence in themselves
and in the opening which they were
convinced existed in the country for
a high-class business worked by a
thoroughly efficient staff of employes
under the supervision of experienced
heads being unbounded, and they at
once directed all their energies to
placing everything, down to the


smallest detail, on the best lines,
and as a result of this thorough
adjustment of their resources to
their field of labour they soon found
themselves advancing by leaps and
bounds, progress being made in every
direction with very rapid strides.
When Messrs. Bishop & Woodford
took over the business there were
only 25 machines in the plant, and
even these were scrapped as out-of-
date and inferior. A complete new
plant was installed, the success of
which fully justified the outlay, and
to-day the workroom presents a busy
hive of industry, the whirring of
nearly 200 machines indicating the
briskness of trade, and the con-
tented appearance of the staff pro-
viding the best testimony that there
is good foundation for the high re-
putation achieved both by the house
MR. JAMES GRACIE BISHOP.
and the personal members of the
firm. In addition to manufacturing
local goods, the firm imports material
by the piece from the big woollen
centres in the Old Country, and this
is made up for the wholesale trade
by the house of Bishop & Woodward,
who also act as contractors to the
Government of Queensland in their
especial line of industry. JAMES
GRACIE BISHOP, J.P., was born
at Redfern, Sydney, New South
Wales, on March 30, 1877, and is
the only son of the late George
Bishop, who hailed from Lancashire,
England, where for generations his
progenitors were associated with
trading pursuits. The late gentle-
man sailed for Australia at the
close of his schooldays, and became
engaged in the ironmongery business
in Tasmania for some little time,
subsequently accepting the manage-
ment of the firm of George Fletcher
and Sons, of Sydney, with whom he
was associated for many years. The
subject of this memoir received his
education at the Forth Street school,
Woollahra, where his studies ter-
minated at a somewhat early age
on account of his assistance being
required by his father, who was in
ill-health. The family in the mean-
time had removed to Brisbane, and
Mr. J. G. Bishop secured his first
business appointment as junior in the
office of Messrs. Robt. Harper & Co.,
where he spent three and a half
years, gradually working himself up
to a superior position in this office,
where he gained a knowledge of
mercantile affairs hardly second to
what might have been acquired by
him in a first-class commercial col-
lege, An offer from Messrs. Stewart
and Hemmant (now Alexander
Stewart & Sons) ga\ r e him the oppor-
tunity for which he was waiting to
make a definite start in life, and
beginning with office duties in
course of time he was transferred
to a more responsible position in the
factory at Fortitude Valley, which
was erected by that firm in 1898.
Applying himself with much indus-
try and tact to the mastery of his
obligations to employers and em-
ployes, he advanced to the position
of manager of the factory, which
post he filled for the latter five of
the 16 years he was identified with
the business of that firm. At the
close of this period, Mr. Bishop
being desirous to launch out on in-
dependent lines, conferred with his
fellow-employe, Mr. F. G. Wood-
ward, with the result that they
formed the partnership which, in-
augurated with good promise of
success, has since abundantly justi-
fied the enterprise which gave it
birth. Mr. Bishop takes a live in-
terest in matters pertaining to the
welfare of the district at large, and
considers no sacrifice too great if
thereby the benefit of the com-
munity may be advanced. He
assumes a double share of the public
burden, leaving his partner free to
devote himself more exclusively to
the interests of the business, and in
addition to his duties as a Justice
of the Peace—which office was con-
ferred upon him by the Denham
Administration—he is vice-president
of the Chamber of Commerce, Ips-
wich, a committeeman of the Queens-
land Pastoral and Agricultural
Society, and a member of the
Ipswich branch of the patriotic
executive committee. In connection
with the latter organization, he has
been particularly prominent as
working secretary to various of its
movements for securing funds for
the present wartime needs. In 1909
he married Ellen Mary, daughter
of the late Alexander Aulsebrook,
a well-known figure in commercial
circles in Brisbane for the past
quarter of a century, and has one
daughter. FRANCIS GEORGE
WOODWARD was born at Bal-
larat, Victoria, on March 25, 1868,
and is a son of the late George
Woodward, a direct descendant of
one of the pioneer discoverers of gold
in Victoria. Mr. Woodward’s grand-
father was one of the earliest up-
holders of the idea of an Australian

the famous Peter Lalor, of Eureka
Stockade fame, afterwards becoming,
with his leader, one of the best-
known citizens of the Garden State
in the romantic days of its infancy.
Mr. Woodward’s father, the son of
the last-mentioned identity, was
notedly prominent in athletics in
his native State, where he held the
championship in swimming circles
and in other branches of sport.
Francis George Woodward was edu-
cated at Grenville College, Ballarat,
and completing his scholastic studies
at 16 years of age served his appren-
ticeship to the well-known firm of
tailors, Messrs. Twentyman and

of his indentures accepted a position

years. Subsequently he became
manager of the London and Ameri-
can Tailoring Company, in the
Victorian metropolis, but retired
from this post for the purpose of
embarking upon another class of
business. Returning to the softgoods
manufacturing trade, he spent 12
years with the firm of Alexander
Stewart & Co., of Brisbane, during
the latter part of that period becom-
ing a departmental manager. Here
he became associated with Mr. Bishop
in the joint trading venture known
as Bishop & Woodward, clothing
manufacturers, now one of the most
prosperous concerns of Ipswich. Mr.
Woodward conducts the practical side
of the business, including the man-
agement of the factory, where his
skill and experience have achieved
a marked success. Mr. Wood-
ward has been twice married—the
first time in Victoria, to a daughter
of the late Andrew S. Lennie, an
old Victorian pioneer, of which
union there is one son. Some years
after the death of this lady, in 1906,
he espoused Anna Florence, daugh-

Sandgate, Queensland, and by
this lady has issue one son and
four daughters.

The township of Rosewood forms one of the older

never since become aggregated into large sheep or cattle
runs. The soil and natural conditions generally are
fitted to intense culture at highly-productive forms of
mixed farming. Within twelve miles of the busy
mining, manufacturing, and commercial population of
Ipswich, and only thirty-five miles from the shipping
facilities of the metropolis, rich land and a copious
laintall have combined in giving a solidarity of pros-
perity not often met with outside the more densely-
populated States of Victoria and New South Wales.
The real growth of Rosewood as a town dates from
the construction of the 'railway. Grandchester, the first
terminus, was known in the early days as Bigg’s Camp.
The railway works brought a large camp of men to the
district. Many of the labourers were naturally suited
to attain success at agricultural pursuits, and among
those of sober and industrious habits opportunities for
spending money were few whilst the contract was in
progress. Fertile land was being sold outright on easy
terms, at prices which must have appeared low, even in
those times, to intending selectors able to see far enough
into the future to realize what proximity to the colony’s
main centres of population must ultimately mean for
local primary industry. Large quantities of capital
were not required for agricultural pioneering in this
region. Practical experience at clearing timber and at
other primitive operations connected with first settle-
ment, coupled with strong muscles and stout hearts,
constituted the assets of most value to the first farmers.
With the completion of the Grandchester stage of the
railway, numbers of men, finding themselves with big
cheques in their pockets, were glad to take part in the
conversion from squatting enterprise to farming which
was taking place round the neighbourhood where the
township of Rosewood now stands.
W hat now forms the town of Rosewood was first
acquired by Messrs. Mathews & Foote. The main street
marks the boundary separating the respective selections
of that pair of pioneers. When settlement began to
increase, each owner gave to the public half a chain
of land joining the division fence. That is how the
chain-wide thoroughfare came to be laid out in its pre-
sent position. Also it is the reason why Rosewood was
not proclaimed a town, and you may look in vain
for anything more than a dot showing its position on
the official Queensland maps pubiislred for long after
the place had attained considerable commercial and
other prominence. Foote afterwards sold out to a
selector named Vance, and the selections of both
Mathews and Vance were afterwards cut up and sold
into township allotments.
In its conversion from squatting occupation to the
more productive purposes of farming enterprise, the
land about Rosewood was first sold in 640-acre blocks.
As the demand continued to increase and the prolific
nature of the district became more widely recognized,
the Government reduced the size of the holdings attain-
able by selectors—first to 320 acres each and then to
160 acres. Prices varied from a few shillings per acre
upwards, and residential clauses were included in the
terms of selection. Often the latter were honoured
more in the breach than in the observance. Govern-
ment inspection was more difficult in those days
than at a later date, and public criticism of the
administration of Government departments was not
so keen. Yet little impediment of a general character to
the growth and development of the Rosewood district
resulted from some of these rules of occupation not
having been complied with. The district round about
the town is now closely settled with a thriving agricul-
tural population.
The railway line between Ipswich and Toowoomba
skirts along what was the natural original boundary
between the forest and the scrub lands. As the traveller
journeys towards Toowoomba, the scrub land, which is
the more prolific of the two, lies on his right. Near Rose-
wood are rich alluvial flats. The soil here is formed of
decomposed igneous rock washed down from neighbour-
ing hills of volcanic origin. Water may be obtained by
sinking at shallow levels, and lucerne, owing partly to
the deep root-driving propensities of that plant, grows
luxuriantly almost anywhere in the district. Maize and
oats yield heavy crops, and the country is eminently
suited for dairying and mixed farming. But the agri-
cultural propensities are not properly realized until the
visitor ascends a line of volcanic hills lying some four
miles to the north of the railway line. From the
summit of this ridge there opens a view stretching
as far as the eye can reach, which displays a vista
of undulating agricultural land of the highest quality,
which in the springtime or in the autumn gleams
with a verdant wealth of pastures, to be found only
where a copious rainfall meets with soil naturally
well drained by reason of its physical and chemical
characteristics.
Few parts of Australia are suited to the production
of so numerous and varied a list of crops as is the Rose-
wood district. This feature is common, in a more or
less marked degree, to all the richer and better-
watered areas of the eastern coastal regions of Queens-
land ; but is particularly pronounced about the locality
under review. Among the heavier crops attracting a
large share of local attention is sugar-cane, which is
crushed at a mill established at Townsheud (formerly
Marburg), the terminus of a line some nine miles in
length which branches off from the western railway line
at Rosewood. Without the use of manure farmers
have found their industry has maintained its
high productive value without apparent diminution
since the days of earliest cultivation. Increased vields


are obtained here and there by the proper application
of fertilizers, but advanced methods have not as yet
come to be commonly adopted. With the use of
scientific systems of cultivating the land the high returns
already secured would be greatly added to.
What has been described as the highest quality of
coal yet found in Queensland lies buried below the
Rosewood farms. One mine is working within a mile
from the town, whilst another is in operation a mile
further out. Deposits of shale have also been discovered
in the district, and a natural deposit of gas was found
at a depth of about 800 feet. Unfortunately, the bore
was destroyed by an explosion, and no systematic effort
has since been 'made to again locate the supply.
The Rosewood shire contains an area of 219 square
miles, whilst the population was officially estimated on
December 31, 1914, as numbering 3,570 persons. The
local authority was proclaimed on July 1, 1905.

his father, the late Robert Bulcock,
having come to this State from
England in 1855 as a young man of
23. After arrival the late Mr.
Bulcock first became engaged in
farming pursuits, and later on
established himself as a seed mer-
chant and florist in Queen Street,
Brisbane, subsequently extending
his operations to Ipswich, where he
opened a branch store. At a later
date he turned his attention to
politics, and on September 26, 1885,
received election to the Legislative
Assembly as representative for Enog-
gera District. After about nine
years in the Lower House he was
appointed to the Legislative Council
on August 23, 1894. He died in
the year 1900 at the age of 68,
after a useful life spent in aiding the
development of his adopted country.
Mr. Thomas Ernest Bulcock was
born at Brisbane in 1872, and
received his education at the State
school at West End, with a finish-
ing course at the Rock Eden private
school, at Spring Hill, near Bris-
bane. Leaving this institution at
16, he was apprenticed to the old-
established firm of Messrs. Brooks
and Noble, hardware merchants, of
Brisbane, with whom he remained
for two and a half years. Seventeen
years with Messrs. Alfred Shaw and
Co. followed, from which connec-
tion he retired in 1908 for the
purpose of launching out on his own
account. Coming to Rosewood, Mr.
MR. THOMAS ERNEST BULCOCK.
Bulcock purchased the general mer-
chant’s business, founded in the first
instance by Mr. F. S. Lound, and
conducted by him until it was
taken over by the present proprietor.
Mr. Bulcock inaugurated a very pro-
gressive policy from the first, and
since his administration began has
had the satisfaction of seeing an
increase of 100 per cent, in the turn-
over, necessitating the employment
of a large staff of assistants. In
addition to this enterprise he is
interested in an aiictioneering b\isi-
ness in the same town, his firm,
under the title of Whitworth and
Bulcock, having a monopoly of pig
sales in the Rosewood district. In
1910 Mr. Bnlcock built for himself
a residence of most modern design,
a handsome, bow-windowed villa,
standing well back from the main
road to Townshend (late Marburg)


in on© and a quarter acres of land,
a tasteful flower garden, adorned
with statuary, enhancing the ap-
pearance of the place. Eight lofty
and spacious rooms, in addition to
kitchen and offices, are contained
in the interior, while a feature
of the house is a summer sleeping-
room, formed by the bay, octagonal
in shape, and 12 feet across, with
windows on all sides. Mr. Bulcock
during the few years of his residence
at Rosewood has shown himself ever
ready to assist in all movements for
the welfare of the community, and
although he has not yet identified
himself with any public office he
takes a genuine interest in the pro-
gress of the district. He is a mem-
ber of the Masonic fraternity, being
associated with the Rosewood Lodge,
Scotch Constitution. Mr. Bulcock
was married in 1909 to Edith Mary,
daughter of Mr. M. Bourke, cattle
dealer, of Rosewood.
WILLIAM HENRY DANCE,
J.P., “Hill View,” Kircheim, was
born in 1866 at Tamerton, Devon-
shire, England, and is the second
son of the late George Dance, a
successful farmer of that County,
who died in 1898 at the age of 56.
MR. GEORGE DANCE.
At the close of his education, Mr. W.
LI. Dance began to assist his father on
the farm. As one of a large family,
the lad of 14 found his time fully
occupied in the varied duties that
fell to his share, and the practical
knowledge which he gained has
stood him in good stead on
many occasions in his later career
whilst working out his destiny in far-
distant climes. His decision to come
to Australia was the result of a
momentary impulse, and leaving the
Old Country by the steamship “New
Guinea,’' he arrived at Brisbane in
1855. After a short sojourn in the
capital he proceeded to Toowoomba,
and for the sake of gaining experience
under the new conditions in which he
found himself, sought employment
on the surrounding farms, and also
worked for a time as a bush car-
penter. In 1888 he made his initial
move towards independent enterprise
by purchasing the block of land on
which his homestead now stands.
The land was then heavily timbered
with scrub, and the 101 acres which
comprised his holding took many
years of arduous labour to clear and
prepare for cultivation. Among the
troubles experienced by the early
settlers were included the destructive
native dogs, which were very
numerous and daring, and which on
one occasion actually approached
Mr. Dance’s house and killed and
ate his watchdog on the chain!
Having completed the preparatory
work on a portion of his land, he
put in maize and sugar-cane, and at
a later period started dairying oper-
ations. As prosperity crowned his
efforts he was able to purchase addi-
tional land, and eventually acquired
half a dozen other farms, giving him
a total area of 450 acres, which is
worked by Mr. Dance with the
assistance of his sons. During
the great drought which occurred at
the beginning of this century, a
cessation of activities threw a great
deal of spare time on the settlers’
hands, and in order to provide him-
self with useful employment, Mr.
Dance set to work to build the fine,
comfortable residence which he has
since made his home. With the
break-up of the drought affairs on
the farm once more resumed their
normal course, and no serious throw-
backs have retarded the progressive
policy which for many years has
been the order of the day. Stock-
breeding is carried on successfully,

and Mr. Dance is the holder of
prizes for draught and coaching
stallions, and has also exhibited
Jersey cattle and cattle dogs at
various shows with highly satisfac-
tory results. He has kept his eyes
open for profitable investment in
real estate at Townshend (late Mar-
kurg), and after the destruction by
fire of some business premises on a

street, he secured the freehold of this
land, and erected a fine block of
shops and offices of modern design.


He interests himself in the public
affairs of the town and district, and is
chairman of the works committee in
connection with the Walloon Shire
Council. He is an active member
of the local agricultural and indus-
trial association, of which he is vice-
president; is a member of the
Church of England; and has passed
through the various chairs of the
Masonic Lodge, Rosewood, S.C. Mr.
Dance has been twice married, and
has a family of 13 children.
ALEXANDER McINTYRE
REA, J.P., 'Cypress” Farm,
Thagoona, was born at Brisbane in
MR. JOHN NICOL REA.
1865, and is the second son of the
late John Nicol Rea, who came to
Australia from Aberdeen, Scotland,
mariner, chartered a couple of
schooners and became engaged in the
overseas and coastal shipping trade.
Subsequently he disposed of his
maritime interests, and turned his
attention to hotelkeeping at Bathurst,
N.S.W., where he remained for some
time. When the rush for the newly-
discovered Ballarat goldfields set in,
and trade became slack, he sold out
and brought his family to Queens-
land, where he launched out in
another direction, purchasing cattle
and engaging in stock-raising at
Purga and Warrill Creek, near
Ipswich. Later he removed to Pine
Mountain, and thence to Rosewood,
finally settling in the locality now
known as Thagoona. It is an inter-
esting item of local history that this
place was originally known as Ten-
Mile Peg, which name was changed
to Rea’s Siding when the railway
was brought through the district.
Not far distant the railway station
called Reaside was established, but
confusion arising the present name
of Thagoona was substituted for the
former appellation. Mr. Rea was
the pioneer settler in this district,
and with his son was the first to
discover coal at Walloon, where the
“Caledonian” Mine was developed.
He worked vigorously to obtain rail-
way facilities for the district, the
siding known by his name being
the direct outcome of the late Mr.
Rea’s efforts. He died on April
21, 1902, at 77 years of age. Mr.
Alexander Mclntyre Rea received
his primary education at Rosewood,
later on attending schools at Rose-
wood and Walloon. He completed
his scholastic studies at Ipswich, and
at 15 years of age took up duties on
his father’s farm. Later he was
He next qualified as engine-driver,
and worked in this capacity on
the Caledonian coal mine. Eventually
in 1894 he purchased the land on

of his holding. Like most other
early settlers he found the life hard
and strenuous, but by determination
and industry he has made a thorough
success of his proposition. The
original block of land comprised
only 51 acres, but as time passed
he was able to acquire additional
acreage, and at the present time
dairying operations are the mainstay
of the farm. He is interested in
horse-breeding, and has gained
several awards with his Clydesdale
stallion “Prince Charlie” and the
pony “Yongala.” He was appointed

England, in 1860, and is the eldest
son of Mr. George Setch, sen., who

He still (1916) resides in London,
and at 86 years of age is hale and
hearty, enjoying the use of most of
his faculties, and taking an interest
in the varied life around him. Mr.
George Setch was educated at
London and made his entry into
commercial life with the firm of
Messrs. Armstrong & Co., linseed oil
merchants. He relinquished this
employ to enter the service of
Messrs. David Storey & Sons, where
he continued until his twenty-third
year, and upon his return from a
short visit to New York, U.S.A.,
left his native land for Australia
on June 22, 1883. He made the trip
by the sailing-ship “Rowella,” and
after landing at Moreton Bay pro-
ceeded direct to Townshend (late
Marburg), where he was employed in
a sawmill for six months. He further
enlarged his experience by under-
taking the management of a team
of horses, the property of the late
Mr. J. L. Frederich, and having
made himself proficient in this
department of bush education and
gained considerable knowledge bear-
ing upon the general conditions of
the country, he took up a farm of
about 40 acres, situated at Rose-
wood, where he cultivated maize
and potatoes with a fair measure of
success. In 1887 Mr. Setch came
to Glamorgan Vale, and pur-
chased a partly-improved farm,
40 acres in extent, of which
10 acres had been cleared.
Proceeding with the develop-
ment of this holding, Mr.
Setch at a subsequent date was
able to secure an adjoining
area of 40 acres. Eventually
he sold the whole property,
and jmrchased the site of his
present homestead, with the
surrounding 160 acres. Years
of labour lay in front of
him before this farm—
which originally was a mass
of brigalow scrub—could be
made a paying proposition,
but undeterred by the pro-
spect of strenuous toil, he put
his shoulder to the wheel and
year by year saw him nearer the
completion of his task. At the
present time "Homeview” is a
highly-improved dairy farm, about
80 acres being under cultivation of
lucerne and other fodder for the milk-
ing herd, the cream from which is
sent to the Marburg Butter Factory.

co-operation of his son, is running

MULLER, J.P., “Billagoorpa,”
Grandchester Road, Minden, via
MR. F. W. MULLER AND HIS ELDEST SON, AND MR. ADOLPH F. MULLER.
Rosewood, was born at Gross Tasch-
endorf, Marienwerder, Germany, in
the year 1866, being the eldest son
of Mr. Frederich Muller, who, like
his fathers before him, carried on
farming pursuits in the above-men-
tioned district. Realizing the hope-
lessness of acquiring a sufficient area
in his native land to enable him to
provide adequately for his family, he
took passage to Australia, landing
in Queensland in 1871. He first
obtained employment on a farm at
Redbank, at a wage of 12s. a week,
and a few months later on the rail-
way line then in course of construc-
tion between Brisbane and Ipswich.
Being both capable and industrious,
he discovered that he could do better
on piecework, and accordingly under-
took contracts to supply ballast to
the railway from a stone quarry,
which proved so remunerative that
lie was soon the possessor of
his own horse and dray, besides
materially augmenting his in-
come. His hereditary calling, how-
ever, asserted its
claim, and in course
of time Mr. Muller
found himself in a
position to purchase
a block of 160 acres
at Minden, upon
which he settled
with his family, all
of whom applied
themselves to the
task of clearing
away the dense
scrub with which
the land was
covered, the father
wielding the axe
while mother and
children did the
lighter part of the
work. During these
early days of pion-
eering bread and
treacle and other
meagre provisions
frequently were the
only means of sub-
sistence obtainable
by the settlers, meat
and flour having
risen to prohibitive
prices; nevertheless,
by dint of courage
and hard work a
sufficient area was
cleared to allow of
the planting of a
crop of maize, with
a few pumpkins and
watermelons. Many

difficulties were encountered and
overcome, and thenceforward the
little homestead made steady
progress. Mr. F. W. Muller was
taught German in the home,
acquiring his English education
at the small local school; and
upon completing his eighteenth year
was placed by his father on a 50-acre
block of land situated in the
same district, where he continued for
24 years, during this time adding to
his holding by purchase of adjoin-
ing properties. This homestead is
now in possession of Mr. Adolph
Frederick Muller, grandson of the
original owner. In 1894 Mr. F. W.
Muller purchased two holdings,
aggregating 320 acres, in the Hat-
ton Vale district, which he still
retains, and in 1901 he acquired his
present homestead property, “Billa-
goorpa,” of 1,350 acres, situated
between Grandchester and Hatton
Vale, where some eight years later
he built the picturesque home in
which he now resides with his
family. The residence stands in the
midst of grounds devoted to a minia-
ture vineyard, a small banana plant-
ation, an orchard, and a flower and
vegetable garden. Trim white fences
and gates indicate the artistic taste
of the proprietor, and a feature of
more than usual interest is the very
large aviary, where feathered pets of
all kinds are to be seen. Mr. Muller
has interested himself in the affairs
of the neighbourhood, and served as
chairman of the Minden Co-opera-
tive Dairy Company for six years.
For 26 years he has been closely
associated with the local Lutheran
Church, for varying periods occupy-
ing the offices of Sunday-school
teacher, church treasurer, and
loi/iv
churchwarden. In 1914 he was
created a Justice of the Peace by
the Denham Administration, his son


being accorded a similar honour. In
1885 Mr. Muller married Augusta
Charlotte Maria, daughter of the
late Carl August Heise, one of the
old pioneers of the Minden district,
by whom he has two sons and one
daughter surviving.

ties, and set an example well worthy
of emulation by every citizen
ambitious for the improvement of
existing conditions and the eleva-
tion of the moral tone of the com-
munity. Plis bent was constructive
rather than iconoclastic, and as a
lay preacher and founder in this
district of the German Lutheran
Church he filled a prominent place
in the settlement. He established a
reputation for wisdom and sound
judgment, and his advice was invar-
iably sought by those of his com-
patriots in need of guidance from a
reliable source. This he always
gave willingly, and when his death
occurred in 1909 at 64 years of age,
he was sincerely mourned by a large
circle of friends, who had come to
regard him as one of the pillars of
the fraternity with which he had
chosen to link himself. His son,
Mr. A. L. Frederich, in early boy-
hood was a scholar at the local
State school, later on being sent to
complete his scholastic studies at
the Ipswich Grammar School. He
left this institution at 16 years of
age, and for the following two years
remained with his parents, assisting
his father in the storekeeping busi-
ness carried on by that gentleman.
At the end of this period he became
apprenticed to the engineering
trade, serving a term of four years
with the Phoenix Engineering Com-
pany at Ipswich. At 22 he was
transferred to the University of
Sydney, where he further pursued
his studies in the higher branches of
engineering for about 12 months.
Upon his return to Marburg he
found that his father’s enterprise
had expanded in a surprising
manner, and the late Mr. Fred-
erich being in urgent need of
reliable assistance, at this juncture
found his son a most capable and
willing, co-operator. By degrees the
younger man assumed more and more
the responsibility of management,
and eventually took complete control
not only of the storekeeping busi-
ness, with its various depart-
ments, but also of the creamery,
from which the present butter
factory has developed. This posi-
tion of superintendent he filled very
adequately until 1909, when about
six months prior to the demise of
his father he took over the whole
business, and has since conducted it

the old-type machinery at the butter
factory was condemned to removal
to make room for installations of
modern design, by means of which
both the quantity and quality of
the output have been materially
improved. The factory has always
been noted for the excellence of its
products, and as early as 1909
achieved an eminent triumph in
securing a valuable trophy in the
shape of a silver cup and medal
awarded for colonial butter at the
Islington Dairy Show, London, this
being in open competition against
business established by Mr. Fred-
erich’s father continued to flourish
under the management of his son
for a number of years, but in 1915,
owing to the pressure of other
interests, this was taken over by
another proprietor. At one period
Mr. Frederick entered into partner-
ship relations with a younger
brother, Mr. H. P. Frederick, of
Mudgeeraba, but this connection
has since been dissolved. In addi-
tion to control of the butter factory,
he farms about 350 acres of land,
the greater part of which is situated
at Currumbin Creek, close to the
New South Wales border. Owing
to the distance of this property
from his home at Townshend, Mr.
Frederick has leased it on the share
system to a tenant, who has met
the Frederich family, reproduction

old home in the latter district,
which, like others of the same
period, was constructed entirely of
bush timber. Here the subject of
this review was born. Contrasting
with this humble abode is the view
of Mr. Frederich’s present residence
at Townshend, situated on a hill over-
looking the town, and protected by
hedges and shade trees from the
dust and noise of the main
road, which runs past the garden
enclosure. Mr. Frederich takes a
keen interest in the public affairs
of the district, and is vice-
president of the local Agricultural
and Industrial Association, in which
he held the presidency for two years.
He is a member of the State school
committee, and of the progress
association, of which he is treasurer.
For some years he was captain of
the Marburg Rifle Club, and has
earned the reputation of being one
of the crack shots of the district.
Steering clear of the quicksands of
politics, he has worked earnestly
for the advancement of every
worthy movement in the neighbour-
hood, and takes a prominent
interest in the local Anglican
Church, in which he is a lay reader
and superintendent of the Sunday-
school. He is a very successful

Dr. E. Sirois’ PRIVATE HOS-
PITAL, Townshend (formerly Mar-
burg). This fine institution', which
owes its excellence to Dr. Sirois,
occupies two acres of ground on
the slope of a hill overlooking
the town, and presents the appear-
ance of a big pile of buildings
topped with a red - tiled roof.
From the verandahs which sur-
round the structure magnificent
scenery meets the eye, and the
locality is pre-eminently a healthy
one, abounding in fresh air and
bright surroundings, and all that
conduces to restoration to physical
fitness among those who seek this
favoured spot. The hospital is very
spacious, measuring 121 feet by 81
feet, and contains 22 rooms, includ-
ing a fine dining-room, bedroom
accommodation for 12 patients, and
various other apartments. Staircases
lead up to a large, airy balcony
room, and down to the laundry and
cooling rooms underneath. A splen-
didly-appointed surgery adjoins the
laboratory, which is equipped with
many of the latest scientific, medical,
and surgical accessories from all
parts of the ■world, and the three
bathrooms, fitted with enamel baths,
are also deserving of mention. Very
careful attention has been given to
the sanitary arrangements, which
have been contrived on a system
only recently introduced to Aus-

been installed. The doctor’s private
residence adjoins the hospital, whilst
near the entrance gate, amidst shade
trees and flower-beds, a motor
garage has been erected. The hospi-
tal has been open for about six
years, and has fully justified Dr.
Sirois’ enterprise in carrying out a
scheme which at the outside was
Canada, in 1854, and was educated at
the latter city and at Montreal. He
became a student of dentistry, and
at the completion of his course
entered the University of Bishop
College, which was amalgamated
with the McGill University, Mon-
treal, where he took his diploma in
1883. Prior to this date, in 1881, he
was awarded first prize in anatomy,
and in 1883 gained the Chancellor’s
Prize (securing the greatest aggre-
gate of marks in all branches of
study). Subsequently he practised
for a year in Montreal, and for 10
years in Massachusetts, following
which he spent 15 years in his pro-
fession at Denver, Colorado. He
came to Queensland in 1909, and in
spite of warnings that no medical
practitioner had ever received suffi-
cient support to enable him to remain
at Townshend, decided to make
a trial residence in the district. In
1912 he began the erection of the
fine hospital buildings, in itself con-
clusive evidence that the doctor had
come to stay, and has since found
his time fully occupied with the
varied demands of his practice. It
may not be generally known that the

MICHAEL BAKER, “Green

Brisbane, Queensland, on May 8,
1875, and is the youngest son of
Mr. Jacob Baker, a native of

experiences of his voyage to the
antipodes relates how, even after
the anchor was weighed, the vessel,
the “Daniel Russ,” a schooner of
light tonnage, lay beached for six
weeks before finally setting sail for
Australia, where she arrived after a
trip extending over nearly five
months. Landing at Sydney, Mr.
Baker continued his voyage to
Moreton Bay, having received a
guarantee of employment during
his brief stay in the New South
Wales capital. His earliest employer
was a member of the well-known
MacDonald family, of “Broad-
water” and “Bromelton” Stations,
in what was then the Tenterfield dis-
trict of the Mother State—now the
Southern Downs of Queensland. He
had an eventful trip over the range,
doing the journey by means of a
bullock team, and nearly two
months elapsed before the party
with which he was travelling
reached Warwick. Mr. Baker,
hh *
though entirely inexperienced as a
bush hand, showed his grit from
the first, doing more than his share
of the work incidental to the trip;
and upon arrival at the station he
was soon transferred from the
duties of shepherd, for which he
had been engaged, to the post of
“handy man” and general assistant
in station work, in which he con-
tinued for about two years. Sub-
sequently he was engaged in the
agricultural industry in the locality
where the old racecourse now stands,
at a later period being one of the
best-known identities of Ipswich,
where with his own team he sup-
plied the residents with wood and
water, in times of drought the
latter having to be carted to the
various homesteads. As a shearer
Mr. Baker won a considerable repu-
tation, few of the old-time shearers
of Queensland being better known.
He filled up the slack periods
with work around his home at
Ipswich, and in the late seventies
held a position of trust in the
boiling-down works established by
Mr. R. J. Smith in that town.
About 1874 he selected a block of
80 acres, surrounding the spot
where the “Green Vale” homestead
now stands, and subsequently from
time to time added to this holding
by purchase or selection until he
owned an area of some 400 acres,
which at the time of his retirement
from active pursuits passed into the
hands of his youngest son. The
development of this property Mr.
Baker entrusted chiefly to his grow-
ing family, himself filling a position

skill in erecting windmills, repairing
sheds, etc., making him invaluable
in this capacity. He was also
similarly employed at various times

all that he undertook, and wherever

surrounded. In his various enter-
prises Mr. Baker was ably seconded
by his late wife, Frances, daughter
of the late Thomas McGaghran, of
Ireland, another of the good old
pioneers of Queensland, whose good
works live in the generation follow-
ing after. Mrs. Baker, who was a
native of Ireland, left a family of
five sons and three daughters, of
whom the sons are all on the land,
and the daughters married to
farmers in the district. Mr. Michael
Baker received his education at the
Grandchester State School, and
at 14 years of age started work on
the home farm, where he has con-
tinned ever since. Upon the retire-
merit of his father he took over the


property, which he has since con-
ducted on his own account as a
mixed farm, in normal seasons
making a prominent feature of
dairying. He married in 1904
Catherine, daughter of Mr. Henry
Fullekrug, a settler of half a cen-
tury’s standing in the Grandchester
district, and has four sons.
CARL FREDERICK WIL-
HELM GEHRKE, “Sunnyside,”
Gehrkevale, via Grandchester, is a
native of Germany, having been
born in the district of Templean-a-
Kries, on January 2, 1862. He is
the eldest son of the late Carl
Frederich August Gehrke, who was
identified with the agricultural
industry in his native land for a
number of years, but whose subse-
quent experience of hardship and
misery in connection with his term
of service as a conscript in the
German Army during the Franco-
Prussian War determined him on a
drastic change in his manner and
sphere of life —the desire to protect
his sons from the system of militar-
ism which held sway in his native
land being one of the prevailing
motives leading him to this resolve.
Casting round for a region where
freedom and peace held undivided
sway, Mr. Gehrke’s choice fell upon

settlement and development of her
vast, untouched areas, which were

ment in this portion of the island -
continent of Australia, and after a
voyage extending over 16 weeks
arrived at their destination early in
the year 1871. Landing at the port
of Maryborough, the late Mr.
Gehrke found occupation in the
timber industry in that neighbour-
hood for about six months, being
chiefly engaged at a sawmill which
had been established in the town,
then little more than a village with
a mere handful of houses. When
this period had elapsed he removed
farther south, and secured employ-
ment as a shepherd on Mr. George
Thorn’s “Normanby” Station, near
Ipswich, where he remained for a
number of years. When the estate
of “Rosevale,” on the Bremer
River, was thrown open for selec-
tion, he was numbered amongst
the earliest of the settlers to
recognize the possibilities of the
locality, and lost no time in taking
up a block of land, upon which he
settled down, devoting the remain-
der of his years to the farming
industry upon this estate. To such
pioneering veterans as the late Mr.
Gehrke the most abundant honour
and credit are due from native-born
Queenslanders, since in times of
peace they have devoted their best
energies to developing the resources

Gehrke, with his wife and family
of two sons and three daugh-
ters, set sail by the good ship
“Herschell,” which historic vessel
played an important part in
of a great but crude country under
the aegis of British protection.
Added to their valuable services in
this peaceful work of empire-build-
ing, many have given the extreme


proof of their loyalty since the out-
break of the present European War,
and among these the present pro-
prietor of “Sunnyside” has yielded
the dearest possession of a man—his
own son—to fight for the flag his
father elected to live under close on
half t, century ago. The late Mr.
Gehrke resided at “Rosevale” until
his demise in 1908, when he passed
away in the seventy-second year of
his age, leaving behind him a worthy
reputation as a man of integrity,
wisdom, and capacity, who among
many other wdse and loyal actions
instilled into his descendants a love
and fealty to the country wdiich in
the days of her infancy extended to
him an open-handed welcome when
he chose her shores upon which to
establish a home where future
generations of his name might enjoy
the blessings of liberty and peace.
Mr. Carl Frederich Wilhelm Gehrke,
the subject of this review, was in his

in this industry until 15 years of
age, by which time he was earning
20s. a week, and finally relinquished
his position on the cotton plantation
for the sake of improving his finan-
cial outlook by assuming the duties
of assistant stockman on “Taroom,”
an outstation of “Fassifern,” then
under the management of the late
Mr. Weinholt. Subsequently Mr.
Gehrke was employed in a similar
capacity on “Bundango” Station, in
the Roma district, and later still
took charge of the horses on
“Burinda” Station, on the Warrego,
his next experience being in sheep-
droving from the lastnamed pro-
perty. Following this departure, he
settled down for a short time on his
father’s farm, but the spirit of
adventure and personal indepen-
dence being strong within him, he
soon cut himself adrift from home
once more, and whilst yet only in
his teens started off with a mate,
overlanding horses to Rockhampton.

on a cotton farm, where he worked
in the capacity of picker at a wage
of 2s. 6d. a week. He continued
him under the parental roof-tree.
Soon after his recovery Mr. Gehrke
took up a homestead block, compris-
ing 160 acres, upon which his present


residence stands, the modern struc-
ture having replaced in 1905 the
old original dwelling of slab and

by pasture lands and cultiva-
tion fields to the extent of 1,600
acres. The old adage of “Like
father, like son,” was exemplified in
the case of the Gehrke family in
their early struggles to establish
themselves, and as much credit is
due to the younger man as to the
older for the strenuous endeavour
by which he succeeded, amid many
reverses, to build up the fabric of
his fortune, and to found a home for
future generations upon the virgin
soil of his adopted country. Among
the obstacles with which he had to
combat were the native pests, the
place being infested with dingoes
and kangaroos. The task of keep-
ing the marsupials from destroying
the young growing crops was
at times well nigh insuperable,
while farmyard fowls, young stock,
etc,, were continually falling victims
to the ravages of the native dogs,
which were both fierce and ravenous.
However, by degrees these and other
troubles were overcome, and to-day
Mr. Gehrke is cited in the neigh-
bourhood as an example of the
intrepid settler who meets with
undaunted front the “slings and
arrows of unwieldy fortune,” and
works out his salvation in the face
of every throwback. His property,
which is known as “Sunnyside,”
originally formed part of the “Frank -
lyn Vale” pastoral run, this portion
going under the name of “Spring
Creek.” It is situated about 14
miles south of Grandchester, which
is the nearest railway station com-
manding a daily train service, and
that chiefly used by inmates of the
farm. Some 60 acres have been
brought under the plough, and this
area is mainly devoted to the culti-
vation of lucerne, maize, sorghum,
and other useful fodder crops for
the nourishment of the dairy cattle.
In ordinary seasons the dairy herd
numbers about 60 head, but in 1915-6
the dry conditions, the bush fires,
and lack of pasturage, reduced this
fine herd down to seven milch cows,
sole remnant of the handsome brows-
ing denizens of the pastures some
year or two agone, although upon
the estate is still to be found a
small herd of pure-bred stud Illa-
warras, which forms one of the most
attractive features of the industry
carried on by Mr. Gehrke. These
show the finest possible quality,
having been derived from the best
of the famous herds of New South
Wales, and in these animals Mr.
Gehrke possesses perfect material for
the foundation of another dairy
herd of ample proportion to take
the place of that which once was
the pride of “Sunnyside” and a
lucrative source of income to the
proprietor. The homestead may be
described as a model farmhouse, of

was attended to personally by Mr.
Gehrke, who for about three years
after its acquirement resided in the
paternal home, and whilst straining
every nerve to place himself upon a


satisfactory financial footing by
carrying out fencing contracts and
ringbarking on neighbouring pro-
perties, with such other outside
work as was available, employed his
intervals of leisure in improving his
holding under the terms of the Act
then in operation. At 23 he mar-
ried, and took up his abode on the
selection which has been the scene
of his home for about a quarter of
a century, following which impor-
tant step eventuated a run of hard-
ships, compared with which the
difficult and trying experiences of
his earlier life faded into insignifi-
cance. At times even the actual
necessaries of life were wanting in
the young settlers’ home, and very
careful management was required to
make it possible even to keep a roof
over their heads; indeed, to the
farmers of the present day those who
wrested homes for themselves out of
the virgin bush in Queensland a
generation or more back were almost
“supermen,” so rare a combination
of qualities was needed to enable
them to win through. Great of
heart, however, and of iron deter-
mination, Mr. Gehrke never for a
moment faltered in the pursuit of
his ultimate aim, and now as from
his comfortable home he surveys the
well-improved acres in the valley,

realizes to the full the satisfaction
of the man who has “made

now rest on his oars, awaiting
the evening of life with an easy
mind, and enjoying the respect
and esteem of his fellow-residents in
the district which he has done so
much to advance, for Mr. Gehrke’s
interests have ever been the interests
of the community at large, and he
has made the welfare of the neigh-
bourhood a matter of earnest and
practical consideration. At one
time or another he has filled most
of the positions of honour and
responsibility connected with the
public life of the place, among other
offices for a considerable time having
occupied that of vice-president of
the local branch of the Farmers’
Union, while frequently he has
declined to serve on committees, etc.,
when requested to do so. He was a
member of the local school committee
for five years, and in recognition of
his bestowal of the land for a school
site and his initiation of the original
movement towards securing educa-
tional facilities for the youth of the
district from the Government, he
was honoured by the ratepayers, who
passed a resolution giving the name
of “Gehrkevale” to the school and
district, thus showing their appreci-
ation of his services in this and
many other directions. Another
great boon brought about by Mr.
Gehrke’s special intervention was
the direct postal service to the
immediate district, in the obtaining
of which he was the prime mover;
and in a thousand smaller ways he
has proved himself the friend of his
fellow-citizens, realizing that upon
each is laid the duty of conserving
the interests of the whole. He has
been twice manned. His first wife,
to whom he was united in 1885, was
Bertha, daughter of the late Ferdi-
nand Schonfisch, who, like himself,
was one of the best-known of the
settlers on the “Rosevale” Estate,
and a pioneer of the district. By
this marriage there are six sons and
three daughters surviving. The late
Mrs. Gehrk© died in 1908, and sub-
sequently Mr. Gehrke wedded her
sister, Wilhelmina, fourth daughter
of the above-mentioned gentleman,
the issue being two daughters. Of
the sons the oldest, August Otto

suits in the west country; the

he was compelled, though a married
man and father of a family, to
serve three years in the G-erman

realization that better prospects for
his sons were offering in the over-

fencing, ploughing, and general
father until he had attained man’s
estate, when his younger brothers
being able to take his place, he
launched out on independent lines
by leasing a farm of some 300 acres
at Gehrkevale, the property of
Messrs. Cribb & Foote. This farm
he worked for close on a decade,
doing a great deal of careful develop-
ment work, and by rigid economy,
denying himself of all but the
barest necessities of life, was able to
save nearly £3OO as a result of his
strenuous toil and well-sustained
effort during this period. With this
capital in hand he entered into part-
nership with his eldest brother (since
deceased), purchasing a farm of two
hundred acres at Rosevale, which
was carried on by the two brothers
in conjunction for three years. The
partnership was then dissolved by
mutual consent, and Mr. W. A.
Zahnow shortly afterwards became
the proprietor of his present hold-
ing, known as “Spring Creek” Farm,
formerly owned by Mr. Kelly, who
was the original settler on the block.
It comprises 160 acres of very fine
land, and is situated in a locality
approached by good roads from
Grandchester railway station, some
12 miles distant. Mr. Zahnow has

an excellent conservation system is

displays abundant evidences of
skilled and careful management, and
reflects great credit on the proprie-
tor and his two elder sons, who
assist him in all the operations
carried on. The family resides still
in the old original homestead, which
was built by Mr. Zahnow with his
own hands when he first took posses-
sion of the holding. Of unpreten-
tious appearance, it is homely and
comfortable, and although the
scheme of erecting a residence of
modern design has been mooted, and
will probably be carried out in the
near future, the present habitation
satisfies the needs of the occupants,
and is rendered dear by many
associations to those who have spent
so many years under the shelter of
its roof. Mr. Zahnow is a man of
quiet temperament, and while taking
a deep and sincere interest in the
affairs of the district in which he
resides, is apt to hold aloof from
those organizations, membership in
which involves a certain amount of
public responsibility. He has long
been a student of the principles of
co-operation as applied to the farm-
ing industry, and is a shareholder in

The late THOMAS BOURKE, of
“Brompton Lea,” Hatton Vale. The
subject of this memoir, who may
fitly be referred to as the pioneer of
the Hatton Vale district, where he
was the first selector of land, was a
native of Ireland, his birth taking
place at Soart, Tipperary, on June
10, 1837. As a young man he was
frequently a listener to conversa-
tion anent the wonderful prospects
offering in the vast, undeveloped con-
tinent of Australia, whither*some of
his friends and acquaintances had
already taken their flight. Follow-
ing the example of these enterprising
spirits, Mr. Bourke in 1863 took
passage by the sailing vessel “Ever-
ton Journal,” bound for Queensland,
and leaving the land of his birth
on November 1 of the above-
mentioned year, arrived at his desti-
nation in the following February.
His experiences after landing at
Moreton Bay included initiation
into almost the whole range of
avocations open to a young man
physically fit and lacking in neither
ability nor perseverance, whose
inclination disposed him to an out-
door life. Making his way out

known figure in the shearing sheds,
and enjoying to the full any spice of
adventure which lent additional

colour to an existence by no means
wanting in interest or excitement.
To the last Mr. Bourke loved to find
for talk among the bronzed and
bearded knights of the spur and
stirrup, or wielders of the shears,
giving way to even more stirring
themes when some specially thrilling
encounter with the blacks was noised
abroad throughout the land. Upon
the discovery of gold at Gympie
Mr. Bourke, like hosts of others,
exchanged the shearer’s blade for the
sharp pick of the miner, being among
the first on the field when the initial
rush took place. His luck varied,
but he soon became convinced that
the mining camp offered too few
attractions to make the game worth
the candle, and accordingly he
returned from Gympie and took up
his first selection at Western Creek,
where he carried on farming pur-
suits very successfully for a time.
Eventually the little-known district
of Hatton Vale came under his
notice, and being impressed with the
possibilities of the country in this
locality he selected a large area of
land near the Woolshed Creek. Upon
this virgin holding he expended the
best efforts of his manhood, and had
the satisfaction of establishing there

an audience for the tales which he
could recount of those early days on
the Downs, when the “mettle of the
pasture” furnished a prolific topic
prosperous farms of the district,
residing upon the property until the
time of his decease in 1915. Whilst
pushing his own enterprise forward


in every possible direction the late
Mr. Bourke gave much thought and
attention to the development of the
infant district on the best possible
lines, and as settlers began to
multiply he made the first move in
educational matters, the establish-
ment of the school at Hatton Vale
being largely due to his endeavours.
He also consented to become the
earliest postal officer in the district,
receiving and despatching Her
Majesty’s mails for some consider-
able time. The principle of co-opera-
tion appealed to him strongly, and
that his influence carried great
weight is evidenced by the number
of companies instituted for the
mutual benefit of the residents of
the district. In the early days of
the Co-operative Butter Factory he
concerned himself actively with the
establishment of a local creamery;
and was largely instrumental in the
formation of the Co-operative Cattle
Dip Company at Hatton Vale, in
which he was the largest share-
holder. He was also one of the
leading members of the local pro-
gress association, which owed much
to his wise expression of opinions on
matters affecting public welfare.
Mr. Bourke married in 1878 Mar-
garet, daughter of the late James
Ahearn, of Mount Walker, a dis-
trict in near vicinity to Hatton
Vale, where Mrs. Bourke’s father,
who was descended from a very
ancient Irish family, did yeoman
service as a pioneer of the early days,
not the least of which was the bring-
ing up of a large family to carry on
his name and work. Like many
other plucky women of her time, Mrs.
Bourke sacrificed the comforts and
advantages of life in a civilized
centre to share with her husband the
hardships inseparable from the lot of
settlers intent upon opening up new
territory and carving homes for
themselves and their families out of
the primitive bush. The mother of
a family of seven —two sons and five
daughters—she toiled for her child-
ren, and nobly supported her hus-
band in all his schemes both of a
public and private character, never
sparing herself, and looking for
reward only in the affection and
loyalty of those on whose behalf her
busy days were spent. Mrs. Bourke
resides with her two sons and two
daughters at the old homestead,
which lies some eight or nine miles
distant from the Grandchester rail-
way station. Her sons carry on the
management of the property, which
comprises about 1.600 acres, and is
used chiefly as a grazing and dairy-
ing proposition; and though mourn-
ing the loss of her chief friend and
companion, the brave pioneer-mother
finds consolation in the presence of
her children, and in their interests
forgets her own sorrow.
CARL ALBERT JOHN TIL-
LACK, “Hillside,” Hatton Vale,
was born on November 10, 1878, his
native place being Liptoft, Ger-
many, where his father, the late
Carl Frederick Tillack, was engaged
on the land, and also in the fishing
industry, which was one of the staple
occupations of the district. Hear-
ing good reports of the prospects
offered to settlers in Australia, he
decided to emigrate, and landed at
MR. CARK FREDERICK TILLACK.
Brisbane in 1882, at which date the
gentleman under review was only
four years of age. Mr. Tillack, sen.,
entered the employ of the late Mr.
Westling on his farm at Hatton
Vale, and after continuing there for
12 months purchased a block of 80
acres in the near vicinity of the
present “Hillside” Estate. The
country was covered with scrub, and
with only one son old enough to give
any assistance the new settler had
uphill work at first in preparing the
soil for culivation. Putting his
shoulder to the wheel, however, in
true pioneer fashion in the course of
four years he had completed clearing
operations over half the total area
of his holding, and from the first
had started cultivation of the soil,
planting corn and maize in primi-
tive style with a hoe. As the subject
of this notice, Mr. C. A. J. Tillack,
grew old enough, he took his share
of duties on the farm, and having
terminated his studies at the Hatton
Vale Public School at about 12
years of age, gave his whole atten-
tion to the work of clearing and
cropping the remainder of the pro-
perty. Upon the retirement of his
father in 1900 he took over the whole
management of affairs, about two
years later acquiring an additional
area of 54 acres adjoining the old
homestead block, where he continued
to reside until 1913. In that year
Mr. Tillack purchased “Hillside,”
and removed his residence to the new
estate, since which date he has
carried on both properties, his opera-
tions comprising mixed farming in
its various branches, dairying and
maize growing receiving special
attention. Mr. Tillack also engages
in the breeding of horses, particu-
larly of the trotting strain, the
stallion “Young Major Bull,” by the
noted trotting stallion “Major Bull,”
being one of the most successful pro-
ducts of his stud. A man of public
spirit, Mr. Tillack has associated
himself with various organizations
founded for the advancement of the
district, and is a director of the
Hatton Vale Co-operative Cattle
Dip Company, a member of the local
school committee, and a member of
the local progress association. In
1899 he married Anna Matilda,
daughter of Mr. John Schultz, a

pioneer of Redbank, and subse-
quently for about 30 years a
respected resident of the Hillside
district. There are three sons and
four daughters of the marriage.


PAUL OTTO PETERS, of “Hat-
ton Farm,” Hatton Vale, was born
on May 25, 1875, in the Logan dis-
trict, where his father, the late
Wilhelm Peters, was engaged in
farming occupations for some years.
Originally sprung from a family of
British descent, Wilhelm Peters
was born and brought up in Ger-
many, whence he emigrated to
Queensland, where he arrived in the
year 1870. Here he obtained employ-
ment from the Government in road-
making in and around Brisbane, and
in the north coastal region, where
everything was in a very primitive
condition, as indeed were many of
the main highways leading right to
the heart of the metropolis. In
1880 the late Mr. Peters settled
down on his own farm at Hatton
Vale, where he was preceded by only
one selector, and during the three
decades that marked his sojourn in
this district he earned the respect
and esteem of all those with whom
he came into contact, and brought
up a family of 15 young Australians,
nearly all of whom have followed the
example of their father and settled
on the land. The subject of this
notice, Mr. P. O. Peters, received
his education at the Hatton Vale
Public School, and at the termina-
tion of his studies was taken in hand
by his father, the worthy pioneer
making it his custom to keep his sons
on the farm until they attained their
majority. In this way young Peters
good stead in the ups and downs of
life. At 21 he proceeded farther
afield, and was engaged in farming
pursuits in different parts of the
State for a couple of years. At the

end of 1898 he returned to the
scenes of his boyhood, and accepted
the appointment of manager of the
Hatton Vale Farmers’ Co-operative
Dairying Company at that centre,
which he carried on successfully
until several years later the drought
of 1902-3 necessitated a cessation of
operations. Resigning his position,
he purchased the farm adjoining his
of the years, and enjoyed with him
the success eventually attained,
when it became necessary to make
changes in the administration of the
home property. Mr. Peters accord-
ingly purchased all his father’s
interests in “Hatton Farm,” and
settled in the old home, where he
watched over his parent’s declining
days, and sheltered the younger
members of the family until they
went into the world on their own
account. He is a well-known sup-
porter of all movements set afoot
for the advancement of the district,
is chairman of the Platton Vale
Cattle Dip Company, hon. secretary
of the local school committee, a past
officer of the Hatton Vale Progress
Association, and secretary to the
Hatton Vale Lutheran Church,
where he has officiated as organist
for a quarter of a century, taking
a deep interest in its progress.
He married in 1903 Theresa,
daughter of the late C. A. J.
Tillack, of the same district;
and has five sons and two daughters.
Like their father, who is an excellent
exponent of the violin, the whole
family is very musical, and play
various instruments with great taste
and skill.

estate, when he decided to try his
fortune in the land of the Southern
Cross, whither a brother and sister
had already preceded him. Arriving
at Queensland in the year 1881, he
first turned his hand to the develop-
mental work proceeding on his
brother’s farm, then hardly emerged
from its virgin state, and having
gained a good knowledge of local
conditions during the three years
spent on this property, directed his
attention to the acquirement of a
holding on his own behalf. He was
successful in finding a block of
unimproved land in the Hatton
Vale district, which he saw would
suit his purposes admirably, and
entering upon its occupation, pro-
ceeded at once in a whole-hearted
manner upon the strenuous toil
necessary to its preparation for agri-
culture. Spite of the primitive
methods of farming then in vogue
in the young country, Mr, Schlecht
made excellent headway, and whilst
continuing to reside at "Sunnyside,”
as he called the parent property,
was able to watch his opportunity
to secure adjacent blocks as they
were offered for sale. Fie also pur-
chased a portion of the old "Tar-
ampa” Station when it was divided
for closer settlement, upon which
he later settled his elder sons, whom
he had initiated into mixed-farming
and dairying methods upon the
home farm. The Hatton Vale dis-
trict was but a few years old on the
advent of Mr. Schlecht, who has
taken a most loyal interest in its
advancement, associating himself
with every movement making for
progress and prosperity. His efforts,
in conjunction with those of the
other pioneer settlers, led to the
establishment of the first public
school at Hatton Vale. He was
one of the founders of the Hat-
ton Vale Co-operative Dairying
Company, and was also concerned
in the founding of the Hatton Vale
Co-operative Cattle Dip Company,
filling the office of chairman for some
considerable time. From the incep-
tion of the Lockyer Agricultural
Society Mr. Schlecht has served as a
committeeman, receiving election to
the presidential chair in the year
1913. He was one of the earliest
members of the Tarampa Shire Coun-
cil, and retained his seat for nearly
three years, when severance from
that body was granted to the dis-
trict, which then became part of
Laidley Shire, after which he was
returned by the ratepayers of Hat-
ton Vale to represent them on the
latter council, and has since from
time to time been elected unopposed.
He has occupied a seat on the board

his many other offices has exercised
the Commission of the Peace since
1901. In 1914 the residents of the
district testified their appreciation
of the invaluable part which Mr.
Schlecht had taken in the building
up of its prosperity by making him
a public presentation, and conferred
at the same time a similar honour

great service to the community by
undertaking in an honorary capacity
attendance on a public telephone
granted to Hatton Vale by the
department, which duties she carried
out without any remuneration for
seven years, and still retains this
post. Mr. Schlecht has been twice
married, his former wife being Con-
stantia, daughter of the late Igna-
tius Zelinski, an early pioneer of
the Tarampa district. The present


partner of his life is Elizabeth,
daughter of the late John Smolensk!
who died at Brisbane shortly after
his arrival in this State among the
Polish emigrants of a long-past era.
The issue of both unions is five sons
and four daughters.
CARL FREDERICK WIL-
HELM HARCH, “Hillcrest,” Hat-

Germany, where he first saw the
light of day in 1865, his father, the
late Frederich Harch, having been
born and brought up in the same
district. Both father and son were

soil, which disposed them to give
special attention to the favourable
reports of agricultural enterprise in
Queensland sent to them by Mr.
Harch’s elder brother, who had left
the Old Country for Australia about
1882. The gentleman under review
accordingly set sail for the land of
the Southern Cross by the steamer
“Jumna,” which completed the trip
in eight weeks. Landing at Bris-
bane in 1888, Mr. Harch at once
proceeded to Hatton Vale, where
his brother gave him employment
for a time, subsequent to which he
worked for the late Johann Knopke
and the late Wilhelm Peters on their
respective farms. About two years
after his arrival in the district he
purchased a fairly well equipped
farm, comprising 60 acres, at Hat-
ton Vale, and after working this
area for about five years disposed of
the holding, and acquired a block
of 100 acres of scrub land at
Lowood. He immediately started
clearing operations, and by dint of
hard work eventually accomplished
the preparation of the soil for
productive purposes, but subse-
quently sold out and purchased his
present property, “Hillcrest,” at
Hatton Vale. The homestead is
beautifully situated on the top of a
high hill, overlooking the pictur-
esque flats with which the Vale
abounds, and in the cool of the
evening the wide vestibule verandah
provides a very pleasant spot for a
smoke and a chat after a hard day’s
toil. Mr. Llarch devotes his atten-
tion to mixed farming, in which
maize-growing, dairying, and the
rearing of swine are the three prin-
cipal industries; and apart from the
conduct of his private enterprise
takes considerable interest in the
public organizations of the district.
He is treasurer of the Hatton Vale
School Committee, of which he has
been an active member for many
years; and for a lengthy period has
served on the committee of the
Local Progress Association. He
is a director of the Hatton Vale
Cattle Dip Company, and a share-
holder in the butter factory at
Laidley and in the bacon factory at
Murarrie. His religious interests are
centered in the Hatton Vale
Lutheran Church, of which he is a
trustee; and all matters affecting
the welfare of the community receive
his practical consideration. Mr.

AUGUST JOHANN WILHELM
SCHLOSS, "Brandenburg” Farm,
Hatton Vale, was born at Branden-
burg, Germany, on January 28,
1857, being the third son of the late
MR. AUGUST JOHANN WILHELM SCHLOSS.
Wilhelm Schloss, a native of the
same place, where he was engaged,
like his father before him, in
farming pursuits. In 1877, as a
result of the good reports received
from his eldest son, who had emi-
grated to Australia some six years
earlier, the late Mr. Schloss decided
to follow the example of his firstborn,
and with the remaining members of
his family came to Queensland.
His first proceeding was to join
his brother-in-law, Mr. Wilhelm
Truelove, on a farm taken up by the
latter gentleman some years pre-
viously, and having spent six
months in careful observation of
local conditions, at the end of that
period he took up a block of 98
acres at Prenzlau, which being
covered with dense scrub required
strong arms and stout hearts to
undertake its development. These,
however, were not wanting, and with
his two sons the new settler faced
the problem before him in true
pioneer spirit, counting the priva-
tions of the life well met as a means
to an end. These privations included
a shortage of provisions, even flour
and water, in addition to the other
necessaries of existence, having to
be shouldered by the selectors and
carried three miles over rough
tracks to the hut in the absence of
any other means of transport. After
a few months sufficient land had been
cleared to begin cultivation, the first
crop grown being maize; and whilst
their father continued operations on

the holding Mr. August Schloss and
his brother in order to provide the
wherewithal for a living took work
on neighbouring farms, wages about
this time averaging in the vicinity of
12s. per week. In 1879 the gentle-
man under review selected an 80-
acre block at Hatton Vale, situated
about half a mile distant from his
present homestead, and later pur-
chasing an adjoining 40 acres, he
worked the whole area together for
some years. In 1904 he acquired a
further 80 acres in the same district,
of which he afterwards disposed;
and eventually in 1909 came into
possession of “Brandenburg” Farm,
comprising 70 acres, with homestead
and outbuildings, where he has con-
tinued ever since. Mr. Schloss owns
in all about 194 acres of land, and
carries on a successful mixed-farm-
ing proposition, in which maize-
growing, dairying, and pig raising

are the principal departments. He
interests himself in the general wel-
fare of the district, and for many
years has been an active member of
the Hatton Vale School Committee
whilst he is also a committeeman of
the Laidley Hospital, and formerly
was a director of the Hatton Vale
Cattle Dip Company. In 1881 he
married Maria Wilhelmina, daughter
of the late August Schultz, a very
old pioneer of the Marburg district,
and has a surviving family of three
sons and seven daughters. The two
elder sons are engaged in farming
pursuits on their own account, and
the youngest, Martin, is his father’s
right-hand man on the home
property.


The Lockyer District.
The name of Gatton is known throughout Queens-
land principally because of the agricultural college
established within 3 miles of that township in 1896.
This is easily the most important institution of its kind
in the State. Indeed, the Gatton college may fairly
be said to rank among the three or four more
important Australian places for teaching the science
of agriculture.
The township is situated on the main railway line
leading from Brisbane to Toowoomba, and is distant
some 61 miles from the metropolis. It is surrounded
by exceptionally rich farming and dairying country
which contains many permanent streams of running
water, and embraces within its area many thousands
of acres of rich, loamy, alluvial flats. The principal
products exported are potatoes, maize, pumpkins, oaten
and wheaten hay, lucerne, and other classes of fodder,
as well as butter, dairy produce generally, oranges, and
grapes. The holdings range from 640 acres each
and upwards being excellently suited in the matter
of area for an intense form of cultivation. The pros-
perity of the district of which Gatton is the centre may
be estimated from the fact that it has a population of
some 20,000 people.
Originally Gatton consisted mainly of open forest
country, but a great deal of clearing has been carried
out from time to time since the date of first settlement,
which goes back to the dawn of the history of the
State. The creek flats prove excellently adapted to
lucerne growing, the deep, root-driving properties of
that leguminous plant placing within its reach the
water lying at varying depths beneath the surface.
Artificially-planted grasses do well in almost any part
of the district, and a considerable trade is done in
breeding and fattening lambs for the overseas trade,
Border-Leicester sheep being principally in demand for
this purpose. However, a few of the Romney-Marsh
variety are also used for the same requirement. The
district is well within the belt of country having an
average rainfall of between 30 and 40 inches. In good
seasons it is perhaps the most favourable region for
successful dairying in the whole of Queensland; and
the Silverwood Butter Factory, situated within the town
of Gatton, is one of the largest and most prosperous in
the State. The town is built on the banks of Lockyer
Greek, and in close proximity to the railway station
lies Lake Clarendon, a sheet of water which has
never been known to dry, and which is well stocked with
fish and game.
Laidley is a growing town somewhat smaller than
Gatton, but surrounded with very much the same type
of excellent country and supported by the same indus-
tries, dairying and mixed farming being the main local
interests. Large quantities of many varieties of farm
produce are exported from Laidley, and among these
lucerne and potatoes predominate. Forest Hill and
Grandchester, situated on the railway line on opposite
sides of Laidley, are towns each with a few hundreds
of population. Grantham and Helidon are respec-
tively 5 and 11 miles beyond Gatton on the way to
Toowoomba. That much the same character of excel-
lent land and natural advantages generally prevail
over the whole of the districts here mentioned yield
some evidence of the magnitude of the resources of a
portion of the State adjacent alike to the markets of
Ipswich, Brisbane, and other important and populous

The presence of the agricultural college has proved
of great advantage to the farmers of the surrounding
districts. The institution usually has in training a
number of students varying from time to time from
twenty-five to double that number. The training of
these forms but a portion of the functions performed
by the college, at which numbers of investigations and
experiments are proceeding all the while with a view
to discovering, among many other things, the best
varieties of crops and grasses to grow, the most remuner-
ative methods of cultivation to follow, and the general
evolution of more successful farming methods. While
this work confers an undoubted benefit on agriculture
throughout the whole State, the gain to men carrying
on their industry in the immediate neighbourhood,
where the work of the experts is being carried out
under their very noses, as it were, must be more than
ordinary. Hence it is that the surrounding district is
so much ahead of other farming regions of the State,
not alone in prosperity, for that might be largely
accounted for by the excellent natural conditions, but
in superiority in the application of advanced methods
of management. During the twenty-two years of its
existence the Gatton College has undoubtedly been of
great benefit to the primary industries throughout
Queensland. Besides being the nearest town to the
agricultural college of the same name the township of
Gatton contains within its boundary the site of a State
high school, to which pupils are taken from all the
surrounding districts.

eventually died near Newcastle about
a half a century ago, after doing his
share towards pioneering the agri-
cultural industry in the land of hie
adoption. The subject of this notice
was born at what was then known
as Irishtown, at the head of the
Williams River, in the Raymond
Terrace district of New South Wales,
the date of hie birth being May 20,
1842. He received his education at
the local public school, but leaving
this institution before entering his
teens, continued his studies by
attending night classes whilst engag-
ing in farming occupations by day.
When only 16 years of age he was
living on his own selection in the
virgin bush, and conducting a suc-
cessful dairying proposition whilst
continuing with unabated energy the
development of his holding. Not
satisfied with this achievement, he
left his little farm in charge of
another, and set his face northwards,

Logan, was among the earliest of the
free settlers who emigrated from
Ireland to the Mother State of
“GREY FRIARS” HOMESTEAD, FOREST HILL.
Only two days after joining this
brother he made his choice of a
block of 160 acres, situated at Gold
himself with only the assistance of e
small boy; but notwithstanding the
fact that the crop had to be sown in


some instances between fallen logs,
these early struggles were rewarded
by payable results. As an instance
of the energy and enterprise dis-
played by Mr. Logan in pursuit of
prosperity at this time, it need only
be mentioned that while his crops
were growing he was among the
early arrivals on the field after the
first discovery of tin at Stanthorpe,
where his efforts in prospecting were
of an unsuccessful nature. As a
consequence he turned his hand to
other bush avocations, and within
three months after his first arrival
was able to secure one of the first
town allotments in that locality,
subsequently returning to attend to
his crops near Brisbane. At a later
date Mr. Logan was engaged in the
carrying business in connection
with the timber industry, contract-
ing for Government work as well as
employing a large share of time in
this way on his own account. Mis-
fortune, alike through natural causes
and through speculation, eventually
compelled him to dispose of his pro-
perty near the coast, and coming to
the Forest Hill district he selected
from the Government lands which
were thrown open to settlers a
portion of the old “Rosewood”
Station, to which he gave the name
of "Grey Friars.” This property has
formed the home of the Logan
family ever since, and by the high
character and excellent example set
by its founder has proved a centre
whence has radiated a host of the
best sort of influences. The root-
principle of Mr. Logan’s life was
late James Josey, of Redbank
Plains, near Ipswich, who was num-
bered among the pioneers of the pas-
toral industry in this State, having
arrived in Queensland from England

his native land to follow to Australia
his son, Mr. N. J. Westegard Nielsen,
who preceded his father to the land
at Laidley Creek, where he lived
respected and honoured by his fellow-
pioneers and their descendants until
his demise, at the age of 89, on
September 5, 1913. The gentleman
under review was born at Lolland,
one of the group of islands which
comprise the State of Denmark, on
April 27, 1851, and continued to
reside in the country of his birth
until his twenty-first year, when 12
months after the departure of his
father and other members of the
family he, too, sailed for the anti-
podes, and joined his relatives in
farming pursuits in the above-men-
tioned locality. The early days of
his advent to Queensland were days
of strenuous toil, but he was suc-
cessful in building up a home for
the older and younger members of
the group. This accomplished he
joined his brother, Mr. Westegard
Nielsen, well known in connection
with land enterprise in Queensland,
and as secretary for many years to
the Queensland Pastoral Association.
For a time he was - associated with
this brother in the western district,
gaining general station experience,
but relinquished the connection
in 1880 in order to take up
and energy to improving this pro-
perty, which was part of the old

a homestead lease comprising 160
acres, which he proceeded to clear
and prepare for cultivation purposes.
After devoting much time, money,
which had been tested by the fer-
tility of surrounding cultivated
blocks, and his small farm of 40
acres at Laidley Creek East, which


he purchased unimproved at £8 per
acre, soon gave satisfactory results.
As circumstances brightened he dis-
posed of this holding and purchased
other properties, three of the best
farming propositions in the dis-
trict being of his selection and
development ere they passed into
other hands. In 1899 he left Laid-
ley Creek and purchased 170 acres
at Forest Hill from Mr. J. Redmond.
Mr. Nielsen met with a serious acci-
dent in 1911, injuring his arms by a
fall in the course of his worF, and this
misfortune necessitated his parting
with his agricultural land, which he
was able to do at a profit of
over 100 per cent, on the price he
had originally paid for it. The
following year he retired from active
participation in land settlement,
and taking up his residence at
Forest Hill speculated in town pro-
perties for a time, but finding this
class of investment on the whole
unprofitable, and moreover unsuited
to his particular business capacity,
he turned his attention to grazing,
acquiring a run for this purpose in
the .Normanby district of Central
Queensland, which he stocked with
cattle, and placed his youngest son,
who also became a selector in the
same locality, in charge of opera-
tions there. Mr. Nielsen continues
to reside at Forest Hill, where he
has distinguished himself for the
interest he takes in the various
organizations having as their object

tion of that body; and has filled the
office of district chairman of the West

Union. He is the present chairman
of the Forest Hill Progress Asso-
ciation; and for six years past has
occupied a seat in the Laidley Shire
Council. Mr. Nielsen revisited the
home of his childhood in 1910, on
which occasion he took a trip to
England, and saw many places of
historical interest. He was married
in 1883 to Sarah Jane, daughter of
CANTRELL NIELSEN, '‘Waver-
ley,” Forest Hill, eldest son of the
foregoing gentleman, was born at
Laidley Creek East on November 20,
1884, and received his education at
various State schools in the district.
At the close of his studies, upon
entering his teens he joined his
father on the home farm, and subse-
quently accompanied his parents to
Forest Hill. At 21 years of age he
took on lease a farm from his uncle,
Mr. J. M. A. Redmond, and worked
this property on his own account
until the opportunity occurred to
purchase his present holding from
Mr. A. Brittain at the high price of
£lB per acre, a record figure in 1906.
The result abundantly vindicated
Mr. Nielsen’s judgment, and at the
present time (1915), in virtue of the
scientific development which has
marked his occupation the land has
risen in value to £3O per acre. He
also continued the improvement of
his leasehold, which at that period
was virgin soil, and during the five
years that he held it has obtained
very excellent returns. The “Waver-
ley” farm is devoted chiefly to
lucerne, maize, etc., although other
crops are also produced successfully.

the cultivation of sugarcane, maize,
and bananas. He married a daugh-
ter of the late Thomas Logan, of
Newcastle, New South Wales, and
sister of the late Whitmore Logan, of
"Grey Friars/ Forest Hill. Some
years later Mr. John Dart purchased
a property of 400 acres at Brook-
field, where he fias continued to
reside up to the present time. It
is interesting to note that Mr. W. L.
Dart’s grandfather was the pro-
prietor of one of the first sugar
mills at St. Lucia, Brisbane, in
partnership with his son William,
who also owned a mill at Redland
Bay. Mr. W. L. Dart received
his education at the Central School,
Brisbane, and at the age of 16 years
joined an elder brother who had
been assisted by their father a
short time before to take up land at
Forest Hill for farming purposes.
The two brothers worked this farm
on the share system with success,
and in course of time purchased land
from the "Rosewood” Estate, which
had been subdivided by the
Government for closer settlement
purposes. Upon this holding the
brothers erected a four - roomed
cottage, but after an interval of
time Mr. W. L. Dart acquired a
further area of 180 acres, situated
three miles from Forest Hill, where
he built his present homestead. He
next proceeded to lay out the farm
on methodical lines, devoting a large
portion to lucerne, and during the
years which have since elapsed
has gradually increased the area
under cultivation of this fodder until
at the present time it has reached a
total of 100 acres. Mr. Dart is
recognized as one of the largest
growers of lucerne in the State, and
has also obtained a reputation for the
superior quality of his product. The
industry and perseverance which he
has displayed in the working out of
his enterprise is beyond praise, and
the success he has attained reflects
the greatest credit upon his system of
farming. Mr. Dart owns considerable

real estate in the shape of freehold
house properties at the seaside and
at Forest Hill, besides which he is
also interested in grazing country in
the Lockyer district. It is worthy of
note that Mr. Dart began chaffcut-
ting with a plant which cost £2O, but
has so increased his output in
this department that the present
equipment, including engine and
"dumper,” is now valued at £2OO.
He takes an active interest in
the public administration of the dis-
trict, and has occupied a seat in the
Tarampa Shire Council for 12 years,
being now (1915) the second senior
councillor in that body, to which he
acted as chairman in 1911, in which
year also he was created a Justice of
the Peace by the Denham Adminis-
tration. He is secretary of the
Verdant Vale School Committee,
besides holding other public posi-
tions ; and is a prominent member
of the local Methodist Church,
which he serves as trustee and
Sunday-school superintendent. He
married in 1907 Edith Maud, eldest
daughter of Mr. J. C. A. Neilsen,
formerly of “Macclesfield” Farm,
Forest Hill, and of this union there
are two daughters and one son. Mrs.
Dart has proved herself a true help-
meet to her husband, and is one with
him in their mutual aim to fit their
children by training and education
to become useful members of the
community.


PATRICK COSTELLO, of
“Avoca,” Forest Hill, was born at
Doocastle, County Mayo, Ireland,
on January 14, 1857, and is the
eldest son of the late Thomas Cos-
tello, a representative of one of the
most ancient Irish clans, who fol-
lowed the calling of a farmer in
his native county. The gentleman
under review received his education
at the local national school, and
upon attaining the age of 14 or 15,
as befitted the eldest son of the
family, became his father’s right-
hand on the home farm. While still
in his latter teens he crossed the
Channel to England, being convinced
that the financial assistance he could
render to the family by working in
another field would be of more value
than his continued efforts on the
paternal estate. He readily found
employment in the agricultural
industry in various parts of England,
and remained in the Old Country
until the year 1882, when, tempted
by the prospect of a free, untram-
melled life, and one offering better
possibilities of advancement than
any other sphere open to him, he
turned his face towards the land of
the Southern Cross. Upon arrival
Mr. Costello took a position on a
farm, under the late Stephen Walsh,
of Laidley, a well-known pioneer of
under southern skies. By the end
of this period, having obtained a
good grip of things generally, he
leased a farm of 160 acres from Mr.
J. Whitehouse, another old identity

of the Laidley district, and set to
work to develop this holding. For
16 years he worked the proposition
successfully, and during the course
this property, to which he gave the
name “Avoca,” and here he has con-
tinued ever since, giving up the old
leasehold for the purpose of apply-
ing himself with a single aim to
the many demands of the industry
which he inaugurated with expert
knowledge and skill on his own hold-
ing. Mr. Costello now reaps the
reward of his industry and toil in
the possession of one of the most
attractive and well-managed farms
of the district, where green fields
of lucerne and other cultivation
areas, together with rich pastures
where the sleek dairy herd may be
seen browsing, indicate the direction
whence prosperity has come. The
homestead, erected by Mr. Costello
in the year above-mentioned, is
a picturesque building of modern
design, situated on a gentle slope
about a mile distant from the town
of Forest Hill, which it overlooks,
while full in view just below are
the rich acres which form the pro-
ductive portion of the farm. Mr.
Costello, though averse to publicity
of any kind, is always to the fore
in support of any movement for the
advancement of the neighbourhood
in which he resides. He married in
1886 Ellen, daughter of Mr. Martin
Carmody, of Blenheim, a descendant
of good old Irish stock, who was

year 1903 saw him established upon

the last-mentioned district, and

daughters.


ALEXANDER McALLISTER,
J.P., “Cosey,” Forest Hill, is the
eldest son of the late Alexander
McAllister, whose forbears were
among the bands of Scotsmen who
centuries ago on account of religious
disturbances left their native land
and crossed the North Channel to
make new homes for themselves on
Irish soil, where they took up farms
and devoted themselves to agricul-
ture and kindred pursuits, their
descendants for many generations
following in their footsteps. Mr. A.
McAllister was born at Cosey,
County Antrim, Ireland, on June
11, 1855, his birthplace being situ-
ated in the vicinity of the famous
Giant’s Causeway. He was educated
locally, and at the age of 14 joined
his father in the conduct of the
home farm, where he continued for
13 years, when, urged by the spirit
of adventure and the desire to secure
wider scope for his energies, he set
face in the direction of Australia.
Air. McAllister arrived at Sydney by
the “Austral” in June, 1882, but
after a few days continued the
journey to Queensland, where he
had previously determined to
settle. He gained his first experi-
ence of farming under Australian
conditions on a property owned by
the late J. Josey, at Redbank
making the most of his time decided
to apply his energies to the sugar
industry. Plaving worked on a
sugar plantation at Chelmer for a
time, he became associated with Mr.
Harris & Summers, Gatton.
MR. ALEXANDER McALLISTER.
J. Moffat, of Sherwood, from whom
he learned much that has since
proved of considerable value to him
in the direction of general farming,
but specializing in the culture of
of Brisbane, and still later, whilst
awaiting an'opening to enter upon
pastoral enterprise, was employed in
charge of horses on “Canning Downs”
Station, near Warwick. His final
employer was Mr. Alexander Hunter,
of “Burnside” Estate, for whom he
worked as general farm hand for a
time; and having at length gained
sufficient experience to warrant him
in making a venture on his own
account, in 1887 he started in a
modest way by the purchase of a
small farm of about 70 acres, on the
“Laidley Plains” Estate. The hold-
ing being still in its primitive con-
dition, Mr. McAllister had to begin at
the very beginning, and brought so
much energy and good judgment to
bear on his operations of clearing,
fencing, and general development,
that within a short time he was able
to dispose of it at a handsome profit.
Ultimately he purchased his present
homestead with its surrounding
acres at Forest Hill, a small adjoin-
ing block, in which his first wife
possessed an interest, being a part of
the property. Since then prosperity
has followed all his operations, and
as a result he has considerably added
to his landed possessions, about the
year 1900 acquiring a valuable hold-
ing lying about a mile distant from
“Cosey.” He personally supervises

in the early days when popular trials
of skill were more in vogue than
at present, Mr. McAllister won
several hardly-contested matches for
ploughing, under the auspices of the
Lockyer Agricultural Society, these
taking place on the Darling Downs,
in the coastal districts, and elsewhere,
under varying conditions of climate,
soil, etc. Public-spirited to a degree,
for many years he has maintained
his place in the forefront of local
progressive movements, and has
taken a leading part in the various
organizations for the welfare of the
community. He was appointed to
the Commission of the Peace over a
decade ago during the Philp Admin-
istration ; served the ratepayers of
Laidley Shire for some time as
Councillor; and has filled high
offices in the State school and pro-
gress committees. He is also con-
nected with the local race club, and
takes a cordial interest in sport of
a clean, legitimate nature. Mr.
McAllister has been twice married;
his first wife, Plelena Jessie, to whom
he was united in 1892, being a
daughter of the late William Gunn,
a well-known officer of the early
Queensland Police Force. In 1899
bis second marriage took place,
the present Mrs. McAllister being
Inga Marie Constina, daughter of
Mr. Martin Jorgensen, an early
pioneer of Western Queensland, now
living in retirement at Forest Hill.
By each marriage there has been a
son and a daughter, of whom the
two daughters and one son survive.
The eldest son, William James Alex-
ander McAllister, was killed in
action at the Dardanelles in June,

his father at Forest Hill, and like
many others resigned exceedingly
bright prospects to obey his
country’s call to arms. He was a
member of A Squadron, 2nd Light
Horse, A.1.F., and studied for the
responsible post of signaller, in
which capacity he accompanied the
expeditionary force to the Darda-
nelles. A giant in stature, his genial,
sunny nature and courteous, unas-
suming manner made him a general
favourite, and he was a well-known
and popular member of the Order
of Freemasons, and other organiza-
tions, being well to the fore in
matters affecting the advancement
of the district. The local rifle club
found in him an ardent supporter,
and he was a veritable master of
guncraft, being a crack pigeon shot,
and winner of many valuable
trophies in connection with this
class of sport. He was captain of
the Forest Hill football team, and
rendered yeoman service, both per-
sonally and financially, to the local
race club; while he also distinguished
himself on the polo field; and was
well-deserving of the respect of the
community as a “clean sport” as
well as for the patriotic spirit in


which he so promptly responded to
the mother country’s summons for
volunteers from overseas to aid in
the titanic struggle for international
liberty now in progress.

well-known name which dates back
to the early pagan days, when the
far back progenitors of the race
accepted with open hearts the doc-
trines preached by St. Patrick in
the Green Isle. Patrick McNamara
arrived at Brisbane on July 12,
1852, with his wife and five children,
Michael, the third child, being then
five years of age. After spending
about a year in charge of a wheat-
growing proposition on behalf of the
late Richard Wright, on “Glen-
lyon” Station, he turned his atten-
tion to the butchering business at
Warwick, where he continued on his
own account for several years. The
carrying trade also claimed his
attention, and in addition he became
interested in stockraising on a pro-
perty leased from “Canning Downs”
Station, noted for being the
settlement of Queensland’s earliest
pioneers. He also undertook the
role of “mine host” in the early
days of the Downs Hotel, a popu-
lar hostelry of the primitive era of
the town of Warwick; and became
one of the well-known identities of
the district, especially as a sheep and
cattle man. Mr. M. J. McNamara,
while still in his teens, started on
his own account in 1865, with bul-
lock teams, having completed his
studies under the late Jonathan
Harris, and a Mr. Stuart, who con-
ducted a night school in the town.
He undertook the carting of wool,
mainly in the Mclntyre Brook,
Severn, and Pike Creek districts,
but owing to the financial crisis
which occurred in Queensland in
1866 about that date he removed
across the border to the Mother
State, where he continued his work
with the teams until the end of 1869.
The Boorook gold rush taking place
in that year, Mr. McNamara’s
natural love of adventure led him
to dispose of his plant and hasten
to the scene of action, where he
speedily established a butchering
business, and did some speculating,
with varying results. In 1871 he
was offered the management of the
“Boorook” Cattle Station, which he
carried on successfully until the end
of 1872, and relinquished for the
purpose of assuming control of his
father’s business at Warwick. Ten
years later, after the demise of
Mr. Patrick McNamara, the gentle-
man under review took on some
large sub-contracts on the second
section of the Killarney railway
construction works, and having com-
pleted these in a highly satisfactory

james McCartney, j.p.,
owner of ‘Kilrae,” Forest Hill, was
born in the townland of Moneysalin,
County Derry, Ireland, on May 1,
1864, and is the eldest son of the
late Andrew McCartney, a well-
known name in the early era of gold
discovery in Victoria and New
Zealand. The late gentleman emi-
grated from Ireland when only 20
years of age, and spent about seven
years in the Ballarat diggings, later
on joining the big rush to the neigh-
bouring Dominion, where success
crowned his efforts with no niggard
hand. Satisfied with the results of
his endeavour, he returned to the
land of his birth, and settled down
to the peaceful occupation of farm-
ing in the locality where many
generations of McCartneys had tilled
the soil and reared their families,
of whom only one here and there of
the hardiest spread their wings for
flight to other lands. Andrew
McCartney died on his native heath
in June, 1914, nearly 30 years after
witnessing the departure of his
eldest son for those far-off shores,
the glamour of which had flung its
spell over his own early youth, and
tempted him to forsake the land of
his forefathers for the promise they
held out. Educated in the national
age he cut the ties which bound him
to home and took passage for Aus-
tralia, eventually landing at Queens-
land, where he entered at once upon
agricultural work on the farm of the

Here he became familiar with the
conditions under which the industry
was carried on in southern climes,
Valley railway line, and carried on
this work for some time, until in
the year 1889 he saw his way clear
to begin independent operations by
leasing a farm in the Forest Hill
district. When the “Rosewood”
Estate was opened up for closer
settlement purposes a couple of years
later Mr. McCartney seized the
opportunity to purchase a holding,
and at once addressed himself to the
task of inaugurating the necessary
improvement work on his new pro-
perty. He continued to farm this
block successfully, and as time went
on was able to acquire further terri-
tory for the same purpose, in course
of time establishing himself as one
of the most prosperous agriculturists
in the neighbourhood. After bestow-
ing much time and attention upon
the development of his later acqui-
sition, he brought it up to so high
a state of perfection that when in
1911 he decided to place the farm on
the market it realized a record price,
having gained the reputation of
being the best-developed property in
the district. The earlier purchase
he retained, and this holding is still
in possession of Mr. McCartney,

launch out on his own account. To
obtain the necessary capital he
undertook sub-contracts in connec-
tion with the construction of the
business as a produce merchant at
Forest Hill, leased the “Rosewood”
property to be worked on the share
system. During the lengthy period
that he personally engaged in farm

regarded as one of the specialists in
farming produce, whose opinion
carries weight throughout the State.
The standard he has set is of the
highest, and he holds numerous
trophies which testify to his ability
to secure from the soil the very best
results, having been awarded gold
medals and other honours on many
occasions at the Brisbane agricul-
tural shows and at international
events of a similar nature, having
repeatedly sujiplied the Queensland
Government with produce of excep-
tionally high quality for exhibition
at the Earl’s Court and Colonial
Institute in London, this being
regarded as an honour of premier
importance among agriculturists.
Among the public offices which he
has been called upon to fill in virtue
of this excellent reputation may be
mentioned that of delegate to one
of the conferences held under the
auspices of the Department of Agri-
culture in Queensland, in which
function he took a leading part, and
did yeoman service in the imparta-
tion of knowledge regarding the
cultivation of lucerne in this State.
He also introduced a paper on the
subject of “Scientific Roadmaking
and Drainage,” which gained high
commendation from those present at
the conference. He has sat as com-
mitteeman of the local agricultural
society, and for three years occupied
the presidential office. Apart from
the department of industry in which
he has specialized, and which natur-
ally commands the major share of
his interest, Mr. McCartney has
come forward to serve the community
in various other ways. He was
created a Justice of the Peace by
the Philp Administration in the
opening year of the present century;
and has held the most prominent
positions in the public life of the
district. For nearly a decade he
has filled the post of lion, secretary
to the local school committee, is a past
president of the progress association,
and at the present time (1915) acts
as chairman to the local patriotic
fund committee, which is doing good
work in arousing interest in the
need of the Empire at this period
of international strife in Europe.
His eldest son, Mr. Andrew McCart-
ney, now in his twenty-second year,
whose photograph appears in con-
nection with this article, won the
distinction of being the first
in the Forest Hill district to offer
himself for service on behalf of his
King and country at the Darda-
nelles. Mr. McCartney married
Mary, daughter of the late Captain
Gillies, of the well-known Victorian
family of that name, which gave to
the sister State one of its most
prominent Premiers. Of this mar-
riage there is a surviving family of
six sons and five daughters.
ALBERT GUSTAVE KLUCK,
J.P., Glenore Grove, via Forest Hill,
was born at Lowood on May 4,
1878, and is a son of the late
Michael Kluck, one of the early
pioneer settlers of Queensland, who
came from the Fatherland in the
early days of colonization in Eastern
Australia, and did his part towards
the opening up of the Tarampa dis-
trict, where he made his home. The
gentleman under review received
elementary instruction at a school in
his native district, but owes to his
own efforts the greater part of his
education, having spent much of his
leisure time right up to the present
in private study, a practice he still
continues. Having gained a good
practical knowledge of farming on
his father’s holding, when only 14
years of age he started on his own
account, but found himself too much
handicapped by his youth and
inexperience, and abandoned the
venture. After five years spent as
employe in storekeeping pursuits on
behalf of Mr. Ballantine, of Gatton,
he once more embarked on agricul-
tural enterprise, taking up land at
Scott’s Paddock, Helidon, which he
worked for about seven years.
Results being satisfactory he dis-
posed of this holding for the purpose
of inaugurating operations on a
larger scale on his present property,
which consists of 160 acres, and here
he has continued successfully ever
since. Mr. Kluck interests himself
in the public life of the district,
and has been a member of the Peace
Commission since he was 25 years of
age. For five years past he has
served the ratepayers of No. 3
Division on the Tarampa Shire
Council. He is an advocate of sport,
and is a member of the committee of
the Gatton Race Club, besides which
he takes a prominent part in prac-
tically all public movements for the
welfare of the place, charity organi-
zations, and loyal and patriotic
functions. Married in 1900 to

WALTER HALL, “Willow
Farm,” Forest Hill, was born on
November 29, 1865, at Stackpole,
Pembrokeshire, South Wales, his
father, the late James Hall, being
descended from ancient Celtic
ancestry, who were principally
engaged in farming avocations in
that part of the United Kingdom.
After the conclusion of his educa-
tion at the local national school, the
gentleman under review upon enter-
ing his teens began to assist his
father on the home farm, where he
remained for about five years. Early
manhood brought with it the com-
mon desire to see something more of
the world than was contained in the
narrow bounds where he had spent
his childhood, and accordingly he
set his face towards Australia,
whither his star of destiny pointed.
Arriving at Queensland towards the
latter part of the year 1883, he
girded his loins for the strenuous
struggle which he knew must lie in
front of him before any tangible
position could be attained. His first
employment was in the capacity of
general hand at the Pool Island Meat
Works, near Bowen, but finding
conditions here very unsatisfactory
he relinquished the connection, and
coming to the south took a sub-
contract for fencing from the rail-
way contractor to whom had been
entrusted the construction of the
Lowood-Esk line. Whilst engaged
in this work he perceived the possi-
bilities wrapped up in land settle-
ment in the young country, and
holding, which was still in its
natural state, consisting of dense
scrub land which needed many
months of patient preparation before
the ploughshare could be put to the
soil. In his anxiety to get forward

with his proposition, Mr. Hall,
while continuing his work on the
railway line, in order to gain suffi-
cient capital to carry on operations,
frequently denied himself even the
necessaries of life, and all the
luxuries, having his habitation far
away from any signs of civilization,
gloomy experience with a brave
heart, and inspired by their success
continued his efforts until the land
began to prove productive. Having
got his farm fairly going he selected
a second block, comprising 300 acres,
in the near vicinity, and enlarged
his enterprise by engaging in grazing
pursuits with equally good results.
In 1906 he disposed of these landed
interests for the purpose of purchas-
ing a superior property in the same
district, and put in 15 years in all
of industrious, strenuous life in the
Gatton district, during which he
established himself as a worthy
citizen of his adopted country. He
also acquired a property at Lake
Clarendon, which he applied to the
cultivation of lucerne with very
great success. Ultimately Mr. Hall
disposed of both the holdings men-
tioned in order to invest in a still
more favourable locality, when in
1911 he purchased his present home-
stead property from the former
owner, Mr. J. C. Nielsen, mentioned
elsewhere in this work. “Willow
Farm” is 200 acres in extent, about
half of which area is devoted to
lucerne, a crop admirably adapted
to the district. Mr. Hall is of a
retiring disposition, and takes no
prominent part in public affairs,
although charitable and other
worthy objects meet with his cordial
support, and for many years he has
been connected with the Masonic
craft. He married in 1890 Mary

ker, a retired farmer of Gatton

the example of the early pioneers,

His family consists of two sons and

CHARLES THOMAS GREG-
ORY, Forest Hill, was born at
Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, Eng-
land, on January 14, 1871. Mr.
Gregory was four years of age when
he arrived at Brisbane, in which city
he received his education. At the
age of 14 he became his father’s
assistant in the dairying business,
but, a few years later, desiring to
gain some experience on the land, he
became a station hand on "Clifton”
Station, on the Darling Downs, re-
moving from there to Talgai, Thane
Creek, and as far out west as "Pink-
ilia” Station, these runs all being the
property of the Queensland Invest-
ment and Land Mortgage Company.
Eventually he received the appoint-
ment of cattle overseer on "Clifton”
Station, and after five years spent

in this capacity decided to try his
fortune in independent enterprise.
In 1896, resigning the post referred
to, he took up a portion of the
original "Rosewood” Cattle Station,
and to this holding, which comprised
116 acres, he gave the name of
"Prairie Lawn.” This area has
since been added to, and at the
present time Mr. Gregory owns
about 600 acres, about a quarter of
which is devoted to intense tillage.
The principal crop raised on the
farm is lucerne, and in the cultiva-
tion of this fodder exceptional
success has been attained. Mr.
Gregory’s expert knowledge in
regard to livestock has enabled him
to make a very profitable proposi-
tion of the grazing capabilities of
his holding, and he frequently
makes highly successful deals in the
expeditious handling of stock, using
his well-clothed paddocks for the
pasturage in the meantime.' The
present homestead was built in
1900, and is a modern structure of
pleasing appearance, situated about
half a mile from the township of
Forest Hill. The surrounding area
is devoted to the cultivation of
ornamental trees and shrubs, and a
pretty flower garden meets the eye
of the traveller as he approaches
the house, while in the rear is the
usual vegetable patch, which sup-
plies the household with fresh gar-
den produce all the seasons round.
Mr. Gregory has long been known as
an ardent follower of the “sport of
Kings,” and has maintained his
membership in the Queensland Turf
Club for close on a score of years,
and at various times his candidates
under silk have caught the judge’s
eye. He is responsible for the intro-
duction to the racecourse of such

nized as a consistent supporter of

Gregory was married in 1900 to
Mary Louise, daughter of Mr.
Wiliam John Dyer, one of the old
pioneers of Laidley Creek, Queens-
land, who came with his father, the
late Thomas Scott Dyer, from New
South Wales in the early days, and
settling in the above-mentioned dis-
trict, successfully demonstrated the
excellent possibilities of the soil for
farming purposes. A descendant of

decided to emigrate. Upon arrival
at Brisbane he became engaged in
the agricultural industry at Laidley,
and a year later began operations on
his own account, taking up q home-
stead area of 160 acres of what
was known as the old “Cressbrook”
Station. After completing six years
of improvement work on this pro-
perty he disposed of it for the
purpose of securing the larger hold-
ing where he now resides. “Station
View” was acquired by Mr. McKee
in 1887, and consists of 250 acres in
all, a portion of which surrounds the
homestead, while the balance is
situated in other parts of the Forest
Hill district. Ever since taking up
his residence upon the holding in the
year above mentioned, Mr. McKee
has directed all his energies to the
object of securing the best results
from his land, and has had the
satisfaction of seeing it develop into
a thoroughly successful proposition
He has also made his influence felt
to a marked degree in public affairs
connected with the welfare of the
community and the progress of the
district, being specially interested in
religious and educational matters.
A member of the Roman Catholic
communion, the part he has played
in the advancement of the local
church of that persuasion has been
in no respect a small one, and in
addition to holding office as trustee
of the Laidley Convent, he has filled
the position of committeeman of the
local State school directorate. Mr.
McKee married in 1885 Hannorah,
daughter of the late Michael Sculley,
one of Queensland’s early pioneers,
who was among the first settlers of
the Blenheim district, and from his
arrival in 1875 to the time of his
death lived a quiet, industrious life,
earning the respect of all with whom
he was associated in the important
work of opening up the resources of
a new country. Mrs. McKee is a
native of Ireland, and has shown
herself possessed of considerable
initiative and strength of character,
having on her own account taken up
some 200 acres of the “Rosewood”
Estate. Her chief thought has been
the welfare and future of her
children, and it is to such mothers
who nobly yield their sons to serve
the Empire in time of need that
those same sons owe the spirit which
leads them to respond most promptly
to their country’s call. Of the
family of five sons and five daughters
born to Mr. and Mrs. McKee, three
of the sons are now serving at the
front in the present great European
War, while the two elder ones have
remained to assist their father in the
working of the property. The first
to join the Australian Imperial
Forces was the fourth son, Francis,

WILLIAM BOWDEN, of "Col-
lege View,” via Forest Hill, was
born at Colinton, Brisbane Valley,
on December 22, 1855, being the
second son of the late William
Bowden, of Cheshire, England, who
settled in Queensland in the forties.
A carpenter by trade, the late
pioneer was concerned in the erection
of many buildings, now possessing
considerable historic interest, among
which was the old "Colinton”
homestead. He also engaged in
the carrying trade, and various
other work incidental to the
life of a pioneer, until finally he
settled down at Laidley and worked
a small farm in the days when large
crops were regarded somewhat in the
light of an incubus on account of
the absence of markets for produce
from the land. Mr. Bowden died at

an accident at the age of 53. The
gentleman under review, the present
William Bowden, lived in the first
house at Laidley, which was erected
by his father, and attended the
primitive school which at that time
provided the only means of instruc-
tion for the young. While yet in his
early teens he became familiar witli
his father’s operations as a carrier,
and took charge of the teams while
the merest stripling of a boy. After
the death of the late Mr. Bowden
he -became the mainstay of his
widowed mother, and gave her
invaluable assistance in the bringing
up of the younger members of the
family until they were able to fend
for themselves. Even after launching
out on his own account he con-
tinued to render to the old home all
the help which his filial spirit
prompted and which he found pos-
sible to give. For a considerable
time he was engaged on “Dalmally”
Station, near Springsure, but having
a growing family which made the
matter of educational facilities one
of importance, he removed to the
Fassifern district, where he became
identified with the engineering
branch of the Railway Department.
During the 12 years that he remained
in this connection he took un his
present holding near Forest Hill,
and whilst continuing at his post for
the advantage it gave him in finan-
cing the new proposition, placed his
elder sons on the land to commence
its development under his supervi-
sion. When sufficient headway had
been made to warrant the move, he
resigned his position in the railway
service, and taking up his residence
on the property in 1901, has since
devoted the whole of his time and
attention to forwarding operations
thereon. He has admitted into
partnership his son Michael, who by
his energy and ability has proved a
very valuable coadjutor in the work
of the farm, in the success of which

trict, where he leased an area of
land, and followed farming occupa-
tions for a considerable time, even-
tually settling down in 1880 on a
farm of his own selection at Hatton
Yale. Mr. Peters, who was the
second settler in this district,
resided there for over 30 years,
during which lengthy period he
established an excellent reputation
for sterling worth of character, and
brought up a family of 15 sons and
daughters, most of whom have
turned to the soil for a livelihood.
The gentleman under review, Mr.
William Peters, received his early
education at the Hatton Vale State
School, but his schooldays were of
limited duration, as long before he
reached his teens he was following
the plough on his father’s farm, as
eldest son having to take many of
the responsibilities of the family on
his young shoulders. An evidence of
Mr. Peters’ strength of character is
clearly shown in the fact that years
later, after having reached man’s
estate and taken to himself a wife,
he set himself to augment his scanty
mental equipment of a useful citizen.
Whilst still working on his father’s
farm, before attaining his majority,
he spent the main part of his leisure
hours in qualifying himself for

he conducts as a grazing and mixed

The homestead is approached by six
miles of good roadway from the

picturesquely situated on a gentle

has always been recognized as a man
of public spirit, and his keen and
genuine interest in all affairs per-
taining to the advancement of his
district has led to the occupation of
many offices by him. He was created
a Justice of the Peace by the
Denham Administration in 1913,
and for the past six years has served
as councillor on behalf of the Laid-
ley ratepayers in the local governing
body, over which he now (1915) pre-
sides. He has been a member of the
Lockyer Agricultural Society for a
lengthy period, and committeeman
for over a decade. At various times
he has served as president of the
local progress association; has been
chairman of the public school com-
mittee for 12 years; and has filled
the post of chairman of trustees
of the recreation reserve; besides
which every movement set afoot for
the betterment of the community in
which he has cast his lot has
received his sympathy and practical
support. He is a true lover of a
good horse, and himself a successful
breeder on a fairly extensive scale
of Clydesdale and pony stock, he
has deservedly gained the reputation
of being an excellent judge of equine
perfection. He has also established
himself as a good clean sport, and
has maintained this good name for
the past seven years in his influential
position as president of the Glenore
Grove Jockey Club. Mr. Peters was
married in the year 1893 to Augusta,
daughter of the late Carl Tillack,
one of the early pioneering farmers
of Hatton Vale, by whom he has

mant in the wild scrub lands, which
by many were not considered worth
the trouble and expense of clearing,
but which are now reckoned among
the most profitable territory of the
State. Mr. Christian Sempf carried
on his farming enterprise chiefly in
the vicinity of the Logan River,

turist of careful and scientific

MR. HEINRICH SCHMIDT.
son of the late Heinrich Schmidt,
■who, hailing from Harzburg, was
among the earliest of German sett-
lers in Queensland. Arriving in the
year 1870 with his wife and son, the
late Mr. Schmidt became engaged
in farming occupations in the
Ipswich district, his employer being
the late Stephen Hargrave, a well-
known pioneer in the farming indus-
try on the banks of the Brisbane
River. After a few months there
father and son decided to begin
independent operations, and within
six months of their arrival they took
up a block of scrub land in the
Walloon district, now known a?
Townshend. Bringing to bear on this
proposition all the industry and
steady “graft” for which their
nationality is noted, the settlers in
a marvellously short space of time
had sufficient of their area cleared
and improved to ensure them a liveli-
hood, notwithstanding the fact that
indifferent seasons marked the earlier
years of their enterprise. Very
primitive methods also made their
task more difficult, maize having to
be planted among the stumps of the
trees, where the only means of
turning over the soil was with a hoe.
Their only habitation was a slab hut,
and the conditions of living were
often trying in the extreme, while
the uncertainty of securing a favour-
able market or any market at all for
their produce gave an element of
anxiety to their venture, which only
further settlement in the State could
remove. Perseverance eventually
had its reward, and after about
five years, when the farm, which
comprised 120 acres, had all been
laid out to the best advantage, Mr.
Theodor Schmidt married, and
dividing the holding with his father,
henceforward worked his share on
his own behalf. The late Heinrich
Schmidt died in 1886, having accom-
plished a worthy part as a pioneer
of the Townshend (formerly Mar-
burg) district, where he and his son
were among the earliest settlers. The
gentleman under review sold out in
the year 1892 and purchased a pro-
perty at Helidon, where he carried
on farming pursuits for seventeen
years. Here most of his children
were born, and in 1909, settling one
of his sons on the farm, he came to
Forest Hill and acquired the “Harz-
burg” holding, where he has since
made his home. He specializes in the
raising of potatoes, onions, pumpkins,
and lucerne; the property, which
is situated on the southern bank
of the Lockyer Creek, though small,

Mr. Schmidt, who belongs to the
connexion of Seventh Day Adven-

a charitable nature, and though
retiring in disposition, adheres to
his principles on all occasions. He

pioneer of the sixties, who with his
wife was a notable example of the
hardworking settler to which so
much of the wellbeing of the State is
due. To this lady, who has borne
him nine sons and six daughters,
Mr. Schmidt owes much of hie
success, her loyal co-operation in all
his affairs proving of the most helpful
and encouraging nature.

at Gympie, when the younger man
joined the rush, and spent about
nine months on the goldfield, during
the major portion of that time being
engaged in cutting down timber
and supplying it for the require-
ments of the different mines. Sub-
sequently, in the year 1869, he
settled at North Pine, where he
carried on mixed-farming pursuits,
combined with the growing of sugar-
cane for the first two years, and
though at first an uphill task, by
degrees the pinnacle of success was
gained, and in the course of time he
was in a position to purchase a large
holding in the district, where he
continued in the dairying industry
on a fairly extensive scale. Here
the gentleman under review was
born on May 12, 1875, and to the
local public school at Harrison’s
Pocket, North Pine, he owed his
instruction in scholastic subjects,
pursuing his studies there until 14
years of age. Upon leaving school
he assisted his father in the farm
operations until nearly 25, follow-
ing which for a period of nearly
two years he was engaged in lucerne
growing at Lake Clarendon, near
Gatton, in partnership with a
younger brother. In 1903 Mr.
R. W. L. Raymont secured land at
Lockrose, then known as the
"Tarampa Repurchased Estate,” and
commenced farming on his own
account, continuing successfully on
this holding ever since. He has
been very prominent in all move-
ments for the advancement of the
district, his first public position
being that of hon. secretary to the
committee appointed to deal with
the matter of what was known as
"Middleton’s Crossing Bridge.” The
committee fought a very tough
battle against strenuous opposition
in this case, which entailed an
immense amount of correspondence,
and culminated in the ultimate
triumph of their cause. Mr. Ray-
mont has been hon. secretary for six
years to the Lockrose School Com-
mittee, and during the latter half
of this period has combined with

he holds the position of president of
the Farmers’ Federal Council of
West Moreton, the above council
being a union of agricultural

12, 1872. The locality was then
known as ' Darkey Flat,” the name
being derived from the circumstance
that a raid on the aboriginal natives
was there organized by the white
population, which had suffered in
many ways through the depreda-
tions of the savage tribes by which
they were surrounded. Mr. Seibel
is the eldest son of the late Conrad
Seibel, who came from Hessen
Castle, Germany, to take his place
among the band of fine old pioneers,
to whom the early opening up of
the country districts in Australia is
largely due. After arrival in Queens-
land in 1870 the late Mr. Seibel was
engaged for some time as a shepherd
on the Darling Downs, in the employ
of the then well-known pastoral
concern, the North British Austral-
asian Pastoral Company, and at a
subsequent period was engaged in
the tin-mining industry at Stan-
thorpe, where he met with an
accident which indirectly was the
cause of his turning his attention
to a less hazardous occupation.
Between two and three years after
his advent to this State he had
settled on a 60-acre block of land,
strenuously working to secure not
only a livelihood for his young wife
and himself, but with the object of
snugly feathering the nest for the
young brood which they hoped to
welcome in the course of the years,
having been married on the eve of
their departure from Germany. The
small block was all virgin country,
prior to his occupation having been
in the possession of his former
employers; and so responsive was the
soil to tillage that Mr. Seibel was
soon in a position to acquire further
area, adding to his holding by pur-
chase as opportunity offered, until
at the time of his death he owned
a nice little property of 200 acres.
After his father had joined the great
majority Mr. John Emanuel Seibel,
though still only a youth in his teens,
took over the reins of management,

administration of affairs that when
finally a division of the property was
made between the different members
of the family the extent of the farm

by the Government and thrown open
for selection, and at the ensuing
ballot was fortunate enough to
secure one of the choicest farms of
the district. Although the initial
price of this holding was as high as
£lO per acre, its superior productive
value has proved it in the event
worth far more than this figure
There is difficulty in estimating the
true worth of the land in this dis-
trict for the excellent reason that


none of the present settlers are
anxious to part with their holdings,
but it is safe to assert that in the
interval which has elapsed since Mr.
Seibel came as a purchaser to Lock-
rose his land has doubled in value.
A feature of the country is its admir-
able adaptation to intense culture,
maize, lucerne, potatoes, and other
crops of the same nature being pro-
duced in quantities relatively large
to the amount of area under cultiva-
tion. Mr. Seibel has demonstrated
by experiment conducted on scien-
tific principles the possibilities open
to the dry farming system in this
neighbourhood, summer wheat hav-
ing come to maturity in a satisfac-
tory manner under his method of
culture. He also engages in daixying
on a small scale. The “Villa Farm”
homestead is situated about half a
mile distant from the property, and
has been built on high ground to
escape the contingency of floods, in
times of heavy rains all the lower
areas having been known to be under
water. This, though inconvenient
for the time being, has its advan-
tages, these storm waters leaving

April 25, 1873, and is the eldest son
of Mr. M. F. W. Harm, sen. (now
of East Brisbane), who came to
Queensland in February, 1882, .and
number of years. The gentleman
under review received his education
at the Minden State School, where
he remained until about 12 years of
age. He then turned his hand to
strenuous work on the home farm,
and having obtained an excellent
knowledge of the agricultural indus-
try, some eight years later was
started by his father on a farm of
his own in the same neighbourhood.
Here he continued successfully for
some years, until the land around
Lockrose, then known as the “Tar-
ampa” Estate, was opened up for
selection, and purchasing a holding
in this district he began operations
on a more extensive scale. This pro-
perty, to which he gave the name
of “Mountain View,” typical of the
character of the scenery, comprises
80 acres, and is admirably adapted
for mixed-farming purposes, the soil
being well suited to the growing of
maize and other crops, while well-
grassed pasture land makes dairying
a very profitable department of the
farmer’s industry. Mr. Harm also
carries on pig-raising with very good
results. A very picturesque situation
has been chosen for the homestead,
from the verandah of which Mount
Tarampa is seen to great advantage,
the beautiful view making this a
delightful lounging place for the
family. Mr. Harm also owns
another property of 124 acres, part
of the famous “Mondure” Estate,

for a quarter of a century, and at

Ireland among the earliest pioneers
of Queensland. He voyaged to
Australia by the sailing vessel
“Mary Pleasant,” and after arrival
was for some time settled at Ipswich,
subsequently entering upon agricul-
tural pursuits at Redbank Plains.
His sojourn at Upper Bundamba
followed, and during the lengthy
period of his connection with this
district he made himself the soul of
the community, earning the respect
and esteem of his fellow-settlers by
his industry and enterprise, and
accomplished his full share of
Empire-building by wresting from
the wilds a home and a competency
for himself, enabling him to bring
up a large family of six sons and
three daughters, and to retire in
comfort for the remainder of his
days, he relinquished active opera-
tions on the land, and took up his
residence at Ipswich until about
eight years prior to his demise, when
he went to live at “Mount View,”
Lower Tent Hill, the residence of his
son, Mr. Thomas Ward. Full of
years and honours, he passed the
evening of his life rich in the affec-
tion of friends and kindred, and in
the memory of years well and use-
fully spent, his demise occurring at
“Mount View” on August 3, 1913.
His eldest son, Mr. Thomas Ward,
was born at Ipswich in 1859, and
received his preliminary education
at the Redbank Plains State
School, completing his studies at
the seminary conducted by Father
Brunn and some teaching sisters
of a religious order in that
district. Upon leaving school he
worked with his father on the farm
until his marriage, when, leaving the
paternal rooftree, he turned his hand
to the various avocations incidental
to bush life until 1892, in that year
purchasing a portion of the old
“Tent Hill” Station, where he has
since successfully carried on farming
operations on his own account. To
the original block Mr. Ward has
been able to add considerably, and
his landed possessions now aggregate
a total of some 700 acres, situated
six miles from Gatton, on the banks
of the ever-flowing Blackfellow

of the model farms of the district.
He was married in Brisbane in 1885

behalf of the Government, and later
selected his holding—a portion of
the old “Grantham” Station—under
the conditions of the 1868 Land
Act. After living on this block,
which comprised about 900 acres, for
11 years, subsequently he purchased
the property upon which his only
son, Mr. Gerald Byrne, now resides,
where he made his home for about
20 years. Upon his retirement from
active pursuits he took up his resi-
dence at Gatton, where he recently
completed his tale of four score
years. Mr. Byrne played a promi-
nent part in the pioneering of the
shire council movement, and was
always well to the fore in the various
projects set afoot for the progress of
the district. He was married in
Ireland in the early j:»art of 1864 to
Mary, daughter of the late Thomas
Doyle, also descended from a line of
with families of their own. Mr. and

of the union are now all married,
district. GERALD BYRNE, J.P.,
only son of the foregoing gentleman,
is a native of Queensland, having


been born near Helidon on Septem-
ber 14, 1869. He received his educa-
tion at the Gatton State School, and
at 14 years of age began to assist
his father in the mixed farming
proposition, which proved a useful
training for his subsequent career.
Having gained considerable know-
ledge with regard to stock before
completing his minority, he started
out on the roads as a drover, taking
charge of stock for “Lake Claren-
don” Station, in the northerly dis-
tricts of Central Queensland. This
trip, though not of a long duration,
gave him an insight into conditions
prevailing in the interior, and return-
ing east before 12 months had
elapsed he took a position as mail-
driver between Gladstone and Bun-
daberg, a year later his route being
altered to Banana from the former
town, while in the following year
he was driving between Gladstone
and Cania, on the Burnett River, for
a somewhat shorter period. When
the Maxwelton gold diggings began
to attract attention Mr. Byrne
joined the rush to that centre, and
in the ensuing months spent all the
money he had saved in a vain
attempt to win a short cut to pros-
perity by mining. After giving this
a fair trial he turned his attention to
sluicing, another phase of the indus-
try, with the same unsatisfactory
result. Tired of the unprofitable
toil, he sought once more the shelter
of his father’s home, and turned his
hand to the cultivation of the soil
and the management of stock on the
home farm. Again tempted by the
romance of the road, he was led to
undertake now contracts and now
work by the day, filling in a con-
siderable period in this way —about
11 years in all—until finally he felt
that the time had come for him to
settle down at “Chestnut View,” and
relieve his father of the management
of the property. Accordingly he
took his father’s place, the old
couple removing to the town of Gat-
ton near by; but finding that the
development of the property did not
take up the whole of his time he par-
tially resumed his old-time occupa-
tion of droving, and made trips with
cattle to Grafton, New South Wales,
and to Homebush, on the outskirts
of Sydney. As his young family
increased, however, these journeys
were given up, and the whole of his
attention devoted to the conduct of
the home farm. The property, con-
sisting in all of some 2,000 acres,
is divided into two portions, about
300 acres surrounding the home-
stead, while the remainder is situ-
ated at Redbank, some six miles
distant. “Chestnut View” home-
stead, which is exactly two miles
from Gatton, is one of the oldest
established homes in the district,
and is a thoroughly prosperous and
flourishing farm, devoted to dairying
and grazing. Mr. Byrne continues
to follow in the footsteps of his
father in his conduct of operations,
and has also proved his worthy suc-
cessor in matters of public moment,
wherein his co-operation is called for.
He was gazetted a Justice of the
Peace by the Kidston Administra-
tion; served for 15 years as a mem-
ber of the Marsupial Board of West
Moreton district; and is an advocate
of all forms of clean sport, specially
favouring the "sport of Kings” for
his own personal recreation, and for
a quarter of a century has been con-
nected with the Gatton Race Club,
in which he has filled almost all
honorary offices with credit and
eclat. A true Irishman, though by
accident of birth an Australian —
many such being more Irish than
the Irish themselves —he gives loyal
support to the cause of his nation ;
and as a member of the Roman Com-
munion upholds in practical manner
the interests of the oldest Christian
Church. Mr. Byrne married Annie
Mary, daughter of the late Freder-
ick Wockner, one of the oldest
pioneers of Toowoomba and the
Darling Downs in the pastoral
industry, and has a family of one
son and five daughters.
LEONARD THOMAS LESTER,
of “Lester Vale,” Lake Clarendon,
via Gatton, was born at Laidley,
Queensland, on September 2, 1878,
and is the eldest son of Mr. Joseph
Lester, who came from Ireland close
on half a century ago and settled
in the above-mentioned district soon
after his arrival in the State.
Having been associated with the
farming industry in the Old Coun-
try, he naturally made it his first
business to become acquainted with
the conditions under which this
calling was carried on in widely
differing latitudes, and in order to
gain practical experience on an
Australian farm accepted enqfioy-
ment on the "Burnside” property,
owned by Mr. Hunter, one of the
pioneer settlers of the district.
After remaining here for about two
years he launched out on his own
account, purchasing a block of land
situated on the Laidley Creek, one
of the permanently running streams
of this part of Queensland. This
property, which had not long been
redeemed from its virgin state, he
developed with so much success that
in course of time he was able con-
siderably to increase his landed pos-
sessions, and to-day is looked upon
as one of the most prominent settlers
in the Laidley district. The subject
of this notice, Mr. L. T. Lester, was
educated at the Laidley State
School, and upon the completion of
his studies worked with his father
until 20 years of age. He then
decided to look abroad for further
experience not connected with the
land, and accordingly became a
member of the Queensland Police
Force, for 12 months being stationed
in the metropolis. Having satisfied
himself in that period that for him
advancement did not lie in the Civil
Service, and yielding to the inborn
love of the soil, he resigned from
the force, and returned to his boy-
hood’s home. Not long content to
remain under the paternal rooftree,
however, he made his bid for inde-
pendent enterprise at the time that
the “Lake Clarendon” Estate was
thrown open for purchase, and was
fortunate in the ballot, securing the
fine block on which the homestead
is now situated. This consisted of
80 acres, which he immediately com-
menced to work, only to meet with
experiences disheartening in the
extreme for a beginner, 13 months of


drought setting in, when his few
head of stock had to be fed with dry
corn stalks and cane tops brought
from the sugar plantations in the
north in order to keep them
alive. Gradually, however, matters
improved, and by degrees Mr.
Lester acquired additional land, his
farm now comprising over 250 acres,
which is considered in this excellent
agricultural district a large holding.
The country is flat, the soil consist-
ing mainly of black loam, well
adapted for the cultivation of maize
and lucerne, which are the principal
crops raised on the farm. About a
third of the area owned by Mr.
Lester is devoted to intense culture,
while the remainder is used for
grazing purposes, a goodly herd of
cattle being kept in prime condition
in the pastures. Cattle are raised
for the market, and a few horses
are bred for the same purpose,
as well as for use on the property.
The homestead is a well-built sub-
stantial structure, possessing various
picturesque features, its whole
appearance being well in keeping
with the position occupied by the
farm as one of the premier properties
in the neighbourhood. Mr. Lester

tural Society. lie is also a member

that he was able successfully to com-

this distinction. In his younger
days he was prominent in athletic
circles, and takes pleasure in wit-

various departments of sport. Mr.
Lester married in 1901 Florence,
daughter of the late Henry Han-
nant, formerly a well-known identity
of the Hatton Vale district, who
came from England in the early
days, and was one of the pioneers in
farming in the young Queensland
community. Mr. Hannant was also

the clipper “Montmorency.” He
hailed from Dundee, Scotland,
where his father, the late Robert
Logan, worked as weaver at Rose-
bank, and prior to his departure
was engaged in farming pursuits in
his native country. Soon after
arrival he found employment on a
farm at South Brisbane owned by

and agriculturists of the State.
After a few months Mr. Logan
undertook to attend to the
meat-preserving works at Redbank,
whilst putting in a portion of his
time at farming, in which he was
more in his element. At the ex-
piration of three years he invested
his savings in a small farm of 36
acres, which he purchased at £1 per
acre, subsequently disposing of the
holding to acquire 50 acres at
Goodna Creek, which he farmed suc-
cessfully on his own account, cotton
being the principal crop produced.
He continued there for about a
decade, varying his efforts on the
land by doing occasional work in the
Redbank coal mines, earning suffi-
cient in this way to enable him to
push his independent enterprise to
the point of prosperity. A portion of
the Goodna Creek property is still in
possession of the Logan family. In
1869 he selected his present holding
in its virgin state, and two years
later came to undertake the task of
building a home of a permanent
character in the heart of the bush
for himself and future generations.
As his sons grew to manhood they
assisted in the work of the farm, and
later launched out for themselves,
the eldest settling at Gatton, the
second at Bundamba, while the
youngest carries on the farm
at “Bonny Bank.’’ The aged
couple, who have also two daughters
living, reside in a picturesque
cottage on the farm, in close vicinity
to the homestead where their son is
settled with his family. Full of
years and modest honours, Mr.
Logan, now (1915) in his eighty-fifth
year, can look back on a useful life,
in which private enterprise was
linked with keen interest in the pub-
lic welfare, leading him to use his
influence for the construction of
roads, bridges, and other works of
a developmental character in the
district. PETER ALEXANDER
LOGAN, the youngest son, was
born at “Bonny Bank” in 1874, and
educated at the Tent Hill State
School. At 14 he joined his elder

brothers in the work of the farm,
and continued until his father’s
retirement about the year 1900,
when he took over the whole
responsibility of management, and
is now practically the occupier.
“Bonny Bank” consists of about
800 acres, some 340 surrounding
the homestead, and the remainder
lying about two miles from Gat-
ton Township. Among the mixed
farming operations carried on pride
of place is given to the raising
of hay for the market; but stock
is also carried, about 50 horses and a
small herd of 100 mixed cattle being
grazed on the pastures. Origin-
ally covered with heavy timber, the
property has been almost entirely
cleared, but sufficient trees have been
spared to serve as a shelter for the
animals. Mr. P. A. Logan was
married in 1899 to Sarah Jane,
daughter of Mr. Charles Tryhorn,
one of the old pioneer agriculturists
of Queensland, who settled on Ma
Ma Creek over 40 years ago, and
there is issue two sons and three
daughters. It is fitting to mention
that another son of Mr. James
Logan, the late Robert Logan, after
offering himself for service at the
time of the Boer War in South
Africa, was accidentally shot whilst
in camp at Brisbane during the
preparation of the troops for depar-
ture.

preceding page. The subject of our
notice had almost entered his teens
before educational facilities were
provided in the district, and from
the time that he could saddle and
bridle a horse until the era which
saw the establishment of a State
school at Lower Tent Hill he was
kept fully employed in the Avork at
“Bonny Bank,” the property of his
father. After the school was opened
he became a regular attendant for
three or four years, and applied
himself with great industry to
mastering the rudiments of learning,
while, up at daylight, he carried on
his former duties until schooltime,
resuming them upon his return
home in the afternoon. His school-
days ended, Mr. Logan set himself to
self-improvement and the cultiva-
tion of his mental powers in all ways
possible to him, and in this manner
laid the foundation of self-reliance
and the power of initiative, on which
the structure of a worthy character
fitly could be reared. He remained
with his father until reaching
man’s estate, when he married,
and began his independent career.
Having only £5O in the way of cash
capital and stock consisting of 10
head of cattle and 3 horses, his
early operations were necessarily on
a very modest scale. He rented a
farm in the near vicinity of Gat-
ton, and applied himself with grim
determination to the hard work of
practical agriculture, to which he was
no stranger, only to experience the
bitterness of failure through no fault
of his own. The serious drought
which set in in the year 1885, just
as he had embarked on his venture,
blasted all his hopes, his crops
giving no returns, and progress in
all other directions being effectually
barred, so that at the end of three

CHAMPION CLYDESDALE STALLION, “YOUNG DUNDONALD ” BY “LORD DUNDONALD”
years he found all his scanty capital
vanished, his fields bare, and his
stock reduced to one poor horse and
a single poddy calf—a heartbreaking
experience. To secure a livelihood
for himself and family he accepted
employment in carting water to the
local sawmill with his one remaining
horse, the remuneration being ss.
per day, and on this pittance sub-
sisted with his wife and child, as
well as providing the necessary
fodder for his horse. During this
time he continued to hold his farm,
and, when the drought finally broke,
again set to work to cultivate the soil.
With £l4 in hand he considered
himself on the crest of the wave;
but this, fortunately, was not his
only asset. His father’s good name
and the favourable opinion he had
won for himself by his pluck and
industry enabled him to borrow
£4OO from the firm of Messrs Cribb
and Foote, of Ipswich, and with this
he purchased a block of some 80
acres —that on which his homestead
now stands. He immediately cleared
a patch of nine acres and planted
and dug two crops of potatoes in the
same year. The results from this
small area alone were so satisfactory
that within a very short time he
was able to repay the loan and out
of the surplus erect the homestead
in which he has since resided. Profit-
ing by his experience in the three
bad seasons previously referred to,
Mr. Logan proceeded to make pro-
vision against a repetition of such
misfortune by devising a complete
system of irrigation from the Black-
fellow and Lockyer Creeks which flow
through his property, by means of


an up-to-date traction engine and
pump. As a result, when the big
drought of 1901-2 occurred, over
Mr. Logan’s holding splendid crops
of potatoes, lucerne, maize, etc.,
were in evidence, in direct contrast
to the blank desolation which
reigned on other properties in the
neighbourhood. From time to time
he increased the area of his posses-
sions, and at length, having
launched out into the breeding and
grazing of stock, could count his acres
by a total of some 2,500 freehold,
besides which he leases 3,000 acres in
the Gatton district, and in conjunc-
tion with his sons a big tract of
40,000 acres in the Burnett district.
The breeding and grazing of short-
horn cattle is carried on, and a small
stud of the famous black-polled
Angus breed is also kept. Mr.
Logan has also been successful
in the breeding of Clydesdale
horses, a most importan b feature
of this part of his enterprise being
his purchase of one of the best,
if not the best sire in Australia,
“Young Dundonald,” whose sire,
“Lord Dundonald,” imported from
Scotland at a cost of 1,000 guineas,
was for a lengthy period the
champion of Australia. “Young
Dundonald” has been said to surpass
in good points even his sire, and
established a winning show record
in the State, and represent the
highest-class Clydesdale blood in
Australia. In the earlier years of

he has acted as committeeman
ever since, and has twice filled the
office of president of that body.
He has made his influence felt
far beyond the limits of his own
rooftree, and became a very real
factor in all movements towards the
advancement of the district. For
many years he was closely identified
with the Farmers’ Co-operative
Union, filling the office of president
of the local branch for a term. He
is a member of the Good Templars
Lodge, and for the past 30 years has
been a total abstainer. He was
gazetted to the Commission of the
Peace by the Philp Administration;
served the ratepayers of the Tar-
ampa Shire for some time as coun-
cillor ; and during the period that
the old Licensing Act was in force
occupied an honorary seat on the
local licensing bench. He has taken
an active part in the furtherance
of the interests of the Congrega-
tional Church community at Gatton,
and holds office as deacon in that

to athletics, and as a cricketer won
laurels among his compeers. He

initial “O” upon his advent to Aus-
tralia, was one of those rare person-
alities who command the love and
respect of all with whom they come
into contact for the winning quality
of their nature and the uprightness
of their character. He was born
in County Limerick, and at the
time of his death in 1915 had almost
attained the advanced age of four
score years. Before finally sailing
for the land of the Southern Cross
he spent some years in London,
emigrating to Queensland in the
early sixties with his wife, a member
of a County Cork family. For a time
he was engaged in pastoral life
on “Unimgar” Station, and subse-
quently, like so many of the pioneers
of the day, took part in the con-
struction of the then chief line of
railway in the State—from Ipswich
to Gatton. Upon the completion of
his term of employment in this con-
nection he had contrived to save
sufficient capital to enable him to
purchase a partly developed farm on
the Lockyer Creek, near Gatton,
where he was long and favourably
known as the type of settler which
makes for the good of a young
nation. The universal testimony of
the district from far and wide on
the occasion of his decease was that
never had Ireland sent from her
shores a truer, more genuine, or more
honest son to uphold her credit in
lands where national character was
yet in its earliest stages, and his
example has become a matter of
axiom in the places where he was
best known. He left a surviv-
ing family of two sons and four
daughters. Mr. P. S. Callaghan
came to Australia with his parents
as an infant in arms, and received
his education at the Gatton Catholic
School, with a finishing course at
Father Brunn’s private academy at
Ipswich. Upon the completion of
his studies he worked on his father’s
farm for five years, and gained much
valuable experience in this connec-
tion especially in the agricultural
industry. Upon attaining mature
years he proceeded to “Buaraba”
Station, subsequently coming to Gat-
ton, where he carried on a provision
business for some time. He next
worked as a stock hand on “Mount
Brisbane” Station, but eventually
availed himself of the oppor-
tunity to purchase a portion of
the old “Rosewood” Cattle Station,
then (in 1893) still in its virgin
state. The original block consisted
of 90 acres, which by judicious addi-
tions from time to time has now
been nearly doubled by Mr. Calla-
ghan, who devotes the whole area
to mixed farming, in which he has
met with much success. Public-
spirited and upright as his father, he

years; while his connection with the
H.A.C.B.S. dates back over a


lengthy period. Mr. Callaghan

of Mr. James O'Shea, also an early
settler of Queensland, and has two
sons and two daughters, the former
both being engaged with their
father in fanning occupations.
STEPHEN JOSEPH KAVAN-
AGH, of “Carlow,” Lake Clarendon,
via Gatton, is a son of Mr. Hugh
Kavanagh, who lives in retirement
at Bald Ridges, Glamorgan Vale.
The latter gentleman is a typical
son of Erin, stalwart in physique
and sterling in character, being
possessed of those qualities of grit
and enterprise which made many of
the Irish valuable settlers in the
early days of Queensland coloniza-
tion. He is a native of County
Carlow, Ireland, and the descendant
of a long line of ancestors who
have followed farming pursuits for
generation after generation, almost
exclusively in that county, their
name now being legion. Mr. S. J.
Kavanagh was born at Bald Ridges
on July 28, 1875, and received his
education at the Glamorgan Vale
State School. At an early age he
began to assist his father on the
home farm, and in this way obtained
a landholder by purchase of a 480-
acre block at Buaraba, from Mr.
Peter A. Logan, to which he subse-
quently added by the acquirement of

sions in this district up to about
1,500 acres. In the year 1901 he
selected the property on which he
until at the present time his total
landed estate aggregates in the
vicinity of 2,500 acres, which is
devoted to mixed farming, pre-
eminence being given to grazing.
In 1904, when he first decided to
make a home for himself at “Car-
low,” Mr. Kavanagh turned his
attention to the butchering business
in that comparatively new centre.
By so doing he conferred a boon
which was much appreciated by the
other settlers in the* district, and
met with such ready patronage that
be continued successfully in this
line of business for nine years. By
this time, owing to the extension of
his landed interests, it became
incumbent upon him to pay more
attention to the development of this
branch of his industry, and relin-
quishing his connection with the
butchering trade, he has since
applied himself almost exclusively to
the improvement of his holdings,
with the result that he has built up
for himself a very fine proposition.
Mr. Kavanagh as a youth was pro-
minent in the football field, and
excelled in this manly exercise. He
is fond of a good horse, and occasion-
ally indulges in the excitement of a
race meeting. His marriage took

THOMAS ROSE, J.P., formerly
of “Rosemount,” Gatton, was born
at Maidenhead, England, on Novem-
ber 19, 1846, being the third son of
the late John Rose, a descendant of
an old Berkshire farming family.
He was educated in the national
schools of his native county, and
upon the termination of his studies
entered commercial life as junior
hand in a grocery establishment,
which post he held for some four or
five years. While still in his teens,
in the early sixties, he proceeded to
London, where he was engaged for
over 11 years in the firm of Messrs.
J. & R. Morley, the well-known
hosiery manufacturers of the world’s
metropolis. In 1875, on account of
the somewhat unsatisfactory condi-
tions prevailing in mercantile circles
in Great Britain, he sailed for Aus-
tralia, having as fellow-passenger
the late Honourable John Leahy—
and being provided with excellent
credentials found no difficulty upon
arrival in securing a position in the
establishment of Messrs. Cribb and
Foote, of Ipswich. A decade later
he relinquished his connection with
the firm in order to take control of
the ironmongery branch of a busi-
ness owned by the late James Foote,
a prominent figure for many years in
the public and legislative life of

in Berkshire, England, and taking
the opportunity to enlarge his know-
ledge and experience by travelling to
near Ipswich for nearly three years;
but desiring to make a permanent
home for his family, in 1895 he pur-
chased a holding in the Gatton dis-
trict, and continued to develop this
property, assisted by his sons, until
disposing of it in 1915. Mr. Rose
spared no expense in the erection of
a pretty modern house and in install-
ing the various auxiliaries required
to conduct mixed-farming operations
on the most approved principles.
He has always taken a considerable
interest in public affairs, and was
created a Justice of the Peace by
the Kidston Administration. He is
a member of the Church of England,
and was a parochial councillor of St.
Aubyn’s, Gatton, and a synodsman
on behalf of the parish. A Good
Templar for over 40 years, he took
a deep and active interest in all per-
taining to the welfare of the youth
of the neighbourhood, while his ex-
perience as a Sunday-school teacher
dates back to his boyhood days in
England, his work in this direction
having been sustained with inde-
fatigable zeal for close on half a
century, besides which his services
as a lay preacher were highly
appreciated. Mr. Rose disposed of

Scotland for the purpose of witness-

of his adoption, he turned his atten-

Rose married, at Ipswich, Christina
Turner, daughter of the late William
Cramb, a builder and contractor of
the pioneer days of the State, whose

in the Ipswich and Goodna districts.
He has a family of four sons and

HENRY LOWE, “Framptou,”
Gatton, was born at Leigh, Glouces-
tershire, England, on August 1,
1843, and is the fourth son of the
late William Lowe, who followed
the calling of contractor in that
county, which had been the home
of the Lowe family for many genera-
tions. Educated at the local school
at Leigh, young Lowe continued his
studies until of a fit age to enter
upon the serious duties of life, when
he was taken in hand by his father,
whom he assisted in his work until
the momentous decision was made
that the lad should seek wider fields
in which to work out his destiny,
his departure being the first move
of this kind among his circle of
relatives in England. Taking pas-
sage by the “Fiery Star,” an ill-
fated vessel, which was wrecked
shortly afterwards on her return
trip to Great Britain, Mr. Lowe
lauded at Keppel Bay, Queensland,
on November 9, 1864. After arrival
he knocked about the country for a
year, acquainting himself with the
conditions under which Queens-
landers lived, eventually settling on
the land early in the year 1866.

of those beneficent forces which
play such a large part in the scheme
of those to whom the year of
drought, floods, or a visitation of
some pest, may mean tremendous
loss. Some short time after Mr.
Lowe’s advent to this State he was
followed by his brother Joseph, who
took up adjoining land, and by
degrees the brothers reaped full
advantage of each other’s vicinity
by conjointly working various
departments, and co-operating in the
development of their holdings to
their mutual gain. As their families
increased this principle of mutual
assistance was heartily entered into
by the younger members, and has
been one of the chief factors in the
marked progress which has been
such a prominent feature of both
propositions. From time to time
additional land was taken up by
Mr. Lowe and his brother, and
eventually Mr. Joseph Lowe retired
from active agricultural pursuits
and settled in Gatton. The gentle-
man under review, however, has
continued to reside on the property,
and in conjunction with those of his
sons who have elected to remain on
the home farm, still engages in the
conduct of what is regarded as one
of the most advanced holdings
devoted to tillage and grazing in the
district. Mr. Henry Lowe was
married in 1866 to Sarah Ann,
daughter of the late John Ford, also
of Gloucester, England, who came to
join her future husband soon after
he settled on the land, and has since
with conspicuous success played the
difficult and honourable part of the
pioneer wife, accepting with forti-
tude and courage the many priva-
tions, trials, and hardships insepar-
able from life in the back-blocks.
Mr. Lowe has devoted the whole of
his life to the founding of a home
and the bringing up of a large
family, and may be fairly accounted
one of the most successful of men.
Of a family of five sons and four
daughters surviving, the eldest and
youngest sous are associated with
their father on the home farm, two
are engaged in commercial pursuits,
and another, Mr. Walter C. Lowe,
is a well-known Sydney solicitor;
while three of the daughters are
married, two being resident in the
State and one in Victoria. Having
passed his allotted span of three
score years and ten, Mr. Lowe
frequently recalls the time when, as
the first settler in the Gatton dis-
trict he had to carve a home out of
the wild, unpeopled bush, with no
neighbours within a radius of many
miles, saving only the hordes of
uncivilized blacks, who at the best
could never be depended upon. The
lonely and desolate country now
smiles with the cultivation fields of
many farms, among which “Framp-
ton” occupies an honoured place,
and in the half century which has
elapsed Mr. Lowe has honourably
fulfilled his share of effort towards
the building up of the great Aus-
tralian nation


ALFRED HALCOLM SMITH,
J.P., “Smithfield,” Gatton, was
born in the vicinity of the famous
British Museum, London, on Octo-
ber 26, 1846, and is a son of the
late Charles Smith, who, like his
fathers before him, was engaged in
business pursuits in the world's
metropolis. The gentleman under
review received his education at
Cambridge House Collegiate School,
under the late James Stevens, LL.B.,
then headmaster of that institution,
and at the age of 15 relinquished his
studies in order to enter mercantile
lifein theclerical branch of thewhole-
sale wine and spirit trade. He gained
a varied experience in several houses
of repute, and continued in this line
of business for about 10 years. In
1871, being deeply impressed with
the favourable reports of Australia
furnished by an old schoolfellow who
had settled in Queensland and met
with considerable success in the land
of his adoption, Mr. Smith resolved
to say good-bye to kindred and
friends and make a tilt at fortune
on the other side of the ocean.
Accordingly he took passage by the
sailing vessel ' Ramsey,” and having
landed at Moreton Bay immediately
set to work to gain the necessary
“colonial experience,” for which
purpose he engaged in farming
avocations, and was also concerned in
a butchering business, during which
time he gradually became familiar
with the conditions prevailing in

the new country where he had
thrown in his lot. To obtain some
knowledge of the interior he under-
took a trip for the overlanding of
cattle to the north, and whilst on
this expedition passed through

dangerous type. Having spent some
12 months in this class of work, he
again became interested in the

farming industry in conjunction
with the late Walter A. Cross, who
quickly recognized the reliable
character of the man with whom he
was associated, and used his influence
to secure for him a position of trust
on the staff employed in the con-
struction of the railway, on which
Mr. Cross himself occupied an
important engineering post. At
this time the construction of the
line from Ipswich to Brisbane
had just been started, and this
appointment led to his permanent
employment by the Government as
an officer in the Traffic Department,
with which he was identified for
about 30 years, holding the posi-
tion of stationmaster at Helidon,
McAlister, Murphy Creek, Laidley,
Caboolture, and Cleveland succes-
sively. He retired from the last-
named station in order to settle
down to farming pursuits at “Smith-
field,” his present holding, which he
had taken up as virgin country soon
after his advent to Queensland, and
which he had continued to develop
during the long period of his service
in the Railway Department, his
family having been in residence
there for some years before his
retirement from the service. The
extent of the “Smithfield” property
is 866 acres, over which is found
principally that rich quality of soil
for which the areas immediately
below the ranges are famous. Mixed
farming is carried on successfully,
and a specialty is made of dairying,
but to Mr. Smith the chief source
of interest on the farm is found in
the production of crops of various
kinds, of which he makes a hobby.
Standing on a fine, elevated site is
the substantial residence built by
him for the accommodation of his
family, the picturesque appearance
of which is enhanced by a thick belt
of natural timber which has been left
standing in its virgin beauty. Mr.
Smith is a lover of the beautiful,
and in a modest way is a student of
art, making painting in oils one of
his channels of recreation; he is also
fond of reading, and keeps himself
abreast of the times by the perusal
of current literature in its various
forms. He is a Justice of the Peace,
having received his commission from
the Denham Ministry. On August 23,
1875, his marriage took place with
Margaret, daughter of the late
George Ovens, a Queenslander of
half a century back, who was
associated with the railway service
of the State in its infancy. Of this
union there is a surviving family of
four sons and four daughters. In
1884 Mr. and Mrs. Smith with their
children voyaged to the Old Country,
where they visited many places of
historical and personal interest, Mr.
Smith’s boyhood home being among
the number.
JOHN JOSEPH BYRNE, of
“Borris,” Gatton, is a native of
Tinnecarrig, County Carlow, Ire-
land, where he was born on May 8,


1874, his father, the late Michael
Byrne, being a member of an old-
established Irish family who had
carried on farming pursuits in that
county for many generations. At the
conclusion of his education, which,
begun at the national school at Inch,
was completed at Bonds in his
native -county, the 14-year-old lad
was placed on his paternal grand-
father’s farm to learn the agricul-
tural industry. Whilst pursuing
his daily round of tasks, however,
his thoughts continually turned to a
land beyond the seas, where his
uncle (Mr. James Byrne, of Gatton,
mentioned elsewhere in this volume)
had worked out a successful career
for himself, and before attaining his
twenty-first birthday he sailed for
Harris & Summers, Gatton.
MR. JOHN JOSEPH BYRNE.
Queensland. Upon his arrival at the
end of 1894 he joined his uncle
and first found employment in
driving the mail coach between
Gatton and “Buaraba” Station, at
the same time making a study of
the methods of farming then in
vogue. Acting on the advice of
Mr. James Byrne, in the year fol-
lowing that of his arrival he seized
the opportunity to secure a block of
land comprising some 2,000 acres of
the old “Buaraba” Station. Having
expended the major part of his
limited capital in purchasing the
holding, he decided to devote a few
months to augmenting his finances,
and accordingly he contracted to
overland a mob of cattle from
the Diamantina district to the Dar-
ling Downs, and in this way,
besides attaining his main object of
replenishing his exchequer, consider-
ably enlarged his knowledge of
the country, gathering much valu-
able information respecting the pas-
toral industry as carried on in
Queensland. His next step was to
purchase stock, and pursuing the
method of buying in small lots and
selling quickly in advantageous
markets soon made good headway in
this direction. Continuing his policy
of employing slack seasons with
outside work, he took contracts for
roadmaking, and it was not until
1903 that he finally determined
to confine his efforts solely to
his grazing proposition. Being a
keen jndge of horseflesh and a
genuine lover of the equine race,
by degrees he established a
small stud, of which he has
made something of a hobby. He

religious progress of the neighbour-
hood, being an officer of the Gatton
branch of the 11.A.C.8.5., of which
he was one of the founders, and
taking a prominent part in the local
Roman Catholic Church. In 1910 he
married Helena, daughter of Mr.
Patrick O’Shea, of Thagoona, Queens-
land, who occupies an honoured
place among the ranks of those who
pioneered the agricultural and
grazing industries of the State, and
amid the burden and heat of the
day laid those foundations of pros-
|>erity in these important depart-
ments which have stood the test of
the years. Mrs. Byrne’s mother is
descended from one of the most
notable yeoman families of County
Meath, Ireland, where for centuries
its various branches have been
settled on the land, occupying
ancient homesteads, and doing their
part towards the building up of the
Empire. There is one son of this
union.
JOHN SIMON GOLDMAN,
general merchant, Gatton, was born
at Jutroschin, Province of Posen,
Germany, his father, the late Isidor
Goldman, having carried on business
as a miller and grain and produce
merchant in that town, and subse-
quently in other more important
centres of the Fatherland, and ulti-
mately settling at Breslau, the capital
of Silesia. For generations the family
of Goldman has followed commercial
pursuits in the confines of the Ger-
man Empii’e, and at the close of his
education, which he received at
Rawitsch, when 15 years of age the
subject of this notice was appren-
ticed to the drapery trade. Having
completed his indentures, however,
he decided to break away from the
tradition of his fathers, so far as
remaining in the land of his birth
w r as concerned, and turned his face
towards distant climes, where the
inborn liberty of the individual was
more fully recognized than on his
native soil. Sailing for America at
the age of 20, he essayed to build
up a fortune in the New World, and
spent six years in the land of the
Stars and Stripes, travelling over the
different States of the Union in pur-
suit of his object. The chief asset—-
and a most valuable one—that he
gained by this procedure was a fund
of experience which fitted him for
further flights into the far-off
regions of the world that possessed
so strong an attraction for his adven-
turous spirit. Early in 1886 he took
passage by the “Mariposa” for Aus-
tralia, and landed at Sydney, where
he remained for a brief period before
continuing his travels to the more
northerly State, where he has since
MR. ISIDOR GOLDMAN.
made his permanent home. On
arrival at Brisbane, by one of the
chances of fate he fell in with an
old chum who had established
himself in business at Rosewood,
and under his auspices began his
acquaintance with life under the
Southern Cross. After acting as
assistant to this friend for a few
months he proceeded to Laidley, and
subsequently having obtained a fair
grip of prevailing conditions was
concerned in partnership for a short
time with a Mr. Schureck in a
trading concern at Lowood. Indi-
vidual effort appealing to him as a
shorter cut to competence, he dis-
posed of his interests in this business
to his partner, and opened for him-
self in a small way at Gatton, a
departure which proved of the
highest benefit to him in the carving
out of his career. The principles of
honest dealing and readiness to
oblige his customers in every way
which were soon apparent in Mr.
Goldman’s conduct of the business
early caused his operations to assume
proportions larger than his brightest
anticipations had promised, and the
next forward step was taken in the
purchase of the new premises, which
hitherto he had only leased. Steady
increase of custom and enlargement
of the various departments of trade
established followed, until gradually
was built up one of the soundest
business propositions in operation
between the city of Ipswich and
the Range. Although, as is
only natural in a district where
the farmer may be regarded as the
backbone of the population, the
necessities of agricultural and pas-
toral enterprise are perhaps special-
ized to some extent, the business is
essentially general in character, and
requirements of every kind are
catered for. Like most successful
men, Mr. Goldman has not remained
satisfied with opening up for himself
one avenue to prosperity, but has
vested interests in other parts of the
State, in the future of which he has
unbounded confidence. Locally he
is looked upon as a sure supporter,
both financially and morally, of all
movements conducive to the well-
being of the community of which he
forms a unit; but, being a true lover
of home, he has concerned himself
but little with the honours of public
office, preferring rather family plea-
sures and the recreation and stimulus
of a good book in his leisure hours.
He married in 1896 Eliza, daughter
of the late Edward England, one of
the pioneer farmers who settled in
Queensland in the early days of its
colonization, and followed farming
occupations in the Lake Clarendon

native laud, and upon arrival in
Queensland attended a night school
in Toowoomba, whilst engaged in
daily occupation on his father’s
property. In 1869 he struck out for
himself, and taking up a small
holding on the range, worked it to
the best advantage in the time at
his disposal, his principal source of
income being derived from the carry-
ing business in Toowoomba district.
This occupation he followed for some
seven years, until upon medical
advice he was compelled to leave the
Downs for a more sheltered and
congenial climate at the foot of the
ranges. Having considered the rival
merits of various centres, he finally
decided to settle in the Gatton dis-
trict, and in 1876 took up a portion
of the land which now surrounds his
present holding, where he has lived
and pursued an active, industrious
career for over 40 years. Some 2,000
acres have by degrees come into Mr.
Miller’s possession, and he makes full
use of this fine area, carrying on a
prosperous mixed-farming proposi-
tion, which embraces winemaking as
an auxiliary to its chief industries of
fruitgrowing and grazing. A most
comfortable homestead of modern
design has been erected recently to
take the place of the old home,
which lies in close proximity, and
this newer building presents a fine
appearance fully in keeping with the
status of the property as one of the
most important of its kind in the
neighbourhood. On account, how-
ever, of the recent three dry seasons
in succession it is at present devoid
of garden, and in this respect must
yield in charm to the original dwell-
ing, which is surrounded by orna-
mental shrubs, and enjoys the near
vicinity of one of the most successful
orchard and vineyard areas in the
district, where many varieties of
fruit come to perfection. Mr. Miller,
who is of a quiet, retiring disposi-
tion, is well known and respected by
those who can best appreciate the
value of his long years of steady and
strenuous endeavour, resulting in

the establishment of a thoroughly
thriving property, and the building
up of a home where future genera-
tions shall rise to do him honour.
He married in 1869 Rosina, daugh-
ter of the late Sebastian Wensell,
one of the old pioneers from Ger-
many who demonstrated their worth
as settlers on Queensland soil in the
days when the agricultural industry
was yet in its infancy. A family of
one son and four daughters survive.
Mr. Martin Miller, only son of the
foregoing gentleman, was born on
the property where he now resides
on April 26, 1879, and received his
education at the Spring Vale State
School. His studies concluded, he
joined his father in farming pur-
suits, and has ever since continued
on the home farm, though he also
interests himself to some extent in
grazing on independent lines.
Although still taking some part in
the working of the proposition, Mr.
Miller, sen., entrusts to his son
much of the more important man-
agement of affairs, and the latter is
also gradually taking his father’s
place in the public life of the dis-
trict, being a member of the Lockyer
Agricultural Society and of the local
race club; besides which he takes a
deep interest in church matters and
in the affairs of the H.A.C.B.S. in

destined to become one of Queens-
land’s earliest German settlers, mak-
ing his advent to this State in the
early sixties. After arrival the late
Mr. Ebert was for some years
engaged in farming occupations in
the employ of the late John Blain,
who owned a property at Ipswich,
and subsequently, having gained a
good working knowledge of stock,
during 10 years spent in the land of
his adoption, he selected 640 acres
on the Brisbane River, near Esk,
and proceeded to develop it on his
own behalf. The first step was to
build a bark-and-slab humpy after
the style in vogue among the original
settlers, with no pretensions to
appearance, but sufficiently comfort-
able to provide necessary shelter
for his wife and growing family.
Then followed the hard and strenu-
ous days of laying a foundation for
future prosperity, when the barest
necessities of life were all that could
be afforded, and the settlers learned
the full meaning of privation and
hardship. Perseverance, industry,
and unremitting toil, however, won
the day, and for nearly half a
century the brave old pioneer con-
tinued farming operations, during
that period winning the esteem of
all with whom he was associated
for his integrity, honesty of purpose,
and singleness of mind. He died
just before completing the allotted
span of three score years and ten.
Mr. Ebert married just before leav-
ing his native country, and his 10
children were all born on Australian
soil. His second son, Mr. J. K. G.
Ebert, now of “Lake Vale” Farm,
first saw the light at Ipswich on
July 26, 1869, and received his
education at a provisional school at
Moombra. From a very early age
he took readily to work on the farm,
and became thoroughly versed in all
the details of successful dairying.
Upon reaching years of maturity
he secured the management of the
Bellevue Model Dairy Creamery,
under the able supervision of the
late John McCormack, whose experi-
ence proved of the utmost value to
him. After filling this position for
five years, in 1899 he purchased a
portion of the "Lake Clarendon”
Estate, the original extent of his
holding being 348 acres, to which
he has since added considerably, the
present area of his grazing land
being over 2,500 acres. This he
proceeded to develop, and conjointly
with his operations in this direction
turned his attention to the carrying
business, chiefly in connection with
the dairying and timber industries.
By degrees, as his private dairying
proposition attained to larger pro-
portions, he relinquished carrying
for other dairy farmers, confining
his business in this line solely to the
timber trade, and the severing of

he had been associated for a lengthy

Mr. Andrew Philp, sen., also pre-
ceded their father to Australia and
are now settled in Queensland.
After spending the greater portion
of his life as Inspector of Inland
Revenue for Scotland, upon his
retirement Mr. Philp followed his
family to the antipodes, and this
descendant of an old Fife ancestry
is now quietly spending the evening
of his life amid scenes differing
widely from those which environed
his youth and early manhood. Mr.
Andrew Philp, jun., was educated
at the Inverness Academy and
an Aberdeen grammar school,
and upon completion of his col-
legiate course became apprenticed to
the mercantile marine with the
Clutha Shipping Company, trading
to the continent of Europe, Aus-
tralia, and India. Having visited
these countries Mr. Philp decided
after a couple of years at sea to
follow the example of his paternal
relatives and take up land in Aus-
tralia. Arriving at Queensland in
1879 he gained his first experience
of bush life on a cattle station, and
subsequently proceeding northwards
was engaged in the sugar industry
at Millaquin and on the Lower
Burdekin for some years. From here
he drifted again into pastoral work
in the Gulf Country and the
Northern Territory, essaying and
carrying through successfully the
responsible task of overlanding cattle
over these vast territories, at a
period close on 30 years ago, when
the conditions were such that only
the strongest and most courageous
could win through. Nearly 10 years
after his first arrival in the State, in
1888, he returned to the more
settled southern areas, and taking
up a small block of land at Mount
Whitestone commenced its develop-
ment as a fruitgrowing and cattle
proposition. This holding he has
enlarged from time to time, and
to-day has a well-improved area of
500 acres. Some 35 acres of the

now being some 7,000 to 8,000
cases, Mr. Philp having achieved
the distinction of being the
biggest exporter of citrus products
in the State. The grazing of from
150 to 200 head of cattle constitutes
the only other branch of industry
carried on at “Glen Ellen.” Mr.
Philp’s public activities have
been chiefly concerned with the
conditions under which the fruit-
growing industry should be pursued
in this State, and he was first in
Queensland to treat orange trees
with hydrocyanic acid gas. He
is a foundation member of the
Queensland Fruitgrowers’ Industrial
Trading Society, and has filled
the position of honorary delegate
for Queensland to the Interstate
Fruitgrowers’ Conference, which
is an annual function held at
various centres. In local government
he occupied a seat on the Tarampa
Divisional Board before the estab-
lishment of shire councils; and
always takes a hearty interest in all
movements affecting the well-being
of the district. He was married in
1888 to Jane Caroline Augusta,
daughter of the late Samuel Dear,
one of the original pioneers of Ma
Ma Creek, who came from Bedford-
shire, England, and was a Queens-
land colonist of over half a century.
Of this union there are two sons and
two daughters.

worked by them as a joint proposi-
tion. The nucleus of the property
was originally taken up by the late
William Ryan, father of the gentle-
men under review, who left his birth-
place in County Tipperary, Ireland,
with his wife and two children, and
arrived at Queensland in June, 1864.
Landing at Moreton Bay, the little
party proceeded by boat to
Ipswich, where they were met
by Mrs. Ryan’s brother, the late
Patrick Horrigan, who was one
of Queensland’s earliest pioneers,
and almost the original settler at
Stony Pinch; and under his conduct
they continued their journey by
horse team to Toowoomba. Mr. Ryan
took up his abode in what was then
known as Irishtown, a locality now
covered by several of Toowoomba’s
suburbs, and for some time con-
tinued in the employ of his brother-
in-law, who was farming in that
neighbourhood. After a while he
enlarged his experience in the
shearing sheds, and became familiar
with the processes of sheep wash-
ing, clipping, and wool pressing
and packing, etc. Subsequently he
decided to take work on the perma-
nent way in the Railway Depart-
ment, and still later, but prior to
the days of local control, as an
employe of the Government he was
engaged in road construction work
round about Toowoomba. In the
meantime, in October, 1874, a
departure had been made in another
direction by the selection of a home-
stead block of 126 acres in the
vicinity of Helidon, where the
family came to reside, while Mr.
Ryan continued to work on the
roads; and here Mrs. Ryan began a
heroic struggle to develop the little
farm with her hands already full in
bringing up her young family. The
country was practically virgin bush,
being wild and rugged, with only a
bridle path to connect the settlers’
home with the primitive group of
buildings which represented civiliza-
tion at the little centre known as
Helidon, and much courage was
necessary to face the inevitable dis-
appointments and trials connected
with the working out of the propo-
sition which Mrs. Ryan had so

bravely undertaken with the aim of
assisting her husband in building up
the fortunes of the family. By
degrees the cottage assumed signs of
increasing prosperity, outbuildings
were erected, fencing taken in hand,
and small crops testified to the
activity of the managing head. As
the boys grew up they were able to
lend a hand in the work of the farm,
and after the venture had been
established for six or seven years
the head of the family saw his way
clear to relinquish outside employ-
ment and devote his attention
exclusively to his own interests on
the little property. His sons after
reaching manhood, while still assist-
ing their parents on the home acres,
gradually acquired adjoining hold-
ings on their own account, and from
the small beginnings recorded above
“Lilydale” has now grown to a pros-
perous farming proposition, embrac-
ing 2,000 acres, the whole area being
devoted to cropping and grazing.
The pastures are stocked with both
cattle and horses, but dairying
occupies the principal share of atten-
tion. Mr. William Ryan, J.P., is
the eldest son of the late William
Ryan, and was about two years of
age when his parents emigrated from
Ireland. During the whole of his
life, with but one short break, when
he was engaged in railway construc-
tion and contracting work on the
local roads, he has followed farming
occupations in the district where he
now resides, having first assisted on
the parent property, and subse-
quently purchased on his own
account a portion of the land which
now is embraced in the combined
proposition. He has been identified
with public life for some years as a
shire councillor for Tarampa; and
in 1912, was gazetted Justice of the
Peace by the Denham Administra-
tion. Mr. William Ryan’s reminis-
cences of the early days at Helidon
are full of interest, and as an indica-
tion of the kind of experiences which
pioneers had to face he recalls how

a foundation shareholder of the
Queensland Farmers’ Co-operative


Co., Ltd., of which he has been a
director for about 13 years, during
which period he has on two occasions
declined the chairmanship of the
company. Mr. Patrick Ryan, the
youngest of the three brothers, was
born at Toowoomba, in June, 1865,
and pursued his scholastic studies at
that centre and in Helidon. He
was identified with railway and road
construction work for some little
time, and joined forces with his
brothers on the farm some time prior
to the death of their father, which
occurred in February, 1900. Another
brother, the late James Joseph
Ryan, died in his early manhood at
Corinda, where he was stationmaster
in the Railway Department; whilst
the only sister lives with her brothers
at “Lilydale.”
PATRICK MAHON, J.P., of
“Tubberpatrick,” Flagstone Creek,
Helidon, was born at Tubberpatrick,
near Strokestown, County Roscom-
mon, Ireland, in March, 1863, and
is a son of the late Patrick Mahon,
of that place, where generations of
Mahons had lived and tilled the soil
before him. Mr. P. Mahon obtained
his knowledge of the rudiments of
learning partly under private tuition
and partly by an almost surrepti-
tious attendance at the old “hedge”
school, which, as its name suggests,
was of a very elementary character.
The scholastic acquirements gained

to make good the defects in his
training, and so brought his accom-

MR. PATRICK MAHON.
Being one of a family of 14 children,
after working on his father’s farm
for a time, at the age of 20 he
decided to look farther afield for
advancement in life, and accordingly
joined his uncle, the late John
March 27, 1883, Mr. Mahon became
connected with the traffic branch of
the Railway Department, in which
he continued for five years, being
stationed successively at Brisbane
and Roma. This period was folio-wed
by two years with his uncle on the
farm, where he gained an excellent
working knowledge of land and
stock management under different
conditions of soil, climate, etc., from
those to which he had been accus-
tomed in the Old Country. Subse-
quently he spent nearly five years
in railway construction work, and it
was not until 1891 that his ultimate
decision to devote his attention per-
manently to farming enterprise was
made. The old '“Grantham” Estate
having been cut up for closer settle-
ment, Mr. Mahon secured a portion
of this property upon which to
commence operations, and with some
financial assistance from his late
uncle put matters in train on such
a basis as, given fair average condi-
tions in the matter of seasons, etc.,
would be bound to ensure success.
At the present time the farm, which
has been enlarged to the size of 220
acres, is firmly established as one of
the very prosperous little dairy pro-
positions for which this district is
famous, besides which there is a
goodly portion under cultivation.
The homestead, erected in 1903 by
Mr. Mahon, is modern and roomy,

Mr. Mahon is a genuine lover of
literature, and finds his keenest
recreation in the perusal of a good
book; as a result he keeps himself
well abreast with the tide of modern
authors, and is thoroughly versed
in the trend of current events. He
has held the Commission of the
Peace for a lengthy period; and has
always taken a keen interest in
political matters, being a firm
believer in the principles of the
Liberal Party, and for the past 20
years has served in different capaci-
ties in the polling booths Tipon the
occasions of the various elections. In
1905 he married Catherine, daughter
of the late William Reynolds, who
came from Rattanaugh, County
Roscommon, Ireland, in the early
sixties, and was numbered among the
army of pioneers whose lives were
spent in laying the foundation of
farming enterprise in Queensland.
Of this marriage there are four sons
and one daughter.
BERNARD JOHN KLUCK, of
“Carpendale,” Helidon, was born at
Brunk, Germany, on August 28,
1871, where his father, the late
Michael Kluck, followed in the foot-
steps of many farming ancestors
until his decision to emigrate to
Queensland in 1873. Bringing his
family with him, the late Mr. Kluck
settled down to agricultural pursuits
in his adopted country, and in
common with so many of the early
pioneers of German birth did much
to develop the resources of the dis-
trict where he made his home. He
died in 1896, after a useful career,
highly respected for his honesty and
integrity, and leaving a memory
fragrant with the associations which

cluster round lives “to duty wed.”
Mr. B. J. Kluck, who was the
second son of his father, as a child
of two years accompanied his
parents to Australia, and subse-
quently received his education at
Tarampa in an elementary fashion,
the farm claiming his assistance as
soon as he was tall enough to
manipulate a plough handle. Whilst
working for his father on the land
he gave what time he could spare
to study, and is virtually self-
educated. Upon reaching man’s
estate he launched out on his own
account in the Tarampa district, and
conducted his own farm there for
nearly a decade, ultimately remov-
ing to Helidon, where he saw pros-
pects of improving his position. His
present property is one of the most
successful of its kind in the neigh-
bourhood, the chief products being
lucerne, maize, potatoes, etc., while
dairying is carried on on a small
scale. The soil is rich, and although
the acreage is comparatively limited,
skilled management has contrived to
secure results which could hardly be
exceeded throughout the State. Mr.
Kluck takes a keen interest in the
advancement of the district and of
his adopted country, and as one of
Australia’s most loyal citizens is
foremost in the support accorded to
the various patriotic funds inaugu-
rated to meet the need occasioned
by the war still (1918) raging in
Europe. He married in 1892 Minnie,
daughter of Mr. Frank Levandofski,
another of the sturdy sons of German
Poland, to whom the opening up of
many country districts of Queens-
land is partly due, and of this union
there is issue one son and two
daughters.
Crow’s Nest.
Crow’s Nest is a thriving town at the terminus of
a branch railway line running from Toowoomba for
thirty-four miles in a northerly direction and tapping
a large extent of the rich land of which so much of that
region of the State is composed. It is interesting to
record that the first settlement of the place consisted of
but seven families. This was in the early seventies, and
their holdings extended from what is known as
“Peachey’s Mill” to “The Old Woman’s Hut.” The
residents, being desirous of obtaining educational
facilities for what then was the rising generation of the
district, approached the Minister for Education of the
day with a request that the Government should establish
a State school. The Minister inquired how many
families would be benefited by the expenditure which
would be entailed, and on being informed that there
were only seven he was about to dismiss the application.
The deputation then announced that, though the
families numbered but seven, the children of school age
totalled no fewer that seventy. Yet, so slow were
Governments of that day to help the sturdy pioneers
who were building up Queensland’s future that the
best he could undertake was that, if the residents found
the timber and themselves erected the building, the
Department would provide a teacher. Finally the late
Mr. E. W. Pechey supplied the material free of cost,


and the residents speedily constructed the school. The
population of the same district to-day numbers between
five and six thousand.
The township of Crow’s Nest is just outside the
limits of the Darling Downs, being situated on the
eastern slope of the main range at an altitude of 1,784
feet above sea level. The train from Toowoomba crosses
the Great Divide, which separates the waters flowing
inland towards the interior of the continent from those
which find their outlet to the Pacific Ocean, at Hampton,
where the line touches a point 2,311 feet above sea level.
The run from Toowoomba is full of variety of scene.
A tramway connects with the railway at Hampton, the
former having been constructed by a sawmill proprie-
tary, which has an extensive mill hidden away some-
where in the forest-clothed ranges.
The district surrounding Crow’s Nest is admirably
suited to mixed farming, dairying and pig-raising
being the two principal industries. Excellent results
have also been obtained with wheat, barley, oats,
rye, lucerne, maize, potatoes, and many other
forms of farm produce: whilst immense areas of
first-class pastoral country are in occupation. Crows
Nest has its own butter factory, but considerable
VIEWS AT CROW’S NEST.
After the first few miles have been travex’sed and the
train has left Willowburn, the site of a public mental
hospital, lands of differing conformation are entered
upon, green hills, flats, ridges, scrub, clearings, gullies,
rough unimproved stretches, and pleasant faims
alternately flash past. At Meringandan the soils are of
rich chocolate, of varying shades of red, and the best
black. Wliere scrub has been cleared the land is excep-
tionally rich; but apparently the big timber country
as yet is more suitable for grazing than for agriculture.

quantities of cream are sent from the district
to the Downs Co-operative Dairy Co., at Too-
woomba. For forty years the locality has been
the scene of a busy trade in timber. Indeed, the
apparent wealth of the forests is one of the features
to attract the attention of the visitor. Pine, blackbutt,
stringybark, ironbark, turpentine, grey, red, and blue
gums—many of them of enormous size—straight-
stemmed young trees, stalwart and stately old eucalypte,
wattle, oaks, and ti-tree all serve to make stretches of
timber bewildering in their variety to the novice who
desii’es to ascertain their varying species. But, in


reality, the valuable timbers are becoming scarce. No
resoxxrces will withstand the onslaughts of the axeman
for nearly half a century without becoming deplenished,
unless steps are taken to replant saleable trees on a
commercially practicable plan; and, unfortunately, fox-
many years there was but little of technical foresight
about the maxxagement of Queensland’s forests. The
vai'ieties cut in greatest qxxantities by the sawmillers are
all descriptions of hardwoods and pines and bunyah
pines, but these are growixxg increasingly scarce, axxd
each year longer distances have to be penetrated in
order to get the timber in payable quantities.
The Shire of Crow’s Nest includes the parishes of
Djuan, Emu Creek, Nukeninda, Anduramba, and part
of the pax'ishes of Crow’s Nest, Douglas, and Eskdale.
The local authority was established by proclamation
in 1913, the Couxxcil consisting of nine councillors, who
represent three divisions. This body holds authority
over 368 square xniles. The annual assessments amount
to about £I,BOO, and a total length of some 300 miles
of roads have to be maintained. Crow’s Nest was
created a township in 1875, and the railway to thex’e
BERNARD SKELLY, J.P.,
of Crow’s Nest, is a native of
Queensland, having been born at
Toowoomba, on April 16, 1860. He
is the eldest son of Mr. Patrick
Skelly, who came to Queensland
from West Meath, Ireland, and com-
menced his Australian career by
undertaking station work, turning
his hand to all manner of avocations
connected with pastoral enterprise,
and eventually by sheer force of
character and industry acquiring a
competency, and spending his later
years in comfortable circumstances.
Mr. Bernard Skelly was associated
with his father in his different
spheres of labour during his early
youth, and in 1876 found his way
to Crow’s Nest, becoming on© of the
pioneers of this now prosperous dis-
trict. All the conditions of the
country were primitive in the
extreme at that period, and all
stores, furniture, fanning imple-
ments, everything necessary to
existence and the canying on of
land development, quite apart from
luxuries, having to be brought by
waggon from the nearest centre of
any impoi’tance, the settlers at
Crow’s Nest drawing their supplies
from Toowoomba. The hardships
experienced by the brave pioneer
band who opened up these areas
for settlement can be more easily
imagined Qian described, and of
these the gentleman under review
suffered his full share. In the year
1882 he selected 40 acres of land on
Emu Creek, and for 11 years devoted
his energies to the breeding of
cattle, in which industry he met

of the town is estimated at about 1,000, but many times
that number live in the immediate neighbourhood, the
land being sufficiently fertile and the rainfall bountiful
enough to accelerate closer settlement for a good
many years jxast. The Shire is estimated to hold a
population of 3,500, but that of the country which has
Crow’s Nest as its natural centre amounts to nearly
6,000. The Education Department has found it necessary
to establish and maintain no fewer than twelve schools
within the Crow’s Nest Shix - e. The town has many
improvements, including a recreation resei've, show
grounds, and a racecourse, as well as the usaial public
buildings. A water supply has been established at a
cost of only £5OO. Ixxdeed, the ease with which water
can be obtained almost axxywhere ixx the neighbourhood
forms one of the characteristics of the locality. The
climate is particularly pleasant, the benefit of high
altitude being combined with that of a situation on the
coastal side of the maiix range, so that xxo iixtervening
heights can cut off either the cool breezes or the xnoisture-

proved an unqualified success from
the day of its inception. Ultimately
he disposed of his landed interests,
and in conjunction with his commer-

of the district. He exerted himself to
establish the .local Chamber of
Commerce, and his activities as a
committeeman of this chamber have
been of the utmost value to the
organization. The honour of the
Commission of the Peace was
conferred upon him as a recog-
nition due to one of the most
prominent and conscientious men in
the district. His energies largely
contributed to the founding of the
local branch of the Hibernian
Society, and he is also known far
and wide as a “good sport,” being
one of the founders of the Crow’s

early stage of its histoxy, he was

JOHN ALEXANDER McRAE,
J.P., of "Raeburn,” is the second
son of the late John Mcßae, who
came from Rosshire, Scotland, in the
year 1838, and settled in the
Hunter district of New South Wales.
After residing there for several
years, doing some very heavy and
valuable pioneering work, and assist-
ing to lay the foundation of the
prosperity which afterwards followed
his footsteps throughout the district,
he took up land on the Inolongolo
Creek, and blazed a further pathway
for future generations in the virgin
bush of what was then but little-
known territory. Later he sold this
property, and for a third time
pioneered settlement out “in the
beyond” by taking up land at Clear
Hills, near Taralaga, still in the
State of New South Wales. This
property he retained until the day
of his death, which occurred in 1884,
and it remained in possession of his
family for many years afterward.
It is, perhaps, rather unnecessary to
state that the fine old gentleman
won the respect and esteem of all

which in itself is far more eloquently
expressive than whole pages of

ever, be imagined from this appella-
tion that Mr. Macßae is an elderly
gentleman, for such is far from
being the case, he now (1915) being
in the full vigour of lusty, middle-
aged manhood. He commenced his
career by selecting land in the dis-
trict in which his father’s property
was situated Taralaga but the
pioneering instincts of his fine
Scottish ancestry soon asserted them-
selves, and disposing of his holding,
he went droving “out west.” This
life just suited his wild and adven-
turous spirit, for he stuck to it for
five years, during which he did well,
and was making money at the time
his father died, when he found
himself executor of the family
estate. This anchored him in one
spot for several years, and he con-
tinued the administration of affairs
with all the ability of a shrewd and
practical Scot, until his younger
brothers arrived at manhood’s
estate, when his independent spirit
again asserted itself, inducing him

warm respect and esteem with which
he is regarded throughout and far
beyond the Crow’s Nest district. To
all and sundry he is just “Old Mac,”
to relinquish these duties to take
up a leasehold in the district.
This was in 1897, and it is signifi-
cant that he entered upon his


undertaking with only £BO in hand,
convincing evidence, if such were
that he had not lavishly
over-estimated the value of his ser-
vices at the expense of his younger
brothers during his period of control
of affairs. The annual rental of his
leasehold was precisely the amount
of his total capital, and he paid a
quarter s rent in advance, purchased
80 head of cattle with the remaining
and faced the future with
nothing but his equipment, his
brains, and his courage. Judged by

the problem—he just (apparently
without effort) won the confidence of
the community, and established a
valuable reputation for keeping his
word. His promise was regarded as
being as good or better than the
signature of many far wealthier
men, hence the support accorded him
throughout the district. After a few
years (in 1900) he gave up his lease,
and purchased a property in the
Coaldale district, but soon sold it
and secured another on Myrtle
beauty spots in an exceedingly
picturesque landscape. Mr. Mcßae
was returned as a member of the
Crow’s Nest Shire when the council
was first gazetted, and has retained
his seat ever since (1915), at times
occupying the chair. He was created
a Justice of the Peace about 1911, is

school committee, and put up a
great fight for the establishment of
a school in the most convenient spot
for all concerned. He loves his dis-

the same year he acquired “Rae-

MR. WILLIAM LUKE MITCHELL.
via Crow’s Nest, is a native of St.
Goran, Cornwall, England, being a
son of Mr. William Luke Mitchell,
one of the early pioneers of the
district whose name was much in
evidence in the days of initial settle-
ment, now dating back over 40
years ago. Mr. Mitchell, sen., came
to Australia from Cornwall by the
sailing-ship “Great Queensland”
with his two sons, the elder, Mr.
William John Mitchell, now settled
in the Miles district of this State,
and the subject of this article, who
was then in his eleventh year. Upon
the arrival of this trio of pioneers—
the younger members of the party
having by their energetic and indus-
trious co-operation with their father
fully established their claim to the
appellation Mr. Mitchell, sen.,
almost immediately took up land
from the Government at Crow’s
Nest, the selection being situated
about three miles north of that
centre. The original farm consisted
of a homestead area of 640 acres,
which was carried on by the father
and sons as a mixed-farming propo-
sition for a number of years. In
course of time, as the conditions
allowed of a measure of comfoi't in
the home life, which necessarily was
absent in earlier days, the small

who now lives (1915) in retirement at
“Goran-Haven,” Mowbray Terrace,
East Brisbane, where he enjoys the
leisure earned by his earlier years of
enterprise, was associated with one
of the first co-operative movements
in Toowoomba, and may be said to
have played a useful part in the
development of what was before his
advent almost an untouched district.
His name became an honoured one
among the hardy sons of the open
country where he in common with
his fellows built up a sound consti-
tution which gives him, even at an
advanced age, the inestimable bless-
ings of sound health and the
strength of mind and body which
clean living among wholesome sur-
roundings is ever apt to promote.
The gentleman under review, who
was his father’s second son, was born
on December 11, 1862, and received
his early education in his native
village in Cornwall. Later he
attended the normal school, Bris-
bane, also obtaining instruction at
a public school at Crow’s Nest,
whilst giving his spare hours to work
on the home farm. At the termina-
tion of his studies the hours were
extended into whole days spent in
the fields round the homestead, and
in this way the young Britisher
early became acquainted with all the
best methods of farming then in
vogue. While yet in his later teens,
with his father’s assistance he
selected his present homestead hold-
ing—then comprising 1,180 acres—
and long before reaching man’s
estate had thrown his whole heart
and soul into the project of building
up a home for himself, where future
generations of Mitchells might carry
on a thriving industry and a
venerated name. With unremitting
energy and zeal he pursued his task
late and early, esteeming no effort
too great which should bring him
nearer the achievement of his ambi-
tion, and ere long his endeavours
were richly rewarded by the sight of
smiling cultivation and pasture fields
which had been reclaimed from the
virgin scrub, and sleek stock brows-
ing over the former lurking places of
wild denizens of the bush. Having
established his first holding as an
improved property, Mr. Mitchell
turned hie attention to the acquire-
i,i.2
ment of further territory in the
vicinity of his homestead, and by
purchase of adjoining blocks as they
came into the market, brought his
landed possessions surrounding "St.
Aubyn’s” up to a total of some 3,000
acres; while in addition to this
valuable acreage he owns grazing
leaseholds of about 35,000 acres
at Surat and on the Dawson
River. The homestead property is
situated 18 miles north of Crow’s
Nest, in the Emu Creek district,
being watered to a great extent by
that tributary of the Brisbane River.
Springs are also found throughout
the estate, and wells have been sunk
in convenient places, assisting to
make the property what it is gener-
ally regarded as, an ideal grazing
and mixed-farming area, which
under the skilled management of its
owner yields results highly credit-
able to the district. Very early in
Mr. Mitchell’s career he began to
evince an interest in all movements
having for their object the improve-
ment of existing conditions in the
district where he had settled, and
especially in the system of co-opera-
tion, which was beginning to attract
considerable discussion. One of his
efforts in the direction of public
service was in the capacity of a
promoter of the Crow’s Nest Co-
operative Butter Factory, of which
he continued a member of the board
of directors for many years. He also
took a prominent part in the estab-
lishment of the Queensland Farmers’
Co-operative Distributing Agency,
and served on the controlling board
of this body for seven years. At a
later period he made time again to
assist in the institution of yet
another co-operative venture in con-
nection with the bacon industry in
the Brisbane district, which at the
present time is well known as a first-
class thriving concern. Mr. Mitchell
has made a close study of co-opera-
tive principles, and as a protest
against inroads on the system,
although a member of the Farmers’
Union, without any expectation of
success, he stood as a candidate for
Parliament opposing the nominee of
that party, thus demonstrating his
honesty of purpose and disregard of
personal considerations. Shortly
after the inauguration of the Crow’s
Nest Shir© Council Mr. Mitchell was
elected to represent No. 2 Division
of that body, in which his mature
judgment and wide knowledge have
given great weight to his utterances.
Every movement for the uplifting of
the community receives hie cordial
support, and the sacred cause of
charity finds a ready response at his
hande. Mr. Mitchell married in
1893 Mary Ann, daughter of the
late Matthew Gleeson, one of the
hardy sons of Ireland who have
proved themselves such excellent
settlers in Britain’s overseas domin-
ions. Of this union there is issue
three sons and four daughters.
The late GEORGE LOVEDAY, of
Abbingdon Hill, Crow’s Nest, was
one of those grand, picturesque, old
pioneers who assisted well and truly
to lay the foundation of Queens-
land’s present prosperity. A son of
the late Thomas Loveday, of Great
Chishall, Cambridgeshire, England,
a gentleman justly esteemed and
respected throughout the eastern
Counties, Mr. George Loveday
landed at Brisbane on Christmas
Day, 1854. He came out in
the sailing ship “General Hewitt,”
and found himself in a new country
without a single shilling in his
pocket; but nothing daunted at once
took on a job of stock-riding, and
by way of an introduction to his new
occupation he was bucked through a
window into the kitchen of a station
whereon he was employed. Later he
entered into partnership with Mr.
James Murphy, and for five years
the partners successfully ran the
“Crow’s Nest” Estate, grazing many
thousand head of cattle to their
mutual advantage. In those days it
was a rare thing for the pioneers to
see a white face once in six months,
while the blacks were far more
plentiful than welcome, indeed, so
pertinacious were the latter in their
depredations that it was quite a
custom of theirs to slash slices of
flesh from the living cattle in the
stockyards and devour it while it was
yet warm. Mr. Loveday next entered
into a contract to drive cattle for
Mr. W. B. T. Tooth, and followed
this occupation for about 11 years;
during that period of his career


some very vivid sidelights are thrown
uoon conditions prevailing in those
early days. There was scarcely any
local demand for meat, consequently
practically all stock was sent to the
several boiling-down plants in the
back country and in the capital.
Mr. Loveday had a keen recollection
of a peculiar species of cattle which
existed in the days of his youth
which are deserving of comment.
These were so fat and heavy, prob-
ablv owing to having been bred upon
unlimited grazing territory, that
when going down the main range
their shoulder blades became dis-
located, and as they were unable
to rise again, they were killed, the
grease from their carcases subse-
quently deluging the ground for
many yards around. Adventures
with a considerable admixture of
hardshin swarmed thick and fast
upon young Loveday, as he steadily
fought his way towards future pros-
perity. Upon one occasion he was
overtaken by floods, took refuge
upon the roof of a hut in company
with two women and five men, and
finally had to knock walls out of the
edifice to prevent it from being
washed away. During this stressful
Mr. Loveday at great risk went
to the rescue, and saved his life.

veterinary surgeon, Mr. Loveday was
once cutting a cancer from a beast
when a fly stung him and started a
bleeding cancer upon his arm. This
entailed his eldest daughter driving
him daily for six consecutive months
to a doctor in a neighbouring town.
Human patience, however, has its
limits, and one day in a fit of dis-
gust he emptied a bottle of raw
spirits of salt upon the sore, and
fled several times around the house
in silent agony, notwithstanding
which the drastic measure proved a
most effective cure. Upon a later
occasion he was driven some 15
miles across the bush by his eldest
son, with an eye reposing upon his
face, as the result of an accident;
and on another occasion he was
horned by a beast, narrowly escap-
ing with his life. In those days he
frequently would not take his boots
off for three weeks at a time, and
being continually saturated with
water at times, his socks had liter-
ally to be cut from his feet by his
wife. After this stormy period of
his career Mr. Loveday in 1870

The late MATTHEW GLEESON,
of Crow’s Nest, Queensland, was a
native of Ireland, having been born
at Cloughjordan, County Tip2)erary,
in the year 1836. He came to Aus-
tralia by the sailing ship “Oceanic,”
which landed her passengers at
Moretou Bay, after a trip of eight
months’ duration, on the day that
separation from New South Wales
was granted in the year 1859. Pro-
ceeding to Toowoomba, Mr. Gleeson
entered upon farming pursuits, and
eventually took up a selection of 20
acres of bush country in the vicinity
the Costello brothers retired, leaving
Mr. Gleeson to carry on single-
handed, which he continued to do
until three years later, when he dis-
posed of the selection and removed to
Crow’s Nest. Here he settled on a
block of 640 acres, situated within
three miles of the township, at a
place known as “Old Woman’s
Hut,’’ on the eastern slope of the
main range. Having erected a
“humpy” for the accommodation of
his wife and family, he began cut-
ting and carting timber for the mar-
ket; but the nearest railway station
built the present hostelry bearing
that name, on freehold property,
and closing the older building, trans-
ferred the licence to the new house,
which was afterwards sold in 1909.
In 1908 Mr. Gleeson built the
Grand Hotel, for which he took out
a licence and established himself
therein as mine host, but about four
months after the hotel was opened

of the Downs capital. Building him-
self a primitive dwelling, he spent
several years in the development of
this holding under conditions the
reverse of smooth and easy, and
eventually, in 1865, relinquished the
venture in order to join in partner-
ship with Messrs. Patrick and
Timothy Costello in a timber-getting
and mixed-farming proposition at
Geham, where the firm secured a
tract of land suitable for the pur-
pose. This, however, did not prove
the success anticipated, and in 1873

being at Toowoomba, 30 miles dis-
tant, he found himself unable to
work his new enterprise on a payable
basis. Discouraged with the results
of his attempts to wrest a livelihood
from the timber forests, in 1887 Mr.
Gleeson abandoned the life of a
settler and started out in a new line
of business, taking over the lease of
the old Crow’s Nest Hotel, which he
conducted very successfully for five
years. This period was followed by
seven years as licencee of the old
Royal Hotel, subsequent to which he

was a valuable member of the com-

advancement of the district and
serving No. 1 Division of the High-
fields Shire Council continuously
from about 1884 to 1900. He exerted
his influence and played a useful
part in securing railway facilities for
the district, the line being opened
in the year 1886. Although not suc-
cessful in his farming ventures, he

survived him. Of the daughters,

carted to Crow’s Nest, continuing
in this industry from 16 to 18 years.
Whilst little more than a lad, in
1884, he took up a holding of land,
which he used for grazing purposes,
and he has added to this block from
time to time, until to-day he holds
about 3,000 acres in the Crow’s Nest
district. He has taken an active
part in the public life of the
district, and in 1907 was elected a
member of the Highfields Shire
Council, in which he represented
No. 1 Division for a period of five
years. The Highfield Shire being of
very unwieldy size, the residents
prepared a petition for separation,
which was finally brought about in
January, 1913. Upon the formation
of the new body, which is known as

the effort referred to, throwing all
his energy into the work of obtain-

secured after a very hard fight on
the part of those whose interests
were chiefly concerned in the move-

to the full in various other ways for
the good of the community, and
among the offices which he has held
from time to time is that of honorary
secretary of the Crow’s Nest Agri-
cultural Society, which he has filled
Madden, of Rosewood, and has a
son and a daughter. WILLIAM
GLEESON, fourth son of the late
Matthew Gleeson, was born at
Geham, Cabarlah, in the year 1874.
He made good progress in his early
studies at the Crow’s Nest public
school, and first becoming a pupil
teacher at length decided to take up
this profession as a means of liveli-
hood. He was appointed to a school
near Gympie in 1893, where he re-
mained for a year, subsequently
returning to Crow’s Nest and
Crow’s Nest, where he now carries
on the leading business of this kind
in the district. Mr. William Gleeson
is a member of the local race club,
and on occasion races successfully, his
hcrse “ Muscatel ” having placed
several events to his credit. He was
married in 1897 to Annie, daughter
of Mr. Patrick Hayden, of Crow’s

there in 1906. Not being satisfied with
the prospects of advancement open to
him in his calling, he resigned from
the Education Department and
turned his attention to land invest-
ment, taking up a selection at

heavily timbered, which he sold, un-
improved, at a. good figure in 1910.

and other work of a similar nature
for a time, afterwards establishing
himself in the butchering business at
Cabarlah, Queensland, on April 29,
1876, and at the termination of his
school-days he worked with his
father until 1802, when he purchased
teams and began an independent
career, being chiefly engaged in cart-
ing timber for about a couple of
years. Abandoning this enterprise,
he directed his energies to grazing
pursuits, and with this purpose in
view took up a holding of 700 acres
about 10 miles distant from Crow’s
Nest. Having embarked on this ven-
ture with good prospects of success,


in 1909 lie formed a partner-
ship with his brother, Mr. Timothy

The Darling Downs.
Toowoomba and Vicinity.
Toowoomba is both the capital of the Darling
Downs and the gateway from that wide, fertile area to
the metropolis of the State and to the sea. The Darling
Downs district forms what probably is the largest
extent of uniformly first-class land in the continent.
Toowoomba stands on an elevated ridge which forms the
eastern boundary of this region. The latter is esti-
mated to contain 2,000,000 acres. The population of
the town and environs numbers 20,000 persons; whilst
in the summer months this is considerably augmented
by visitors from Brisbane and elsewhere, anxious to
escape the humidity of the coast or the severer
heat of the interior. As parts of Toowoomba are
more than 2,000 feet above sea-level the climatic
advantages are such as to be found in few other
parts of the State.
To pass through Toowoomba by rail is to acquire
a false idea of the character of the place. It happens
that none of the best of the town is to be seen from the
railway line. The train from Brisbane brings the new-
comer unexpectedly among houses and streets. After
having travelled for about fifty miles through belts of
fertile alluvial land, picturesquely timbered and sup-
porting prosperous-looking farms and obviously flourish-
ing townships, the train will have made its big climb,
winding round the sides of hills, passing through long
black tunnels, and gliding over bridges, all the while
ascending, until at last it sweeps out on to a nearly level
plain and enters the outskirts of Toowoomba.
The first white man to set eyes on the district
about Toowoomba was Allan Cunningham, on June 5,
1827. That explorer gave the Downs their name—
after Governor Darling, of New South Wales. What
is now the railway station site lies in the centre of a
dish-like hollow, where originally there was a swamp.
The attractions of permanent water and good feed made
the spot a favourite camping-place, and an hotel was
erected in the locality in 1854. Some interesting com-
ments on the genesis of Toowoomba have been left by
Dr. Lang, who was in that part of the country in
1854. He wrote that Drayton “was the only spot at
the time when trading people and mechanics first desired
to settle in the district that could be had on any terms
from their high-mightiness the squatters.” In com-
menting on how inferior a site Drayton occupied, the
same authority wrote, “This led to the formation of
another and rival town called Toowoomba, in the same
central part of the country.” The well-known author,
"Steele Rudd” (Mr. A. 11. Davis), who had lived many
years in that portion of Queensland, says that the first
settlers at Toowoomba were Messrs. Dent and Shuttle-
worth, and that they were grass-cutting at the swamp
there in 1849. Drayton, he says, was the first town to
be established west of the main range. A number of
theories exist as to the origin of the name of
Toowoomba, but probably the word is a corruption
from the aboriginal language.
The town is characterized by wide, well-formed
streets, substantial public and commercial buildings,
thoroughfares tastefully and plentifully planted with
trees, among which willows are conspicuous, and by
pleasant and attractive homes nestling among luxuriant
gardens. Toowoomba stands on rich red volcanic soil,
where almost every plant the climate suits will flourish.
The air is fresh and invigorating, and in summer the
high degree of humidity which generally prevails in
Brisbane is entirely absent.
One of the principal attractions of Toowoomba to
the sightseer lies in the wonderfully comprehensive
and enlightening view of the surrounding country
which is to be had from Picnic Point. To reach this
vantage-point the visitor climbs steadily. Eventually
he reaches a spot where the country appears to drop
sheer away in front of him. Picnic Point is on the edge
of a precipice; also it is on the edge of the saucer cf
the continent, inside of which all the rivers flow inland,
and outside of which they flow direct to the sea. On
the eastern side of the Point there is a fall, very nearly
perpendicular, of something like 1,500 feet. Away
down below is the toll-road which leads to Brisbane, a
tiny thread which ultimately loses itself in the heavy
timber with which the ranges are covered. An
enormous tract of hill and valley, forest, and occasional
open plain lies within the field of vision to the east.
A very few miles in that direction stands a mountain
set in the lowlands. Its altitude appears identical with
that of the edge of the tableland, whilst its table-like
summit resembles a piece of the Downs planted there.
The fact is that long ages ago the Darling Downs
extended very far to the east of what now is their
boundary. The solitary mountain is a relic of a
vanished part of the old plateau, the original
formation all round having been gradually cut away
by the action of water.
Picnic Point stands on the ridge of what goes bv
the name of the Great Dividing Range in Victoria, New

South Wales, and Queensland. The Dividing Range,
in places, is not a range at all, or anything like one;
but the term makes a handy name to indicate the line
dividing the two main watersheds. The line runs
parallel with the coast all the way from the western
TABLE TOP RANGE, NEAR TOOWOOMBA.
side of Victoria to Cape York Peninsula. At Picnic
Point are to be seen in a marked degree the features
which all along are more or less general to this Great
Divide. Conspicuous are the gradual slope to the
interior and the much more rapid fall to the sea. The
heavy timber of the coastal strip yields evidence of a
generous rainfall, while to the west the country con-
sists largely of plains.
The view to the west embraces a great
area of hills and plains succeeding one
another in the orderless lack of system pre-
vailing in volcanic formations. In that
direction the country is all of decomposed
basalt, highly fertile, health-giving in its
effects on stock depastured on it, and grow-
ing a great quantity of nutritious plants.
The soil is of great depth, in places reaching
to 40 feet, whilst almost anywhere water
may be obtained by sinking to a depth of not
more than 60 feet.
In spite of an annual rainfall of some-
where in the neighbourhood of 30 inches,
agriculture has been impeded about Too-
woomba by drought. It has been found
that the rich volcanic soil cracks so
readily that what moisture it may con-
tain evaporates very rapidly during dry
weather. Undoubtedly this would be corrected
were the local farmers to adopt American methods
of dry-farming, successfully followed in South
Australia and the dry regions of Victoria. The Too-
woomba district is admirably suited to intense cultivation
under scientific methods. The great productivity of the
land is made evident by the large production from small
holdings in the vicinity of the town. How well the
conditions are suited to the requirements of leguminous
crops is shown by the fact that the roots of lucerne
have been discovered to have penetrated for
40 feet below the surface. Probably no town
in Queensland holds a more promising
immediate future of prosperity and growth
than does Toowoomba.
One of the most interesting develop-
ments in connection with the city and its
environs was the growth of the Greater
Toowoomba scheme. Mooted almost simult-
aneously with the Greater Ipswich movement,
it did not meet with the unanimous support
of the aldermen and councillors of the muni-
cipalities chiefly concerned, and it was not
until 1912 that the scheme really got a
definite start. Alderman Alford, the retiring
Mayor, at that time wrote a minute for
the incoming Council in which he said:
“Now that there seems to be a general
disposition to alter the boundaries of the shires around
Toowoomba, notably those of Jondaryan, Gowrie, and
Highfields, may I be allowed to offer the following sug-
gestion, viz., that the time may now be opportune for
establishing a Greater Toowoomba, a hope I have enter-
tained for some considerable time.” Alderman Alford
outlined his scheme for extension and concluded :
“This, I think, would take in all, or nearly all, that

could be reasonably expected to be part of the city for
the next twenty or thirty years, and do away with the
great bugbear of joint streets. . . . By making a
Greater Toowoomba it would enable the new Council to
deal with some large and very important problems.” As*


a result of the new Council’s work, Mr. Gall, Under
Secretary to the Home Secretary, visited Toowoomba in
October, 1912, and put forward an alternative scheme.
This was approved, and led to the constitution of New-
town and other changes. In 1917, however, when Mr.
Alexander Mayes was mayor, Newtown and other parts of

Institute in his native town. Young
Mayes received his education locally,
and shortly after entering his teens
was apprenticed to the trade of a
carpenter, at the expiration of his
indentures proceeding to Edinburgh,
where he found employment as an
improver at his trade. Three years
later found him a finished trades-
man and bending his steps towards
London, for 12 months he specialized
in his particular class of work in the
“Hub of the Universe.” He next
proceeded to Glasgow, where for
some time he filled positions as
foreman with leading firms in the
building trade in that city. About
this time his attention was attracted
by glowing reports of the oppor-
tunities Australia presented as a
field of enterprise, and he decided to
tempt fortune in the southern
continent. Taking passage by the
“Duke of Sutherland,” he reached
Brisbane on May 8, 1886, two weeks
later arriving at Toowoomba, where
he has since resided. Here he
irmnediately established himself as

and schools on behalf of the Roman
Catholic community, and other
premises of more or less importance,
besides which he secured the con-
tracts for extensive additions to the
Toowoomba Grammar School and
the Hospital for Insane at Willow-
burn. For the past 20 years Mr.
Mayes has taken an active part in
the municipal life of Toowoomba,
and on four occasions (1896, 1903,
1912, and 1916-17) he occupied the
mayoral chair with dignity and hon-
our to the town. He first entered the
Council as representative for East
Ward in 1894, only relinquishing
the seat when the pressure of
his private interests caused him to
temporarily transfer his residence
to Warwick, where his financial
interests for a time were centered.
In the past he has done much
to advance the prosperity of
Toowoomba, and has freely given his
advice and labours in an honorary
capacity, his special knowledge of
the building trade proving of invalu-
able assistance in the deliberations of
the civic body. When the Greater
Toowoomba scheme became an accom-
plished fact, to Mr. Mayes fell the
honour of election to the mayoral
chair, an office he filled with char-
acteristic ability for twelve months.
As chairman of works in the Council
of 1917-18 he was responsible for
the installation of a tar-distilling
plant, the by-products of which are
utilized by the Department of
Defence, while the tar is afterwards
used on the roads and footways
of the municipality. He has been a
member of the Masonic craft for
over 25 years, and has three times
filled the various offices of the local
lodge, the Southern Cross, E.C.
The School of Arts and Technical
College has claimed him as its
president for over 14 years, and he
has been a member of the East
Toowoomba School Committee for
over sixteen years, at the present
time (1915) filling the office of Pre-
sident. Mr. Mayes served for
forty-two years as honorary super-
intendent of the Toowoomba
Fire Brigade, and under his hand
the brigade became known as one
of the finest fire-fighting forces in


Australasia. As a Justice of the
Peace of long-standing he has never
shirked his responsibilities, and is
frequently to be seen occupying a
seat on the bench of the local court.
He is a ready advocate of all forms
of healthy outdoor sports, and the
special efforts on his part to secure
suitable bathing facilities for the
residents led to the erection of the
present swimming baths in the town,
tie is one of the founders and the
present president of the Toowoomba
Bowling Club, and finds recreation
in the pursuit of this ancient game
on the local green. Mr. Mayes is a
frequent contributor to the Press on
matters of public interest, and a
deep student of literature, his choice
ranging over a wide field of modern
works. He was married in 1897 to
Helena Agnes, third daughter of tin
late William Grieve, grazier, of
New South Wales and Queensland,
and has a family of four sons.
Alderman THOMAS STEPHEN
BURSTOW, J.P., is a son of the
late Stephen Burstow, of Sussex,
England, and was born in London
on February 16, 1858. Mr. Stephen
Burstow was a builder and con-
tractor by trade, and was well
known throughout the county. The
Burstows have lived in the district
of Shoreham and Horsham, in
Sussex, for over a century, the
village of Burstow deriving its name
from the family. The subject of our
memoir received his elementary
education at the Methodist Church
at Shoreham, subsequently
attending the local national school,
established under the educational
system, at that time just coming
into vogue in England. At 16 years
of age he was apprenticed to the
trade of a carpenter and builder,
under the guidance of his father,
and for the next five years devoted
his time to mastering the various
branches of the work. On attaining
his majority he left the parental
roof, and spent four years in the
employ of Mr. James Barnes, who
had extensive works at Brighton,
ultimately rising to the position of
foreman. Deciding to seek his for-
tune in distant fields, he set sail for
the land of the Southern Cross,
and in 1881 landed in Queens-
land, immediately proceeding to
Toowoomba, where he has resided
ever since. He obtained employment
in Mr. George Griffith’s foundry, and
for a time specialized in the con-
struction of carriage bodies for
railway purposes, subsequently fill-
ing various positions, chiefly as
builder’s foreman for the late James
Renwick, contractor, etc. Having
gained a fair grip of local conditions,

MR. THOMAS STEPHEN BURSTOW.
Mr. Burstow decided to launch out
for himself, and in the early eighties
we find him firmly established as a
builder and contractor on the Dar-
ling Downs. He devoted his time
principally to the erection of private
dwellings, and a large number of
the handsome residential homes on
the Downs were constructed by him.
Some 25 years ago he purchased the

oldest furniture business on the
Downs, which formerly had been
carried on by Mr. R. A. Bakers,
and relinquishing the building trade
he devoted all his time to the
requirements of his new’ venture.
Under his dix-ection the business has
continued to expand, and to-day Mr.
Burstow finds employment for
upwards of 40 hands in his shop
and factory, the latter being fitted
up with a complete plant of the
most up-to-date machinery, specially
designed to handle indigenous
timbers, a variety of which is used
in the construction of the different
items of furniture. The general
direction of the business is in the
hands of Mr. Burstow, his eldest son
having the practical management of
the factory. Matters of public
interest and the affairs of the
municipality have always claimed a
large share of Mr. Burstow’s time,
and in 1902 he was returned to
represent East Ward in the City
Council, holding the seat ever since.
On two occasions (1904-1907) he has
filled the mayoral chair, and it was
during his occupancy of this office
that the different loans of the
municipality were consolidated, and
the financial affairs of the town
placed on a sound basis. Mr. Burs-
tow deserves great credit for the
part he performed in this achieve-
ment, the result of which has been
to place the credit of Toowoomba on
a very high level. He was the prime
mover in securing the present water
supply for Toowoomba, the successful
promotion of which scheme was
made possible by the satisfactory
adjustment of finances previously
referred to. For over a decade he
acted as chairman of the Water
Supply Board, and it is safe to aver
that there are very few public posi-
tions of any importance that at one
RESIDENCE OF MR. T. S. BURSTOW, TOOWOOMBA


time or another he has not occupied.
He is a Justice of the Peace, having
been gazetted to that office in the
nineties, and has been a member of
the executive of the ambulance
brigade since its inception, in connec-
tion with which he has represented
the municipality on the Brisbane
Fire Brigade Board for a number of
years. He has twice been president
of the Austral Association, and for
several years past has taken an
active part in the deliberations of
the Toowoomba Chamber of Com-
merce. He has been president of the
Local Authorities Association of
Queensland on three different occa-
sions. His record as a Mason
extends over a quarter of a century,
during which time he has filled
many honorary offices. As grand
master of Scottish Freemasonry he
holds the highest honour obtainable
in this craft in Queensland, and he
has the additional distinction of
having been twice re-elected to the
position, which he has now filled
for eight consecutive years. For
recreation Mr. Burstow turns to
the bowling green, but his hearty
support is freely accorded to all
forms of manly outdoor sport. He
was married in England, in 1879, to
Mary Ann, daughter of the late
William Hill, of Shoreham, Sussex,
and has a surviving family of three
sons and five daughters.
Alderman CHARLES ROW-
BOTHAM, J.P., was born at
Horncastle, Lincolnshire, England,
on December 11, 1858, and is
a son of the late John Row-
botham, who was connected with
the British Civil Service in Lincoln-
shire for many years. He received
his education in his home county,
and early in life, owing to the death
of his parent, was compelled to share
the responsibility of maintaining the
home. He was apprenticed to the
boot trade, subsequently entering
the employ of Mr. Edwin Bostock,
founder of the firm of Bostock Bros.,
of international repute, and while in
this position acquired a thorough
knowledge of all the branches of the
trade. In 1884 he decided to try
his luck in other climes, and having
a brother, Mr. J. W. Rowbotham,
at Toowoomba (then managing a
factory for Mr. S. 11. Whichello),
he took passage to Queensland.
Settling at Toowoomba he found
employment in Mr. Whichello’s
factory, after a lapse of time
entering into partnership with his
brother in the establishment of a
business, which later on he assumed
sole control of on his own behalf. The
year 1897 witnessed his entry into
the municipal life of the town as
alderman for South Ward,
ward he represented for six years.
In 1901 he received the distinction
of election to the mayoral chair,
being re-elected for a further term
at the expiration of his first year of
office. As chief magistrate of the
town he was associated with many
important movements for the
advancement of the ratepayers’
interests, principal among which
may be mentioned the proclamation
of Picnic Point as a municipal
reserve, the reclamation of swamp
lands, and the formation of the

local ambulance brigade. He also
rendered invaluable assistance in the
formation of school committees, the
fire brigade board, and other bodies
of a similar nature, and his staunch
efforts to further the interests of the
community on all occasions have
gained the hearty appreciation of
the ratepayers of the town. Follow-
ing the culmination of the Greater
Toowoomba movement, he was re-
turned as an alderman of the first
Council and still retains his seat. Mr.
Rowbotham was one of the founders
of the Toowoomba Co-operative
Insurance Company, and acted as
chairman of directors from its incep-
tion until 1913, when he resigned
the post on the eve of a trip to
England. He has twice visited the
Old World within recent years. He
has been for many years a member
of the Toowoomba Chamber of
Commerce, of which body he was
president in 1911, and again in
1917-18. At the Congress of
Chambers of Commerce of the
Empire, held in Sydney in 1909,
he acted as representative of
his chamber, serving in a similar
capacity at the Congress held in
London some three years later. Mr.
Rowbotham, who was gazetted a
Justice of the Peace in pre-Federa-
tion days, has retired from active
business pursuits, and resides with
his family at Toowoomba, where he
has considerable vested interests.
Local politics claim a fair share of
his time, and he is a supporter of
the Liberal Party. He is a member
of the Masonic fraternity, his lodge
being the Darling Downs, 775, S.C.
He was married in 1884 to Barbara,
daughter of the late William Webb,
of Lincolnshire, England, and has a
family of three daughters.
H. K. ALFORD, one of Too-
woomba’s most prominent citizens,
and an ex-mayor of the town, was
born in 1852. The parents of Mr.
Alford arrived at the Darling Downs
in 1842, his mother being one of
the first white women to make their
advent thither, and her two little
daughters—one an infant in arms—
were the first European children on
the Downs. In 1843 Mrs. Alford’s
father built the first house at Dray-
ton, then known as “The Springs’’
(native name “Chingerrie”), and
later on, about 1851, moved to what
was then known as “The Swamp.”
Mrs. Alford gave the name of “Too-
woomba” to the settlement, confirm-
ation of which is recorded in the
certificate of baptism of Mr. H. K.
Alford in 1852. Record occurs in
the diary of the late Benjamin
Glennie that “the first Church of
England service in Toowoomba was
held by him in Mrs. Alford’s house
on August 29, 1852”; so that the
honour of giving the city its name
indubitably belongs to the late Mr.
and Mrs. Thomas Alford. Mr. H.
K. Alford, after leaving school,
joined the staff of the Australian
Joint Stock Bank, being appointed
manager at Toowoomba, after an
interval of thirty years. Shortly
after his return to Toowoomba in
1901 Mr. Alford founded the Dar-
ling Downs Butter Factory, which
subsequently was leased to Messrs.
Howes Bros, under the title of the


"Lowood Creamery Co.” The Dar-
ling Downs Co-operative Dairy Co.
followed, and thus the daiiying in-
dustry demonstrated the fact that it
had come to stay to the lasting
benefit of the district. Mr. Alford
was the prime mover in bringing
about the formation of a “Greater
Toowoomba,” a scheme which was
finally brought to fruition in 1916.
M hile resident at Roma he occupied
the office of alderman for seven
years, and was a member of the
Murilla Shire Council for about five
years. After settling in Toowomba
be was elected alderman, and in
1911-12 was honoured by election to
the office of Chief Magistrate of the
city.
HENRY GENT WEBB, J.P.,who
was Mayor of Toowoomba in 1908 and
1910, was born at Dungog, New
South Wales, on May 27, 1859, and
is a son of the late T. C. Webb, an
early pioneer of the Darling Downs.
He received his education at Too-
woomba, and at twelve years of age
was apprenticed to the bakery trade,
at the expiration of his indentures
joining his brother in the establish-
ment of a bakery business in the
town, which they carried on for some
years. Subsequently Mr. Webb
opened a general store on his own
account, and at a later date took
over the conduct of a bakery. He
was also engaged in pastoral pur-
suits for a considerable period. In
1909 he retired from active business
life, and has since devoted himself
to the public interests of the place.
For over twenty years continuously
he has served the ratepayers of Too-
woomba, and in 1915 was for the
second time elected to the mayoral
chair, the previous occasion being in
1908. During his first terra as mayor
the land for the beautiful park which
bears his name was purchased by the
Council, who bestowed upon it the
appellation of “Webb Park.” Mr.
Webb is a Justice of the Peace of
long standing, and has rendered
yeoman service in forwarding the
development of one of the most
important districts in Queensland.
FRANK HUGH MERRITT,
Town Clerk of Toowoomba, is a son
of the late Alfred Merritt, who came
to Australia from Hampshire, Eng-
land, in 1861. He landed at Sydney
but continued his journey to Too-
woomba, subsequently taking up
land in the Crow’s Nest district,
afterwards known as Merritt's
Creek, which he farmed until 1860,
in which year he received the ap-
pointment of clerk to the Highfields
Shire Council. Here he remained
until 1891, when he was chosen to
fill the jiost of Town Clerk of Too-
woomba, which he held up to the
time of his decease in February,
1902. Mr. F. 11. Merritt was born
at Merritt’s Creek on July 6, 1880.
He was educated locally and at
Brisbane, finishing his scholastic
career at the Toowoomba Grammar
School. After eighteen months
spent in a commercial house, in 1899
he became a junior clerk in the offices
of the Toowoomba Town Council,
passing through the various grades
until February, 1910, when he was
selected to carry out the duties of
MR. FRANK HUGH MERRITT.
town clerk. Mr. Merritt gives his
hearty support to all patriotic move-
ments, and is secretary to the Too-
woomba branch of the Queensland
Patriotic Fund. He is a Past-master
of the Darling Downs Masonic Club,

Bowling Club.
The late EDWARD WILMOTT
PECHEY was born at Colchester,
England, in 1841, and came to
Queensland in the year 1857, almost
immediately after arrival finding his
way to the Darling Downs. He was
a surveyor by profession, but shortly
after his advent to State
became engaged in the sawmilling
industry with Messrs. P. Deagon
and H. Halge. lie established
the Highfields Steam Sawmill, now
known as the Pechey Timber and
Sawmills, which was the pioneer
enterprise of its kind in Queensland,
the mill building being the oldest
standing in the State to-day; and
as a result of this successful enter-
prise was justly regarded as the
founder and father of the thriving
little settlement, which, built on the
firm basis of a sound industry,
though in a remote portion of the
Queensland bush, has become well
known in the larger centres of com-
merce by the name of the man who
fostered its birth. The Pechey
Timber and Sawmills are situated
in the Crow’s Nest district, about
four miles distant from the latter
town, and about 25 miles from
Toowoomba. Established as far
back as 1860, they have held their
own through all successive changes
and innovations in the industry, and
to-day stand as a monument to the
jiractical, enterprising, and pro-
gressive spirit of their founder.
Mr. Pechey had very pronounced
opinions of his own, and possessed
the courage of his convictions
always, and having won a reputa-
tion for wide culture and familiar-
ity with many subjects of general
interest, in the early seventies he
was honoured by his fellow-electors
by election to the House of
Assembly, the Redistribution Bill of
1873 providing for the creation of
the Aubigny electorate, which here-
tofore had been a portion of the
Drayton and Toowoomba constitu-
ency, and represented by the late
Hon. W. H. Groom. Mr. Pechey
was returned as first member for
Aubigny, and retained his seat for
seven years, during which period he
worked heartily with the Toowoomba
representative for the advancement
of the whole district. In 1874-5
the two members succeeded in
obtaining a number of road grants
for road communication in this por-
tion of the State, totalling £2,900;
and in many ways Mr. Pechey made
his influence felt in the House, his
speeches, expressing sound, liberal
views, gaining a respectful hearing,
while for his vigorous intellectual
ability he was held in high esteem
by his confreres, and it was an open
secret that he had been offered
a portfolio, which, however, he
declined. After retiring from Par-
liament he lived quietly, taking no
active part in public affairs,
although his interest in the progress
of the district remained undimin-
ished. His last appearance in


public was on the occasion of a
meeting at Toowoomba, about 1900,
to advocate the construction of the
railway from Pittsworth to St.
George, which he strongly supported,

but which, however, has not yet
become an accomplished fact.
Always a close student, Mr. Pechey,
after his retirement from public
life, devoted his leisure to extensive
reading, and his large library was
always a source of enjoyment to
him. He was a member of the
Theosophical Society, and took a
special interest in the study of
Eastern philosophy, being acknow-
ledged as one of the best authorities
on this subject in Australia. He
also gave considerable attention to
other works on occult science.
Mr. Pechey married Ellen Maria,
daughter of Mr. William Bond, of
Torrington, Toowoomba, in 1872,
the issue of this union being two
sons and two daughters. He died
at Toowoomba, after a lengthy
illness, on April 28, 1904. The
late WILLIAM WILMOTT
PECHEY, elder son of the late
E. W. Pechey, was born at Too-
woomba on September 15, 1873, and
received his education at the local
grammar school. At the close of
his schooldays he became associated
with his father in the timber and
sawmilling business, and in 1894
proceeded to Western Australia,
wdiere he was connected with the
sawmilling industry for a number
of years, succeeding the Hon. Frank
Wilson, C.M.G., as general mana-
ger of the Canning Jarrah Timber
MM
Company. Upon the death of his
father in 1904 he returned to
Queensland to carry on the business
there, and by his energy and busi-
ness ability much enlarged its opera-
tions, erecting new mills at Mount
Binga, near Cooyar, and continuing
his connection with this important
enterprise until the time of his
death, which occurred at his resi-
dence, “Cottesloe,” Toowoomba, on
November 26, 1915. Mr. Pechey
represented the finest type of Aus-
tralian-born citizen, and displayed
true patriotic spirit in the keen
interest which he always took in the
public affairs of the district and the
advancement of the State. He held
the Commission of the Peace, and
at one time occupied the office of
vice - president of the Austral

Association, also holding a life mem-
bership of the Australian Natives’
Association, in which he took a
lively interest. He was a strong
supporter of the Liberal cause, and
exercised considerable influence in
political contests, making it his
business to secure the strongest
support possible for his party in the
district. In 1912 and 1913 he was
president of the Toowoomba Cham-
ber of Commerce; at the time of his
death was treasurer to the trustees
of the Toowoomba Grammar School ;
and for a lengthy period was a
member of the Masonic craft, having
joined at Cottesloe, Western Aus-
tralia. The late Mr. W. W. Pechey
married Edna May, daughter of
Mr. George Washington Griffiths, of
the well-known firm of ironfounders,
of Toowoomba, and is survived by
his widow, two daughters, and one
son. ALFRED EDWARD
PECHEY, the present director of
the sawmilling and timber business
at Toowoomba, Pechey, and Mount
Binga, was born on June 19, 1877,
at Toowoomba, and pursued his
studies at the normal school, Bris-
bane. In 1894 he proceeded to
Western Australia, and filled a
clerical position in the Perth office
of the Canning Timber Company for
two years. He next filled the posi-
tion of foreman of the Wellington
Mill, owned by Millars’ Karri and
Jarrah Company, but on the out-
break of the South African War he
enlisted as a private, and proceeded
to the front with the Western Aus-
tralian 4th contingent, subsequently
taking part in actions at Witte-
bergen, Cape Colony, and the
Transvaal, receiving the Queen’s
medal with three clasps. He
returned to Western Australia in
1901, and after remaining a few
years with the last-mentioned com-
pany, returned to Queensland in
1904, when he became joint mana-
ger with his elder brother of
the Pechey Timber Mills, being
stationed at Pechey, where he
undertook the bush part of the
work. Upon the death of his
brother, Mr. W. W. Pechey, in
November, 1915, he assumed full

George King came to Sydney in the

In 1866 he extended his operations
to Queensland, purchasing a half
share in a property at Gowrie, his
partners being the late Ernest de St.

Finding very soon that it would be
necessary to change the tenure of the
property from leasehold to freehold,
he bought out his partners, and
founded the firm of King & Sons,
taking into partnership his two sons,
George Beresford King and Henry
Venn King. Ten years later he
decided to settle on the Darling
Downs, and disposing of hie interests
in New South Wales he took up his
residence at Gowrie, near Kings-

under his command and it is worthy
of mention that during the first 12
years he was connected with the
mounted infantry he established a
unique record by travelling over
15,000 miles in riding to and from
his house at Gowrie to the drill
grounds at Toowoomba, thus setting
an example to his men worthy in
every way of the closest emulation.
When the Federal Government took
over the Military Forces of the
States, Lieut.-Colonel King, who
was in command of the Queens-
land Regiment of Mounted Infantry,
was given the command of the 14th
Regiment Australian Light Horse.
General Sir E. T. Hutton on his
first tour of inspection was so
delighted with the regiment that he
recommended Lieut.-Colonel King
for promotion to a colonelcy, to
which rank he was duly gazetted.
Colonel King retired from active
service in 1904, at which time he was
Brigade Commander of the sth
(now Ist) Light Horse Brigade.

MR. F. VENN KING.
Following the outbreak of the great
European war (1914), he volunteered
his services to the military authori-
ties in any capacity in which he
might be of use, and was com-
missioned by them to purchase
mounts for the Australian Expedi-
tionary Forces, Ids extensive know-
ledge of horses causing him to be
regarded as one of the best judges
of this animal in Australasia.
In October, 1915, he was appointed
to the command of the Remount
Unit for Egypt, whence he re-
turned in July, 1916. Prior to his
departure he was entertained by the
residents of Gowrie and surrounding
districts, and was presented with a
suit case as a small token of
the esteem in which he is held.
Colonel King has taken an active part
in the administration of the affairs of
the district, and for over a quarter
of a century has been a member of
the Rosalie Shire Council, frequently
acting as chairman of that body,
lie has readily accorded his support
at all times to movements having
for their object the advancement of
the district, and has proved himself
a zealous guardian of the rights of
the community. Colonel King was


gazetted to the Commission of the
Peace by the Palmer Ministry in
1873, and is chairman of the
Marsupial Board, on which body he
is Government representative. He
was married at Arnprior, New
South Wales, in 1872, to Ann
Stewart, daughter of the late
William Ryrie, of “Yerreng,” Vic-
toria, and of a family of nine
children, all of whom were born at
Gowrie, five sons and two daughters
survive. The sons, viz., Henry
Venn King, Francis William Venn
King, Guy Venn King, Richard
Venn King, and Frederick Venn
King, are also engaged in pastoral
pursuits in different parts of the
State. Mr. F. Venn King joined
the A.I.F. in May, 1915. He left
for Egypt with the 9th Reinforce-
ments, 9th Regiment, and was sub-
sequently transferred to the 49th
Battalion. He was on active service
in France, where he was wounded
and lightly “gassed.” At the time
of writing (1918) he is studying in
the Officers’ School for the rank of
lieutenant. Mr. G. Venn King
joined the Australian Field Artillery
in August, 1916. After training in
New South Wales he left Australia
in May, 1917. A further period of
instruction in England followed his
arrival there, after which he crossed
to France, where he was “gassed”
shortly after entering the firing
line. He was in hospital in France,
and is now (1918) employed behind
the lines.
Councillor W. -I. PEAK, J.P.,
was born at Penzance, Cornwall,
England, on December 3, 1831.
He was employed on a farm until
attaining his majority, when he
undertook a contract to excavate
sewerage works for the Penzance
Corporation, subsequently spending
two years as a driver of a grocer’s
delivery van. In his twenty-sixth
year Mr. Peak married, and on
March 2, 1858, he took passage for
Moreton Bay in the sailing vessel
“Ascendant,” arriving at Brisbane
on June 24 of the same year. Pro-
ceeding to Drayton he found employ-
ment with Mr. William Handcock,
storekeeper of that town, and
continued in his service for about
12 months. He then joined the New
South Wales Police Force, in which
he remained for 10 months, at
the expiration of which time the
Queensland Police Force took charge
of the district. While in the force
Mr. Peak formed one of Governor
Bowen’s escort when he held his
first levee at the Court House at
Drayton, and he acted in a similar
capacity to Judge Lutwyche on the
occasion when he unsuccessfully
endeavoured to open a Supreme
Court at Drayton. Retiring from
the Police he joined Mr. A. McPher-
son and worked for a time in the
bush on the range near Gabbinbar.
He next drove a team, later starting
as a contractor, doing well-sinking,
fencing, etc. For two years he was

overseer of a road party, until the
system was superseded by divisional
boards, when he became a contractor
to the Jondaryan Divisional Board,
at which work he continued until
he decided to launch out in farming
on his own account. In 1859 he
purchased seven acres of land,
the price being £2 10s. per acre.
Ploughing the land with the aid of
a bullock team, he sowed it with
wheat, and in due time was rewarded
with a crop of 30 bushels to the acre.
The crop was gathered in with a
reaping-hook, and threshed with a
flail on a tarpaulin, the wheat even-
tually being sold at 10s. per bushel.
At this time it was said in Parlia-
ment that it was not possible to
grow a straw or a cabbage on what
is now known as the famous Darling
Downs. Mr. Peak next took up 80
acres of land at Pittsworth, later
adding another 40 acres, fencing the
land with the aid of his 11-year-old
son. It was his intention to farm
the land, but his sons deciding to
follow other occupations he sold it
and invested the money in other
ways. Councillor Peak’s association
with municipal life dates back to
1862, in which year he was elected
a member of the Drayton Council.
Some time after a common was
granted to Drayton, whose members
had to be elected annually, and Mr.
Peak was returned as one of the first
members, and continued to hold
office until it was changed to the
Drayton Shire Council, when with
eight others he was again returned,
and at the time of writing
(1914) still retains the seat. He
was elected to be chairman of
the first shire council, a dis-
tinction of which he has every
reason to be proud. For many years
he served as a member of the Dray-
ton School Committee, and was one
of the founders of the old agricul-
tural society, of which he was a life
member at the time of its amalga-
mation with the Royal. In April,
1914, Mr. Peak’s 50 years of public
service were suitably recognized by
his fellow-citizens. At an influential
gathering he was made the recipient
of an illuminated address, a hand-
some gold watch, suitably inscribed,
and a photograph of the members of
the Drayton Shire Council then
holding office. Mr. Peak is one of
the very last links with Queensland’s
earliest form of local government,
and among the last of the early
generation of those men who laid
the foundation of local government
in the State. He was gazetted a
Justice of the Peace in 1895 by the
Griffiths Administration. Mr. Peak
paid a visit to his native land in
1897, at the time of Queen Victoria’s
jubilee, and remained in England
for six months. When in London he
visited the Colonial Institute, and
was delighted to find four exhibits
of maize and two of barley with a
ticket on them explaining that they
had been grown by Mr. W. J.
Peak, of Drayton, Queensland. For


recreation Mr. Peak principally
turned to cricket, and he is a keen
supporter of the game. Mrs. Peak
died in 1908, leaving a family of
three sons and three daughters.
WILLIAM CHARLES PEAK,
J.P., president of the Toowoomba
Chamber of Commerce (1914-5), is
the eldest son of Councillor W. J.
Peak, J.P., and was born at Drayton,
Queensland, on March 18, 1867. Edu-
cated at the Drayton State School
under the direction of Mr. P. J.
McDermott (now Under-Secretary
to tbe Premier, the Hon. T. J.
Ryan, but formerly of the Depart-
ment of Education), at the age
of 14 years Mr. Peak became
apprenticed to Wilcox Bros., general
merchants, of Toowoomba. The
steady increase in the population of
the Darling Downs during the next
decade brought about a large expan-
sion in the business of Wilcox Bros.,
which was ultimately sold to Laidlaw
Bros. Mr. Peak continued in the
service of the new owners for a
further four years, when he pur-
chased an interest in the concern,
which holds pride of place as the
oldest establishment of its kind in
Toowoomba. Fifteen years later he
purchased the business right out and
continued to conduct it entirely on
his own account until the year 1917,
when he sold his interests in the

concern to the Down Co-operative
Dairy Co., Limited, which company
entered into possession on January 1,
1918. Mr. Peak has always recog-
nized that the interests of the town
and surrounding districts are closely-
interwoven, and he has devoted
much of his time to the establish-
ment and furtherance of various
industries, the success of which has

made the Darling Downs deservedly
famous. Some 25 years ago he wit-
nessed the production of a small
quantity of cheese by Mr. Donald
Mclntyre (now largely engaged in
the industry), and recognizing the
possibilities of producing cheese on a
large scale he set to work, and was
instrumental in bringing about the
establishment of the first cheese
factory in the State. The Green-
mount Dairy Factory Co., Limited,
as it is called, is a highly
prosperous concern, with branches
in different localities, and has an
output of over 40 tons of cheese per
month. Prior to the establish-
ment of this factory all the cheese
used in the State was imported from
New Zealand, while to-day Queens-
land is exporting more cheese than
all the States of the Commonwealth
combined. The growth of the
industry naturally gave a strong
impetus to dairy farming, and as a
natural sequence the bacon industry
received a great fillip. Within five
years of the formation of the Green-
mount factory Mr. Peak considered
the time opportune to start a bacon-
curing works, and little time was
lost in forming a company for the
purpose. It may have been that the
project was a little premature, as
the promoters were unfortunate
enough to lose their money, yet they
had the satisfaction of knowing that
the industry was established on the
Darling Downs for all time. Sub-
sequently, when the production of
barley had largely increased, Mr.
Peak was the prime mover in the
founding of the Anderson Malting
Company, and since its inception he
has filled the important office of
chairman of directors. He also fills
a similar post on the board of the
Kingsthorpe Coal Mining Co., which
supplies fuel to the various manu-
factories on the Downs, as well as
to the Government railways. In
1897 he aided in the formation of
the Darling Downs Building Society,
the original capital of which was
£27, now increased to over at quarter
of a million sterling. The society
has been responsible for the erection
of some 2,000 houses, and for the
past 10 years has returned a dividend
of 7 per cent, to the shareholders,
while the reserve fund has been
increased to £lO,OOO. Mr. Peak
has been chairman of directors of
the society since its inception,
and he acts in a like capacity
to the Security Trust Company.
He was one of the founders of the
Toowoomba Steam Laundry, and is
a shareholder in the local gas com-
pany. Among other offices that he
has held are those of chairman of
committees of the Royal Agricultural
Society, patron and trustee of the
local Cricket Union, and vice-presi-
dent of the Traders’ Association,
besides which he is a member of the
ambulance brigade, in which he
takes an active interest. He was
gazetted a Justice of the Peace by
the Griffiths Ministry, and for over
25 years has been a member of the


Masonic craft, his lodge being the
Southern Cross, E.C. He takes a
keen interest in all forms of outdoor
sport, and is an enthusiastic follower
of polo and the “sport of Kings.”
In the year 1897 Mr. Peak married
Jessie, daughter of the late James G.
Buchanan, who for 40 years was well
known in pastoral circles as manager
for the late Hon. James Tyson, and
has a surviving family of four
daughters.
The late WILLIAM HOGARTH,
one of Queensland’s worthiest
pioneers of the early sixties, and a
founder of the well-known “Bal-
gownie” Estate, still in possession of
his family, was a son of the late
William Hogarth, a prominent
merchant of Aberdeen, Scotland,
and of Jane Gordon Pirie, a descen-
dant of the influential Scottish
family of that name. He came to
Australia at the age of 29, and
gained his early experience of the
pastoral industry in Queensland on
“Glengallan” Station, then the
property of Mr. Deuchar. Mr.
Hogarth, however, even at that
time, was no novice in stock and
station matters, as being of an
adventurous disposition he had
already roamed somewhat far afield

MR. WILLIAM HOGARTH.
late Mr. Beattie, he took up a
portion of the old “Felton” Station,
comprising some 8,000 acres, and
immediately set to work upon its
development. Great success attended
the efforts of the partners, who gave
their estate the name of “Bal-
gownie,” and in course of time the
reputation of “Balgownie” stock
became thoroughly established, not
only on the Darling Downs, where
the property is situated, but
over the whole southern portion of
the State. At that time the clothing
wool merino was the prevailing type
of sheep raised throughout Queens-
land, and for many years this breed
was maintained pure and unadulter-
ated at “Balgownie,” when all other
sheep breeders had relinquished it
in favour of the combing wools.
Considerable renown also was
achieved by the small stud herd of
black-polled Angus cattle, of which
the nucleus was imported frbm the
most noted herds in the north of
Scotland by Mr. Hogarth, who was
held to be one of the best judges of
this breed in Australia. There are
still some descendants of the old
herd on the “Balgownie” pastures.
At about the same date as their
acquirement of this estate, Messrs.
Hogarth and Beattie took up the
land at “Beauaraba,” a property of
almost equal acreage, which they
conducted in conjunction with their
initial enterprise, good results also
following their efforts in this
quarter. In 1876 the partnership
was dissolved by mutual consent,
Mr. Hogarth purchasing all interests
in the property, while Mr. Beattie
returned to Scotland. Eight years
later Mr. Hogarth’s death occurred
as a result of accidental drowning
whilst attempting to cross
a stream swollen by flood
waters (Hodgson Creek,
the principal watercourse
on the estate) on his re-
turn from New England.
Subsequent to this un-
timely event Mrs. Hogarth
assumed the administra-
tion of affairs, and hav-
ing disposed of the “Beau-
araba” property, which
has since been cut up for
dairy settlement purposes
by the Queensland Gov-
ernment, devoted her
attention closely to the
carrying on of the home
station until her sons
grew to man’s estate, and
were able to relieve her
of the responsibility. Mrs.
Hogarth, who now lives
in retirement at “Kerrie-
law,” Taylor Street, Too-
woomba, is a daughter
of the late Robert Cun-
ningham Robertson, of “Welling-
tou Vale,” New England, and
of “Halecraig,” Lanarkshire, a

By her marriage with Mr.

time the “Balgownie”
property was divided be-

inherited instinct for a

was born at Milltown, County Clare,
Ireland, on March 10, in the year
1843. His father was the late
Anthony O’Brien, who followed agri-
cultural pursuits in that district for
very many years. When he had
attained the age of twenty-eight
years he decided that there were
better prospects of carving out a
successful career in the land of the
Southern Cross, and accordingly
departed from the "Emerald Isle”
in the sailing ship "Renfrewshire,”
bound for Australia. Following his
arrival in Queensland he made his
way to Toowoomba, where he started
in business in 1884. In the same
year he married Ellen Fitzgerald, a
native of Bantry, County Cork,
Ireland, and both husband and wife
being gifted with great business
capacity, the little grocery store in
Russell Street soon became too small
for the expanding trade it com-
manded. A property was accord-
ingly purchased from the late Mr.
Slumm, and a large shop and
produce store erected thereon, where
operations were continued by the
enterprising couple with such dili-
gence and efficiency as to ensure
success and prosperity. Having

these may be mentioned the Grand
Hotel, a three-storeyed structure,
situated opposite the railway station,
one of the finest and most widely-
patronized houses of its kind in
Toowoomba; and the People’s
Palace, also near the railway, which
has proved a great boon to both
residents and visitors. Owing to the
expansion of the business, in 1896
Mr. O’Brien found it necessary to
take into partnership Mr. P. Horan,
who had previously been in his
employ for 10 years, and during the
same year he joined forces with
Mr. Crisp, then manager of the
Dominion Mills, and commenced the
flour-milling business known as the
Defiance Milling Company, of which
Mr. Crisp, being a keen business
man, was appointed manager. This
new enterprise proved so complete
a success that in 1904 ; in order to
provide for the increasing scope
anticipated, the firm erected a flour

After this untoward event his

of 10 children, ranging in age from
2 to 21 years, with great courage

in order to do so she had to shoulder

PATRICK CROTTY, J.P., "Glen
Brook/’ The Range, Toowoomba,
was born at Ross, County Clare,
Ireland, on April 7, 1842, and is
a son of the late Patrick Crotty,
who sprang from one of those old
Irish families, the members of which
have been engaged in farming as
far back as any records exist.
Having concluded his education at
the local national school in his
native county, the gentleman under
review followed the usual custom of
joining his father in work on the
home farm for a few years. Upon
arriving at man’s estate, however,
he decided to have a tilt at fortune
on his own account, and being
impressed by rosy reports of a
land where continual sunshine was
referred to as symbolic of universal
prosperity, he left his native isle in
1863, and in due course arrived
at Queensland, accompanied by a
younger brother (since deceased).
His first position after landing was
that of general hand on “Glengallan”
Station, near Warwick, subsequently
cut up for closer settlement, and
during the five years that he spent
there he made himself thoroughly
conversant with most departments
of pastoral enterprise, in particular
becoming one of the most expert
shearers of the early days. In 1867,
urged by ambition of a laudable
nature, he trekked west, out to the
sparsely-settled expanses which were
awaiting the hand of the master,
Man, to open up their rich resources,
and where the weakling might look
in vain for a welcome. Here he
continued the strenuous life in good
earnest, and for a couple of years
demonstrated the quality of his
manhood through the whole gamut
of station work at “Mitchell Downs.”
In 1870 he decided to settle in
Toowoomba, where he became a
well-known figure among the “old
hands” of the early days; but soon,
weary of the monotony of retirement
while still in the full vigour of
manhood, a couple of years later
he took up a block of land in the
neighbourhood of Helidon, which
he developed as a cattle station and
mixed farming proposition. In the
early eighties Mr. Crotty disposed
of this holding, and having in the
meantime secured other landed
interests elsewhere, he occupied
himself with grazing pursuits of a
more general character, also attend-
ing to affairs connected with real
estate held by him in the town of
Toowoomba. About the middle

seventies he had purchased a grazing
property in the Pittsworth district,
and for some years he resided there,
and undertook the personal super-
vision of sheep-raising operations.
Another station owned by him was
situated in the Springsure district,
and this he also stocked with sheep,
and with the assistance of his sons
continued to conduct the place for
a decade. Here he had the distinc-
tion of growing wool that not only
brought the highest price then pre-
vailing in the local market, but was
considered by experts to equal in
quality any produced in Australia.
Mr. Crotty’s public spiritedness has
been recognized in high places, and
many years ago his name was
gazetted in connection with the
Peace Commission, which he has
continued to exercise ever since.
Pie has made himself prominent in
matters locally affecting the cause
of Irish freedom, and has quietly
assumed the duty of assisting as far
as possible from this far-off point of
the compass his countrymen in Ire-
land to gain that national recogni-
tion so eagerly coveted by every true
son of Erin. He is a staunch
supporter of the Roman Catholic
Church, though broad in his views,
and always ready to assist in every
deserving call for charity, no matter
what the race or creed of the
recipient. For recreation Mr. Crotty
has recourse chiefly to the delights
of a good book, and he is specially
partial to works of biography and
history. He has been twice married,
his first wife, Bridget, to whom he
was united in 1871, being a daughter
of the late Martin O’Dea, of County
Clare, Ireland, by which union there
was issue two sons and three

time Mary (since deceased), daughter
of the late Michael Quealy, also a
native of County Clare, Ireland, by
whom he had a daughter.


JOHN OLIVER FRITH, J.P.,
“Toolmaree” Station, Augathella,
was born at “Rodway House,” Can-
nington, Somersetshire, England,
on July 23, 1861, and is a son of
Mr. James Henry Frith, who traces
his ancestry back for some hundreds
of years to ancient Scottish fore-
fathers. Mr. J. O. Frith received
his scholastic education at the Wells
and Yeovil Grammar Schools, Eng-
land, and upon the completion of
his studies sailed for South Aus-
tralia, where he remained for about
three years, being associated with
the pastoral industry on “Yacaral-
thena” Station, situated north-west
of Port Augusta. This well-known
sheep and cattle station proved an
excellent training ground for Mr.
Frith’s future career as a pastoralist,
and two years spent on “Tara”
Station, in New South Wales, gave
him further insight into the manage-
ment of stock under slightly varying
conditions. In the year 1885 he
came to Queensland, and joined the
staff of “Biddenham” Station, on
the Warrego, as overseer and acting-
manager, eventually leaving to take
a similar post on “Barenya” Station,
on the Landsborough River. In
1889 he accepted the management
of ■■Redcliffe” Station, one of the
recognized model pastoral properties
in the northern State, the adminis-
tration of which he continued until
stages of developmental work. Mr.
Frith carried on operations person-
ally until 1910, and having placed
the proposition on a sound basis and
thoroughly established its operations

on the best working lines, he relin-
quished his superintendence on the
station, and came to Toowoomba,
where he has resided in semi-retire-
ment ever since. The grazing run
“Toolmaree” is situated on the
head waters of the Ward River,
strain, which produces a very fine
quality of wool, and the flock of
15,000 presents a sight well worth
the inspection of the connoisseur.
There are rich grazing pastures on
“Toolmaree,” the nourishing “blue”
and “Mitchell” grasses growing in
profusion among others of more or
less value as stock-fatteners. A
comfortable homestead has been
erected, and other improvement
work completed, outbuildings, stock-
yards, fencing, etc., all being in
keeping with the status of the
property as one of the thriving sheep
stations of the district. “Rodway,”

Mr. Frith resides, is one of the most
picturesque and beautiful homes in
the vicinity of the city. The
immediate surroundings are of such
a nature as greatly to enhance the
attractiveness of the home, consist-
ing of a large garden area, where
beds of vivid bloom alternate with
well-kept lawns of brightest emerald
green, while, situated as it is on
the edge of the range, it commands
a view hardly to be surpassed in the
whole of Australia. Embracing

valleys, which throw the upland
country into yet higher relief, the

proved himself the possessor of
public spirit, and has generously
paid the penalty in his acceptance
of official duty in the interests of the
various communities in which his lot
has been cast. He was placed upon
the Commission of the Peace in the
early nineties, and for many years
filled honorary positions in the
membership of shire councils, boards,
and other public bodies of a similar
nature. Mr. Frith was married in
1899 to Annie Peek, daughter of
the late C. S. Robinson, of Auck-
land, New Zealand, and has four
sons.
DENNIS SHEIL, J.P., “Thorn-
bury,” Herries Street, Toowoomba,
is the eldest son of the late Francis
Sheil, who was one of the first
children of European parentage to
be born in New South Wales, and
who for over a quarter of a century
carried on farming and grazing
pursuits in the Picton district of
the Mother State. The late Mr.
Sheil died in 1890, and subsequent
to this event the property which he
had owned for so long a period
passed into the hands of his wife,
Mrs. Ann Sheil, who bequeathed it
to the third son, Mr. Frank Sheil,
stipulating that it should remain in
the family. The old home at
Wilton, near Picton, however, where
the subject of this review was born
on December 24, 1854, still con-
tinues in the possession of descen-
dants of the Sheil family. Mr.
Dennis Sheil obtained the rudiments
of learning at the public school of
the neighbourhood, and having
mastered the 'Three R’s,” and passed
through the general curriculum of
the school, he began his practical
training for the serious business of
life under the tutelage of his father.
Until about 30 years of age he con-
tinued in this connection, and in
the early eighties said farewell to
the scenes of his boyhood, and
abandoning farm life came to
Queensland, where his initial ven-
ture on his own account was in the
hotelkeeping line. After conducting
the '‘Bull’s Head” Hotel at Pitts-
worth, then known as the “Beau-
araba,” for somewhat less than two
years, he took up land at Cooranga,
and developed it as a grazing propo-
sition for some few years. Here he
acquired the art of wielding the

at the work, before the close of the
nineties found himself in charge of
the shed at “Wyobee,” the property
of the late Hon. James Tyson, his
maternal uncle. Upon being offered
the management of “Wyobee” by
the proprietor he accepted the post,
and administered affairs there for
some seven years. Towards the
end of 1898, in which year the
Hon. Mr. Tyson crossed the Great
Divide, Mr. Sheil, who about this
time suffered further bereavement
through the death of his wife,
tendered his resignation to the
executors of the estate, and coming
to Toowoomba has since interested
himself in farming occupations in
the neighbourhood of the city, his
operations in this direction embrac-
ing both independent enterprise on
a property which he owns near
Wyreema, and uses for dairying and
mixed farming, and a partnership
proposition in association with his
brother, “Euchereena,” near Jon-
daryan. He is a well-known figure
in racing circles, and for very many
years has taken a prominent part in
furthering the interests of the “sport
of Kings.” During the whole period
of his association with the turf it
has been his constant aim to free
the sport of all practices which to
the onlooker might savour of corrup-
tion, and his sportsmanlike attitude
and straightforward motives have
gone a long way towards raising the
standard of racing to its present
high level. In the past he has been
connected with several of the con-
trolling bodies, and at the present
time is a member of the Hibernian
Race Club at Toowoomba. His

of the best horses ever seen in
action in Queensland. “War Star”
won a large amount in stake money
in both handicap and weight-for-
age events, one striking performance
in particular being his victory in the
Squatters’ Handicap at Randwick,
on which occasion he defeated a
really first-class field of horses. Mr.
Shell’s connection with the sporting
world has been of
a very pleasant na-
ture, and although
only racing on a
comparatively small
scale, he has the
goodwill of the
public, who, when-
ever his colours are
seen on the course,
may depend upon
receiving a good run
for their money.
Mr. Sheil is a Jus-
tice of the Peace for
Queensland and
the neighbouring
State of New South
Wales, having
been gazetted to these offices several
years ago. His first wife, whom he
married on February 13, 1895, and
who died at “Wyobee” Station on
September 10, 1899, was a daughter
of Mr. Michael Murphy of Too-
woomba. On December 12, 1900,
he was joined in wedlock with
Catherine, daughter of the late
Peter Jacobs, an old identity of
Queensland, and one of the first
settlers in the Warwick and Stan-
thorpe districts, the issue of the
union being five sons and two
daughters.
The late RICHARD GODSALL
was born in County Hereford, Eng-
land, in 1837. Being a man of
considerable vigour, and desiring
more scope for the outlet of his
energies, in 1862 he took passage
to Queensland in the ship “Golden
City,” finally settling at Toowoomba,
where he founded the Australian
branch of the Godsall family. Here
he turned his attention to con-
tracting work, and w r as responsible
for the erection of some of the
principal public buildings and busi-
ness premises in the town of his
adoption, notable among which are
the Toowoomba Hospital, the Civic
Hall, the railway station, and the
Club Hotel. He early evinced a
keen interest in the progress of the
town and district, and in 1867
was returned as a member of the
local council by his fellow-rate-
payers, continuing to represent their
interests for a period of 12 years.
He was duly elevated to the mayoral
chair, a position he filled with
dignity on two occasions. Endowed as
he was with a sound practical business
training, Air. Godsall rendered yeo-
man service on behalf of his fellow-
townsmen, and took a leading part
in every movement having for its
object the advancement of the com-
munity wherein he resided. He was
a capable and faithful representative
throughout the whole of the time
that he sat at the council table, and
although 30 years have passed away
since his demise, it is freely
conceded by all that his progressive
spirit played an important part in
securing the elevation of the City of
Toowoomba to the pinnacle of
eminence it occupies to-day. Mr.
Godsall was prominently associated
with the inauguration of the volun-
teer system in Queensland, and when
a company was organized in the
town he received a captain’s com-
mission, later being promoted to
major. His health failing, he was
placed on the retired list, the rank
of lieutenant-colonel being conferred
upon him. lie also assisted to form
the first volunteer fire brigade in
Toowoomba, and was its premier
superintendent. The Masonic frater-
nity received his hearty support, and
he held office in the craft, besides
which he was a. foundation member
of the Order of Oddfellows and its


first master. His memory is still
cherished by the older residents of
Toowoomba, who recognized his
sterling worth, and athough he lived
amongst them for less than a quarter
of a century the many good deeds
recorded to his credit in that time
will revere his name to future
generations, and inspire them with
a worthy spirit of emulation. Mr.
Godsall died in August, 1885,
leaving a family of five sons and
four daughters, all of whom were
born at Toowoomba. The eldest son,
George A. Godsall, received his
education at the local and Brisbane
grammar schools, and at its conclu-
sion entered the Chief Engineer’s
Department of the Queensland Rail-
ways as engineering student. He
was employed for many years in
railway construction in various parts
of the State under the direction of
Mr. G. P. Forbes and other well-
known engineers, finally retiring
from the Civil Service to engage in
private business at Toowoomba. For
the past quarter of a century he has
worked indefatigably in the interests
of the town and district, and has
given his support to every movement
having for its object the advance-
ment and welfare of the community.
Mr. Godsall for many years filled
the office of chairman of the hospital
committee, and at the present time
(1914) he is a director of many of the
leading companies and associations on
the Downs. As vice-president of the
Toowoomba Turf Club he is a well-,
known figure in racing circles, and
he is also a keen patron of all forms
of manly sports. His colours have
been carried to victory on many
occasions both in Queensland and
New South Wales, and his winning
brackets include the Toowoomba
Bracelet, the Brisbane and May Day
Cups, the Anniversary Handicap, and
various other important events. Mr.
George Godsall has had several years’
military experience, and holds a
lieutenant’s commission in the Auto-
mobile Corps of the Commonwealth
Defence Forces. Herbert James
Godsall, the second son, who died in
his early forties, was for a number
of years a leading personage in the
world of sport, and at the time of
his decease was acting as manager
of the family estate. He was one of
the founders of the local ambulance
brigade, and gained great popularity
as honorary secretary to the Queens-
land Rugby Union, which post he
filled for several years. The third
son, Edwin John Godsall, now living
in retirement at Southport, in the
early part of his commercial career
gained valuable experience as an
officer in the Union Bank, and later
became a member of the firm of
Scholefield & Godsall, stock and

station agents. Following in his
father’s footsteps, he sought elec-
tion to the Toowoomba Municipal
Council, and being returned held the
seat for a decade, filling the mayoral
chair for one term. He was
an enthusiastic supporter of all
charitable movements, and being an
amateur actor of considerable ability
he frequently organized entertain-
ments to augment the funds of the
various institutions in the town. He

the Downs, where he has a large
circle of friends and acquaintances.
Albert Richard Godsall, the fourth
son, received his education at the
Christian Brothers’College, Brisbane,
assuming the management of
the Club Hotel and the other
interests of the family estate on the
death of his brother Herbert.
He has gained a wide and varied
experience of the world, having
twice circled the globe, on one of
these tours acting as Honorary
Commissioner for the Queensland
Government at the Franco-British
Exhibition held in London in 1908.
He has seen strenuous times in his
homeland, having tackled mining in
its various branches, afterwards
turning his attention to pastoral,
farming, and other pursuits. He
takes a keen interest in the affairs
of the municipality, and in 1916
was elected an alderman of the
Toowoomba City Council. At the
elections which followed the form-
ation of “Greater Toowoomba” he
was defeated, but in the ensuing
year was again returned as alderman,
on this occasion topping the poll. The
youngest son, Robert Spencer God-
sall, at the close of his education
decided to enter the medical pro-
fession. Accordingly he became a
student at the University of Sydney,
and having secured his diploma
commenced practice at Toowoomba,
filling the post of resident surgeon
to the local hospital for two years,
after which he proceeded to Great
Britain for five years, where he
gained further distinction. Subse-
quently he returned to Sydney,
where he now practises as a
specialist. He is honorary surgeon
to the Prince Alfred and Lewis-
ham Hospitals, and provost-marshall

JAMES PURCELL, J.P., of
“Bringalilly,” Hodgson Vale, Too-
woomba, was born at Drayton in
the year 1874, and is the eldest son
of Mr. Andrew Purcell, of Ramsay,
Cambooya, elsewhere referred to in
this work. He received his educa-
tion at the Ramsay State School,
leaving at an early age to help his
father on the home property, where
he remained until his twenty-second
year. He was married in 1897, and
following this event, with the assist-
ance of his father, secured a farm
at Westbrook, where he remained
until 1902, when he sold the place.
Two years later, when the “Eton
Vale” estate was thrown open for
selection, he was the first purchaser
of a block, which he has since con-
tinued to develop on the best lines,
his previous experience of farming
proving a great asset in the work.
The property is chiefly devoted to
dairy farming, and is looked upon
as one of the leading places for its
size on the Downs. The position of
the estate is ideal, nestling as it does
at the foot of the main range, and

while in the immediate vicinity are
several outbuildings fitted up with a
plant of the most modern machinery
required in the work of the farm.
He has taken his fair share of the
public work incidental to the build-
ing up of a young community, and
as a member of different local bodies
has given much of his time and
worked strenuously to bring about a
number of improvements in the lot
of the farmers and keepers of dairy
herds in the district. For three
years he served as a member of the
Clifton Shire Council, and on the
formation of the Cambooya shire,
he was returned at the head of the
poll, obtaining the extraordinary
distinction of securing the support
of every ratepayer who voted, with
one exception. He is one of the
founders of the Downs Co-operative
Dairy Company, and has acted in
the capacity of director since the
inception of the board, holding office
as chairman for three terms; besides
which he is a shareholder in other
companies of a similar nature. He
takes a lively interest in all forms
of sport, and has worked hard to
further the interests of the Cam-
booya Race Club, of which he has
been president for many years. Mr.
Purcell believes in putting his best
efforts into everything that comes to
his hand, and this spirit of earnest-
ness is manifested in all his works.

holds pride of place in point
of seniority and success. The com-
pany has a history both fascinat-
ing and instructive. It demonstrates
what grit, determination, and con-
certed effort, directed on sound lines,
can achieve. And to-day, the com-
pany is a signal example of the old
adage, “From what a small seed a
giant oak may spring.” Briefly, the
history of the company is as follows.
A preliminary meeting to consider
the formation of a butter company
was held at Mr. McAlpine’s resi-
dence, at Wcllcamp, in 1901. A
canvasser was appointed to canvass
the district, but owing to lack of


support, as subsequently reported by
him, the movement resulted in
failure. Owing to the unfavourable
season of 1902, nothing was heard
of the matter until April 23, 1904,
when a meeting was held at West-
brook. At this meeting a committee,
consisting of Messrs. Banks, Secomb,
-Pearson, Blacklock, Handley, McAl-
pine, and Read, with F. Ross as
secretary, was appointed to report on
the advisableness of forming a butter
and bacon company, with a factory
on the railway near Toowoomba.
The Westbrook meeting showed its
large company has over a small one
were the subject of much earnest
consideration. Finally, they were
summed up as follows, and on that
summary the promoters of the com-
pany decided to act:—(l) Having
more capital, the large concern is in
a position to instal the best and most
up-to-date machinery and appliances
and to make renewals when neces-
sary. As improvements in machinery
are constantly being invented, the
factory that is unable to “scrap” its
machinery as it becomes obsolete is
seriously handicapped in competition
afford to pick its market or wait until
the demand improves. (4) Having a
greater number of shareholders from
whom to choose the directorate, the
large company is more likely to get
more capable men for its directors
than the small one. This means that
the large company is more likely to
be profitably managed. The com-
mittee appointed at Westbrook met
on May 14, 1904, at the office of Mr.
F Ross, in the Club Hotel Chambers,
Margaret Street, Toowoomba. Mr.
McAlpine was appointed chairman
and Mr. Ross secretary and canvasser.

wisdom in choosing Toowoomba as
the site of the proposed factory : had
it been built at Westbrook it would
have been, at its best, a local affair,
drawing supplies from the immediate
districts only. By deciding on
Toowoomba, the converging point of
the Downs railways, as a site, the
proposed company had a chance of
becoming—what it has since become

The committee was of opinion that the
company should be formed of sup-
pliers only, the factory built on a
good site, only new machinery in-
stalled, and that the best manager
procurable should be engaged. A
resolution was carried that a co-
operative factory should be built on
the railway line at, or near Too-
woomba. After further discussion, a


sub-committee of eleven members—
iu., Messis. Handley, Canon Pughe,
Campbell, Hayter, Pearson, Irvine,
Read, Bullock, McAlpine, and Lan-
caslure—was appointed to draw up
the prospectus to be submitted to a
public meeting at an early date. To
this committee is due the credit of
having converted the movement to
establish a Co-operative company into
a business proposition. A draft of
the prospectus, dated May 26, 1904,
provided for a company with a capi-
tal of £IO,OOO. It was considered
better to fix the nominal capital at
double that amount, so as to make

for perishable products; and (d) to
manufacture ice. The canvass for
applications for shares was success-
ful, and applications sufficient to
warrant flotation were received. A
meeting of shareholders to consider
the articles of association was held
on Saturday, October 29, 1904, a
date six months after the Westbrook
meeting. At this meeting some minor
joined the great majority. At this
meeting of shareholders the secretary
reported that application money had
been paid for 2,000 shares, and pro-
mises of applications for another 280
shares had been received. Finally,
the factory was opened for the manu-
facture of butter, both for local sales
and for export trade, on October 16,
1905, with 414 shareholders and a
paid-up capital of £1,683, and 300
cream suppliers. At the end of the
year 1906 the number of shareholders
had increased to 630, the paid-up
capital to £2,703, and the number of
suppliers to 520. At the end of 1912

company’s business. The prospectus,

of the allotment of shares to farmers
and dairymen, with a minimum of

since the inception of the company.
He has always taken a keen interest
in public matters, and consequently
is well known, and very popular
throughout the district. In 1918
Mr. W. T. Harris was selected to
fill the office of chairman. The

Previous to filling his present posi-

inception of the company, he
managed cheese and butter factories

In October, 1913, he was appointed

Dairy Co. was the first Queensland
company to win an important butter
prize outside of the State by gaining
first prize for export butter at the
Islington Dairy Show, London,
in October, 1907. Doubtless this
achievement played a great part in
bringing the quality of Queensland
butter before the eyes of the world.
Since then the Downs Co-operative
Dairy Co., as well as many other
Queensland factories, have scored
several successes at the same Exhi-
bition.


WALTER BOWMAN, “Wilton
Park,” Wellcamp, Darling Downs,
was born at White Forest, South
Australia, on April 9, 1869, and is
a son of the late Alexander Bowman,
who came from Scotland among the
early settlers in the Central State,
and for over half a century was
connected with the agricultural
industry in the land of his adoption.
Mr. W. Bowman was educated
locally, afterwards working on
his father’s farm. Before emerg-
ing from his teens, however, he
decided to launch out in other
directions, and in 1888, in company
of his brother, came to Queensland,
being attracted by the favour-
able conditions offered by the Gov-
ernment of the day. Travelling
overland from South Australia, Mr.
Bowman found himself eventually
at the Diamantina River, near
Birdsville, Queensland, and shortly
afterwards he joined a droving party
for the overlanding of a mob of fat
bullocks from “Cadilgo Downs,” on
the South Australian border, to
Dubbo, via Bourke, where the stock
w-as trucked for the New South
Wales metropolis. Returning to
Queensland, for about three years
he was occupied in general bush
contract work in the western dis-
tricts, in 1882 purchasing a general
store at Beetoota, which, during the
ensuing 18 years, became one of the
largest and most up-to-date concerns
of its kind in that portion of the
State. Subsequently he was induced
their sphere of enterprise by turning
their attention to the pastoral
industry on the Diamantina River.
After about five years, in 1909,
they disposed of their interests in
Stephens, Toowoomba.
MR. WALTER BOWMAN.
Western Queensland, and Mr.
Walter Bowman purchased “Wilton
Park” estate on the Darling Downs,
where he has since resided. This
property, which is a portion of the
old “Gowrie” Station, is situated
within easy distance of the city of
Toowoomba, whence a drive of seven
miles brings the traveller to the
which the Darling Downs have
become famous. Excellently devel-
oped on modern principles, it
continues free from the botanic
pest which has been so prevalent in
many parts of the Downs, and has
proved such a deterrent to the
settlers’ prosperity in various
instances. The indigenous timber is
of a useful character for general
purposes, and the estate is mainly
dependent for water on the flow from
bores, the artesian level being struck
at a depth of about 150 feet. The
homestead, which originally belonged
to Mr. W. A. Sheil, is one of the
most compact in the neighbourhood,
and the whole estate is well fenced,
trimly gated, and conveys the appear-
ance of being thoroughly well looked
after. A word in passing must be
given to the outhouses, which are
most extensive and elaborate in
construction, being in style and size
equal to many erected on farms of
three times the acreage of “Wilton
Park,” and up-to-date in every
particular. Mixed farming is carried
on, a speciality being made of the
breeding of Clydesdale horses, and
Mr. Bowman owns a very fine
specimen of this type in the stallion

and sired by “Tom Walton”

the Imperial Government, and
played his part in the pioneering of
the Apple State, his name becoming
well known in the northern part of
the island. Upon his demise the
property reverted to the late John
Ralston, who was assisted in its
working by his sons, until upon
reaching mature years they left the
old home to seek fields for indepen-
dent enterprise in other parts of the
great island-continent. Mr. John
Bryce Ralston, the subject of this
notice, upon leaving school for a
time resided under his father’s roof-
tree, subsequently, while still in his
teens, proceeding to New Zealand,
where he engaged in the pastoral
industry on various station pro-
perties. After a lapse of a very few
years, however, he saw his way clear
to establish himself on a property
of his own, and acquired the

coast of the Dominion, north of

as a sheep-raising proposition for 15
years. At the end of this period, in
1900, he disposed of his interests in
New Zealand, and came with his
family to Queensland, where he
deemed his sons would find wider
scope for their energies, on account
of the liberal land laws and other
advantages of the Northern State.
At an earlier period the Ralston
family had made its advent to
the northern portion of Queensland,
the late John Ralston, in company
with his brother Matthew, having
pioneered “Logan Downs” and
“Banchory” Stations in the Peak
Downs district, close to Clermont,
so that a share of credit in the open-
ing up of the country must be
accorded to an older generation.
After due inspection Mr. Ralston

ling Downs, his holding being part
of the old homestead block of

ARTHUR DOUGLAS HENRY,
who owns and occupies the “Nemyle”
property, in the Wellcamp district,
is the only son of Mr. Ernest Henry,
who came from England to Aus-
tralia after hie retirement from the
British Army, in which he had held
the commission of lieutenant in the
72nd Highlanders at the time of the
Crimean war. In earlier days Mr.

old England were her glory and
defence, and made her, even then,
the “mistress of the seas.” Mr.
Henry’s advent to Queensland dates
back to the early sixties, and almost
immediately he settled on the Dar-
ling Downs, whence he turned his
attention to exploration work, being
engaged in this way, sometimes in
conjunction with an organized party,
and at other times venturing out on
his own account, accompanied only
by native assistants. Considerable
credit is due to Mr. Henry for his
contributions to the geographical
knowledge necessary for the guid-
ance of pastoralists in taking up
fresh country, and his name appears
in the annals of early pioneering in
stock and station enterprise as the
first selector of the “Hughenden”
and “Mount McConnell” Station pro-
perties, in the northern districts.
He was one of the first, if not the
first white man to explore the Clon-
curry region, further west, and
whilst travelling through this coun-
try in company with Mr. Sheaffe,
made observations of ironstone out-
crops which appeared to them to
give indication of much mineral
wealth. As a result of further
investigation and prospecting, a very
promising locality was discovered,
which afterwards became the scene
of development of the Great Aus-
tralian Mine at Cloncurry, and of
several other mining ventures, all
of considerable magnitude. Mr.
Henry was the original prospector
of the "Mount Oxide” copper mine,
which remained in his possession for
nearly 30 years. After some develop-
ment work had proved the value of
the mine it was sold, and ultimately,
after being exploited in the usual
way by a succession of syndicates
and companies, was floated at a
recent date in Great Britain into a
company, with a capital of half a mil-
lion sterling. Mr. Henry now (1915)
lives in retirement at Epping, near
Sydney, New South Wales, where
he is spending the evening of his
life in well-earned leisure after many
years of honourable and useful
service in the great work of empire-
building in Queensland. Frequent
reference is made to the veteran
pioneer in "Reminiscences of India
and North Queensland,” a volume
recently published by his cousin,
Mr. Robert Gray, the first settler
at Hughenden. Mr. Arthur Douglas
Henry was born at Warwick,
Queensland, on April 9, 1874, and
received his education at the Too-
woomba Grammar School. Upon the
termination of his scholastic course,
he joined his father at Cloncurry,

west of Toowoomba, about six miles
by road, and within a mile and a
half of the Wellcamp railway
station, the “Nemyle” property
embraces about 500 acres of undulat-
ing Downs country, rich in the
character of its soils, which yield
prolific crops of lucerne and other
fodder grasses, and have proved in
every way suitable for cultivation.
An abundant water supply is
secured by means of bores and wells,
the latter ranging in depth from
40 to 60 feet. The water obtained
is of excellent quality, and can be
freely used for domestic purposes as

house, which is surrounded by
shrubs and pepperina trees, with a
luxuriant growth of creepers, and in
the front a bright garden of flowers

touch to the scene. Mr. Henry’s
chief hobby is his home, which,
together with the deep interest he
takes in his stud stock, especially
the Ayrshire cattle, provides him
with sufficient recreation without
going farther afield. He was mar-

“Nemyle” originally was taken up
by the late Mr. Broadribb, who
spent lavishly in laying out the
homestead area, with the object of
retaining it in the family. After
his death, however, the place was
sold, and subsequently came into the
hands of Mr. Henry, who has
utilized it as a mixed-farming pro-
position, with the ultimate intention
of developing it more particularly as
a stud station. He has already
inaugurated operations in this direc-
tion with a small herd of Ayrshire
cattle, which will be enlarged as
opportunity allows, and has met with
success in the breeding of Clydesdale

raising it being chiefly by windmills,
of which there are several on the

maximum of convenience, and no

THOMAS WILLIAM RICHARD-
SON, owner of “Barnawartha,” near
Wellcamp, Darling Downs, is a
native of Victoria, his birthplace
being Wodonga, in that State,
where he first saw the light on
June 16, 1873. His father, the late
Henry Richardson, came to Aus-
tralia as a youth in his teens, from
Liverpool, England, and spent half
a century in Victoria, where he was


among the early pioneers of the
Yackandandah mining field, subse-
quently becoming one of the best
known squatters of the north-eastern
quarter of Victoria, where his
property, the old “Barnawartha”
Station, which is still in possession
of the family, was one of the
prominent pastoral holdings of the
district. The gentleman under
review was educated at St. Francis
Xavier’s College, Kew, Victoria,
and upon the completion of his
collegiate course remained for a few
years on his father’s station, where
he took full advantage of the oppor-
tunities afforded him of graduating
in the school of pastoral operations.
In the year 1907 he made his
departure to Queensland, and after
travelling all over the State in
quest of a suitable property he
selected his present holding as
offering excellent advantages in the
way of soil, climate, and convenient
locality for the purpose he had in
view, viz., the forming of a mixed-
farming proposition. This property,
to which he gave the name of
“Barnawartha,” after the old home
in Victoria, was originally a portion

abundantly supplied by bores, and
windmills have been erected on
various parts of the property.
About 300 acres have been placed
under cultivation of lucerne, which
attention to the study of stock-
breeding, as the superior type of
sheep on the farm, and the classy
draught horses, in which their
owner takes so just a pride, both
testify. Of the latter an amply
sufficient number are retained for
use on the property, the surplus
being sent to the markets, where
they command a ready sale. Pur-
chasers are also readily forthcoming
for the fat lambs raised by Mr.
Richardson for local consumption.
The “Barnawartha” homestead was
built by Mr. Richardson in the early
days of his occupation of the
property, and is a well-built, roomy
house, containing: nine lofty, well-
ventilated and lighted apartments.
Comfort and convenience rather
than elaborate design have been
made the premier consideration in
its erection, and this principle has
been carried throughout, with the
result that a home in the truest
sense of the word has been formed.
The necessary outbuildings and
general adjuncts to a prosperous
farming enterprise have been added
from time to time as occasion arose,
and improvements of a progressive

operations under the title of McLeish
and Alexander for some few years.
Before the eighties Mr. McLeish
retired from the business, which, left
in the hands of Mr. Alexander, was
shortly afterwards reinforced by the
introduction of another principal in
the person of Mr. J. H. Munro.
Towards the close of the third
decade the business had expanded
considerably, and it was found
necessary to secure larger premises.
Accordingly in 1883 Messrs. Alexan-
der and Munro turned their atten-
tion to the erection of a new build-
ing, where they might cope more
readily with the increasing demands
of their large clientele. The opening
of the premises in 1884 was regarded
by the citizens as quite an epoch in
the commercial history of the town,
and the partners had every reason to
feel satisfied with the success of their
forward movement. In course of
time Mr. Alexander retired, and
Mr. Munro found himself sole
proprietor. After conducting oper-
ations for a further period under
the old name the latter gentle-
man sold the business to Messrs.
Allan & Stark, who ran it as a
branch of their Brisbane house,
under the management of Mr. J. H.
Jones. Two years later Mr. Jones
acquired the rights of ownership,
Mr. Annand also securing an in-
terest, and for the ensuing six years
the firm experienced prosperous
times. Mr. Jones then retired in
favour of Mr. W. H. Gobbett, who,
with Mr. Annand, carried on the
business under the name and title of
Gobbetts, Limited. Eventually Mr.
0. Booth secured an interest in
the business, and upon these pro-
gressive spirits descended Mr. Gob-
bett’s mantle when he relinquished
the helm in 1913. Messrs Annand
and Booth both received their train-
ing in the house in which they have
now assumed the role of principals,
Mr. Annand, whose connection with

the firm extends back over 25 years,
preceding his present partner by
half a decade’s service. Mr. Booth’s
father, the late Mr. Joseph Booth,
was also a valued and prominent
member of the staff, and to his
expert and vigorous tutelage both
the younger men owe much of their
present excellent grip of commercial
methods. At the present time the
house carries a staff of close on 100
employes, and its sphere of opera-
tions stretches out beyond the
Downs to Western Queensland,
many hundreds of dwellings depend-
ing mainly for their supplies in the
efficiency of the system employed by

department proving an immense
boon to many of the out-back sett-
lers. As a “universal provider’s”
business its stock includes general
drapery, mercery, mantles, haber-
dashery, silks, hosiery and fancy
goods, footwear, linoleums, man-
chester goods, art furnishings,
leatherware, groceries, ironmongery,
produce, etc., etc. Both Mr.
Annand and Mr. Booth take a keen
interest in matters of local moment.
In 1915 Mr. Annand filled the
presidential chair of the Too-

and of the Horticultural Society,
besides which he is on the com-
mittees of most local bodies, while
Mr. Booth is a staunch member of

John Gore, a descendant of a family
of ancient lineage, dating back to the
time of the Earl of Arran (1662),
and which has figured prominently
in the annals of Irish aristocracy
ever since. The'late gentleman was
a native of Dublin, and left the
Emerald Isle in the late fifties, pro-
ceeding to Tasmania, where he was
engaged as a jackaroo on the estate
of the late Lord Talbot. Subse-
quently he followed pastoral pur-
suits in Victoria for a short time,
about a decade after his arrival in
the antipodes finding his way to
Queensland. In the Northern State
he undertook much pioneering work,
and assisted in the formation of
several stations in the Peak Downs
district, and Belyando country (for
a southern syndicate ) the latter at
that time being regarded as terra
incognita. As a slight appreciation
of the value of his pioneering efforts
the Government of the day appointed
Mr. R. F. J. Gore to the position
of engineer and surveyor (which was
his original profession) in the Roads
and Bridges Department, and while
filling this office he was responsible
for the construction of many of the
old public roads in the western dis-
tricts of Queensland. Later, when
divisional boards were created, he
was attached to various of these
bodies, besides which he held admin-
istrative positions on behalf of the
Government both at Roma and Esk.
Memories of the many valued ser-
vices he rendered to the State in its
early days will be recalled long after
the old landmarks have been swept
away by the insistent hand of
Father Time. Mr. Gore married in
1874, Susan Jane, daughter of the
late William Stephenson, of Mea-
ford, Canada (where he was one of
the early pioneers), and widow of
the late Frederick Fetherstonhaugh,
of County Wicklow, Ireland. He
died in January, 1914, a family of
three sons and one daughter surviv-
ing him. Mr. A. C. Gore, the
youngest son, was born at Roma on
March, 27, 1884. He received his
elementary training at the Esk
State School, completing his schol-
astic career at the Brisbane Gram-
mar School. In 1901 he joined the
staff of the Bank of New South
Wales as a probationer. He
remained in the service of the bank
for a period of seven years. During
this time he held various positions
at Brisbane and Toowoomba, being
transferred to Cambooya when a
branch office was opened there.
Realizing that the prospects of rapid
promotion in the bank’s service were
very small, he established himself
as a stock and station agent and auc-
tioneer in the town. Mr. Gore was not

have been successfully dealt with.


ROSENSTENGEL & KLEI-
MEYER, furniture warehousemen,
Toowoomba. This well-known busi-
ness, which was established in 1877
on a modest scale, to-day ranks as
one of the most important manu-
facturing concerns on the Darling
Downs, wdiile it is easily first in its
own particular line. The huge pre-
mises cover over two acres of
ground, and in the various depart-
ments nearly seventy hands are
employed, most of whom are skilled
workmen. The showrooms occupy
pride of place in the big warehouse,
and contain a wide range of furnish-
ings, from the handsome dining-room
suite down to the humbler require-
ments of mansion and cottage. The
storehouse, in which a comprehensive
stock of furniture is safely housed, is
one of the largest brick structures
in Queensland, while other buildings
shelter immense supplies of material
necessary to the carrying on of the
manufactory. There is a branch of
the business at Dalby, which is chiefly
used as a depot for the parent house
at Toowoomba. Mr. Rosenstengel
w r as born at Erfurt, in the Province
of Thuringia, Germany, on Septem-

review served hie apprenticeship to
the upholstery trade, and subse-
quently journeyed to various indus-

the Fatherland with the object of
enlarging his knowledge of the

in Bavaria, he decided to seek
Australian shores, and accordingly

MR. B. ROSENSTENGEL.
“Lammershagan,” reaching Rock-
hampton, Queensland, on September
5, 1871. He was first engaged in
the mining industry at the alluvial
diggings on the Ravenswood field.
Possessing no previous knowledge
of this kind of work he found the
task very strenuous, but having made
up his mind to accept any employ-
ment that offered, he persevered,
and gradually became inured to
the prevailing state of affairs.
For nearly three years he continued
at Ravenswood, winning from the
earth a fair quantity of golden metal.
In 1874 he left the goldfields,
and turning his steps towards the
metropolis became engaged as a
journeyman worker in Queen Street,
at the establishment of Mr. Milne,
who, in conjunction with a Mr.
Rourke, was a prominent figure in
commercial circles in the very early
days of Brisbane. After three years
in this connection Mr. Rosenstengel
joined forces with the late Mr.
Kleimeyer, a fellow-employe in the
above business, who having pre-
viously paid a visit to Toowoomba
to ascertain whether any opening
offered in the big inland town,
induced Iris friend to cross the range
and see for himself the excellent
prospects there awaiting an enter-
prising firm. Upon the establisli-
ment of the business the two
partners were assisted solely by a
man and a couple of boys, and one
of the latter, who has continued in
the firm’s service for close on 40 years,
is now (1915) foreman of the works.
Progress, at first slow, but main-
tained by strict adherence to honest
dealings and industrial integrity,
soon increased by leaps and bounds,
until the name of the firm became a
hallmark of superiority, not only in
Toowoomba, but far beyond the
limits of the Darling Downs. The
prestige thus won has been sustained,
and under the personal supervision
of the genial proprietor bids fair to
continue indefinitely. Mr. Klei-
meyer, who from the inception of
the enterprise had shared the re-
sponsibilities of management, died
in April, 1915. Mr. Rosenstengel
was created a Justice of the Peace
about a quarter of a century ago,
and has proved his good citizenship
in many directions. He is an ex-
tensive reader, being a student of
political economy and other subjects
of a like character. He married in
1875 Margaret, daughter of the late
Dennis Moynihan, a name much re-
spected in the County of Kerry, Ire-
land, whence Mrs. Rosenstengel came
as a girl to Queensland. Of the four
daughters and six sons of the union,
the second son is inspecting engine 3r
for Messrs. R. N. Hunt & Co.,
London and Chicago; one is in holy
orders, a third in the dental profes-
sion, while the remaining three are
identified wth their father in busi-
ness pursuits.


The TOOWOOMBA FOUNDRY
COMPANY, LIMITED, (proprie-
tors, Messrs. A. A. & G. TI. Griffiths),
This foundry was originally started
in 1871 by Mr. G. W. Griffiths,
father of the present directors, and
carried on later in conjunction with
his brother (Mr. J. A. Griffiths) and
brother-in-law (Mr. L. W. Mars-
land, a member of the legal profes-
sion, now resident at Charters
Towers). The first site occupied by
the firm, which was then known as
Griffiths Bros., was in Ruthven
Street, but after three years a move
was made to the present location.
One of the very first contracts
The company suffered heavily during
the great depression in the early
nineties, but about 1896 the Queens-
land Government placed large con-
tracts for additional rolling-stock,
which brought about a revival of the
normal activities of the foundry.
A sound trade was maintained until
the drought of 1902, which swept
away the demand for additional
rolling-stock, and the company was
once again face to face with slack
times. The dry period was not
altogether a disaster to the State,
as it caused stockowners to seek
other means of supplying water to
their stock, and with the tapping of
management specializing in the
construction of boring plants, etc.
Lai'ge works have been installed near
Sydney, New South Wales, and at
Rockhampton, the latter to meet the
requirements of North and Central
Queensland, besides which depots
have been opened at several of the
principal trading centres. Within
the past four years the manufacture
of locomotives has been commenced,
and two contracts have been satis-
factorily completed for the Queens-
land Government. In 1915 ten
engines were constructed for the
Commonwealth Government for use
on the trans - Australian line

undertaken by the firm was the
building of the old waterworks at
Toowoomba, following which came
the construction of rolling-stock for
the Railway Department. In the
early eighties the concern was floated
into a company, and the list of
shareholders contained the names of
quite a number of residents of the
town. The ensuing two years were
highly prosperous ones, and it was
found necessary to erect special
works at Woolloongabba to enable
the firm to deal expeditiously with
an order for the supply of steel
sleepers for the Normanton railway.
the great underground lakes came a
heavy demand for suitable machinery
for well-boring and pumping pur-
poses, and the company receiving
large orders took on a new
lease of life. At this juncture
Mr. G. W. Griffiths’ two sons
acquired a portion of their father’s
interests in the business, and
taking over the general management
devoted the whole of their energies
to the furtherance of its affairs.
The present prosperity of the com-
pany is chiefly due to the extensive
use of artesian waters throughout
the dry areas of Australia, the
connecting Western Australia with
the Eastern States. The company
has an elaborate plant of the
most modern machinery, and finds
employment for over 400 hands,
Messrs. Atherton Alfred Griffiths
and George Herbert Griffiths are
both natives of Toowoomba. The
success which they have achieved by
their unflagging zeal is richly
deserved, and it would be difficult
indeed to estimate the great benefits
which have accrued to the city
within the boundaries of which this
flourishing business has reared its
walls.
The farming and dairying regions traversed by the
Oakey to Cooyar and Kingsthorpe to Haden branch
railways are bounded on the south by the line connecting
the western towns from Dalby to Charleville with
Toowoomba. Kingsthorpe lies 14 miles from Toowoomba
and 115 from Brisbane, whilst the spur to Haden runs
due north for 19 miles, Haden, the terminus, having
its site beneath the western slope of the main range,
and but a mile or so away from the division between
the Wo chief watersheds into which Queensland, and,
indeed, the whole of eastern Australia, is apportioned.
Oakey is only 7 miles beyond Kingsthorpe, and the two
branch lines are almost parallel to one another, though
the more western of the two bends somewhat in a
westerly direction about the centre of its 39 miles of
length. Between Muntapa and Nutgrove the route
crosses the main range at a point slightly more than
2,000 feet above sea level and about 9 miles to the
OAKEY TO COOYAR.


south of the terminus. A straight line surveyed from
the lastnamed place to Nanango, the terminus of the
branch from the main northern line at Tbeebine, a few
miles south of Maryborough, would just miss passing
through the township of Yarraman Creek, the terminus
of the 100 miles of Brisbane Valley railway. The con-
struction of the connection between Yarraman Creek
and Nanango already has been approved by the Public
Works Standing Committee, and obvious important
advantages would accrue from linking up the whole
three lines.
Oakey is easily the mcst important of the towns
in the district under review. The surrounding country
is typical of the Darling Downs, volcanic soil of great
depth giving a fertility which continues year after year
without the aid of artificial fertilization, and producing
high yields from a wide variety of crops. The official
returns for 1914, which at the time of writing are the
latest available, as well as the last to be uninfluenced
by the abnormal conditions arising from the war, show
a total of 50,587 acres under cultivation within the
petty sessions district of Oakey. The significance of
these figures become apparent only when considered in
relation to the aggregate area of land farmed in the
State as a whole. In the same year as has already
been taken for illustration, the total acreage under
cultivation in Queensland was 981,218.
The most favoured form of farming at Oakey
consists in the production of green crops, most of which
are used for feeding to dairy cattle. In 1914 30,950
acres were turned to this purpose. Maize is so well
suited to the natural conditions of the district that a
greater area is sown with this seed than with any other
single form of crop, the area devoted to the purpose in
1914 being 10,582 acres, a figure to be rivalled by but
few districts north of New South Wales. A good deal
of attention is also bestowed on wheat, and in the year
already quoted this form of cereal was produced from
5,993 acres, from which the yield was 33,000 bushels.
It is but fair to mention that the seasonal circumstances
of that particular period proved far from normal, and
the average acreage production of grain was much below
that which the farmer is justified to expect in ordinary
times.
The mcst important source of revenue to the popu-
lation of the Oakey country is provided by the dairying
industry, and the petty sessions district contains 376
dairying establishments, together with one butter and
one cheese factories. The farms contained on Decem-
ber 31, 1914, 5,326 cows in milk, and 1,003 head of
dry dairy cattle. For tire twelve months the production
of butter was 614,467 lbs., and of cheese 271,750 lbs.
Substantial as is the agricultural industry in this dis-
trict, as shown by the foregoing statistics, Oakey is
but on the threshold of its real progress. The centre
is surrounded by hundreds of thousands of acres of first-
class agricultural land of deep, rich soil, thoroughly
adapted to return heavy yields from a wide variety of
crops and artificial grasses. The stock-carrying capacity
of the country is naturally high, and it is increasing
every year as a result of the extension of the cultivation
of green crops, permanent prolific fodder plants, such
as lucerne, and intense culture generally. A review of
the peculiarities of the local soil and climate, together
with other natural characteristics, go to confirm the
views formed of other parts of the Darling Downs, and
expressed in this volume in descriptions of other centres
in that garden of Queensland. When the seasonal rains
appear in. normal volume farming in that well-favoured
region becomes an easy task, for where others are
dependent on artificial and other forms of manure, the
agriculturist of the Downs desiring to make his field
richer than it proved the year before, and perhaps fol-
lowing a series of seasons of continuous cropping, may
achieve his purpose by the simple operation of plough-
ing an inch or two deeper, for many feet of homogeneous
fertility extend from the surface downwards without
diminution or variation.
Oakey has been connected by rail with Brisbane for
many years. The extension from Toowoomba to Jon-
daryan, which lies 9 miles beyond Oakey, was officially
declared open for traffic on November 18, 1867, the
continuation to Dalby being completed about six months
later. The branch line to Cooyar was not finished until
April, 1913. Oakey is the junction also for a branch
line to Evanslea, a continuation of which is in course
of construction at the time of writing (1918) and will con-
nect with “Cecil Plains,” where the Government is sub-
dividing into farms many thousands of acres of excellent
agricultural land previously held for pastoral purposes
in extensive areas. The line from Oakey to Evanslea
was officially declared open on September 20, 1915.
The progress of this vigorous policy of railway construc-
tion within the immediate neighbourhood, and placing
Oakey in so central a position, has stimulated the pro-
gress of that place so that the population of 1,568, which
the census of 1911 showed to live within a 5-mile radius
of the town, has of late years been substantially
augmented. The industrial development of the district
has been accelerated by a steady subdivision of the
larger holdings and a resultant intensification of
industry.
The township of Haden has not passed beyond the
humble proportions of the pioneering stage, and cattle-
raising and timber-getting form a larger share of the
total activities than is the case with the longer farmed
land about Oakey. That part of the main range which
is known as the Bunya Mountains overshadows the
village, and the forests which clothe the rough country
provide material for sawmills that are kept continuously


busy. Mixed farming and dairying occupy the main
attentions of the farmers. Cooyar is supported by the
same variety of industries as is Haden. The districts
surrounding both centres are passing steadily from the
more primitive business of stock-raising on large areas,
and timber-getting from lands of high agricultural
value, to farming as conducted on small areas. Much
of the country consists of undulating plains, with rich,
deep, volcanic soil, whilst a plentiful water supply for
stock and domestic purposes may be obtained almost
anywhere in the neighbourhood by sinking to shallow
depths. An altitude of up to 2,000 feet gives a bracing
climate, which besides favouring the activities of
dairy-farmers and agriculturists, proves exceedingly
health-giving to the inhabitants. A coach service
gives connection with the Brisbane Valley line at
Yarraman Creek and with the northern branch line
at Nanango.
JOSEPH WILLIAM WAIMEA
BEALE, J.P., of “Aorangi,” Oakey,
Darling Downs, is a New Zealander
by birth, having first seen the light
at Goldsborough, a email town in
the vicinity of Mount Cook.
Waimea, situated in the County of
Westland, is famous for its beautiful
scenery and snow-capped Southern
Alps. Mr. Beale’s grandfather, the
late Joseph Beale, first landed at
Melbourne on December 16, 1852,
having voyaged from Ireland to
MR. JOSEPH BEALE.
Australia with his two sons, Joseph
and Francis, by the "Sarah Sands,”
one of the first steamboats to carry
passengers from Great Britain to the
Antipodes, and which on her follow-
ing voyage was destroyed by fire at
sea. This gentleman, who was the
first representative of his family to
cross the ocean, traced his ancestry
back 300 years in Ireland, whence
the Beales of a yet earlier period had
emigrated from Suffolk, England,
and mention is made in history of
a certain Robert Beale, one of their
line, as having handed the warrant
of execution to the ill-fated Mary,
Queen of Scots. The three pioneer
voyagers to the land of the Southern
Cross were subsequently joined by
other members of the family from
the old country, some of whom
settled in Victoria, where the late
Joseph Beale, senior, died at Mel-
bourne, about a decade after his
arrival. The two brothers, however,
who had accompanied their father
in the first instance, made a further
flight in 1860, when they were
attracted to New Zealand by the
lure of gold discoveries, and became
connected with the early mining
industry there for some little time.
Subsequently they settled down in
the Dominion, and continued for a
considerable period, Francis being
the first to return to the island-
continent, making his advent to
Sydney, New South Wales, in the
early seventies. Here he established
his reputation as a master manufac-
turer, and at a later date extended
the scope of his operations by
founding the Queensland branch of
the well-known firm of Beale & Co.,
Limited, sewing machine manu-
facturers; and in this connection it
may be mentioned that another
brother, Octavius Charles, estab-
lished the large piano factory at
Sydney, which has since grown to
be one of the most important manu-
facturing concerns in the Common-
wealth. The eldest brother, Joseph,
was engaged for many years in store-
keeping pursuits in Westland, New
Zealand, and afterwards became
prominent in the meat-preserving
and export trade. From this he
turned to stock-grazing, ultimately
selling out his interests in the
Dominion, and coming in 1899 to
Queensland, where he purchased a
portion of the "Westbrook” Station
property, then being cut up for
closer settlement. Perceiving the
excellent opening for extended
dairying enterprise, Mr. Beale at
once proceeded to pioneer this
industry in the Oakey district,
where he was mainly instrumental
in establishing the well-known
Oakey Co-operative Butter Factory,
which was the pioneer of similar

institutions in this neighbourhood,
where dairying is now one of the
chief features of industry. The late
Mr. Beale continued to reside on his
estate, to which he gave the name
of “Mokoia,” until the time of his
death, which occurred in the year
1906. The subject of this review is
the eldest son of the last-named
gentleman, and received his educa-
tion at Wellington College, New
Zealand. Being intended for a


commercial career, he was appren-
ticed to the hardware business in
Sydney, but after completing his
term, being desirous of a change, he
joined his father in farming avoca-
tions, and taking charge of the farm
continued to control affairs for six
years. A favourable opening then
presenting itself for opening a
hardware business in Palmerston
North, New Zealand, Mr. Beale once
more turned his attention to indoor
enterprise, three years later dispos-
ing of his business in New Zealand
to purchase a similar concern at
Oakey, in this State, which he
conducted successfully for five years.
He finally relinquished commercial
life once more to identify himself with
the landed interests of his father, and
subsequent to the latter’s demise took
over the general management of the
estate, to which he now devotes the
whole of his time and energies.
Comprising in the first place an
area of 6,700 acres, “Mokoia,” since
1906, has been considerably reduced,
over 3,000 acres, including the old
homestead, having passed into the
hands of other owners, who have
retained the name. To the 3,000
odd acres, constituting the pick of
the land, which was kept out of the
market, Mr. Beale has given the
title of “Aorangi,” adopted from
Stephens, Toowoomba.

native legends connected with the
place of his birth, and here he
pursues a policy of mixed farming,
in which grazing plays the most
important part. A rich chocolate
soil predominates, favourable to
the growth of a large variety of
indigenous grasses, and making
excellent lucerne and wheat country,
from five to six hundred acres being
placed under cultivation of the
latter cereal every year. A flock of
3,000 Lincoln crossbreds is grazed
upon the pastures, and upon occa-
sion the farm is used as a fattening,
depot, according to the state of the
markets and general conditions.
Excellent water, suitable both for
stock and domestic purposes, is
plentifully provided by wells, sunk
to depths varying from 30 to 50 feet,
and though chiefly open plain the
estate is well supplied with clumps
of timber, forming adequate shelter
for the stock in the heat of summer.
Further advantages are the con-
venient railway facilities provided
by the near vicinity of the Wilthorn
station, which is situated within the
boundaries of the estate. Mr. Beale
(who was created a J.P. in 1905),
married in 1906, Maud Amelia,
daughter of Mr. Thomas Brown, of
Greymouth, New Zealand, and has
one son.

JOHN PHILLIP JOST, J.P.,
was born at Darmstadt, in the
Grand Duchy of Hessen, Germany,
in the month of November, 1835,
and is a son of the late George Jost,
a butcher and hotelkeeper by trade,
who spent the whole of his life
within the boundaries of the above-
mentioned Duchy. At the close of
his education, which he pursued in
his native town, Mr. J. P. Jost
began to assist his father in business
pursuits, being then 14 years of age.
At 18 he proceeded to Frankfurt,
where he gained further experience
in the butchering trade, and having
emerged from his teens, set his face
in the direction of foreign lands,
where he might indulge his leaning
towards adventure, and find ample
scope for his energies. Choosing
MR. GEORGE JOST.
Australia as a new country with big
possibilities, which made it an
enchanted land to the ambitious
youth of the civilized nations of the
Old World, Mr. Jost secured his
passage, and arrived at Moreton
Bay, on January 12, 1856, before
the separation of Queensland from
the Mother State of New South
Wales. LTis decision to seek employ-
ment at the capital led to disappoint-
ment, but before a very long interval
had elapsed work was offered him
at a factory on the Clarence River,
New South Wales, owned by Messrs.
Sharpe & Kirchiner, where he con-
tinued for somewhat less than 12
months. Still athirst for wider
experience, he determined to return
to Moreton Bay, and with this
purpose in view, walked overland to
Ipswich, where he worked as a jour-
neyman in his trade for about a year.
A subsequent visit to Brisbane
decided him to make a bolder bid
for fortune’s favours, and he accord-
ingly established himself in a
butchering business on his own
account in Queen Street, where his
premises, opposite the General Post
Office, became a well-known land-
mark in the city. In the year 1876
he disposed of this business, and
under the Land Act of 1868 took
up a grazing area of 10,000 acres,
situated on the Brisbane side of the
range, where he pastured both sheep
and cattle for over 30 years. In
1901 this property was purchased by
Mr. A. J. Cotton, and in the follow-
ing year Mr. Jost sailed for his
native land, where he renewed all
the associations of his youthful days,
paid his devoirs to various relatives
in the Fatherland, and travelled
somewhat extensively beyond the
borders of Germany, visiting many
places of interest in England, Scot-
land, and Ireland. Upon his return
to Queensland he purchased a resi-
dence at Toowoomba, where he lived
in retirement for five or six years,
but gradually a life of leisure palled
upon him, while the comparative
confinement of the city chafed a
spirit which had become accustomed
to the wide spaces and perfect free-
dom of the Downs. Awaiting his
opportunity, he at length found the
property he had been seeking in
“Jost Yale,” a snug little farm
situated within two miles of Oakey,
and selling his Toowoomba home
settled down to the conduct of his
new proposition, of which he has
since made a hobby. The farm com-
prises between 1,100 and 1,200
acres, where mixed farming, dairy-
ing operations, etc., are successfully
carried on under the capable admin-
istration of an efficient manager,
while Mr. J ost finds congenial
occupation in watching the general
progress of affairs, and though
living in semi-retirement maintains
his interest in the various details
brought under his notice by Mr. A.
McDonald, his trusty lieutenant.
He has always been keenly interested
in racing, and in the early days of
Queensland there were few more
active supporters of the “sport of
Kings” than the gentleman under
review. He was an enthusiastic
breeder of the best blood stock, and
for over a score of years worked
energetically to raise the breeding
of thoroughbreds to a high level.
He was very successful on the turf,
both in Queensland and New South
Wales, winning many classic events
in each State. At the A.J.C. Spring
Meeting of 1883 “Le Grand,” by
“Epigram”—“Legend,” was success-
ful in the Derby, winning by three
lengths, and followed up this per-
formance by taking the Randwick
and Craven Plates, all weight-for-
age events. In 1884, “Petronel,”
by “Goldsborough” “Paradise,”
credited Mr. Jost with the Q.T.C.
Derby, the Queensland Cup, and the
Prince of Wales Cup, and a year
later his representative “Elbe,” by
“The Drummer”—“Empress,” was

all within a comparatively short
space of time. The Brisbane Cup
of 1884 also fell to his share through
the medium of the 4-year-old mare
"Legacy” (“Epigram”—“Legend”),
which carried 8.2 to victory with a
length to spare. Mr. Jost is a
large property owner in Toowoomba,
where, in addition to other real
estate, he owns the Royal Hotel and
the Governor Blackall Hotel. He
was married in 1859 to Catherine
Leahy (now many years deceased),
one of the early immigrants to Aus-
tralia from Ireland, and has a
surviving family of three sons and
one daughter.

owner of “Rosalie Plains” Station,
Oakey, Darling Downs. The family
connection of the Chesneys is one
of the oldest in the United King-
dom, where it dates back in an
unbroken line for several centuries,
The Chesneys belong to the Norman
stock of De Camilo, or De Chesnaye,
whose services William the Con-
queror rewarded with large posses-
sions in the North of England,
Robert Chesney, a descendant of
a Scotch branch of the family,
removed to the North of Ireland in
his eldest son, Alexander (after-
wards captain), took a very active
part on the Royalist side. Captain
Chesney was in numerous engage-

times, and desperately wounded, but
escaped with his life. He was pro-
moted and placed on the staff under
the Marquis of Hastings, where he
distinguished himself by opening up
communications with headquarters
at Charleston, and won for himself
the lasting friendship of Lord
Rawdon and Lord Cornwallis. His
health being much broken by the
Captain Chesney married Jane Wil-

and Elizabeth Kirkpatrick. The
Kirkpatrick connection dates back to
1232: T. Kirkpatrick of Clareburn
married a daughter of King Robert
Bruce, and another son married a
daughter of Lord Darnley. Mrs.
Chesney’s great-aunt, Margaret Wil-
son, a girl of 18, was done to death
in the Solway, rather than subscribe
to the hated Prelacy, a fact which
is well known to readers of Scottish
history. The military details affect-

General Chesney’s chief aim and

great meeting of the council of the
Suez Canal. Having accepted the
invitation upon this important
occasion, to his astonishment and
consternation M. de Lesseps took
General Chesney by the hand, and
leading him forward, said in the
most sincere and generous manner,
“Messieurs, je vous presente I’homme

to you the man to whom we owe

proceeded to relate how Chesney’s
survey of the isthmus and published
account of the level had first con-
vinced him of the practicability of
the great scheme, since so success-

and engineering skill, and concluded
by a special invitation to the General

Mr. J. McC. Chesney’s father, the
late William Chesney, was exten-
sively engaged in the linen industry,
prior to the days of machine™. In
course applied himself to mastering
the details of the linen trade, which
engaged his attention for some five
years. In 1888 lie decided to seek


his fortune in other lands, and
accompanied by his wife and young
family took passage for Australia,
where various members of his family
connection who had preceded him
were doing prosperously in the
pastoral industry. Upon arrival he
gained his first colonial experience
on “Coree” Station, New South
Wales, where he remained for
upwards of two years. Following
on this he undertook the manage-
merit of “Goolgumbla” Station, which
he administered on behalf of Sir
Samuel McCaughey for eight and a
half years. At the end of 1899 he
resolved to strike out on his own

the soil being a brown loam, with
patches of black soil here and there,

sandy character. Clumps of box,
brigalow, myall, appletree, andiron-
bark constitute the chief timber of
the region, and a bounteous water
supply is secured by means of wells,

he purchased his present holding,
then a freehold property comprising
26,000 acres. Mr. Chesney has since
disposed of 1,000 acres, and the
remainder he has devoted to the
grazing of sheep and cattle, in
addition to which he cultivates a
farm of about 1,000 acres, where
crops of wheat, barley, and oats,

J.P. The “Newlands” property is
situated on the eastern side of the
Great Dividing Range, the general
contour of the country which it
covers being very hilly, with out-
crops of basaltic rock, although in
the vicinity of the homestead exten-
sive flats are found, which have
proved highly suitable for cultiva-
tion purposes. It embraces an area
of 1,700 acres, of which the major
portion is devoted to grazing, the
remainder of the property being
used for mixed-farming purposes,
and for its water supply depends
partly upon Emu Creek, which runs
through the estate, but at
this part of its course is not
permanent, and upon five
wells, which provide an
ample supply of good stock
water, the slightly brackish
quality proving no serious
drawback. The property
originally was covered with
softwood vine scrub, which
has all been cleared, patches
of timber for shade purposes
only breaking the open pas-
ture country, which stretches
away over the hills to the
west. Natural grasses
abound, but these have
been augmented by the
introduction of paspalum

a droving trip to Roma,
thence travelling to Mun-

which centre he overlanded

Hardly, however, had he established
this branch of enterprise on a pay-

1902-3 occurred, with its disastrous
results to stockholders, both large
and small. Though sadly thrown
back by the loss of a number of valu-
able cattle, with the break-up of the
drought in 1904 matters again be-

The district containing the townships of Green-
mount and Cambooya is noted in an industrial sense
principally because of the large amount of cheese
exported from there, the neighbourhood containing
something like a dozen cheese factories, besides butter
factories. Both places are on the main Southern line,
Cambooya being 14 miles beyond Toowoomba, and
Greenmount 8 miles further on. Originally this country
was devoted almost exclusively to grazing sheep, the
open plains of clean, sound volcanic soil proving excel-
lently suited to that class of stock. However, the
i n c reasing
needs of in-
tending far-
mers, coupled
with the re-
sultant ad-
vance in land
prices, forced
the adoption
of a more in-
tensive form
of industry,
and the old
runs came
one by one
to be cut
into smaller
blocks, which
were eagerly
secured by a number of working agriculturists.
The country mainly consists of treeless plains,
much of which needs no preparation before being
ploughed. The downs are bleak in winter, owing to
the bitter winds which sweep almost uninterrupted over
the open spaces. However, some shelter is afforded to
stock by the timber growing on ridges which run across
the widespreading flats.
In the first place the district was comprised within
the boundaries of one huge pastoral station, but the
evolutionary subdivision has proceeded so far that,
with the exception of a few purely pastoral runs, the
present holdings vary in size from 640 acres to a few
thousand acres each in extent. Though these would
rank as fairly large farming properties in other

States, conditions in Queensland as yet are such that
more land is needed by the farmer than is the case
where population is so much denser. The district is
intersected by the Hodgson River, which is a tribu-
tary to the Condamine River. Each of the two towns
mentioned contains only a few hundreds of population,
but both are well provided with banks, schools, business
places, and other public conveniences. Greenmount
takes its name from a hill immediately at the back of
the town. Being clothed with open forest, and rising
in the midst of flat plains country, this elevation adds
considerably
to the attrac-
tiveness of
surroundings
which other-
wise would
be monoton-
ous and un-
interesting in
character.
The Cam-
booya Shire,
which was
declared a
local author-
ity on June
4, 1914, has
an area of
180 square
miles and an estimated population of 800 persons,
together with 160 occupied dwellings.
The soil throughout the neighbourhood is typical
of what goes to make up the good farming land of the
Darling Downs generally, the plains consisting of rich
black earth, which is heavily carpeted with highly
nutritious grasses. No more magnificent dairying or
fattening country could be found in Australia than
what this is. The average annual rainfall runs to
between 20 and 30 inches. Were the soil only less
porous drought would not visit this region, for in the
worst season the rain is plentiful enough to equal what
will ensure an excellent growth of pasturage and
crops in most of the States of the Australian
Commonwealth.


WILLIAM BEBBINGTON, J.P.,
M.L.A., representing Drayton dis-
trict in the House of Assembly, was
born at Baschurch, County of Shrop-
shire, England, on October 19, 1856.
His father, the late Thomas Bebbing-
ton, was descended from a long line
of farmer-soldiers, his father before
him having fought at the famous
Battle of Waterloo. Young Bebbing-
ton received his education in his
native town, and on leaving school
worked on his father’s farm until
reaching man’s estate, when he tired
of the cramped existence of the
fields, and decided to seek experience
in other walks of life. In fulfilment
of his desire he joined the service of
the great Midland Railway Com-
pany, in the shipping department,
where he soon gained an insight
into the vast possibilities of the
oversea dominions of the British
Empire. Being of an ambitious
frame of mind, and desirous of
making his mark in the world, he
resigned from the company, and set
out for Queensland, being attracted
to the colony by the land laws then
in vogue, which after deep study he
considered to be the most liberal
the world over. For a time subse-
quent to his arrival in northern
fields, conditions were not of the
brightest hue, and Mr. Bebbington
devoted his time to commercial work
at Toowoomba, where for seven
years he was well and favourably
known. Responding to the call of
the land, he entered into partnership

with his brother -in - law, Mr.
John Jones, a farm being secured
at Rosalie Plains, in the vicinity of
Jondaryan township, which was
devoted to dairy farming. Later a
cheese factory was added to their
enterprise, this being the first fac-
tory west of the range to purchase
supplies of milk from the surround-
ing farmers, as it was also the

pioneer establishment to send locally-
made cheese to the markets north
of the Queensland metropolis. After
seven years a dissolution of partner-
ship was brought about, and Mr.
Bebbington applied himself to the
development of a property he had
purchased in the vicinity of Green-
mount. Ultimately the place proved
, to be too small as an outlet for his
energies, and disposing of it, he
purchased his present estate, "Mount
View,” at Ramsay, Cambooya. The
property comprises 800 acres, and
is devoted principally to dairy
farming, the milk from the herd
finding its way to the factory
to be turned into cheese. Apart
from the farm, Mr. Bebbington has
interests in half a dozen co-operative
cheese factories on the Downs, and
he is a member of the board of
directors of two of these institutions.
The industry has always occupied a
large share of his time, and he was
the first president of the Queensland
Cheese Manufacturers’ Association,
which now controls the destinies of
over 50 factories in the State. In
the midst of his private interests
Mr. Bebbington has found time to
devote to the furtherance of the
public welfare, and has always
fought strenuously to improve exist-
ing conditions, especially when the
interests of the farming community
are at stake. He has ever been a
strong advocate for the improvement
of educational facilities in the
country districts, and was a promi-
nent unit in the fight to obtain
conditions of entry into the Univer-
sity of Queensland for every youth
displaying ability above the average.
Mr. Bebbington’s services in this
and other directions were recognized
by his fellow-electors in 1912, when
an influential deputation requested
him to contest the Drayton seat in
the Legislative Assembly, a request
to which he acceded, and at the
ensuing elections he was returned at
the head of the poll witb a substan-
tial majority of close on 1,000 votes
over his two opponents. He was
re-elected for a further term in
1915, beating his opponent by
a margin of two votes to one,
and again in 1918. He was
gazetted a Justice of the Peace by
the Denham Administration in 1912.
Mr. Bebbington is a progressive
man, and gives his ready support to
all measures which in his opinion
will be of present and lasting benefit
to the community in general. Special
mention must be made of the
important part played by him in the
development of the sub-artesian
water areas of Central Queensland.
The pioneer in this great work, Mr.
Bebbington travelled thousands of
miles in the interior, selecting suit-
able sites for the sinking of bores,
the waters of which have doubled the
stock-carrying capacity of the land,
and added materially to the prosper-
ity of the great pastoral industry of
the State. Married in 1881 to Amelia ,
daughter of the late Thomas Jones,
of Walford, Baschurch, England,
Mr. Bebbington has a family of two
sons and three daughters.

PATRICK JOSEPH O’KEEFE,
J.P., of “Mount Prosper,” Ramsay,
Cambooya, is a son of Mr, Patrick
O’Keefe, a native of County Kerry,
Ireland, and grandson of the late
Daniel O’Keefe, who followed the
occupation of an agriculturist in the
same county. Mr. Patrick O’Keefe,
sen., was born in September, 1841,
and at an early age lent his aid in
the working of the home farm until
the demise of his parent, when he
went to County Cork, where for a
few years he continued his career
as a farmer. In the sixties he took
to himself a wife in the person of
Hannah, daughter of the late John
Hennessy, of Newmarket, County
Cork, Ireland, and some few months
after this event had been solemnized
decided to leave the land of his birth
for the distant fields of Australia.
Mr. O’Keefe had long pondered this
move, and his decision was not
arrived at without the maturist con-
sideration. He secured berths for
himself and his young wife in the
good ship “Flying Cloud,” bound
for Moreton Bay, which port was
reached on March 13, 1865, after
13 weeks spent on the heaving bosom
of the mighty deep. The vessel
carried a large number of passengers,

perity has since been reared. Mr.
O’Keefe was most fortunate in the
choice of the lady who was to share

his lot through life, and of all the
good fortune which came to him in
after years none compared with that
which brought to his side such
he worked manfully on, little antici-
pating the large measure of success
with which his labours were eventu-
ally to be crowned. In the land of
his adoption he naturally turned to
his old occupation of agriculturist,
the industry then being in its
earliest infancy, as a means of
obtaining subsistence, but the pre-
vailing depression at that time made
difficult the task of securing a
situation, and he was finally com-
pelled to accept a job at the magnifi-
cent remuneration of 11s. a week.
Needless to say, the dauntless spirit
which had impelled him to forsake
the comparative comfort of the land
of his birth and cross the ocean did
not remain passive under this exist-
ing state of affairs for any length of
time, and within a very little while
he secured a job on the railway line,
then stretching its sinuous length in
a westerly direction from the town
of Ipswich. He continued at this
work for a couple of years, during
which time he saved sufficient of his
earnings to enable him to take up a
small holding at Gowrie Creek, near
Toowoomba, and here it may be said
that he commenced his long and
honourable career as a farmer in
Queensland, a career which has been

property at Gowrie Creek in 1876, so
that he could give the whole of his
time to the new holding, which then
embraced an area of 640 acres of
virgin country. Bestowing upon it
the name of “Mount Prosper,”
happily prophetic in its divination,
he set to work to cultivate and
improve the property, adding to its
boundaries from time to time as
opportunity offered, so that when
the management was transferred to
his second son in later years the area
had been increased to close on 3,000
acres, all of which is freehold. The
farm is conducted on the most
up-to-date lines, and is looked upon
as one of the show places of the
Downs. He personally conducted
“Mount Prosper” until his second
son reached man’s estate, when he
handed over the reins of control,
retiring altogether from active par-
ticipation in the management of the
estate in 1910. Mr. O’Keefe holds
considerable real estate at Too-
woomba and Cambooya. At no time
has he taken an active part in the
local affairs of the district, the one
exception to this rule being the
ready support he has accorded to the
Roman Catholic Church, of which
he is a staunch adherent. The erec-
tion of the churches at Greenmount
and Cambooya was largely due to
his financial and moral support, and
his generosity in this direction has

PATRICK FORD BENN, of
“Newbury," Cambooya, is a Vic-
torian by birth, having first seen
the light of day at Merino, in the
western district of that State, on
August 27, 1868. He is a son of the
late William Crawford Benn, of
Ireland, who left his native land
in the year 1852 to take up his
residence within the confines of Aus-
tralia, selecting Victoria as his place
of abode. The family of Benn has
been engaged in the milling trade
in Ireland for many generations,
and far away in the distant past
established “Newbury” mill, a con-
spicuous landmark on the banks of
the Blackwater River in the County
of Cork, while on the maternal side
the name of Ford is almost as old
as Cork itself. The late gentleman
followed the occupation of agricul-
turist, and for a span of 17 years
tilled the soil in the fertile western
district of the “Garden State,"
afterwards taking up land in Gipps-
land, where he spent a further 13
years in pioneering work, cheerfully
undergoing the many hardships and
privations whicli fell to the lot of
the hardy spirits who, leaving the
comforts of the more settled parts,
went forth to blaze the trail and
conjunction with his younger brother
Charles, continued the development
of the Gippsland property until the

partnership was effected, Charles

tinued operations on his own account
until 1905, when, attracted by the
bright outlook in Queensland, he
“Eton Vale” Estate, and when taken
over by Mr. Benn was in an unde-
veloped state, nothing having been
added in the way of improvements.
The years that have since passed
have wrought a wonderful transfor-
mation, and to-day “Newbury" is
considered to be one of the best
developed farms in the district. The
land is devoted chiefly to grazing
and mixed farming, but a fair
quantity of wheat is grown and a
number of horses bred each year.
He gained a valuable insight into
farming methods during his resi-
dence in Victoria, and this experi-
ence has proved of great use to him
since coming to Queensland. He has
also had several years’ experience of
mining, being one of those who took
part in the first rush to the Murchi-
son Goldfields in the sister State of
Western Australia. While Mr.
Benn has not figured prominently
in matters of public interest in the
different districts in which he has
resided, he has always accorded his
liberal support to every movement
of a progressive nature, and his
kindly disposition and unswerving
integrity have gained for him the
appreciation of a large number of
friends. He was married in 1899 to

chasing his present estate, to which
he gave the name of “Newbury.”
The property, which comprises 750
acres, originally formed part of the

Charlton, one of the pioneer farmers
of Victoria, but formerly of Ireland,
and has a family of four sons and
five daughters.


JAMES WILLIAM PATRICK
McINTOSH, J.P., of "Moyhall,”
Cambooya, was born at Blacktown,
Sydney, New South Wales, on
March 17, 1867, being a son of the
late William Mclntosh, who emi-
grated from Scotland in 1852, and
found employment as an orchardist
on the Parramatta River, in the
Mother State. Subsequently he
joined in the rush to the Omeo
diggings in Victoria, but Dame
Fortune withheld her smile, and
before long he relinquished the dis-
heartening search for the golden
gleam, and made his departure for
Queensland. This was in the early
fifties, and in his new surroundings
he found employment at railway
construction work, at a time when
pay for ordinary labour was at the
rate of ,£1 per day. After a sojourn
of 10 years in this part of the conti-
nent he returned to Scotland, taking
with him his family, and remained
for four years, when the call of
Australia proved irresistible, and he
returned to the land of the Southern
Cross. Queensland was his destina-
tion, and soon after arrival he
entered the Railways Department, in
which service he continued for over a
quarter of a century. In the autumn
of his life he lived in retirement with
the subject of our review, until the
time of his death in the year 1890.
Young Mclntosh was educated at

School, Toowoomba, conducted by

his seventeenth year hie scholastic
career came to an end, and after a
period spent under the parental

of his sire, he turned his attention
to the land, acquiring areas in

trict, which were chiefly devoted to

farming pursuits. These avocations
he has continued to follow, his
operations including the raising of
fat lambs for home consumption,
dairying, and mixed farming. Mr.
Mclntosh is fortunate in possessing
several rich patches of land, only
found at intervals throughout
the Downs country, which prove
specially adapted to the growth of
lucerne, producing heavy crops of
this fodder, on which the cattle
thrive so well. From early manhood
Mr. Mclntosh has taken a live
interest in the affairs of the Cam-
booya district, being one of the
oldest residents of the town, the
growth of which he has watched
since its beginning as a tiny settle-
ment of three small humpies to the
flourishing centre it is to-day. For
14 years he filled the office of honor-
ary secretary to the local school, and
during that time no effort was
lacking in his endeavours to improve
the educational facilities enjoyed by
the youth of the district. He is one
of the founders of the Cambooya
Dairy Company and the Felton
Cheese Factory, a branch of the
former concern, and he has figured
prominently in all agitations having
as their object the advancement of
the town and district. Much credit
is due to him for securing to the
residents the local recreation reserve,
which has proved a great boon,
being continually in use for sports
and other purposes. For more than
20 years Mr. Mclntosh has served
on the Commission of the Peace, and
holds the distinction of being the
first Justice created in the district.
He is a member of the Masonic
fraternity, being a past master of
the craft, and when the initial lodge
was created at Cambooya he became
its first master. The local race club
was fortunate in securing his ser-
vices as honorary secretary for many
years, and his patronage is gener-
ously accorded to all forms of sport
the conduct of which is beyond
criticism. His help in sweet charity’s
cause is always readily forthcoming,
and is a big factor in bringing
about the success of every movement
to raise funds in support of benevo-
lent objects. Mr. Mclntosh freely
devotes his time to, furthering the
public good, and his generous efforts
in this direction, coupled with his
unassuming character, have gained
for him the respect and esteem of the
whole community.
ANDREW PURCELL was born
on June 5, in the year 1846, at
Drumbane Parish, County Tipperary,
Ireland, and is a son of the late
James Purcell, of that place. He is
a descendant of a well-known family
of Purcells, dating back to a very
early period, and prominent in his-
torical events of national importance
in England and Ireland. Perusing
the records of the “Journal of the
Royal Historical and Archaeological
Association of Ireland,” published in
1885, on page 432 we learn that the


ancestors of the present Purcell
family first appear in the annals of
history in Normandy in 1035.
According to tradition, Sir Hugh

the Conqueror in the invasion of
Britain, was the first to set foot on
English soil, and led the way in
exploits of valour by storming the
ruins of an old Roman castle where
a part of Harold’s army was en-
trenched. He was rewarded
by William with a grant of
land, and founded a baronial
family, the members of
which became hereditary
ushers to the King’s Cham-
berlain, and held lands by
tenure of office which con-
tinued in a direct line for
more than 100 years.
Through the records we
learn of another Sir Hugh
Purcell, who took part in
the invasion of Ireland by
England in 1171, and
proved to be the unnamed
knight mentioned by Ger-
aldus Cambrensis as slain at
Waterford. The succeeding
Sir Hugh Purcell founded
the House of “Loughman,”
which achieved historic em-
inence, and continued in the
male line down to the 18th
century, and it is through
the Barons of Loughma, or
“Loughmoe,” as it is some-
times written, that the family traces
its ancestry. The Purcells were pro-
minent in the time of Cromwell, and
during the reign of James 11. In
His original holding embraced some
320 acres, which he worked with
such success that within a very few
years a large number of farmers had
been attracted to the district. At

that time farming was in its earliest

himself hardly anticipated the large
measure of success which fell to his
share. As time went on, Mr. A.

to-day “Loughma” represents an
area of about 1,300 acres, most of
which is devoted to dairying and
mixed farming. Three of his sons
1691 one of them became a signatory
to the famous Treaty of Limerick.
Offshoots of the family also flourished
in various parts of England down
to the 17th century. Mr. Andrew
Purcell set sail for Australia in his
seventeenth year, reaching Sydney
on March 24, 1863. Pie worked in
various parts until the discovery of
gold at Gympie, when he joined in
the general rush to Queensland.
After “trying his luck” on the
diggings, he came to the Darling
Downs in 1870, and two years later
selected 320 acres of virgin bush in
the Ramsay district, and started
operations on his own account.
The property, which was called
“Loughma,” after the ancestral
home of the Purcells, “Loughma
Castle,” was steadily increased in
acreage as the years went by, and
to-day ranks among the best farms
in the district. At the time of
writing (1915) Mr. Purcell is living
in semi-retirement at the home of
one of his married daughters at
Clifton. He married, in 1872, Ellen,
daughter of Mr. William Fox, of
Drayton, Tipperary, Ireland, and
has four sons and four daughters.
ANDREW PATRICK PUR-
CELL, of “Loughma,” Ramsay,

to note that Mr. Andrew Purcell

youngest, Mr. A. P. Purcell, has

“Loughma,” he was educated locally,
later assisting his father to work
the property to which he afterwards
succeeded. Married in the year
1912, to Kathleen, daughter of Mr.

old Tipperary family which has had
its home near Thurles, Ireland, for

son of the late Thomas Wynne, who
accompanied by hie wife came from
Wales in the early days of the
settlement of Queensland, and took
up his residence on the Darling
Downs, where he found employment
as overseer on the old “Eton Vale”
Estate, soon after the property was
taken up as a pastoral holding.
Subsequently he leased a small area
of land at Woodlands, and engaged
in mixed farming, until such time
as he was able to take up and
develop country on his own account.

Mr. Wynne next secured a leasehold
of a portion of the “Eton Vale”
Station, and later when this pro-
perty was resumed by the Govern-
ment and thrown open for selection
he was successful in securing the
freehold of the land now comprising
“Wynneville Park.” He was a very
successful breeder of draught horses,
and his stock carried off many prizes
at the shows promoted by the Too-
woomba Royal Agricultural Society.
For several years he was a member
of the Clifton Shire Council, and
devoted a considerable portion of his
time to furthering the interests of
the community in which he resided.
Upon the death of his father,
“Wynneville Park” passed into the
hands of the present owner, who has
continued to develop the property
on the lines laid down by his parent
with the most satisfactory results.
Dairying, sheep raising, and cereal
culture form the chief departments
of Mr. Wynne’s industry, and by
applying the latest known methods
in the workings of the farm he has
brought it to a high pitch of
development. The subject of our
notice was educated at Cambooya,
and on leaving school went to work

sive knowledge of farming in its
varied branches. He takes an

HENRY NEALE, of "Alpine
Grange,” Ramsay, Cambooya, is the
third son of the late Henry Neale,
of Warwickshire, England, who
came out to Queensland in the first
sailing vessel to bring emigrants to
these shores, which reached its desti-
nation, Moreton Bay, in December
of the year 1848. In the mother-
land the late gentleman had fol-
lowed the trade of a weaver, but
under sunny Australian skies he
found a job as a station hand on
"Meringandan,” passing thence to
"Eton Vale” Station. Subsequently
he joined the Queensland Police,
resigning after several years’ service
in the force, and we next find him
holding a position on "Westbrook”
Station, where he was in charge of
sheep. In due time he took up his
residence at Drayton, where he
engaged in farming, also acting in
the genial role of boniface at the
Bull’s Head Hotel in that town.
Mr. Neale was survived by a
family of four sons and four
daughters. The subject of our
biography was born at "Meringan-
dan” on July 21, 1849, and received
his education at Drayton, under the
guidance of the late Mr. Rendall,
who at that time conducted the only
school on the Darling Downs, this
being prior to the foundation of the
township of Toowoomba. Leaving

school, he joined his father in
attending to the sheep on "West-
brook” Station, and while still in
his teens conducted a butchering
business for his parent during the
time the railway line was being
pushed out towards Dalby. When
his father took over the direction of
the Bull’s Head hostelry he came

to Drayton with him, and on his
own account opened a butchering
business, which he carried on until
the discovery of tin at Stanthorpe,
when both parent and son joined in
the rush to the new centre. Here
they set themselves to the task of
winning Dame Fortune’s smile, the
son labouring on the mines, while
the father established himself in
business in the immediate vicinity.
Their next move was to "Eton Vale”
Station, Mr. Henry Neale, jun.,
subsequently undertaking tlie role
of host of the Downs Hotel at
Drayton for a brief period. In
February, 1867, he turned his atten-
tion to farming in real earnest, and
with the object of settling down
once and for all he took up his
present holding, and out of the wild
bush he has carved a home for him-
self and his family in the years that
have since elapsed. The early days
were full of hardships and strenuous
work, calling for heavy sacrifices,
but with praiseworthy pluck and
endurance he proved himself worthy
to rank with the pioneers of the
period, and with the help of his
young wife, who bore her share of
the vicissitudes, he eventually won
through. The first few years were
particularly severe, as he had to
work at shearing, fencing, and other
bush occupations to gain sufficient
funds for the requirements of his
own home and family. The original
extent of Mr. Neale’s property was
640 acres, but to-day he owns almost
twice that area, most of which is
devoted to dairy farming, a small
portion only being cultivated. Of a
retiring disposition, Mr. Neale has
devoted his time to surmounting the
manifold difficulties inseparable to
his life’s occupation, and in the
autumn of his career he is content
to rest quietly on his labours in the
bosom of his family. He married in
1870, Kate, daughter of the late
Peter Tighe, of Sligo, Ireland, the
issue being four sons and two
daughters.
CHRISTIAN BARTH, of "Eton
Vale,” Cambooya, was born at
Amertsweiler, near Meinhardt, Ger-
many, on April 4, 1848, and is a
son of the late Jacob Barth, agricul-
turist, of that place. He left school
on entering his teens, and shortly
afterwards (about 1862), in company
with his sister, sailed for Queens-
land to join his maternal uncle, the
late Jacob Kircher, who was then
engaged in farming at Sandy Creek,
in the Warwick district, besides
which he was also interested in the
winemaking industry, the products
from his cellars gaining notice for
their excellence and purity. He died
in the year 1903. Soon after his


arrival in the State, the subject of
our review was apprenticed to the
late J. J. Kingsford, of Warwick,
and on the completion of his inden-
tures spent a short time with his
uncle, afterwards going into the
bush, where he worked at anything
he could find to do, undergoing
many privations, and becoming
inured to the hardships which always
fall to the lot of the pioneer in a
new country. During several years
of hard toil, Mr. Barth gained much
valuable experience, which in later
times was to stand him in good
stead in his efforts to carve out a
home for himself and his family.
Upon attaining man’s estate he
forsook bush life, and returned to
Warwick, where, under the late W.
Stephens, Toowoomba

Kluge, he learnt the trade of a
saddler and harness-maker, remain-
ing in this employ until 1870, by
which time he had thoroughly mas-
tered the intricacies of the trade.
He then purchased the business
carried on by Mr. Peter Hoffman,
and successfully conducted it until
1907, when he disposed of it as a
going concern, having decided to
spend the autumn of his days in the
role of farmer. At this time the
well-known "Eton Vale” Estate
(originally taken up by Sir Arthur
Hodgson) was being cut up and sold
for closer settlement purposes, and
Mr. Barth became the purchaser of
that portion immediately surround-
ing the old homestead, notable in
the annals of early Queensland.
Prior to this he had owned “Fair-
view,” a farm of about 1,000 acres,
in the Clifton district, but this land
he sold upon taking up his abode at

“Eton Vale.” Originally Mr. Barth’s
purchase embraced 4,000 acres, which
with stock, plant, etc., was valued at
£30,000, but a succession of bad
seasons caused him to sell all but
1,500 acres, which now represents
the area of his farm, and is devoted
to mixed farming, sheep raising, and
the growth of cereals. By his indus-
try and perseverance he has achieved
well-merited success, and during his
long residence on the Downs his
unswerving integrity has gained for
him the universal respect of the
whole community. Mr. Barth is
loud in his praises of the treatment
accorded him by the authorities in
the land of hie adoption, and the
freedom he has enjoyed under the
aegis of the flag of Britain, and is
proud of the opportunity to place on
record his loyalty and that of his
family to the British throne. He
was married in 1877, to Mary,

pursuits in Brisbane, one follows the
profession of a dentist, and four

EDWARD FITZGERALD, J.P.,
of "Kilbrittain,” Felton, Darling
Downs, was born in the parish of
Kilbrittain, County Cork, Ireland,
on May 26, 1870, and is the eldest
son of the late James Fitzgerald,
who was a member of a family of
farmers in the south of Ireland of
over a century’s standing. Educated
at the national school at Granasog,
County Cork, at the age of 15 years
young Fitzgerald, owing to the death
of his father, had to relinquish his
scholastic career and take up the
serious task of supervising the work-
ing of the home farm, in which
occupation he continued until he
had almost reached man’s estate,
when he handed over the reins of
management to his younger brothers,
having decided to seek his fortune
under the blue skies of Australia,
the romance of which land had long
been in his mind and taken a firm
hold of his Celtic temperament. The
year 1891 witnessed his arrival in
Queensland, to which State he came
direct, and his first employment was
in connection with the construction
of the north coast railway line in
the survey branch of the service.
On the completion of this under-
taking he was employed on the
excavation work of the Government
dam at Grandchester, after which
he once again turned his attention
to farming, taking up a block of 40
acres near the township of Allora,
on the Southern Downs. Later on
he sold this holding, and purchased
150 acres on the “Glengallan”
Estate, but in less than a decade
his growing family compelled him
to seek a larger area, and in
1913 he secured his present farm,
the boundaries of which enclose
about 500 acres of splendid land,
which is devoted to mixed farming,
dairying, and the cultivation of

cereals. Public matters have not
been neglected by Mr. Fitzgerald,
and on the inception of the Cam-
booya Shire Council he was a candi-
date for the suffrages of the rate-
payers, gaining the distinction of
being returned at the head of the
poll. He organized the Felton
branch of the Cambooya Dairying
Company, and in a general way has
always worked enthusiastically to
further the interests of the district,
lie was gazetted to the Commission
of the Peace for the Allora district
by the Kidston Cabinet, and is a
prominent member of the Hibernian
brotherhood, having held the office
of district president of the Southern
District of Queensland. He was
married in 1891, to Mary, daughter
of the late Denis O’Sullivan, of Kil-
brittain, Ireland, and has six sons
and three daughters.
PATRICK TIGHE, of "Oak-
dene,” Ramsay, Cambooya, is a son
of the late Peter Tighe, who came
to Queensland from Sligo, Ireland,
in the early days of the State. A
family of three sons and five
daughters survived the late gentle-
man, all of whom, with the excep-
tion of the subject of our review,
and one sister (head teacher in
Brisbane), have married and settled
down in various parts of Queens-
land. Mr. Patrick Tighe was born
at Yandilla on June 26, 1859, and
received his education at the Drayton
State School. He was apprenticed
to the trade of a saddler and harness
maker, and on completing his time
removed to Charters Towers, where
he worked at his calling for a brief
period. After a sojourn in Sydney
he returned to his native State, and
once more took up the tools of his
trade in the Lower Burdekin district.

GENERAL VIEW OF "OAKDENE,” THE PROPERTY OF MR. P. TIGHE, RAMSAY, CAMBOOYA.


In 1900 he purchased his present
farm, “Oakdene,” comprising 1,160
acres of land, and turned his atten-
tion to mixed farming, dairying
being the principal feature of his
industry. “Oakdene” is charmingly
located, and has been brought to a
high pitch of development by its
owner. It is well grassed and plenti-
fully watered, and a comfortable
homestead with its accompanying
outbuildings tends to improve the
natural beauty of the locality. Mr.
Tighe turns to the “sport of Kings”
for his recreation, and has been
successful in winning several events
at the local race meetings. He breeds
a number of horses of good stamp
for sporting purposes and for use in
the work of the estate.
WILLIAM AUBREY SHEIL,
J.P., proprietor of “Felton” Home-
stead, via Cambooya, is a native of
New South Wales, having been born
at Wilton, near Picton, in that
State, on November 14, 1862. He
is the fourth son of the late Francis
Sheil, who was amongst the first
white children to be born in the
early settlement of the Mother
State. In after years he elected to
follow grazing pursuits, and for over
HON. JAMES TYSON.
25 years he was a well-known
farmer and grazier in the Picton
district. Shortly after the death of
Mr. Sheil, which event occurred in
1890, the property passed into the
hands of the Hordern family, but
the old home at Wilton is still
retained by the Sheil descend-
ants. The late gentleman was

all with whom he came into con-
tact, and his passing was regretted
by the whole community. A family
of six sons and three daughters sur-
vived him. Mr. W. A. Sheiks
mother was a niece of the late Hon.
James Tyson, and historic interest
demands for her a place, not only
in the annals of the family to which
she linked herself by marriage, but
also in any reference to the commu-
nity of which she formed a unit.
She inherited a goodly fortune from
her uncle at the time of his death,
and following the impulses of a
generous and conscientious nature
at once set herself to the task of
applying a large portion of her
income to works of a charitable and
religious character. Mrs. Sheil con-
tributed largely to the support of
the local Roman Catholic Church,
and the residents of the Picton dis-
trict possess a standing memorial of
the spirit which animated her life
in the beautiful edifice for worship
which she had erected entirely at her
own expense; besides which her
purse was ever open to the calls of
the various benevolent organizations
of the district. The subject of our
biography, Mr. W. A. Sheil,
received his education principally at
the Wilton local school, and at the
close of his scholastic studies set to
work to acquire a thorough know-
ledge of the various branches of
farming under the guidance of his
sire. For a number of years he
assisted in the working of the home
farm, some little time before attain-
ing his majority undertaking a
journey to Queensland, where he
found employment as a general hand
on “Brookstead” Station, the pro-
perty of his uncle, Mr. John Tyson
Doneley. After a brief sojourn in
the Northern State he decided to
return to the parental roof, where
he remained until attaining man’s
estate. In the year 1899 he once
again set out for Queensland, this
time to take over the management
of “Wyobie” Station, which then
formed part of the estate of his
grand-uncle, the late Hon. James
Tyson. Ultimately the direction of
the station passed into the hands of
a brother, and Mr. Sheil returned
to New South Wales. Shortly after-
wards he took to himself a wife, and
it now behoved him to establish a
home and settle down to the new
state of life. Accordingly he pur-
chased a part of the old “Gowrie”
Estate, to which he gave the name
of “Wilton Park,” and until 1911
he continued to work and develop

decided to acquire it, and towards
the end of the same year entered
into possession of the estate. “Fel-
ton” was the original home of the
late Mr. Tyson, who despite all his
peregrinations through the various
States always remained loyal to the
old home, from which many of his
early and most important pastoral
transactions were successfully engi-
neered. The property now comprises
some 3,200 acres freehold, this area
being retained, together with the old
homestead when the larger estate
was subdivided for purposes of closer
settlement. Under the new regime
The homestead is one of the most
comfortable on the Darling Downs.
It is raised from the ground about
six feet, being supported by substan-
tial ironbark blocks, which have with-
stood the elements for 25 years, and
are as sound to-day as when they
were first sunk in the ground. The
residence contains 10 large rooms,
offices, etc., and is enclosed by a
wide verandah, which provides wel-
come shade all the year round. The

a consistent supporter of the "sport
of Kings,” and many of his candi-
dates have placed winning brackets
to his credit on the Queensland
turf. With "Oak Grafton” he won
the classic St. Leger in 1906, and in
association with his brother, Mr. D.
Sheil, he has captured many
important events, principally with
“Euroa,” this horse having won the
Autumn Stakes, the Guineas, and
the Queensland Derby, the blue
ribbon of the turf. Mr. Sheil has
held the Commission of the Peace
for nearly a decade, having been

Administration. He was married in

an energetic policy of development
was inaugurated, and great improve-
ments have been the result. Graz-
ing and the cultivation of cereals
are the principal features of Mr.
Sheil’s industry, and about 500 acres
are put under crop each year. The
soil at "Felton” is of the black
variety, well mixed with a sandy
loam rich in the constituents neces-
sary to the successful production of
wheat and crops of a similar nature.
A flock of sheep is also in evidence,
and these are principally raised for
the mutton market and for supply-
ing the local demand for lambs.

Mention must also be made of the
several outbuildings which although
erected many years ago are still
abreast of the times. The appoint-
ments of the shearing-shed are second
to none on the Downs, while the
woolshed erected by the late Mr.
Tyson before the property was cut
up provides more than ample
space for present-day requirements.

GEORGE FRANCIS BRIDG-
MAN, of “Cowarrie,” Southbrook.
Darling Downs, is a son of the late
George Bridgman, who practised law
at Dartmouth, Devonshire, nearly a
century ago. In that town the
gentleman under review was born
in the year 1842, and received his
education at the Exeter Grammar
School. At the termination of his


school-days he emigrated to New
South Wales, where his relative, the
late Mr. E. B. Cornish, was well
known as one of the leading pastoral-
ists on the Macquarie River. After
about four years in that district he
collected a large flock of sheep for
his employers, and starting from
Monaro, near the Snowy River,
overlanded them in company with
the late Isaac Aaron, arriving safely
at Fort Cooper, in Northern Queens-
land, in July, 1862. In 1864 he
took over the management of the
"Fort Cooper” Station, in which
position he remained until 1870,
when he moved to Homebush, near
Mackay, where some years later he
arranged the sale of the property
to the Colonial Sugar Refinery Co.,
and the now well-known Homebush
sugar .mill was erected on the land.
In 1874 Mr. Bridgman took charge
of the Aboriginal Reserve, near
Mackay, and for some time acted as
official interpreter for the Govern-
ment in North Queensland, where
he has made a close study of the
Australian aboriginal race, their
totems, habits, and language. In
the year 1880 he returned to his
native land, and after 12 months
spent among the scenes of his boy-
hood days, during which period he

on until 1907, when the pastoral
properties were disposed of, and the
sugar enterprise turned into a com-
pany, Mr. Bridgman becoming for
a time one of the directors of the
which he early became associated.
In 1907 he left Mackay, and took up
his residence at Brisbane, the follow-
ing year purchasing a portion of the
"Harrow” Estate, on the Darling
Downs, 20 miles from Toowoomba,
and five from the Southbrook rail-
way station, where, after erecting
the necessary buildings, he started
mixed farming, later taking two of
his sons into partnership. Mrs.
Bridgman was the widow of the late
John Paget, of "Nindaroo,” Mac-
kay, elder brother of the Hon. W. T.
Paget, one time Minister for Rail-
ways. By her first husband she had
one son, WalterG. Paget, who follows
the medical profession at Croydon,
England, and is captain-surgeon in
the King’s Surrey Territorials. By
her present husband she has one
daughter, the wife of Mr. A. N.
Templeton, of “Acacia Downs,”
Central West Queensland, and four
sons, of whom Mr. T. E. Bridgman
practises law at Mitchell, while Dr.
R. C. Bridgman is practising at
Pittsworth, after having spent some
time on active service, prior to which
he was house surgeon at the Too-
woomba Hospital (1915). Another
son, Captain P. H. Bridgman, was
killed at Messines, France, in 1917.

FRANCIS PRENTICE, J.P., of
Prestbury/ Southbrook, was born
at Prestbury, near Cheltenham,
Gloucestershire, England, onApril 7,
1872, being the second son of the
late George Seward Prentice, a
descendant of one of the oldest
lamilies in the abovenamed county.
Our subject was educated chiefly at
Cheltenham College, at the termi-
nation of his scholastic career
becoming articled to a firm of
London stockbrokers, in whose ser-
vice he remained for some two years.
In the year 1889 he took passage to
Australia, landing in New South
Wales, where he joined the staff of
the Australian Joint Stock Bank,
remaining in that institution for
four years. Resigning from this
office he turned his attention to
the land on the most approved
methods. “Prestbury” is situated in
the East Felton district, being about
six miles distant from Southbrook,
and 10 from Cambooya township.
The property is regarded as one of
the premier farms on the Downs,
and its orderly appearance reflects
great credit on the proprietor. The
homestead, built in 1908, is a com-
modious dwelling, designed on bun-
galow lines, with a wide verandah
running round the four sides of the
house. The rooms are large and
airy, and there is a tastefully laid
out flower garden which lends an
added charm to the general beauty
of the surroundings. Mrs. Prentice
is an enthusiastic floriculturist, and
whiles away many a pleasant hour
cultivating the plants which in due

acres are cultivated for the fatten-
ing of stock, and an additional area
is cropped with cereals, principally
wheat. A small herd of cattle is
also grazed over the property, and
each year a number of horses of the
Clydesdale strain are bred, these
being required to replace the older
horses worn out by years of honest
toil in the service of their master.
About 50 horses are employed in the
working of the estate, which is
being rapidly improved, and at the
present rate of progress it will soon
take rank as the premier farm for
its size on the Downs. Mr. Prentice

thering the interests of the district

Station, near Adelong, • where he
spent some time mastering the details
of the various branches of the pastoral
industry. Subsequently he became
overseer on “Coree” Station, where
he remained until 1904, in which
year he took charge of a mob of
13,000 sheep, overlanding them to
“Felton,” on the Darling Downs,
then the property of Mr. I. M.
Greenaway. Arrived at “Felton,” he
took over the management of the
property, which he retained until
he was offered the post of manager
of Messrs. McPhie & Company’s
branch business at Charleville. In
1908 he entered into possession of
his present estate, and ever since has

prodigal display of blooms. At the
rear of the house is the kitchen
garden, which provides a plentiful
supply of vegetables for table use.
The area of “Prestbury” runs into
some 2,600 acres, which have been
subdivided into 30 paddocks of
convenient dimensions, all securely
fenced. Mixed farming is the chief
department of industry on the farm,
the item next in importance being
the raising of fat lambs for the
English and Continental markets.
The flock consists of about 3,000
crossbreds, Mr. Prentice favouring
this type of animal for his purposes.

mission of the Peace, to which
office he was gazetted by the Den-
ham Cabinet. He is the founder
and captain of the Southbrook Rifle
Club, which has its practice range on
portion of the “Prestbury” Estate.
He is also one of the founders of
the Cowarrie Cheese Factory, and
one of the present directors of that
concern. He was married in 1906,
to Cecily Wadham, third daughter
of Mr. I. M. Greenaway, of New'
Zealand, who took up his residence
in Queensland in 1900, and is now 7
largely interested in the pastoral
industry of the State. The family
consists of four sons.


WALTER JACKSON, of "Lis-
holm” Farm, Nobby, was born at
Gresborough, Yorkshire, England,
on September 10, 1846, being a son
of the late Thomas Jackson, farmer-
miller, of the same place. Mr.
Walter Jackson comes of a family
of ancient lineage, which for genera-
tions past has tilled the soil in the
County of Yorkshire. He received
his elementary training at a board-
ing-school at Worksop, afterwards
completing his studies at the Rother-
ham Grammar School. He com-
menced his commercial career in the
service of the Midland Railway
Company, copying specifications,
etc., in the waggon-building depart-
ment, in his sixteenth year accom-
panying his parents to Australia, in
which country they had decided to
settle. The family reached Brisbane
in September, 1862, and proceeded
to Warwick, where Mr. Jackson
sen., selected a block of land some
six miles distant from the town-
ship. This holding proved unsuited
to the cultivation of wheat, mainly
owing to the presence of rust, and so
it was abandoned. Mr. Jackson next
proceeded to “Glengallan,” where
he entered into a contract to sow
300 acres of lucerne, the conditions
being that he should receive the
proceeds derived from the area for
a period of three years. This specu-
lation fulfilled, he proceeded to the
Clifton district, where he purchased

the property known as "Prairie
Lawn,” comprising some 360 acres of
land. In 1878 the Jackson family
moved into its new home, which,
as time proved, was to claim
attention for many years to come.
Their plant included a waggon,
eight horses, and three single furrow
ploughs, with which they entered
upon mixed farming, and it was not

long before they had established the
industry on a profitable basis. As
time went on several adjoining pro-
perties were purchased, until the
area had been increased to 1,500
acres in all. A plentiful supply of
water was obtained by sinking three
bores, over which windmills were
erected, supplies from this source
being supplemented by water drawn

from a well, also fitted with a wind-
mill. It is interesting to record that
in the seventies Mr. Jackson gar-
nered a crop of 17 bales of cotton,
each weighing from 20 to 22 cwt.,
which he carted to Ipswich, and sold
to the ginning mills at that centre.
The raising of well-bred stock has
always been included in his farming
operations, special attention being
given to the breeding of shorthorn
cattle of a good type, of Clydesdales,
and ponies of the Welsh strain, and
many examples of the latter sturdy
little animal are to be found in and
around the Nobby district. The
breeding of sheep is another depart-
ment of industry, merino ewes being
mated with Shropshire rams, this
cross having proved the most satis-
factory for the production of fat
lambs for the export trade. A
certain area is devoted to the culti-
vation of cereals, and the returns
from this source have been well up
to expectations. Mr. Jackson dis-
posed of "Prairie Lawn” some few
years ago, and entered into posses-
sion of "Lisholm” Farm, where he
now resides. The property comprises
700 acres, subdivided into 15 pad-
docks of convenient dimensions, the
whole being securely fenced and
rendered sheep-proof by the aid of
wirenetting. The homestead, a very
fine building, is nearly lost to view
in an extensive clump of pine and
pepperina trees, the shade ' from
which provides welcome shelter from
the sweltering heat, and brings
about an appreciable diminution in
the degree of temperature. The
dwelling contains eight lofty and
well-ventilated rooms, be-
sides several rooms of lesser
proportions, and the pre-
sence of an orchard contain-
ing a variety of fruit trees,
vines, etc., adds a pleasant
touch to the natural charm
of the locality. Situated
some distance away from
the homestead are several
substantially - constructed
hay sheds, barns, and other
utility buildings for the
housing of the stock and
plant used on the farm.
Mr. Jackson has spent the
greater part of his life in
active pioneering work on
the Downs, and no history
of the progress of Southern
Queensland would be com-
plete did it fail to include
his name as one of those who
have rendered yeoman ser-
vice on behalf of the country
of his adoption. He married Eliza-
beth, daughter of the late Henry
Muller, of Schleswig-Holstein, Ger-
many, and has a family of two sons
and three daughters.


The late GEORGE FREE, foun-
der of “Rose Valley” Farm, in the
Nobby district, came to Australia
from Cambridge, Essex, England,
about the middle of the nineteenth

century, having sprung from a race
of tillers of the soil in that county.
Upon arrival, landing at Brisbane,
he proceeded direct to Warwick, and
after sojourning in that district for
some considerable time journeyed to
Clifton, where he took up 311 acres
of land, in the year 1878. To this
property, which was destined to
become the home of his family, he
gave the name of “Rose Valley,”
and entered upon mixed farming
operations, in which dairying
formed an important part. After
continuing on the original area for

about 10 years, additions were made
to the acreage by purchase of adjoin-
ing holdings, and the farm eventu-
ally was enlarged to 1,500 acres. At
an early period the late Mr. Free
turned hie attention to wheatgrow-
ing, but on account of the prevalence
of rust, the modern means of com-
bating which were then unknown, not
much success attended hie efforts in
this direction. He did pioneering
work of value in what was then
known as the Clifton shire (this now
being included in the Nobby dis-
trict), and witnessed various changes
in the locality, one in nomenclature
being the substitution of King Creek
for Tank House Siding, as the
nearest railway stopping place was
then called. As one of the fathers
of the district he will long be
remembered, and so long as "Rose
Valley” continues to hold its own as
one of the prosperous farmsteads of
the neighbourhood, tales of the
“early days,” in which he played an
active part, will be recounted to the
eager ears of succeeding generations.
Subsequent to Mr. Free’s death, on
July 19, 1903, the property was
divided between his sons, who are
following in their father’s footsteps
in the farming industry on various
holdings about Nobby and the sur-
rounding districts. His widow, Mrs.
S. J. Free, is still living in retire-
ment at "Rose Valley.”
GEORGE ELI FREE, “Waldon”
Farm, Nobby, is the eldest son
of the late George Free, and
was born in the district where he
now resides on October 31, 1874.
Educated at the local school, he
relinquished his studies at 15 years
of age, and for some little time
assisted his father on the "Rose
Valley” Farm, where the family
resided. Whilst gaining useful
knowledge in agriculture and pas-
toral affairs, his natural turn for
mechanics asserted itself so strongly
as not to be gainsaid, and not
finding sufficient scope for his gifts
in this direction in the limited
sphere where his days were spent, at
25 he struck out for himself, and
entered the employ of Messrs.
Stephens, Toowoomba.
MR. GEORGE ELI FREE.
McLellan & Co., of Brisbane, after
12 months joining the firm of
Messrs. Brown & Howard, of the
same city. Having thus equipped
himself for the work which com-
manded his most enthusiastic inte-
rest, he returned home, and shortly
afterwards had his attention
attracted by the various schemes of
boring for water which were occupy-
ing the attention of experts in
different parts of the country. Pro-
viding himself with the necessary
plant, he inaugurated operations of
this nature in the Darling Downs
country with considerable success,
and encouraged by the satisfactory
results attendant upon his experi-
ments, in co-operation with his
brothers, he purchased a second
equipment of machinery, and began
to exploit the far western portion
of the State. Since that early
period Mr. Free has become the con-
trolling factor in a syndicate owning
several plants and engaged in
boring for water in the western dis-
trict and various other parts of the
State, their endeavours in this direc-
tion having more than once received
the patronage of the Queensland
Government. A very slight acquain-
tance with the country where these
experiments are carried on soon
reveals the fact that Mr. Free is
regarded not only as an enthusiast

connection with boring, and he has
established in practical demonstra-
tion his right to this distinction. A
striking example of this was fur-
nished recently on a far-west era sta-
tion, where boring had been carried
on extensively, and a depth of 1,200
feet touched without any results.
Mr. Free’s ability was put to the
test by a challenge to locate water
on the property where the previous
operators had failed, and taking up
the gauntlet he astonished the pessi-
mists by detecting a subterranean
stream at a depth of 600 feet, only
a few yards distant from the spot
where previous unsuccessful effoi'ts
had been made. It is interesting
to note that Mr. Free does not us©
the “divining rod” to court indica-
tion of those places where the
precious moisture may be obtained
by sinking. Instead he uses his
hands, which, with the palms pressed
closely together, are held in a
slightly extended position in front
of the body. By this simple medium
he claims to become cognizant of the
mysterious influence diffused in
obedience to some occult law by the
near vicinity of water. Though
called from point to point by the
demands of his clientele, Mr. Free
has formed a permanent home at
“Waldon,” Nobby, where he owns an
acreage of 700 acres, divided by
sheep-proof fencing into 15 paddocks,
and carrying no less than six bores.
About 500 acres of this property is
under cultivation, nearly a third
being devoted to the growing of
lucerne, while an important feature
among the cereals is the large quan-
tity of canary seed, in the produc-
tion of which Mr. Free claims to
have been one of the pioneers of the
district. Prominent among the farm
machinery is a steam traction
engine, which is utilized for the
pumping of water, ploughing when
conditions permit, the generating of
electricity, and other purposes.
Horses, cattle, and sheep are all
bred on the farm, where also the
usual departments of a mixed pro-
position are carried on with profit-
able results. The homestead, a fine,
commodious dwelling, contains 10
rooms, a sensible and attractive
feature being an open, fly-proof
verandah room for sleeping purposes.
Comfort and convenience prevail
throughout the home, which possesses
its own electric lighting service, and
other luxuries. Trees of an orna-
mental character, orchard fruits,
and vines, have been freely planted,
and the whole presents the pleasing
appearance of a well-cared-for,
thoroughly well-appointed, prosper-
ous rural residence. In addition to
his other interests, Mr. Free owns
a farm of 500 acres at Felton, and
is a shareholder in the Felton Cheese
Factory. Among his hobbies motor-
ing perhaps takes pride of place, and
he is the possessor of a “Napier”
car. Married in 1900 to Martha,
daughter of the late Henry Bell, of
Sandy Creek, near Warwick, who
was one of the earliest pioneer
farmers of his district, he has a
family of one son and two daughters.
PATRICK FLANAGAN, “Sun-
nyside,” Felton, via Cambooya, was
born in the County of Londonderry,
Ireland, in the year 1850, and is a
son of the late John Flanagan, a
farmer of the same parts. Educated
at the Dongiven National School,
on reaching the age of 16 years he
commenced work on his father’s
farm, at which occupation he
remained until attaining his twenty-
second year. He then decided to
tempt Fortune in the antipodes, and
securing passage on a vessel bound
for New Zealand, he bid good-bye
to the land of his birth. On arrival
in the Dominion he worked as a
labourer for a time, afterwards
taking contracts for developmental
work on station holdings, continuing
at this work for upwards of eight
years. At the outbreak of the gold

rush to Temora, New South Wales,
he decided to leave New Zealand and
join in the search for the precious
metal, but by the time he had
arrived in the Mother State the find
had practically run the full length
of its tether. Nothing daunted, he
turned his attention to the railway
line then being pushed out to
Bourke from Nyngan, on which he
worked for a time, relinquishing the
job to carry on as a contractor both
on his own behalf and in partnership
with others during a period extend-
ing over some 10 years. In the year
1892 he came to Queensland, where
he followed the same calling in
western parts of the State, ulti-
mately entering into partnership
with Mr. W. McGregor in a couple
of grazing farms near Cunnamulla,
Middle Creek. In the course of time
the partnership was dissolved, Mr.
Flanagan retaining one of the farms,
which he carried on with consider-
able success for several years, at the
end of which time he was induced to
dispose of the property. Proceeding
to the Charleville district, he took
up a grazing lease at the head of the
Paroo River, now known as “Don-
given,” and ran it as a pastoral pro-
position until 1910, in which year
he sold out, with the intention of
settling down at “Sunnyside,” on
the Darling Downs. Mr. Flanagan
acquired the freehold of this farm,
which comprises 800 acres of first-
class land, when the “Felton”
Estate was subdivided for closer
settlement purposes, and he has
since proceeded to develop it for the
purposes of mixed farming, at the
present time having about 400 acres
under cultivation. Of a quiet
disposition, he finds recreation in
reading works of a modern character,
and in the study of the political
problems of the Australian Com-
monwealth.


ROBERT GRAHAM, of "Cedar
Hill,” Mount Kent, was born in
County Fermanagh, near Inniskillen,
Ireland, on July 12, 1840, being a
farmer of those parts. At the close
of his education, which was gained
in his native village, young Graham
worked on his father’s farm until
reaching man’s estate, when he
decided to try his fortune in Aus-
tralia. Taking passage by the
‘‘Royal Standard” he reached Vic-
toria in the year 1861, after an
uneventful voyage. At this time the
rush to the gold diggings in the
Beechworth district was in full
swing, in which Mr. Graham
joined, and in 1865 he went
to the Buckland diggings, where
he continued his endeavours to
locate the yellow gleam, but
having the misfortune to meet with
a serious accident, he was compelled
to abandon this strenuous life in
favour of lighter occupations. He
was successful in obtaining a position
in the Bank of New South Wales at
Beechworth, but with returning
health he once again yielded to the
fascinations of the gold lure, and for
many years worked on various fields
in the Victorian State. Hearing

country, finally selecting his present
holding. Five years later he added
three other blocks of 80 acres each
the work of the farm was placed on
a profitable basis, and Mr. Graham
had the satisfaction of reaping the
reward of his enterprise. His family
now growing to mature years, it
became necessary for Mr. Graham to
secure a farm of larger dimensions,
and a property of 700 acres in the
Clifton district was secured, on
which the family took up its
residence in 1905. The principal
industry at "Cedar Hill” is mixed
farming and dairying, besides which
a number of horses are bred each
year. Mr. Graham is typical of the
pioneer who has experienced many
ups and downs in life, and under-
gone adventures of a nature calcu-
lated to try the courage of the
bravest. When in Victoria he and
his brother were very nearly cap-
tured by the bushranger Power, at
a time when they had in their
possession a quantity of gold, and
they were naturally very elated at
their success in escaping the clutches
of this bandit. So numerous have
been his adventures that Mr.
Graham is now engaged in writing
an account of his life for the interest
of the members of his family and
other friends. He married in 1874,

ISAAC TAYLOR, "Fairview”
Farm, Mount Kent, Darling Downs.
The subject of our review is a native
of \ ictoria, in which State he was
born on October 21, 1859, being a
son of Mr. William Taylor, of
County Somersetshire, England. His
father came to Australia in the early
days of settlement, but returned to
his native land in the year 1862.
Youngs Taylor received his scholastic
training in the Old Country, where
he continued to reside until reaching
his eighteenth year, when he took
passage to the land which gave him
birth, and from which he had been
absent for a span of 16 years.
Landing in South Australia, he
shortly afterwards made his way to
Yorke Peninsula, where for two
years he was employed at farm work,
at which time wheatgrowing was in
its earliest experimental stages, the
country up till then having been
considered as only suitable for pas-
toral occupation. Leaving this
centre, he proceeded inland to a
point far beyond Port Augusta, and
for some time was employed on
various large runs for which the
Central State is noted. In 1890 he
decided to come to Queensland, and
subsequent to his arrival he pro-
ceeded to the Darling Downs
to make an inspection of a con-
siderable tract of country, finally

barley, and oats. Satisfactory pro-
gress was made, and from time to
time the farm was extended by the
purchase of adjoining properties,
until it comprised some 1,000
acres of splendid farming country.
In addition to mixed farming and
year, their prime qualities finding
for them a ready sale at satisfactory
prices. "Fairview” Farm extends
back to the ranges, and contains
some splendid sheep country, the
gentle slopes of the hillsides being
particularly well adapted to the
purpose, especially during the wet
seasons. Mr. Taylor is typical of the
steady, industrious pioneer who has
sallied forth to build a home for
himself and his family, cheerfully
facing hardships and privations, the
thoughts of which alone would van-
quish the spirits of less courageous
men. He has been ably seconded
in all his labours by Mrs. Taylor,
whose cheerful disposition has gone
a long way towards lightening the
heavy task to the mastering of which
he had set his hand and mind. Mr.
Taylor displayed sound judgment
when selecting the site whereon to
erect the homestead, which occupies
a prominent position on rising
ground, and commands a fine view
of the surrounding country. The
dwelling is a substantial structure,
containing large, airy rooms, the
interior furnishings being in excel-
lent taste, and providing the
maximum of comfort. Several out-
buildings for the housing of stock
and plant are in evidence, and the
general appearance is that of a well-
managed farm. In 1893 Mr. Taylor

THOMAS TAYLOR, of “Myra”
Farm, Mount Kent, Darling Downs,
is a son of the late William Taylor,
farmer, of Bideford, Devonsliire,
England, and was born on Janu-
ary 2of the year 1855. He received
his scholastic training in the local
school at Bideford, which he
attended until reaching the tenth
year of bis age, when his school-
days terminated, and he was called
upon to assist his father in the
duties of the home farm. During
the ensuing eight years he gained
a comprehensive knowledge of the
farming industry in its manifold
branches, but with a view to obtain-
ing an insight into other forms of
trade, he journeyed to Wales, and
for a period of two years found
employment in the iron and steel
industry. Whilst following this
occupation in Wales Mr. Taylor was
seized with the desire to settle in
Australia, and in fulfilment of this
ambition he sailed for the land of
the Southern Cross, reaching his
destination (Brisbane) in the year
1875. He had heard of the wonder-
ful prospects open to men of courage
and enterprise in the Northern
State, and possessing these attri-
butes in a marked degree, he felt
that it was only a matter of time
before he would achieve the distant
goal of success, upon which
he had set his eyes with the
unwavering determination
that no obstacle, however
great, should stand be-
tween him and the realiza-
tion of his fondest hopes.
At first he found employ-
ment at various industries,
adding largely to his already
extensive store of knowledge,
in the late seventies being
in the Warwick district,
where he worked at his
original occupation of farm-
ing. In the year 1880 he
went to the sugar plant-
ations at Mackay, 12 months
later transferring to Bunda-
berg, where he continued
to work in the sugarcane
brakes for a time. In 1882
he felt that the time had
come when he could launch
out for himself, and in
pursuance of this laud-
able object he returned
to the Darling Downs,
and selected an 80-acre home-
stead allotment in the Mount
Kent district. Thenceforth all
his time and attention were given
Mr. Taylor has made it a practice
to provide against dry seasons, and
the. numerous haystacks present on
the farm indicate that ample provi-
sion has been made to cope with a
sustained period of exceptional
weather. He is a great lover of the
thoroughbred, and there is not an
animal on the estate which would
fail to attract the attention of any
judge of horses. He engages in the
breeding of a number of first-class
Clydesdale draughts, stock which
has proved itself unequalled in
handling the everyday work of a
farm. With Mr. Taylor the breed-
ing of horses is a hobby, and in the
Clifton show ring he has won four
championships with stock of his own
raising, and at Toowoomba in 1914
carried off the championship for the
best team of farm horses. He has
unbounded pride in his horses, and
not without justification, as one
would have to travel a long way
indeed to find a better stamp of
animal than is to be seen on “Myra
Farm. During his 30 odd years
of residence on the Downs Mr.
Taylor has witnessed many startling
changes, and from his present haven
of comfort is able to review with
feelings of satisfaction the dogged
struggles of the early days, when a
stout heart was required to meet the

HENRY LANGSDORF, of
\V heatville,” Mount Kent, Darling
Downs, was born at Rockenberg, near
Frankfurt, Germany, on Decem-
ber 4, 1850, and is the son of the
late Conrad Langsdorf, shoemaker
of the same place. He was educated
at the local State school, leaving his
studies at the age of 14 years to
assist his father, under whose guid-
ance he acquired a thorough know-
ledge of bootmaking in all its
branches. On reaching his twen-
tieth year he was called upon to
serve in the Imperial Army of the
Fatherland, and after a few months’
training his regiment was sent to
the front to take part in the Franco-
Prussian War of 1870. He served
throughout the campaign, being for-
tunate enough to escape unscathed,
and at the conclusion of active
operations he returned to the protec-
tion of the parental roof, for about
two years helping his father in the
course of his business. Blearing
excellent reports of the outlook in
Queensland from friends who had
earlier emigrated to Australia and
were doing well, he decided to leave
the land of his birth and try his
fortune in the antipodes. He little
anticipated the many hardships
which inevitably fall to the lot of a
pioneer in a new country, but with
grit and determination he set

at Brisbane in 1875, he proceeded
inland to Toowoomba, where he
worked at his trade for a short
period, but the call of the land

proved irresistible, and he turned
his attention to farming, which
industry has ever since claimed his
attention. After working for the
late John Pauli, sen., in the Mount
Kent district for about 18 months,
he secured an 80-acre homestead
scope for his efforts, he purchased an
additional 107 acres in the vicinity
of his homestead, and as time passed
on the property was still further
increased, until the total area was
brought up to about 1,500 acres,
at which it now stands. Dairying
and mixed farming are the prin-
cipal departments of industry, but
a goodly area is cultivated and
cropped with wheat and other
cereals. Mr. Langsdorf can lay
claim with justifiable pride to
having grown on his farm malting
barley which formed part and parcel
of a quantity that was claimed by
experts to be the finest sample ever
placed on the world’s market.
Although not making a special
feature of the raising of blood stock,
he has always paid close attention
to the breeding of both horses and
cattle, his production in this direc-
tion being restricted to meeting the
requirements of his own farm. Mr.
Langsdorf’s sons and daughters may
well view with pride the manner in
which he has surmounted the many
hardships inseparable from the
building up of a home in virgin
country, and the invaluable assist-
ance rendered by Mrs. Langsdorf,
who by her cheerful co-oj)eration has
done much to ease the burden of the
day and help pave the way to the
prosperous times of the present day.

ing from a near relative of the great
possibilities presented by the farm-
ing industry in Queensland, he
became fired with the ambition to
emigrate to the New World, there
to make a competence for himself
by the sweat of his own brow.
Taking passage for himself, his wife,
and family of four children, he set
out on his long journey to the land
of promise, reaching Moreton Bay
in the month of May of the year
1889. With only a meagre capital
at his command he struck out for
the Downs country, with the fixed
determination that no effort should
be lacking on his part to achieve the
goal of his desires. His first employ-
ment was with the firm of Roessler
Bros., as manager of their orchard
and the business allied therewith, a
position which he filled with every
satisfaction for a period extending
over seven years. At the expiration
of this time he decided that the
time had come when he could launch
out for himself, and in the fulfilment
of that purpose he purchased a small
farm of 120 acres, whereon his

of the type of loyal German citizens
who, realizing the ideal conditions
of life and freedom obtainable in
the British Colonies, have left their
native land to win a competence for
themselves and their dependants
under the aegis of the illustrious flag
of the British Empire. In the year
1881 he was married to Christina,
daughter of the late Wiegand Bange,
of Roeddenau, Germany, the issue of
the union being four sons and four
daughters. Of the sons, Henry, the
eldest, manages the “Au” Estate at
Cambooya, in which Mr. Kessler, sen.,

JESSE MAY, “Paradise Hall,”
Nobby, was born at Neddlestead,
Kent, England, on April 3, 1846.
He received his education locally,
afterwards assisting his father on
the home farm. In the year 1873
he came to Queensland, landing at
Brisbane in November of that year.
Proceeding to the Darling Downs,
he worked in the Allora district
until early in 1877, when he went to
Clifton. In 1899 he selected a block
of 160 acres about five miles from
the site upon which the town of
Nobby now stands, subsequently
enlarging this area by the purchase
of an additional 690 acres, the whole
of which has been brought to a for-
ward state of development. During
his active life as a farmer Mr. May
cultivated wheat, barley, and oats,
and also engaged in the breeding of
shorthorn cattle and blood stock.
About 1908 Mr. May, who has a
family of six sons and six daughters,
settled his sons on farms of their
own, and is now living in retirement
at Nobby.
WILLIAM MacLELLAN, Mount
Kent, Nobby, was born at West-
brook in 1858. He is a son of the late
Donald MacLellan, who came to
Queensland from Inverness, Scot-
land, in the thirties. He found
employment at pastoral work
on the Downs, at which time
the town of Drayton was even
smaller than it is to-day, and the
site on which the city of Toowoomba
now stands given over to swamps.
Mr. W. MacLellan Avas educated at
Drayton, and on leaving school
worked as a station hand on “Clif-
ton” Station for seven years. After
the death of Ids father he joined
with his mother in taking up the
present holding, originally a part of
the old “Clifton” Station. The area
first taken up embraced 160 acres,
but with additions from time to time
this has been increased to 400 acres,
all of which is devoted to the mixed-
farming industry.


V. BRODIE & COMPANY,
general merchants, Greenmount.
The thriving business carried on by
Messrs. Brodie & Company was
established as far back as the year
1874, and rapidly became a factor
in the business life of the Darling
Downs. Within a very few years it
was found necessary to open a
branch at the adjoining township of
Nobby, which at once proved a
success, and has been continued ever
since. The founder of the business,
Mrs. Violet Brodie, is the widow of
the late Daniel Brodie, who came to
Queensland from Scotland in 1862,
sons were able to assume the respon-
sibilities of the conduct of the
business, Mrs. Brodie retired from
active participation in the manage-
menfc, by which time the firm was
not only strongly established, but
had become an institution in the life
and welfare of the surrounding
countryside. Mrs. Brodie set a high
standard for the conduct of her
enterprise, and by her integrity and
straightforward dealings soon gained
an unassailable niche in the good-
will of the entire community. In
the troublous time of early settle-
ment many a struggling settler was
traditions of the trade, and the con-
tinually increasing turnover is the
best index of the very satisfactory
way in which the numerous require-
ments of their extensive connection
have been met. The present mem-
bers of the firm are Daniel and
Malcolm Brodie, the two younger
eons, who from their earliest teens
helped in the work of the store,
besides which they gained much

and was with the mercantile firm of
G. & J. Harris, of Ipswich, for many
years. Mr. Daniel Brodie died in
1874, from injuries sustained from
a riding accident. Soon after this
unfortunate event, Mrs. Brodie with
her seven children removed to Green-
mount, and commencing in a small
way set to work to earn a living for
herself and the large family left on
her hands. Slowly but surely the

hours of need with the aid of her
timely help, and it may be safely
averred that Mrs. Brodie contributed
more than her share towards the
erection of the fabric into which has
since been interwoven the prosperity
now so strongly in evidence. This
method of assisting the settlers was
inaugurated by Mrs. Brodie, who
speaks highly of the loyalty of the
farmers with whom she had dealings
over many years. Since taking over
the management the present pro-
prietors have followed the best
interests of his fellow-ratepayers,
and as a member of the Cambooya
Shire Council he has been of con-
siderable service in fostering the
welfare of the community. He holds
the Commission of the Peace. He
married a daughter of the late John
Maxwell, a well-known identity in
the early days of Ipswich, and has
a family of three sons and two
daughters. Mr. Daniel Brodie’s
wife is a daughter of the late Robert
Forsyth, a pioneer farmer of the
Greenmount district, the issue being
two sons and three daughters.


The Clifton District.
The Clifton district lies near the centre of the
Darling Downs, the township being 134 miles from
Brisbane, 33 beyond Toowoomba, and 25 miles
from Warwick. Railway communication was estab-
lished with the metropolis as early as 1869, when
the section between Cowrie Junction and Hendon
was declared open for traffic. In common with
the other more important centres on the Downs, the
settlement dates back to an early stage in the occupa-
tion of Queensland territory, and by 1879 so far
advanced was the development of the region under
review that the Shire of Clifton was officially proclaimed
a local authority on November 11 in that year.
The Shire of Clifton forms a prosperous and pro-
gressive municipality, covering an area of 432 J square
miles, from which the total revenue in 1914 (the latest
year for which official figures are available) was £9,858,
including £8,954 from the general rate. The town
within a radius of one mile from the railway station
contains a population of 1,500 persons, whilst that of
the district numbers approximately 6,500.
In common with the rest of the Darling Downs
the Clifton district remained for many years divided
into immense sheep stations. But at a comparatively early
date the high agricultural value of the land was recog-
nized, and the subsequent progress of the town has
proceeded as speedily as the purchasing power of pros-
pective farmers would permit of their acquiring hold-
ings. Wide areas have since passed over to the plough,
and to-day farm joins farm in a wide tract of highly-
improved territory, the total area under cultivation in
the petty sessions district in 1914 being 69,862 acres,
which was larger than the aggregate for any of the
fifteen other divisions of the Darling Downs, Pittsworth
coming second with 60,585 acres.
Dairying and mixed farming form the principal
activities of the Clifton agriculturists. The most widely-
raised crop is wheat, to which 23,091 acres were de-
voted during the season already quoted, both soil and
climatic conditions proving well adapted to the cultiva-
tion of cereals. In the same season maize was grown
on 7,279 acres, hay on 10,237 acres, and green crops
on 17,364 acres. Of the latter total 4,048 acres were
under oats, and 9,228 grew lucerne. Leguminous plants
thrive luxuriantly in the deep volcanic soil. The dairy-
ing industry has accelerated the cultivation of these
fodder crops. Of late years dairyfarmers have been
turning increasing attention to the production of
cheese, and in 1914 a total of 1,398,965 lbs. of this
commodity was turned out in the district. This was
by a big margin the largest quantity of cheese produced
in any of the Darling Downs districts. During the same
period an aggregate of 986,796 lbs. of butter were
made. The township of Clifton contains one butter and
three cheese factories, all of which are busy and pros-
perous enterprises. The petty sessions district on Decem-
ber 31, 1914, contained 7,121 head of dairy cattle, in
addition to which there were 1,547 dry cattle of similar
class. The dairying establishments numbered 438.
In common with that of the immediately surround-
ing territory the history of the Clifton district dates
back to the earliest days of pastoral occupation of
Queensland. The first pioneers to push northwards from
the fertile New England country of New South Wales
were well satisfied to make permanent homes on the
undulating volcanic plains which Allan Cunningham
had been the first white man to set eyes upon when he
crossed their grassy expanses in 1827. And it was at
“Canning Downs,” the homestead of which to-day lies
3 miles from the town of Warwick, where thirteen years
later Patrick Leslie founded the first station to be
formed in the territory which was destined afterwards
to be known as the Colony and then as the State of
Queensland. In the late twenties the region now known
as the well-settled and closely-cultivated district of
Clifton formed the northernmost outpost of settlement,
as lying on the remote boundary of the run over which
roamed the stock of the father of Queensland squatting.
When Leslie and his brothers were followed northwards
by other owners of herds and flocks anxious to emulate
the achievements of those enterprising pioneers who had
blazed the track into the grassy volcanic plateau, it
was the attractions of the Darling Downs to the north
and the west which most attracted their desire. Such,
in brief, is the story of the pastoral occupation of the
grassy downs which have since come to be regarded as
the garden of Queensland.
But a small fraction of the agricultural resources of
the Clifton district is yet farmed by methods unlocking
their full productivity. The majority of the land re-
mains in holdings larger than can be worked to the
greatest advantage, and the systems of agriculture
applied are not those conducing to the maximum yield
from a given area. Compared with the long-settled farm-
ing regions of the southern States the systems used are
yet primitive and suited to pioneering rather than to
settled conditions of settlement. It is not to be inferred
that necessarily more remunerative results would have
accrued from other methods under the conditions which
have prevailed through the past. But it is certain that
under the conditions now coming into being higher
yields must follow the introduction of modern ideas.


The late JOHN PAULI, of “Fern
Mount,” Back Plains, Clifton, was
born at Rockenberg, near Frankfurt,
Germany, on April 1, 1845, being
the second son of the late John
Pauli, agriculturist and sheep-
farmer, of the same place. Young
Pauli received his education in his

native village, completing his studies
in the fourteenth year of his age.
He then assisted his father on the
home farm, displaying so great an
aptitude for the work that in a
very little time he was able to
assume control of operations and
relieve his parent of the greater
portion of the multifarious duties of
the farm. At frequent intervals
rumours of the wonderful openings
available to men of courage and
determination in the land of the
Southern Cross had spread through
the village, and inspired by these
Mr. Pauli decided to woo Dame
Fortune’s smile in the New World,
where so many of his countrymen
had already made their homes.
Attracted by the liberal land laws
then in vogue in Queensland, he
decided to make his home in the
Northern State, and in his nine-
teenth year he secured a berth on a
sailing vessel bound for Moreton
Bay, which port was eventually
reached on September 4, 1864. He
was welcomed on arrival by his
brother, Mr. Henry Pauli, and soon
after landing proceeded in his com-
pany to the Downs, where he was
successful in obtaining employment
at pastoral work. He was initiated
into the art of shearing sheep in the
Australian style on “Jimbour”
Station, finding the method very
different to that which ruled in his
own country. He had many exciting
experiences with the blacks, and on
one occasion, in 1866, was sur-
rounded by hostile natives, from
whom he escaped with the greatest
of difficulty. After a lapse of two
years the brothers formed a partner-
ship, and purchased a small block
of five acres of land at Middle Ridge,
near Toowoomba, which they pro-
ceeded to cultivate and plant with
vines, fruit trees, potatoes, etc., and
it may safely be asserted that it
would be very difficult indeed to find
another spot of land in the whole
of Australia which has been sub-
jected to the same amount of intense
culture as was this particular block.
As occasion warranted additional

land was purchased, and in a very
little time the acreage had been
increased to 40, which at that time
was considered a big holding, and
was the largest farm at Middle
Ridge. In order to maintain them-
selves and at the same time improve
their holding, the brothers were
compelled to find outside employ-
ment, and in those strenuous times
no two people worked with greater
industry or were more deserving of
success than the brothers Pauli.

the heavy timber with which the
land was encumbered, but in the
course of time they reaped the
reward of their perseverance, and
gained a sound footing in the land
of their adoption, but not before
they had undergone privations the
severity of which would have broken
the spirits of men of weaker natures,
or less endowed with the tenacity
of purpose which was so conspicuous
a trait of their respective tempera-
ments. Frequently they were faced
with hunger through lack of employ-
ment in the times between shearing
seasons, their hard - won savings
having been invested in the improve-
ment of their little properly, the
success or failure of which would
mean so much to their future pros-
pects. A good fencing contract on
the Mitchell Downs helped bridge
over a difficult period in their lives,
and with the completion of this
work the outlook took on more
roseate hues. The scarcity of water
was an ever-present trouble, and on
one occasion the long delay in the


arrival of supplies reduced the toilers
to a very parlous condition of mind
and body, Mr. John Pauli in par-
ticular suffering intense agony of
mind. Too much space would be
required to fully outline the many
vicissitudes suffered by these hardy
toilers in the days when the popu-
lation of the country west of Too-
woomba could be almost counted on
the finger tips, and the conditions
of life were of a most primitive char-
acter. About the middle seventies
eighties a dissolution was effected by
mutual consent, and Mr. John
Pauli returned to Middle Ridge,
where he was engaged in farm-
ing and winemaking for nearly
a decade. In 1886 he leased the
property, and proceeded to develop
the 260 acres of land which
fell to his share when the part-
nership already mentioned was
broken up. From time to time
he purchased additional blocks, and
with the assistance of his sons and
structure, the interior of which is
fitted up with every comfort, is in
direct antithesis to the days when
tents and bark humpies formed the
only shelter from the varying
changes peculiar to the climatic
conditions of inland Queensland,

the Queensland Land Act of 1868
he decided to launch out on his own
account in more northerly areas,
and accordingly selected about 300
acres in the locality where the town
of Clifton subsequently sprang into
being. He first experimented in
wheat-growing, a departure which
was looked upon as a somewhat
courageous enterprise, from the cir-
cumstance that the Downs
at that period were not
generally accredited with
agricultural possibilities. His
first crop, sown over an
area of 11 acres, was pro-
duced in 1878, and achieving
a success with this initial
effort he proceeded to en-

well-deserved success, his good work
as one of the pioneers of the Clifton
district. The late gentleman was
not one to make himself prominent
in the public life of the place, but
he preserved an unswerving fidelity
to his convictions as a strong church-
man of the Catholic Apostolic com-
munion, in connection with which
he did excellent service as a preacher,
and having in earlier life accepted
the Commission of the Peace he con-
tinued to act in this capacity for a
number of years, and was looked
upon as a wise and benevolent coun-
sellor in the district. He married,
in 1857, Mary Matilda, eldest
daughter of the late Edward Agnew,
a pioneer colonist of New South
Wales, and clerk of Petty Sessions
in Muswellbrook, the issue being
four sons and four daughters. The
late gentleman died in 1900, at the
age of 79 years. His second son, the
subject of this memoir, received his
education locally until his fifteenth
year, when, his assistance being re-
quired on the home estate, he ter-
minated his studies and took up the
serious business of life on the land.

the entire management devolved
upon him, he inaugurated more up-

The Allora District.
From Hendon, which is on the main southern rail-
way, and lies 15 miles on the Brisbane side of Warwick,
a branch line runs a distance of 13 miles in a north-
westerly direction to Goomburra. Three and a half
miles from the junction is Allora, the most populous and
important town in the district, and a settlement the
origin of which dates so far back in the history of the
development of the Darling Downs that its site was
selected by the Government of New South Wales before
the separation from the parent colony in 1859. Allora
is situated at an altitude 1,500 feet above sea level, and
is favoured with one of the most pleasant and healthy
climates in the whole area of the State. The shire of
which Allora is the administrative centre was declared
a local authority in 1869, whilst the railway from
Hendon was declared open on April 21, 1897, the
extension to Goomburra not being completed until
July, 1912. The town bears all the characteristics which
stamp on their appearance the solid prosperity held in
common by all the larger settlements of the Darling
Downs. The site was admirably chosen, being on
a fertile plain, beside the banks of Dalrymple Creek,
and at the foot of Mount Allora.
The surrounding district is utilized mainly for
mixed farming and dairying. The soil is very rich,
varying from a heavy black to brown and chocolate,
being of volcanic origin and of great depth. In common
with all the rest of the Downs, the ground cracks
quickly iir dry w 7 eather, the moisture disappearing
rapidly from beneath the surface, and thus intensifying
the evils of drought. Cultivation under the primitive
methods which omit preliminary fallowing, as well as
the constant harrowing as practised in the more arid
regions of southern States, adds to the aridity of this
country when the normal seasonal rains fail to appear.
Doubtless the application of more modern systems to a
large extent will decrease the element of uncertainty
attaching to climatic fluctuation. Even under existing
conditions and habits of farming, the district is one of
the most prosperous in the whole of what ranks as one
of the most productive in the State.
Allora stands in the centre of the largest wheat-
growing area in the State, and it was at this town where
practical tests first demonstrated that flour made from
Queensland wheat is not excelled by that of any other
grain of the Commonwealth. Doubtless the State holds
many untried wheat belts of great magnitude, official
estimates concluding that these aggregate an area of
50,000,000 acres. But it is reasonable to suppose that
the portions first farmed are not inferior in this respect
to territory still allowed to remain under occupation for
the less productive industry of pastoral pursuits, and
the experiences so far recorded place the locality under
review easily in the forefront. The first place among
local branches of farming, however, is held easily by
the dairying industry, and in 1914, the last year for
which the official figures are available, among the
sixteen districts in which the Darling Downs territory
is divided Allora ranked third in the amount of butter
manufactured, the total for the twelve months being
986,796 lbs., whilst that of Clifton, the next highest,
was 647,329 lbs. Cheesemaking, however, had not
attracted the attention of local dairy-farmers, so that
a larger proportion of the total milk yielded was avail-
able for the other product. The Allora district at the
same period contained 334 dairying establishments,
with 4,636 head of dairy cattle in milk and 997 of the
same class of stock dry.
In the early days of occupation the whole of the
country stretching from Stanthorpe to Dalby, a dis-
tance as the crow flies of more than 100 miles, was
devoted exclusively to sheep grazing. Thus the site of
the future town of Allora lay in the midst of a prim-
itive wilderness, over which was applied the skeleton
of pioneering industry and the scantiest of scattered
and isolated population. The division of the first runs
into smaller stations left the embryo settlements on the
sites of the towns that were languishing for the
need of people and the trade which only closer settle-
ment could bring. So long as the country remained
exclusively in the hands of those unable, from the mere
size of their holdings, to launch.out upon any form of
agriculture, the increasing population of the colonies
must look for homes to districts where the conditions as
to land tenure were more suitable for the man with
slender capital but abundant strength of muscles and
character. The needed change first made its approach
manifest when the Government acquired for purposes
of subdividing and parcelling out to agriculturists
20,200 acres of the old “Goomburra” Station. At a
subsequent date the Government resumed the residue
of the same station, which contained a considerable
quantity of land in proximity to the town of Allora.
The great majority of this country quickly passed into
cultivation, and so successful were the results that
from time to time afterwards other station properties
were acquired by the Crown under the Agricultural
Lands Repurchase Act, with the object of passing them
into the hands of men who would draw a maximum of
production from the great resources locked up in the


immense regions of rich soil hitherto adding but a
small fraction of their proper share to the annual wealth
of the community. Since then the district has never
ceased developing along lines of permanent prosperity.
Besides being so well suited to the production of
all classes of cereal crops belonging naturally to a tem-
perate climate, the natural conditions obtaining have
proved themselves eminently suited to crops of maize
and potatoes, as well as to permanent fields of lucerne,
the latter proving an immense aid to dairy-farmers. The
rainfall is much the same as that of Warwick, which
fluctuates in the neighbourhood of 30 inches per annum.
The driest year recorded by the gauge at “The Hermit-
age” (an experimental and teaching farm belonging to
the Agricultural Department) was 1915, when only
15 inches fell. Were the soil less liable to crack and
become porous with each short spell of aridity, the rain
would be ample to meet every requirement, even in
what now are regarded as drought seasons. To secure
the landholders of this region against financial loss
involved in lessened rain would appear to be a task well
within the scope of the probable attainments of scien-
tific agricultural investigation.
By the nearest existing route Allora lies 148 miles
from Brisbane. But the construction of the proposed
connecting link between Maryvale and Mount Edwards
via Recta, coupled with a short extension from Goom-
burra, would shorten the journey by about 50 miles.
The Maryvale District.
M aryvale lies at the terminus of a short spur rail-
way running from Warwick 20 miles in a north-easterly
direction. Of recent years this line has come in for a
considerable degree of public attention, as forming the
northern extremity of the southern network which it
is proposed to link up with the existing line running
south from Ipswich to Munbilla and then to Mount
Edwards. The two termini are separated by the short
space of some 30 miles, and their connection would
reduce the distance of the journey to Warwick, and
consequently to Sydney, by at least 50 miles. But
between them lies the main range, a barrier for years
baffling the efforts of early pioneers aspiring at nothing
more ambitious than crossing the natural barrier with
pack-horses. However, in the late twenties the explorer,
Allan Cunningham, discovered the pass now known as
Cunningham Gap, and later Spicer Gap was found.
Both these passages through the range lie directly
between Maryvale and Mount Edwards, and the pro-
posed route of the line, which has been already surveyed,
wends its way over the latter gateway to the interior
tableland, which is entered at a point near the head-
waters of the Condamine River. The railway when it
comes to be constructed will present no gradients steeper
than some now existing on trunk lines between capital
cities in the southern States. The new route which
would be formed to Sydney would, of course, leave
Toowoomba far to the south, the train after leaving
Ipswich proceeding in a south-westerly course to
JOHN REID, "St. George,”
Allora, is a son of the late John
Reid, of Ipswich, Suffolk, England,
who came to Queensland by the ship
"William Miles” in January, 1855,
among his fellow-passengers being
some who afterwards became noted
men in the country of their adop-
tion. After remaining in Brisbane
for about 12 months Mr. Reid
travelled by bullock dray to War-
wick, and was occupied in and about
Warwick by as nearly a direct line as engineering
difficulties will permit.
The line from Warwick to Mary vale passes through
a picturesque valley, along which one of the tributaries
to the Condamine wends its way amongst highly fertile
agricultural land closely resembling that surrounding
Emu Yale, which is passed on the way to Killarney.
The district is closely subdivided into farms, among
which an area of about 640 acres is the most common.
High values attach to the freehold, and up to £l5 per
acre has been paid at public auction for blocks offered
in sizes suitable to the application of agricultural
industry. The name “Maryvale” originally denoted the
pastoral station, which comprised the whole of the
surrounding country, and the homestead, which is still
in occupation, being a fine specimen of early build-
ing, the whole structure consisting of cedar. The com-
parative proximity of Warwick, coupled with the fairly
frequent train service running between the two places,
has restricted the growth of a township at Maryvale,
and the settlement has not yet attained dimensions of
commercial importance, most of the business being
drawn to the larger centre.
The good land continues to a point close up to the
main range, where the country becomes rugged and wild.
However, for much of its distance the proposed con-
necting railway would pass through country well suited
to farming, and from the development of which the
State would stand to gain substantially.

being engaged chiefly in fence erec-
tion and shepherding. During this
period he selected 640 acres of land
at North Creek, Goomburra, some 17
miles from Allora, which was


utilized for grazing purposes under
the management of Mr. John Reid.
After the death of the late Mr.
Reid, which occurred at Goomburra
at the early age of 54, this property
was sold and the proceeds divided
among the different members of his
family. Mr. John Reid was born
at Turner’s Creek, now known as
Braeside, about 25 miles from W ar-
wick, on June 15, 1856, and
received his early education at Mr.
John Henry Nicholson’s private
academy on Sandy Creek Road, later
attending the East Warwick State
School under the headmastership of
Mr. Kerr, afterwards an inspector of
schools. At 11 years of age he com-
menced work as “horse-boy” to a

wage of 6s. a week and his keep,

damper, and corned meat. In 1870
he transferred his services to the
woolsheds at “Pikedale,” where he
made himself generally useful, and
about two years later proceeded on
a droving trip from Talgai, near
Clifton, to the Belyando River dis-
trict, his destination being a point
some 60 miles west of Springsure.
This was a lengthy and trying
experience, the trip taking six
months through dingo-infested coun-
try. Subsequently for nearly 16
years Mr. Reid was engaged in
shearing pursuits at “Glengallan,”
“Canning Downs,” and “South
Toolburra” Stations, filling in the
off-seasons with fencing and general
station work on the first-mentioned
property. In August, 1886, he left
“Glengallan,” and took up his resi-
dence on a 40-acre farm situated two
miles south-east of Allora, which
holding he purchased from Mr.
Walter Stacey. After five years of
steady, persevering toil, he had
accumulated sufficient capital to
invest in 120 acres of Government
commonage land at Allora, paying
one-third of the purchase price in
and the balance in two
annual instalments; and in May,
1900, he augmented this purchase
by the selection under the
Repurchased Land Act of 166 acres
of the “Glengallan” Estate, adjoin-
ing the commonage farm. In the
following year Mr. Reid removed
from his 40-acre block to a new
homestead which he had erected on
the “Glengallan” property known as
“Mount Marshall,” and forthwith
planted corn and wheat, and

Glen Earn, Dunning, Perthshire,
Scotland, where the gentleman under
review was born on March 10, 1841.
He was educated at the public
schools of Dunning and Perth, leav-
ing the latter institution at 16 years
of age, and subsequently continued
his studies at evening classes for a
further two or three years, during
which time he gave special attention
to draughtsmanship for the purpose
of acquiring the necessary equipment
for carrying out the duties of a
carpenter and joiner, to which trade
he was apprenticed. After complet-
ing his indentures with the firm of
Messrs. Smilie & Wann, he remained
in the same firm until his twenty-
fourth year, when he left Scotland
MR. JAMES DOUGALL
for Australia by the clipper "Flying
Cloud,” reaching Moreton Bay on
February 1, 1864, after a voyage
extending over 100 days. Having
disembarked Mr. Dougall proceeded
to Ipswich, where he worked as a
journeyman in the joinery trade for
about six months. At the end of
this period he opened a business on
his own account in that town in
1866, removing to Allora, and com-
mencing as a contractor there on
March 1, subsequent to which date
he erected the first courthouse in the
district, the public school, and
teacher’s residence, besides many
other structures on behalf of private
persons. In 1871 Mr. Dougall joined
the late Mr. Francis Kates and Mr.
Robert Cook as junior partner and
manager in a milling enterprise, the
firm carrying on business under the
style of Kates and Company. Much
success attended his efforts in this
direction, the flour produced being
of such high quality as to command
the favour of the judges at Sydney,
Melbourne, and Brisbane shows, and
at the Colonial and Indian Exhibi-
tion held in London in 1886. In
1886 Mr. Dougall disposed of his
interest in this concern to the senior
partner, and turned his attention
to farming pursuits in the same dis-
trict (Allora), his operations includ-
ing the production of wFeat, lucerne,
and maize, dairying, and other
branches of mixed farming, in which
he secured returns of a highly satis-
factory nature. His homestead
block, “Kilburnie,” comprises an
area of 250 acres, the soil being
principally composed of a rich, black
loam. A second property owned by
Mr. Dougall lies some 20 miles dis-
tant from Allora, in the Goomburra
district, and has an area of 1,500
acres, which, under the management
of his eldest son, is devoted chiefly
to dairying and grazing, a milch
herd of 80 cows in addition to the
120 head of market cattle being
pastured on the estate, while pigs
are also raised in large numbers.

ever, is also carried on, large crops
of barley and oats being grown as
green fodder for the milking herd,
in addition to 120 acres under wheat
and a considerable area devoted to

piany public activities, and in
recognition of his services as alder-

was invested with mayoral honours
for two years. For many years he

became a pupil teacher in the Luton
Wesleyan Day School, where he
pursued his own studies so diligently
in the time set apart for that pur-
pose that he was successful in accom-
plishing the usual five years’
course in four years, receiving
the necessary certificates from the
authorities at the end of the
shorter period. Upon leaving Luton
he obtained an appointment as
assistant in the Wesleyan day school
at Bumby, and in 1861 and 1862
was a student at the Westminster

don, England, receiving in the latter
year the usual Government teachers’

master of a school in the parish of
Chalgrove, Bedfordshire, which he
conducted for a couple of years.
Mr. Deacon sailed from England
for Queensland in February, 1864,
by the ship “Legion of Honour,”
which narrowly escaped being
wrecked at Saldanha Bay, South
Africa. Upon arrival at Brisbane
on July 4 of that year, immediately
upon presenting his credentials he
was favourably received by the
Board of Education, and given the
appointment of head teacher of the
Goondiwindi State School, where he
remained for a term of nearly three
years. He was then transferred to
Allora, and six years later, in 1873,
retired from the teaching profession,
and has since combined commercial
pursuits with farming at the above
centre and at Elphinstone with very
successful results. Mr. Deacon has

the people of Allora in the year
1869 petitioned the Government of
the day to proclaim the town a
municipality, a project which was
successfully carried out. Mr. Katis
was elected first mayor, and Mr.
A. Cameron assumed the duties
of town clerk. By virtue of his pro-
fession as a teacher Mr. Deacon was
precluded from holding a position
as alderman, and was therefore
appointed auditor, but upon leaving
the Government service he was
immediately elected alderman, an
office which he held for 39
years, during which period he was
invested with mayoral honours on
eight separate occasions. In his first
term as mayor of Allora a consider-
able fillip was given to settlement in

acres of land which lay partly
within the municipality, and 40,000
acres at Jondaryan, and to this
circumstance much of the sub-
sequent prosperity of the centre
is attributable. As chairman he
supported the people of Allora in an
application to the Government for
a reserve for agricultural society
show grounds, and has ever since
been connected with this society,
which is one of the soundest in the
State. Mr. Deacon has on many
occasions represented the society at
the conferences of similar organiza-
tions held* in the State, and in Syd-
ney, Melbourne, and Adelaide. Be-
sides being connected with the Allora
Town Council, Mr. Deacon was also
a member of the Clifton Shire Coun-
cil for nine years, during four of
which he occupied the position of
chairman. With a few others he has
been instrumental in promoting the
local school of arte, and was made
a life member in recognition of his
valuable services to this institution,
of which he has been president on
various occasions. He is the second
senior magistrate in the district,
having received the Commission of
the Peace over 30 years ago. Upon
his retirement from public life his
fellow-townsmen in January, 1914,
presented him with an illuminated
address as a token of appreciation
of the valuable services he has ren-
dered to town and district. Mr.
Deacon has a family of three sons
and two daughters.

Country in 1856. After his arrival

in Queensland Mr. Erhart took a
position on a station, and subse-
quently for about three years was
engaged in the carrying business
between Brisbane and Warwick.
Eventually he settled down at
Allora, where he combined farming
interests with hotelkeeping, and
built the Royal Hotel in that
town, which he continued to con-
duct for a number of years, and
finally sold in order to devote the
whole of his attention to his farming
interests. He died in 1888, at the
age of 56, his widow surviving him
28 years. The late Mr. Erhart may
be termed one of the early pioneers
of Allora, and he co-operated
actively with a number of other
residents of the district in securing
the proclamation of the settlement
as a municipality in 1869, A very
liberal supporter of the Roman
Catholic Church in Allora, he took
a prominent part in the raising of
funds for this building, which is one
of the oldest churches in Queensland,
until recently being incorporated in
the parish of Warwick. The subject
of this notice, Mr. Joseph Erhart,
was the first white child born in
Allora, where he first saw the light
on July 4, 1862. He received his
education at the local State school,
under Mr. William Deacon, and at
the termination of his studies, at 14
years of age, he was employed by his
father in the Royal Hotel and on
the home farm, about two miles out
of the town, which is still in posses-
sion of the family. In 1886 he left
the parental rooftree, and for some
years was occupied in farm and
station pursuits on various proper-
ties, among which was included
"Goomburra” Station, which was used
by the owner for grazing stock. Mr.
Erhart was employed on this property
at the time the big flood of 1887
occurred, and for the succeeding
four years he devoted his attention
to timber-carting from the head of
the Goomburra Creek to Mr. A.
Gordon, Allora, for sawmilling pur-
poses. In 1893 be took a position
as under-stockman at "Glengallan”
with Mr. W. B. Slade, who held the
senior post, which afterwards was
occupied by Mr. Erhart, and in 1901
the latter gentleman became over-
seer of the station. In 1904 he
purchased a farm of 97 acres at
Allora, where he carried on farming
operations for two years, when finding
the place too small for his increasing
family he disposed of it, and entered
upon dairying operations on the
share system at Talgai West, on a
property owned by the Scottish
Investment Company. During the
seven years spent by Mr. Erhart in
this enterprise he was able to save
sufficient capital to purchase the
freehold of an improved farm, con-
sisting of 433 acres, formerly the
property of Mr. J. F. Boadle; and
in 1912 erected the present comfort-
able and commodious homestead,
situated about 18 miles distant from
Allora. Romantic and picturesque
surroundings for the home are
provided by the vicinity of the Dal-
rymple Creek, with well-timbered
hills rising on either side, and this
stream, which flows for a mile
through "Cressbrook,” is the chief
source of water supply for the estate
—a supply which has never been
known to fail. The water is pumped
from the creek by means of a

secured both for watering the stock
and for irrigation purposes. Rich,
black soil is a feature of the holding,
and this is found not only on the
flats but continues right up to the
crest of the hills, making it splendid
orchard country, the sunny slopes
being most favourable to the ripening
of various kinds of fruits. Here vines,

oranges, lemons, and plums come to
perfection, and form one of the

Mixed-farming operations are also
carried on successfully, about 150
acres being at present under cultiva-

Mr. Erhart has purchased a second
farm, comprising over 1,300 acres,
situated about eight miles from the
homestead, at the head of the Goom-
burra Creek, and this property he
uses for grazing purposes, 70 head
of cattle and draught and pony
stock of his own breeding being run
on these pastures. Mr. Erhart has
given a considerable amount of
attention to stock-breeding, and
from his original herd of imported
Jerseys, consisting of a bull (“Strad-
brooke King”) and three cows
("Priscilla,” "Sociable’s Priscilla,”
“Tirrara’s Maid”), has bred exten-
sively, and is now getting rid of the
less favoured type with the intention
of devoting his enterprise in this
direction exclusively to the Jersey.

in Stockport, England. Soon
after landing in Queensland (about
1864) he purchased a farm at Oxley
Creek, near Brisbane. He engaged
in mixed farming, at the time the
Brisbane market demand for farm
produce being very uncertain. For
about six years Mr. Dean continued
at Oxley Creekj when he decided to
sell out in order to extend opera-
tions. tie chose Ipswich as his new
scene of labour, taking up a farm
area on the Ipswich Reserve, about
15 miles from the city. Cotton-grow-
ing attracted Mr. Dean’s attention
for the subsequent six years, but not
satisfied with the return he sold the
farm and made a fresh move, this
time to an area on the Sandy Creek
Road, about three miles south of
Warwick, a district long celebrated
for its production of lucerne. This
venture proved most successful and
profitable, and it led to Mr. Dean’s
determination to settle permanently
in Warwick. He added to his
farm holdings, and opened a
carrying business in the town. Not
until he had reached his threescore
years and ten did he relinquish
active work, his impelling motive for
doing so being his desire to spend
his westering days near his son and
grandchildren at Allora. There he
spent about 12 years of calm, till
in his eighty-fourth year came
the last call. Mr. Dean was a pillar
of the Wesleyan Church, to which
he devoted all his spare time and
energy. As an ardent local preacher
he was widely known and revered,
and practically every important
office open to a layman in the Church
he had filled and adorned. Mr.
Dean’s son, James, was exactly 11
years of age when the “Ocean Chief”
dropped anchor in Moreton Bay.
He was born in Manchester on
November 2, 1851, a year memorable
because of the great exhibition of
textiles that was opened and which
did so much in promoting the export
trade in Manchester goods. At the
Portwood Wesleyan Methodist Day-
school in Stockport young Dean
received a solid primary education.
About two years before leaving school

injuring young Dean and killing
several of his schoolfellows. Natur-
ally the nerve-shaking experience is
vividly remembered by him. At
Oxley Creek only a very primitive
private school was available, and
before James was out of his teens his
father decided to put him to work
on the farm. Up to the age of 21
he remained with his father, learn-
ing all that was to be learned in
scientific farming and management.
Then came an event that changed,
moulded, made, or ruined so many
lives occurred. The Gympie goldfield
was discovered, and the famous rush
to it furiously set in. Mr. Dean was
smitten with the gold fever. He
went with the rush, but he was
amongst the myriads who drew
blanks. He worked underground,
he worked at timber getting, until
after a year’s experience he aban-
doned the field and rejoined his
father on the farm at Warwick.
There he met fresh misfortune. He
suffered a severe sunstroke, the
effects of which forced him ulti-
mately to abandon agricultural pur-
suits for the sphere of commerce.
He obtained employment with
Messrs. T. F. Merry & Company,
general storekeepers, in Toowoomba,
as delivery clerk, and at a later
period he was similarly employed by
F. H. Ilolberton & Company. From


this time on Mr. Dean’s fortunes
rose. He was invited to take a
position with the firm of Messrs.
G. P. Barnes & Company, at War-
wick, which business has since
grown to such imposing proportions.
Until January, 1887, he remained
at the Warwick branch, and then he
was transferred to the management
of the Allora branch. Not long after
this the firm was formed into a
limited liability company, and Mr.
Dean became one of the first share-
holders, remaining manager at
Allora. But he did not confine his
activities to his commercial work.
He has a farm of 184 acres on the
“Goomburra” repurchased estate,
which he works on the share system.
Mr. Dean has held many important
public positions, filling the mayoral
chair on two occasions, and is
regarded as one of Allora’s leading
men. He is a Justice of the Peace
for Queensland, New South Wales,
and Victoria. In October, 1879, he
married Mary Harding, daughter of
the late David Wyeth, of Too-
woomba, and has issue three sons
and two daughters.
Warwick.
Warwick is a prosperous agricultural and pastoral
town of nearly 7,000 inhabitants on the upper waters of
the Condamine River. The settlement was established in
1847, the site having been selected at the request of
the New South Wales Government by Patrick Leslie,
the first squatter to settle in what afterwards became
of trees. Near the centre are two blocks of 10 acres
each laid out as parks. The public and commercial
buildings are mostly substantial structures of brick or
stone, yielding an air of solidarity to the place and
telling their own tale of the prosperous and growing
nature of the industry in the surrounding country. A
first the colony and then the State of Queensland. The
native name of the locality was Gooragoody. The first
land was sold at Warwick on July 31, 1850, and the
town was incorporated on May 25, 1861. The distance
from Brisbane by rail is 169 miles. An altitude of
1,500 feet above sea-level gives a climate considerably
more temperate and bracing than that prevailing over
most of the other parts of Queensland.
The town itself is well laid out in broad streets,
which are plentifully planted with picturesque avenues
rr2
formation of sandstone is met with at the site of the
town, whilst the rich soil of the Darling Downs lies
immediately outside. The homestead of Canning
Downs, the first station to be permanently established
north of the present boundary with New South Wales,
and where Patrick Leslie lived, is within a quarter of
an hour’s drive of Warwick.
The establishment of Canning Downs is full of
interest. Leslie had heard of the rich Darling Downs
from his friend Allan Cunningham, the explorer, and

the first white man to see that fertile region. At that
time pastoral settlement had reached as far north from
Sydney as the New England district. Leslie set out
with others to find land in these northern parts, and
whilst his companions stopped within what is now New
South Wales he was not satisfied until he had pushed
on to the Condamine. Not at once did he settle at Can-
ning Downs, but that is where, within some months, he
finally founded his home. And here it was that, after-
wards aided by his brother and twenty-two ticket-of-
leave men, he had to protect his dwelling and his stock
from possible attacks from hostile blacks. "Canning
Downs” Station was established in 1840.
Agricultural industry has long been established
round Warwick. That is made apparent by the char-
acter of the homesteads. The holdings are smaller
than in most other parts of the State. Mixed
farming forms
the settled occu-
pation of the
smaller land-
holders. Butter
and wheat are
the chief pro-
ducts of the
district. Lucerne
flourishes luxuri-
antly, as indeed
is the case over
all the Darling
Downs. The
character of the
country yields
sjoecial advantages for dairying. Rich volcanic soil,
open plains, sheltered timbered hills, and an almost
unbroken evenness of fertility combine to facilitate the
production of cream.
The obstacle which has done most to baffle many of
the producers hitherto has lain in fluctuations of rain-
fall. The trouble is not so much that the quantity
received is abnormally light. Compared with other dis-
tricts on the interior side of the Divide, where wheat-
growing and dairying are carried on with almost
uninterrupted success, the annual rain at Warwick is
heavy, usually varying from about 23 to 28 inches.
It has been known to reach 35 inches, though in 1915
—a year of dryness unprecedented since first occu-
pation—only 15 inches were recorded at the State farm,
four miles from the town. Without scientific methods
of dry-farming the soil of the Warwick district, like
that of the rest of the Darling Downs, is peculiaily
unsuitable to withstand the effects of lengthy periods
of dry weather. As soon as the moisture disappeais
from the surface, the ground opens in cracks so freely
as to permit of the free circulation ot the air to a con-
siderable distance downwards. This causes speedy
evaporation, and, as the evaporation proceeds, so do
the cracks open wider and cut deeper. A few months
of dry weather bring a degree of aridity rarely met
with after so short a period of drought. Even lucerne,
so notorious for deep root-driving propensities, has been
known to die out of paddocks in which it had been
planted, after unusually long drought in the War-
wick district. Yet so heavy is the production in
good years that the Warwick landholders are
well able to withstand the ills of the worst
droughts the district suffers from. Nor is it at all
likely that the
effects of drought
will remain un-
lessened with
the steady march
onward of agri-
cultural effici-
ency. Were the
farmers in this
district but to
apply the
methods of dry-
farming, which
did so much in
increasing the
South Australian
wheat yield by 50 per cent, and in making
wheat-growing a reasonably safe enterprise in the
northern regions of Victoria, then the loss in-
curred from periods of aridity certainly would
be greatly reduced. The same remarks apply to
the conduct of the dairy industry. The traveller may
cover very many miles of the Darling Downs without
seeing a single silo. And yet, in the majority of years,
many thousands of tons of highly-nutritious feed go to
waste in the paddocks.
Gold, copper, and manganese have been found in
small quantities close to the town, whilst the presence
of considerable coal deposits at similarly easy distances
is matter of common local knowledge.
Warwick, itself on the main line bebtween Brisbane
and Sydney, is the depot for branch railways to
Dirranbandi, Killarney, and Maryvale.

DANIEL CONNOLLY, J.P., of
the firm of Dornbusch & Connolly,
W 7 arwick, Queensland, was born at
Cork, Ireland, in the year 1870, and
is the eldest son of Mr. Timothy
Connolly, who prior to his advent to
Australia, was engaged in farming
pursuits in the Emerald Isle. Act-
ing on the advice of his brother,
Denis Connolly, who had preceded
him to this continent, he came to
Queensland by the ship “Isamora”
in 1877, and shortly afterwards
found employment in railway con-
struction work for a time, which he
abandoned in favour of farming on
his own account. His venture in
this direction was made in the War-
wick district, where he met with
success, and having amassed a fair
amount of capital sold out and in-
vested in town properties in War-
wick, at which centre he now resides
in well-earned retirement. The sub-
ject of this notice, Mr. Daniel Con-
nolly, attended school in the above-
mentioned town until his sixteenth
year, when he was apprenticed to
the building trade, and after com-
pleting his indentures opened in
business as a builder and contractor,
being responsible for many of the
chief buildings in Warwick. About
1911 he entered into partnership

mile from the Warwick railway sta-

acres half a mile beyond this culti-
vation field, where he carries on
Creek, about 40 miles distant from
Toowoomba. This fine property is
used mainly as a grazing area for
cattle and for horse-breeding pur-
poses, Clydesdales being the type
favoured on the station. Mr. Con-
nolly has made his influence felt in
the neighbourhood where he has
spent the major part of his life, hav-
ing been very active in the public
life of the town and district. For
twelve years he has occupied a seat
on the Warwick Municipal Council,
to which he was returned at every
successive election; while in 1910 his
fellow-ratepayers paid him the high-
est compliment within their power
by endowing him with mayoral
honours, a post which he filled with
success during his year of office. He
interests himself in the matter of
education for the youth of the dis-
trict, acting as a member of the local
School Committee, and is well known
as a devotee of sport, his reputation
in this direction having won for him
the presidency of the Warwick Turf

of the most progressive of its kind in
Queensland. Stakes are arranged

ALEXANDER FREDERICK
GILLESPIE, of “Glengallan,” War-

been born at Hawthorn, near
Moore, Brisbane.
MR. ALEXANDER GILLESPIE.
Melbourne, on November 17, 1881,
his father, Mr. Alexander Gillespie,
sen., being a member of the well-
known firm of Messrs. Gillespie
received his primary education at
the Essendon Grammar School, con-
cluding his scholastic studies at the
Cumloden College, East St. Kilda,
which he attended until the attain-
ment of his seventeenth birthday.
In 1899 he became a student at the
Ballarat School of Mines, and con-
tinued his association with this
institution for four years, during
which he took a complete course in
metallurgy and assaying. Upon
leaving this important mining
centre, where he gained much valu-
able experience in the industry, Mr.
Gillespie proceede4 to New South
Wales, where for some time he
occupied the position of assayer and
chemist on the Gulf Creek Proprie-
tary Limited Copper Mines, in the
Barraba district. In 1904 he decided
to relinquish mining pursuits in
favour of land settlement, and in
conjunction with his mother and
eldest brother took up a property of
650 acres, being a portion of the
widely-known original ‘‘Glengallan”
Estate, situated about 10 miles dis-
tant from the town of Warwick, on
the main southern railway line, and
some 160 miles from the Queensland
capital. For about two years the
brothers carried on operations in
partnership, but eventually the
elder man withdrew, since which

banks of these watercourses have
been planted numerous weeping
willows, which when in frill leafage
give a most picturesque appearance
to the landscape. The indigenous
timber consists principally of red
gum, box, and appletree, but almost
all the original forest has been
cleared away, only a few clumps of
trees being left here and there to
serve as shade for the stock on what
is now all open grazing land or
cultivation fields. An average rain-
fall of 29J inches registered during
the past 40 years has given good

permanently-running creeks already
referred to, provide all that is neces-
sary in the direction of water
conservation and supply. Natural
grasses and herbage have sprung up
in abundance since the removal of
the big timber, and these are of a
very nutritious character, including
the popular clover, crowsfoot, etc.,
which are sought after with avidity
by the stock. The vivid note of
green which prevails over almost
half the area of “Glengallan”
Estate proclaims the fact that the
proprietor has discovered the profit-
able nature of lucerne cultivation,
and is making the most of his dis-
covery. Having studied the most
approved methods of culture, Mr.
Gillespie generally crops the ground
for two years with wheat and corn
before sowing the fodder plant, and
he has found it an excellent system
after the lucerne has gained a
secure hold to stir up the surface
soil about every 12 months by means
of harrows or cultivators. The crop
is prolific and of very quick growth,
usually about seven cuttings annually
being taken off the fields, with an
average yield of some 15 cwt. to the
acre at each cutting. While at
present there are 300 acres under
cultivation of lucerne, it is the inten-
tion of Mr. Gillespie shortly to
devote another 100 acres to this
department of his industry—a sure
proof of the lucrative possibilities
hound up in these emerald stretches.
Lamb-raising has been successfully
carried on for some few years, and
the estate at present carries about
300 breeding ewee, the clean-bodied
merinoes being crossed with Romney
Marsh and Lincoln rams. There are
two lambing seasons in the year, the
earlier occurring in January and the
later about July, and the average
result of the two drops is in the
vicinity of 80 per cent. each. These
crossbred lambs are bred for the
local markets, and also for the
frozen export trade with Great
Britain and other places. In addi-
tion to these avenues of enterprise
Mr. Gillespie has given so large a
share of his attention to the breeding
of Berkshire pigs that he has estab-
lished a reputation for being one
of the largest producers of this class
of stock in the State. From 80 to
100 sows are kept for breeding pur-
poses, and a man is employed
entirely for the purpose of looking
after the grunters, keeping them in
separate divisions, and feeding them
on scientific principles, which have
been found to materially improve
the quality of the bacon. In the
improvement scheme is included
the erection of modern and
convenient yards, pens, etc., by
means of which the whole depart-
ment will be brought under the most
economical and favourable condi-
tions. When first the property was
acquired by Mr. Gillespie dairying
was occupying a prominent place
among the industries carried on in
this district, and a big portion of
the “Glengallan” area was told off
to serve as a pasture land for the
herd of 30 shorthorn cows, which
was crossed with a bure-bred
Jersey strain, and presented a hand-
some picture of bovine contentment.
Some inqoorted pure-bred Ayrshires
—three cows, four heifers, and a
bull—also helped to establish the
prestige of the estate, their progeny
being large prizewinners at various
Allora and Warwick shows. Dairy-
ing, however, has now been relin-
quished in favour of the more
profitable lucerne-growing. A vast
amount of improvement work has
been accomplished on “Glengallan”
Estate, which is divided into about
27 paddocks by seven-wire fences,
which frequently have the extra
protection of wire-netting, smaller
enclosures being made with three-
foot paling fences finished with a
wire at the top. A substantial
fence defines the boundary of the
property, constructed partly with
two rails and netting and partly
with the ordinary seven-wires. Each
of the paddocks is supplied with,
water for the stock, either from the
running creeks or from the wells
before-mentioned, a windmill being
used for pumping purposes, and ball
taps installed in connection with
the troughing. The stockyards are
built of palings, with a main crush
pen and a race which
enables the sheep to be drafted in
these yards, which are up-to-date in
every particular. Roomy stables
have their place on the homestead
area, consisting of three loose boxes,
with the usual accessories of feed-
room and harness-room, also a buggy
shed capable of accommodating three
vehicles. A couple of six-roomed
cottages have been erected in con-
venient localities for the use of
married men and their families who
are engaged in work on the pro-
perty. The machinery for carrying

labour-saving appliance in the shape
of an end-delivery hay rake has
been introduced to great advantage.
The situation of “Glengallan” is
greatly in its favour as regards rail-
way facilities, no less than four
railway stations lying withing easy
distance of the homestead, via
Warwick (10 miles), Hendon (8
miles), Allora (6 miles), and Free-
stone (5 miles). The near vicinity of
the last named centre is of special
significance, inasmuch as it lies on
the direct route, known as “Via
Recta,” between Warwick and Bris-
bane, which when the line is
completed will become the main route
from Sydney to the northern capital,
shortening the journey from War-
wick by about 60 miles. The "Glen-
gallan” residence is approached by a
winding drive of over a quarter of
a mile in length, from the Warwick-
Toowoomba road, the magnificent
pine trees lining either side of the
drive forming an avenue hardly to
be surpassed in beauty and majesty.
A well-arranged landscape garden
fronts the substantial freestone man-
sion, which was erected as far back
as 1867 on a most lavish scale, and
is regarded as one of the notable
pastoral homes of the State, the
walls being of cut stone, and the
woodwork of the most costly charac-
ter. Wide verandahs and a balcony
of over 120 feet in length provide
ideal conditions for existence during
the long months of the Queensland
summer, and while the apartments
on the upper storey catch every
breeze that blows, the rooms on the
ground floor are protected by those
above them from the strong heat of
the sun’s most powerful rays. The
interior of the house is spacious and
lofty, and all the conveniences have
been carried out on the most modern
lines, spite of which the charm of
an "old world” atmosphere has been
preserved, both the appearance and
appointments of the home suggest-
ing in some subtle manner the
dignity and large comfort of an
old English manor house. Standing

from its balcony most magnificent
views of landscape scenery near and
distant, the estate itself, the beauty
of which is greatly enhanced by the
presence of a number of ornamental
English trees in addition to the
native timber, providing many pic-
tures very pleasing to the eye. A
neat jhcket fence of about 270 yards
surrounds the garden area, broken
by a substantial gateway constructed
with stone pillars and iron gates;
and among the attractions of the
place may be mentioned a pretty
fernery, where fronded beauty riots
under skilful tendance; and a small
vineyard, valued both for its luscious
clusters in fruitage time and for the
autumn tints which lend glory to
the approach of winter on "Glen-
gallan.” Irrigation over the home-
stead enclosure and adjacent small
paddocks is carried out by means of
jaipes supplied with water from
elevated tanks, which are filled with
the aid of a force-pump from con-
veniently-situated wells. Mr. Gil-
lespie is a very hospitable host, and
a tour of inspection round the
estate gives the visitor an excellent
idea of what may be accomplished
in this district by enterprise and
ability. In course of conversation
his interest in athletics displays
itself, and it is interesting to note
that from his earliest days of college
life at St. Kilda he has put up a
good sports record. At Ballarat he
distinguished himself in quite a
number of different directions, win-
ning renown as a champion athlete
of his school in running and high-
jumping, achieving premier results
in hurdle-racing, and being much
sought after both i ( n the cricket and
football fields. In 1902 he won the
school’s cycling road race in fast
time; and he is generally recognized
as an excellent tennis player.


JAMES ANGUS McINTOSH,
J.P., “Yundah,” Mountside, via
Warwick, was born on October 15,
1873, on the old homestead widely
known as “Blink Bonnie,” at Free-
stone, near Warwick. He is the
second son of the late James Mcln-
tosh, a native of Nairn, Scotland,

came to New South Wales in 1854

by the old sailing ship “William
Miles,” and gained his first colonial
experience on the Darling Downs.
Later on, James Mclntosh came to
“Glengallan” as sheep overseer, and
whilst acting in this capacity also
undertook the superintendence of
the cattle on the run. His expert
knowledge of the wool industry was
of immense value to his employers,
who showed their appreciation of his
services when, upon the occasion of
his marriage, they made him the
handsome present of a flock of 1,000
ewes. He always took an active in-
terest in the public affairs of the
day, especially those of the district
in which he resided, and accepted
the Commission of the Peace, which
lie exercised with judgment and dis-
cretion. In matters of local govern-
ment he took a leading part, and
was looked upon as the father of the
Rosenthal Shire Council, to which,
in the public interest, he gave his
attention with unflagging zeal. He
was decisive in his measures when
necessity arose, and to him may be
accorded the credit of averting many
a financial crisis when the danger of
such occurred in the early days of
the history of that organization. He
died in 1899, at the age of 74, leav-
ing six sons and daughters, to whom
he bequeathed the priceless legacy of
a widely-respected name and an
honoured memory. James Angus
Mclntosh in his early youth at-
tended the Freestone Public School,
and later completed his studies at
Swan Creek, in the same district.
At the age of 17, in conjunction
with his elder brother, Mr. William
Mclntosh, he assisted in the working
of his father’s property on the share
system, and continued in this con-
nection until the decease of the late
Mr. Mclntosh. A division of the
property was then made, and in
1900 he settled down to grazing and
stock-raising pursuits on his allotted
portion, situated about 13 miles
from Warwick, and comprising a
grazing: area of some 4,500 acres.
o o '
“Yundah,” by which name the es-
tate has been called, consists chiefly
of gently-undulating country, tim-
bered with ironbark and gum, and
is considered one of the choicest
pasture areas in the district. Watered
by a running creek and a couple of
wells, from which the water is
pumped by means of windmills, it
has stood the strain of more than
one serious drought, making it speci-
ally valuable for stock-raising pur-
poses. In the first instance, sheep
were introduced to these paddocks
by the owner as the most profitable
proposition, but subsequently it be-
came recognized that the country was
more specially adapted to cattle, and
the flock was disposed of to make
room for a herd, the success of
which has abundantly justified the
change of policy thus initiated. It
is the intention of Mr. Mclntosh to
establish a stud, and it must cor-
dially be admitted that he has
already made a very successful be-
ginning towards the accomplishment
of this object, having now on
the farm the nucleus of what
bids fair to develop into one
of the finest herds of pure-
bred cattle in Southern Queensland.

some of the best blood from the Glen
Innes district, in New South Wales,
Mr. Mclntosh watched his oppor-
tunity slowly to increase the number


of his stud, improvement in quality
always being made the premier con-
sideration. At a recent date he con-
cluded negotiations for the purchase
of “Heather Duke,” bred by Mr.
H. B. Williams, the well-known
breeder of Polled Angus cattle at
Gisborne, New Zealand. This bull,
which secured second prize in the
champion section at Hawke Bay
Show, New Zealand, is by “Duke of
Argyle” from the dam “Bertha,”
whose pedigree extends back for
many generations to the sire

gyle”—names familiar to judges

industry has obtained a footing.
With “Heather Duke” it is Mr.
Mclntosh’s confident expectation to
do great things, and much interest
attaches to his experiment with the
New Zealand champion which boasts
so distinguished a pedigree. The
“Yundah” homestead, where Mr.
Mclntosh resides with his family,
was erected by the proprietor in
1908, and stands on a well-chosen
site, of sufficient elevation to com-
mand a good view of the surround-
ing country. It is of modern design
and is attractive in appearance, with
an interior where the convenience
and comforts regarded as necessities
by present-day settlers have received
every attention. Mr. Mclntosh
always displays a lively concern in
all matters pertaining to the ad-
vancement and well-being of the
district, and has followed in the
footsteps of his father in the
active and prominent part he
has played as a member of the
Rosenthal Shire Council for about
eight years, during a portion of

the principal events on the metro-
politan courses in ISTew South Wales.
In another line of sport Mr. Mcln-
tosh excels, being a keen pigeon
shot, and various trophies won in
connection with clubs in Brisbane
and other places testify to his skill
in this direction. He is a member
of the public school committee and
is vice-president of the Warwick
Caledonian Society. He married, in
1900, Annie Bertha, eldest daughter
of the late Mr. P. G. Lucas, who
for many years was engaged as a
teacher in connection with the State
Education Department at Mountside,
and has a family of three sons and
three daughters.

Inglewood, in the year 1868, and is
the youngest son of the late Philip

the oldest families in Australia, his
grandfather having come to the
island continent in the very earliest
days of its settlement. Philip De-

a young man he came north with

his wife, the trip being made over-
land from New South Wales to the
Mclntyre River, where he first
turned his attention to pastoral
pursuits, and at subsequent periods
he acted as manager of “Ena” and
“Tucka Tucka” Stations on behalf
of Captain Russell, retaining the
latter position for many years. He
married, at Wilberforce, in 1844,
Elizabeth Ann, second daughter of
the late Charles Homer Martin, an
early pioneer of the Hawkesbury
River, New South Wales, and at his
death at Warwick in 1888 he was
survived by this lady, who still (1916)
resides at the last-mentioned town,
being hale and hearty at the ripe
age of 92 years. The gentleman
under review received his education
at the Toowoomba Grammar School,
where he continued until his
eighteenth year, when, partly for
health reasons, he proceeded to Hor-
ton College, Tasmania, and spent
about six months in study at this
institution. From there he came to
Warwick to take over the manage-
ment of “Bodumba” Station, one
of his father’s properties, which post
he retained for some 20 years. The
“Bodumba” estate originally com-
prised an area of 200 square miles,
but the prickly pear pest made such
serious encroachments on this large
tract of country, and the depreda-
tions of the numerous native
dogs caused so many losses among
the stock that when the lease fell
in for the greater part of the area it
was subdivided into smaller holdings
by the Government, and at the pre-
sent time most of the old station
area is occupied by selectors, who
are working blocks on their own
account. After selling the whole
of “Bodumba” in 1904, he pur-
chased a grazing farm at Pikedale
known as “Melva,” and started it
as a sheep station, ringbarking the
timber, which consisted chiefly of

improvement work of a highly com-
prehensive nature. This estate,
which comprises 5,000 acres, has an
excellent permanent water supply in
the running creeks which intersect
its paddocks, and is good pastoral
country, capable of carrying about
5,000 sheep all the year round.
About nine years ago, in 1907, Mr.
Devine came to take up his residence
in the town of Warwick, and has
since made his home at “Killowen,”
a choice little property, which occu-
pies one of the best positions on the
outskirts of the town. Mr. Devine
is fond of sport, and has associated
himself with the various organiza-
tions for the promotion of horse-
racing in the district, being a mem-
ber of the Warwick Club and of the
Warwick Picnic Race Club. He
married, in 1908, Beatrix, daughter
of Mr. H. Kenny, of “Koreela”
Station, New South Wales, and has
four sons.
ROBERT BURGESS, Mountside,
near Warwick, is a descendant of
one of the early pioneers of Southern
Queensland, in the person of the late

years before separation placed the

pendent footing. George Burgess

was a native of Banffshire, Scotland,
where he had tilled his own farm
before emigrating to Australia.
After arrival in this country, he
was employed on “Rosenthal” Sta-
tion, and later on at “Canning
Downs” and “Glengallan” Stations.
In 1869 he became one of the first
selectors on “Rosenthal” Station,
about 6,000 acres with a carry-
ing capacity of 1,000 head of
cattle. Among the early and most
necessary improvement work was the
ringbarking of the indigenous tim-
ber and arrangements for the conser-
vation of water on an adequate
scale, the supply provided by three
permanent creeks being augmented
by the construction of several tanks
or reservoirs. The position of the
estate as one of the choicest grazing
properties of the district has con-
tinued unchallenged up to the pre-
sent time, and although various
changes have been made in the lead-
ing features of the enterprise—
sheep-raising and wool-growing now
having given place to cattle and
horses—it is a recognized fact that
prosperity follows with steady march
the evolution of industry on this
excellent grazing farm. George Bur-
gess, after an active and strenuous
career, died in 1897, at the age of
57. The gentleman under review
received his early education at
Mountside Public School, later at-
tending the school at Sandy Creek,
where he completed his studies. At
15 he took up duties on the home
farm, and has spent practically the
whole of his life in pursuits pertain-
ing to the working of the fine pro-
perty established on so firm a foun-
dation by his late father. From his
boyhood Mr. Burgess has taken a
keen interest in the care and
management of stock, and his ser-
vices in horse-breeding soon became

department he has been most suc-
cessful, and with the champion
hackney “Spark” he has secured
many prizes at agricultural shows,

proves an object-lesson to all those
desiring to profit by the methods and
experience which have wrought such
good results.


WILLIAM COLLINS, J.P.,
“Collinora,” Warwick, was born in
1848 on the historic “Canning
Downs” Station, in the neighbour-
hood of the above-mentioned town,
MR. JOHN COLLINS.
and claims the distinction of being
the first European child to open his
eyes to the light in that district,
where at close on threescore years and
ten he still (1916) resides. He is the
eldest son of the late John Collins,
a native of Oxfordshire, England,
whose father, having had some
military training with the well-
known “Buffs,” formed one of a
band of soldiers chosen from that
regiment to guard a shipload of
convicts bound for Australia at the
beginning of the nine-
teenth century. John Col-
lins, who was only three
years old at the time of
his arrival in Sydney, New
South Wales, came to the
Darling Downs in 1842,
and entered the employ
of the Leslie family at
“Canning Downs,” receiv-
ing a remuneration of
£25 per annum, with
double rations. At that
time the town of Warwick
was not yet in existence,
but settlement was going
forward, and in 1848 the
enterprising young Britisher
opened the first hotel
(the Horse and Jockey)
in the district, on the site
where the present Commercial
Hotel now stands. The late Mr.
Collins, who took an active interest
in the development of this portion
of the Darling Downs, died in 1901
institutions at Warwick, and served
as an alderman of the town council for
15 years, during which he occupied
the mayoral office for one term. He

at the advanced age of 84 years,
being survived by four of his
children. It is worthy of mention
that the first Church of England
service was held in the hostelry con-
ducted by Mr. Collins, the officiating
clergyman being the Rev. Benjamin
Glennie; and there also the Roman
Catholics of the neighbourhood
gathered for the celebration of Mass
by Father McGinty. Mr. William
Collins received his early education
at East Warwick, and later
became a pupil of Mr. Carvosso,
who kept a school in Elizabeth
Street, Brisbane. After complet-
ing his course at this institution, he
returned to Warwick, and for a
time assisted his father on a farm
at Deuchar’s Creek, known as
“Collinsville.” Later he tried metro-
politan life, but finding the country
more suited to his taste, once more
took up his abode in the district of
his birth, establishing a butchering
business at Warwick. During the
lengthy period of 45 years that he
carried on operations in this line of
trade he earned and retained the
highest reputation as a man of strict
integrity and sound commercial
principles. He was successful in a
marked degree, and ultimately
found himself in a position to retire
from the business, which he placed
in the hands of his sons, who have
continued its conduct with equally
good results. Since that time lie has
lived in retirement at “Collinora,”
interesting himself in the life of the
town and district, and spending the
evening of his days in well-deserved
prosperity and peace. At one time
or another of his 45 years of resi-
dence Mr. Collins has been associ-

JOHN DAVIS ROWLAND,

in the year 1881 at Stanthorpe, on
the southern border of Queensland.
He is the second son of the late
MR. J. E. B. ROWLAND.

name associated with many of the
progressive movements of Warwick,
who, born in 1849 at Kidlington,
near Oxford, in England, came to
"CROMER,” RESIDENCE OF MR. J. D. ROWLAND, EAST WARWICK.
Queensland in 1872, and attracted
by the possibilities of the tin-mining
district of Stanthorpe, proceeded to
that centre, where he remained for
some considerable time. During his
residence here he opened in business
as an ironmonger, and carried on
successfully. In 1892 he took up his
residence in Warwick, and in the
following year, with some partners
embarked on a general storekeeping
business, in which he retained an
interest until 1896, when the part-
nership was dissolved. Mr. Rowland
in 1898 opened an ironmongery store
on his own account in a commanding
position in the principal street of
Warwick, and succeeded in building
up a substantial business connection.
Of a retiring disposition, he always
showed disinclination to push him-
self to the front in affairs of public
importance, but in every movement
having for its object the good of the
general community, he was always
a strong supporter. His demise,
which occurred in November, 1901,
in the fifty-third year of his age,
was the signal for general regret
among the wide circle of friends
and acquaintances with whom he
had been associated. The gentleman
under review, Mr. John Davis
Rowland, was educated at the War-
wick Public School, completing his
studies at 17 years of age. He then
joined his late father in the business
he had established in Warwick,
and upon the death of the late
Mr. Rowland assumed the responsi-
bilities of management. Since the
foundation of the store in 1898, the
sound business ability of Mr. Row-
land has been amply demonstrated,
and his up-to-date house is regarded
as one of the progressive business
concerns of the town. Outside of his

own private proposition, he was for
five years a director of the Warwick
Gas Company. Mr. Rowland has
been an active force in the public
life of Warwick, and among the
many offices 'which he has
occupied may be men-
tioned those of alderman
in the town council and
committeeman of the
ambulance society. He is
also a committeeman and
chief inside steward of the
Eastern Downs Horticul-
tural and Agricultural
Association, and takes a
keen interest in horticul-
ture, his efforts in this
direction having received
recognition in 1915 by the
award of first prize from
the Warwick Horticultural
Society for the best villa
garden. He was also suc-
cessful in winning the Sweet-
pea Cup at the horticul-
tural show of 1915. He
has two brothers at the
front, one serving in the
Engineering Corps and
the other in the Motor
Ambulance Cbrps. Mr.
Rowland married in 1912
Annie Eleanor, daughter of
the late Samuel Benson McGowan,
a one-time manager of “Canning

family. By dint of steady persever-
ance and industry he continued to
add to his acreage from time to time,
and at the date of his demise had
acquired a valuable property of
about 6,000 acres. Though low
prices were then ruling for wool, he
kept his pastures stocked with sheep,
and had the satisfaction of seeing his
judgment vindicated in this respect
by the ultimate success of his ven-
ture. After a life which must corn-
mand admiration for the patient
endurance of much hardship which it
presented, the late Mr. Stevens
passed the Great Divide in 1883 at
the comparatively early age of 52,
being survived by a widow and
family of three children. The
subject of this notice received his
early education at the Mountside
public school, which he was com-
pelled to leave at the age of 12, the
exigencies of the period calling for
his assistance on his father’s farm.
After the death of the latter gentle-
man, as he was still a junior, his
share of the property was held in
trust for him until he attained the

age of 18 years, when he entered
upon manhood’s estate and assumed
the charge of his portion of the
patrimony, which consisted of an
area of about 3,000 acres of undulat-
ing forest country, situated some
12 miles distant from Warwick, a
good road running between the
“Rookwood” property and the town.
It is watered by a couple of freely-
flowing freshwater streams, known
respectively as Sandy and Iron Pot
Creeks, and a great deal of substan-
tial improvement work has been car-
ried out, ringbarking operations
being completed, and the whole of
the estate fenced and subdivided into
about 30 paddocks of varying size.
“Rookwood” is a mixed-stock pro-
position, sheep and cattle and a few
horses being depastured on the run,
which during the past few years has
been considerably enlarged, the


original area now being doubled,
with a thousand acres to spare,
h rom 3,000 to 4,000 sheep are shorn
annually, and the shearing-shed, a
very substantial building, con-
structed of timber native to the dis-
trict, is well appointed, being fitted
with stands for four shearers, wool
bins, engine-room, and all necessary
conveniences for carrying on the
work by machinery. In 1915 Mr.
Stevens obtained some of the
highest prices for the season in
Southern Queensland, some of the
■Rookwood’ clip realizing as high
as per lb. He has also been
an exhibitor of horses, chiefly of
the hackney type, winning prizes in
this class. Although the major
share of attention has been given to
stock, the cultivation of the soil has
not been altogether neglected, and
the 12 acres of lucerne, which pre-
sents a flourishing appearance, is
sufficient to provide fodder for a
large number of working horses.
Fronting the homestead is a small
orchard and vineyard, the well-
cared-for aspect of which is a good
indication of the interest Mr. Ste-
vens takes in fruit culture; in this
now stands, has assumed its present
appearance as a result of various

MR. ALEXANDER HALL.
As a youth he studied land survey-
ing and the work of mill-wrighting
in its various branches, and made
sufficient headway in the trade to be
entrusted with the construction of
weirs for the conservation of water
to be used as driving power for all
classes of machinery. He also
erected the machinery used in con-
nection with these reservoirs. In
addition to his other interests he
was also engaged in farming, and
brought his knowledge and skill to
bear upon the pressing problem
which was then exercising the intel-
ligence of many of his fellow-agri-
culturists, of how to minimize the
cost of draining the land for
cultivation purposes. Mr. Hall hit
upon the expedient of using horses
and bullocks for the work of excavat-
ing the drains to a depth of 30
inches, which previously had been
done by hand labour; by this means
the cost of the work was reduced by
nearly one-half. He was about the

first man in Scotland to export
black-polled cattle to the London
market from his county, Aberdeen,
whence the animals were transported
per steamer. Eventually Mr. Hall
disposed of his property in Scotland
and commenced farming pursuits in
Berkshire, England, but after a
sojourn of only about 12 months in
this portion of Britain he decided
to emigrate to Queensland. He
sailed for Moreton Bay by the
“John Fielding,” a vessel to which
he was wont disrespectfully to
refer to as “an old tub.” After a
voyage of three months’ duration,
she landed her passengers at their
destination on June 11, 1853, and
Thomas Hall forthwith became
engaged in the pastoral industry,
filling successive positions as overseer
on various station properties in the
southern part of Queensland. His

erecting weirs in connection with the
sheep-washing pools on the Conda-
mine River at “Canning Downs”
Station was regarded as a departure
of considerable importance, and
gained him much credit. He also
pioneered the construction of weirs

for the purpose of producing water-
power sufficient to drive machinery
in the sawmills of that district, the
initial effort of this nature being
accomplished by him on behalf of
the late John Affleck, who, one of


the original settlers of the State,
was responsible for the erection of
the first sawmill on the Downs.
Later on Mr. Hall was farming
on his own account, and with
several other progressive spirits
experimented in the growing of
wheat on the Darling Downs in the
early sixties. His death occurred in
1877. The subject of this memoir,
a Thomas Hall of a younger genera-
tion, was born in Banffshire, Scot-
land, on November 6, 1844, and for
some years pursued his primary
studies in the place of his birth.
His education was continued in
Berkshire, England, and after
arrival in Queensland he completed
his scholastic course at Warwick.
For five years he found employ-
ment at the hands of the
old pioneer sheepbreeders on the
Darling Downs, and became profi-
cient in the handling and manage-
ment of all kinds of stock. This
period was succeeded by a term in
the carrying business on the route
between Ipswich and Warwick,
during which time he also inter-
ested himself in farming pursuits.
In 1870 he became identified
with the timber industry at
Emu Creek, 25 miles east of War-
wick. He, with his brothers, erected
the first sawmill on Emu Creek, and
later on built the first sawmill at
Allora, business being carried on
under the title of Hall Bros, supplies
of timber being obtained from the
head of Dalrymple Creek. Mr. Hall
also pioneered the industry of cedar-
cutting from the Tableland Moun-
tain, on the territory between the
upper reaches of the Condamine
River and Emu Creek, making what

is known as a “shoot” down the side
of a mountain 1,700 feet in height,
by means of which the timber was
carried by its own impetus from top
to bottom. He continued in the
timber industry until 1901, when he
ss2
purchased his present holding on the
subdivision of the “Canning Downs”
Station in 1902. The farm possesses
an area of 297 acres, lying about 12
miles from Warwick, on the main
road to Killarney, the nearest railway
station being Tannymorel, some four
miles distant from the property,
which is interesected by the waters
of Farm Creek. Deep alluvial soil
is found throughout the farm area,
which boasts 200 acres of first-class
lucerne land, of which 100 acres is
already jrianted. Another 100 acres
is devoted to the cultivation of wheat
and maize, and the remainder is
used by Mr. Hall for dairying pur-
poses. In addition to the creek
already mentioned, the land is well
watered by two wells each about 38
feet in depth. Both wells are fitted
with a windmill, which lifts the water
to the surface, and the usual facilities
in the way of tanks, troughing, etc.,
are installed. The property is well
fenced with posts and barbed wires,
and is subdivided into 13 paddocks
of convenient size for cultivation
and stock purposes. On an aver-
age 20 cows are milked regularly,
and the farm also carries a few
cattle for the market, sheep, and
horses. Horsebreeding obtains a
share of attention, and has proved
very profitable, good Clydesdale
stock being raised from the champion
sire “Blaze,” and some fine Suffolk
Punches testifying to Mr. Hall’s
success as a breeder of draughts.

Many improvements have been made
on the farm, among which may be
mentioned the residence, which is a
well-appointed home, containing
nine rooms, with the usual conveni-
ences, special attention having been
given to an up-to-date bathroom,
pantries, and a first-class dairy. The
outbuildings consist of a substantial
barn, a hay shed, machinery shed,
milking sheds, wheelwright and
blacksmith’s shop, and stable,
and the most modern machinery
is used in the various departments
of work, and in particular attention
is attracted by the “Sunshine” har-
vester, which has been proved a
signal success in the harvesting of
the wheat crop. From time to time
experiments have been made in the
cultivation of grapes and stone
fruits with good results, Mr.
Hall’s conviction being that the
land is well suited to orchard pur-
poses. To spend a day at “Strath-
more” is most enjoyable. Mr. Hall
is an authority with regard to the
aboriginals of the Darling Downs,
and on various other subjects
reveals a truly encyclopedic fund of
knowledge. He is remarkable for
his unusual stature and athletic
build, standing six feet four and a
half inches in his stocking feet, and
at one time was regarded as one of
the champion athletes of Queens-
land, excelling in heavy-weight
lifting, heavy-weight throwing, and
high jumping. He married in 1875
Jane, daughter of the late William
Tulloch, the issue being three sons
and eight daughters. The farm is
now managed by his two sons,
Messrs. Thomas and Alexander Hall.

brought amongst her passengers the
late Peter Peterson, father of Mr.

years of age. He had come all the
way from Glasgow with his father
and other members of the family.
After leaving school he was trained

by his father in agriculture, farm-
ing, and dairying. In 1874 the family
took up a new home in the famous
Taranaki district, settling at Haw-
era, which is about 48 miles to the
south of New Plymouth. In that
district Mr. Peterson purchased a
farm of 400 acres in extent, at a
place called Spring Hill, and
engaged in dairying and cattle-
raising as well as in mixed farming,
In 1875 he established a butter and
cheese factory, catering for local
requirements, and exporting his
surplus production. Indeed, Mr.
Peterson was the pioneer of the New
Zealand butter export trade, for he
sent the first shipment of New
Zealand butter to the London mar-
ket in 1890. That was in the pre-
refrigerator days, and one-half of
the shipment was melted to oil
beneath the heat of the equator,
though when colder conditions pre-
vailed as the ship sped northward it
hardened, but, of course, its quality
had lamentably deteriorated. But
the fact remains that New Zealand’s
present enormous export trade in
butter had this small beginning. To
Mr. Peterson’s father also belongs
the distinction of being the first in
the Taranaki district to use a cream
separator. It was regarded as a
curiosity, and like Katisha’s elbow
people used to come from far and
near to view it, much marvelling at
its effectiveness. Mr. P. J. Peter-
son was born at Dunedin on
September 2, 1870. He was edu-
cated at Hawera Public School, his
course ending when he was 15 years
of age. He then helped in the
work of farm and factory, and
for 15 years was his father’s right-
hand man. He managed the factory,
which was turning out 350 lbs. of
butter per day. In summer the

output was restricted to cheese. The
dairy herd numbered about 400
specially selected animals. During
these 15 years, however, Mr. Peter-
son did not neglect mental acquisi-
tions, for he studied by the aid of
“Cassell’s Popular Educator.” He
mastered geometry and algebra and
the higher principles of languages.

But in 1899 his health became indif-
ferent, so he came to Queensland to
recuperate. So taken with the
Downs was he that he settled at
.Warwick, and induced his father to


join him. They purchased “The
.Glen, ’ a beautiful farm situated
about 10 miles from the town, and
there they engaged in sheep and fat
lamb raising. After some years they
sold “The Glen,” and Mr. Peterson
engaged in the then rapidly growing
timber industry with the Federal
Timber Company at Warwick. In
1905 he sold out his interests in the
company, and with his younger
brothers started sawmilling at the
head of the Condamine River 10
miles from Killarney. The firm
traded under the name of Peterson
Brothers, and it flourishes mightily,
even to this day. But since 1914
Mr. Peterson has been a sleeping
partner, being quite content with
the good management of his brother
partners. In the year 1913 activi-
ties were extended to the cheese-
making industry. A factory was
opened at “Westmore,” in which

Cheddar, in 10-, 40-, and 80-lb.

“Bell” brand, in 5-oz. tins, and
cream cheese, ‘ The Canterbury Bell”
brand, are manufactured. Mr.
Peterson won the first prize
for white export cheese at the
Brisbane Show of 1914. The factory
is supplied with milk from a choice
dairy herd of 250 cows. The estate
on which the factory stands, and on
which Mr. Peterson has lived for
some years, has an area of 1,300
acres of freehold and 800 acres of
leasehold land. It has a frontage of
nearly two miles to the ever-flowing

holdings on the river. The land is
formed of that rich black soil for
which the Downs are so famous; but
unlike some other parts of the
Downs black soil country it is not
what the late James Tyson used to
term “insatiable.” Apparently it
has a subsoil of clay, and therefore
when rain falls the soil holds the
water, on which lucerne specially
thrives. For this reason the lucerne
paddocks of “Westmore” are cele-
brated throughout the district, and
as they cover an area of no fewer
than 130 acres the magnitude of the
yield may be gauged. Beyond these
lucerne-clad paddocks are well-tim-
bered uplands of sandy loam, ideal
grazing grounds for stock. These
uplands are being gradually cleared,
Mr. Peterson’s intention being to
plant wheat on them, their easterly
aspect being specially favourable for
growing that particular crop. The
whole of the estate is well fenced,
and divided into convenient-sized
paddocks. The “Westmore” piggery
is also a model of modern ideas. The
“fellow who pays the rint” is an
important adjunct to Mr. Peterson’s
farming profits. Berkshires are the
breed he has selected, and he is a
firm believer in well-bred stock.
Many are the show prizes he can
boast in connection with his herd of
pigs. Mr. Peterson married on
July 1, 1903, Georgina, a daughter
of the late George Burgess, of
Mountside, Warwick. There are two
sons and four daughters. Mr. Peter-
son is a Justice of the Peace for
Queensland, that honour having
been conferred on him in special
recognition of his eminent pioneer
services to the land of his adoption.


CHRISTIAN GROSS, “Rosen-
berg,” Warwick, was born at Wur-
temberg, Germany, in the year 1844,
and is the only son of the late George
Gross, a farmer and vigneron of that
city. He received his early educa-
tion in his native land, and leaving
school at the age of 14 obtained his
first knowledge of agriculture by
assisting his parents on the home
farm, where he remained until about
his twentieth year. Like most other
young men of ambition, he became
desirous to improve his condition in
life, and with this purpose in view
embarked from Hamburg on August
11, 1863, by the sailing ship “San
Francisco,” reaching Moreton Bay
after a voyage lasting 116 days. On
arrival Mr. Gross was presented
with a Government order for 12
acres of land in the vicinity of

Brisbane, but perceiving the neces-
sity of speedily making himself
familiar with local conditions,
he sought employment on the
Caboolture cotton plantation, sign-
ing a contract for 12 months’ term
of service. Nine months later the
cultivation of cotton was aban-
doned, and the gentleman under re-
view became engaged in general
farm work, turning his hand to the
clearing of land and other pioneer
occupations. Later he came to War-
wick district, where he obtained em-
ployment in share-farming on the
property of Mr. Hall, of Warwick.
Having by industry and manage-
ment saved sufficient funds to strike
out for himself, in 1896 he pur-
chased the land on which his present
homestead now stands, selecting
about 200 acres of some of the finest
country on the Darling Downs, and
began operations on his own account.
His first attention was given to
wheat-growing and the cultivation
of maize as the principal features of
his proposition, and as success
crowned his efforts and a larger area
of land became necessary, he gradu-
ally increased his holding to its pre-
sent area of 1,000 acres. On this
fine property he built a substantial
homestead, which unfortunately was
destroyed by fire in 1915, but has
since been replaced by the modern
residence now occupied by Mr.
Gross, which is well suited in every
respect to the requirements of the
family. As a breeder of Clydesdale
horses he has met with considerable
success, and has scored frequent
triumphs as an exhibitor of this
class of stock in Queensland show
rings, receiving first prize for a
shorthorn bull at the Warwick
Agricultural Show, in addition to
five other prizes awarded to his
exhibits in other sections on the
same day. While still a young man

berg, by which union there is a
family of four sons and four daugh-
ters, all of whom are natives of
Australia, and the sons are now
settled on farms of their own in the
Warwick district. Mr. Gross has
never sought the publicity of official
position in the district, but as an
ardent and loyal advocate of British
rule, with the co-operation of his
family he has rendered substantial

GEORGE KEIM, Mountside,

above-mentioned town in the year
1869, and is the youngest son of the
late Michael Keim, a native of
MR. MICHAEL KEIM.
Wurtemburg, Germany, who came
to Australia in the early fifties.
After careful consideration of the
advantages to be gained by breaking
away from the ties which bound
him to the land of his fathers, Mr.
Keim sailed for Queensland. On
arrival he turned his hand to
whatever employment first offered,
and gained his early experience
all but the bare necessities of life, he
managed to gather together sufficient
capital to enable him in 1869 to
take up an area of land on his own
account, his choice falling upon a
portion of the original “Rosenthal”
Station, thrown open for selection
about this period. His holding com-
prised 1,120 acres of some of the
finest grazing land in the district,
which was equally well suited to the
purposes of cultivation, and here he
made a beginning by planting the
first vineyard in the neighbourhood
of Warwick. This proved a great
success, and yielded him various
triumphs in the early agricultural
shows held in the district, at one of
which he was awarded first prize for
table grapes. As a pioneer in wheat-
growing he also attained some dis-
tinction, receiving a similar award
at a Warwick Show for samples of
his wheat. He died in the year 1884,
leaving a family of three daughters
and four sons. Mr. George Keim
commenced his studies at the Sandy
Creek School, afterwards com-
pleting his education at Mount-
side. From his fourteenth year
onward he assisted his parents
on the home farm, and continued in
this connection until his father’s
death, when the property was
offered for sale by auction, and he
became the purchaser. Since that
date he has increased his holdings
by the purchase of adjoining blocks,
and his property now extends
over about 1,460 acres. It is

sea. He followed the more peaceful
and productive calling of the land,
leaving behind him at his death at
the ripe old age of 71 a substantial
estate, a fine family, and an
honoured name. Mr. Peter Ottosen
was born in the village of Lyngs,
which is nearby the town of Hvid-
berg, in North Jutland, on Septem-
ber 20, 1868. His education covered
the extent of his fourteenth year,
and after that he assisted his father
on the farm. When he had reached
his sixteenth year he served a space
on two different farms for the
purpose of acquiring more extended
knowledge in the science of agricul-
ture. One of these farms was on the
coast of East Jutland, and the other
was on the island of Zealand. At
these two schools of instruction he
acquired invaluable knowledge of
mixed farming and dairying. In
those days cream separators were
unknown, but the results achieved
under the cream-setting method
were astonishing. From his eigh-
teenth to his twenty-first year he
was working overseer on a large
farm on the east coast of Jutland.
He then decided to emigrate, and
the glowing accounts he had heard
of the possibilities of Queensland as
a new land lured him hither. He
arrived in Brisbane in 1890, his
knowledge, brains, and grit being
his only capital. At that time 6s.

unskilled labour, and Mr. Ottosen
was offered work at that rate, but
he preferred to follow his love for
the land. He went on a farm at
Freestone, near Warwick, at 15s.
per week “all found”; but after five
months he struck out for himself by
securing an area of scrub land under
a clearing lease. For two years he
worked on that area, and then took
up a farm of 50 acres at Yangan, 12
miles from Warwick, devoting him-
self principally to the production of
maize and potatoes. The subdivision
of the “Canning Downs” Station in
1899 attracting Mr. Ottosen’s notice,
he sold out at Yangan, and invested
his money in 184 acres of the “Can-
ning Downs” land, and things
went well with him. In a couple of
years he added 140 acres to his
holding. When in 1905 the dairy-
ing industry began to boom he went
in for cream and butter production,
continuing successfully until 1909,
when farm labour troubles caused
him to relinquish dairy-farming, and
he returned to mixed farming.
Meanwhile, however, he had added
another area covering 195 acres to
his holding, which is now known as
“Allandale.” It is a very fine area
of arable and pasture land, the soil
being rich, water plentiful, and the
surrounding scenery superb. Mr.
Ottosen devoted himself mainly to
his agricultural lines, maize and
wheat, and he was most success-
ful with the latter crop, his record
reaching up so high as 45 bushels to

superphosphates in the soil of the
Downs. His first experiment was
with 1 cwt. of the new fertiliser,
but ere long he was using tons of it,

and to-day the productivity of the
land is proverbial throughout the
district. Nor was Mr. Ottosen neg-
lectful of other sources of natural
opportunity. A bore 177 feet deep


provides an inexhaustible stock of
water for beeves and beasts; an
up-to-date wundmill merrily whirrs
as it raises water from the well, and
while nearby an orchard flourishes.
For many years Mr. Ottosen was
identified with all public move-
ments in the district, particularly
of Mr. George Sanderson, then of
Stanthorpe, but now of Hendon.
His family consisted of one son and
three daughters. In Mr. Ottosen

man under review was born at
Jegenda, on June 12, 1869, and
received his education at the public
school of his native village. At 14
years of age he obtained employ-
ment on a neighbouring farm for a
couple of years, and subsequently
from 16 to 20 worked year about
alternately on the paternal property
and on holdings owned by other
proprietors. In 1889, in company
with his brother-in-law, Mr. P. C.
Ottosen, he sailed for Queensland,
arriving at Brisbane the following
January. Proceeding to Freestone,
near Warwick, he worked on a farm
for about six months, eventually
joining in partnership his relative
above mentioned, with whom he
leased an area of scrub land, the
clearing of which kept both gentle-
men strenuously employed during
the following two years. Having
prepared the holding for cultivation
and pastoral operations the partner-
ship was dissolved, and each worked
his share of the property independ-
ently, Mr. Madsen growing maize,
potatoes, and prairie grass, and
starting a small dairy herd of about
a dozen cows. In 1894 he purchased
the “Mount Sturt” property, situated

three and a half miles from
Yangan, which he retained until
1899, when he disposed of it, and
bought his present homestead,
“Danish Court,” comprising 300
acres, which originally was selected
from Government property by Mr.
Thomas Brewer. In 1900 Mr.
Madsen acquired another farm of
240 acres, formerly part of the “Can-
ning Downs” Estate, but two years
later sold this holding, and with his

wife and family sailed for Denmark,
the state of his health rendering
an extended holiday imperative.
During the two years of their
absence the farm at Tanny-
morel was leased to a tenant, but
upon their return in 1904 the family
again took possession, and four years
later Mr. Madsen purchased an
adjoining farm, which brought his
landed possessions up to 530 acres,
making a snug little property of
sufficient acreage for carrying on
operations on a profitable basis. The
character of the land is hilly, the
chief rise occurring in a south-
easterly direction from Farm Creek,
and in its unimproved condition
was covered with ironwood timber
and scrub. The soil is a very
rich black loam, with clay subsoil,
which has proved highly suitable
for cultivation purposes, nearly the
whole of the estate having now
been brought under tillage. Favoured
with a rainfall of from 24 to 30
inches, the land is also watered by
Farm Creek, and by a bore 387 feet
in depth, from which the water rises
as high as 200 feet. A couple of wells
have been sunk, which give a plenti-
ful supply of first-class stock water,
which is raised to the surface by
means of windmills, and at the home-
stead rainwater tanks, with a holding
capacity of about 20,000 gallons
have been installed. The residence
is a commodious and substantial
structure containing nine rooms and
kitchen, with the usual conveniences.
Its situation has been well chosen
on rising ground overlooking Farm
Creek, and the hills on the farther
side of the stream, while in the dis-
tance the township of Tannymorel
may be descried in a southerly
direction. The outbuildings include
a barn and machinery shed, the
latter containing a plentiful supply
of farm implements and labour-
saving machines. There are also
three cottages on the farm, which
are all let to tenants. The estate
is divided into 30 paddocks, a
number of which are devoted to
wheat and maize cultivation, and
the high percentage of 45 bushels of
wheat and 80 bushels of maize to
the acre has been reached. About
70 acres are planted with lucerne.
The cattle on the estate, in-
cluding the dairy herd, numbers
about 60, and some 45 horses are
also pastured for the requirements
of the property. Mr. Madsen mar-
ried in 1891 Christina, daughter of
the late Andrew Ottosen, and has a
family of five sons and three daugh-
ters. After receiving a sound educa-
tion each son at the age of 16 was
given a portion of land to work on
the share system, an arrangement
which answers very satisfactorily.
The eldest son, P. C. Madsen, who
joined the Australian Imperial
Forces in 1915, proceeded to the
front with the 7th Field Ambulance
and took part in the operations
at the Dardanelles By self-denial,
perseverance, and determination Mr.
and Mrs. Masden have achieved
their aim, and now enjoy the fruits
of those pioneer labours to the full.


WILLIAM SMITH, J.P., Yan-
gan, situated on the line of railway
between Warwick and Killarney,
was born in the year 1868 in Wig-
townshire, in the south of Scotland,
a district which, among its many
other claims to distinction, is famous
for the older type of Galloway cattle
which it produced. His father, the
late James Smith, was engaged in
farming and dairying occupations in
the district above mentioned, where
the lad attended a public school
until his thirteenth year. Upon the
completion of his studies he re-
mained with his parents on the
homestead, assisting in the various
duties of the farm, and some years
later served a term of apprenticeship
to the cheesemaking industry, his

master in the art being a highly-
qualified expert, who occupied the
official position of dairy instructor
in the south of Scotland. The les-
sons then received by Mr. Smith laid
the foundation for his future success,
his knowledge and experience finding
adequate scope in later years under
sunnier skies than those of his
native land. In 1890, having de-
cided to seek his fortune in a new
country, he came to Queensland by
the ill-fated vessel “Dacca,” and
after being employed for a time in
various avocations in 1892 accepted
an appointment as cheesemaker to
Mr. Holbrook, of Caboolture. About
a year later he joined the Silverwood
Dairy Company in Southern Queens-
land, with which he was connected
for some 12 years, and in 1905 was
engaged by the State Department of
Agriculture to undertake the duties
of Inspector under the Dairy Pro-
duce Act. During the four years
that he served in this capacity Mr.
Smith took a trip to Scotland, where
he visited the most important centres
of his trade, and had also the privi-
lege of visiting Reading College and
of meeting Professor Benson, Pro-
lessor Drummond, and Mr. James
Weir, men of the highest standing
in scientific circles in the old world,
Shortly after his return to Queens-
land he purchased the Yangan
Cheese Factory, and has since car-
ried on operations successfully in
connection with this large and up-
to-date concern. The factory is
situated in the heart of the dairying
district of the Darling Downs,
affording a convenient market for
the products of a very large area of
country. Its equipment is very
complete, all the latest machinery
having been installed, and its out-
put, which in normal seasons
averages a ton of cheese per day,
includes all the most popular varie-
ties, Cheddar, Stilton, and Mar-
garine cheese, of excellent quality,
all being produced on the premises.
Sterilized milk and cream are also
features of the manufacture. Mr.
Smith is a large exhibitor, with
satisfactory results, at some of the
most important agricultural shows
in Queensland, principally the Bris-
bane National Exhibition, and simi-
lar functions at Warwick and

Killarney. He has also had the dis-
tinction of being a successful prize-
winner at the Kilmarnock Dairy
Show, Scotland. Apart from his
private proposition, which brings
him in touch with a large number of
producers on the Downs, he interests
himself in a prominent manner with
all movements set afoot to promote
the general wellbeing of the resi-
dents. He occupies a seat on the
Glengallan Shire Council, is a mem-
ber of the School Committee, and
president of the School of Arts (in
the foundation of which he took a
leading part). He is chairman and
trustee of the Yangan and Swanfels
Patriotic Committee, a member of
the local War Council and a trustee
of the Yangan Sports Association.

He was appointed a Justice of
the Peace by the Denham Ad-
ministration. Mr. Smith was mar-
ried in 1908 to Jean, daughter of Mr.
James Kemp, a pioneer farmer of the
Yangan district, and has one son.


ROBERT SHAW WILSON,
“Dunburn,” Silverwood, is a native
of the Emerald Isle, his birthplace
being Kildare, where he first saw
the light in the year 1842. His
father, the late George Wilson, was
successfully engaged in farming pur-
suits on his own property in the
North of Ireland for many years;
and after the completion of his
education, which he received in his
native place, the gentleman under
Poulsen & White, Warwick.
MR. ROBERT SHAW WILSON.
review continued on the home farm
until 22 years of age. Being desirous
to “try his luck” in a new sphere, he
left the Old Country in 1864, taking
his passage to Queensland by the
ship “Prince Consort,” which vessel,
after a comparatively quick run of
84 days, made her destination at the
infant settlement of Moreton Bay.
After a short sojourn in the city of
Brisbane, Mr. Wilson, acting on the
advice of friends who had preceded
him, came to Warwick, and being
favourably impressed with the place
he decided to remain for a while
and make himself acquainted with
the conditions of the colony for
which he had forsaken the land of
his youth. He first entered the
service of Messrs. Clarke & Han-
more, who were then the proprietors
of a large sheep run at Talgai; and
after some years of experience with
this firm he felt that his initiation
into the different departments of
pastoral life was sufficiently complete
to justify him in launching out on
his own account. Under the provi-
sions of the Land Act of 1868, Mr.
Wilson became one of the first selec-
tors of a portion of “Rosenthal” Sta-
tion, situated near Warwick, which
had been thrown open to intending
settlers; and having secured an area
of 2,000 acres, stocked his pastures
with merino sheep, and awaited the
opportunity to increase his holding
by the acquirement of adjoining
blocks. In this aim he was so suc-
cessful that at the present time the
“Dunburn” Estate comprises about
4,700 acres of good pastoral country,
and operations are carried on on a
fairly extensive scale. The merino
sheep have since been replaced by
crossbreds, the district being con-
sidered more suitable to mutton-
raising than to wool-growing, and in
this connection experience has proved
to him that the strain which pros-
pers best under local conditions is
the Romney Marsh, of which class
of stock he has made important pur-
chases from famous flocks of well-
known New Zealand breeders. He
also runs cattle, which has proved
a lucrative branch of his enterprise.
The “Dunburn” property is situated
about 15 miles in a southerly
direction from Warwick, and is excel-
lently suited to the purposes for
which it was first taken up by Mr.
Wilson, having a permanent water-
supply in two running creeks and
various wells, from which latter the
water is pumped by means of wind-
mills. It is highly improved as a
grazing property; and among the
old landmarks of the place is the
slab homestead, with its roof of iron-
bark shingles, which is standing

evidence of the strenuous labour put
into his undertakings by the early
pioneer, this structure having stood
for over 30 years. This is now (1916)
being replaced by a modern villa
residence, more in keeping with the
standing of the property in the dis-
trict. Mr. Wilson married in 1884,
and has a family of four daughters
and three sons, the latter assisting
him in the work of the property.
Around Killarney.
The 28 miles of railway journey from Warwick to
Killarney is packed with interest of varied kind. In
the first place, the train, which runs so smoothly and
comparatively speaking is fitted with so many of the
modern conveniences for travelling in comfort, is
gliding over what some eighty odd years ago formed the
only station-holding in the whole of that immense region
which now appears on the map as the railroad-inter-
sected, town-dotted State of Queensland. For nearly
all the way the line passes over the old “Cannings
Downs” run, established by Patrick Leslie, the first of
the squatters to penetrate northwards from the New
England country of New South Wales. His success in
discovering good land- soon brought others following
in his footsteps, but for some months “Canning Downs”
was the only pastoral run in Queensland, con-
sisting as it did of a rude hut for a homestead and a
band of stockmen to hold the cattle from wandering too
far into the surrounding wilderness and to protect the
animals from the assaults of the aborigines.


And a wild, picturesque country it is through which
the herds of Patrick Leslie roamed, and over which he
must many times have ridden with his mustering gangs
endeavouring to ascertain to what numbers his wealth
in living things had increased and to more minutely
examine the wild territory which to all practical pur-
poses for many years was to be his or would belong to
those whom he selected to follow him. To-day the
traveller is held in admiration as the train glides
among timbered mountains and over grassy valleys.
After passing the little township of Yangan, 13 miles
past Warwick, the beauty of the scenery intensifies, and
every imaginable shade of green and blue intermingle
with and merge into one another with remarkable effect.
That considerable areas of the country is of high pro-
ductivity is apparent to even casual observation. Dairy-
ing is carried on extensively, and there are several cheese
factories about Yangan, whilst a large quantity of
wheat is grown between that centre and Killarney.
A variety of primary industries characterize the
activities of the Killarney population. Several cheese
factories and a butter factory yield evidence of the
substantial nature of the dairying industry in the
neighbourhood. Mixed farming is also followed, a large
range of different crops being suited by the natural
conditions'. Among these maize is especially con-
spicuous by reason of the quantity produced. Apples
and other varieties of fruit suitable to temperate
climates are also raised. The timber industry
employs large numbers of men, and the town contains
several sawmills. At Tannymorel, which is in the same
district, a good quality of coal has been discovered,
and the seams are being worked. Cattle are bred on
small runs, which vary from about 10,000 to 20,000
acres in extent.
The town of Killarney lies on a piece of level
ground, but all round are rugged ranges, on which
stand pine trees of enormous height. A few miles away
lies the ridge of the Macpherson Range, which at that
point forms the boundary line between Queensland and
New South Wales. Close to the town are hatcheries
for breeding trout, established some twenty years ago
by the Warwick Acclimatization Society. From this
centre the fry has been liberated in suitable streams all
over the State, and from time to time fish which are
supposed to be the progeny have been caught in various
streams. The town bears many signs of the prosperity
and progressive spirit of both the townspeople and the
surrounding landholders. It is well supplied with banks,
public balls, churches, business places generally, and
the means for meeting the various requirements of such
a population as that of the neighbourhood. It is situated
on the banks of the headwaters of the Condamine River,
contains about 1,000 people, and the district about 3,000.
Stanthorpe.
Lving nearly 3,000 feet above sea-level, and but a
few miles north of the southern boundary of the State,
Stanthorpe possesses what is probably the most attrac-
tive climate of the whole of Queensland. Within a
radius of five miles of the railway station, a pedestrian
may easily reach points at which he stands more than
4,000 feet above the sea. The town is on the main
railway line between Brisbane and Sydney, and is 207
miles from the former capital and 38 miles from War-
wick. The area of the Stanthorpe shire is about 1,000
square miles and population approximately 3,500 per-
sons. More than 5,000 acres are under orchard, and
the industry of horticulture is steadily extending.
Stanthorpe holds two unique attractions for Queens-
landers. It is one of the few places in the State where
the fruits of temperate climates can be successfully and
profitably grown, and it presents living conditions quite
unlike those held by nearly all the rest of the State.
Queensland contains several species of climates. Along
the coast the registered degree of heat appears small
beside that of the arid interior; but those who live on
the former know that the coastal humidity makes
summer more trying than even the fiercer rays of the
inland sun ever can. The two types of heat are very
distinct. But Stanthorpe offers an escape from both.
Here the nights are cold and frosty, and the air is
biting and exhilarating. The place forms a natural
sanatorium for lung complaints, and proves peculiarly
health-giving to persons of all kinds of constitutions.
The mainstay of Stanthorpe is fruit-growing. The
returns from the local orchards range from £5O to £lOO
per acre gross. The differences are due to soil, climate,
and varying degrees of efficiency in management. The
area under horticulture is continually extending; but
efforts to treat the production with a view to exploiting
overseas markets have only just begun. Horticulturists
have, unfortunately, turned their attention almost
exclusively upon local demands, the result being that
industry has been too much concentrated upon some
two cr three species, where a considerable variety of
cool-climate fruits should have been established. This
early error is being rectified, and the returns throughout
have proved satisfactory, as much as £l,BOO having
been taken from a single orchard, and incomes of £7OO


and £BOO per annum from the sale of fruit being
common. Less capital is required for orcharding at
Stanthorpe than is needed for most other forms of
primary industry. AVhile young trees recently planted
are reaching the bearing age, large financial returns are

obtained by growing tomatoes, which the local conditions
admirably suit.
Although first proclaimed a local authority only
in 1879, Stanthorpe has had a chequered history. Its
genesis attached mainly to the discovery of large
deposits of stream tin, and the consequent influx of
fossickers and their families. Within
a few years £3,000,000 worth of
metal was obtained, and then, gradu-
ally but convincingly, the knowledge
dawned alike upon the hardy miners
and the residents of the mining
township that the accessible deposits
had been exhausted, and that if tin-
mining were to remain one of the
industries of the district it must be
carried out by much more exhaustive
and expensive processes. Bad times
fell upon the fossickers, many of
them “trekked” to fresh fields
and new pastures; others, encum-
bered by young families or poverty,
remained and endeavoured to earn a
livelihood by opossum and dingo
trapping and the sale of marsupial
scalps and skins. Even though some of them had
acquired land for mining purposes, of what use to them,
in their imperfect knowledge, seemed a few acres of
decomposed granite soil studded with granite boulders ?
But, although alluvial tin-mining was no more as a
profitable one-man industry the soil was still to prove
the salvation of the inhabitants.
A few successful experiments in orchardiziug by
squatters and others and a favourable expert report on
the fruit-growing possibilities of Stanthorpe soil re-
awakened a spirit of enterprise. Nature, with
her own curious chemistry, had been for ages
decomposing portions of the granite belt of
800 square miles on which Stanthorpe lies,
and forces seemingly antagonistic had been
working harmoniously together to bring
about a condition of soil admirably suited to
orchard cultivation, and also containing
nearly all the phosphates necessary in the
successful cultivation of vegetables. Aroused
by expert advice, aforetime fossickers and
others woke up to the fact that wealth could
still be produced from their seemingly ill-
natured soil if it were worked for purposes of
cultivation rather than for mineralizing.
Many interesting features and much
picturesque scenery lie within easy walk-
ing distance of the town of Stanthorpe.
Among these is the huge bald mountain of
solid rock 4,070 feet above sea-level, with only a few
stunted shrubs growing from the fissures of the granite
to relieve its homogeneous immensity. The locality con-
tains various other unusual granite formations, and
among these, about two miles from the town, are natural
fortifications which local tradition claims to have been

the stronghold of the notorious bushranger Thunderbolt,
who terrorized a large portion of New South Wales
and part of South-eastern Queensland some half-century
ago. The course of the Severn, as it runs by Stan-
thorpe, provides features which are wild and beautiful.


Councillor JOHN HENRY
BRUHN, owner of the “Plateau”
Orchards, which he personally con-
ducts, is the only son of the late
Asmus Henry Bruhn, who came
originally from Schleswig-Holstein,
landing at Brisbane in the early
sixties. After arrival in Queensland
he became associated with pastoral
pursuits, and passed nearly all the
remainder of his life on various
station properties, including “Glen-
lyon,” near Stanthorpe, and several
in the Warwick district, viz., the
North British Australia Company’s
property, “Mount Side” selection,
“Braeside,” and “The Glen.” The
gentleman under review was born
at “Mount Side” on January 28,
1875, and received his education at
the local State school, where he
remained until 13 years of age. He
then began to work under the super-
vision of his father, and when in
1892 the family removed to a selec-
tion of their own at Pikedale, for
the three years of their residence
there he was “right-hand man” in
connection with this enterprise. He
then returned with his parents to
“Braeside,” where several years
later he was appointed to the posi-
tion of overseer, which he held for
18 months. In June, 1899, he took
up an agricultural homestead block,
of 320 acres, near Thulimbah rail-
way siding, and built a home, which
was occupied by his father and
mother until 1901, when he took
personal possession, his father dying
about that time. The property is

situated at an elevation of 3,000
feet above sea level, and comprises
an area of 160 acres, 12 acres of
which is devoted to orchard pur-
poses while the remainder is used
for sheep-raising. The balance of
the original selection has been sold
as orchard land to different settlers.
At the time of its being taken up
by Mr. Bruhn, the locality was
heavily timbered, chiefly with
stringybark, blackbutt, and swamp
oak, and the clearing of the land for
the orchard entailed a very great
amount of hard work. The remain-
ing 138 acres have all been ring-
barked, the most valuable of the
' timber being spared, in particular
the stringybark, which is used for
building and fencing purposes. The
soil is decomposed granite formation,
which has proved to be the best
possible soil for growing all kinds
of deciduous fruits (especially apples
and pears), and extends to a depth
of about four feet. Water of good
quality can be procured on almost
any part of the estate by sinking
from 10 to 15 feet, and the district
has a good rainfall, the average
over a period of seven years being
31 ‘25 inches. The property has
sheepproof fencing, and is divided
into three paddocks, exclusive of the
orchard and homestead. An average
flock of 100 sheep, which sometimes
rises to 200, is pastured, and these,
especially in the winter time, are
penned at night among the fruit
trees (which are protected from
injury), so that the soil may benefit
by the sheep manure, which, being
rich in humus, has proved the very
best fertilizer for fruit areas. Mr.
Bruhn was practically the pioneer
orchardist of Thulimbah and dis-
trict. When he started operations
the general impression was that he
was wasting both valuable time and
money, but by his enthusisam and
enterprise he has effectually demon-
strated that there is no better soil
in Australia for apple-growing than
the district in which he resides.
Whilst cultivating a very large
variety of apples, among the trees,
which include Trevett’s Seedling,
William’s Favourite, Cor’s Orange
Pippin, Dunn’s Seedling, etc., Mr.
Brulm has found the Gravenstein,
Jonathan, Rome Beauty, Cleo-
patra, and Chandler species most
profitable, the lastnamed especially
producing a very heavy crop of
splendid keeping apples. In addi-
tion, he has planted 125 pear trees

(Doyenne du Cornice, Beurre de
Capiaumont, and William’s bon
Chretien), peaches, plums (both
English and Japanese), and all
kinds of stone fruits, with the
exception of the apricot, which have
proved very profitable. Grapes also
come to perfection, and 1,000 vines
have been planted. The homestead is
a very substantial house of 10 rooms,
bath, pantries, etc. Large galvanized
iron tanks conserve an adequate
water supply, and outbuildings com-
prise packing sheds, buggy and dray
sheds, etc., all ' constructed of
stringybark timber posts, with walls
and roof of the durable bark
obtained from the same tree. A
plough and cultivator represent all
the machinery needed, and a couple
of horses are easily able to cope with
the work required of them. Mr.
Bruhn occupies various public offices
in the district, including those of
chairman of the Stanthorpe Shire
Council (1916), secretary to the move-
ment to secure a railway siding for
the settlement, chairman of the
Thulimbah Sports Club, besides
which he is secretary and treasurer
to the cricket club, and treasurer
to the tennis club, in both of which
he is an active playing member.


Councillor ELI HENRY STAN-

from Cambridgeshire, England, in

the early sixties, and was one of the
pioneer orchardists of the Huon dis-
trict, Tasmania. Mr. E. H. Stanton
was born on the bank of the Huon
River, opposite the spot where Frank-
lin now stands, on February 12, 1865.
In early life he started as a ferry
boy on the river, remaining at this
occupation until about 16 years of
age. For the next four years he
worked with his father, who was a
contractor under the Tasmanian
Government, as a telegraph and tele-
phone line repairer; and in the
Russian war scare of the eighties was
employed in erecting a telephone line
from Southport to The Whale Head,
on the south-west coast of Tasmania,
so as to ensure the communication of
any news immediately, in order the
better to defend Llobart in the event
of an invasion. Subsequently he
became a road contractor on the
island, which proved a remunerative
occupation, and still later followed
mining pursuits for four years at
Mount Bischoff. In June, 1892, he
removed from Tasmania to New
South Wales, and worked on the
Darling River for the next 10 years,
during which period he gained
valuable experience on a number
of sheep stations, finally being
appointed manager of the “Huon-
ville” Station, on the Barrier, about
14 miles north of Broken Hill. He
came to Queensland in 1902 to join
a younger brother in business at
Brisbane, under the style of Stanton
Bros., fruit and commission agents;
and six years later, purchasing his
present selection, he removed to
Eukey to take in hand the manage-
ment of the orchard. In 1911 the
partnership was dissolved, when Mr.
E. H. Stanton retained all interests
in the orchard and estate, which he
has since conducted solely on his
own account. Originally the selec-
tion comprised an area of 1,276
acres, which has since been reduced
to 1,038 acres. At the time of
purchase there were 10 acres cleared,
and 800 fruit trees had been planted,
but operations have gone rapidly
forward, and Mr. Stanton now has
some 60 acres cleared, of which 40
acres are planted with over 4,400
trees, varying in age from 1 to 14
years. The principal varieties culti-
vated are apples, plums, and
peaches, the most profitable apple
being the London Pippin, though all
the best kinds are found in the
orchard; while the Klondyke pre-
dominates among the peaches; and
both English and Japanese plums

are largely grown. Apricots are
being experimented with, 300 trees
being planted as an experiment
some few years ago, and in spite
of the fact that hitherto this fruit
has proved a failure in the dis-
trict the trees look most flourishing,
while the fruit is of excellent
quality. The land is also very suit-
able for potato-growing, and Mr.
Stanton has tried four varieties,
with the result that from a
commercial point of view Bronells
and New Zealand Pink Eyes have
proved the most profitable. Hay,
maize, pumpkins, cabbages, toma-
toes, French beans, turnips, peas,
etc., etc., are also grown for the
markets. The land not under culti-
vation is used for grazing, and in all
about 45 head of cattle and horses
are kept, while Mr. Stanton contem-
plates the introduction of a flock
of sheep, the manure from which
would prove most valuable for
orchard purposes. Upon the
uncleared portion of the estate there
is a great deal of timber suitable for
the manufacture of fruit cases. Mr.
Stanton interests himself in the public
life of the district, and in addition to
the Commission of the Peace holds
various prominent offices. He is a
member of the Stanthorpe Shire
Council, and of the local agricul-
tural society; for two years was
president of the Stanthorpe Progress
Association, of which he is still a
member; and acts as treasurer of
the Eukey State School committee,
He married in 1905 Lily Rebecca,

THOMAS PATON, “Bench Hill”
Orchard, Stanthorpe, is the second
son of John Paton, of Perth, Scot-
land, who arrived at Moreton Bay
by the clipper ship “Otago” in 1886,
and settled first at Toowoomba,
later at Warwick, and finally at
Stanthorpe. He worked on the con-
struction of the main southern rail-
way line, between Stanthorpe and
Wallangarra, and afterwards became
an employe of the Queensland Rail-
way Department, filling a position
as fettler on the line from Stan-
thorpe to Warwick. The gentleman
under review, Mr. Thomas Paton,
was born at Perth, Scotland, on
November 9, 1879, and came to
Queensland as a lad of seven years.
He attended the Warwick State
School until entering his teens, and
upon discontinuing his studies was
for nine years engaged in droving in
Central Queensland. In 1901 he
volunteered and was accepted for
service in the Boer War, and went
to South Africa with the sth Aus-
tralian Contingent. He saw 12
months of active service in all parts
of British and Boer territory where
guerilla warfare was being carried
on, and in an engagement on
Elephant River on January 13,
1902, was wounded in both arms,
After recovery he continued to fight,
and upon his discharge was honoured
with a medal and four clasps.
Returning to Queensland towards
the end of 1902, he took up from

the Government his present selection
at Stanthorpe, and has carried on
orchard operations ever since, in
1912 being joined by his younger
brother, John, who assists him in all
TT
the departments of the industry.
Mr. John Paton, jun., was born at
Warwick, Queensland, on October 9,
1892, and received his education at
the Stanthorpe State School. At 14
he left school, and for the following
few months was engaged as a mail
boy, carrying mails from Stanthorpe
to the Seven-mile Dredge. He next
worked on a dairy farm at Korellak,
near Acacia Creek, New South
Wales, and later was associated with
an elder brother in fencing and
clearing on various properties in the
Mother State. Prior to coming to
“Bench Hill’' he was engaged on
a western sheep station for about
18 months. “Bench Hill” Orchard
is situated on what is known as
“The Four-mile,” a plateau 3,000
feet above sea level, and has an area
of 160 acres, with more than half-a-
mile frontage to the main road. It
is regarded as one of the most
notable selections in the district on
account of the nature of the soil—-
a red chocolate loam of volcanic
origin—and for its situation on a
ridge with a slope each way from
the centre of the block. Dense
timber originally covered the selec-
tion, but of this 45 acres have been
cleared, and a 37-acre orchard has
taken the place of the primeval
forest, while the balance of the
cleared portion is devoted to the
cultivation of hay, potatoes, onions,
cabbages, and, indeed, all kinds of
vegetable, while maize is grown
among the young frnit trees. The
estate enjoys an abundant supply of
first-class water, which is obtained
by sinking to a depth of about 30
feet; and galvanized iron tanks
conserve a large quantity of rain-
water at the homestead. The holding
is securely fenced with posts and four
wires, and is subdivided into the
orchard enclosure and one large pad-
dock, where about 15 head of cattle

and some 10 horses are run. Sub-
stantial packing-sheds and barns are
found in the vicinity of the home-
stead, and equally well-constructed
pens for a number of pigs, which
have been found very profitable
adjuncts to Mr. Paton’s enterprise,
as they consume the waste products
of both orchard and vegetable
garden. The orchard is planted with
over 3,000 fruit trees of many
varieties, of which 1,750 are apple
trees, 250 pear trees, and the balance
stone fruits, viz., peaches, nectar-
ines, Japanese and English plums,
the age of the trees varying from
1 to 10 years. Gravenstein, Jona-
than, Rome Beauty, and others are
grown largely in the apple section,
and the William’s bon Chretien pear
and Alberton peach are very largely
favoured by Mr. Paton, who also
produces splendid grapes, and is
considerably extending the area
under cultivation of vines. The
whole of the orchard is kept in
perfect condition, the land being
thoroughly worked and free from
all kinds of weeds, while attention to
detail is manifest in all departments,
revealing the secret of much of the
success that has attended the
venture.


CHARLES TEALE, part-owner
and resident manager of the valu-
able property known as “Summit”
MR. JOSEPH TEALE.
Orchard, The Summit, southern
railway line, is the tenth son
of the late Joseph Teale, of Elm-
stone-Hardwick, near Cheltenham,
Gloucestershire, England, who dur-
ing his long life of nearly 80 years
spent the major portion of his time
in farming pursuits. Mr. Charles
Teale was born at Elmstone-Hardwick

on March 4, 1851, and was
educated at the village school.
After leaving school he followed
farming operations until his
departure for Brisbane by the
clipper ship "Royal Dane,” at the
close of the year 1872. Arriving
at Brisbane, Queensland, on Janu-
ary 17, 1873, he spent 18 months on
a farm near Toowoomba, and in
September, 1874, joined the Queens-
land Railways Department, becoming

a member of a “flyiim gang” which
was occupied in preparing the land
for the site of the Toowoomba
railway station. In 1875 he
became a permanent way man on
the Dalby line, and in May, 1879,
was promoted to the post of ganger
on the western line, with headquar-
ters at Chinchilla, where he remained
for about three years. He was then
transferred to Redbank, leaving
there in December, 1885, for Roma
Street yard, and finally terminated
his connection with the service in
July, 1913, when he entered upon
the development of his present pro-
perty. “Summit” Orchard has an
area of 122 acres, with soil of decom-
posed granite formation, highly suit-
able for fruitgrowing purposes, to
which industry Mr. Teale has almost
entirely devoted himself. At the
time of writing there are 23 acres
cleared, of which 19 acres are

planted with fruit trees, among
which apples of various kinds pre-
dominate. Including the early and
late varieties the orchard boasts
over 1,300 apple trees, and in addi-
tion 100 pear trees, 200 peaches,
and a number of nectarines, plums,
and cherries are cultivated with
great success. Grapes are also
grown to perfection, and in the
vegetable garden may be found
very fine beans, peas, cabbages,
tomatoes, turnips, etc. The estate
is well fenced with post and
wire fences, and the orchard is
netted 3 feet from the ground.
Prior to planting the land is
ploughed to a depth of six inches,
and it is subsequently kept well
worked, the methods of cultivation
adopted having proved excellently
suited to the conditions of the
locality. The homestead is one of
the most substantial and convenient


in the district, wide verandahs,
flanking the house on three sides,
adding materially to the coolness and
comfort of the home. The position
is a most salubrious one, the air,
at an altitude of 3,030 feet above
sea level, being delightfully fresh.
Mr. Teale upon terminating his
connection with the railway service
was made the recipient of a presenta-
tion in the shape of a gold watch from
his fellow-employes, in recognition of
his long and useful term of service,
and to show the high esteem in
which he was held. For over 25
years he was a member and com-
mitteeman of the Railway and
Works Rifle Club, being one of its
“crack” shots, and in 1895 was a
representative for Queensland in the
Intercolonial Rifle Match, held at
Toowong; also being a member of
the team that won the Federal Cup
the same year, on which occasion he
was only one point below the highest
scorer of the States competing.
During the course of his career he
has won many medals and trophies
of various kinds, and enjoys the
reputation of having figured as one
of the best marksmen of Queens-
land. Upon retiring from the Rail-
way Department he was made a life
member of the rifle club. In 1871,

of these, Richard Thomas Teale,
was born at Dalby, on July 29,
1875, and received his education
principally at the normal school,
Brisbane, which he attended until 13
years of age. He then joined the
permanent way staff of the Railways
Department, where he remained
until his eighteenth year, when he
spent a year on a cattle station, and
was employed in various ways for
another two years, when he rejoined
the staff, at the present time (1916)
occupying the post of permanent way
inspector at Bowen. In 1905, when
the Colonial Sugar Refining Com-
pany, Limited, approached the Rail-
ways Commissioner for the services
of a competent man, Mr. R. T.
Teale was chosen for the position,
and spent 13 months in Fiji, super-
intending the laying down of a
railway line on behalf of the above-
mentioned company. He married in
1904 Daisy May, daughter of the
late George Beer, of Murphy Creek,
and has issue two sons and one
daughter. Bertie Charles Michael
Teale, Mr. Charles Teale’s second
son, was born at Jondaryan, on
September 1, 1880, and pursued his
studies at the Brisbane Normal
School. Upon leaving this institu-
tion at 16 he was first employed by
Messrs. Armour & Co., of Brisbane,
as invoice clerk, and subsequently
joined the clerical division of the
Railways Department, in which con-
nection he has continued ever since,
being now stationed at the Roma
Street goods office. He married
Harriet May, daughter of Mr. John
Lock. William Joseph Teale, the
youngest of the trio, was born at
Redbank on December 21, 1882, and
was educated at the Brisbane Nor-
mal School. When 16 years old he
entered the warehouse of Messrs.
Carew & Gardiner, Brisbane, but in
1900 became a member of the Rail-
ways Department. He married

at Mount Ephraim, near Bull Creek,
afterwards removing to the latter
place, where he was engaged in
wheat farming until the end of 1871.
He then removed to Moonta Mines,
where he turned his attention to
mining pursuits, subsequently pro-
ceeding to Broken Hill, and work-
ing in the famous Barrier Mines
until 1892, when he took up his
residence with his son, the gentle-
man under review, at Warrackna-
beal, Victoria, and remained with
him until his death at the ripe age
of 78, in June, 1915. Mr. William
Atkins was born at Bull Creek,
South Australia, on March 5, 1862,
and received his scholastic training
at the local public school, which he
attended until 10 years of age. He
then turned to to earn his own
livelihood, and from this early
period of his life has practically been
dependent upon himself for support.
He first obtained work on the
Hamley Mines, in South Australia,
at a later date being employed in
carting wood for the same mines,
after which he secured employment
from the farmers in the neighbour-
hood of Agery and Penang, remain-
ing in his native State until 26 years
of age. In 1888 he took up land
in the Wimmera district of Victoria,
consisting of a square mile of
mallee country, and carried on
wheat farming in this locality very
successfully until February, 1894.
At this date he disposed of his
interests in the sister State, and
came to Queensland, purchasing a
fruit farm situated about four
miles from Roma, where grape-
vines formed the most profitable
branch of his industry, though citrus
fruits, apricots, and a variety of
stone fruits also were cultivated
with considerable success. The dis-
trict also proved highly suitable to
the production of melons, and
various kinds of vegetables, includ-
ing potatoes, turnips, and cabbages,
w r ere grown to perfection by Mr.
Atkins whilst resident on this farm.
He sold his Roma property in 1907,
and took up his present orchard

holding at Stanthorpe, which com-
prises an area of 160 acres, which at
the time of purchase was heavily
timbered with stringybark, black-
butt, and gum. The land is undu-
lating and well suited to fruitgrow-
ing purposes, a valuable feature
being the abundant supply of water
obtainable by sinking to a depth
of 30 feet. This well water is of
capital quality, and at the home-
stead is augmented by the conserva-
tion of rainwater in large galvanized
iron tanks, providing a practically
inexhaustible supply for household
and other requirements. Clearing
operations were early put in train
by Mr. Atkins and his sons, and
by degrees 22 acres have been pre-
pared for cultivation, out of which
a 16-acre orchard has been formed,
a large number of the trees having
already come to maturity. Apples,
principally of the “Jonathan” and
“Granny Smith” varieties, take
pride of place among the well-
tended rows, but many hundreds of
pears, peaches, and nectarines have
been planted, the system adopted
being that of rows 22 feet apart,
with the same distance between
every tree and its neighbour. Two
acres of grapevines present a
flourishing appearance, “Golden
Chasselas,” “Chasselas Rose,” and
black “Muscats” being largely repre-
sented, and a big area is devoted to
the very profitable “Royal Ascot.”
Besides the cleared portion, 100
acres have been ringbarked, and the
whole property is fenced, timber
posts and four wires making a suffi-
ciently substantial boundary fence,
while the orchard and vineyard are
made still further secure by the
addition of three-foot-wide wire-
netting. The area not in use for
orchard purposes serves as grazing
land for the horses, of which only a
very limited number is required for
the necessary cultivation work, done

prominent part in the Methodist
Church, of which he is a trustee.
He married in July, 1888, Eliza,
daughter of the late Henry Rowling,
of Yorke Peninsula, South Aus-
tralia, and has four sons and two
daughters. Lyall Henry Atkins,
the eldest son of the gentleman
above mentioned, was born at
“Hope” Farm, Warracknabeal, Vic-
toria, on July 20, 1891, and received
his primary education at a public
school at Northern Road, Queens-
land, afterwards attending the
Roma State School until his thir-
teenth year, when he began work
on his father’s Roma property, also
known as “Hope” Farm. About
four years later the family removed
to Stanthorpe, and Mr. L. H.
Atkins continued to assist in the
home proposition until 19 years of
age, when he turned his attention to
outside work, taking contracts for
the clearing and fencing of land, and
followed this occupation for about
12 months. In 1910 he selected 260
acres of land at Dalveen, which is
being cleared for orchard purposes
as opportunity permits. A dense
growth of timber, chiefly stringy-
bark, gum, and blackbutt, has to
be removed before any cultivation
can be done, but already 30 acres
has been ringbarked, and three acres
ploughed up and planted with 150
apple trees, besides nectarines and
apricots, etc. Post and wire fences
enclose 80 acres, and the orchard is
securely wire-netted. In November,
1915, Mr. L. H. Atkins joined the
Australian Imperial Forces. Harold
Leslie Atkins, the second son, was
born at "Hope” Farm, Warrackna-
beal, on October 27, 1892, and was
educated at the Northern Road and
Roma State Schools, Queensland.
Upon leaving school at 14 years of
age he accompanied the family to
their present home at Stanthorpe,
and shortly afterwards was appren-
ticed to the carpentering trade,
which has occupied his attention
ever since, work in connection with
the timber dwelling-houses which are
such a feature of the country and
suburban districts engaging the
major share of his time. Willie
Wilford Atkins, the third son, was
born on his father’s property at
Warracknabeal, on December 4,

ALEXANDER ALLAN HOLM,
Maryland Street, Stanthorpe, is the
eldest son of the late Alexander
Holm, who came from Newcastle-on-
Tyne, England, and landed at
Sydney, New South Wales, in the
early sixties, when a boy of about
10 years of age. For many
years the late colonist was
employed by the New South
Wales Government on the
main roads in the Tenter-
field district, his de-th
taking place in September,
1904. The gentleman under
review was born at Tenter-
field, New South Wales, on
July 22, 1887, and received
his education at the Tenter-
field Supei’ior Public School,
where he continued until 14
years of age. Immediately
upon leaving school he was
(apprenticed to the tailor-
ing trade in his native
town with a Mr. David
Robertson, who had had a
wide exnerience in Edin-
burgh and London, and
from him passed into the
employ of Mr. J. F. Moran,
of Tenterfield, with whom
he completed his inden-
tures. At the age of 23
he took his first lessons in
the art cf “cutting” from
Mr. Alfred Shearer, an expert
cutter and a splendid teacher, whose
qualifications were attested by a
diploma awarded him by the Berlin
Academy, and whose experience
included a lengthy exercise of his
craft in the Mother State. Having
mastered this branch of his work,
Mr. Holm accepted an engagement
as cutter and tailor at Glen Lines,
New South Wales, and also filled a
position of the same nature at
Stanthorpe, prior to entering into
business on his own account. In
MR. HOLM'S TAILORING ESTABLISHMENT, STANTHOPRE.
1913, in partnership with Mr. Alex-
ander J. Jamieson, he established
himself in his present premises, and
continued his connection with the
latter gentleman until March, 1915,
when the partnership was dissolved,
Mr. Holm becoming the sole
proprietor. Both as regards material
and workmanship a very high
standard is observed, while men
are employed almost exclusively
for the tailoring, which is done
by hand by practical tailors
who have had both English and
Australian experience. All
kinds of tailoring work
are undertaken, the neces-
sities of men in every
direction being catered for
from the ordinary sac to
the best dress suits;
while a specialty is made
of ladies’ tailoring, particu-
larly in the winter season.
The business from small
beginnings is extending
rapidly, and is making its
way into favour among
the local residents in a
highly satisfactory manner,
the general testimony from
customers who have tried
and proved the quality of
the work sent out from
this up-to-date establish-
ment being that in every
respect it compares most
favourably with that of the
very best houses in the
capital cities of the Com-
monwealth. Those favour-
ing Mr. Holm with their
patronage cannot but be
satisfied both with the style and
manufacture of their clothing, the
same attention which ensures a
perfect fit being given to the smallest
details of the business, which boasts
a further advantage in being con-
fined solely to tailoring.
Millmerran.
Miilmerran forms the terminus of a branch railway,
which leaves the main southern line 10 miles south of
Toowoomba, and stretches through fertile volcanic downs,
across the Condamine River, in a south-westerly direction
to within a few miles of the Herries Range. Pittsworth,
128 miles from Brisbane, is the most important township
passed on the way, and it also forms the centre of an
important farming district. Miilmerran is 155 miles
from the metropolis, and it taps a large area of rich
land, where many forms of primary industries flourish.
Some of the richest land in the Darling Downs lies
within this neighbourhood; and of recent years
the great strides made there by dairying have
served to increase land values at a rapid rate. The
Downs land is suited to cereal growing, heavy yields
almost invariably accompanying seasons in which, the
rainfall is sufficient to meet the needs of the soil, which,
unfortunately, cracks easily, and so permits the moisture
to easily escape from beneath the surface by evaporation.
It is not that the average rainfall is light. In South
Australia and the Northern districts of Victoria, as
well as in parts of New South Wales, wheat is success-
fully grown with half the Miilmerran fall. B\it the
peculiarly porous nature of the Darling Downs soil
demands special treatment in cultivation. In time the
required methods will doubtless be adopted, and the


production of grain for millers will come to vie with
dairying in popularity among local farmers. Lucerne
grows excellently wherever it has been tried in the Mill-
merran and surrounding districts; and the stock-carry-
ing capacity has been so high that of recent years a
considerable amount of closer settlement has brought
increased rural population to within the confines of the
shire, and this development promises steadily to
continue.
How fertile and well adapted to industry are these
Downs was recognized in the earliest days of the settle-
ment of the State; and though “Canning Downs,”
three miles from Warwick, was the first station
permanently established in the territory which
ultimately was to become Queensland, it was not
long afterwards that adventurous spirits pushed
further north and made their homes on land destined
to prove no less prolific than that selected by the
pioneering Patrick Leslie, Queensland’s first squatter.
One of these old stations of historic interest and of
contemporary importance is “Cecil Downs,” a great
part of which comes within the boundary of the Mill-
merran Shire. This holding was originally secured from
the New South Wales Government by Charles Stuart
Russell, the author of that well-known book on the old
squatting days, “The Genesis of Queensland.” At
the time of writing “Cecil Plains,” which recently
belonged to “The Taylor Estates Limited,” is to
be cut up by the Government for closer settlement.
It has been described as “the most valuable free-
hold estate in Australia held by one owner.” The
property has an area of 122,000 acres or 200 square
miles. “Yandilla” is another station, the early records
of which are closely interwoven with the early history
of Queensland’s pastoral development. The original
occupiers of this estate were the Gore family, and they
held it till about 1911, when the success of closer settle-
ment in the district, the keen demand from intending
farmers for land, and increased prices, led them to cut
the estate up for purposes of sale. Mr. J. M. Lomax,
a gentleman previously well known in the pastoral
industry of the Darling Downs and Central Queensland,
purchased the fine old homestead, together with some
20,000 acres of the best land. Here there has been
established one of the most valuable shorthorn studs in
the Commonwealth. The management is carried on by
Mr. Arthur R. Lomax, and his efforts as a stock breeder
have resulted in numerous victories at the Sydney and
Brisbane Agricultural Shows.
Industry in this prolific district may be described as
in a process of evolution. Fringing the rich and
heavy black soils of the Downs is country of a lighter
nature, eminently adapted for growing wheat and other
cereals. But up to the present a considerable quantity
of these lands is still being used as sheep runs.
Wherever agriculture is followed excellent results are
obtained. But the conversion of industry in the natural
order of things can only proceed gradually if it is to
lead to permanent success. Beyond this area containing
light soils there is an immense tract of country extend-
ing to beyond Kooroongarra to the south, much of it
containing soils extremely rich, but covered by heavy
scrub. This country, at the time of writing, is under-
going a process of fairly rapid development, many new
selections having been taken up. Strenuous work is
here being applied by the pioneering agriculturists
against the static resistence of the forest giants and the
dense scrub. But every indication points to dairying
and mixed farming having a most hopeful future in this
territory. Fortunately, land has to be only partly
opened before the former enterprise can be commenced,
and cheese-making is already well established, the
product from this locality holding its own in point of
price as against that of any other district in Queensland.
The Shire of Millmerran was constituted by
proclamation on May 1, 1913. The area is comprised
of portions excised from the Shires of Jondaryan,
Rosenthal, Inglewood, and Waggamba. The existence
of Millmerran as an independent local authority is the
result of much agitation on the part of settlers who
previously were situate' on the outskirts of the shires
just mentioned, and who claimed that their interests
were not so well catered for as were those of ratepayers
living nearer to the centres of municipal administration.
When the railway extension from Pittsworth to Mill-
merran became an accomplished fact, on October 18,
1911, it became obvious to these pioneers that there no
longer existed the necessity for them to so frequently
visit the towns which had hitherto been the business
centres of the district, and that both efficiency and
economy would be achieved by having the seat of local
government in a central position. The area of the
Millmerran Shire is 1,346 square miles, or 861,440
acres, embracing many classes of lands and soils.
The population is estimated at 1,450 persons.
The shire possesses convenient and well-appointed
chambers, which were constructed at the initia-
tion of a separate life. The revenue during 1916
was about £2,255. The first councillors to be elected
were Arthur R. Lomax, Yandilla; Arthur C. V. Bligh,
Condamine Plains; Robert Grieve, Kurrowah; E. C.
Butler, Western Creek; Richard Crocker, Iwexme; John
Clark, Moyness; Richard Golden, Hillgrove; Frank
O. Paterson, Kooroongarra; and Geo. Mabbett, Koo-
roongarra. The new council was fortunate in the
choice of a shire clerk in Mr. Geo. Humfress Simpson,
who by reason of a well-founded knowledge of local
government laws and correct methods of procedure has
been a source of considerable strength to a local govern-
ing body, which in its early stages necessarily lacked


experience. Mr. Lomax, of the historic “Yandilla”
Station, was the first chairman of the council.
Millmerran township lies about twenty-six miles
south-west of Pittsworth. It wae founded about the
year 1887 by Edward Walpole, who, striking out into
what at that time was quite a new settlement, selected
a fair area of land, and in addition to ordinary grazing
pursuits added the business of general storekeeper. In
a short, while the inevitable bush post office followed,
and came under the charge of the pioneering merchant.
At an realy date Mr. Walpole had portion of
his holding surveyed into township allotments, thus
forming the foundations of the centre that was to
be. Mr. Walpole, still hale and hearty, enjoys
a well-earned rest in the eventide of his adventurous
life in a comfortable home on the Toowoomba Range.
Although Millmerran is the principal township of the
shire, its population as yet numbers but 200 people,
the energies of the settlers of the neighbourhood being
entirely devoted to primary industry, so that most of the
inhabitants have rural rather than township homes. The
site has been wisely chosen in a pleasant situation, with
a good drainage, the soil being of a sandy nature, and
the streets become clean and dry immediately after even
a heavy rain. The climate is particularly temperate,
the altitude being 1,230 feet above sea level. The
winters are characterized by crisp invigorating air and
bright sunshine, whilst in summer the daytime heat
rarely grows excessive and the nights are regularly cool.
A well-constructed local school has been in the control
of Mr. Harry Walker for something over a quarter of
a century. Another township within the shire is
Turallin, which lies on what at one time was
the main road from Toowoomba to Goondiwindi,
and which in past days served as a favourite
camping spot for teamsters conveying wool to the
railway, or rations back as loading. I hough
Turallin has a well-built Church of England and
adequate school accommodation, the population is small,
those conveniences being utilized mainly by surrounding
settlers. The township of Kooroongarra, which lies
about twenty miles south of Millmerran, is of rather
historic interest, being probably the only village sur-
viving from all those which many years ago were
established as “village settlements” by the Queensland
Government, as well as by some of the other Australian
Administrations, notably that of South Australia. These
embryo townships were intended to serve as a means by
which men without capital could be started comfortably
upon very small holdings in the country. Each village
was intended to be self-contained, so that there would
be employment in it of a very diversified description.
Each person embraced within the scheme, whether he
was a market gardener or a bootmaker, was provided
with sufficient land to enable him to grow his own
vegetables, to keep his own cow, and, in short, to
provide his household with all those commodities which
any industrious man of ordinary intelligence may
produce by his own labour, if afforded some two
or three acres of land and a small sum of capital
to start with. Something, unfortunately, had been left
out of the calculation by the originators of the scheme.
The effort failed, and the enterprise is now but
a memory. But Kooroongarra remains. The little
township has its store, its boarding-house, its butcher’s
shop, its entertainmnt hall, and two churchee, truly
not an imposing village. But it is the centre of a most
prosperous dairying community.
Goondiwindi.
The Goondiwindi district as yet is devoted
mainly to pastoral industry, and the neighbourhood
contains some of the best-known sheep and cattle
stations in Queensland. But the attention which came
to be centred on the locality as soon as railway com-
munication with the main southern line was completed
on October 13, 1908, has already given evidence of
leading to a closer scheme of settlement and a more
remunerative enterprise. Goondiwindi, which is on the
branch line from Warwick to Dirranbandi, and lies
284 miles by rail south-west of Brisbane, marks the
south-western fringe of the Darling Downs, and is well
within the wheat belt. Indeed, from Inglewood, 52
miles nearer to the metropolis, some of the best quality
of wheat yet produced in the State is exported.
However, agriculture is yet but in its initial stages. The
prolific nature of the natural resources for the produc-
tion of cereals have been thoroughly established, but
before a big output of grain is attained the large hold-
ings into which so much of the country is divided must
be cut into smaller blocks. This development will follow
the operation of the natural law of supply and demand.
Gcondiwindi stands among the most solid and
progressive of those of the Queensland centres which
derive their subsistence mainly from the pastoral
industry. The site is on the Maclntyre River, over
which a substantial bridge has been built at the joint
expense of the Queensland and New South Wales Gov-
ernments, the border of the parent State passing close
to the town. The Maclntyre joins the Barwon, which


for some distance divides the States. The district con-
sists of rolling downs of black, sandy loam, mostly
treeless, but interspersed with low, timbered ridges. The
average annual rainfall, as reckoned over a period of
twenty-seven years, is 25'48 inches, all of which is needed
in order to ensure the plentiful growth of vegetation,
to which the soil is capable of giving vigorous life, with
sufficient moisture, the ground being porous and lending
itself readily to losing water through evaporation. The
stations are devoted to wool-growing rather than to
cattle-raising. The district has proved particularly
sound, and free from such diseases as sheep may else-
where suffer from; but the increased prices which have
resulted partly from the great war and partly from other
causes, have led to landholders here, as well as in other
parts of the State, giving increased attention to beef
production. However, figures taken shortly before the
1915-16 drought, showing the petty sessions district of
Goondiwindi to be carrying close on to half a million
sheep, besides 36,000 head of cattle and 4,000 horses,
may be regarded as fairly typical of the proportions
considerable future expansion. At present there is within
the Commonwealth demand for something like 2,500,000
lbs. of Queensland tobacco per annum; and Mr. R. S.
Neville, the Government instructor in tobacco culture,
has stated that this might easily be increased to
5.500.000 lbs. if the farmers would try to meet the
demands of the trade. At present the State is produc-
ing, or shortly before the war was producing, only
500.000 lbs. each year. The tobacco industry at Texas
is likely to develop to substantial national importance.
Natural conditions of soil and climate in every way
prove suitable to this form of intense sub-tropical
form of agriculture. Within the vicinity of Texas lies
the little township of Silverspur, where a company with a
capital of £25,000, is mining for silver.
Increase in the agriculturists of the State, with a
resultant pushing-out further from the seaboard of
those in search of new land, coupled with the adoption
of southern and American methods of so cultivating the
soil as to retain the moisture below the surface, and
to make the most of what little rain does fall in an
GOONDIWINDI.
shared respectively by the two industries in the activities
of the local station managers under normal conditions.
A natural advantage favouring the enterprise of stock-
raising in the neighbourhood lies in the plentiful
supply of sub-artesian water which is obtained at com-
paratively shallow depths. In many instances windmills
are established in order to pump the water to the
surface. Within the same district lies the little town-
ship of Talwood, which is also on the railway, but is
54 miles further from Brisbane than is Goondiwindi.
A somewhat similar distance to the east is Inglewood,
carrying a population within the shire of that name
amounting to about 3,600 persons, and south of Ingle-
wood is the noted Texas district, the part of Queensland
most suited for the cultivation of tobacco. Here a con-
siderable quantity of leaf for pipe tobacco is annually
produced, and a substantial factory has been established
for treating the product. This enterprise has long passed
the experimental stage, and now forms one of those
assets of the State which are reasonably sure of
unusually dry year, will assuredly turn Goondiwindi
into an important wheat-producing centre, just as the
same influences wrought that electrifying change in so
many townships of the wheat belt in western Victoria, in
the north of that State, and in the Riverina, besides other
districts of New South Wales. Like much of these latter
territories the Goondiwindi plains are formed as though
Nature had set them out for cereal production on a
big scale. For miles the plough may travel in a straight
line without meeting a single obstruction. Mixed
farming and fattening lambs for export, as well as
subsidiary industries, will follow. The land may be
acquired at prices and terms which certainly are
favourable to the holder who is making any headway
whatever at agricultural pursuits, and who holds an
area suited to that form of enterprise. The laws of
supply and demand should account for these changes
taking place when the general conditions of population,
industry, and finance throughout the State should
warrant them being made.


Boonah.
The town of Boonah lies fifty-nine miles from Bris-
bane on a line due south of Ipswich, and is the terminus
of a railway which taps a fertile and well-watered tract of
originally heavily-timbered country. Boonah has a popu-
lation of about 1,000 peoijle, which is steadily increasing,
whilst the inhabitants of the surrounding shire number
9,000. General agriculture and dairying form the main-
stay of the prosperity of the rich Fassifern district in
■which Boonah is the principal commercial centre. The
name “Boonah” is taken from the native tongue, in
which it signifies the bloodwood tree.
Boonah is situated on a site which originally formed
part of the “Dugandan” Station, one of the earliest of
Queensland’s pastoral holdings. The run was taken up
originally by Mr. Macquarie McDonald, who arrived
at the spot on August 1, 1844. The settlement thus
dates back to only four years later than the selection
by Patrick Leslie of the first station to be established
in Queensland. In those days the surrounding country
w T as heavily timbered, and was altogether isolated from
civilization. The blacks of the neighbourhood were
numerous and warlike, and the early pioneer never
left his homestead without being fully armed to meet
any attack which might be made. He lived here with
his young wife, and a family was born in the midst of a
primeval forest surrounded by dangers and difficulties.
Boonah is a tastefully laid-out town, and in its public
buildings and institutions manifests the solid prosperity
of the primary industry wdiich is making its development
proceed rapidly. A public hospital, a well-appointed
school of arts, a successful pastoral and agricultural
society, a horticultural society, various sporting clubs,
and social and mutual benefit organizations all testify
to the prolific character of the natural resources of the
surrounding country; whilst the local butter factory
handles an increasing volume of the produce which has
done so much to improve land values and add to the
incomes of the farmers of Fassifern. The local weekly
auction sales show that in pig-raising and other sub-
sidiary industries the landholders are diversifying their
efforts and giving variety to the production of the district.
At several places close to the town, and in one
instance within Boonah itself, coal appears upon the
surface of the soil. Naturally, owing to its exposure to
the air, it contains but little gas, but it is possible that
coal of much better quality lies at a small depth. The
high commercial quality of the forest timbers is respon-
sible for the presence of two sawmills, in which several
varieties of timber, including different species of pine
and hardwood, are dealt with. Among the woods
treated is the long-neglected but now much-valued

crow’s-foot ash. Water is obtained through the sur-
rounding district by boring to but a shallow depth. That
which is so obtained is found to possess a high com-
mercial value, and Boonah Spa water now commands
a considerable sale throughout Queensland. The dis-
covery of kerosene shale has been reported, but up to
the present no steps have been taken to exploit this
valuable resource. A certain amount of ironstone has


also been found. But, taken as a whole, the district
cannot be regarded as metalliferous. Practically the
whole of the industrial activities in the surrounding
country have been concentrated upon agriculture, dairy-
ing, and timber getting, and for the development of
these resources alone very many times the present popu-
lation are needed.
The Fassifern district is rich in latent wealth. The
soil is wonderfully fertile and extends down to an
unusual depth. The rainfall is ample, whilst the pre-
sence of a railway, and the comparatively short distance
to the metropolis and to a port, protect the producer
from the handicap imposed on some of his competitors
by reason of high freights. One of the bars which has
typical of that j:>art of Queensland, which for rugged
grandeur, combined with pleasant farming views, is
second to none in the Commonwealth. The physical
characteristics denote cattle country of a high carrying
capacity. In the very early days of squatting in the
locality of Dugandan the runs were stocked with sheep.
There were no fences, and the flocks had to be con-
stantly watched by shepherds, being taken out to graze
in the day time and secured in folds during the nights.
Difficulty was experienced in procuring shepherds when
the gold rushes broke out in the southern States; and
the climate and soil proved unsuitable to sheep, many
diseases breaking out among the flocks. Consequently,
the raising of sheep was abandoned and a herd of cattle

restricted industrial development undoubtedly lies in
the immense forests with which so much of the very
fertile country is clothed. As in other parts of
Australia, where fertile soil co-exists with a bountiful
rainfall, the producer must hack his home and his farm
from mighty forests, the very appearance of which would
serve to turn away the faint hearted. But unlike other-
regions of the Commonwealth which are analagous to
this, the timbers of the Boonah district bear a high
value, and thus the cost of clearing does not appear as
an outlay against which no immediate return appears.
The town lies in a depression surrounded with the
blue outlines of imposing mountains. The scenery is
placed on the run. Ever since those times the district has
been noted as the breeding and fattening ground for some
of the best beef breeds in the State. The well-known
“Coochin Coochin” property, owned by Mr. E. T. Bell,
originally was portion of the old “Dugandan” run. In
latter days the former came to rank as one of the most
noted estates in that part of Queensland, and when some
few years ago part of it was subdivided for purposes of
sale, a big impetus was given to the dairying industry,
some of the purchasers paying up to £2B per acre for
the freehold and establishing permanent and prosperous
homes by supplying the Boonah factory with cream,
besides developing subsidiary enterprises.


The scenery about Boonah is subject for comment
among every traveller who visits the district. The
mountains are rugged and grand, whilst the flats still
bear evidence of the vigorous growth of the mighty
forests which once hid the soil from the sun. The cele-
brated authoress, Mrs. Campbell Praed, who spent her
girlhood on “Maroon” Station, gives what probably is the
best description of the original scrub that has yet been
written. The following extract from her book “My
Australian Girlhood” is worthy of quotation, as it may
be taken as applying to the whole of that great area of
Queensland of which the Fassifern district may be
regarded as fairly typical. She writes:
“It used to take a whole day getting through Dugan-
dan scrub, for though its width was not great, progress
was extremely slow. A black boy had to go in front
with his tomahawk to chop away vines and remove logs,
and sometimes a huge tree would have fallen, which
necessitated camping awhile and the clearing of a fresh
track round it. Behind other black boys led spare
horses, which were buckled on as leaders when the buggy
came to a steep gully or slippery pinch. We children—
the elders of us —would walk on each side of the buggy
ready with large sticks or stones to prop the wheels
when the horses jibbed; but during camping times we
had opportunities of exploring the scrub, announcing
our whereabouts by occasional coo-ees and getting
answering calls, so that there should be no danger of
our being lost. The scrub was something like an Indian
jungle, only less dense. Here, where the sun never
penetrated, the rich soil and decaying vegetation gave
out an earthy and unforgettable smell. The trees had
glossy leaves and mostly bore berries —some poisonous;
others, like chuckie-chuckies and the wild purple plums,
wholesome and luscious. The quandongs were tall and
green, and there were trees with straight stems and
bare branches—the leafage all courting the sun at the
tops —which were festooned with vines; the thick mottled
stalks of some of these vines hung in loose coils like
those of a boa-constrictor. One, a curious parasite,
which evolves eventually into the Moreton Bay fig —
would shoot up snaky stems round some well-grown
homely tree, and the parasite suckers, spreading, meet-
ing, and growing together as they fed on the juices of
the supporting stem, would hug the friendly tree in a
deadly embrace till it gradually withered. Then the
fig, throwing out its own branches and spreading its
own leaves, would grow tall and bear fruit, and nothing
would be left of the original tree but a scarcely visible
rotting core. It is the cuckoo of the vegetable world—
this lusty, greedy Moreton Bay fig. Flowers dotted the
green —big blossoms of creepers, pale-yellow and cream
and mauve, and sometimes blood-red : and occasionally
one might see through the interlacing tangle a flame-tree
shining as though it were a burning bush. In the damp
places maiden-hair became almost a thicket, and there
were many kinds of fern, among them the hare’s foot,
the bird’s nest, and the staghorn, which last fastens its
round, great head to the boles of trees and pushes out
branching fronds shaped like the antlers of deer. There
is a soft hush in the scrub. Outside the grasshoppers
and locusts make a loud whirring ; that big kingfisher,
the laughing jackass, cachinnates unmelodiously ; cocka-
toos caw and parrots chatter. . . . Sometimes you
may hear the bell-bird, which is a call from fairyland ;
and there are the whip-bird, of which the ‘St ... wt ...
st ... wt’ sounds like the crack of a distant stockwhip;
and the coach-bird, which has a note resembling the
guttural click a driver makes with his tongue to
encourage his horses. There is, too, the tender Hoo-
hoo’ of the Wonga-wonga jhgeons; and then at 4 o’clock
the wallabies stir, and towards dusk the curlews begin
their melancholy wail, and if there’s a waterhole near
the swamp-pheasant gives its throaty gurgle. Now t and
then at midday halt the blacks would find a scrub
turkey’s nest, and then there would be great jubilation,
and if the eggs happened to be fresh they were roasted
in the ashes and eaten with our quartpot tea.”
For many years past a movement has been in progress
for the construction of a continuation of the Boonah rail-
way to a point which would link up with the great south-
ern line, thereby shortening the distance to Sydney by
some seveny miles, besides opening up a large area of rich
land that is not now 7 served by any means of transport.
Engineering difficulties have hitherto prevented this
project being carried into effect, formidable mountain
ranges having either to be crossed or tunnelled ; but so
obvious are the advantages which would accrue from the
work being done that the residents of the locality which
would directly benefit, as well as many other people in
the State, are optimistic as to the line being constructed
as soon as public funds render such an enterprise prac-
tical. Advantage would be taken of the pass known as
Spicer Gap, and the grades necessary need not be
greater than some which exist in portions of the
Brisbane-Sydney and the Sydney-Melbourne trunk lines.


WILLIAM RAMSDEN BOW-
MAN, chairman of the Goolman Shire
Council (1915), is a native of Queens-
land, having been born at Denelgin,
in the Coochin district, on May 12,
1875. He is a son of Mr. Frederic
Macarthur Bowman, who was one
of the pioneers of the Coochin
country, where he selected land as
far back as 1874, and successfully
carried on farming operations for
very many years. He took a promi-
nent part in the welfare of the
community, and was one of the first
honorary magistrates created in the
district. He now lives in retirement
at Brighton Road, South Brisbane.
Mr. W. R. Bowman’s great-grand-
father, Captain John Macarthur,
was a prominent figure in the early
days of New South Wales, and
achieved lasting fame by introducing
the first merino sheep to Australia,
a small draft of which animals he
had received as a present from the
hands of King George IV. The sub-
ject of our review received his
elementary education under private
tuition, subsequently attending a
school at Mount Alford, going
thence to the Ipswich Grammar
School, where he completed his
scholastic studies. He was articled
to Mr. L. F. Bernays (now of Too-
woomba), finishing his indentures
with Mr. W. H. Osborne (now of
the firm of Osborne & Waugh of

Brisbane). Following his admission
as a solicitor of the Supreme Court
of Queensland in 1902, Mr. Bowman
commenced the practice of his pro-
fession at Boonah, where he
continued on his own behalf for five
years, at the expiration of that time
being joined in partnership by Mr.
C. B. Darvall, when the now well-
known firm of Bowman & Darvall
Hyllsted, Brisbane.

was founded. Apart from his pro-
fessional interests Mr. Bowman
engages in farming, being the owner
of a property of some 250 acres,
situated within easy distance of
Boonah township. He makes a hobby
of the breeding of thorough-bred
horses and ponies, and stock
from his farm has gained many
prizes at the various shows held in
the neighbourhood. For many years
he has taken an active part in
furthering the interests of the town
and district, and his active co-opera-
tion and support is readily forth-
coming in all matters affecting the
welfare of the community. In 1904
he served a term as member of the
Goolman Shire Council, and in 1913
was again elected to that body as
representative for No. 3 division,
being elected chairman of the Coun-
cil in February of the present year
(1915). He is also a committeeman
of the Boonah Hospital and of the
Chamber of Commerce, besides which
he is connected in one way or
another with practically all the
public institutions of the town. He
is a past master of the Teviot Lodge
of Freemasons, and at the present
time fills the office of treasurer.
In 1908 Mr. Bowman married
Linda Roy, daughter of Mr. H.
Coutts, manager of the Boonah
branch of the Queensland National
Bank, his family consisting of one
son and one daughter. Mrs. Bow-
man is widely known in musical
circles throughout Queensland, both
as an executant and composer of
pianoforte music, one of her most
popular contributions to the art
being the favourite number “Awake,
Arise !”
CHOLMONDELEY BURNETT
DARVALL, solicitor, Boonah, is a
great-grandson of Major Darvall,
who came to Australia in the
thirties, and settled at Rydedale,
near Ryde, New South Wales, where
he owned large tracts of country on
the Parramatta River, and was
engaged extensively in fruit cultiva-
tion, primarily oranges. Major
Darvall, who lived to a great age,
was the father of a large family of
sons, among whom the eldest, George
Edward Darvall, was attached to the
Indian service, and served for some
time under Sir Henry Norman,
ultimately retiring on a pension;
and the second, Sir John Bailey
Darvall, occupied a prominent posi-
tion in the Mother State for many
years, including that of Attorney-
General in the first New South
Wales Ministry. The third son,
Frederick Orme Darvall, embarked
on a military career, but while Still
a young man sold his commission
and settled in New South Wales,
afterwards coming to Queensland,
where eventually he received the
appointment of Auditor-General,
which he filled for many years. He
retired on a pension, and died in
England in the year 1886. His


eldest son, Frederick Orme Francis
Darvall, father of the gentleman
under review, was born at Penrith,
New South Wales, in 1847, and
made his advent to the Northern
State when about 20 years of age.
After spending a year on "Degilbo”
Station he took up his residence at
Brisbane, where he became con-
nected with the Civil Service, in
which he continued for many years,
attaining to the position of chief
clerk in the Under-Secretary’s office,
and later being appointed Curator of
Intestate Estates, and finally Chief
Inspector of Distilleries, in which
office he was succeeded by Mr.
Parry Oakden. His health broke
dowm, and after travelling in New
Zealand for some months he returned
to Sydney, and died there in 1887.
The late Mr. Darvall interested him-
self in the development of the
military spirit in Queensland, and
was a lieutenant in the field artillery
in its infancy in this State. He
married Deborah, daughter of the
late Lieutenant Joseph North, of the
68th Light Infantry Regiment,
whose father, the late Major North,
served under the Duke of Welling-
ton at Waterloo, and in later years
followed his son to Queensland, and
was associated with him in pastoral
pursuits. The late Lieutenant
North came to Australia in the late
thirties on board the sailing vessel
"Sarah,” under command of Captain
Wooten, in charge of a shipload of
prisoners, and subsequent to dis-
embarking was retained by the
Colonial Office for a considerable
period to continue the supervision
which he had conducted in so admir-
able a manner throughout the
voyage. Later he sold his commis-
sion, and directed his attention to
pastoral enterprise in New South
Wales, finally settling in the More-
ton Bay district, on the Brisbane
River, where in partnership with his
father he took up the large pastoral
stations known as "Wivenhoe,”
"Fernie Lawn,” and "Bellevue,”
referred to in other portions of this
work. The late Lieutenant North
married Robert Dundas, daughter of
the late John Burnett, barrister,
and last Judge Admiral of Scot-
land, and by this union there was a
family of eight sons and two
daughters, of whom the sons are all
associated with pastoral pursuits in
North Queensland and on the Bris-
bane River. Mrs. Darvall was born
and brought up at "Wivenhoe,”
then a big sheep station, at one time
in conjunction with "Bellevue,”
where Major North resided, carrying
80,000 sheep. At the period in
question no railways had been built,
all transport being done by horses
and bullock teams, and though
highly improved, with comfortable
homesteads, these properties retained
much of the original valuable rose-
wood and cedar forest timbers, which
have proved a profitable asset to
subsequent owners. Of a family of
11 children born to Mr. and Mrs.
Frederick Orme Francis Darvall,
five sons and three daughters sur-
vived their father at his decease,
and of these the eldest son, Edwin
Orme Darvall, died as the result of
an operation in 1911. This gentle-
man was associate to Mr. Justice
Chubb at Townsville, and subse-
quently practised as a solicitor in
Brisbane until the time of his death.
MAJOR E. O. DARVALL.
He was greatly interested in military
matters, and held the commission of
major in the field artillery, tie
married Anabella, daughter of the
Hon. B. D. Morehead, by whom he
had issue two sons and one daughter.
The second son, Major Frederick
Joseph Dundas Darvall, in 1915
occupied the appointment of camp
commandant at Broadmeadows, and
is now on the headquarters staff in
the permanent forces at Melbourne.
Mr. Guy Francis Darvall is man
ager of the Queensland National
Bank at Cunnamulla; and the fifth
and youngest son, Roy Darvall,
proceeded to England at the
outbreak of the great war, and
after a brief period of train-
ing at Oxford obtained his
commission of lieutenant in the
14 th Service Battalion of Rifles.
Mr. Cholmondeley Burnett Darvall,
fourth son of the late F. O. F.
Darvall, was born at “Wattlebrae,”
Bowen Bridge Road, Brisbane, and
received his education at Kelvin
Grove State School, Bowen House
School, and at the Boys’ Grammar
School, Brisbane. After leaving the
latter institution he passed his first
law examination, and then entered
the Commercial Bank of Australia at
Brisbane, with which he was con-
nected for four years. He was then
articled to his elder brother, the late
Edwin Orme Darvall, and after
being admitted as a solicitor in 1906,
took up his residence at Boonah,
where he has since practised in part-
nership with Mr. W. R. Bowman.
Like his brothers he has given con-
siderable attention to military mat-
ters, and held the commission of
lieutenant in the field artillery, now
being on the retired list. He
married Nina, daughter of Mr. J. G.
Vidgen, late secretary to the Bris-
bane Gas Company, now of advanced
age, and living in retirement at
Enoggera. Of the marriage there
are two sons and one daughter.
Councillor WILLIAM FARLEY,
a prominent townsman of Boonah,
was born on February 10, 1867, at
Upton-on-Severn, Worcestershire,
England, being a son of the late
John Farley, who followed the call-
ing of gardener and seedsman in
that place, which had been the home
of several generations of his family.
Until 16 years of age Mr. Farley
remained at school, and subsequently
spent a few months in gaining a
knowledge of the bakery trade. In
the latter part of 1883, when still
only a lad in his seventeenth year,
he embarked for Australia by the
sailing ship “Otago,” arriving at
Brisbane on January 24, 1884, after
an eventful voyage covering a
period of four months. Undaunted
by the circumstance of being a
stranger in a strange land, Mr.
Farley sought employment in a
bakery at Ipswich, where he
remained for 12 months. He next
proceeded to Bowral, New South
Wales, and was engaged in the trade
for a similar period in that centre.
Journeying back to Queensland,
after three months at Ipswich, in
1887 he came to Boonah, then little
more than a tract of virgin bush,
from which centre he assisted in the
erection of buildings at the township
of Dugandan; but at a later period
Mr. Farley decided to resume his


earlier avocation, and entered the
employ of a Mr. Behrendorff, who
had opened a bakery in the infant
settlement. After two years he pur-
chased his master’s interests, and
Hyllsted, Brisbane.
MR. WILLIAM FARLEY.
carried on the business very success-
fully for nearly 20 years, ultimately
relinquishing it to establish the
aerated water factory which he now
owns and controls. Outside his
industrial proposition he gives a con-
siderable amount of attention to the
breeding of Timor ponies, and has
met with much success in his fre-
quent exhibition of this class of
stock at the Ipswich, Boonah, and
Brisbane shows. A very lengthy list
of honours includes 5 championships,
while one pony alone (“Melba”) can
lay claim to about 50 prizes. In
his exhibits of black Orpington fowls
at the various poultry shows he has
also scored strongly, holding three
grand championships for this par-
ticular breed. As one of Boonah’s
leading citizens he has been called
upon in various directions to sustain
the dignity of public office, and for
many years has served as a member of
the Goolman Shire Council, being
chairman of the finance committee

man of the council in 1899 and
1914. As president of the local
school of arts, vice - president of
the Boonah Hospital and of
the Agricultural Show committee,
president of the Boonah Football
Club, vice-president of the Boonah
Jockey Club, he wields considerable
influence in the life of the town. He
was the first captain of the Boonah
Rifle Club and for three years acting
colour-sergeant in the Queensland
Defence Forces. He has always been
a leading spirit in the organizing of
benefit entertainments, when his
gifts as a vocalist and entertainer
have been freely given; and
in all matters of clean outdoor
sport his patronage may be readily
reckoned upon. Mr. Farley is a

SAMUEL DOVER, J.P., man-
ager of the Boonah Butter Factory,
Boonah, was born at Bradford,
Yorkshire, on May 3, 1866, and is
a son of the late James Dover, of
Bradford, an engineer who was con-
nected with the Great Northern
Railway Company in England for
upwards of 30 years. The gentleman
under review remained at school
until 16 years of age, when he
turned his attention to the calling
followed by his father ; but although
the work proved of considerable
interest to him, it failed to
satisfy the adventurous spirit which
demanded knowledge of the great
world outside of the limited sphere
in which his days had been passed.
Accordingly, at 22 years of age he
left England by the steamship
“Taroba,” and landed at Cooktown,
Queensland, in August, 1888, after
arrival proceeding to the Daintree
River, where he worked on a banana
plantation for about 18 months, at
the end of which time he came to
Brisbane, and entered the employ of
Messrs. Smellie & Co., machinery
merchants, etc. At this time the
Government of the day was giving
a good deal of encouragement to the
dairying industry, and perceiving in
this a field of enterprise not yet
overdone, Mr. Dover began to
qualify himself for the work by
taking a position with the Central
Dairying Co., the first concern of its
kind in the State, and which was
responsible for the introduction to
Queensland of the now widely-used
cream separator. After two years
with the firm, during which he made
the best use of his time, the oppor-
tunity was presented to Mr. Dover
of putting to a practical test the
knowledge he had gained. Mr. John
Mahon, late principal of Gatton
Agricultural College, had travelled
through the Fassifern district, lec-
turing on the dairying industry, and
following in his wake Mr. Dover
erected creameries in several centres.
Prior to this time the Lowood
Creamery Co. had purchased the
interests of the Central Company in
the Fassifern district, and in 1901
the erection of the Boonah Butter
Factory was entrusted to Mr. Dover,
which from a small beginning has
now attained to such proportions
that it is able to maintain an output
of 100 tons of butter per month,
The factory has made excellent pro-
gress, and was successful in carry-
ing off all prizes for butter at the
Brisbane Show in 1910. In 1907
the concern was taken over by the
Queensland Farmers’ Co-operative
Co., and the proprietors are now
(1915) on the eve of erecting a new
building, which will give to Boonah
the distinction of possessing one of
the largest, most up-to-date butter
factories in Australia. The success
of the concern has been almost
entirely due to Mr. Dover, who as
manager has won the full confidence
of the farmers upon whom the
supply of milk depends, and estab-
lished a sound reputation for the
products turned out by the factory.
Mr. Dover also owns a couple of
farms which are worked on the share
system. Public affairs also occupy
a fair portion of his time and atten-
tion, and he was one of the founders
of the Boonah Agricultural Associa-
tion, of which he has since continued
an active member. He is a past
district grand officer of the local
Masonic lodge; and takes a promi-
nent interest in the affairs of the

THOMAS HENRY GARTSIDE,
J.P., auctioneer and commission
agent, Boonah, is a native of
Queensland, having been born at
Brisbane on November 28, 1875. He
is a son of the late James Gartside,
of Brisbane, who was connected with
the Queensland Civil Service as chief
draughtsman in the Department of
Railways. The late gentleman was
also prominent in military affairs in
the early days of the State, and
held the rank of colonel, being in
command of the Ist Queenslanders,
Moreton Regiment, at the time of
his death, which occurred in 1897.
The gentleman under review pursued
his scholastic studies at the Brisbane
Grammar School, where he con-
tinued until 17 years of age. Upon
leaving this institution he joined the

Bank, and was associated with the
head office at Brisbane for several
years. He was next transferred to
Charleville, subsequently being pro-
moted to the position of relieving
officer, a position he filled for
some considerable time. Prom here
he was sent to Laidley, and
after 12 months in the bank’s
service at this centre resigned to
take over a cordial factory business,
which he canned on for some time
with marked success, Eventually
Mr. Gartside joined in partnership
Mr. Whitworth, an auctioneer and
commission agent of Laidley, and
in 1911 enlarged the operations of
the firm by opening up a branch
business at Boonah. A few months
later, however, the partnership was
dissolved, Mr. Whitworth retaining
the parent business at Laidley, while
Mr. Gartside remained at Boonah,
where he has since built up a very
fine connection. Among the promi-
nent firms which he represents are
the International
Harvester Company,
A.M.P. Society, Royal
Insurance Company,
Norwich Union Fire
Insurance Company,
Ocean Accident and
Life Insurance Com-
pany, Employers’ Lia-
bility Insurance Com-
pany, etc., and tran-
sactions in land and
stock are carried out
in all parts of the Com-
monwealth. Besides
the regular monthly
cattle sales, Mr. Gart-
side conducts a weekly
pig sale in Boonah, and sales of a
miscellaneous character are also held
in the spacious sale room, where a
fine show of farming implements
and machinery is made. Mr. Gart-
side holds fortnightly stock sales
at Harrisville, Roadvale, Towns-
hend, and Kalbar, and it is
a generally recognized fact that the
success of these functions is mainly
due to his energy and efficiency,
Mr. Gartside possessing in a marked
degree the qualities of the true
auctioneer. He played an important
part in the sale of the famous
“Coochin Coochin” Estate, held on
April 7, 1915, when he was joint
auctioneer with Messrs. Isles, Love,
and Co., of Brisbane. He worked
indefatigably to make a success of
the sale, and his efforts were
rewarded by the presence of a great
concourse of people, which included
many buyers from distant parts of
Australia. It may be mentioned in
passing that this important event
attracted upwards of 1,000 buyers,
and some 7,000 acres were sold, the
total amount realized being in the
vicinity of £60,000. Portions of the
unimproved land sold at £22 10s.

ings commanded £26 10s. per acre,
which constituted a record in
Queensland for average per acre,
Mr. Gartside interests himself in
public affairs, and for the past two
years (1914-15) has filled the chair of
the Boonah Chamber of Commerce,
while he is also on the committee of
the local agricultural society. In
racing circles he acts as starter for
the Boonah Race Club, and at the
annual meeting of the local friendly
societies. He is a past master of the
Masonic lodge, in which he also
holds rank as past district grand
lodge officer. As a hobby Mr. Gart-
side interests himself in the breeding
of Berkshire pigs, and is the owner

coast. His father, the late Hirsch
Tow, carried on the trade of a book-
seller in his native land, and was
a linguist of some ability, acting as
tutor in the Hebrew language to a
large class of boys. Being a man
of progressive views and strong
democratic principles, and seeing
little chance of improvement in
the social conditions prevailing in
Russia, he determined to seek a
more enlightened country in which

that his sons should never serve
under conscription, he departed
quietly to London, where he obtained
much information of importance to
uu
the fulfilment of his plans, after
which he returned to Russia, bearing
"passports” which he had had pre-
pared for his sons and nephews,
which would enable them, once they
had crossed into Germany, to con-
tinue their journey unmolested. The
party, consisting of himself, two
sons, one daughter, and two nephews,
travelled in a caravan along the most
unfrequented road,
and maintaining
the strictest secrecy
eventually they
escaped over the
frontier at Memel.
From Memel they
journeyed by
rail to Stettin,
thence to Ham-
burg, finally cros-
sing to England,
where on arrival
they went direct
to the large
emigrant centre at
Blackball, London.
Two weeks later
they sailed by the “Mercara,”
and arrived in Brisbane in 1889,
the ship being beached at Break-
fast Creek, and the passengers
taken off by the tugf “Beaver.”
The subject of this article was at
that time a boy of 13, and having
considerable independence of charac-
ter, he took a position in the drapery
establishment of Mr. John Williams,
of Brisbane, receiving half-a-crown
a week, with board and lodging, in
return for his services. Though
unacquainted with the English lan-
guage, his know-
ledge of Russian
and German stood
him in good stead,

months later he
transferred his
services to the
firm of Messrs.
Piggott & Burns,
of South Brisbane,
Subsequently upon
the dissolution
of this partnership, Mr. Piggott,
having discovered his employe’s
fluency in the German language,
offered him a position in his store
at Boonah, where there was a large
German population, which Mr. Tow
accepted, taking up his duties under
the management of Mr. R. H.
Nosworthy, the place at that period
being little more than a bush settle-
ment of some half a dozen dwellings.
At a later date Mr. Nosworthy pur-
chased the business, and on June 1,
1913, Mr. Tow took over the interest
in partnership with Mr. W. R.

Mr. Humphries died, since when
Mr. Tow has continued operations
on his own account, two fine estab-
lishments at Boonah and a branch
store at Roadvale testifying to the
business ability and enterprise which
have marked his career. The Boonah
store is devoted to grocery and
drapery departments, while the other
houses contain large stocks of iron-
mongery, furniture, farm imple-
ments, produce, etc. Keen and
alert to business advantage, Mr.
Tow, when the construction of the
Munbilla-Sandy Creek railway was
begun, erected an iron store, from
which supplies were being sold to
the navvies within 24 hours of the
commencement of the work. In
public affairs he has his place as a
member of the local Chamber of
Commerce, and has closely identified
himself with all movements having
for their object the advancement of
the town and district. He is a
member of the local branch of the
Ancient Order of Foresters, and
takes an active part in the organiza-
tion of entertainments for charitable
objects. Mr. Tow married on
June 20, 1900, Hannah, daughter of
the late George Hunter, mining
engineer, of Northumberland, Eng-
land, who came to Queensland about
1899, the issue of the union being
three sons and three daughters.


JAMES ELLIOT, “The Cedara,”
Boonah, was born at Hollybush,
near Galashiels, in the shire of
Selkirk, Scotland, on March 10,
1853, and is a eon of the late Walter
Hyllsted, Brisbane.
MR. JAMES ELLIOT.
Elliot, a descendant of the family of
that name whose members were so
long associated with the far-famed
Galashiels weaving industry, in the
establishment and building up of
which they took a leading part, and
which in its turn has served to per-
petuate the memory of those enter-
prising industrial pioneers, to whom
much of the notable reputation of
Galashiels is due. The gentleman
under review received his education
chiefly at Anstruther, and at the
age of 16 left school to join the staff
of the Inland Revenue Office in the
Civil Service of Scotland. Three
years of office life sufficed to convince
him that his temperament was not
suited to the monotonous routine
of indoor occupation, and at the end
of this period he retired from the
service with the intention of direct-
ing his energies to farming pursuits.
With this aim in view he proceeded
to Bonchester, near Hawick, where
his father had settled down to
dairying occupations, and applying
himself with industry and diligence
to the work in hand he very soon
obtained a good grip of the methods
in vogue on the farm, and became
an expert judge with regard to the
best types of stock for dairying pur-
poses. Marrying young, he was
naturally anxious to improve his
position and prospects, and having
given heed to reports current in the
Old Country respecting the possibil-
ities offered by Australia to strong
and willing workers, finally he made
the definite decision to cut himself
adrift from the many ties that
bound him to the land of his birth
and to cross the seas to that part of
Greater Britain represented by the
colony of Queensland. After a four-
months’ trip by the barque “Too-
woomba,” he arrived at Moreton Bay
in March, 1873, and immediately
after landing, with his young wife
proceeded to “Coochin-Coochin” Sta-
tion, where they took a position as
married couple on the old historic
property then owned by Messrs.
Scott, Henderson, & Co., and under
the management of Mr. T. Alford,
whose name has been bestowed on a

.well-known mountain in the vicinity.
After two years on this station,
during which he made the most of
the excellent opportunities afforded
him of becoming acquainted with the
conditions under which his life was
thenceforward to be spent, Mr.
Elliot secured a post on “Koor-
albyn” Station, the property of Mr.
Haygarth, and following this period
of service he was employed in hand-
ling the stock at “Maroon,” which
even at that early period was in
possession of the Murray-Prior fam-
ily, its present owners. At a later
period he spent about six years as
stock hand with the late Campbell
Macdonald, on the old “Dugandan”
Station, where he still further
.enlarged his experience, and was
able, with the co-operation of his
capable and thrifty wife, to save a
little capital with a view to launch-
ing out on his own account. Having
decided that the time was ripe for
this venture, he took up his present
holding, now known as “The Cedars,”
and embarked with stout heart on
the preliminary work of develop-
ment. This was hard and continu-
ous, involving much hardship and
privation in the home, and calling
for unlimited patience, perseverance,
and industry in the fields. To add
to the discouraging factors of the
situation prices prevailing were very
low, and the long distance to the
nearest market (Ipswich, 30 miles
away) made the two weekly trips
costly as to time, and still further
reduced the small profits obtained
on the farm produce. The roads at
this period were mere tracks cut
through the scrub, making cartage
both difficult and tardy; and it
speaks volumes for the grit and
determination of these early pioneers
that they were able to pursue their
enterprise in the face of such diffi-
culties, and win through to a suc-
cessful issue. Fifteen years elapsed
before the young couple found
themselves fairly “out of the wood,”
with the sun of prosperity shining
well overhead; and it was not until
then that Mr. Elliot saw his way
clear to adding to his original hold-
ing of 160 acres, which was by this
time thoroughly well improved. At

indulge his natural desire for the
acquirement of further acreage, and

son of the late Thomas Hardcastle,
one of the pioneer farmers of the
Dugandan district, where he claimed

to have been the first to put an axe
into the dense brigalow scrub in the
immediate vicinity of what is now
well known as the thriving settle-
ment of Boonah. The late Thomas
Hardcastle was a native of the
village of Skelton, near Ripon,
Yorkshire, England, the date of his
birth being November 11, 1835. His
father, John Hardcastle, a farrier-
sergeant in the Royal Horse Artil-
lery, whilst stationed at Dublin
married Catherine Ross, an Irish,
girl of good family, and afterwards
returned to Skelton, where he and
his two brothers carried on business
as farriers, veterinary surgeons, and
blacksmiths. Thomas Hardcastle lost
both parents at an early age, and
had a hard life working for neigh-
bouring farmers until 17 years of
age. He then sought to better his
conditions and prospects by entering
upon a seafaring life, and whilst
afloat experienced many ups and
downs. On one occasion his ship
grounded on the dreaded Goodwin
Sands, in the English Channel, but
fortunately the crew was able to get
her off, thus avoiding the raid of the
wreckers, who made it their custom
to loot such luckless vessels, which
they regarded as their lawful prey.
Mr. Hardcastle was running the
blockade in the Baltic Sea during
the Crimean War; and for some time
served as quartermaster on a mail
steamer plying across the • Atlantic
to and from New York. He came
from the latter port to Melbourne
during the Victorian gold rushes of
the late fifties, landing at Port
Phillip in 1858. Joining the rush,
he experienced the usual vicissitudes
of the prospector, which left him
disillusioned, and after ‘Tending a
hand” on a potato farm, where he
demonstrated the superiority of
horses over bullocks for ploughing,
he returned to Melbourne, and for
a subsequent period was engaged in
the coastal shipping trade, after-
wards putting in a term on the old
“Hawk,” running from Brisbane to
Ipswich. In 1861 he married Mary
M'Dougall, who arrived at Brisbane
by the ship “Alfred” in 1858, and
the newly-wedded couple opened a
boarding-house in George Street,
known in after years as “Blackall
House.” Here they did exceedingly
well, the place being a great resort
of the Oxley farmers, who brought
their produce to Brisbane by boat.
Mr. Hardcastle eventually was per-
suaded to erect an hotel at the Pour
Mile Swamp, on the Ipswich Road,
then a stopping place for Cobb and
Co.’s coaches, and whilst conducting
this hostelry with his wife he
attended the ceremony in connection
with the opening of the first section
of the railway line from Ipswich to
Grandchester —then called Bigge’s
Camp. After the construction of the
railway from Brisbane to Ipswich
the coaches were withdrawn, and Mr.
Hardcastle failing to make the hotel
pay, sold out his interest, and in
September, 1877, removed with his
family to Dugandan, where he
entered upon farming pursuits. For
10 years with his wife and children
he resided in the slab house of four
rooms, first erected on low-lying
land on the new holding—the site
of which is now marked by a bunya
pine tree. Hardly had they vacated
this old home for a new dwelling-on
a higher site when the great flood of
1887 occurred, and their original
homestead was submerged to a
depth of eight feet. The Hardcastle
family became thoroughly versed in
all the experiences of life common
to the pioneer settlers of early days
in Queensland. Like their neigh-
bours, they slaved from dawn to
dark,- clearing and burning off the
dense scrub, which was infested with
all kinds of vermin, and became
inured to the shock of finding snakes
curled up on their beds, or stretched
along the rafters. Wallabies in
thousands made raids on any corn
paddocks unprotected by paling-
fences, and opossums and cockatoos
played havoc with the ripening grain
by day and by night; yet when the
crop was harvested in spite of these
pests, it frequently realized only
Is. 6d. per bushel, 9d. of which had
to be paid for cartage to Ipswich, a
distance of 35 miles. Butter was
often sold at 6d. per lb., and home-
cured bacon for 3d. Co-operative
butter and bacon factories were non-
existent; and railways for the
transport of produce to the markets
were as yet a dream of the future.
The late Mr. Hardcastle, spite of the
incessant demands made upon his
time by his private interests, found
time to assist the community at
large in various ways, and his
efforts to secure suitable educational
facilities for the younger portion of
the population, both at Yeronga and
at Boonah, are deserving of record.
In both places he assisted in raising
funds for the erection of school
buildings, and his wife played a
most active part in obtaining signa-
tures to a petition relating to the
position of the Boonah school, which
at that time was the only one in the
district. Mr. and Mrs. Hardcastle
also lent their influence and support
towards the establishment of the
first Methodist Church in Boonah,
donating an acre of land as a site for
a church building, and opening their
home freely in the extension of

died on March 3, 1914, at Castle

brooch, now known as the Royal
Brooch of Lorn, is held to the pre-
sent day by the Chief of the Clan
of Dunolly Castle, who guards it as
a priceless treasure. The late Mrs.
Hardcastle was the youngest child
of a family of 15, and after the
death of her mother—a member of
the Connel family, after which
Connel Ferry, near Oban, was
named—remained with her father
until his decease, when she decided
to accompany her sister-in-law to
Australia, three years later becom-
ing the wife of the late Mr. T.

and was brought up at Yeronga,
where he attended the local public
school until 14 years of age. After
a year spent in the service of the
Telegraph Department of Queens-
land, he resigned in order to accom-

his full share of the pioneer work
on the farm. Four years later he

accomplished in a comparatively
short space of time, working through
the various grades until he was

duty pointed to Dugandan, and in

horn strains —the Devon to give the
high percentage of butter-fat for
which the breed has been distin-
guished for over 100 years, and to
fix the rich red colour that predom-
inates in Illawarras; the Ayrshire
to contribute the prolonged period
of lactation, and the hardy constitu-
tion so desirable in milking cows;
and the shorthorn for its heavy
flow of milk and larger size. The
Hardcastle finally succeeded in
persuading the National Society of
Queensland to recognize the type as
a pure breed. Once established as
such in high places, however,
Illawarras have had no difficulty in
maintaining their reputation among
the Queensland farmers and judges
of first-class dairy stock —of itself a
splendid vindication of Mr. Hard-
castle’s sound judgment on a matter
very vital to the interests of
the dairying community and to
the wide range of consumers.
It was in the late nineties that
he became convinced of the
superiority of the breed, and
realizing that a bright future lay
before it, in 1899 purchased the
Illawarra bull “Jamberoo,” then a
yearling, and 16 heifers which were
specially selected from the pick of
the leading herds in Illawarra dis-
trict. With these as a nucleus he
proportion to its size than any other
herd in the State. “Jamberoo” was
bred by Mr. Charles Faulkes, of
“Yellow Rock,” Jamberoo Moun-
tain, New South Wales, and on the
side of his sire is descended from the
famous “Major,” known to all
breeders of this class as one of the
foundation bulls of the breed. The
grand-dam of “Jamberoo” was pur-
chased from Mr. Badgery, of Sutton
Forest, and was from a pure short-
horn cow by a pure Devon bull,
bred by Mr. Maurice, of New South
Wales. In the early seventies these
cattle were known as “Devon-short-
horns,” but are now recognized in
England as Red Lincolns. The strain
of Ayrshire blood which “Jamberoo”
also possessed on his sire’s side
formed the combination necessary to
produce the ideal Illawarra. Seven of
the female progeny of this famous bull
were successful in winning champion
prizes as well as many milking
competitions, the most notable of
this class in Queensland being the
cow “Blossom III.,” bred by Mr.
Hardcastle, and sold as a two-year-
old to Mr. David Dunn, of Beau-
desert. A record of this animal
appears elsewhere in this work. It is
worthy of note that the six cows, a
photograph of which accompanies
the present article, viz., “Gem,”
“Diamond Jubilee,” “Whitelegs,”
“Fancy,” “Duchess,” and “Cicely,”
produced 20,000 lbs. of milk and
799 lbs. of butter during a three-
months’ test. “Gem” was the dam
of “Earl of Castle Hill” (by “Jam-
beroo”) and the first Queensland-bred
GROUP OF ILLAWARRA CATTLE. LEFT TO RIGHT: —“2nd EARL OF DUNMORE,” “DARLING 2ND,” “COUNTESS 3RD,” “EARL OF DUNMORE.”
Illawarra breed was originated and
perfected by the old pioneer dairy-
men of Illawarra, New South Wales,
nearly a century ago, and it was
with infinite trouble that Mr.
commenced breeding, and in time
built up the herd which has now
become renowned throughout the
whole State of Queensland, and has
produced more noted prizewinners in
bull to win the championship
of the State in the section for
shorthorn dairy cattle, this being
prior to the establishment of a
separate section for Illawarra cattle.


"Jamberoo” also attained special
distinction in being the first bull to
pass the test of the new Herd Book
of Queensland, his son, "Jamberoo
11. from "Whitelegs” taking second
place in the official volume. The last-
named bull is the sire of Mr. A.
Pickel’s champion cow "Florrie,”
which animal put up a record of
691 lbs. of milk and 3T7 lbs. of
butter in 24 hours, being a record
for all pure-bred cows in Queensland.
Another famous son of "Jamberoo”
is "Earl of Dunmore,” now being
used in the "Jinbiggaree” stud. This
bull and three of his progeny, all
bred by Mr. Hardcastle, won first
prize at the National Show for
group “Sire and three of his pro-
geny.” "Darling II.,” one of the
group, tested for the Herd Book
immediately afterwards, established
a record for a two-year-old, giving
864 lbs. of milk and 2'97 of butter
for 48 hours. Mr. Hardcastle’s
services as judge of stock in connec-
tion with agricultural shows are in
constant demand; and he is presi-
dent of the Illawarra Dairy Cattle
Association of Queensland, having
held this office ever since the
inception of the association, of which
he was practically the founder. He
has taken a prominent part in
the co-operative movement among
farmers, the success of which has

been particularly demonstrated in
the Fassifern district, to which his
efforts have been specially devoted.
He has assumed the lion’s share
of work in connection with the
movement in this district, and his
untiring zeal has earned for him un-
stinted praise from those having the
interests of co-operation at heart.
He is one of the founders of the
Boonah Co-operative Company, and
for seven years served as chairman
of directors of this organization,
having a monopoly of this office until
the company amalgamated with the
Queensland Farmers’ Co-operative
Company at Booval. He is the pre-
sent (1915) chairman of directors of
the Queensland Co-operative Bacon

Murarrie, one of the finest of its kind
in the Commonwealth, and capable
of treating upwards of 1,500 pigs
per week. Mr. Hardcastle is also a

took a keen pleasure in rifle-
shooting, and became one of the
promoters of the Railway Rifle Club,
the most successful association of this
nature in Queensland. Recently he
was honoured by the executive
of the club with a life membership
gold badge in recognition of his
valuable services, extending over
many years. As an active member
he attained considerable prestige as
a crack shot, and on several occasions
was chosen to represent the body in
interstate and international matches.
In the early eighties he served with
the Ist Queenslanders, C Company,
Infantry Volunteers, having a
couple of years’ military service, and
eventually this led to his promotion
to the above-mentioned club, which
was one of the first to be formed in
the Moreton Bay district. He served
for a number of years on the execu-
tive committees of the Queensland
Rifle Association and the Moreton
District Rifle Clubs Association.
He married in 1884 Elizabeth Knox,
daughter of the late William Dunn,
of Glasgow, for a lengthy period
manager of Long’s Match Works,
and inventor of several match-mak-
ing machines. Mr. Hardcastle has
a surviving family of two sons and
one daughter. The elder son, Mr.
T. W. Hardcastle, is associated with
his father in the management of the
home property, “Jinbiggaree,” while
the younger son is manager of the
Tweed Call newspaper in New South
Wales.


WILLIAM STEWART, of
“Hazelbank,” Boonah, was born at
Lockerbie, Dumfrieshire, Scotland,
on November 15, 1864, and is a son
of the late David Stewart, a well-
known breeder of Ayrshire cattle
and Clydesdale horses in that part of
the United Kingdom. The calling
may be said to be hereditary in this
branch of the Stewart family, long
past centuries having witnessed the
progenitors of the present genera-
tion engaged in pastoral enterprise,
which has continued largely to
occupy the attention of representa-
tives of the line right up to the
present day. Mr. William Stewart
was educated locally, and on
leaving school was taken in hand
by his father, from whom he
acquired a comprehensive knowledge

of the industry in which the latter
gentleman specialized. From the
first he was more attracted by the
horses than by the cattle, and gave
special attention to the handling of
the equine stock, in which eventually
he became very expert, the experi-
ence thus gained standing him : n
good stead in later years. Mr.
Stewart arrived in Queensland on
March 2, 1886, in company with his
younger brother, who has since
returned to the land of his birth.
The two young Scotsmen found
employment on a chicory plantation
in the Coomera district, where they
continued until the building of the
railway from Beenleigh to South-
port, when the gentleman under
review perceived the prospects of
speedier advancement in carting
timber for the sleepers and bridge-
construction work in connection with
the new line. A subsequent position
as assistant in a butchering business
at Bowen proved lucrative, and two.
years later lie proceeded in the sam<
capacity to Harrisville, which centre
he left to enter an establishment of
like nature at Boonah, in which he
had acquired an interest. In course
of time he became sole proprietor of
this business, which he conducted
personally for some years, and finally
disposed of in 1899. About that
year he purchased his present hold-
ing, "Hazelbank,” and has since
devoted his attention to mixed farm-
ing and dairying with good results,
while he makes a profitable hobby cf
the breeding of Clydesdale horses.
In the latter department Mr. Stew-
art has produced stud animals which
rank high as regards pedigree
among those the names of which
appear side by side with “Hazel-
bank” stock in the official Stud
Book of Victoria. One of his mares,
“Rosebud” (728), showing much
quality and a tested prizewinner,
was bred by Mr. Stewart in 1909,

Dugandan, Queensland, and White
Swamp, New South Wales, was
born in County Derry, Ireland, on
Hyllsted, Brisbane.
MR. JAMES COSSART.
April 12, 1857, and is a son of the
late Henry Cossart, of that county,
where his ancestors had dwelt for
many generations past. Young
Cossart as a child of seven accom-
panied his parents to Australia by
the sailing-ship “Flying Cloud,” the
date of their landing at Brisbane
being February, 1864. The late Mr.
Cossart purchased a farming pro-
perty at Highfields, near Toowoomba,
and for a number of years was
assisted by in the working of
this holding. Ultimately, however,
Mr. James Cossart decided to strike
out for himself, and engaging in the
timber-cutting industry, before long
was able to acquire a team of his
own, and continued successfully for
about five years. Though arduous,
the work was congenial to him, and
in 1887 he came to the Fassifern
district, and bought an interest in
the saw mills on Teviot Brook, then
owned by Mr. Josiah Hancock, pre-
viously of the firm of Thomas Han-
cock & Sons, the mills then being
situated about a quarter of a mile
distant from the present site. After
two years Mr. Cossart purchased his
partners’ interest, and became sole
owner in the concern, which he has
since carried on, suffering various
vicissitudes, but never allowing him-
self to be discouraged, so that to-day
he can look back on a prosperous
career, due in a large measure to the
spirit of optimism which has buoyed
him up, even in the face of serious
disaster. The year of his advent to
Dugandan (1887), besides being
marked by the completion of the
railway line to that centre, witnessed
what is known as the Big Flood,
which inundated the country with
disastrous results over a radius of
many miles. A decade later
occurred the first serious throwback
to Mr. Cossart’s private enterprise,
when on May 30, 1897, his mills
were reduced to ashes by an acci-
dental fire. Only some six Aveeks
prior to this event he had reduced
his insurance policy from £1,500 to
£5OO, a circumstance which ren-
dered the blow doubly severe; but
undaunted by this untoward event,
he immediately commenced the erec-
tion of a new mill on the slope of
Hyllsted, Brisbane.

the Dugandan township, a locality
commanding a view of picturesque
surroundings, including the moun-
tainous ridges of the Macpherson
Ranges. Here operations were con-
tinued satisfactorily, the year 1907
being marked by the admission of
his two sons into partnership; but
in 1907 misfortune was again
encountered, when the mills were
burnt down on September 28. Once
again they were rebuilt, and have
since maintained a steady, prosper-
ous course, at the present time being
responsible for an output of about
100,000 super feet of timber per
month. Pine and hardwoods are
taken in the rough, and turned out
from the mills ready for the builder
and carpenter, the source of supply
being mainly the vicinity of the
White Swamp mill, two miles over
the border, on the New South Wales
side, where by arrangement with the
Government of that State timber is
hewn from the forests, sawn, and
then transported across the Mac-
pherson Ranges to Dugandan. The
question of transport has been a
difficult problem to solve, and after
spending hundreds of pounds in
experimenting with steam tractors
Mr. Cossart has returned to the
original method of carting by means
of bullock teams. White Swamp
mill is owned by the firm, the man-
agement being in the hands of Mr.
S. J. Cossart, while at Dugandan
Mr. C. E. Cossart holds principal
sway, the senior partner now resign-
ing much of the responsibility to the
capable hands of his sons. The
veteran timber merchant is very
highly respected in the district, not
alone for the important part he has
played in its development and for his
unquestioned business ability, but
also for the straightforward methods
which characterize his dealing at all
times. Though deprived in his boy-
hood of the educational advantages
which are enjoyed by every child of
to-day, he has always been a great
lover of books, with the result that
he is a standing example of the
truth of the old saying, “Reading

century to settle and populate the

sturdy German settlers who made
such a big success of the agricultural
industry. The late Mr. Wissemann
was brought up to the trade of
cabinet-making, and he was greatly
surprised when making his first
acquaintance with the conditions of
the new country wherein he had
cast his lot to find that this craft
would be of small avail to him in
the making of a livelihood. At the
period of his advent —August, 1862
—slab “humpies” were the order of
the day on the settlers’ selections,
and these could be put up with
very little trouble by the veriest
novice at rough carpentry. With a
quiet philosophy he accepted the
situation, and applied himself to the
work of grubbing out stumps on a
farm in close proximity to Brisbane.
Here he spent six months, during
which time he lived with the utmost
frugality, husbanding his meagre
capital with scrupulous care. Sub-
sequently shouldering his swag, he
walked to “Jondaryan” Station, over

date as Mr. Wissemann; and after
remaining for some six or seven years
upon the Walloon holding, eventu-
ally he sold out to take up
an agricultural block in the
Fassifern scrub at Teviotville.
A small company was formed by
Mr. Wissemann, his brother, and
two other pioneer settlers (the
Gesler brothers), all of whom selected
land in the district about the same
time, to work on co-operative prin-
ciples in the preparatory part of
their undertaking for the purpose of
getting the holdings cleared with the
greatest possible expedition. This
accomplished, further operations
were initiated, and proving successful

a worthy scion of the good old stock
from which he sprang. Following
closely the methods learned from his
father, who had tested and tried
the system he pursued with such
good results, the young farmer went
to work upon his own holding with
a will, and his ability soon was so
successfully demonstrated that he
rapidly rose to a prominent position
among the settlers of the district.
The farm originally comprised about
300 acres, and adjoined the area
surveyed for the future town. This
circumstance was turned to good

acknowledged the call across the
ocean to populate and develop the
huge, newly-discovered continent,
lying like an uncut jewel on the
breast of the southern seas. Embark-
ing for Queensland, they arrived at
the Moreton Bay Settlement, as
Mathewson & Co., Brisbane.
MR. WILLIAM CHARLES STENZEL.
Brisbane was then known, half a
century ago, and subsequently gave
the most vigorous years of their
lives to building up a home for suc-
ceeding generations on soil which
ultimately as that of the country of
their choice became dear to them as
their native Fatherland. The new
colonists were well satisfied with the
conditions under which their venture
began, conditions which, guaranteed
to them that security which every-
where and at all times has been
assured to those who avail them-
selves of the protection of the British
flag, and in return they contributed
their full share of strenuous toil and
general development work, by which
alone any country can win her way
to greatness among the nations. At
the time of arrival there was little
choice of occupation for intending
settlers, and their inability to speak
the English language handicapped
them to no small extent. However,
for willing hands employment can
generally be found, and the new-
comers were soon at work on the con-
struction of the Toowoomba line of
railway, pick and shovel becoming
familiar implements in their hands,
whilst discomforts and hardships
of many kinds soon made themselves
equally well known. Sturdily, and
without complaint or impatience, the
father of the late Ferdinand Stenzel
and a friend who had accompanied
him from Germany worked together
on the railway, while the 13-year-old
Ferdinand and his elder brother,
August, had perforce to turn their
hand likewise to anything that
offered, which was mostly work
incidental to bush life, the handling
of bullock teams, and occupations of
a similar character. Inured thus
from an early age to “hard graft,”
and realizing that his future
depended to a large extent upon his
own exertions and the spirit in which
he accepted a lot very different from
that of his kindred and generation
in the Old Country, the late Ferdi-
nand Stenzel put his shoulder to the
wheel with the determination to
make a success of his life. He culti-
vated habits of thrift with those of
industry, and eventually finding that
he had saved enough to make a start
on his own account on a modest
scale, took up his block of land
under the prevailing conditions for
homestead holdings, and promptly
proceeded upon its development.
“Minto Crag,” which derives its
name from the crag or jutting out-
crop forming a spur of the moun-
tains which divide the State of
Queensland from that of New South
Wales, originally comprised only 160
acres, but additional areas were pur-
chased by Mr. Stenzel from time to
time, until at his death in 1904 he
was proprietor of a snug little estate
of some 800 acres. The property is
situated about four miles in a
southerly direction from Mount

these high ranges, gives it especial
advantages as dairying country. Big
timber abounds, ironbark and gum

and the rich river flats give splendid
x-esults when brought under cultiva-
tion. For general mixed-farming
operations “Minto Crag” could
hardly be surpassed, bub it is as a
dairying proposition that it has come
specially into prominence in the
district, and although maize is
grown in quantities sufficient for the
market, the land is cultivated
chiefly to provide fodder for the
herd. The original homestead which
the late Ferdinand Stenzel erected
for his bride in 1881, is still stand-
ing, and a portion of a later dwell-
ing also survives. Both of these
more primitive structures have been
superseded by the present residence,
which has its site on the banks of

away from the stream, on a pictur-
esque spot, where to the beauty of
the immediate vicinity is added the

The late Mr. Stenzel married in

another of the worthy old pioneers
who for half a century nobly bore
the heat and burden of the day to
raise the banner of successful settle-
ment in the country districts of an
adopted country. Mr. Gesler will
long be remembered as a man of
honour and integrity, one whose
knowledge of local farming condi-
tions proved useful to many besides
himself, who was ever ready to lend
a helping hand where such was
needed, and who made the sacred
cause of charity his own. Of the
union sprang a family of four sons
and four daughters, all of whom
were born at the old homestead, and
received their education at the local
public school. At the close of their
studies each son in turn took up his
share of duties on the home farm,
and under their father's guidance
received a thorough, initiation into
all branches of the industry carried
out thereon. Since the decease of

epoch-marking period of 1859, which
witnessed the separation of Queens-
land from the Mother State of New
South Wales. Mr. Behrendorff was
still in his teens when he first set
foot on Australian soil, and after
landing at Moreton Bay found
abundant scope for his energies in
the busy developmental work which
was proceeding in the partly opened
up districts of the young colony. A
great deal of roughly-prepared tim-
ber was needed for the building of
bridges over the various waterways
which had to be spanned in order
to complete the business of road-
construction in various directions,
and the youthful pioneer, strong
in physique and eager for experience,
found plenty to occupy both his
hands and brain under the new
conditions in which he found him-
self. During his residence in the
land of his fathers he served an
apprenticeship to the bootmaking
trade, and subsequent to arrival in
the new settlement across the south-
ern seas, he still plied the cobbler’s
needle, and proved himself a valuable
member of the pioneering com-
munity of which he formed a unit.
After a decade, during which he

unskilled labour incidental to the
building up of the present great
State of a great Commonwealth, the
late Mr. Behrendorff married Miss
Schoppe, who came with her parents
from Southern Germany by the
vessel “Humboldt” in 1870. It is
worthy of note that Miss Schoppe’s
father, Frederick Schoppe, who was
born in Germany in 1812, fought on
the side of Hanover in the struggle
for supremacy which took place
among the German States early in
this century, and was well advanced
in years when he emigrated to
Queensland with his wife and
daughter. After his marriage Mr.
Behrendorff left behind him the free,
Bohemian life he had led since his
advent to the colony, and settled
down to the cultivation of tobacco
and cotton at Peak Mountain, where
he leased a small farm for a time.
Afterwards he purchased a larger
property at Normanby Gully, and
continued in the above-mentioned
industries until the year 1880, when
he disposed of the holding. He then
took up his residence on a block of
land at Lower Coochin, about two
miles from the present township of
Boonah, which he had selected some
four years previously, and where his
wife’s parents had been living. He
farmed this land for a few years,
and at a later period became well
known in the butchering and baking

where at an early age he began to
assist his father in the butchering

having served his indentures worked
for a time as assistant in the business
where he had learned his trade.
Upon attaining his majority he
returned to the paternal roof-tree,
where he soon dropped naturally
into the old groove, and remained
with his father until his marriage,
which took place about two years
later. Settling down on a farm
which he had purchased at French
Creek some little time previously, he
commenced mixed-farming opera-
tions, giving special attention to
dairying, and by dint of hard work
and unremitting industry succeeded
in building up a sound and pros-
perous business. After continuing
with considerable success for 15
years, Mr. Behrendorff embraced an
opportunity to launch out in a new
direction, and chiefly with the object
of starting in the timber industry
took advantage of an offer to buy
the newly-opened timber mill at
Mount Alford, which had only been
founded for a few months previously.

connection with the conduct of the
mill and his other private enterprises,
Mr. Behrendorff has not seen his way
clear to accept the responsibility of
public office, which occupation would
make great inroads on his scant
leisure. Nevei’theless, he has always
been distinguished for the keen and
intelligent attention he has given to
the affairs of the districts in which
he has resided, and since coming to
Mount Alford has never proved him-

the community demanded his co-

of cricket is the particular recrea-

enthusiasm, and he still occasionally
wields the willow on local pitches

Behrendorff was married in 1894 to
Emilie Maria, daughter of the late
Carl Frederick Wilhelm Stumer, who
was a passenger to Queensland by
the same vessel as Mr. and Mrs.
Schoppe, grandparents of the sub-
ject of this article. Mrs. Behren-
dorff, who was born near Towns-
hend (late Marburg), where her
parents were residing at the time
of her birth, has been of the
greatest possible assistance to her
husband in his various enterprises,
and to her may be accorded the full
meed of credit so nobly earned by
many of Australia’s pioneer wives,
who spared no sacrifice of personal
comfort and ease in order to secure
the best possible conditions of life
for their husbands and children. Mr.

CARL BEHRENDORFF, owner
of the “Inavale” Stud Farm, Bun-
jurgen, via Boonah, was born at
Normanby, near Harrisville, in the
Fassifern district, Queensland, on
May 2, 1876. His father, the late
Wilhelm Behrendorff, one of the
middle-century pioneers hailing from
Germany, became a cultivator of
tobacco and cotton at Peak Moun-
tain, and subsequently at Normanby
Gully, where he resided until the


year 1880, when he removed to
another holding at Lower Coochin,
which he had acquired about four
years before, and which had been
occupied by the late Mr. and Mrs.
Frederick Schoppe, his wife’s parents.
At a later period Wilhelm Behren-
dorff, who was brought up as a
bootmaker in the Old Country, had
turned his hand to bush work after
arrival in Queensland, and had met
with fair success as an agriculturist
and farmer, launched out in yet
another direction, and established
the earliest bakery and butchering
business in the Fassifern district,
where he continued until his demise
at the age of 61, in 1903. The sub-
ject of this notice, Mr. Carl Behren-
dorff, attended the local State school
at Boonah, where he completed his
education before entering his teens,

though, following the excellent
example set by his elder brother
(whose biography precedes this
article), he still continued to enlarge
his fund of book knowledge by dint
of private study as he came to man-
hood’s estate. At a very early age
he was out in the fields on his
father’s farm, assisting in all the
operations incidental to the industry
there carried on, and when set free
from school routine, gave the whole
of his time to this work until the
attainment of his sixteenth year,
when he turned his attention to the
carpentering and joinery trade, in
which his brother above referred
to previously served his appren-
ticeship. Having qualified himself
in this department of industrial
work, he became associated with his
brother in farming and carpentry
work until, reaching the age of 25,
he started on his own account as a
building contractor. Various build-
ings both of a public and private
character, including a State school
and a church in the Fassifern dis-
trict, testify to Mr. Behrendorff’s
activities in this line of trade; but
his ultimate aim being in the direc-
tion of land settlement, other things
were made subservient to this end,

breed has been introduced with the

Mr. Behrendorff to achieve for Aus-
tralia what others likeminded with
himself have accomplished in other
countries. There is no more genuine
worker towards this end in the
State than the gentleman under
review, who deserves the heartiest
gratitude of the dairy-farmers for
the earnest concentration which he
has brought to bear upon the matter
so near to his heart. It may
here be mentioned that the world’s
champion dairy cow, by name “Fin-
derne Pride Johanna Rue,” is a
Holstein-Friesian, and gained her
honours recently by topping the list
for a year’s butter, and beating all

which was produced by scientific

American breeding, has milked
28,403 lbs. of 4T4 per cent, butter-
fat, or over 12 tons of milk, during
one year. It is therefore readily
to be understood that breeders in
Queensland, who are striving to
emulate their oversea brothers by
producing cows of great milking
qualities, are without doubt among
the primary benefactors of the
State. The “Inavale” stud was
established in 1911, Mr. Behrendorff
in that year purchasing the bull
“Denmark” and three pure-bred
heifers, viz., “Choice,” “Duchess,”
and “Maid of Honour,” and from
this beginning he has developed a
herd which has already become
famous, not only in the limelight
afforded by the showring, but in the
more practical domain of the milk-
ing-sheds on many of the most pro-
gressive dairy farms of Queensland.
The bull “Denmark,” which was
bred by the Queensland Department
of Agriculture, is one of the pioneer
bulls of this breed in the State, and
is generally admitted to be the lead-
ing animal of quality in Queensland,

and times without number he
has carried off the premier awards
at the most important agricultural
shows. At the National Shows,
Brisbane, in 1914 and 1915, he was
classified as champion, though meet-
ing in competition an ex-champion
of the Sydney Royal Show, and a
bull imported from England by the
Queensland Department of Agricul-
ture. The 1915 award included first
prize for bull three years or over,
and champion Holstein bull, and
“Denmark” also secured a notable
success against keen competition for
“bull and progeny,” three of his
heifers being included with him in
this entry. The cow, “Nolly IV. of
Numba,” bred by Mr. James Pritch-
ard, of “Numba,” New South
Wales, was purchased by Mr.
Behrendorff from Mr. G. Newman,
of Wyreema, in 1909, and is one of
those more recently introduced with
the object of still further improving
the herd. The heifer, “Flower of
Brundee,” was bred by Mr. A. C.
Lamond, of New South Wales;

breed is the bull calf, “Bosco of
Inavale,” which at birth turned the
scale at the extraordinary figure of
102 lbs. This animal is by “Oliver
of St. Athan,” out of “Norma of
Numba,” the pedigrees of these
recognized pure-bred parents being
too well known to need lengthy
description, though readers may be
reminded that the granddam of
“Oliver of St. Athan,” viz., “Olive
of Numba,” holds the Holstein
milk record for Queensland. These
representatives of the “Inavale”
Stud Herd are only a few of the
splendid types to be seen by visiting
the property, and a jioint much
emphasized by Mr. Behrendorff in
discussing his enterprise, of which he
makes truly a labour of love, is that
the object he has in view is to breed
for production and quality as well
as for type and conformation. The
“Inavale” Stud Farm, situated a
mile from the village of Mount
Alford, and about six miles from
Boonah, is a property of some 250
acres, comprising both mixed alluvial
flats and scrubby hill country,
making it well suited to grazing
purposes. It is watered by springs
and bores, a plentiful supply of good
water being struck at depths verying
from 20 to 100 feet. Cultivation is
resorted to for providing suitable
fodder for the stock, about 50 acres
being put under the plough annu-
ally. The progressive spirit at the
head of affairs is everywhere mani-
fest, and a very casual inspection of
the up-to-date outbuildings and
modern machinery impresses the
observer with the fact that the
reputation attained by the farm as
one of the leading propositions of its
kind in Southern Queensland is
based on a very sound foundation.
A feature unique in its construc-
tion is the silo, which is built
of machine-made concrete bricks,
manufactured by Mr. Behrendorff
on the farm. Though expensive
in the initial instance, it has
proved its superiority over other
works of a similar character built
with less durable materials, and being
completely efficient in the long run
has been found cheaper then erec-
tions less costly at the beginning.
Mr. Behrendorff among his many and
varied qualifications for the title of
a breeder of thoroughly advanced
methods may add that of having
attained perfection in the art of
ensilage-making, a not unimportant
department of his enterprise. He is
chairman (1918) of the local branch
of the Queensland Farmers’ Union,
of which he was a foundation mem-
her, and for several years served as
a committeeman of the Fassifern
Agricultural and Pastoral Associa-
tion. He is a member of the council
of the local school of arts, and ever
since his advent to the district, has
occupied a seat on the public school
committee. Mr. Behrendorff married
in 1904 Rosa Allmer, daughter of
the late Carl Frederick Wilhelm
Stumer, referred to in the preceding
article, and has three sons and two
daughters.


MICHAEL MYLES CAVEN-
AGH, J.P., “Mount Alford” Farm,
Mount Alford, via Boonah, is a
native of New South Wales, having
been born on May 26, 1861, at Dun-
more, on the Hunter River, at which
date his father, the late James
Cavenagh, owned a farm on the
historic “Goulburn Grove” Estate.
The late gentleman, who was one of
the pioneer's of Mount Alford, was
MR. JAMES CAVENAGH.
born near Enniskillen, Ireland,
where his grandparents and parents
followed farming pursuits. In com-
pany with a younger brother and
sister he sailed from Plymouth in
May, 1841, by the ship “John Ren-
wick,” and arrived at Port Jackson
in October of the same year. Taking
up land at West Maitland for farm-
ing purposes, he married and con-
tinued there for a number of years,
but in 1874 was attracted by the
liberal land laws of Queensland, and
removed with his family to the
northern State. Settling at Mount
Alford, he pioneered agricultural
enterprise in this district, being the
first to take a load of farm produce
from the Mount Alford side of the
Dugandan scrub to Ipswich, then the
nearest market, 40 miles distant.
In course of time he relinquished the
farm to his sons, but continued to
reside on the property, and being
invalided was kept in touch with
outside affairs by his sons and
daughters, who were settled near
him. Upon the occasion of his
demise he had been left alone for a
short time, when the house caught
fire, and he was burned to death—
an occurrence which caused great
grief and consternation among his
large circle of friends and relatives.
The late James Cavenagh, who
belonged to the Roman Catholic
Church, was a man of strong
religious principles, and his house
was the first in the district that Mass
was celebrated in, Father Scortechini
being the celebrant, tie left a
family of six sons and one daughter,
of whom the gentleman under review
is the youngest. Mr. Michael Myles
Cavenagh was educated at the
Roman Catholic School at Morpeth,
also studying under the guidance of
his only sister, who prior to joining
the family in Queensland was a
student at the Maitland Convent,
New South Wales. After complet-
ing his education, he took up duties
on the home farm, and in course of
time assumed control of operations,
which he still continues. “Mount
Alford” Farm takes its name from
the mountain in the shadow of which
it is situated, and retains the same
area as when it was first taken up
from the resumed portion of
“Coochin” Station. The late Mr.
Cavenagh was preceded in the dis-
trict by one settler only, and the
mixed-farming proposition that he
then inaugurated has been carried
on very successfully by his successor.
The position is admirable for this
purpose, from the fact that the
deposits of soil washed down from
the surrounding mountain heights
during the progress of centuries have
greatly enriched the soil, making it
highly suitable both for agriculture
and for grazing purposes. The

early native-born settlers of Queens-
land, his birthplace being Ipswich,
where he first saw the light in 1847,
12 years before the separation of the
north-eastern portion of the con-
tinent from the mother colony of
New South Wales. He was a son of
the late William Turner Beverley,

descendant of a very ancient family
of the name in Yorkshire, who cam©
to New South Wales in the late
thirties, thus founding his name on
new soil, and establishing its claim
to extend back to the beginnings of
civilization in the new territory
acquired by Britain in the eighteenth
century. Subsequently the last-
named gentleman settled in the
Moreton Bay district, and his son
above referred to was brought up to
the trade of a carpenter and joiner
at Ipswich, becoming a prominent
figure in the early days of the town
of his nativity. The late William
George Beverley died at a compara-
tively early age in the year 1885,
leaving a widow and family of two
daughters and three sons. The two
elder sons reside with their mother
at the old homestead taken up by
their father a few years before his
demise, where Mrs. Beverley, as a
young wife, first faced the difficulties
incident to the lot of the pioneer
settlers in Queensland. “Bunjur-
gen” Farm is situated six miles from
Boonah, and about two miles from
Mount Alford, and consists of some
400 acres of undulating and flat
country, including some good scrub
ridges and useful agricultural areas,
making the place well suited to the
various departments of mixed farm-
ing and timber-getting operations
engaged in by Messrs. Beverley
Brothers, by whom the property
recently was taken over from their
mother, since which date they have
worked it on their own behalf. Mr.
William Turner Beverley was born
at Ipswich in 1873, and after attend-
ing a local school, finished his educa-
tion at the Normal School, Brisbane.
He was brought up to farming pur-
suits, and during the whole of his
life has been identified with the
district where he still resides. Mr.
Beverley takes a deep interest in
public affairs, and is honorary sec-
retary and a shareholder of the
Bunjurgen Co-operative Cattle Dip
Company; a member of the local
council of the Farmers’ Union; and
district representative on the council
of the Fassifern Agricultural and
Pastoral Association. Every pro-
gressive movement set afoot in the
district commands his cordial sup-
port, and since the special call for
patriotic service at home as well as
abroad has arisen, he has been well
to the forefront in organized efforts
towards this important end. All
clean forms of sport also make an
accepted claim upon his sympathy
and support, and he is a member of
the Boonah Rifle Club. Mr. George
Norman Beverley was born in the
year 1880, and upon the completion
of his education, received at a
local school, he became associated
with the home farm, where he
has continued ever since. He takes

JAMES McGUIRE, "Clonmel,”
Tarome, Fassifern line, was born at
Brisbane, Queensland, in the year
1880, and is the fifth son of the late
Thomas McGuire, who lived a
strenuous life, spent mainly in the
furthering of the development of the
new colony, the interests of which
he had made his own. The name of
the late Mr. McGuire in his day was
widely known, and still lives in the
memory of those surviving him with
whom he was associated in various
spheres of labour. He was a native
of King’s County, Ireland, and
before coming to Queensland served
his apprenticeship to the plastering
trade. Possessed of an independent
and adventurous spirit, he rebelled
against what he considered the
oppressive laws of his country, and
in course of time these became such
a burden to him that he resolved
to seek a region where liberty and
freedom were the watchwords of the
hour. Convinced that this realm of
his hopes was to be found in the
newly-established colony of Queens-
land, in 1863 he set sail by the well-
known sailing vessel "Fiery Star,”
arriving at Moreton Bay a few
months later. Shortly afterwards he
became associated with the late Mr.
Campbell, of Brisbane, for whom he
worked as a builder, and at a later
the Gympie field prevailed in tempt-
ing him to abandon an excellent
and well-remunerated position for
the precarious life of a prospector,

with which he combined work
as a builder in the rapidly
rising mining town. Eventually he
was fortunate in pegging out a
claim which yielded handsome results,
and by this means he was enabled
up his interests at Gympie, Jie
returned to Brisbane, where he pur-
chased the freehold of the Queens-
land Hotel, in Edward Street,
which he carried on for some time
as licencee. Being of a sanguine
disposition, and thoroughly con-
vinced of the future importance of
the infant capital, he decided to
apply his energy and capital to
further building operations, and
accordingly erected the well-known
Newmarket Hotel in George Street,
which proved a great success
from the very commencement. Fol-
lowing this came the erection of the
Royal Hotel at the corner of
Elizabeth and Albert Streets, the
conduct of which is still in the
hands of his widow and other sur-
viving members of his family. In
public matters the late Mr. McGuire
was somewhat retiring, although
given every inducement to enter
public life by the political parties of
his time, and the only prominent
office he could be brought to accept
was that of Justice of the Peace,
which he filled for a number of
years. A lifelong friendship existed
between him and the late Sir
Horace Tozer, which was based upon
a close association in the early days
at Gympie, where both were working
as miners. Mr. McGuire died in

James, the subject of the present
memoir, was educated exclusively at
the Christian Brothers’ School, on
Gregory Terrace, Brisbane, which
institution he left at 17 years of
age. He then became con-
nected with his father’s
hotel-keeping business, and
lived an active life in the
city of Brisbane until
1909, when he decided to
settle on the land. About
that time a portion of
the extensive “Weinholt”
Estate had been subdivided
into smaller areas and
placed on the market, and
Mr. McGuire embraced the
opportunity to purchase
a holding of 900 acres,
to the development of
which he has since de-
voted the whole of his
time and attention. Shel-
tered by a high range of
mountains at an elevation
of 2,000 feet above sea
level, the “Clonmel” pro-
perty stands out unique in its
freedom from the severity of
drought conditions. Its situation
lies about four and a half miles
from Cunningham Gap, and it is
overlooked by the well-known peak
known as Mount Mistake and the
sugarloaf height of Mount Gravel.
The holding consists of rich flats,
divided by symmetrical round hills

FREDERICK RICHTER,
Teviotville, Fassifern, well known
throughout Queensland as the inven-
tor of a corn-shelling machine which
has made its way rapidly into favour
among the members of the farming
community of this State, is a native
of the place where he now resides,
MR. FREDERICK RICHTER.
having been born at Teviotville in
the year 1872. He is the eldest son
of the late Jacob Richter, who came
to Queensland in the middle sixties,
and about 10 years later commenced
the work of a pioneer in the Fassi-
fern district. Taking up an area
of about 80 acres of unimproved
scrub land, by industry and perse-
verance he carved a home for himself
and his family out of the heart of
the virgin bush, and continued to
reside in this locality until his
death in 1898, at the comparatively
early age of 57 years. The subject
of this memoir, Mr. Frederich
Richter, after the completion of his
education, served his apprenticeship
to the carpenter’s trade, in which
calling he spent some 15 years.
About the end of this period he pur-
chased the farm upon which his
present homestead stands, the home
lieing situated upon a hill adjacent
to the Teviotville railway station,
and commanding one of the finest
views in the district, whilst in its
turn the handsome villa residence
forms one of the landmarks in a
radius of many miles. The holding
comprises 100 acres of the rich red
soil for which the neighbourhood is
distinguished, and is used by Mr.
Richter for the cultivation of maize
and for dairying purposes, these
being the principal industries of the
farm, whilst in addition he owns a
well-established workshop and fac-
tory, a large number of hands being
employed in the manufacture of the
popular machine, now widely known
as the “Champion Maize ILusker,
Sheller, and Bagger,” of which Mr.
Richter is the inventor, and the
output of which has now reached an
average of 100 machines per annum.
Mr. Richter’s practical
knowledge of farming,
combined with his
mechanical training,
enabled him to per-
fect his idea of a
machine which should
allow of the corn cobs
being fed into it in a
variety of ways, in
which respect alone
it is a vast improve-
ment upon the old-
fashioned type, which
would only receive
one cob by one par-
ticular method of
feeding. For a num-
ber of years Mr.
Richter’s machine has been exhibited
at the Brisbane National Exhibition
and at various country shows, and has
received many certificates of merit.
The gentleman under review, while
taking a keen interest in the welfare
of the district, has never been
covetous of public office, and has not
figured prominently on shir© council
boards or in the membership of
similar organizations, preferring
rather to devote his time and
energies in unostentatious manner to
the furtherance of religious interests
and the great patriotic cause. An
active church worker, and keenly
interested in the spiritual welfare of
the people of Queensland, he is a
deacon of the Lutheran Church,
Teviotville, a branch of the Queens-
land district of the Evangelical
Lutheran Synod in- Australia, which
forms a part of a great body
of Lutherans, largely represented
both here and in America, and who
claim to teach the pure doctrine set
forth by Luther, which differs widely
from that disseminated by the State
Church of Germany. These Luther-
ans, in consequence of persecutions
on account of their faith, fled from

their native haunts, some of its
members taking refuge in America,
and others seeking various portions
of the British overseas dominions,
where they might find "freedom to
worship God” according to the dic-
tates of their conscience, none daring
to make them afraid. The adherents
of this denomination are thus dis-
tinguished for their loyalty to the
land of their adoption, which has
afforded them a safe shelter in their
time of need. Mr. Richter has
effectually proved this loyalty by his
activity in all patriotic movements,

HERMANN STENZEL, “Mil-
bong” Farm, Milbong, is a native
of Queensland, having been born at
Bigges Camp (now known as Grand-
chester), on March 17, 1866. He is
a son of the late Carl Stenzel, one
of a band of German settlers who
came from the Fatherland to Aus-
tralia in 1864 to work out their
destinies in the land of the Southern
Cross, and whose names are num-
bered now among those of the early
pioneers to whom fell the task of
opening up the country districts and
beginning the development of their
industry by his young wife, who
nobly did her part in assisting
towards the establishment of a home
of their own. That this necessitated
the utmost care and management
will be readily gathered by the
statement that whilst engaged in
work on the railway line Mr. Stenzel
had only been in receipt of a wage
of 15s. per week, and that out of
this pittance the maintenance of a
wife and six children, in addition
to his own personal expenses had to
be met. Five of these children were
natives of Germany, and one was
developing his land for cultiva-
tion and other purposes. Cotton-
growing at that time was the
popular industry, on account of the
bonus granted by the Government
newly come into power, and accord-
ingly Mr. Stenzel applied himself to
this industry as soon as he had
cleared sufficient land to start a
small plantation. At first a bare
subsistence was all that rewarded his
efforts, but within an incredibly
short time his amazing industry
produced results equally astonishing,
and as time passed on a substantial

boundless resources. The late Carl
Stenzel promptly found employment
on the construction of the earth-
works in connection with the exten-
sion of the main line of railway
from Ipswich westwards, and by
continuing at this work for two
years, during which period he
exercised a studied economy, he was
able to save enough capital to invest
in a land-holding on his own account.
He was already a married man, and
was fortunate in being aided and
abetted in his habits of thrift and
born at sea on the voyage out, while
subsequent to their arrival on Aus-
tralian soil the family was further
increased by the birth of Mr. Her-
mann Stenzel, and afterwards of
another daughter, making eight in
all. The block of land originally
acquired by the late Mr. Stenzel
was a farm-holding of 88 acres,
carved out of the forest country at
Peak Crossing, and with commend-
able pluck and perseverance he set
himself to the herculean task of
felling the big timber, and otherwise
success became the rule, so that,
although neither the thrift nor
industry of the family were dimin-
ished, all fears for the future
vanished, and judicious outlay could
be made for further profitable enter-
jmise. Mr. Stenzel continued to
work his farm until the time of his
death, which occurred in 1896, and
left to his family a worthy name and
heritage, untarnished by blot or
stain of any kind, his well-spent life
having given them an example of
honour and uprightness which must


be the pride of succeeding genera-
tions. All of his five sons have
taken up the calling of their father
on the land, and are continuing
successfully in his footsteps. The
subject of this review, Mr. Hermann
Stenzel, made the most of what
meagre facilities for education the
district of Peak Crossing afforded,
and in his more mature years sup-
plemented his store of learning by
private study and reading. It was
during his extreme youth that the
fight for existence on the part of
his parents was most severe, and at
a very early age he was taken from
course of time made such good
headway that he was able to pur-
chase his present homestead and
surrounding lands, amounting to
close on 1,000 acres, upon which he
started mixed-farming operations,
“Milbong” Farm may be said to be
one of those properties which have
been brought to a high state
of development by the scientific
methods employed in their adminis-
tration, and consequently it ranks
among the foremost of its kind in
the neighbourhood. Grazing and

Milbong district, the nearest point
of railway communication with

boy of tender years could do. He
remained under the paternal roof-

he essayed a start for himself, his

felling of pine timber for the mills,

the firm above mentioned. As his
prosperity advanced, however, Mr.
Stenzel turned his attention to the
matters connected with its advance-
ment, and although of a most
modest and retiring disposition has
never been found wanting in loyal
support of the organizations formed
for the betterment of local con-
ditions. He married in 1904
Elizabeth, daughter of Mr. W.
Windorff, a pioneer settler of the
same district, whose name and
fame alike are a worthy heritage
for his children and grandchild-
ren. This lady died before she
had reached her thirtieth year,
leaving a family of two sons and
two daughters.


BERTRAM MAXIMILIAN Le
GRAND, “Wooyumboong,” Mil-
bong, is a son of the late Robert
William Le Grand, whose father,
the late William Le Grand, was a
native of Germany, who emigrated
to France, and thence at a later
date to England, his family being
descended from the Huguenots.
Robert William Le Grand was born
in London in 1834, and at 17 years
of age came to Australia, landing at
Victoria, where he took part in the
first rush to the Bendigo goldfield
in the early fifties. He was fairly
successful in his mining venture, and
after some years returned to
England and established himself as
a contractor at Plaistowe, in the
County of Essex, subsequently
travelling in France and Germany,
renewing an early acquaintance
with the latter country, where he
had studied for a time during his
boyhood. He married in England,
Annie Caroline, daughter of the late
John Yerbury, of London, and
three sons were born prior to 1871,

Dane,” from which vessel he dis-
embarked at Moreton Bay. For a
short time the late Mr. Le Grand

to general farming operations with
the assistance of his sons, and in
this connection it is worthy of note

a later date these passed into the
hands of the well-known pastoralist,
the late Sir Joshua Peter Bell,
formerly President of the Legislative
Council of Queensland. Mr. Le
Grand became a notable figure
throughout the district, doing much
to advance its interests, and as a
member of the Goolman Divisional
Board and the earliest school com-
mittee played a useful part, while
he also worked hard, though without
success, to obtain railway facilities
for the neighbourhood. Having a
substantial knowledge of anatomy,
he found considerable scope for its
exercise, and applied himself dili-
gently to further study in this
direction in order to render* himself
yet more efficient to give medical aid
when required. The late Mr. Le
Grand continued the conduct of the
property until 1904, when he
retired from active life, the estate
being purchased by his son, Mr.
B. M. Le Grand. Mr. Le
Grand died in 1911, leaving seven
sons, viz., Mr. A. N. Le Grand,

railway line, was born at Normanby
Gully, about three miles from his
present homestead, on September 20,
MR. WILLIAM CASEY.
1869, and is the second son of the
late William Casey, who hailing
from County Limerick, Ireland, was
among the early emigrants to
arrive from the Emerald Isle.
Mr. W. Casey was born of a race
of agriculturists, by whom their
native soil had been tilled for cen-
turies, the name of Casey being one
of the most familiar in the above-
mentioned county as far back as
those strenuous times when educa-
tion was banned, the exercises of
religion regarded as a crime, and
the pride of race something which
prompted a rebuke from the early
English who ruled the Celtic race
without love. In these days of
shadow in the history of Ireland
were many who bore this name who
even offered their lives on the altar
of religion and honour; and in more
modern times in civil strife, as in
other differences in those remoter
times, the Casey family were always
credited with being able to defend
the cause they espoused, and to hold
their own most successfully. Sprung
from such a line, it was natural that
amid the unrest of the nineteenth
century, when migration from the
mother country became a common
thing among the inhabitants of the
United Kingdom, the late Mr.
Casey should feel those stirrings in
his blood which eventually led him
to cut himself adrift from the
associations of his youth and to
cross the seas where a new life under
widely varying conditions awaited
him. From the heart of the “Island
of Saints and Scholars,” where the
old traditional influences of race and
creed held sway, to the heart of the
virgin bush as yet unpeopled, and
almost untrodden by the foot of the
white man, was a far leap; but Mr.
Casey, like the other colonists of his
time, was ready to acknowledge that
the end in view, namely, that of
building up a home under genial
skies in a land of liberty, justified
all that Nature required to bring her
into subjection. The rough work,
the hard times, the unremitting
industry that was necessary, struggle
succeeding struggle in the attempt
to gain a footing, all these needed a
stout heart and a determined spirit
to win through; and all these the
young emigrant was prepared to
meet without being deterred from
his purpose. His first landing was
at Sydney, where he turned his hand
to whatever work offered for a time;
but gathering from different sources
that earlier prospects of advance-
ment were offering in the northern
areas, he came to Queensland while
yet the now prosperous independent
State was known as a remoter por-
tion of the mother colony of New
South Wales, under the name of
the Moreton Bay District. Upon
arrival he settled at Ipswich, and
engaged in contracting for street-
construction and road-building, in
the employ of the local governing
body. For some years he was
engaged in similar avocations at
Ipswich, varying his work in slack
times by proceeding to the western
bush country, where he gained his
first experience in the sheep and
wool industry, and other stock and
station pursuits. When the Queens-
land Government first decided to
award a bonus for the production of
cotton, Mr. Casey was one of the
earliest in this field of labour,
taking up the block of land at Nor-
manby Gully, whereon he made his
future home, and which he con-
tinued to work as a cotton-growing
proposition for over a decade. At
the end of this period he turned his
attention to agriculture in a wider
sense, relinquishing the cultivation
of cotton on his holding in the above-
mentioned locality to contend with
wilder scrub lands for the mastery
over their undeveloped resources.
Mr. Casey was one of the first to
convince himself of the possibilities
lying dormant in this ground, which
produced only the worthless native
growths, for the production of
cereals, root-crops, or good grass
pastures for stock, and baring his
arms, and straining nerve and sinew
to the utmost extent, he prepared
for the battle, which he was confi-
dent of bringing to a successful
issue. In this venture he was
blessed with the sympathy and
co-operation of an understanding
wife, whose help and encouragement
were big factors in the prosperous
outcome of the scheme, and with the
extra advantage of being able to
secure suitable hired labour, he
attacked with good courage the first
roods of land on his present pro-
perty at Milbong, where he resided
until his demise in the year 1901.
Big in physique, and equally so in
heart and mind, generous to a fault,
and of most genial disposition,
though implacable in matters of
justice, wherever he went he shed
the light of benevolence and kind-
ness on those with whom he was
brought into contact, and com-
manded a respect only second to
the affection which he uniformly
inspired. Of his family of five sons
and five daughters, Mr. D. J.
Casey, the second son, and another
brother, are the landowners of the
family; two are in the Civil Ser-
vice; and one, the Rev. Chas. F.
Casey, of Ipswich, is a member of
the Roman Catholic priesthood.
Two of the daughters are also

sons and one daughter.


The late PETER NELSON, who
owned and for many years resided
on the homestead property, “Water-
side,” Milbon, via Ipswich, was a
native of Denmark, having been
born at the town of Elsinore in the
year 1842. He was the descendant
of a long line of farming ancestors,
and having received the ordinary
education of a youth of his standing
at that period (which in later years
he improved by extensive reading),
after the custom of his country he
spent a short time under the pater-
nal roof-tree, assisting in the opera-
tions of his father’s farm. The
desire to travel, however, combined
with a love of adventure, which was
strong in the blood of the young
Northerner, prevailed to cause him
to forsake the land of his country-
men and to choose the sea for a
calling. In this way he landed even-
tually on the shores of the Aus-
tralian continent at a time when the
gold diggings in Victoria were boom-
ing, about the middle fifties, and
spent many months, and even years,
in the strenuous but romantic life
on the fields, where Dame Fortune
distributed her favours with an
arbitrary hand. Accepting the good,
bad, and indifferent phases of his
experience alike with philosophic
calm, Mr. Nelson fostered within
himself that spirit of endurance,
pluck, and perseverance which have
been distinguishing quali-
ties of most of the pioneers
of Australia, and have
given to the younger gene-
ration a heritage ot which
they may be justly proud.
About a decade after his
advent to Victoria Mr.
Nelson came to Queens-
land, and worked at the
coal-mining industry at
Redbank, where he con-
tinued for about two years.
By 1869 he had saved suf-
ficient to marry and settle
down, making Queensland
the home of his adoption.

name of his wife’s birth-
place in Scotland, he set
to work to develop the
land for farming purposes,
and at the same time
established the first storekeeping
business at Milbong. For 45 years
Mr. Nelson continue to reside on this
homestead, and during this lengthy
period became one of the best-known
years the store was kept open by Mr.
Nelson, who only relinquished opera-
tions when railway communication
between Boonah and Brisbane
opened up brighter prospects for the
dairying industry. Directing his
attention more exclusively to his
farm, he extended this department
of his industry, and became one of
the leaders of the enterprise for
which the district has since attained
a premier reputation. Mr. Nelson
was always prominent in all matters
affecting the advancement of the
community with which he had thrown
in his lot, and was a member of the
Co-operative Cattle Dip Company,
and for many years a committeeman
of the local State school. Sympa-
thetic and generous, he never closed
heart or hand when cases of neces-
sity were brought under his notice;
and in every way he proved his
worth as a useful citizen and enter-
prising settler. He married Janet,
daughter of the late William Meikle,
one of the most ancient of the Celtic
names of Scotland, who came with
his wife and family to Queensland
in 1861, and engaged in farming
pursuits at Goodna for about a
quarter of a century, his death
occurring in 1890. Of this union
resulted a family of five sons and
six daughters. Three sons are now
on the land on their own account,
one is in the Civil Service, and one

Kalbar.
Kalbar was known as Englesburg until after the
outbreak of the great war with the Central Powers.
The district had been settled to some degree by
emigrants from countries which declared war against
Great Britain, but for the most part these had become
good Australians, and loyal to the British flag, so that
when the reaction of feeling against all things Teutonic
manifested itself the desire to change the name of the
place to some title less German became unanimous.
Kalbar lies 54 miles from Brisbane in a line due
south of Ipswich. Railway connection was established
in 1916, the extension from Munbilla to Kalbar being
declared open on April 17 of that year. The district
originally was heavily timbered, and much of the sur-
rounding country is wild and rugged. Boonah is but
8 miles away, and the intervening country presents a
charming aspect of nicely improved farms, among which
picturesque homes nestle invitingly amidst clusters of
orchards and gardens, where the planted trees from
other lands mingle with the dense foliage of the
indigenous species. In the early days of pastoral settle-
ment huge herds of cattle roamed at will over the open
glades and along the spreading creek flats, where the
surrounding forests afforded shelter from the extremes
of climate and yielded wealth in the supplies of timber
they provided to the pioneer. At Munbilla the railway
from Ipswich branches into two routes, one continuing
in a south-easterly direction to Boonah for a distance
of 11 miles, and the other turning slightly to the west
to Kalbar, which is only 6 miles from the junction. A
continuation of 10 miles from the lastnamed place to
Mount Edwards is under course of construction at the
time of writing, whilst a further extension from the
latter centre to Maryvale, the terminus of a branch
line from Warwick, has been approved by Parliament,
and will complete the via recta route to Sydney, which
will cut some 50 miles off the length of the journey to
Warwick and the stations south of there.
Kalbar is a fine progressive town, well provided
with banks, numerous up-to-date business places, public
halls, and other public conveniences. The surrounding
country is intensely cultivated, being divided into
small holdings of fertile land, which is largely used for
dairying purposes. The district within a radius of 5
miles from the railway station contains a population of
approximately 2,181 persons. The town is situated on
a plateau from which a commanding view of the sur-
rounding country is obtained. The jianorama presented
is one of the most pleasing character, the dark green
of growing crops mingling harmoniously with the
brighter hues of natural vegetation, whilst the dark
lines of forested mountain ranges in all directions form
a rugged and picturesque horizon. Potatoes and other
root crops flourish in almost any season; whilst green
crops are extensively grown for the use of the dairy
herds. Both lucerne and maize cover large areas of
land, some 8,000 acres of the latter being spread
through the neighbouring holdings.
Harrisville.
Harrisville is due south of Ipswich, and is separated
by a distance of only 43 miles from Brisbane. The town
is on the railway which at Mqnbilla, 48 miles from the
metropolis, branches to Boonah and Kalbar. The line
from Ipswich to Harrisville was officially declared open
on July 10, 1887, whilst five years later the extension
to Boonah carried its first traffic.
The last census showed the population of Harrisville
township to number approximately 300; but the sub-
division of some large estates has led to subsequent
increase, both in the village and the surrounding coun-
try, and at the time of writing this is continuing at a
rapid rate. The industrial activities of the local farmers
are mainly turned to the dairying industry, a great
deal of the milk being sent away without being con-
verted into butter. The production of milk in 1914 was
2,772,971 gallons; whilst the total quantity of butter
manufactured locally in the same year was 82,874 lbs.
The district contains 334 dairying establishments and
ww2
a butter factory. During the year just quoted the
official figures for which are the latest obtainable, an
a gg re g a t© 13,378 acres was cultivated in the Harris-
ville district. Maize was grown on 4,114 acres, hay on
2,890 acres, and green fodder on 2,778 acres.
Proximity to the populous centres of Ipswich and
Brisbane yields special facilities to the farmers of
Harrisville in the disposal of by-products, and the list
of exports from the district is lengthy and varied.
M eekly pig sales provide a regular source of revenue to
the small landholders, whilst many different kinds of
produce are trucked away by rail throughout the year.
The rainfall is substantial and regular, whilst the low
altitude of only 175 feet above sea level results in an
atmosphere which stimulates the growth of most types
of crops, and affords protection from the sharper winter
cold, which brings frosts, and to some degree arrests
winter growth on the tableland to the west of the main
range.


EDWARD JOSEPH HAYES,
J.P., chairman of the Normanby
Shire Council (1915), was born
at Milbong, Fassifcrn district, on
December 23, 1870, and is a son of
Mr. Patrick Hayes, whose advent to
Queensland some 50 years ago was
the commencement of an active and
useful pioneering career in the last-
mentioned district, where he was
engaged in farming pursuits at
Milbong for a lengthy period, and
now at the ripe age of 75 is living
in retirement and in well-earned
enjoyment of the fruit of his
labours. The subject of our memoir
was educated at the Milbong public
school, and upon leaving his school-
days behind him at the age of 14,
began to assist his father on the
home farm. Two years of this life
sufficed to convince him that he

could do larger things with neces-
sary scope, and his first step out
was to attach himself to a butcher-
ing business in order to gain know-
ledge of that trade. In 1891 he took
a position as general hand on
the old “Normanby” Station, and
making the most of every oppor-
tunity to master the details of
each department, eventually was
appointed overseer. This post he
relinquished in 1898, and proceeding
to “Barcaldine Downs” Station in
Central Queensland, acted in the
capacity of horse overseer and
breaker-in for some 18 months.
Returning to the Harrisville district
he opened a butchering business at
Rosevale, and coincidently took up
a 640-acre block of grazing and farm
land in the same neighbourhood.
These interests he subsequently dis-
posed of, and purchased the general
store formerly conducted by Mr.
Angus McDonald, at Harrisville,
where he began business on Octo-
ber 1, 1902, and has continued ever
since. It is interesting to note that
this business was the pioneer com-
mercial venture started in the Fassi-
fern district outside of Ipswich, and
was originally owned by Messrs. J.
and G. Harris, while in the days
when the cotton-ginning mills were
working at Harrisville, the mills and
general store were both under the
management of the late Hon. John
Archibald. Conjointly with his
storekeeping interests, Mr. Hayes
has established an auctioneering
business, wielding the hammer him-
self with more than ordinary success,
and under his expert guidance many
thousands of acres of land have
changed hands since the cutting up
of the large estates for purposes of
closer settlement in this district,
Mr. Hayes’ expert knowledge of land
values stands him in good stead in
his conduct of these important sales,
and also enables him to make an
occasional bargain on his own
account, as instanced in the case of
the old “Normanby” Station sale,
when he purchased 103 acres for less
than half the price that he realized
only two years later. Mr. Hayes
retains some few hundred acres
for grazing and other purposes, and
takes considerable interest in the
breeding of blood horses. He is con-
sidered one of the most reliable
judges of horses and cattle in the
district, and his reputation as a
cattle man may be indicated by the

fact that he has treated and inocu-
lated many thousands of cattle for
red water, a disease only too preva-
lent in this district. For purposes
of bleeding for the inoculation Mr.
Hayes purchased five head of cattle
known as “bleeders” from the
Department of Agriculture and
Stock, these cattle, of course, being
guaranteed immune from the disease.
In addition to his other enterprises
Mr. Hayes in 1903 established a
butchering business at Harrisville,
which he carried on for five years,
selling out in 1908. In 1911 Mr.
Hayes became representative for No.
3 Division of the Normanby Shire
Council. Twelve months later he was
unanimously elected to the chair, and
filled this office for three years with
so much acceptance that at the end
of this period he was honoured by
receiving election unojDposed for a
further term. He was gazetted to

ried in 1898 a daughter of Mr. C.
Meiers, of Rosevale, and has six
sons and two daughters.


JAMES ALLAN CHAUVEL,
J.P., “Summerlands,” Harrisville,
was born at “Tabulam” Station,
Clarence River, New South Wales,
on September 28, 1868, and is a son
of the late Mr. C. H. E. Chauvel,
owner of “Tabulam,” “Wodenbong,”
and “Acacia Creek” Stations in the
Mother State, and of “South Can-
ning Downs” Station near Warwick,
Queensland. “Tabulam” originally
was owned by Mr. Chauvel’s grand-
father, who held a commission as
major in the 35 th Regiment of
Native Infantry in India, and com-
ing to Australia in 1845 settled at
Mudgee, New South Wales, subse-
quently acquiring pastoral interests
and founding a noted stud of short-
horn cattle, for which the last-
mentioned station is still famous.
The gentleman under review was

educated primarily at the Sydney
Grammar School, to which he
returned after an interval spent at a
similar institution at Toowoomba.
Relinquishing his scholastic studies,
he applied himself to the acquire-
ment of a knowledge of surveying,
and was engaged in this class of
work at Tenterfield for about four
years. At the end of that period he
became associated with his father in
the management of the station pro-
perties, eventually being entrusted
with full control of the “South
Canning Downs” Station, where he
continued until 1901. In that year,
leaving the Warwick district, he
came to Fassifern, and for a time
leased the “Summerlands” property,
which eventually he purchased, and
has since devoted himself to the
working of this valuable estate, a
portion of which he has let to tenants,
who conduct their holdings on the
share system, which has proved a
thoroughly satisfactory arrangement

way 220 acres have been brought
under cultivation of lucerne, maize,
and other crops, and considerable
attention is given to the dairy-
ing industry. The property is
richly grassed and well watered, the
Warril Creek threading its way
through the different paddocks. On
the fine pasture lands are grazed a
number of Ayrshire stud cattle,
exhibits of which have secured two
championships and several blue
ribbons at the principal Queensland
shows. Mr. Chauvel has proved him-

worker in the interests of the
Country Party, being chairman of
the local council in connection with
this organization, and representative
by election of the Fassifern district
to the central council held at Bris-
bane. There are few more earnest
workers in the endeavours of the
Farmers’ Union to establish direct
representation of their party in the
political arena, and Mr. Chauvel has
left no stone unturned to this end
in his enthusiastic espousal of this
cause. He represents No. 1 Divi-
sion in the Normanby Shire Council,
is a Justice of the Peace, a member
of the Boonah Show Committee, and
vice-president of the Harrisville
School of Arts. In earlier years he
took an active interest in military
matters, being a member from its
inception of the New South Wales
Light Horse, which movement was
inaugurated in that State by his late
father, Mr. C. 11. E. Chauvel, and
whilst in the Warwick district he
held a lieutenancy in the Queens-
land Mounted Infantry. Mr.
Chauvel married in 1893 a dauMiter

“DERRYLIN” FARM, Mutda-
pilly (post town, Harrisville). ‘Derry -
lin” Farm is situated some five miles,
as the crow flies, from Harrisville,
and is owned and worked by Messrs.
Edward William Midler and Thomas
Laurence Muller, sons of the late
Louis Laurence Muller, formerly a
well-known figure in the township
of Warwick, Queensland. The late
Mr. Muller was a native of Minssen,
Oldenburg, Germany, engaged in a
seafaring life, who at 21 years of
age left his ship at Melbourne, in
1857, and not having obtained his
discharge sought employment in the
country, where he was fortunate in
securing work on a farm. Being
determined to enlarge his knowledge
of the country he set out on foot,
arriving ultimately at Queensland,
having walked the whole distance of

1,600 miles. After reaching War-
wick he took a position as station
hand on the “Rosenthal” Sta-
tion, four years later turning
his attention to hotel-keeping,
taking a lease of the hostelry then
known as the Oddfellows’ Home
Hotel, which he continued to con-
duct until the time of his decease,
which occurred on May 18, 1886.
The business was carried on by his
widow for about 12 months,
subsequent to which the family
removed to Brisbane, and lived
privately for some time. Of Mrs.
Muller’s 13 children the two sons
above mentioned were both con-
nected with the Civil Service for a
considerable period. Upon the
decision being made to purchase
“Derrylin” Farm in December, 1911,
both brothers resigned from their
respective departments, and, accom-
panying the family to its new
place of abode, settled down to the
management of the property, of
which they have succeeded in making
a thoroughly thriving proposition.
Although only 237 acres in extent
the holding has been found well
suited to purposes of mixed farming,
and 200 sheep and 25 cows are
grazed on the pastures, in addition
to the 9 horses necessary for the
work of the farm. Maize and lucerne
are grown, and as a result of the
progressive methods employed the
32 acres under cultivation of the
last-named fodder have been made
to yield no less than nine crops of
lucerne in a single year, 32 cwt. to
the acre having been cut. This

PATRICK KENNEDY, proprie-
tor of the Commercial Hotel,
Harrisville, was born at Ipswich,
Queensland, on March 12, 1872, and
is a son of Mr. Daniel Kennedy, now
living in retirement, who in earlier
days was a member of commercial
circles in the last-mentioned town.
Mr. Patrick Kennedy attended a
local school for primary tuition,
subsequently completing his studies
at the Christian Brothers’ College,
Brisbane. Entering the clerical
office of the Education Department
of Queensland, he continued in this
connection for a period of 10 years,
terminating his services here in

Bushmen’s Contingent sent from this
State to aid the British in their
struggle against the Boers in South

Africa in 1900. Mr. Kennedy, who
acted in the capacity of orderly-room
sergeant, was present at and actively
engaged in the memorable struggle
at Rhenoster Kop, when 6,000 Aus-
tralians, assisted by Imperial troops,
the whole body under command of
General Paget, took part in one of
the most stubborn engagements of
the whole war, the casualties among
the British and Australians alone
totalling 280. He was also a par-
ticipator in engagements at Hainan's
Kraal, Rustenberg, and Pieters-
burg, and remained on service in all
for 15 months. Upon his return to
Queensland in 1901, after only two
day’s leave, he was acting as clerk
in the military pay office, where he
remained for three years. He then
transferred his services to the
Government Savings Bank, but 12
months later resigned from this
institution to take over the Royal
Exchange Hotel, at Fernvale,
which he carried on for nine years.
Upon leaving Fernvale Mr. Kennedy
came to Harrisville, and purchased
the freehold and goodwill of tire
Commercial Hotel, and has since
devoted himself to the conduct of
this house. The hotel is built
of wood, and is a fair repre-
sentative of the type of building
predominating in this neighbour-
hood. It possesses, however, a dis-
tinctive feature in the shape of a
detached cottage, containing eight
large bedrooms, and built on the
bungalow design, with a wide veran-
dah running all round, which forms
a pleasant retreat from the active
and busy scenes inseparable from the
more public portion of a popular
hotel. Mr. Kennedy as boniface is
kept fully employed, and it is only
fair to intimate that the house owes
much of the patronage which it so
widely commands to the high favour
in which “mine host” is held among
his clients. Apart from his commer-
cial and military repute he is well
known to be one of the best riflemen
in Australia, his record in this
direction being a distinguished one.
In 1910 he was selected to represent
Queensland at the Commonwealth
Interstate matches held at Mel-
bourne, when each State sent 10
contestants, the home team return-
ing with the laurels of the meeting.

In the years 1913-14, when the
question arose of selecting the

was one of those chosen to partici-

he registered a fine performance,
obtaining a high aggregate, but just
failing by a small margin to secure
the cdveted honour. He was
appointed to represent his State in
the Commonwealth matches which
had been arranged to take place in
Adelaide in 1914, but which were
abandoned at the outbreak of the

Beaudesert.
Ihe town of Beaudesert lies on the edge of a region
of great fertility. An abrupt change meets the gaze
of the visitor as he approaches the settlement from Bris-
bane. The train glides unexpectedly from roughly-
timbered, unpromising scrub lands. For some miles
back the poorer classes of trees have composed forests
of no particular value to the timber-getter, and the
character of the tangled vegetation has indicated a soil
of low agricultural productiveness. For twenty or thirty
miles the train will have rattled over hilly country,
obviously blessed with a copious rainfall, but, except for
odd patches and strips of flats lining watercourses, com-
posed of land of low fertility. The region is typical of
millions of acres of the inferior lands of coastal Queens-
land. Ultimately mixed farming may be applied suc-
cessfully to districts such as this, or any one of a hundred
industries depending for profit mainly on sufficiency of
water and a sub-tropical climate may some day revolu-
tionize the conditions of settlement on this territory,
but the permanent occupation in small blocks of such
regions has not yet passed the experimental stage.
The change is complete. You emerge upon a verit-
able Garden of Eden. Here is an immense area where
one day farm will join farm as far as the eye can reach,
where a thick population of thriving producers will
dwell in affluent contentment, and where the natural
advantages justify the application of almost every
modern device of scientific agriculture. Wide stretches
of fertile, treeless plains are interspersed with belts of
open, park-like timber, until the landscape loses itself
in the far blue lines of the girdling mountain ranges.
Perpetually flowing creeks and rivulets wind through
and through the valley, as though they had been placed
there deliberately to tempt the enterprise of some
pioneering irrigationist, holding an immense estate and
conducting operations on a huge scale. Deep alluvial
soil of volcanic origin, favoured with a 36-inch rainfall,
presents possibilities for intense culture by aid of arti-
ficial water storage and reticulation, not yet explored.
Natural pastures, rankly prolific yet sweet and health-
giving, offer to the dairy farmer an easy road to rapid
affluence, barred only by the need for more potential
settlers and more capital in the Commonwealth. This
great expanse of splendid territory is drained by the
Logan Eiver and its tributaries.
The copious rainfall, together with the favourable
chemical composition of Logan Valley soil, particularly
suit the requirements of such leguminous fodder plants
as lucerne. Water lies beneath the surface in most
parts of the district within the reach of the deep roots
of the last-mentioned crop. Some of the Beaudesert
land is said by local graziers to be capable of fattening
a bullock to the acre on natural pastures. This claim
may sound extravagant to be advanced on behalf of any
country, however rich its potentialities may be; but
to assert that no one knows the full extent of what
would be the riches of the Logan Valley under the
application of the best modern methods is but to draw
an obvious conclusion from plainly apparent facts.
Where farming enterprise here and there has become
established, patches of lucerne gleam among oceans of
grass like oases. Countless square miles of rich basaltic
soil, through which a plough might cut all day without
meeting stone, stump, or other obstruction, are still
under natural pastures as virgin as when, in the
twenties, Captain Logan began his exjieditions of
exploration in the Moreton Bay district. A stranger
from the southern States, to see the Valley of the
Logan and its tributaries, would begin inquiring for
the hidden disabilities of the district, so difficult would
be the comprehension of the sparse population, in con-
junction with the apparent productivity of the region.
The shire of Beaudesert was officially declared a
local authority on November 11, 1879. The area of the
shire is 761 square miles, and the population was
officially computed, on December 31, 1914, to be 2,765
persons. In addition, however, the town of Beaudesert,
which is a separate local authority, proclaimed on
November 22, 1912, contains a population of 1,700
people. The railway was opened in the year 1888.
Beaudesert is still the terminus of the line, but a
rich territory to the south is being developed. A
tramway service, which links up with the railway,
is controlled by the local authority, and has been
responsible for the opening up of a substantial and
growing timber trade. The gauge used is the same as
that of the State railways, and a heavy traffic in logs
yields a revenue capable of supporting transport facili-
ties which could not be maintained by the proceeds of
the purely agricultural and pastoral industries of the
district. The tramway runs almost due south to
Tabooba Junction, a distance of twelve miles. From

the last-mentioned centre two lines radiate, one con-
necting with Lamington and the other with Rath-
downey, each of these being ten miles in length.
For the first portion of its distance the route lies
through rich agricultural land of the same character as
in any further extension that the desired connec-
tion, so much desired locally, has not yet taken a place

that within the immediate neighbourhood of Beaudesert.
But towards its southern termini the two routes wind
through broken country densely covered with valuable
forests. On several occasions efforts have been made
locally to persuade successive Governments to take prac-
tical steps towards continuing one of the lines to the
border of New South Wales, which lies within less than
ten miles. Kyogle, about twenty miles on the other
side of the division between the States, forms a ter-
minus in the railway system of the neighbouring State,
so that only a short extension is needed to link up
Brisbane with Sydney by a route at least 150 miles
shorter than is that now in use. The practical obstacle
lying in the way of such a plan being carried into effect
established in the forests which it taps, and it also serves
to bring logs to a mill at Beaudesert. The latter, in
the earlier stages of its life —during the late eighties and
the nineties—subsisted from supplies of raw material
secured within its own neighbourhood; but as these
sources of supply have been exhausted the industry has
grown increasingly dependent on forests further south.
The southern ranges beyond Beaudesert contain
scenery of surpassing grandeur, and provide a storehouse
of wonders to the botanist and biologist. A large area
of country has been set aside in that region for a
national reserve, where the native flora and fauna may
flourish undisturbed by the despoiling hand of civi-
lization. The fertility of the soil, the bounteous

to be crossed. The tram lines have been pushed far
into this difficult country. The wealth of the timber
resources has tempted that enterprise; but so expensive
would be the engineering problems to be encountered

peculiarly favourable for the purpose, and the Nature-
lover in search of indigenous species will find this
region a veritable Garden of Eden and wonderhouse
of surprises.

butchering establishment of Mr. J.
P. dost, Queen Street, Brisbane.
Having obtained some insight into
the general conditions prevailing in
the country of his adoption, he took
a post involving similar duties with
the late lion. George Edmonston,
but before very long realized that
he had got sufficient grip of things
to make launching out on his own
account a safe venture. Accord-
ingly he opened a butchering busi-
ness at Waterford, which was the
first enterprise of its kind in the
then new settlement, and as this
prospered combined grazing pursuits
with his commercial interests, carry-
ing on successfully in both directions.
As soon as he felt the time was ripe
Mr. Dunn extended his butchering
operations to Beaudesert district,
where at that time no township
existed, the old station homestead
of “Beaudesert,” then occupied by
the late Ernest White, being the
only building on what is now the
site of the town. This was about
the middle sixties, and Mr. Dunn
set to work with good heart to build
up his fortunes, and though occa-
sional hard times and a strenuous
struggle awaited him, he perse-
vered, and had the satisfaction of
making good within a comparatively
short period. In course of time he
disposed of the butchering business,

DAVID DUNN, owner of the
well-known “Valley View” pastoral
property, situated at Beaudesert,
was born at Waterford, in the Logan
district, Queensland, over half a
century ago, and is the only surviv-
ing son of Mr. Jeremiah Dunn,
descendant of a long line of his
name, who made their home in
County Limerick, Ireland, whence
he emigrated to Queensland at 19
years of age. Mr. David Dunn grew
up in the Albert and Logan Valley
at a period when the country was
still mostly in its virgin state, and
the presence of close on 1,000 blacks
in the district made existence none
too safe. He received a scanty
education at a small school at
Beaudesert, and as quite a young
child began to assist his father in

the butchering business carried on
by the latter gentleman at that
centre, in this way obtaining a
practical knowledge of anatomy
which has proved very useful to him
in his subsequent career. At a later
date, when Mr. Jeremiah Dunn
became engaged in farming pursuits
on the property where he now
resides, his son continued to aid him
in the handling of the stock, and
brought to his work a keen, inquir-
ing mind and a very observant eye.
Not the smallest detail was over-
looked by the young man, who later
was destined to become a breeder of
champion cattle which should hold
their own against all comers in the
State, and from the first he dis-
played a remarkable aptitude for his
tasks on the farm, which made them
veritably a labour of love. He very
soon made himself his father’s right
hand, and assumed the care and
supervision of the stock as his own
special department, continuing con-
tentedly to work in association with
Mr. Dunn, sen., on the paternal
property until the late nineties,
when he struck out for himself as a
drover. In this capacity he became
well known over all the stock routes
of Queensland and the Mother State,

enabling him to handle the mobs
with the greatest care and judg-
ment. Mr. Dunn soon attracted the
attention of the big stockowners and
pastoral experts all over the station
areas, and experiencing no lack of
engagements pursued the calling of
a drover for many years. During
this period he faced manfully the
many hardships incidental to the

with real dangers of various kinds,

buoyed up by a spirit of optimism

on a block of virgin land at Allen’s
Creek, which he had taken up about
the year 1890, the holding being a
part of the old "Bromelton” Run,
and having an area of over 700


acres. After successfully setting in
train the different phases of work
necessary to the development of a
homestead block of this character,
Mr. Dunn awaited his opportunity
to make further acquisitions of
country, and a few years later
selected in the same locality a
mountainous grazing property, com-
prising nearly 1,500 acres; subse-
quently adding to his possessions by
the purchase of a small freehold
farm at Bromelton, and a Govern-
ment holding, which was only
divided by the public roadway from
his original homestead block. A
later purchase of 1,400 acres in the
same vicinity followed in 1908, and
meanwhile, in 1906, he had acquired
the farm of 800 acres upon which
the present family residence, erected
by Mr. Dunn in 1908, is situated,
which with another 100 acres adjoin-
ing his father’s farm brings the area
of land under his administration up
to nearly 5,000 acres, the whole of
which, with the exception of the
1,500-acre grazing block, is freehold
property. Mr. Dunn has one of the
most comfortable settlement home-
steads in the district—a well-built
vicinity artistically laid out flower-
beds, and the necessary vegetable
garden, which presents a flourishing

high on the list of honours in con-
nection with agricultural show
records, in the year 1912 first
reaching the summit of success with
the champion Illawarra cow, “Blos-
som III.” (by “Jamberoo” from
“Blossom II.” by “Royal Duke of
Maroon”), then seven years old,
which he had personally selected as
a two-year-old heifer from the herd
of Mr. John Hardcastle, of “Dugan-
dan.” The record established by
“Blossom” before first being decor-
ated with the blue ribbon was a
distinguished one. In 1906 she won
first prize at the National Show,
Brisbane, for Illawarra heifer under
15 months, in which class there were
15 entries, also first prize at Boonah
and Beaudesert. In 1909 she came
third among 16 entries in the Milk-
ing Competition, Brisbane, on which
occasion through an oversight on
Mr. Dunn’s part she was not entered
in the class three years and under
four years. In 1912 reserve cham-
pion honours were accorded her at
Beaudesert, when she was beaten by
“Ruby,” also exhibited by Mr.
Dunn; and at the National Show,
Brisbane, in the same year, she
carried all before her, taking first
prize for Illawarra cow, over four
years, in milk; first prize in Home
Milking Competition, 48 hours’ test
on farm, giving 4‘38 lbs. butter;

above record it will be seen that
while “Blossom” has never been
unplaced in all the shows in which
she has ever been exhibited, upon
this particular occasion she won
three champion ribbons in the Illa-
warra class, and one champion in the
butter fat test against all breeds;
and in the same year took the award
for largest quantity of butter fat in
a 48-hours’ test in the home milking
section. Similar triumphs awaited
the 1912 champion two years later,
when she again secured the blue
ribbon in the class cows four years
and over, in milk, and in the home
milking section, giving 109 lbs. of
milk for 48 hours. In 1915, although

the competition on account of the
drought was not so keen, “Blos-
som” was again well to the fore, and
was reported as looking as well as
the previous year, and in excellent
condition. “In spite of her 10 years,”
the writer added, “she looked as she
always does —a graceful old cow,
distinguished for most of the good
points which go towards the making
of a first-class dairy cow. She
calved on June 26, and was showing
a good bag. No one was surprised
when later in the morning she
secured the championship for the
third time in her career.” In the

lowing report was published :

On this occasion another of Mr.
Dunn’s prize Illawarras, “Jemima
II.”, was placed third in this sec-
tion, the report continuing.—
It is worthy of note that about five
weeks before the Brisbane Show of
1915 Mr. Dunn was unlucky in
having “Blossom III.” ill for 17
hours with milk fever, and only by


the more than average skill of her
owner and his expert knowledge of
scientific treatment was the life of
this very valuable animal saved,
and though naturally this untoward
circumstance was somewhat detri-
mental to her being exhibited, in
spite of all she came off with flying
colours as the champion cow of
Queensland in the Illawarra class.

—whose name is included in the
Herd Book of the Illawarra Cattle
Association of Queensland, vol. 6,
p. 57—in 1907 up to the present
time (September, 1915), a period of
eight years, she has made a profit
of near £4OO for her owner. In
1914, in conjunction with “Jemima
II.”, she won first prize for best pair
of Illawarra cows against all comers
in Queensland, and in the following
year made one of a first-prize trio of
bull and pair of cows, her splendid
record up to date standing at 4

deservedly regarded as one of the
successful breeders of the State, and
having worked his way up by steady
determination, linked with a true
enthusiasm for the work for which
he qualified at an early period in his
life, he fully merits every word of
commendation that may be spoken of
his efforts. He has had his full
share of ups and downs, and at times
harks back to the days when he was
engaged in the butchering business
at Beaudesert, and those early days
of stock-raising, when he recalls
having on occasion driven cattle
over 50 miles and sold them at as
low a figure as 6s. 6d. per cwt.,
delivered at the meat works. Like
most men of his calibre, he has
always taken a deep interest in the
affairs of the district in which his
interests lie, and has never been
wanting in the extension of cordial
support to all movements having as
their object the advancement of the
public well-being. As is natural,
the organization commanding his
warmest sympathy and co-operation
is the local agricultural society,
and for over 20 years he has
occupied a seat in the councils of
this body, taking a foremost place
by virtue of his wide experience and
influential position in the "neighbour-
hood. Mr. Dunn married in the
year 1911, Mary, daughter of the
late James Mylett, one of the
earliest pioneers of the Beaudesert
district, and has three sons.


CHARLES ALFRED BEET-
HAM, J.P., “Listow,” Beaudesert,
was born on the night of August 21,
1857, at that historic town in New
South Wales called Campbelltown,
MR. JOHN SHEPHERD BEETHAM.
after the well-known family of
Campbells, who imprinted their
individuality on the district. The
night of August 21, 1857, was one
of the most memorable in the his-
tory of the Mother State, as it was
the occasion on which the ill-fated
emigrant vessel, the “Dunbar,”
crashed into the ironstone cliffs at
the Gap, just outside and south of
Sydney Heads. A storm of unparal-
leled fury raged, and in the Cim-
merian blackness of the night the
captain of the “Dunbar” mistook the
Gap for the entrance to Port Jack-
son. Only one of those aboard, a
sailor named Johnston, survived to
tell the fearful tale. Mr. Beet-
ham comes of a very old and
well-known stock, his father, the
late John Shepherd Beetham, being
amongst those early settlers in
Queensland on whom fell the
arduous work of that pioneering,
the effectiveness of which is demon-
strated by the extraordinary devel-
opment which has marked the
history of this State. He arrived
in Adelaide in the early fifties,
in company with a band of
intrepid emigrants who left the “big
smoke” behind to seek their fortune
in the vastness of Australia. Within
the sound of Bow Bells he was born,
his father being a legal practitioner
in London, that father being the
inheritor of a practice that for
generations had been built up by the
Beetham family. Indeed, in the
ancient records of the law in Eng-
land the name of Beetham stands out
conspicuously, and it appears in
connection with many famous cases
fought out in English law courts.
With a sound education, Mr. John
Shepherd Beetham brought with him
to Australia mental parts and quali-
fications of no mean order, and
therefore he quickly fell on his feet
in the new land of his adoption. He
secured a responsible position as
bookkeeper on one of the largest
pastoral holdings in South Australia,
during the occupancy of which he
devoted his spare time to enriching
his educational stores and to
familiarizing himself with the main
MR. CHARLES ALFRED BEETHAM.
points in primary industries. After
some years in South Australia Mr.
Beetham went to New South Wales,
where he accepted the post of private
tutor to one of the oldest historic
families in the Mother State.
Through his hands passed boys who
afterwards in public life made their
mark, and left their name widely
honoured. His signal success and his
marked capacity brought him under
the notice of the New South Wales
Government, and he was offered the
position of headmaster of the first
public school established in Ipswich,
in those days a position of special
importance. During the years that
Mr. Beetham continued to hold the
post he trained many of those who
in after years rose to positions of
high eminence in professional and
commercial spheres in Brisbane.
Doubtless many of the older genera-
tion still retain vivid remembrances
of the “father” of education in
Ipswich. Mr. Beetham’s health,
however, failed under the strain,
and therefore he turned to commer-
cial pursuits in the hope of recuper-
ating. He started business in the
Valley, but not for long was he able
to continue, as his health again
broke down. He then decided to go
on the land, selecting an area at
Waterford, on the Logan, where his
health so improved that in addition
to overlooking the work on his farm
he took up the work of headmaster
at the Waterford Public School.
This went on until the early
seventies, when he was appointed to
a responsible position in the Cus-
toms in Brisbane, which he held
until his death in 1897. In him
Queensland lost one of the most
respected members of her people.
Mr. Beetham was survived by his
son, Charles Alfred Beetham, J.P.,
who for several years has resided at
his charming homestead, “Listow,”
in the Beaudesert district, and
whose personality still presides over
the pastoral and social affairs of
that ineffably beautiful rural gar-
den of Queensland. His father
MR. JOHN FRANCIS BEETHAM.
devoted himself to his son’s earlier
education, which was completed at
the illustrious academy then con-
ducted by the late John Long, a
teacher of high repute. Ultimately


the academy was taken over by the
Christian Brothers, and was one of
the foundation stones of the great
educational system now carried on
by that fraternity. Mr. Beetham’s
first entry into public life was his
appointment to a position in the
Savings Bank Department of the
State, his brilliant educational
career specially marking him out for
that office. For eight years he
remained in the department, reach-
ing the responsible post of chief
ledger-keeper. The financial equip-
ment thus gained turned his
thoughts to business for himself, and
therefore, not seeing any immediate
prospect of rising higher in the
State service, he resigned, and
hazarding life and health in his pur-
suit. Twenty years of that strain told
a tale on his nervous system, and in
1909 he decided to dispose of his
business. Like his father, he turned
his thoughts to the land, and
choosing the scene of his youthful
experiences at Beaudesert,, he pur-
chased his present holding “Listow,”
and established himself in the dairy-
ing industry. Naturally a man of
Mr. Beetham’s personality has exer-
cised much influence upon those
amongst whom he has moved.
Indeed, for the past quarter of a
century he has taken an active part
in the general progress and advance-
ment of the communities in which
he has lived. The various public
Beetham being a born sport has
taken keen interest in the affaire of
that club; and indeed every branch
of legitimate sport has his patronage
in both purse and person. Amongst
the many broader questions in which
he has taken special interest is the
question of Home Rule for Ireland.
It happened that he celebrated his
twenty-first birthday in the Emerald
Isle, and during his sojourn in that
beautiful country learned much that
enlisted his sympathetic soul in the
cause of Erin’s freedom. His charit-
able doings, though so many and
truly impartial as to race or creed,
are well known only to those who
have occasion to enjoy them. In
1884 Mr. Beetham married Theresa,

started out on his own account. Mr.
Beetham had noted the great possi-
bilities in oyster-breeding; the grow-
ing trade in oysters beween Moreton
Bay and the south at that time
pointing to inevitable development
on a large scale. Securing a number
of valuable leases in Moreton Bay
from the Government, Mr. Beetham
commenced oyster cultivation on
scientific lines. His efforts were
crowned with signal success, which
proved the high calibre of his com-
mercial capacity. He worked on the
maxim, “If you want anything
properly done do it yourself.” In all
weathers, therefore, and untiringly,
he himself tended his oyster beds,

For 20 years he was a member of
the Southport Divisional Board, and
was its president for several years.
When that body was elevated to the
distinction of a shire council he was
returned to the council board, and
subsequently he was elected chair-
man, a position which he retained
for two years. Immediately Mr.

The late ALFRED MARKWELL
was a native of Queensland, having
been born at Bulimba, near Bris-
bane, on May 23, 1851. H e was
second son of the late Samuel
MR. SAMUEL MARKWELL.
Markwell, who spent his early life
in Lincolnshire, England, of which
county he was a native, subsequently
coming to Australia by the emigrant
ship “Chasely,” and landing in
Queensland in the year 1848, when
farming industry, and was well
established in this district at the
time of the separation of Queensland
from the Mother State in 1859. As
a “colonial” (the term of the day)
in good standing, this event was
fraught with considerable interest
for him, as for the other early
settlers, who by their strenuous
efforts to develop the country opened
up by previous exploration, deserve
the greatest possible credit from the
younger generation of Queensland-
ers now enjoying the fruits of their
fathers’ labours. In 1864 Samuel
Markwell left Bulimba to proceed to
the Lower Logan, then known as
Slack Creek, where he took up a
larger holding, and with the assist-
ance of his sons pursued operations
in this locality for some considerable
time. In 1872 he leased the Slack
Creek Block to a tenant, and selected
a holding which originally formed
part of the old “Beaudesert” Run,
and under the name of “Kargorum”
is now occupied by a son of that
grand old pioneer, Mr. John Mark-
well. Here, with his large family
of sons, he once more started to
build up an agricultural and pas-
toral proposition, and during the 11
years that elapsed before his death,
which occurred in 1883, became a
well-known and beloved personality
by his fellow-members of the com-
munity with which he had cast in
his lot. Mr. Alfred Markwell was
educated at Bulimba, where he
attended for some years one of the

in the district, honoured and
esteemed not only by those of his
own kin with whom he was brought
most closely into contact, but also
in the development of the property
taken up by his father in that
locality. Being of an independent
and enterprising disposition, at 15


he launched out on his own account
in company with his brother John,
the two young bushmen taking on
contracts for the breaking up of
land for the formation of sugar
plantations in various parts of the
Moreton Bay district, in a south-
easterly direction from Brisbane,
which work they continued for
several years. Subsequently the
brothers, being possessed of a - full
share of perspicacity, united with
strength and skill, perceived greater
possibilities in the timber industry,
and aiming at the highest results
began operations in the line of milled
hardwoods, with which they united
various other branches of the indus-
try. Some years later, in 1872, Mr.
Alfred Markwell came to Beau-
desert, where he spent 12 months,
and the boom in sugar production
then being at its height in Queens-
land, he forthwith decided to try
his fortune in this direction, with
which purpose in view he removed
to the Lower Albert district, and
started a plantation. In 1877 he
selected land on the Upper Albert
River, now known as “Ladybrook,”
a grazing property of considerable
area, which he stocked and con-
tinued to administer successfully as
such for some little time. In 1883,
conjointly with his brother, he again
carried on extensive operations for
about five years, and at the close of
that period was fortunate in dis-
covering a further avenue to pros-
perity in the pinewood trade, a

increasing in value, and has ever
since retained its popularity. This,
combined with mixed-farming and
grazing, became the principal source
concentrated his energies upon the
most profitable methods of turn-
ing these to account, the home
estate, “Ladybrook,” being applied
to crops and cattle and pig-raising.
This valuable property is situated
some 18 miles from Beaudesert, its
boundary adjoining that of the new
National Park, which forms a splen-
did tract of 47,000 acres of mountain
and plateau country overlooking the
southern portion of Queensland and
far over northern New South Wales.
The estate is about 2,300 acres in
extent, and embraces much good
grass country, which whether gently
undulating or more decidedly hilly
in character, makes excellent grazing
pastures for the stock. These wind-
swept uplands have a healthful
charm all their own, but at times
both man and beast are glad to turn
their steps to the grassy flats, which
in green fertility lie along the banks
of the several rivers and creeks in
the locality. The main stream of the

branch, with Stockyard Creek, and
another smaller creek or two, form
the principal waterways of the pro-

was gazetted as Beaudesert Shire,

event Mr. Markwell was duly
returned without opposition, an
honour which was repeated up
to the time of his decease,
except on one occasion, when
Mr. R. J. Warren, of Beaudesert,
unsuccessfully opposed him. At the

in the district with a good deal of

time, when he was duly elected
by the ratepayers. In the year
1914 he retired from the shire
council, with which he had been
associated for so many years, and
upon this occasion was the recipient
of an illuminated address from the
leading representatives of the various
public organizations and ratepayers,
which was couched in the following
terms: —“To Alfred Markwell, Esq.
Dear Sir—-When it became known
to your friends at the beginning of
this year that you had decided to
resign your position as a Councillor
of the Beaudesert Shire Council, it
it is hardly to be expected during
that great length of time that you
have been able to supply all wants.
Still, it must be a great source of
satisfaction to you to reflect that
during the space of time which you
represented the ratepayers your
countless good services to your
council and your district are to the
utmost extent appreciated, which is
indeed a record to be proud of, and
which is enjoyed by few men in this
State. Du ring the time which you
sat at the council table some of the
boldest and most important works
ever taken on by a local authority
have been carried out, and during


all these your sound judgment and
quick grasp of the vital points at
issue have been of the greatest assist-
ance in carrying events to a success-
ful termination. But your services
to the council represent but a small
portion of your good deeds performed
on behalf of Beaudesert and district,
as there is not a single institution
having as its object the advancement
of the town and district in which
you have not taken a most active
part. Since the foundation of the
Logan and Albert Agrcultural and
Pastoral Society you have acted on
the executive, and also have been a
prominent and successful exhibitor;
whilst your splendid support to the
Logan and Albert Jockey Club and
other clubs will never be forgotten.
These are but a few of the institu-
tions which have received your
generous assistance, and we feel that
every sportsman worthy of the name
in the district has none but the
kindest feelings for you. This year
of grace will, we have no doubt, be
long remembered by you, owing to
the terrific war which is engaging
our nation, and we feel sure that
you as a loyal and patriotic Aus-
tralian, and a worthy descendant of
those grand old Britishers who made
this great country of ours, share the
wish that our flag will never be
hauled down, and that the

MR. J. E. MARKWELL AND RESIDENCE, DARLINGTON.
The late Mr. Markwell was always a
prominent figure in local sporting
circles, and in 1881 he occupied an
official position in connection with
the Logan and Albert Jockey Club.
For a lengthy period he was a
very useful member of the Logan
and Albert Agricultural and Pas-
toral Society, always holding himself
ready to render assistance of the
most valuable nature when his ser-
vices were requisitioned in any par-
ticular direction. In every respect
he proved himself a member of whom
the community should be proud,
and, as may be gathered from the
foregoing eulogy, he won the
respect and esteem of all his fellow-
residents in Beaudesert. Mr. Mark-
well was married in 1880 to Hilda
Hannah, daughter of the late Wil-
liam Everdell, one of Queensland’s
early pioneers, who, hailing from
Walton, England, came to Australia
in the middle fifties, and subse-
quently became well known all over
the Logan district, where he was
engaged in business pursuits, with
which he combined the carrying and
grazing industries. William Ever-
dell was one of the first to proceed
to the western districts of Queens-
land, accompanying the late John
Collins to the Dawson River before
1860; and in those early days he was
closely associated with Mr. Collins
and other members of the family
before the era which marked their
inclusion among the ranks of leading
pastoralists of this State. The late
Mr. Everdell died in 1902 at Wood-
hill, where he had been living in
partial retirement for several years
prior to his decease. He left a
family of seven, all of whom are
engaged on the land. Mr. Mark-
well, who died on January 27, 1917,
was survived by a family of five sons,
all of whom are engaged in farming
and grazing occupations in and
around Beaudesert.

in arras, first set foot on Queens-
land soil. Coming originally from
Rochedale, Lancashire, England,
where his family had been held
in very high respect for many
generations, Mr. John Stephens, who
was a man of considerable scholastic
attainments, arrived at Sydney
about the year 1858, and it was two
years later that his second son, Mr.
Edgar Stephens, whose career forms
the subject of this article, was born.
Subsequent to his advent to the
infant capital of the northern
colony Mr. John Stephens secured a
position as manager of the shipping
company which was the parent of
the present A.U.S.N. Company, and
retained this post until his brother,
the Hon. T. B. Stephens, became
proprietor of The Brisbane Courier,
when he was entrusted by the new
owner with the management of this
important newspaper. Mr. Stephens
carried out the duties of this respon-
sible post for a number of years, but
when the proprietary passed into
other hands he resigned from the
staff, and shortly afterwards entered
into partnership with the late J. B.
Ellis, founding the well-known firm
of J. B. Ellis & Co., auctioneers and
general agents, in which connection
he continued until the time of his
death in the year 1887. Of a quiet
disposition, even-tempered, and char-
itable to a fault, John Stephens will
long be remembered by a wide circle
of friends and beneficiaries, the
number of those to whom he took the
opportunity of doing a good turn
without ostentation or hope of
reward or credit, being legion. A
family of four sons and three daugh-
ters survived him. The eldest of
the sons, Mr.W. H. Stephens, is now
in business at Burleigh Heads;
another is farming in the Beaudesert
district, while the youngest son, Mr.
Frank Hugh Stephens, practises as
a dental surgeon at Maryborough,
in this State. The gentleman under
review, Mr. Edgar Slephens, received
his education at the Brisbane Boys’
Grammar School, and upon the
termination of his scholastic career
was placed by his father, who
intended him for commercial life, in
the old historic firm of Messrs. J.
and G. Harris, which at that time
transacted the biggest mercantile
business in Brisbane. Here he was
to be trained in the various depart-
ments of knowledge necessary to
the eqiiipment of a general mer-
chant, but a limited experience of
warehouse and office routine soon
proved that such a life could hold
no charm for him. Following the
bent of his desire, which was to
breathe the air of the bush and find
Lis occupation on the wind-swept
country areas, he cast off the
shackles of hie indoor position and
set his face towards Cooper Plains,
where in partnership with his
brother, Mr. W. H. Stephens, he
invested his meagre capital in a few

of any population, and the prospect
of having to convey dairy produce
to the capital over roads which now
would be considered well-nigh
impassable, was sufficient to daunt
the stoutest heart. Many of the old
settlers who had seen the territory
selected by Mr. Stephens strongly
advised him to relinquish his project,
urging that it would be impossible
to secure any measure of success in
face of the appalling obstacles which
stood in the way. Nevertheless, he
decided to stick by his bargain, and

before him, within four or five years
he had put the worst of the
work behind him. Being
now 25 years old he decided
to marry, and though lie
had only a two-roomed slab
“humpy” to which to bring
his bride, he was signally
fortunate in the selection
of a helpmeet, the young
wife who consented to share
his lot being one of those
loyal and heroic women who
regardless of their own per-
sonal comfort and the sacri-
fices demanded of them,
have done so much to
alleviate the hardships at-
tendant upon the pathway
of the pioneer. Rough

encountered the period of general
depression which spell ruin to
so many Queenslanders. After 17


years' strenuous work and the steady
building up of the fabric which
should have meant consistently
increasing prosperity, Mr. Stephens
found himself penniless and forced
to resign his property to the finan-
cial institution from which he had
hoped to obtain temporary assistance
until the time of stress was over.
Straining every nerve in the effort
to provide for the young family
dependent upon him, he strove to
recoup his fallen fortunes by engag-
ing in the timber industry, but this
department of industrial enterprise
witnessed the same dread dull-
ness prevailing elsewhere, and his
a gratifying token of the confidence
which ‘his pluck, industry, and
integrity had inspired in the breasts
of his fellow-citizens when several of
them came forward in what they
realized was a dire emergency in the
career of their co-settler with the
offer of financial assistance, for
which they required no other security
than his good name and honour. Of
this, they told him, they were
already assured both by observation
and hearsay, and this assertion from
such men as the late Alfred Mark-
well, of Darlington, and Messrs.
Lahey Bros., of Beaudesert, in itself
was sufficient to spur him to renew
this block, which comprised some
470 acres, with the firm intention of
winning his way to the goal of his
desire. Once more the star of pros-
perity was rising over Queensland,
better times being in store for all
classes of the community, and
sooner than he had dared to hope,
Mr. Stephens found himself in a
position to repay the loan which had
tided him over the period of gloom,

he retains the liveliest feelings of
gratitude towards the friends who

endeavours in this direction also had
to be abandoned. Finally, with a
couple of friends who were similarly
situated with himself, he determined
upon a bolder stroke. The three
settlers chartered a special railway
train to take them with their bullock
teams to Charleville, and for some
time they were able to obtain
lucrative employment by carting
wool in the Cunnamulla district.
Eventually, at the turn of the tide

home to the faithful partner of his
woes, who with her little children

his efforts to win an independency
for himself and his family. Provided
with fresh capital, Mr. Stephens set
himself to the task of retrieving his
fallen fortunes, and proving to his
kindly patrons that their trust in
his ability and integrity had not
been misplaced. His former pro-
perty, upon which he had spent so
much time and labour in shaping to
his especial purposes and liking, had
passed into other hands, but his
belief in the locality as a good
dairying and general farming dis-
trict being as strong as ever, he pur-
chased the property adjoining his
former holding and settled down on
obligation must ever remain. Thence
onward he enjoyed a fair run of
prosperity, and as his children
increased in years was able to launch
out in various directions with every
assurance of success. The acquire-
ment of sufficient acreage to enable
him to carry on operations on an
extended scale was naturally a mat-
ter near to his heart, and the fine
expanse of 2,000 acres of which he
now holds the freehold, is the best
evidence of the realization of that
ambition. The hard-won experience
of which he had become master
enabled him to utilize this area to
the best advantage, and to-day the


“Cedar Glen” property is recognized
as being one of the best-developed
and most productive farms of the
district. Sixteen hundred acres have
been sown with artificial grasses,
which greatly enhance the value of
the country as pasture land, to
which purpose the character of the
land makes it highly adaptable.
With the exception of about 60
acres devoted to cultivation on the
fiats, a succession of hills and valleys
marks out the place as stock country,
and though precipitous in places
there are no portions inaccessible to
the cattle intent on the pursuit of
nourishing herbage. Indeed, every
inch of the estate may be said to
have its own value for the varied
purposes to which it is applied by
the owner, these including grazing,
fruitgrowing, dairy-farming, and
production of honey, the lastnamed
being the most successful project
inaugurated under the direction of
Mr. Stephens’ third son, Mr. A. H.
Stephens, who has developed the
apiary on scientific lines, until it is
now entitled to rank among the best
of its kind in Queensland. “Cedar
Glen” lies some 25 miles south-east
of Beaudesert, within a few miles
of the New South Wales border.
The homestead area, which was won
out of the most impossible-looking
bush, is graced by a residence of

and five daughters, all of whom
were educated at home under the
supervision of an efficient tutor,
and who, with the exception of one
daughter, married to Mr. A. E.
Burnett, son of Mr. G. Burnett, of
the Forestry Department, who is
farming land at Christmas Creek,
still call the paternal roof-tree
home. Mrs. Stephens is a daughter
of the late Charles Watson, of Bris-
bane, whose father was the first
immigration agent appointed in
Queensland. As has already been
hinted, Mrs. Stephens has proved
an ideal wife, nobly seconding her
husband in all his endeavours, and
cheerfully enduring the many and
varied trials inseparable from the
pioneer life. It may be mentioned
as a proof of her devotion to the
interests of her family that for a
period extending over five years she
was never outside the slip-rails of
the farm and it is readily conceded
by Mr. Stephens that the prosper-
ity which in the event has crowned
his labours is due in no small
measure to the sympathy, encourage-
ment, and wise counsel of his wife.
Mr. Stephens has had the honour
and privilege of giving two sons to
fight for their country, one of whom,
Robert Edgar, took part in the
historic landing of Australians at
Gallipoli, and subsequently whilst
fighting in the trenches, in which
he remained from April to July 25,
was wounded by shrapnel and sent
to Egypt. The other, Alfred Hugh
Stephens, also did his share in
the fighting at the Dardanelles.
Another word of praise must
be spoken in regard to the
heroism shown by Mrs. Stephens
when called upon to part with her
sons in this great cause. Realizing
that they are the rightful defenders
of all held most sacred by Britain
and her Allies, she gave them
willingly to the service of the
Empire, and in common with the
other noble mothers of Australia
waits in hope and trust for the
final victory which shall give back
to Queensland her splendid sons who
have shed over the State a lustre
that shall remain undimmed
throughout the ages yet to come.

The late Michael Yore was a native
of County Meath—Royal Meath of
the Irish Kingdoms —and the name
of Yore in that county is as old as
Irish civilization itself. The home of
the Yore family, in the Nobber
district, dates back to the days of
Cromwell, when Ireland’s history
was written in blood, some of which
flowed from the veins of the pro-
genitors of the present generation of
Yores. The late Michael Yore
arrived in Queensland in the ship
“Fiery Star” in 1863, amongst his
fellow-passengers being Thomas
Plunkett, with whom he formed a
lifelong comradeship. With him
Mr. Yore engaged in a contract for
the Queensland Government, build-

MICHAEL FRANCIS YORE,
"Ardee, Logan Village, was born
at Tambourine, Queensland, on
March 30, in the year 1874, and is
one of a family of three sons and
five daughters born to the fine old
pioneer couple, the late Michael
Tore and his wife. Further reference
to the late Michael Yore will
be found in the preceding article.
Mr. Michael Francis Yore was
educated at the local State school
at Tambourine, and at 14 years of
age discontinued his studies to begin
active life on his father’s farm.
Here he gained a comprehensive
acquaintance with various branches
of agricultural work, and assisted in
the dairying enterprise which occu-
pied a large share of attention on
the holding. In his early twenties

his father aided him in launching
out for himself by making over to
him the property on which he now
resides. This was originally one of
several small farms first settled in
the early sixties, and subsequently
purchased by the late Michael Yore
in conjunction with other landed
holdings. The young farmer entered
upon his task of development with
energy and the will to succeed, and
before long had a thriving little
dairy farm, the operations of which
became considerably' extended as
the years went by. “Ardee” is
situated on the Logan River, within
two miles of Logan Village railway
station, and some 28 miles from the
metropolis, and was among the first
of the holdings in that district to
come under the attention of the
pioneer settlers, its acres being
cleared and cultivated before the
majority of the prosperous farms of
the present day had been selected.
Its two miles of frontage to the fine
stream of the Logan, which is
permanently navigable for small boats
from its mouth to a point beyond
Mr. Yore’s boundary, caused it to
be held in high estimation as a valu-
able property, as this made it
possible for all produce to be sent
by water to the Brisbane markets.
Apart from the river the estate is
well watered, two permanent creeks

few years after entering into posses-
sion, when Mr. Yore had succeeded
in establishing operations on a sound
basis, he turned his attention to the
erection of the present modern resi-
dence, which was completed in 1910.

tive with its outward appearance,
and the domestic arrangements are
so entirely up-to-date that it is
sometimes difficult to recollect that
“Ardee,” instead of being the sub-
urban residence of some city man is
situated two miles distant from a
village of less than a couple of
hundred inhabitants. One of the
chief charms of the home is its
beautiful situation, commanding
views of an extensive stretch of
plain country, dotted about with the
cultivation ' fields of prosperous
farms, and dignified with the near


vicinity of Tambourine Mountain,
which rears its lofty head in gran-
deur to the clouds. In addition to
the industries already mentioned as
carried on by Mr. Yore, he has
indulged himself in the fascinating
hobby of breeding blood horses, and
although his brood stock has always
been strictly limited in number, he
has recorded some excellent results
in this line of enterprise. The classy
mare “Rosard,” by “Rosanule”
(imported Irish stock) out of “Ard-
na-ree,” whose triumphs in the
Q.T.C. St. Leger and Brisbane Cup
of 1913 are still fresh in the memory
of frequenters of the turf, was bred
at “Ardee.” “Ard-na-ree,” the dam
of this distinguished performer, is
by “Uabba,” out of “Agatha,” and
holds her own as one of the most
stylish-looking and roomy brood
mares in the State. Other of
her progeny bred by Mr. Yore are
“Lough-Ard,” “Lady Ardee,” and
“Ardara.” “Ard-na-ree” herself has
various honours to her credit, includ-
ing a Southport Handicap, in which
she beat a first-class field, and on
another occasion came second in
a weight-for-age event at Ascot, the
winner of the latter being “Fitz-
grafton,” one of the best horses ever
raced in Queensland. Mr. Yore also
owns “Sunripe,” by “Sundridge”—
“Full Ripe,” by “Fullerton”—
“Black Cherry,” by “Bendigo”—
“Black Duchess,” by “Galliard,” a
son of the famous “Galopin.”
“Sunstar” were the leading winning

and are regarded with popular
favour by regular followers of the
turf. Mr. Yore’s interest in the
“sport of kings” dates back to his
more youthful days, when as an
amateur he won various important
events. He is well known as one of
the prominent men of the district,
Kingston, and indeed was the very
first to call a meeting of the resi-
dents of his district to confer upon
and inaugurate this enterprise,
which in the event has proved one
of the most thriving co-operative
schemes of its kind in the State.
He has actively concerned himself in
matters of local government, and for
some years occupied a seat in the
council chamber of Tambourine
Shire. In 1911 he was married to

ANDREW THOMAS YORE, of
‘Spiddle,” Tambourine, is the
youngest son of the late Michael
Tore, extended references to
whom will be found elsewhere
in this work (page 780). Mr.
Andrew Thomas Yore was born in
the homestead where he now resides,
on September 22, 1883, and for his
primary education attended Tam-
bourine State School. Afterwards
he was a student for a time at the
Beaudesert school, which he left at
the age of 16 to assume his share of
duties on the old homestead farm,
where he has remained ever since.
During the years which have elapsed
since first the late Michael Yore cast
proprietary eyes on the 350-acre
holding which he had purchased
from the “Tambourine” Station run,
the area of the “Spiddle” property
has varied from time to time,
additional acres now being pur-
chased, and anon a portion sold. It
is now about the same size as in the
first instance—a neat, compact, and
well-developed farm, highly suitable
for dairying purposes, which is the
principal industry carried on by the
present occupant, though crops are
cultivated in sufficient quantity for
the proper providing of green and

of Tambourine Mountain, which
rears its lofty head from three to
four miles distant, and very fine
views, inspiring and delightful in the
extreme, may be enjoyed from

which was built by the late Michael
Yore, and has now been standing
for 35 years, is typical of the era
which first witnessed the rising of
its walls from the ground. Designed
with a view to comfort and utility
rather than for architectural display,
it is truly a pleasant abode, its
ancient shingle roof marking it as an
early settler’s homestead, whilst
various modern improvements testify
to a progressive spirit at work.
Besides his farming proposition, Mr.
Yore owns other real estate interests
in the neighbourhood, the Tam-
bourine Hotel and store having
been erected by him and leased to
their present holders. He also has
a block of land situated at the foot
of Tambourine Mountain, embracing
a few horses, which are kept for the
uses of the farm. The property is

desert, is the second son of the late
Thomas Plunkett, who for over 19
years represented Albert Electorate

in the Legislative Assembly of
Queensland, retiring from the
political arena in 1907. The late
gentleman was born in Ireland, and
came to Queensland by the ship
‘Tiery Star” in 1863. Shortly after
arrival at Moreton Bay he took up a
holding in the Logan district, and
commenced the strenuous pioneer
labours which were necessary in the
preparation of the land for agricul-
tural purposes. In pursuit of this
enterprise he encountered his full
share of hardship and danger, con-
tinual watch having to be kept
against the visitations of the noma-
dic aboriginal tribes, whilst floods
and droughts alike brought disaster
in their train. Roads were rough or
non-existent, and in the absence of
carriers of any kind the settlers,
many of whom possessed no horse,
were compelled to walk to Brisbane
and carry their food provisions home
on their backs. Mr. Plunkett, how-
ever, surmounted all obstacles suc-
cessfully, and having established his
proposition on a sound basis, in 1866
he married, some six years later
removing to Tambourine, where he
settled on the picturesque banks of
the Albert River. Here he became
engaged in up-to-date dairying
operations on an extensive scale, and
also gave considerable attention to
agriculture, while as opportunity
offered he added to his landed
possessions, acquiring the fine pro-
perty at Kerry, which is now being
worked by his son, and a large
grazing block situated between
Logan Village and Tambourine. In
1888, in response to the solicitations
of his numerous friends and
admirers, Mr. Plunkett allowed .him-
self to be nominated as a candidate
for Parliamentary honours, and was
duly returned by the Albert con-
stituency, when he sat as a supporter
of the Mcllwraith Administration.
After representing this district con-
tinuously for eight years, he was
defeated by the late Hon. R. M.
Collins on a very memorable occa-
sion, but three years later turned
the tables on his late opponent, and
was again successful at the general
election of 1902. In 1904 he was
returned unopposed, and in 1907
defeated Mr. J. G. Appel. This
Parliament’s life was a short one,
however, and upon the Premier’s
decision to appeal to the people, Mr.
Plunkett did not offer himself for
re-election. He was a leading mem-
ber of the first Farmers’ Party, and
was one of the most strenuous
advocates of co-operation on the part
of the primary producers in order to
secure for themselves the necessary
legislation to enable them to carry
on their enterprise under the best
possible conditions. Testifying to
the usefulness of Mr. Plunkett’s
political career, Mr. Appel on one
occasion mentioned that he had been
a consistent advocate of the opening
up of Crown Lands for settlement,
and especially of throwing open the
large areas in the Albert district
held back as timber reserves, which
owing in a great measure to his
representations had since been made
available for settlement. His senti-
ments being opposed to Federation,
on the ground that it would be
injurious to the best interests of the
State, he conducted in conjunction
with Mr. Appel a very vigorous
campaign throughout his electorate
on the occasion of the taking of a
referendum on this subject, and
afterwards urged the rescinding of
the agreement arrived at in the
House. He took a prominent part
in securing railway facilities between
Logan Village and Canungra, and it
was a matter of great regret to
all those interested that owing to
ill-health he was unable to attend
the ceremony in connection with the
turning of the first sod in 1913. In
the sporting and athletic circles of
the community he was always well to
the fore, as a noted athlete himself
giving personal support to outdoor
recreation of a stimulating and
healthful character. He was easily
at the head of affairs in the football
field, and was unanimously elected
captain of the local club, while in
other directions he always proved
himself a valuable ally of the youth-
ful “sports” of the place. The late
Mr. Plunkett’s decease occurred at
Sandgate on September 2, 1913. The
subject of this notice, Mr. Thomas
Flood Plunkett, J.P., was one of
eight children (four sons and four
daughters) born to the late pioneer
and his wife (nee Miss Mary Ryan),
his native place being Indooroopilly,
Queensland, where he first saw the
light on December 19, 1878. He
received his primary education at a
local school, completing his scholas-
tic studies at the Christian Brothers’
College, Gregory Terrace, Brisbane,
and subsequently took up duties on
his father’s property at Tambourine,
where his boyhood days had been
chiefly spent. Upon attaining his
twentieth year he left the paternal
homestead to take control of the
estate now known as “Beauparc,” at
Kerry, near Beaudesert, and initi-
ated a flourishing dairying industry
on this farm, which upon his advent
was almost totally unimproved. Mr.
Plunkett turned all his energies to
grappling successfully with the pro-
ject before him, and the result of his
well-directed efforts has been the
establishment of what may well be
described as one of the model farms

a keen interest in affairs of special

being impressed with the value of

years ago became a director of the

Company, and is now (1915) chair-

in the year 1874 by the late Thomas
Plunkett, father of the gentlemen
under review, to whom extended
reference is made in the preceding
article. The “Ville Marie” Estate
is a well-developed farm of some
2,000 acres, and consists chiefly
of grazing country suitable for
by natural means, lagoon and sur-
face water {providing a never-failing
supply. The present homestead has
replaced the original dwelling-house
built by the late Mr. Plunkett, and
occupies the same site, which lies
about a mile from the Tambourine
railway station, on the metropolitan
side. It is a well-built modern house
of villa design, containing 12 rooms,
and with its verandahs, lawns, and
shade trees, presents a pleasing
aspect from the Beaudesert main
road. The brothers reside here with
their widowed mother, a daughter of
the late Edward Ryan, who came to
Queensland from King’s County,
Ireland, among the pioneering sett-
lers of 1862. Mrs. Plunkett, then a
girl in her early teens, was a pas-
senger by the “Erin-go-Bragh” with
her father, and subsequently came to
reside with him in the Logan district,
where she met her future husband.
Mr. George Christopher Joseph
Plunkett was born in the old
homestead of ‘‘Ville Marie” on
May 20, 1880. He received his
education at Beaudesert, and upon
leaving school became engaged in
farming pursuits on his father’s pro-
perty at Tambourine, where he has
continued ever since. He manages
the estate conjointly with his brother,
and has met with success in the
undertaking, the affairs of the pro-
perty prospering under their regime.

of the picturesque rural district.
Thomas Dunne, one of this long line
of worthies, was the father of Mr.
Laurence Dunne. The last-named
received a sound education at the
national school in his native parish.
After leaving school young Dunne
was taken in hand by his father,
who put him through his apprentice-
ship on the family farm. Amongst
those emigrants who had made
Queensland their adopted home was
an aunt of young Dunne. Her let-
ters to her brother, Laurence’s
father, glowed with enthusiasm for
the free life in Queensland. One of
these letters invited Laurence to
join his aunt, the system of nomina-
tion having just then been estab-
lished. Prevailing on his father
to permit him to join his aunt in
Queensland, he set sail in the
“Indus” from London early in the
year 1870. Immediately he reached
Waterford, in the Logan district,
where his aunt bad a small farm,
Mr. Dunne devoted himself to work
in the sugar industry. Two years of
the work enabled him to gauge the
chances that were ahead but he per-
ceived that he should gain experi-
ence in directions in which his
knowledge of the sugar industry
would be greatly enhanced. He
mastered all that was to be mastered
in Queensland pioneering bush life,
until finally he obtained a respon-
sible position on the staff of the
Colonial Sugar Refining Company.
For some years at their Tweed River
mill he served the company, mean-
while putting aside that necessary
little stand-by for future possibilities.
These came in 1883, when he set
forth on his own account to make
a home for himself and his wife, to
whom just then he had been wedded.
Mr. Dunne and his bride faced the
task of turning an uncleared area
of 320 acres into a smiling farm.
Steadily the holding was improved,
and became splendidly self-support-
ing. Mrs. Dunne’s father, the late
Andrew Farrelly, was a farmer—
the occupation which in their
native land Mr. Farrelly’s ancestors
long and successfully had fol-
lowed. He was well and honour-
ably known in his native county;
his name appeared on the list of the
honorary magistracy, no mean dis-
tinction in those days. As time
went on Mr. Dunne and his good
wife had the satisfaction of seeing
the reward of their dauntless efforts.
To their original holding they were
able to add, until to-day .1,500 broad
acres of goodly land are theirs. In
the work attendant on these achieve-
ments their latter-day efforts have
been greatly assisted by their three
stalwart sons, who together with two
winsome daughters comprise the
Dunne family. ‘‘Rosevale” is

go-Bragh.” The emigrants who on
that particular voyage came to
Queensland all subsequently made
their mark in the different
spheres in which they set-
tled down. James Deerain
did not lose any time in
going on the land, and as
at that time he was a man
of mature years he was
able to apply his stores of
experience to the work he
took in hand. Fie settled
on a small holding on the
Logan River, at that great
Irish agricultural centre,
Waterford, where he reared
his family, who were or-
phaned by the death of
their mother shortly after
the birth of the third child.
When their father died the
two sons sold out the Water-
ford farm with a view to
extending operations on
a larger area. Richard
Deerain chose his present
holding at Kerry, in the
Beaudesert district, an area
that offered wide scope of oppor-
tunity for his agricultural knowledge
as acquired while working with his
father, which he did continuously
from the time he had received the
best education the State school
system then afforded. He had prac-
tically acquired "Shamrock Vale”
while with his father, but until
permanently settling on it he had
not done any improvement work on
it. On settling there he built his
house, married, and ever since has
been one of the best-known and
most highly-respected residents of
the district, one who by his industry,
thrift, and uprightness is held up
as an example amongst his worthy
neighbours. His original area was
a farm covering 580 acres, which
he put to such good use that as time
went on he put by sufficient capital
to enable him greatly to increase his
holding, so that to-day he is able to
survey with proprietary eye no
fewer than 2,400 acres. The whole
of the area is devoted to mixed
farming, principally grazing and
dairying, together, of course, with
the necessary cultivation area for
fodder and marketing. In develop-
ing the homestead to its existing
splendidly improved condition he has
been ably assisted by his only son,
who like his progenitors is devoted
to the land. This son, James Phillip,
is the eldest of the family. He was
born in the present home, and was
educated at the State school in
Kerry, wdiere he was regarded as a
very sound scholar. Mrs. Richard
Deerain is a daughter of the late

James Trihey, an Irish descendant
of one of those French families who
at that time so widely intermarried
with the Irish. Her marriage to
Mr. Deerain took place in 1885.
As well as the son, there are
three daughters, the eldest of whom
is the wife of Mr. W. Wilke, a well-
known dairyfarmer in the district.
The second daughter is wedded

to a son of the late Thomas
Plunkett, who for many years
was one of Queensland’s most
prominent politicians, and of whom
a more extended notice appears in
another part of this work, while the
youngest daughter still resides with
her parents. "Shamrock Vale” is
about eight miles from Beaudesert.
Mr. Deerain also owns 700 acres of
fine land on the Logan River, about
30 miles from his homestead.

ancient name, of which the origin
is lost in the obscurity of antiquity,
being the scion of a yeoman family
who figured among the earliest Celts
mentioned in the annals of Irish
history. A farmer himself, and a
son of generations of farmers, he had
learned the lesson of thinking for
himself whilst pursuing his daily
round of toil, and by degrees it
became clear to him that the

opportunities offering in the land of
his birth were not to be compared with
those flung at the feet of many of
his countrymen who had cut the ties
which bound them to the little
motherland, and sought their destiny-
under southern skies. Eventually he
found himself a passenger on board
the historic emigrant vessel “Erin-
go-Bragh”—a name which conjures
up happy memories in the minds of
many of the sturdy old Australian
pioneers who were by her borne
across the ocean to what was then
a land of promise, and which even-
tually became the scene of their life’s
achievement. Disembarking at the
young settlement of Moreton Bay,
Mr. Corcoran obtained employment
from the Government in the shape
of contracts for the construction of
the iron roads of commerce, which
have done so much towards the
settlement of the State. Care-
fully putting by such of his earn-
ings as he could spare, in time
he had saved sufficient capital to
make a beginning on his own
account, and for this purpose took
up a block of land on the Lower
Logan for farming purposes. On
this first small holding he built a
little home, and while he cleared and
cultivated acre after acre, kept his
eyes open for the property j»ar
excellence, which should suit in
every particular with his ideas. A
decade passed before this presented
itself, and during that interval Mr.
Corcoran continued steadily to
improve the holding upon which he
had first established himself. Upon
approving the locality of “Erin’s
Home,” he sold the Lower Logan
farm, and from that time forward
until the period of his death devoted
himself to building up and enlarging
the 320-acre block upon which he
erected his homestead, and inaugu-
rated dairying and grazing opera-
tions. Another holding of similar
acreage was acquired at an early
date, and subsequently land at
Teviot and Allen Creek came under
Mr. Corcoran’s proprietorship, until
at his decease the estate embraced

about 1,000 acres. This has since
been enlarged by the family to the
extent of 2,000 acres, the whole of
which is now administered by the
late Mr. Charles Corcoran’s two
sons, Mr. James Corcoran and
his younger brother. Tire late
Mr. Corcoran died on December
4, 1902. His widow, nee Mary
Deerain, is a daughter of one of the
early Irish pioneers who settled in
Waterford, Queensland, in the early
sixties, and by her he had the two
sons above mentioned. The elder,
Mr. James Corcoran, was born at
Bromelton, where he now resides, on
May 15, 1877, and was educated
locally. Upon the completion of his
studies he took up duties on his
father’s farm, and following the
decease of the late Mr. Corcoran
took over the management of affairs.
Mr. J. Corcoran is a Justice of
the Peace and an alderman of the
Beaudesert Town Council. He is also
a member of the council of the local
agricultural and pastoral society,
has served as a committeeman of the
local school board, and gives cordial
support to any movement for the
general advancement of the district.
The younger brother, Mr. Charles
Corcoran, was also born at Bromel-
ton on August 23, 1880. He is
associated with Mr. James Corcoran
in the, conduct of the property, and
makes it his special province to
attend to home interests.


WILLIAM TUTIN WALKER,
“Townsvale,” Veresdale, was born
at "Threple House,” Lundie, For-
farshire, Scotland, on September 26,
1834, and is a son of the late Joseph
Walker, whose father, a cotton-
spinner of Manchester, represented
an old Yorkshire family, which hac
been engaged in this industry for
several generations. The gentlemai
under review was educated at the
Edinburgh High School, and at 18
years of age left his native land for
Victoria, after arrival accepting
clerical position with Mr. Rober;
Mcllardy, who had been his ship
mate from Scotland and who
established himself as a roadmaking
contractor at Geelong. Mr. Walker
was soon admitted into partnership
in the business, and subsequently
upon the retirement of Mr. Mcllardy
took over the plant and continuec
operations, gradually, however, giv-
ing his attention almost exclusively
to the carrying trade between
Geelong and Ballarat at the time of
the early goldmining boom in the
latter district, when £4O to £5O per
ton was the ordinary charge for
cartage. Eventually, being keen on
adventure, he undertook the hazard-
ous duties of gold-buyer on behalf
of the Bank of Victoria, a position
fraught with considerable excite-
ment, no hour of his life being
passed without risk of falling in with
rapacious outlaws, when, armed
though he always was, his life would
have been of small value. In the
discharge of his duties he had always
to carry a large quantity of money
or of the precious metal itself, and
this being before the era of escorts,
on one occasion he travelled with the
notorious Captain Melville, who with
his band of men had been outlawed
some time previously. Mr. Walker
from a generous impulse rendered
the Captain some service, which
stirred the romantic spirit of this
“gentleman of the road,” who gave
practical evidence of his gratitude
by henceforward making it his
business to see that his benefactor
was free from molestation not only by
his personal followers but also by all
the highwaymen of the colony to
whom Mr. Walker became known.
At a later stage in his career Mr.
Walker purchased a share in a sheep
station named “Cargarie,” near
Meredith, but this venture proved a
failure, and after losing all the cap-
ital which he had accumulated he set
his face towards New Zealand, where
he was offered the management
of a station by the well-known
firm of Messrs. Fenwick Brothers,
pastoralists, and became a familiar
figure among his fellow-administra-
tors of station properties in the
Dominion. In 1863 he returned to
Victoria, and a few months later
revisited the home of his fathers, on
which occasion he not only saw many
of his old friends but also took the
opportunity of acquainting himself
with those places of historic interest
which hitherto had been only names
to him. Eleven years in the free,
untrammelled spaces of the land of
the Southern Cross, however, had
unfitted him for any other life, and
in 1865, obeying the strong call
which Australians know so well, he
again crossed the seas, and soon

found scope for his ability as man-
ager of a cotton plantation on
behalf of Captain Robert Towns,
afterwards the Hon. Robert Towns,
in which after five years’ successful
administration he obtained a part-
nership, and subsequent to the
decease of the above-mentioned
gentleman purchased the sole inte-
rest in the property, where he still
resides. Eventually Mr. Walker gave
up cotton-growing, and devoted his
attention to the timber and saw-
milling industry, in which he con-
tinued for about 20 years, when he
perceived the great future ahead of
scientific dairying in Queensland,
and became the pioneer of the
advanced methods in this line of
enterprise in the Logan district.
Later he disposed of portions of his
estate, setting the example quickly
followed by surrounding settlers of
cutting up his property into blocks
for purposes of closer settlement,
and at the present time the original
area of “Townsvale” supports some
20 to 30 families. About six years
ago he sold all the remaining land
with the exception of about 100
acres surrounding the homestead,
where he now lives in retirement,
his connection with the district
extending over half a century. Mr.
Walker has taken a keen interest
in the public affairs of the district,
and was one of the earliest members
of the Beaudesert Shire Council, in
which he retained his seat for 25
years consecutively, filling the post
of chairman for seven successive
years. He was the most prominent
worker in connection with the move-
ment to secure railway facilities for
the neighbourhood, which owes him
much in this respect; and took a
leading part in the establishment of
the Logan and Albert Dairy Com-
pany, of which he was the first chair-
man. He was also a founder and
strong supporter of the Logan and
Albert Turf Ch;b; and is widely
known in the district as one of those
reliable characters who shed lustre
on the name of the pioneer, many
unobtrusive acts of charity making
him honoured and beloved even
beyond his own circle of friends and
acquaintances. After a life of nearly
four score years, he looks back with
satisfaction over the long vista of
the past, which with all its lights
and shadows has proved a journey
of more than ordinary interest, and
sometimes he is tempted to take up
the pen of the free lance journalist,
which he wielded successfully for a
time in the early days of Bendigo,
and make some record for future
generations of the more romantic
incidents of his career. Mr. Walker
married in 1866 Mrs. Elliott, widow
of the late Captain Elliott. Of this
union there is issue two daughters
and two sons, the latter being settled
on farming properties adjoining the
old home estate.
JOSEPH HOPKINS, “Wood-
lands,” Veresdale, was born at
Woodhill, Queensland, on Febru-
ary 29, 1872, and is a son of Mr.
John Hopkins, who now (1915)
closely approaching fourscore years
of age, lives in well-earned retire-
ment at Brisbane. This veteran
pioneer came from Aberdeen, Scot-
land, over half a century ago,
and being a skilled millwright


by trade soon found scope for
his energies of hand and brain
in the partially-formed settlements
of his adopted country. The struc-
tures which he erected have now
mostly given place to buildings of
more modern design, but in their
day they were important indications
of the substantial progress which
was being made by the handful of
settlers and others who represented
the scanty population of Moreton
Bay and a few outlying districts.
Mr. Hopkins, sen., chose for his
helpmeet the late Ellen Kelly, a
native of the Emerald Isle, who came
to Queensland shortly after her
future husband, whom she joined at
Dalby, where their marriage was
one of the first to be celebrated at
that centre. Mrs. Hopkins died in
1889, leaving a family of three sons
and six daughters. The gentleman
under review, Mr. Joseph Hopkins,
received his education at the Wood-
hill State School, which he left soon
after entering his teens. Even at
that early age he had qualified by
examination to fill the position of
pupil teacher, but waived his own
wishes in respect to a career in
.recognition of the stern necessity
which presented itself to assist his
father in making a livelihood for the
large family. Accordingly at 14 he

obtained a poeition at the Towns-
vale Mill, in the employ of Mr.
W. T. Walker, whose just and
upright character provoked the ad-
miration and respect of his youthful
employe, who strove to model his
own conduct upon the example thus
constantly set before him. He re-
mained at the mill for some four
years, and while still in his minority

cast covetous eyes upon a "parcel of
land,” which he was able to purchase
on easy terms from his employer,
who aided him with the best of
advice and assistance. By applying
himself with untiring industry to
the development of hie new property
as a dairying proposition he was
able shortly to clear himself of hie
liabilities, and was soon on the high
road to prosperity. Eventually he
found himself in a position to
purchase other holdings in the vicin-
ity of his homestead block, and little
by little his acreage increased, until
to-day he is proprietor of about
1,000 acres of good pastoral land in
a rapidly-growing district. Mr. Hop-
kins has devoted his time and
attention almost exclusively to the
dairying industry, and has met with
a success as unqualified as it is
deserved. A certain amount of
cropping is resorted to for the pur-
pose of providing the herd with
necessary fodder, but the pastures
with their excellent natural grasses
are principally kept for the use of
the browsing kine. Having spent
the whole of his mature life in this
district, Mr. Hopkins naturally
takes the keenest interest in its
advancement, and from his youth
upwards has been a prominent figure
in local organizations and public
movements set afoot to further some
scheme for the benefit of the com-
munity at large. For some years
past he has occupied a seat on the
Beaudesert Shire Council, represent-
ing the ratepayers of the division in
which he resides, and having the
turn of mind which predisposes to
the discussion of political matters,
he holds membership in the
Woodhill branch of the
Farmers’ Union, being a
regular attendant at the
periodical meetings of that
body. For the lengthy
period of 16 years he has
dischax'ged the duties of
secretary to the local school
of arts in an honorary
capacity, and has shown
his interest in educational
matters by a six-year con-
nection with the Woodhill
State School Board. He
is fond of manly sport of
a clean and legitimate
nature, and follows racing
events with a considerable
amount of interest. For
20 years he has held the
hon. secretaryship of the
Woodhill Jockey Club, and
as a consequence is re-
garded as one of the lead-
ing supporters of the turf
in Yeresdale. Mr. Hopkins
married in 1899 Lillie,
daughter of Mr. William Everdell,
of Woodhill, one of the oldest
families in the district, and has a
family of two sons and two
daughters.


JOSEPH HENRY CAVELL,
"Rose Hill,” Woodhill, on the
Beaudesert railway line, was born
on the spot where he now resides
with his aged mother on January 21,
1879, and is the youngest son of the
late Edwin Cavell, who came with
his wife to Queensland by the sailing
ship “Persia” when 24 years of age.
The late Edwin Cavell hailed from
Somersetshire, the county which
had witnessed the upspringing of
generation after generation of
Cavells, who had been associated
with various avocations in the march
of the centuries. Upon arrival in
the young colony with a number of
others who eventually were enrolled
on the list of Queensland pioneers,
MR. EDWIN CAVELL.
the young couple faced the problem
of making a livelihood under condi-
tions vastly different from those
under which their earlier days had
been spent. The climate alone
altered the whole outlook on life,
and the young Britisher realized
this very fully with his first taste
of the real, strenuous work of the
bush in the shape of burning off
scrub and clearing land for agricul-
tural purposes at Bald Hills, near
Brisbane. Later he saw thriving
small farms covering this locality,
which his labours had helped to
prepare for occupation: and these
in their turn gave place to the
streets and rows of houses of
a suburban township. Meeting
with the late Mr. John Collins,
he accepted a position on his
building staff for the erection of a
house at “Mundoolun,” and whilst
thus engaged was fortunate enough
to gain the goodwill of the Collins
family, who induced him to remain
with them in a permanent post.
Subsequently Mr. Cavell removed to
Cooper Plains, and turned his atten-
tion to the timber-getting industry
and farming pursuits for a time.
During this period he saved enough
money to invest in a team of bul-
locks, and had the distinction of
being the first settler in the district
to make such a purchase, the pos-
session of which carried with it a
prestige readily understood by those
who were engaged in the early
struggle to establish themselves on
Queensland soil. A rush to the
Jimbour district, where a find of
gold was reported, drew a big follow-
ing, and Mr. Cavell utilized his
team for the purpose of carting
stores for the prospectors, his being
one of the first heavy teams to cross
the ranges. Upon returning from
this trip he was engaged in the
timber-getting industry at Jim-
boomba for a brief period, and
finally in 1879 took up the holding
of 80 acres at Woodhill, which has
since been enlarged to the present
farm of 1,000 acres, known as
"Rose Hill,” where the late Mr.
Cavell resided until the time of his
demise. During his lifetime he
devoted all his energies to the
development of this property, and
acquired additional acreage, until in
time he had brought the holding up
to half its present size, and carried
on mixed-farming pursuits with a
good measure of success. He was
well loved by the community of
which he formed a part, and made
himself useful in various public
capacities, taking a prominent part
in the establishment of the first local

primary school, to which he became
honorary treasurer and committee-
man. He was also a trustee of the
Methodist Church, and one of the
pillars of the connexion in this
neighbourhood. At his death he
left a widow, Ann, daughter of the
late Elijah Treloggen, of Somerset-
shire, and three sons and three
daughters, most of whom were born

and brought up on the farm, and
who are now all settled on the land
in the Logan district. The youngest
son, Joseph Henry Cavell, who
administers the estate of “Rose
Hill,” was educated at the Wood-
hill State School, and on the termi-
nation of his scholastic course joined
his father in the working of the
holding, while the elder sons took up
homes of their own. Upon the
death of his parent he continued to
conduct affairs, and follows closely
on the lines laid down by the late
Mr. Cavell, special attention being
given to the dairying industry. He
is a trustee of tlie Methodist Church,
and in every respect upholds the
reputation for steady and upright
Hying so worthily established by
his father.


WILLIAM HENRY HARRI-
SON, “Broomfield,” Cedar Grove,
was born on the Mclvor gold dig-
gings, in Victoria, on September 3,
1861, and is the second son of the late
George Harrison, who settled in the
Logan district of Queensland in the
early sixties. The late Mr. Harrison
was a native of Armagh, Ireland,
and like many of the Celts of the
period, had his imagination kindled
and his adventurous nature stirred
by the visions conjured up by
travellers of the free, wide land
across the Indian and Southern
Oceans, where fortunes were made
in a day on the goldfields, and great
expanses of stock country lay wait-
ing for man to populate with flocks
and herds, which should line hie
pockets with gold. Desiring the best
of everything for the young wife
who had recently consented to share
his lot, within a year of his wedding
day he set sail with his bride for the
new land of promise, his wife giving
birth at sea to a son. The late
George Harrison landed in Victoria
in 1859—the year that Queensland
was proclaimed a separate colony—
and shortly afterwards became a
pioneer citizen of the newly-pro-
claimed northern colony, where for
many years he was identified with the
timber industry, being one of the
most strenuous workers in the dense
forest areas of country, hitherto
almost untouched by the hand of
timber-getters. As his exertions
were crowned with prosperity, he

extensive pastures a necessity, and
gave Mr. Harrison the solid status of
a successful grazier and stock-
breeder. By the close of 15 years he

had placed far behind him all the
slavery of his new-chum days, and
having settled down at Cedar Grove,
near Jimboomba, lived out the
remainder of his life in that district,
honoured, beloved, and respected by
all his fellow-pioneers, and the
younger members of a community
which was already binding itself
Henry Harrison, who resides on the
old paternal property, is the second
son. As a child Mr. Harrison
attended the Woodhill State School,
a few miles distant from his present
home, and upon the termination of
his studies assisted his father in the
timber industry until his marriage
at 28 years of age. In 1888 he struck
out for himself, taking up a holding
in the near vicinity of the paternal
acres, which he immediately began
to develop in his spare time, procur-
ing the wherewithal to support his
home before the land began to
produce by timber-getting, which
was a fairly lucrative occupation.
Eventually Mr. Harrison followed
the trend of the time by giving his
attention almost exclusively to dairy-
ing enterprise. Since that period
he has largely increased the area of
his property, and unites grazing and
stock-raising with his dairying opera-
tions. Mr. Harrison has found scope
for activities outside the realm
of his own personal enterprise
in the advancement of public
interests in the district, and some
years back was returned by the
ratepayers of his division to repre-
sent then on the Beaudesert
Shire Council. He is also associated
as a committeeman with most of the
local organizations, notably the
agricultural society and school board.
Mr. Harrison was married in 1888 to
Bertha, daughter of the late John
Anders, one of the old residents of
Jimboomba, and has a family of one

was able to improve his position by
occupying a rented property, upon
which he grazed a few cattle which
he had purchased; and this proved
the nucleus of the large and valuable

and well-being. The late Mr. Har-

bourhood.


WILLIAM JAMES BARNES,
J.P., “Midstream,” Cedar Grove,
was born at Cooper Plains on Novem-
ber 5, 1866. He is the eldest son of
the late James Barnes, who landed at
MR. JAMES BARNES.
Brisbane from the ship “Flying
Cloud,” in the latter part of the
year 1863, and subsequently engaged
in rural occupations among the
earliest of the pioneer farmers at
Oxley Creek. Mr. James Barnes was
well qualified to take upon himself
the responsibilities incurred by
early settlement on the land, having
sprung from sound old Celtic yeo-
man stock which boasted itself
strong in limb and of tempered con-
stitution. While quite young he
had taken to wife Nanny Dennis,
of the young country, reports of
which were spreading through the
over-populated districts of Great
Britain. Whilst getting a grip
of the conditions under which he
trusted eventually to make his way
to affluence, James Barnes under-
took employment at a regular wage,
by which means he was able to
maintain himself and his wife until
the opportunity for which he kept a
keen look-out should occur. Less than
two years from the date of his arrival
he found himself in a position to
select on the Eight-Mile Plains a
farm of 160 acres, which in those
days was considered a fair area on
which to begin operations. During
the period that must necessarily
elapse before the preparatory work
could be completed and the farm be
made productive, Mr. Barnes sup-
plemented his income by under-
taking work in connection with the
construction of public roads on
behalf of the Government. This, in
conjunction with many other of the
early settlers, he continued for some
years, and when the administration
of the roads passed into the hands
of the local governing body he found
his services still very much in request
for the same class of work on a
contract basis. In course of time
Mr. Barnes decided to dispose of his
original holding, and to take up a
property in the Logan and Albert
district. Accordingly, when the
“Mundoolun” Station area was
thrown open for closer settlement he
made choice of a block of land, and
settled down to farming pursuits.
On this property, which is now
were erected in the district, thereby
promoting its prosperity in a very
marked manner, and this industry
provided an avenue of employment
for his sons, three out of four of

whom were engaged for a lengthy
period in timber-cutting for the
supply of the mills. Still later the
various members of the family
removed to homes of their own in
different parts of the State, only the
youngest son, Mr. George Frederick
Barnes, remaining in the old home-
stead. The founder of the family in
Queensland passed away on July 20,
1908. James Barnes was possessed
of considerable public spirit, and for
many years took a prominent part

known as “Flagstone Creek/' he
met with considerable success in
dairying, being assisted by his
family, which was growing up round
him. As years went on, timber mills
in the general affairs of the district.
He served for a lengthy period as
a member of the Tambourine Shire
Council, and was amongst the most
influential committeemen of the


Logan and Albert Agricultural and
Pastoral Society. The gentleman
whose career forms the subject of
this article, Mr. William James
Barnes, was far from enjoying the
educational facilities equal to those
now open to every child of the State.
For some years he tramped six miles
daily to the Tambourine State
School at such seasons as he could
be spai'ed from the pressure of work
on the paternal farm, and in this
way became conversant with the
"three R’s” and a few other
branches of learning as imparted in
those early days. Before reaching his
teens, however, by the force of
circumstances he was compelled to
relinquish study and give his help
in the way of practical work for the
maintenance of the family. At 13
he was sufficiently experienced to be
entrusted with the driving of a team
of bullocks, and was employed in
timber-carting by his maternal
uncle. His time was occupied in
this kind of work until he reached his
twentieth year, and some time later
he rejoined his father, and applied
his best energies to help build up the
family fortunes by cutting and
carting timber for the mills. With
his brothers he left no stone
unturned towards the attainment of
an independent position, and so
finely did the young Australians
prove their fibre that, smiled upon
by Fate, they achieved this desirable
object, and proved themselves
well worthy of the name they bore
and the stock from which they had
was the only satisfactory road
towards the gaining of a compe-
tency. In this way they maintained
and helped to realize the ideal set
before them by their father, who by
his own example had given force to
the precepts which he enjoined upon

his sons from time to time. When
only 18 years of age Mr. W. J.
Barnes availed himself of an oppor-
tunity to select a block of land at
Maclean, which he still owns; but
when at 27 he married and formed
his own home his choice of locality
fell on the "Jimboomba” Estate,
where he secured a selection and
built a homestead about a mile
distant from his present residence.
By degrees he added to his posses-
sions, and in 1907 purchased the
property originally owned by the
late Charles Baker, which in con-
junction with the other areas which
he has acquired from time to time
pastured on the home paddocks.
Operations in connection with this
branch of industry are in the hands
of various members of Mr. Barnes’s
family, who have made a thorough
success of their work. His personal
attention, apart from timber-getting
in the virgin forest, to which
occupation he has given the greater
part of his life, has been applied to
the following up of a hobby of his
boyhood days, viz., the making of a
close study of the different classes of
dairy stock and the varying condi-
tions under which one or another
type may reasonably be expected to
produce the best results. With the
object of eventually building up a
model stud herd, he has sought
information from every possible
quarter, and has made practical
experiments with a view to enlarg-
ing his knowledge of the subject,

sprung. Henceforward none of the
family worked for an employer,
having discovered that the bolder
policy 5 of independent enterprise,
though at times attended with risks,
has brought the landed area under
his proprietorship up to a total of
over 3,000 acres. A large portion of
this estate is used for grazing pur-
poses, and a fine dairy herd is
study, and experiment has been his
present personal conviction that the
stud which he inaugurated some five
years ago, composed of pure Jerseys,
is the best for dairy purposes under


the sy s tem of dairy-farming on
small holdings. Mr. Barnes began
this stud with a bull from the
Orassmere herd, and cows from
William Siemon & Sons’ “Prospect”
“YOUNG HOUSEMAID,”
Jersey Herd, at Walloon, and
by introducing members of other
families of the same pure stock he
has demonstrated on his own estate,
and at various country shows, the
success of his methods. The bull
now in use at “Midstream” is
“Lotina’s Noble II.,” bred by Miss
S. L. Robinson, of Victoria, an
animal of exceptional value imported
to Queensland by Mr. Barnes in
1915. This bull is only two removes
from the valuable “Noble of Oak-
lands,” winner of first prize at
St. Saviour’s Show of 1907, and of
first prize when shown with his pro-
geny at the R.A.S.E. shows, and was
afterwards sold to go to America for
£1,400. Mr. Barnes’s “Lotina’s
Noble II.” therefore has sprung
from an illustrious line, and as far
as breeding is concerned is unsur-
passed by any other bull in the
Commonwealth. The cow which
takes pride of place in the “Mill-
stream” herd is “Young House-
maid,” another animal of quality,
whose pedigree, with that of
“Lotina’s Noble II.”, is given in
full on the adjoining page. The
standard thus set is maintained
throughout the whole stud, the dif-
ferent members of which are all
registered both in the Herd Book
of the State and in the Common-
wealth Standard Herd Book, in
which, as is well known to all
breeders, the pedigree of every
beast must run back pure bred prior
to 1888. The greatest possible credit
is due to Mr. Barnes for the steady
concentration which he has brought
to bear upon his self-appointed task,
and it may be averred with truth
that if every breeder took the same
personal interest in the improve-
ment of the standard of his herd, the
average merit of the cattle of
"LOTINA'S NOBLE II.”
Queensland would be materially
raised within a very short period.
Like his father before him, Mr.
Barnes has always manifested an
active interest in the affairs of his
district, and for several years gave
very earnest attention to the matter
of local government as a member of
the Beaudesert Shir© Council. For
the past decade he has served as
committeeman of the Logan and
Albert Agricultural and Pastoral
Society; was one of the directors of
the Logan and Albert Co-operative
Hairy Company for some years; and
has also acted as chairman to the
local school committee. He takes a
leading part in the Methodist
Church, with which his family has
been connected for many generations
in the Old Country, and occupies the
position of trustee to the local
church, in which he also combines
the offices of treasurer and secretary
in an honorary capacity. He was
created a Justice of the Peace by
the Denham Administration some
years ago. Mr. Barnes married in
1893 Amelia Jane, daughter of the
late Edwin Cavell, also a pioneer of
the Logan and Albert district, -who
was engaged in the timber-getting
and dairying industries at Woodhill
for nearly half a century. He was
on© of the first to embark on pine-
wood cutting in order to meet the
demand which had arisen for this
class of timber in Queensland, the
pine logs being rafted down the
Logan River, and thence across the
bay to Brisbane. Mr. Cavell, who
was highly respected in the district,
died on April 22, 1905 at the ave
of 68 years, leaving a family of three
sons and three daughters. ‘Mr and
Mrs. Barnes have nine children—
three daughters and six sons.

Stephen Champney attended school
in his native village for a few years,
and subsequently became his father’s
right hand on the farm of few but
rich acres which was devoted to
intense culture and the dairying
industry. At the age of 23 the desire
arose in Mr. Champney to do some-
thing bigger, and with the concur-
rence of his young wife he decided
to emigrate to Queensland. The
young couple accordingly sailed by
the “Bulimba,” and arrived at
Brisbane on March 25, 1886, their
two small children completing the
family party. Mr. Champney took
the first employment that offered,
that of assistant slaughterman to
the Graziers’ Butchering Company,
which post he held until more
lucrative work came to hand in the
shape of road-making on behalf of
the South Brisbane Council. At the
end of two years he had thoroughly
found his bearings, and was able to
carry out his original intention of set-
tling on the land. As a preliminary

he leased a small property at
Mount Gravatt, but from a variety of
causes the venture proved a failure.
Having lost the whole of his modest
capital Mr. Champney was com-
pelled again to seek employment,
and being in some measure dis-
couraged by the failure of his efforts
in Queensland, he accepted a posi-
tion offered him by the Sydney City
Council, and removed with his
family to New South Wales.
Eventually he became a pawn
in the game of the Bursted
Village Settlement Scheme, pro-
moted by the New South Wales
Government, and once more worsted
by fate, in the closing months of
the year 1893 he returned to Queens-
land. About this time the Jim-
boomba Timber Reserve was thrown
open by the Government for closer
settlement, and Mr. Champney
seized the opportunity to make
another start in the direction
of dairy-farming on his own account.

Taking up his present holding, he
began operations on a limited area,

OTTO JULIUS HERMAN
KRUGER, J.P., "Chelmsford,”
Cedar Grove, Beaudesert line, was
born at Alberton, in the Beenleigh
district of Queensland, on Decem-
ber 20, 1866, and is a son of the
late Christian Kruger, a Queens-
land pioneer who hailed from south-
ern Germany. Mr. Kruger was one
of those brought out as emigrants
by the late Rev. G. H. Hausman,
grandfather of the Hon. J. G.
Appel, and almost immediately after
arrival he settled near Beenleigh.
Here he set to work to carve a
home for himself out of the
virgin bush. A serious drawback
was the lack of supplies, and the
settlers had to walk a distance of
between 40 and 50 miles to procure
the necessaries of life. When the
young crops were put in and the
green blades began to appear above
the ground ceaseless watch had to
be kept on account of the kangaroos,
and it was nothing exceptional to
see thousands of these marsupials
in the district. To save the crops
the late Mr. Kruger was accus-
tomed to sit half the night to keep
watch, his wife then taking his place
and continuing the vigil until dawn.
The native blacks were numerous,
but friendly with those who
were kind to them, bringing
wild honey in return for bread
and tobacco. The late Chris-
tian Kruger died at Fairfield, near
Brisbane, about the year 1890,
during his life having set an
example of thrift and industry, and
of age became a scholar at the
Mount Gravatt State School, his
father having removed with his
family to this district. Upon reach-
ing his teens he put his schooldays
MR. OTTO J. H. KRUGER.
behind him, the need becoming
imperative that as the only surviving
son of his parents he should put his
shoulder to the wheel to aid in the
maintenance of the household. His
first years of active life were spent
in farm duties at Mount Gravatt,
but at 20 he left for Brisbane,
where he obtained a position in the
English, Scottish, and Australian
Produce Company’s stores, subse-
quently being admitted as a clerk
and selecting the property upon
which he afterwards erected his pre-
sent homestead, he began operations
with the intent and determination
to succeed. By dint of strenuous
toil he soon gained a footing,
and to eke out his slender
capital accepted employment on the
holdings of surrounding settlers,
which enabled him to maintain his
family while his own proposition
was being built up. The original
area of the farm was 160 acres, but
during the 18 years that Mr. Kruger
has remained in occupation he has
steadily increased his landed pro-
perty, and to-day is the proprietor
of nearly 1,000 acres. Dairying
absorbs almost all the activities of
the farm, and a large herd is pas-
tured, the nutritious natural grasses
being augmented by hand-feeding
when necessary. Mr. Kruger takes
a deep interest in local affairs of a
public nature, and acts as honorary
secretary to the school board, an
office he has held ever since its
inception 20 years ago. Since the
inauguration of the Co-operative
Dip Company, in 1900, he has
served as its honorary secretary; and
he is also secretary of the Cedar
Yale Methodist Church. He was
prominent in the promotion of the
Beaudesert hospital scheme, and in
addition to all his other interests
he is a Justice of the Peace, having
been appointed to this office by the
Denham Administration. Mr. Kruger
married in 1898 Frances, daughter
of Mr. Charles Jurd, an Australian

winning the respect of his neigh-
hours for his sterling qualities.
Mr. Otto Julius Herman Kruger
attended a German school for
two years, and at 10 years
into the office of this company,
where he remained for about six
years. In 1893 he resigned his post
with the intention of entering upon
farming pursuits on his own account,
pioneer of over half a century’s
standing, now engaged with his sons
in contracting work in the Beaude-
sert district, and has a family of
three sons and five daughters.


CHRISTOPHER THOMPSON,

boomba, was born at Guildford,
County Down, Ireland, on May 24,
1862, and is the second eon of the
MR. CHRISTOPHER THOMPSON.
late Christopher Thompson, who
emigrated from the Emerald Isle in
the year above mentioned, his desti-
nation being the island-continent of
Australia. Leaving his wife and
little ones behind him, the late
gentleman sought these far-off shores
with the object of building up a
home for those dependent upon him
under more favourable conditions
than were possible to obtain in the
Old Country,-and by dint of hard
work and many sacrifices was able
to provide the wherewithal for
bringing his family to his side
within the space of two years. He
first obtained employment on the
boats engaged in trading and lighter-
ing between Moreton Bay, Brisbane,
and Ipswich —the latter then being
the principal town in Queensland —
and continued in this work until
1868, by which time he had saved
sufficient capital to invest in a small
block of land. The holding, which
was situated at Greenvale, on the
Logan River, about four miles from
his present residence, comprised 45
acres, and was taken up in compli-
ance with the conditions of the first
Queensland Land Act, at a price of
2s. 6d. per acre, for eight years.
Here he built a small "humpy” in
which to shelter his family, and
began the pioneer life which, spite
its inevitable drawbacks and trials,
zz2
is now rich in happy memories. He
grew cotton at a period when this
industry was supported by a Govern-
ment bonus, and later when with
the withdrawal of the bonus the
enterprise waned, enlarged his
landed possessions by the acquire-
ment of three additional blocks of
considerable acreage, and estab-
lished himself in dairying and
grazing pursuits. The late Mr.
Thompson’s efforts were crowned
with gratifying success, and he died
in his eightieth year, respected and
esteemed as one of the worthy
pioneers whose labours have assisted
in the work of empire-building
throughout the young country of
Australia. He left a family of five
sons and one daughter. The son who
bore his name, Christopher Thomp-
son, whose career forms the subject
MR. CHRISTOPHER THOMPSON, JUN.
of this article, came to Queensland
with his mother when two years of
age, and received the rudiments of
education at schools in Brisbane and
Stockleigh. His studies were of a
desultory character, owing to the
lack of skilled instruction available,
and to the demand made upon even
young boys in the settlers’ families
to aid in the work of the farm or
holding. Long ere he reached his
teens, the youthful colonist shoul-
dered his share of the responsibility
in this respect, and continued on the
home selection until 20 years of age.
He then started timber-getting on
his own account, and having saved
enough money to purchase a team
of bullocks, followed this line of
occupation for nearly a decade, when
an accident occurred, which caused
him to turn his attention to other
means of livelihood. Whilst work-
ing in the timber industry he pur-
chased a farm of 62 acres, and
eventually settled down to develop
this property, which in course of
time he increased to over 200 acres
in the immediate vicinity of the
homestead, and in addition took up
a quantity of land in the same
district, until to-day he owns an
estate of over 2,000 acres. This he
devotes to dairying and grazing on
a fairly extensive scale, and has
secured good results in return for his
endeavours, being looked upon as
one of the leading men in these
industries in the district. Mr.
Thompson takes a deep interest in
the affairs of the community of
which he forms a unit, and has
devoted a share of his time to those
public duties which naturally fall to
those who have big interests at
stake. For six years he served as a
member of the Tambourine Shire
Council, and was connected with the
local school board for a very lengthy
.period. He has been prominently
associated with sporting events in
the district, acting in the capacity
of honorary judge to the race club
on many occasions. He married in
1888 Elizabeth, daughter of the late
James Wearing, another of the
hardy pioneers of British descent

country for agriculture and other
industries. His family consists of
one son and two daughters.


THOMAS STRACHAN, J.P.,
Jimboomba, Logan district, was
born on June 22, 1849, at Torquay,
England, and is the only son of the
late Lewis Strachan, a name well
known for close on 15 years in the
Logan country, of which he was a
resident at the time of his demise.
Lewis Strachan had spent the best

years of his manhood under northern
skies, and not until be reached the
age of 57 did he seriously give his
attention to forsaking the land of his
birth for a country of bluer skies,
with nights made radiant with light
from the constellation of the South-
ern Cross. The death of his wife
some years earlier was a severe blow,
from which he found it difficult to
recover, and with the object of
finding some distraction he at length
took passages for himself and his only
son by the well-remembered sailing
vessel “Fiery Star,’’ bound for
Queensland, the date of her depar-
ture being August 6, 1863. Lewis
Strachan came of a long line of
Scottish landowners, his father being
Andrew Strachan, of Kincardine-
O’Neil, one of the historic villages
of the Lowlands. He was brought
up to the profession of civil engineer,
and records are extant of his asso-
ciation with the famous Griffiths
National Survey of Ireland; while
for a time he was prominent in the
valuation and purchase of the
notable old Irish intestate estates,
lie was brought into close touch with
that section of the British aristoc-
racy who during the first and second
decades of the nineteenth century
were engaged in transferring their
domiciles from England to the
Emerald Isle, in his role of commis-
sioner making many important trans-
fers of property. Many changes and
some reverses of fortune were
experienced by Mr. Strachan, but
these did not deter him from making
a final tilt for the fickle goddess’s
smile; and when on November 20,
1863, he set foot on the shores of
Australia it was with the determi-
nation to write his name among
those of the intrepid pioneers whose
services in opening up the different
country districts of Queensland have
been of a value past computing.
Immediately after arrival he took
up land at Waterford, and for
some years worked strenuously to
obtain results in the face of condi-
tions of which he had to gain an
acquaintance through painful experi-
ence. He came through the
disastrous year of 1866, when
financial distress on account of the
severe drought was prevalent; and
pioneered the cotton industry in the
Logan district, removing first to
Quinsey Flat, and later to Tam-
bourine, where he considered the
country more favourable to the
culture of this crop. When the
“Jimboomba” Station area was cut
up for closer settlement Mr. Lewis
Strachan selected on the creek, near
the old homestead —which stream
has since become a geographical
landmark bearing his name —a hold-
ing which for the few remaining years
of his life he devoted his energies to
developing as a mixed-farming pro-
position, and where his death
occurred in 1877. His son, Mr.
Thomas Strachan, who succeeded to
the property, and who still resides
thereon, was 14 years of age when
he came with his father to Queens-
land, having been brought up in
County Mayo, at Castletown, near
Cong, on the bank of Lough Corrib,
in Ireland. He completed his educa-
tion, which was received chiefly at
Hemel Hempstead, in Hertfordshire,
England, before sailing for Aus-
tralia, and was closely associated
with his father during the earlier
years of their life on the Waterford
farm. Soon after the outbreak of
the Gympie goldfield the young
jiioneer joined the rush to the region
of enchantment, and spent a couple
of years in digging and delving for
the precious metal. Spite of its
hardships he derived unlimited
enjoyment out of thus playing the
game of life among the hardy and
fearless men who were making his-
tory in the gold-mining industry of
the State, and had the good fortune
to be among the favoured few who
succeeded in winning from the
auriferous brown earth sufficient of
her treasure to enable him to seek
his Logan home again when the two
years had expired. As soon as his
father settled at Jimboomba, Mr.
Thomas Strachan returned to the
paternal roof-tree, and during the
following few years succeeded in
establishing himself as a prominent
citizen of his adopted country. This
he achieved by sheer force of per-
sonality, without the aid of influen-
tial friends or any extraneous
assistance, his capacity for steady
work and the fine spirit in which he
entered upon all undertakings,
private and public, gaining him
MR. THOMAS STRACHAN.
universal respect and affection. For
nearly half a century he has resided
in the Logan district, and has built
up a cosy, well-developed farm,
where dairying and grazing are the
principal departments of industry,
its position, only a mile distant from
the Jimboomba railway station,
being greatly in its favour. Not


long after the death of his father
Mr. Strachan began to interest him-
self in the public affairs of the
district, and followed up with keen
attention every effort made for its
advancement. It was not until
1889, however, that he became an
active participant in the responsi-
bilities incurred by acceptance of
official duties on behalf of the rate-
payers. In that year he was elected
to a seat on the Tabragalba
Divisional Board, and in the fol-
lowing year, when Tambourine was
gazetted as a separate board, his
State school in Jimboomba, serving
as honorary secretary and committee-
man on the school board for some
considerable time. For many years
he occupied the post of local return-
ing officer in connection with the
State Parliamentary elections; and
his Commission of the Peace has
extended over a lengthy period,
being granted by an administration
in power over 25 years ago. Of a
retiring disposition, Mr. Strachan
has ever sought to serve his fellows
without ostentation, and advertise-
ment of his charitable deeds is
conversant with the trend of ideas in
the age in which he lives, and is
able to sustain his interest in very
many subjects outside the sphere T
his ordinary avocations, which keep
him in the main very busily
employed. Mr. Strachan married in
1897 Elizabeth, daughter of Mr.
Charles Jurd, one of the sturdy
pioneers of British birth who came
to Queensland in the early days of
settlement, and has spent over 50
years in this State and in New
South Wales, being still vigorously
engaged in conjunction with his sons

continued without a break as a
member of the Tambourine Shire

uZ every occasion. For sixyea-
of this period he has presided over
the meetings as chairman, and has
done useful work in this capacity.
He has interested himself in the

was one of the promoters of the first

more pleasure than any other means
of _ recreation. His library is his
chief hobby, and his range of
authors is a wide one, writers on
botany, geology, and other sciences
finding in him an intelligent and
appreciative reader. By means of
filling many spare moments among
his books, and thus assimilating the
thoughts and information of other
minds, he keeps himself thoroughly
in carrying contract work in the
Beaudesert district. Mr. and Mrs.

re-establish England’s greatness in
other climes these ruddy farmers
from Gloucestershire and other
counties of England could hardly
be outclassed. Stalwart and robust
in type, fearless and independent in
character, and possessing the invalu-
able knowledge of how to make the
earth yield her increase in response
to the invitation of man, as settlers
in a new country they filled a place
of the utmost importance. On the
other hand Australia could offer to
them much that would be for ever
denied so long as they remained in
the land of their fathers, and rested
content on the few acres which had
yielded a livelihood to many of their
race. Unlimited territory from which
to choose their holdings, liberal
land laws, and the opportunity to
rise to the highest positions in almost
any sphere, these advantages with
others offered much inducement to
men of ambition and energy to for-
sake the country of their birth and
start afresh where so much scope
and freedom were the order of the
day. Among such was numbered
James Wearing, who with his wife
and five children (one son and four
daughters) set sail by the barque
“Alexandrina” from London, arriv-
ing at Rockhampton, Queensland,
on December 6, 1873. His life was
prolonged for 20 years after his
advent to this country, and during
that period he achieved much
towards the aim which he had set
before him at the outset. In the
first instance, with the object of
becoming familiarized with the con-
ditions under which he would have
to work, with his son, then 16 years
of age, he obtained employment on
“Cryna” Estate, owned by the late
John Markwell. About 12 months
later, at the close of 1874, Mr.
Wearing selected the block of land
on which the homestead of “St.
Aldwyn’s” now stands, and taking
up his residence thereon with his
family, continued to devote the
remainder of his life to the develop-
ment and improvement of what has
proved a very valuable and highly
remunerative property. Of a retir-
ing, unassuming disposition, he was
content to live a blameless life,
setting an example of industry and
thrift whilst consistently pursuing
his object—that of securing a com-
petence and an assured position for
his family in the land of their adop-
tion j and on the roll of worthy
pioneers he has written an honoured
name in ineffacable characters. The
gentleman under review, Mr. Joseph
Wearing, received his education at

the present time he holds over 1,300
acres of fair grazing country, highly
suitable for the dairying enterprise
which is carried on on a fairly


extensive scale by him with the
co-operation of various members of
his family. Mr. Wearing is a
believer in the Ayrshire strain for
milking stock, experience having
taught him that this approved type
cannot be surpassed for this district.
He gives close attention to the
improvement of the breed, and with
this end in view in 1912 purchased
the pure-bred Ayrshire bull “Nether-
ton Prince Charlie,” imported from
Scotland for the St. Helena herd by
the Queensland Government. This
animal was born on March 27, 1909,
and is a fine-looking white bull, with
brown cheeks. He is by “Auchert-

Queensland Government expert for

1911, from Mr. W. Wallace,

America took everything before
him.” The comfortable and roomy
residence where Mr. Wearing lives
with his family is situated on the
bank of the Logan River. The
superior quality of the land as
grazing country is testified by the
fact that even in face of the
drought of 1915 the paddocks
were green. A record of a less
pleasing nature is registered in the
statement that for the first time in
40 years the Logan River ceased

has served on the school committee
for Stockleigh and North Maclean,
and occupied a seat for several years
on the council of Yeerongpilly Shire.
He is a cordial advocate of good,

own recreation chiefly in reading of
a general character. Mr. Wearing
married in 1885 Elizabeth, daughter
of the late Thomas Leonard, a

daughter of the late Edward Miller,

RICHARD TALBOT WYNNE,
Willowbrook” Farm, Maclean, via
Jimboomba, was born in the month
of August, 1851, his native place
being Mill Street, County Cork,
Ireland. He is a son of the late
Robert Bride Wynne, whose Celtic
blood was derived from a long line
of ancestors resident in the above-
mentioned county, many of whom
were engaged in the agricultural
MR. RICHARD TALBOT WYNNE.
industry. The late Mr. Wynne him-
self, although associated with the
Civil Service as postmaster at Mill
Street, was also a landowner on a
modest scale, and tilled his own
holding in Ireland prior to his
advent to Queensland. At a period
of assisted immigration, he came as
a full-paying passenger to this
State, in recognition of which he
received land orders for himself and
family, who accompanied him, and
in accordance with the conditions of
these concessions almost immediately
took up 160 acres of land, valued at
£1 per acre, the cost of which was
covered by the value of the orders,
which he presented as payment.
Settling on this block, which was the
nucleus of the present “Willow-
brook” Farm, he began its develop-
ment, the family at first being
sheltered only by a tent, which,
however, before long gave way to
the more substantial walls and roof
of a slab and bark “humpy” of the
type commonly used by settlers when
starting operations. The late Mr.
Wynne died in less than a year from
the time of his arrival in Queens-
land, leaving a widow and two
daughters still in their teens, who,
with Mr. Richard Talbot Wynne,
then a boy of 15, constituted the
entire family. There was very little
money at command, practically
none, as the father’s illness had
absorbed most of the little capital
with which they had started, and
shortly afterwards a cruel stroke of
fate occurred when the newly-
erected fences were all demolished
by a bush fire, which also played
havoc with other improvements, the
slab ‘ humpy” alone remaining as a
refuge for the stricken family. The
young son, now his mother’s chief
support, assumed the work of “man
of the house,” and put his shoulder
to the wheel with the determination
to succeed in the building up of the
proposition on the lines laid down
by his father. With this end in
view he toiled early and late, and as
the farm began to yield a little in
the way of marketable products,
he carted these the
whole distance of
twenty - five miles to
the metropolis in order
to dispose of them at
most profitable prices
When he became cap
able of doing a man’s
work for a man’s wage
he sought and obtained
employment on an ad-
joining station, and
for a considerable time
worked for the late
Mr. Henderson on the
old “Jimboomba” Sta-
tion, putting in all his
spare time in the im-
provement of the home
farm where his mother
continued to reside.
Having reached the
age of 30 he decided,
with what small sav-
ings he had been able
to put by, to throw
his whole heart and
soul into the develop-
ment of “Willow-
brook,” and as a
result of this forward
policy he soon found
himself in a position
to enlarge his acreage.
Gradually his bound-
aries pushed farther
and farther back, and
to-day he is the owner of a well-
developed property embracing some
3,000 acres, where grazing and
dairying pursuits are in full swing,
and every evidence of prosperity
abounds. Mr. Wynne is recognized
among experts as one of the keenest
and most reliable judges of equine
merit in the State, his knowledge of
horses, particularly of the staunch,
useful farm animal, being of a very
high order. As a breeder of this
class of stock for over a quarter of
a century he has established a sound
reputation, and the “Willowbrook”
horses are well known and in good
demand throughout the district.
Mr. Wynne married Ellen, daughter
of the late W. Slack, a pioneer of
the same district, and of this union
there are seven sons and two
daughters. Those of the sons not yet
established on farms of their own
are still assisting their father on the
home property, and both the daugh-
ters are married, one being the wife
of a farmer in Kingaroy, and the
other of Mr. James H. McCarthy,
who for many years has been the

of the oldest and best-respected
servants of the State, who spent
nearly half a century in the Queens-

WILLIAM WALSH, J.P.,
"Munster Vale,” Tambourine, was
born near Mallow, County Cork,
Ireland, on January 18, 1840, and
is the second son of the late William
Walsh, a yeoman farmer of that
county, and descendant of a long
line of the same name, who for
generations inhabited the County of
Tipperary, the late Mr. Walsh’s
father being the first member of
that branch of the family to settle
in County Cork. Mr. W. Walsh
was educated at the national
schools of Grange and Fermoy,
and at 15 years of age became
interested in the work of the home
farm. In conjunction with these
pursuits he also devoted a share of
his attention to the clerical side of
a new undertaking, viz., army con-
tracting, entered upon by his
MR. WILLIAM WALSH.
family upon the death of his
father. At 22 years of age Mr.
Walsh, with his mother and other
members of the home circle, decided
to tempt fortune in some one of
Britain’s overseas dominions, and
after mature consideration selected
Queensland. The party, consisting
of the widowed mother, three sons,
and a daughter, left Queenstown by
the ship “Prince Consort,” and after
a three months’ trip arrived at
Moreton Bay on November 2, 1862.
After landing Mr. Walsh struck out
for himself, taking up a block of
250 acres on Chambers Flat, in the
Logan district, known as “The
Rocks” Farm, which he purchased
from the Government of the day
at £1 per acre. In 1869 he
acquired an additional block of
100 acres at Tambourine, to which
lie has since added from time
to time as opportunity occurred.
The fine estate of 2,000 acres which
Mr. Walsh now owns is devoted to
grazing, dairying, and cultivation;

but it is interesting to note that
early in 1862 he was the first in the
Logan and Albert districts to culti-
vate with the plough, prior to that
date spade and hoe alone having
been used to till the soil. During
the half century and over that he
has carried on operations at “Mun-
ster Vale’—the name given to the
entire property—Mr. Walsh has
become one of the best-known
identities of the district. He has
been connected with local government

for nine years consecutively; and even
to-day (1915), though past his allotted
span of life, is a member of the Tam-
bourine Shire Council. He has
been chairman of the local school
committee for 35 years; and holds
one of the oldest Peace Commissions
in the State of Queensland, having
been gazetted about 1880. He has
been twice married, in 1868
espousing Catherine, daughter of the
late Edward Ryan, a pioneer hailing
from King’s County, Ireland, who
voyaged to Queensland by the “Erin-
go-Bragh” on her first trip. After
the death of his first wife, who left
three sons and one daughter, Mr.
Walsh went to North Queensland,
and spent some time in the Port
Douglas and Cooktown districts,
At an earlier period he had
"tried his luck” for a short time on
the Gympie goldfields, and now
visited the Palmer mines, but failing
to win any substantial reward for
his endeavours eventually returned
to farming as the most satisfactory
and surest road to fortune. Some
years later he married Margaret,
daughter of the late John Yore,
and of this union there are four
sons and six daughters.


Forests and Timber.
The value of Queensland’s timber assets have given
rise to very wide differences of opinion among people
holding interests directly and indirectly involved in
the forestry business. The administration of the depart-
ment has often led to sharp conflicts between the some-
times rival industries of agriculture and timber-getting;
the farmer desiring to see cleared away trees which lock
him from rich soil, whilst other considerations demand
that valuable forests should be preserved and wurked
in a manner which should insure a regular and per-
manent supply of woods of commercial value. And the
interests of the saw-millers frequently conflict with the
views of the responsible head of the Forestry Depart-
ment, the former being anxious to secure immediate
returns, whilst the duty of the latter leads him to
protect the future welfare of the trade.
Correct estimates of the total value of the State’ 3
forests are extremely difficult to arrive at. All the Aus-
tralian Governments have experienced trouble in securing
officials versed in the science of forestry, and the pro-
bable future extent of Queensland’s timber trade as
yet can only be guessed at. In 1915 there were 247
sawmills in the State, and the value of their output
was £1,458,420. There were 285 timber reserves with
a total area of 2,998,851 acres, and there were also
fifty-two State forests and national parks with a total
area of 1,003,733 acres. There are several sawmills
owned and conducted by the State. The commercial
timbers of Queensland include many varieties of soft-
woods, hardwoods, fancy woods suitable for furniture
making, and other varieties.
Until comparatively recent years the State forests
were managed with little regard to future requirements,
private interests being permitted to lead to the cutting
out of forests at a faster rate than the young trees
could grow. But this has since been rectified, a
well-defined policy now being followed. Under the
system being brought into force, the annual cut-
ting is not permitted to exceed the annual growth. If
the average time taken by the trees of a particular
forest to reach maturity should be twenty-five years,
then the area of that forest allowed to be denuded each
year does not exceed one-twenty-fifth of the whole. The
following figures show the quantities of different varie-
ties of Crown timber on which royalty was payable
during the year 1914, that period being chosen for
illustration because of being influenced to a lesser degree
by the abnormal conditions caused by the war than
were subsequent years (figures in parentheses denote the
quantities cut in the preceding year) : —Kauri pine,
1.652.000 superficial feet (1,630,000); cypress pine,
1.623.000 superficial feet (3,278,000); hoop and bunya
pine, 41,500,000 superficial feet (44,681,000); milling
hardwood, 11,050,000 superficial feet (14,858,000); red
cedar, 167,000 superficial feet (335,000); other milling
timber, 150,000 superficial feet (980,000) ; sleepers and
transoms, 863,000 pieces (951,500); piles, girders, etc.,
287,570 lineal feet (387,550); telegraph poles and house
blocks, 407,400 lineal feet (236,340); posts, rails, and
palings, 98,300 pieces (150,900); fuel, 40,000 tons
(52.000) mining timber and miscellaneous, 1,159,900
lineal feet (941,700); sandalwood, 550 tons (523); and
mangrove bark, 156 tons. The principal districts pro-
ducing hoop and bunya pine were Nanango with
13.740.000 feet (16,570,000), Gympie with 12,460,000
feet (10,100,000), and Ipswich with 9,870,000 feet
(9.200.000) while the quantities cut in Maryborough,
Gladstone, Brisbane, Toowoomba, and Bundaberg
showed decreases varying from 300,000 to 1,000,000
feet. The bulk of the hardwood logs milled in the
State was obtained on private lands, and consequently
in three districts only did the quantity of Crown hard-
wood removed exceed 1,000,000 feet, viz., Maryborough,
3.680.000 feet (5,160,000); Dalby, 1,605,000 feet
(1.235.000) and Brisbane, 1,245,000 feet (1,790,000).
Mining timber was disposed of mainly in Rockhampton
and Charters Towers, the only other districts con-
tributing in quantity being Cloncurry and Gladstone.
Under the heading “other milling timbers” are included
such excellent and highly-esteemed woods as silkwood
and red beech (maple), white beech, crow’s ash, yellow-
wood, and the various silky oaks. It is worthy of note
that the total quantity of timber of all these species
extracted was not more than would be yielded by 750
well-grown trees. Interest in red beech has been stimu-
lated by the decision of the Commonwealth defence
authorities that it is the most suitable Australian timber
for rifle stocks, and samples have been forwarded to the
Agent-General in London to be tested by the French
Government for the same purpose. There has been an
increased demand of late for yellow-wood, but, unfor-
tunately, the natural distribution of this tree is very
scattered, and the available quantity is comparatively
small.
During 1914 the collections on the sale of Crown
timber and the issue of licences amounted to £69,778


and £912 respectively, or a total of £70,690. Refunds
of guarantee deposits and excess payments on pre-
vious sales amounted to £897, leaving a total net
revenue from timber alone of £69,793. The year quoted,
though more normal than the period during the war,
gives but an approximate idea of the actual position,
for the industry was greatly hampered by drought.
Lack of rain led to a shortage of grass, which, in many
localities, prevented the timber-getters from using their
teams, and thus bringing the business to a temporary
stoppage. It is notable that £50,000, or 71 per cent.
of the total timber - revenue
derived in the State, was
collected in the districts
of Brisbane, Ipswich,
Gympie, Maryborough,
and Nanango; these dis-
tricts up to the present
being by far the most pro-
ductive, in spite of the
fact that they have yielded
the bulk of the timber
consumed by the saw-
milling trade since the
development of the State
commenced. For this rea-
son the department deemed
it advisable to concentrate
the attention of the small
staff of forest officers
mainly on the south-eastern
districts of the State rather
than attempt to deal with
districts too- extended and
lightly timbered to allow
of any effective work being
done. The above-mentioned
districts yielded 55 per
cent, of the total col-
lections in 1912, as com-
pared with 71 per cent,
in 1915, while in 1907
they yielded £9,300, as
compared with £50,000
in 1915. It is interesting to note that the ex-
penditure of this department for 1914 amounted
to only £7,416.
During the last few years exceptional difficulties
have arisen in developing the forest industry in the
north of the State, where favourable possibilities of
greatly extending the trade undoubtedly exist. Drought
was followed by the abnormal conditions produced by
the war. Otherwise, active steps would have been
taken towards the regeneration of northern reserves,
whilst considerable work would have been done towards
the establishment, ultimately, of valuable forests on
Fraser Island and other coastal lands of small indus-
trial value for purposes other than the jrroduction of
timber. The main difficulty to be contended with in
the north is common to tropical forests, consisting of
the abundance of tree-growth of no commercial value
and the comparative scarcity of the saleable trees.
The respective claims to new timber country of
forestry and agriculture are likely to cause contention
as long as both industries live. The view of almost
every settler is that if timber reserves are of sufficient
importance to be retained
at all they should be con-
fined to the poorest, rough-
est, and most inaccessible
country. Undoubtedly this
idea was acted on during
the first stages of the
State’s development, and
selectors secured at low
prices some of the most
heavily-timbered land in
the State. Indeed, the
price often was low because
of the presence of the
timber, which was regarded
as but adding to the
obstacles with which the
settler had to contend,
the cost of clearing adding
greatly to his preliminary
expenses. Tire best timber
was often burnt or other-
wise destroyed in whatever
way proved to be cheapest
and quickest. Timber re-
serves were then created
in places too inaccessible
to be of use to the
pioneering farmer; but
the subsequent construc-
tion of railways has
rendered transport to
these reserves easy and
cheap, so that the land thus set aside for timber
purposes is now desired for agriculture or dairying.
If the Government of the State give full play to this
tendency, all hope of developing the timber industry
into a profitable national asset must, of course, be
abolished.
Taking for a basis of calculation the figures obtain-
ing at the latter end of 1914, an enquiry into the extent
to which land settlement is hindered in Queensland
by forestry brings out the following points:—The State
has a total area of 429,000,000 acres, but in forest
BLACKBULL TREE, POMONA, BLACKALL RANGE, SOUTHERN QUEENSLAND.


reserves and in State forests and national parks she
holds locked up an area of slightly over 4,000,000 acres,
and of the latter aggregate about 1,260,000 acres are
situated west of the Dividing Range, or are in localities
where the soil, rainfall, and general conditions are such
as to render close settlement impossible under any
known agricultural methods. In addition, 440,000
acres of the total lie on the sandy Fraser and Stradbrooke
Islands and in the rugged islands of Whitsunday and
Hinchinbrook, whilst about 73,750 acres contained in
national parks may be excluded from any discussion
concerning the reservation of lands for the growth of
timber. This leaves in the whole moist coast belt only
about 2,300,000 acres of timber reserves and State
forests which might be said to interfere in any way
with the progress of agricultural settlement. But a
close examination shows that even the bulk of this
2,300,000 acres may be disregarded at present in any
discussion concerning the respective claims of forestry
and agricultural close settlement. Over 800,000 acres
are confined to the rough mountainous parts of Cook-
town, Port Douglas, Bowen, and Mackay, and when
account is taken also of the very rough and the poor
sandy reserves in all the remaining coastal districts, it
is found that in all over 1,500,000 acres may be dis-
regarded in this connection, part of this area being well
timbered, while a large proportion was reserved appar-
ently only because it was considered useless for any other
purpose. Consequently there are not more than 800,000
acres in the coastal belt which can be said to stand in
the way of close settlement, and even the greater pro-
portion of this area, though it would be readily selected
for speculative purposes or for conversion into pasture,
cannot be classed as arable land. Naturally in any
particular locality the existence of reserves prevents a
certain amount of close settlement, but if the State be
considered as a whole it seems incredible that with a
population of less than 800,000 the country should be
deemed to be hampered in its development by the reten-
tion of these 800,000 acres of timbered reserves. In
reality if the land already selected were utilized to its
full capacity the effective reserves would be found to be
fai too small to supjffy the needs of the population which
would be in existence.
The custom, for some reason or another, in Aus-
tralia has been to tacitly assume that close settlement
should take precedence over forestry in any country
where close settlement can be established on a permanent
basis. This idea has arisen from lack of scientific know-
ledge on the question of timber growing. Until very
recent years all the States have been remarkably lacking
in expert knowledge on this most important of national
resources. The forests have been wastefully exploited,
and the product from them has not been turned to its
most profitable use. In point of fact, timber is an ex-
tremely important national necessity, and should not
be treated as a product of minor value. Recent devel-
opments in naval warfare have emphasized the import-
ance of every nation being independent of the imports
of national necessities, and it is worthy of note that in
England the price of imported softwoods for 1915 was
almost 50 per cent, greater than for 1913, while there
has been considerable danger of supplies being seriously
curtailed. Also the prevailing idea that timber reserves
should be relegated to the back blocks requires to be
reviewed, for forestry is a business which should not be
foredoomed to failure. Timber, generally speaking, is
less valuable bulk for bulk than most agricultural pro-
duce, and more expensive to handle, so that standing
trees decrease in value, as the distance from market
increases, much more quickly than other crops; this
fact, together with other financial considerations
dependent on the length of time taken for the forest
crop to mature, has led to the generally accepted prac-
tice in France and other countries of having
a large proportion of the forests surrounding or adjacent
to towns and villages. Thus the growth of timber has
become a remunerative proposition, while, in addition,
the aesthetic and health-giving effects of forests in the
midst of dense populations are not to be underestim-
ated. Certainly, if the forestry question be looked at
from the popular present-day point of view, it must be
admitted that the returns from virgin forests compare
unfavourably with those obtained from the same land
under cultivation or even under grass; but this is not
a fair criterion, as the virgin forests of Queensland do
not yield on an average more than 20 per cent, of the
yield to be expected when correct forest management
has made the land fully productive. It is remarkable
that, while European countries with their huge popula-
tions require and are able to keep from 18 to 32 per
cent, of the total area under forest, in Queensland the
reservation of 1 per cent, of the State is deemed to
be excessive.
I he actual wealth produced to the State bv enter-
pi ise in the timber industry is very seldom recognized
even by politicians and others interested in public
affairs. One of the reasons of this indifference is because
the trade, being so largely local, does not appear in the
export statistics. Figures already quoted show the total
product of the sawmills of Queensland. The following
statistics from the Commonwealth Year Book, No. 8,
show the value of Queensland woods when in a manu-
factured condition:—“ln 1913 the number of sawmills,
joinery mills, and furniture and cabinet-making fac-
tories in the State was 370; the total number of


employes was 6,516; wages paid amounted to £643,388;
and the total value of the manufactured output was
£2,016,861. For the same period the butter, cheese,
and condensed milk factories numbered 88, employing
835 hands, and paying £91,213 in wages, with an

output valued at £1,813,706. Just as the total value
of the dairying industry cannot be said to be represented
by the factory output given above, so the figures men-
tioned do not by any means indicate the full value
of the industries dependent on local timber. The out-
put of coach and waggon-building factories is valued
at £179,833, while the construction of rolling stock for
the railways is another important item; in addition a
considerable trade with the southern States is carried
on in log timber, while there is a large trade in hewn
and round timber, viz., sleepers, piles, girders, and
other bridge timber, mining timber, houseblocks, fencing-
timber, and firewood, which is not represented in the
above figures.” The report of the Queensland Com-
missioner for Railways for the year ended June 30,
1915, contains further evidence of the comparative
public importance of the timber industry. For the
period mentioned general merchandise and live stock,
as usual, were easily the most important sources of
revenue to the department. The other items included
wool, 76,754 tons, with revenue of £272,020; sugar-
cane, 320,390 tons, £28,030; agricultural produce other
than sugar-cane, 556,231 tons, £236,006; timber (log
and sawn), 529,479 tons, £217,998; firewood, 250,798
tons, £31,543; coal and coke, 779,386 tons, £149,530;
other minerals, 727,292 tons, £119,686. To properly
appreciate the importance of these statistics, it is neces-
sary to recollect that the trade represented was mostly
in local timbers, the quantities of imported timbers
being comparatively small.
The trade now is dependent only partly on the
resources held by the Crown. For many years timber
from privately-owned land will supply a considerable
portion of the demand. But the future of the industry
will ultimately rest entirely upon the Government, and
must depend for success or extinction upon the policy
which the State adopts in conserving suitable and
sufficient areas. The Director of Forests (Mr. N. W.
Jolly), an officer who has studied his subject under
practical conditions in several countries of Europe as
well as in India, states that from what is known of
the resources available, it is certain that the existing
reserves, unaided by forestry operations, not only can-
not possibly supply the future needs of this growing
State, but also are insufficient to supply permanently
an annual demand equal only to that existing at present.
The difficulty as regards the shortage in area, he says,
is not easy to overcome, as land selection has resulted
in the alienation of large areas in those localities which
bore good timber naturally, and offers to resell to the
Crown are generally made at impossible prices. What
can be done with the waste lands of the coast in the
way of afforestation can be determined only after experi-
ments lasting over years; but in view of the difficulties
of climate and drainage, too much reliance should not
be placed on these areas at present. On the other hand,
says the same authority, the increase in the yield of
timber which, after the lapse of the necessary time,
follows forest management is the most important factor
bearing on future supplies, and may be relied on to go
far in making up for the shortage in area. Unfortun-
ately, to undertake the work necessary to produce this
increase is not now practical on account of the Forest
Department being understaffed and trained officers not
being available, even if Parliament voted sufficient
money to pay them high salaries. With a view to over-
coming this difficulty, efforts have been made by the
Queensland Government authorities by co-operating

DISTRICT, NORTHERN QUEENSLAND.
with the Government of New South Wales in the estab-
lishment of a Forest School. This project, like so many
other desirable enterprises, has been shelved on account
of abnormal financial and other conditions brought into
being by the dislocating influences of the war.


Coolangatta.
Coolangatta (in Queensland) and Tweed Heads (in
New South W ales) together form what practically is one
town, though they are divided by a double line of
barbed-wire and wire-netting fencing, the strip between
the two barriers forming a buffer intended to prevent
stock diseases being communicated by contact from one
State to the other. The older settlement was at Tweed
Heads, but of recent years great progress has been made
by Coolangatta, which is perhaps the most pleasant
curling foam and at others in a deep booming cannonade.
At the back of the town are hills, clothed thick
with the heavy timber which yields evidence of a
copious rainfall. Everywhere the vegetation is virile,
luxuriant, and glittering with the heterogeneous
splendour of many colours. To the south, the land-
scape is rugged and imposing. The lie of the McPher-
son Range coincides with the boundary between the
States. As the mountains approach the coast they lose

watering - place within easy rail journey from
Brisbane.
It would indeed be difficult to find a more attractive
holiday resort than Coolangatta provides. The town
has become popular because of the scenery to be
found in the immediate neighbourhood, because of
the excellent beach for surfing, and because of the fresh,
cool air which blows in from the wide-spreading Pacific
Ocean. Immediately in front of the town is a deep
expanse of sand, on which the deep-seacombers throw
their massive bulk, sometimes in long slow masses of
m size and become a series of high ridges, the last of
such elevations being Point Danger, a headland which
forms the most striking feature of the seaboard at that
spot, and which so nearly caused disaster to overtake
Captain Cook in his famous voyage of discovery. The
sea about that locality is striped with many reefs.
Immediately across the boundary fence the district
of Tweed Heads has very much to offer the visitor to
Coolangatta. The Tweed itself presents a wide expanse
of water, navigable for a considerable distance into New
South Wales, and flowing between the fertile alluvial


flats that, in turn, are overhung by deep-blue mountain
ranges. Here is a fair sample of the rich Northern
Rivers District of New South Wales, a territory des-
tined some day to maintain in ease and plenty a
population of some millions of people. Within a few
minutes’ walk from Coolangatta the visitor may catch
a steamer which will take him up the Tweed
to Murwillumbah. The stream winds round the
feet of mountains where ferns and shrubs intermingle
with great trees in an impenetrable tangle of many
colours. Here the interminable struggle for existence
makes all things beautiful, the mighty forest giants
striving for advantage by forcing their leafy heads far
above the clinging undergrowth, creeping plants seizing
every opportunity for bathing in the sunlight and stretch-
ing out to the air, whilst all kinds of shrubs manage
to survive by growing rapidly and by the force of sheer
virility in pushing out weaker competitors. Sugarcane-
growing has been a mainstay of the district, but latterly
this industry has largely given place to dairying. The
fertility of the soil is almost boundless, the rainfall is
copious, and all the circumstances make for prolific growth.
At the back of Coolangatta, within the borders of
Queensland, lies a considerable quantity of rich dairy-
ing and agricultural land. A good proportion of this
is now being used to advantage, but a larger area still
lies covered with the native timber, which has hidden
the surface of the ground from the time of first occupa-
tion and for ages before. How fertile is the country
may approximately be estimated from the window of the
train as it approaches this favourite of summer resorts,
the open patches of grass land and the nature of the
towering timber alike revealing the nutriment contained
in the ground, so large a portion of which is composed
of vegetable mould.
As Southern Queensland in general, and Brisbane
in particular, grow, so will Coolangatta extend its boun-
daries and increase in population. Dairying and
agriculture will progress as the native forests are
conquered. The thriving of such industries in a
coastal district, with so sure a rainfall, must inevitably
add to the general prosperity of the State.
Southport.
Of ocean watering-places Soutliport is the most
easily accessible to Brisbane, and for that reason it is
the oldest in the southern portion of the Queensland
coast. The township is situated on a short branch line,
leaving the Tweed Heads line at Ernest Junction. The
site is at the entrance to Boat Passage, the beginning
of a long narrow channel which, lying between the
mainland and the southern extremity of Stradbrooke
Island, itself makes the southern extremity of Moreton
Bay. Exactly opposite Southport is the open ocean,
from which the deepwater swell reaches the bathing
beach, having passed through the wide entrance
between the southernmost point of Stradbrooke
and a narrow peninsula marking the mouth of the
Nerang River.
Proximity to the metropolis, coupled with the
many attractions of the place, has given to Southport
a great popularity among most of those residents of
Brisbane who can afford to leave the confines of the
metropolitan area for -week-ends and other holidays.
The size of the town and the substantial nature of the
buildings yield evidence of the considerable volume of
trade passing through the place. Some of this, no
doubt, belongs to the prosperous agricultural settlement
of the neighbouring country; but little room lies for
doubting that no holiday resort of Queensland
draws more visitors than does this settlement on
the Pacific shore.
At Southport bathers and boaters may choose
between the excitement of the open ocean, the tranquility
of the waters of a bay, or the scenery of a river. The
boat channel and a portion of the bay near the town
are placid as a mill-pond, and within an enclosure where
protection is afforded from sharks the conditions are
such as might meet the approval of the most timid of
novices in seawater. The Nerang River, reaching the
sea from a southerly direction, well merits exploration.
By crossing the mouth of this stream the shore of the
open ocean is reached. From here a hard sandy beach
stretches southward for seven miles. At the termina-
tion of this distance is Burleigh Head, a headland which
forms the object of many excursions from Southport.
The beach is suitable both for driving and walking.
Both shooting and fishing are plentiful at South-
port. The surrounding country is mostly heavily tim-
bered and abounds in native game, whilst the waters
of the bay and the ocean beyond are well stocked
with material for line and hook. Along the exposed
shore of Broadwater—the open cove within the bar—
stretches the Esplanade, below which has been built
a strong sea-wall. At the southern end of the Esplanade
the Pacific cable leaves the continent.
The shire of Southport contains some 44f square
miles. The local authority was first proclaimed on
July 14, 1883; whilst the estimated population at the
present is slightly over 2,000 persons. The municipality
is divided into three divisions, from which a total
of seven representatives sit at the council table-


Dairying and general farming form the chief means
of subsistence for the permanent rural population
of the district. Primary jiroduction is steadily increas-
ing within the district as fresh land becomes cleared and

tioned diocese. After the death of
his father, his mother with her four
children moved to London, where
in 1864 she married Mr. W. J.
Brown, subsequently with her hus-
band and family taking passage by
the '‘Queen of the Colonies” for
Australia. After landing at Bris-
bane in 1865, the family settled at
his present homestead property
started farming operations, gradu-
ally increasing the scope of his
industry until he had built up a
thoroughly successful position. At
the outset he had to deal with the
land, which was heavy scrub in its
rough, untouched condition, necessi-
tating much hard labour before any
payable results could be obtained,
and one of his first and most worthy
achievements was the erection, with
the help of only one skilled assistant,
of the charmingly-situated home-
stead on the Nerang River, which in
spite of 30 years’ wear and tear still
holds its own among the chief resi-
dences of the locality. Canegrowing
and dairy farming were the principal
industries carried on by Mr. Cooper,
who was a frequent prizewinner in
connection with agricultural shows.
About the year 1900 he created a
record for the time by securing four
blue ribbons and two second awards
for butter-producing cows, one cow
yielding over and another a little
less .than two pounds of butter per
day. The property lent itself in
a very generous manner to the
purposes of intense cultivation, and
is an object lesson worthy of study
to the novice in scientific farming.

interest were numerous, and in-

The late JOHN ELLIOTT
WILSON was born at Mount
Egerton, Victoria, in the year
1873, and was a son of the late
David Wilson, for a lengthy period
chief Dairy Expert to the Victorian
Government, who died practically in
harness at Melbourne in 1900, at
69 years of age. The late David
Wilson was born at Glasgow, Scot-
land, in 1831, his parents being
natives of Ayrshire, the great dairy-
ing district of that country. In 1847
he left the commercial capital to
reside at Kelso, Roxburghshire, and
remained in the border country for
an estate at Native Creek, Inver-
leigh, owned by the late Dr. Hope.
During the 15 years that he con-
tinued on this property he met with
considerable success, in spite of the
incubus of a high rental; but the
ensuing big drought of 1867 and
1868 worked havoc to the farmers,
and swallowed up the hard-earned
savings of all previous years. In
1869 the drought broke up, and Mr.
Wilson turned his attention to the
acquirement of freehold in a locality
enjoying a moister climate, where
dairying might be carried on with-
out the drawbacks encountered in
at these popular functions, he
established a splendid record for
himself, carrying off the prize of 100
guineas offered by the Government
in connection with the Geelong
Show, and securing a similar dis-
tinction on two occasions at Ballarat,
while at Smeaton and at Talbot he
was the successful competitor in
entries three of which aggregated
£l5O in prize money. In later years
this excellent reputation was
enhanced by a consistent run of
triumphs in many directions, as in
addition to obtaining about 75 per
cent, of the prizes offered at smaller
six years, at the end of which period
he married, and immediately sailed
for Melbourne by the vessel “Marco
Polo.” Upon arrival at that port in
January, 1854, the ship ran aground
inside the Heads—only the first of
many experiences the reverse of
pleasant which were to be encoun-
tered by Mr. Wilson in the course
of his early colonial career. After
engaging in commercial pursuits in
Bourke Street for a time he aban-
doned city life for outdoor occupa-
tions, commencing in the farming,
dairying, and grazing industries on

his previous proposition. After
struggling for years under the
handicap of limited capital, he
struck out in a new line by inaugu-
rating dairying by machinery, and
although preceded by two other
enterprising spirits in the introduc-
tion of the De Laval separator into
Victoria, he was the first to bring
it under the direct notice of the
farmers by exhibiting it at a num-
ber of agricultural shows, at the same
time giving a practical demonstra-
tion in dairying by steam power. As
an exhibitor in various departments
shows, he was awarded first, second,
and champion honours at the Grand
National Show, Melbourne; first
prize for dairy produce at the Cen-
tennial Exhibition; and four first
and second medals—a very worthy
feat in inter-State competition.
On one occasion a deputation
comprising no less than 30 Members
of Parliament called upon Mr. L. J.
Dow (then Minister of Agriculture)
and urged upon him the necessity
for his department to assist the
farmers by arranging for their
instruction in improved methods in


butter and cheese manufacture. As
a consequence of these representa-
tions Mr. Wilson was appointed
chief inspector of dairying on behalf
of the Government, in which
capacity he was instrumental in
inducing the Department of Agricul-
ture to stimulate the industry by
offering a bonus of .£5,000 on butter
suitable for export purposes; while
he also assisted to frame various
regulations for the benefit of the
man on the land. The Minister for
Agriculture secured his services to
carry out the travelling dairy
scheme, and to erect and operate at
various exhibitions the plant for
that instructive demonstration, the
Government working dairy, which
did an immense amount of good by
materially improving the quality of
butter produced in the Victorian
State. The late John Elliott Wilson
received his education at Mount
Egerton, Victoria, and at 15 years
of age, being ambitious to strike out
for himself, took an appointment
as traveller on behalf of Messrs.
Bartram & Son, cream separator
manufacturers, Melbourne, in whose
interests he travelled over the State
of Victoria for about 10 years. He
relinquished this position to under-
take dairying, partly on his own
account and partly on the share
system, on a farm at Terang, Vic-
toria, and having become very
expert in the industry turned his
attention to the excellent dairying
country open to selectors in Queens-
land. Here he became one of the
holders of the "Stephens” Estate,
which, containing an area of about
11,000 acres of some of the finest
land in the State, had been sub-
divided into four share farms, and
having continued operations under
the share system for three and a
half years, purchased his present
holding in 1905. This was the
homestead area of the same estate,
which was known as "Merrimac,”
and is situated about two miles from
Worongary railway station and six
miles respectively from Nerang and
Southport. The fine grazing area
consists of 500 acres, and the whole
farm has been brought by Mr. Wil-
son into a tdghly-improved condition.

He was the pioneer of the cheese-
making industry in this portion of
Queensland, and in addition to the
erection of a cheese factory equipped
with all modern machinery and
appliances ensured an efficient
water supply by the construction of
a brick and concrete underground
tank with a holding capacity of
about 5,000 gallons. The milk-
ing herd comprised about 140
cows, and all arrangements in con-
nection with the sheds, which are
floored with concrete, were car-
ried out in conformity with, the
requirements of the Dairy Super-
vision Act. Mr. Wilson’s long
experience taught him that the Ayr-
shire strain was the most profitable

for dairying purposes, and he
selected stock from among the lead-
ing herds of Pittsworth and South-
brook, including the champion bull
"Sensation,” prize-winner at the
Brisbane National Show. Mr. Wil-
son’s exhibits at the various shows
won for him many valuable awards,
among which were several blue
ribbons for dairy cattle in the differ-
ent sections. He also won the first
round in the dairy cattle competi-
tion for the "Courier” Cup. At
the Brisbane annual exhibition his
name was frequently to be seen in
the entry list in the cheese section.
Mr. Wilson was a committeeman of
the Southern Queensland and Border
Agricultural Society, and also of the
Southport District Agricultural and
Pastoral Society, in both of which
bodies he took a keen interest. He
served as representative of No. 4
Division in the Nerang Shire Coun-
cil; and was a Justice of the Peace,
having been gazetted to the office by
the Denham Administration. In
1901 Mr. Wilson married Elizabeth,
second daughter of Mr. Peter
Matthews, of Melbourne, the issue
being five children. His death
occurred in the year 1917.
ISAAC RANKIN ANDREWS,
J.P., "Somerset,” Mudgeeraba, is a
native of County Londonderry, Ire-
land, where he was born in the
year 1850. His early education
was imparted to him at the
local public school, which he at-
tended until 14 years of age, when
with his four brothers and an uncle
he embarked by the sailing vessel
"Morning Light” on the long voyage
to Australia, which extended over
13 weeks. His first port of call was
at Melbourne, where he arrived in
1864, and after remaining for a few
weeks in the Victorian capital,
accompanied his relatives on the
further journey to Sydney. Almost
immediately the brothers proceeded
to the Manning River, in New South
Wales, where they took up land, and
commenced farming on the share
system, specializing in the produc-
tion of maize which was the staple
industry of the district. After con-
tinuing there for about eight years,
the young pioneers found their way
to Brisbane, and shortly afterwards
journeyed to Tallebudgera, near the
south coast of Queensland. The
gentleman under review being
anxious to obtain experience under
local conditions, secured employment
on a property where mixed farming
was carried on, and having made
himself acqraainted with the methods
in vogue formed a partnership with
his brother, Mr. W. Andrews, now
of Nerang Creek, with whom he was
engaged in farming pursuits for
nearly 30 years. In those days,
prior to the advent of the railway
system, the teamster was always
sure of employment, and Mr.


Andrews, in addition to follow-
ing agricultural pursuits occupied
himself in carrying operations, con-
veying maize and other produce

whence it was taken by sailing
cutter to Brisbane. On the return
journey he carried stores and sup-
plies to the settlers, and his experi-
ences while camping out on these
trips were frequently of a highly
exciting nature. At times the
country was flooded almost from
Nerang Creek to the Pacific, and the
Andrews’ partnership with his
brother was dissolved in 1899, prior
to which he took up his present
homestead at Mudgeeraba, a pro-
perty consisting of about 1,300 acres
of highly-improved grazing country,
permanently watered, and conveni-
ently situated in the near vicinity of
the railway station. lie has met
with much success in his conduct of
operations, and is a large exhibitor
at the Nerang Agricultural Show
of general farm products and of
stock, being a prizewinner for blood
horses and cattle of the Illawarra
and shorthorn breeds. He has
acquired a considerable amount of
real estate in the township of Mud-
geeraba, including many of the
choicest business sites; and has
proved himself a very useful member
of the community, occupying various
public offices with credit to himself
and advantage to the ratepayers.
He was a councillor of Nerang Shire
for 34 years, retiring when the shire
was divided into four instead of
three divisions in 1913. As chair-
man on three occasions he wielded
his influence wisely, and one of his
best efforts was the securing of a
Government loan of £1,500 to defray
the cost of draining a large area
of swamp land, which has since
been taken up by a large number
of settlers for cultivation purposes.
Mr. Andrews was appointed a
Justice of the Peace in 1895. He
was born at the "Somerset” home-
stead in 1886, and at the close of his
education joined his father in the
working of the farm until 18 years
of age, when he entered the employ

died at the advanced age of 81, after
following farming avocations during
the whole of his life. The gentle-
man under review began his educa-
tion at five years of age, and upon
leaving school worked on a farm for
some little time. At 14 he was
employed on a fishing smack in the
North Sea, but, eventually relin-
quishing marine pursuits, returned
in Queensland, and proceeding direct
to Bundaberg secured employment
on the sugar plantation owned by
Messrs. Gibson and Howes, with
whom he continued for a couple of
seasons. He next turned his atten-
tion to railway construction work
on the line that was being built from
Mungar to Gayndah, and subse-
quently on the route from Brisbane
to Cleveland, after which he worked
on the wharves, etc., in the employ
of Messrs. McGhie, Luya, & Co.,
sawmillers, Brisbane. Finally decid-
ing in favour of settling on the land,
as an initial step he placed himself
in the way of obtaining experience
in farming under local conditions at
Nerang, and having satisfied him-
self that the venture was a safe one,
he took a lease of the property
which he now holds. Eventually,
exercising his right of purchase, he
made this holding (which originally
was a portion of the property owned
by the Manchester Cotton Company,
and comprises 300 acres) his own,
and has continued operations with
uniformly good results. A large
portion of the holding has been
utilized for the growing of maize,
and considerable attention is also
given to dairying, the herd consist-
ing chiefly of cattle of the shorthorn

latter gentleman, a native of Lin-
coln, England, at the age of 21 left
the homeland for Australia with his
newly-wedded bride, arriving by the
ship “Fusilier” in Queensland in
1862. He first found employment

then being pushed forward. He
retained this contract until the com-
pletion of the line, when he pro-
ceeded to the Coomera River
district, and about the year 1869
selected a holding consisting of 225
acres situated on the broad frontage
of this river. He experimented first
with a sugarcane plantation, but on
account of frosts this venture proved
unsuccessful, and the industry was
supplanted by that of rice and flax-
growing. Mr. Oxenford, being a
man of considerable initiative,
launched out in new directions and
tried various methods, with the re-
sult that he has gained the reputation
of being the pioneer in experimental
farming, as well as being noted
for the variety of his products. He
claims to have been the first to
introduce the famous Ayrshire breed
of cattle to Coomera pastures, hav-
ing procured types of this kind from
the estate of a prominent southern
breeder; and was also responsible for
the advent of the earliest He Laval
cream separator into this State,
holding the sole agency for this
useful machine in Queensland at
that time. He was created a Justice
of the Peace by the Mcllwraith
Ministry; and as a further recogni-
tion of his useful services the Gov-
ernment of the day named the local
railway station after him. For
many years he held the position of
chairman of the old divisional
board, as well as being an active
member of various agricultural and
pastoral associations. He gained
several medals in ploughing con-
tests, and represented Queensland
in connection with similar events
in Melbourne. After many years
of toil and hardships, Mr.
Oxenford is enjoying a well-earned
retirement, spending the evening of
his days quietly at Grafton, New
South Wales. His immediate
descendants are two daughters and
three sons. Mr. James F. Oxenford
received his early scholastic instruc-
tion at the State school at Coomera,
and subsequently he assisted his

father upon the home farm for some
considerable time. In his twenty-
second year he became engaged in
sawmilling pursuits at Canuugra, at
a later date proceeding to Beaudesert,
and following his experience in this
direction obtained the management
of an arrowroot mill, which he con-
ducted for three years. At a later
date he undertook contracts on
behalf of the Railway Department to
deliver sawn timber for the construc-
tion of the railway from Murwillum-
bah to Lismore, and also the Crabbe
Creek line, New South Wales; and
afterwards spent seven years in
arrowroot-growing in partnership
with his brother-in-law, Mr. R.
Doherty, at Ormeau, Queensland.
Returning to the old homestead on
the Coomera River, he erected the
first cornflour mill in that district,
and upon relinquishing this industry
commenced dairying and mixed-
farming operations, in which he has
continued ever since. Mr. Oxen-
ford has been a useful member of
the community, serving as a member
of the Coomera Shire Council, and
making an invaluable chairman of
the local agricultural society, besides
being associated with the Brisbane
and Nerang show committees. He is
captain of the Coomera Rifle Club;
and a trustee of the local Methodist
Church. Mr. Oxenford married Mary
eldest daughter of the late William
Doherty, of Pimpama, and has a
family of five sons and one daughter.

to the advent of William the Con-
queror, and including among its
most illustrious members Percy
Bysshe Shelley, the gifted lyric poet
of the nineteenth century. The
gentleman under review was born in
the County of Stafford, England, on
March 6, 1835, his father being
William Shelley, of that county.
On June 22, 1860, being then in his
twenty-sixth year, he received a
commission as ensign in the First
Company, Staffordshire Rifle Volun-
teer Corps, on February 11 of the
following year being promoted to a
lieutenancy. He resigned early in
Land Order from the Treasury
(dated August 23, 1864) authorizing
him to purchase lands to the value
of £3O, this being subject to the
condition that he was not to receive
the title deeds until after two years’
continuous residence in the colony,
but it was not until three years later
that he paid £2O as the first year’s
rent on an unsurveyed lot in
the Coomera Agricultural Reserve.
Meanwhile he started work in the
timber-getting industry at Tam-
bourine, and being a man of hardy
physique and possessed of the cour-
age which made worthy pioneers, he
pursued this arduous calling with
success until the discovery of gold at
Gympie tempted him to test his for-
tune on the mining fields. Some
years later he settled in the Coomera
River district, and founded one of
the first farming homesteads in this
fertile locality, his choice falling
upon a stretch of country lying along
the bank of the river, and now
acknowledged to be the finest land
in the district. Mr. Shelley’s first
holding consisted of 165 acres, which
he devoted to canegrowing, this
being the principal feature of his
enterprise until the period arrived
when he judged it wiser to
follow the lead of others and to
substitute maize and potato crops for
the sugarcane fields. Finally the
improved facilities for dairying were
inaugurated, and a large share of Mr.
Shelley’s attention was diverted in
this direction, with the most satis-
factory results. As the years went
by he added considerably to the
original acreage, and by careful
management the area of the estate

payers as a councillor for the
Coomera Shire. He married in 1872
Ellen, third daughter of the late
William Binstead, who held an
extensive connection as a timber-
getter of the early days, the issue
being four sons and four daughters.
He died in 1903 at the age of 68
years. The eldest son, Mr. Walter
Shelley, was born in 1873, and
educated locally. Upon attaining his
fifteenth year he assisted his father
until the decease of the latter, when

Anthony Shelley, who is in part-
ship with his brother, was born

death ol his father he visited the

wealth, and upon his return became
engaged in commercial pursuits in
Brisbane. He married in 1907 Jessie
Elizabeth, daughter of Mr. Vincent
Santon, of Melbourne, and has two
sons.

while still quite young, was com-
pelled to leave school and begin the
battle of life on his own account.
His first employment was in the
office of his eldest brother, who
carried on the profession of an
architect; and some years later he
decided to leave the Old Country
and try his fortune in Australia.
Embarking from London in 1860 by
the sailing-ship “Prince of Wales,”
after a voyage extending over 13
weeks he landed at Melbourne at a
period when the goldmining boom
was still at its height, and catching
the infection of the hour he spent
some four or five years on the fields,
chiefly at Castlemaine, Forest Creek,
and Bendigo, where he met with the
usual varying success of the average
miner. At the end of this time he
returned to England, taking with
him as a speculation about 1,000
Australian parrots, which proved a
successful venture. In 1860 he again
sailed for the land of the Southern
Cross, and arriving at Queensland
spent a short time
in the capital prior
to coming to the
Coomera River dis-
trict, where he
took up some scrub
land on the upper
reaches of the river,
and commenced the
building up of his
future home. A
creek with a plen-
tiful supply of fresh
water running
through his pro-
perty enabled him
to engage in the
lucrative business of
arrowroot growing-
, O O’
and in course of
time he erected a
mill for the pro-

to be one of the most up-to-
date in the district. Another

he inaugurated with marked success
was the “Sherwood” Orangery, a

was born in Gloucestershire, Eng-
land, in the year 1872, and received
his primary education in that

county, where he attended school
until 10 years of age. His father,
the late William Foxwell, was by
profession a chemist and druggist,
but finding this calling uncongenial,
and having had some little experi-
ence in farming, determined to settle
on the land in His Majesty’s over-
seas dominions. Accordingly, with
his two sons he sailed for Australia
in 1882 by the steamship “Roma,”
and proceeding to the Coomera
River took up a holding of 160 acres
with an extensive frontage to
the broad and permanently-flowing
stream. Here he founded a home,
and continued in agricultural pur-
suits until the time of his death,
which occurred in 1895. It is
interesting to note that William
Foxwell’s brother, the late George
Henry Foxwell, was a pioneer of this
portion of the Coomera River coun-
try, where he arrived 20 years
earlier, in 1862, and selected in its
virgin state the land upon which
the present homestead stands, form-
ing an island surrounded by wide
creeks and ana-branches from the
main river. George Henry Foxwell
died on October 4, 1910, at 68 years
of age. The gentleman under
review, who had assisted his father
on the farm during his boyhood and
early youth, thus gaining an inti-
mate acquaintance with the agricul-
tural industry, proved himself so
capable in the administration of the
affairs that after the attainment of
his majority the estate was trans-
ferred to him, and he has since
worked it on his own behalf. The
cultivation of sugarcane was one of
the mainstays of the holdings in
this district in earlier days, as many
as four large mills being kept at
work with the output of the various
plantations, but for various reasons
the industry declined, and these
mills have long been a thing of the
past. The production of maize,
potatoes, and lucerne has, however,
proved very profitable, and as soon
as the settlers discovered the value of
their land for these crops there was
a general movement in favour of the
corn-cob, tuber, and fodder plant.
The very high floods which occasion-
ally visit this district are by no
means an unmixed evil, as they
leave on the lower areas a deposit
of silt, which has been found most
valuable as a fertilizer, enabling
crop after crop of unvarying quality
to be produced from the same fields.
Although giving a fair amount of
attention to cropping his land, Mr.
Foxwell’s main source of income is
derived from his dairy herd, which
is one of the largest in the district,
RESIDENCE OF MR. W. G. FOXWELL, COOMERA RIVER.
the average number of cows milked
daily being in the vicinity of 70.
The product of the dairy is sent to
the Kingston Butter Factory, of
which he was one of the original
shareholders. Mr. Foxwell has iden-
tified himself loyally with the
various public organizations of the
district, and is a constant ex-
hibitor, principally of sugarcane and

potatoes, at the shows promoted
by the Beenleigh Pastoral and Agri-
cultural Society, of which he is a
committeeman. He was created a
Justice of the Peace by the Denham
Administration about 1909; and
among his other offices are numbered
those of chairman of Coomera School
Committe, and trustee of the school;
and churchwarden of the local
Church of England. He has always
been a cordial patron of all forms
of clean sport, and has held himself
ready to assist, financially and other-
wise, every movement for the
advancement of the district. Mr.


Foxwell was married in 1899 to
Annie Elizabeth, second daughter of
the late J. W. C. Howard, a pioneer
sugar-planter and mill owner, of
Riverside, Upper Coomera, and has
four daughters and two sons.
JOHN BEATTIE, J.P., who
owns and occupies the “Fern Hill”
property, Coomera, was born in
County Tyrone, Ireland, in the
month of June, 1838; and beginning
his studies at an early age continued
to attend school until his eighteenth
year, receiving an education above
the average for a farmer’s son of
that period. Upon the termination
of his scholastic course, being
possessed of considerable grit and
enterprise, he determined to try his
fortune in Australia, and accord-
ingly took passage by the steamship
“Royal Charter,” which landed her
passengers at Melbourne after estab-
lishing a time record on the trip,
which was accomplished in 63 days.
Upon arrival Mr. Beattie joined two
cousins who were engaged in the
carrying of stores and other supplies
to Bendigo, Beechworth, and other
big mining centres of the early days
in Victoria. After spending five
years in this connection, during
which period he became intimately
acquainted with life on the different
goldfields, he came to Queensland,
and enlarged his experience of
colonial conditions by taking employ-
ment on a cotton plantation at

the soil was of a most strenuous
character, a dense mosquito-infested
swamp of tea-tree covering what is
now a rich, cultivated flat on the
river bank; but perceiving the value
of this unreclaimed land, Mr.
Beattie set to work in good heart,
flourished on the redeemed soil,
which has been worked continuously
ever since it was first brought under
cultivation, giving equally good
returns at the present time as in
the beginning. Shortly after taking
up his residence upon the selection
Mr. Beattie increased his landed
area by a further 87 acres, both for
the purpose of consolidating his
possessions and to ensure an ample,
unbroken block, upon which he
might extend his operations from
year to year without being hampered
for either pasture land or cultivation
paddocks. This purchase brought
his total area up to 147 acres of good
grazing country, with sufficient first-
class agricultural land to afford
plenty of scope for his utmost enter-
prise in this direction. The com-
fortable homestead erected by Mr.
Beattie in 1896 is surrounded by out-
buildings designed on a modern plan,
a feature sjoecially deserving of men-
tion being the new milking shed, in
which up-to-date machinery has
been installed. The gentleman under
review has taken an active interest
in the public affairs of the district,
the affairs of the local shire council
in especial commanding his earnest
attention. He has served as a
member of this body for about a
quarter of a century, and still

in 1866, in his thirty-third year.
The late gentleman was born at
Prenzlow, Germany, on October 14,
1834, and at the close of his educa-
tion was employed in the hour-
milling industry in his native land
until his departure for Australia in
the year above mentioned. After
obtaining some experience in local
conditions of farming in the Alber-
ton district, and manfully doing his
share in the early formation of this
district, he established there the first
grist mill in Queensland, which

from its original position; and

pane on an area of land embracing

1,000 acres. About 1885 Mr. Heck
retired from the active supervision
of the industry, placing the mill
under the capable management of
his eldest son, Mr. W. H. Heck,
who has continued to order its
affairs on the lines so wisely laid
down by his father. The late Carl
Heinrich Heck died on July 20,
,1915, at the advanced age of 81,
after a useful career in the land of
his adoption, where he attained a
tangible eminence, and specially con-
centrated his public activities in
advancing the affairs of the district,
in which his chief interests lay.
These services were recognized by
seat on the Beenleigh Shire Council
for about six years, acting as chair-
man on various occasions, and
during the course of his career held
other positions of trust. Mr. W. H.
Heck, the present proprietor of the
“Rocky Point” Sugar Mill and
surrounding estate, was born at Al-
berton, Queensland, on October 18,
1871, and attended a school in that
district until 13 years of age.
Whilst assisting his father in the
sugar industry, he studied engineer-
ing, and after taking control of the
business about 1905 turned his
attention to the enlargement of the
scope of operations. With this end
in view he established the first black-
smith’s shop at Rocky Point, install-
ing all the latest, most up-to-date
machinery and appliances, which
Jhave enabled all work to be accom-
plished on the most progressive and

the footsteps of his father in those
matters more directly connected
with the general welfare of the com-
munity of which he forms a unit,
and in 1910 was appointed a Justice
of the Peace by the Denham
Ministry. For 12 months he occupied
the office of chairman of the Been-
leigh Shire Council, in which he
held a councillorship for six years;
he is vice-president of the Southern
Queensland Agricultural and Pas-
toral Association; and vice-president
of the Alberton Rifle Club. Mr.
Heck married in 1900 Ida Augusta,
fifth daxxghter of the late Gottfried
Kriedemann, of Alberton, and has
a family of six children.
ROBERT McCREADY, “Glen-
arb,” Ormeau, is a native of the
Emerald Isle, having been born in
the year 1836 at County Armagh,
Ireland, where his forebears had
carried on farming pursuits from
time immemorial. After leaving
•school his first opportunity for prac-
tical work awaited him on the home
fa rm, where he served a lengthy
probation to the agricultural indus-
try, extending from his fourteenth
to his twenty-sixth year. In 1863
he left his native land for Aus-
tralia, whither large numbers of
emigrants from England, Ireland,
Scotland, and other countries were
making their way, attracted by the
possibilities offered in the direction
of land settlement, no less than by
the marvellous tales of fortunes
made on the gold diggings of the
various colonies. Mr. McCready
took passage by the sailing-ship
“Vernon,” and during a protracted
voyage extending over 26 weeks
shared in some experiences of an
exciting and hazardous nature. A
mutiny occurred among the sailors,
which originated through some fric-
tion between the crew and the
officers, and the former being fully
armed actually attempted to take
command of the vessel. A very
large number of passengers—about
450 souls, all told—were on board,
and the whole body of these rallied
in support of the officers, and after
a sharp tussle, in the course of which
one of the mutineers received
injuries which afterwards proved
fatal, lent their assistance for the
working of the ship, in this way
safely reaching Rio Janeiro, the
first port of call. Here the worst
section of the offending party was
put ashore and imprisoned, and a
new crew was secured, by aid of
which the forward voyage was con-
tinued, and the boat’s destination
ultimately gained six months after
embarkation. After his advent to
Queensland in 1864, Mr. McCready
spent a short time in looking round
the metropolis, then little more than
a very primitive collection of small
houses—even the Government House
of the day being described by an
English child as a ''doll’s house”—
and eventually accepted a position as
manager of a progressive farming
property at South Pine, a few miles
distant from Brisbane. This afforded
him an opportunity of introducing
some of the methods in vogue in the
Old Country, while himself gaining

the exjaerience of local conditions
necessary to enable him successfully
to launch out on his own account,
which was his ultimate aim. With
his eye on the future, he obtained
all the knowledge he could with
regard to the prospects offered to
settlers in the different districts, and
when at the end of five years he saw
his way clear to starting for himself
his choice of locality fell on Ormeau,
where he took up a holding of 80
acres on which to commence pre-
liminary operations. Some time
later he doubled this acreage, next
added a further 40 acres, and
thenceforward embraced every
opportunity of increasing his landed
possessions until in course of time
he held the title deeds of an estate
aggregating over 2,000 acres. The
greater portion of this area was
used for grazing purposes, but the
well-watered, rich, and fertile flats
were reserved for the cultivation of
arrowroot, the staple industry of the
property, to which they have ever
since been entirely devoted. Mr.
McCready entered upon the business
of arrowroot-growing with the deter-
mination to succeed, and putting all
the energy and industry at his com-
mand into the project, he had the
satisfaction of witnessing a yearly
increase in his returns, while in the
matter of quality the "Glenarb”
product would be difficult to beat.
So excellent a reputation was
acquired by his brand that in 1879
he forwarded an exhibit to the
International Exhibition held in
Sydney in that year, and had the
satisfaction of being awarded a
certificate of merit. Mr. McCready
established his first arrowroot mill
on Pimpama Creek, which flows
through his property, and in 1900
he built the first sawmill in the
district. He has been very active in
his participation in all projects set
afoot for the advancement of the
common weal, and has proved him-
self a very useful member of the
community of which he forms a
unit. For about nine years he
served as a member of the old
divisional board which extended
from Pimpama Creek to Beenleigh;
is a Justice of the Peace of 30 years’
standing; and for about a quarter of
a century has held membership in
the Beenleigh Pastoral and Agricul-
tural Association, being a frequent
exhibitor of stock in connection with
the annual shows promoted by this
body. Some 35 years ago he made a
donation of land to serve as a site
for the erection of a public school
for the district, and took an active
interest in the establishment of this
necessary institution. He is also
chairman of trustees of the Pimpama
Cemetery Board. Whilst resident at
North Pine, in the year 1866, Mr.
McCready married Annie, eldest
daughter of the late James Wcods,
originally a farmer of County
Armagh, Ireland, and of this union
there are two sons and three daugh-
ters. He takes things quietly in the
evening of his life, all the active
management of the farm and saw-
mill being in the capable hands of
his sons, Messrs. Robert Wood
McCready and Thomas Henry
McCready, who represent the work-
ing members of the firm.


ROBERT DOHERTY, of
"Ormeau” House, Ormeau, was born
in Queensland in 1867, and is the
second son of the late William
Doherty, J.P., a native of County
MR. WILLIAM DOHERTY.
Monaghan, Ireland, who arrived in
Queensland about 50 years ago, and
became a prominent resident of
Pimpama, now a rising township,
within a measurable distance of
Brisbane. In order to acquaint
himself with the local conditions of
farming, he accepted employment on
various properties in the above-
mentioned district, and having con-
siderably altered his ideas, which
were those of an agriculturist of the
Old Country, by contact with sugar-
cane producers and general farmers
his attention to mixed farming, he
commenced the now staple industry
of arrowroot-growing about the year
1884, and at a later period acquired
a larger property known as ‘Tim-
pama” Plantation, which comprised
qn area of about 1,150 acres, which
he utilized for grazing purposes.
The late Mr. Doherty died at 70
years of age, on March 17, 1904.
His second son, the subject of this
notice, was born at Pimpama, in
September, 1867, and received his
education at the public school of his
native village, which he attended
until his fifteenth year. Relinquish-
ing his studies, he began to assist
his father on the home property,
and continued under the paternal
roof-tree until 25 years of age. He
then struck out for himself, enter-
ing into partnership with his brother-
in-law, Mr. J. F. Oxenford, in a
mixed-farming and arrowroot-grow-
ing proposition, which they carried
on conjointly for about eight years,
when the connection was dissolved,
Mr. Doherty having purchased his
partner’s interests and assumed full
control. By his industry and ability
he has made a thorough success of
his undertaking, and his arrowroot
farm, which is a well-known sight,
in full view of the passing railway
traveller on the southern line, has
made its reputation with some most
prolific crops, the total area under
cultivation being about 45 acres. A
very advantageous feature of the
property is its permanent and copious

ALEXANDER THOMSON, of
“Bonnie Brae,” ' Ormeau, is the
eldest son of the late Alexander
Thomson, of Deeside, Scotland, and
was born at Dundee, County Forfar,
on June 4, 1859. After leaving
school he worked under the super-
vision of his father, who was engaged
in railway construction in the Old
Country, where the gentleman under
review remained until his thirtieth
year. In 1889 with his newly-
wedded wife, Mr. Alexander Thom-
son took passage by the steamship
“Taroba,” which made the voyage
from Gravesend to Townsville in the
fast running of six weeks. Upon
arrival he lost no time in acquiring
some acquaintance with local condi-
tions, for this purpose accepting
employment on a sugar plantation
at Macnade, near Ingham, North
Queensland. From here he went to
Rockhampton, where he was occu-
pied in gardening and horticultural
occupations for a time, and subse-
quently, after spending a short time
in Brisbane, made his advent to
Ormeau, in December, 1890. Pene-
trating the dense scrub surrounding
the Upper Pimpama Creek, Mr.
Thomson selected 30 acres of this
hitherto neglected country, and pro-
ceeded to lay the foundation of what
has proved a highly successful propo-
sition, his judgment in regard to the
value of the untried land being amply
justified by results. He first applied
himself to mixed-farming operations,
and beginning to feel his feet
extended his operations to sugar-
cane growing, which also was a
revelation of the possibilities of the
district, the crops produced being of
excellent size and quality. Encour-
aged by this success, he began to
acquire more land, and gradually
increased his holding to about 500
acres of first-class grazing and culti-
vation country, which he has worked
ever since, commanding very profit-
able returns. Situated in one of
Nature’s prettiest settings, and
watered by freshly-running streams

of the natural richness of the soil,
and not least among its manifold
advantages is the beautiful position
that has made it such a desirable
spot as a habitation. The site for
the up-to-date homestead was care-
fully selected, and reflects great
credit upon the taste which saw and
marked the crest of this particular
hill as the place for an ideal home.
The background is formed by more

charm of near green things to far
distant mountains, over which the
emerald hue of spring has defied the
ethereal blue or grey of cloudy days.
Mr. Thomson has taken his place
among the prominent workers for
the good of the district, and served
the ratepayers as a member of the
Coomera Shire Council for nine
years, occupying the chair for a

Beenleigh.
The history of the settlement of the Beenleigh
district contains lessons of general interest to agricul-
turists carrying on industry along the coastal region of
Southern Queensland. A country’s wealth may lie in
other possessions than material riches or mere value of
production. The freeholds about Beenleigh were first
obtained by immigrants who had never acquired the
Australian habit of aspiring to own several times as
many acres as could be effectively worked. The practice
of well working the land they had learned at an early
date. Undoubtedly production could be increased sub-
stantially if the local farmers made fuller use of tech-
nical knowledge which the Agricultural Department
renders available. Yet the neighbourhood stands as an
illuminating example of the dissociation of volume of
production from mere size of holdings. The case of one
farmer continuously making a comfortable living for
himself and family from nine acres is not regarded
locally as exceptional or remarkable; whilst the pros-
perity of the town has for its mainstay industries, which
in most other countries, where they have been estab-
lished, depend on the employment of cheap coloured
people. An inspection of the rich Logan flats, which
have now been in continuous cultivation, mostly without
the use of manure, since the earliest days of Queensland
settlement, will convince whoever desires to learn that
hot-climate industries, requiring a considerable amount
of manual labour, may profitably and permanently be
conducted entirely by white people. Arrowroot growing
usually is not successfully carried on where holdings are
so large that the work must be done by wage-earners,
but so successful has this enterprize proved to be in
the district under review that five mills are required
to treat the large volume of raw material coming for-
ward, and large returns are made by the individual
growers engaged in the business. Many thousands of
tons of sugar cane are grown in the district every year,
and the production continues to increase. Co-operative
effort among the farmers themselves plays a large part
in supplying the labour which, during certain seasons,
is needed to supplement the efforts of the holder,
assisted by such of his sons as are of working age.
The average annual rainfall of the Beenleigh dis-
trict runs from 42 to 43 inches. Whilst other regions of
Queensland’s southern coastal strip considerably exceed
this record, few are so immune from serious drought.
The lowest fall recorded was during 1915, when 27
inches were measured. Climatic adversity, bringing loss
and sometimes ruin to primary producers in other parts
of the State, not infrequently gives increased returns
to the landholders of this specially-favoured centre by
reason of improving the prices ruling for the products
of which the output remains unaltered. On more than
one occasion Beenleigh has been the only district of
Queensland in which the potato crop has not totally
failed. The principal products of the place are arrow-
root, sugar cane, bananas, potatoes, and butter. Under
the conditions prevailing locally the various industries
which those commodities represent produce acreage re-
turns much above the average. Considered on a land-
area basis, dairying assumes a very different aspect in
this region to that borne in more southern parts of the
Commonwealth. The prolific soil, the rainfall of con-
sistent abundance, and the sustained warmth of the
climate combine in producing a growth of vegetation
yielding phenomenal results from the cultivation of
such fodder plants as lucerne and paspalum.
There are several scales of value for the land in this
wealthy district. Properties appearing in the muni-
cipal books as worth but £l2 per acre in many
instances could not be purchased for four times
that sum. In the southern States, country of
similar productiveness would sell readily at more
than that figure. So much land has remained in the
hands of the families of original selectors that anything
approaching a general valuation based on actual market
conditions is hard to arrive at. And this obscurity is
added to by the methods of laborious intense culture
under which the district has been worked, and which
differs so widely from the character of farming enter-
prise as carried on in most other parts of Australia.
An unusual quantity of manual effort has been
applied to the district, both in the preparatory work of
establishing settled industry and in carrying on current
operations. A striking illustration of how hard the
settlers have been willing to work is provided in the
region known as Pimpama Island, an area consisting
naturally of worthless swamp, but by an elaborate
system of drainage now converted into valuable grazing
paddocks. The Beenleigh farmers have accomplished
great things without scientific skill; much more could
be achieved by the application of the best modern
methods. A large proportion of the population traces
its origin to Central Europe, and like many other
Queensland colonists of similar pedigree, the magnet
drawing this group from the opposite side of the globe
lay in the German Mission established by the Rev. Dr.
Lang at Moreton Bay in 1838, the year before the with-
drawal of the convicts to Sydney. In the early
stages of their colonizing enterprises the settlers were


assisted through their difficulties with the sujiply of
rations by the Government. The living standard they
maintain to-day presents a very different social atmo-
sphere to that prevailing in the same district half a
century ago. If any people in Queensland know how
to realize the economic, political, and general benefits
of Australian rural life, as against the conditions
prevailing among the peasant classes of Central Europe,
they should be the present inhabitants of the Beenleigh
district.
Beenleigh was proclaimed a shire on November 11,
1879. The area under the control of the local authority
is square miles, whilst on December 31, 1914, the
population totalled 2,040.
The late DAVID VEIVERS,
who may fitly be termed the Grand
Old Pioneer of the Albert River, in
the Ipswich district, Queensland,
was a native of Scotland, his birth-
place being Canonbie, Dumfrieshire,
where he first saw the light of day
on April 11, 1836. After attending
school for a few years he applied
himself to farming pursuits on his
father’s property, and subsequently,
at 22 years of age, left the bleak
hills of his native land with Aus-
tralia as an objective, his purpose
being to subdue the wilderness in a
new country under sunnier skies.
After a protracted voyage on the
sailing vessel “Glantana,” Mr.
Veivers arrived at the port of Bris-
bane iii 1859, and proceeding to the
Nerang district there joined his two
brothers in the timber-getting indus-
try, which was conducted in a
primitive fashion, the logs having to
be rafted down the swift current of
the Nerang River to their destina-
tion. Some years later Mr. Veivers
struck out for himself, selecting the
Albert River district as the venue of
his operations, and having taken up
his block of land with the formation
of a home in view, continued to
exploit the bush for timber with the
aim of financing himself so as the
more expeditiously to accomplish his
purpose. His holding, which in the
first instance consisted of 80 acres,
with a frontage to the Albert River,
proved thoroughly responsive to the
scheme of development carried out
thereon by Mr. Veivers, and the
success attained encouraged him in
the acquirement of further territory,
until eventually he became proprie-
tor of an estate of several thousand
acres, which were devoted to mixed
farming and grazing pursuits, in
which he continued up to the time
of his demise in 1910. Mr. Veivers
was a man of considerable public
spirit, and was chosen as one of the
original members of the Waterford
Divisional Board, in connection with
the proceedings of which character-
istically he gave more attention
to the needs of his neighbours
in the matter of road construction,
etc., than to his own. He was
a founder of the Cedar Creek pub-
lic school, and the first committee-
man appointed to control this
institution; was a supporter and
shareholder of the Queensland
Co-operative Meat Export Company
of the district; and also figured as a
shareholder of the Kingston Butter
Factory. Mr. Veivers, who was
affectionately known as "Dave”
MR. DAVID VEIVERS.
among his circle of intimates, was a
man of exceptionally fine physique,
being over 6 feet in height, straight
as a poplar, and very strongly built.
As a consequence he was almost
invariably the victor in all athletic
contests, even among the very many
excellent specimens of manhood who
foregathered to take part in any
tussle of strength, speed, or skill in
the Southern Queensland of the day.
It is a common tale in the mouths
of his admirers how on one occasion
after a long journey he defeated
comfortably the champion quarter-
of-a-mile runner of the period; while
at wrestling his challenge was never
accepted. With these abnormal
physical powers he united a shrewd
mentality which ensured success in
business undertakings, as was plainly
evidenced in the foresight which dis-
closed to him the certain increase in
value of the farming and pastoral
lands of the district before the lapse
of any lengthy period. With regard
to politics it may be said that no
new aspirant for Parliamentary
honours in his constituency who was
unsuccessful in securing his support
ventured to contest an election, and
had he himself evinced the slightest
desire for legislative service he would
have received such overwhelming
promises of assistance that any oppo-
sition would have been useless. After
a lengthy illness Mr. Veivers died at
his residence, "Park” House, Albert
River, on October 5, 1910. He
married in October, 1863, Louisa,
second daughter of the late William
Binstead, a pioneer of the timber
industry on the Coomera River, on
which occasion the striking person-
ality of the young couple rendered
the event one of note in the district.
His widow, four daughters, and six
sons survive him.
CARL WILHELM LUBACH,
“lona,” Beenleigh, is a son of Mr.
Wilhelm Lubach, a native of Ger-
many, who grew to man’s estate in
the Fatherland, and eventually in
common with numerous others of his
countrymen became possessed with
the desire to emigrate, Australia
being the far distant goal upon
which his heart was set. After his
arrival in Queensland in the year
1874, Mr. Lubach selected land on
Pimpama Island, at Moreton Bay,
and devoted his attention to the
production of sugarcane, in which
industry he met with considerable
success. He continued to reside at
Pimpama for several years, and
during this period his elder children
were born. The superior attractions
of the Albert River district, how-
ever, exerted a stronger charm, and
ultimately he left the Island, selling
his interests there in order to pur-
chase a block of land at Beenleigh,
close to the banks of the above-
mentioned river. This selection,


which was 48 acres in extent, proved
well suited to canegrowing, and
while a portion was reserved for the
plantation, the remainder of the
land was used for mixed-farming
purposes, in which good results were
obtained. Mr. Lubach is looked
upon as one of the pioneers of the
Beenleigh district, which at the
time of his advent was in its infancy,
the country, though promising, being
chiefly in its virgin state, and waiting
the hand of man to develop its rich
possibilities. His son, Mr. C. W.
Lubach, the subject of this notice,
was born at Alberton, a township
about six miles distant from Been-
leigh, in October, 1878, and received
his education at the public school at
Pimpama Island. At the close of
his schooldays he applied his boyish
energies to assisting his parents on
the home farm, but not being satis-
fied with the limited experience
which so small a holding could offer,
by degrees found opportunity to
gratify his wish for more extended
knowledge by getting employment at
the hands of the surrounding
farmers and other residents of the
district. He continued to turn his
hand to a variety of occupations,
which afforded him the wider experi-
ence of which he was in search, until
he reached his twenty-seventh year,
and being now fully equipped for
independent enterprise determined
to strike out for himself. Accord-
ingly in 1900 he purchased a pro-
perty adjoining his father’s holding

at Beenleigh, and consisting of
about 80 acres, where he commenced
sugarcane growing, in good hope of
rapidly building up his fortune there-
by. Circumstances, however, in the
888
shape of a dire three-years’ drought,
which wrought so much havoc on the
settlers’ holdings throughout the
country, wrecked these hopes, and
at the close of 1903 he relinquished
the thankless task of cane-produc-
ing in favour of mixed farming,
which offered better possibilities to
the small landholder. By degrees
large lucerne fields and potato
patches superseded the cane indus-
try, and other departments of a
thriving farm took their place in due
order; while, a staunch believer in
progressive methods, Mr. Lubach as
his prosperity advanced procured all
the more modern implements and
machinery for his agricultural oper-
ations, among which the up-to-date
chaffcutting plant for dealing with
the lucerne, worked by an oil engine,
takes pride of place. He has
achieved some fame as a horse and
cattle breeder, and his Clydesdale
stallion, “Roland,” by “Hercules,”
a sire descended from a well-known
imported Scottish strain, has already
secured for him no less than seven
blue ribbons at various agricultural

shows held throughout the State.
Mr. Lubach has also been a success-
ful competitor in the direction of
farm products, and out of the 20
exhibits of this nature for which he
has made himself responsible, 13
have received premier awards at the
hands of the judges—a very satisfac-
tory record. His property, which is
known as “lona,” is favourably
situated in near vicinity to the
Beenleigh railway station, the dis-
tance being little over a mile, and
he is thus enabled without difficulty
to consign all tire products of his
farm to metropolitan markets, where
they find a ready sale. Mr. Lubach
has taken his share in forwarding
the public interests in all ways open
to him, and as a member of the
Beenleigh Agricultural Association
committee he has done much useful
service. He is also a member of the
Beenleigh Shire Council; and takes
a prominent part in friendly society
affairs, being a leading member of
the U.A.0.D., and of the 1.0. F.
Mr. Lubach married in 1906 Louisa
Martha, eldest daughter of Mr. C.
Berndt, of “Yellowood,” Beenleigh,
of which union there is issue one
daughter and four sons.
GUSTAV EICHMANN, of “Stan-
more,” Yatala, near Beenleigh, was
born in 1866 in the district where he
now resides, and is the fourth son
of Mr. Christian Frederich Wilhelm
Eichmann, now of Ban - Scrub, about
five miles distant from Beenleigh.


The latter gentleman came to
Queensland in the vessel “Lorashell,”
arriving at Brisbane on August 13,
1862, and followed the example of
other worthy pioneers by applying

himself to the development of the
natural resources of his adopted
country. His first employment was
on the Ipswich railway line, after
which he was farming at Beenleigh,
going thence to Pimpama Island,
where he engaged in the cultivation
of sugar cane, subsequently trans-
ferring the farm to his son and
taking up his residence at the
“Stanmore” homestead. Through
the long period of half a century of
Australian life he gained consider-
able experience in canegrowing and
other of the principal industries of
the Queensland settler, both in the
more southerly districts and in the
vicinity of his present home. Mr.
Eichmann, who is now in his eighty-
third year, is the father of a large
family of sons and daughters, most
of whom are Australian-born, and in
his late years he has enjoyed the
co-operation and assistance of those
who owe to his example much of
their own success in life. The sub-
ject of this article, Mr. Gustav
Eichmann, received his early educa-
tion at a school on Pimpama Island
and Alberton, and concluding his
studies at 14 years of age, was
pressed into service on the home
farm, where his assistance was
urgently required on account of the
scarcity of labour at that period.
Continuing with his parents until his
twenty-first year, he then struck out
for himself, obtaining employment
in railway construction work on the
then new line from Brisbane to
Beaudesert. Having gained the
necessary experience, he began
taking contracts, and was occupied
in this way on behalf of the Govern-
ment until the completion of the
line, meeting with some trying
experiences whilst carrying material
for the construction of the present
railway bridge, the big flood of 1887
inundating a large area of country
in that district. At 26 he secured a
10 years’ lease of a holding embrac-
ing 60 acres at Eagleby, of which
he made a profitable venture, grow-
ing maize, sugarcane, and potatoes
very successfully. Upon the expira-
tion of his lease, he joined his
father on the “Stanmore” home-
stead, and in 1903 the increasing
years of the older man disinclining
him for the continuance of active
responsibility in connection with the
farm, Mr. Gustav Eichmann received
transfer of the property, which he
has since carried on on his own
account. The situation of “Stan-
more” is a delightful one, the farm
having a fine frontage to the Albert
River, and pleasantly sheltered by a
range of distant hills, it yet enjoys
its full share of the glorious Queens-
land sunshine. In addition to the
solid industries of maize and potato
growing, which Mr. Eichmann pur-
sues with good results, he is an
enthusiast in rose culture, the soil
on portions of the holding being of
a clayey nature, and admirably
suited to this branch of floriculture,
as his success as an exhibitor of roses
at the Beenleigh Show has testified.
In matters of public import he has
ever been a practical and interested,
though retiring, worker for the
advancement of the district. Though

and Albert Rivers, was born in
Germany on May 13, 1831, and
came to Brisbane on January 18,
1864, by the sailing ship “Susannah
Goddefroy,” with several hundreds of
his compatriots, who like himself
were about to start afresh in a
young country which offered attrac-
tive possibilities to settlers of nerve
and sinew. Upon arrival at More-
ton Bay the passengers were conveyed
made the journey with others to the
locality now known as Bethania
Junction, on the banks of the Logan.
The name of Waterford had been
given to the infant settlement here,
which could be reached only by the
river trip, a small paddle steamer
capable of carrying about 100 per-
sons being utilized for the transport
of the settlers to their new home.
As navigation was then very much a
matter of guesswork, the joys of the
trip were mingled with experiences
often the reverse of joyous, the
vessel frequently becoming grounded
on a sandbank, which entailed a
stoppage of several hours until the
next tide floated her into midstream
once more. Mr. Rehfeldt first
occupied a Crown grant of six acres,
which he cleared and cultivated,
remaining at Waterford until the
year 1866. He then took up 11 acres
about four miles lower on the Logan
River, and continued operations on
this holding for about nine years.
Ultimately he came to Alberton,
near Beenleigh, and purchased an
island at the junction of the Logan
and the Albert, which comprising
some 59 acres of fertile soil offered
exceptional advantages to an enter-
prising settler for farming and other
agricultural purposes. At the same
time Mr. Rehfeldt secured an area
of 14 acres on the mainland opposite
his island property, and erecting a
homestead on this portion of his
possessions proceeded to lay out his
farm, access to the island being
being well adapted to the production
of cane, Mr. Rehfeldt utilized his
land as a sugar plantation, meeting
with considerable success in his
efforts in this direction. After seven

years he found it necessary to make
some arrangement to cope with the
large output of sugarcane, and
accordingly in 1880 erected the pre-
sent mill, which did remarkably

machinery and other makeshift
appliances. In course of time, as

in Queensland, and the soil and

manufacturers the latest inventions
bearing upon their industry, a

installed at the mill, which has since


continued its excellent work with a
still greater measure of success.
Having overcome the adverse condi-
tions which made the task of the
early pioneer a severe test of his
calibre unremitting energy and
stern grit, and perseverance alone
availing him to win through—Mr.
Rehfeldt was enabled to go forward
under less strenuous circumstances,
and towards the close of his long and
useful life took a justifiable pride in
the successful career which enabled
him to bequeath a property of 540
acres with many valuable improve-
ments to his heirs. His marriage
took place in 1855 with Wilhelmina
Christiana, daughter of the late
Joachim Frederich Bester, by whom
he had issue 13 children. Mr.
Rehfeldt’s decease occurred at Alber-
ton, on September 14, 1911, in his
eighty-first year, his widow still sur-
viving him. CARL FREDERICH
WILHELM REHFELDT, the
eldest son of the foregoing gentle-
man, was born in Germany on
April 10, 1856. He received his
education chiefly by means of even-
ing classes, making his advent to
Queensland with his parents as a
child of seven, at an era when
country schools were practically non-
existent. Long days of work on the
farm and sugar plantation were the
lot of his boyhood, and continued
until his twenty-fourth year, when
he formed his own home on 25 acres
of land, and commenced independent
operations. An accident unfitting
him for further strenuous exertion,
in 1887 he became a postal con-
tractor for the carriage of mails, a
position which he filled for 12 years.
Upon his father’s retirement from
active life, he took over the manage-
ment of the sugar-milling industry,
with which he combines dairying and
mixed farming, and during the
sugar season employs as many as 24
hands in the mill alone, the crushing
often totalling as high as 6,000 tons
of cane. The raw sugar and other
farm produce is conveyed direct
from his own wharf on the river
per steamer to Brisbane. Mr. Reh-
feldt’s fine residence is charmingly
situated in one of the prettiest spots
in the neighbourhood. The gentle-

the late Francis Frederick Rising

Queensland in 1909. The late Mr.
Shailer came to Brisbane by the
sailing ship “Sultana,” having pre-
viously been engaged in farming
pursuits in County Meath, Ireland.
After a voyage of 18 weeks duration
he landed at Moreton Bay in 1866,
and having secured a grant of land
from the Government became a
pioneer in the fruitgrowing industry
in this State, planting the first

land on his property, which was
situated at Slack Creek, in the

Ireland, in the year 1855. He
accompanied his parents to Queens-
land, and assisted in the family ven-
tures until attaining the age of 17,
when he visited the tin-mining fields
of Stanthorpe, and became engaged
in that industry for about five years.
Relinquishing mining pursuits he
came to Slack Creek, and started for
himself in the timber-getting trade,
operations then being conducted in
primitive fashion by rafting the
timber down the river at high tide,
its ultimate destination being Bris-
bane. During the 20 years that he
continued in this way Mr. Shailer
took up land, upon which he erected
a homestead, and in the middle
nineties gave some attention to
horticulture, but on account of insect
pests was compelled to destroy all
his fruit ti'ees with the exception of
the orange grove, which has proved

JOHANN GOTTLIEB SCHNEI-
DER, of Waterford, via Bethania
Junction, was born on April 12,
1834, in a town situated among the
iron-bound hills of Silesia, Germany,
MR. JOHANN GOTTLIEB SCHNEIDER.
where also he received his education,
and in due course thoroughly learned
his trade of blacksmith, which he
followed in the Fatherland until his
29th year. He then joined a party
of 12 families, all from the same
village, and with these enterprising
spirits Mr. Schneider voyaged to
Queensland in the “Susannah God-
defroy,” reaching Brisbane after a
voyage of 18 weeks’ duration. As

was natural, the little band desired
to found a settlement, and being
awarded free grants of land (the
maximum extent for one man being
18 acres), chose the locality where now
Bethania township forms a centre,
the trip up the river from Brisbane
being made in a little paddle
steamer known as the “Diamond.”
Mr. Schneider’s first venture was to
put up a primitive blacksmith’s
shop, where he carried on his trade
during the evening hours, his days
being occupied with burning off
scrub and clearing his land. As a
modest prosperity crowned his exer-
tions he increased his holding, and
continued the joint industries of
farming and blacksmithing for about
25 years, during which period he
built in 1864 the first German
waggon ever constructed in Queens-
land. In 1884, with 13 others, he
erected a sugar mill in the district,
which owing to adverse seasons was
abandoned as a losing venture three
years later. Mr. Schneider then
purchased the buildings and machin-
ery, and installed the plant of the
first sawmill at Bethania in 1888, a
highly successful enterprise which he
personally supervised until 1907,
when he retired from active partici-
pation in the business, which was
then taken over by his eldest son.
Gazetted a Justice of the Peace in
1884, Mr. Schneider has occupied
various other public offices, con-
spicuous among which was a 17-
years term of service on the old
divisional board, which gave way
later to a shire councillorship, when
he served as chairman in the local
governing body for a lengthy period.
He also acted in the capacity of
postmaster at Waterford for upwards
of 40 years. He was a founder of
the Lutheran Church in the dis-
trict, in connection with which for
30 years he took charge of classes in
the Sunday school, and has always
consistently upheld every movement
for the general welfare of the dis-
trict. Mr. Schneider married in
1860, and had a family of four

daughters and four sons. His eldest
son, Martin Trangott Schneider,
was born at Bethania, in June, 1867,
and at the close of his education at
the local school when 14 years of age
he began his apprenticeship to the
blacksmithing trade under the
tuition of his father. Having com-
pleted his training, at 21 he under-
took the control of the business, and
continued until 1907, when the saw-
milling operations came under his
jurisdiction, since when his time and
attention have been claimed entirely
by this important enterprise. Upon
the retirement of his father from
the local shire council he was
elected to the vacant seat, which he
still (1915) holds. He has taken
an active interest in the local rifle
club, of which he is a foundation
member, and has filled the office of
captain for 20 years, besides which
he is one of the vice-presidents of
the Logan and Albert District Rifle
Clubs Union. During the years he
has been associated with the club
he has won a number of trophies,
including three championships of the
Logan and Albert districts. He
was a member of the mounted
infantry in 1886 and 1887; and at
the present time is vice-president of
the Southern Queensland Agricul-
tural and Pastoral Association. Mr.

Rev. A. Sultmann, and has three

Upon leaving school he worked in
his father’s business, known as a
“loom shop,'’ containing six looms.
His father’s death in 1850 left the
family dependent on its own exer-
tions. After continuing in the
weaving trade for a period he decided
to emigrate to Australia. Mr. James

in 1863. For the purpose of gaining
experience Mr. Williamson entered
the employ of the late John Philp,
father of the present Sir Robert
Philp, who was engaged in a large
way in the timber industry. Later
he joined his brother-in-law in
timber-getting on the Richmond
River, New South Wales, and
eventually his relative accompanied
him to Buccan, situated a few miles
from Bethania Junction, on the
southern coastal railway line. Here
they secured a holding of 93 acres
on “Jimboomba” Station, on the
banks of the Logan River, where
Mr. Williamson built his present
homestead. The work of developing
his block was immediately pro-
ceeded with, and in addition to
dairying and mixed farming, which
he found the most profitable branches
of industry, he also became a
pioneer in cotton-growing in Queens-
land, which had been first introduced
at “Veresdale” by the late Robert
Towns, but the Government bounty
being discontinued, and the spread
of the pest known as “bollworm,”
caused him to abandon this
enterprise. Mr. Williamson has
increased the area of his estate
by degrees to 513 acres, but
recently, feeling the weight of years,
he relinquished the active direction
of affairs, and handed over the con-
trol of the farm to his son, Mr.

chairman of the divisional board of

near Cleveland, was born in October
of the year 1857, at Westphal,
Germany, and is the second son of
MR. JOHANN PHILLIP BENFER.
the late Johann Phillip Benfer, who
in his youth learned the trade of a
stonemason, which in later years he
relinquished in favour of farming
pursuits. At an earlier era the pro-
genitors of Mr. Benfer came to
Germany from England, and settled
in the Fatherland; but during the
lifetime of his late father the
political conditions of the country
became distasteful to the inheritor

of the principles of freedom instinc-
tive to the British race. Leaving
his country on the eve of the Franco-
Prussian War, Johann Phillip
Benfer arrived in Queensland in
1871 by the sailing-ship “Guden-
burg,” after a very rough voyage
extending over four months. He
first landed at Rockhampton, but a
short sojourn in the northern town
sufficed, and with his family he came
to Brisbane, and forthwith proceeded
to familiarize himself with the con-
ditions of the young colony, where
he had thrown in his lot. After
working at his trade for a time, and
also undertaking other kinds of
work for the purpose of enlarging
his experience, he selected about
300 acres of Government land in
the Mount Cotton district, which
derives its name from the prevalence
of a dense growth of weed known as
“wild cotton.” Here he became one
of the earliest settlers, and after
clearing and preparing his land for
cultivation, he commenced cotton-
growing, the product of his fields
being sent to a cotton-mill —the only
one at that period —in Brisbane.
Owing to some misadventure this
factory closed down, causing serious
loss to the cotton growers, who were
compelled to abandon this depart-
ment of industry; and Mr. Benfer
subsequently turned his attention
first to the cultivation of maize and
later to sugarcane production, which
the erection of a local mill had made
very profitable. The veteran pioneer
died in 1896 at the ripe age of 73,
after a life spent in blazing the
track for posterity, and proving the
possibilities of a district compara-
tively remote from railway commu-
nication and other conveniences of
civilization. Mr. Johann Franz
Benfer, the subject of this notice,
came to Queensland with his parents
when 12 years of age, and spent the
following three years in completing
his education at Nundah, where he
attended a public school. He
assisted his father on the home farm
for a number of years, and in 1894
took over the paternal property, in
which he and his brother held a
joint interest, since which date he
has gradually consolidated his pre-
sent fine holding. In addition to
a large area of grazing land, Mr.
Benfer has placed about 20 acres

under intense cultivation, which is
devoted chiefly to the production of
bananas and pineapples. He has
met with much success in his propo-
sition, an evidence of the good
results attained being the silver
medal which was awarded to him in
1908 by the adjudicators in connec-
tion with the Brisbane International
Exhibition for his exhibit of a collec-
tion of farm produce. Mr. Benfer is
numbered among those who, whilst
devoting their energies assiduously to
the development of their own hold-
ings as the best method of serving
the community at large, are yet not
wanting in the public spirit which
constrains to direct service where
such is required. He is a member of
the local school committee, and has
generally held himself ready to
assist in any way towards the better-
ment of the district. He married in
1884 Elizabeth, daughter of the late
Heinrich Opperman, a farmer of
Eagleby, and has a family of six sons
and four daughters.


JOHN HOLZAPFEL, of Mount
Cotton, was born at Toowong in
1864, his father, the late Hermann
Holzapfel, a native of Germany, who
came to Queensland in 1861, having
MR. HERMANN HOLZAPEFL.
settled in that then remote suburb
of the city. In those days labour
conditions rendered the life of the
unskilled immigrant very strenuous,
long hours and short pay being the
rule rather than the exception.
Hermann Holzapfel’s first employ-
ment was with the late Mr. Robert
Cribb, of Toowong, his wages being
farm products for the Brisbane
market. In its improved condition
the farm became valuable, and being
ambitious to extend his farming
work Mr. Holzapfel took up a home-
stead selection at Mount Cotton,
part of the land being open forest
country, and part covered with dense
scrub. The clearing and cultivating
of these 80 acres was toilsome work,
but he stuck to the task with the
proverbial grit of the old pioneers,
and forced Nature to yield him his
well-deserved reward. Maize and
sugarcane were the principal crops
he raised, but ultimately he aban-
doned both for fruitgrowing, out of
which he accumulated a competence.
He passed away in 1903, at the full
span of 71 years, leaving a respected
name and a comfortably settled
family. His son, John, first went
to school at Eight Mile Plains, and
later he attended the Mount Cotton
State School, then only a half-time
school. At the end of his fourteenth
year he started work with his. father
on the farm, becoming expert in
every branch of agricultural work.
By his father’s will he became heir
to the farm, which under his careful
management and his later land
acquisitions now extends over 380
acres, on part of which are full-
bearing tropical fruit trees, while
20 acres are devoted to intense
cultivation. Though a long distance
has been greatly improved, it now
being an up-to-date country residence.

HENRY HEINEMANN, J.P.,
“Buona Vista,” Mount Cotton, is
amongst the forefront of the older
settlers in Southern Queensland. He
was born in Holstein in 1858, and
was brought by his parents to
Queensland when he was only about
seven years of age. His father,
Hans Heinrich Heinemann, who by
trade was a skilled artisan brick-
layer, arrived in Brisbane by the
emigrant ship “Johanna Seesor.”
For the purpose of gaining necessary
experience in his new conditions, he
entered the service of the late Mr.
C. Stamp, who then was a prosperous
farmer at Belmont, which now is
practically a suburb of Brisbane, but
which in those early days was
regarded as a rural district. After
becoming familiar with the higher
principles of agriculture, Mr. Heine-
mann, having thriftily laid-by a
small competency, bought a farm of
about 75 acres at Broadwater, near
Brisbane, but after a few years of
close experimental work he found
that the land was unsuitable for
agriculture, a discovery that induced
him to sell out and try his fortune
in the Upper Tingalpa district,
where he secured a homestead selec-
tion of 80 acres. The selection was
what is known as scrub land, the
clearing of which always is a test of
grit and endurance. Steadily Mr.
Heinemann cleared the land, croup
and crest, and planted maize and
cotton, principally relying on those

crops to keep the family-pot merrily
boiling. But seeing still greater
possibilities ahead he disposed of his
Tingalpa property, and in 1875
settled at Mount Cotton, where he
laid the foundation of his permanent
future home. There he first took up
a 117-acre leasehold selection of
scrub land, which within 10 years
he converted into freehold. He was

the pioneer of maize growing in the
Mount Cotton district, but he turned
from that crop to sugarcane, under
which he put 80 acres of his picked
land. In conjunction with this
enterprise he erected his own sugar
mill, at which cane from the sur-
rounding district was regularly
crushed by him, at that time a
crushing of 2,000 tone being a
highly profitable proposition. Hans
Heinrich Heinemann died in 1897 at
the age of 62 years, leaving three
daughters and one son. Mr. Henry
Heinemann is the sole survivor of
the Heinemann family in Australia.
In hie youthful days at Tingalpa
only half-time State schools were
available, but young Heinemann
kept at the half-time desk until he
was 17 years of age, by which time
he was well equipped in a sound
primary education. Meanwhile, of
course, he had been following farm
work on the family homestead, and
when his father died the manage-
ment of the farm devolved entirely
on him. With the other interests he
took over the sugar mill, but finding
it to be unprofitable owing to the
restriction of labour and the low
price of sugar, viz., £8 per ton, he
decided to give the majpr share of
his attention to the cultivation of
tropical fruits. Later on he disposed
of the mill, which is now in the
hands of a company at Pimpama
Island, known as the Junction Sugar
.Milling Company, of which Mr.
Heinemann is a director and share-
holder. Finally he acquired the
whole property, which under his
judicious management now covers
1,000 acres of splendid land. Mixed
farming and tropical agriculture,
combined with home agriculture for
stock purposes, are the main
features of the homestead lands. But
Mr. Heinemann has made a special
feature of cattle-breeding, his
favourite breed being the famous
Ayrshire stock, with which he has
achieved notable successes. From
his stock the Ayrshire herds in the
Northern Territory have sprung.
As a pioneer he first blazed the road
to Mount Gravatt. His public
services are recorded in his 11 years’
occupancy of a seat on the Tin-
galpa Shire Council, for one year of
which he was chairman; in his
efforts in securing the installation of
the telephone from Brisbane to Red-
land Bay, which later was extended
to Mount Cotton; also as a promi-
nent member of the Beenleigh Agri-
cultural Society, in connection with
which, and also in connection with
the National Association Show, he
has been a distinguished prize-
winner. His name is familiar with
the affairs of bodies such as the local
school committee, the South Bris-
bane Co-operative Fruit Canning
Company, of which he is a director,
and of many agricultural confer-
ences throughout Queensland. He
has seven daughters and two sons,
all worthy offshoots of the sturdy
family stock.


JAMES DANIEL COLLINS,
orchardist, Redland Bay, was born
in 1858, at Egham, Surrey, Eng-
land, where his father, the late
Daniel James Collins, filled the

position of engineer in a large saw-
milling business. Subsequently the
family migrated to Queensland,
arriving at Brisbane on Christmas
Day, 1861, in a small schooner, the
‘■'George Kidd,” which took 158 days
to do the voyage; and shortly after
landing the late Mr. Collins rented
a farm at Oxley Creek, whence later
on he removed to Bunya, now known
as Upper South Pine River, and
carried on general farming opera-
tions there for about 16 years. In
1884 he came to Redland Bay as a
pioneer settler, and began the
development of 40 acres of unim-
proved land, clearing and planting
the virgin soil with sugarcane. This,
however, did not prove a success, and
after two years he replaced the cane
with citrus fruits, custard apples,
and bananas. Excellent results fol-
lowed this departure, and in 1901,
having made a competency, he
retired to private life in Brisbane,
where he died in April, 1914, at
the age of 79. Mr. James Daniel
Collins was three years of age when
he arrived with his parents in
Queensland, and received his educa-
tion at the local school at Oxley
Creek (the present Sherwood), which
he attended until just before enter-
ing his teens, when he began to
assist his father on the farm, con-
tinuing with his parents until his
twenty-second year. He then struck
out for himself, and after enlarging
his experience by undertaking
employment of a different nature
from that to which he had been
accustomed, in 1881 he purchased a
holding comprising about 37 acres of
first-class orchard soil at Redland
Bay, where he commenced fruit-
growing on his own account. Mr.
Collins’ land rises in a gradual
slope with an eastern aspect, com-
manding a magnificent view of the
waters of the bay, and has proved
admirably suited to the purposes for
which it was designed by the young
horticulturist; citrus fruits, custard
apples, and bananas taking most
kindly to the soil, and producing
prolific crops with no deterioration
of quality. Mr. Collins set himself
a very high standard at the incep-
tion of his enterprise, and has been
untiring in his experiments, always
aiming for improvement in one or
another direction, as a consequence
of which his name has become very
widely known in far distant parts
of the world, and he has even
received requests from Washington
(U.S.A.) and Manila (in the Phil-
lipine Islands), for buds and grafts
of Queensland fruits. In his own
country, too, he is not without
honour, the State Government show-
ing its appreciation of his work
by appointing him an honorary fruit
inspector under the Diseases of
Plants Act. His services are ever
in request in the various attempts
made to eradicate fruit pests, and

CHARLES DICKFOS, “Sunny
Grove,” Redland Bay, is a native of
this State, having been born near
the town of Ipswich in 1871. He is
the eldest son of Mr. Carl Dickfos,
a pioneer farmer and well-known
identity of southern Queensland,
who, born at Uckermark, Germany,
in 1852, emigrated from the land of
his fathers when only 16 years of
age. Coming direct to the northern
colony of the great, sparsely-settled
island-continent of Australia, Mr.
Dickfos quickly adapted himself to
local conditions, and discovering
very soon that laborious work was
the order of the day, he applied
himself with the industry of his race
to such occupations as fencing,
scrubbing, clearing, and the various
avocations incidental to the develop-
ment of farming areas in different
parts of the country. Having done
his full share of pioneering work,
and reared a large family, he finally
settled in the fertile district of
Redland Bay, where he is still
engaged in fruitgrowing pursuits.

studies at 12 years of age in order
to assist his father on the home
farm. Here he remained until his
twenty-fourth year, when he decided
to strike out for himself, his first
venture being the purchase of a
grazing and dairy farm, comprising
about 320 acres in extent, and

situated on the Upper Bremer
River, near Rosevale. This enter-
prise not proving as profitable as
anticipated, he sold out after 18
months’ occupation, and coming to
Redland Bay about the year 1897,
he acquired 16 acres of the splendid
fruitgrowing area for which that
district is so justly noted. Settling
down, he established his future home
on this holding, which originally had
been used as a banana farm, for
which purpose, however, it had not
proved very suitable. Considerable
labour was involved at the outset
in uprooting the former crop, but
by degrees this was accomplished,
and citrus fruits and custard apples
took the place of the banana palms.
The wisdom of changing the crop
has since abundantly been proved,
the north-easterly aspect of the land
being particularly favourable to the
cultivation of the present fruits,
which come to perfection in the
mellow rays of the sun, which are
somewhat modified in the late
winter, which is their ripening
season. Two acres of pineapples
have also given good returns, and
the whole area under culture pre-
sents a prosperous appearance.
Pacing the main road, at the end of
the orchard Air. Dickfos has erected
a modern dwelling-house, containing
eight rooms, in addition to the
kitchen and other offices, and from
the verandahs of this comfortable
abode, which is complete in all its
interior arrangements, a fine view
of Moreton Bay may be obtained.
Mr. Dickfos takes considerable
interest in the public welfare of the
district, and is an active member of
the Southern Queensland Agricul-
tural and Pastoral Association. He
is a consistent and successful
exhibitor of fruit at the annual
show at Beenleigh, and in 1914
carried off five first prizes, while in
the following year seven out of
eight premier awards for exhibits in
the fruit section fell to his share.
One of the founders of the Redland
Bay Co-operative Sawmilling Com-
pany —a local venture which has
proved an unqualified success—he
continues to occupy a seat on the
board of directors; and in educa-
tional matters he has displayed a
praiseworthy activity, having served
for eight years as a member of the
Redland Bay School Committee,
while he is also a live member of the
local school of arts. Mr. Dickfos owns
a motor launch, the “Comrade,” a
comfortable little craft of 15 h.p.,
and finds recreation in the manage-
ment of this boat. He was married
in 1896 to Annie, youngest daughter
of Mr. Hermann Argow, a pioneer
farmer, of Ipswich, and has four
daughters and three sons. His eldest
son has recently completed his
training as an electrician.


Cleveland.
Lying but twenty-three miles from the metropolis,
the township of Cleveland is easily and quickly reached
from Brisbane, and this fact, coupled with other advant-
ages, has served to make the place a popular resort for
week-end seekers after change of environment.
A good deal of historic interest attaches to Cleve-
land. In the early days of Queensland settlement cir-
cumstances pointed to that village becoming the capital
of the infant colony. Indeed, more was it by accident
than design that the centre of administration was
placed at its present site. Had Governor Gipps,
who at the time was visiting Moreton Bay from Sydney,
been landed at Cleveland when the tide was high
instead of when it was low, the chances are that the
decision given by him might have been the reverse of
what proved to be the fact- When the boat, from
which the Vice-Regal party was landed, touched
ground and could proceed no further shoreward, the
Governor, accompanied by officials, was obliged to
step into the shallow water. But they found no
hard sand beneath their feet. Instead, it was soft
yielding mud, through which they were obliged to
flounder. The experience was not happy for the future
prospects of Cleveland. Historians have not described
the state of the Governor’s temper when at last he reached
dry land; but history records the fact that from that
time the chances of Cleveland being made the official
centre of the embryo settlement were at an end. So
low and shelving a coast was held by the representative
of the Crown to be unsuitable for shipping. Yet for
some time, indeed until recent days, Cleveland has been
the depot of considerable trade. The Governor’s ex-
periences in the mud of this part of Moreton Bay’s
shores led him to recommend the selection of Ipswich.
I ortunately for the future of the north-eastern division
of the Commonwealth, the capital did come practically
to Moreton Bay. The natural development of Queens-
land and the evolution of modern steamships, with the
ever-increasing size of the latter, have rendered the
present site of Brisbane the most suitable port.
Cleveland is at the terminus of a line of railway,
and lies at the end of a sharp point of land which juts
into the southern portion of Moreton Bay. The town-
ship is constructed on shelving ground of no great
elevation above sea-level. At one time the land
in the vicinity was held in large pastoral areas,
supporting but scanty population and mostly ill-
developed. But to-day the holdings are small,
whilst the substantial and richly-adorned home-
steads show that under modern methods of primary
production the settler can secure larger returns from a
small farm than his father or grandfather found it
possible to derive from a wide-spreading sheep or cattle
station. Horticulture, mixed farming, sugar growing,
pineapple growing, banana growing, and intense culture
generally form the mainstay of the district. That these
callings have proved profitable may be established by a
motor run of a couple of hours through the surrounding
country. The fertility of the land at once becomes
apparent, even to the novice in agriculture; whilst the
close subdivision of the farms into paddocks, and the
rare wealth of growing things, amply demonstrate how
heavy is the production of the land. The houses are
large and attractive, surrounded with gardens and
orchards, in themselves displaying an extensive spend-
ing power on the part of the owners. Unlike the social
conditions pertaining to primary production throughout
most of Queensland, the circumstances attaching to life
here permit of an easy social intercourse, with a jrdeasant
proximity to the metropolis of the State.
Cleveland is admirably situated for forming a
yachting depot. Lying on the southern arm of the
bay, it is in fair proximity to the many islands which
stud that part of the harbour. Directly opposite, in
an easterly direction, lie the long sandy beaches of
Stradbrooke shining in the sunlight like a silver riband,
beneath the thickly scrubbed hills which form the bulk of
the long narrow island which runs for nearly 70 miles
north and south, and gives shelter to the bay within.
Nearer at hand is Peel Island, set aside by the State
Government as a leper station. Mounting the high
ground at the back of the peninsula on which Cleveland
stands, the spectator may command a wide-spreading
view of land-locked water and wooded islets stretching
away for many miles to the south, whilst to the north
the open waters of the bay are dotted only with St.
Helena, Green Island, and Mud Island, and the
deltas of the Brisbane River. To the north-east lies
Moreton Island, in reality but an extension, some
twenty-four miles long, of Stradbrooke, the narrow pas-
sage between carrying but about eight feet of water at
low tide. Time was, however, when this waterway,
known as South Passage, formed the chief entrance to
Moreton Bay. Two tragic wrecks, of which the traces
of one quite lately lay protruding from the sand, were
followed at a considerably later date by the silting up
of the channel, which has led to an addition of fifty
miles to the length of the voyage from Sydney to
Brisbane, vessels now being forced round Cape Moreton,
on the northern extremity of Moreton Island.
To the south the islands cluster so thickly together
that the waters of the bay appear as little more than
channels between the land. Of these Russell and


Macleay Islands are the largest, with Pannican Island
ranking as third in order of area.
At Ormiston, in the very early days, a trial crop
of sugar was planted by the Hon. Louis Hope, the
uncle of Lord Hopetoun, the first Governor-General of
the Commonwealth. Unfortunately the Australian
LOUIS HUGONIN, J.P., of
“Kinmylies,” Cleveland, is a scion
of a very old English family, whose
military records reach far back in
history. His birthplace was South
Devon, the year of his birth being
1857. For many years he was a
student at that historic place of
military learning, Cheltenham Col-
lege, his ambition being to follow in
jackaroo on a cattle station in the
Logan district, then owned by the
late Hon. T. L. Murray-Prior.
Thence he went on a station in the
“Never Never,” known as “Boulia
Creek,” in the Belyando River,
where he was general manager for
five years. The monotony of the
life on the run was not infrequently
relieved by forays by the wild
settlers of those days knew nothing of scientific methods
of refining the product, and they were not able to
grapple successfully with the process of extraction and
manufacture. But a large part in the genesis of the
sugar industry of Australia undoubtedly was played by
this early experiment.
so improved even on its original
improved condition that it is
regarded as one of the model fruit
farms of the Cleveland district. The
present homestead is a modern villa,
tastefully designed both inside and
out, and standing amid pretty
gardens and ornamental trees. In
1904 Mr. Hugonin married Mrs.
J. V. Chataway, widow of the late

the footsteps of his warrior for-
bears. That ambition, however, was
not fulfilled, adverse circumstances
intervening, and turning his course
to the bright prospects of sunny
Queensland. His grandfather,
Colonel Hugonin, was a commander
of the 4th Heavy Dragoons, and led
the march during the Gordon riots
from Canterbury to London. That
was in 1783. His father also had a
distinguished military career, he
being captain of the famous 34th.
He was born in November, 1818,
and died in 1875. Four years after
his father’s death Mr. Louis Hugo-
nin reached Queensland, working as
aborigines. He then took a spell
from Australian country life by
revisiting the Old Country, where
he remained for a couple of years.
But the call of the bush lured him
back, and on returning he took up
an area of land on the Logan River,
but after a comparatively short
occupancy sold it, and in 1894, after
a short residence on a leased farm
at Ormiston, he went to Cleveland,
where he purchased a well-improved
fruit farm of 13 acres, and there he
still resides. Bananas and pines are
the principal tropical fruits grown
on the farm, which since Mr.
Hugonin’s proprietorship has been
well-known Minister for Agriculture,
whose remarkable knowledge of
constitutional law, and whose irre-
sistible power of debate formed the
strongest bulwark of the ministry of
which for so long a period he was a
member. So far as the actual
activities of life are concerned, Mr.
Hugonin no longer bothers; he
devotes his days to general super -
vision of his picturesque farm, and
to classical literature, on which he
is acknowledged to be a reliable
authority. In public matters he is
regarded as one of those unostenta-
tious workers who do good but blush
to have it known.


WILLIAM HENRY ZIEGEN-
FUSZ, of “Omega,” Cleveland, was
born in 1878 at Oxley, that early
agricultural settlement where so
many sturdy emigrants took up land
MR. KARL FREDERICK ZIEGENFUSZ.
and built up fortunes. His father,
the late Karl Frederick Ziegenfusz,
was a native of Hanover, in Ger-
many, and was brought up to the
trade of weaving. When the con-
script system began to take definite
form, large numbers of Germans who
had conscientious objections to it
emigrated to avoid its galling condi-
tions. Amongst these emigrants
was Mr. W. H. Ziegenfusz’s father,
who, leaving the Fatherland before
he was 21 years of age, sailed for
Queensland in the ship “Prositta,”
arriving early in 1862. In order to
equip himself for the future he had
mapped out, he sought experience
in all classes of bush work—clearing,
scrub-cutting, shepherding, fencing’
ploughing, and kindred toil. Most
of this he did in the Nanango dis-
trict and round about Tarong. At
that time these parts of Queensland
were being tested as to the suitable-
ness for sheep-raising, but the
experiments proving unsuccessful,
they were stocked with cattle, and
to this day they remain largely as
cattle-fattening areas. In due course
Mr. Ziegenfusz took to shearing, and
learned all that was to be learned
in the wool industry. Some years
of hard work and thrifty self-denial
brought him a competence sufficient
to enable him to take up a small
holding at a place known as The
Seventeen-Mile Rocks, so called
because an island of bold rocks stands
in the centre of the Brisbane River,
in the Oxley district, about 12 miles
from the metropolis. Clearing a
considerable area of the land, he
planted maize and potatoes, two
agricultural products for which a
steady and strong local demand
always has existed. His holding
being nearer to Ipswich than to
Brisbane, and of the two places the
former being by far the more
important and prosperous, he made
Ipswich his market. Quite an
ordinary sight in those days was a
small fleet of pulling boats laden
to the gunwales with farm produce
being steadily propelled up the river
by the aid of long sweeps, bound for
the market at Ipswich. In this way
many a hundred boatload of maize
and potatoes did Mr. Ziegenfusz
land at Ipswich. In the course of
time, however, the glory of Ipswich
was eclipsed by the rapidly-increas-
ing expansion of Brisbane, and con-
sequently the prows of the farming
fleet were turned down instead of
up the river, and Brisbane captured
practically the whole of that impor-
tant trade. During these years Mr.
Ziegenfusz brought up a family, and
having done very well he sought
wider fields for his yeoman activities.
He selected Wellington Point, in the
Cleveland district, as his new sphere,
purchasing an area of uncleared
land, covering about 57 acres, down
that way. Sugarcane then was one
of the principal products of the
Cleveland district. Indeed, the first
stool of sugarcane planted in the
State was planted in the south coast
district, and for many years down
there sugarcane-growing held pride
of place. But it was found that the
financial return from sugar wag not

so substantial as was that from other
classes of agricultural produce. Mr.
Ziegenfusz, therefore, abandoning
sugar-growing, turned his attention
to tropical fruit culture, an industry
for which the Cleveland district
has become famous. Pineapples,

bananas, and custard apples brought
in a fine income; and now firmly
established, he launched out into
dairying, which then was becoming
an industry of great magnitude and


importance. Gradually he estab-
lished a magnificent dairy herd, and,
indeed, in 1887 he carried off the
silver cup awarded by the agricul-
tural association for the best dairy
herd in the Moreton Bay district.
The value of land having consider-
ably increased he sold that portion
of his holding for which he had not
any immediate use, the proceeds,
together with his previous savings,
enabling him to retire in com-
fort. In public life his services
as a shire councillor in his dis-
trict extended over 16 years. He
was one of the mainstays of the
Wellington Point Horticultural and
Agricultural and Industrial Society,
and as a member of the Wellington
Point School Committee he did
yeoman service. He died on Sep-
tember 26, 1907, aged 65 years,
leaving a widow and eight grown up
children. His son, Mr, William
Henry Ziegenfusz, was educated at
the Ormiston, Wellington Point,
and Central State Schools, his edu-
cation being completed at the latter
school. He straightway took up work
on his father’s farm, and familiar-
ized himself with every detail of the
he took up a block of unimproved
land, which was then a portion of
the well-known “Thornlands” Estate.

ZIEGENFUSZ, IN 1887, FOR BEST DAIRY

Originally the area was only 47
acres, but he gradually added to it
land, over which Pomona benig-
nantly smiled. Tropical fruits were
the principal products of the farm,
which having a charming easterly
outlook was regarded as one of the
prettiest holdings in the district.
About four years ago, on the crest
of the boom, he disposed of this
property at record price for land in
the district. He then purchased the
holding on which he now lives, which
is comparatively small, covering
only about 18 acres, but which is an
ideal orchard property. On it he
has erected a residence replete with
every modern convenience. Follow-
ing in the footsteps of his worthy
sire, Mr. Ziegenfusz always has
taken warm interest in public affairs.
He followed his father as president
of the Horticultural and Agricul-
tural and Industrial Society, as a
shire councillor, and also as chair-
man of the Thornlands School Com-
mittee; he has the honour of being
acknowledged as the moving spirit
in the school’s inception and com-
pletion. In 1905 he married Emily,
daughter of the late Alfred Langdon,

WILLIAM FRENCH, of “Bad-
gen’s” Nursery, Wellington Point,
in the Cleveland district, was born
at Waternewton, Huntingdonshire,
near Peterborough, England, in
1862. His father, Mr. Edward
French, was one of the best-known
men of his time in Waternewton,
having been in the employ of Mr.
R. Bettison for 55 years. He was
for over 33 years sub-postmaster, and
for 40 years parish clerk and
sexton. He died at the age of
82, on February 18, 1913. Mr.
William French, his son, went to
school at Castor, and subsequently
at Wandsford, England. Leaving
school at 13 years of age, three
years later he went to Sheffield and
obtained employment as a landscape
gardener with Mr. John Newton

Mappin, well known for his pictures
and private art gallery. Finally Mr.
French decided to emigrate, and
sailing by the “Earl of Dalhousie”
late in the year 1880, he
arrived in Brisbane in 1881. At
that time the curator of the Botanic
Gardens in Brisbane was Mr. James
Pink, and in the course of his
leisure hours Mr. French used to
pay regular visits to the gardens,
and thus he became acquainted with
the curator. Mr. Pink, recognizing
that his new acquaintance was a
young man of promise, offered him
a position on the staff, and, of
course, that offer was eagerly
accepted. After four years he was
entrusted with the responsibility of
taking full charge of the propagat-
ing department, and in that position
he remained until his retirement
from the service in 1902. Mr. W.
French claims to have been the first
to propagate and grow the large
water lily (Victoria Regia) out of
doors in Queensland, at the Botanic
Gardens, Brisbane, and the view
reproduced on this page shows a
child seated on a leaf on the surface
of the water. During the last year
of his engagement he acted as
instructor in horticulture and plant
propagation at Gatton College. On
leaving the public service Mr.
French settled at Wellington Point,
where he purchased his present
picturesque home, which at that
time was a well-established nursery.
The property comprises 22 acres of
typical red soil, 14 acres of which
are devoted to nursery work and
vegetables, and also to specializing in
strawberry culture. Mr. French is
the pioneer of vanilla-growing in
Queensland. He has held the post

JOHN HARGREAVES, "Spring

Samuel Hargreaves, was born in
1845 in Farsley, near Leeds, York-
shire, England. When 13 years old,
John Hargreaves left school, and
was apprenticed to his father in the
woollen mill. When 27 years old
he sailed for Australia in the
‘'Colonial Empire,” reaching Mel-
bourne in 1872, and secured a good
position in the Geelong Woollen Mills,
and hie skilled supervision resulted
in the mill’s fabrics carrying off the
gold medal and a certificate of merit

erection of one of the finest woollen
milling plants then obtainable, and
was successful in securing prizes at

turned to storekeeping in Ballarat,
and incidentally to jam manufacture
on a small scale. In 1886 he came
to Brisbane, and at Breakfast Creek
set up a store and factory. Finally
he purchased his present home
near Manly, a property covering
about 320 acres, where 50 acres
are under pines, oranges, tomatoes,
mangoes, and rosellas, while the
jam factory, under the name of
Hargreaves •& Sons, is known far
and wide. In 1870 he mar-
ried Anna, daughter of the late
Charles Noud, of Yorkshire, and has
two daughters and three sons, the
latter being active partners in the
business. His second son invented a
pineapple peeling machine. Mr. Har-

The Brisbane Valley.
Esk and Vicinity.
The township of Esk, which is situated on the
Brisbane Valley railway, 67 miles from the metropolis,
contains a considerable population, official statistics
showing that the number of people in the shire totals
4,000. The district is noted for fertility of soil and
excellent quality of the large quantities of lucerne which
are grown in the neighbourhood, and which conti ibute
extensively to the success which the dairying industry
has attained. The latter is made manifest by the
importance attaching to the Esk Dairy Co-operative Co.,
Limited. The town is well built, and substantial hotels
and business premises illustrate a progress rivalled by
but few centres of similar dimensions.
Portion of the district is devoted to grazing on a
larcm scale, most of the remaining stations being used
for raising and fattening
cattle. But this industry
is rapidly giving place
to the more intensive
activity carried on under
closer settlement; and
the majority of the pre-
sent holdings do not
exceed 640 acres each in
area. These are devoted
to mixed farming, in
which butter production
holds the pride of place.
Originally open forests
covered the land, iron-
bark, blue gum, and other varieties of eucalypts
predominating, but with the extension of agriculture
the timber has been gradually cleared, though enough
has been left to shelter dairy stock from the cold winds
of winter and the hot sun of summer months.
Coominya and Clarendon both lie within the Esk
district, and are on the same line of railway, the former
being 52 and the latter 49 miles from the metropolis.
Fruitgrowing is carried on about both places, whilst
Coominya is well known among cattle-breeders because
of the high-class Herefords which come from the herd
of "Belle Yue” Station, near at hand. Coominya is
also a favourite resort for sporting men, Green Swamp,
which is really a substantial lagoon, being plentifully
stocked both with fish and water fowl, so that those
visiting the spot either with rod or gun rarely depart
disappointed. The country in nearly all directions is
closely divided into fertile and prosperous-looking farms,
on which a great variety of crops is grown, those pre-
dominating probably being lucerne, oats, barley, and
Indian cane, the latter passing by the local name of
"cow cane."
The configuration of the Esk district is picturesque,
the flourishing Brisbane Valley being rimmed with
mountain ranges, of which the outlines take most fan-
tastic shapes, and show a deep purple, which contiasts
pleasingly with the bright green of adjacent fields and
the varied hues of standing crops of many kinds. The
railway was opened from Lowood to Esk on August 9,
1888, and the continuation from Esk to Toogoolawah on
February 8, 1904, the distance of the latter stretch
being 12 miles. During
subsequent years further
extensions were made
until reaching Yarraman
Creek, the present ter-
minus, which is 126 miles
from the capital by rail.
The Esk shire was declared
a local authority on No-
vember 11, 1879, when
the municipal council was
constituted, the body con-
sisting of 12 councillors.
The town contains four
churches, several lodges, a
school of arts, musical union, literary and debating
society, progress association, two racing clubs, and
tennis, football, cricket, and Gordon clubs. The Esk
State school draws an average daily attendance of some-
thing over 150 pupils. Commercially Esk may lay
claim to considerable activity. Besides two banks, a
considerable number of stock and station, commission,
and financial agents are kept busy, whilst the stores
are commodious and ply a constant trade. The town
lies some miles to the west of the Brisbane River, but
rich alluvial flats extend for a considerable distance on
both sides of the banks of the stream. The altitude
of the railway station is 366 feet above sea level, and
as the distance from the sea as the crow flies is not more
than 40 miles, the climate is not dissimilar to that
prevailing along the coastal fringe.

interest clusters round the name, its
representatives having played their
part right worthily in the warlike

business of the ancient clans. From
these sturdy ancestors doubtless was
derived the hardiness of fibre and
power to strive and endure which
distinguished the late intrepid
pioneer, who, impelled by a spirit
of enterprise to seek his fortune in
far distant lands, left the “Bonnie
Scotland” of his forefathers to
found his name and line in a new
and almost untouched country under
the Southern Cross. A native of
Roxborough, the late Mr. Grieve
arrived in New South Wales in
1839, bringing with him a number
of valuable sheep from the Scot-
tish moors. After landing he
proceeded to the Peel River, from
which centre he overlanded his flock
to more northerly areas, and these
arrivals became an important factor
in the building up of the first flocks
raised in Queensland. Subsequently
Mr. Grieve found employment with
the late Mr. Forbes, founder of
“Colinton” Station, several years
later transferring his services to
“Mount Brisbane” Station, then in
possession of Messrs. Frederick and
Francis Bigge. Ultimately, after
many years, during the course of
which he had married and become
the father of a growing family, Mr.
Grieve decided to settle at Ipswich
in order that his children might re-
ceive the best educational advan-
tages offered by that primitive era.
Establishing himself in the butcher-
ing trade, he carried on successfully
for some considerable time, finally
relinquishing business pursuits to
take a position on the “Wivenhoe”
and “Bellevue” Estates, the pro-
perty of the well-known Major
North and his son. Later on he
joined his sons, who were launching
out on a big grazing venture near
Esk, and in the autumn of his life
retired to the home of his eldest son,
Mr. John Grieve, of “Glen How-
den,” where, cheered by filial care
and affection, he passed his declining
years. In 1896 the late Walter
Grieve crossed the Great Divide in
the 82nd year of his age, being sur-
vived by his widow and a family of
five sons and four daughters, one
of whom, Robert, was killed as the
result of an accident at Grantham
in 1916. The late Mrs. Ann Grieve,
who died at “Glen Howden” in
May, 1908, at the advanced age of
85 years, was a niece of the Rev.
James Coutts, founder of the Sailors’
Home, Sydney, and came to Queens-
land with her uncles, John and
Thomas Coutts, who first settled at
Rosewood in 1848, afterwards be-
coming the proprietors of large sta-
tion properties on the Darling
Downs. She married Walter Grieve

institutions. When 11 years old
he gave up his school-books and
started work under the supervision
of his father, his first occupation
being to search for the waifs and
strays of the flocks, hidden in the
young timber and scrub, which as
a result of frequent bush fires sent
up a dense growth and ofttimes ren-
dered the task of the shepherd a
trying and difficult one. The lad
suffered many privations incidental
to his lot as a pioneer stockman’s
son, but undeterred by any of the
drawbacks of his circumstances he
manfully shouldered his portion of
the load and proved the mettle of
which he was made by his steady
perseverance in whatever duty came
to his hand. At this time his father
was employed by the North family
at “Bellevue” and “Wivenhoe,”
whence he removed to the Lowood
district, accompanied by his son,
who later went with him to the
Darling Downs. Droving occupied
a portion of the young man’s time,
and this was varied by other pur-
suits of the bush, until by the time
he arrived at his majority he was
fairly expert in most of the avoca-
tions of the Queensland pioneer. In
the early seventies, when “Colinton”
was thrown open for selection, Mr.
Grieve, in conjunction with his
three brothers, took up a large area
of land, which for over 30 years was
worked by the four partners with
must successful results. In the year
1906 the brothers agreed to divide
the extensive tract of 20,000 acres
which was then being administered
conjointly by them, and in the dis-
tribution which then took place Mr.
John Grieve retained as his portion
the area, comprising about 7,000
acres, surrounding the original
“Glen Howden” homestead, built
in the early days of their occupation
of the property. This holding he
has since devoted to grazing pur-
poses, residing with his family in
the more modern home which,
erected a quarter of a century ago,
has been added to and improved
as necessity has arisen. “Glen
Howden” homestead is pleasantly
situated on a plain, partly
surrounded by a semi-circle of
mountainous hills, heavily wooded
at intervals with useful timbers, and
numerous creeks find their way
down from the gullies between these
hills to the plain below. Among the
watercourses may be specially men-
tioned Emu Creek, which, in this
vicinity, is equal in width to the
Brisbane or Stanley Rivers at those
points in their respective courses
nearest to this district. Mr. Grieve
takes a prominent interest in the
government of the place by means of
the approved organizations and offi-
cial jurisdiction, and is himself a
Justice of the Peace, having exer-
cised his Commission under three
successive sovereigns. He married

father, who was employed among
the stock of “Wivenhoe” and
“Bellevue” Estates, and later, hav-
ing arrived at the age of 14,
proceeded to the Darling Downs,
where he obtained a position as
boundary-rider on the property of the
late Mr. Broadribb, adjoining the
well-known “Cecil Plains” Station.
Here he remained for some six years,
at the end of which period he joined
his three brothers in the selection of
an extensive area of land which for-
merly was included in the boun-
daries of “Colinton” Station, and
inaugurated grazing operations on
a fairly large scale. In course of
time a very big tract of country
was secured by the partners,
who watched their opportunity to
acquire suitable holdings, and among
the landed interests which eventu-
ally came under their control was a
wide block of territory in the vicin-
ity of Mount Stanley, which has
since become well known as “Ellen-
dale,” and “Bearmong,” adjoining

James G. Grieve, upon his
marriage, also relinquished
his connection with the
old home and took up his
residence at “Ellendale,”
where he remained for
about a decade. By the
end of this period his
children were beginning to
require the advantages of
a public-school education,

with his wife and two sons, he first
obtained employment with Mr.
Donald M’Kenzie, of Cunningham
Gap, Darling Downs. Subsequently
he became one of the best-known
pioneer carriers between Ipswich and
the Burnett and Dawson districts,
and followed this calling for many
years with success, having at one
time as many as five teams on the
roads. During this period his family
always accompanied him on his trips,
preferring the discomforts of travel-
ling rather than the otherwise un-
avoidable separation involved. Occa-
sionally exciting incidents occurred
on these journeys. The notorious
bushranger, “The Wild Scotchman,”
was met with by Mr. Peters on more
than one occasion, while the murder
of the Frazer family at “Hornet
Bank” Station, in 1857, created a

connection with the latter tragedy,
the Government of the day being
unable to cope with the situation,
the settlers themselves formed a
party and meted out justice to
the black murderers in wholesale
fashion, scouring the entire district
in pursuit of their design. Of this
avenging party Mr. Peters formed a
member, having first secured his own
family within barred and locked
doors for safety. On another occa-
sion he was attacked by the blacks
at “Wivenhoe,” and narrowly es-
caped being speared, the weapon
missing him by only a few inches.
After leaving the roads, Mr. Peters
spent a brief period in the cotton-
growing industry at Walloon, but
being unable to secure sufficient sup-
port abandoned this project. Shortly
afterwards, being attracted by the
splendid grazing country at Galla-
nani Creek, he selected, in the first

his descendants. He died on March
18, 1905, his widow surviving to the
advanced age of over 102 years. The
subject of this review, Mr. John


Peters, in his early youth attended
school for a brief period at Ipswich,
but received his education mainly
from his mother, and during the
development of the original home-
stead block he threw himself with
considerable activity into the work
of assisting his father in the mani-
fold duties pertaining thereto. This
having been satisfactorily completed,
he left the paternal homestead and
for a time was engaged in the occu-
pations incidental to bush life, be-
coming a familiar figure in the shear-
ing-sheds and as a drover on the
stock routes for some fifteen years.
After his marriage he entered the
employ of the late William Bowman
as stockman on “Mount Brisbane”
station, a position he filled for 11
years, eventually selecting land on
his own account and carrying on in
the timber industry with success.
When his father’s health began to
fail, Mr. John Peters returned to
the old home and took over the
reins of management, the older
gentleman continuing to reside with
his son during his declining years.
The property ultimately reverting to
him, he has since worked it as an
independent proposition, with the
assistance of his sons, who relin-
quished the business of timber-cart-

successfully engaged, for the purpose
of uniting with their father in build-
ing up a thoroughly prosperous

is made from Esk township, whence
it is reached after a three-mile drive
along the main road between that
centre and Crow’s Nest, and the
whole of the estate is contained
within the one boundary, with the
exception of a small block of land
situated on Eskdale Creek. Mr.
Peters has always taken a deep
interest in the public welfare of the
district, and has been a prominent
supporter of various agricultural
societies, exhibiting at the National
Show, Brisbane, and at local
functions of a similar nature, with
considerable success. He has always
been recognized as one of the crack
horsemen of the district, and on a
recent occasion at the Toowoomba
Show was accorded a special pre-
sentation by the Governor for horse-
manship display. He was married
on March 17, 1877, to his first
cousin, Elizabeth Ann Peters,
daughter of the late George Peters,
who landed in Queensland from the
Old Country in the year 1873. The
wedding ceremony, which was per-
formed by the Rev. David Watt,
the pioneer Presbyterian minister of
Esk, assumed peculiar interest from
the fact of its being the first celebra-
tion of this nature in that township.
The late George Peters resided with
his brother Thomas at “Gallanani”
for some time after his arrival in
this State, subsequently becoming
connected with station pursuits at
“Nukinenda” Station, which he
managed on behalf of Messrs. Ord
Brothers. He was afterwards en-
gaged in carrying from Ipswich to
Esk, Cressbrook, and other places,
and among other actions for which
he is remembered was the building of
the first private residence in Esk.
He remained in this neighbourhood
until 1902, removing thence to Bris-
bane, where he died a couple of
years later, leaving three sons
and five daughters. The late
Georg© Peters was highly re-
spected in the district where
he spent so many years of his
life, and upon his removal was re-
gretted by a wide circle of friends.
To Mr. John Peters and his wife

first opened his eyes to the light at
Ipswich, Queensland, on July 14,
1860. He is a son of the late
Kyranus Copley, who emigrated
from Kinturk, County Cork, Ire-
land, in 1850, with his late brother,
Pierce, who afterwards became well
known as the owner of the old
"Crow’s Nest,” Station in the early
days of pastoral pioneering in the
north-eastern areas of the vast but
little-explored island-continent of
the southern hemisphere. Kyranus
Copley first landed in Victoria,
where he gained his initial experi-
ence of colonial conditions, but after
remaining there for some time was
attracted to the still newer, less-
developed country lying near the
equator, where the settlement of
Moreton Bay had been formed.
Proceeding to Ipswich, he immedi-
ately found plenty of scope for his
energies in the pastoral and grazing
industries, beginning operations on
a modest scale on the Seven-Mile
Creek, in the vicinity of the moun-
tain range which flanks the town on
its western side. Here he continued
until his death, which occurred in
1862, only two years after the birth
of his youngest son, the subject of
this notice, and subsequently the
property was sold, the widowed
mother and her children taking up
their abode at Ipswich. Mr. James
Copley is able to trace his ancestry
back for many generations in County
Cork, and is justly proud of the
honour of claiming as his heritage
the blood which coursed through the
veins of the Irish Liberator, the
famous Daniel O’Connell, his grand-
uncle on the paternal side, than
whom no name among loyal Irish-
men is or ever shall be more revered.
It is only fitting, in passing, to pay
a tribute to the memory of Ireland’s
greatest son, who emancipated an
oppressed nation and freed it from
the chains of religious oppression
with which it had been shackled for
so many years. To mention that the
name of Mr. Copley’s mother was
Ellen O’Donovan is to claim that,
on the distaff side of the family also,
no purer Celtic blood could be de-
sired by any descendant anxious to
prove the purity of his line, and this
integrity is perhaps specially en-
hanced by the circumstance that
this lady’s family hailed from that
centre of warm Hibernian loyalty,

may here be recorded to his credit

with Messrs. Bigge Brothers ex-
tended over the period embraced
between 1879 and 1885, in which
latter year a portion of the property
was thrown open for selection,
Availing himself of the opportunity
thus afforded, Mr. Copley took up,
in the first instance, about 1,000
acres of the land with which by this
time he had become thoroughly
acquainted and could estimate at its
right value. To this area he has
since added by purchase, gradually
building up a fine estate, until at

and timbered with gum and apple-
tree, belts of trees crowning the
ridges, while on the river flats the
forest giants stretch their huge limbs
in still greater freedom. Much of
this timber is most suitable for fenc-
ing and other general utility pur-
poses, proving very valuable in this
direction, as well as providing excel-
lent shelter for the stock, both from
the heat of summer sun and from
the violence of semi-tropical storms.
The pasture land is rich in quality
and capable of supporting as many
head of stock to the acre as the best
grazing areas in the State. Mr.
Copley has made somewhat of a name
for himself by his successful breeding
of pure Hereford cattle, to the pro-
duction of which he has devoted a
great deal of time and attention,
using the best blood procurable, in
pursuance of which policy he has
selected imported stock as sires for
his herd. As a result of this expert
care and management he has
attained a pre-eminence among the
settlers of the West Moreton district,
few of whom can exhibit stock of
merit equal to that of the “Stanley
House’ ’ Estate, which almost invari-
ably commands top prices when
offered for sale. Mr. Copley has
also established a reputation as a
good judge of equine excellence, and
breeds a few horses, principally
blood stock of first-class type. His
experience on “Mount Brisbane” has
stood him in good stead in this
department of his enterprise, that
station formerly being noted for
raising the best horses in Queensland,
and the knowledge gained in this
good school during earlier days
he has augmented by practical
experiment in an effective manner.
The homestead, originally erected in
1888, was added to in 1909, and in
general arrangement and design has
been planned more for comfort and
convenience than for picturesque
effect, though it is far from wanting
in pleasantness of aspect. The
dwelling contains 13 rooms, in which
thorough ventilation has been made
an important feature, and from the
ample verandahs may be viewed the
garden, with its flower-pots and
shade trees, beyond which orchard
growths flourish lustily, the useful
and ornamental each having its due
place in the grounds, which spread
over a considerable area of land.
The home overlooks a vista of pros-
perous country, upon which grazing
kine and symmetrical horses add to
the rural picture which has been
made possible by the years of strenu-
ous, faithful work put in by Mr.
Copley since first he took up the
unimproved holding and set himself
to achieve the ideal which has now
become the actual, and the fitting
reward in the autumn of his life of
those labours by which in “the sweat
of his brow” he made good. Like
the other pioneers of the district, he
had his full share of rough experi-
ences, years of drought befalling

when the efforts and accomplish-
ments of many seasons were all
brought to naught, and these were


followed by devastating floods when
even the small vestiges that re-
mained were hardly saved from the
general wreck and ruin. He has won
through by sheer force of determina-
tion not to be worsted in the fight,
and his prosperity has been earned
and deserved to the last ounce. Mr.
Copley is keenly interested in sport,
and for the past ten years has filled
the post of honorary judge in con-
nection with all the race clubs in
the vicinity of Stanley River district.
He is a true lover of a good horse,
and has raced himself with some
success, his colours frequently being

many years. He received his educa-
tion at the national school in his
native town, and upon the termina-
tion of his studies continued for
some time under his father’s roof-
tree, following agricultural occupa-
tions on the home property. Upon
attaining manhood’s estate, Mr.
O’Brien decided to seek his fortune
in far-distant lands, and after due
consideration of the relative attrac-
tions offered by the different British
colonies his choice of a destination
ultimately fell upon Australia.
This was chiefly owing to the inde-
fatigable efforts of the late Bishop
O’Quinn, first Roman Catholic pre-
late of Queensland, to secure suit-
able emigrants from his own native
land to people the country of his
adoption with settlers drawn from
the better-class population of the
Emerald Isle. Upon arrival at
Moreton Bay by the sailing vessel
“Mangerton” in 1862 he was suc-
cessful in obtaining employment at
“Clifton” Station, on the Darling
Downs, where he remained for about
three years, following avocations
incidental to the handling and
management of stock and gaining
the experience necessary to fit him
for independent enterprise. Two
years after his advent to Queensland
he found himself in a position to
launch out on his own account, and
the cotton-growing industry being at
that time in a more or less flourish-
ing condition, he determined to
inaugurate operations in this de-
partment of enterprise. Having in-
spected a block of land in the virgin
country of Bald Ridges, which up
to that time had been untouched by
the selector, but now well known as
the prosperous farming district of
Glamorgan Vale, he took up the
holding, becoming the first settler
in that vicinity, and later father of
the first white child born in the
district—Mr. Patrick J. O’Brien—
May 14, 1868. Prosperity attended
his efforts in the direction of cotton
cultivation, and during the five
years that he devoted his energies
to this industry he was able to lay
aside a portion of his profits, thus
providing for a bigger venture when
the popularity of cotton as a
Queensland product declined. In
1877 Mr. O’Brien selected a block
of grazing land on the “Mount Bris-
bane” run, which had been thrown
open for selection, and this holding
he stocked with a few dairy cows,
from which he began to breed, soon
owning a nice little herd. Various
difficulties beset his way, among
which the marketing of produce
alone called for the exercise of a
sturdy quality of fibre. Instances

in 1882 the property, which was
then a cattle station embracing the
country within a radius of many
miles, came under the control of the

cipally as a stock depot in connec-
tion with other pastoral properties
owned by the company. When

“Buaraba” was subdivided for closer
settlement purposes in the late
nineties it was in possession of a
Mr. Ross, who had acquired the
property in its entirety from the
National Bank, which institution
had purchased it a considerable time
previously. Mr. Ross retained the
homestead and surrounding area
until 1914, when he disposed of it
to Mrs. Dolan, who now resides
there with her family. Being one of
the oldest established properties in
the State, “Buaraba” has a certain
historic importance, and it is attrac-
tive besides on account of the pic-
turesque old home, with its lawns
and garden, where well-grown shrubs
are interspersed with flowers and
fruit trees. The country is well
wooded, and abounds in natural
grasses, making it excellent for
grazing pastures, to which purpose
the 3,000 acres surrounding the
homested are applied. Cattle breed-
ing is carried on successfully,
a Hereford-shorthorn cross being
favoured by Mr. Cecil Dolan, who
controls affairs on the estate, whilst
residing at “Sandville,” the old
home of the family, 10 miles distant.
The late husband of Mrs. Dolan, Mr.
John Dolan, whose death occurred
in 1913, was one of those hardy
Queensland pioneers who, bred from
sturdy Irish stock in the Parish of
Kells, County Meath, Ireland, left
his native country over half a
century ago, eventually to become
one of the best known and most
respected settlers in the Northern
State. As a judge of cattle he was
held in the greatest respct, and for
years he was one of the most success-
ful competitors in the show rings
whilst in charge of the stock on
“Buaraba” Station, which position
he occupied for 16 years before
taking up land for himself on the
Tarampa end of the Buaraba Creek,
where he purchased a farm of 232
acres as far back as 1889. Subse-
quently Mr. Dolan acquired addi-
tional country, and at the time of
his death owned over 2,000 acres,

which with the “Buaraba” property
is still held by the family. Mrs.
Dolan, who is a daughter of the late
Charles O’Shannessy, of King’s
County, Ireland, came to Queensland
in 1883, and shortly after arrival
married the late John Dolan, the
issue of the union being seven
children, of whom three sons and
three daughters survive. The eldest
son, Cecil, was born at Brisbane on
February 5, 1886, and was educated
at a local school. He obtained his
experience in farming under the
guidance of his father, and after the
decease of the latter gentleman took
over the practical management of
the estate, his mother attending to
the financial side of the proposition.
The second son, Mr. William John
Dolan, who is married, farms a pro-
perty adjoining “Buaraba,” while
the youngest son and two daughters
are still at college completing their
education. Miss Dolan, the eldest
daughter, resides with her mother at
“Buaraba.”
STEPHEN SMITH, “Glenmore,”
Coominya, was born in the parish of
Kilincahir, County Cavan, Ireland,
on December 26, 1843, being the
youngest member of the family of
the late Peter Smith, who came of
a long line of farmers in that part
of the Emerald Isle. Very few


educational advantages were at the
disposal of young Ireland of that
day, and what little book-learning
fell to the lot of Mr. Smith was
obtained at a local school, while from
his earliest years he was pressed into
service on his father’s farm to under-
take the many duties for which a
child was fitted. In this way he
grew up to manhood well equipped
in the matter of farming experience,
and having attained his twenty-fifth
year married Sarah, daughter of a
Philip Smith of the same place, who
also, though not of the same family,
was descended from an old farming
ancestry of that locality. Stephen
Smith continued to live at the old
home for seven years afer his mar-
riage, and during this period had
his attention drawn to Australia
through a married sister, the late
Mrs. Treagle, a colonist of some
years’ standing, who had been living
at Ipswich. Feeling confident that
better prospects awaited the man of
enterprise and industry in the new,
comparatively unpeopled country
than could ever be held out by the
land of his birth, Mr. Smith with his
wife and three children sailed from
Ireland in May, 1876, and in due
course arrived in Queensland. His
first knowledge of local conditions
•was obtained on “Buaraba” Station,
the then proprietor of that station.
In 1879, whilst engaged in this way,
he took up a homestead block, which

chldren took up their abode, and
the work of improvement was begun,
proceeding slowly but surely until
eventually Mr. Smith saw his way
he brought to bear tireless industry
united to an expert knowledge of the
work in hand to the task, and
reaped a speedy reward in the
success that attended his labours,
Ilis original holding of 160 acres had
been taken up from the Government
at half-a-crown per acre, showing the
valuable assistance given to settlers
in those early days, and as his pros-
perity became more assured he was
able to purchase an adjoining farm
of the same acreage, for which he
paid at the rate of £2 per acre.
Subsequently he took up additional
territory on the “Buaraba” run, and
at the present time has about 4,000
acres, about a third of which is
freehold land, the whole being
devoted to the grazing of cattle and
horses. The homestead, which was
built in 1902 to replace the original
slab structure which formed the
family dwelling-place for many
years, is one of cosy comfort, con-
taining 12 rooms and spacious veran-
dahs, while its situation is both
picturesque and convenient, being
four miles from Coominya, which is
the nearest railway station on the
Esk line. Mr. and Mrs. Smith have

ROGER HANRAHAN, “Galty

MR. ROGER HANRAHAN.
County Cork, Ireland, his native
parish being the historic Mitchels-
town, where also he received his
education, being a student at the
Christian Brothers’ College there for
a number of years. At the age of
15 he left school, and being the
eldest of the family naturally turned
to the assistance of his father, who,
like his ancestors before him for
hundreds of years, carried on farm-
ing pursuits in the above-mentioned
set his face toward southern climes,
sailing for Queensland by the "Duke
of Buckingham,” a vessel which will
be well remembered by many Aus-
tralian pioneers. Upon arrival in
this State almost from the outset
he became associated with one of the
oldest-established settlers in the
person of Mr. D. Shine, of Ipswich,
with whom he secured employment
in the agricultural industry, being
chiefly engaged in the cultivation of
lucerne. The connection thus begun
continued without a break for 15
years, and during this period he
acquired a small holding at Glamor-
gan Vale, which he disposed of after
a few years. Subsequently, in 1898,
he selected the property now known
as "Verdant Valley,” which he was
fortunate enough to secure by ballot
against 32 competitors. Three years
later, having held the position of
foreman for Mr. Shine for a decade,
into possession of “Galty More,” and
for over 10 years has made his home
in the comfortable modern residence
erected 11 years ago, and situated
two miles distant from Coominya

land surrounding this homestead

Mr. Hanrahan was for many years

nian Society; and he takes a deep

as a cattle proposition. At a later

Captain ROBERT VERNOR,
J.P., “Cluen,” Vernor, is the eldest
son of the late James Alexander
Vernor, of Carberry Hill, Head,
Midlothian, Scotland, where he was
MR. JAMES ALEXANDER VERNOR.
born on January 30, 1837. The
family of Vernor dates back for some
hundreds of years, records existing
which show that from very early
days its members have been dis-
tinguished for their valour, choosing
the sword as their profession, and
occupying prominent commissions in
the British Army. Captain Ver-
nor’s great-grandfather was captain
in the 66th Regiment of Foot, and
his grandfather was a major in the
Scots Greys, shedding his blood on
the ever famous field of Waterloo
while in command of his squadron,
after which memorable event, being
disabled, he was retired with dis-
tinction. The subject of this article
was educated at Loretto School, the
Edinburgh Academy, and the Royal
Military Academy, which then had
its headquarters in Scotland’s ancient
capital. The representative of a
family of athletes, he distinguished
himself throughout his school and
college career by carrying off many
trophies in the recreation field, and
continued to excel in this direction
when faced with the wider competi-
tion of the military academy. Upon
leaving the latter institution he was
appointed in August, 1854, to the
88th Regiment, Connaught Rangers,
as ensign (the second lieutenant of
modern times), having previously
been captain of the cadets at the
Royal Military Academy, which
saved him all the initial drudgery
of drill. In February, 1855, he
ddd2
became lieutenant, and was gazetted
to a captaincy in June, 1860. The
Crimean War was in full swing at
the time that young Vernor entered
the army, and at the beginning of
January, 1855, he received his
marching orders, and with Lieuten-
ant E. A. Perceval started for the
front in charge of a draft of 100
men. Proceeding to Southampton
by train, they embarked on board
the s.s. “Canadian,” having about
1,000 men on the boat, drawn from
various regiments. Balaclava Har-
bour was reached after a run of 14
days, including stoppages, which was
the second fastest passage made
during the war, and after the com-
fort and luxury of a pleasant voyage
in a good vessel the soldiers were
plunged straightway into the hard-
ships and privations of camp life in

freezing weather, with salt beef, ship
biscuits, and bad tea, or coffee
berries, and a ration of rum as their
only food. On the second day a
thaw set in, which made matters
worse, everything being reduced to a
state of sloppiness and mud, and an
alarm having been given the youthful
lieutenant, who as senior officer was
practically in control of about 500
recruits, had all his men under
arms for the greater part of the
night. The alarm proved to be a
false one, and after about a week’s
delay the order came to proceed to
the front. The march of seven miles
to the camp of their regiment took
the whole of the day, and was a
most unpleasant experience on
account of the mud and slush, which
in some places was knee-deep. At
this time things were at their worst
on the field, and the men who had
been out for the whole time were
suffering from insufficient clothing
and bad food—green coffee berries
being served out as rations. Never-
theless, there was no grumbling, and
every soldier stuck to his work as
long as he was able to hold out.
Lieutenant Vernor, like the other
officers of his rank, was allowed
forage for one horse, and he was
fortunate in securing a nice white
Turkish pony of Arab blood, which
he named “Little Jack,” and kept
throughout the campaign, riding
him in the final march to Karaiesch,
when they re-embarked for old Eng-
land. Here, there being no pur-
chasers for horses, all the steeds
which had done such good service
during the war were turned loose,
and doubtless became the property
of Russian or Tartar masters.
Lieutenant Vernor found the work
in the trenches very hard and
monotonous, and welcomed his first
adventure, which occurred on the
night of the Great Sortie, on
March 27, 1855, when he was
ordered to the front line of trenches
with 50 men, and narrowly escaped
the peril of a 13-inch shell which
exploded within a few yards of him.
On another occasion, in command
of the same number he opened up
the most advanced trench before
Redan, for which he was publicly

thanked in general orders by the
commander-in-chief, and 'with
several of his men was recommended
by his chief for the Victoria Cross.
This recommendation, though richly


deserved, failed to gain the neces-
sary endorsement from the officer in
command at the time of the regi-
ment’s return to England, when the
comparatively small recognition of
the Order of the Medijie was given
to the lieutenant, and the French
War Medal to two of his men.
After the action referred to he was
placed in command of a company,
and at the attack on the Redan on
June 18 was in reserve in the 21-
gun battery, and under a heavy fire
had a splendid view of all that took
place. In the final assault on Sep-
tember 8 his company, being at the
front, suffered heavy losses, and
Lieutenant Vernor was slightly
wounded. At a later date he was
an eye-witness of the blowing up of
the French magazine, which he

describes as a magnificent but awful
sight. After the Battle of Tchernya,
in which the French and Sardinians
only were engaged, he and Captain
Pearson were the first two redcoats
on the field, but being fired upon
with grape by the Russians from the
Mackenzie Heights had to retire
from their work of carrying water
to the wounded. On June 9, 1856,
the march to Kamiesch took place,
20 bands playing the homeward-
bound soldiers out of camp and
almost to port, where they embarked
on board the “Belle Isle,” an old
sailing man-o’-war, and anchored off
Spithead on June 18. When Lieu-
tenant Vernor, after a short trip to
Scotland, rejoined his regiment they
were in camp at Aldershot, where
they remained for the next nine
months, the work being heavy on
account of the number of reviews.
In May of the following year the
regiment left Aldershot for Ports-
mouth, preparatory to their leaving
for India, and in July embarked
with the headquarters of the
Rangers in the “Surrey,” doing the
journey to Calcutta in 100 days. As
the railway up country from Cal-
cutta was only completed about 20
miles, the detachment of two com-
panies travelled day and night by
bullock “dawk” to Cawnpore, where
they arrived on November 25, 1857,
after a journey of 21 days. Here
they found a few small detachments
fresh from home reinforcing the
64th Regiment, which was garrison-
ing the fort. Although mustering
less than 700 bayonets, with no
cavalry, and only two big ship guns,
which were useless for want of car-
riage, General (Redan) Windham
decided to attack the Gwalior
contingent, consisting of 30,000 well-
drilled men, with plenty of artillery
and cavalry. A spirited engagement
took place, as a result of which the
rebels were driven back several miles
from Cawnpore, only to return at
daylight the following morning, when
they peppered the camp with round
shot and grape from three sides for
several hours, in the course of which
the adjutant was wounded, and
Lieutenant Yernor was asked to take
his place pro tern. Upon the report
of a spy that the rebels were in the
town and had taken possession of
the bridges of boats over the Ganges,
connecting Cawnpore with Lucknow,
General Windham ordered the 88th
to follow the spy and retake the
bridge at any cost. In pursuance of
this order the Rangers discovered
the rebels, to the number of some
thousands, in the open space in the
city preparing their dinners, and
after some smart bayonet work three
or four hundred dead were all that
were left of the party, which num-
bered about 300 to 1 man of the
attackers. During the ensuing night
watch over the bridges the 88th had
a good deal of trouble from the
rebels, and Lieutenant Vernor as
adjutant proposed to the colonel to
rush the two field guns which they
had set up, with a score of men.
Receiving permission, he took 20
men of his own company (the Grena-
diers) with loaded rifles and fixed
bayonets, and sneaking up behind
any cover they could find, when
within 50 yards fired a volley and
rushed the guns, to find that with
the exception of a few dead gunners
the rebels had disappeared. After
spiking the guns the party returned,
without a man killed or wounded.
During the following days Lieuten-
ant Vernor had what he describes as
“the hardest week’s work in his life,”
as besides doing the work of adju-
tant he took the place of the
general’s A.D.C., who was sick and
unable for duty. With an opposing
force of 30,000, the British had not
more than 600 bayonets, and the
young officer had to inspect every
member of the pickets, guards, and
working parties—which were being
continually changed—before they
went on duty, so that he never got
more than an hour’s sleep at a time.
The rebels opened fire from field-
pieces on tops of the bouses, and
being ordered by the general to
silence these guns, he picked out 30
good shots, and crept up the canal
by a wall about 2 feet high until
about 200 yards opposite the guns,
when their first volley killed or
wounded every man who was work-
ing the guns. After holding the
road to Calcutta and the bridge of
boats, which was of great value as
the connecting link with Lord Clyde
at Lucknow, relief came with the
latter general himself in command,
and after three days’ hard fighting
the rebels were properly defeated.
The district had still to be watched,
however, and the 88th, among others,
were told off for the duty. Eventu-
ally a sharp fight at a place called
Calpee ended the trouble here for a
time, and the regiment was ordered


to Lucknow, where it arrived
after a forced march of about 30
miles in one day, during which
Lieutenant Vernor, who was in
charge of the baggage guard, had
a bad time of it with the heat,
breakdowns, and unruly elephants
and camels. To their great dis-
appointment an hour after arrival
they were ordered to return, as the
watch left had been outnumbered
and were retiring on Cawnpore.
This attack was quelled without
firing a shot, and after the arrival
of Sir Hugh Rose with the Central
India Field Force Calpee was taken,
and the men were ordered into can-
tonment at Cawnpore. Here three-
fourths of them were laid up with

WON BY CAPTAIN ROBERT VERNOR.
fever and cholera, and Lieutenant
Vernor being one of the only two sub-
alterns not on the sick list, for weeks
had to take alternate days on regi-
mental duty—no joke in an Indian
summer. Subsequently, during a
monotonous six months at Newab-
gunge, the Battle of Selimpore made
a welcome break, this being a well-
designed affair, with a very success-
ful ending, as it ended the Mutiny
at Oude. About this time India was
taken over by the Crown from the
"Old John Company,” and the
Queen proclaimed Empress, on
which occasion there were celebra-
tions of all kinds, in connection with
which Lieutenant Vernor acted as
hon. secretary, and had a very busy
time. The march to Delhi following
shortly afterwards proved a delight-
ful event to the young subaltern, as
being free to follow his own devices
he got a good deal of sport on the
way, and thoroughly enjoyed the
five weeks taken up by the march.
Lieutenant Vernor spent two years
at Delhi, during which he received
his commission of captain, and in
the spring of 1862 passed a sojourn
at Meerut, where he was detained
for general court martial. Being
the champion runner of his
regiment he distinguished himself
in this way on various occasions,
in which great interest was
taken: and at Moradabad, his
next station, a quiet time
was relieved by shooting,
cricketing, and a few race
meetings. After further
removals he found himself
back at Cawnpore, where
he met old mates after two
years’ separation, and six
months later sold his com-
mission and bade farewell
to India about the middle
of December, 1864. In
connection with the career
of Captain Vernor in India
an extract from “The
Crimean Campaign,” a book
published by Lieutenant-
Colonel Stevens, late of
the 20th Regiment and the
famous 88th (Connaught
Rangers) is of interest. He
reprints a letter from Lieu-
tenant-Colonel Packenham,
by order of the lieutenant-
general in command, in
which he says he “has
received with much satis-
faction a report from the
engineer officer -in - charge
stating the admirable man-
ner in which a working party of
the 88th Regiment under the
command of Lieutenant Vernor
performed their duty under heavy
fire from the enemy,” further thank-
ing Lieutenant Vernor and acknow-
ledging his service and that of the
men under his command. In 1866
Captain Vernor came to Queensland,
and purchased the “Cluen” property,
where he now resides, consisting of
1,000 acres of land, which he has
worked as a grazing and mixed-farm-
ing proposition. He has now (1915)
well-nigh completed his half century
of Australian life, and is looked
upon as the patriarch of his district,
where long ago his name was given
to the infant settlement. During
this lengthy period he has witnessed
many changes, and suffered vicissi-
tudes of a varied nature. A narrow
escape of his family was chronicled
at the time of the 1893 great flood,
as follows:—"Among the many inci-
dents of the February floods in
Southern Queensland not one pre-
sents more exciting features than the
peril and rescue of the family of
Captain Robert Vernor, on the
Upper Brisbane River. The house
is situated on the southern bank of
the river, near Vernor railway
station, on the Brisbane Valley line,
about 20 miles from Ipswich. The
household was composed of eight
persons, who embarked on a punt a
little before 6 p.m. on February 3,
and endeavoured to make fast to a
tree and await the subsidence of the
water. The punt, however, went
broadside on to the branches of a
gumtree, and capsized, the people
being left struggling in the water.
About noon next day Captain
Vernor noticed someone moving on
the opposite bank, and cooeed, with
the result that the spot was soon
alive with people, who, however,
were unable to rescue their neigh-
bours on the tree-tops as no boats
were available. Messengers started
across the mountain, and gave the
alarm at Lowood, and by evening
two punts came down the river and
reached Vernor, shooting across the
angry tumult of waters. The cold,
hungry, and exhausted people were
soon got into them, escaping miracu-
lously after 24 hours’ exposure.”
Captain Vernor, who was appointed
a Justice of the Peace in 1870,
has served on the shire council, and
for some years was chairman of the
divisional board, takes a leading
part in public affairs of the place,
and inaugurated the first race meet-
ing in the district. For a time he
engaged in the breeding of blood
stock, having a valuable stud of over
60 horses, which, with over 150
cattle, were swept away by the big
flood. His only son, Robert William
Harlin, who manages the estate for
his father, has revived this interest,
and has again established a good
stud. Captain Vernor married in
1868 Sara, daughter of the late
William Harlin, of Rosevale,
County Down, Ireland, and sister of
Mr. Thomas Harlin, M.A., first
headmaster of Brisbane Boys’ Gram-
mar School. Besides the son before
mentioned, there are four daughters
of the marriage.

earlier years at that centre, where
he carried on the business of
timber merchant. His health fail-
ing, he decided to try the
benefits of a milder climate,
and having received from an elder
brother, who had spent some years
in Australia, favourable reports of
the climate of Queensland, which he
infant settlement of Brisbane was
then generally called. Leaving
Liverpool on May 12, after a long
but pleasant voyage they reached
their destination on September 8,
and the boat anchoring at the mouth
of the river newspapers were brought
on board containing blood-curdling
reports of the shocking murder of
the Fraser family committed by the
blacks at “Hornet Bank” Station.
These accounts so alarmed Mrs.
Thomson that she declined to leave
the vessel, but was at length pre-
vailed upon to board the tender
which conveyed the passengers up
the river to the city wharves, and
for a time they were accommodated
in a house situated near the Botanic
Gardens. Here, however, the aborigi-
nals were a good deal in evidence,
and matters were pushed ahead to
obtain information with regard to a
suitable locality where land might
be taken up for pastoral purposes.
Upon the advice of the Bishop,
inspection was made of certain hold-
ings in the West Moreton district,
where the Government had resumed

their home and fortune occupied her
close attention no less than that of
her husband, who was perhaps more
in his element as a merchant than as
a pastoralist. Mrs. Thomson was an
excellent rider and a good judge of
Boys’ Grammar School for scholastic
instruction, remaining at this insti-
tution until 16 years of age. He
then spent a couple of years in look-
ing after the stock on his father’s
estate, "Wivenhoe,” which upon the
division of property made by the
late Peter Thomson before his death
fell to the lot of Mr. James Thomson
and his younger brother as their
share of the paternal estate. The
conduct of the property was then
carried on on his own account by the

SEPTIMUS NORTH, of “Wiven-
hoe,” Fernvale, was born in the
locality where he now resides, his
actual birthplace being on a spot
only a short distance from the pre-
sent “Wivenhoe” homestead, where
he first opened his eyes to the light
on January 4, 1856. Hie father, the
late Lieutenant Joseph North, an
officer of the Queen’s Light Infantry
of Foot, originally came from the
North of Ireland, where for some
hundi’eds of years his family had
been established. Lieutenant North
sold his commission in the army with
the object of entering upon pastoral
enterprise at some outpost of empire
overseas, and in pursuance of this
purpose his choice fell upon Queens-
land, at that time officially known
as the Moreton Bay District of New
South Wales, its separation from
the Mother State not yet having
taken place. The Imperial Govern-
ment took advantage of his coming
to entrust to his charge a band of
prisoners who were being transported
to the penal settlement at Moreton
Bay, which was then used chiefly as
a depot for this purpose. At that
period convicts were often serving

to Australia. Eventually, however,
he found these duties were prevent-
ing him from carrying out the pur-
pose upon which his mind was set,
resigning from the service he pro-
ceeded to the Ipswich district to select
a property for this purpose. His
attention was attracted by the situa-
tion, soil, and general possibilities of
the locality of “Fernie Lawn,” and
settling down on this territory he
devoted a number of years to the
cattle-raising industry and other pas-
toral pursuits. During this period
his father, the late Major North,
who held a commission in the same
regiment to which his son formerly
belonged, followed the example of
the latter, and retiring from the
Army crossed the seas from Ireland
to take up land under the Southern
Cross. Upon his arrival a partner-
ship was agreed upon between father
and son, Major North going into
residence at Bellevue, where he
became deeply interested in wool and
mutton-producing on a fairly exten-
sive scale, while “Fernie Lawn” was
continued as a cattle proposition.

solved by mutual consent the older
man retired to Ipswich, where he

namely, the founding of a home for
himself and future generations in
the country which he had chosen
as the land of his adoption, and
who should come after him. The
present estate of “Wivenhoe” formed
a portion of the original “Fernie
Lawn” run, but when the large


properties of the district were being
cut up for purposes of closer settle-
ment this particular area passed into
other hands. It was, however,
shortly afterwards repurchased by
Lieutenant Joseph North, who
retained it with other holdings,
among which was pre-eminent the
“Fernie Lawn” homestead property,
until the time of his death. The late
pastoralist brought up a family of
eight sons and two daughters, four
of the former becoming pioneers in
sheep and cattle raising in the
northern parts of the State, thus
following in the steps of both father
and grandsire, and demonstrating
the sturdy quality of the stock from
which they sprang by their hardi-
hood and power to grapple with the
obstacles in their way to success. It
is worthy of remark in this connec-
tion that among the dangers encoun-
tered by the sons of Joseph North
in their work of opening up the
country for the pastoral industry was
the continual jeopardy in which they
passed their days and nights on
account of the savage tribes of blacks
every case these brave settlers made
good, and those of them who are still
surviving are able to live in peace
and prosperity, enjoying the fruits
of their erstwhile strenuous labours.

Mr. Septimus North, the son of his
father, was educated privately under
a tutor at “Fernie Lawn,” and as

demise of his father Mr. Septimus
North, having received his patri-
mony in the shape of the area known
as “Wivenhoe,” came to reside upon
the property, and has since promi-

MR. HUGH CONROY.
a son of the late Thomas Conroy, a
native of Connaught, Ireland, who,
as a member of the 17th Foot, was
among the first of the soldiers of
the Imperial Army drafted to India
when the British Parliament origin-
ally decided to establish military
control in that country. Upon leav-
ing India he was a member of the
guard in charge of a batch of
prisoners bound for Botany Bay,
and soon after arrival in New South
Wales purchased his discharge from
the Army, and entered upon farm-
ing pursuits at Wollongong. Sub-
sequently he disposed of his holding,
and with his family, most of whom
were born on the farm, came to
Moreton Bay in the year 1845. For
a time with his elder sons he was
employed in shepherding work on
the old "Dugandan” Station, but
renounced this occupation in favour
of police duties, joining the force, in
which he served with much credit in
the rough early days, when charac-
ters of all kinds had to be dealt
with, frequently at the officer’s own
discretion. Eventually the late Mr.
Conroy went into retirement at
Ipswich, where he resided until his
death at the advanced age of 78.
He left behind him a revered mem-
ory and an honoured name, which
has been carried on worthily by
those who owe to him their earliest
existence, and like him have made
their mark in the history of settle-
ment in Queensland. Mr. Hugh
Conroy, who enjoys the distinction
of being one of the oldest Justices
of the Peace in the State, received
what education the limited facilities
of the period at a small school held
in a minute "humpy” standing on
the site of the present Anglican
Cathedral in Brisbane. Leaving this
institution at 10 years of age, he
entered the employ of the late
George Leslie, one of the founders of
pastoral enterprise on the Darling
Downs, on his station "Canning
Downs,” where he performed such
duties as his tender age permitted,
looking after horses, and in other
ways making himself generally use-
ful. When the property changed
hands he left Mr. Leslie’s service,
and proceeding to Sydney again
found occupation connected with the
care and handling of horses, and
made such good use of his opportu-
nities that when he returned to
Brisbane some two years later he
quickly earned the reputation of
being a champion horseman, and for
some considerable time was engaged
in the breaking-in of horses and
other avocations incidental to bush
life, for the most part connected
with the equine friends for which he
always entertained a very warm
regard. Before emerging from his
teens he married, and his choice
having fallen on a worthy partner,
he reaped the benefit of what might
otherwise have been regarded as a
premature taking upon himself of
the responsibilities of manhood. Mr.
Conroy attributes much of his suc-
cess in life to the inspiration and
assistance of a good wife, who shared
with him in all fortitude the strain
and trials of pioneer life, deeming
no sacrifice too great to make on
behalf of those dear to her. After
his marriage, for 16 years he acted
as manager of "Taromeo” Station,
then the property of the late Mr.
Walter Scott, and upon relinquish-
ing this post took advantage of the
Free Selection Act to acquire a
property of his own, being among
the first free selectors in Queensland.
He worked very strenuously on this
selection, which, situated at South-
wood, now known as Bellevue, still
remains in his possession, and at the
close of several years had the satis-
faction of seeing it a well-developed
and productive property, leaving him
free to turn his attention to the
acquirement of further territory.
Accordingly he took up large areas
of land as opportunity occurred, of
which enterprise on his part his
family has since reaped the benefit,
much of the country then selected
by Mr. Conroy having passed into
the hands of one or other of his
children. He established "Castle-
holme,” his present property, as his
permanent home close on 40 years
ago, and at that period built the old
original cedar homestead, which now
forms part of the pleasant, comfort-
able, old-fashioned, rambling house
of 14 rooms, where wide verandahs
are surrounded by clinging and
creeping vines, shading an interior
fitted with up-to-date appointments
and all modern conveniences, and
possessing the "cool spot” so indis-
pensable in a Queensland abode. The
grounds are beautified with flower-
beds, shrubs, and shade trees, and
in convenient proximity stand the
substantial outhouses. The surround-
ing country is undulating, and tim-
bered principally with ironbark and
blue gum, while the wide pastures
indicate the nature of the industry
being carried on, “Castleholme”
being entirely devoted to grazing.

which Mr. Conroy has settled his
sons, all of whom owe to

native of Ayrshire, Scotland, and
came by the sailing vessel “Marco
Polo” to Australia in the year
1856. He resided for a
time in Melbourne, but
having followed mining pur-
suits in the Old Country,
he was induced to visit
the coalfields at Newcastle,
New South Wales, where
he resumed his former
occupation, and continued
therein for several years.
Whilst engaged in this
locality he turned an at-

the Moreton Bay country,
and in 1858, the year
before separation took
place, found his way north-
wards to try his fortune
at the then infant settle-

the Brisbane River. Some
years later, when the
sensational finds of gold
in the Maryborough dis-

attention, James Brown at
once proceeded to the scene of
activity, and remained on the

time. Failing to win the smile of

For this purpose, in -the

the Mount Brisbane dis-

approving eye on a fur-
ther 120 acres, which when
a favourable opportunity
occurred he secured, thus
bringing his holding up to
440 acres. Her© he found

Stanley River district, which he
stocked with cattle of the Hereford
type, keeping it exclusively for
grazing purposes, and making a
sound success of this branch of his
enterprise. The Deep Creek pro-
perty has a frontage of about half a
mile to the Brisbane River, and the
original homestead was erected by
Mr. Brown on a spot close to the
river bank. In the heavy floods of
1890, however, the water rose to
such a height that the dwelling was
practically covered, and an immedi-
ate removal was made to the site on
which the "Brownsvale” abode now
stands. It is snugly situated, the
locality and soil being favourable to
the cultivation of a wealth of shrubs
and shade trees, which enclose the
house on every side, giving welcome
protection from both sun and storm.
The timber on the Deep Creek pro-
perty consists mainly of the broad-
leafed ironbark tree, while on the
sister-holding at Stanley River pine

paddocks are splendidly adapted to

movements having for their object
the advancement of the district, and
was one of the prime movers for the
establishment of a public school,
which at that period was known as
the Mount Brisbane school, but is
now conducted under the style of the
Deep Creek school. At the incep-
tion of this institution he was elected
to the position of secretary, a post
he held with credit for about 30
years. He was interested in the
religious life of the district, and was
a prominent member of the Presby-
terian communion, filling office as
elder in the local church at Esk, in
which building a reproduction of his
portrait may be seen, together with
that of Mr. David McConnel, and
other deceased elders of the same
organization. In 1862 Mr. Brown
was married in Ipswich to Margaret,
daughter of the late John Anderson,

of Dundee, Scotland, by which union
there is a family of 13 children—lo
daughters and 3 sons—all of whom
have attained their majority, and are
settled in the district surrounding
their paternal home. The late Mr.
Brown was highly respected through-
out the whole district, and made
many friends, his decease, which
occurred on August 14, 1908, in his
seventy-fifth year, causing general
regret. The estate is now man-
aged by his widow, in conjunction
with her second son, Mr. Malcolm
Brown.
"NORTHBROOK” Estate, the
property of Messrs. W. E. Hine and
F. W. Hine. This well-known and
valuable property consists of some
3,000 to 4,000 acres, and is situated
about midway between Esk and
Fernvale, on the old Mount Bris-
bane road. It has a frontage of five
miles to the Brisbane River, and is
well watered by various creeks which
flow through the estate. Ironbark,
appletree, and blue gum timber is
plentiful, and afford good shelter for
the cattle, the estate being devoted
exclusively to grazing purposes. The
present owners inherited the pro-
perty from their father, the late
Edward Hine, who was born in Eng-
land, and came to Australia with his
parents while still quite a child.
Upon landing at Moreton Bay in
the early forties, like many another
pioneer, he found very little choice
of work awaiting him, shepherding
being practically the only occupation
offering for which he felt he was
suited. He followed this calling for
some considerable time, during which
he exercised strict economy and
gathered together sufficient capital
to enable him to join a mate—one
Bob Keys—in the carrying of food-
stuffs, chiefly to the far-back settlers
on the Dawson River, who had con-
siderable difficulty m supplying
themselves with the necessities, to
say nothing of the luxuries, of life.
His advent to the Dawson district
occurred only two days after the
massacre of the Fraser family at
‘Hornet Bank,” but undeterred by
the knowledge of the risk he ran
from the blacks he threw himself
with courage and energy into the
work at hand, and eventually re-
turned unscathed to the Northbrook
district, where, in the early days of
shepherding under the late William
North he had already selected a


homestead block, this being a part
of the original “Northbrook” estate.
Settling down on his holding, to
which he gave the name of “Dun-

days in Queensland blessed the virtue
of generous humanity by which the
late Mrs. Hine, following the custom
of her ancestry, was widely known,
the kindly act having a big signi-
ficance in those rough times. The
grazing operations with which Mr.
Hine initiated his enterprise were
subsequently augmented by other
departments of industry, among
which the timber trade occupied a
considerable place, and in connection
with this Mr. Hine owned the pioneer
sawmill of the district, known as the
“Dundas” mill. When the North
family decided to cut up their pro-
perty into blocks for smaller settlers
he enlarged his boundaries by the
purchase of the original homestead
portion of the “Northbrook” Estate,
and at the time of his death was the
proprietor of considerably over
10,000 acres, which, after the de-
mise of his widow in 1914, were
divided betwen the various members
of his family, Messrs. W. E. Hine
and F. W. Hine taking over in part-
nership the “Northbrook” home-
stead site with its surrounding acres
as their patrimony. William Edwin
Hine is the eldest of six sons and
five daughters, and was born at

“Northbrook” in the year 1864,
while his brother, Francis William
Hine, who is four years younger,
claims Fernvale for his birthplace.
Both brothers were educated at the
latter place, and since their child-
hood have continued to reside on the
home estate, taking their share of
responsibility in its working* and
showing themselves well adapted to
the different departments of work.
Mr. F. W. Hine married, in 1908,
Elspit, daughter of Mr. G. H. Hay,
a pioneer veteran, who hailed origin-
ally from Scotland and is well
known to a large circle of settlers in
the Fernvale district, where he now
lives in retirement. There are two
daughters by this union.

Emerald Isle, which in the days of
his youth was robbing the country of
the pride of the race, John Lough -
ran soon after reaching man’s estate
decided to test his fortune in distant
eee2
lands, and in the first instance chose
America as the land offering the
greatest opportunity to one of his
ambition and desires, doubtless
being swayed in his choice by the
fact that many of his kith and kin
had already crossed the Atlantic
and were doing well in the United
States. Fate, however, decreed
otherwise, and when in 1863 the
young emigrant took passage by the
ship “Wansfell,“ the first emigrant
vessel to touch Port Darwin, then
the most northerly port of Queens-
land, which she had visited on her
first trip in the previous year, it was
with Moreton Bay as his destination.
Accompanied by the young wife who
had agreed to share with him the
vicissitudes of life in a new country
beyond the seas, he arrived at his
journey’s end towards the close of
the year. Faced with the problem of
how best to command success in his
strange surroundings, he engaged
with the late Major North, founder
of the pastoral industry on the upper
reaches of the Brisbane River, in the
capacity of general storekeeper and
stockman on “Bellevue” Station, and
with the aid of his faithful and
thrifty wife, during the seven ensu-
ing years he was able steadily to
accumulate the wherewithal to
establish himself in an independent
proposition. In this aim he was
nobly assisted by the open-hearted
generosity of his employer, who
allowed him the privilege of running
all the stock which he was able to
purchase on the “Bellevue” pas-
tures ; and whilst still filling this
position he embraced the opportu-
nity of selecting under the conditions
of the time a block of 300 acres on
the southern side of the Brisbane
River. The selection was situated at
Moombra, some seven miles from the
locality now covered by the town-
ship of Esk, which has sprung up
during the past few years, and hav-
ing been able to secure a further 80
acres adjacent to his block, he re-
signed from Major North’s service
on the sale of “Bellevue,” and
embarked on the industry of cotton-
growing on his own holding. This he
only continued, however, for about
a couple of years, as the Government
of the day about this time withdrew
the bonus which for a considerable
period had been granted to pro-
ducers of cotton in Queensland. In
the meantime he had not been idle,
and the flourishing appearance of
smiling acres and general prosper-
ity which to-day characterizes the
“Mount View” Estate is due
mainly to the enterprise and indus-
try displayed by the late gentleman
in the early building-up of the
venture. As occasion arose he

River for nearly three miles, which

stress has proved most advantageous,
MR. JOHN LOUGHRAN, JUN.
and it may here be fitly mentioned
that during the drought of 1915-6
not a single hoof was lost
upon this property. Upon tak-
ing up his residence on the newer


block, and completing the prelimin-
ary development work, Mr. Lough-
ran became engaged in the dairying
industry, then an uphill fight, and
like most other pioneer selectors, had
much to contend with in making his
way. There were no roads in the
district, and it was a thing impos-
sible to procure assistance, even had
not the available capital been all too
small to meet the many requirements
of the farm. But in spite of the
multitudinous discouragements met
with in the early days of their venture
by the worthy pioneer and his wife
—worthy mate of a worthy pioneer
•—a determination to win through
caused them to persist in
their undertaking with a
courage equal to the heavy
demand made upon it, and
at length the period ar-
rived when they began to
put their troubles behind
them, having succeeded in
laying the foundation of the
large and prosperous es-
tate now in possession of
their sons. In 1884 Mr.
Loughran took up a block
of land at Emu Creek ; and
at the time of his death,
in 1895, the total extent
of his property was com-
puted at between 2,000
and 3,000 acres of fine
freehold grazing country.
This has since been added
to by his sons, who have
continued their father’s
policy of enlargement with
fideity to the ideal which
he set before him at the
beginning of his enterprise,
until at the present time
(1916) the estate comprises
considerably over 10,000
acres of freehold and lease-
hold country, the whole
of which is used for
pasturing the big mobs of stock
which find their way into the richly-
provided paddocks. All portions of
the holdings have the advantage of
an adequate water supply derived
from natural sources, the river sup-
ply being augmented by plenteous
contribution from running creeks and
surface waterholes, in those parts of
the estate not provided with a river
frontage. Indigenous grasses grow
luxuriantly everywhere, and on the
river flats especially is found in
abundance the couch grass so popular
with the stock. Full of interest is a
visit to the homestead, which, first
erected on low-lying country over 40
there being but few outhouses in
connection with the homestead, very
little shed accommodation being
necessary on a sufficiently-timbered
grazing run in Queensland. After
the decease of the late Mr. Lough-
ran, the widowed wife and mother
lived on at the old home for 21 years
before she was called to join her
husband and give an account of her
stewardship; and it is only fitting to
render such tribute to her memory
in these pages as her good and useful
life deserved. Her charitable dis-
position found its own scope in the

account of the kind actions which
she placed to her credit, but because
there she was well known and loved
by her kinsfolk and friends. The
management of affairs devolved upon
her for some time subsequent to her
husband’s death, but with the
assistance of her three sons, who
grew up to manhood on the estate,
and were thoroughly familiar with
all its operations, she was well able
to sustain her responsibilities, which
in time were shouldered entirely by
the sons, who have been the props
of her old age. The family left by
the late Mr. and Mrs. Loughran was

Toogoolawah.
Toogoolawah is a thriving township on the Brsbane
River Valley Railway line, 79 miles from Brisbane,
with a population of about 600, and subsists principally
on the timber, dairying, and agricultural industries.
The township is rather smaller than Esk, which lies
12 miles closer to the metropolis, but the former is
well supplied with banks, schools, hotels, and business
places generally. The biggest single enterprise of the
district is the Nestles’ and Anglo-Swiss Condensed Milk
Factory, which is said to be the largest establishment of
its kind in the Commonwealth. This venture contains
something of an object lesson in ujj-to-date dairy opera-
tions of a kind which are not plentiful in Australia. The
firm owns and works some six model farms of its own,
from which it obtains portion of its supplies of the raw
product. These are worked on the most modern of
scientific methods, and their influence has become
apparent throughout the whole neighbourhood, as they
have formed a pattern of successful management which
the farmers of the district have not been slow to copy
and to benefit by. Nestles’ farms are well provided
with silos and other means for storing fodder for use
during seasons when the natural growth of pastures
and crops is least prolific, and the land is closely sub-
divided into cultivation and grazing paddocks. High-
class Holstein, Jersey, and rfiilking-shorthorn cattle
are bred, and the diffusion of this blood through the
neighbouring herds has exercised an improving effect
in raising the milk and butter yields of the local cattle.
The Holsteins are used for securing large quantities of
milk and the Jerseys for procuring a high percentage
of butter fat. The firm acquired its property from Mr.
J. H. McConnell, who conducted the undertaking as
the Cressbrook Condensed Milk Factory, much of the
country surrounding Toogoolawah consisting of the
original "Cressbrook” Station, of which Colinton,
where there now is another condensed milk factory,
formed an out-station 17 miles from the site of the
future town of Toogoolawah. In the days when pastoral
enterprise held undisputed sway in the Brisbane River
Valley Cressbrook was devoted entirely to cattle-raising,
but to-day the same country is a veritable beehive of
agricultural activity.
The district surrounding Toogoolawah is excellently
suited to lucerne growing, the soil being of high fer-
tility, whilst a number of creeks which empty into the
Brisbane River render easy facilities for irrigating by
lifting the water with oil engines and windmills. Irriga-
tion is carried out mostly by means of force pumps and
the spray system, under which the cultivation fields are
intersected by networks of pipes, on which are fitted
numerous sprays, each of the latter covering an area
of ground some 20 feet in diameter. The cost of this
spray-irrigating has been found to work out at from
2s. 6d. to ss. per acre per week during the period when
substantial artificial watering is rendered necessary by
a deficiency of rainfall.
Several smaller townships lie in the Toogoolawah
district along the railway to Yarraman Creek. Among
these is Yimbun, for many years known as Kannangur,
a growing village subsisting chiefly from timber, dairy-
ing, and mixed farming. Harlin, Moore (formerly
known as Colinton), and Linville are thriving agricul-
tural districts, the productivity of which is made
abundantly apparent by the prolific growth in the
lucerne fields and the paddocks in which maize has been
planted. At Benarkin timber-getting is combined with
agriculture, whilst at Blackbutt, 3 miles further along
the railway, the forests are still more valuable. The
whole of the 43 miles of railway from Yimbun to Yar-
raman Creek (the terminus) the line passes through
extensive timber resources, and the latter place lies
in the heart of huge supplies. The potentialities of this
sort surrounding the railway head induced a recent
Government, when granting certain timber rights to a
private company, to stipulate that a sum of £5,000
should be spent on an experiment in papermaking with
the heads of trees, the trunks and other larger portions
of which had been used for other purposes. The results,
however, were not considered as yielding conclusive evi-
dence on one or the other side of the question of the
practicability of this form of enterprise. Agriculture
and dairying are also successfully carried on in the
same neighbourhood.
The further development of this and adjacent
territory will be strongly stimulated by the construction
of a railway from Yarraman Creek to Nanango, the
latter place being the terminus of a line running
in a south-westerly direction from Theebine, 22
njiles north of Gympie. This will give a direct
route from Brisbane via Yarraman Creek to Nan-
ango, and from the latter place, via Theebine,
back to the metropolis. The construction of the
line has been approved by the Public Works Standing
Committee, and its completion will open up a quantity
of fine dairying and agricultural country, the district
through which the proposed route passes now contains
a number of prosperous cattle stations.

MR. JOHN ADAM SEIB.
Adam Seib, a native of Hesse, Ger-
many, who left the land of his
fathers for Australia in the year
1854, arriving at Moreton Bay some
five years before separation from
New South Wales was accomplished.
The late Mr. Seib came out under
engagement as carpenter to the
father of the late Colonel the Hon.
J. F. G. Foxton, C.M.G., V.D.,
and did his part in the early de-
velopment work of the infant colony,
being one of the first to engage in

than a small village. With him
John Adam Seib brought his wife
and baby daughter (who died at sea
during the voyage), and the couple
resided in Brisbane for two years,
at the end of which time his en-
gagement with Mr. Foxton termin-
ated . By the exercise of the strictest
economy he saved sufficient capital
to enable him to take small building
contracts on his own account, and
subsequently he served in the capa-
city of foreman to several large con-
tractors, being connected with the
erection of some most important

structures in the early history of
the colony. He has also been
numbered among the pioneers of
farming in Quensland, having been
the first settler in the Lowood dis-
trict, where, after relinquishing
building pursuits, he carried on
cotton growing and mixed farming
for some considerable time. Later
he became a landowner in the Esk
district, and in the autumn of his
days lived for some time in retire-
ment in Ipswich until the time of
his death. The late Mr. Seib may
be characterized as an ideal pioneer,
by his honest, industrious habits
having set an example to those with
whom he came into contact during
his time of residence in the young
colony, and earned the respect and
esteem of the community of which
he formed a unit. He left a family
of five sons and two daughters, all
of whom are now settled on the land
in Queensland. Of these, the eldest
son, Mr. Frederick Seib, was born
at Brisbane in 1855, the year fol-
lowing his parents’ arrival in this
State. He received his education at
Ipswich, but was obliged to leave
school at an early age in order to

assist his father on the selection at
Lowood, where he continued until
20 years of age. He then took up
a block of land in the same neigh-
bourhood, and occupied himself with
its development for about five years,
when he disposed of the holding and
acquired a larger selection at Biarra,
some six miles distant from Toogoo-
lawah. Here he has continued ever
since, establishing himself as a suc-
cessful farmer and aiding in the
upbuilding of the district which, at
the time of his advent, was prac-
tically untouched by the settler. It
was a far cry to his next-door neigh-
bour’s, but by degrees surrounding
blocks of land were taken up, and
cultivated patches showed on the
clearing until at length the
semblance of a town made its in-
ception and the place began to take
upon itself the responsibilities of a


settlement. Mr. Seib’s position as
the pioneer settler was cordially re-
cognized when it became necessary
for the ratepayers to elect from their
midst a member to represent them
in the Esk Shire Council, and for
18 of the 36 years that he has lived
in the district he has occupied a
seat at the council table, at times
filling the honorary post of chair-
man. He is an active member of
the Esk-Toogoolawah Agricultural
Society, and as chairman of the pub-
lic school committee at Biarra has
used his influence to gain improved
educational facilities to the advan-
tage of the youth of the community.
Mr. Seib was gazetted to the Com-
mission of the Peace by the Kidston
Government, and on occasion acts as
licensing justice for the district of
Esk. He married Bertha, daughter
of the late Carl Sheifelbein, also
a pioneer of Lowood, who died in
1913, leaving a family of seven sons
and four daughters. His eldest son,
Mr. J. F. Seib, J.P., selected coun-
try on Cooyar Creek several years
ago, and was the founder of Yarra-
man, where he still holds landed
interests.

MR. JOHN ALFRED HAWKINS.
Hawkins, of the Logan district, who
came to Queensland from Holcombe,
Devonshire, England, by the sailing
vessel “Venelia” in 1865. The
subject of this memoir was born in
Devonshire on July 25, 1863, and
was between two and three years of
age upon his arrival with his parents
in Queensland. He was brought up
in the Logan district, attending with
his brothers the Stockleigh public
school, where he received the ele-
mentary education provided by the
Government authorities for the
children of settlers who, in many
cases, had to be content with this
equipment when starting out in a
world where their practical services
were in demand from the moment
that they could be entrusted with
the performance of any of the tasks
of the farmyard or the field. The
Hawkins brothers were no exception
to this rule, and spent long hours on
their father’s cotton plantation or
in work incidental to the dairying
enterprise by means of which he was
making a maintenance for his large
family. Both school and play had
to give way to the demands of the
busier seasons, and indeed for the
latter no margin was allowed. Be-
fore he was 14 years of age the
stripling had perforce to take upon
himself the duties of a man, and to
play his part in the development of
the several little properties which
his father had secured as occasion
arose, with a view to the settlement
of his sons as they came to man-
hood’s estate, and it is interesting
to note that, in various parts of the

without pleasurable pride does Mr.
Hawkins look back to this formative


period of his career, when a sound
foundation was laid by which his
subsequent success in life was assured
by reason of the mastery gained in
matters of habit and will. For the
first 26 years of his life he remained
under the paternal rooftree, profit-
ing by the mature experience of his
father and accepting the advice and
guidance which was there to be had
for the asking. At length, in the
latter eighties, he decided that the
time had arrived to make a begin-
ning on his own account, and having
anticipated this day by the selection
of a 500-acre block of land in the
Logan district a few years earlier, he
settled down to the development of
this holding. Upon his marriage in
1893 he disposed of his original hold-
ing and took over “Highland” Park,

father from the old “Colinton”
Estate when the latter station was
cut up for closer settlement. Upon
this block of land he built a home-
stead, and for the first 10 years trod
the usual uphill path of the settler,
making his way and establishing
himself in a sure position—strug-
gling, failing, retrieving his foot-
hold, until by the end of the period

of uncertainty had been safely

circumstances as to allow of a con-

acres of freehold property at

Hawkins, and subsequently a further
area of the “Colinton” Estate. To
these in 1913 he added the broad
acres surrounding his present home,
“Devon Hills,” bringing his free-
hold possession to within the
vicinity of 14,000 acres. Practically
the whole of this large area is de-
voted to grazing purposes, farming
being carried on only on a small
scale at the “Devon Hills” property
for home requirements; the last-
named estate, situated as it is be-
tween “Louisavale,” which lies
nearer the head of the Brisbane
River, and “Highland” Park on the
other side, being most convenient to
the management of all the proper-
ties. In addition, Mr. Hawkins

for the carrying capacity of his own
run, despite the excellent grazing
quality of all these lands. The
country as a whole is undulating,
with several very rich flats and por-
tions which incline to be hilly. Tim-
ber is found in abundance, and all
portions of the estates are well-
watered, the Brisbane River flowing
through the home paddocks, while
creeks and other surface waters are
present in sufficient abundance to
remove any necessity for recourse to
artificial means of securing the requi-
site supply on any one of the estates.
Mr. Hawkins removed his place of
residence to “Devon Hills’’ upon
taking up that property in 1913, and
a word must be given to the home-
stead, which is situated on the crest
of one of the hills which occur at
frequent intervals in this locality.
The house itself is up-to-date in de-
sign, and a garden of shrubs, orna-
mental trees, and flower-beds, which
have been laid out with considerable
taste, gives promise of providing at
no very distant date that floral set-
ting without which no home, how-
ever ornate, may be called complete.
But one of the chief attractions of
the spot is the beautiful and pic-
turesque outlook over a foreground
of verdant to a vista of
wide-stretching terraces formed by
the nearer hills, the emerald chang-
ing to violet as the landscape becomes
gently obscured in the heights and
depths of the distant ranges of
mountains. The rising ground on
the estate is graciously clothed with
a plenitude of foliage of varying
hues, under the shelter of which the
herds may be discerned browsing on
the sweet grasses or enjoying their
noonday rest. The working out of
his own important proposition has
absorbed the - major share of Mr.
Hawkins’ time and energies, but
about a decade since he was induced
to accept the responsibilities of a
Commission of the Peace, and takes
his turn in administrating justice
from the Bench at Esk. Mr. Haw-

one of the oldest residents of the
Logan district. Mr. Kingston was
born at Cople, Bedfordshire, Eng-
land, and was married to Miss Har-
riet Lowth in the year 1854. Three
years later he left his native land for
Australia by the ship “Hastings,”
the voyage extending over 93 days.
In August, 1862, he came to the
Logan district, where he made his
home and continued to reside there
continuously for upwards of 40
years, with the exception of a few
months, when, accompanied by his
wife, he revisited the home of his
youthful days. On February 26,
1904, the worthy couple celebrated
their golden wedding, on which occa-
sion eight out of their nine children
were present, and a beautifully-
framed address and purse of sove-
reigns, the united offering of the
family, were presented after the
usual toasts and congratulations.

land, and for some time devoted his
attention to agricultural occupations.
He soon perceived, however, that the
possibilities of advancement were
cramped in the old homeland, and
lent a willing ear to tales of romance
and adventure in the far-off country
of Australia, where the royal road
to fortune, so ardently desired by
most, appeared to be trodden by not
a few of the enterprising settlers who
emigrated from Great Britain. De-
ciding to make the big venture, he
took passage for himself and his wife
in the early thirties of the nineteenth
century, the party including their
firstborn child, then an infant in
arms. Arriving at the port of desti-
nation at a period when the new
colony of Victoria was itself in its
infancy, the late Mr. Harding first
settled at Geelong, where he pro-
ceeded to establish himself in pas-
toral enterprise on fairly liberal
lines. Being the possessor of a cer-
tain amount of capital, in accord-
ance with the conditions of the day,
MR. CHARLES HENRY HARDING.
upon arrival he received a grant of
1,000 acres of land from the Govern-
ment, the concession being an acre
of land for every pound sterling or
pound’s worth of property brought
into the country by a new settler,
by which means a stimulus was given
to colonization. Mr. Harding became
the pioneer settler at Bream Creek,
near Geelong, and in course of time
he took up several thousand acres of
leasehold country in the vicinity of
his freehold, a portion of the land
formerly held by him now forming
the site of the present Geelong race-
course. Upon this area he engaged
in sheep-farming for upwards of 30
years, and as an additional avenue
of enterprise, together with a few
other far-seeing settlers, shared in
the honour of pioneering the wheat
industry of Victoria. As far back
as the year 1862, at which date
Queensland had been for three years
a self-governing colony, and was

which centre they purchased 3,000
sheep and set off for the Darling
Downs, making arrangements to
meet the remainder of the travellers
at Toowoomba at such time as they
should be able to effect a junction.
These plans did not culminate until

nearly a year later, and in the mean-
time Mrs. Harding and some of the
children had reached Brisbane and
sailed up the river to Ipswich in a
small steamer, from which town, at
the appointed time, she set out with
another team to meet her husband,
according to the plan agreed upon.
After a short delay following the
reunion, the whole family, with the
two teams and the stock, which had
been increased by purchases at
“Jimbour” Station, set their faces
westwards to seek a suitable spot for
a home, with pasturage for the

sheep. The late John McDonald,
father of Messrs. McDonald Bros.,
of Charlotte Plains, was a partner in
this venture, and formed one of the
travelling party, which passed on
from one place where water was to
be found to another, the plentiful
grass of that season fortunately re-
moving all anxiety as to the well-
being of the stock. Following a
dray-track until they reached a
locality where the wheel marks
ceased, in the remote region where
this occurred they founded “Wild
Horse Plains” Station, on Mungal-
lala Creek, adjoining “Bindelbango”
Station. Finding the country satis-
factory and the grass and water
good, they continued there for some
little time, and during his sojourn
in this district Mr. Harding took up
“Grassmere” on his own account,
and later on the partnership with
MR. FRANK L. HARDING.
Mr. McDonald was dissolved by
mutual consent, when the Harding
family decided to take advantage of
the Land Act of 1868 and to ac-
quire land in the more settled dis-
tricts, where the conveniences of
civilization were more easily obtain-
able. It was in 1872 that the father
of the present owner of “Glen Hard-
ing,” with some of his family, came
to the Brisbane Valley and settled
on about 5,000 acres of land, and by
dint of good management and strict
economy found themselves able
successfully to demonstrate the pos-
sibility of making their way on
means which would have been con-
sidered by most people altogether in-
sufficient for such a large household.
The original holding selected by
the late Mr. Harding was a part of
the old “Colinton” Station, and as
time went on this was augmented by
selections from the adjoining “Cress-
brook.” To-day the estate which,
at the death of Mr. Harding, sen.,
was purchased by his son, Silas,


extends over 5,000 acres, and forms a
splendid fattening property, to which
it is chiefly devoted, although some
bi’eeding is also carried on. When
Mr. Elias Harding left his western
station he brought with him a
flock of sheep to “Glen Harding,”
but upon discovering that the coun-
try was not well-suited to this class
of stock he gradually disposed of
them and replaced them with cattle,
to which the estate is now almost
entirely devoted. In common with
other pioneers of the period, the
family endured its full share of pri-
vations and hardships, and was
came to understand that spearing or
killing the stock or any attempt upon
human life meant prompt punish-
ment for the offender by means of
the white man’s deadly bullet.
Though thus protecting themselves
from danger from the blacks, how-
ever, the Hardings suffered dire
straits through the great floods in the
south-western districts during the
sixties, when the price of flour rose
to £lOO a ton at St. George, and
even had they been able to raise the
wherewithal to pay the high figure
demanded, they were placed beyond
the possibility of procuring this
nourishment provided by the flesli
of the half-starved animals, and
upon yams and pigweed. Even with
this inadequate fare, they were
reduced to half-measure for some
considerable time before the flooded
country and creeks became passable.
Then followed dry seasons and
drought, when even the famous
Bollon Waterhole (now Bollon town-
ship) contained only a little dirty
water. All these trying experi-
ences, however, were only tempor-
ary, and from 1872 to 1895 the late
Elias Harding continued to work
and occupy the property where his

called upon to make every sacrifice
for the benefit of future generations
which fell to the lot of the brave
“nation-builders” of earlier days,
and which few could escape. The
aboriginal population was fairly
numerous in the neighbourhood of
“Wild Horse Plains,” and it
was deemed best by the family
to adopt a of caution in
their dealings with a type of
humanity which had often proved
treacherous and hostile. They

teams nor pack-horses could be used
until the flooded Maranoa River
subsided, and the boggy country
became dry enough to be crossed by
beasts of * burden, and thus they
were utterly shut off from the
settlements where provisions were
procurable. The whole of that large
area of level country, westward
from the Maranoa River, was in a
flooded condition, and the stock was
starving on the sand ridges, which
were the only dry spots, and as
a result the Harding family was
reduced to subsistence on the poor
son now resides, in the latter year
retiring to Ipswich, where he lived
with another son until his death in
1904. Mr. Harding was notable as
a man who practised the Christian
religion with fidelity, and whose re-
putation as an honest, just, and
honourable citizen stood high; and
if in the opinion of some he erred
on the side of strictness and severity
in the observance of his principles,
there were none who denied either to
himself or his good wife the respect
and esteem which their blameless
lives so well deserved. Mr. Silas
Harding, the subject of this memoir,


was born in Victoria on March 19,
1851, and is the seventh son of the
late Elias Harding. He received his
education at the Ipswich Grammar
School, being 11 years of age when
he came with his parents to Queens-
land; and upon the completion of
his studies some seven years later he
became indentured to Mr. D. S.
Thistlewayte, railway engineer and
licensed surveyor, now living
in retirement at Brisbane. Twelve
months later he passed an examina-
tion which entitled him to effect
surveys for the Government of
Queensland, and for about three

Towers, Ravenswood, Gympie, and
many other of the northern and cen-
tral goldfields. After the death of
his father he purchased “Glen Hard-
ing” on his own account, and thence-
forward for a time pushed his way
warily along, stocking his paddocks
one by one, and remaining in the
Government service until he felt
himself to be fairly “out of the
wood” of any possible embarrass-
ment of a financial nature, the in-
creasing returns from the property
proving that all anxiety with regard
to the venture might be put on one
He also served for over a decade, in
pre-Federal days, in the 2nd Wide

rank of honorary captain and quar-

of the late William Hiller, a Han-
overian who, half a century ago,
settled on the Darling Downs, where

pursuits, and subsequently was well

many years, being a prominent

in private practice in the employ of

made a success in this direction, he
was approached by the officers of the
Mines Department with the sugges-
tion that he should apply for the
position, then vacant, of Government
mining surveyor on the Northern
Goldfields, to which he was duly ap-
pointed. For over a quarter of a

The subject of this notice received
his education at the public schools of
Drayton and Woodview, and upon
the attainment of his 16th year pro-

Queensland, where he spent three
years in gaining an insight into the
pastoral industry and enlarging his
knowledge of the country in which
he was born, together with the
acquirement of that experience of
life so useful at the outset of a
young man’s career. At the close of
his teens, however, he abandoned the
freer life of the bush to join the
State Education Department, and
removed to Kilcoy, where he was
appointed to take charge of the local
public school. Mr. Bishop followed
this profession for about four years,

tion of lucerne, maize, and other
crops, while, as already indicated,
“Riverlea” is worked as a grazing

distinguished for the lively interest

displaying considerable concern for
the well-being of the community of
which he formed a unit. Since his
early twenties he has taken his place

down, successfully working his pro-
perty, which he devoted to cotton-
growing and other purposes. For
close on half a century the late Mr.
Brown continued to reside in the old
homestead which he built upon this
holding, and here his demise
occurred in his seventy-fifth year,
his widow and family of four sons
and two daughters surviving him.
Well-loved by his neighbours, the
late settler played a worthy part in
the country of his adoption, and he
is still remembered with affection
and respect by those among whom
his lot was cast for so lengthy a
period. The gentleman under re-
view, Mr. George Brown, received
his education at the public school
at Glamorgan Vale, and completing
his studies at the age of 14 gave his
attention to general duties on the
paternal property. Upon reaching
his eighteenth year he was placed in
charge of one of the bullock teams
owned by his father, which were
used for the hauling of pine logs
from England Creek to Pernvale,
shortly after the construction of
the Brisbane Valley Railway Line.
Upon attaining man’s estate he en-
tered into partnership with his
father, who had selected a large
block of land at Avoca Creek, which
had formed a portion of “Colinton”
Station, resumed for closer settle-
ment by the Government of the day,
and, disposing of the teams, he and
his brothers threw themselves into
the work of making a success of this
venture, which took the form of a
grazing proposition. Their efforts
prospering, subsequently (in 1898)
the partnership extended operations
to include the block of land upon
which Mr. Brown’s homestead now
stands, and continued to work
as a firm until 1911, when by
mutual consent the connection was
dissolved. After a general settlement
of affairs had been effected, Mr.
George Brown found himself in pos-
session of the “Homemeade” pro-
perty, comprising 1,400 acres, which

he has since devoted to stock-raising
purposes. In 1912 he turned his
attention to the timber industry,
and this branch of his operations
has proved very lucrative. Mr.
Brown interests himself in the pub-
lic welfare of the district, being
president of the local branch of the
Farmers’ Union and of the Progress
Association and a member of the
local school committee, besides which
he extends his support to all move-
ments having as their object the
advancement of the community in
which he resides. He is a Justice of
the Peace, having been gazetted to
that office by the Philp Administra-
tion in 1909. In 1900 he married
Jane, daughter of Mr. Thomas
Gregor, of Moombra, one of the old
pioneers of the Esk district, whose
personality has become one of the
familiar landmarks of the commun-
ity during half a century of resi-
dence in that neighbourhood. Mr.
Gregor has proved himself a public-
spirited citizen, associating himself
in a whole-hearted manner with the
various organizations of the district
in which he has made his home, and
in consequence enjoys the friendship
and respect of a wide circle. Mr.
and Mrs. Brown have a family of
two sons.


Caboolture to Kilcoy.
CABOOLTURE.
Caboolture is the first township of considerable size
met with on the northern railway leading to Rockhamp-
ton and beyond. The surrounding district is devoted
to mixed farming, dairying, cattle-raising, and timber-
getting, whilst the ridges which run through the
environing country are used for the cultivation of pine-
apples and bananas. Several sawmills are situated
within the town, and are kept busy mostly in dealing
with hardwoods, whilst some hoop pine is also treated.
The butter factory is one of the largest and most
important in the State, supplies of cream being sent to
it from within a lengthy radius of land eminently suited
to the industry which it represents. Like most of the
successful Australian enterprises of the same kind, the
factory is owned and worked on the co-operative method,
so that the whole of the profits of manufacture, as well
as of production, find their way into the farmers’
pockets, and are consequently used for the further
development and improvement of the holdings.
Originally Caboolture was regarded as a highly
suitable place for sugar-growing, and a mill was estab-
lished there while the industry was yet in its early
stages, and the relics of the quarters of the Kanakas,
who in those times were employed in the sugar fields,
still form one of the interesting sights of the locality.
However, with the spread of settlement to the north,
more prolific sugar farms were opened up, and the rush
for the latter was stimulated by the neglect of the
pioneer growers to fertilize their land, so that the first
of the holdings devoted to the industry were returning
diminishing yields. The success of the business had been
established by experiences gained at Ormiston, near
Cleveland, in the sixties. This had led to the extension
to Caboolture, and subsequently northwards from there.
Caboolture was a very early settlement, being situated
on one of the first stock routes leading to Brisbane.
The country surrounding the town is largely
covered with open timber and nourishing pastures. The
CHARLES EDWARD WISE,
orchardist, “The Springs,” Wood-
ford, is a son of the late George
Wise, member of a family who for
generations followed farming occu-
pations on a property known as
“Pile Farm,” near Portsmouth, in
the County of Hampshire, England.
“Pile Farm” was especially noted
for the breeding of a fine class of
racehorses, which won distinction on
the English turf from time to time.
The late Mr. Wise’s father, however,
fff2
did not follow the tradition of his
forebears in the matter of a calling
in life, but turned his attention to
the brewing of English ale, in
■which industry he was well known
in the old town of Portsmouth.
George Wise left home at an early
age, and served his apprenticeship
as carpenter and joiner. He gradu-
ally worked upwards, until he
obtained a position as clerk of works
in the London County Council. In
course of time he married, and
town has its site on the Caboolture River, a broad and
permanent stretch of water, densely fringed on both
banks with big eucalyptus trees and thick undergrowth.
The stream empties into the Strathpine River, and the
latter reaches the sea in Moreton Bay, between Red-
cliffe and Bribie Island. The Caboolture Shire has an
area of 486 square miles and an estimated population
of 2,780 persons. There are four subdivisions, each
being represented in the local governing body by three
councillors. Though the country was originally mostly
held in the form of large cattle stations, the holdings
now are moderately small. The rapid progress which
dairying and other industrial developments have
made of late years is manifested by the prosperous
appearance of the town, and the local residents are
confident of much bigger things being assured for
the not distant future.
The thriving townships of Woodford and Kilcoy
are both connected with Caboolture by rail. These are
noted for the timber turned out from the respective
districts, whilst dairying and fruitgrowing also have
attracted a deal of successful enterprise. Woodford has
its own butter factory, but the cream from Kilcoy is
sent by railway either to Woodford or to Caboolture.
Kilcoy, which lies in the heavily-timbered D’Aguilar
Range, is the terminus of a branch line, 32 miles in
length, which leaves the main northern line at Cabool-
ture, whilst Woodford is on the same railway, but
14 miles nearer to the metropolis. The Kilcoy Shire
has an area of 255 square miles, and an estimated popu-
lation of 3,700 people. The local authority was pro-
claimed on February 22, 1912. The railway from
Caboolture to Woodford was opened on December 6,
1909, and the continuation from the latter place to
Kilcoy was completed and the first train run on the
track on February 22, 1913. Kilcoy lies 80 miles from
Brisbane by rail, whilst the distance separating
Caboolture from the metropolis is 31 miles.
became the father of a large family
of nine children. Hie death
occurred very suddenly in 1911, as
he was sitting in his chair at the
office. The subject of this notice,
Mr. Charles Edward Wise, was born
at London in 1864, and received his
education at the London national
echools and Homerton College, the
latter being under the jurisdiction
of the London School Board. He left
the latter institution at 14 years
of age, and began to study civil


engineering in his father’s office,
subsequently relinquishing this con-
nection to serve his apprenticeship to
the building trade, in all departments
of which he became thoroughly well
versed before leaving the world’s
metropolis in 1888. In that year he
took passage by the “Chybassa” for
Queensland, and having been landed
by the vessel at the new wharf,
applied himself to getting a grip of
the conditions prevailing in the
young country under the Southern
Cross. Finding that a period of
depression had occurred in the build-
ing trade, he seized an oppor-
tunity which presented itself to learn
bootmaking in its various branches
at Toowoomba, whithei’ he had
turned his steps soon after his
arrival in Queensland. He became
associated in the boot trade with
Mr. Peter Field, of Toowoomba,
and continued steadily to work his
way up, until eventually he occupied
the position of director in the firm
where he had started at the bottom
rung of the ladder, which was
formed into a co-operative company
some years after his entry into the
business. He remained at Too-
woomba until 1893, when he pur-
chased a boot store at Roma, which
he carried on for three years, at the
close of this period proceeding to
Ipswich, whence at a later date he
returned to Brisbane and joined
Messrs. McMurtrie, boot merchants,
of that city. He continued in charge
of the warehouse of this firm for
about 10 years, but was at length
compelled by ill-health to retire.
Being ordered by his medical adviser
to live as far as possible out of doors,
he obtained employment as a
traveller on behalf of the firm of
Messrs. Astill & Freeman, of Bris-
bane, and spent about five years on
the roads, during which he gained
considerable acquaintance with dif-
ferent districts of the State. Being
desirous of beginning life on the
land, he paid a visit to the “Durun-
dur” Estate, which had been
resumed by the Government and
cut up for closer settlement. He
selected 750 acres of forest land, and
with a view to inaugurating dairy-
ing operations, he purchased a large
herd of milch cattle, which he pas-
tured on a neighbouring run whilst
preparing his own holding for its
occupation. After clearing a por-
tion of the ground and giving the
herd a trial, Mr. Wise decided to
give up dairying, and directed his
energies to the fruit industry,
preparing a couple of acres, which he
planted with pineapples. Finding
that these did well, he extended the
area under culture by degrees, until
at the present time he has seven

grow pineapples commercially on the
western slopes of the D’Aguilar
Range, a distinction which has been
recognized by the Government, who
sent a special photographer (Mr.
Sanderson) to take views of his
orchard, which subsequently were
used in the annual report of the
Agricultural Department. When
Mr. Sanderson visited the district in
company with his colleague, Mr.
Ross, the Government Fruit Expert,
both gentlemen were treated with
much courtesy by Mr. Wise, who
drove them to the various orchards
which they were desirous of inspect-
ing. It is interesting to note that
the Government authorities state
that Mr. Wise has achieved two
records in pineapple culture in
Queensland by taking 718 cases of
rough-leaved pines from two acres
(summer crop), which had been
planted for three years; and 225
cases of the smooth-leaved variety
from one acre, planted 18 months.
Mr. Wise takes a keen interest in
the progress of the Woodford dis-
trict, and is throwing all his influ-
ence into the scale in favour of the
Mary Valley Railway Line, holding
that this will give a strong impetus
to settlement in this vicinity. He
holds the Commission of the Peace,
and is a prominent member of the
Rechabite Order. He married Emily,
daughter of Mr. Joseph Gordon, of
Toowoomba, and has two sons and
one daughter. One son assists His
father on the farm; while the other,
Frank, who was a student at Gatton
College, having won a bursary
entitling him to three years’ free
instruction at this institution, also
assists in the orchard at home.


The late JOHN CHARLES
ROBERTS, who owned the “Grove
•Farm,” Woodford, now under the
management of Mr. Harry Crow-
ther, was born at Chester, in the
English county of the same name,
in 1858, and attended a school in his
native place until 10 years of age.
His father died when he was little
more than an infant of three
years, and subsequently, his mother
marrying again, the family, consist-
ing of the stepfather, mother, three
daughters, and two sons, set sail for
Australia in 1868. During the
voyage Mrs. Roberts was unfortu-
nate enough to lose her second
husband, whose death occurred just
before the boat arrived at her desti-
nation, and the widow, with her
young family, after landing at
Brisbane, settled at Sandgate, where
she opened a boarding establishment
for the accommodation of visitors to
this favourite seaside resort. The
gentleman under review began active
life as an assistant to Mr. Simpson,
on a dairy farm belonging to the
latter, at Redhall, Caboolture,
which position he continued to fill
later on in the intervals of learning
the carpentering trade, when he
divided his time between Redhall
and Brisbane. After his marriage
he decided to purchase his present
estate, “Grove” Farm, near Wood-
ford, a nice little property compris-
ing 284 acres, and here in 1888 he
started dairying after the prepara-
tory work had been completed. Mrs.
Roberts retains vivid memories of

those early days on their block of
virgin land, which was formerly a
portion of the “Parkhead” Estate,
and consisted principally of standing
scrub, with about 50 acres of forest
country. Their first act was to clear
and burn the scrub, after putting
up a bark “humpy” as a temporary
shelter, and following after came

until the pastures were ready to
receive the small dairy herd with
which operations were begun. In
addition to the milking cows, Mr.
Roberts purchased two teams of
bullocks, with the aid of which he
was able to make a profitable propo-
sition of the prolific growth of
timber on the other portion of the
holding, cutting down the trees and
carting them to Caboolture, the
nearest railway station, whence they
were conveyed to Brisbane timber
yards. The plucky young couple
had their share of privation and
hardship, at the beginning having
to go as far as Warraba to obtain
provisions at the nearest store,
familiarly known as “Jobell’s,”
which there and back meant a jour-
ney of 30 miles, and occupied the
whole of a day. Close to their
selection a camp was formed by the
blacks, who, however, finding them-
selves kindly treated by their white
neighbours, showed a peaceable
spirit on the whole, and did not
prove very objectionable, although
their near vicinity was not always
desirable. By dint of steady con-
tinued effort at length the whole of
the property was cleared and
improved, a nice little dairy farm
rewarding the enterprise of the
settlers, who forthwith turned their
attention to the enlargement of
their holding. The “Durundur”
Estate, which had been repurchased
by the Government for closer settle-
ment purposes, was now on the
market, and Mr. Roberts secured
454 acres of unimproved land, where
the programme of clearing, scrub-
bing, fencing, stocking, etc., had
again to be gone through, and was
grappled with with the same energy
and perseverance that had marked
the progress of the former venture.
A larger and more comfortable
house was erected, and about this
time Mr. Roberts disposed of his
bullock teams, and gave his atten-
tion exclusively to dairying, breed-
ing his own cattle, and conducting
operations on a fairly extensive scale.
The cream from his dairy was sent
to the Stanley Co-operative Butter
Factory, in the establishment of
which Mr. Roberts, as practically
the pioneer of the district, took a
keen interest. He was well known
in religious and social circles in
Woodford, being a member of the
local Church of England, and an
active worker in the Woodford
Masonic Lodge, which recognized
him as one of its most sincere and
hearty adherents. A familiar iden-
tity in the streets of the township
and on the roads linking the farms
and orchards, he was popular
wheresoe’er he went, and his death
about four years ago, after a severe
illness of a month’s duration, was
sincerely regretted. His widow,
Sophia, daughter of the late Wil-
liam Charles Brooks, formerly of
Oxfordshire, who settled at Been-
leigh, after his advent to Queens-
land, still resides on the estate, the
practical management of which she
has placed in the hands of a nephew,
Mr. Harry Crowther, who continues
dairying operations in conjunction
with the cultivation of sweet corn,
maize, and root crops, etc.


CHARLES JOHN FERRIS,
of “Lyndhurst,” Poynton Packet,
Woodford, was born at Ravenswood,
Victoria, in the year 1867, his
father, Charles Ferris, being a
MR. CHARLES FERRIS.
farmer of the district. When he
was three years of age his parents
removed to Sutton Grange, near
Castlemaine, and having arrived at
an age fit to receive instruction,
young Ferris was sent to a local
school, where he mastered the rudi-
ments of education. While still a
lad he accompanied his parents to
a new home at Fernihurst, on the
border of the mallee country of Vic-
toria, where wheatgrowing and
sheep-farming chiefly engaged the
attention of the settlers. After com-
pleting his studies he turned his
attention to the work of his father’s
farm, and proved himself very
useful in various capacities. In
1883 the family removed to Queens-
land, where Mr. Charles Ferris had
taken up a selection of 3,000 acres
at Surat, on the Balonne River, with
the intention of embarking on sheep-
breeding pursuits on a more exten-
sive scale; and for two years the
gentleman under review was content
to assist in the working up of this
new proposition in association with
his father. At 18 he struck out for
himself, easily obtaining employment
on the large cattle stations in the
remoter portions of the State, and
in this way he gained much valuable
experience, which has proved very
useful to him in his subsequent
career. In especial, he spent a con-
siderable time on “Noorindoo”
Station, then the property of Messrs.
Dangar and Bell, and became
familiar with all the ordinary
departments of station life, to the
management of which he readily
adapted himself. Eventually he
decided to relinquish pastoral work
for a time, and broke his three-
years’ connection with “Noorindoo”
to come with his parents to Wood-
ford, where, after purchasing a
team of bullocks, he found profitable
occupation in the timber-getting
industry for about three years.
Returning to the station, he once
more took up his old routine, which
he continued for half a decade, and
next directed his energies to the
cartage of wool from the different
pastoral properties with his own
team of horses. About 1902 Mr.
Ferris came to the Glass House
Mountains, where he again started
in the timber industry with a bul-
lock team, and three years later he
selected 425 acres of land near
Woodford, the development of which
he embarked upon conjointly with
the continuance of his timber-get-
ting operations. After clearing and
fencing this area he purchased a
dairy herd, which he pastured upon
this property, where paddocks with
a good growth of artificial grasses by
degrees replaced the virgin scrub
with which it was covered when first
taken up by Mr. Ferris. Continuing
actively to enlarge the scope of his
enterprise, he embraced the oppor-
tunity later on to make further
purchases of land, including 116
acres of the “Mason” Estate, and
another 280 acres near Woodford,

the immediate improvement of which
is included m his prospective scheme.
Being_ a thorough believer in the
lucrakve nature of the dairying

basis, his intention is to build up

extensive scale, and in view of
this enlargement of operations has

to the property. He also intends
to place a considerable area under
cultivation of the various fodder
plants most approved of in the
dairying community, and confidently
anticipates excellent returns in
reward for his industry. Mr. Ferris
interests himself in the affairs of the
district, and is a member and secre-
tary of the school committee of
Commissioner Flat, near Woodford.
He married Kathleen, daughter of
the late Mr. John Duggan, of Roma,
one of the old pioneers of Bun-
ge wogerri, Queensland, and has two
eons and three daughters.


SAMSON BROWN, “Mountain
View,” Woodford, was born in
Cambridgeshire, England, and re-
ceived his education at West Wratt-
ing, in that county. Leaving school
at an early age, he started work
on farms, next securing a position
as pageboy to the squire of West
Wratting, which he left to begin
gardening work, and eventually got
employment as a ploughman. At 21
he left England by the ship “Callet,”
and landed at the old depot, Bris-
bane, on March 3, 1873, after a
voyage of 90 days, with only a £1
note in his pocket. After working
for a time in Brisbane he went to
Seedy Creek, and was employed on a
farm for 13 months, subsequent to
which he was engaged at Broadwater
splitting palings and shingles. Twelve
months later he purchased a horse
team, with which he carted timber to
Brisbane, about this time selecting
80 acres of land at Redland Bay,
then known as Priest Gully, for the
purpose of timber-getting, and, hav-
ing cleared this holding of trees,
disposed of it to a purchaser.
Hearing good accounts of the
Blackall Ranges, Mr. Brown decided
to inspect for himself the country of
which he afterwards became a
pioneer, and leaving the Eight-Mile
Plain in the morning arrived at
Mellum Creek (Landsborough) the
same day. Later was directed to a
timber-getter on the top of the range,
who assisted him in the matter of
taking up a selection. Returning to
Priest Gully, he brought his family
by coach to Mellum Creek, and

proceeded to Bald Knob, about three
miles further on, where he awaited
the arrival of his goods and chattels.
The difficulty encountered by Mr.
Brown in getting settled in his
future home may be imagined from
the statement that in the first
instance he had to tie his wife and
children on the horses and cut a

path before them through the stand-
ing scrub with his own hands. His
next act was to build a three-roomed
weatherboard house, 30 x 12, with
cherry wood taken from the selection,
after which he began to clear his
ground, soon afterwards joining
forces with a Mr. Percival in taking
contracts for cedar-cutting. Having
prepared a small area of soil, he
planted corn, but met with great
discouragement when marketing his
crop, for which he only obtained 9d.
per bushel. Nevertheless he perse-
vered until he had 30 acres under
the plough, and continued his uphill
task until the darkest days were left
far behind. Some mention of the
rough life only serves to indicate the
strong, virile nature of the man,
who struggled through successfully,
and among the many hindrances
which made great inroads on his
time was the procuring of supplies,
which meant a loss of three days at
a time, one being spent in getting
his horse from the only pasture in
the district, at Brougham Pocket, a
second in doing the trip to and from
Landsborough, and a third in
returning the horse to his feeding
ground. A feat accomplished by Mr.
Brown is still talked of in the dis-
trict. On one memorable occasion
he humped a 200-lb. bag of flour
the whole distance of seven miles
from the store at Bald Knob to his
selection, while his two children
carried 100 lbs. of corned beef slung
over a stick between them. He
planted sugarcane in expectation of
; a promised mill, which, however,
was never erected; started dairy-
farming, and produced excellent
cheese, which he conveyed under
difficulties to Landsborough, the
slush on the bad road often reaching
up to the horse’s middle; and also
had some success in pig-raising,
curing the bacon himself and
selling it locally at 6d. per lb.
For twenty-two years Mr. Brown
pursued the usual life of the early
settler in a district of which he
was strictly the pioneer, and
during this lengthy period he wit-
nessed the incoming of other sturdy
spirits, who like himself wrested
from the virgin bush the means of
livelihood under conditions of priva-
tion and hardship, and gradually
built up the settlement of Maleny.
In the course of time being offered
a fair price for his holding, he sold
out, and purchased his present
estate of 400 acres, which he has
since developed into a most pros-
perous farm. Mr. Brown was one of
the founders of the Woodford Butter
Factory, to which he sends cream
from his own large dairy, the
“Mountain View” farm numbering
200 head of shorthorns of his own
breeding. He takes a live interest
in the public affairs of the neigh-
bourhood, and is a prominent sup-
porter of the local Church of
England. Mr. Brown married as
his first wife Lydia, daughter of
Mr. James Potter, of West Wratt-
ing, England, by whom he had two
sons and five daughters; and after
her decease espoused Miss Fanny
Jane Goodman, the issue of this
union being one daughter and two
sons.


ARNOLD McKENZTE, manager
of the Stanley River Co-operative
Company’s Butter Factory, Wood-
ford, is a son of Mr. Alexander
McKenzie, a native of Scotland, who

in the year 1886 left the old country
for Australia, where he followed up
the building trade for a time,
having been apprenticed to a car-
penter in the land of his birth. In
the early nineties he took up 30 acres
of land at Apsley, near Brisbane,
where he spent 15 years in horticul-
tural pursuits; and subsequently
came to Kilcoy and selected 320
acres, which he cleared and fenced
for dairying purposes, starting a
Jersey herd, with which he has
attained very good results. Mr.
McKenzie, who still carries on
operations at the farm, married
Ann, daughter of Mr. Sheriff, of
Buchie, Scotland, and has three sons
and three daughters. Mr. Arnold
McKenzie was born at Wooloowin,
near Brisbane, in the year 1887,
this place then being known as
Thoroldtown. He attended Bowen
Bridge Public School until eight
years of age, concluding his studies
at Apsley School, where he remained
until his sixteenth year. Mr.
McKenzie began business life as a
clerk in a well-known stock and
sharebroking office in Brisbane, and
three years later accompanied his
father to Kilcoy for the purpose of
assisting in the building up of the
farming and dairying enterprise.
Being of an observant and studious
turn of mind, in his spare time he
gave careful attention to the best
methods of butter-making, and
obtaining up-to-date literature on
the subject, made himself familiar
with all departments of the industry.
Eventually he eecured a position in
the Stanley Co-operative Company’s
factory at Woodford, having gained
practical experience with Mr. W.
Garden, manager of the Kilcoy
Depot, who gave him an insight into
the testing and cream grading,
mostly in the evenings when the
testing took place. Under these
favourable conditions he continued
his studies both at the factory and
by reading, until at length, pro-
ceeding to Brisbane he passed his
first examination as a tester, subse-
quently securing all the certificates
necessary to qualify him for the
appointment of manager of a factory.
After being employed for two and a
half years at Woodford, he was
appointed foreman, and upon the
retirement of the late manager, IVIr.
Cranwell, assumed the general con-
trol of the business, combining the
secretarial duties with those of
manager. The Stanley Co-operative
Company turns out a first-class
butter, the cream being gathered
from the surrounding farms, which
are divided up into different districts
in a radius of 20 miles. After
being brought in by the wagons, the
cream is tested and graded by Mr.
McKenzie and his assistants, and is
then pumped over a cream cooler
into the vats, which are fitted with
attemperator coils for the purposes
of blending. From here it passes
into the modern Simplex combined
churn and worker, which has entirely
superseded the old concussion churn
in the factory, and when the butter
appears the buttermilk is taken off,
and the butter washed and salted,
the moisture being worked out by
the roller in the churn —only 13 per
cent, of moisture being allowed to
remain. When taken from the
churn it is packed into boxes, and
the bulk of it is exported to Eng-
land, satisfactory prices always
being secured. A proportion, how-
ever, is retained for local consump-
tion and for the Brisbane market,
the vhole yearly output of the
factory averaging some 150 tons.
The butter factory has been a great
boon to the district, and since its
establishment the dairying industry
has gone ahead by leaps and bounds,
the farmers now having a sure means
of disposal of their cream. The
average price paid to suppliers
during the half-year ended June 30,
1915, was Is. 3d. per lb., and
during the half-year 381,586 lbs. of
cream were received, from which

ests himself cordially in all local
affairs, and is a prominent member
of the local Church of England. He

WILLIAM HENRY PERKINS,
proprietor of Yatesville Hotel,
Woodford, is a son of the late Wil-
liam Perkins, who was born on the
Parramatta River, New South
Wales, and spent the whole of his
life in the Mother State. The late
Mr. Perkins was engaged in farming
pursuits on the Llunter River for a
number of years, and also found
lucrative occupation in the cedar
forests which provided a means of
livelihood for so many settlers in the
early days, when “timber-getting”
was carried on very extensively,
though under much more difficult
conditions than in recent years. He
married, and brought up a family of
four sons and five daughters, who
grew up in the northern districts of
New South Wales, chiefly on the
Hunter and Richmond Rivers; and
about the year 1898, while still
resident in this part of the country,
his death occurred. His widow is
still living, her home being at

subject of this notice, Mr. William
Henry Perkins, who was the eldest
son of his father, was born at a
place called Goorangullah, situated
on the Hunter River, New South
Wales. When he was ten years of
age his parents removed to a farm
on the Richmond River, and for
some time he attended a public
school at Bexhill, in the vicinity of
MR. WILLIAM HENRY PARKINS.
his home. At 14 he left school, and
received his initiation into agricul-
tural pursuits and stock management
under the guidance of his father,
but two years later relinquished life
on the land and became engaged in
commercial occupations as assistant
in a general store conducted by Mr.
Fraser, at Eltham, in the same dis-
trict. At this period of his life he
sought and obtained a variety of
experiences, whilst feeling his way
towards a congenial calling, and at
the outset of his career was entrusted
with the management of a storekeep-
ing business on behalf of Mr. John
Fitzpatrick Tintebar, which position
he retained for three and a half
years. Having reached the age of
27, he decided to strike further
afield, and coming to Queensland
joined the firm of John Gannon,
auctioneer, etc., of Woodford, pur-
chasing an interest in the business,
of which eventually he became sole
proprietor. After taking over Mr.
Gannon’s share in the concern, he
conducted operations in his own
name for a time, and proved very
successful as an auctioneer, holding
large cattle sales, and disposing of
many valuable properties under the
hammer. In course of time he
opened a branch business at Kilcoy,
and admitting Mr. A. J. Sinclair
into partnership, bought out the
established firm of Sherlock & Co.,
and has carried on a flourishing
auctioneering business with the
assistance of his partner. In August,
1915, Mr. Perkins purchased the
lease and goodwill of the Yates-
ville Hotel, and has since devoted
his energies chiefly to the manage-
ment of this popular hostelry,
though he still keeps closely in
touch with his other business con-
nection, and is well to the fore in
the fortnightly sales which are held
at Woodford. The hotel, which was
built and fitted up at a cost of about
£2,000, is a large and well-venti-
lated building, the spotless cleanli-
ness of which cannot fail to impress
alike the casual visitor and the
general habitue of the house. The
interior is replete with every con-
venience, and a feature of the place
in its provision for the needs of all
classes of clients, special coffee-rooms
being provided in addition to the
public dining-rooms, where an excel-
lent and varied menu attracts
numerous guests, who show their
appreciation of the good things pro-
vided and the superior arrangements
in the matter of service, etc., by
their consistent support. The house
enjoys the patronage of the Com-
mercial Travellers’ Association, and
many travellers and visitors make
the Yatesville Hotel their home
whilst at Woodford, the genial
manner of "mine host,” who makes
an ideal boniface, the civility of the
attendants, and the good manage-
ment of Mrs. Perkins, who has
proved her husband’s most able
coadjutor, all combining to secure
the popularity of the place. The
hotel buggy meets all trains, and
vehicles may be had on hire at
reasonable terms, while all man-
ner of information concerning tha


district is at the disposal of the guests
upon application to the proprietor,
who is possessed of a perfect fund
of knowledge, with which he is
always ready to assist anyone in
need of such. Mr. Perkins is a great
believer in the future of Woodford
and the surrounding district, and
takes considerable pride and plea-
sure in furthering its interests in
every possible way. Being an
advocate of all healthy outdoor
sport, he encourages every move-
ment in this direction, and is
equally generous and keen in charit-
able and social affairs. He takes a
lively interest in the projected
railway line from Woodford to
Keefton, via Mary Valley, and in
all other schemes set afoot for the
advancement of the neighbourhood.
He has been twice married. His
first wife was Selina Maud Agnes,
daughter of Mr. Thomas Staunton,
of Cabango, New South Wales, who
died in 1908, leaving one child.
Subsequently Mr. Perkins espoused
Marcella, daughter of Mr. John
Gannon, of Verona, on the south
coast of New South Wales, the issue
being a daughter.

MR. JOHN BYERLEY LWORERY.
During his childhood his parents
removed to Cocken White House,
five miles from the-city of Durham.
For centuries part of the Lowrey
family had been engaged in farming
in the North of England. Mr.
Lowrey’s grandfather and father
leased holdings from the Earls of
Durham, being among the oldest
tenants of this aristocratic family.
The gentleman under review

took up duties on his father’s farm,
where he worked for a number of
years. At 24 he took passage for
Australia by "The Scottish Hero,”
and after landing in Brisbane joined
a Mr. Macdonald on a selection
owned by the latter on Mount Kee.
Afterwards he purchased a bullock
team, and whilst giving his primary
attention to dairying pursuits also
engaged in the timber-getting indus-
try. He experienced the usual trials
and drawbacks of the early settler,
but surmounted all difficulties, and
at the present time owns a holding
comprising 580 acres of freehold
land, which he uses chiefly for
dairying and horse-breeding pur-
poses. Mr. Lowrey married a
daughter of Mr. J. Robinson, of
Zillmere, her parents being emi-
grants on Dr. Lang’s chartered
vessel, "The Fortitude,” which
arrived in Queensland in the middle
fifties of the last century. Of the
union there is a family of two sons
and two daughters, one son being a
member of the Commonwealth
Defence Forces; while the other still
(1915) resides under the parental
roof-tree.
ROBERT BLACK, who owns the
grazing property known as "Tbe
Retreat,” Neurum, is a son of the
late William Black, a dairy farmer,
of Newton, County Antrim, in the
North of Ireland, who came to
Australia by the ship "Chatsworth”
in 1862, accompanied by his wife
and nine children, Mr. Robert Black
being then nine years of age.
William Black started business on a
modest scale in Brisbane, as a
supplier of builders’ materials,
building up his enterprise until it
was one of the finest businesses in
Queensland. He also engaged as a
carrying contractor in conjunction
with his sons, who continued to
assist him in the various depart-
ments of his business until his death,
about 1885. Mr. Robert Black was
born at Newton, County Antrim, in
the year 1853, and attended a
private school in the Old Country,
continuing his education after his
arrival at Brisbane at the old
Valley National School. Leaving
school at 16 against the wish of
his father, lie ran away from
home in company with a certain
Thomas Morgan, and tramping the
country, arrived at Caboolture,
where he obtained work from Mr.
Murray, Brisbane.
MR. ROBERT BLACK.
Simpson, a butcher, with whom he
remained for 12 months. Whilst
here he witnessed a tribal fight
among the blacks, who were numer-
ous, and had some reputation as
cannibals. Returning home, he
obtained a situation with Mr. (after-
wards Sir) Samuel Griffiths, but
subsequently entered into partner-
ship with a Mr. Tutty, the firm
purchasing a plant of boats and
cutters for rafting timber. The logs
were first carted to the river banks,
where they were chained together
into rafts, sometimes a quarter of a
mile long, and towed to the Brisbane
River, whence they were conveyed by
steamer to the wharves, the old
“Fardenarajah” being used by
Mr. Black for this purpose. He
employed three hands to assist him
in this work, which he continued
successfully for 18 months, and then
sold out. He next started as a con-
tractor for the supply of building
materials, with depots at South Bris-
bane and at Petrie Bight, employ-
ing horses, carts, and barges for
bringing the sand, gravel, metal,
etc., and working up a very big
connection, the firms of Petrie and
Son and Dart & Morrey being
included among his employers, while
Phippard & Co., and Pierce, of
Melbourne, also gave him large
orders. During the 22 years that
Mr. Black carried on in this line
he had practically the run of the


building trade, the materials for
most of the principal buildings in
Brisbane being supplied by him,
while he also secured the contracts
in connection with a portion of the
Valley railway tunnel. In 1878 he
purchased a portion of the resumed
“Durundur” Estate, and selling his
business, removed to the selection
with his family of one son and
three daughters. A slab “humpy”
at first provided sufficient accommo-
dation for the party, but after the
family had increased to nine child-
ren, Mr. Black erected the present
homestead, a modern residence with
up -to - date appointments. The
estate consisted of 640 acres of
timber country, upon which he com-
menced operations with his cus-
tomary vigour and enterprise.
Clearing a portion and dividing it
into paddocks, he purchased a dairy
herd, and supplied the creamery
known as Wade’s until the output
of milk was sufficiently large to
enable him to engage in cheese-
making. Adopting the “Champion”
brand, he competed in the open
markets, and was successful in
obtaining the highest prices for his
product, until the establishment of
the Woodford Co-operative Factory,
of which he was one of the founders
and directors, diverted this channel
of his activities. His dairy herd at
the present time numbers over 100
head, besides which he runs some
100 beef cattle on the property, and
is also a breeder of pigs on a fairly
large scale, his fine Berkshire boar
having been purchased from Mr.
Warburtou, of Nundah. The poul-
try section is also a profitable branch
of his industry, though this is

comfort for all the living creatures
under his care, and in the proper
housing of valuable machinery and
implements, of which there is a
great variey. Mr. Black has experi-
enced his share of throwbacks in
common with other settlers, and in
one season alone, owing to the
breaking out of a serious malady in
the herd, lost over 80 head of cattle.
With characteristic pluck and
energy, however, he set to work to
build up a new herd, and success-
fully accomplished this within the
shortest possible space of time.
About two years ago he practically
handed over the administration of

his wife and family of six children,

immediately after arrival the late
gentleman, who became one of those
worthy pioneers whose names will re-

younger generation, entered the

Grandchester was in course of

terized by the genial kindness of
heart and charitable acts which had
distinguished him in his more active
life. Upon reaching the allotted
span of three-score years and ten,

pose of seeing once again the home

his studies and took up work on
a property owned by his father
on the Bremmer River, some 18
miles from Ipswich, the nearest
earned by the early settlers, who
worked their primitive holdings on
whatever lines they found to be
most profitable and with the outlay


of as little capital—which was a
scarce commodity—as possible. In
1875 Mr. King selected at Neurum
a homestead block of 640 acres,
situated in a locality which he
considered a favourable one for a

premier place. Dairying and tillage

of various crops absorbing a large
share of attention, and proving
a profitable expenditure of labour.

in all movements set afoot for the
advancement of the district has
truly indicated him as the possessor
of a public-spiritedness which has
sought vent in these and other
permanent home, and commenced
the improvement of the land on his
own account. On this property, to
which he gave the name of “Stanley
View” Farm, he resided until 1905,
when he removed to “Cedar Vale,”
his present home, retaining, how-
ever, the earlier holding, which is
still in his possession. “Cedar Yale”
was first taken up as a pioneer
settler’s block by the late Enoch
Horne, Mr. King’s father-in-law, at
about the same period that the latter
gentleman selected “Stanley View,’’
and a considerable amount of de-
velopment work had been accom-
plished on the property when, after
Mr. Horne’s decease, the estate was
CATTLE AND SHEPP AT PASTURE.
Cattle-raising for dairying pur-
poses has also afforded scope
for the exercise of an experienced
knowledge of the best classes of stock
on the part of Mr. King, who per-
sonally controls the work of all de-
partments, his efforts specially being
directed to the making of such pro-
vision for his children that they may
be enabled to start life under more
favourable conditions than he him-
self enjoyed at the outset of his
career. It is highly satisfactory to
place on record that these endeav-
ours have met with the excellent
results his industry so well merited,
and that he has been able honour-
ably to uphold the good name of the
praiseworthy channels, for the acti-
vities to which he feels himself
prompted when time and oppor-
tunity permit. He is a consistent
supporter of every worthy charitable
cause, and holds deep religious con-
victions, making it his constant aim,
both by example and precept, to
commend to others those ideals by
which he endeavours to keep “in
touch with the Infinite ” in all the
varying circumstances of life. Rea-

Mr. King has succeeded not alone in
his private proposition, but as a
resident of the neighbourhood of
Neurum, and as a citizen of Queens-
land, his example has proved of
and daughters an equally admirable
tradition for their guidance, and in
this aim he enjoys the full sympathy
of his good wife, who deserves full
meed of credit for the unselfish and
whole-hearted assistance she has


rendered to her husband throughout
the many years of their happy mar-
ried life. This lady, to whom Mr.
King was united in 1888, was, as
previously intimated, a daughter of
the late Enoch Horne, who first came
to Queensland at a date prior to the
arrival of the King family, and was
one of the earliest to take up work
on the Redbank coal mines in this
State. Subsequently he entered upon
farming pursuits at Moggill, on the
banks of the Brisbane River, where
he continued for many years, and
finally formed his permanent home
at “Cedar Vale,” the present home
of his daughter, Mrs. King. There
is a family of three sons and seven
daughters.
PATRICK JOSEPH Mc-
CAULEY, “Neurum” Park, Neu-
rum, was born at “Eric Grove,”
Candelo, New South Wales, on
April 7, 1877, and is a son of the
late Terence McCauley, a member
of one of the most ancient families
of Ireland, the nomenclature in its
different branches having come down
through the ages from the dawn of
Christianity, when St. Patrick first
set his foot in old Hibernia. While
yet in his teens, the late Mr.
McCauley felt rising within him the
spirit of enterprise and adventure
which prompted so much of the tide
of emigration which flowed forth
from the British Isles during the
nineteenth century, and with a de-
termination to make the most of his
life he took passage for Australia,
whither so many of his countrymen
were hieing. Landing in Sydney
with less than a shilling in his
pocket, but with a stout, young
heart and plenty of confidence in
himself and his power to win
through, he first accepted employ-
ment at a wage of 10s. a week,
which gave him his opportunity of
proving the stuff of which he was
made. Later he became engaged in
various kinds of work incidental to
bush life, which enabled him to
gather together the necessary capital
to start for himself on the land.
This McCauley did in a modest way
at Candelo, in the Bega district of
the Mother State, where ultimately
he became known for many years as
a successful grazier, with which he
also combined ordinary farming
operations, his herds of dairy stock
being held up as the model for
aspiring dairyfarmers in that part
of the country. Tie married in
1875 Ann, eldest daughter of Mr.
Thomas Fitzpatrick, a Tipperary
man, who during the seventies con-
structed for the New South Wales
Government the telegraph line from
Twofold Bay to Gabo Island, sub-
sequent to which he went to Fiji,
and was there killed by natives in
the early seventies. Mr. McCauley
was only 40 years of age at the time
of his death, and left a widow and
family of two sons and two daugh-
ters, all of whom are now settled in
Queensland. Of the daughters, the
elder is married to Mr. Denis
Twohey, of Childers, and the
younger to Mr. Thomas Isaac, of

trict; while Mr. John Thomas
McCauley is engaged in farming
pursuits at “Drefiield,” Kilcoy.
The subject of this memoir,
Mr. Patrick Joseph McCauley,
who was the eldest of the family,
received his early education at
the Yurramie State School, New
South Wales, completing his scholas-
tic course as a student of Queen’s
College, Bega, under the head-
mastership of Mr. William Duff, a
well-known educationalist from Bel-
fast, Ireland. Upon the termina-
tion of his studies, at about 16 years
of age, Mr. P. J. McCauley, being
the eldest son, had to take upon
himself the responsibilities of head
of the family, his father’s decease
occurring about that time. He
accordingly continued the adminis-
tration of the home estate until
about 1899, when the property was
put into the market, and all the
members of the family, including the
widowed mother, came to Queens-
land. Here Mr. McCauley pur-
chased his present holding from the
late Joseph Wilkinson, a worthy
pioneer who had missed the smile of
Fortune, and was compelled to part
with the acres upon which he had
fondly hoped to spend the autumn of
his day. “Neurum” is the aboriginal
name for the creek which flows
through the property, and the whole
of the surrounding locality was
known as the Neurum country, which
in the early days formed part of
“Durundur” Station. “Neurum”
Park is situated at the foot of
Mount Archer, originally called
Neurum Mountain, but in com-
memoration of the Archer Brothers,
who were the first owners of “Dur-
undur,” the mount received its pre-
sent appellation. Upon winding up
the affairs of his father’s estate in
New South Wales, Mr. McCauley
displayed his good judgment by
making a selection from the finely-
bred herd of 20 young female cattle
and bringing these to the northern
State. He mated them with two
choice, purebred Jersey bulls from
“Kameruka” Estate, the property
of Sir R. L. Tooth—a herd most
favourably known all over the Com-
monwealth. Having started opera-
tions with this excellent stock in
1900 on his new holding at Neurum,
his success as a breeder and dairy-
farmer was almost a foregone con-
clusion; and until 1912 he continued
on the lines then inaugurated,
making dairying the principal
feature of his enterprise. Since that
date, however, he has altered his
line of procedure, and has disposed
of nearly the whole of his fine herd,
the occasion of the sale being made
memorable by the prices secured by
the stock, which were higher than
had ever been known at a sale of
any dairy herd in the district.
Since that time Mr. McCauley has
directed his energies chiefly to graz-
ing, which he carries on successfully,
personally supervising the affairs
connected with his pastoral interests,
which provide him with sufficient
occupation to fill up his working


hours. In his leisure, however, he
applies his mind to those matters
which concern the community as a
whole, and here, as in the older
settlement of which he
formed a part in New South
Wales, he has always been
distinguished for his public
spirit. When Kilcoy attained
to the dignity of self-gov-
ernment as an independent
shire, Mr. McCauley allowed
himself to be nominated as
a member of the first coun-
cil, and occupied the seat
for three years, during the
last of which he was elected
chairman, filling this office
for the usual term. In the
election for the second coun-
cil he again contested the
councillorship with success,
but subsequently, owing to
pressure of his private
business, was reluctantly
compelled to send in his
resignation, which was ac-
cepted with regret by his
fellow-councillors. He served
for a considerable time as
director of the Stanley River Co-
operative Butter Company, of which
he was one of the founders; and in
various other ways had made his

JAMES GREEN grazier, timber
merchant, and sawmiller, “River-
view,” Villeneuve, was born at
Maidstone, Kent, England, on Feb-
ruary 8, 1861, and is a son of the
late James Green, who came origin-
ally from Wiltshire, where his
family had been settled for genera-
tions, to Kent, of which County
Mr. Green’s mother was a native.
1 hough at one time engaged in
agricultural pursuits, the late James
Green subsequently turned his atten-
tion to the cement industry at
Maidstone, and here the gentleman
under review received an elementary
education at the national school. In
his eleventh year he became con-
nected as a junior with the carpen-
try trade at Burham, and after two
years, during which he obtained
a knowledge of the elementary
branches of the industry, he spent
a similar period at the sawyer’s
bench, becoming fairly expert in
this and other departments. As he
approached his middle teens, new
machinery for dealing with wood
came into use, and Mr. Green trans-
ferred his attention to caskmaking
on the up-to-date methods intro-
duced by modern inventive genius,
and remained working at these
machines until his twentieth year.
Owing to circumstances which
brought about the cutting down of
prices for such labour, he proceeded
to the County of Essex, where, in
the vicinity of the famous Tilbury
Docks, he became a sub-contractor
in the machinery department of the
cask-manufacturing industry, and
both here and at Gillingham, in
Kent, whither he extended his
operations, he followed that indus-
try until he reached 25 years of age.
The prospects of attaining to any
marked eminence of success in
overcrowded England, however,
appeared to him somewhat remote,
and about this time he began to
consider the possibilities offered to
young and vigorous men by the
British dominions on the southern
side of the equator. He listened to
the stories related by his fellow-
workmen of successful emigration to
Australia, and having convinced
himself of the truth of much that
he was told, eventually he made the
decision to put his fate to the test,
and to follow the example of those
others whose pluck and enterprise
had first commanded his admiration,
and which finally incited him to
imitate their venture. Taking pas-
sage by the emigrant ship “New
Guinea,” he arrived at Brisbane on
March 1, 1886, and being faced

MR. JAMES GREEN.
with the problem of how best to
make good in a new country, natur-
ally he first sought to turn his
expert knowledge, already acquired
in the land of his birth, to account,
and soon found scope for his energies
in the erection of dwellings in the
metropolitan area. Twelve months
later found him an employe at a
sawmill in the vicinity of Brisbane,
and here he continued until his
approaching marriage became the
occasion by which his thoughts and
ambitions began to take a wider
range. In the year 1891 he cast the
die which separated him at once from
the crowd of mere wage-earners,
taking over on his own account a
small sawmill situated about four
miles from Goodna, which he en-
deavoured to work for a while on a
payable basis; but being without
proprietary experience, and minus
the necessary capital to tide him
over the earlier stages of the enter-
prise, it was hardly surprising that
at no very extended period he was
forced to relinquish operations in
this quarter. Undeterred by failure,
Mr. Green subsequently entered
upon a partnership in a business of
the same nature in Brisbane, but
here again the Fates were not pro-
pitious, and the work came to a
standstill, and had to be abandoned.
Yet once more, with the backing-up
of capital, he made a third venture,
renting, in partnership with Mr.
W. G. Leeney, a small, four-horse-
power mill at the figure of 4s. a
week. A year later Mr. Leeney
retired from the business, and the
remaining partner continued the
working of the mill practically

that time he has never looked back,
the success which he has commanded

as a lesult of the amazing industry
and dogged perseverance which has
characterized his conduct of the

enterprise. As his connection grew,
and “grist flowed into the mill” in
a double sense, Mr. Green saw his
way to the erection of larger pre-
mises and plant, a departure which
speedily justified the judgment
which dictated the extension, mak-
ing possible the welcome discovery
that the bare living, which was all
that the smaller mill afforded, was
augmented to a considerable degree
by the expansion of business brought
about by the enlarged operations of
the newer one. Gradually prosperity
crowned his efforts, and as the
earlier venture became established
on sound lines, he branched out in
various directions, being of a dis-
position to launch forth without fear
when he had first safely provided
for the maintenance of his family.
Among the channels for investment
offering themselves, land selection
appealed to him most strongly, and
eventually he took up a holding
near Byron, in the Villeneuve dis-
trict, which, being well covered with
good commercial timber, promised
to be doubly profitable to the far-
sighted investor who staked his sur-
plus capital in its acres. This initial
selection was followed by the pur-
chase and selection of adjoining
blocks of land, until Mr. Green’s
original 160 acres represented but a
very small portion of an estate, the
acreage of which ran into four
figures. As the years rolled on, and
the milling industry prospered,
further blocks of well-timbered
country were acquired by Mr.
Green, which served to feed the saw-
mill, and as gradually the clearing
was effected were converted into
GGG
profitable grazing propositions, the
land being stocked with cattle.
To-day the two industries play an
important part in the general pro-
gress of the district, and Mr. Green
has the satisfaction of knowing that
the ladder by which he has climbed
to the prosperous position he now
occupies has also served to provide
foothold for numerous other indus-
trious and worthy settlers, all of
whom are doing their bit in inci-
dentally furthering the wellbeing
of their country whilst building up
their own private enterprise. In
1888 Mr. Green founded his prin-
cipal mill at Villeneuve, which has
continued to work as a live concern
up to the present time; and he also
owned the Kilcoy sawmill for about
a decade. In 1906 he opened busi-
ness in Brisbane, a packing-case

factory at Rosalie being his first
metropolitan venture; but finding
this site not suited to his extensive
operations, subsequently he removed
closer to the heart of the city, pur-
chasing a site in Wickham Street,
Fortitude Valley, where he erected
a factory and timber yards, and
carried on business until 1916, when
he disposed of his interests in this
locality. In 1911 Mr. Green made
an extended trip to the Old World
and America, visiting the home of
his ancestors, and travelling on the
Continent, with much pleasure and
profit. In America he saw the world-
famous centres of the timber indus-
try, and added considerably to his
knowledge by a first-hand acquaint-
ance with the forests of Oregon and
Washington. In order to be in
closer touch with the centre of com-
merce, he removed to residence in
New Farm in 1908, and in 1914,
just prior to the outbreak of the
European War, he acquired a river-
side site for the erection of a wharf,
his intention being at the cessation
of hostilities to initiate the importa-
tion of timber on a large scale from
America. Whilst giving the chief
attention to his own affairs, Mr.
Green has found time to devote to
the advancement of the public weal,
and for some years served as coun-
cillor of the Caboolture Shire,
during which period he took a
prominent part in effecting the
division of Kilcoy and Landsborough
into separate shires, by means of
which the unwieldy shire of Cabool-
ture was split up into smaller areas,
which could be more efficiently con-
trolled from local centres. He mar-
ried in 1890 Caroline, daughter of
the late Owen Kelsey, one of the
early pioneers of Goodna district,
who hailed originally from Kent,
England, and of this union there
are two daughters and one son.

WILLIAM McLAUCHLAN,

near Ipswich, Queensland, on
November 16, 1878, being the
eldest son of Mr. Robert McLauch-
lan, now living in retirement at
“Bianda,” Woodend Road, Ipswich.
Whitehead, Ipswich.
MR. R. McLAUCHLAN.
The latter gentleman, who was one
of the pioneers of Villeneuve, is a
native of Perth, Scotland, and came
to Queensland with his parents in
August, 1854, when only an infant
of nine months old, the voyage being
made in the sailing ship “Anna.”
Upon arrival at what was then known
as the Moreton Bay district of New
South Wales, Robert McLauchlan’s
father, the late William McLauch-
lan, became engaged on the con-
struction of the first telegraph line
between this settlement and the
capital of the Mother State, and
later he was numbered among the
pioneers of the timber industry in
the Pine Mountain district, at a
time when it was the custom to raft
the logs down the river from that
locality to Brisbane as the easiest
means of transport. Subsequently
he was one of the first to engage in
cotton-growing in Queensland, dur-
ing the period when that form of
enterprise was given practical en-
couragement from the Government
of the day by the bestowal of a sub-
stantial bonus on each crop. The
late pioneer died in the Villeneuve
district in 1910 at 84 years of age.
Mr. Robert McLauchlan, his eldest
son, after receiving the elements of
education at a small school at Pine
Mountain, completed his studies at
Ipswich, and upon the termination
of his school course became asso-
ciated with his father in the avoca-
tions of the bush. At 14 he was
doing the work of an adult, manag-
ing a team of bullocks with confi-
dence and adroitness, and displayed
so much efficiency in whatever work
he took in hand that he was en-
trusted with full control of a cotton
plantation, owned by the late
Messrs. Tatham & Paul, at Noo-
goora, on the Brisbane River.
Although so young, his well-
balanced character and steady
habits caused him to be held in high
esteem by his employers, with whom
he remained for several years, and
at 17, as a result of his policy of
industry and thrift, he found that
he had saved enough to make a be-
ginning for himself on independent
lines. Purchasing some “green”
bullocks and the necessary plant, he
applied himself to the breaking-in
of his team, and before he had at-
tained his eighteenth year had suc-
ceeded in establishing a thriving
carrying busines, hauling logs for the
settlers and also doing some timber-
getting on his own account. In
these pursuits he continued until the
time of his retirement from active life,
becoming a prosperous and useful citi-
zen and setting an excellent example
of industry and rectitude to the
younger generation. Being of a
somewhat retiring disposition, Mr.

Robert McLauchlan has never taken
a prominent part in public life, hav-
ing been content to assist financially
and otherwise any movement for the
general welfare which appealed to
him as likely to attain that end. He
has been twice married, his first
wife, to whom he was united in
1877, being Margaret Cook, daugh-
ter of the late John Hunter, a
native of the Island of Bute, Scot-
land, and a pioneer of the Pine
Mathewson & Co., Brisbane.
MR. JOHN McLAUCHLAN.
Mountain district of Queensland.
This lady—by whom he had issue
two sons and three daughters—died
in 1912, and shortly afterwards Mr.
Robert McLauchlan sold out his in-
terests in Villeneuve, where he had
settled in the year 1888, and took
up his residence at Ipswich, subse-
quently espousing a younger sister
of his first wife, Mary, with whom
he is now enjoying, in the autumn
of his days, the peace and rest so
abundantly deserved by one who has
never failed to tread the path of
duty with undeviating feet. The
subject of this notice, Mr. William
McLauchlan, received his primary
scholastic training at a public school
in North Ipswich, in which place he
spent the early years of his boyhood.
Upon the advent of his father to
the Villeneuve district the lad, then
only 10 years of age, as a matter of
course accompanied his family
thither, and after a few more years
of instruction at the provisional
school then established in that settle-
ment, followed in the footsteps of
his parent by becoming a teamster
at the early age of 14. His aptitude
for his work was such that Mr.
Robert McLauchlan soon saw that


he might be entrusted with the con-
trol of a special team, and forthwith
purchased bullocks for this purpose.
Full of confidence in himself and his
ability to achieve all that was re-
quired even of those of maturer
years, the boy threw himself into
his work with much energy and
push, and from that time onward
became wholly identified with the
timber industry in this district. In
earlier days, before the construction
of the railway line from Caboolture
to Kilcoy, after winning the big logs
from the virgin forest by difficult
and laborious work, he carted the
timber to the former centre, but
since the convenience of transport by
rail has removed the necessity for
these tedious journeys has devoted
the main portion of his time to
timber-getting, with the most satis-
factory results from a financial
standpoint. In addition to this
enterprise, however, Mr. McLauchlan
carries on grazing pursuits on a
holding of some hundreds of acres
which he owns in the same district,
and finds his time fairly well occu-
pied with the administration of his
private proposition. He is, never-
theless, keenly interested in the
advancement of the welfare of the
this important end. Upon the
retirement of Mr. P. J. McCauley
from the Shire Council of Kilcoy
in 1915, Mr. McLauchlan was
approached by the ratepayers and
prevailed upon to offer himself as a
candidate for the seat. Having con-
sented to this proposal, he was re-
turned unopposed, and subsequently,
when the ordinary election fell due

HERMAN KROPP, “Villeneuve
Dell,” Villeueuve, via Woodford,
was born at Holstein, Germany, on
January 9, 1860, and is a son of the
late Peter Kropp, who came to
MR. PETER KROPP.
Australia in 1863, deciding once for
all to throw in his lot with the sub-
jects of the British Empire, who were
starting on the great work of nation-
building in the big, empty island-
continent set in the southern seas,
which was then being colonized by
representatives of various European
countries. Upon arrival in Queens-
land with his wife and family of five
children—of whom Mr. Herman
Kropp was the youngest —he was en-
gaged by the late Sir Joshua Peter
Bell to assist in cotton-growing in
the vicinity of Ipswich. After
about two years he rented a
farm at Redbank Plains, and
started operations in the same
line of industry on his own
account. After some years, in 1868
he took up a selection near Pine
Mountain, and commenced the culti-
vation of cotton and maize on a
modest scale, continuing in this dis-
trict for about a decade. Having
met with an accident which occa-
sioned the loss of one hand, he
retired from active pursuits and
spent his declining years under the
care of a devoted son. He died at
Ipswich towards the close of the
eighties. Mr. Herman Kropp as a
boy attended a school at Pine Moun-
tain, where he received an elemen-
tary education, the facilities for in-
struction in those far-off days being
of a somewhat scant and meagre
character. In later days Mr. Kropp
made the best use of an opportunity
to attend night classes, and in this
way advanced his mental equipment
to some considerable extent, aug-
menting the earlier studies which the
frequent calls upon his time made by
the work of the farm had rendered
at the best rather desultory. He was
given the management of bullock
teams as soon as he could handle
them successfully, and although he
also gained some experience in other
bush avocations, was chiefly em-
ployed as a teamster until he reached
his 22nd year. About this time he
purchased his first holding at Kohlo,
on the Brisbane River, which he
made his headquarters and home
while he was engaged in timber-haul-
ing with bullocks. Subsequently he
removed to Ipswich with his family,
and in 1886 took a post as teamster,
when he became engaged in drawing
sawn timber to Caboolture on behalf
of Mr. Frank Villeueuve Nicholson,
to whom the honour of founding the
settlement known as “Villeueuve’ ’ is
due. Whilst in this employ Mr.
Kropp selected land at Oakey Creek,
but this property, however, re-
mained in his possession for a com-
paratively brief period, a removal
from the vicinity being made upon
the purchase of the homestead now
occupied by his youngest son, Mr.
Stanley Kropp. The area then
taken up by the gentleman under
review was of considerable size, and
for about 20 years he resided
thereon, giving his attention prin-
cipally to the dairying industry.
The estate was then divided
between the gentleman referred to
and Mr. Kropp’s eldest surviving
son, Mr. William George Kropp,
both of whom continue the industry
introduced by their father many
years ago, and in 1914 Mr. Kropp,
sen., retired to “Villeneuve Dell,”
where he now resides. A man of
considerable public spirit, he has
taken a prominent part in pushing
forward any movement set afoot
for the betterment of the district.
Among the public offices which he
has filled in the past was that of
councillor for Caboolture Shire, and
MR. HERMAN KROPP.
upon the severance of the Kilcoy
area from that body he was returned
to a seat in the new council, which
he has since retained. Upon the
outbreak of the war between Britain
and Germany Mr. Kropp proposed to
retire from public life, but his fellow-
councillors and the residents of the
district, recognizing the loyalty of
their friend and co-worker, refused to
listen to his request to be relieved of
his duties, forcing him to retain his
seat at the council table. To empha-
size the confidence placed in him by

since his naturalization in 1881. Mr.
Kropp married, in 1879, Mary Ann,
daughter of the late Peter Sampford,
one of the first settlers and pioneers
of Pine Mountain, where he was
specially connected with the early
timber industry. Of this union there
are two surviving sons.

where he first saw the light on
June 4, 1877. His father, the late
Samuel Webster, originally hailed
from Nottingham, England, where
generations of his name have been
engaged in agrarian pursuits; and
at 17 years of age left the Old
Country for Australia, his objective
being the northern colony of Queens-
land, which only recently had
attained to the dignity of self-
government. Landing at Moreton
Bay in 1861, he found the country
ringing with stories of outrages by
aborigines and bushrangers, and as
these gave way to reports of gold
discoveries, undeterred by possible
risks to life or property, he made his
way north to the locality which
afterwards became famous as the
well-known Gympie goldfield, and
spent a few months in courting the
smile of Dame Fortune as a miner
on the diggings. Failing to achieve
success in this direction, he shoul-
dered his swag, and journeying to
the Darling Downs, obtained his
first experience in the shearing-
sheds, which afterwards he fre-
quently revisited, in the off-seasons
returning to the Ipswich district,
where he managed an agricultural
farm for the widow of an old pioneer
named McEwan. By the year 1877
he had saved sufficient capital to
enable him to take up a block of
Crown land in the neighbourhood of
what has since become known as
Kilcoy, and here he started dairying
pursuits on his own account. Con-
siderable pluck and enterprise were
necessary to carry the early pioneers
through the initial hardships of their
undertakings, and the late Samuel
Webster experienced his full share
of the vicissitudes incidental to a
proposition of the nature of that
upon which he had embarked.
Among other arduous duties, he
was compelled to cart his butter,
bacon, eggs, etc., a distance of over
62 miles over bad or indifferent
roads to the Brisbane markets, and
this in all sorts of weather, needing
a big heart and brave spirit to face
the fatigue and unpleasantness of a
journey which had to be repeated at
very frequent intervals. Having
made up his mind at the outset,
however, to see the thing through,
he faced all the difficulties squarely,
prepared himself for the necessary
sacrifices, and worked with a will
to realize those youthful visions of
prosperity which had first impelled
laim to seek the larger scope of a new
country in which to test his ability
and energy, rather than rest content
in the more circumscribed conditions
imposed by the older civilization
which he had left behind him. The

had nobly shared with him all the
burdens of the day, making herself
the companion of his joys and sor-

SAMUEL WEBSTER, “West
Vale,’’ Villeneuve, was born at Bun-
damba, Queensland, on June 4,
1884, and is the second surviving
son of the late Samuel Webster, a
native of Nottingham, England,
whose career is outlined in the
preceding article. Mr. Samuel
Webster, like his elder brother,
duties, many and various, which
naturally devolved upon the elder
sons of the homestead, while the
parents were straining every nerve
to establish their enterprise upon a
sound footing and provide against
the contingencies of the future. The
young Queenslander learned very
early what it meant to be up before
daylight, helping with cattle or
working in the field, and to go to
rest at night tired out with unre-
mitting toil throughout the day; but
in these strenuous days he laid
the foundation for future success,
becoming familiarized with every
operations were set in train by
the new proprietor for felling the
trees and hauling the logs to the
mills at Villeneuve and Caboolture,
and for six years he continued this
business on his own account. At the
end of that period a partnership was
agreed upon between himself and
his elder brother, William, and to
the mutual benefit of both the con-
test with the forces of Nature in the
bush was continued, no less than
three bullock teams being kept con-
stantly at work in the forest. With
the capital amassed by his successful
venture in this direction, Mr.

William, received an elementary
education at the local public
schools at Villeneuve and West
Vale before starting active life
on the parental property. Whilst
yet of very tender years, and while
struggling with the mysteries of the
“Three R’s,” he had become accus-
tomed to the routine work of a farm
and had been pressed into service

detail of the industry carried on, and
gaining an experience which has
proved of the utmost value in his
subsequent career. Whilst still an
inmate of the parental home—where
he continued until his marriage—
Mr. Webster availed himself of
various opportunities that occurred
to take up land on his own account,
and at the age of 21 purchased from
Mr. Samuel Dickens a homestead
block, originally selected as a timber
proposition and taken over by the
young and enterprising farmer for
the same purpose. Almost at once
Samuel Webster acquired various
blocks of land, frequently selling at
a profit and buying again, and re-
taining the holdings most suitable
for the purpose he had in mind for
the future. By following out this
policy he built up a fine estate, and,
including the property which he in-
herited from his father, has now in
his possession close on 3,500 acres of
freehold, while he leases from pri-
vate owners some 3,000 acres of pas-
toral country, which he administers
personally, grazing being the prin-
cipal department of his enterprise.

and some of the paddocks have been
successfully planted with Rhodes
grass, which grows and thrives
abundantly in the district, making
and fattening of store cattle being
resorted to in addition to breeding,
of which Mr. Webster makes some-
thing of a hobby, specializing in the


Hereford and polled classes of stock,
These breeds have been developed by
him to a considerable extent, bulls
descended from some of the best
herds in the State having been used
to improve the type from time to
time, and the “West Vale” cattle
have proved their own best adver-
tisement, being a very profitable
branch of Mr. Webster’s industry.
A special advantage of this locality
as a grazing area is found in the
abundant water supply, the country
here being as well watered as
any part of Queensland. Mr. Web-
ster is especially fortunate in this
respect, “West Vale” having a
frontage of about four miles to the
devoted, good post-and-wire fences
separating the numerous paddocks,
which have been suitably arranged
for the grazing of a large number of
stock and for mixed farming, the
latter being carried on by Mr.
Webster on a limited scale, com-
pared with his stock-grazing and
breeding operations. The dairying
department, however, is of consider-
able importance, and various classes
of crops are raised, both for use on
the farm and for the local markets.
Mr. Webster, even from his youth,
has been recognized as one of the
progressive spirits whose influence
alone is so beneficial to the com-
munity of which they form a part,

played a worthy part in the develop-
ment of industrial and trading pur-
suits in the infant colony. The late
Mr. Williams was first engaged in a

trict, and subsequently he took up
land between Kilcoy and Colinton,
which he worked for over 40 years,
during that lengthy period establish-
ing a reputation for energy, indus-
try, and uprightness of character

been constructed to provide against
any possible shortage—making the
property one of the most valuable to
be found in the vicinity. Although
much of the natural timber has al-
ready been cut out on the estate, a
large quantity of the most valuable

are felled and the land which they

shire farmer and provision purveyor.
The gentleman under review re-
ceived his education, in the first
instance, at Ti-tree Creek, after-
wards attending a public school at
Esk, and completing his school
course at the larger centre of Ips-
wich, where he remained until 15
years of age. He next turned his
hand to the duties of his father’s
farm, and spent about four years
there, in the course of which he
learnt much that has proved useful
to him in his subsequent career. In
the last year of his teens his father,
who was a man of considerable
enterprise and initiative, launched
out in the direction of timber-
getting, an industry which was even
more profitable in those days than
at the present time, and Mr. E. G.
Williams was chosen for the respon-
sible task of taking charge of the
first team of bullocks sent out into
the virgin forest on this new depar-
ture. The project flourishing, this
team proved but the forerunner of
others, by which the fortunes of the
worthy founder of the Williams

his death occurring at the age of 52.
Mr. E. G. Williams continued at
this work for some five years, when
owing to the decease of his father
the work with the teams was
discontinued, the surviving members
of the family having decided to apply
themselves more closely to the de-
velopment of their land. The gentle-
man under review almost immedi-
ately betook himself to a selection
on Arababy Creek, near Colinton,
which he had previously taken up
on his own account, and with vigour
and industry commenced the im-
provement of his holding. He worked
this property for about four years,
about the close of which period he
received an offer to exchange the
block on Arababy Creek for his pre-
sent property at Mount Kilcoy,
consisting of a homestead and sur-
rounding acres. After giving this
important question sufficient con-
sideration he decided to make the
exchange, giving weight to the argu-
ment that the “Hill View” land was
better suited to the dairying indus-
try than that upon which he was
then residing. Accordingly, in 1910,
a removal was made to his present
home, where he has since applied
himself assiduously to dairy farm-
ing, with its subsidiary industries,

root crops, and lucerne being made

proposition. Mr. Williams is a firm
believer in the Jersey strain, and has
crossed his former shorthorn herd
with the Jersey blood, attaining
satisfactory results by this proce-
dure. He also breeds pigs on a
modest scale, most of which are sent
to the metropolis to be disposed of.
The property is admirably adapted
to the purposes for which it is used,
and has amply repaid Mr. Williams’
efforts to make it deserving of the
name of a model farm. The Kilcoy
Creek, upon which the holding is
situated, flows through many other
properties devoted to dairying, but
it is safe to say that, for its size,
“Hill View” compares favourably
with them all. The advantage of
the watercourses referred to cannot
be lightly estimated, its waters, fed
by springs from the surrounding
mountains, having never been known
to fail. The country over which Mr.
Williams’ property stretches is
chiefly undulating, with some useful
flats on the banks of the creek, and
good shelter is afforded by the native
timbers which, in many instances,
have been left standing for that pur-
pose. Although 11 miles from the
Kilcoy railway station, it is con-
sidered to be sufficiently in touch

ducted with an assurance of profit,

followed the trade of blacksmith in
Ipswich for some time, but his

foundation of the colony. He first
became a journeyman butcher in
Ipswich, having followed this occu-
pation in the country of his birth,
but within a short time he was
able to enter upon the more con-
genial employment of farming on a
holding of his own. The property
was situated at Ti-Tree Creek,
between Ipswich and Esk, and here

of the pioneer agriculturist and
dairy-farmer under the primitive
conditions which rendered his task
an uphill one at the best. In some
parts of the country no routes were
marked out, and such roadways as
had already been constructed were
of the roughest character. Add to
the difficulty of conveying produce
over such tracks (or no tracks) to the
nearest market, the disappointment
of there finding no demand for the
commodity, or prices so low as to
leave hardly any margin of profit
for the producer, and an idea may
be gained of some of the difficulties
encountered by the early settlers.
After working this selection for some
time, Mr. Williams took up a block of
land from the Government, situated
on Nera Creek, in the vicinity of
Colinton, and inaugurated operations,
specializing in the manufacture of
cheese, for which he was able to secure
an excellent market in the metropolis,
and was a pioneer in this depart-
ment of the dairying industry after
closer settlement was established in
the district. The breeding of pigs
and the manufacture of bacon pro-
ducts also absorbed a large share of
attention from Mr. Williams and
his family, the members of which
enjoyed an excellent education in all
the details of successful manage-
ment of a proposition of the kind
upon which they were mutually
embarked. As the result of an
accident whilst engaged in the work
of the farm, Mr. Williams’ health
began to decline, and despite the
fact that he was able to visit the
Old Country in search of expert
medical skill, after a somewhat
lengthened term of retirement his
death occurred at Ipswich in his
fifty-fifth year. Sincere eulogium
may be passed upon the memory of
the late Mr. Williams, who made the
best type of settler, being honest
and upright in his dealings, thrifty
and industrious, and withal pos-
sessed of a fund of useful knowledge
and experience, the result of his
early training in England. Not

the least of his services to the
State of his adoption was the rear-
ing of a family of five sons and five
daughters, all of whom have married
and established homes of their own.
These sons and daughters were mostly
grown to manhood and womanhood
when their father’s demise took
place, and by mutual agreement the
old home with its surrounding acres
was placed in the market, and each
went forth to make his own way in
the world. Among them was the
gentleman under review, who claims
as his native place the town of
Ipswich, where he first saw the light
on July 11, 1889. He obtained his
scanty education at Gregor Creek,
in the school which was built on a
site presented to the local com-
mittee by the late Samuel Williams,
with the object of securing for his
own children and those of neigh-
bouring settlers the advantages of
instruction by properly qualified
teachers. His years of study, per-
force, were few, as in the case of
other youngsters on the pioneer
dairy farms his services w r ere too
valuable in connection with the herd
to be dispensed with for a prolonged
period. Before and after school
hours, children hardly beyond the
years of infancy became accustomed
to such demands on their time as
left them no leisure for recreation,
and handling the cattle became a
matter of second nature. To this
work Mr. Arthur Williams applied
himself as a matter of course, and


before entering his teens lie left
school, and henceforward was con-
tinuously employed on the parental
farm until the place was sold. In
1910, when the “Kilcoy” Estate was
cut up for closer settlement, he
availed himself of the opportunity
to purchase a block of land, 200
acres in extent, within a mile of
Kilcoy township, and upon this area
commenced dairying and mixed
farming on a moderate scale. Subse-
quently he secured a larger property,
purchasing in 1913 the farm for-
merly owned by Mr. Joseph Zink,
upon which had been erected a good
homestead and outbuildings suitable
to the carrying on of the dairying
industry. This farm, which com-
prises 800 acres, is administered by
Mr. Williams in conjunction with
the Kilcoy block and other land
which he leases in the vicinity.
Dairying, grazing, and cropping are
the principal branches of his indus-
try, the cultivation of a limited
area of land being carried on to
supply the requirements of the home
proposition. A specialty is made of
shorthorn cattle, the sires used being
of the purest type, immediate de-
scendants of imported stock, from

the most approved principles known

situated 12 miles from Kilcoy,
though it makes no boast of modern
architecture, commands more than
more or less undulating paddocks,
and the locality is partly enclosed by
a semi-circle of precipitous hills,
which makes a most picturesque

charming homestead sites in the

watered, and in its original state,

the late Samuel Webster, a pioneer
of 1861, who spent a varied career
in Queensland, being in turn en-
gaged in mining, pastoral, and agri-
cultural occupations at Gympie, the
Darling Downs, and in the Moreton
Bay district. Two sons and a
daughter are the result of this
union.

village bearing that name—on May
7, 1868, and is a son of the late
George Hawkins, of Holcombe,
Devonshire, England, who came to
Australia in the year 1865 by the
ship “Venelia,” accompanied by
his wife and five children, a sixth
being born at sea during the course
of the voyage. The late gentleman
was induced to take the important
step of relinquishing all the associa-
tions of his earlier days and of com-
ing to test his fortune in a new coun-
try by the reports—painted in glow-
ing colours —of his wife’s brothers,
Messrs. John and William Elworthy,
who had been already settled in
Queensland for some considerable
time prior to the advent of their
relatives from Devonshire. The
Elworthys were well and prominently
known in the early pastoral history
of the State as owners of “Imbil”
and “Dovedale” Stations, near
Gympie, where they were numbered
among the pioneer settlers; besides
which they figured as successful
timber-getters on the banks of the
Mary River, which was a region of
veritable treasure to these enterpris-
ing men by reason of the splendid
untouched growth of the valuable
cedar trees, which flourished in pro-
lific profusion in the virgin bush of
that district. The late George Haw-
kins was a member of an old
Devonian farming family, who fol-
lowed agricultural pursuits for
generations in their native county,
and, true to the traditions of his
parentage, upon his arrival in
Queensland, after a voyage extend-
ing over 17 weeks, he turned his
attention to the industry in which
he had been brought up, and
immediately took steps towards the
acquirement of land for farming
purposes. After a short stay in
Brisbane, he engaged a bullock team
to take himself and his family to the

proceeded upon its development. At
that period cotton was regarded as
the most marketable crop by Queens-
land growers, and Mr. Hawkins de-
voted his energies principally to the
cultivation of this plant,
receiving substantial encour-
agement from the Govern-
ment in the shape of the
usual bonus on his crop.
When this was discontinued
he engaged in g-neral
farming operations, making
dairying the principal de-
partment, and in course of
time, as his boys became of
an age to give him the neces-
sary assistance, he added a
butchering business to his
other enterprises, which
proved a profitable depar-
ture, and by degrees, as the
result of unremitting effort,
this worthy founder of his
line on Australian soil built
up a thoroughly prosperous
proposition, and “Stock-
leigh” became well able
to hold its own as one
of the leading properties
of the Logan district. The late
George Hawkins, after 35 years of
useful life in the country of his
adoption, died at the age of 72 years.

grew to manhood and went out into
the world to start life for them-
selves, they turned instinctively to
landed pursuits, and conjointly took
up a considerable tract of
country at the head of the
Logan River, where they
carried on grazing occupa-
tions for a number of years.
After disposing of their
interests in the Logan
district, Mr. Thomas Haw-
kins and his younger brother,
Edward Albert, formed a
partnership which ex-
tended over a lengthy
period, during which they
pursued a very successful
joint career as pastoralists.
They took up a block of
land on “Yabba” Station,
and subsequently became
the purchasers of “Cow
Wah” and “Louisavale,”
both cattle properties of
some prominence, which
they worked profitably. In
1905 it was mutually de-
cided by the brothers to
divide their interests and
dissolve partnership, and
in the apportioning of
the properties each retained a por-
tion of “Louisavale,” while “Cow

convictions and gifts of speech,
which made him an acceptable lay
preacher in the Protestant churches
of the neighbourhood, he earned the
respect and esteem of all with whom
he came into contact. His counsel
was sought and readily given on
many occasions of difficulty in pri-
vate or public matters, and his
example was often followed when no
word of advice had been asked or
proffered. One with him in aim and
outlook was his good wife, who
passed a“way several years prior to


As far back as 29 years ago
in 1887, Mr. Thomas Hawkins
selected the holding upon which he
formed his permanent home, known
as “Court-le-Roi," a block of some

1,280 acres, to which he has since
added by purchase a further
1,600 acres. In the present year
(1916) he has further increased his
possessions by the acquisition of
“Bonnie Doon,” a freehold property
of over 700 acres, situated on the
Brisbane River, and about six miles
from the homestead where Mr. Haw-
kins resides. The home paddocks
produce excellent pasturage, and are
utilized for purposes of fattening,
drafts of stock being brought
periodically from “Bonnie Doon”
Station, in the Leichhardt district,
in which central-western property
Mr. Hawkins possesses an interest.
His operations are on a fairly large
scale, and during the season of 1915
the cost of carriage on drafts of
cattle from “Bonnie Doon” Station
amounted to no less than £9OO.
Some of these were trucked for re-
lief made necessary through the con-
ditions of drought then prevailing,
and have since been sent back to the
western areas, while others were
bullocks brought east for fattening
purposes. In the year above-men-
tioned he effected sales of over 800
fat bullocks from “Court-le-Roi”
and his “Louisavale” block, which
latter property, consisting of some
9,000 freehold acres, lies about 12
miles distant from the homestead.
In the past he has also owned other
properties, among which “Duca-
brook” Station, near Springsure,
once remained in his possession for
some years, but this was afterwards
purchased by his youngest brother,
before referred to, who is the pro-
prietor of various pastoral interests
in the same district. In 1912 Mr.
Thomas Hawkins became interested
in the timber industry, and erected
a timber mill on his portion of
“Louisavale,” investing several
thousands of pounds in the venture,
which, almost literally, “went up in
smoke," the mill, which was in full
working swing and giving employ-
ment to over 20 persons, being burnt

the founder. “Court-le-Roi” is
situated about 80 miles from Bris-
bane, in the shire of Esk. The home-
stead was erected in the year 1901,
and did duty in its original form for
a number of years, but in 1914 a
move was made to enlarge and im-
prove the old building, which has
been so skilfully dealt with that it
now presents the attractive appear-
ance of a modern residence, and with
regard to the interior also ranks as
one of the model homes of the neigh-
bourhood. The house has a south-
erly aspect, and stands on a pictur-
esque site at the foot of a command-
ing eminence, which gives a beauty
all its own to the place so fitly chosen
by Mr. Hawkins for his home close
on 30 years ago. The surrounding
country, originally forming part of
the old “Colinton” Station, is equal
in richness to any of the sister hold-
ings which commanded such good
prices when that fine estate was sub-
divided for purposes of closer settle-
ment. It is generously timbered,
providing excellent shelter for the
stock, and has a good water supply
in the creeks and other surface water
which is found in abundance every-
where, in this and virtually every
other respect being regarded as an
ideal property for the purpose for
which it is used by the owner. Mr.
Hawkins, who has attained to his
present prosperous position by pur-
suance of a policy of tremendous in-
dustry, which led him frequently to
be up and out all night in divers
kinds of weather, watching the
cattle and safeguarding his interests
in every direction, has practically
carved out his own career with but
little assistance from others. He

fellow-settlers of the early days. The
father of Jonathan Carseldine was one
of those who, casting off the shackles
of outworn habits and customs which
were stunting the lives of men of
certain classes in the Old Land,
made the "launch out into the deep”
represented by emigration to one or
other of Britain’s overseas colonies.
His native county was Bedfordshire,
and although somewhat changed in
orthography, the name of Carsel-
dine is yet one to conjure with in
that part of England, representing
the fine old yeoman stock which may
be termed the backbone of the
British race, and which gave the
flower of its youth when the fullness
of time arrived to people the vast
spaces of Canada and Australia, and
thus graft a new and strong shoot
on the parent tree. The late Wil-
liam Carseldine, grandfather of the
gentleman under review, and founder
of his family line in Queensland,
voyaged from England by the sailing
ship “Simoon” in 1853, and settled
at Bald Hills, where he was engaged
among the actual pioneers of the
agricultural industry in this State,
and made a reputation for himself
which extended even to the Darling
Downs, which in those distant days
was looked upon as quite a remote
region. He lived to threescore years
and ten, passing the Great Divide
in the country to which he had come
as a stranger many years before.
Mr. Jonathan Carseldine was 12
years of age when he arrived with
his father in the land of the South-
ern Cross, and subsequently for a
time he was employed in a butcher-
ing business in Brisbane, the capital
of Queensland being then but little
more than a village. Afterwards he
turned his hand to station work,
obtaining a position on "Baram-
bah,” then in possession of Messrs.
Fereter and Jones, where he served
in the capacity of general hand,
and as gradually he began to feel
his feet he acquired a holding at
Upper Caboolture, where for many
years he conducted a dairying pro-
position, with the development- of
which, he persevered in the face of
many obstacles, created by the
primitive condition of things gener-
ally in a colony not far advanced out
of its infancy. The crude methods
of procedure then in vogue even in
more civilized parts, the uncertainty
of the markets, and other draw-
backs, made Mr. Carseldine’s task a
far from easy one, but with com-
mendable pluck and unremitting
industry he finally overcame all diffi-
culties, and with the assistance of
his growing family had to struggle
before they attained the easier
circumstances in which in many
instances they were able to spend
their declining years. He retired
about the year 1908, having spent
a useful life in the country of his
adoption, and now, at 75 years of
age, can look back with pride and

him as the eldest of a pioneering
family to obtain in the days of his
youth. He has, however, in later
times, made up in a great measure
for the limited opportunities of his


boyhood years, gleaning a wealth of
knowledge, not only from desultory
reading, but by setting himself with
application to master such subjects
as specially appealed to him as
worth the effort of study. He left
the parental roof in the last year of
his teens, and set out to “make
his fortune” in the nearest and most
natural way, on his own account,
selecting what might be called a
historic block of land, in so far that
it was the last homestead taken up
under the terms of the 1876 Land
Act. This was situated at New
Country Creek, in the Kilcoy dis-
trict, and provided ample scope for
Mr. Carseldine’s activities in his
spare time, his scheme being to
carry on the early stages of develop-
ment on his own property, whilst
ready for an advance movement,
and accordingly made choice of his
present “Strathblane” property,
located on Sandy Creek, some six
miles distant from the township of
Kilcoy. Making this a nucleus, Mr.
Carseldine gradually increased the
area of country in his possession in
this locality, pushing out his bound-
ary lines until they enclosed about
2,500 acres of the most highly
improved country for grazing and
mixed-farming purposes in the
neighbourhood. Here he has con-
tinued ever since, personally super-
vising all his interests, which include
the original block at New Country
Creek, and reaping the reward of
his hard work and sacrifices of
earlier years in an increasing pros-
perity. He has made a feature of
a member of the first council, and
filled the office of chairman during
the year 1915. He has also
served as chairman of the Kil-
coy State School Committee for
the past five years, an office he still
holds. He is a trustee of the local
school of arts, and of the Kilcoy
Hospital, and in every way in his
power has served these institutions.
He was the first president of the
Kilcoy branch of the Farmers’
Union, and still, as vice-president,
takes a prominent part in the de-
liberations of this useful organiza-
tion. He also acted as a trustee and
honorary secretary to the cemetery
board until that institution was
vested in the Shire Council. The

employing the main portion of his
days in working for wages on neigh-
bouring farms. In this way he was
able to earn at the rate of £3O per
annum and his keep, and even out
of this small sum he contrived to
save a little capital, so that by very
careful financing he soon found him-
self in a position to give the whole
of his time to the building up of his
own particular proposition. After
his marriage in 1890 he started in
the dairying industry on this hold-
ing, and continuing the policy of
diligence and thrift which had
answered so well in the past, in
course of time, when the “Kilcoy”
Estate was subdivided for closer
settlement by the Government of

settlers of the district, Mr. Carsel-

the various channels of local public

munity gains his whole-hearted
support. He accepted the Commis-

Peter Duncan, a worthy old pioneer,
who was born in Aberdeenshire,
Scotland, on April 13, 1830. Mr.

the difficult conditions prevailing

citizens in the persons of his family
of sons and daughters, who have
followed in the footsteps of their
father, assisting in the upbuilding
of the Empire by steady continu-
ance in one or other of the fields of
labour by which the prosperity of a
country is maintained. Upon his
first arrival from the land of his
birth in Queensland, he obtained
employment as a shepherd on “Bim-
bian” Station, on the Condamine,
under Mr. Thomas De Moffat; but
being then in the flower of his
youth, and full of strength and
vigour, he found this occupation far
too monotonous and lacking in the
promise df promotion which his
ambition demanded. Understanding
the temper of the young Scotsman
in their employ, the proprietors of
the same station gave him the
charge of a team of bullocks, which
drew the old-fashioned dray of the
period, and the management of
which he very soon mastered. Find-
ing this work more to his mind, he
retained the position until lie had
saved sufficient capital wherewith to
start for himself, making the neces-
sary sacrifices with this end in view,
and often denying himself almost
the essentials of existence in his
endeavours to reach the objective
which he had made his goal. The
"salt beef and damper” of the
stockman were almost his only

railway to these western districts
put an end to the carting of wool,
and being thus robbed of his princi-

pursuits in the late seventies. His

timber from his own selection, he
purchased, standing forest from
adjoining properties, and with the
assistance of his son, supplied the
local mills, even carrying the timber
over rough and badly-made roads as
far as Caboolture. The fine old
pioneer never shirked his share of
hard manual labour, working with
his own hands until he was well
over 70 years of age —truly a won-
derful record. In 1905 his wife died,
and he then relinquished active pur-
suits, and has since lived with his
youngest son at Yilleneuve. Mr.
George Robert Duncan received the
rudiments of education locally, but
owing to prevailing circumstances
his school days were necessarily
limited, the demand upon him to
financial side of the business. Shortly
afterwards, however, he married,
and started on his own account with
teams in the timber industry, work-
ing hard to ensure success. In the
meantime he selected a homestead
block, situated about a quarter of
a mile from his present holding,
which he worked for five years,
whilst still continuing his operations
in the virgin forests. In 1890 he
added to his landed interests by the
selection of his present holding, and
almost immediately set to work with
the assistance of his father to build
with his own hands the old-fashioned
but comfortable home which he now
occupies. This step was rendered
imperative by the flood of that year,
which devastated the homes of many
of the settlers, among them those of
“Kilcoy” Station prior to the days
of registered brands. Mr. Duncan
belongs to the conscientious section
of the community, the members of
which recognize their responsibility
in regard to public affairs, and
accordingly co-operate by organized
effort for the advancement of all
that promises to promote the general
wellbeing of that quarter of the
world in which they reside. His
endeavours in this direction are
quiet and unobtrusive, but it is
understood that his assistance may
be relied upon whenever solicited.
He was married in 1886 to Eliza-
beth, daughter of the late James
Brown, the founder of a flourish-
ing grazing proposition known as
“Brownville,” at Deep Creek, in the
Esk district; and the worthy couple
assist in the maintenance of the
family interfering with the time
which would otherwise have been
devoted to study. This was the
common lot of the settlers’ children,
and was accepted by them as the
natural order of things, the Educa-
tion Acts of a later date not then
being in existence. As soon as a boy
or girl could be of use on the farm
or in the home their services were
requisitioned, and study had to be
set aside, except in such instances as
when a strong demand for knowledge
led to the devoting of evening hours
to self-appointed tasks. Before he
entered his teens Mr. Duncan was
placed by his father in charge of a
bullock team, and on reaching man’s
estate he was’given an interest in the

both Mr. Duncan and his father.
From that time onwards he has kept
in view the enlargement of his
boundaries, and has lost no opportu-
nity of securing additional blocks of
land suitable to his purpose in the
vicinity of the original holding, until
at the present time he owns about
1,000 acres of excellent grazing and
agricultural country, in the admin-
istration of which he is aided by the
efficient co-operation of his sons,
whilst he himself works with the
teams in the timber industry. The
homestead is situated on the banks
of the Kilcoy Creek, about three
miles distant from the township of
that name, and has obtained its
quaint nomenclature from the two
letters of the old brand used on
has brought up a family of eight
sons and five daughters, three of
whom are married and settled on
the land in the neighbourhood of
Kilcoy. To Mrs. Duncan all honour
is due for the part she has played in
assisting her husband in his enter-
prise, accepting the inevitable call
to self-sacrifice, tending her house
and family, and battling bravely
with the adverse conditions which at
times made the lot of the early
settlers’ wives a far from enviable
one. To such the gratitude of pos-
terity is due, and some record,
however brief, is fitting to preserve
the names and deeds of the mothers
of the Australian race, among whom
the lady in question holds an
honoured place.


CHARLES BLOOMFIELD,
“Freewood,” Kilcoy, was born at
Brisbane, Queensland, on August 6,
1874, and is the only child of the
late Charles Henry Bloomfield, a
native of Gfoulbum, New South
Wales, whose father was one of the

earliest ministers of religion to
preach the Gospel in Australia. The
latter gentleman, who was associated
with the Anglican communion, be-
fore his advent to the land of the
Southern Cross, was well known in
various centres of Great Britain,
where for some considerable time he
had exercised his gifts as a priest in
holy orders. After crossing the
ocean to the antipodes, he followed
his calling as a clergyman in the
Mother State, eventually returning
to the Old Country, but leaving be-
hind him his son, Charles Henry
Bloomfield, who became one of the
earliest selectors in the district sur-
rounding the present town of War-
wick, in Queensland. It was in this
comparatively old settlement that
the gentleman under review received
his education, under the tuition of
one of the notables of the time, Cap-
tain Desbois, a well-known and
public-spirited Frenchman, who re-
sided on the Darling Downs, and
was recognized as a capable instruc-
tor, many of Queensland’s most
successful men having owed to him
practically all their scholastic equip-
ment. Though he was obliged to
leave school at an early age, Mr.
Bloomfield bears grateful tribute to
the memory of his old preceptor, who
grounded him so carefully in the
elements of education that, although
his years of study were but few, he
has always been able to hold his own
among his fellows, from time to
time, as opportunity occurred, aug-
menting his store of knowledge by
means of private study. He was but
14 years old when he obtained a
position on “Camboon” Station, on
the Dawson River, and so diligently
did he apply himself to the duties
of this post that soon he had all
matters connected with the manage-
ment of stock at his fingers’ ends.
At 17 he was entrusted with the
task of droving large mobs from the
Dawson to the Logan district, and
whilst on these trips ran the gamut
of hard experiences, which too fre-
quently were the lot of stockmen in
those early days. Throughout, how-
ever, he acquitted himself so admir-
ably, and was so uniformly success-
ful in his undertakings, that in

course of time the most valuable
drafts of cattle were placed under his
care to be overlanded to New South
Wales on behalf of Messrs. Bell and
Hyde, the owners of the station.
The management of a property was
the next upward step on the ladder,
and when only just out of his teens
Mr. Bloomfield attained to this dig-
nity, the control of “Louisvale”
being placed in his hands, a charge
he retained for 11 years, when the
property was sold. In the late nine-
ties, with the purpose in view of
launching out on his own account,
he selected a block of land on the
Brisbane River near “Louisvale,”
and some 50 miles distant from the
township of Esk, which was then the
nearest settlement, and here he spent
some years in grazing enterprise.
Selling out about the period that
‘Durundur” Station was thrown
open for selection by the Govern-
ment of the day, Mr. Bloomfield
next acquired a holding on that
estate, and subsequently, when “Kil-
coy” run was subdivided under the
repurchased estates regulations, he
chose a homestead area from the
tract of country here offered for sale.
The “Freewood” area stretches over
about 243 acres of land, which has
proved very suitable for farming
purposes. In addition, grazing is
carried on on a fairly extensive
scale, and Mr. Bloomfield has given
considerable attention to the breed-
ing of draught horses, the strain
favoured for this purpose being
the progeny of the most successful
stud draughts of the well-known
“Maryvale” Station, which estab-
lished the highest record in the
State, and these have been
used in the “Freedwood” breed-
ing paddocks with the best results.
Whilst giving the most careful heed
to his private interests, the subject
of this review has played a pro-
minent part in the advancement of
the district in which he resides, and
has made his influence felt in the
foundation and building-up of the
various organizations by which a
healthy and virile community mani-
fests the soundness of its constitu-
tion. He was one of the original

secure the necessary support, with
the result that the project was car-

sion. Mr. Bloomfield at present
holds the office of trustee on behalf
of the Government for certain local
Crown lands. He was married in
1898 to Miss Frances Harriet Young,

in the year 1870. It was nearly 20
years previously—in the early fifties
—that Mr. Young first arrived in
Queensland and spent a number of
years in the Dawson River district,

were the portion of every early
settler. When the old “Mount Kil-
coy” out-station—of which he had
been manager for over 20 years —
was sold, Mr. Young took up his
residence on his own property,

but in common with most
of the sons of pioneer
parents his hours of study
were cut short by the de-
mands that were made upon
him for assistance in the
duties of the home farm.
He remained under the
parental rooftree until
nearly 40 years of age,
making one of a common-
wealth of brothers who only
left home when the pros-
perity of their father’s pro-
position had been assured,
and not until 1907 was he
tempted to launch out on
his own account, the
“Emerald View” site then
winning his approval, upon
purchase of which he took
up his residence upon his
own acres and began

upon the resignation of Dr. Rowe
from the first council, and receiving
unopposed election on a subsequent
occasion. He always manifests
a deep interest in the general
welfare of the district, and leaves no
stone unturned in his efforts for its
advancement. A member of a lead-
ing Roman Catholic family, he gives
considerable attention to all matters
connected with the prosperity of this
Church in the district, and for many
years he was closely associated with
Hibernian interests in and about
Esk, being one of seven who formed
the first Hibernian Lodge in that
town. Mr. Conroy’s favourite re-
creations are fishing and shooting,
and he also devotes what leisure he
can spare to the perusal of a fairly-
wide range of authors. He married,
in 1908, Ellen, daughter of the late
Thomas Carew, a member of a very
old family of agriculturists of New-
town, County Tipperary, Ireland.

property, which he has continued
successfully ever since. The very
modern and up-to-date homestead
built by Mr. Conroy for the occu-
pation of his family is situated one
and a half miles from the township
of Kilcoy, and surrounding it are
the wide pasture lands where the
sleek herd of dairy cattle range in
search of the succulent grasses. Tire
scope of Mr. Conroy’s operations
embraces dairying and cattle-grazing,
and to these two branches of pastoral
enterprise he practically confine's his
activities, so far as his own private
interests are concerned. In public
affairs, however, he takes a fairly
prominent part, and besides his
duties as a Justice of the Peace, to
which Commission he was appointed
by the Denham Administration in
1915, he has held a seat for a lengthy
and continuous period on the board
of the Shire Council of Kilcoy, being
elected to represent the ratepayers

Brigade” in the year 1869, this
being his second trip to the land of
the Southern Cross. Hailing from
Birmingham, where his progenitors
for several generations have been en-
gaged in trading pursuits, Mr. Tay-
lor can trace the annals of his family
back to a time when its members
were directly related to many of the
foremost personalities of Church and
State resident in that historic city.

his youth crossed the ocean to New

years. Returning to his native land
he married Miss Emily Mcßae, and
shortly afterwards sailed for Aus-
tralia. Landing in Queensland he
proceeded to the South Pine River
district, and selected a farming pro-
perty which proved a profitable in-
vestment. Here Mr. Taylor laboured
until 1891, when he retired from
active pursuits and subsequently took
up his residence at Auchenflower,
where he is now (1916) spending
the wister of his days in the
companionship of the good wife who
has shared with him all the joys
and disappointments of the years.
Mr. Taylor, sen., who is now over
fourscore years of age, has a -surviv-
ing family of eight children, one of
whom, having given himself for the
defence of his country, is now serv-
ing at the front as a member of the
2nd Light Horse, A.1.E., while the
others are settled in various parts
of Queensland. His eldest son, Mr.
Howard Hedley Taylor, of “Hidden
Valley,” was born at Birmingham
on New Year’s Day, 1869, in which
year he was brought by his parents
to Australia, and subsequently re-
ceived his education at the- Samford
State School. At 14 he began work
in good earnest, and from then on
to his nineteenth year he was
associated with his father, gaining
considerable experience of the
various branches of the farming
industry. In 1870 he went out
west, where he obtained the
post of stockman on “Terrick”
Station, in the- Barcoo district, and
some time later he spent nearly
three years in a similar capacity on
“Hamilton Downs,” where eventu-
ally he took the position of overseer.
Taking a trip to North Queensland,
he returned from there to the locality
where his childhood had been spent,
and here took over on lease the old
paternal property, which be carried
on for a number of years. When
the “Kilcoy” Estate was thrown
open for selection, Mr. Taylor took
up his present holding, upon which
lie erected a homestead and began to
place matters in train to work it on
mixed-farming lines, with dairying
as the principal factor in the scheme.
For this purpose the property has
proved eminently suitable, and since
his advent to the place Mr, Taylor

has embraced favourable occasions
for increasing his acres and making
the estate of sufficient dimensions to
serve as a grazing farm. “Hidden
Valley” is situated about four miles
from the township of Kilcoy, and is
a well-watered property, stretching
over undulating country and scrub
land, suitable both for pastoral and
agricultural purposes, for which it
is utilized by the owner. Mr. Tay-
lor, although fully engaged in the
management of his farm, has never
been a shirker of his public respon-
sibilities, and wherever he has found
himself has assumed his share of
work on behalf of the community.
The inception of the Kilcoy Shire
Council gave the ratepayers of the
shire their opportunity to elect him
as one of their councillors, and he
has sat at the council table ever
since, being honoured by election to
the chair in 1916, an office which he
fills with becoming dignity. He is
also president of the local War
Council and Recruiting Committee,
and has occupied many other offices
of trust, taking an active interest
in all that concerns the welfare of
the district. Mr. Taylor was ap-
pointed a Justice of the Peace by
the Ryan Cabinet in 1916. He was
married in 1896 to Alice, daughter
of the late Benjamin Goldsmith, of
Maryborough, a well-known identity
and pioneer of that district, and has
three daughters.


JOSEPH CLEMENS FERDI-
NAND FERLING, “Hanover”
Park, Kilcoy, is a native of Han-
over, Germany, where he was born
on October 22, 1844, his father being
the late Frederich Ferling, who died
while the gentleman under review
was yet an infant in arms. Young
Ferling was sent to a local school,
and at the termination of his studies
turned his hand to agricultural pur-
suits until he reached the age of 20,
when, according to the law of con-
scription in force in his native land,
he was enrolled for military train-
ing. A few months later, however,
he was discharged on account of hav-
ing broken his leg as the result of
an accident, and subsequently his
thoughts were directed to Australia
as a region offering possibilities un-
attainable by him in the land of his
fathers. The upshot of this consider-
ation was a desire to emigrate to
Queensland, which, less than a de-
cade previously, had established her
right to self-government as an inde-
pendent colony, and was encourag-
ing land settlement in the various
country districts and promoting local
industries in every possible way. The
young man of 20 indulged in dreams
of founding his name and line under
1866, having completed his arrange-
ments for leaving the land of his
birth he sailed from the old world

bright anticipations doomed to tem-
porary disappointment, as the coun-
try was just passing through a period
of depression, and rather than work
for the sum of a shilling a day,
which was offered him, he took to
the bush, carrying his swag to
fortune, and having by this time im-
proved his knowledge of the country
and become to some extent initiated
into the ruling conditions of Austra-
lian life, it was with more confidence
in himself that he started on his
travels. Facing west and north
by turns, he pursued his journey
through the bush, and arriving at
“Auburn” Station, then owned by
the late Mr. Pigott, was successful
in obtaining employment at a wage
of £4O a year. For the two years
that he continued in this position he
saved every penny of the money,
having learnt in the bitter school of
experience that capital was abso-
lutely necessary to enable him to
break away from the chains of servi-
tude and establish interests on his
own account, which was his ultimate
intention. Receiving the offer of
£52 per annum as boundary rider
from the late Sir Joshua Peter Bell,
he transferred his services to “Jim-
bour” Station, and after five years,
during which he continued the policy
of thrift and economy which he had
already made a habit, in 1877 he
found himself in a position to make
a beginning for himself. In the year
1877, when a portion of the large

a position as shepherd at £3O per

ing there for somewhat less than a
year, he again set out to better his
“Kilcoy” Station was opened up for
selection by the Government of the
day, Mr. Ferling chose as his initial
purchase for a home a block of 400
acres, upon which has since been


erected the pretty homestead known
as “Hanover” Park. Starting on a
small scale, he stocked these pastures
with a few head of cattle and sheep,
and carried on grazing and breeding
operations, watching the markets,
and buying and selling to the best
advantage as occasion allowed. He
also found his prospects sufficiently
encouraging to justify an extension
of boundary, and with enlarged pas-
tures was enabled to stock more
heavily, and so gradually acquired
more important interests in the dis-
trict and established his reputation
as one of the industrious and depend-
able class of settlers who have done
so much to place the country of
Queensland in the satisfactory posi-
tion which it occupies among the
sister States of the Commonwealth
at the present time. Since he took
up his first block of 400 acres, Mr.
Ferling has made frequent enlarge-
ments of his estate until now he
is the proprietor of a fine hold-
ing of 4,000 acres of freehold
property, besides which he also holds
large tracts of grazing country on
lease in the same vicinity. The whole
of this is devoted to grazing purposes
and stock-raising, just sufficient
farming to provide for the require-
ments of the proposition being car-
ried on in the paddocks which, in a

quality, may be said to be perhaps

utilized for the fattening of stock.
Good water is found in abundance
on the estate, running creeks being
frequent, and no recourse to artificial

sitated by any shortage of supply.

stock, besides providing suitable
material for fencing and other sta-
tion uses. The fencing is substantial,
and subdivision into many paddocks
has been made, special attention
being given to the direction of the
natural watercourses when this work
was first taken in hand, so that in
every enclosure water is easily ob-
tainable. The present homestead,
which supplemented the original slab
hut of pioneer days, was built over
16 years ago, and is situated on
Sheep-station Creek, in a north-
westerly direction from the town of
Kilcoy. The house is of modern
design, asd in the immediate vicinity
are the up-to-date outhouses which
in every respect are in keeping with
the standing of the place as one of
the model homes of the district. Mr.
Ferling is universally recognized as
one of the most loyal of His
Majesty’s subjects in Queensland,
his fealty to King and country having
remained unshaken since, over 30
years ago, he became a naturalized
Australian, having finally decided
that the country which gave him the
opportunity to succeed should be his
home and, so far as he might deter-
mine, the home of his descendants,
according to the dream of his early
days. He is a staunch adherent of
the Anglican Church, and although
on account of the strenuous nature
of his private undertaking, which
left him little time to give to outside
affairs, his name has never appeared
in connection with prominent public
official work, yet the sacred cause of
charity and all movements for the
betterment of the neighbourhood
have commanded his cordial sympa-
thy and his practical assistance. Mr.
Ferling was married in 1876 to
Mary, daughter of the late Johann
Ollenburg, who was numbered among
the pioneer settlers of Franklyn Vale
Creek, being well known among the
worthy tillers of the soil and pro-
moters of the dairying industry in
those days of stress and hardship.


Of his family of three sons and four
daughters, the sons are associated
with their father in the working of
the property, “Hanover” Park, and
much of the success of the enter-
prise is due to their experienced
co-operation in the various depart-
ments of industry inaugurated by

LITSCHNER BROS., “Litch-
field,” Kilcoy. (Frederick August
Litschner and Carl Ludwig Litsch-

sons of the late August Litschner, a
native of Germany, who came to
Queensland with his wife and family
of three sons and one daughter in
the sailing ship “Eugenie,” landing
at Rockhampton in October, 1873.
Whilst engaged in the duties of his
position as manager of a large agri-
cultural farm in the Fatherland,
which was there considered to be a
fairly good billet, the late gentle-
man, who was a far-seeing citizen,
apt to consider every side of a ques-
tion, reflecting upon his responsibili-
ties as the father of a young family,
came to the conclusion that the
prospects before him were hardly
commensurate with his abilities and
the energy that he felt prepared to
apply to any project offering an ade-
quate reward. The circumstances in
which he found himself seemed to

him sufficient demonstration that if
in his youth he had been able to
make no further headway, it was
hardly likely that advancing years
would bring about any improvement
in his prospects, nor aid him in mak-
ing suitable provision for his child-
ren, or for the inevitable autumn of
life to which he and his wife must
look forward in due course. Casting
round for some gleam of hope to
lighten the dreary horizon which
seemed to close down on him from
every side, his attention was at-
tracted by the success attained by
some of his own countrymen, who,
like himself, dissatisfied with their
surroundings, had sailed to foreign
lands, where, under the aegis of the
British flag, the work of colonization
was proceeding apace, presenting
wonderful opportunities to all who
were prepared to “rough it” for a
few years, with the bright possibility
of spending their declining years in
ease and leaving to their sons and
MR. F. A. LITSCHNER.
daughters a goodly patrimony. Fin-
ally Mr. Litschner made up his mind
to risk the venture and to emigrate
to Australia, which already was be-
coming a name to conjure with.
Choosing the comparatively new
colony of Queensland as his objec-
tive, he sailed from his native coun-
try full of hope, and after a trip
extending over 20 weeks arrived at
the northern port of Rockhampton.
Shortly afterwards the party came
farther south, with the purpose of
getting into closer touch with the
more populated centres, and here the
father of the family sought employ-
ment, which he obtained at Fisher’s
pottery works at Albion—a business
which is still carried on under a dif-
ferent proprietary. Whilst engaged
in this connection he made the most
of every opportunity to learn all
about the conditions and customs of
the new country where he had cast
his lot, and at a later date enlarged
his experience by turning his hand
to road construction work in the
vicinity of the metropolis. In 1878

he decided to return to agrarian
pursuits, and purchased a small pine-
apple farm at Nundah, which he
worked successfully until the time of
his decease, on May 10, 1898. At
the time that the “Kilcoy” Station
area was thrown open for selection
the old pioneer and two of his sons
took up three blocks of land, com-
prising altogether close on 1,000
acres, and whilst the experienced
head directed operations on this new
property the younger members of the
partnership applied themselves to
the practical development of the
land. The late Mr. Litschner con-
tinued to divide his time between
the farm at Nundah and the Kilcoy
holding until, in 1888, an arrange-
ment was made by which the sons
took over the latter property on
their own account and their father
devoted his attention solely to his
pineapple plantation. The late
August Litschner was one of the
quiet, steady, persevering characters
whose success is achieved by close at-
tention to the work in hand, and
who command the respect of those
with whom they establish business or
social relations by their consistency
of aim and solidity of achievement.
At his death he was generously
honoured by many of those kindred
spirits who by virtue of their own
personal endeavour best knew the
worth of his work and the self-sacri-

conclusion. He died in the late
eighties, and only a few years later,

large a tract of freehold country as
any other landholder in the district.
This is principally devoted to

the shape of numerous creeks, while
nutritious grasses abound and timber

forward, honest dealing with all.
They have always taken a live
interest in the advancement of the
district, any movement for the
betterment of the residents or the
conditions of things in general com-
manding their cordial support, and
both brothers are thoroughly loyal
citizens, taking a pride in the land
of their adoption, to which they feel
they owe a debt of gratitude deserv-
ing of their best service and fealty,
and not easily to be repaid. The
brothers are married to daughters
of the late William Traves, a Lin-
colnshire man, who arrived in
Queensland with his wife and family
in 1883, and for some considerable
time was engaged at his trade of
blacksmith in Brisbane and its
suburbs, subsequently becoming the
pioneer of his trade at Kilcoy, open-
ing the first blacksmithing business
there in the year 1895, which is
still carried on by his sons.

being a son of the late Fredrik
Yapsen, of that place. It is inter-
esting to note in passing that in
accordance with the custom of the
country of his birth the gentleman
under review adopted the Christian
name of his father as his own sur-
name, becoming known as ‘‘Fred-
riksen,” rather than “Yapsen,” as
English rules of nomenclature would
decree. The late Fredrik Yapsen
sprang from a line of Danes which
may be traced back to the stirring
times in the history of early Europe
when Denmark played an important
part in directing the destinies of
various nations. Eventually, in more
peaceful times, his progenitors set-
tled down to farming pursuits, and
for several generations past have
been engaged in the tilling of the
fertile soil of the Danish Peninsula;

hemisphere, had been transmitted to
their descendant of modern times,
and, together with others of his race,
he answered the call to a mission of
peaceful empire-building in antipo-
dean latitudes under the Southern
Cross. The traditional instinct
proved strong enough to lead him,
with meagre equipment of education
and while still but a youth in his
teens, to cross the seas to unknown
lands, where a strange tongue was
spoken and unfamiliar customs pre-
vailed. With the enticing song of
romance in his ears, voiced by the
advocates of Australian immigration,
he embarked by the ship "Shake-
speare,” sailing from Hamburg,
whither be had travelled from his
own homeland for that purpose, and
about the middle of the year 1871
first set foot in Australia, Mary-
borough, Queensland, being his port
of disembarkation. From her© he
journeyed to the Mary River, where
he found employment on a farm, but

the new country, he shouldered his
swag and set forth to seek fresh and
more profitable channels for his
young energies. In the course of his
journeyings, coming to "Kilcoy”
Station, he was there immediately
provided with work by the manager,
Mr. Butler, who quickly saw that
he could place confidence in the
young Dane, who had proved his
mettle by his very presence on the
station, and for 18 years Mr. Fred-
riksen carried out his duties as bush
carpenter and general station hand
on "Kilcoy,” with every satisfaction
to his employer. In 1885, by indus-
try and thrift, having secured suffi-
cient capital to start on his own
account, he selected the site of his
present home, first acquiring a block
of 160 acres situated at the old
“Ten-Mile Camp” of the original
"Kilcoy” run. While continuing for
a time his work on the station, he
erected a homestead for himself and
his family on this block, and thence
onward as circumstances permitted,
built up his holding, which he en-
larged when opportunity offered, by
selection and purchase, until his
freehold acres numbered in the
vicinity of 1,400. In addition, he
utilized a considerable area of lease-
hold property in the same neighbour-
hood for grazing purposes, this in-
dustry occupying the principal place
in his operations, although cropping


and dairying and general mixed
farming also comes in for a fair share
of his attention. The country is
mostly hilly, though good flat
patches, excellent for farming pur-
poses, occur near the homestead.
Generous clusters of timber abound,
and the farm is well watered by
running creeks throughout, being
considered a good locality for stock—
a big factor in the undoubted success
of the proposition so ably carried on
by Mr. Fredriksen. The gentleman
under review has always played a
worthy part as far as lay in his
power in the public life of the dis-
trict, the advancement of the Kilcoy
country. Two of the daughters have
married into old pioneering families
in the neighbourhood, and the
youngest resides with her father at
the old homestead.
WILLIAM BRADLEY, J.P.,
general merchant, Kilcoy, was born
at Wellington, near Birmingham,
England, on May 29, 1866, and is
the son of the late Isaac Bradley,
who for a quarter of a century car-
ried on the business of iron and
machinery merchant in that town,
being a descendant of a long line of
forbears engaged in avocations of
grounding in the sound methods
which have since governed his under-
takings and contributed in a large
measure to the success of his com-
mercial operations under the South-
ern Cross. In 1887, moved by the
spirit of adventure and a desire to
acquaint himself by personal experi-
ence with the Greater Britain be-
yond the seas, he decided to join a
cousin who had previously settled in
Queensland. Upon arrival at More-
ton Bay he found employment diffi-
cult to secure, the country being
under a cloud of financial depression
which was contributed to by various
causes, not the least of which was

community being a matter near to
his heart. He is one of the trustees
of the School of Arts, is a member
of the local branch of the Farmers’
Union, for many years has served as
a member of the local Church of
England council, and has also acted
on the School Committee. He mar-
ried, in 1878, Ernestine, daughter of
the late Carl Loweke, a resident of
Caboolture district, and has a sur-
viving family of two sons and three
daughters. The elder son, William,
is engaged in grazing pursuits on his
own account at Monsildale Creek,
while the younger has donned khaki
for the service of his king and
this nature in the same county. Mr.
William Bradley pursued his pri-
mary studies in a private academy,
subsequently continuing his scholastic
education at the Newport Grammar
School, where he remained until 17
years of age. He next took a course
of engineering, which extended over
nearly two years, and although re-
linquishing his studies in this direc-
tion before completing the full
course, the knowledge thus gained
has proved a source of considerable
assistance to him in his subsequent
career. While still in his teens he
joined his father in business, and in
this connection obtained a thorough
the notable flood of that year, which
had laid waste the Logan district,
at that time perhaps the principal
centre of agricultural activity in the
young colony. The commercial acu-
men of the young Britisher, however,
quickly came to his aid, and he lost
but little time in persuading his
cousin to join him in a business
scheme, which included the purchase
of a van and three horses, with a
stock of merchandise, principally
drapery and books, and, together, as
travelling merchants, they traversed
the Logan and Brisbane Valley
areas and the districts of Southern
Queensland making a marked


success of the venture. After a brief
period, by mutual arrangement, the
partnership was dissolved, and Mr.
Bradley continued on his own ac-
count, carrying on the business for
MR. ISAAC BRADLEY.
some five years in the same districts,
where he rapidly succeeded in estab-
lishing a character for strict atten-
tion to the requirements of his cus-
tomers and for reliable business
principles, honesty, and industry.
As his connection enlarged and he
Yvas able to put by a portion of his
profits, he extended the scope of his
enterprise by the founding of an
apiary on a block of land which he
had selected at Redland Bay, where
he made his headquarters. In the
year 1893, having formed a correct
estimate of the favourable opportu-
nities offered for settlement on the
site of the old “Kilcoy” Station, in
the northern portion of the Ipswich
district, Mr. Bradley decided to re-
move to this promising neighbour-
hood, and here he built a dwelling-
house and store, besides moving his
apiary to the new locality. The
present township of Kilcoy was then
but a small settlement, containing
some half-dozen houses, but with no
store worthy of the name, and in
this promising field Mr. Bradley
applied himself to the building up
of a business, in which he received
such prompt and substantial en-
couragement from the residents that
his ultimate success very soon be-
came a foregone conclusion. In this
venture he was aided and abetted by
the late W. Butler, the “father of the
district/’ whose patronage and kind-
ness will ever be remembered by
the man he thus befriended. Mr.
Bradley has never failed to emphasize
the value of the encouragement and
kindly advice proffered by the sea-
soned settler, which meant a great
deal to the young merchant, strugg-
ling to gain a footing, giving him
heart to bear the many disappoint-
ments that attended the early stages
of his proposition, and courage to
persevere until prosperity ultimately
should crown his efforts. Ability and
industry soon met with their reward,
and Mr. Bradley’s connection
steadily increased, necessitating an
MR. WILLIAM BRADLEY.
enlargement of his premises. Accord-
ingly, after first adding to the
original allotment of land which he
had purchased upon coming to Kil-
coy, he gave his attention to the
extension of the store premises,
building commodious shops and
storerooms, and carrying a more
varied stock. As a result of this
policy, to-day the business has
reached such dimensions as to reflect
the greatest possible credit upon its
founder, and served as a good
advertisement for the town, which is
able to support an emporium hardly
second to any business of a similar
nature outside the metropolis. After
Mr. Bradley had been established in
Kilcoy for some little time, his
opportunity arrived to repay some
of the kindness and encouragement
which he had received at the hands
of the settlers at the commencement
of his venture in this neighbourhood.
Months of drought, which played
havoc with the stockholders and
agriculturists’ efforts, were succeeded
by devastating floods, scarcely less
disastrous in the effects produced.
The smaller holdings especially felt
the strain of their position, and
many a worthy settler who saw ruin
staring him in the face was tided
over the time of stress by the oppor-
tune aid afforded by the local store-
keeper, who allowed him on credit
the necessary supplies for himself
and his family until the seasons grew
more propitious and the welcome
harvest once more was gathered in.
In 1896 Mr. Bradley turned his
attention to land investment, select-
ing a small block of land adjoining
the town, which subsequently he
disposed of in order to purchase a
holding of some 1,300 acres sur-
rounding the old “Villeneuve”
homestead, which he leased to vari-
ous dairy farmers on the share
system, continuing this policy for
about a decade. In 1914 he sub-
divided the property into over 20
small farms, and disposed of these
holdings to settlers on terms similar

to those offered by the Government
of the day for undeveloped lands.
In addition to the Villeneuve block,
at one period he held about 4,000
acres of land, in quality equal to


any in the district, but as settlement
became denser he deemed it wise to
part with the whole of this, retain-
ing only the homestead farm which
adjoins Kilcoy, a compact little pro-
perty of between 400 and 500 acres,
on which stands a modern and pretty
villa residence, its site lying within
five minutes’ walk of the town. In
1907, having disposed of his com-
mercial interests, Mr. Bradley went
into partial retirement on this farm,
but some six years later, having a
young family growing up round him,
and wishing to keep them under the
parental roof, he decided to repur-
chase the business, and with the
assistance of his sons has since ad-
vanced its operations very materi-
ally, bringing it up-to-date in every
department and leaving no stone
unturned to ensure its popularity
throughout the length and breadth
of the district. Among the various
properties from time to time
acquired by Mr. Bradley mention
must be made of the “Fernie Lawn”
Estate, situated at Redcliffe, which
he purchased in 1912, reselling the
major portion about three years
later, when he retained a few acres,
which still remain in his possession.

JOHN DONAGHUE, proprietor
of the Exchange Hotel, Kilcoy, is
a son of the late Charles Donaghue,
who, like his progenitors for many
generations, followed farming pur-
suits in County Armagh, Ireland,
and died at the age of 88, leaving
a family of eight sons and one
daughter. The gentleman under
review was born at Portadown, in
Armagh, in November of the year
1861, and received his education at
the local national school. Leav-
ing school at the age of 11,
he became engaged in work on
his father’s farm, where he con-
tinued until 20 years of age,
when with Mr. Thomas Gough,
now of Brisbane, he sailed for
America, first landing at Phila-
delphia, and subsequently proceed-
ing to the State of Pennsylvania,
spent two years in a variety of avoca-
tions, driving teams, and working on
railway construction, until impelled
by love of home and kindred once
more to visit his native land. After
six months in Ireland he decided to
join some relatives in Queensland,
and left Plymouth on June 4, 1884,
by the steamboat “Roma,” which
landed her passengers at the Edward
Street Ferry, Brisbane, on Sunday,
July 28, of that year. Mr. Donaghue
was met by his brothers, Matthew
and Charles, at the Emigration
Depot, and accompanied one of them
to his farm at Goodna, becoming
before long a very valuable assistant
in the many duties of a thriving
dairying proposition. He remained
with his brother for six years,
during which period he became
thoroughly versed in the conditions
of the country in which he had cast
his lot, and learned all there was to
know at the time respecting the
raising of produce for the market
and the breeding of pigs, while his
success in the manufacture of butter
was demonstrated by the winning of
several prizes at the National
Exhibition. Desiring a change of
occupation, he obtained work as an
omnibus driver in Brisbane, and two
years later launched out in this
direction on his own account, with
Toowong as his headquarters. In
1893 he was flooded out, and lost
nearly all his plant, but refusing to
be discouraged, started again, and

ceived hie opportunity to buy a nice
little property, which he proceeded

of 1902 again brought him financial
disaster, and he was forced to borrow
on his properties to buy feed for his
horses; but kept going for a further
two years, when the Brisbane tram-
way system was inaugurated. Selling
out his 40 horses and hie coaches, he
began dealing in cattle round about
Brisbane, and became a well-known
figure at all the sales in the district
for a period extending over about 10
years. He then purchased an hotel
and storekeeping business at Laid-
ley, which after conducting for
about two and a half years he sold
at a profit, and next took over the
Stationi Hotel, at Forest Hill, for
a similar term. After living
for a time at his residence
at Toowong, he filled the role of
licences of the Edinburgh Castle
Hotel, at Kedron, for eight months,
when he sold out to take over the
control of the Regatta Hotel at
Toowong, where he remained for
about a year. He next conducted
the Brighton Hotel for some time,
and subsequently after returning to
private life for a while again took
up hotelkeeping, this time embark-
ing upon his present venture at
Kilcoy. Since the management of
this hostelry was assumed by Mr.
Donaghue the business has increased
by leaps and bounds, and its repu-
tation has spread abroad as one of
the best-kept hotels on the north
coast. As host and hostess Mr. and
Mrs. Donaghue fill most congenial
roles, and display the greatest care
and solicitude for the comfort of
their guests, to whom are assured
the comforts of beautifully fresh,
clean rooms and an abundant and
well-served table. Mrs. Donaghue is
a daughter of Mr. John Gillick, a
well-known farmer of Goodna, of
which district she is a native. The
family consists of two sons, one of

in the office of the Superintendent
of Railways; and five daughters,
among whom considerable musical
talent has manifested itself.


Miscellaneous.
WILLIAM CRIBB, J.P.,
“Langville,” Wynnum South, was
born in London in October of the
year 1837, and is the youngest eon
of the late Robert Cribb, a native
Mathewson & Co., Brisbane.
MR. ROBERT CEIBB.
of Poole, a seaport town of Dorset-
shire, England. Robert Cribb’s
father was captain and part-owner
of a trading vessel, and was pressed
into the Imperial service during a
war of that period. In consequence
of this his family suffered many
privations, and Robert began his
career as apprentice to a baker, at a
later period establishing himself in
business on his own account in
London, where he continued for 21
years. About the year 1840 Dr.
Lang, who has been designated “a
champion of liberty,” returned to
England from Australia for the
purpose of inducing persons of sound
moral and religious principles to
settle in “Cooksland,” as Queens-
land was then called, the present
name coming into use as soon as the
immense territory became a free
colony in 1847. Accordingly, in
1848 Mr. Robert Cribb with his
family and other relatives left
England by the ship “Fortitude,”
and landed at Brisbane in the fol-
lowing year, this boat, together with
two others, the “Chasely” and Ihe
“Lima,” having been chartered by
Dr. Lang to carry out his emigra-
tion scheme. Mr. Cribb’s brother,
the late Benjamin Cribb, formerly
senior partner of the firm of Cribb
and Foote, Ipswich, arrived in the
colony by Dr. Lang’s second ship,
the “Chasely,” about six months
after the “Fortitude” had completed
her trip. The late Robert Cribb
started a bakery business in Queen
Street, Brisbane, and very quickly
worked up a sound connection,
becoming the Government contractor
for the Immigration Depot, gaols,
and hospitals, Which contract he
retained for many years. He also
worked strenuously in the public
interest, and in course of time his
activity in the political world
brought him into Parliament, where
he became the last member to repre-
sent Queensland in the councils of
the Mother State, before separation
blossomed as an accomplished fact
in 1859, largely as the fruit of his
vigilant efforts to secure the freedom
of his adopted territory. Mr.
Robert Cribb was deeply interested
in the anti-convict question, and in
one of the public meetings which
he held to convince the people of the
wisdom of his views he showed a
relic in the shape of a pair of leg-
irons, with the leg bones of some
perished prisoner inside, which he
had dug up in his garden in Queen
Street. The late Robert Cribb was
widely mourned at the time of his
death, which occurred in 1893, at
the ripe old age of 88 years. Mr.
William Cribb, the subject of this
article, was brought up at Wareham,
Dorset, in the south of England, and
came to Australia with his father
and other members of the family by
the ship “Fortitude,” arriving in
January, 1849. After completing
his education he assisted in his
father’s business until 1862, when
he secured a position in the firm of
Messrs. Cribb & Foote, of Ipswich,
and gradually rose to be manager
of the ironmongery department.
Relinquishing this connection lit
turned his attention to farming
pursuits, leasing a property near
Brisbane, to which he gave the
name of “Lang” Farm, but shortly
before the expiration of his 10 years’
lease he once more became associated
with the firm of Messrs. Cribb and
Foote in the capacity of manager of
their branch business at Church-
bank. This post he retained until
1873, when he severed his connection
with the business to take up life on
the land again, and selected 1,500
acres at Redcliffe, which he worked
until his father’s death in 1893.
The winding up of the estate of his
deceased parent in conjunction with
his co-executdr, occupied four years,
at the end of which period Mr.
Cribb’s health gave way, and upon
the recommendation of his medical
adviser he took up his residence at
“Langsville,” Wynnum South, and
has since lived in retirement in this
pleasant locality. Mr. Cribb is a
man of strong religious principle,
and has aided considerably in the
building up of church and philan-
thropic institutions in the land of
his adoption. Whilst at ‘‘Lang”
Farm he became connected with
the Congregational Sunday school at
Milton, and later opened one at the
farm, which he successfully superin-
tended and carried on until it was
merged in a similar institution at
Indooroopilly. Whilst at Church-
bank he took a leading part in
establishing Congregational services
in the district, the woolshed in
connection with Cribb & Foote’s
premises being used as a place of
worship. But the chief -monument

direction of the building up of a
sane and vigorous Christianity in the
young State is found in the hand-
some pile of buildings known as
“The Y.M.C.A.,” in Edward Street,


Brisbane, the erection of which was
made possible by the generous dona-
tion to that institution in 1905 by
Mr. Cribb of the property at the
corner of George and Elizabeth
Streets, valued at considerably over
£25,000. This was sold, and the
more central and convenient site in
Edward Street purchased, and two
years later the foundation stone of
the present structure was laid by
Lord Chelmsford, then Governor of
Queensland, upon which occasion a
congratulatory message was received
from King Edward VII. A letter
from President Roosevelt, and a
donation from the Governor-General
of Australia were also features of
the ceremony. Mrs. Cribb was pre-
sented by His Excellency on behalf
of the association with a handsome
brooch as a memento of the day, this
being designed from the front eleva-
tion view of the new building. The
pillars of the brooch are of granite
taken from the corner stone, and the
windows are represented by means of
Queensland gems, the completed gift
being unique in every particular.
Many interesting speeches were
made on the different features of
Y.M.C.A. work, and most of these
contained their tribute of praise to
the generous donor of the gift which
had facilitated the operations of the
promoters in the young country of
Queensland. Mrs. Cribb, who was
united heart and soul with her
husband in this scheme of benevo-
lence, was a daughter of the late
George Carr, of Cheshire, England.
She died in March, 1915, after a
prolonged illness, and Mr. Cribb
subsequently espoused Mrs. Mary
Julia Plunkett, formerly of Ireland.
JAMES LAMOND, retired first-
class Inspector of the Queensland
Police Force, is a descendant of one
of the oldest clans of Scotland, in
connection with which absolute his-
torical evidence dating back to 1200
A.D. exists, and the genealogy of
Ins family can be proved by charters
down to that remote period concern-
ing which most Highland families
are obliged to have recourse to the
uncertain testimony of tradition and
to that contained in the ballads and
legends of their ancient seannachies.
He was born at Wateresk, Forfar-
shire, at the foot of the Grampians,
in 1849, and in 1865 arrived in
Queensland with his parents by the
sailing vessel “Royal Dane.” His
father, the late William Ogilvy
Lamond, was engaged in the pas-
toral industry in Scotland during
the earlier part of the nineteenth
century, and upon his advent to this
country took over the management

of “Panet Downs” Station, located
in the Leichhardt district. His
eldest brother, Henry William, was
drowned whilst crossing bulls over
the Fitzroy River during the flood of
1870. The late Mr. W. O. Lamond at
the time of his death was 73 years of
age. A strenuous worker, and a man
of initiative and enterprise, he made
a useful colonist, and earned the
respect and esteem of a wide circle
of acquaintances. The gentleman
under review received his education
at Kirriemuir, Scotland, and com-
ing to Australia with his parents
and eldest brother soon found scope
for his energies in pastoral occupa-
tions in the west and far north of
Queensland. For some 15 years he
remained in this remote region, meet-
ing with a variety of experiences
whilst engaged in the droving of
stock or in exploration work in the
unopened-up territory at the “back
of beyond.” In 1879 lie joined the

especially among the aboriginal
population, were most rife. It is
worthy of note in this connection
that the residents of the backblocks
which formed the scene of his lab-
ours as a police officer still vividly
remember the order, civilization,
and immunity from violence they
enjoyed under Inspector Lamond’s
wise control, and as a result of his
untiring vigilance in the discharge
of his duty. He was particularly
successful in his management of
black trackers, and his influence
over the aborigines in their wild
state was most marked, his efforts
to civilize them being crowned with
a gratifying measure of success;
while at the same time he earned
the gratitude of the pioneer Euro-
peans, whose property so frequently
fared badly at the hands of the
savage tribes whose country had
been invaded by the white man.
More than once Mr. Lamond was
known to risk his life at the call
of duty, and his position as a
police officer among the wild and
hostile tribes in the far north of
Queensland was one of continual
jeopardy, as is evidenced by the fact
that no fewer than three sub-in-
spectors—Dy as, Kaye, and Beres-
ford—were killed by the blacks in
the region of the Gulf of Carpen-
taria while he was stationed there
in the early eighties. He played a
prominent part in defending the sta-
tion-holders and their men in the
great strike of 1894, which proved
to be a turning-point in the indus-
trial history of the State. During
his 30 years’ service he patrolled the
greater part of Queensland, and
upon his retirement was presented

in honour of Lord Lamington, His
Excellency spoke of Inspector La-
mond as follows:—“He wished now
to say, in the first place, that he
greatly regretted the absence from
his side that day of the gentleman
taken ill at Normanton, and was
thus unable to accompany him to
Croydon. He had now to say that
the manner in which Inspector
Lamond had arranged the details of
his journey reflected greatly to his
credit, and proved most admirably
his power of organization. That he
should be able to travel without a
hitch, or without any untoward de-
lay, over a distance of 500 or 600
miles, was something of which to
feel proud. He took this oppor-
tunity of acknowledging through the
Press his indebtedness to his friend,
Mr. Inspector Lamond.” —(Vide
The Croydon Mining News, October
26, 1900.) Mr. Lamond has proved
himself the possessor of true patriotic
spirit, immediately after the outbreak
of the great world war in August,
1914, offering his services, through
the Police Department, in any
capacity in the Defence Department.
This offer he repeated some time
later, when the formation of an “Old
Brigade” was mooted by the Brisbane
Courier, which had published his
earlier letter to the Police Depart-
ment under the heading “A Vet-
eran’s Offer.” In 1883 Mr. Lamond
married Amy, second daughter of
Francis Henry Shadforth, of “Lily-
dale,” Gregory River, and grand-
niece of the late Sir Alfred Stephen,
P.C., Chief Justice and Lieutenant-
Governor of New South Wales. This
lady died in 1898, leaving two sons,

DIXON COOKE, “Pendafield,”
Kin Kin, via Cooran, was born in
the year 1863, at Broughton Yale,
New South Wales, being the third
son of Mr. William Cooke, a pioneer

1852. The subject of this memoir

lad of 17 years, began work on his
father’s farm, where he obtained a
thorough acquaintance with all the
details of the agricultural industry
and other matters connected with
the development of land in the
Mother State. At 24 he struck out
for himself, purchasing a farm on
the Richmond River, about 100 acres
in extent, which some time later he
sold for the purpose of acquiring a
larger property at Wollingbar, and
here he worked with so much indus-
try and enterprise that some 15 years
later he found himself in a position
to purchase another more valuable
estate at Alstonville. Mr. Cooke
continued to make dairying the
chief department of his enterprise
with excellent results, combining
the other branches of mixed farming
in such a manner as to command an
all-round success. He always
adopted up-to-date methods, deem-
ing that each generation should
show an advance in every direction,
and has reaped the advantage of this
progressive spirit by overtaking some
who started before him, but had
lacked the initiative to inaugurate
their proposition on modern lines.
After spending a number of years on
the Richmond River he conceived
the idea that he could give some of
his sons a better opening in life by
settling them on the land in Queens-
land, and in 1913 he purchased
another choice virgin holding of the
rich scrub land in the Kin Kin dis-
trict approached by way of Cooran.
This consisted of 238 acres, and with
a fine water supply provided by per-
manently running creeks, held out
the prospect of becoming, with the
proper development an ideal dairy
farm. Substantial fences were
erected enclosing the property and
suitable paddocks were formed for
pasturage and cultivation purposes,
and discovering that the conditions
of the district were peculiarly
favourable to the growth of paspa-
lum, Mr. Cooke placed the major
portion of the area under tillage
and sowed it with the above-men-
tioned fodder plant, which has
flourished even beyond his expecta-
tions. Among other improvements
he introduced one of the finest
dairying plants to be found on any
property north of Brisbane, which
was installed in an up-to-date build-
ing, with concrete floor, the milking
machines and separator being driven
by an oil engine, and in virtue of
this and the general arrangements
made by Mr. Cooke for the carrying
on of his industry the estate
achieved the reputation of being the
model dairy farm of the district.
Mr. Cooke was married in 1888 to
to Fannie, daughter of the late
William Alexander, of Eltham, and
has two daughters and seven sons.
Of the latter no less than four

Empire, and proceeded to the front,

Girls, Oxley (Principals, Miss Janet
O’Connor and Miss C. M. O’Con-

institution was established about 40
years ago by the late Mrs. O’Con-
nor, an Englishwoman of consider-
able culture and force of character,
who came originally from Truro, in
Cornwall, where she was born in
the year 1827. Mrs. O’Connor re-
ceived her education at a college in
Bath, where she enjoyed the advan-
tage of a sound scholastic equipment,
and at 24 years of age she married

Captain O’Connor, who was at one
time stationed at St. Helena, ren-

“Address” written in connection
with the unveiling of the statue
erected in the vicinity of Parliament

of the ill-fated explorers, Burke and
Wills. In 1875 she was offered the
post of lady principal to the Girls’
Grammar School, Brisbane, and
accepted this responsible appoint-
ment with a keen appreciation of
the opportunities it afforded for the
realization of many ideals held by
her in respect to the higher develop-
ment of women. Two years later
Mrs. O’Connor opened a high school
for girls on her own account, and
in this useful institution were
trained many girls who have since
wielded considerable influence as

need for a superior boarding-school
in Queensland, and being fully
aware of the special advantage of
having her students for the time

made choice of a suitable site at
Oxley, where the more bracing cli-
mate offered inducements for the
establishment of an institution of
this nature; and, erecting premises,
opened the present “Duporth”
School, which she conducted with
very satisfactory results until the
time of her death in 1895. Since
that date the management of the
school has been continued by her
daughters, the present principals,

way to keep up the traditions of
the founder. “Duporth” School is

MILES BEEVOR DAVENEY,
J.P., Warwick, was born in 1868,
and is the youngest son of the late
Captain Charles Beevor Daveney,
formerly of the 21st Royal Scots and
82nd Regiments, who originally came
from Colton, Norfolk, England, ar-
riving at Sydney, New South Wales,
by the ship “Windsor” in 1854.
Shortly after arrival he proceeded to
“Canning Downs” Station, near
\V arwick, in which he had acquired


an interest from Mr. Gilbert David-
son, who had purchased the station
from the original owners, Messrs.
George and Patrick Leslie. Upon
the sale of “Canning Downs” in
1866 his next venture was the pur-
chase of “Palm Tree Creek” Sta-
tion, on the Dawson River, but
meeting a succession of adverse sea-
sons he relinquished pastoral pur-
suits and in 1869 returned to War-
wick, where he established himself
in commercial circles as a land and
estate agent. His death occurred
in 1904. During his lifetime in
and about Warwick he made his
influence felt in the public life of
the town, and after serving as an
alderman several times in the War-
wick Town Council received the
honour of election to the mayoralty,
which office he filled with distinction.
Having in earlier life served in
India, Captain Daveney possessed a
store of interesting reminiscences,
among which were included tales of
the notorious Nana Sahib, the bead
and front of the Indian Mutiny, who
was a frequent guest at regimental
dinners at the Cawnpore barracks.
Mr. M. B. Daveney received his
education at the Toowoomba Gram-
mar School, leaving this institution
to join the engineering branch of

the profession, gaining his diploma
as a railway surveyor, and in 1902

construction branch. On the death of
his father Mr. Daveney returned
to Warwick to take over the business

ever since. Mr. Daveney is a keen
sportsman, a medallist in rifle shoot-
ing, and a first-class pigeon shot. In
1912 the Warwick School of Arts
made him president of its committee,
and a similar honour was conferred
upon him by the Warwick Club. He
married, in 1912, Winifred Mary,
daughter of Mr. James Moors, or
“Welling,” Mosman, N.S.W., mak-
ing a trip to England and Scotland
before finally settling down again in
his business.
The late JOHN MELVILLE,
the last survivor of the Gregory
exploration party of 1854, was born
at Boreham Wood, Hertfordshire,
England, on September 16, 1834,
and as a lad of 14 came to Queens-
land with his parents under the
auspices of Dr. John Dunmore Lang,
at a period when the State was
merely a portion of New South
Wales, with a small community hav-
ing as nucleus the Moreton Bay
Settlement on the banks of the
Brisbane Kiver. Arriving by the
ship “Fortitude” in January, 1849,
some two years later, when the gold
diggings broke out in Victoria, Mr.
Melville joined the rush to Bendigo,
where he remained for about three
years, returning to Brisbane in 1854.
About this time he met the late Mr
(afterwards Sir) A. C. Gregory, and
was induced to join the party being
formed by that gentleman for the
purpose of exploring the Victoria
and Albert Rivers in the far north.
The party comprised 18 members —
viz., Mr. A. C. Gregory and his
brother (H. C. Gregory), Dr. J. R.
Elsey, Baron Ferdinand von Muel-
ler, and Messrs. J. S. Wilson, J.
Baines, J. Melville, Charles Dean,
Robert Bowman, S. Macdonald,
William Dawson, W. Selby, William
Shewed, C. Humphries, G. Phibbs,
J. Flood, H. Richards, and John
Fahey. A departure was made from
Brisbane on August 12, 1855, in
two vessels, the “Monarch” and
“Tom Tough,” the subsequent ex-
periences of the explorers, as related
by Mr. Melville, being of an
extremely varied and interesting
character. After returning from
this trip he became engaged in sur-
vey work until 1871, in which year
he was employed by Mr. George
Phillips, a surveyor, to survey the
site of the present cemetery at
Toowong, and in 1873 received the
appointment of overseer by the
Mathewson & Co., Brisbane.

trustees of the cemetery, a position
he held for 38 years. Mr. Melville
died in 1912 at the age of 77 years,
being survived by a widow, three
daughters, and two sons. His eldest


son, John Lindsay Melville, is a
native of Brisbane, where he was
born in 1878, and received his educa-
tion at the Normal School in this
city. Leaving school at 15 years of
age, he was employed as accountant
in the firm of Messrs. Hardy Bros.,
of Brisbane, eventually for health
reasons resigning to take up farming
at Brookfield, where he remained for
three years, at the close of that
period disposing of his interests and
becoming associated with his father
in his work as overseer of the Too-
wong Cemetery, to which position he
succeeded after his parent’s decease.
Mr. Melville married in 1902 Lily,
daughter of Mr. W. P. Baldry, of
Sydney, and has two sons.
JOHN ANDREW DUNLOP,
“Monkton,” Corinda, is a native of
Lancashire, England, where, at the
time of his birth, 1844, his father,
the late David Dunlop, a well-known
schoolmaster of his day, was engaged
in the teaching profession. Shortly
afterwards the late gentleman re-
ceived the appointment of head-
master of the Newbattle School,
Edinburgh, which position he held
for 33 years, and here young Dunlop
received his scholastic training,
under the superintendence of his
parent. Leaving school at 11 years
of age, he went to reside with his

paces” in the routine of farm work.
At a later period he served three and
a half years in a paper mill, and
eventually, at 19, he decided to seek
his fortune in the newly-established

distant continent of Australia,

and obtained his first employment on
a farm at Oxley, where he remained
for about four years. He next
struck out for himself, and in 1867
purchased a block of about 20 acres
of land in the last-named district,
upon which he began the cultivation
of cotton, maize, and potatoes.
Some time later he proceeded to
Nobby, on the Darling Downs, and
acquired a farm of some 230 acres in
that district, which he worked until
1881, Disposing of his interests in
the west, he then returned to Oxley
and established his present home-
stead in the locality, which has since
become known as Corinda, where a
pretty suburban township has sprung
up, the popularity of the place being
enhanced lay easy railway communi-
cation with the city of Brisbane,
from which it lies distant some seven
miles. Since his first arrival at
Oxley, Mr. Dunlop has witnessed
many ups and downs in the progress
of the district, one very serious
period of depression in the middle
sixties being relieved by the discov-
ery of tin at Stanthorpe, while
another precarious situation in the
history of the farming industry was
successfully tided over by the
general stimulus given to the com-
munity upon the news of the great
gold find in the Gympie district,
which provided employment for
numbers of men of all manner of
callings from every part of the
State and proved the salvation of
many of the struggling farmers, who
stood on the brink of ruin by reason
of the prevailing drought. Mr. Dun-
lop recalls the time when tents lined
the track —for there were no roads —
between Brisbane and Ipswich, and
when hotel accommodation, even of
the roughest sort, was non-
existent, and relates as an
incident of interest that
once while digging in his
garden on its present site
he came upon an old flint-
lock pistol, which he recog-
nized at once as a relic of
the old convict days. Mr.
Dunlop married, in 1863,
Mary Anne, daughter of the
late Samuel Dudley, a native
of England, and has three
sons and five daughters.
Two of his sons responded
to the call of the Empire
to fight for the national
ideals, and saw active ser-
vice. Two of Mr. Dunlop’s
grandsons also took part in
the fighting. In 1913 Mr.
and Mrs. Dunlop celebrated
the fiftieth aniversary of
their wedding day, and an interesting
memento of this occasion exists in
the shape of a large group photo-
graph of themselves and their de-
scendants, numbering exactly 50.


FRANK PETER BELZ,
Seventeen-mile Rock, near Oxley,
is the eldest son of the late Peter
Belz, a pioneer farmer of this dis-
trict, whose death occurred in the
year 1906, and of his wife, who still
(1916) survives—an active and intel-
ligent lady, 77 years of age, who
resides with her* son, and is a
capable raconteur of many interest-
ing experiences in the early days of
Queensland. Mrs. Belz, sen., re-
members distinctly the days when
the grass grew green in Queen
Street, Brisbane, and keenly realizes
the big comparison that may
be made between the comfort
and prosperity enjoyed by the rising
generation and the rough conditions
which existed in the long-ago days
of her early married life. Mr. Frank
Peter Belz, was educated at the
MR. FRANK PETER BELZ.
public school at Seventeen-mile
Rock, and at the termination of his
studies, in his fourteenth year, was
employed for some considerable time
on the farm owned by his father in
that locality. Upon his coming of age
the property was made over to him by
his father, and he has since worked
this property on his own account.
Out of an area of about 100 acres
comprised in the holding, some 30
acres of the rich soil of the river
flats are cultivated, and some fine
crops are grown. Formerly a larger
area was devoted to purposes of
tillage, blit so much damage was
wrought by the disastrous floods of
1893 that since that period the more
cautious policy has been adopted of
cultivating only the ground on a
higher level above the high-water
flood mark. The remainder of the
land is utilized for the grazing of
dairy cattle, considerable attention
being given to this industry by the
gentleman under review. The site of
Mr. Belz’s homestead is one of the
most elevated positions in the dis-
trict, and was selected by his late
father for the erection of an abode to
shelter his wife and family. From
this hill is commanded an extensive
view, embracing much of the country
taken up by settlers for agricultural
purposes. Mr. Belz is an excellent
judge of horses, being himself a
breeder of a superior class of draught,
and he has secured many blue ribbons
at the various agricultural shows held
at Brisbane, Rosewood, Strathpine,
Ipswich, etc., principally awarded to
the well-known draught hmse, “Glad-
field,” by “Major” out of “Gipsy.”
“Major” was bred by the famous
New Zealand Stud Company, and
was purchased by Mr. Weinholt as
a two-year-old at the high figure of
250 guineas. Among the horses

agricultural settlement established in
the Aloreton Bay district in the early
days of the history of Queensland.
He is the second son of the late
Peter Belz, a native of Wurtemberg,
Germany, who came to Australia in
1864, and after following agricul-
tural occupations in various places
undulating ridges, appealed to the
pioneer farmers as forming an ideal
region for their operations, the
proximity of the district to Brisbane,
with the rapidly-expanding markets
of a rising metropolitan area being
another big attraction. Before the
advent of railway communication the
10 miles by road which intervened
between this point of the river and
the port of Brisbane presented no
insuperable difficulty to the early
settler desiring to convey his pro-
duce to market overland, and the
boats plying up and down between
Ipswich and the capital also made
transit of goods a comparatively easy
matter. The late Mr. Belz died in
1906. Mr. Benedict Belz attended
the local public school, and at 12
years of age took up duties on the
parental farm, where he continued
until he attained his majority. The
property which he now holds was
then transferred to him by his father,
its area consisting of about 67 acres
of first-class soil, and although in the
period which has elapsed since he
first entered upon the ownership of
this valuable block various adjoining
properties have been purchased and
afterwards disposed of by him, he
has always kept his original patri-
mony intact. In the earlier days of
his occupation of the property he
devoted his attention almost entirely
to dairying operations, but has since
abandoned this industry in favour
his produce. As a young man he
attained widespread reputation as an
expert horseman, and puts his gifts

MARK BLASDALL, Long Poc-
ket, Indooroopilly, was born at
Carrington, Notts, England, on
December 1, 1841, and is the eldest
son of the late William Blasdall,
who followed the occupation of a
lacemaker in that county. The late
Mr. Blasdall came with his family
to Australia by the sailing ship
“City of Brisbane,” arriving at
Moreton Bay in the year 1861. He
was first employed by the Hon.
Louis Hope, pioneer of the Queens-
land sugar industry, on his planta-
tion at Ormiston Point, but before
12 months had elapsed he took up
on lease for farming purposes a
block of virgin country on the banks
of the Brisbane River, in the
locality now known as Indooroopilly
Pocket. Clearing about 18 acres of

the dense scrub which covered the
country in that district, he pre-
pared the soil for cultivation, and
was successful in producing a variety
of farm produce, which he conveyed
to the Brisbane market by means of
a river boat. The late Mr. Blasdall
died in 1876, at the age of 65 years.
Mr. Mark Blasdall received his
primary education at the village
school at Carrington, afterwards
attending the High Pavement school,
Notts, and night classes at the
People’s College, Notts. He was
apprenticed to the lacemaking trade,
which he followed until the great
strike of 1859 determined the Blas-
dall family to emigrate to Queens-
land. After arrival he was employed
by Dr. Kemball, the emigration
agent, in pick and barrow work,

gave satisfaction, and subsequently
Dr. Kemball’s laconic “Recom-

here for a time he fell sick, and

RODERICK McLEOD, Stanley
Terrace, Taringa, was born in
the year 1839, his native place
being Gairloch, Ross-shire, Scot-
land, where his father was known
as one of the Scottish Highland
crofters. At the close of his educa-
tion the gentleman under review
first found employment as time-
keeper for a contractor engaged in
road repairing in his native place.
Upon attaining manhood he decided
to emigrate, and sailed for Queens-
land by the ship “Persia,” of Lon-
don, in November, 1861, landing at
Port Curtis, where his services were
immediately engaged by Mr. John
Forsyth for station work on the
“Langmorn” property, at the rate
of £4O a year and keep. This

Scotchman became familiar with the

From here he proceeded to the Peak

Downs mining field, and after try-
ing his fortune on the diggings in
1865 he took a position on “Lynd-
hurst” Station, in the vicinity of
The Lynn, near Rockingham Bay.
A few months later he became con-
cerned in a droving contract, and
overlanded a mob of 800 cattle and
horses to take up country on the
Flinders River, which later on be-
came known as “Smith’s” Station.
After spending about four months
in establishing this run, Mr.
McLeod went to what is now known
as Burketown, where he was em-
ployed in the building of stockyards
and other bush work. While in the
northern areas of the State he was
employed by Mr. William Lands-
borough, then Deputy-Governor of
Northern Queensland, to erect a
residence on Sweer’s Island, situ-
ated a short distance off the main-
land, near Burketown, which be-
came an historic structure from the
fact that it was the first building
to be erected on the island. Mr.
McLeod next visited Cape York,
after a short stay proceeding to
Bowen and Flat-top Island, at Port
Mackay, from which place he set
out for Rockhampton, where he took
charge of a bullock team for the
conveyance of stores to Peak Downs
diggings. Later he was placed in
charge of a large number of kanakas
on the “Banksia Plains” Station,
where he remained until 1870,
when, upon the advice of a relative,
he took up a selection of 160 acres
at Moggill, near Brisbane, where he
settled down to cotton growing on
his own account, being one of the
first cotton producers of the district.
Subsequently, when the price of cot-
ton rendered its production unprofit-
able, he relinquished this industry
in favour of dairying, which occu-
pation he followed until 1885, when
he disposed of his holding and went
for a trip to Auckland, New Zea-
land, with the intention of settling
in the Dominion. Preferring Queens-
land, eventually he returned, finally
retiring to Taringa, where he now
resides. Mr. McLeod has had many
and varied experiences during his
half-century of life in Australia,
and his adventures with the blacks
in earlier days were of a sufficiently
exciting nature, marks on his skull,
caused by a “nulla nulla” being
thrown at him, still being visible.
Mr. McLeod visited Scotland in 1908
and again in 1912. He was mar-
ried in February, 1867, to a daugh-
ter of the late John Mclvor, of
Gairloch, Ross-shire, Scotland, and
of this union there was one son,
since deceased. Mrs. McLeod lived
to the ripe age of 75 years, her
death taking place in 1908.

interested himself in the advance-
ment of the district, and served as
a member of the Indooroopilly Divi-
sional Board, also promoting the cause
of religion by staunch adherence
to the Anglican Church. The late
Thomas Sugars died in 1915, at
the age ol 81 years. The gentleman
under review, Mr. Thomas George
Sugars, attended a public school at
Moggill until his 13th year, when
his services were required on the
home farm, where he worked in a
general capacity, gaining useful ex-
perience in the various departments
of the industry. At 16 he was
apprenticed to the blacksmithing
trade at Toowong, and seven years
later struck out for himself, pur-
chasing a farming area of 20 acres
at Moggill, which he has since in-
creased from time to time, until he
now owns a snug little property of
500 acres. Here he cultivated the
soil with good results, raising maize,
potatoes, pumpkins, lucerne, etc.,
but was a heavy sufferer by the
disastrous flood of 1893, which did
an immense amount of damage to
his cultivated paddocks. As a re-
sult of this experience he decided
to abandon agriculture in favour of
dairying, which promised a satis-
factory solution of the problem of
how best to utilize an area of land
subject to inundations when abnor-
mal rains set in. As time went on
Mr. Sugars found that the pastures
stocked with cattle more readily
withstood the onrush of flood
waters, and consequently of recent
years he has devoted his attention
almost entirely to dairying. He laid
the foundation of his dairy herd by
the selection of a number of highly-
bred Jerseys from imported stock,
and his enterprise in this direction
has met with the best results.
Apart from his business interests,
Mr. Sugars takes an active interest*
in the various organizations of the
district in which he resides, and for
the past 18 years has served as a
member of the Indooroopilly Shire
Council. For almost as lengthy a
period he has been associated with
the local school committee, attend-
ing its periodical meetings with un-
failing regularity, and on several
occasions has occupied the office of
chairman. Mr. Sugars married in
1884 Harriet, daughter of the late
William Wood, ropemaker, Bris-
bane, who was one of the earliest
settlers in Maryborough, where he
arrived in the year 1874. The last-
named gentleman died in 1908, in
the 69th year of his age. Of the
marriage there are two sons and
two daughters, of whom the eldest
son, William George, was born at
Moggill in 1887, where he also re-
ceived his education. In October,
1915, he joined the Australian Im-
perial Forces, being attached to the
Light Horse Regiment, now on
active service in Egypt. The second

“WESTWOOD” ESTATE, BROOKFIELD, NEAR BRISBANE.
Thomas Moon received his early
education at the Dene Hill school,
Sussex, and at the age of 12 years
took up farm duties on his father’s
land. In his seventeenth year he
was apprenticed to the carpentering
trade, and after completing his in-
dentures and thoroughly mastering
his trade, at a time when the only
sure road to success was by industry
and ability, he decided to emigrate
from the Old Country and seek his
fortunes in other climes. Accord-
ingly in 1869 he arrived at Moreton
Bay by the sailing vessel "Light
Brigade,” after a lengthy voyage
extending over 121 days. He was
successful in obtaining employment
in Brisbane, and enjoyed the dis-
tinction of being the builder of one
of -the earliest houses in Sandgate,
as far back as 45 years ago. In
recalling these times, Mr. Moon
states that the wages paid to a
skilled workman averaged five shil-
lings per day. In 1876 he purchased
a banana plantation on the banks
of the Brisbane River at Bulimba,
and subsequently, in 1882, coming
to Brookfield, he settled down on
the present "Westwood” holding,
where he has continued ever since.
This holding consisted of 117 acres
of undulating scrub country, totally
unimproved, not even a stump hav-
ing been removed by way of clearing
work. Mr. Moon, however, un-
daunted, prepared the land for use
and launched out in the dairying
industry, in which he introduced
some innovations, being the first
settler in that district to receive full
use from his stock by milking his
cows twice daily. From an early
date he realized the necessity for
keeping the dairy herd supplied with
proper fodder, making provision
for this purpose by the cultiva-
tion of suitable crops, and ho recalls,
with justifiable pride, that even be-
fore the advent of the separator, he
frequently produced as much as 120

lb. of butter per week. He has
always been an active worker in the
various movements having as their
object the betterment of the district,
and was elected a member of the
local divisional board in 1888, after-
wards serving a term as chairman.
At a later date he occupied a seat
on the Taringa Divisional Board. He
has been connected with the Brook-
field School Committee for many
years, and has acted as chairman of
the Cemetery Trust for 25 years.
He was created a Justice of the
Peace by the Griffith Administra-
tion, and still holds that office. Mr.
Moon married in 1866, before leav-
ing England, Susan Margaret,
daughter of the late John Jones, of
Wales, and has three sons and one
daughter. His sons—Thomas Lewry
Moon and Alfred James Moon—are
settled respectively on two farms in
the Lockyer district, purchased by
their father and by him made over
to them; while he settled upon his
only daughter a dwelling-house at
Sandgate. The original farm and
homestead at Brookfield he made
over to his third son, Mr. William
Richer Moon, who is now working
the property on very successful lines.
WILLIAM RICHER MOON was
born at Bulimba, and came with his
parents to Brookfield when four
years of age. He attended the


Brookfield public school until his
fourteenth year, after which he
assisted his father on the home
farm, to which he has now suc-
ceeded. In 1906 Mr. Moon leased
his property and became identified
with the International Harvester
Company of America, chiefly in the
capacity of commercial traveller, his
purpose in so doing being to provide
himself with a business training.
During the four years that he con-
tinued in this connection he proved
himself very successful on behalf cf
his firm, and upon relinquishing
this employ started on his own ac-
count as a land, stock, and estate
agent, which business he has carried
on in conjunction with his farming
interests ever since. Mr. Moon has
always taken a keen interest in
politics and in other matters of
public concern, the question of co-
operation especially commanding his
earnest advocacy, and the cause of
the primary producer being always
near to his heart. He was made a
Justice of the Peace in 1904. He
has given considerable attention to
military affairs, and attained the
rank of lieutenant in the old volun-
teer forces of Queensland in 1890.
He married in 1907 Florence Emily,
daughter of the late John Melville,
the last surviving member of the
Gregory Exploration Expedition,
and has two daughters.
GEORGE PHILIP READING,
J.P., Brookfield, Moggill Creek,
was born in Brisbane on November
10, 1871, and is the second son of
the late George Reading, a builder
and contractor, who came to Austra-
lia by the sailing ship “Alfred” in
1858. Upon arrival in the Queens-
land metropolis, then little more
than an infant settlement, the late
gentleman established himself in
business and continued to reside in
Brisbane until the time of his death,
which occurred in the year 1875.
The late Mr. Reading was a director
of the Brisbane Permanent Building
Company, and always manifested an
active interest in the public life of
the community, holding office as
alderman of the Brisbane City
Council and taking a prominent part
in the Loyal Orange Lodge, besides
being an ardent churchman of the
Anglican communion. Mr. George
Philip Reading received his early
education at the primary school,
Brisbane, later attending the Bris-
bane Boys’ Grammar School. Leav-

and finally taking
his diploma of

ing to Queensland,
he opened offices
in Queen Street,
Brisbane, and here
continued the prac-
tice of his profes-
sion for some con-
siderable time. The
failure of his health,
however, eventually
compelled him to
seek some employ-
ment which should
enable him to en-
joy the benefit of
life in the open
air, and for this
purpose he pur-
chased a farming
property at Moggill Creek, where he
has since devoted himself to agri-
cultural pursuits, also turning his
attention to the establishment of a
small herd of high-class Jersey
cattle. Mr. Reading is a man of
public spirit, and whilst resident in
Brisbane assisted in the formation of
the Metropolitan Fish Board. He
acted as secretary to the local Insti-
tute of Architects, of which he is a
Fellow, and for two years filled the
post of secretary to the Queensland
Kennel Club. He was also a mem-
ber of the Indooroopilly Shire Coun-
cil, and retained the seat for seven
years, while for nine years he has
served as a member of the Ithaca

he occupied the mayoral office for a
term. He was one of the founders
of the Brookfield, Pullen Vale, and

native place. He left school at the
early age of 13 to become assistant
to his father, who combined the
business of a wheelwright with farm-
ing pursuits, and during this period
he laid the foundation of his know'-
ledge on matters agricultural and
pastoral, which proved very useful
in his later career. In the early
sixties Mr. Patrick came to Queens-
land by the sailing ship “Golden
City,” and upon arrival at Moreton
Bay he availed himself of whatever
employment first came to hand in
order to obtain as wide an acquaint-
ance as possible with the new con-
ditions under which he hoped to
build up a fortune for himself.
Being familiar with the routine of
a blacksmithing business, he was
taken on as general hand in a shop
of this description occupying the site
upon which afterwards was erected
the Roma Street Police Station; and
here he witnessed many curious
incidents, now forgotten by the
major portion of the community.
He was much interested to observe
the aboriginals assemble on what is
now Observatory Hill to receive their
annual dole of blankets; and on
another occasion saw the notorious
bushranger, known as “The Wild
Scotchman,” brought, chained in a
dray, through Queen Street, Bris-
bane. Later Mr. Patrick went out
west, where he was occupied in shep-
herding for some years ; and eventu-
ally he returned to the coast and
founded his present homestead at
Upper Kedron. His first purchase
consisted of a block of land comprising
185 acres, which was formerly
the property of the well-known Dr.
Bancroft, and upon this holding ne
built his first residence, since which
time the area of his property has
been enlarged by an additional
block of 195 acres. In the early
days of his enterprise Mr. Patrick
gave the principal share of his
attention to dairying, catering for
the city milk supply, but subse-
quently, on account of the stringent
labour conditions, which seriously
minimized the profits, he abandoned
this industry and devoted his atten-
tion exclusively to stock dealing, in
which he has proved highly success-
ful, and still carries on. Mr. Patrick
deserves his full share of credit for
the energy and industry with which
he embarked on an undertaking far
from easy, and calling for all the
manly qualities at his command in
order to bring it to a successful issue.
The land when purchased by him
was in its virgin state, and totally
unimproved, and all the labour of
ringbarking, clearing, etc., for the
purpose of letting in the sunlight
and thus improving the quality of
the pasturage, was of the most
strenuous order. In time, however,
operations were established on excel-
lent lines, and he now has the

recovered, and the whole burden of
rearing the family and building up
a home for them in a strange land
fell upon the shoulders of the
mother, who with an enterprise and
energy astonishing in one situated as
she found herself at the time,
embarked, practically single-handed,
on her arduous task. Mrs. Gibbons
is a native of County Monaghan,
Ireland, from which country she
emigrated in 1888 by the steamer
" Duke of Argyle.” After realizing
that the state of her husband’s
health rendered him unfit to main-
tain herself and the children, Mrs.
Gibbons decided upon the bold
venture, for a woman, of taking up
her abode on a block of land, 84
acres in extent, in the scrub country
surrounding Samford. This holding
had been selected by the couple
some time previously, and Mrs.
Gibbons, then a young and very
capable woman, felt that she could
not do better for her family than by
carrying out the scheme of opera-
tions sketched out under happier
auspices. With an eye to the neces-
sary husbanding of her resources,
she first caused a dwelling of
humble design to be erected on the
holding, a slab hut, measuring 20
by 15 feet, serving as the original
family homestead. One of the main
advantages of the block consists in
its ample frontage to the Pine River,
by which an abundant and never-
failing water supply is secured; and
so soon as the first work of removing
the heavy scrub from a portion of
the laud had been accomplished,
Mrs. Gibbons started dairying and
pigraising on a modest scale. Such
an enterprise in those earlier days
was no light task, as the con-
veyance of farm produce over
mountainous roads to the Brisbane
markets entailed heavy labour, and
the little pioneer household experi-
enced to the full all the trials and
hardships which accompany the lot
of the early settler in almost any
unopened-up country. At a later
period dairying gradually gave way
to the cultivation of tropical fruits,
such as bananas and pineapples,
while vegetables in considerable
variety were found to do well upon
the farm. The difficulties attendant
upon a district remote from the best
markets will soon be a thing of the
past, a railway line now (1916) being
in course of construction, the route of
which runs right through "River
View.” As a reward of her strenuous
efforts, prosperity became an estab-
lished thing on the well-managed
little farm, and some two years ago
Mrs. Gibbons built a new and up-to-
date residence, which, standing on an
elevated site on the property, serves
as a landmark in a wide radius of
country. Of handsome design, both
in the interior and externally, this
comfortable, modern home is perhaps
the best testimony to Mrs. Gibbons’
success in her various undertakings,
a success richly deserved, and
grudged to her by none. Mrs.
Gibbons’ eldest son, John Henry

number of years. At the age of 18
young Thomas took up a position as
jackaroo on a station on the Conda-
mine River, and after some years in
the district, returned to the coast
and selected a 250-acre holding at
Samson Vale for farming purposes.
This was a portion of the “Samson
Vale” Station property, situated
upon a creek of the same name,
which had been resumed by the
Government and subdivided for
closer settlement. Upon his block
of land, which was almost totally
unimproved, Thomas Salisbury built
a primitive homestead of slabs of
timber cut from the trees growing on
the property, and settling in with
his wife and family, he proceeded
to stock the place and bring it into
the best order. About 10 years after
acquiring this holding, whilst driv-
ing through the Valley, near Bris-
bane, his horse took fright and
bolted, and he was thrown from the
spring-cart and killed. His widow
continued the conduct of the farm
until her sons were old enough to
relieve her of the onerous duties and
responsibilities this entailed, when
she relinquished command of affairs,
and has since made her home with
one or other of her married sons and
daughters. Mr. Frederick William
Salisbury, the subject of this
memoir, was born at “Brookdale”
Farm, where he now resides, in the
year 1880, and received his educa-
tion at the Samson Creek public
school, which he attended until
about 13 years of age. He then
started work on the farm, where
dairying was in full swing, and
in course of time took over the
property, and has since carried it on
on his own account. He has lived
practically the whole of his life in
the one spot, the only occasion upon
which he has ever been absent from
the farm for more than a week at
a time being that of his marriage,
when he indulged himself in a fort-
night’s holiday. At the present time

He interests himself in the advance-
ment of the district, being a com-
mitteeman of the Pine River Agri-
cultural Society; president of trus-
tees of the local hall; member of
the school committee, and various
other organizations. In politics he
is an ardent advocate for Liberalism;
and as a sportsman is well known in

able opponent on the tennis court
and cricket field, while he is also
something of an expert with the gun
and rifle. He married Gertrude,

Clifford, a native of Forbes, New
South Wales. He was born at
Gracemere, near Rockhampton, in
the year 1872, and received his
primary education in that city,
afterwards attending a public school
at Maytown, on the Palmer River,
in the Gulf Country. Upon the
completion of his studies he began
active life by starting a butchering
character in a locality between May-
town and Limestone, still in the
Palmer district, here being joined
in partnership by Mr. John McLean,
of “Bellevue” Station, on the
Mitchell River. Six months later
he relinquished operations, having
conceived the idea of overlanding a
mob of cattle to Western Australia,
which he had heard spoken highly of
as a cattle country, and of settling
down to pastoral pursuits in the
western State. Collecting his mob,
he started off on his journey, but
upon reaching the Tate country,
near Chillagoe, he found that a
mining race, seven miles in length,
was in course of construction. For
this work, which was carried out at a
cost of between ,£3,000 and £4,000,
a very large number of men were
employed, and Mr. Clifford, seeing
here a splendid opportunity of doing
residents of the district with

considerable capital, he bought into
a cattle run, in partnership with Mr.
William George, and disposing of his
hotel and storekeeping businesss,
took up his residence on the new
property, which was situated on the
Tate River, and comprised about
350 square miles of country, with
an extensive frontage to the river.
The partners carried on for some
times as horse and cattle breeders,
and raised some excellent draught
and saddle stock from the Clydes-
dale stallion, “Premier Massey,”

business on his own account in the
same place. After conducting this
business for about eight months, he
sold out, and shortly afterwards
formed a new connection of a similar
well in his old line of trade, aban-
doned his Western Australian trip,
and building a shop and slaughter-
yard on a homestead block, began
supplying the workmen and other
‘'Cylinder,” and the pony sire,
“Wonderland Merry.” For the herd,
Devon cattle were favoured, and
very meritorious representatives of
this popular strain are to be found


on the station, which was well
stocked with from 2,000 to 3,000
head of cattle when eventually the
property changed hands. About six
months after operations were estab-
lished by the new firm, Mr. George
disposed of his interest to his
partner, Mr. Clifford thus becoming
sole proprietor. Later he disposed
of the station and stock, and pro-
ceeded to Bi'isbane, from which
centre he visited the Mount Pleasant
country, near Petrie, and being
favourably impressed with the
locality, he purchased his present
holding, comprising 160 acres, to
which he shortly afterwards brought
his family, and commenced the
improvement of his new acquisition.
Mr. Clifford has brought to his work
of development a fund of expert
knowledge of the greatest possible
value, and being quick to see how
to turn things to the best advantage,
he has already, even within the
short time that he has been in
occupation, made wonderful strides
tow r ards attaining the ideal which
he has set before him. A running
creek winds its way through the
property, and on the banks of this
stream are fertile flats, highly suit-
able to the purposes of intense
cultivation which Mr. Clifford has
in view. In connection with his

preparations for tillage, with a full
appreciation of the necessity of
ensuring an adequate water service
for the cultivation fields, he has had
installed an up-to-date irrigation
plant, with pipes leading to all parts
of the cultivated area. These pipes
are fitted with sprays, and by this

means the lifegiving showers are
kept continually falling on the
springing crops, among which
lucerne, with its brilliant green
colouring, is the dominant note. A
field of the fodder referred to,
planted in June, after four months’
growth, presented a most beautiful
and healthy appearance, and the
same vitality characterizes other
patches of tilled ground. The pre-
sence of the fine Clydesdale stallion,
“Earl Dundonald,” indicates another
important department of Mr. Clif-
ford’s activity, the breeding of
draught horses for the market being
one of the principal items on his pro-
gramme of future operations. The
dairy cattle, too, receive the best of
attention, their well-being constitut-
ing one of the proprietor’s points of
pride. Special care is taken with their
fodder, which in the dry season is fed
to them by hand; and cold winter
weather is the sign for rugs to be
produced, under the protection of
which the kine can defy the keenest
blast from the west. Mr. Clifford
has laid great stress upon labour-
saving devices and machinery, and
few farms of the same acreage are
better supplied with engines, pumps,
and implements of the latest design.
These include a Hornsby engine, a
Myers pumping plant, and various
other modern inventions for secur-
ing the maximum of results with the
minimum of effort. In the home-
stead equal attention has been paid
to securing ideal conditions of living,
and the home with its airy rooms,
wide verandahs, and comfortable
appointments is a very attractive
place. Mr. Clifford is the head of
a large household, his wife, Helena
Elizabeth, daughter of Mr. James
Fanning, of Ingham, on the Herbert
River, formerly of Ireland, having


borne him a family of 11 children,
of whom four sons and four daugh-
ters survive. Llis sons assist their
father in the work and conduct of
the property, setting him free to
some extent to concern himself in
the public life of the district, in
which he takes a cordial interest.
ARTHUR ASHMOLE, J.P.,
“Ilford House,” Redcliffe, was born
in the month of May, 1853, at
Ilford, Essex, England, where his

father carried on business as a wine
merchant, being a very well-known
personality in his line of trade. An
ancestor by the name of Elias Ash-
mole was distinguished as having
been one of the earliest representa-
tives of the Freemason’s Order in
England, and achieved a further
claim to respect ,as the valued friend
of Isaak Walton, of piscatorial fame.
Mr. Arthur Ashmole was educated
at Ilford and Gravesend, and upon
the conclusion of his scholastic
course became connected with the
important firm of Messrs. Cubitt
and Co., of London, with whom he
served in the capacity of quantity
surveyor for a term of seven years.
He then launched out on his own
account as a master builder at
Ilford, but eventually decided to
leave the Old Country for Australia,
and became a passenger by the
steamship “Bulimba,” sailing for
Brisbane in 1886. After reaching
his destination he visited a few
friends who had preceded him to
Queensland, and having made a
casual inspection of the country
found his way to Redcliffe. About
this time (1887) a committee was
formed at this seaside settlement for
the purpose of inducing the Govern-
ment of the day to build a school-
house, with the object of providing
educational facilities for the youth
of the place. Upon the completion
of the school Mr. Ashmole received
the appointment of schoolmaster,
and beginning with a handful of
scholars he continued to fill this
office very satisfactorily for 21 years,
upon his resignation the roll regis-
tering close on 50 names. Upon his
retirement he was the recipient of
an illuminated address from the
residents of the district, who also
presented him with a token of their
esteem and appreciation in the shape
of a handsome silver watch bearing
the following inscription: "Pre-
sented to Arthur Ashmole, Esq., of
Redcliffe, by the residents of Red-
cliffe, on his retirement from the
Queensland Education Department.
December 31, 1908.” About this
time the position of shire clerk in
the Redcliffe district had fallen
vacant, and out of 35 applicants Mr.
Ashmole was successful in securing-
, O
the appointment. For about five
years he discharged the duties of
this office with ability, its different
departments, including clerical work,
general surveying, and the supervi-
sion of public improvement work,
embracing the erection of a kiosk,
planting of avenues, and general
oversight of such buildings as
churches, hall, etc. Since his
retirement from active life in 1913
Mr. Ashmole has continued to
reside at Redcliffe, and still mani-
fests a very active interest in the
advancement of the place. He was
one of the founders of the Redcliffe
Progress Association, and for a
lengthy period served as secretary to
this organization, of which he is
now president. As secretary and
past master of the Masonic Lodge,
No. 23, he has worked strenuously
to uphold the claims of the frater-
nity in Redcliffe and the surround-
ing district, making his efforts in
this direction a veritable labour of
love. In 1911 he accepted the
Commission of the Peace from the
administration of the day; and he
further continues his usefulness as
a lay reader in connection with the
local Church of England; and
director of the the local hall. In
1888 Mr. Ashmole was married to
Alice, daughter of Mr. Charles
Cutts, one of the earliest identities
of Redclilfe, who was associated with
the grazing industry there for many
years. Of this union there is one
daughter.
WILLIAM HENRY CRUICE,
of Terror Creek, is a son of the late
Rowland Cruice, who like many
others of early Queensland settlers,
before his advent to this State had
followed farming avocations in his
native Ireland, his birthplace being
Tullamore, King’s County, where he
resided until his departure for the
antipodes. Eventually Mr. Cruice
decided to emigrate, and taking
passage by the sailing vessel “Erin-
go-Bragh,” embarked on a voyage
which extended over the period—
lengthy even for those days—of
eight months. Upon arrival at
Moreton Bay the ship cast anchor
at the mouth of the Brisbane River,
and transferred her passengers to a
lighter, by means of which the
remainder of the voyage was safely
accomplished, Mr. Cruice being put

ashore at the Old Emigration Wharf.
After looking round him for a few
days he obtained employment about
Brisbane, but had hardly settled
down to the new condition of things
when news of the gold discoveries at
Gympie reached his ears. Shrewdly


suspecting that here might lie a
more rapid road to fortune than day
labour could ever provide, he
straightway proceeded to the scene
of the find, and opened a store for
the supply of general commodities to
the army of miners who had rushed
the place. Mr. Cruice obtained his
supplies from Brisbane and carried
on this business very successfully for
about three years, when he disposed
of his interests and returned to the
capital. He next obtained a position
as manager of a large sugar planta-
tion at Terror Creek, owned by Mr.
William Day, a police magistrate at
that centre, who also had 300 acres
devoted to the cultivation of corn,
which was grown somewhat exten-
sively by other producers throughout
the district. Whilst devoting his
attention to Mr. Day’s cornfields
and cane plantations Mr. Cruice saw
his opportunity to make a selection
of land at Terror Creek, and having
taken up a promising block of 112
acres, he set to work to clear the
scrub with which his holding was
densely covered. This was in the
early seventies, and from that time
onward Mr. Cruice continued to
advance in prosperity, becoming a

breeder of horses, cattle, and pigs,
and in course of time selecting two
additional farms to make room for
his extended operations. A portion
of his property was timbered with
valuable cedar trees, and of these he
made a profitable proposition, cut-
ting and carting the logs for
transport to the timber merchants.
He met with many hardships, but
did his share towards the develop-
ment of a young district. He died
on February 22, 1910, leaving a
widow, six sons, and four daughters.
Mr. William Henry Cruice was born
on the homestead in connection with
the sugar mill above referred to, the
year of his birth being 1877. He
attended the local school until 16
years of age, when at the termina-
tion of his studies he joined his
father in farming pursuits, and
under the guidance of the latter
gentleman obtained a thorough
initiation into the various branches
of industry conducted on the home
property, where he still resides.

MR. W. H. CRUICES RESIDENCE, TERROR CREEK,
Dairy farming occupies pride of
place among the operations carried
on, the herd at the present time
consisting of upwards of 100 cows;
but considerable attention is also
given to the breeding of pigs, and
some fine Clydesdale horses have
been bred from the stallion “Gowrie
Lad,” who boasts immediate descent
from imported stock, and is now
owned by Mr. Cruice. About 1900
Mr. Cruice started a butchering
business for the supply of Terror
Creek, which proved so successful
that a couple of years ago he opened
a shop in the township which he still
conducts. He married Annie,
daughter of Mr. James Chambers,
of Mount Pleasant, and has one son.
CHRISTOPHER NUGENT, who
carries on dairying pursuits at
“Aspel,” Terror Creek, is a son of
the late William Nugent, of Ireland,
where his fathers before him for
generations were engaged in farm-
ing pursuits. William Nugent came
to Australia at the age of 16, and
subsequently took \ip land at Terror
Creek, where the subject of this
review, Mr. Christopher Nugent,
was born. At the close of his educa-
tion at the local public school the
latter gentleman continued his
studies privately whilst giving his
father considerable assistance on the
farm; and upon attaining his twen-
tieth year, having qualified as a

tion in the Education Department,

his attention to managing this pro-
perty, which embraces an area of

river flats, which cover fully 50
acres, where, in the parlance of the
district, “anything will grow,” and
which form a most valuable asset to
the farmer. About 200 head of
horses and cattle are pastured on the
grass country, and these with their
sleek coats and well-padded sides
present a picture of rural prosperity
and contentment. A Suffolk punch
sire, “Young Mariner,” from which
have sprung many of the fine young
draughts of whom Mr. Nugent is so
justly proud, has been on the estate
for a sufficiently long period to
render him one of the respected
identities of the place, and that he
is prized very highly by his owner is
not difficult to believe. Much about
the farm and homestead has been
untouched since the old days when
everything was new. The young
couple, Mr. Nugent’s father and
mother, began life together in
a slab house, the timber for
which was standing in the forest
when the selection was first
taken up. William Nugent cut

of the primitive pit-saw, which in
common with other settlers he
regarded as the first necessity of his
working equipment. When the first
rooms were built and fitted up, the
next consideration was a cool

three or four cows could be set for
the cream to rise, and the large
cupboard constructed for this pur-
pose is still in existence. As the


herd increased and better facilities
became necessary, a dairy was built
of slabs fully 18 inches in thickness,
with this followed the creamery,
also a cool and airy apartment,

the farm is attractive, with the old-
time charm of an earlier date.

ROBERT WILSON STRAIN, of
“Uplands,” Terror Creek, is a son of
Mr. Thomas Strain, owner of
“Grantley Farm,” situated in the
same district, and was born in 1878
at Brookfield, near Brisbane, where
his father was at that time engaged
in timber-getting pursuits. Mr.
Thomas Strain is a native of County
Armagh, the year of hie birth being
1841. At the conclusion of his
education, at 11 years of age, he
began his initiation into farm duties
on the home property under the
guidance of his father. Upon the
approach of his twentieth year Mr.
Strain booked his passage on a

sailing vessel which had the misfor-
tune to be wrecked in the Bay of
Biscay. The boat returned to
Bristol, where repairs were effected,
and after a delay of several weeks
a fresh start was made. The voyage
was a long and tedious one, extend-
ing over six months, but Moreton
Bay at length was reached, when
the passengers were transferred to a
lighter, called the “Settler,” which
landed them at South Brisbane.
For a time Mr. Strain occupied
himself in timber-getting, but tiring
of this employment he went to the
tin-mines at Stanthorpe, and sub-
sequently to the gold mines at
Gympie, where he gained some
insight into the mining industry.
Eventually he returned to Brook-
field, and for 12 years was engaged
in farming on land which he
selected in that neighbourhood.
Hearing good reports of the Mount
Pleasant district, he visited this
locality, and took up about 300
acres, which he cleared for the
cultivation of corn, continuing there
about three years. He also pur-
chased land at Lacey Creek. After
selling both these blocks he pur-
chased another holding of about 300
acres, and erecting a small dwelling-
house, entered upon the prepara-
tory work of what is now regarded
as one' of the best agricultural farms
of the district. The year 1878
witnessed his initial operations,
which consisted of stumping, clear-
ing, and scrubbing, and ever since
Mr. Thomas Strain has resided on
the property during close on two-
score years, becoming a well-known
and highly-respected member of the
community. He was married in
1870 to Emma, daughter of Mr.
Robert Wilson Henry, a boatbuilder,
of Moggill Creek, and of a family
of eight children two sons and five
daughters survive. Mr. Robert
Wilson Strain, the elder son of the
foregoing gentleman, was educated
at Terror Creek, and upon relin-
quishing his studies made the best
of the good opportunities afforded
him of learning all about farming on
his father’s large property, where
he remained until his twenty-third
year. He then purchased a hold-
ing of 245 acres at Mount Pleasant
from Mr. Storey, the original
selector of this country, who had
felled the scrub, but done little else
in the way of improvement work.
RIVER FLATS ON THE "UPLANDS” ESTATE.
Mr. Strain spent the next two and a
half years in dairying and cultivat-
ing crops on this land, at the end
of which period a property adjoin-
ing his father’s at Terror Creek was
offered him, and shortly afterwards
he became the possessor of 537 aeres

preparing in good seasons for the
inevitable dry ones. He estimates
that these rich flats will produce
almost any class of vegetation, a-nd
if devoted entirely to fodder-growing


will provide ample feed for over
200 cows. At the present time
(1915) when the country is showing
the effects of the drought, he is
milking 40 cows, and while the other
farmers in the district are killing
their young stock he is rearing 46
calves by hand. The whole aspect
of the farm is neat and trim, and
the well-fenced paddocks, numerous
and convenient buildings, and up-to-
date machinery, including a Law-
ience-Kennedy and Gillies milking
machine, by means of which 24
cows can be milked simultaneously,
a turbine separator, and an irriga-
tion plant, convey the impression of
excellent management down to the
smallest details. A certain amount
of stock is bred for market, Mr.
Strain’s Jersey cows being in
demand among Brisbane dairy-
men. Horsebreeding from the sire
"Simeon,” winner of the Melbourne
Cup, is carried on successfully. The
well-known racing pony “Bulgaria,”
who won over 19 races, was also
bred by Mr. Strain. Mr. Strain
married in 1903 Miss Bertha Perske,
the popular schoolteacher of Terror
Creek. This lady is a capable and
willing worker in church and charit-
able affairs, and renders her husband
efficient assistance in all duties
undertaken by him for the benefit of
the local community.

trade, and until he was 18 continued
to attend classes at the technical

life. Following the completion of

liis indentures, he obtained employ-
ment in various firms, and gained
an excellent acquaintance with the
different branches of his trade. In
1889 he made up his mind to leave
the land of his birth, and to seek
a wider field of enterprise at the
antipodes, whither many of his
countrymen had emigrated and
worked their way to a position of
comfort and affluence. He was
affianced in marriage to Christina,
daughter of Mr. Wilhelm Wetzel, of
Wurtemburg, who decided to take
,- , ,
the same step on her own account,
and the young people sailed
from Bremer by the “Hohenzollern”
steamship, arriving at Sydney, Ne
South Wales, in January, 188£
Mr. Schmidt first engaged himse
as general hand on an orchard
the fruitgrowing district of Lan
Cove, and six months later cel
brated his wedding, and with h
wife took a position as marriec
couple on a station known
“Fleurs,” near St. Mary’s, wher
they remained for nine months,
return was then made to Sydney
where Mr. Schmidt began to wor
at his trade in connection with th
firm of Mesrs. Angus & Son, coach
builders, of Castlereagh Street, anc
was still in this employ when th
maritime strike occurred which thre\
so many excellent craftsmen out o
their posts. At this juncture h
decided to come to Brisbane and tr
his fortune in the Northern State
this time on the land, in accord
ance witli which intention he leasee
a farm at Cleveland. Meeting wit
financial disaster in this venture, he
turned again to his trade, and fo
about four years resided at Chirn
side, where he pursued his calling
until land was thrown open for
selection at Lacey Creek. Keeping
the future prospects of the family in
view, he took the opportunity thus
offered to acquire about 80 acres at
2s. 6d. per acre, and placing his wife
and children on this property, him-
self continued the work on which
he had been engaged for a few
months longer. He then joined his
family on the farm, and vigorously
took in hand the work of improve-
ment. clearing and cultivating as
rapidly as his resources allowed.
Potatoes and other root crops
flourished, and corn was also grown
with success. A little later, con-
jointly with this enterprise, Mr.
Schmidt established a coachbuilding
and general smith’s business at
Terror Creek, which he conducted
for two years, but eventually on
account of ill-health sold out and
returned to farming. An adjoining
holding of 200 acres being in the
market about this time, he secured
this additional area, and completing
the fencing directed hie attention to
securing t lie best possible results
from his proposition. Dairying
operations were in full swing and
giving satisfactory returns; and Mr.
Schmidt became convinced that there
was a future ahead of the banana-
growing industry in a district which
had proved so generally suited to
both tillage and grazing. The neigh-
bouring settlers were inclined to treat
this suggestion with good-natured


ridicule, but undeterred by their
sceptical comments, he made a
trial with the palms, which proved
successful, and by degrees had an
area of 15 acres under cultivation.
Eventually these were destroyed by
fire, and Mr. Schmidt being kept
very busy with his dairy herd did
not replace them. Further disaster
awaited him, the cattle dying whole-
sale of a prevalent disease, and at
last he was brought practically to
a standstill. Undaunted, he pur-
chased a few r head of cattle, and
started them on the pastures, and
then to augment his finances he once
more turned to his trade, applying
his knowledge of working in wood
to the building of houses, etc.,
in the district, which at the time was
going ahead rapidly. Among other
structures erected by him was the
school of arts at Mount Pleasant, in
connection with which he gave the
greater part of his services in recog-
nition of the educational nature of
the movement. His stock coming to
maturity, he resumed the conduct of
the farm, which he continued until
1914, when he disposed of it, and
purchased a large block of land at
Terror Creek. Here he built his
present home, and buying back his
old coachbuilding business, took two
of his sons into partnership, since
when he has occupied his activities
in directing operations so as to build
up the concern in the best possible
manner. Being the only business of
its kind at that centre, it commands
a large connection, and has fully
rewarded the efforts of its promoters,
who undertake the construction of
all classes of vehicles, in which they
do a big trade. Mr. Schmidt has
used his influence in furthering the
interests of the district, and it was
by his advice that the present saw-
mill was located there. He was
gazetted to the Commission of the
Peace about 1908; and is a member
of the Coronation Masonic Lodge.
He has a family of five sons and
four daughters.
