HISTORY OF THE INGLEWOOD REEFS.
Introduction.
It is a well-known axiom to all men of ordinary
intelligence that the written history of a country
may bo numbered among its most valuable re-
cords, inasmuch as that a knowledge of the past
will frequently give the experience which will
be an advantage in the present, and act as a
guide for the future. The same argument ap-
plies, and with considerable force, to the mining
history of a district. It is therefore proposed to
give a series of papers, compiled from the most
reliable sources, which shall present, in as con-
densed a form as possible, an authentic history
of the Inglewood Reefs. Feeling that records of
this nature are worse than useless if their au-
thenticity cannot be relied on, no trouble or
expense will be spared to render the present
series of papers worthy of being made a work of
reference by all miners and mining speculators
interested in this district. At the time of the
great fire in December, 1862, mining on Ingle-
wood received so severe a shock, that we have
heard it doubted by many persons whether it
has yet recovered from it. Considering the very
small number of reefs now in work, compared
with the number before the fire took place, it is
reasonable to believe that it has not. The reefs
still remain. Why then are they not worked ?
is a natural question, and the same answer is
given on every side by the miners—“ Because
wo have not the money in our pockets to bear
the expenses of prospecting.” How, therefore
that Inglewood is endeavouring to obtain the
aid of foreign capital for the purpose of de-
veloping its resources, there is no doubt that a
work such as the one now proposed to be laid


before the public, will prove valuable and bene-
licial to a considerable degree, as it will be a
revelation that will inspire confidence in the
value and extent of the resources of this district
in the minds of capitalists looking for a good
investment, and with such resources as it is
known to possess, this is all that is required to
ensure for Inglewood a lasting prosperity. But
again, nothing would be more injurious to the
interests of this town, than to find the shares of
a number of bubble companies on the stock
market; these manias benefit a few designing
speculators, but the interests of the public at
large are jeopardised, if not mined. A properly
compiled history of the Inglewood Beefs will,
to a considerable extent, protect the town from
receiving a check in its endeavours to achieve
prosperity, by exposing the machinations of de-
signing adventurers, who start companies upon
false representations, and the same history will
proportionately aid enterprises of a lona fide
character, by clearly demonstrating their un-
doubted value.
The experience of every goldfield that has yet
been opened has shown that, however rich the
deposits may be, a time will come in a longer or
shorter period, according to circumstances,
when all isolated efforts for securing the golden
treasures which lie below, will bo futile, and
when combination, not only of capital and la-
bour, but of knowledge of the reefs and leads,
will be necessary for their profitable working.
Nor must we think that the latter is an unim-
portant element in our success. As in the pur-
suit of our object we penetrate deeper and
deeper, it is evident that it becomes a matter of
greater consideration to us, that as little of our
capital and labour as possible should be wasted
in misdirected exertions. Under such circum-


stances we cannot afford to make more experi-
ments than we can help, and the successful pro-
secution of our researches for the precious metal,
will greatly depend upon the number and authen-
ticity of the data which we possess to guide us
in the search. The amount of labour expended
and capital sunk upon the various diggings,
through ignorance of the direction, the thick-
ness, the dip, &c., of the various reefs, is almost
incalculable, and yet very little pains have been
taken hitherto to collect the scattered experi-
ences gained upon the several reefs and goldfields,
by those who discovered them, or have worked
upon them for any length of time. Practical
mining, as far at least as gold is concerned, is
yet in its infancy, but enough is already known of
it, to show that the theories of even the greatest
names in geological science are no safe guides to
us in our calculations. After a dozen years we
begin to find that all our speculations as to the
origin of gold, the means by which it was depo-
sited, whether fire or water was the principal
agent in separating it from the matrix, and a
score of other questions equally knotty, have
only provoked discussion, but not increased our
positive knowledge of the subject. Indulging
in such speculations is indeed beginning at the
wrong end, and yet this has been the course
adopted.
In talking over mining matters with different
individuals who have perhaps been years on the
diggings, we are struck with the limited range
over which their knowledge extends. One per-
son can give the fullest and most accurate infor-
mation about a particular reef or lead, but ho
knows very little of others perhaps not half a
mile from it. These again have their represen-
tatives, who can record all the minutiae of their
history, but are ignorant of what is doing in


other quarters. ISTow the knowledge thus pos-
sessed by these individuals is useful to themsel-
ves only, until it is collected and added to that
of others, but when the mass of facts thus col-
lected from various points and by various per-
sons is properly arranged and digested, the first
step has been taken towards discovering the laws
which regulate the deposition and production of
gold, and a guide is furnished to us which,
though not yet unerring, is still better than the
blind chance upon which we have been in the
habit of depending in our search for auriferous
deposits.
The facts which have been collected of some
of the most famous reefs of this district, and
which it is intended to publish in the present
history, will not only have the effect of showing
clearly the enormous amount of golden stone
which is lying ready to be raised, and the ave-
rage amount of gold which it may be expected
to yield, and thus encourage the distant as well
as the local capitalist to invest in our mines, but
they will become part of a comprehensive series
upon which the future theorist will build a
science by which the prospector and the miner
will, at some future time, be enabled to go for-
ward to their object with confidence, and not
waste their energies, as they now often do, upon
a blind chance or an unfounded speculation.
Such being the object of the undertaking, the
writer felt the greatest confidence in being able
to obtain, through the kindness of those best
abl« to aflord it, the fullest and most accurate
information, and he is happy to state that in no
instance has it been withheld, where it was pos-
sible to gr’ant it. As might have been expected,
much valuable information is lost from the un-
settled and shifting nature of the mining popu-
lation —as, for instance, the first rush to jShw


Zealand, in IS6I, was the cause of an immense
number of promising claims being registered, to
allow of the owners visiting the new El Dorado.
In a great majority of instances these men have
not returned, and ever since their claims have
remained unworked, and at the present day are
without owners. The loss of a great portion
of the history of these claims is much to be re-
gretted, but it is certain that the time has arrived
when their published history, drawn from the
scanty materials that are yet obtainable, will bo
the means of again drawing attention to them.
A fresh trial of them will certainly follow, and
the result in all likelihood will be such as not
only to establish the character of this district for
possessing almost unlimited mining capabilities,
but will fully justify the writer in the opinion ha
has formed, that a large proportion of the de-
pression under which it has been labouring for
some time past, has been due to the lack of ao-
curate information, arising from want of proper
publicity. It is therefore intended to give an
equal amount of attention to this deserted
ground, as to the account of the workings and
brilliant results of our most celebrated lines.
The idea was at first entertained of taking the
different lines in the order in which they were
opened, but this was found to be impossible, as
in very few cases is the date of their first break-
ing ground known within a few months. This
is, however, of little importance, but as it has
been ascertained, apparently beyond a doubt,
that the Old Inglewood was the reef first opened,
it is proposed to give it first place, and a des-
cription of it will accordingly form the subject
of the first chapter.


Chapter I,
THE OLD INGLEWOOD KEEP.
On the 271 h of November, 1859, G. Carter, J.
Stewart, J. Edel, and W. Thompson, lodged the ne-
cessary notice that they had marked out 180 feet on a
reef, to be called the Old Inglewood, G. Carter hav-
ing previously found gold in quartz on the surface.
On commencing work, a reef was very soon found
which held out good prospects, but it was not until
the month of March in the following year, that the
stone was struck, which has caused this claim to
rank among the noted ones of the district. It is much
to be regretted that no accounts have been preserved
of the yields of this claim, but according to the verbal
statement of Mr Carter, nearly £13,000 was obtained
in the course of a few months. So promising indeed
did the prospects appear, that the proprietors were in-
duced to erect steam ciushing, pumping, and wind-
ing machinery on the claim at a cost of £3,400, the
plant consisting of a 25-horse power horizontal en-
gine, two batteries of stamps of f»ur heads each, lift
pump with 300 feet of 7 -inch piping, and all neces-
sary winding gear; the shaft was sunk, and splendidly
timbered to a depth of 260 feet, but nothing could bo
found to compensate their enormous outlay. The best
stone was obtained at a depth of about 70 feet,
where 93 tons of stone wore produced, yielding 8250 z.
of gold, but it is the opinion of Mr Carter, that the
stone left in the claim above the prospected level is
not worth more than l|dwts per ton, this would
seem to promise but very poorly for the future, but
further inquiries have brought to light a few rather
interesting facts in connection with this once rich
claim. For instance, No. 1 north, is a claim, that up
to the present time, has produced about £2OO worth
of gold. At a depth of 214 feet, the proprietors took
out stone at their boundary leading into the prospect
claim, which yielded lor. 2dwts. prr ton ; this stone


was dipping southward so acutely, as to show that it
has never yet been Touched in the prospect claim, it
never having been sunk below 200 feet, and the dip
of the stone showing it to have been impossible for it
to have been reached at so shallow a depth. Again,
in the ground south of the prospecting claim, a reef
has been discovered at a distance of 80 feet westward,
which has been called the Kelveton. This reef un-
derlies eastward at an angle of about 45 degrees,
meeting the Old Inglewood line, which underlies
westward, the junction of these two reefs has been
struck in No. 2, South, (otherwise known as No. 2
North Kelveton,) at the water level, namely, 200
feet, when operations had to be suspended, as the
pumping engine on the prospect claim had ceased to
work. The Kelveton Reef has produced payable stone
so far as it has been worked. Its yields have ranged
between ozs. down to 4 dwts. per ton, the whole
yield averaging nearly 15 dwts. per ton. This reef
has not yet been touched in the prospect claim, as in
sinning the shaft perpendicularly, the reef was cut
through and the junction of the two lines passed over.
All this would seem to show that the present pros-
pectors have good fortune yet in store for them. The
pumping machinery has lately been removed. This
is to be regretted, as the probability is, that it will
shortly have to be replaced at two or three times the
cost of the amount realized by the one just sold. It
appears to be the general opinion of those interested
iu the reef, that the removal of this machinery was a
most injudicious step, as it did its work well and ef-
fectually, the reef being kept drained to a depth of
260 feet, [i.e, the deepest point gained,) with from
two to three hours pumping per day. This is suffi-
cient to show that it would have been capable of
draining the mine for a very considerable depth. Its
removal has caused a stoppage of operations along
nearly the whole length of the line, all claims being
either registered or abandoned, up to No. 12, North.
In No, 1 South, av immense amount of work has
been done, gold w'as first obtained in December,
1860, at a depth of 120 feet, in the same lode from


which the prospectors’ obtained their rich patch,
there is likewise another lode at the distance of
about 40 feet eastward of the main body, and this
also has produced good payable stone. A shaft has
been sunk on the northern extremity of the claim to
a depth of 180 feet. The main reef has been driven
through showing a body of stone 26 feet in width,
with gold more or less all through, a trial of 80 tons
gave a result of 2 dwts. per ton. The following ac-
count of crushings furnished by Mr W. Smith, may
relied upon as correct

No. 2 south is known likewise as No. 2 north
Kelveton, and comparing the amount of work done
in this claim on the two lines respectively, the latter
appears its most appropriate name. All the work
done in this claim on the Old Inglewood line is
sinking a shaft 180 feet, and extracting 22 tons of
stone, which produced 7 ozs 14 dwts. The result
of the work on the Kelveton line is as follows: —

The stone producing the above results was struck
at a depth of 60 feet, and-it has been entirely cleared
out from that to a depth of 130 feet, by h length of
80 feet along the line. From the next claim south-

ings have been obtained :

Following on southward is the claim known as
the Kelveton Prospecting Claim. Little appears to
be known of it, the original proprietors having left,
One fact in connection with it appears however 1o
be tolerably well authenticated, namely, that soon
after stone was struck twenty pounds weight of
specimens produced 20 ozs of gold. Various
crushings have since been obtained, with yields
varying from 4 dwts to 12 dwts per ton. This ap .
pears to terminate the workings southward on this
line. Northward, gold has been obtained in Nos. 1,
2,3, 4,5, 12, 13, 15, and 17 ; Nos. 1,2, 3, and
being the only claims that have given anything
worth mentioning. No. 1 has produced about 50
ounces, but the detailed account is not obtainable
No. 2 has produced the following
The above crushings were obtained at depths
varying from 128 to 150 feet; gold was likewise
found at from 180 to 190 feet, but the stone was
never thoroughly tested, as it was supposed not to
be payable; the latter mentioned depth is the
deepest point this claim has been sunk to. The
results of No. 3 are not known ; from No. 12 Ihe
following account has been kept by Mr Target, one

These crusKings were produced from the surface
down to a depth of 50 feet. Sinking has been con-
tinued down to 170 feet, but gold has not been
seen below 60 feet. The thickness of the reef in
this claim from the surface down to the greatest
depth gained, has averaged 2J feet. The whole of
this line at the present time remains in a state of in-
activity, the greater part of it being held under lease.
This terminates all that it is considered necessary to
record of the history of the Old Inglewood Reef ;
the earlier part of its career has been sufficiently
brilliant to inspire the belief that its present con-
dition is not the inertness of death, but only the
result of a drowsiness from which it will shortly
arouse.

GODWIN SEEP, SURFACE 111 LX..
1 his ground was first opened for surface at the
commencement of the rush, in 1859, and many parts
of it proved of extraordinary richness. Beneath, the
surface a layer of cement was found, composed prin-
cipally of a white description of quartz, which was
very extensively worked and yielded in many in-
stances as much as from four to five ounces to the
ton. Ihe existence of this bed of quartz cement led
to a further examination of the ground which re-
sulted in ATKenzie and Co. in about October iB6O,
discovering the reef which was subsequently known
as the Godwin. In this claim the reef which was
found not far from the surface was at first only eight
inches in width, gold was found in it as soon as the
reef was Drought to light, and a trial crushing of five
tons produced 5 ozs. to the ton. The exact amount
produced at this part of the reef in this claim is not
known as accounts were not kept, but the prospectors
state that it was over three thousand pounds. An
inspection of the claim has shown it to have been
very imperfectly worked. It would seem as though
the owners had been hunting for rich patches, instead
of systematically working, and the consequence is
that an immense amount of stone has been let) in this
part of the workings, which have not been continued
to a greater depth than about forty feet. The shaft
was eventually sunk to water level, which is about
140 feet, where the reef was found to be 20 feet in
thickness, this was driven through, and good speci-
mens obtained in various parts of it, but from some
unexplained reason it was not deemed necessary to
prosecute work any further, and it was accordingly
abandoned. In the early part of the present year it
was again taken up, since which the following results
have been obtained, principally from the old work-
ings ;

Or an average of 7 dwts 7 grs to the ton. An ex-
amination of the claim has shown that an immense
amount of tho same description of stone yet remains.
The present proprietors of this claim have further
prospected it by sinking a shaft about one hundred
feet westward of the old working, where a body of
stone 4 feet in thickness was found which upon trial
proved worth 7 dwts to the ton. In No. 1 south, the
character of the work done very much resembles that
in the prospecting claim. One part only appears to
have had proper attention paid to it, namely, the
surface block. This has been taken out for a width
t.f twenty feet in some parts, but there is still much
left behind. Babtie and Co., the first holders of this
ground, obtained the following crushings principally
from the surface block :

mained without an owner. In the early part of 1864,
it was again taken up, since which the following

The above shows an average of nearly 10 dwts to
the ton. It seems a pity that ground, the last four
crushings from which have given such yields, should
have its workings left for the swallows to quietly
build their nests in, yet such is the case in the
present instance. Following on north, is a short
stretch of ground, of which little is known, further
than that it contains stone in almost unlimited quan-
tities, worth from 3to 5 dwts to the ton. The next
and last claim southward, of which any intelligence
is obtainable, is that known as M'Kinney and
M'Naughton’s. This ground has been very good ;
it was steadily worked for six or seven months,
giving, during the whole time, from 50 to 60 tons
per week. The books of the claim were burnt in the
great fire of December, 1862, consequently a de-
tailed account cannot be rendered, but Mr M‘Naugh-
ton states, that the yield was certainly not less than
an average of 16 dwts to the ton, all through. Ac-
cording to this, the gross proceeds of the claim, in
cash, would exceed £4,000. This promising claim
had to be abandoned, in consequence of inability to
conquer the water.
In No. 1, north, gold has likewise been obtained
in very considerable quantities, but, as in the
Prospecting Claim, and No. 1, south, the work has
been of a very irregular character. What the result
of this work was, is not known, but it is certain that
some good crushings were obtained. Like the Pros-
pecting Claim, and No. 1, south, it too was aban-
doned, and re-taken up in the early part of 1864,
when the following crushings were obtained from
July 7 .... 7 ~ 2 13 .. 6
Total .. 23 tons 16 ozs 6 dwts 19gr


Showing an average of a little over M dwts 5 grs
to the ton.
No. 2, north, otherwise known as the Great
Eastern claim, has undoubtedly been, up to the
present time, the most important on this line. It
was marked out by Messrs M'Farlane, M'Callum,
Courriei, and Taylor, at about the same time as the
Prospecting Claim, namely, September or October,
1860. The cement that had been taken from the
surface of this claim, before M'Farlane and Co.
came into possession, had given a yield ranging be-
tween 1 and 8 ozs to the ton. Payable stone was
obtained in the claim, within 2 feet of the surface.
Not far from this, quartz was obtained, and in con-
siderable quantities too, that gave a yield of 12 ozs
to the ton. This block of stone has been taken out
the whole length of the claim, down to a depth of
45 feet, at which level it ran out; it had a northern
dip, a western underlay, and averaged from 12 to 15
feet in thickness. In some parts it attained the
width of 25 feet, it is estimated that this block of
stone averaged in this'claim about 6 ozs to the ton,
throughout, A new making of the above-mentioned
block was first struck in a drive at a depth of 70
feet, and the first crushing from it gave a yield of
5 ozs to the ton ; the lode is 10 feet in thickness, but
up to the present time a face of 4 feet is all that has
been taken out, that being the best of it. This sys-
tem of working was carried on the whole length of
the claim, down to a depth of 90 feet, a very large
quantity of stone must therefore be left in this part
of the claim, and although the value of it is proble-
matical, still the probab lities are greatly in favour
of its paying well for working, more especially as is
is laid bare ready for knocking down. Payable
quartz stopped in this lode at 90 feet. Sinking was
continued to a depth of 160 feet, at which level
operations had to be suspended in consequence of
the great influx of water. At this, the deepest point
gained, the lode is 20 feet in thickness, but pros-
pecting operations on it will have to be suspended
until pumping machinery is on the ground. A small

leader only 2 inches in thickness has been carried
down with the shaft to the bottom, producing good
gold the whole way. This claim has been driven
from east to west a distance of 70 feet, but no stone
but the one main lode has been seen. The following
account of the different crushings from this claim
have been furnished by' Mr M'Farlane, who is still
a shareholder.
Total ,
In consequence of the number of tons in some in-
stances not being obtainable the exact average value
cannot be given, but it is certain that it was little
short of 4 ozs, to the ton. The claim producing the
above splendid results was “jumped ” in the latter
part of the year 1860, when the interlopers in the
course of one night only removed stone that pro-
duced 80 ozs of gold. This fact was brought to light
shortly afterwards in evidence given before tbc Court
of Mines at Wedderburne, when Messrs M'Farlanc
and Co., doubtless very much to their satisfaction
recovered possession of their claim. North of the
Great Eastern one claim only appears to have been
worked to any extent. No certain information of
any description appears to be obtainable, but men
who were in the neighbourhood at the time of its


being worked state that for some time it paid well.
The whole of the above-mentioned ground south of
the Great Eastern Claim is now held under lease,
and a company is in course of formation for the pur-
pose of erecting pumping machinery. Should they
be successful in the attempt, it will enable a further
exploration of the rich lodes that have hitherto been
abandoned, as no power short of steam could over-
come the water. Pending the formation of this
Company work along the whole of the line is sus-
pended.
The following is extracted from a report of this
hill by J. S. Robertson, Esq., District Mining Sur-
veyor : —“ On a very considerable portion of the
leased ground (between 7 and 8 acres), and at a depth
yarving from 6 inches to 2 feet from the surface, ex-
ists a stratum of auriferous concrete, or what is termed
cement. I estimate the quantity of this from the va-
rious trial holes I have had sunk at about 40,000 tons.
This calculation is based on the ground that the stra-
tum will average three feet throughout, although in
several places I found it to exceed five feet.”
Since the publication of the first edition of this
history the company alluded to above has commenced
operations so far as. the prospecting the ground is
concerned. Two lots of over a hundred tons each of the
cement lying on the surface have been crushed, and
the yield is found to he over 8 dwts to the ton, two
trial lots of 5 tons each from the ground known as
M‘Kay and M'Naughton’s claim have likewise been
crushed, one giving a return of 8 and the other 15
dwts to the ton. It is intended to erect a pumping
and crushing plant on the ground, at a cost of about
£3,000 or £4,000. The capital of the company is
£16,000, in 16,000 shares of £1 each; 12,000 shares
paid up to 12s. 6d. each have been paid for the ground,
leaving an amount of £8,500 available for the erection
of machinery, and working the mine. The writer
takes leave of the Surface Hill Co., Godwin Reef,
with the advice Soyez ferme ] let them follow it and
their success is certain.


CHAPTKXi 111.
THE POVERTY REEF.
The next lines for consideration are two of %
group, in the flat westward of the township, namely,
the Poverty and the Morning Star. There is little
doubt but that these two, correctly speaking, are
one and the same reef, but as claims were taken up
at different times in both names, it is proposed to
notice them separately; but, likewise, to save con-
it is the intention to limit the notice of the
“Poverty,” to the lease held by Messrs Baragwanath
and Samuel, leaving the remaining claims to be in-
cluded in the Morning Star. The principal part of
the work on this ground has been done in what was
originally known No. 2, north, and which imme-
diately abuts on No. 3, north, Morning Star. It
was first taken up in May or June, 1860, by Messrs
Lynn and party; but after working but a few weeks
and sinking two shafts to a depth of about 30 feet,
they registered it, and left the district for a “rush”
to Kingower. As operations had not been carried
on for a period of three months, the registration
was, of course* illegal, and it was almost imme-
diately taken possession of, by Messrs Baragwanath
and Samuel. Immediately on getting possession,
work was commenced in one of the shafts sunk by
Lynn and party, which was continued to a depth of
about 120 feet, or near to the original water-level.
At this point it became apparent, that all operations
had hitherto been carried on too far eastward, an-
other shaft was therefore commenced about 80 feet
west of the former, which was sunk to a depth of
135 feet. At this level, a body of stone was dis-
covered 5 feet in thickness, having an eastern un-
derlay, a trial crushing from which of 4 tons gave a
yield of 3 dwts to the ton. Another trial of 18 tons
was then sent to the mill, and gave 6 dwts to tho
ton ; and a third crushing of 17 tons yielded 3 dwts


Jto the ton, Although these yields were not large,
they were still sufficiently so, to encourage further
prospecting, hut from the great, influx of water at
the level at which stone was first discovered, it was
clearly apparent that nothing could be attempted at
a greater depth, without the aid of steam-pumping
machinery. The erection of a steam-engine with
pump and winding gear attached was therefore de-
termined on. But before doing so, it was thought
desirable to alter the tenure upon which the ground
was held, by obtaining a lease ; this was done, in-
cluding in the lease the neighbouring claim north,
which had been purchased by Messrs Baragwanath
and Saraucd, for the sum of £4O. The lease was
applied for on the 17th of February, 1862, and was
duly enacted on the 2nd July following, and it may
be worthy of remark, that this was the first mining
lease applied for and obtained in this district; the
extent of ground so held in this instance is about
two acres and a half. The machinery that was
eventually erected, consisted of a steam-engine of
twelve and a-half horse power, winding gear and
pump with six inch lifts, being attached thereto,
the engine being, according to the opinion of the
proprietors, capable of draining the mine to a depth
of 400 feet. The entire plant has involved an out-
lay of £9OO. On the completion of the machinery,
prospecting was immediately commenced below the
original water level, on the body of stone already
discovered. A correct and perfectly detailed account
of the work done on the above mentioned stone can-
not be given, a portion only of it being obtainable,
but the total yield, according to tho opinion of Mr
Baragwanath, is about 600 tons of stone, giving about
400 ounces of gold. In this ground, as in most other
claims in its immediate neighbourhood, there is no
regular well defined lode, but a succession of blocks
of stone, varying in size from 5 to 27 feet in thick-
ness ; some of these blocks arc payable, others not so,
but there is every probability that tho most valuable
yet discovered, is one that has been found at the 195
feet level. This block of stone has been driven through,


proving its width to bo 27 feet. A crushing of stone,
of 9 tons, from this drive, gave a yield of 9 dwts to
the ton, but stone of a far higher value is confidently
believed to remain. Work on this body of stone is at
present suspended, as the shaft being but 200 feet in
depth, it will be necessaiy to sink it a greater depth
first for the purpose of effecting drainage.
In the assessment of the neighbouring claims for
drainage, the proprietors of this ground have at va-
rious times bo m involved in tedious litigation, in con-
sequence of the defective and uncertain character of
the drainage laws, the expensive opeiation of sinking
deeper has therefore been suspended, pending the
amendment of the laws in question. Before the
stoppage of the works the proprietors, wishing to as-
certain as correctly as possible the value of the atone
under water, obtained from the greatest depth that
could bo reached, and at various places along its whole
width, seven prospects, and in every instance the re-
sult was such as to convince them that the richest
stone that the claim has yet produced, is inferior in
value to that which has yet to bo taken out. For tho
purpose of effecting drainage of the various neigh-
bouring claims, on whai is known as the Morning
Star line, two drives have been put in westward at
tho 157 and 195 feet levels—their length being about
80 and 90 feet respectively ; a considerable amount of
prospecting, in tho shape of drives, &c., has likewise
been done, but the result has not been such as to call
for any special notice. la the opening up of thiamine
much praiseworthy energy, perseverance, and enter-
prise has been shown ; and, including the cost of la-
bour, machinery, and mining tools, a sum of money
exceeding £3,000 has been expended. It is therefore
gratifying to know that the prospects opened up are
such, as to hold out tolerably certain hopes to the pro-
prietors of ere long reaping literally a golden reward.
A description of the neighbouring ground, known as
the “ Morning Star,’' will form the subject of the
next chapter.


C HAPTER IV.
THB MORNING STAR.
The present chapter will comprise a description
of the Morning Star Keef, coupled with the southern
claims of the “ Poverty.” The ground where the
Morning Star Reef was discovered, was first taken
up by Messrs Ford and party for alluvial working.
A grant was obtained for a prospecting claim on 3rd
November, 1860, and it is very doubtful whether
Inglewood has hitherto produced a piece of ground
of similar area, that has produced so large an amount
of gold, with so small an expense of labour. The
amount of gold produced from these surface work-
ings cannot be given, as the lucky finders have long
since returned to the “old country,” there to enjoy
the fruits of their labour Reports are prevalent in
this, as in every other instance, of great finds, that
are doubtless gross exaggerations, but putting these
out of sight, it is unquestionably certain that many
thousands of pounds were netted from this ground
by the puddling machine alone. It may be men-
tioned that it is the opinion of Mr John Ford, who
is brother to the original prospector, that the gold
yielded from the surface, produced by sale, cash to
the amount of over £7,000. This surface has been
taken from nearly the entire area of the claim, to a
depth of 5 to 6 feet, and quartz was found at a depth
of about 12 or 14 feet below it. The stone in this
claim was payable from the first; there is no regu-
lar lode, but as in the “ Poverty’’ line, a succession
of blocks which have been worked to a partial ex-
tent from the level at which stone was first dis-
covered, down to water mark, namely, a depth of
125 feet. The first of these blocks was in some
parts exceedingly rich, the yield in some cases
reaching as much as nearly 10 ounces to the ton, as
for instance on October 24th, 39 tons gave the for-
tunate proprietors r. cake of gold weighing 357 ozs


10 dwts 12 grs. The block from which these splen-
did results were obtained was from five to six
feet in width, having an eastern underlay and a
northern dip. The second block discovered in this
ground, although not so rich as the first, was still
sufficient! 3' so to maintain for the claim a first class re-
putation. The following is the result, which is be-
lieved to be as nearly as possible complete :

of the gold produced, has however, been obtained from
Messrs Ford's original claim. The number of shafts
that have been sunk cannot be given, the whole area
of the claim being dotted with them, the result of
the work having proved that stone in large bodies
exists to a width of over one hundred and fifty feet.
Three shafts have been sunk to the water-level, but
no stone has been taken from below that depth.
When the history of this claim is considered, the
reader will doubtless imagine that the proprietors
have every chance of a brilliant and profitable future.
The next claim southward, although marked out
four months subsequent to Messrs Ford’s, has al-
ways been known as the Prospecting Claim of whe
Morning Star line, in consequence of Messrs Ford
having marked theirs —as mentioned above—for
alluvial working. Anything approaching a com"
plete history of this claim cannot be given, the
original proprietors having long since left the dis-
trict ; it is, however, known that the marker out of
the ground was an Italian, named Melgovirch. The
claim has been sunk on down to the water-level, at
which depth stone in large quantities exists, bearing
gold, and presenting every appearance of improving.
Stone has been crushed from various blocks and at
various depths, out a complete list cannot be fur-
nished, as not only the party for whom it was
crushed, but likewise those who crushed it, have long
since left the distiic.; records of the following crush-
ings have however been obtained, which will perhaps
furnish some idea of the average value of the whole.

The above portion of the yield of this claim gives
an average of loz i dwt to the ton. In this claim,
as in the neighbouring one north, a great number
of shafts have been sunk, and with the like result
of revealing the existence of stone in almost fabu-
lous quantities. The surface washed from this
claim has likewise been of an exceedingly valuable
character, but, like the quartz, all authentic records
of its value have never transpired ; this is to be re-
gretted, hut the fact is at the time of its being ob-
tained, quietness was absolutely necessary fcr the
proprietors, as such was the disturbed state of
things that any ground known to be valuable was
sure to receive a most unwelcome visit from some
brigade of “jumpers.” No. 1 south is a claim that
remained entirely unproductive of profitable results
until very lately. The first proprietors of this
ground, after a considerable amount of work aban-
doned it as useless, and for some time it remained
without owners. It was subsequently taken up by
the party at present holding possession, but their
first operations were entirely unattended with profit,
the work havi ig been done too far to the east; sub-
sequently some rubble stone was found on the sur-
face some distance further west, from which fair
prospects could be obtained, and a trial crushing
proved it worth about 9 dwts to the ton ; but after
about 10 tons had been obtained it run out to so
small a size as to make it impossible to work it with
profit. It was determined, however, to sink a shaft
on this spot, one was accordingly put down, and at
a depth of 70 feet a leader about one inch in thick-
ness was discovered, from which a very excellent
prospect was obtained ; this stone gradually made
out till it obtained a thickness of from a foot and a
half to two feet, the first crushing from it gave the
very satisfactory result of nearly 3 ozs to the ton.
This body of stone, the same as all hitherto found
on this line, underlays east, and has a northern dip;
up to the present time it has been worked a length
from north to south of about 70 feet by a depth of
about lo feet. The following is the result.

The above crushings show an average of 18 dwts
7 grs to the ton. An opinion appears to be enter-
tained by the proprietors of this claim, that much
profitable work remains to be done at shallower
depths than the above mentioned workings. The
length of this claim when first marked out was not
more than filty feet; the ground south of it subse-
quently became abandoned, when the present
holders increased its size to its present dimensions.
Up to this time the ground so pegged in, and which
had always been known as No. 2, south, had pro-
duced the following crushings :

The claim at present known as No. 2, south, is one
of 400 feet, two shafts have been sunk on it, each
of them to considerable depths, but nothing has
been discovered to compensate for the amount of
labour expended This claim terminates the work-
ings at the southern end of this line.
It has been stated that the first claim marked out
on this line was known as Ford’s Alluvial Prospect-
ing Claim; the ground, as therein stated, is north of
the Prospecting Claim for the Morning Star Reef, and
is likewise known as Nos. 1 and 2, north. The next
claim therefore that remains to be noticed is No. 3,
north. This claim undoubtedly taxes rank among
the most important in the district. It will be seen
from the list of crushings that this claim has produced,
that it has maintained its character nearly from the
commencement of its being worked, to the present
time. The ground was marked out in the latter part

of thg year 1850, by a party of brothers named Needs,
all of whom, with one exception, still retain posses*
sioi. The first shaft sunk was considerably too iar
w -stward ; the second was put down 55 feet east-
ward of it, and in a drive 10 feet to the east, at a
depth of about 60 feet, stone was discovered, a trial
crushing from which of 3 tons, gave 12 dwls 12 grs of
g 4d. At this time, carting and crushing was a guinea
per ton ; at such a rate a yield of this sort, of course,
would not pay, and the claim was in consequence re-
gistered for three months. On returning to woik at
the expiration of the term of regis ration, the pro-
prietors found their right to a portion of the north
end of their claim, disputed by the holders of No. 4 ;
a considerable amount of vexatious litigation followed,
which, however, resulted in favour of the proprietors
of No. 3. This litigation of course, much impeded
opcations, but at its termination, work proceeded
with vigour. It would be impossible to give a de-
tailed account of all the work that has been since
done, the ground being for a width of over 120 feet, a
complete mass of small blocks of stone ; these blocks
have, of course, varied in value, some having been of
Very great richness, as, for instance, that from which
a crushing was obtained on May 21, 1862, when an
average of 21 ozs to the ton was the result. The
following splendid list of crushings is a correct and

The above Hat shows an average of a trifle over 1


oz 3 dwts 16 grs to the ton. In addition to the above,
about 200 ozs of gold were produced in the year 1861,
but the number of tons crushed to obtain it is not now
known, as no account of the claim was then kept by
the proprietors ; if added, however, to the above list,
the general average would not be materially altered,
it having been of much about the same value. The
crushing of December 23, 1863, deserves special no-
tice, it having been taken from below the water-level,
and stone of similar value, in large quantities, is con-
fidently believed to remain. This stone cannot at
present be worked, i.' consequence of the pumping
engine of Messrs Baragwanath and Samuel having
stopped work, pending the revision of the laws relating
to draining. It may here be observed, that consider-
able difficulty has alwajs been experienced in drain-
ing this line ; this arises from the fact of there being
no regular lode through which the water might flow ;
tho blocks which exist along the entire length of tho
line that has been worked, being, in most cases, en-
tirely disconnected, and, consequently, the draining
of one block will have little or no effect on another
that may be on the same level with it. It appears to
he the opinion of most of the old practical miners on
this reef, that the only way that a really effectual
drainage may be obtained, is by frequent cross-cuts,
and pumping at a level considerably below that re-
quired to be worked. The above-mentioned ground
is at tho present time held under lease, having in-
cluded in it the claim, originally known as No. I,
north, Poverty, which claim immediately abuts it on
its eastern boundary.
No. 4, north, has likewise been a claim of con-
siderable importance, but the first proprietors have
long since left the district, an authentic account of
the work then done, is therefore lost; the crushing
machine likewise, that reduced the first stone, has
long been removed; all traces therefore of what the
stone produced up to July, 1863, are gone. Since
that time, the claim has produced the following
results

The above shows an average for the last two years
of a trifle over 11 dwts 11 grs to the ton; but it
must be borne in mind in reference to this claim,
that the above does not, by any means, describe the
average of its total produce, the stone produced
from it at firs't having been by far the richest por-
tion. The first payable stone was obtained at a
depth of about 40 feet. The claim has beem sunk
dowrr to water, and payable stone proved to exist
there; at this level likewise the stone obtained in
No. 3, in December, 1863, -was traced to within six
feet of the southern boundary of the claim, when it
was lost in the water, in consequence of the block,
like all others in this ground, having a northern dip.
In the neighbouring claim north, namely No. 6,
gold was first obtained in January, 1861, at a depth
of 45 feet. For the first year, no regular account
was kept of the crushings, but the proprietors esti-
mate them at 230 tons, with a yield of about 440 ozs.
The most valuable stone that this claim has pro-
duced, was obtained during the first year of its being
worked, the average yield having reached as high
in some cases as 17 ozs to the ton; this stone was
taken from a depth of 100 feet. As in all other
claims on this line, there is no regular lode, but a


succession of blocks, ranging from two up to twenty
feet in thickness. Up to the present time, fifteen of
these blocks have been worked, with the following
result:

The above shows an average of 1 oz 4 dwts 7 grs
to the ton. In the course of working, auriferous
stone has been proved to exist in this claim for
width of one hundred and fifty feet. At the water-
level, namely, at a depth of about one hundred and
thirty feet, a body of stone exists, about twenty feet
in thickness; it was from this lode that the last
three crushings in the above list for the year 1863,
were taken ; a large amount of stone of similar
value still remains, but it will be impossible to ob-
tain it until the claim is properly drained.
la No. 6 north, gold was first discovered at a depth
of 95 feet, but on trial the stone proved worth not
more than about 2 dwts to the ton, this not being
payable prospecting was continued, when another
body of stone was found at a depth of one hundred
and ten feet. This stone has been worked down to a
depth of one hundred and thirty-seven feet, with the
following result:

This shows an average value of a f< action over
7 dwts to the ton. Stone in unlimited quantities,
•worth from 2 up to about 6 dwts to the ton, is known
to exist in this claim ; that at the water level is worth
about 4 dwts to the ton. The stone varies in thick-
ness from five feet up to about eleven feet. Ihe next
claim north is Nos. 7 and 8 amalgamated. In No. 7
four shafts have been sunk, two of them to the water
level. Gild was first discovered at a depth of ninety-
five feet, in April, 1862, since which lime the follow-
ing crushings have been obtained.

«n average yield of a fraction more than 9 dwts 8 gm
to the ton. The different blocks in this ground aver-
age in thickness about four feet. No prospecting has
been done in this claim at a shallower depth than
ninety-five feet. Of the ground known as Ao. 8, no
regular account has been kept, more than is sufficient
to show that gold has been obtained to the amount of
169 ozs 18 dwts 5 grs ; the number of tons of stone
from which this was obtained is not known, an aver-
age value of what the claim has produced, cannot
therefore, be arrived at. In about the middle of the
year 1864, a steam-pumping plant was erected on th:s
claim ; but after working only a week or two opera-
tions were stopped, in consequence of a want of funds.
It stood inactive for some months, when it was sold,,
and moved off to another part of the district; this
w as much to be regretted, as appearances in this claim
at th : water-level point to the extreme probability of
there being first-rate paying stone at deeper levels,
there having been as much as 15 dwts to the dish
washed, at a point not far from where opeiationa
were discontinued. The last claim on this line,
namely, No. 9, north, has had two shafts sunk on it,
both of them to the water-level. In this claim, it ap-
pears there are two distinct lines of stone, from each
of which gold in paying quantities has been obtained.
Gold was first discovered at a depth of a hundred
and twenty-seven feet, in what is known among the
proprietors as the eastern run. The claim has pro-
duced the following crushings; the three first having
been taken from the eastern line :

The above list shows an average of a little more
than 7 dwts H grs to the ton. The removal of the
pumping plant from No. 8, was particularly unfor-
tunate °or this claim, as the best prospects that it has
produced, have been taken from below the water-
level. Stone remains in this claim th it is confidently
believed to bn worth half-an-oun e to the ton ; but
being below water-level it is impossible to obtain it,
as manual lab mr for draining purposes is utterly use-
less. It will bo seen by the foregoing account of this
line, that all the claims have been worked down to
the water-level, at which depth first-rate prospects
present themselves in nearly every instance; the
problem therefore, that now remains to be solved, is,
whether it is better to continue the presovt mode of
working, or one of a more extensive character, by
which, by the aid of powerful steam machinery,
depths may he explored unattainah’e by hand power.
Since the publication of the first edition of the
present history, the claimholders of <he Morning Star
Kesf have given their opinion with respect to the
qnestion in the latter part of the last paragraph, by
bestirring themselves for the formation of a Joint-
Stock Company, for the purpose of efficiently working
their ground. The company is at present but in em-
bryo ; in the event of its being successfully launched,
with proper management it cannot fail in affording a
splendid pr ofit to the shareholder s ; and will aid to a
considerable extent in making the reputation of the
district.


CHAPTER Y.
THE YELDHAM.
(fOEMEELY NEW INGLEWOOD REEF.)
This reef was first taken up under the latter name
in the early part of the year 1861, Messrs J. Ander-
son and G. Oswald being the prospectors. It is
situated two or three hundred yards back in the
scrub, eastward of Dusty Town. Gold was first
obtained on the surface, from an outcrop of stone,
but in very limited quantities, nothing in fact to
induce the belief that it would pay for crushing,
but it was evident that a reef existed there, and a
shaft was accordingly sunk, but no crushing was
attempted uhtil a depth of 150 feet had been reached.
At this level two tons were sent to the mill as a
trial, and produced 4 dwts 9 grs to the ton. The
next trial of four tons was taken from a depth of 80
feet; at this level it was poorer still, yielding only
2 dwts 8 grs to the ton. The shaft was eventually
sunk to a depth of 168 feet. At 163 feet water was
reached, the great influx of which prevented all
further prospecting, and the prospectors’ despair-
ing of getting payable quartzs at a shallower depth*
abandoned it in September 1862, not however before
they had become convinced that a valuable reef
existed at a greater depth. This belief had been
strengthened by having satisfactorily proved, after
considerable trouble by taking bearings with flag
stalls, that the reef was a continuation of the cele-
brated Maxwell’s. This reef was again taken up
in August 1863, this time under the name of the
Yeldham. Gold was again found on the surface
a short distance north of the shafts sunk by the
first holders, a trial crushing of two tons yielded
3oz to the ton. The following list of crushings
were taken from the surface down to a depth of
about 50 feet :

The above stone was taken from a length along
the reef of about thirty feet by a depth, of 50 feet the
average thickness being eighteen inches. tunce the
clearing out of this patch of golden, stone, the experi-
ences of the party who work(d it, appear very much
to match those of the first holders, namely, that a
well defined reef here exists, with only one break
from the surface down to the water, of an average
thickness of nearly three feet, the value of the whole
ranging betu een 2 and 6 dwts to the ton. At water
level the reef is three feet in thickness, with a
tendency to increase in size, its value being 5 dwts
to the ton, its formation is of the most perfect order,
having a sandstone wall on one side, and slate on the
other, the lode has a western underlay, and southern
dip. What this ground may be eastward is not
known, as no driving has been executed. A drive
has been put in to the west a distance of about 80
feet, but the labour was not rewarded by the dis-
covery of fresh stone. The general opinion appears
to be, that it is at a greater depth than has yet been
attained, that the lode will be found that is to pay
for the labour that has been expended on the claim.
A number of claims have been taken up on this line,
both north and south of the prospecting claim, but
all of them are now either abandoned or registered,
no profitable results having accrued from the labour
expended on them.
Towards the end of the year 1865, this ground
was for a second lime abandoned, the OAvners having
arrived at the conclusion that, what they were search-
ing for was too far below water, to be within their
r:ach without the aid of machinery ; but the time


is doubtless not far distant when by the aid of &
steam pumping plant, this reef will take its place
among the established and paying lines of the
district.
Chapter YI.
THE COLUMBIAN REEP.
The far-famed Columbian, the reef that above all
others, made many of us for a time break the tenth
commandment, now claims our attention. The pros-
pecting claim, and No. 1, north, were marked out on
30th of November, 1859, by Messrs Heron, Wright,
Wheeler, and St. John, who, after a long unsuccessful
career in alluvial mining, were crossing the scrub, in
search of a fresh field for their labour, when they ac-
cidentally discovered gold in a reef, cropping out from
the surface. For some months they were unsuccess-
ful, the quartz was poor, and the writer well remem-
bers the whole of No. 1, north, being oifered for sale
by the proprietors for £5O. This claim was jumped
by a party of Germans, just as rich quartz was dis-
covered in the prospect claim, the jumpers were
ejected, the rightful owners took possession of their
property, followed up the discovery made in the
prospect claim, into the claim they had recovered
possession of, and ultimately obtained the following
magnificent result from the two claims together.

The average value of the stone produced from
this claim cannot be given, as in many instances the
number of tons crushed was not kept an account
of, but it is beyond a doubt the highest by far that
has been produced from any claim in the district;
in the eight crushings where the account of the num •
her of tons has been preserved, an average value is
seen of over ozs to the ton. The total produce
of the claim has realised the large amount of
£66,348 4s.
The following details of the workings of these two
claims have been already published in Dicker s Mi-
ning Record, the correctness of which is guaranteed
by Mr Wright, one of the shareholders '. —“ 4 his line
of reef has proved for a time, one of the most produc-
tive lodes in the colony, and attracted considerable
attention by its turning out, rather more than two
years ago, a cake of amalgamated gold, weighing no
loss than 2,313 ozs, the produce of only 22 tons of
stone. The grant of the prospecting claim was ob-
tained on the last day of November, 1859, and the
first crushing from the surface, gave aoout 6 ozs to
the ton. It proved to be merely a disconnected spur,
and following north, it ran out at a depth of about
twelve feet. The uext claim, known as No, 1, north.


flunk a shaft forty feet in depth, and by cross-cutting,
struck a large body of auriferous stone, that did not
prove very remunerative. The latter claim was then
registered for three months, but, before the expiration
of that period, the prospecting claim had met with
another body of stone cropping out on the surface, a
little distance west of the first leader they worked.
It took something of the form of a wedge, the small
end only projecting into the prospecting claim. It
dipped north, and underlaid east, and in No. 1, it ran
out at a depth of fifty feet, at the south end, and at
the north end of the same claim, at ninety feet. The
lower portion of the lode, where it had terminated,
had almost the appearance of black slag. No. 1 sunk
a shaft on their south boundary, to a depth of about
twenty-four feet, to intersect the lode, and the first
ton gave a return of 274 ozs Another shaft of about
twenty feet to the north was then put down, and
the next 22 tons, taken out from between the two,
yielded the monster cake of gold already referred
to. The next 80 tons, gave an average of 50 ozs to
the ton. Some of the richest stone was taken from
spurs underlying west, and running into the larger
body, although not extending any very great dis-
tance from it. As it went north, the lode increased
in thickness, with a proportionately diminished
yield, for the most part not less than 10 ozs to the
ton, and even at the thickest portion, (ten feet,)
giving 6 ozs to the ton. On the prospecting claim,
a shaft has been sunk, to a depth of two hundred
and eighty-four feet, and a cross-cut has been driven
east, one hundred and twenty-five feet, without any
important results having been attained. The ex-
penditure in these two claims, would be altogether
about £4,000, One dividend declared amounted to
£3,265 16s 5d per fourth share, the largest, it is
imagined, ever declared in the colony.
The block of stone that proved so rick in No. 1,
was very soon traced into Nos. 2,3, and 4, but di-
minishing in value as it ran on northward, the
average of the yield in No. 2, being rather more
than 4 ozs 2 dwts, and that of No. 3, a trifle over


3 oz 9 to the ton. The Inglewood Advertiser of Jan-
uary 24th, 1862, in a report of No. 2, north, gives
the yield as 10,068 ozs of gold, the produce of 1,413
tons of stone. This statement is incorrect, both as
to the number of tons, and the amount of gold pro-
duced. The following returns are taken from the
books of the company, in the possession of T. K.
Johnston, Esq., Bank of New South Wales, the
correctness of which have been vouched for, by Mr
J. Kirwan, one of the shareholders.

Showing an average of nearly 3 ozs 2 dwts to tho
In addition to the above returns, Mons. Combat
furnished the following particulars. The claim was
purchased by himself and C. Davey, about a month
before the valuable discoveries were made in the
prospecting claim, for the sum of £l5 ; five months
after the purchase, they obtained payable gold. The
best stone has been obtained at a depth of about
one hundred feet; sinking has been carried on to
depth of two hundred and forty feet, which was
found to be the water-level; the reef at this depth
is two feet in thickness, but the formation of the
lode is so perfect, and well defined, that the belief is
confidently entertained, that valuable discoveries
•will be made at a greater depth. Prospecting in
this claim has shown the reef to vary in thickness
from two to twelve feet; in the parts that have been
■worked the stone has been taken out from one end
of the claim to the other, and it is confidently as-
serted, that many thousands of tons of stone still
remain, worth certainly not less than from four to
nine pennyweights to the ton.
The returns of No. 5, north, as given by Mr
Lyons, one of the shareholders, are as follows
Giving an average of a fraction over 13 dwts 7 grs
to the ton.
Gold has likewise been obtained on this reef in
Nos. 6,7, and 8, but the amount in the aggregate
has not, it is supposed, paid the expenses of work-
ing. No accounts that can be relied upon are ap-
parently obtainable, further than that quartz worth


2 ozi to the ton has been obtained in various parts
of the three claims. The following particulars re-
lating to this portion of the reef, are taken from a
report of J. S. Robertson, Esq., Mining Surveyor
for Inglewood :—“The quartz lode in No. 6, north,
is twelve feet in width, and the last results obtained
prior to being compelled to register, on account of
the water, averaged near 2 ozs to the ton. The
width of the reef in the various claims varies from
four to twelve feet. The ground north of No. 6 has
not been proved, in fact, unless steam pumping ma-
chinery is employed, it will be impossible to test the
value of the same. Hitherto the whole of the
claims have been worked by hand and horse labour,
and have reached the water-level, but in my opinion
the stone that is known to exist in this ground wdll
ultimately be found to be a continuation of the rich
lode already worked in the claims farther south.
The water-level averages in depth, (in proportion to
the rise of the hill,) about 240 feet." In closing
the account of this celebrated reef, it may be ob-
served that it was mainly owing to the great disco-
veries made on it in 1860, that that impetus was
given to quartz mining ‘on Inglewood, the result of
which has been the discovery and opening up of
many of those reefs which have made the district
famous.
After the result already described had been ob-
tained, the whole line remained for a considerable time
in a state of complete inactivity. Towards the end of
the year 1864, the prospectus of the Great Columbian
Reef Gold Mining Company was issued. Eor a time all
went “ merry as a marriage bell; ” shares were taken
up with avidity, and everything pointed to the
probability of the Company being a great success;
but mismanagement for a time has stopped the pro-
gress of what may reasonably be supposed to be,
from the character of the reef—one of the most
promising mining speculations in the district. An
old, in fact a worn out plant of machinery was
purchased and re-erected ; a proceeding, according to
the statement of the engineer, who was sent to report


on the machine, in direct opposition to his advice ; and
the consequence was, that when the time came fox-
commencing work, the plant was found to be useless
and unworkable, and the result was, that operations
were brought to a dead stand. Meetings were held
on various occasions, to take into consideration tbo
position of the Company; at one of which, held on
December 14, 1865, the directory, from whose mis-
management so much evil had resulted, according to
the wish of the shareholders consented to resign, and
a fresh one was elected. Up to the present time, the
new directory has not commenced operations : they
doubtless, at starting, will find, they labour under a
great disadvantage ; the fact of their predecessors in
office having uselessly squandered something like
five or six thousand pounds not being the least. But
one great and important fact still remains for their
satisfaction, namely, that the sanje confidence is felt
now in the value of the miue as ever existed;
as, why should it not? beyond slabbing a shaft,
and raising a few tons of stone, a small portion only
of which has been crushed, the mine remains in the
same condition as when the company was firs:
formed in 1864. Barring the loss, then, occasioned
by the late mismanagement, the present directory
are the guardians of as good a speculation, as their
predecessors were when the company was firs’:
formed. It is'by adversity and trouble, that wisdom
and experience are often acquired. It is to be hoped
that the late disastrous events which have tended
to temporarily paralyze the Great Columbian Beef
Gold Mining Company will be the means of show-
ing the vital folly of appointing men to transact im -
portant mining business, merely upon the strength
of their supposed respectability ; the same men,
from ignorance of the nature of the business they
take in hand, being totally unfit for it.


Chapter VII.
euchanan’s reef.
This once celebrated reef was discovered on the
23rd of February, 1860, by Mr Robert Buchanan,
who marked out a prospecting claim of 180 feet, in
conjunction with Messrs H. Brown, T. Purdon, and
T. Brown. There was a good out-crop of stone
along the whole of the crown of the hill, and Mr
Buchanan, on the day of marking the claim, ob-
tained good specimens from it, from one end to the
other. On opening the ground, it was found to be
a well-formed body of stone, 2 feet in thickness ; it
gradually increased in size, down to a depth of 40
feet, where it was 9 feet in thickness, when it began
to decrease, until, at about the depth of 80 feet, it
had resumed the same proportions as on the surface,
thus forming a complete diamond in shape; at 87
feet it ran out.
From this body of stone a very large amount of
gold was obtained. Unfortunately, it is not possible
to give an account of the various crushings in de-
tail, as it appears that Mr Buchanan destroyed his
account books before leaving the district, imagining,
it is supposed, that they were useless, but from
fragments of these books found in his tent after his
departure, it has been ascertained beyond a doubt,
that the first three crushings, consisting of 121 tons,
produced 557 ozs 16 dwts of gold, being rather more
than an average of 4 ozs 12 dwts 4 grs to the ton.
An inspection of the claim, has shown that the
whole of this block has been removed, there being
a clear opening, the whole length, from the surface,
down to the depth of 87 feet. The above men-
tioned block ran out like a wedge, at the southern
boundary of the prospecting claim, the clearing out
of the last of it, produced 2 ozs 10 dwts per ton - r
the underlay of this stone was westward. On sink-
ing a few feet, a new making was found, but the

dwts 12 grs, from
direction, of the underlay was now reversed; the
new formation uas known as “the black reef,” from
the colour of the stone. It is, apparently ot great
size, and has been worked into about 12 feet, but
the opposite side from that worked has never been
seen, as, after crushing 4 tons, the prospectors left
it, the proceeds being under an ounce. Another
shaft was then sunk, about 60 feet westward of the
old workings, to a depth of 120 feet, a drive was
put in, and at about half way between the two
shafts, a body of stone was struck 8 feet in width ;
a trial crushing of 4 tons proved this stone to be of
similar value to the stone in the second making in
the old workings, and it has ever since undergone a
similar fate, namely, desertion. The western shaft
has been sunk to a depth of 190 feet, and strange to
say, this is all the attention that this claim, (once,
one of the most important in the district,) has ever
since received. In No. 1, north, a continuation of
the surface stone obtained in the prospecting claim,
proved of nearly equal value. In this claim, it was
all cleared out, to a depth of 58 feet, with results
eminently satisfactory to the shareholders. At this
depth it ran out, as it had done in the prospecting
claim, but made again at 74 feet. The new making
in this claim, likewise proved payable, and it has
been worked down to a depth of 100 feet, with a
result from the two blocks together as follows—the
list is not quite complete, but very nearly so—


781 tons, showing an average of nearly 1 oz 10 dwts
11 gra to the ton.
The correspondent of the Melbourne Argus , in a
report of this claim in 1862, states that—“ln sink-
ing the shaft as much quartz was obtained without
driving as gave a return of £4,000.” One of the
original proprietors is still a shareholder, and on
questioning him with respect to the truth of this
statement, he gave it a flat contradiction. L'he
present opportunity is therefore taken to correct
this error. In this, as in the prospecting claim, the
same want of enterprise and energy is apparent.
Although the claim has produced thousands of
pounds worth of gold, there it remains, with no
more work having been done in it than the mere
extraction of the stone that was known to be valu-
able. In this likewise, as in the prospecting claim,
a prodigious amount of stone is left, that would
give a return of a quarter of an ounce to the ton.
It may seem almost incredible, but the proprietors
•state that no driving whatever has been done in
this claim, what the western block in the prospect-
ng claim may be in this, remains, therefore, for fu-
ture enterprise to prove.
In No. 2, north, payable stone was first struck at
a depth of 75 feet, the lode was subsequently proved
to be the same as the second making in No. 1 ; the
surface lede which had proved so rich in the pros-
pecting claim and No. 1, became both smaller and
poorer in this. The stone struck at 75 feet remained
payable to a depth of 195 feet, at which level the
last crushing produced 9 dwts to the ton; at 120
feet there is a clear opening from the north end of
this claim to the southern boundary of that marked
out by the prospectors. It is much to be regretted
that no correct detailed account of the yields of this
claim has been preserved, but the following list of
amounts, copied from brokers’ tickets for the sale of
gold, although no: by any means all, are still suffi-
cient to show the valuable character oi the quartz
extracted :

No. 3, north, has not, up to the present time,
proved payable. There is an unlimited amount of
stone which has only been prospected to but a very
limited extent. On this claim there is a magnificent
double shaft 216 feet in depth, slabbed in first-rate
style to the bottom ; but, as in all the other claims
on this reef, little or no driving has been done.
Payable quartz has been obtained in No. 2 to with-
in twenty feet of the southern boundary of this
claim.
Of the ground south of the prospecting claim, little
is known. In No. 1 a shaft was sunk 125 feet, when
a reef was found two feet in thickness, which on being
tried, proved worth 6 dwts 7 grs to the ton, and this
not being, it is supposed, up to the expectations of the
shareholders, it was abandoned, and the claim at the
present time, remains just as they left it. In No. 3,
work was not prosecuted sufficiently long even to find
stone. The water level averages according to the rise
of the hill 125 feet. The second stage in the history
of this reef yet remains to be sketched. On the 26th
of May, 1862, a body of shareholders held their first
meeting to transact business under the title of Bu-
chanan’s Reef Company. At this meeting a resolu-
tion was passed to the effect that a lease of five acres
be applied for, the said lease to commence with No. 1,
north, and proceed on south ; and at subsequent meet-
ings it was further agreed to erect a crushing and
pumping plant, at the cost of £1694. These resolu-
tions were fully carried out, and thus was started a
company with apparently as bright a prospect before
them as could have been wished, but the result would
almost lead to the supposition, that some evil genius
in this case had had the disposal of events, for in the
short space of rather less than a year, the whole affair
was pronounced a most miserable failure. Since that


time grass has been allowed to grow on Buchanan’s
Reef, and the goats remain in undisturbed possession.
But an examination of the company’s ledger and mi-
nute-book, somewhat solves the mystery, (for a mys-
tery the failure of this company undoubtedly has
been.) For instance, it appears that during the whole
time the company were in operation, they crushed
little more than 700 tons of stone, and this was ef-
fected at a cost for crushing alone of £712, and a fur-
ther examination of accounts, shows that for thirty
weeks, the average weekly expenses of the engine
were £l4 8s lid, while those of the claim, were only
£l2 14s 4d, that is to say, five acres of ground, that
had the reputation of holding unbounded riches, were
held, and worked, by three men and a horse, and this
ground having on it, at tho same time, one of the best
crushing and pumping plants in the district. With
management such as these figures show to have ex-
isted, the wonder might have, indeed, been great, had
the company achieved success. The average value of
the quartz crushed by them, is not, however, further
known than that it ranged between a \ and | an oz to
the ton, amply sufficient to have made it pay, by good
management. One other fact, with respect to the
operations of the company, is, to say the least, rather
strange, namely, that although in possession of a first-
rate pumping plant, the ground was not tried a single
foot deeper than it was when they came into posses-
sion, and this too, in the face of the fact of having
had a crushing from the deepest workings in No. 2,
of 9 dwts to the ton. At last, disgusted with the
state of things, the shareholders caused the music of
the stamps to stop, and eventually sold off the whole
concern, at a ruinous sacrifice. Subsequently an
attempt was made to form a fresh company, but the
effort to carry the project through,proved unsuccess-
ful. It is not the intention in this history to predict
the success or otherwise of projected mining spe-
culations but the following concluding observations
in the present instance, are not considered out of
place. The visitor to this reef, on being showm


over the ground by the lirst shareholders, some of
whom are still residents on the spot, cannot fail to
be struck by the want of enterprise that has been
shown in working it from one end to the other.
The nature and extent of the work done, forcibly
reminds him of the days, when men dug holes and
abandoned them, if, when upon imperfectly bottom-
ing, a trial of a dishful did not present the dazzling
spectacle of a row of nuggets for the result. Many
of these holes left with egg-shaped bottoms, have
since produced fortunes to the moderately indus-
trious miner, and the probabilities are greatly in fa-
vour of this reef in like manner, at some future pe-
riod showering fortune’s favours upon those who
are enterprising and industrious enough to seek
them.
Chapter IX.
THE AMERICAN KEEP.
The reef bearing the above name is situated about
two hundred yards west of the Buchanan’s Beef, and
was discovered about the same time by two brothers
named Cook. Although a very considerable amount
of work has been done on this line, there is very little
really authentic information obtainable respecting it,
all operations having ceased for some time, and most
of the working owners having left the district, the
prospectors’ being of the number. The history of this
reef will consequently be but a meagre one, as it is not
the intention to record anything the authenticity of
which cannot thoroughly be relied on. Of the pros-
pecting claim, the most interesting fact in connection
with it is, the existence of what is known as a cross


worth more than a few pennyweights to the ton. The
value of the ground south, as far' as No. 7, corres-
ponds very much with that of the north, but in No. 7
some very rich stone was found. It was first dis-
covered at a depth of 75 feet in a leader eighteen
inches in thickness, A trial crushing from it gave
a result of | oz. to the ton. The stone was then
worked up-wards to within 40 feet from the surface,
the stone taken out averaged about 5 ozs to the ton ;
from this level to the surface the value of the stone
52
. reef, that is two reefs, the one intersecting the other.
It was immediately at the point of intersection that
the large yields were obtained, that made this claim
at the time of its being worked ore of the most cele-
brated in the district, the first 25 tons ciushcd from
it giving a yield of 276 ounces. ; This cross has been
worked down to the water level, paying splendidly
the whole of the way down. The gross yield is not
.known, but it is certain that it amounted to something
considerable. - One more statement with respect to
this claim may prove interesting to future operators
on this line. Messrs Cook and Co,, always asserted
that they lelt in the water, stone of equal value to
anything they had taken out above, and certainly, the
result of their last crushing at water Jevel bore them
out in the statement, it having been nearly a pound
weight of gold to the ton. '1 he stone in this claim
off the cross is poor, not being worth more than from
3 dwts to 5 dwts to the ton, but of this there is an
almost unlimited amount. In the ground north of
the prospecting claim the reef has been traced to a
considerable distance, but none of the claims ever
paid for the work expended on them. Gold has been
obtained in every claim to No. 9, and stone in large
quantities discovered, but in no instance has it been
mas reduced considerably, some oi it giving hoM r ever
as much as 3 ozs to the ton. The abovcmentiond
leader was one of a good perfect formation, having a
slate wall on the west, and sandstone on the east. The
dip was south, and the underlay east. The average
thicknesss from the surface down to a depth of 80
feet was about 1 foot. At the last mentioned depth


it was found to run out. A. detailed account of the
yield of the stone above alluded to cannot bo given, as
accounts were but imperfectly kept, but it is estimated
by one who was then a shareholder, and who still
lives in the district, to have been about 70 tons yield,
ing gold that produced cash to the amount of about
£6OO. This claim had been sunk on down to 30 feet
below the -water level, at which depth stone showing
gold was again discovered, but the proportions of the
lode were still small, not being more than eighteen
inches in thickness, and not sufficiently rich to en-
duce the prospectors to work it. This claim was
abandoned by its first holders before they had held
it twelve months. It may here be observed that up
to the time of the first abandonment of this ground*
no prospecting in the shape of cross-cutting had been
performed beyond one drive of not more than 20 feet
to the east; of the value of the grouvd westward,
therefore, of course nothing is known. Subsequently
this claim was again taken possession of and some
12 or 14 ounces ef gold obtained, it was then for a
second time deserted without, it is considered, having
had any work done on it to call for any particular
mention.
Following on southward is another stretch of
ground, the value of which is reported by old resi-
dents to be about equal to that between the pros-
pecting claim and No. 7. The next ground south-
ward, of which anything definite is known, is what
is called the southern prospecting claim. The stone
here cropped out of the surface, and gave in some
instances as much as 3 ozs to the ton. The stone
run out at about the depth of 50 feet, but makes
again and continues to water-level —namely, 120
feet. The reef from the surface down to that depth
averages 10 feet in thickness, the value of the whole
having been proved to be 4 dwts to the ton. This
would seem to present a splendid opportunity for
operations on a large scale, but the first owners had
to abandon it, the cost of crushing and carting ab-
sorbing nearly the whole yield. Stone of this va-
lue could, however, now be worked with profit, the


cost of crushing being at the present time not more
than half what it >vas when the abandonment above
spoken of took place. Prospecting has been carried
on southward of the last mentioned ground, a dis-
tance of two or three hundi ed feet; but although
the course of the reef has been traced, nothing
payable has been found. The ground opened up,
and through which the reef has been traced, would
measure from north to south a distance of nearly
one thousand yards. It is much to be regretted
that ground of such a promising character as the
above should remain unworked, but such has been
the case in the present instance, for a very long
time. The whole of the line, as far as it has been
opened up, is held under lease ; it is one more ex-
ample of that pernicious and crying evil so preva-
lent in this district, of large tracts of auriferous
land being held unworked in the grasp of the specu-
lator, to the exclusion of numbers -who might de-
rive from it a living, if not a competence. This
class of lessees of auriferous lands, as they now
exist, are a curse and an obstruction to the progress
of a mining district; and the sooner associations
are formed to compel them to employ labour in ac-
cordance with the terms of their application for the
lease, the better for the welfare of all concerned.
It appears that there is some chance that the lease
under which the American and Buchanan’s E-eefs
is held, will -soon fall into fresh hands. In the event
of the ground having fresh holders, the district and
new lessees may both very fairly be congratulated,
providing always, that the new occupiers are'men
who will honestly work the mine; for then they
will not only stand a chance of enriching them-
selves, but the district at large will be greatly bene-
fited by the regular employment of a number of
miners. Before closing the account of this
line, one more item of information may be adduced
for the encouragement of future prospectors. In
November, 186-5, an old shaft was taken possession
of, that had been sunk j ust outside of the northern
boundary of the leased ground, a short distance


east of what is supposed to be the “American’*
line. After working a short time, a reef was proved
to exist below the water-level, from which pros-
pects can be obtained, equal to from l£ oz to 2 ozs
to the ton. At the present time of writing, pros-
pecting is being carried on ten feet above the water, at
which level the lode is eight feet in thickness, and
presents the appearance of being worth about 6 dwts
to the ton, the stone being of a most promising
character.
THE NIL DESPERANDUM
Is situated on a gentle rise of ground, about raid-
way between the Buchanan’s and American Reefs»
where some beautiful specimens were found in the
early part of the year 1860. A number of claims
were marked out for the purpose of prospecting for a
reef. In the prospecting claim a small surface block
was discovered, extending to a length of 20 or 30 feet,
running out at about the depth of 12 feet. This block
did not average more than a couple of feet in thick-
ness, it was all taken out and crushed, producing about
an ounce to the ton. After the above mentioned
block was removed, a shaft was sunk to a depth of
about fifty feet, but nothing further of any impor-
tance was discovered; Shafts were also sunk on
about half-a-dozen neighbouring claims, but as
nothing of an encouraging character presented it-
self, the ground was abandoned. This ground is
included in the same lease, as that by which the
American and Buchanan’s Reefs is held.


Chapter IX.
THE BENDIGO REEF.
Of the reefs westward of the town, the next that
comes under notice is the Bendigo. This line is
situated about 100 yards eastward of the northern
claims of the “ March,” and is in like manner sure
reunded by the alluvial workings of Potter’s Hill-
The proprietors of this reef, Messrs Farrow, Everett,
Mumfotd and Flyn, commenced operations as far
back as October, 1860, their attention having been
attracted to the spot by the nature of the gold found
on Potter’s Hill, it having been of an exceedingly
ragged character, and intermixed with a large pro-
portion of specimens. Work was commenced by
sinking a shaft a depth of 60 feet, at which level it
was driven eastward 60 feet. A second shaft was
then sunk, likewise to a depth of 60 feet, and a drive
put in westward 20 feet, which connected it with
shaft No. 1. This work revealed nothing of impor-
tance. After this a drive 135 feet in length was put
in to the west at the 60 foot level in the first shaft ;
at about midway a leader about three or four inches
in thickness was found, which on trial proved worth
about 5 dwts to the ton. This stone for the time
was passed over as being too small to pay ; the drive
then to the end presented a succession of leaders,
varying in thickness from a few inches, to a foot, all
of which gave gold to a certain extent, but not suf-
ficient to make it payable without the aid of ma-
chinery. At the expiration of nine months, not
having met with anything payable, the claim was
registered. During the period of registration, the
owners of the claim fossicked about in the alluvial
on the same ground, and in the course of their work
fell across a patch of stone on the alluvial bottom,
from which splendid specimens wer e obtained, and
3 or 4 dwts to the dish was washed, but the stone was
not permanent, it running out to mere threads at a

depth of 6or 6 feet. Ten tons of atone from this spot
gave II dwts to the ton, for which a prospecting
claim was obtained, the grant bearing date October,
1861. About twelve months after obtaining the grant,
and after a variety of work had been gone through,
it was determined to go back to the spot where opera-
sions were first commenced, for the purpose of further
testing the value of the leader from which the crush-
ing of 5 dwts to the ton had been obtained. In fur-
therance of this project a fresh shaft was commenced
about 70 feet westward of the second shaft; the leader
it will be remembered, was found about midway, in
its 135 feet west drive. On further prospecting this
leader, it was found to make wider, and some fair
payable stone was obtained from it. It would bo
wearisome to the reader to describe all the drives,
blind shafts, &c., in this claim ; over 2,000 feet of this
kind of work bear testation of the perseverance and
energy of the proprietors. All this work has gone to
prove the existence of largo quantities of stone, worth
3or 4 dwts to the ton. Stone of this character, if
worked without the aid of machinery, and 10s or Ila
per ton paid for crushing, is, of course, of no value to
the owners. This is the case in the present instance,
but a time is doubtless near at hand when stone of
this description will be so worked so as to yield a
handsome profit to those engaged in it. The following
list of crushings have been obtained from various
parts of the claim, anl a glance at it will be sufficient
to show with tolerable clearness the nature and value
of the ground.

The above yield shows an average of rather over 5|
dwts to the ton for the whole of the stone that has
been crushed from the claim. The gold realized in
cash the sum of £506 Is; the expenses of the claim f
including carting, crushing, tools, powder, candles.
&c., amounted to £266 8s 1 Id, deduct this from the
gross receipts, leaves £239 12s Id, or £5O 18s, net
profit for each fourth share. In No. 1, south, a pro-
digious amount of prospecting has been done. In the
course of two years—during which time work was
vigorously prosecuted—over 2,000 feet of sinking and
driving was executed. In the course of this work 4
shafts were sunk, in most of which a depth of 150
feet was reached, this at the time the w’ork was done
was the water-level, but the pumps working on the
March Reef have considerably drained this ground.
The above-mentioned four shafts have been cross-cut
a distance of 200 feet at several levels, and gold-bear-
ing stone has been proved to exist in considerable
quantities, from which crushings at various times
have been obtained, some of which were of very
tolerable value, whilst other lots were not worth
more than 3 dwts to the ton. A correct account of


these crushings has not been kept, but the share-
holders from, memory estimate them in the gross at
about 100 tons, giving a yield of 50 ozs. No regu-
lar lode has been discovered, the stone existing in a
succession of blocks, the last one reached is at the
level of the greatest depth attained, viz., 150 feet.
This body of stone is about 5 feet in thickness, and
will give a yield of about 3 dwts to the ton ; stone of
a similar value in large quantities is known to exist
in various other parts of this claim. The above-
mentioned claims are the only two in which work of
any importance has been done, ground has been
marked out further south, and likewise further north
of the prospectors, but the work has been of but a
superficial character, and has long been abandoned.
It appears to be the opinion of almost every man who
has worked on this line, that a lode of extensive pro-
portions exists in this ground at a depth hitherto un-
explored, to effectually carry on the work necessary
for its discovery, machinery would be required, the
obtaining of which has not been within the reach of
those who have hitherto held the ground. At present
the whole of the claims on this live appear to be beg-
ging for owners ; for the sake of the benefit of the
town it is to be hoped that they will not long beg in
vain,

Chapter X.
THE LEICESTER REEF.
The prospecting claim in the above-named reef
was marked out in the early part of July, 1861, by
Messrs Henderson, Hunt, Reading, and Waverly,
their attention having been drawn to the spot for a
reef, in consequence of their finding good speci-
mens whilst working the alluvial close by. The
reef was discovered at the bottom of alluvial 7 feet
in depth, and good payable stone was found at the
very commencement, a trial of 3 tons giving a re-
turn of 5 ozs 3 dwts 12 grs. This lode of stone has
been worked to a depth of 135 feet, by a length
along the line of 150 feet, the southern end being
the portion of the claim remaining unworked. The
stone has continued perfect and unbroken down to
a depth of 150 feet, averaging in thickness for the
whole distance between 7 and 8 feet, giving the for-
tunate holders the following magnificent list of
crushings. The account is furnished by Mr Gr.
Henderson, who guarantees the correctness of it.

This shows an average of nearly 1 oz to the ton,
for all the stone taken from this claim, from the
commencement up to the present time. Beyond the
work necessarily entailed by the temqval of the
above-mentioned stone, little has been done in the
ground. It has been driven a distance of about' 60
feet, but no stone beyond that worked has been
found. The water-level has not been reached, 150
feet being the deepest point gained. At this depth
the stone Was not considered payable, and it was,
in consequence, registered for three months, the
term of which has not y.et quite expired.
The above comprised the history of the prospect-
ing claim, up to the time of the publication of the
present history, namely, January, 1865 ; since that
time the claim has changed owners. Since the new
proprietor* have been in possession,- the ground ap-
pears to hate been worked very imperfectly. Two or
three hundred ounces of gold* obtained from about
as many tons of stone, got apparently by a sort of
groping about in the old workings, appears to be all
that has been done in the claim for the whole of the
past year, at the present time work being entirely
suspended. In fact, such’is the dilatory manner in
which work is carried on in this once Hch claim,
that nothing more is known of it than Messrs Hen-
derson and Co., the former owners, were acquainted
with, last September twelvemonth.
No. 1, north, held by G. North and Co., has
likewise been a very good claim. The reef was first


struck at a depth, of 114 feet, when three small
crushings were obtained, which gave an average of
1 oz 3 dvvts to the ton, but the-next crushing gave
a return of only 18 grs to the ton. Efforts were
then made to discover something fresh, but sinking
and driving to the extent of hbout 200 feet failed to
produce the desired result. Work was then re-
commenced in the old shaft, and the reef was fol-
lowed down to a depth of 145 feet, when good pay-
able stone was again obtained, a crushing from this
part of 25 tons, giving 76 ozs 1 dwt 12 grs of gold.
The stone was then systematically worked, with
the folio-wing very profitable results. The account
has been furnished by Mr G-. North.

Jn the above account, the number of tons for the
third and seventh crushings are not known, but
they are believed to be about thirty, if this number
therefore, be added, an average will be shown of
nearly 17 dwts to the ton, for the whole amount
©rushed. The whole of the expenses incurred, in-
cluding carting, crushing, candles,- ironmongery,
,&c., have amounted to £l,lOO, deduct this from the
gross cash proceeds, an d a clear net return to each
fourth working shareholder is shown of a little over
£B4O. In this claim, the reef, which has an extra-
ordinarily acute underlay, dips to the north some-
times very sharply. The stone averages about
twelve feet in thickness ; sinking has been prose-
cuted to a depth of 170 feet, which was found to be
the water-level. At the present time, operations are
suspended, the claim being registered.
No. 3, north, has had a considerable amount of
work done, but has not hitherto proved a paying
claim. In July, 1563, a crushing was obtained of
41 tons, which gave 20 ozs of gold. In this claim,
a considerable body of stone has been discovered
about 80 feet westward of the main line, from which
a number of crushings have been obtained at va-
rious levels, from the surface down to 175 feet,
which have given returns ranging between 4| dwts
and 10 dwts to the ton. An unlimited amount of
this stone still remains in this claim. Nos. 2,3, 4,
6, and 6, comprising a stretch of 666 feet of reef, are
at the present time held under lease by Messrs
Johnson, North, Radcliffe, Spence, Olerhead, and
J. P. Gray.
Nos. 1 and 2, south, amalgamated claims, have
sunk two shafts, one of them (the southern) having
reached -water. This claim has not produced more
than about 30 ozs of gold; 6 ozs of this was ob-
tained from a small surface leader, and the principal
portion of the remainder from stone at the water-
level, the last crushing of 16£ tons giving llj dwts
to the ton. The lode that this crushing was ob-
tained from, is front S to 10 feet in thickness, a good
prospect, therefore, lays before the proprietors of


this ground, as when pumping machinery is erected,
enabling them to work at a greater depth, the claim
can, scarcely fail to prove a valuable one.
No. 3, south, has sunk two shafts and penetrated
to water-level, namely, 160 feet. In this claim the
reef is 8 feet in width, from which 300 tons of stone
have been removed from various levels, giving in
all 100 ozs of gold. This claim was abandoned by
the party that produced the above results about 18
months ago, but has since been taken up again, but
Avork appears to be carried on in a A r ery languishing
style, in fact, it may be said that operations on this
reef are in a state of suspension from one end to the
other. All claims that have produced, gold have
•been worked doAvn to water, and the proprietors at
the present time appear to be waiting for the erec-
tion of a pumping plant to enable them to explore
the reef at a.greater depth.
The above comprised the history of this ground,
up to the time of the first publication of the present
Avork. Since that time no work of any importance
lias been done ; a few small lots have been crushed
from the old Avorkingsof No. 1 North, but the result
was such as not to materially alter the average value
of the total yield of the claim. The lease by which
£fos. 2,3,4,>5,and 6, north was held,became forfeited,
and a fresh one was obtained by Messrs Radcliffe,
Spence, and J. P. Gray, including in it No. 1, the
intention of the proprietors being to form a Joint-
Stock Company, for the purpose of properly work-
ing it. The formation of a Joint-Stock Company
in the present instance i$ doubtless a right and ju-
dicious course, the ground containing stone in
almost unlimited quantities, that by the aid
of good machinery and proper management can-
not fdil in producing a profitable return to in-
vestors in the enterprise. On revieAving the cir-
cumstances of the earlier part of the career of this
line, the question might very naturally be asked—
How is it that ground that has produced such
splendid results has been allowed to remain almost
in a state of total inactivity for nearly a year and a


half ? It is a question, that has puzzled many in this
district; the only solution that can be offered by
the present writer, is, want of capital for obtaining
the necessary appliances for working and draining
the ground. For the sake of the district it is to be
hoped that this want will not much longer be ex-
perienced, but that very shortly the same busy
scene may be witnessed on this line, and the same
profits accruing, as in the earlier time of its working.
THE MARCH REEF,
The tract of ground that forms the western boun-
dary of the town now claims attention. Here is to be
found the most complete network of reefs in the dis-
trict, some of which have materially tended to establish
the fame of Inglewood as a first class quartz produc-
ing district. Conspicuous among them is that bear-
ing the name that appears at the head of this chapter,
The March Reef did not always bear its present name,
its first title, it is believed, was that.of the “ Prince
Arthur.” It was afterwards taken up by two brothers
named Hunter, and during their occupancy it was
known as Hunter’s Reef; but their operations were
unimportant and unproductive of profitable results*
and it was very soon for a second time abandoned. 11
eventually attracted the notice of Messrs. Smith,
Jewell, Bimey, and Dahl, who, after prospecting on
this line for a very considerable distance, eventually
settled down on the ground they at present occupy
in March, 1862. The claim was originally a pros-
pecting claim of 250 feet, but the tenure upon which
the ground was held was subsequently changed, and


it is now held under lease. Good gold-bearing stone
was found about two weeks after work was com'-
menced, in a small leader about 2 inches in thickness j
at 40 feet from the surface. On following this stone
it was found to increase in size southward, and
ou 27th March, 1862, the first 2| tons of stone that
were obtained from it on being sent to the mill pror
duced I 3 ozs 19 dwts 6 grs. The lode was found at
a greater depth to split up, the one side underlaying
west and the other cast; the western stone being
that from which the greater portion of the riches
yielded by this claim were produced. The lode has
been worked at various levels, from 40 down to nearly
200 feet with the following brilliant result.

This shows a fraction oyer an ounce and three
pennyweights to the ton, for the entire produce of tho
claim. The lode has been worked in widths varying
from 12 to 25 feet. A few months’ after payable
stone was obtained in this claim, the hand labour
■was supplemented by a whim, but as greater depths
were reached this power was found to be insufficient,
especially with respect to the water, the level .of
which was found to be at first 130 feet ; and in tho
early part of the year 1864, steam crushing and pump-
ing machinery was erected. This machinery consists
of a horizontal engine of about twenty horse nominal,
but cap.able of working up to a much greater power ;
two batteries of stampers, each containing six revolv-
ing heads, and three pumps, one for draining the
mine, another for supplying tho crashing batteries,
and a third for conveying the tailings into a shoot, by
which without further trouble they are carried to a
considerable distance clear of the machine. For some
time after the erection of tho machinery the quart*
was raised by aid of a whim, but it was subsequently
resolved to enlist tho services of the iron hone for
this purpose likewise ; and on Feb. 16th 4865, work
was commenced with a donkey engine of five horse
power, erected on a turn-table, and in such a position


of the machinery on the gronnd, including crushing
plant, pumps, tram roads, donkey engine for
I
.3
i*
ing, and other mining necessaries, is estimated to be
about £3000. Since the commencement of operations
interest in this claim has changed hands on two
occasions, the first having been the sale of half
a full
share by Mr T. Dahl to Mr N. M'Kay in Sep., 1862 ;
the second took place in the early part of the year
1865, when the interest of Mr 0. Birney, consisting
of a full fourth share, was bought by the company
jointly.
The above is the history of this claim up
to the
month of March 1865 : since which time the follow-
ing Avork has been done.

as to make its services available for every abaft on the
ground. The shafts on the claim are four in number,
one at either end of the ground, each of which are
190 feet in depth ; one in the centre, which is used
principally as a pump shaft, here a depth of 215 feet
has been reached ; and a fourth, a little eastward and
midway between the pump shaft and that at the
northern end, which is used exclusively for the pur-
pose of the workmen ascending and descending the
mine by the aid of ladders. The pump mentioned
above for draining the mine is constructed with a six
inch plunger* and pipes of seven inch bore. An
estimate of the value that this one claim has been to
Inglewood, may be belter made when it is stated that
the labour employed has varied between & ten tw enty-
five men, the average being about fifteen. The value

This list of crushings shows an average of nearly 7
dwts to the ton. the whole of this stone was
obtained from a portion of the lode hitherto entirely
unworked, namely from the 150 feet level, down to a
depth of 200 feet; the reef the whole distance main-
taining a thickness of from 14 to 25 feet; the amount
of stone, therefore, left in this part of the claim to
operate upon is something immense. In addition to
the above crushings ; the pump shaft has been sunk
an additional 43 feet, making its present depth 258
feet. At a depth of 200 feet a drive has beenput in
to the east a distance of 40 feet, at which point the
cap of an entirely new body of stone was discovered,
from which prospects equal to at least 11 oz to the
ton were obtained. The stone has a sharp under-
lay to the east. A drive was then put in at a
depth of 251 feet for the purpose of testing the value
of the newly discovered reef at that level. From
the acuteness of the underlay it was calculated that
at this depth the stone would be at least 90 from the
shaft; but unfortunately when only 70 feet had been
driven, the plunger case of the -pump burst, and all
operations had consequently to be suspended. Before
the accident happened, a drive had likewise been
put in to the west at the same level as the last
mentioned drive, a distance of 50 feet. This part
of the claim was found to be veined, with small
flat spurs, thickly impregnated with what is sup-
posed to be arsenical pyrites. The interest in this
claim originally purchased by Mr N. M‘Kay, from
Mr T. Dahl, has within the last few months re-
verted back to the original holder ; no other changes
in the proprietory have taken place, the claim there-
fore at the present time remains in the hands of the
orignal prospectors of the March Reef. Since the
suspension of work in this ground, it has been pro-
posed to raise a joint stock Company for the pur-
pose of working it, and the proprietors at the present
time are engaged in compassing .this object.
THE UNITY COMPANY.
The Prospecting claim is bounded on the south by
that of tii e Unity Company. This ground was ori-


ginally known as Nos. 1,2, 3 and 4 amalgamated
claims; the Company at the present time hold it un-
der lease. The ground was taken up and operations
commenced in March 1862, tho Company being repre-
sented on the ground by two working shareholders.
Gold in paying quantities was first discovered on
October 25, 1862, in a drive 70 feet westward of the
first shaft sunk, at a depth of 126 feet. In the fol-
lowing month 16 tons of stone was crushed, and gave
the very satisfactory yield of 22 ozs 18 dwts of gold.
The lode from which this crushing was obtained has
been worked since, without intermission, to the present
time, during which it has given the following splendid
list of crushings—

The above returns show an average ot nearly 19
dwts to the ton for the total yield of the claim
The geld produced by sale the sum of £25,289
8s Id.
The lode in this claim has been, worked a thick-
ness varying from 5 up to as much as 70 feet, the
former having been its size at the level at which it
was at first discovered, gradually increasing to the
latter at a depth of about 180 feet, at which level it
has been considerably worked. But, astonishing as
it may appear to the reader, 70 feet does not describe
the width of the lode in some parts of this claim ;
its full extent has never yet been found. Along the
whole length of the eastern wall, stone in almost
fabulous quantities still remains. This is proved
from the fact that the writer, in the course of an
examination of the ground, saw a drive in this eas-
tern wall of about 12 or 15 feet, and still quartz
continued without the slightest indication of termi-
nating. It Avould be utterly futile to attempt to
estimate the amount of stone that may yet remain
in this ground, suffice it to say that for all practical
purposes it is apparently without limit. The un-
worked stone here alluded to has been proved to
be worth from 4to about 7 dwts to the ton. Stone
of this value, if worked according to the present
system, namely—that of having it reduced at a
public crushing machine at an expense of 10s per
ton, would yield the Company no profit, but the
time may come when they may become possessed of
an efficient crushing plant, then the stone above al-
luded to may become a source of immense wealth.


Tl\e total, length of the claim is 426 feet including
the walls.; of this 220 feet commencing at the nor-
thern boundary, has been opened up, leaving 200 feet
at the.southern end untouched. Soon after the first
discovery of gold in this claim, a whim was erected
to'facilitate the working of it; but horse-power was
found to be totally inadequate to cope with the water
and at the same time to raise the stone ; it was re-
solved therefore, to erect steam-pumping and winding
machinery, and in about the middle of the year 1863,
operations commenced with a 12-horse-power steam-
engine,, working a pump and having winding gear at-
tached, for raising the stone, the pump being con-
structed with pipes of 6-inch guage. This machine
which is most conveniently situated on the claim,
has up to the present time, so far as draining and
winding are concerned, completely answered the re-
quirements of the mine ; the deepest point reached
being 220 ft, and the engine being of sufficient power
to drain to considerably lower levels. The amount of
labour employed in this claim has varied since gold
was first struck, from 15 up to 24 men, the latter
number having: been employed, at one period, for 12
consecutive months.
In the latter end of the year 1864, the Unity Com-
pany passed a resolution to extend their operations
by erecting on the claim a powerful and efficient
crushing plant. For the purpose of raising a suffi-
cient capital to carry out this project, it was resolved
to form a joint-stock Company with a capital of
£20,000 in 2000 shares at £lO each, the Company
then existing to make over to the one proposed to bo
formed the whole of their property for 1,400 paid-up
shares. This project fell through, and the
Unity Company continued working their claim accord-
ing to the original system. The instances of interest in
this comp any changing hands up to this periodate singu-
larly few, one” only having taken place,’.when a share-
holder named Powcl sold his interest to the Company
jointly, for the sum of £lOOO. This fact speaks
volumes with respect to the estimation in which the
ground is held by the proprietors themselves. The

value of the mining plant on. the ground, including
steam engine, winding gear, trucks, buildings, and
tools, has been estimated at about £BOO.
Since tho date of the above acccunt, namely the
month of March 1865, the Unity Company’s operations
have been as follows :—•

The above list of crushings makes the total yield
of tho claim as follows, 10,033 tons of quartz, with a
yield of 8264 ounces 1 dwt 6 grs of gold, the whole
having produced cash to the amount of £32,397 14s 6d*
It will be observed on examining the above accounts
of the yield of this ground, that, with the exception of
a short period in early the part of the year 1855, it has al-
ways maintained its character as a first class paying
claim ; its prospects never having been better than at
the present time. The weekly expenses of working
this mine, average about £9O, including wages, fire-
wood, cost of timbering, lighting the mine, and all
incidental expenses, excepting of course the cost of
crushing. The average amount of labour employed
on the ground is sixteen men.
Up to the present time of writing, the company has
always reduced their stone at a public crushing


machine ; thus adding enormously to their expenses ;
arrangements are however now pending for the erec-
tion of a crushing plant of their own. In the early
part of the year 1865, the proprietors of this ground
formerly co-operative, organized themselves into a
joint-stock Company, registering under Frasers Act;
the registration having been effected on the 10th
April, 1865, The nominal capital of the Company is
£14,000 in fourteen hundred shares at £lO each. The
Unity Company may be noted as being at the present
time one of the most flourishing in the district.
HOPE AND ANCHOR COMPANY.
The claim southward of the Unity Company’s, was
originally known as Nos. 5 and 6 south amalgamted.
The ground is now held under Lease, and work is
carried on, on the co-operative principle, under the
title of the Hope and Anchor Company. The ground
was opened in the Month of July, 1862, and prospect-
ing was steadily carried on without any profitable
results until April, 1860. Two shafts have been
sunk on the claim, standing in an east and west
line, the western one being 128 feet, and the eastern
160 feet in depth. These shafts have been driven afc
various levels a distance of over 600 feet; and blind
shafts have been sunk in the drives to an extent
altogether of 124 feet; making in all over a thousand
feet of sinking and driving. The cross-cut effected
by driving comprises a stretch of ground of 215 feet
from east to west. In the month of April, 1865,
stone from which fair prospects could be obtained
was found ; and a trial crushing of 3 tons gave a re-
turn of 15 dwts of gold. This stone has since been
worked with the following results :

The above crusbings show an average of nearly a
quarter of an ounce to the ton ; but in this particu-
lar instance the value of the ground must not be
judged by the average value of the stone that it has
as yet produced, the latter portion that has been
crushed having been by far the richest; as, for in-
stance, 17 of the 77 tons of the last mentioned lot
gave the very satisfactory return of 19 ozs ; again,
the body of stone from which the above mentioned
returns were obtained, was found 90 feet eastward
of the shaft, and is known as the “Reality Reef
a continuation of the March Reef has yet to be
found in this ground; but as the Unity Company
have worked their rich lode to within a dozen feet
of the northern boundary of this claim, at which
point yields of a most satisfactory character are
being obtained, it is but reasonable to suppose that
days of prosperity are in store for the Hope and
Anchor Company. Steady preseverance such as
was shown in prospecting this ground deserves a
golden reward, and the shareholders have doubtless
the best wishes of everyone who recognises the
worth of unflinching industry.
The next claim Southward was originally known
as Nos. 7 and 8 amalgamated, but since the leasing
of the Hope and Anchor Company’s ground, it has
been recognised Sts No. 6 South. This claim has
had two shafts sunk on it, each to a depth of 160
feet; these shafts have been driven to a considerable
extent, but nothing has been found to afford re-
muneration for the labour expended. Stone in a
rubble form has been found to a considerable ex-
tent, and in various places, but in every instance
it was found to be of an entirely valueless character.
No. 7 is the last claim southward in which work of
any importance has been done. This ground has


been sunk on to a depth of 153 feet. The supposed
line of the March Reef, was found 35 feet east of
the shaft; the stone ranges between 4 and 6 feet in
width, and has been cut through and tested at
various levels, and the result has been to prove its
value to be from. 4 to 11 dwts to the ton.
THE INDEPENDENT COMPANY.
The ground bounding the prospecting claim, on
north, wms originally known as Nos. 1,2, and 3
amalgamated ; it was afterwards held under lease,
and worked by a co-operative company known as
the Independent; it was subsequently registered in
the same name as a joint-stock Company, under
the Limited Liability Act, the registration dating
23rd May, 1865. The stock of the company con-
sists of 1,500 shares, of £5 each ; 1,200 being held by
the original holders of the ground, and the remain-
ing 300 being held in reserve for any future con-
tingency that may arise.
On this claim three shafts have been sunk.
Gold was first discovered in paying quantities in a
shaft at the extreme southern end of the claim, in
November, 1862. Subsequently it was found ad-
visable to sink further north. Here likewise pay-
able stone was found at a depth of about 125 feet
and a whim was erected to facilitate the working
of it ; this was doubly necessary, as the payable
stone was below water level. Subsequently a
greater depth was attained, in consequence of drain-
age effected by the pumping machinery erected on
the prospecting claim.
At a depth of 195 feet the stone was found to bo
about ten feet in thickness, but having a decided
tendency to increase in size. At the last mentioned
level the quality of the quartz was found to be
superior to anything hitherto found, and it was from
near this spot that the best crushings that this claim
has produced were' obtained. The following list of
crushings is the total produce of the claim ;

Yield of the Independent Go’s Claim.
Being an average of not quite 13 dwts to the ton.
In the middle of the year 1865, this Company aided
their operations by erecting steam pumping and
winding machinery; the engine being one of 12
horse power, worked by a tubular boiler. At the
present time the occasional inconvenience of these
boilers is being experienced by this Company, it
not being safe to put the salt water from the reefs
into them ; and the supply of rain w r ater having
failed, the operations of the Company have been
brought, for a time, to a stand-still. There is little
doubt but that this Company has a successful
future before it.
In No. 4, north, sinking has been carried to a
depth of 165 feet. The first gold obtained in this
claim was'found five years ago, when 3| ozs was
produced from 2 tons of stone, taken from a depth
of 130 feet, which at the time alluded to was below
the water level. The party of men who obtained
this gold eventually deserted the claim in conse-
quence of their inability to conquer the water, and
the shaft caving in. The present pxsprietors, in
addition to sinking 165 feet, have driven eastward
a distance of 50 feet, and westward 20 feet; from
the latter drive 7 tons of stone was crushed from a
lode 5 feet in width, and gave a return of 7 dwts to
the ton ; these operations were at the 150 feet level.


A shaft has been sunk on this claim,""west-ward of
the line of the above workings, to a depth of 110
feet, hut the work was not attended with any profit-
able results. No. 5 north has had two shafts sunk
on it; that which was sunk first is at the north end
of the claim, in which a depth of about 160 feet has
been reached, this shaft has been driven from east
to west a distance of 50 feet, but nothing has re-
sulted beyond revealing the existence of a number
of small bodies or blocks of stone of a completely
valueless character. This shaft has been deserted
and a second one commenced, which at the present
time has reached a depth of 80 feet. This claim
has been double banked on the western side, but
the general opinion appears to be that the money
and time so expended might have been better de-
voted elsewhere ; certain it is that up to the present
time no profit has accrued from the operations. But
a careful examination of the ground, has shown
that the work was not undertaken without good and
sufficient reason. It had been an opinion expressed
by several proprietors of ground southward, that
the line of the lode that Avas being worked by the
prospectors and Unity Company would be found
Avestward of the Avestern boundary of No. 5, and it
Avas resolved to test the correctness of this opinion.
A shaft was commenced in a position pointed out
by those supposed to be qualified to give a correct
opinion, and the fiucan of a lode was almost im-
mediately found on the western side of the shaft,
This fiucan eventually made out into stone of most
promising looking character, aa ithout, having hoAV-
ever any gold observable in it. The stone varies in
Avidth, sometimes stretching nearly across the shaft >
and then contracting to a few inches. In this form
it has been traced doivn to the Avater level, when
further prospecting (for the present at least,) be-
came impossible. A feAV feet above the AVater-levcl
a drive has been put in over 100 feet in lengtkq
About 30 feet from the shaft in this driA r e, a small
body of stone Avas discovered with a golden pros„
pect in it; but the dimensions of it were not suffi-


ciently large to admit of its being worked. Up to
this point all the strata had liad a western under -
hay, but on continuing the drive the underlay was
found to reverse, and it was thought in consequence
that this might be the line of some permanent lode,
and a blind shaft was sunk for the purpose of test-
ing it; after penetrating a few feet operations had
to be stopped in consequence cf water. At the
water level the sthne appeared to be making larger.
On the same level as tbe drive just described, there
is another of considerable length eastward, but
nothing of any importance resulted from the work.
At the present time this claim remains registered.
No. 6 has reached a depth of 170 feet, and has
cross-cut a distance of 70 feet. In the course of
working, leaders have been found in all directions,
but the largest body of stone was found at a depth
of 90 feet, from which 10 tons was crushed, and
gave a yield of 5 dwts to the ton ; this body of stone
was 2 feet in thickness.
No. 7 north has had three shafts sunk, one to a
depth ot 120 feet, another 127 feet, and a third to a
depth of 173 feet; the latter has been driven at va-
rious levels, in all, from east to west, a distance of
200 feet. In this ground, at a depth of 110 feet,
1 I tons of stone gave 18| ozs of gold, and a second
crushing of 15 tons gave 15 ozs. The stone from
which these crushiugs were taken is not a regular
lode, but a series of small blocks ; various other
crushings have been obtained, but of which no
regular account has been kept, but the result was
such as to impress the proprietors with the belief
that an almost unlimited amount of stone remained
in the ground worth about 4 dwts'to the ton ; but a
trial crushing of 50 tons taken indiscriminately, re-
sulted in a loss, the yield being under 2 dwts to the
ton. Prospecting is still being carried on in this
claim.
No. 8 north ha's been sunk to a depth of about
170 feet, but nothing of importance has hitherto re-
sulted from the work done. In No. 9 north a con-
siderable amount of work has been done at various


times. The first holders of this claim found stone
that on trial proved worth 4| dwts to the ton, but
this not paying, the claim was deserted.
About twelve month? since this ground was again
occupied, and a considerable amount of prospecting
has been since done in it, without, however, resulting
in a profit to the shareholders. A few months since
a body of stone was discovered 60 feet west of the
shaft, but the great influx of water rendered it im-
possible to test its value. This last mentioned claim
terminates the workings northward on this line ;
it stands surrounded by the alluvial workings of
Potter’s Hill, which is supposed to be the head of
that lead of gold which first rendered Inglewood
famous, and drew together, it is supposed, the largest
and densest mass of human beings ever yet found at
one time on a new goldfield, and forming what is
popularly called a rush.
The March Reef has been double banked on the
eastern side of the southern claims. This has been
named “ The Reality Reef, ” a description of which
will form the subject of the next chapter.
Chap. XII. The Reality Reef.
At the close of the preceding chapter, it was
stated that the reef therein described had been
double-banked on the eastern side, southward of the
prospecting claim. This line, called the “ Reality
Reef, ” now demands attention. The prospecting
claim was taken up on the Bth June, 1863, the reason
for occupying the ground having arisen from ap-
pearances in the underground workings of the
T Jnity Company’s claim, indicating the probable

existence of stone in this direction, and a general
bias in favour of the spot by the prospectors them-
selves, although it may be mentioned that no out-
crop of stone or other surl'ace indications proclaimed
the existence of any reef whatever. Operations
were commenced by sinking a shaft 136 feet in
depth ; at this level a body of stone was discovered,
seven feet westward of the shaft, a trial crushing of
which four tons gave 2\ dvvts to the ton. But the
peculiarity of the dip and underlay, and likewise the
direction in which the stone appeared to be making
rendered it desirable that another shal t should be
sunk ; a fresh one was therefore commenced seventy
feet from the first in about a north westerly direc-
tion, that having been thought to be the bearing of
the stone. The result proved the calculation to be
correct. At a short distance westward of the shaft
at a depth of 140 feet the stone was again found,
and a good prospect immediately obtained, 17 tons
was sent to the mill as a trial, and was found to
give a yield of nearly an ounce to the ton. A whip
to facilitate raising the stone, and a blacksmith’s
shed were erected, and the lode was then systemati-
cally worked with the following result:—

Showing an average for the total produce of the
claim of a trifle over of 18 dwts 7 grs to the ton
The stone maintained an average thickness through-
out of about twelve feet. The Reality Reef, so far
as the prospectors have been able to ascertain, is


not a regular -well defined lod#, but exists, in blocks,
The crushings mentioned above have been the pro-
duce of the first one discovered, the value of the
second, which made almost immediately after the
tailing out of the first has not yet been proved, an
influx of water preventing sinking being carried to
a sufficient depth for that purpose. Since the date
of the last crushing the operations in this claim
have been entirely of a prospecting character. The
ground is held under lease. Before concluding the
remarks on this claim, it may be well to direct
special attention to the very unusual bearing of the
stone. Taking into consideration the fact of the
bearing of the lode being as near as possible N.W.
by S.E. in conjunction with the circumstance that
a line in this direction bears directly on to the claim
of the Unity Company, tne idea may be entertained
with a reasonable show of probability, that the Real-
ity and March Reefs, have some sort of connection
one with the other. The solution of the problem
must, however, remain the work of time.
The claims southward have been marked out and
operations carried on as near as possible in a line
with the bearing of the stone in the prospecting
claim. No, 1 has had two shads sunk on it, in the
first a depth of 130 feet was reached, and has been
driven eastward 100 feet, and westward 30 feet.
At the .one hundred feet level, ten feet eastward of
the shaft a body of stone-five feet in thickness was
discovered ; it is a tolerably well defined reef, and
has every appearance of being the line of a perma-
nent lode. So far as this stone has been prospected
it has hitherto proved valueless. -The second- shaft
sunk on this claim is about 130 feet eastward of
the first, here a depth of 158 feet bas been reached
and a drive put in westward 30 feet, meeting the
one hundred feet drive eastward in the first shaft.
A diive has likewise been put in eastward a dis-
tance of 75 feet, it will be seen therefore, that the
ground has had a cross-cut from east to west in-
cluding the length of the shafts of nearly 250 feet,
ail this work proving unproductive the claim was


abandoned. After tholapse of a considerable time ibis
claim was again taken possession of, and prospect-
ing operations have been carried on in it to the
present time but the work done has not been attended
with any profitable results.
In No. 2 South, a shaft has been sunk to a depth
of about 140 feet, and driven at various levels both
east and west effecting a cross-cut altogether of
somewhat near 80 or 90 feet. Stone in limited
quantities has been found in this claim in various
places but nothing of a remunerative character
presenting itself, the claim was abandoned in the
la*ter part of the year 1804. The Reality lino termi-
n .tes southward with this claim, the; following ground
being held by claim-holders on the Godwin Reef.
No, 1 North, was taken up and operations commen-
ced in January, 1864, A shaft has been sunk on this
claim to a depth of 170 feet. At 125 feet a body of
stone was struck covering the whole of the bottom
of the shaft, sinking was continued through this
stone, and at a depth of 130 feet a trial lot of 3 tons
was sent to the mill and gave a return of 9 dwts. A
further trial of 13 tons resulted in a gross yield of
16 dwts. This of course, not paying expenses,
further operations on it were relinquished. The
above-mentioned body of stone partially tails out
at a depth of 160 feet; at 170 feet, that is to say
the deepest point reached, it is 2 feet in thickness ;
the bearing of this stone and the position of the
ground—which is nearly clue north of that held by
the prospectors—points to the probability of its
being a distinct lode altogether from that discovered
in the prospecting claim. A continuation of the
stone discovered in No 1 will have to be sought for
in the prospecting claim at a point considerably
eastward of that at which operations have hitherto
been carried on. At the deepest point reached,
namely 17-0 feet, a drive has been put in eastward
37 feet, and westward 26 feet, but nothing' of im-
portance resulted from the work. In May, 1861,
this claim was registered, and again in October of
the same year ; at its expiration in January, 1865,


it was abandoned. No 2 North, has had a shaft
sunk on it to a depth of about 160 feet. At its
lowest level a drive has been put in westward
15 feel, and eastward 30 feet; in the latter at
about a distance of 18 feet from the shaft a
body of stone was discovered the thickness of
which has not been ascertained in consequence of ar-
riving at the western boundary of the claim, when it
had been penetrated 12 feet. This lode as far as it
has been prospected has proved valueless, its bearing
is about the same as that found in the prospecting
claim, namely, N.W. by S.E., it is therefore unlikely
to be identical with the stone found in the neighboring
claim south. Driving to a limited extent has like-
wise been carried on at various levels, but without
resulting in anything of importance. This claim was
registered in Jan. 1865 ; at the expiration of the term
it was abandoned, but with No. I, was almost im-
mediately taken up under lease by the Unity Com-
pany, the great inducement being the fact that the
ground forms the eastern boundary of their original
claim on the March Reef. The last-mentioned claim
terminates the workings northward on this line.*
Note. —*lt will be seen from the above account
that the prospecting claim on this line is the only one
that has proved remunerative. Apparently, well-
grounded reasons are assigned for this. It is asserted
that a continuation of the lode that has been found in
the prospecting claim has not yet been touched in
either of the claims north or south of it, and if a gene-
ral view of the whole line be taken from the shaft of
No. 2 North, and considered in connection with the
above written description of it, it will appear that
there is some foundation for the opinion. It will be
observed on taking up a position by the side of where
the windlass of No. 2 North originally stood, that the
whole line forms two sides of an obtuse angle triangle,
the prospecting claim being in the centre. The
southern claims have been marked out as near as
possible in a line with the bearing of the stone found
by the prospectors, that is to say south-east, the line
of the northern claims on the contrary is a trifle east-
ward of north, comparing this with the known bearing
of the lode in the prospecting claim, there appears to
be some foundation for the opinion that the .Reality
Reef has yet to be found outside their boundaries.

Chapter XIII. The Jeesby Reef.
The Prospecting claim on this justly renowned
reef, was marked out on the 3rd of May, 1860, by
Mr Aubin, who named the ground after his native
island, Four days after the marking out, gold was
found in the stone 3 feet from the surface, the
necessary notice in such cases posted in the War den’s
office, bearing date, Bth of May. But this surface
stone did not prove payable, and the prospector from
lack of available funds, and inability to procure
backers, was obliged on the 10th of July following,
to abandon it. Mr Aubin had not lost faith in the
Jersey Reef, and nothing was further from his inten-
tion than that the abandonment should be perman-
ent, and it was again taken up on the 14th January
1861, and steadily worked until thefollowing March
when quartz, bearing gold, was found at a depth of
80 feet. But it was not until the 2nd of July, that
undeniably payable quartz, at a depth of 85 feet
was obtained, and on the Bth of the same month, the
first crushing was obtained from the lode that
subsequently, gave the following magnificient re-
turns.

Or a net proceed for the
whole claim of £30,416
18s Bd, deduct this from the above gross proceeds and
the sum of £BIB4 4s 6d is shown as the w uinng


expenses for the whole time the claim has been
opened.
The reef from which the stone giving the above
results was extracted, has varied very much in point
of thickness, near the surface, not being more than
about 3 feet. At a greater depth, it had increased
to 17 or 18 feet; the reef has been worked up to with-
in a very short distance of the surface. Gold has
been found down to water-level, hut no attempt has
been made hitherto to carry on work to any extent
below that point. There have been seven shafts sunk,
two or three of them are, however, shallow. The
two deepest have been worked by the aid of a whim,
the others by a whip and windlasses. Tor a consider-
able length of time, this claim gave employment to
about 12 men. In No 1 North, a very great amount
of work was gone through before gold was discovered.
Two shafts were first sunk on the highest ground of
the claim, but after they had been driven for a
considerable distance, it was determined to abandon
them, it being the general opinion, that they were
too far westward, Mons. Combat, a shareholder,
(whose name has before appeared in connexion with
the Columbian,) gave it as his opinion, that if the
reef was to be obtained at all, it would be by sinking
a shaft 79 or 80 feet eastward of the first workings.
This opinion was acted upon, and in the month of
February, 1861, at a depth of about 60 feet, a body
of stone was cut, the first crushing from which, of
21 tons, gavfe an average of 4 ozs. 8 dwts. to the ton.
This, of course, raised the spirits of the shareholders
very considerably. “ But ah !it was delusive hope, ”
in this particular instance, for in the following
crushing, the average yield was brought down to a
little over an ounce, and the next to 4 dwts. to the
ton. The following is the detailed account of these
crushings. Yield of the No. 1 North.

Four dwts. to tits ton, not being sufficient to pay the
expenses incurred, these workings were abandoned,
and operations were resumed in the shaft, which was
sunk to a depth of 170 feet, but no fresh discovery
was made. As the stone had an eastern underlay, a
drive was put in ; in that direction at a level of a 100
feet, the reef was cut through, but here it had run out
to a few small leaders, having just the “colour” in
them. Again driving was commenced, this time at
170 feet. On cutting the reef at this level, it was
found to have increased in size, but still it did not
“ shape.” After following it down in a monkey
shaft, fur a depth of about 20 feet, making the
deepest point gained 190 feet from the surface, it was
registered, but the original shareholders did not at
at the expiration of the time resume work, and the
ground has since been incorporated with the prospect-
ing claim underlease. In Nos. 2 and 3, an immense
amount of work has been done, but hitherto, without
any profitable result. Plenty of stone has been found,
but trial crushings have rarelj r given more than an
average of 3 or 4 dwts. to the ton.
The southern claims have a better tale to tell than
the northern. In No. 1, gold was first got at a depth
of 140 feet in a drive, a very short distance from
the shaft. The stone was worked the whole length
of the claim, from the level at which it was first
obtained down to that of 190 feet where it tailed
out, but made again a few feet deeper. The reef
in this claim has been worked down to water, the
last crushing af this level giving 5 dwts to the ton,
the stone being about 8 feet in thickness. No
attempt has been made to get below this level, and
very little work of any description has been done at
a shallower depth than 140 feet. Mr G. Gibbins
has furnished the following list of crushings, the
correctness of which is vouched for by that gentle-
man. Yield of No. 1 South.

Add 12 ozs. to the above amount for the second
crushing, and a general average is shown for this
claim of nearly 1 oz. 7 dwts. to the ton.
In No. 2, gold was first obtained at a depth of
179 feet, in a continuation of the stone worked in
No. 1. The three first crushings were taken out
from this level. The lode in this part of the claim
was worked but very partially, about 12 feet of the
whole width only being taken, the yield being not
more than a of an oz. to the ton. The width of
the reef in this part, is sometimes 40 feet, conse-
quently, an immense amount of stone is still left
here, all of which, would give a yield similiar to
the above-mentioned average. This afield not being
up to the expectations of the shareholders, further
prospecting was commenced, and eventually stone
of considerably greater value was found in a blind
shaft in the old workings, the lode being a con-

The above account shows an average of rather
more than 10 dwts. 10 grs. to the ton. This being
lower than those of the neighbouring claims, may
be accounted for, by the very large amount of stone
found here, it is generally believed that there is
considerably more than in any other claim on the
same line, sometimes (as mentioned above,) showing
a thickness of 40 feet. The following items are
copied f-am Mr M'Keone’s diary “ 1864, Aug. the
oth. Trial crushing from the blind shaft south,
yielded l! ; dwts. 6 grs. August the 13th, left ofi
work. August the IGth, registered.”


' The next claims south, namely—Nos. 3 and 4, are
amalgamated. The reef in this ground, was first
struck at a depth of 90 feet, when a trial of 3
giving a return of only 1 or 2 dwts. to the ton, sink-
ing was continued to lid feet. The reef was here
again cut through, hut was not found to be payable.
At 140 feet, the same result was shown. Sinking
was then continued to a depth of 170 feet, when a
fresh body of stone was struck in the shaft, from
which a good prospect was obtained. The reef
was here opened out, and a crushing of 10 tons,
gave a yield of 15 dwts. to the ton. This stone was
subsequently found to be a small leader, stretching
along the western side of the main reef, which was
here found to be about 6 feet from the shaft. A
trial crushing showed its value at this level, to be
6 dwts. to the ton, the thickness of the stone being
4 feet. At a depth of 190 feet, its value had in-
creased to 7or 8 dwts to the ton. An opening out
was made at this level and some very good stone
was obtained. Mr. Goodwin, one of the share-
holders has furnished the following list of crushings
obtained principally from this part of the claim.

The body of stone from which these results were
■obtained, was worked down to water level, namely,
222 feet, by a length along the line of 100 feet.
Operations had for a time to be suspended in these
workings, in consequence of foul air, until another
shaft was sunk, and ventilation made perfect, by
connecting the two by a drive. After the mine had
been opened for 2 years, these workings fell in to such
an extent, as to induce the proprietors to abandon
them, but before the above accident happened, the
following knowledge of the ground at its greatest
depth had been gained, namely—that there were two
bodies of stone eastward of the main line, of the re-
spective widths of 4 and 2 feet, and one body west-
ward, 2 feet in thickness, and all this stone upon
trial proved to be worth about 5 dwts to the ton.
Being in possession of these facts, it induced the
proprietors to clear out the mullock, and re-timber
the mine, but no further work has been carried on
in this part since. The claim was subsequently
worked on tribute, at or about the 90 feet level, when
the following crushings were obtained. The account
has been furnished by
Duncan, shareholders.
Messrs Chamberlano and
Showing the Stone in this part of the claim to be
of an average value of little over 7 dwts to the ton.
In the early part of November 1864 the tributers
stopped work and the claim was registered.
The foregoing comprises the history of the
portion of the Jersey Beef therein described, up
to the date of the publication of the first edition of
the present work. Since that time the ground has


duced the following list of crushings.

The Jersey Reef Gold Mining Company was
registered under the Limited Liability Act on
October 2nd 1865. The capital consists of £B,OOO
in 4,000 shares of £2 each. The whole of the scrip
paid up to £l, was taken by the original holders
of the ground as compensation, leaving the amount
of £4,000 which the directors can call up in the
event of necessity. Since the formation of the
company the principal operations have been in
that portion of the ground originally known as No.
2 North, and from which ground the following
crushings have been obtained.

In addition to the above some smaller amounts
have been obtained,'making the total yield pro-
duced since the company has been in operation up


to the present time, 367 ozs. 10 dwts 21 grs. This
has allowed the company to declare two dividends
namely 2s per share on 27th December, 1865 ; and
Is 6d per share on 18th January, 1866 ; in addition
to keeping in hand a reserve fund of £7O ; making
a total clear profit of £7OO, for about two months
work, including the time taken in raising the first
of the abovernentioned erushings. The prospects
of this company at the the present lime are certainly
encouraging to a very high degree ; the manager
reporting that several years of good paying woik
may be depended on, as being before them, and that
too, without going below the •water level. The
scrip of this company is quoted at a very hand-
some premium; the sellers in some cases asking
as much as from 10 to 15 ihilliugs on the £1 paid
up.
In Nos. 5 and 6 (amalgamated,) the work up to
the present time has not been remunerative. Two
fihafts have been sunk ; one of them to a depth of
over 200 feet, and stone in large quantities dis-
covered, the value of which, upon trial, has been
proved to be about sor 6 dwts the ton. Very little
beyond work of a prospecting character has been
done in this ground.
The following ground namely Nos. 7, 8, 9, 10,
and 11, is held by the Victoria Company. Opera-
tions were commenced in May, 1862, and have con-
tinued almost uninterruptedly ever since. The
company formerly carried on operations on the co-
operative principle, but subsequently reorganized
and registered as a Joint Stock Company, under
the Limited Liability Act, the registration datmg
April 1865. The books containing the account of
the operations of this company whilst working on the
co-operative principle, have, it is supposed been lost,
a complete account cannot therefore be given. Tha
following list of erushings and dividends, has been
taken from Dicker’s Mining Record; it is not stated
from whence they were obtained, but a shareholder
in the company has personally vouched for their cor-
rectness.

nadVe Dumfries,, celebrated in song, as the scene
where the dew • falls early, and where “ Annie
Laurie ,r of the swan-lilic-rteck, plighted her troth
to her poet.; All this is very pretty, but unfortu-
nately for the lovers of the marvellous, it is singu-
larly deficient of one very necessary quality, namely,
truth. The fact is, the discovery of Maxwell’s reef
was if anjHhing, rather a prosy affair. A party of
five men, consisting of the three bothers Laidlaw,
and Messrs Gilchrist and White had so managed,
that whilst one divison worked in alluvial, the other
should prospect in the neighbourhood for a reef,
and so'Was found the Maxwell’s reef, after a very fair
share of steady prospecting in ground that was in
those days Covered with a dense serub. On open-
ing the ground, the largest body of surface stone
that has ever been found in the district was laid
bare. Good specimens were found for a width of
about 30 feet, and the stone taken Indiscriminately
from that width on being tried at Kingowcr, proved
worth 4 ozs to the 'ton. This lode was steadily
worked from the surface, downwards, and up to
December, IS6f, gave the fortunate possessors the
following list of crushings :

At about the date of the last of the above crush-
fogs, the prospectors paid a visit to England, since
which, accounts do not appear to have been regularly
kept, but Messrs Laidlaw state, that the yield would
amount in the aggregate, to rather more than 4000
ozs., in addition to the above list, making the gross
yield of the claim up to the present time, about
10,000 ozs., but it may be as well to state, that, this
amount includes the yield from No 1, South, that
claim having been purchased by the prospectors,
and incorporated with their original claim. The
prospects of this claim still continue brilliant. The
water-level, namely, 200 feet, has been reached
some time since, and Messrs Laidlaw and Co., have
just erected most efficient steam-pumping, and
winding machinery. Work by the aid of this
machinery has just commenced; the help of the
pumps, has not however, been required, and it is
thought they will not be necessary for another 20
feet, the influx of water not being greater than will
allow of its all being sent up in the mullock obtained
in sinking. Twenty specimens from this claim
were exhibited by the proprietors in the “ Great
Exhibition” in London, for which a first-class
certificate was awarded.
The Maxwell’s Reef Gold Mining Company.
Since writing the above, by the aid of the
pumping machinery spoken of, the principal


•baft ha« been sunk to a depth of 250
feet, and the reef at that level partially prospected,
the result of which work having been a determination
on the part of the proprietors to erect powerful
crushing machinery, th e amount of auriferous stono
being so great as to hold out prospects of payable
work for some years to come. In furtherance of their
project, the owners of the ground resolved on the
formation of a Joint Ftock Company, to be called
“ The Maxwell's Ileef Gold Mining Company;” the
capital to consist of £20,000 in 20,000 shares of £1
each. The proprietors of the ground to receive
10,000 shares paid up to fifteen shillings, as compen-
sation for the ground. It is proposed to erect a 25
horse-power engine, with twenty four heads of
stampers in six batteries of four each, together with
all the latest improvements in crushing and amalga-
mation. The amount of available auriferous stone
known of in the Company’s ground at the present
time, has boon estimated at 80,009 tons. On the
erection of crushing machinery this Company will bo
in a position to immediately commence profitable
operations, the mine being in first-rate working
order.
No. 2, South, has been sunk to a depth
of 198 feet, that is to say, to the water-
level. The only stone obtained in the shaft
was some rubble and a few small leaders at a depth
of 10 feet. The shaft has been driven at the 100
feet level, eastward 85 feet, and westward 30 feet.
At a distance of 24 feet from the shaft, a lode of
stone supposed to be identical with that in the
prospecting claim was discovered, which on trial
proved worth 7| dwts. to the ton. This lode was
followed along the line a distance of 60 feet, the
stone that was taken out, averaging the whole dis-
tance nearly 4 dwts. to the ton. A drive has like -
wise been put in at the water-level, a distance of
90 feet eastward, the lode was here again found, but
only a few inches in thickness, it was followed down
n a blind shaft as far as water allowed, where it was.

found to be increasing, in, size. Xo crushing took
place from this point, nothing having been seen to
lead to the supposition that it would pay. At the
southern end of this claim, a small quantity of surface
stone was obtained, that gave J an oz. to the ton,
this was taken from a body 5 feet in thickness, an
immense quantity of which is left worth 4 dwts to
the ton.
Xo. 3, South, has sunk down to the water-level.
At a depth of 100 feet, a body of stone was struck
about 12 feet in width, which on trial proved worth
a few dwts. to the ton only, not sufficient to pay for
working, at least according to the system yet applied
to it.
No. 4, South, likewise, has sunk down to water.
At a depth of 90 feet, there is a very large body of
stone, worth 5 dwts. to the ton.-
The last mentioned three claims are held by the
Hope Company.
The Enterprise Company.
The next ground south,, namely, Nos. 5,6, 7,8, 9
and 10, comprises the lease held by the Enterprise
Gold Mining Company. The ground was formerly
worked by small parties of miners, each holding their
separate claim. During the time operations were

The Enterprise Company was formed about the

Meeting having been held 22nd January, 1865. The
capital consists of £SOOO, in 1000 -shares of £5 each;'
300 paid up shares having been given tb the original
prpprietors for the mine. At the second Ordinary
General Meeting of the Company, a proposition of
amalgamation from the Hope Company was submitted
foi* consideration, but which was however rejected as
it was considered that the terms were extravagant,
By the aid of the pumping machinery on the prospect-

farther, the stone was enlarging as it went down,
and decidedly improving in character.”
If it were possible for a doubt to exist in the mind
of anyone as to the permanent character of the
Maxwell’s Seef, it would vanish for a certainty upon
an examination of the underground workings of Np 1,
North.
The shaft has been sunk to the water-level, that is
to say to a depth of 200 feet, and cuts through the
main-lode at a depth of 175 feet, The first workings
are at a depth of 15 feet The stone at this level
was worked down to a depth of 50 feet. The next
opening is at a depth of 65 feet. At this level, the
best stone that the claim has produced has been
obtained. Openings have likewise been made at the
following levels, 95, 120, 15©, and 175 feet. At the
latter, the reef as mentioned above crosses the shaft
•the lod.o here is better developed and more solid than
in any other part at present worked, and the walla
of the reef,, both east and west are as smooth as though

has been done in this claim at water-level, nothing in
fact but a short drive in the direction of the reef

This shows an average of nearly 15 dwts. to the
ton for all that the claim has as yet produced, but
an inspection of the claim has shown that the above
crushings have been merely trials of the reef at the
different levels as yet opened. Stone yet remains
of quality, equal it is presumed to the above, in
countless thousands of tons, as the reef maintains
an average thickness from the surface to the water-
level, of over 30 feet.
The Concohd Company.
Nos. 2,3, 4,5, 6, and 7, are held under lease by
the Concord Gold Mining Company. The first
Company of this name deserted this ground, having
failed in their efforts to float the speculation,
another effort is about to be made by ■ a company
having the same title, and it is thought with toler-
able chances of effecting their object. A consider-
able number of shafts have been sunk on this portion
of the reef; and stone has been proved to exist in
immense quantities, but no large yields have as yet
been obtained. The water-level has been reached
in several shafts, and at that level in No. 3 a drive
has been put in to the east a distance of 60 feet
when stone 20 feet in thickness was discovered
which proved to be worth 4 dwts to the ton. It
would seem from this, that, a large amount of pay-
ing work is actually known of in this ground, for
any company possessed of an efficient crushing
plant.

Nos. 8. 9, and 10, appear to be of very similar
character, namely, possessing plenty of stone biit
not of sufficient value to afford a profit to the share-
holders. No. 8 has had two shafts sunk on it, the
deepest being 183 feet ; stone was struck in this shaft
at a depth of 150 feet, but nothing but the
bare f‘ colour ” could be obtained from it. Sinking
was then continued to a depth of 183 feet, when a
drive 20 ft. to the east once more revealed the reef;
at this point it was 8 feet in thickness,'but on being
tried it proved utterly worthless. "In Nos. 9 and 10
sinking has been carried to a depth of 200 feet, and
crushings have been obtained varying in value from
2 dwts to 1 ounce to the ton. These last
mentioned three claims are now hold under lease;
no operations have been done in the ground for
some time ; at the present time work is totally sus-
pended.
In No. 11, gold was first ’struck in August, 18G1
at a depth of IGO feet. The reef in this ground
is not a lode of any regular thickness, but what is
known as a block reef, that is to say, large bodies of
stone that run out, and make again at a greater
depth. The stone struck at 160 feet was not its
fii st making, it has been folloAVcd upwards to within
a comparatively short distance from the surface.
From a depth of 70 down to 200 feet, all the stone
has been taken out, the lode for the whole distance
having averaged about 6 feet in thickness. The
shaft has been sunk down to the water-level, which
in tins claim was found to bo 233 feet. At a depth
of 220 feet the lode tailed out, but favorable indica-
tions are observable at the water-level of its making-
again. The secretary of the company, F. Wuhlem-
bru, furnishes the following account of the produce
of this claim.

for the total produce of the claim.
In No. 12, gold as first discovered at a depth
of 140 feet, but as in No, 11, the stone has been
worked upwards for a considerable distance!
From a depth of 100 down to 150 feet, the stone has
been removed from one end of the claim to the other
by a Avidth of 30 feet; openings have likewise been
made at the f>o, and 2UO feet levels. This claim has
produced from the different levels as yet opened
the following splendid list of crus Kings, the account
is furnished by the secretary, of whom it may be
related, that he purchased a 4th share at the first
starting of the claim for the sum of Is., and subse-
quently, sold the half of it for nearly twice as many
hundreds of pounds.

Giving an average of nearly one ounce two penny-

No. 13, undoubtedly ranks next in value to tho
Prospecting claim on this line. In May, 1864, this
el.lira received a notice in Dicker’s Mining Record, bu t
the account has so many glaring mis-statements or
errors, that it is thought desirable to correct them.
In the first place it is stated on the authority of one
of the shareholders, that the claim yielded about 80
tons a month, from May, 1860 to June, 1862, the
whole of which averaged in value 2J ozs. to the ton ;
whereas, gold was not discovered until 1861, and from
that time until Juno, 1862, the total yield was 644
ozs. 17 dwts. 13 grs., tho produce of 771 tons of
stone, this would give an average of 59 tons per month
for the twelve months, during which the stone was
being obtained, and of an average value of nearly
16f dwts. to the ton. It is further stated, that the
first crushing gave 16 dwts. (all,) and the next 2£ tons
gave 16 ozs. to the ton, tho correct statement will
be found in the list of crushings appended to tho
present account of tho claim. The list of crushings
from this claim published by “Dicker” is likewise
incorrect in several instances. 11 is proable that these
inaccuracies are typographical errors, as for instance

Being a little more than an average of 1 oz 13 dwts
to the ton,
Thd width of the lode in this claim varies from 6


to 22 feet. The shaft has been sunk to the -water-
level, which was here found to 240 feet, at this point
the lode appears to be better developed than at
shallower depths, but of considerably less value. The
reef in this ground has a most extraordinary acute
dip to the north, so acute in fact as to have rendered
it impossible to trace it to the northern boundary, as
it gets lost in the water, No profitable results have
aceured to the shareholders working of this claim for
more than 3 years.
Great Extended Maxwell’s Reef Gold Mining
Company.
The neighbouring claim northward is 6 acres, held
under lease by the Great Extended Maxwell’s Reef
Gold Mining Company. The prospected portion of
this ground was originally worked by Messrs Finn and
Co., as Nos. 15, 16, and 17, north, amalgamated claims
but alaw-suit, (arising from a portion being “jumped,”)
deprived the original owners of a portion of their
ground. An immense amount of profitless prospect-
ing has been carried on in this ground, the total yield
of the mine up to the present time, having been only
8 ozs 14 dwts. 3 grs., tho produce of 33 tons of stone.
The first crushing took place on March 13, 1863,
when 3 tons gave 5 ozs. 5 dwts. 13 grs.; the next
occurred on October 22, 1863, when 25 tons pro-
duced 3 ozs. 3 dwts. 14 grs., or an average of 2 dwts
18 grs to the ton. The above crushings were ob-
tained from a projection of a small block of stone
on the southern boundary of the claim leading into
No. 14, the whole of which, these crushings cleared
out. The shaft has been sunk about 40 feet below
water, and a cross-cut east and west put in, but
without being attended with profitable results,
but the dip of the reef northward in No. 14, is so
acute, that men who have worked in, and thorougly
understand the ground, give it as their opinion
that there is little hope of reaching the top of the
reef in this claim at a shallower depth than 100
feet below the water-level; if this opinion be cor-
rect the Company have a considerable amount of


prospecting before them before profits can be rea-
lised. Several small leaders have been found at
this ground, but they are reported as valueless.
The Company is at present erecting steam-pumping
and winding machinery, which will be ready for
operations in a few weeks.
Since writing the above in January 1865, the
pumping and winding machinery spoken of has been
brought into operation, and by its help a consider-
able amount of prospecting done. The shaft has
been sunk to a depth of about 340 feet. Stone has
been discovered, but not of sufficient value to pay
the expenses of working.
The following report of a meeting of shareholders
of the Great Extended Company, is extracted from
the Melbourne Herald, of 17 February 1866.
“An extraordinary meeting of the shareholders
of the Great Extended Maxwell’s Reef Gold Mining
Co,, was held on Friday, at the Criterion Hotel,
Mr N. Harris presiding, for the purpose of dissolv-
ing the company, and re-organising it on the basis
of an agreement submitted at the ordinary general
meeting of shareholders held in January last.
Some discussion ensued as to the best mode of
carrying out the above objects, and ultimately the
following resolution was carried, on the motion
of Mr Burgin, seconded by Mr Whiffin—“ That in
consequence of several of the shareholders having
declined to enter into the agreement as to the in-
tended re-organisation of the company, thereby
preventing the same being carried out as desired
at the ordinary meeting of the shareholders held in
January, in the opinion of this meeting it is desira-
ble to wind up this company ; and the directors
are hereby authorised and empowered to take such
steps as they may deem proper for the winding-up
of the company and disposing of its assets.


Chapter XY. The Dreadnought,
In the days when Dusty Town first deserved and
obtained its uncomfortable sounding cognomen ; when
the spirited tradesmen of Inglewood were spending
between two and three thousand pounds a week in
prospecting, some of which was laid out judiciously,
and much of it otherwise ; and when as a result for
this outlay, some of the most valuable reefs in the
district were discovered; in those days then, the north-
ern suburb of the township received its fair share of
that inefficient and superficial prospecting,the traces of
which may be seen to this day for miles around, in
holes deep enough to break the log of anyone who
might happen to fall into them, but certainly not
sufficiently so to test the value of a reef, the out-crop
of which having caught the eye of a prospector, in-
duced him to do the work he did. The discovery of
the Dreadnought Reef is an illustration of this. In
September, 1862, a prospector returning home in the
evening after a day’s labour, accompanied with the
usual tools of pick, shovel, and dish, and having (as a
prospector should, nothwithstanding the day’s work
done,) an eye to business, chanced to glance down a
shallow hole close to a foot-path in the scrub a little
backward from Claughton’s crushing machine, and
saw what appeared to be the top of a reef of apparent-
ly considerable size. To descend the shaft and bring
up a dish of the stone was almost as a matter of course
the next proceeding, which on being washed at a
water-hole close by, revealed so much more than the
mere “ colour ” of the desired metal, that a claim was
at once marked out. Subsequently, the Dreadnought
Prospecting Company was organised for the purpose
of giving it a fair trial. The company consisted of 12
members, including two working shareholders. Pay-
able stone was obtained about 8 or 9 feet below where
the first trial dishful was taken from, and at this
level a tiial of 8 tons produced 10 ozs 4 dwts 6 grs of
gold. The stone was then partially removed down to a
depth of TO feet, when another shaft was sunk abeut

60 feet further south, in such a position that the reef
was struck at about the same level as the deepest in
the first shaft. By driving along the reef northward
the two shafts were connected, and the best stone
that the reef has produced, was obtained mid-way
between the two. The shaft last sunk has been
carried down, but very partially worked to a depth
of 130 feet; the reef for the whole distance maintain-
ing an average thickness of about three feet. It ia
without a doubt one of the most perfectly defined
lodes in the district, having a clear sand-stone wall
on the west side and slate on the east, it has a sharp
dip southward, and underlays east. The Dreadnought
Prospecting Company abandoned this ground in May,
1863. The result of their operations having been as
follows :
207 99 6 1
Giving an average of 9 dwts. 14 grs to the ton. The
gold realized by sale the sum of £367 8s 3d. The
following is a table showing the calls made upon, and
the dividends paid to the shareholders :
CALLS MADE UPON SHARE'
The above shows a balance against the company of
£29 14s lid. But in estimating the value of this


ground a few facts must be kept, in view, beyond thoso
presented by the above figures. For instance, it
must be remembered that almost as a rule the most
disadvantageous mining operations are those that are
carried on on a limited scale, and without the aid of
machinery. The fact that this disadvantage existed
must certainly be borne in mind with respect to the
Dreadnought Prospecting Company, this is proved from
the fact that only £257 2s fid was paid for wages
during the whole time operations were carried on.
Again all the labour of raising the stone, &c., was
psrformed by windlasses worked by hand, and when
in connection with this it is considered that the
highest current rates were paid for crushing, it is
very likely to be admitted that the ground in question
has not hitherto had proper usage, and will eventually
if worked under a proper system, turn out a good and
payable mine. The average value of the produce of
the ground up to the present time would tend very
much to strengthen this opinion. One other fact in
connection with the Dreadnought Reef would tend
very much to strengthen a confidence with respect to
its future prospects, namely, that it has been ascer-
tained beyond a doubt to bo a continuation of the
once—and very probably to be again—celebrated Odin
Reef. Shares have been sold in this claim at various
periods, at prices ranging from £35 to £BO. North-
ward of the prospecting claim no effort of any import-
ance has been made to find a reef. Southward,
claims were marked out to a considerable distance,
and prospecting to some extent was carried on, but
nothing of a permanently paying character has been
found. Gold has been discovered and prospects of a
quarter of an ounce to the dish, have on various
occasions been washed but they have turned out to be
but stray patches. A short time since, the prospect-
ing claim was again taken possession of, but the
work since done has been of a very useless character,
for instance, a shaft has been sunk westward mid-
way between the two sunk by the Dreadnought Com-
pany, and nothing resulting down to a depth of 70
feet, a drive was put in to the east. By refering to


the above account of the’operations of the Dread-
nought Company, it will be seen that the reef has al-
ready been worked at this level, and likewise that
it has an eastward underlay, ergo , the deeper the shaft
is sunk, being situated westward of the old workings,
the further operations will be carried from the line
of reef. The present proprietory will ere long find
out that up to the present time their operations have
been only a waste of time and money, and that to
place themselves in a position to successfully pros-
pect the ground they occupy, they must sink a shaft
south-eastward of the workings of the first pros-
pectors.
The above comprised the history of the Dreadnought
Reef up to the date of the publication of the first
edition of the present history, The operations
therein spoken of as being carried on by the last pro-
prietors turned out as the writer predicted, namely,
utterly useless. The diive alluded to as being put
in at the 70 feet level, broke into—as was intimated
that it would—the old workings of the first proprie-
tors. A blind shaft was then put down following
the lode on its underlay to a dep*h of about 130, or
140 feet from the surface; but no profitable discoveries
resulted, the stone running out in this*part of the
claim to a thiekness of not more than a' few inches
A correct knowledge of the ground would have taught
the proprietors to have expected such a result. Be it
remembered the stone has an eastern underlay and
dips sharply to the south, the run of gold, following
the dip of the stone. The ground is at the present
time deserted, but for the guidance of anyone who
may at some future time occupy it, the opinion is
here repeated that was expressed above, nearly a year
since, “ to place themselves in a position to success-
fully prospect the ground they occupy, they must
sink a shaft south eastward of the workings of the
first proprietors.


Chapter XYL The Daly Reef.
(FORMERLY THE SOMERSETSHIRE REEF.)
This reef was opened about January, 1860, by two
miners, whose names the writer has forgotton.
Work was commenced on the western side of the
hill, on a small leader in which gold was found on
the surface. About a bucket full of very rich speci-
mens were obtained almost as soon as work was
commenced, and sanguine expectations were enter-
tained that they had, using the men’s own expres-
sion, “ tapped the jugular vein at last.” Unfortu-
nately they were doomed to disappointment, the
specimens found proved to be only a patch, and at
a very few feet deeper the stone ran out to a mere
thread ; this leader had an eastern underlay, and
the prospectors thinking it would make again at a
greater depth, commenced a shaft on the eastern
side of the hill, with the idea of intersecting or
cutting it again by driving. In putting down this
shaft another body of stone was discovered about
two feet in thickness, from this likewise some very
good specimens were obtained, but at a depth of
thirty feet, it likewise run out to a few threads, the
shaft was sunk, and these small leaders followed to
a depth of sixty feet, a drive was then put in, but
at a shallower depth, for the purpose of cutting the
leader first struck on the surface on the western
side of the hill, but from this work no profitable
results accured. The prospectors’ funds having
become exhausted they determined to abandon the
ground, before doing so however, they washed
the stone they had obtained from the eastern shaft,
about a ton and a-half, and obtained from it 7 dwts
of loose gold, and a bucketful of small stone all
showing specks of the precious metal, had there
been crushing machinery within available distance
this stone would doubtless have had a fair trial,
but at the time alluded to there was no machinery
nearer than Kingower and the circumstances of the
men were such as placed it out of their power to


risk the expense of carting so great a distance upon
an uncertainty as to the result. Ultimately the
prospectors of the Somersetshire Reef, very much,
against their inclination abandoned it. But the
ground had too promising an aspect for it long to
remain without an owner, and [it was almost im-
mediately taken up by Messrs. Johnson, Buchanan
and Co., this time, under the title of the Daly Reef
the name being given in compliment to Mr Daly
one of the then residentjwardens.' After carrying
on prospecting for a short time in the old work-
ings the surface was examined a short distance
further north, resulting in the discovery of a very
valuable body of stone, portions of it yielding as
much as 10- ounces to the ton, so rich indeed was
it that immense sums were offered for the purchase
of shares, but fortunately for the would be pur-
chasers the prospectors refused all offers, as the
stone run out to a few small leaders at a depth of
about thirty feet. A detailed account of the pro-
duce of this block of stone has not been preserved,
but the gross yield was 167 tons of stone, giving 272
ounces of gold, 106 ounces of this gold having been
obtained from 10 tons. A considerable amount of
prospecting was then done, not attended however
with any satisfactory result, and in July, 1862, the
claim was registered. On the term of registration
expiring, work was resumed, resulting in the aban-
donment of the claim about the beginning of the
year 1864. During prospecting, trials were made
from various bodies of stone, these crushings proved
that the claim contains a considerable amount
of stone above water level worth from 2 dwts to
7 dwts to the ton. No attempts have been made
to penetrate to a greater depth, the water being an
insurmountable obstacle. In No. 1 north, work
was commenced in April 1860. Gold was first
found in a small slate leader, at a depth of about 30
feet, but the leader itself was of too small propor-
tions to think of crushing from it, sinking was
therefore continued to a depth of about 50 feet,
prospects apparently payable were obtained at this

level, and 5 tons were sent to the mill for trial and
gave a yield of 6 dwts to the ton, a further trial of
9 tons giving only 4 dwts to the ton. Sinking was
then again resumed, when at a depth of about 60
feet a leader of about a foot in thickness was dis-
covered at the western end of the shaft, from which
a first-rate prospect was obtained, one ton was sent
to the mill to test its value, and yielded the very
satisfactory result of 10 ounces, an opening out was
here made, and the following crushings were
obtained.

Showing an average of 10 dwts. to the ton.
The lode from which the above was obtained, was
eventually found to be identical with that from which
the prospectors obtained their rich patch, it was
worked down to a depth of 110 feet, at which level
it ran out to a few small leaders, but a drive at a
depth of 140 feet in the next claim north, had re-
vealed the fact, that the lode made again, and at


the level at which tho drive had cut through, it was
about 12 feet in width. Measures were then taken
in No. 1 to get on this stone, and as the workings at
the 110 foot level were a considerable distance from
the first shaft, in consequence of the lode taking a
western underlay, it was determined to sink a fresh
one as far westward as would enable them to inter-
sect it in sinking, at about the level at which it had
been obtained in the drive in No. 2. Tho shaft was
commenced and proceeded to a depth of 80 feet, when
the unsatisfactory and shabby behaviour of their so-
called backers induced the working shareholders in a
fit of disgust to abandon it. But ground of this sort
rarely goes long begging for owners, in this instance
it was almost immediately taken up. But tho work
executed by the new proprietors has not been produc-
tive of profitable results, all the work done having
been in the opinion of the first holders, very wide of
the proper spot. The lode in this claim dips sharply
to the north. There has been but a limited amouut
of prospecting, no driving having been executed be-
low a level of 40 feet. There is stone left in this
claim to almost an unlimited extent, that would yield
from 3 to 5 dwts. to the ton.
No. 2, North, has had a very great amount of
work done in it, but nothing has ever been found suffi-
ciently remunerative to pay for the labour expended
on it. In this claim, there is an immense body of
stone, from which crushings amounting in the whole
to about 50 or 60 tons, have been had at various times,
giving yields varying frem 2 to 6| dwts. to the ton.
There are 2 shafts on this claim, the western one
having had the greatest amount of work expended on
it, sinking having boen continued to a depth of over
200 feet. Reference has already been mado
in the account of No. 1, to a drive in this claim at
the 140 feet level, in which it was proved that the
lode that had there been worked and had tailed out,
made again. This stone was found about 12 feet
westward of the shaft, it was driven through and a
trial of about 10 or 15 tons gave a return of between
4 and 5 dwts. to the ton. tbe lode, is r - 1


thickness. At the time this discovery was made, it
was deemed valueless by the proprietors, owing to
the expense of carting and crushing, but the probabi-
lity is that the time is near at hand when a lode of
stone of this quality and size will he viewed with
a different eye.
In No. 3, North, one shaft only has been sunk,
there has been a considerable amount of driving, hut
no discoveries have been made beyond that of finding
an almost unlimited amount of stone, worth from 1
to about 3 dwts. to the ton.
Of the claim south of the prospectors, there is little
to record, the ground having hitherto, proved almost
valueless, one small patch of auriferous stone was
found on the surface in No. 1, but it very soon ran
out, and all subsequent work was entirely unproduc-
tive of profitable results. In Nos. 2 and 3 (amalga-
mated,) a few specimens were once found in a small
leader about 12 feet from the surface, but as nothing
more was ever discovered, it was generally believed
that the few specks that were found, were a small
family of unfortunates, that had strayed away from
home, and had lost themselves. The southern end of
Nos. 2 and 3, terminate in the gully at the foot of
the hill, and ends what is called Daly’s reef, the
ground following southward, although, doubtless, the
same reef has always been known as the Kentish, the
history of which will form the subject of the next
chapter.


Chapter XYII. The Kentish Reef.
In pursuance of a rule adopted in writing this his-
tory of noticing the propecting claims first, a stride of
about a quarter of a mile southward must now be
taken from the point at which the last chapter con*
eluded, in order to enable a starting to be made from
the customary point. The prospecting claim was
marked out in about the middle of the year 1860,
There is very little really authentic, and no documen-
tary information obtainable respecting this, or any of
the half-dozen neighbouring claims ; there has without
doubt, been valuable patches in most of them, but,
none were of an extent to give any long continuous
work. Tho most valuable inhumation in connection
with this ground for the guidance of future operations,
is the fact that at water-level a body of stone exists
30 feet in thickness, which will yield 3 dwts. to the
ton all through, and one smaller leader on the western
side, the last crushing from which, in the prospecting
claim, at the same level, gave 11 dwts. to the ton. As
soon as water was struck in this ground, the influx
was so great, as to put all further operations out of
the question without the aid of steam pumping
machinery. In No 5, North, a body of stone was
struck in 1862, at a depth of 130 feet, which was
supposed to be payable. One of the shareholders a
Mr Greany, on an occasion of his paying a visit to
the claim, descended the shaft to inspect the new dis-
covery. On ascending, he unfortunately fell off the
rope, and was precipitated a depth of 100 feet and
killed on the spot. For reasons never satisfactorily
stated, (perhaps unwillingness to work where so
shocking an accident had happened) this shaft has
never since been worked, A fresh shaft was sunk
but the result of the work hitherto has not been of a
payable character. The next ground, comprising
No’s 6,7, and 8, north, is known as the Garibaldi
claim. This ground has been, and doubtless will be
again, a valuable and paying property. Crushing
commenced in this claim in 1861, and from fliis date


to November 1862, stone was operated upon amount-
ing to 2871 tons, which, yielded 1450 ounces of gold,
showing an average of over 10 dwts to tho ton. At
this time the proprietors agreed to form a joint stock
company, for the purpose of facilitating the erection
of a crushing and pumping plant. In furtherance of
this object, the claim was inspected by Mr King,
Mining Surveyor, who gave it as his opinion that
27,000 tons of stone remained in the claim above
water level, similar to that already raised. But the
endeavors to establish this company met with an
abrupt interruption. The calamity before referred to
in this history, namely, the great fire in December, 1862
rendered all efforts in the matter utterly abortive.
The last number of tho first “Inglewood Adver-
tiser, ” published before the fire, contains tho
prospectus of the company.
Bather more than two years from the present time
of writing, the Garabaldi Company, the original
holders of this ground—was broken up and the claim
sold. The work done by the new proprietors was
more with a view of testing the mine, than any regu-
lar system of operations. The lode at this time was
tried at various levels, from 14, down to 70 feet. At
14 feet from the surface 3 tons were tried, and it was
found to be worth 3 dwts to the ton. From the 20
feet level, 19 tons were sent to the Mill; this yielded
only lj dwts. to the ton. From the 50 feet level*
3 tons gave 3 dwts to the ton ; and the last crushing
from the 70 feet level gave 6 dwts. to the ton. In
the course of the above trial work, 10 tons were
obtained from a small leader on the western side of
the main lode, which yielded 10| dwts to the ton, but
there is no more of the same quality actually known
of. At the water level, namely 165 feet, tho lode is
18 feet in thickness, and its value as proved by
crushing a very small quantity, is about 3 dwts to
the ton.
In the nextclaim, namely, No. 9, two shafts hava
been sunk, one at the north end of the claim to a
depth of 130 feet, and one on the south, 132 feet. In
the latter shaft, a body of stone was found twenty-five


feet in width. Two trial crushings were had, the
first producing 2| dwts, and the second l|’dwta. to
the ton. A drive has been put in and the above stone
cut likewise at the 30 feet level. The lode was hero
found to be seven feet in thickness. A trial crushing
of 10 tons from this level went to the mill, hut gave
a return of only 2 dwts. to the ton. The shaft has
been sunk to a little below water level, at which depth
the reef appeared to be increasing in size, and pros-
pects about equal to those at a shallower depth could
he obtained. The first proprietors abandoned this
ground in May, 1863, since ■which time no work of
any description has been done in it. The neighbour-
ing ground north—that is to say, that extending as
far as No’s 2, and 3, south Daly Reef, has had shafts
sunk on it in various places, but has hitherto proved
utterly valueless, no work having been done on it
for several years.
The last era in the history of this line, is, the
formation of a Joint Stock Company, to be called
the Garibaldi and Kentish United Gold Mining
Company, the ground proposed to be worked
comprising a lease that includes within its boun-
daries 460 yards of the line of reef. The advertise-
ment for registering the Company under the
Limited Liability Act, appeared in the columns of
the “Inglewood Sentinel,” on the 12th Jan., 1866.
The Company is formed with a nominal capital of
£25,000, in twenty five thousand shares, of £1 each.
Since the Company has started, their operations
have been entirely of a prospecting char acter, the
principal part of the work done having been at the
140 foot level, and so far as the work has proceeded
the results have been of an encouraging character.
It is the intention of the Company as soon as the
mine is thoroughly tested to erect a powerful
crushing plant for the purpose of working the
ground to advantage.


Chapter XVIIL
GENERAL SUMMARY.
It was stated at the opening of the present his-
tory, that it was the intention to compile it from
“ reliable sources, ” as it was felt “ that records
of this nature are worse than useless if their authen-
ticity cannot he relied on.” Having arrived at the
end of information of the character above alluded
to—at least so far as accounts of returns are con-
cerned—it is proposed to draw the work to a con-
clusion, as it it is considered that no mining history
can be in any degree useful as a record for reference
that has not included in it an account of the yields
of the different claims, presented in such a form as
to enable the reader to trace the varying value of
the ground during the time it may have been
worked. As a fitting termination, the following
synopsis is offered, showing, the gross produce
of the different lines of reefs, the number of
tons crushed, the amount of gold obtained from
each, and the average value ; to which is added a
few remarks on each, bringing the history of the
whole down to the present time.

It will be seen from the above list that the Colum-
bian stands first in point of average value, it being
a trifle oyer 5 ozs. 17 dwts. 12 grs, for the total pro*


duce of the various claims. It was stated at the
end of the history of this reef, that the operations
of the company who now hold possession of the
whole line, were brought to a dead stand; since
then work of a prospecting character has been re-
sumed, the result of which has been reported to be
of an exceedingly encouraging character ; the
pumping and crushing plant however remains in a
state of inactivity.
The Jersey Keep has produced an average of
nearly 1 | ozs to the ton. This average is arrived
at by allowing | an ounce to the ton, for the first
2659 ounces produced from the Yictoria Company’s
ground ; this is supposed by men qualified to judge
to have been about its value ; the exact number of
tons crushed to produce the amount is not known,
as the book in which the amounts were kept has
been mislaid. Nothing remains to be said of this line
of reef beyond what has already been written.
The Maxwell’s Reef ranks next; its average being
a trifle over 1 oz. 9 dwts. to the ton. The only
circumstance remaining to be noted with respect
to this line, is that of arrangements having been en-
tered into by the Enterprise Company for the
erection of a pumping and winding machine, for
for the purpose of 'more efficiently working their
ground ; along the remainder of the line everything
is at a complete standstill.
The Morning Star shows an average of a little
over 1 oz. 7 dwts. to the ton. This average is pro-
duced exclusive of the stone produced from No. 4
North in the early time of its working ; as before
stated, authentic accounts cannot be obtained, but
so far as traditionary accounts are concerned, there
is every probability that if added they would tend
to materially raise the general average value of the
whole line. The project of forming a Joint Stock
Company, spoken of at the close of the history of
this reef, for the purpose of working the line, has
fallen through ; work aft er the old fashion is going
on in one or two claims, but the greater part of
the line is in a state of total inactivity.


RttcttANAN’s Reef stands next, the returns show-
ing an average value Of 1 oz. 5 | dwts. to thd' ton ;
the returns of this reef aEe however not complete,
there being a deficiency of a greater portion of the
yield of the Prospecting Claim, which if added,
■would considerably raise the average value of the
whole. This ground, including the American and
Nil Desperandum Reefs, is held under lease, and
remains in a state of complete inactivity. It is
strange that this state of things should so long
continue in the face of the well-known fact that
stone in enormous quantities and of *_a paying
character, is known to exist in this ground.
The Godwin Reef has produced an average of
nearly 1| oz. to the'ton, nothing remains to be said
of this line beyond what has already been written.
The Reality Reef takes next place, its average
being within a fraction of an ®unce to the ton. At
the present time Work of a prospecting character
is being steadily carried on ; bnt nothing producing
a profitable result has been done on this line for
some time.
The Leicester Reef has given an average of
nearlyTß| dwts. to the'ton. All that remains to be
said of this reef, is, that operations of the same
languid character as those that have characterized
it for some time past are still carried on.
The March Reef has given an average of rather
over 17| dwts. to the ton. This reef is now dis-
tinguished as having produced more stone than any
.other in the district. Since writing the history of
this line of reef, the Hope and Anchor Company
have made discoveries of a very valuable character
in their claim. A lode entirely distinct from that
originally worked has been found,; and cn March
26th, a crushing was completed from it of 113 tons,
which gavethe satisfactory return of 12Q ozs, 19dwts.
17 grs.J this has given an impetus to operations
southward, and prospecting is being carried on, op
this part of the line with spirit. The ground
held by the Unity Company still maintains its name


as one of the best claims in the district. Operations
in the prospecting claim are still in a state of sus-
pension, pending the formation of the Joint Stock
Company spoken of in the latter part of the account
already written of this claim. The Independent
Company still remains idle for want of rain-water
to work their engine. With respect to the claims
north of the Independent Company’s ground, no-
thing remains to be added to that which has already
been written.
The Old Ixolewood shows an average of 14
dwts. 8 grs to the ton ; but it must be borne in mind
that this does not by any means describe the average
of the total produce of the line, as for instance,
gold to the value of £13,000 from the Prospecting
claim, has not been taken into account, in conse-
quence of the amount of stone from which it was
produced not being known ; but it is a well ascer-
tained fact, that stone in large quantities has been
produced from this ground, worth nearly 9 ozs to
the ton; it is therefore, tolerably certain, that an
account of the different crushings from this claim
Would have materially altered the above -mentioned
average. Since the history of this reef was written,
the lease by which a large portion of the line was
held became forfeited ; the ground was however
immediately re-occupied, and a co-operative com-
pany called “The Royal Standard” organized;
prospecting operations have since been carried on
with spirit, the result of which has been of an
encouraging and satisfactory character.
The Povekty Reef takes next place ; its average
being 13 dwts. 8 grs. to the ton. Since the account
of this line was written the pumping plant on the
claim of Messrs Baragwanath and Samuel, has been
again set to work, and the shaft has been sunk
to a further depth of 30 feet, making it in all 22a
feet deep. On referring to the account already
written of this line it will be seen that first rate
prospects are spoken of as existing at a depth of
195 feet. This stone has been again broken into at
about 12 feet further down, and the lode at this


level proves to be of an exceedingly valuable
character. There appears to be every probability
that the enterprise and patient energy of Messrs
Baragwanath and Samuel in -working this ground
is at last about to meet with a well merited reward.
The Yeldham Reef show's an average of 13
dwts. 2 grs. to the ton. With respect to this line,
nothing remains to be added to that which has al-
ready been written, further than that it still remains
in a state of desertion.
The Daly Reef shows an average of 10 dwts to
the ton ; this is however, exclusive of the Prospect-
ing claim, the proprietors never having kept an
account of the yield of it; but it is tolerably certain
that if added, it would tend to materially raise the
above-mentioned average. One claim only ®n this
reef is being worked, namely—that situated on the
crown of the hill. The northern end appears to be
deserted ; the ground south of that which is being
Avorked, is held under lease.
The Kentish Reef, which is a continuation of
the Daly, shows exactly the same average namely,
10 dwts to the ton ; this, however, relates only to
the ground originally known as the Garibaldi
Company’s claim; the average value of the stone
crushed from the claims north of them is consider-
ably legs, whilst the value of the produce of the
claims south is shrouded in uncertainty, informa-
tion of the whole of a sufficiently reliable character
for publication cannot be obtained, it is therefore
thought best to pass over the few traditionary re-
cords of yields that alone remain obtainable. Litde
remains to be added to the account already written
of this line ; the Garibaldi and Kentish United
Gold Mining Company still continue their pros-
pecting operations, Avhich latterly have been of an
exceedingly encouraging character.
The Dreadnought Reef has produced an
a\ r erago of 9 dwts. 14 grs. to the ton. Nothing
further remains to be said of this line, beyond the
fact of its still remaining in a deserted condition.


The Bendigo Reef is 'the] last on the list, its
average being 5 dwts. 13 grs. to the ton. The
whole of this line at present, is deserted ; but from
the large amount of stone that the ground is known
to contain,'this tvill doubtless, nbt be its fatb' for

MINING LEASES. _ , j iqii

trict to the number of 92 ; of these 79 arc for quartz,
alwl-comprise an aggregate area of 775 acres. A
few of these leases are for abandoned ground, held
in like manner ip. as can
be ascertained, would reduce the aggregate amount
actually held at the present time by something
like 100 acres. t YIa(X oifi

T'Pumps worked by Steam Power, for draining
hiines, are eight in number,- namely,.) one on the
Poverty Reef; three On the March; one on the
Columbian; and three on the Maxwell’s. The
pumps that were formerly erected on the Old
Inglewood, and Buchanan’s Reefs, have iong since
been removed, but there is little doubt but that be-
fore long they will have to be.rcplaced. >

The above list shows the amount of capital
actually invested in Joint Stock Companies, or
liable to be called up, to be £213,160; to this the
Maxwell’s Heef Gold Mining Company, with a
capital of £20,000 may shortly be added; but as
that company is not yet registered it would be
scarcely proper to place it in the abov e list.
In conclusion the writer wishes to express his
most sincere thanks to all those who have aided in
the present work by imparting any information they
may have been possessed of; the task has been a
toilsome, and in many instances a wearisome one,
but the labour has been materially lightened by the
friendly alacrity with which in nearly every instance
that information has been imparted. No effort has
been made on the part of the writer to produce an
effect by florid or romantic touches, such a course
would not have been in accordance with the
manner in which a mining history should be
written ; the work is simply a compilation of a col-
lection of facts, collected with the utmost care and
caution ; errors may have crept in, but every effort
has been made to make it a trustworthy record of
the Mining Statistics of the district, and the pen, for
the present is laid down in the hope that it will
be considered that the task has been performed
with judgment and integrity.
