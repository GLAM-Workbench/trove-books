HYMN
Sentences.
Psalm XC.
Lord, Thou hast been our refuge: from one generation to another.
Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever the earth and
the world were made; Thou art God from everlasting, and world
without end.


Thou turnest man to destruction: again Thou sayest, Come again,
ye children of men.
For a thousand years in Thy sight are but as yesterday: seeing
that is past ad a watch in the night.
As soon as Thou scatterest them, they are even as a sleep; and
fade away suddenly like the grass.
In the morning it is green, and groweth up; but in the evening
it is cut down, dried up, and withered.
For we consume away in Thy displeasure: and are afraid at Thy
wrathful indignation.
Thou hast set our misdeeds before Thee: and our secret sins in
the light of Thy countenance.
For when Thou art angry, all our days are gone: we bring our
years to an end} as it were a tale that is told.
The days of our age are three-score years and ten; and though
men be so strong, that they come to four-score years: yet is their
strength then but labour and sorrow; so soon passeth it away, and we
are gone.
But who regardeth the power of Thy wrath: for even thereafter
as a man feareth, so is Thy displeasure.
So teach us to number our days: that we may apply our hearts
unto wisdom.
Turn Thee again, O Lord, at the last: and be gracious unto Thy
servants.
O satisfy us with Thy mercy, and that soon: so shall we rejoice
and be glad all the days of our life.
Comfort us again now after the time that Thou has plagued us:
and for the years wherein we have suffered adversity.
Show Thy servants Thy Work: and their children Thy glory.
And the glorious majesty of the Lord our God be upon us:
prosper Thou the work of our hands upon us, O prosper Thou our
handy-work.
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son: and to the Holy Ghost.
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world
without end. Amen.
