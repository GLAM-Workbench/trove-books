The Museum is open for the inspection of the Public every Tuesday and
Friday, from 11 to 4, and Visitors are requested to insert their names in
a book kept at the Museum for that purpose.
Donations of Specimens of Natural History are requested for the Museum.


The Committee of the Australian Museum wish it to he understood
that the arrangement of the following Catalogue is wholly due to
the labors of the Secretary, who alone is responsible for the names
and synonyms attached to the specimens.
The object in publishing the Catalogue being to produce as early
as possible a list of the specimens contained in the Museum, it has
been consequently drawn up with some haste.
The habitat of the specimens merely refer to the locality where
the individual specimens were procured.

NATIVE ORNAMENTS, WEAPONS,
UTENSILS, &c.
COLLECTED BY T. L. MITCHELL, Esa. Surveyor-General,
In the Expedition into the Interior, in 1835.
No. I.—Casts of the Upper Part of the Head, apparently a
preparation of Sulphate of Lime. These were found over a
native burial-place, on the hill of Fort Bourke, beside a con-
siderable number of oval-shaped balls, (No. 2,) composed of a
similar substance.
2. —Oval-shaped Balls. These and the preceding have reference
to the memory of the dead, as explained by the natives at Fort
Bourke. Each ball is supposed to have been dedicated by a
mourner or survivor of some one of those buried below, probably
according to some superstitious ideas. No such balls were ever
seen at any of the other native burying-grounds near the Darling
or elsewhere lower down; and it seems probable, from the great
numbers found at one place, that an unusual mortality had
happened some years before, in the tribe by whom these balls
were deposited.
3. — Spears of Rosewood, (2.) One of these is broken. They were
both thrown at a bullock-driver, from an unseen hand, in a
scrub near the River Darling.
4. —Spears, from the Bogan.
6. —Hieleman, or Shield, from the Darling.
6. —Bomerang, from the Bogan.
Fragment of a Bomerang, from the Darling.
7. —Water-bucket, from the Darling, cut out from the protuberant
knot of a tree, and is a specimen of the ingenuity of the natives
in cutting very hard wood, with very simple tools.
8. —A Net, used on the banks of the Darling, for catching water-
fowl and other birds. These nets are usually made and carried,
by the females, or by young men when detached from a tribe.
Lofty poles are permanently erected at the most favorable places,


and usually opposite to a large tree; on these the net is sus-
pended, by means of which ducks are caught in great numbers.
This net is folded up with great skill in a particular way, so as
to be carried on a small stick, which the natives recommend
not to he removed without first observing how it was to be put
up again.
9.—A Mooo, ob Stone Hatchet, from the Darling.
COLLECTED BY C. M. LEWIS, ESQ.
Commanding the Government Schooner Isabella, in the late Expe-
dition to Torres’ Straits, in search of the survivors of the
Charles Eaton, 1836.
No. 1. — A LARGE AND RUDE IMITATION OF THE HUMAN HEAD, from
an island named Aureed, or Skull Island, around which several
skulls of both Europeans and natives were suspended, which
have been since detached, and deposited in the burial-ground at
Sydney. This figure is formed of plates of tortoise-shell, smeared
over with red ochre, and measures about between four and five
feet, by about two feet and a half. A semicircular projection
stands out from the forehead, also made of tortoiseshell fanci-
fully carved, and when taken from the Island was ornamented
with feathers. In the centre of the figure, from the projection
upwards, is a small bundle of broken arrows, bound together.
The eyes are formed by pieces of the pearly iridescent interior
of the Haliotis or Ear-shell; and around the figure several shells
were also arranged, consisting of the large Murex or Rock-shell
(Centronotus,) and the Egg-shell (Ovula ovum.) Many of
the skulls were attached to the figure by European cordage.
Several of the skulls bore marks of violence.
2. —Rudely carved Imitations of Fish, from the natives of Dewar
Island, one of the Murray group. One represents a fish of the
genus Choetodon; another the Remora, or Sucking-fish; and the
third appears to be a rude representation of that cetaceous
animal called the Duyong or Sea-cow, called by the Murray
Islanders, Diggar. The skulls and teeth of this animal have
been found on Wednesday Island, which confirms the precon-
ceived opinion of naturalists that a species of that animal would
be found to exist on the Australian coasts.
3. — Masks, used by the natives of Dewar Island in their dances.
One of these is intended to represent a turtle ; the others display
a frightful representation of the human countenance, rendered


still more so by being blackened and adorned with red and
white paint. Tastefully arranged cowrie shells, seeds of some
tree, dried leaves, and the handsome scarlet seeds of the climbing
Abrus precatorius, add to the adornment of the masks.
4. — Fillets for the Head, tastefully decorated with the feathers of
the cassowary, and used by the Murray Islanders as an orna-
ment in their dances. It is named by them, Sarm.
6.—Wooden Swords, from Dewar Island, evidently formed from
European models; which opinion is confirmed by the native
appellation being, Tabu ouss tulek, or belly-iron, (Tabu signi-
fying the belly ; ouss tulek, iron.)
6. —Bows, with Arrows, formed of bamboo, (the bow-strings being
also formed of the same material,) from the Murray Islands.
The bow is named Sirick by the natives; an arrow, Cap.
7. —An Armlet, used by the Murray Islanders to protect the arm
from the string of the bow, when using that weapon. They
name it Cuddiek in their language.
8. —Enormous Bamboo Fife, tastefully decorated, with a neatly-
carved bowl detached. It is used by the Murray Islanders for
smoking tobacco. The tobacco being placed in the bowl, the
large pipe is filled with the smoke, after which the bowl is
removed, and the retained smoke swallowed through the small
orifice, the native party passing it from one to the other until
its contents are exhausted, or they become stupilied. The pipe
is named by the natives Marrab; the same appellation is given
to the bamboo.
9. —Semicircular Ornaments, formed of a frame-work of slender
bamboos, and ingeniously and handsomely adorned with cowries.
They are used by the Murray Islanders in their dances.
10. —Singular Instruments, called Quiro or Cuiro, and used by
the Murray Islanders in their dances.
11. —Bundle of Mocko mocko, or Leg Ornaments, made from
the fibres of the root of the Ou, or cocoa-nut tree, and worn by
the Murray Islanders.
12. —Carved Figure, named Lope, and used by the Murray
Islanders merely for ornament.
13. — Carved Wooden Figures, from Darnley Island.
14. —Dress of Leaves, called Narsur, and worn by the females of
Darnley and Murray’s Island.


15. —Ornaments used liy the natives of Darnley Island for the bow
of their canoes; they are decorated with cowrie and egg shells,
and bunches of cassowary feathers.
16. — Semicircular Breast Ornament of Mother-of-pearl, worn by
the Murray Islanders.
