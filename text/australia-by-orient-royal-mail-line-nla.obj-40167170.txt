To AUSTRALIA
'THE route to Aus-
tralia followed by
the Steamers of the
OR I ENT - ROYAL
MAIL LINE affords
a great variety of
scene. The numer-
ous ports at which
the vessels call save
the voyage from
tedium and monotony
At the same time
opportunity is affor-
ded to the voyager of
at least a passing
glimpse of many in-
teresting places. From the
time the Steamers leave
London till they arrive at Brisbane, 48
days later, no less than eleven calls are
by ORIENT-ROYAL MAIL LINE.
PLYMOUTH, FROM DRAKE'S ISLAND.
made, and with the exception of Suez, itself of little interest, on each occasion the passengers
can, under ordinary circumstances, land and get a brief experience of countries foreign to
them.


The ORIENT-ROYAL MAIL LINE Steamers leave London on alternate Fridays and
Plymouth the following day, and call at
GIBRALTAR,
MARSEILLES,
NAPLES,
PORT SAID,
SUEZ,
COLOMBO,
FREMANTLE,
ADELAIDE,
MELBOURNE,

GIBRALTAR.
I—IIGH up the rock, near the serrated
1 skyline, will here and there be
detected eaves and holes which open
behind into long galleries, most of which
are armed in tiers like the port holes of an
old wooden ship of war. Lower down
there is beautiful, sub tropical vegetation,
and the Alameda soon comes in sight, with
more forts and batteries, this time at the
water’s edge. The passenger landing here
for a few hours will find the Governor’s
Chapel, with its interesting memorial
tablets, the Cathedral, in a beautiful
garden, an ancient Spanish Church, the
Library, also with a fine garden, and the
Fruit and Flower Markets, worthy of his
attention.
GIBRALTAR.


MARSEILLES.
THE scenery around Marseilles is very beautiful. The town itself is a thriving business
centre, and a few days there can be well filled in sightseeing.
LA CANNEBIERE MARSEILLES


NAPLES.
where the English mails for
Australia are taken on board, has
many sights to show, Vesuvius, Pompeii,
and Herculaneum among the number, A
whole day is usually spent here on the out
ward voyage. The passenger should not
miss visiting the Museum, where all the
chief treasures found at the buried cities
are shown. The ancient bronzes are a
revelation of what bronzes can be, and
are themselves worth any journey one
may have to make to see them.
NAPLES.
SUEZ CANAL.
M. LESSEPS’ great engineering work has done so much for the commerce of the world that
the traveller cannot fail to be interested in his first transit of the famous Canal. By
day and night there is a constant stream of vessels of all nationalities. During a recent twelve
months 4,267 vessels, representing a tonnage of 14,728,434, passed through the Canal, and
it is interesting to note that of these, 2,621 vessels, representing 9,495,868 tons, were British.
Port Said is the greatest coaling station on the ocean highway to and from the East. The.
vast stores of coal form in themselves a marvellous sight.


PORT SAID.
Egypt, with its wonderful winter climate, its wonderful sights, its associations -historical,
philological, artistic, and scientific-can be safely recommended to any traveller who can linger
there, even for a few days.
