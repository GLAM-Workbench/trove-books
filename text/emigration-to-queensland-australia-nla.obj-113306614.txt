Much enquiry has lately been made about Emigration to Queensland. Many have
a strong inclination to go, but hesitate from one cause or other to do so. Here are pj
a few of the difficulties in the way
It is hard to leave Old England. —But Queensland is only England over the r
water, with English people, customs and religion. It has greater freedom, cheaper g
food and higher wages. EH
Attachment to the Old Fireside. — This is all right when the cupboard is well 43
supplied, the rent easily met and the income sure. But the persevering ones here g*
may, by a little saving in Australia, get a comfortable Freehold House for themselves,
Leaving Friends Behind. —It is well to cling to our own. Yet that sometimes 0
helps to pull them lower down, or drag ourselves down. How many sons and g
daughters, by emigration, have blessed aged parents and sick relatives ! c 3
Fear of the Sea. —The furrows of the ocean are not so straight and firm as those m
on land, though enjoyable enough after the first day. Women have better health at
sea than on land, and the Australian voyage is a fair weather one. The cowardly
must stay here and lose the good things there. ©
The Voyage— Only vessels of the highest class are engaged by the Government to
carry their passengers. It is the safest and pleasantest voyage in the World. A £
Doctor attends passengers without charge.
Strangers in a Strange Land. —Not at all. Upon arrival in port, board and
lodging are provided for all till a situation or work is found. Employers pay expenses £
to a place. Colonists are always kind to new comers.
Clim4Tß. —Is healthy and enjoyable. Death rate considerably less than in England.

Because there are better opportunities, more scope and better pay. g
Because daughters by going out can help their' aged parents at home,
Because girls have excellent wages, good treatment in families, with the prospect of
a comfortable home of their own.
Because it is from servants leaving their places to become mistresses that wages J 4
keep up so well. §

Because married life there can be looked forward to with less anxiety than here.
Think seriously, decide promptly, and carry out your resolution boldly. ®
