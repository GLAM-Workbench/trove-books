The following Lecture was one of the Course arranged by
the Committee of the Congregational Union and Mission of
Victoria, in connexion with the Bicentenary Celebration of
Bartholomew?s Day, 1662. It was delivered in Victoria Parade
Church, on the 24th July, and subsequently in several sub-
urban churches. It is now published by special request.


ACT OF UNIFORMITY.
A style of gardening was at one time very much in fashion t
which was originally borrowed from Holland. Dutch gardeners,
not being satisfied with the diversified forms which they found
in the vegetable world, determined to improve upon nature?s
handiwork. That trees and shrubs should send out branches
and shoots in various directions and in defiance of all rule,
was to them a matter which needed correction. They accord-
ingly hit upon the notable expedient of clipping these irregular
children of nature into shape. Pines and cypresses, yews and
firs, which before had each their peculiar growth and develop
ment, now assumed regular and precise forms. In those ? trim
gardens ? in which gentlemen in Milton?s days ? took their
pleasure,? this fashion generally prevailed. The yews parted
with their rugged outline and became ?dipt Dutch dragons,?
the firs assumed the forms of peacocks or of lions, the privet
hedges were squared and trimmed with such mathematical pre-
cision that they scarcely seemed to consist of shrubs, and the
cypresses were so hardly dealt with that they looked like no-
thing but large green sugar-loaves set upon poles. This fantastic
fashion in horticulture has, happily, been long since abandoned ,
we in the present day have begun to doubt whether it is possi-
ble for man thus to remedy the defects of creation and rectify
the errors of Omniscience, and so we leave the trees to take
their own forms and think them all the more beautiful for it.
But although the Dutch gardeners have ceased to be authorities
in gardening, yet have they furnished us with an example of a
common and almost world-wide tendency of humanity, and a
warning against letting that tendency have too much sway.
We are all more or less in love with uniformity. If a child has
some beads it will most likely try to place them in a row and at
equal distances apart, and with us, children of a larger growth,
whether we arrange the books on our shelves, the furniture in


our rooms, or the wares in our shops, we all aim at uniformity.
And in public and national affairs the same tendency is dis-
played. The history of our own country, to go no further, is to
a great extent a history of attempts to regulate and make
uniform the proceedings alike of the governors and the gov-
erned. With the zeal and perseverance of Dutch gardeners,
kings and parliaments have practised their experiments on
humanity, and with no better success; and just as the trees
rebelled against the mangling of their Dutch tormentors, and
would not submit to such barbarous usage?no, not for a day,
so has humanity risen up against those who would impose upon
it one uniform pattern, and has well nigh shaken off the
meddling tyrants by whom it has been oppressed. History
does not furnish us with any more notable instance of Dutch
gardening with humanity than the attempt in 1662 to impose
uniformity in public worship upon our English forefathers.
This was the end proposed by the promoters of the Act of
Uniformity. I have undertaken to lecture on the antecedents
and results of this monstrous and absurd enactment, and must
ask you in the first instance to go back with me to a much
earlier period than 1662, that we may attempt to discover when
and how such legislation began. The history of the Act of
Uniformity is intimately connected with that of the Common
Prayer Book, and we must therefore take a glance at each of
the periods when that book was published, revised, re-published,
re-revised, and finally re-revised again, two centuries ago. In
doing this we shall have to begin our survey at the Eeforma-
tion under Henry VIII., and then pass from one ecclesiastical
eminence to another, leaving the vast and varied landscape of
English history quite unexplored below.
Henry the VUlth, having disposed of Luther and received
the title of ? Defender of the Faith ? from the Pope, began to
turn his attention to domestic affairs. In his early manhood
he had married Catherine of Arragon, his brother?s widow: and
whether his royal conscience was oppressed with the thought
that marriage with a deceased brother?s wife was illegal, or
whether Catherine was not exactly in accordance with his
tastes, certain it is that he begun to entertain the ? kingly and
conscientious desire to possess a younger and a fairer wife.?
But to get divorced from Catherine the Pope must be applied
to; and accordingly Henry besought his holiness to relieve the
conscience of his royal suppliant and release him from the


marriage contract as well. Had the Pope been really what he
pretended to be, God?s vicegerent upon earth, Henry would have
had no difficulty in gaining his end. But Catherine was related
to the monarch who then ruled one half of Christendom?the
Emperor Charles the Fifth?and the Pope was far too good a
judge of his own interest and safety to run the risk of offending
him; and therefore Henry?s suit must be delayed, and the col-
lege of cardinals consulted. In this state of affairs Henry began
to cast about for other means of getting rid of his queen,
Cranmer had been lately introduced to the king as one who had
something to say about the divorce. Could not the Pope?s au-
thority be dispensed with ? Might not a convocation of English
clergy be called and induced to pronounce the marriage invalid ?
These were Cranmer?s suggestions, and no sooner did Henry
perceive that his suit at Rome was hopeless than he adopted
Cranmer?s plan. Parliament was easily led to pass an act
declaring the Pope?s authority at an end in England, and con-
stituting Henry VIII. ?of whom it has been truly said that
he never spared man in his anger nor woman in his lust?
Supreme Head of the Church ! Convocation was speedily called
together, the divorce granted, and poor Anne Boleyn became
queen. Thus, actuated only by the basest motives, possessed
with no other desire than that of gratifying his passions, Henry
shook off the papal yoke and removed one mighty obstacle to
the English Reformation. Whilst England had been connected
with Rome, a large amount of liberty in religious matters was
enjoyed alike by clergy and people. The prejudice against the
Pope as a foreign potentate was always strong enough, from the
days of John downward, to prevent any very stringent super-
vision over the English portion of his flock. And thus men
like Wickliffe and Latimer were frequently to he found among
the beneficed clergy?men who preached a gospel as pure as that
of apostolic times. The influence of such men had been widely
felt,-and the news of Henry?s quarrel with the Pope was re-
ceived with general satisfaction by his subjects. In fact,
the teachings of Wickliffe, and the printing of an English
version of the Bible, had prepared the mind of the
nation for a change in matters of religion. But Henry
was filled with no such desire, he wished to change nothing but
the supremacy. He merely wished to occupy the place in the
Church of England which the Pope had hitherto filled. Refor-
mation, in our sense of the word, was the furthest fx-oin his


royal mind. He and his statesmen regarded the Church of
England as ? a waif or a stray,? which having drifted away from
the shores of the papacy naturally became, like all other un-
claimed goods, the property of the crown* The people soon
began to discover that in exchanging one pope for another they
had not made a very notable bargain. To he sure the creed, and
the ten commandments were published in English by the king?s
command, and soon after the entire liturgy; but the peopl
were enjoined to believe only what the king and his bishops
should order them, and they were required to conduct their
worship only in the way which the same authority should pre-
scribe. Nor were these all the grievances of the people. It was
reported that many persons were in the habit of going to those
churches where copies of Tindal?s Bible were to be seen, and
there reading in their own tongue the simple word of God.
This could not be permitted. What would become of the king?s
supremacy if this went on ? The matter must be immediately
attended to, and so a lawf was made enacting That Tindal?s
translation of the Bible should be prohibited?that reading of
the Bible in English in churches should not be permitted?that
no women artificers, prentices, servingmen, husbandmen, nor la-
bourers, should read the New Testament in English, and that
nothing should be taught or maintained contrary to the king?s
instructions. And further if any spiritual person?d.e, clergyman
?should preach, teach or maintain anything contrary to the
King?s instructions or determinations made 'or to be made,
and should be thereof convict, he should for the first offence,
recant; for the second offence, abjure and bear a faggot; and,
for the third, be judged a heretic and be burned, and lose all
his goods and chattels?the lawmakers being evidently under
the impression, that unless they ordered otherwise, the burnt
heretic might take his goods and chattels with him. This was
the people?s first experience of their new Pope. But, in pre-
scribing thus carefully the religious beliefs and practices of the
nation, in passing laws, which to us seem not less tyrannical
than absurd, the legislators of those days were doing nothing at
all unusual. Keligion was not alone in being thus dealt with,
The State meddled with almost every department of public,
social, intellectual, and moral life. Trade fared no better than
religion. In the very session in which Tindal?s Bible was pro-

scribed, a law was passed, which enacted: ? That no person
shall put to sale any pins, but only such as shall be double-
headed, and have the heads soldered fast to the shank of the
pin, well smoothed, the shank well shaven, the point well
rounded, filed, and sharpened.?* Another provided: ? That
? every artificer of the mystery of coopers mayf take for every
beer-barrel by him sold, lOd, and for every beer kilderkin, 6d.?
Then there was an act, prescribing that no woollen cloths
should be made of a greater length than 18 yards, and another,
prohibiting the fishermen of the eastern coast from selling
their fish to the highest bidder. There was an act too, against
? fond and fantastic prophesying,? whatever that may have
been ; but the phrase suggests the idea that, if Dr. Gumming had
lived in those days, he would have had to keep his ? great
tribulations? to himself. But the remark which Hallam makes
of an earlier period in English history, will apply with almost
equal force to this. He tells us, speaking of Edward lll.?s
time, that many of the laws then made were tentative and
experimental, and either never enforced, or if enforced at first
and found inconvenient, were soon suffered to become obsolete.
Some notable instances are on record, of laws being made and
immediately violated. In Edward lll.?s reign, an act was
passed, prohibiting the carrying of wool out of the kingdom.
But very soon after, wool was plentiful in England and scarce
on the Continent, and the King, in spite of the act in question,
purchased a large quantity and shipped it off to Brabant.
At the period we are speaking of, although laws were not
thus openly defied, yet many were enforced for a time, found
mischievous, and then repealed. Two sessions after the passing
of the act to regulate the manufacture and sale of pins,
another act appears upon the statute-book J, the preamble of
which, naively sets forth, ? that, whereas an act was passed
regulating the sale and manufacture of pins, and forasmuch as
since the making of the said act there hath been scarcity of
pins within this realm, that the King?s liege people have not
been well or competently served of such pins nor are likely to
be served?therefore the said act shall be repealed.? But in
this experimental legislation religion was placed at a great
disadvantage. If a stupid law were passed affecting trade?

fixing the character of pins, the price of beer-barrels, or the
size and quality of stuffs, the mischievous effects of such a law
were soon felt, and those affected by it ceased not to complain
until it was repealed; But the evils of legislative meddling
with religion were not so apparent; statesmen and rulers did
not always possess the qualities of mind and heart necessary for
their detection ; while those who were the greatest sufferers
were always a minority possessing but small influence in the
councils of state. And thus, while almost every law of this
kind affecting trade, dress, learning, and the everyday duties
and employments of life, has been repealed, laws imposing
civil disabilities and pecuniary penalties on account of religious
belief, remain to the present day, as foul blots on the statute-
book of England.
At the death of Henry, the guardians of Edward VI.
became the rulers of the nation, and Cranmer the virtual head
of the Church. That prelate may be justly regarded as the
founder of the Anglican establishment. Holding views de-
cidedly Protestant, he was at the same time most anxious to
conciliate the adherents of the old religion, and the marks of
the compromise which he effected are still plainly visible in
the constitution, the doctrines, and the liturgy, of the Church
of England. The Book of Common Prayer was then prepared
and promulgated?which Edward VI. assured some Cornish
men who rebelled against the use of it, was only the old Mass
book done into English with some slight alterations?and for
the first time an act was passed prescribing uniformity in
public worship.* This act provided that every minister should
use the Liturgy in the services of the Church under certain
penalties. ? Punch ? was not then one of the institutions of
the land ; but the native love of fun found modes in which to
express itself, and ridicule was heaped upon everything which
the populace disliked. The Common Prayer Book was not
likely to escape ; and, so, the act provided that any person who
should, by interludes, plays, or rhymes, or by other spoken
words declare or speak anything in derogation, depravation, or
despising of the said book, or of anything therein contained,
should, for the first offence forfeit ï¿½10; for the second, ï¿½2O ;
and for the 3rd, be imprisoned for life. This was the first Act
of Uniformity, which was not to be made fun of nor despised.
But, like the trees under the hands of the Dutch gardeners,
* 2 and 3 Edward VI., o. 1.


the people soon began to show that they were living, and could
not so easily be clipped into shape. Four years? trial of the
first act of uniformity only exhibited its utter insufficiency to
fulfil the end for which it was designed. The gardeners must
try their hands again, perhaps the trees will leave off growing
by-and-bye. So, in 1552 another act makes its appearance,*
the preamble of which sets forth, that great numbers of persons,
in divers parts of the realm, following their own sensuality,
and living either without knowledge or due fear of God, do
wilfully abstain and refuse to come to their parish churches ;
and then enacts, that every person shall resort to his parish
church; and then goes on to say, that, whereas divers doubts
have arisen in respect of the Book of Common Prayer, the
King hath caused the same to be faithfully and godly perused,
explained and made fully perfect ! But we should err
egregiously, if we were to conclude, from this legislation, that all
the clergy were of one mind. Almost all shades of opinion on
doctrine and discipline found representatives and advocates
among them. The opinions of some of the bishops are thus placed
together by Macaulay : ? Bishop Hooper, who died manfully at
Gloucester for his religion, long refused to wear the episcopal vest-
ments. Bishop Ridley, a martyr of still greater renown, pulled
down the altars of his diocese, and ordered the Eucharist to
be administered in the middle of churches, at tables which the
Papists irreverently termed oyster-boards. Bishop Jewell pro-
nounced the clerical garb to be a stage dress, a fool?s coat, a
relic of the Amorites, and promised that he would spare no
labor to extirpate such degrading absurdities. Archbishop
Grindal long hesitated about accepting a mitre, from dislike of
what he regarded as the mummery of consecration. Bishop
Parkhurst uttered a fervent prayer, that the Church of Eng-
land _ would propose to herself the Church of Zurich as the
absolute pattern of a Christian community. Bishop Ponet
was of opinion that the word bishop should be abandoned to
the Papists, and that the chief officer of the purified church
should be called superintendent. Cranmer plainly avowed his
conviction that, in the primitive times, there was no distinc-
tion between bishops and priests, and that the laying on of
hands was altogether unnecessary.?! With bishops holding such
different opinions as these what hope could there be of uni-

formity? But, nevertheless, it must be attempted?old Fuller
tells us with what success. Speaking of this period, in his
Church History, he says? Come we now to the saddest dif-
ference that ever happened in the Church of England, if we
consider the time how long it continued, the eminent persons
therein engaged, or the doleful effects thereby produced. It
was about matters of conformity. Alas! that men should
have less wisdom than locusts, which, when sent on God s
errands ? did not thrust one anotherwhereas, here, such
shoving and shouldering, and hoisting and heaving, and
jostling and thronging, betwixt clergymen of the highest parts
and places; for now, nonconformity in the days of King
Edward was conceived, which, afterward, in the reign of Queen
Mary (but beyond sea, at Frankfort), was born ; which, in the
reign of Elizabeth, was nursed and weaned; which, under King
James grew up a young youth, or tall stripling; but towards
the end of King Charles his reign, shot up to the full strength
and stature of a man, able not only to cope with, but conquer
the hierarchy, its adversary.? * Fuller goes on to describe the
two parties, and calls Bishop Hooper the leader of the Non-
conformists. Thus, within the church, as by law established,
the men who were afterwards called Puritans, occupied high
places, and from its very foundation, Presbyterians as well as
Episcopalians, were to be found among the clergy. With Mary,
Popery again got the upper hand, and one of the first acts of
her first Parliament was, to repeal the statutes of uniformity
passed by her predecessor. If there were any in those days
who held the Erastrian doctrine, viz.that religion should be
national, and that it is the duty of a good subject to be of the
same faith as his rulers, the advent of Mary presented an
excellent opportunity for displaying adherence to it. But
Ridley, and Latimer, and their martyr brethren, could sub-
scribe to no such pernicious and absurd doctrine as that. Al-
though not perceiving as clearly as we do, who have the light
of the last three centuries to guide us, to what their protest
against state-imposed religion pointed, they yet were so firmly
convinced that truth and right were on their side, that the
faggot and the stake had no terrors for them ; and brave old
Latimer, one of the best and noblest of our English forefathers,
in words which now, seem prophetic, could exclaim : ?? Be of

good cheer, Master Ridley, for we shall light up such a fire to-
day, as by God?s grace as shall never be extinguished.?
On the accession of Elizabeth, the ecclesiastical legislation
of her sister was reversed, and the church was restored to the
condition in which Edward VI. had left it. The Prayer Book
was again revised, ?the perfection promised by Edward?s last
statute not having been secured, ?and the second Act of Uni-
formity became law. This act was almost identical with that
of Edward, required the Prayer Book to be used throughout
the realm under certain penalties, but did not bind the clergy
to any declaration of assent either to its doctrines or its rubric.
Many of the Puritan clergy had fled to the Continent during
the rigors of Mary's reign, and now returned, with their views
enlarged by contact with the disciples of Calvin and Zuingle,
and less disposed than ever to adopt a religious belief at the
bidding of the Crown. On matters of doctrine, the diversities
of opinion were not so great or serious, but on matters of dis-
cipline and practice the breach seemed to be continually widen-
ing between the two parties. Three hundred years ago this
year?in 1562, the convocation of the clergy assembled to con-
sider matters of doctrine and draw up articles to which all
could subscribe. The articles, which had been forty-two in
Edward?s time, were now reduced to thirty-nine, and adopted,
not altogether unanimously nor without reservation, for two of
the bishops, it is said, did not subscribe at all; and while the
upper house, the bishops, declared in their subscription that
the doctrines of the articles were true and orthodox, the lower
house, where the Puritans were almost as numerous as their
opponents, merely subscribed them as a statement of the gene-
ral opinion of the Church, But when this same convocation
came to consider matters of discipline and practice, the con-
flicting elements within it soon displayed themselves. Bishop
Sandys had drawn up six propositions, in which the Puritan
views on the principal points of difference were stated. These
propositions were submitted to the lower house by one of the
Puritan clergy; the discussion on them lasted many hours, and
on a division it was found that there were forty-three for, and
thirty-five against; but the thirty-five had more proxies in
their pockets than the forty-three, and the result was, fifty-
eight for, fifty-nine against; the Puritan propositions were
thus rejected by one! and that the vote of a person not pre-
sent ! Had these propositions been carried, how different might


have been the subsequent history of the church. It is not for us,
however, to indulge in ?fond and fantastic prophesies? of
what might have been. This proceeding of convocation in
1562, is chiefly of importance to us as showing that the High
Churchmen and the Puritans were at that time so evenly
balanced, that the latter could be defeated only by a majority
of one; and as furnishing us with one of the best proofs that
the pretensions to exclusive rights to the emoluments of the
Church, which were afterwards put forward by the High Church
party, were as arrogant as they were unjust.
We have been journeying up to this time over comparatively
level country, with here and there a rising ground to arrest
our steps ; we are now getting into the hill country, and
it is hard to choose which mountain peak on whicSi to fix
our gaze. 1570 looms up large before us. Subscription to the
articles was then for the first time required by law; any clergy-
man who refused must lose his preferment. No form of sub-
scription was imposed by this act,?men could express their
approval in as general or precise a way as they pleased. But
there were many of the sturdier Puritans who would not bind
themselves by any human statements of their faith. ? Father
John Fox,? says Fuller, ? was summoned by Archbishop Parker
to subscribe, that the general reputation of his piety might
give the greater countenance to conformity.? The old man
produced the New Testament in Greek. ?To this,? saith he,
? will I subscribe.? But when a subscription to the canons was
required of him he refused it saying, ? I have nothing in the
church but a prebend at Salisbury, and much good may it
do you if you will take it away from me.? ? However,? conti-
nues Fuller, ?such respect did the bishop bear to his age,
parts and pains, that he continued his place till the day of his
death.?* Others were less fortunate, and were driven from their
homes, and many from their native land. Had our Bartho-
lomew course of lectures been complete, it would have com-
prised one on Archbishop Whitgift. In 1583, he succeded the
mild and half puritan Grindal, who would not prohibit preach-
ing at the bidding of the queen, and was suspended from his
see for his contumacy. Whitgift was quite another sort of man;
a worthy predecessor of Laud and Sheldon, and the most
notable ecclesiastical Dutch gardener reformed England had

seen. He very soon began to set his clergy to rights. Not con-
tent with enforcing subscription to the articles, he imposed
additional ones drawn up by himself. ? One of these prohibited
all preaching, reading, or catecnising in private houses, whereto
any not of the same family should resort, ? seeing the same was
never permitted as lawful under any Christian magistrate.?
But that which excited the loudest complaints was the subscrip-
tion to the three points, the Queen?s supremacy, the lawfulness
of the common prayer and ordination service, and the truth of
the whole thirty-nine articles, exacted from every minister of
the church.?* It is possible that the canon law sanctioned this
arbitrary conduct of the archbishop; but Hallam is disposed to
regard it as an illegal stretch of power. The ordinary ecclesias-
tical courts were too slow and precise in their procedure to
suit the fiery zeal of the archbishop. The court of High Com-
mission was, therefore, established, by which the old fashioned
securities of English law were set aside, and the model of which
was the Spanish Inquisition. ? Master of such tremendous
machinery,? I quote from Hallam, ? the archbishop proceeded
to call into action one of its powers, contained for the first time
in the present commission, by tendering what was technically
styled the oath ex-officio to such of the clergy as were surmised
to harbour a spirit of puritanical disaffection. This procedure
which was wholly founded on the canon law, consisted in a
series of interrogations, so comprehensive as to embrace the
whole scope of clerical uniformity, yet so precise and minute as
to leave no room for evasion, to which the suspected party was
bound to answer upon oath. So repugnant was this to the
rules of our English law and to the principles of national equity,
that no species of ecclesiastical tyranny seems to have excited
so much indignation. Lord Burleigh, who, though at first,
rather friendly to Whitgift, was soon disgusted by his intolerant
and arbitrary behaviour, wrote in strong terms of remonstrance
against these articles of examination, as so curiously penned, so
full of branches and circumstances, as he thought the inquisitors
of Spain used not so many questions to comprehend and trap
their preys.?f Wholesale ejectments of the puritan clergy
now took place?ejectments which those who taunt us with
?Walker?s Sufferings of the Clergy,? always keep carefully out
of view. 233 ministers, says Neal, were suspended in only six

counties. ? The puritans, he continues, formed so much the
more learned and diligent part of the clergy, that a great
scarcity of preachers was experienced throughout this reign
that of Elizabeth?in consequence of silenceing so many of the
former. Thus, in Cornwall about the year 1578, out of 140
clergymen, not one was capable of preaching. And in general
the number of those who could not preach, hut only read the
service, was to the others as nearly four to one ?the preachers
being a majority only in London.?* And London it must he
borne in mind, was so notorious as the stronghold of the
Reformers, both in Church and State, that Elizabeth and James
both strove to prevent its increase by prohibiting the building
of any more houses! The statements I have quoted from
Neal may be deemed by some an instance of Neal?s pre-
judice. ? But,? says Hallam, speaking of these very state-
ments, ? that historian is not so ill informed as they suppose;
and the fact is highly probable. Let it be remembered that
there existed few books of Divinity in English ; that all books
were, comparatively to the value of money, far dearer than at
present; that the majority of the clergy were nearly illiterate,
and many of them addicted to drunkenness and low vices;
above all that they had no means of supplying their deficiencies
by preaching the discourses of others; and we shall see little cause
for doubting Neal?s statement, though founded on a puritan docu-
ment.?f A writer in the Edinburgh Review speaking of Whitgift
and his doings, says? The consequences of the policy which
he inaugurated were the alienation from the National Church of
thousands, besides those whom he ejected of the bolder and more
independent spirits, and the intellectual and moral deterioration
of almost all who remained within; consequences which bore
their worst fruits half a century afterwards in the strong anti-
pathies and mutual intolerance which marked contending par-
ties in the civil wars; consequences which have been perpetuated
though in a milder form even to our own day, and are still
reproduced by the refusal of the Church to abandon the policy
then hegun.?J
The Church of England, in spite of all this Dutch gardening,
was not yet of one mind; she was not even entirely episcopal ;
numbers of Presbyterians were still to be found in the ranks of

the ministers; and in 1590 there was said to he a scheme on
foot to make all persons in office subscribe a declaration that
episcopacy was lawful, but Lord Burleigh prevented it being
carried out. We owe a debt of gratitude to Burleigh, Walsing-
ham, and some others of the distinguished ministers of Eliza-
beth, for their large and statesmanslike views on ecclesiastical
affairs. But Elizabeth was every inch a queen; she would have
in her court, and throughout her realm of England, but one
mistress and no master, and especially would she not brook any
interference with her prerogative of meddling with the affairs
of the church. And thus Burleigh was compelled to witnesss
harsh and unjustifiable proceedings which he would not prevent,
but the evils of which he did not cease to expose. But we must
hurry on.
The great queen was laid with her fathers, and a pe-
dantic, unprincipled, talkative, tyrannical jack-pudding, was
on the throne. As James came to London from Scotland, he
was presented with a petition signed by a thousand of the Puri-
tan clergy praying for reform in the church. Then took place
that celebrated Hampton Court Conference, in which James
exhibited his theological knowledge or ignorance, and where the
bishops disgraced themselves by their fawning and flattery.
One of the Puritans pointed out the obvious meaning of the
words in the baptismal service, that baptismal regeneration was
intended by them. The Bishop of Worcester naively replied,
that the compilers of this book did not so intend them, but
that ?they propounded them ambiguously because otherwise,
perhaps, the book would not then have passed the parliament.?*
A very candid admission: but not at all calculated to raise the
book or its compilers in the estimation of any lovers of honesty
and truth. The king having heard the points upon which the
Puritans sought reform said, ? If this be all your party hath to
say, I-will make them conform themselves, or else I will harry
them out of the kingdom, or do worse.f The particulars of this
extraordinary conference should be read in Fuller. Throughout
it there was not the slightest desire exhibited by the King and
the bishops to take one step towards reconciliation with the re.
forming party. Conscious of power, the bishops snubbed and
insulted the Puritan deputies, and the king was mean enough

to abuse his high position and answer their arguments with
coarse and stupid jokes. Hallam tells us, that the chief man in
this Puritan deputation which the king thus bullied and
abused, Dr. Reynolds, was nearly if not altogether the most
learned man in England* But let us do what justice we can
to James. He had been crammed with the covenant in Scotland
until his stomach revolted against it, and he detested Presbyter-
ianism with all his heart. He understood that the chief aim of
the Puritans was, to make the Church of England, Presbyterian.
A Scottish Presbytery, he said, ? as well agreeth with a monarch
as God and the Devil. Then, Jack and Tom, and Will and
Dick shall meet, and at their pleasure censure me and my
counsels and all my proceedings; then Will shall stand
up and say ?lt must be thus ?; then Dick shall reply,
* Nay, marry, but we will have it thus.? And, therefore, here
must I reiterate my former speech, ?Le Roi s?avisera; ?
stay, I pray you, for one seven years before you demand
that of me; and if then you find me pursy and fat,
and my wind pipes stuffed, I will, perhaps, hearken to you.
, . . But Dr. Reynolds till you find that I grow lazy, let that
alone.?f
The conference ended in nothing. Bancroft, the new arch-
bishop, enforced Whitgift?s articles, and the ejectments went on.
Many of the Puritan clergy having reconciled it with their
consciences to subscribe these articles on the plea that they were
submitting to the powers that be, a new form was devised with
the express view of driving them out; in which the expression
? willingly and ex ammo,'? appears for the first time. ? And this
fresh form of subscription,? says the writer I have already
quoted in the Edinburgh Review, ? having been made obligatory
upon all preachers, teachers, catechisers, &c., even those who
had passed through the former ordeal, England was once more
doomed to witness a wholesale ejectment of her most
conscientious ministers.? The High Church party were becom-
ing infatuated, were hastening on a change. The Book of
Sports was ordered to be read by every minister. The ? harry-
ing out of the kingdom, or else worse,? went on unceasingly
until the time of retribution came, and the avenger in the shape
of the Long Parliament appeared. Under that king who, ?if he

had not been a knave, would never have been a martyr,? Arch-
bishop Laud and Strafford presisted in their efforts to bring
about what Strafford called ? Thorough,? and by which he meant
a thorough despotism in Church and State. The godly ministers
in the eastern counties were exposed to the fiercest persecu-
tion. Wren, Bishop of Norwich, a man after Laud?s own heart,
would have no preaching, no extempore, or as he called it
? conceived prayer,? would suffer nothing but the prayer book.
But the Long Parliament had got the mastery; Laud and Straf-
ford were brought to a terrible reckoning for their attempt to
convert England into another Turkey, and Englishmen into
slaves. Bishop Wren, too, was impeached at the bar of the
House of Lords. Sir T. Widdrington conducted the impeach-
ment on behalf of the Commons, and charged the bishop with
driving out of their livings, fifty ? godly preaching ministers? for
not reading the Book of Sports, for using conceived prayers be-
fore and after sermon, and for not observing some other illegal
innovations which Wren had introduced. What scandals were
created by his acts, continued Sir Thomas Widdrington, your
lordships will readily perceive by one incident which I will re-
late. ? A butcher was gored in the belly by an ox. The wound
was cured, and the man desired public thanksgiving in the
congregation; the minister finding no form for that purpose,
read the collects for the churching of women.?* The Parliament
next established the Presbyterian form of church-government
and worship, and episcopacy was driven from the Church of
England. High Church partizans are now in the habit of de-
claiming most loudly against the iniquity and injustice of this
act. So long as the powers that be were under the control of
the bishops, the bishops did not fail to use them on their own
behalf; now that the Presbyterians were uppermost they did
but imitate the very bad example which their episcopal brethren
had set them. I cannot, for the life of me, see how those who
approve of the efforts of Whitgift and Laud to cram the 39
articles, and three more besides, down the throat of the nation,
can object to the Presbyterians attempting a similar opera-
tion with the ? Solemn League and Covenant.? We, as
a denomination, had nothing to do with either of these pro-
ceedings, except to resist and protest against both, and suffer
for so doing. The Parliament set to work in earnest?one Mr.

0. Cromwell was a member of it ?set to work to purge tbe pul-
pits of the illiterate, drunken, and debauched clergy who dis-
graced them, and to substitute the godly preaching ministers
whom Laud and Wren had turned out. Walker, who is
an authority in some quarters, tells us it was for adherence
to the King these men were expelled for what was called
malignity. Let us see what was malignity, Sibthorp and
Mainwaring were malignants: let us see in what their
malignity consists. They taught in their sermons, says
Hallam, ? that the King might take the subject?s money at his
pleasure, and that no one might refuse his demand on penalty
of damnation ?! * Malignant enough I should think? men
who, instead of preaching simple Christ to simple men, treated
them to such pernicious and blasphemous rubbish as this. Far
too malignant to be endured in a country where Mr. Oliver
Cromwell had some influence in Parliament.f What else could
be done with such malignants, but drive them out and
order them to be quiet. And this is all the religious perse-
cution that can be charged against Cromwell. ? I do not know,?
says Hallam, ? that any member of the Church of England
was imprisoned under the Commonwealth, except for some
political reason; certain it is that the gaols were not filled with
them.? And during the years of Cromwell?s power, although
the Act of Uniformity was a dead letter, and the ?Solemn League
and Covenant ? was not enforced, there was more of religious
liberty in England and certainly more preaching of the gospel
than had ever been before, and than was again enjoyed until
more than a century after. ?I do not believe,? said Baxter
writing in 1658, just after the Protector?s death, ?that ever
England had so able and faithful a ministry since it was a
nation, as it hath this day; and I fear that few nations on
earth, if any, have the like. Sure lam the change is so great
within these twelve years, that it is one of the greatest joys that
ever I had in the world to behold it.?| But poor Baxter?s re-
joicing was doomed to be very short-lived. The restoration of
1660, proved a restoration not only of the monarch, but a re-
storation of the worst forms of vice and tyranny, both in Church
and State, which had characterised the rule of the first two
Stuarts. The declaration from Breda, which promised liberty

to tender consciences, and the repetition of it which issued from
Whitehall, made things look at first fair and promising. The Con
vention Parliament which had voted the King hack, and in
which the Presbyterians had a majority, desired to settle the
question of religion. The matter was debated until after dark?
a very unusual occurrence in those days; amongst others who
expressed great anxiety for the settlement of the Church, was
Sir A. A. Cooper, afterwards that Earl of Shaftesbury who
admitted that, ? for a subject, he was the wickedest dog in the
kingdom.? The court party and those members who were
prompted by the bishops, did not wish that Parliament to have
anyth ing to do with the settlement; they knew that in the red
hot loyalty of the nation, they would get a far more subservient
parliament if this were dissolved, so they tried all means to
stave off a decision. Candles were brought in, the record tells
us, and with difficulty preserved-the younger courtiers, rn
fact, blew them out; twice were they relit, but by sheer force of per-
severance and clamour, the courtiers made the House agree to
a recommendation that the King should be requested to consult
the heads of the Church, and meanwhile the question should be
adjourned. Shortly after, the Convention Parliament was
dissolved. Charles seems to have been disposed to act in good
faith towards those whom his Breda declaration concerned.
Baxter had frequent interviews with him, and a conference
between Episcopalians and Presbyterians was directed to be
held. ?The Savoy,? where the Bishop of London lodged while in
town was the place selected, and this has given to the Assembly
the name of the Savoy Conference. At the first meeting, Bis-
hop Sheldon demanded that the Presbyterians should produce all
their objections to the Prayer Book at once. To this Baxter
and his friends demurred, but finding the bishops would not
enter on the business until this was done, they reluctantly con-
sented and the conference was adjourned to give the Presby-
terians time. Had there been any hope of reconciliation up to
this point, Baxter?s next step would have destroyed it. In
rather more than a week, he drew up an entirely new liturgy,
and without scarcely seeing it, his brother ministers consented
to its being submitted to the conference as the kind of revision
they desired. The bishops directly said that the Presbyterians
must be a set of unreasonable men to expect them to abandon
their liturgy for one that had been manufactured in a week.
The bishops would not yield a jot: they had no notion of


any compromise. Only after much urging would they consent
to argue some of the disputed points. Many meetings were
taken up with metaphysical duels between Baxter on the one
side, and Dr. Gunning on the other. The time allowed by
the proclamation for the conference was nearly gone, and it be-
came evident that the Savoy Conference would be but a repeti-
tion of that which was held nearly sixty years before at Hamp-
ton Court. Something had been gained by it, however, but not
to the Presbyterian party. The bishops had committed Baxter
and his brother divines to a statement of what they regarded
as unscriptural in the Prayer Book, and had drawn from them
the declaration that it was against their conscience to subscribe
to it. This was just what Sheldon, the master-spirit among the
bishops, wanted. ? Now we know their minds,? he exclaimed,
?we will make them all knaves if they conform.? The expec-
tations of the High Churchmen as to the character of the new
Parliament were fully realised. Soon after its assembling, a bill
for the uniformity of public worship was introduced, and ra-
pidly forced through all its stages. This bill, although based
on that of Elizabeth, contained far more striilgent provisions.
Subscription not only to the articles was required, but unfeigned
assent and consent'to every thing contained in the Common Prayer
Book was also made imperative; and this latter provision was
agreed to by the Commons before they had seen the Prayer Book,
and while it was still under revision by the Convocation of the
clergy! The Cavalier and High Church party were ready to
commit any act, however monstrous and unjust, to show that
they were in power again. Their majority in the Commons
was, however, a narrow one, for the Act of Uniformity was
passed by 186 to 180*, so nearly did England escape ? the envy,
hatred, and malice, the false doctrine, heresy, and schism ? with
which that Act must be charged. While the bill was passing
through the Commons, the Presbyterians tried to introduce a
clause making a provision of one-fifth of their incomes to those
who should not conform, but without success. That consider-
ation for the families of the dissolute and incapable ministers
which was shown by the Long Parliament was not repeated by
the cavalier-majority now. Another proposed alteration found
more support. In the first draft of the bill, the 29th September
had been fixed as the day on which the Act should come into

force, but some, more cruel and vindictive than the rest, lemem-
bered that this would give the ejected the year?s tithes, and so the
24th of August was substituted, that the Nonconformists might
be houseless and penniless besides. The Lords were not as zea-
lous as the Commons in the matter, and were not disposed to
proceed with it until they had seen the Prayer Book. The
Commons sent a message requesting the Lords to hasten their
proceedings, but without effect. At last the Prayer Book left
the hands of the Convocation, and a revised copy was sent to
the Lords. Let us see what Convocation had been doing with
it. The Presbyterians had objected to the rubric as to vest-
ments ; Convocation had retained it. They had objected to the
absolution of the sick, and to the use of the cross in baptism ;
both of them were still retained. They objected to the reading
of the Apocrypha, and so Convocation added to the queer tale
about ?Toby and his Dog?-as the old version styles it-the
entertaining and highly moral history of Susannah and the
Elders, and the instructive story of Bel and the Dragon. The
bishops had conceded at the Savoy Conference that some objec-
tionable phrases in the marriage and burial services needed re-
vision; these, however, were still retained. Various unneces-
sary changes known to be specially offensive to the Presbyte-
rians were introduced; and to crown all, the covenanted scape-
grace on the throne was styled our ?most religious king.
Having obtained the Prayer Book, the Lords proceeded with the
bill. The opposition to its tyrannical provisions was much
stronger than in the Commons. The Earl of Southampton was
charged with having spoken 300 times against the bill, when he
replied that he was so firmly persuaded of the fatal consequences
of it that he would have spoken 300 times more to have pre-
vailed. A conference between the two houses was agreed on.
The managers for the Lords proposed that the clause requiring
schoolmasters to subscribe, as well as clergymen, should he with-
drawn, but were induced to abandon the proposal on being re-
minded of the danger of leaving education to dissenters ! Ihe
Lords objected to the clauses requiring Presbyterian ministers
to be re-ordained, and which deprived them of their livings if
they refused, alleging that this was a violation of the King?s
promise at Breda. The Commons replied that the King pro-
mised not immunity to misleaders, but only indulgence to the
misled; that it was very strange to call a schismatical
conscience a tender conscience; that a tender conscience de-


noted one capable of being impressed from without, not such as
adheres stubbornly to its own opinions?in short, the Commons
would have the bill, the whole bill, and nothing but the bill;
and the Lords were fain to yield. But will the King assent to
it? Is his royal word, ?the word of a king,? worth anything?
In the declaration from Whitehall he had promised that no
one should forfeit his preferment or benefice, or be deprived of
it, if he would only assent and consent to those of the articles
W?hich concern the confession of the true Christian faith and
the doctrine of the sacraments. Will he now insist on Bel and
the Dragon, and the Psalms as pointed for chanting, pointing
and all ? The session is now at an end; the King comes to pro-
rogue Parliament; the Commons, headed by Mr. Speaker, ap-
pear at the bar of the Lords. Let us hear what Mr. Speaker
has to say;?
? May it please your most excellent Majesty?
? The glorious body of the sun doth exhilarate the soul of
man with its light and fructify the earth with its heat. In like
manner, we, the knights, citizens, and burgesses of the Com-
mons House of Parliament, do with all humility and thankful-
ness acknowledge these frequent accessions to your Royal
presence do both comfort our hearts and influence our actions.
Geographers do tell us the land of Egypt is a dry soil, but made
fertile by the overflowing of the river Nilus; and according to
the degrees of the flood the inhabitants prognosticate the fruit-
fulness of the ensuing year. If it flows to 12 degrees it presages
a good harvest; if to 13, then more plentiful; but if to 14 de-
grees, their hopes are raised to an expectation of an abundant
increase. Great Sir, your return into this nation in the 12th
year of your reign resembles the flowing of the Nilus in the 12th
degree. That year was crowned with the enjoyment of your
Royal person. The last year being the 13th year of your Ma-
jesty s reign, we were made happy in your coronation, and by
your sanction of many good and useful laws for the Church and
State. And now our river Nilus begins to flow 14 degrees we
are by the mercies of God in an humble expectation of a great
jubilee. Our gracious Queen is now happily landed, who, we do
hope and daily pray may prove a suitable companion to your
Royal person, and ere long a nursing mother in this nation.?
His Majesty was then asked to cast his eyes on the heap of bills
on the table, which, said the figurative speaker, ? are as sheaves
of corn bound up and ready to be housed.? ? For the reforma-


tion of all abuses in the public worship of God we do humbly
present unto your Majesty a bill for the uniformity of public
prayers and administration of the sacraments. We hope the
God of all order and unity will conform the hearts of this nation
to serve him in this order and uniformity !?* Le Eoi le veut?
the King wills it; and the Act of Uniformity becomes law.
Of what value is the ? word of a King ??
Thetwo actsbearingthesametitle, and to which I have already
referred, were mild and reasonable when compared with this of
1662. Both of them enjoined only the use of the Prayer Book,
this required unfeigned assent and consent to every portion of
that book. The act of Elizabeth allowed the substitution of
lessons from the gospels for those from the apocrypha ; this
bound the minister to read the most apocryphal parts of the
whole apocrypha. ? Whatever might be the construction of
the statute of Elizabeth,? says Dr. Cardwell, ?itis certain that
persons who had not been episcopally ordained were admitted
to benefices, from the time of Elizabeth to the commencement
of the civil wars ;f now all such were to be summarily ejected
or must confess that ,their ordination had been invalid.? In
addition to these aggravations of former acts of the kind, the
new measure required all who had taken the Solemn League and
Covenant to declare that it was unlawful to have done so,
and also exacted a declaration that it is not lawful upon any
pretence whatever, to take up arms against the king. The
design of all this is apparent upon the face of it. There were
then, as now, two principal parties within the Establishment?
the one attaching supreme importance to ritual observances,
and known then, as now, as the High Church party; the other,
also attaching importance to ritual observances, but attaching
far more importance to the preaching of the gospel and the
winning of souls. This latter party we now call Evangelical,
and it was that party which it was the special aim and object
of the Act of Uniformity to drive out of the Church of Eng-
land. It was not the Presbyterians, as such, that were to be
expelled, but the Puritans, the men who dare not subscribe to
the doctrine of Hobbes, that religion is only of service in as
far as it can be used by the civil magistrates to keep the people
quiet. It was, in fact, Hobbesism which was established by the
Act of Uniformity as the religion of England. Sheldon and
* Hansard?s Par. Hist. vol. iv. p. 244.

Clarendon made no secret of their aims; indeed the character
of Bishop Sheldon furnishes the best explanation of this his infa-
mous handywork. Burnet tells us, ? That he seemed not to have
a deep sense of religion, if any at all, and spoke of it most com-
monly as an engine of government and a matter of policy.?
When Dr. Allen said to him, ? It is a pity the door is so strait,?
he answered, It is no pity at all; if we had thought so many
would have conformed, we would have made it straiter.? That
Burnet was not far wrong in saying that he had scarcely any
s ense of religion, is confirmed by an incident chronicled by
I epys. It relates to a dinner at Lambeth Palace, after Sheldon
became Archbishop of Canterbury. Pepys thus describes it:?
?At noon, to dinner with Mr. Wren to Lambeth, with the
Archbishop of Canterbury. A noble house and well furnished
with good pictures and furniture, and noble attendants in good
order, and a great deal of company, though an ordinary day,
and exceeding great cheer, no where better, nor so much, that
c\ er I think I saw for an ordinary table. The bishop mighty
kind to me, desiring my company another time. Most of the
company gone and going, I heard by a gentlemen of a sermon
that was to be there, and so I stayed to hear it, thinking it
serious, till by-and-bye the gentleman told me it was a mockery,
by one Cornet Bolton, a very gentlemanlike man, that, behind
a chair did pray and preach like a presbyter Scot, with all the
possible imitations in grimaces and voice. And his text upon
hanging up their harps upon the willows. And a serious good
sermon too, exclaiming against bishops, and crying up of my
good Lord Eglintoun till it made us all burst. But I did won-
der to have the bishop at this time to make himself sport with
things of this kind.?? Pepys iv., 321?323.
Even Pepys, the respectable man of the world, could per-
ceive the gross inconsistency of the bishop sanctioning such an
entertainment! And this was the prime mover in the passing
of the Act of Uniformity. Is it not marvellous that men can
stand up in this day to defend such an enactment, the work of
such a man. Archdeacon Hare has forcibly expressed his
opinion of the measure and its promoters, in a sermon preached
some years ago ; he says:?
This strait-waistcoat for men?s consciences could scarcely
have been devised except by persons themselves of seared
consciences and hard heart ?by persons ready to gulp


down any oath, without scruple about more or less. Verily,
when I think of that calamitous and unprincipled Act ?
of the men by whom it was enacted Charles 11. and
the aristocracy and gentry of his reign?of the holy
men against whom it was enacted ?it seems almost like
a prologue to the profligacy and infidelity which followed
closely upon it.
The first result of this enactment was the memorable ejec-
tion of the 2000 ministers on St. Bartholomew?s Day. I say
memorable, for, ? Anglicanus ? and Co. notwithstanding,
Englishmen can?t afford to let the memory of those holy con-
fessors perish. It was not urged, it could not be urged, that
they were immoral or insufficient; that they were like the men
whom the Long Parliament and Cromwell had turned out. A
living Church clergyman, the Rev. J. C. Ryle, thus describes
them :?? Many of these 2000 were the best, the ablest, and the
holiest ministers of the day. Many a man who had been regu-
larly ordained by bishops, and spent twenty or thirty years in
the service of the Church without molestation, was suddenly
commanded to accept new conditions of holding preferment,
and turned out to starve because he refused.?
The next effect of this enactment was to produce a schism
within the establishment itself. Yes, professing as it did to
secure uniformity, .it at once split the conformists into two
parties?created a schism, in the strict and proper meaning of
that term ; not a mere difference of opinion, but such a differ-
ence accompanied with strong antipathies and absolute ill will
between those who differed. Some of the evangelical clergy
managed somehow to conform; and they encountered the
deserved fate of such as forsake their friends and don?t find
favor with their foes. They were called the Low-church party,
and towards them their High-church brethren entertained the
bitterest feelings and the strongest repugnance. One of the Low-
churchmen, Kennet ?the author of ? Rennet?s Register,? was
afterwards made a dean, and an incident in his history will
illustrate the state of feeling between the two parties. The
rector of Whitechapel had had a new altar-piece painted, illus-
trating the Last Supper, and, being a High-churchman, had
caused the portrait of Kennet to be placed in the picture as
Judas Iscariot, in the garb of a Presbyterian minister. The
parishioners greatly edified, no doubt, and strengthened in
High-church principles by their Sabbath meditations, were in-


formed that the bishop himself?another Low-churchman?
would have been there as the inspiring spirit of the dean, if
the artist had not been afraid of legal censure for exposing so
dignified a personage to the contempt of all Whitechapel.' B
And this ill-will has been handed down to the present day,
and still exists. The Rev. J. C. Ryle, an Evangelical, charges
Mr. Bryan King, the Puseyite rector of St. George?s in the East,
with ? playing the fool? in his church; and an M.A. writing
in the High-church paper?? The English Churchman??says,
? that a large number of the evangelical clergy believe what the
Nonconformists of 1662 believed, and do not follow their
exampleand then remarks, that ? to agree with them in all
their objections and not to follow their practice is dishonest.?
Nor was the Act of Uniformity more successful in its object
beyond the limits of the establishment. The Nonconformists
up to 1662 were few and comparatively weak; their numbers
were then greatly increased, and their influence immensely
extended by the accession to their ranks of 2000 of the most
godly and learned ministers in the kingdom. Nor were the
subsequent persecuting enactments, the Conventicle and Five-
mile acts ?able to assist the promoters of Uniformity. In spite
of all such measures, Nonconformity steadily increased. Twenty-
six years after the passing of the Act of Uniformity, it was
strong enough to influence the settlement of the nation under
William 111., and to obtain the passing of the Act of Toleration :
and 200 years later, in this year of grace, 1862, the Noncon-
formists comprise rather more than half the entire population of
England, and the Church of England possesses not a single feature
of a national church except the ability to levy church rates
and the exclusive enjoyment of the ecclesiastical property of the
nation ; and it needs no prophet to perceive that these posses-
sions are not worth many years? purchase.
We must not omit to mention among the results of the
measure, the influence it has had upon the character of the clergy.
There are men who, when asked whether they will subscribe the
39 articles, will reply, with Theodore Hook, forty if you please ;
but these are not men whom it is desirable to have in the
ministry of any church. The Bishop of Oxford and other
dignitaries of the church have deplored the lack of able men in
the ministry, have complained that men of high gifts and at-
* Dr. Halley?s Lecture on Act of Uniformity,


tainments are less and less frequently to be found among the
candidates for holy orders. And to what may this more fairly
be ascribed than to the repugnance felt by every cultivated and
conscientious man, to declare his unfeigned assent and consent
to propositions and formularies, some of which are indifferent,
some unscriptural, some ambiguous, and some absurd ? The
writer in the Ed. Rev. from whom I have already quoted, says :
? Within the Church itself this restriction exercises the most
baneful influence; deterring (and that in an increasing degree)
the nobler hearts and loftier minds among the youth of England
from the service of the sanctuary; discrediting the clergy in the
eyes of thoughtful laymen; and inflicting on clergymen them-
selves a life-long injury, not the less mischievous because it is so
commonly denied and so often unsuspected.?* And Arch-
deacon Hare in the sermon to which I have already re-
ferred says:?? Though the best men will ever be ready to
become all things to all, for the sake of saving some, they who
are accustomed to walk in the light of principle must need
feel a repugnance to that which is merely formal, especially
when particular forms are associated with inveterate cor-
ruptions and abuses. Are all such men to be debarred at
once from the ministry of the Church, because they entertain
conscientious scruples on certain points acknowledged to
be indifferent ? The Act of Uniformity says, ? Yes.?
The spirit of true Catholic Christianity says, ? No.?
The Church that does so exclude them maims herself by forfeit-
ing the service of numbers who would have served her faith-
fully ; many of these, feeling an inward call to the ministry
which they cannot follow within the pale of the Church, join
the ranks of schism; and while the Act of Uniformity thus
casts out many of the best fish from the net, all the bad, all
the careless, all the unscrupulous, all the unprincipled, may
abide in it unmolested.? So oppressive is this strait-
waistcoat for men?s consciences felt to be, that 500
clergymen have petitioned for relief from it; and Lord
Ebury, their representative among the Peers, has striven
long to obtain a revision of the Prayer-book, and now has brought
in a bill to abolish the declaration of unfeigned assent and
consent required by the Act of Uniformity. Numbers of
pamphlets have been published by clergymen, in which they

bewail tbeir hard fate. A Kentish rector says, that the decla-
ration requires such a latitude in a solemn act, as no honest
man would allow himself to use* for any other contract, how-
ever trifling. A Nottinghamshire vicar entreats the clergy to
he no longer treacherous to truth, but to come forward boldly
and nobly, and obtain relief for their consciences, by petition-
ing Parliament to change the terms of conformity; whereupon,
another Kentish rector, on the opposite side, upon whom must have
descended the mantle of Sydney Smith, kindly informed his
scrupulous brethren that they might relieve their consciences by
resigning their livings; and, as most well-to-do people wish to
make as little change as possible, he recommends them to obtain
a change of only two letters in the Act of Uniformity, so, that
instead of declaring their unfeigned assent and consent, they
might be permitted by Parliament to declare their feigned
assent and consent.?*
One other result must be noticed. The greater number of
the ejected ministers were unquestionably Presbyterians ;
some, as I have shown, are admitted by Churchmen to have
been Episcopalians, and but few favored Independency. It is
nevertheless true, that something like one hundred Indepen-
dent churches date their commencement from 1662, and were
founded by ejected ministers. Originally Presbyterian, num-
bers of these little congregations were forced, by the hot per-
secution of the times, to act independently; and, having once
experienced the benefits of self-government, they had no wish
afterwards to revert to the ecclesiastical system of their
founders. Here is a case in point The rector of St. Katha-
rine?s, in the City of London, was ejected from his living, but
would not cease to minister to his flock. Near Eastcheap,
there was an office where all foreign goods entering the Port of
London had to be weighed, and where weights and scales could
be adjusted by a standard, called the ? King?s Beam.? Over
this office was a large room-an upper chamber, and there the
ejected rector of St. Katharine?s met his people, and preached
to them the Word of Life. The old office has long since dis-
appeared; the law requiring foreign goods to be weighed on
entering the Port of London, has been long repealed; weights
and scales have to be taken elsewhere to be tested, and by
some other standard than the King?s Beam: but the congrega-
Dr. Halley?s Lecture on Act of Uniformity.


tion gathered by the ejected rector of St. Katharine?s still exists
and flourishes, and the Weigh-house Church and its gifted and
beloved pastor Thomas Binney, are among the notabilities of
London, and are esteemed and venerated throughout the Chris-
tian world. I do not think there can he a single evangelical
clergyman who is prepared to say that the Church of England
was a gainer by the ejection of the rector of St. Katharine?s,
or is now a gainer by making Thomas Binney a Noncon-
formist. Yet these are among the results of the Act of
Uniformity.
That act has been, in short, one of the most lamentable fail-
ures the world has ever witnessed, yet it still remains to dis-
grace our statute book, and mock the civilization of the present
age. Thousands who have no abstract objection to an estab-
lishment, have been driven from the pale of the Church, to seek
food for their spirits and comfort for their souls in some other
fold- Even in this colony the * liberty of the clergy has
been fettered, and union among Protestants effectually pre-
vented, by the pretensions and assumptions which that act has
begotten. And, strange to say, while some of the best and
ablest among the clergy of England have been striving to get
rid of their fetters, the authority of our Victorian Parliament
has been used to rivet them more firmly on the episcopal clergy
here; for, in the act constituting the Church Assembly, it is
expressly provided that that assembly shall have no power to
alter the oaths, subscriptions, and declarations, which the Act
of Uniformity has imposed* Perhaps, it may one day be de-
bated, whether our Parliament should impose such restrictions
upon a body of ministers, even at their own request.
But why concern ourselves about the ecclesiastical legislation
of bygone times ? Why rake up the sufferings and persecutions
of 200 years ago ? Why revive the memories of Black Bar-
tholomew ? 1662, say some, is somewhat musty; the men of
that age are but dry bones now; what have we to do with them ?
Our business is to attend to our own particular cause and in-
terest, to fill our chapels, to pay off our building debts, to at-
tend evangelical alliance meetings?where the form of friendli-
ness prevails without the power, and with bated breath and
whispering humbleness to apologise for our Nonconformity!

Longfellow?s psalm of life must be re-written, and henceforth
must read, ? , . ,
? Lives of great men don't remind us,
We can make our lives sublime.?
Our forefathers and their memories are to be left to sleep toge-
ther, and we have only to forget them! ?Oh, what a world were
it,if this doctrine could prevail! Being deprived of the remem-
brance of the noble deeds and noble thoughts of those who
have gone before, we should be robbed of the most
precious of our possessions. Living as we do in an age
of self-seeking and respectability, when a thousand social dis-
honesties are sanctioned; when the statute of limitations and
the insolvency laws are looked upon as legitimate means of
getting rid of one?s debts; when men will stick at nothing in
their hurry to be rich ; when in the church as well as in the
world fidelity to conscience is so rare; in such an age we cannot
afford to bury in oblivion the stern and uncompromising integ-
rity of the confessors of 1662.
Those who approve the notion of Professor Goldwin
Smith, that the painter should be cut which joins the
small boat of the colonies to the mighty ship of
England, may with propriety object to the bicentenary cele-
bration in Victoria. But there are few of us, I take it, who are
disposed to endorse the professor?s views. How can we cease to
take interest in the history and welfare of our fatherland ? The
men whose fidelity and courage we commemorate were our an-
cestors ; and it as true here as it is in Britain, that we are in-
debted to them for the liberties we now enjoy. And in coming
to take up our abode in Victoria we have not parted with one
jot or tittle of our birthright; we are as much interested as ever
in the honour and prosperity, the welfare, both spiritual and
temporal, of the mighty nation which Queen Victoria rules.
Her ecclesiastical property is a part of our inheritance; her
noble seats of learning offer privileges to which we and our
children have a right; and thus are we justified in raising our
voice against sectarian exclusiveness?against the monopoly
of any of our national possessions by a dominant sect. We are
concerned, too, in everything which tarnishes the honour
and lessens the prestige of Britain, and especially as
Christians in everything which hinders her influence
for good in the world; and, therefore, do we pro-
test against this wicked and schismatic Act of Uniformity.


Especially are we Independents justified in this celebration.
Our principles are little understood, even by many who attend
our services, and our reasons for being what we are are but little
known. Dr. Perry, the bishop of the English Church, is in the
habit of representing us as wanton schismatics, who without
rhyme or reason left the Establishment. He will recognize the
churches of the Presbyterians, because Presbyterianism is the
National Religion in Scotland, but he will have nothing to do
with us; and lam vain enough to think that he is the princi-
pal sufferer by so doing. Now nothing will tend more to place
our principles clearly before our friends and the public than the
rehearsal of the story of English Nonconformity. And as we are
so constituted that we are more susceptible of impressions at
particular seasons ; remember our mercies more on our birth-
days than on other days; what more fitting time can there be
to rehearse our history than on the 200 th anniversary of an
event which in one aspect may be regarded as the birthday of
Nonconformity. It has been said over and over again that the
ejected of 1662 were State Churchmen; we admit it, to a certain
extent. They remained State Churchmen until the State
sought to tyrannise over them; they then protested, resisted,
and became free. But there was not one of that noble band
who would not have recoiled with horror from the idea of such
a State Church system as we have in this colony. Had they
lived to have seen what we see ; to have seen the followers of
John Knox and Ignatius Loyola, of Bishop Ridley and Servetus,
of Calvin and Arminius, all deriving support for their opposite
and conflicting systems from the same treasury, they would
have been what we are, Anti-State Churchmen, and would not
have rested, as we will not rest, until such a system is abolished.
But let not our Episcopalian friends suppose that we are
enemies to their Church and desire its destruction. Between
Laud and Sheldon on the one hand, and Dr. Perry and Mr.
Chase on the other, there are far more serious differences, than
between these living clergyman and us. Would Dr. Perry have
read the Book of Sports ? Would Mr. Chase have voted for
Susannah and the Elders, and Bel and the Dragon ? No! they
would have been with Baxter, and Calamy, and Howe ; would,
rather than have acted thus, have forsaken all and come out.
It has required the casuistry of two centuries to reconcile such
men to the subscriptions which the godless and unscrupulous
statesmen of Charles 11. imposed. And while we wish to see


the Church freed from her fetters, and religion rescued from
the reproach of hypocrisy to which the Act of Uniformity has
exposed it, we hear the clergy of the Episcopal Chuch-no ill will.
Our aims and theirs are far too similar for us to wish them
harm. To quote the eloquent words of Samuel Martin, our
English Bishop :?? We want no destruction of other Churches
of Christ; we should mourn over it as a fearful catastrophe.
But we do want perfect liberty. We do want complete equality,
and with these we are certain of fraternity. To be tolerated is
to be insulted. To be patronised by the dominant sect is to be
degraded. To be recognised on public platforms with apologies
for such recognition is to be betrayed with a kiss. To be called
heretics and schismatics is to be grossly libelled, but to be
acknowledged as a part of the Holy Catholic Church is simply
our due.? To promote liberty, fraternity, and equality among
Christians, and to assert our position in the Holy Catholic
Church, are the objects of this commemoration of Black
Bartholomew, and are the ends I have had in view in
troubling you with this lengthy and imperfect lecture on the
Act of Uniformity.
