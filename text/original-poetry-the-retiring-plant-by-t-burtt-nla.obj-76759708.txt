THE RETIRING PLANT.
Si||r�eBted by seeing a tobacco shrub growing
hole in the Moonta Mine Flat.
Near those mines yclept of Moonta,
Scarce a stone?s throw from the town,
You may find a rocky fissure,
Oblong, narrow, two feet down.
There is nothing very partic?lar
In that hole which here I note ;
Hollows like it, ?xactly like it,
People saw ere this was wrote.
Surface broken, soil uphoaved,
Was the cause of thing like this;
Dp not think I?m but romancing ;
Go and see it, there it is?
Well! what think of ?t:?eyes deflected,
On a crevice down you stare ;
But in name of all the senses
What?s to come for??nothing there.
Ah ! my friend, not quite so hasty,
Just a little closer spy.
See. you not in coffined chamber ;
Something living meet your eye.
So is?why there?s a plant there;
Growing, thriving, sprouting, green
Quite as fresh and heal thyloo king*
As on top was ever seem*
True?quite true?in dimmed enclosure,
Safe from howling storm and wind,
Grows yon tree in calm retirement.
Such as mortals seldom find.
Shrieks and groans of laboring engines
Harsh which cleave the tranquil air,
Move not, stir not, stem or leaflet;
Cribbed and cabined, sheltering there.
And, my friend, that caverned shrublet
Lives and thrives by night and day,
like those folks, who, silent treading,
toward bold their even way.
