Preface.
HThE following series of incidents in connection with the Convict
Hulk “Success,” has been compiled specially for the information
of those visitors to the vessel, who may desire to learn fuller
particulars concerning her history and the lives of those who at one
time filled her cells, than can be gleaned in the space of a short visit.
To make the description as complete as possible, much that may be
regarded by some as personal matter has had to be related when referring
to the officials who were stationed on board the vessel in its early
convict days. Care has, however, been taken, in reviewing the facts, to
present them in a fair and impartial light.
The differences of opinion expressed at the Government Enquiry and
in the newspapers of the time have been quoted at length, in order that
the reader may be in a position to form a judgment as to the treatment
that was meted out to the convicts.
The short sketches given of some of the most notorious bushrangers
may help visitors to the “ Success,” who are accustomed only to civilised
Loudon and other old-world centres, to realise the wild life of Australia
in the early days of colonisation—its vast solitudes of bush and lonely
mountain fastnesses, amidst which the settler and the outlaw pitched their
primitive camps, and seldom heard the sound of a human voice.
For some of the information contained in the following pages, I have
been indebted to the officials in charge of the early records of the
Melbourne Penal Department, to whom I hereby tender my best thanks.
The other sources from which I have quoted, I have endeavoured to
acknowledge in their right places.
I am firmly of opinion that the intrinsic value of this historic ship as
an object-lesson to prison reformers, will assure for it a continuance of its
prosperous career, proving, as it does, that excessive punishment, with
physical torture, brutalises the offender, and destroys all hope of refor-
mation.
It is a striking and encouraging sign of the progress made in the
humane and rational treatment of prisoners, that a vessel which, less than
fifty years ago, formed one of a felon fleet, should now be on exhibition
as a curiosity,—the last remnant of a happily-exploded system.

THE CONVICT HULK “SUCCESS.”
CHAPTER I.
“ Yes, shackle my limbs and bind me fast,
Through the hooting crowd to press ;
Away to the judgment hall, at last
The doom of my life, I guess.
Think not the spasm that shoots through my frame,
Is the quiver of wounded pride,
What has the felon to do with shame?
Or the pangs unto shame allied?”
IN writing the history of the “ Success,” it may prove interesting to
cast a retrospective glance at the port and its surroundings, off which
for so many years the old vessel was moored, blistering in the torrid
heat that added a touch of the infernal to the torture of those who were
incarcerated in her black and suffocating cells.
Port Williamstown, which was named by Bourke after King William
the Fourth, and is nine miles distant by coast from Melbourne, was at
the time of which we write a little fishing village, the sparse inhabitants
of which led the most primitive of lives. The old square tower, built in
1846, was originally used as a lighthouse, to warn the few trading vessels
that visited the port, of the dangerous Bird Rocks, standing out a little
distance to seaward. Before the introduction of the electric telegraph in
Australia, the arrival of ships was signalled from this tower, to a vessel
called the “Sir Harry Smith,” which was moored at the mouth of the
Yarra-Yarra River. From thence the signal was transmitted to the station
at Melbourne, then located at old Flagstaff Hill.
The chief communication between Williamstown and Melbourne in
the early days was across the Bay for the most part, and in order to attract
the attention of the ferryman on the opposite side, the residents were
requested (according to the advertisements in the one Melbourne
to “raise a smoke” on the shore, which was effected by burning large
quantities of brushwood and dry seaweed. Between “The Point ’ and
the nearest dwelling-houses in Williamstown there was a long stretch of
oround, where the little community of fishermen and Government officials,
after the labours of the day were over, would discuss the ever-important
subject of probable retrenchment, or the chances of a good “haul” on the
following morning. Their children might be seen at play on the green-
sward, embowered with ti-tree, or gathering shells and seaweed among
the rocks that fringed the shore.
It was a peaceful life, of Arcadian simplicity; but, alas! it was soon to
be rudely broken in upon by the mad rush in search of wealth that
followed the discovery of the goldfields in 1851. The beacon-light then
shed its brilliant ray on ships entering the harbour for the first time,
laden with hopeful immigrants eager to set foot in the land of newly-
found <>-old. These vessels came from all parts of the world, and included
almost & every kind of craft. There were paddle-steamers, with beam


engines from America, Dutch galiots from the Bast Indies—even a
Falmouth fishing-boat braved the dangers of the long voyage, and came
sailing safely into Hobson’s Bay.*
Then, one da}% looming above them all, came a quaint old full-rigged
ship, with apple sides, broad bulging bows, standing very high out of the
water, and the name “ Success ” displayed the full width of her square-cut
stern, over the windows and below the taffrail. She proved to be a
“country-built” East Indiaman, one of the “old Moulmein pagodas
looking eastwards to the sea.” She dropped her anchor right amidst
the army of white wings which then dotted the harbour, whefe, but a
year or two before, scarcely a sail was to be seen.
In the confusion and excitement that resulted from this sudden
influx of immigration by land and sea, murder, profligacy and crime
ran riot. Doubly and trebly convicted felons found their way over
from the old convict centres of Botany Bay and Hobart Town. Bush-
rangers and incendiaries—nine thousand felons in one year—joined
the promiscuous stream of immigrants that flowed towards the
“ diggings.” One day, in the year 1852, the Argus contained no less
than twelve columns of horses stolen ! Teamsters demanded one hundred
pounds per ton for the conveyance of goods into the interior, and
then the owners had to incur the grave risk of losing their property
at the hands of freebooters, who made travelling extremely dangerous.
The diggers also frequently fell a prey to these desperate ruffians,
■who concealed themselves in ambush, and waylaid anyone whom they
suspected of having made a haul at the goldfields. The troopers
that patrolled the highways in the interests of safety, were often found
murdered by the roadside; brigandage flourished in the “bush”;
and even ships were boldly boarded in the Bay.
When at last the discovery was made that quantities of gold glistened
in the gravel of almost every mountain stream, and in boulders of which
it is hardly an exaggeration to say the precious metal formed the greater
part, the mad rush of reckless adventurers was indescribable. Men
became millionaires, or at least rich beyond their wildest dreams, at a
single blow of the prospector’s pick. One lucky digger’s horse w’as
actually shod with shoes of gold. Actresses, in the canvas theatres, were
pelted with nuggets in place of flowers, as a token of appreciation;—in short,
the diggers, whether of the respectable or the convict class, indulged in a
profligacy and riotous excess that have never been equalled in the history
of gold-mining. The embryo township of Melbourne rose rapidly into
importance; three-fourths of the population having to live under canvas
tents that sprang into existence like mushrooms around the few houses
forming the settlement.
As an example of the lawlessness of the times, and of the boldness with
which robberies were perpetrated, we may mention that on April 2nd,
1852, gold weighing 8,153 ozs., valued at was stolen from the
gold-ship Nelson which stood out in the stream off Sandridge, now
better known as Port Melbourne, the suburb of Melbourne. The captain
and most of his crew had been carousing on shore, and no anchor-watch
was apparently kept. At night twenty determined convicts, w T earing
crape masks, put off from the ricketty structure then dignified by the name
* This small craft was named The Mystery, and was sailed by its owners, two brothers
named Barnett. They were allowed to come in free from harbour dues as a reward for their
bravery in making the journey under such trying conditions. For many years the brothers were
(be boatmen of the hulk “ Success,” and rowed the storekeeper and others to and from the shore.


of Sandridge Pier. The men leaped on board the Nelson, overpowered
two able seamen ; the mate, named Dudley, who made a brave
resistance, fell weltering in his blood ; and then these desperate ruffians
carried off the specie, right under the very noses of the constabulary on .
shore.
One of these gold robbers was a man named Burgess, who, in
association with Levy and Sullivan, afterwards achieved notoriety as the
New Zealand murderer. Burgess served a sentence of seven years on
the “ Success,” and was afterwards imprisoned in the Dunedin Gaol.
His cell was close against the outer wall facing one of the main streets,
and during the night he managed to wrench up one of the flags forming
the floor. He then burrowed like a mole, till he had succeeded in
thrusting out his head just above the sidewalk. Unfortunately for the
prisoner, a policeman, on his early morning beat, happened to be passing
at the time, the consequence being that Burgess was speedily dug out ot
his drive, and placed in safe custody.
The gold-ship robbery at Port Phillip, in which Burgess was a
ringleader, led to mass indignation meetings being held by the citizens,
who insisted that additional police protection should be at once provided
so as to keep pace with the tidal wave of immigration. The Government
responded by appointing a staff of special constables, who were successful
in capturing hundreds of the desperadoes who were concerned in the
early exploits. The primitive pris'ous, stockades on wheels, holding
twenty men in each, introduced from New South Wales, speedily became
crowded to overflowing. Hundreds of prisoners were chained in rows
to the wheels of the portable huts in the broiling sun, or were roped
“spread-eagle” fashion to convenient trees. Scores, too, of the early
bushrangers were fastened to ringbolts screwed into enormous stones,
some of which still remain on the foreshore of Williamstown.
Robbery under arms was reported every few days from the dark and
dangerous valley at Jolimont, and “My Lord Smith ” and the Sydney
Choker,” two desperate convicts, “ levied contributions ” for several
months from benighted travellers along the quagmire known as the
St. Kilda Road. It seemed impossible for the authorities to cope with
the number of miscreants who infested the district.
At last the suggestion was made that some of the vessels lying at
anchor in the Bay, deserted by captains and crews, who had all joined m
the headlong rush for the “ diggings,” should be utilised as prison hulks.
Many splendid ships were available for the purpose, amongst the fleet of
full-rigged vessels being the Chowringhee , Ihree Bells, President, Deborah,
Lysander, Sacramento, and the remarkable old “ Success ” ; and the last
five, on account of their immense strength, were selected for conversion
into floating convict prisous. (
Of these “yellow frigates,” as they were called, the “Success was
officially regarded as the commodore of the felon fleet. She was known
as the awful “dark cell drill” ship, aud between her decks were lodged
a company of close-cropped villains, the very scum of all the scoundrels
concentred at Port Phillip, with whom, from time to time, were numbered
men who had originally been transported from England for the most
trivial offences.
The first Inspector-General of Penal Establishments in Victoria was
Mr Samuel Barrow. He, from the first, had condemned the lack of
accommodation on board the prison hulks, and his first report contained
a monosal to build an immense gaol on the radiating plan, to accommodate
one thousand prisoners, at a cost of £200,000, but the enormous amount
required made the proposal impracticable. Mr. Barrow was drowned


Hobson’s Bay, and Mr. John Price, who was living in retirement in a
picturesque part of Tasmania at the time, was asked to take control in the
year 1854. He was the son of Sir Rose Price, a Cornish baronet, and was
married to a niece of the late Sir John Pranklin. He is supposed to ha\e
been the original of the character of “ Maurice Frere,” in Marcus Clarke’s
stirring novel, the Term of his Natural Fife, just as IMelville is
supposed to have been the original of the character of “Rufus Dawes”
in the same work. The new Inspector had been Chief Commandant at
Van Dieman’s Land, and also Commandant at Norfolk Island, succeeding
Major Childs. He knew the faces of the “old timers” at a glance, and
they knew him, as the “Demon of the Ocean.”* John Price was at that
time in the prime of life, and a man of fine physique. He was a born
leader of men, and struck terror into the hearts of the rebellious ruffians
with whom he had to deal. But long life amongst the convicts seemed to
have steeled his heart against them as a class, and he may be said to have
demanded rather than have won their respect. Major De W , who
visited the “Success” Exhibition in London, and who was acquainted
with Price intimately, describes him as “that kind of man that you
would say at first sight you would much rather dine or shake hands
with than fight.”
The new Commandant of the hulks boasted that he always went
unarmed among the convicts, who, in their turn, recognised that in him
they were dealing with a man who would not hesitate to sacrifice his own
life rather than be “bested,” as he was wont to express it. At Norfolk
Island he ordered George Strong, alias “ Dubbo,” fifty lashes for refusing
to work. The convict still resolutely refused, and stated his intention ot
“ not soiling his hands in future.” He was ordered fifty lashes more,
which punishment was repeated as often as he refused, till the doctor
was obliged to interfere in order to save the prisoner’s life. “ Dubbo ” on
recovering, still persisting in his obstinacy, a large grindstone was then
placed in the gaol yard, with handles on each side, by which it was turned
by a willing convict, and “ Dubbo’s ” hand was fastened to the opposite
handle, causing it to revolve with every turn. The Commandant,
happening to pass, observed to the convict that he was not such a
pebble as people seemed to think, but “Dubbo” very coolly reminded
him that it was the gentleman on the other side that was doing all the
work.f
The discipline on board the hulks at Hobson’s Bay was of the
most rigorous description, and it was by strange irony of fate that a
vessel named the “Success” should come to be the abode of men who
had so signally failed in the battle of life.
CHAPTER II
“ Punishment is the last and the worst instrument in the hands of the
legislator for the prevention of crime.” — Ruskin.
THE expedient of confining the prisoners of Port Phillip in hulks, or
isolated floating gaols, was by no means original. Hulks were
used in England as early as 1776. Such abuses, however, crept in
that Parliament an enquiry to be held in 177S into the
whole system, and the evidence adduced may still be seen by those interested
in the question, at the British Museum. The unfortunate prisoners

were shown to have been so terribly neglected and starved that they
were actually reduced to fishing for rats that swarmed in the hold of
the hulk, baiting the hook with a piece of fat pork surreptitiously saved
from their scanty rations. Being almost destitute of clothing, having
bartered away all but a few rags, many of the convicts succumbed from
exposure to the biting winds that whistled through the draughty decks.
At night the half-naked prisoners lay from stem to stern on the lower
deck in a long line, all huddled together for the sake of warmth.
The “sheer hulk,” immortalised by the sailors’ j)oet, Dibdin, has its
counterpart in the Dutch hulc (i.e., the body of a ship), and corresponds
with the galea of the Italians, the galire of the French, and our own good
English word “galley.”
No doubt many English visitors to the “ Success ” have heard of the
“hulks” at Woolwich, and even at Deptford where the convicts were
employed in the early days raising sand and gravel, and clearing the
River "Thames. The harbours at Chatham, Devonport, Portsmouth and
Gosport, were also at different periods hampered with “ hulks,” which
were originally intended for prisoners of war solely.
In later times, however, they constituted a secondary or intermediate
punishment, a link connecting the common gaols with what were then
known as the “Penal Colonies”; and one “hulk” at Woolwich, named
the “ Warrior,” held six hundred mem
When the “hulks” were full, and the prisoners began to accumulate
rapidly in the different country gaols, then a vessel would be chartered by the
Government as a transport ship, for the purpose of conveying the surplus
prisoners to Botany Bay.
The “Success” at the Antipodes was taken over by the Government,
and converted from a first-class armed merchantman into a floating prison,
and was moored originally off Port Gellibrand, at Williamstowu. Her
general structure will repay examination before we pass on to describe the
scenes and extreme methods of punishment that have given her a unique
position in the annals of convict history.
Her external appearance is particularly striking in these days of
“ ocean greyhounds ” with their triple-expansion engines. Her square-
cut stern and quarter-galleries stamp her at once with the hall-mark of
antiquity, and her bluff bow shows that she, at any rate, could never have
distinguished herself for a high rate of speed. Her recent voyage from
Adelaide to London, in 1895, for the purpose of exhibition at the English
ports, occupied no less than five months and a half, and though the old
vessel had weathered the storms of 106 years, not a single stick was lost
or the slightest weakness discovered. Gale after gale tested the topmasts
and timbers of the quaint .old craft, but the care exercised by Captain
Allan, a skilled navigator of long experience, proved equal to every
emergency. It would occupy too much space to narrate all the incidents
which befell during that long and anxious voyage. One superstitious
skipper, on sighting her weird barnacle-covered hull, turned tail with
some alarm upon The Flying Dutchman, as he thought she certainly must
be. The curious natives on the island of St. Helena came on board
by special permission, and on seeing the wax figures of the convicts in
the cells, were seized with fear, and hurriedly left the vessel _in
mortal dread that a Nemesis would hereafter overtake them for having
visited the home of ghosts and evil spirits.
And how she rolled ! With the full weight of the wind on her
quarter she would slowly heel over, almost to the line of her gunwale,
and, after a perilous pause (during which the crest of the rollers


flew across the deck in a deluge of spray), she would right herself
majestically, then slanting slowly, would plunge the opposite ends of the
yards in the foam of the angry sea. In a frightful gale off Madagascar
the lightning was so fearfully vivid that a young seaman, named Scoble,
was temporarily blinded by its intense brilliancy, and through the black-
ness of that long terrific night, the intermittent blazes of the electric
discharge showed the spars and rigging like some weird phantom-ship with
cordage all on fire. The force of the storm proved the “ Success ”
a splendid sea-boat, though she had not been under canvas before for
over forty years. In calmer weather, instead of cleaving through the
water like the ships of modern build, one long clear lift of rolling water
extended for a considerable distance on either side of her bluff bows,
and broke out into a tumult of seething foam, close to the “cutwater,”
below the “cat-heads” supporting the anchors.
This solid specimen of old-time ship-building is indeed a curiosity.
She left the slips in 1790 at Moulmein, a rice settlement near Rangoon,
in Burmah, British India. She is constructed almost entirely of Indian
teak, a native wood which for resistance to decay has proved itself, by
comparative tests made by the authorities of the Royal Naval College at
Greenwich, to be of greater value for ship-building than even British
oak. The comparative test is still on exhibition at the Greenwich
museum, the teak being marked “timber taken from the old ‘Success,’”
Her tonnage may be taken at 530. She is 135 feet in length, about
29 feet beam, copper fastened, and “ tre-nailed ” throughout. Her
solid sides are two feet six inches in thickness at the bilge, so that
prisoners from within, and the dreaded “cobra” from without, recoiled
from the hopeless task of penetrating her walls. Great breast-hooks,
beams, and ponderous “ knees ” show that labour must have been cheap
and lumber plentiful in Coolie land in 1790.
Yet pains were taken to make her trim and smart and fit to hold
a leading place among her sister ships of the Anglo-Indian fleet. Her
decks were trodden by the silken-slippered feet of Indian princes and
nabobs of rank and quality, and by merchants trading in ivory, silk and
precious stones, whose patronage was catered for by the owners of these
ships of pleasing and even gorgeous exterior.
Midway between the old stern windows or louvres, an elaborate
heraldic device (covered with barnacles since her submersion in Sydney
Harbour, hereafter alluded to) still defies Time’s defacing hand; and
costly designs of splendid workmanship originally ornamented every niche
and corner of the vessel. Remnants of great gilded scrolls upon a rich
blue ground have been brought to light on scratching away the super-
imposed coating. The quarter-galleries, too, were originally decorated
with massive and artistic carvings. Escutcheons can easily be traced at
regular intervals from stem to stern ; and the fo’c’sle head, raised high
aloft forward, bears at its extremity a symbol of innocence and beautiful
womanhood in the original figure-head of exquisite design,—a strangely
inappropriate emblem in the days when crime-stained convicts in clanking
chains put to flight all thoughts of innocence and beauty. It was
customary in the days when the “Success” was trading as a first-class
merchantman between England and the Indies, for merchant vessels to
be accompanied by one or more armed cruisers, as a protection against
the pirates which then infested the seas, or against the enemies of the
kino - . The “Success,” however, carried her own guns; and the port-
holes, breeching-rings, bolts and other fittings still remain.
In the year 1815, the vessel successfully resisted an attack made by a
heavily-armed French piccaroon, named the “ La Rosa," manned by a crew


of as desperate assassins as ever boarded a barque. . The engagement
took place in the Bay of Bengal, and resulted in heavy loss to the French-
man. Great shot-marks are still to be seen on the hull of the “ Success,”
close to the water-line.
Nor is the hull the only part of the vessel bearing traces of past
encounters, for on the teak-wood mainmast maj r be seen an indentation
which carries with it a most curious history. It seems that the Lascar
sailors once broke out into mutiny, and the state of affairs became so
grave that the captain signalled to the authorities at Fort William,
Calcutta, for assistance. By some extraordinary mistake, they assumed
the vessel to be hostile, and responded to the signal by firing a shot,
which struck the mainmast with terrific force, causing a heavy splintered
piece of “ ironwood ” to fall in the midst of the mutinous crew, killing one
on the spot and injuring several others. The indentation made by the
cannon-ball seems not to have affected the stability of the mast, for the
wild monsoons that sweep with devastating force across the Indian Ocean
must often have subjected it to a severe test; and yet the old teak mast
is standing to-day, apparently as sound and erect as when the vessel left
the dock for the first time over a hundred years ago.
In the month of June, 1829, the “Success” was chartered by the
British Admiralty to sail to Australia. She was fitted out with every-
thing necessary for the formation of a self-supporting colony, and
sailed from London under the command of Captain Stirling, who
had orders to found, if possible, a British settlement on the western
coast of that great island continent. The pioneers of what has now
become the City of Perth, stepped from the longboat of the old
“Success” literally into a dense forest, which fringed a picturesque
expanse of water summnding what was then formally proclaimed by
Captain Stirling as “The Swan River Settlement.” The cargo, consisting
of two hundred sheep, fifty head of cattle, besides pigs and poultry, was
landed at what is now the site of flourishing Freemantle, the first buildings
in which settlement were raised by the hands of skilled artisans brought
over from England in the old “Success.”
The captain was so enamoured of the new country that he preferred
to remain, whilst his ship returned in charge of other hands. He was
appointed the first Governor of the settlement, without any salary, though
it subsequently appeared he received a Government grant of 100,000
acres of the richest land as an acknowledgment of his services. Shortly
afterwards the Celesta, a full-rigged ship, laden with emigrants, arrived
on the scene, and gave a decided impetus to the young colony.
The “Success” resumed her voyages as “an old tea waggon,” as
shipping men would phrase it, from Berry’s Basin, now the East India
Dock, at Blackwall, London (which by a strange coincidence, happened
to be the very place where the‘vessel was moored and thrown open to the
public, in 1895, at the commencement of her exhibition tour at English
ports). In 1847, under the, command of Captain Abbott, she again
sailed to Australia, this time to Port Adelaide, as an emigrant vessel. In
December of the same year she was engaged by an enterprising American,
then resident in Adelaide, to sail to the prison settlement at Sydney with
provisions and produce, including a large quantity of rum, the whole cargo
being disposed of at an enormous profit.
Two years later the “Success” took a promiscuous passenger list, con-
sisting of both bond and free, from Botany Bay to Hobart Town, the voyage
being made memorable by a fatality to a lady passenger, the wife of the Rev.
James Baird, Chaplain at Port Arthur. She was killed by the accidental
falling of a boom, which came crashing through the rigging to the main deck.


Shortly afterwards the “Success” returned to England, and in 1851
were to be seen placards prominently displayed in the London coffee
houses, stating that she would “sail for the goldfields of Australia Felix ”
without loss of time. Several visitors to the ship have testified, in their
entries in the Visitors’ Book, as to the date of her departure, and also
as to her admirable sea-going qualities, with the exception of her
somewhat erratic behaviour at times as regards steering. From these
visitors the writer has obtained much interesting information concerning
this last voyage. It seems that after a few days’ delay, she finally
cast off her moorings at Deptford, and proceeded down the Thames on
January 2nd, 1852.
The voyage proved uneventful, the tediousness being relieved by the
customary pranks and practical jokes with which sailors have been wont,
from time immemorial, to celebrate “the crossing of the line.” She duly
arrived at Port Phillip on May 24th, 1852, just in time to see the infant
town of Melbourne en JHe in honour of Her Majesty’s birthday.
CHAPTER III.
Six months or more she had been out,
As tight a craft, I ween;
Built when a ship, sir, was a ship,
And not a steam-machine.
At break of day it was they saw
Australian land appear,
And fore and aft from man and boy
Uprang one mighty cheer.
—Sir Noel Paton.
THE “Success” had no sooner reached her moorings than she was
deserted. Her passengers, captain and crew might have been
seen together, making their way through the dense virgin forests
to the goldfields of the interior. The “ Success ” was soon forgotten
by all; the gold-fever was then at its height, and it was a common
sight to see fine vessels lying at anchor in the bay, abandoned, save
perhaps by the watchman in charge, by every soul, from the captain
downwards. It was found impossible to get men to “sign on” for the
outward voyage, and the old “Success” fared no better than her sister-
vessels in the bay. Accordingly, after a lapse of some months, she was
advertised for sale by the English owners, and was purchased by the
Victorian Government for conversion into a prison-hulk.
A foreman and four carpenters were at once set to work on the vessel,
the men receiving the extraordinary high wages of thirty-five shillings a
day, so great was the magnetic influence of the goldfields, and the
consequent difficulty of retaining skilled workmen in Melbourne. The
“Success” was stripped of all her neat and comfortable cabins and fittings,
their place being taken by narrow, stifling cells, into which no ray of
light entered, and hardly sufficient air to maintain life.
The Inspector of penal establishments gave orders that all irregular
corners in the ship, from the keel to the main deck, were to be provided
with ring-bolts and surrounded by walls. In all, seventy-two cells of
varying sizes and degrees of torture were constructed, and 120 prisoners
were accommodated —mark the significance of the term—on board the newly
fitted prison-hulk.


Showing interior of a cell, and prisoner in irons. —Page 14.




The galley on the fo'c’sle head was a substantial structure, roofed with
iron • and the smoking hominy and other food supplied to the ’tween-
deck prisoners was lowered through the forward hatchway. •
On either side of the fo’c’sle head the sentry-boxes are still to be seen.
Two men, armed with loaded rifles, were always on duty in these watch-
towers, so as to frustrate any attempt at escaping from the vessel.
Twenty-seven warders, at a total yearly cost of £5.300. were employed to
guard the prisoners. Their clanking muskets were a constant reminder
that they were ever on the alert in the event of an attempted escape, and
ready “to take sure aim” and shoot the prison-breaker, as they were
empowered to do under Clause VI. of the regulations that were pasted on
the mainmast.
The usual method of boarding the hulk was by an ordinary gangway
ladder and on stepping over the waterways the visitor would be
challenged by an officer stationed to guard the entrance to the
Commatidant’s quarters, now being used as the managers office. The
warders gained access from deck to deck by means of iron ladders,
fixed vertically, but the prisoners, encumbered by the weight of their
irons, had to be raised and lowered in batches of five at a time—
often quarrelling and fighting-in a rough lift which passed from the
lower to the main deck, through the_ forward hatchway. The wooden
wheel with an endless rope, and the ingenious chocks that formed the
raising apparatus of this lift, still hang above the iron-barred hatchway,
and can be seen by visitors to the vessel.
In order to completely isolate the “Success,” and prevent the escape
of any prisoners, there was a cordon of buoys moored round the yellow-
painted hulk, at a distance of seventy-five yards. Any person entering
the circle without proper authority, or not being possessed of the counter-
sign, rendered himself liable to a penalty of one hundred pounds.
Only the prisoners of better behaviour—who were confined in the
’tween-deck cells —were taken off every day to work at the quarries, from
whence came the stone with which the magnificent pier was built, a
lasting monument of convict labour. The breakwater also, which curves
out into the sea like a strong arm protecting the vessels from the heavy
rollers in Hobson’s Bay, was built by the hands of prisoners from the
convict-hulk “Success.”
On the lower deck were the absolutely hopeless characters, men who
were considered utterly irreclaimable, and who were confined in separate
dens Here too were the condemned cells, in which those who were
doomed to die passed the brief interval in a chamber of darkness, from
which even death must have proved a welcome relief.
A typical incident happened during the governorship of Mr.
Latrobe the first Governor at Port Phillip. He was making an official
visit to’ the hulk, with the view of inquiring into the protestations of
innocence made by a prisoner named Keir, then under sentence of
death His Excellency was accompanied by Sir A n Y g (Com-
mander of the Marlborough ), then staying, as the Governor’s guest, at
Melbourne. Together with a warder, they proceeded to the condemned
man’s cell, over which appeared his name and the particulars of his
crime The massive door was unpadlocked and flung open, and the
Governor cautiously advanced into the dark interior, where the prisoner
on bended knees, prayed earnestly to be released from Ins undeserved
tortures In his almost hysterical entreaties, he flung himself at the feet
of Latrobe, and had clasped him round the legs, a proceeding which caused
the warder to push him roughly back into the corner of the cell. ‘ Let
the man say what he has to say,” sternly commanded Latrobe, ‘ 1 will


hear him through,” and the convict, thus reassured, told his story with such
success that Sir A n Y g interested himself in the case, which was
reheard, the result being that the man’s innocence was established, and
he was not only reprieved but received substantial compensation.
The “unsafe sixty” prisoners were, by the regulations, never allowed on
shore under any pretext. Their only exercise and opportunity of enjoying
a breath of fresh air was restricted to oue hour in every twenty-four, when
they were marched from stem to stern upon the upper deck. The
exceptionally high bulwarks prevented them from seeing aught but the
strip of blue Australian sky directly overhead; the white-winged gulls, as
they glided over the vessel, seeming to mock the prisoners in their heavy
chains. From long confinement in the dark cells the eyesight of the
convicts was generally ruined. The sudden transition from their black
dens to the dazzling sunshine, in their hour’s respite, was more bewilder-
ing than the sensation experienced by the miner on emerging into
daylight after some hours’ sojourn in the bowels of the earth. Thomas
Campbell has well expressed the feelings of the dark-cell prisoners :
Lo 1 nature, life and liberty relume
The dim-eyed tenant of the dungeon gloom.
The main-deck of the “Success” has been somewhat altered in
appearance. In front of the officers’ quarters, right athwart ship to the
gangway on either side, originally ran a high iron barrier, the top of
which was studded with a row of formidable-looking spikes. A similar
division also crossed the ship close to the forward hatchway. These
barriers fenced in the space for exercise. In the iron-barred partition,
astern on the starboard side, was a wicket, and between this wicket and
the end of the high gangway platform a sentry paced w'hilst on duty.
From the latter position he could gain an uninterrupted view of the water
from stem to stern, and even when the guard-boat approached, though
each face was quite familiar, he dared not neglect the military discipline
that prevailed on board. Distinct and clear his voice would ring across
the waves: “Who goes there?” The reply would come: “Guard-boat.”
“ Advance guard-boat, and give the countersign!” Then “Gibraltar” or
some such word would be given as the password. “ Pass on guard-boat—
all’s well! ” the last words being given quite a musical intonation.
From the wicket gate the sentry’s view commanded the whole of the
deck. The sight of the prisoners at exercise was saddening in the
extreme, each man half stooping beneath the weight of the links with which
he was encumbered. The marked desperadoes were closely watched by
special warders and marched straight up and down, whilst the others
made the round tour of the ship by crossing over to the opposite side on
reaching the fence at either end. The course they followed can still be
perceived by tracing the grooved pathway worn into the original planks
of the deck.
As they paced the deck during this tour of comparative relaxation, it
was no uncommon event for one of the prisoners to make a bold dash for
freedom or death. They scarcely expected to get beyond the cordon of
buoys, but they were reduced to such a state of desperation that they
preferred a watery grave to the treatment they received on board
this “ocean hell.” When one of these “rushers” was overtaken in
such an attempt, he was invariably punished by having a heavy ball of
iron, weighing seventy-two pounds, attached to his belt by a chain. This
“punishment ball” is still preserved, and is shown to visitors to the
“ Success.” In spite of its weight, some of the convicts gained a wonderful
dexterity in swdrliug it round them in a semi-circle at their feet, and would

waist-belt, and could thus move from one part of the deck to the ol ,
with comparative ease, born of long practice.
As an additional punishment, the eyes of the refractories on parade
were sometimes tightly bandaged, and gagging is shown to have been
Girted to Sr the Authorities, who appear to have exercised a fiendish

in the mouthpiece to enable him to breathe. Senior Warder W- p,
who was stationed on the “Success” in 1853, and who is now living in
retirement in a rose-covered villa at Richmond, near Melbourne, effacing
the dark memories of tortures he was powerless to prevent, admitted, in
the course of a newspaper controversy he had with Marshall a
leading Melbourne lawyer, that the gag was certainly used on the hulk
“Success.” and added significantly that “it had the effect of compelling
the prisoners to submit to the discipline of the establishment. (vide
Mel h ourne Herald , October 31st, 1895.)
Amongst the punishments we may also appropriately include the


“compulsory bath,” into which the fractious prisoners were thrust by the
warders, and then scoured with long-handled brushes, tc keep them sweet
and clean. It consisted of a wooden lead-lined structure, like a deep
box, and the convicts’ ablutions were rendered none the pleasanter by
the bolted stump of the bowsprit which projected inside the bath. It was
refilled for each gang of ten prisoners; and three ’tween-deck convicts
took turns at the handle attached to the pump-wheel, by means of which
salt water was made to play upon the unwilling bather. This item in
the ship’s routine sometimes had its humorous aspect; but there are
ugly tales related of prisoners being brought straight from the flogging
frame, with their backs torn and bleeding from the cruel lashes of the
“ cat,” when their wounds were cleansed by the steady flow of the salt
water, used, so it is said, to prevent inflammation.
The prison dress was always plainly branded with broad-arrows and
distinctive numbers. The hair of each prisoner was clipped at frequent
intervals, and their legs were always kept in irons. The blacksmith’s
forge was under the fo’c’sle head, where a convict son of Vulcan forged the
fetters for his comrades in crime, and fastened their clanking anklets
with red-hot rivets. Examples of these chains are now shown on board,
varying from 8 lbs. to 56 lbs. in weight; while in the Oscott Museum,
at Birmingham, the 48-lbs. leg-irons worn by Martin Cash, a notorious
bushranger (who styled them his “Sunday suit,” as they were made
for wearing during attendance at Divine worship) are still exhibited,
having been brought to England by the Rev. Dr. Wilson to show a
Committee of the House of Commons. Martin Cash was transported
originally for having, in a fit of jealousy, shot and seriously injured his
rival, his first sentence being seven years. An old rhyme ran—
“ Seven links have I in my chain,
And every link a year,
Before I can return again
To the one I love so dear.”
But the number of links had no significance upon the hulk, where men
had sentences ranging as high as 32 years. Rusty anklets and chains
are still found here and there, in the lumber yards of the older inland
prisons in Australia, relics of her early convict days, which the present
generation appear to be so anxious to erase from memory.
Hulk prisoners would narrate how, when travelling in single file from
one convict centre to another—“on the chain,” as it was called—the
weakest men would fall by the roadside, only those of the strongest
physique being able to stand the protracted marches through the almost
impassable interior. At one time in New South Wales there were
a thousand prisoners on the chain. The long continuous chain passed
through a central ring fastened to each man’s “ travelling chain-gang
iron ” ; and when a body of convicts attached in this manner were being
employed in repairing the roads, one armed soldier was considered a
sufficient guard for a party of eight; the officer in charge being instructed
to see that the irons had not been tampered with, and that all the
fastenings were secure.
White’s “ Convict Eife in New South Wales ” (which was compiled from
Government records, and is considered a text-book on this subject), in
referring to the leg-shackles of the convicts, says: “They were not
removed when they went to' the hospital, and not always when they went
to their graves.” As late as 1889, some labourers who were engaged in
excavating for the sewers of Brisbane, came upon a pair of anklets
through which still protruded the remains of a human leg-bone, proving
the truth of the above statement, and further proof can be seen in


a grim relic preserved in a Brisbane museum. Those visiting the
“ Success ” will find the leg-irons worn by its prisoners exhibited in
the alley-way at the stern.
On the high poop deck the principal object of interest is the original
steering gear. 'ihough the more modern “diamond screw” has been
added, the old-time tiller, a great iron beam by which the vessel was then
guided, and the ponderous rings to which the “kicking tackle” was
fastened, still remain. Her history shows that she possessed the same
dangerous propensity that marked a celebrated Russian Admiral’s ship of
the olden time—she would “steer herself,” and on many occasions she
has seriously injured the man at the wheel.
Leg-irons.
During the last voyage of the “Success” to the Colonies a towering
wave struck her broadside with such force that the tiller rebounded,
hurling the helmsman on to the ironwood deck and injuring him fatally.
To commemorate the death of the sailor thus killed at his post, the old
ship’s carpenter inserted in the deck a piece of wood, the shape of a
coffin, which is still to be seen, right under the foot of the binnacle.
From the binnacle we pass to the bell, still hanging, untouched by rust,
as in the time when it divided the convicts’ days into weary hours.
When Edgar Allan Poe wrote his famous poem, “The Bells,” he could
most appropriately have added to his list the prison bell—
“ What a world of melancholy
Its melody foretells.”.


Above the simultaneous tolling of the bells on board the different
convict-hulks in the harbour, the high, clear-sounding signal from the
“dark-cell drill” ship could always be recognised by the old residents of
Williamstown and fishermen on shore. The routine of the ship and the
movements of the prisoners were regulated day and night by its hourly
monotone. Even such details as the rolling of the convicts’ blankets
were timed by the ship’s bell; and the meal hours and the daily muster
for the quarries were also thus announced. At nightfall it tolled the
curfew, when the lights on all the other hulks would have to be
extinguished. The original inscription, “ Success, Moulrnein, 1790,”
engraved in quaint characters, can still be deciphered on this interesting
relic, which hangs over the entrance to the warders’ quarters.
When the bell was rung violently—the signal of an outbreak—all
hands responded to the alarm. The alley-way in an instant became filled
with excited warders, often hatless and coatless, and the ringleaders were
speedily surrounded by the armed attendants, who conveyed them to the
“ black holes ” on the deck below, where their screams and blasphemy
were unavailing, owing to the thickness of the walls. Riots were of
frequent occurrence on the “Success,” and the shrieking and howling
continually kept up by the maddened inmates converted the hulk into
a veritable pandemonium, where peace and quietness were almost
unknown.
CHAPTER IV.
The sunbeams danced upon the waves,
And played along her side,
And through the cabin window streamed
The ripples of golden light.
There sat the captain with his friends,
Old skippers, brown and hale,
Who smoked and chatted o'er their grog,
Of calm, and storm, and gale. —Longfellow
AT the extreme end of the alley-way, aft on the main-deck, is a cosy
cabin, extending the full width of the vessel. This was the
warders’ sanctum and, with the glass doors closed and the
curtains drawn, it made a very snug retreat. The sunshine filtered
through the skylight, which has since been boarded up. The warders
gained access to the high old-fashioned poop by means of a companion
way that then existed. Comfortable arm-chairs, sofas or lounges were
ranged round the cabin, and a wide table encircled the rudder post, the
shaft of which runs through the centre of the apartment. Decanters
and glasses were ready to hand on a swinging rack, the edges of which
were ornamented with a border of bone carving, beautifully executed by
a convict from New South Wales.
In this comfortable cabin, when the evening meal was over and the
convicts had ceased to be troublesome, the warders managed to wax
tolerably merry, the party often being augmented by visitors from the
other hulks, and sometimes from the shore. It is true that an occasional
growl, as if from the vaults below, would penetrate to the jovial company;
but the w T arders were a well-seasoned crew, and paid little heed to the
impotent outpourings of their helpless captives. On these occasions
privileged visitors from Williamstown and Melbourne would contribute


»• the refreshment,” which acted as an excellent lubricant to the tongues
of the company, which might otherwise have become dried in the smoke-
laden atmosphere.
The life and soul of the party was a genial Irishman named McMahon,
who, at the time of which we write, had just been promoted to the
“Success,” after winning his spurs as a mounted constable in the
remarkably short period of a year from his arrival in the colony. He had
an irresistible brogue, and his fecundity of humour and natural aptitude
for narration caused him to be a great favourite with his colleagues. Our
readers may not take it amiss if we introduce them to the warders’ cabin,
on the occasion of one of these social gatherings, so that they may hear a
few of the yarns with which the custodians on this most dangerous of all
the prison-hulks used to beguile their leisure evenings.
As we enter this little den, McMahon is priming himself with a drop
of his beloved “ real Irish,” preparatory to retailing an experience for the
benefit of the company.
“There was wan divil, Freeman by name, a name oi hear yez say not
very well suited to a convict. I’ll niver forget that spalpeen to me dying
day. The Inspector-General had gone below to inspect the ’tween-deck,
when he heard low muffled groans and the jangling of the irons, as av wan
av the * boarders ’ rolling on the floor in pain. "On opening the cell door, the
prisoner was found curled in a hape, with his hands clasped to the pit of
his stomach, and he explains that he has been took moighty bad with the
cramps. Ould Hyland (I don’t mean the dear old mother countree, gentle-
men,” explains McMahon with one of his expansive smiles, “but our
chief warder) was ordered to administer brandy to the sufferer, and no
sooner had the artful son av a gun drunk the sperit than he rises up,
smacking his lips and his face all covered with grins at having taken a rise
out of the ‘old man,’ for he was not ill at all, at all. But Freeman had to
pay a long price for his ‘nip,’—‘three days’ solitary’ and two in the
Black Hole was the additional punishment for this little freak.”
After a pull at his tumbler, McMahon enlivens the company with
another reminiscence that goes to show that the w T ork at the quarries
by no means made the fingers of those convicts who had engaged in
theft forget their cunning.
“On the first occasion av their taking evidence on the treatment of
the prisoners, a pompous, elderly official came over to the quarries from
Melbourne. As he picked his way carefully across the tramway at the
entrance to the excavation, a truck propelled by prisoners behind, jist
glanced agin ’ira as it passed, and tripping over some spalls, shure, he
fell sprawling in the dust. With many expressions of regret the convicts
hastened to brush down the gintleman’s clothes, and so moighty polite
were they that when Mr. Hughes—for that was the gintleman’s name—
came to put his hand to his pocljet, he could scarcely believe they had
‘picked’ his watch, purse and pencil-case which were safe in his posses-
sion a minute before. They were fair divils, wan an’ all av them,”
concluded McMahon, as he sank back in his chair with folded arms, and
an expression of repose that seemed to repel further demands on his
entertaining abilities.
After a few minutes’ pause, in which the clouds of smote from the
assembled pipes curled round the heads of the company till they were
enveloped in an atmosphere as thick as a sea fog, one warder, who had
hitherto been a silent and attentive listener, leans forward and says:
“Gentlemen —ahem—with j’our permission, I’ll tell you of a desperate
affray we once had with some convicts on this hulk some five, or it may
be six years ?igo.


“ It was, if I recollect right!}', in the mouth of April,”—began Warder
G , but unfortunately for his narrative it was interrupted at this point
by a disturbance amongst the convicts on the deck below, and half-a-
dozen warders were promptly summoned to the scene. They presently
returned and resumed their seats with a matter-of-fact air, as if such
interruptions were of too common occurrence to call for any comment.
“As I was saying,” resumed Warder G , “it was in the month of
April, say five years ago, the two convicts, King Marshall, as he was
called, and Bob Ferris were received on the hulk, the former to undergo
a sentence of fifteen years for horse-stealing, and the latter twelve years
for robbery under arms. Both were quiet, sullen sort of men, but they
behaved so well that after the usual probation on the lower deck, they
were allowed to occupy one of the cells reserved for the better-conduct
prisoners on the ’tween deck. They worked well at the quarries, and as
they gave so little trouble to my mate and me we very naturally ‘ sprang
a point or two,’ and allowed them small favours which were denied
to their fractious comrades. But this quiet manner and apparent sub-
mission to authority was all a sham, put on so that they might have
a belter chance of succeeding in their deeply-laid plans for effecting
their escape. They had by some means, though we could never find
out how, managed to replace the iron rivets in their leg-irons with
wooden pegs.
“ Next morning, when starting for work at the quarries, Marshall, with
a growl like that of an angry mastiff, made a spring at my mate, striking
him a heavy blow on his right temple with his manacled fist. The
poor fellow was felled to the deck and lay there dazed, bleeding and
unconscious. I was just in the act of rushing to his rescue when I was
seized from behind by the other convict, who, with almost superhuman
strength, lifted me clean off my feet, and was carrying me, struggling, to
the bulwarks to throw me bodily overboard, when there was the sharp
crack of a rifle, and we both rolled over together on the deck.
“ Meanwhile, Marshall had leaped into the sea, but the alarm had been
given, and he was soon found clinging to the cable chains, and was
speedily recaptured. Half-a-dozen warders flung themselves on my
assailant, who made a desperate resistance, but he was at length over-
powered and taken below in irons. They were both, of course, severely
punished for this daring attempt, being flogged, as well as receiving terms
of solitary confinement in the dreaded ‘black hole.’ My mate, I am
pleased to say, recovered from his injuries, or he would not be sitting here
smoking his pipe, as you see him to-night, gentlemen,” added Warder
G , with a dry smile creeping round his hard features as he nodded
across to where the partner of his adventure was sitting.
As, however, that modest official gave no sign of taking part in the
conversation, Warder G continued to give the company some
information respecting the different convicts and their traits of character.
The thieving instinct, he declared, was so strong in some that they had
often been known to steal even the bread and blankets from one another.
On one occasion the chaplain of the “Success” took a great interest in
one of the prisoners, a smart pickpocket, in whom the ruling passion
predominated to such an extent that while the chaplain was explaining
to him a sum in simple subtraction, the artful student proved himself an
adept in this arithmetical exercise by purloining the parson’s gold eye-
glass from his waistcoat pocket.
Some of the convicts had enjoyed the advantages of a good education
and could read and write well, but the majority were brutalised and
contaminated by association with the ignorant and depraved.


Owen Suffolk, alias “ Badger,” was a man of some literary ability,
and w'as the author of “Days of Crime and Years of Sufferance,” and
“ Life in Tasmania.”
For some offence he had been doing “five days solitary,” and when
the time came for his cell to be opened, all seemed quiet as the grave,
and the warders expected to find that the prisoner had succumbed under
the punishment. Imagine their astonishment, on peering into the cell,
to find the, convict standing on his head !
Of course, this was mere bravado, but still it showed how little effect
even solitary confinement in a pitch dark cell had on some of the tougher
sort.
It was now the turn of Warder L to regale the company with
some of his reminiscences. He proceeded to tell a yarn concerning a
troublesome convict named Young (whose exact counterpart may now be
seen on board, in the very cell that he occupied originally). “He was
the most contrary devil you ever set eyes on,” said Warder L ,
rousing himself up as he called to mind these incidents from the past.
“He gave Inspector Price a deal of trouble. On one particular
occasion he was found to have destroyed his blankets by tearing them
into small strips. There he was, sitting amongst a heap of rags in the
corner of his cell, as cool as a cucumber. ‘All right,’ said Inspector
Price, ‘I will now give you a needle and thread, and you shall have no
blankets at all until you have sewn these strips together.’
When the Inspector made the usual tour of the hulk on the following
day, Young was found with upturned eyes and a look of mock gravity
on his round and comical face.
“ ‘ Well,’ asked Mr. Price, ‘have you sewn your blankets together as I
ordered you?’ ‘Yes, sir,’ replied Young, ‘here they are,’ at the same
time dangling before the Inspector’s eyes a long chain of flannel strips
which he had sewn together end to end , forming a streamer some fifty feet
in length. For once the stern representative of the Government was
beaten, and he burst out in a fit of laughter.”
The conversation in the Warders’ cabin then became general, some
calling to mind the tricks and dodges to which the convicts would resort
in order to shirk the hated labour in the quarries. One man actually
went so far as to work a small piece of sheathing copper into the flesh
inside his cheek, causing a sore place that he hoped would incapacitate
him for work ; but the foreign substance was discovered and removed by
the doctor in time to prevent serious consequences. Others would
deliberately blind themselves temporarily with stone-dust from the
quarries in order to get off work. But we must now bid adieu to the
genial warders, and leave them to. spin their tales of wickedness while we
finish our inspection of the ship. k
CHAPTER V.
DESCENDING to the corridor that runs ’tween decks, one gets a
good perspective view of the cells that occupy each side of the
vessel. Above and below are strong iron bars, and gridiron
gratings. Those massive iron-bound doors, fastened with huge
iron hasps and heavy drawbolts, look as if the words of Dante might be
written over each, with terrible appropriateness: “All hope abamfon, ye
who enter here.” They look, indeed, more fit to be cages of wild beasts
than a prison-house for men, and the close-cropped, crouching prisoner


within seems to have caught something of the spirit of the untamed
animal as he lies there a sullen victim.
It says a good deal for the care with which the prisoners were
guarded, that not a single case of successful escape is on record.
The most ingenious and persevering attempt was that made by a con-
vict named Richard Jones, who feigned sickness for upwards of three
months, and managed to escape being suspected. With the assistance of
other prisoners he secreted three knives in his cell, carrying them thither
in the lining of his boot on different occasions. He then actually entered
on the utterly hopeless task of cutting his way through the impenetrable
teak hull, the walls of which are as thick as those of a Roman church.
His heart failed him, however, and his plot was quickly discovered.
The whole of the “floor” of the ’tween-deck, except about two feet
running in front of the cells and a broad plank down the centre of the
corridor, was composed of a strong iron grating, so as to give as much light
as possible to the corridor below. The centre plank was for the use of
the sentry as he paced his weary beat day and night, for it seldom
happened that the whole of the “association deck” convicts were ashore
at the same time. After dark, two or three oil lamps swung from the deck
above, casting a sickly yellow light down the corridor, which presented as
uncanny an appearance as could well be imagined.
How close and stifling it was here on hot summer nights! How
reeking was the atmosphere! And in winter time, alas, how cruelly cold
would the wretched shivering prisoners be, as they lay all night, with the
ocean mists stealing through the barred aperture over the door, the only
provision for the supply of air to the cell and as much light as could filter
down through the gratings in the deck above.
On this deck, used only for the better-behaved prisoners, most of
the cells are seven feet by seven feet, the rest being four feet by seven
feet. By a ridiculous and hypocritical rule of the ship a Bible was placed
in each dark cell, it being, of course, utterly impossible for the convict to
decipher a single word, or even to see the book, as it lay on the little shelf
provided for the* purpose. In this case, unfortunately, “ the entrance of
the Word ” did not give light.
In the bow of this deck, on the port side, is the prison chapel, a small
dark enclosure, railed off by stout iron bars, behind which about a dozen
of the promoted prisoners were drafted every Sunday, in order that they
might benefit by the spiritual ministrations*of the Chaplain, who—wise
soul—not wishing to be a second Daniel, kept on the outside of the den.
Here he would drearily recite the prayers and Litany of the Church of
England. The caged Christians responded with improvised and often
impious answers of their own; and on one occasion a convict named
Garrett, in a fit of desperation, boldly avowed his belief that after all
“Almighty God has no jurisdiction south of the Equator.” For this
blasphemous utterance he was sentenced to twenty days’ solitary
confinement on bread and water. As the Chaplain droned through the
prayer for mercy “on all prisoners and captives,” the warders were
standing “at attention” with loaded rifles, a mockery of religion which
could hardly have failed to strike the sin-stained sufferers behind
the bars.
Sometimes the minister on board tried to sow good seed by dis-
tributing Scripture text-cards amongst his erring flock, but results hardly
justified a continued outlay in this particular attempt at conversion.
W hen a body of convalescent convicts were set a quantity of oakum to
pick, they have been known to put the minister’s scripture cards to the
base use of playing Euchre. By tearing the cards in half, and marking


them according to terms used in the game, the prisoners managed to pass
a very pleasant hour’s diversion, and with the heap of oakum in their
midst, ready to be attacked the moment the warder approached, they
would shuffle and cut, deal, and cheat each other, till the exigencies of the
situation demanded that a little attention should be given to the oakum ;
or possibly the game was brought to a premature end by the sudden
appearance of the warder, and the consequent confiscation of the
Euchre pack.*
On board the sister ship, “ Lysander,” the women’s prison, the
evangelistic efforts of the chaplain to reclaim his sisters by means of
tracts and leaflets met with similarly discouraging results. After a
generous distribution of religious literature it was usual to find the tracts
next morning on the floors of the cells “ converted ” far more than the
prisoners, who had used them as curl papers.
Until recently the visitors to the “Success” could see the original
Bibles which used to be provided for the convicts in the chapel we have
described; but such is the enterprise of the London thief, or the
unscrupulousuess of the collectors of curiosities, that these sacred relics
have been stolen during the stay of the vessel in the Thames.
In May, 1854, a weakly convict named Hill, who was nicknamed
“ Parson,” in consequence of his having been a leader in religious matters
in his younger days, adopted an ingenious 'ruse to save himself from a
flogging to which he had been sentenced for some petty theft. After
much protesting on account of the state of his health, he was bound to
the triangle, his back bared to the lash, the biting strands flew through
the air, and left nine livid streaks from shoulder to shoulder. An
official, stepping forward, deciphered the words, “ Thou shalt not kill,”
very roughly tattooed on his back the previous night by a fellow-
convict. The chaplain conferred in an undertone with the surgeon in
attendance, the result being that Hill, who was still screaming with
pain, was let off further flogging, his sentence being altered to three
months’ solitary confinement.
Each convict, on his arrival on the vessel, was stripped of his clothes,
which were then well fumigated and cleaned, bound in a bundle, and
labelled with all particulars as to the name and aliases (which were often
many) of the convict; the record of his crime and the name of the ship
in which he was transported being also stated. All tattoo marks, scars
and peculiarities were entered in a book for future reference as to identifi-
cation. Mermaids, ships, anchors, flags and fishes were most common
devices, being generally executed in somewhat rough fashion with needles
and gunpowder. Some, however, showed great originality in design and
clever workmanship. A powerful Irishman, named Heffernan, showed,
when stripped, the national flag of t his native isle hanging in folds over his
right shoulder. Others had hearts interwoven with their initials, crosses,
scriptural and religious emblems, one of the most remarkable being the
“Lord’s Prayer,” which was minutely inscribed in blue and red characters
on the breast of a prisoner named Macdonald, who escaped originally
from Cockatoo Island. His life of crime was convincing proof that this
external application of prayer was powerless to keep him from temptation.
At the stern of the vessel is “The Tigers’ Den,” an awful-looking
prison formed of stout two-inch iron bars, deeply embedded in the
solid beams above and below. Whether this miniature inferno was
so named because of the fierce and desperate ruffians who were herded
indiscriminately together, or because of their resemblance to tigers
* Now shown as an exhibit on board.


from their special yellow jackets, barred with black, it is difficult to
say, but it was certainly expressively named. Within this hellish den
quarrels aud fights were of frequent occurrence in the semi-darkness
that prevailed. Old grudges and grievances were wiped off. Woe
betide the wretched prisoner who at the Criminal Sessions had given
condemnatory evidence against his comrades! He was sure of their
retribution when once in their power. The warders never ventured
within, but quieted its wild and reckless occupants by presenting loaded
rifles through the bars with a threat to shoot the offenders, when the
disturbance was so great as to call for their interference.
The den was cleaned out by a convict named Gipsy Smith, who was
a favourite with Inspector Price, and was employed to do all the menial
offices ou board the hulk. When the door of the “Tigers’ Den” was

opened for this purpose, and when food was being conveyed to the
prisoners, the man so engaged was protected by the warders, who were
standing ready to fire upon the first man who attempted to rush the
narrow doorway. As oue stands and looks at the gruesome corner, and *
tries to picture what existence must have meant behind those thick iron
bars, and with little headway beneath the deck above, one marvels that
its inmates could long survive its tortures, or retain their reason for a
single day.
“ Despair had slowly tolled their knell ;
The world’s existence was a tear,
And life but one supreme farewell.”
The den is now occupied by a striking tableau representing the
murder on shore of Captain Price, the hated Inspector, of whose cruelty
and terrible death we shall have to speak later ou.


The corner cells on either side of the deck below, are the dreaded
“ Black Holes,” in which prisoners, who had been guilty of some breach
of discipline or fractious conduct, were punished by solitary confinement,
lasting from one to twenty-eight days, according to the gravity of the
offence committed, and, perhaps, we should also add, according to the
state of the gastric juices of the then Inspector-General. These small
and tapering torture-chambers measure only two feet eight inches across.
The doors fit as tight as valves, and close with a “swish,” excluding all
air, except what can filter through the perforated iron plate that was
placed over the bars above the door, in order to make the hole as dark
and oppressive as possible. A stout iron ring is fastened about kuee-high
in the shelving back of the cell, and through this riug the right wrist
of the prisoner was passed, and then handcuffed to the left hand; the
consequence being that he was thus prevented from standing upright or
lying down, but was obliged to stoop or lean against the shelving side
of the vessel, as it rolled to and fro at its moorings.
One hour’s exercise a day was all that the prisoner of the “ black hole ”
was granted, and the visitor who allows himself to be shut in, only for a
minute , and to have the massive bolt shot upon him, will realise such a
fearful feeling of suffocation that he will marvel at the comparative ease
with which some of the older offenders underwent their sentences, in an
attitude that was of itself a refinement of torture. Starved, beateu and
abused as they were, the wonder is that so many of even those hardened
villains were able to endure punishment aS they did.
That the majority of them were callous aud irreclaimable—more like
wild beasts than men—is possible; but the treatment they were shown
to have received on board, by the evidence given at a subsequent Govern-
ment inquiry, was such as to drive any man to desperation and despair.
Constant applications of the “ cat,” imprisonment in the “black hole,” and
other punishments were the instruments relied upon for producing a
reform. No wonder that the scaffold on shore had no terror for these men!
Death was a welcome release from the cruelties practised on board the
hulks.
As an example of some of the ingenious methods for inflicting
additional punishment on the prisoners we may mention a heartless
practice that was said to have been initiated during the reign of
Inspector Price. Rations having been stopped, a steak was at times
cooked at the end of the corridor on the deck, so that its appetising
odour could find its way through the bars over the doors of the convicts’
dark cells, and make their mouths water for the succulent meat, to which
their stomachs had oeen strange for so Ion" a time. Another fiendish
invention was the cayenne pepper mill,* which was worked as a special
punishment by a prisoner whose nose and eyes suffered severely from the
pungent, burning dust. It would, indeed, appear that instead of seeking
to reclaim the convicts, and riiake them fitter to mix with society when
their sentences had expired, the officers in power utterly destroyed all
chance of reformation, and by. their revengeful treatment eradicated any
lingering germ of better nature that is generally to be found in even
the most hardened ruffians.
In each of the larger cells on either side of the corridor the floor is
worn into hollows, ruts and grooves, close against each doorway, by the
constant jangling and friction of the prisoners’ leg-irons, as they stamped
impatiently, waiting for the stroke of the bell that marked the time for
meals or exercise—a sad and silent testimony to countless hours of miser-
able endurance. The square aperture through which the visitor to the
*“ Life and Adventures of Martin Cash, bushranger and convict.”


“ Success ” can now view the interior of each cell, did not, of course,
exist originally, the holes having merely been cut for the purpose of
enabling the public to see into the closed cell, and the lifelike model
representing the original occupant.
The convicts would lie crouching for hours in the dark recesses of their
prison, their eyes shining with an almost feline brightness. The warders
were, in many instances, savagely attacked when taken unawares. On the
morning of October, 7th, 1855, Warder Luscombe was engaged in distribut-
ing the morning’s rations, and removing the prisoners’ blankets, which had
to be neatly rolled up before being handed out each day. I/uscombe had
placed the food on a small shelf to the left of the door of the cell in which
the refractory “Captain” Melville was imprisoned, so as to free his hands
whilst he withdrew the heavy drawbolt. Immediately the warder opened
the door, the prisoner flew out upon him and stabbed him in the neck
and face with a sharp instrument, which proved to be a spoon he had
succeeded in sharpening to a point. The warder fell to the deck, badly
wounded, and w r as trampled upon by the heavy quarry boots of the
would-be murderer. A second warder immediately came to his wounded
comrade’s assistance on hearing his cries for help, and, after a desperate
struggle, succeeded in stunning Melville with a blow from a heavy
bunch of keys that he was carrying, just in time to save his com-
panion’s life.
Each one of those dark cells, if they could but speak, could tell
of some such murderous onslaught. Each ring-bolt has a record, each
chain a chapter of cruelty; and the very timbers that formed the home of
these human failures year after year are studded with initials and devices
that tell of sorrows past. In cell 23 the name of Harris, who made himself
notorious at the time of the Melville rush, may still be seen, and also a
rough design representing a ship.
In the same cell is the name of McNamara, the sou of an early convict
who was transported for having, when quite a youth, stolen seven pounds
weight of rusty bolts from the wheelwright of the village. He and a man
named Donahue, had roamed Van Dieman’s Hand, and finally expiated their
crimes on the scaffold. A favourite song that this outlaw and his gang
used to sing around their camp fire, when safe from pursuit in their
mountain retreat, ran as follows ;
“A life that is free as the bandits of old,
When Rome was the prey of the warriors bold,
Who knew how to buy gallant soldiers with gold,
Is the life ftill of danger,
Of Mac, the bushranger,
And brave Donahue,
“ If Ireland lies groaning—a hand at her throat,
Which foreigners have from the recreants bought,
Forget not the lessons our fathers have taught;
Though our Isle’s full of danger,
And held by the stranger—
Be brave and be true.
“ We’ve left the old island's hospitable shores
The lands of the Emmetts, the Tones and the Moores,
But Liberty o’er us her scalding tear pours,
And she points to the manger
Where He was a stranger
And perished for you.

A desperate struggle ensued.— Page 30,




" You may hurl us to crime and brand us with shame,
But think not to baulk us, our spirit to tame,
For we’ll fight to the last in ould Ireland’s name;
For we are bushrangers—
All else are but strangers—
And I’m Donahue.”
In many of the cells are to be found holes cut through the thick
partition wall, so that conversation might be carried on between the
convicts. Of one small hole, extending half-way through the hollow wall,
an amusing story is told. *
A convict, named Tribe, who was a good example of the evolution
of a criminal from a state of innocence to that of a confirmed villain,
was the cause of a good deal of trouble to the warders and the
Inspector-General, through the successful manner in which he used to
secrete small quantities of tobacco, in spite of all the precautions taken by
the authorities. He was searched frequently, but all in vain ; for an hour
after the search he would be found sitting contentedly chewing his beloved
weed. At last the Inspector, in desperation, promised the prisoner a small
reward if he would tell him how he came by the tobacco. The man
accepted the offer, and then gave a low whistle, when to the surprise of
the warder and the Inspector, out popped a little timorous mouse from the
hole, with a piece of tobacco tied to its tail.
The man had, it appeared, fed it regularly with crumbs from his rations,
and in this way had trained it to come out of its hiding-place at meal times,
and then to disappear between the walls of the cell, bearing its small
freight of the forbidden weed. Even the stern Inspector was captivated
by this unique sight and allowed the ingenious smuggler to go scot-free.
CHAPTER VI.
The hissing cords are clotted with man’s gore;
High in the air exultingly they wave
Over the fearless sinews that could brave
A convict’s death—a death which seldom bore
Dishonour’s aspect 1 How can we deplore,
Abhor sufficiently, such scenes? The grave
A thousandfold were preferable.
—Miss Toulmin, 1846,
FLOGGING, such as is said to have stopped garrotting in the
streets of London, and to which soldiers in the army have
also been subjected, lashed to a gun-wheel or a tree, was but
a mild infliction compared ; with the flagellation of the cruel
convict-days.
The brutal scourge, now shown on board the hulk “Success,” has
eight twisted strands of hard greenhide (untanned leather), each bound
with a running strand of brass wire, and with a heavy leaden pellet
tipping each lash. It is the original instrument, with which the convict
flagellator (fora reward of is. 9d. per day for “his faithful services,”
as the records have it) flogged his fellow-man. This authentic relic was
purchased from the grandson of a man whose family had (father and son
before him) been public flagellators in Van Dieman’s Land, the original
'White’s “ Crime and Criminals.' 1


owner’s initials, and other significant signs, being carved upon the handle.
The “ thief’s ” cat, or double cat, consisted of nine thongs of doubly-
twisted whipcord, each containing nine knots.
An old punishment record, to which the writer gained access,
complains of “ the inferior cord used, the extremities of the strands
becoming loose and open,” and adds that “this must be remedied and the
cord twisted tighter, as the bodily injury by bruising will be greater, and
that by laceration less.” And the “record” proceeds to detail the method
of counting and taking due time between each lash. It is signed by
Thomas Evernden, J.P., Superintendent of Police, Bathurst, New South
Wales. The instrument referred to by Mr. Evernden, and in use at that
time, consisted of five lashes of whipcord, each lash having seven knots,
the handle, with the Government stamp upon it, being about two feet long.
The severity of the infliction depended upon the separation of the tails
by the fingers of the flagellator before the scourge was hurled over his head,
and brought down with terrible precision upon the back of the prisoner.
Being equally dexterous with either hand,
twelve lashes were administered with the
right, and then twelve with the left, so as to
“ cross the cuts” most cruelly. If the convict
flagellator, from a merciful feeling, tried to
favour his victim by allowing the strands to fall together
with a dull thud upon his back, the pompous official, in
all the glory of gold-braided authority, standing watch in
hand, would shout, “ Comb your cats, my good man, comb
your cats,” and if the flagellator failed to do so, another
would be found only too willing to fill the odious office,
and the one who had given offence would be triced to the
triangle, as hundreds had been before him, and flogged for
“insubordination.” Official returns from Hobart Town
show that the total number of lashes inflicted during a
period of five years, was 33,723. Men were flogged for
idleness and neglect of duty; while eight women were
flogged at the gangway of the “Marquis of Cornwallis,”
the soldiers and sailors of that British transport taking it
in turns to ply the awful “ lash.”
The flogging frame and triangle now on board the
“ Success ” are the originals that were used on shore, and
the evidence of those who witnessed the revolting sight of
a struggling, shrieking criminal in the throes of the lash
usually allowed that from that point forward the reforma-
tion of the convict became a very distant probability. The
punishment aroused his brutal passions and made him desperate and
reckless. As one prisoner said on being released, “ It’s the first time I
have been flogged, and it shall be the last ”; and that man’s word
became true, for he made a murderous assault upon an unsuspecting
warder, battering him to death, and he was hanged for the crime shortly
afterwards.
Others became so inured to the lash, through constant flogging, as to be
perfectly insensible to all pain. It is related of one convict named Abeam,
undergoing a sentence of a hundred lashes, that he bore his flogging
without a wince or murmur, even counting aloud the number of each
lash, and at the last one coolly cried, “Domino.” Another degraded
ruffian, who boasted of a record of 1,000 lashes in his lifetime, was
triced to the triangles for a grave offence, and was fairly cut to pieces
with the lash. On being released, he confronted the officials defiantly


with, “ Now, I’ll fight the best man amongst you! ” Such conduct, no
doubt, shows extraordinary powers of endurance and much courage, but
felon hero-worship must take no part in this description.
Several convicts on board the hulk had undergone from 500 to
800 lashes, and more than one could boast of as many as 1,500. Under
the ‘ assignment ’ system they had been flogged for idleness, for not
ploughing or hoeing a sufficient area of their master’s fields and even on
suspicion of their oeing guilty, or having some knowledge of robberies
that had been committed. That men were flogged merely on suspicion,
the following incident, cited in an official record headed, “ New South
Wales Punishments,” but commonly called the “Torture Proceedings,”
will serve as an example. Henry Bayne was accused of knowing where
goods and money robbed from a farmer named Beach, of Parramatta,
ad been hidden. He denied all knowledge of the matter, and although
only one witness appeared against the man, and it was purely a case
of suspicion, the prisoner was flogged five mornings in succession, and on
the sixth day was brought before the magistrates, Mr. W. Lawson,
Dr. McLeod and Dr. Douglas, who further punished him with a sentence
of twelve months’ transportation to Port Macquarie.
That able student of Australia’s early days, Price Warung, in his
“Tales of the Convict System,” has given us a picture of the flagellator’s
work, both vivid and horrible: “He (the flagellator) was a past master in
the art of flaying his brother alive; no mere tyro, he could use the cat
with either hand with equal facility. He could do as much execution with
his wrist as most men could by exerting their whole muscular strength,
and could detach with each knotted tail of whipcord a narrow riband of
skin. Indeed, he could encompass with his left hand that most difficult of
flogging feats, the marking of the back with just three rows of pendant
strips of skin, with one drop of blood —no more —tipping each point of
cuticle like a glowing ruby on a piece of velvet.”
From the masthead of the “ Success ” the British flag hung limp, as
if disgraced, not only by the scenes at the triangles, but by the frequent
assaults (detailed later on in these pages) by warders upon chained and
defenceless men.
The reader will not be surprised that at the quarries on shore the
convicts, though in 141b. irons, required all the vigilance of the warders
to prevent attempts at escape. Day after day they were landed at the
little stone jetty from the “yellow frigates” to work at the excavations
on the foreshore. Besides the overseers, a cordon of armed guards
prevented the approach of any person, or the escape of any prisoner.
Standing out from the “Success” was the Electra, a war sloop (then
under Commander Morris), her presence certainly had a restraining
influence upon would-be “ rushers ”or escapees. On the opening of the
Geelong railway, great festivities were held to celebrate the “cutting of
the first sod,” and the Electra left the “Success” unprotected, and
proceeded to Corio Bay to join in the demonstration. The convicts saw,
in her absence, an opportunity to make an attempt to overpower the
guards. Flannery, a determined and dangerous ruffian, headed the revolt.
At a given signal the guards were simultaneously “ rushed,” but not
surprised, for they promptly replied with a deadly fire, which threw the
convicts into dire confusion. With stones thirty of the prisoners boldly
“ ovaled” * their leg-irons, and reports of muskets rang out right and left.
* The process of “ oraling ” consisted in pounding their anklets edgeways with
a double-handed stone till they had burst the rivets, and the convicts in that way
gained their freedom. (See exhibit on board the “ Success,”)


Nine of the convicts were terribly wounded. Flannery afterwards had to
undergo amputation of a leg, and three of his followers suffered in similar
manner. Howling with rage and pain, the prisoners loudly cursed their
leader, and found out, when too late, that they had made (as Mark Twain
would say) “a mistake of large dimensions.” Repulsed in their first mad
“ rush,” they took refuge behind the stone heaps, and endeavoured to
disable the warders with well-aimed stones. Flag signals passed from
the “Success,” and boatloads of warders from the different hulks soon
overpowered the prisoners, who were taken back to the vessel in dogged
submission. The re-ironing of the fractious prisoners was finished by
the convict blacksmith just as darkness set in. Enraged at their capture,
the noise they raised that night was simply indescribable. They clanked
their chains in unison upon the ironwood floor, they yelled defiance at
the authorities, and with the only article of furniture their cells contained
they battered the massive doors of their prison. Full vent was given to
their passion, and the air was filled with riot and obscenity. The
Inspector-General feared the worst, and had the hatchway gridiron
gratings battened down, so that should
“ Locks, bolts and bars fly asunder,”
and the ruffians break loose, most of them, being below the water-line,
would still be well under control. For hours the warders watched, armed
with loaded rifles, at the “combings” of the hatches, and those on shore
listened to the shrieks that came across the Bay, till they spent themselves
at last in one prolonged discordant roar. Just as the riot had nearly
expended itself, H.M.S. Victoria , a war sloop, then under Commander
Norman, arrived to suppress the reported disorder, and stood with
shotted guns and ports open, ready to pour a broadside into the rebels’
prison, and sink her where she lay, should occasion demand. Had she
arrived but half-an-hour earlier, that course would undoubtedly have been
pursued, and the now historic ship would have been sunk at her moorings,
with all her hideous cargo of crime. The ringleader of this rush had
escaped from the Richmond stockade, which then occupied the picturesque
bend on the Yarra, the exact site upon which J. Kennon and Sons’
extensive tanneries, near Melbourne, now stand. Sergeant Gardner (who
was transferred from that stockade to the position of chief warder of the
“Success” in 1854) was mainly responsible for the privilege of quarry
work, which Flannery just then had gained. The authorities were
determined that incidents like the “Flannery rush” should be put a stop
to, and the hulks were accordingly placed under the surveillance of the
military. H.M. 40th Regiment were ordered from Melbourne to Williams-
town, and an officer and military guard were stationed upon each of the
yellow frigates. This display of militarism gave great offence to the
prisoners, and there was a sullen look in the eye of many an “old hand,”
as, in marching past, they unwillingly gave the regulation salute to the
soldiers in authority. One burly prisoner, named Braunigan, refused
point blank to touch his cap to the officer, who (as he insolently phrased
it) “ wore a Government knife by his side, and a brass band round his
head to keep his brains in.” This act of insubordination was met with a
sentence of seven days’ solitary confinement.
The exasperated spirit of these dangerous ruffians sought another
opportunity to combine, and at all costs gain their freedom. Painful
disclosures had been made from time to time, revealing that frightful
barbarities had been practised on the prisoners.


CHAPTER VII.
DR. JOHN SINGLETON (at one time Chaplain on board the
“Success”) was a man whose word no one questioned, a
Christian philanthropist, and a true friend of the people. He
was the first to expose the cruel treatment of the prisoners
upon the hulks, and it was owing to his zeal that the ‘ * Citizens’
Committee ” was formed. The following leading men were prominent
members of the committee: Sir George Stephen, David Blair, Rev. Dr.
Shiel, Rev. A. Ramsay, George Elliott Burton, William J. Little, J. G.
Burt, Adam Anderson, Dr. Cairns, George Mackay, LL-D., and Henry
Jennings. Mass meetings were held by the citizens, and resolutions
carried condemning the cruel practices upon the prison ships. The
Government, however, were deaf to all appeals, and slow to move.
Meanwhile, on board the hulks a deadly hate was fostered by the
agitation between the prisoners and their officers. To the convicts,
murder was just a matter of opportunity, and the warders retaliated by
methods that made the horrors of Norfolk Island and Port Arthur “pale
their ineffectual fires,” A correspondent writing to the Melbourne Age,
November 25th, 1857, said: “I have seen the dungeons of Spielburg,
and the miseries of the galleys, and experienced the horrors (as a visitor)
of the Continental gaols; I have crossed the ‘ Bridge of Sighs,’ and been
down to the uttermost depths of the prison beyond, where the ‘Council of
Ten ’ immured their victims for ever, but not one of these is to be
compared in refinement of cruelty and multiplication of horrors to the
floating hells of Victoria.”
To the convicts the gallows was considered a release from misery
worse than death. They girded at their guards, and scorned the
warders’ rifles by rushing for the bulwarks. But instead of being shot,
as they anticipated, they were flogged for insubordination or attempted
escape. The convict Power in after years used to relate how, as they
paced the deck encumbered by their heavy irons, they insulted the
sentries on guard with their upraised, outspread fingers.
On the 4th of June, 1856, the convict Melville was one of ten at
exercise on the main deck. He loitered behind, instead of keeping the
regular distance from the other prisoners, as provided by the regulations.
Sergeant Graham ordered him to “close up.” Melville thereupon
stepped out of the ranks, and told that officer “that he would be treated
with more respect.” For his insolence he was ordered below, and Warder
Macpherson and a Mr, Horne followed Sergeant Graham and the
prisoner to the “dark cell.” .On his wrists being freed from the hand-
cuffs, Melville sprang with butl-dog ferocity at the officer in charge, and
fastening his teeth in the face of the struggling sergeant, nearly bit off
his nose.
Macpherson sprang upon the convict’s back, while Horne
vigorously belaboured him, till he fell insensible to the deck with the
warders on top of him, and he was then soon secured. That same
afternoon Mr. (afterwards Captain) Pascoe, the visiting magistrate,
sentenced Melville to “twenty days’ solitary,” chained short to the ring-
bolt. On the third day the chain was lengthened, thereby giving the
prisoner an opportunity of resting on the floor.
In August, 1856, the Gisborne “ rush ” took place, the ringleader
being shot through the body. On the 22nd of October, in the same year,


a shocking and sensational affray took place between the convicts and
their guards, attended by loss of life on both sides. The notorious
Melville was again brought into prominence as the leader of this
insurrection. Further on we give fuller details of the eventful career
of this desperate criminal.
The Citizens’ Committee at last obtained by their agitation the
appointment of a Select Committee of the Legislative Council. They
were empowered by resolution to take evidence as regards the administra-
tion of justice on board the hulks, and the following Members of Parliament
formed that tribunal: Messrs. Cruikshank, Mitchell, Miller, McCoombie,
Hood and Harvey, the latter having been previously secretary of the
Anti-Transportation League.
Mr. Hallis, Superintendent of the “Success,” and other officers and
even prisoners, gave evidence, though the testimony of the latter must
naturally be taken cum grano salts. Public opinion was greatly divided,
and feeling ran very high. It was the fashion in some circles to extol the
severe Inspector-General Price as a most exemplary official, while
others sided with the Committee as humanitarians. The evidence given
on oath at the enquiry, and published in The Melbourne Age , 25th
November, 1856, elicited the following facts :
A man named Duncan, the best workman at “the hulks,” was ordered
extra irons for merely asking for lighter ones. A prisoner named Cussen
had been thrown from the top deck to the centre deck, from the centre to
the lower, and then set upon by warders most brutally, until his blood
flowed in all directions. It was stated that a man named Murphy had two
years added to his sentence for drawing himself up and looking through
the top bars of his cell, but this was afterwards shown to have been for
a much more grievous offence. Another witness stated that convict
Walker was not in his right senses when sent to “ the hulks ” ; yet on his
arrival he was sentenced to thirty days’ solitary; a pound of bread was
passed to him daily, and water lowered to him through the bars. A
convict stated that “ water-gagging ” was frequently adopted to stop their
breath. Buckets of water were said to have been thrown upon them from
a great height; and the barber, Fielder, stated that it was impossible
to dress the hair of his fellow-prisoners, owing to the numerous open
wounds the convicts had received upon their heads from the batons of the
warders. Other witnesses denounced the Members of the Committee as
grievance-mongers, and Dr, Youl, one of the visiting magistrates, spoke
strongly in favour of Mr. Price, and said that he was satisfied that the
Inspector-General, though one of the most powerful men in the country,
had never struck a prisoner in his life. Dr. Mcßae said he had never
seen any cruelty towards the convicts, and that Mr. Price had always
acted towards them with the greatest consideration, when they deserved
it. The Inspector himself, at the enquiry, said that all his hopes of
reforming the prisoners had gone. The convicts on board the “ Success ”
were more like wild beasts than men, and it was necessary to iron them
heavily, even below the water-lhie, to break their spirits and render them
more tractable. He stated that Melville had secreted a long knife in
his cell the day after the last outbreak, with the firm intention of killing
a warder.
The Melbourne Age, November 25th, 1856, also commented upon the
Inspector-General’s evidence as follows: “His avowed principles of
penal discipline are, first, that the reformation of a criminal is hopeless;
and, secondly, that extreme severity is the only method by which
criminals can be governed. Mr. Inspector Price’s principles cannot be
tolerated in this community. They are rejected with abhorrence by all


men of intelligence and humane feeling. There must be a more search-
ing enquiry.”
The Melbourne Argus, on the other hand, claimed that the Inspector-
General’s character was vindicated, and wrote that punishment could
not be effected without being cruel, with penal establishments as they
were.
The Mount Alexander Mail , the leading country journal, wrote, on
December 3rd, 18561 ‘‘The editor of the Aygtts is accused of wishing to
sacrifice ‘Melville,’ and save its own pet, Mr, _ Price”; and, later on,
December Bth, published the following prophetic words “Is blood to be
shed, or murder in some shape or way to be committed before the
Victorian Government will open their eyes to abuses in the penal
system over which they are supposed to have control ?”
Still, no Parliamentary action was taken, and, three months after-
wards Inspector-General John Price was assassinated at the quarries on
shore, in broad daylight, by a furious crowd of angry convicts, under the
following circumstances.
CHAPTER VIII.
The Assassination oe Inspector Price.

By which Heaven moves in pardoning guilty man,
And he that shows none, being ripe in years,
And conscious of the outrage he commits,
Shall seek it, and not find it, in his turn .—Cowper.
THE ’tween-decks of tlie old “Success” presented an animated
appearance on the glorious morning of the 26th March, 1857,
when Mr. Hallis, the Superintendent of the hulk, mustered his
men for the labour of the day between the mustering barriers
that still remain. While engaged in this duty an old soldier named
Taylor, complained that the chief warder had robbed him of his portmii
of bread. The convict was evidently much angered, and Mr. Hallis
ordered him below. The man obeyed instantly, and the otheis P r °c e £de
to the quarries; but on landing they refused point blank to work till they
had seen Inspector-General Price. That gentleman being in Melbourne,
Mr Hallis went to the city to report the charge made by the overseer,
together with the news as to the mutiny of the prisoners Mr. Price
returned to Williamstown without delay, and accosting the first prisoner,
Henry Smith (alias Shylock), asked him the nature of his complaint. He
replied that Taylor’s bread had been kept back by the chief warder, and
said further that the quality of the bread was very inferior. Taking a
piece from another convict’s he added, “ Here is a sample.
Mr. Hallis, who was present, said that the bread shown was not that
morning’s, but was two or three days old.
Mr Price then said, “Anyhow, no prisoner is allowed to have two
rations* at once, and you have a deal to say, and a great many complaints
to make.”
“Yes” replied the convict, “I have a thousand.” The Inspector-
General then moved on, accompanied by Mr. Hallis, and Smith
grumblingly resumed his work.
Next a prisoner named Williams asked that part of his sentence might
be remitted, but this could not be granted as he had been an absconder.
Another prisoner named Brannigan made a similar request, and Red


Kelly, the father of the bushrangers of later years, asked whether a
sentence of three days’ solitary, which he had received a week before
would affect his ticket-of-leave. Detore,
Mr. 1 rice and Mr. Hallis agreed that he would have to wait mV mnutlic

overseers formed a ring round the Inspector, but the way was cleared by
a brawny convict, who struck out right and left. The convirt

him in the face, as he fought in self-defence. In retreating backward!

The Inspector was carried on a hand-barrow to the lighthouse by
convicts who thought thus to ingratiate themselves and secure a coim

offering any resistance, and, although thirty-three convicts had burst their
leg-chains with the tools at the quarry forge, they were soon recaptured
and lodged in their cells. These hardened wretches, exulting in their
butchery, then gave three defiant cheers for the ‘ ‘ Success,” and were
answered by the convicts on the sister* hulk, the President. The
tampering with the leg-irons was regarded by the officials as a crime of
great enormity. “Jacky” Williams was one of the number who, with
chisels and spalling-hammers, had relieved each other of their “leg-
ornaments,” as they were referred to by the convicts. Their handiwork
was rewarded by the infliction of the wearing of “ the punishment band,”
or “body-iron,” a steel contrivance encircling the body, and from which
projected strong iron outriggers for the wrists, thereby holding the arms
extended forward for hours, in a benumbed and painful position.
One section of the Press imputed the murder of Captain Price to the
unnatural system adopted by the deceased Inspector-General.
The Melbourne Age , in a leading article, contained the following,
referring to the enquiry of the “ Citizens’Committee Enough was
proved to warrant the suspension of Mr. Price twenty times over, but the
Government was perfectly indifferent. There can be no doubt whatever
that Mr. Price was guilty of the cruelty attributed to him, and his
untimely end is the result of that vindictive feeling which his own policy
has fostered in the minds of the convicts under his charge. The whole
affair lies in a nutshell. He was a cruel man, and his cruelly came back
to him."
Months before the tragedy occurred, a Melbourne clergyman forwarded
to the leading newspaper a bulky pamphlet written by the Rev. Thomas
Rogers,* who was Chaplain at Norfolk Island at the time that Mr. Price
was Commandant there. Commenting upon its reception, the editor
remarked (.Melbourne Age, September 19th, 1857): “If the horrible details
that it contained had been published at the height of the excitement
about the hulks, the Inspector-General, instead of being murdered by the
convicts, might have been torn to pieces in the streets of Melbourne.”
The Melbourne Argus, on the other hand, maintained that the Inspector
was so just that he lost his life through his great attention to the
professed complaints of the convicts.
The trial of the prisoners commenced on April 13th, 1857, Judge Barry
presiding. The fifteen prisoners accused of wilful murder at the inquest
were first arraigned, and each pleaded “Not guilty.” On the third day
of the trial the jury found the prisoners guilty and sentence of death was
pronounced. On the 16th, five other convicts were placed in the dock,
their trial lasting four days. Finally, Williams, Smith, Maloney, Bryant,
Brannigan, Chesley and Brown were sentenced to death and executed,
this being the most hideous week’s work of the gallows ever known in the
Colony of Victoria.
* The Rev. Thomas Rogers gave evidence before a Select Committee of the English
House of Commons regarding the treatment of the convicts.


CHAPTER IX.
THE fearful death of the Inspector-General roused the politicians
from their inaction, and on the nth September, 1857, after volu-
minous evidence had been taken, the Report of the Select
Committee was brought before Parliament, and the death-blow was
dealt to the old hulk system. The agitation resulting from the painful
disclosures had borne good fruit. On the 3rd October, 1857, Mr. Blair, M.P.,
moved “ That the Report of the Select Committee on penal discipline,
brought up on the nth September, be adopted.” This was seconded
by Mr. William Danglands, M.P., and carried overwhelmingly. Targe prisons
were then erected on shore, commensurate with the size and importance
of Melbourne, the “ Oueen city of the south.”
For a few mouths the old “Success” rode at her moorings absolutely
untenanted, save by large flocks of noisy sea-gulls; but shortly afterwards
she was ordered to be utilised as a prison for refractory seamen. The
term “refractory” was often applied by the captains of outward-bound
ships to those sailors who showed an inclination to desert for the gold-
fields.
By an Order in Council all the hulks were removed from Williams-
town to Sandridge in 1857, and from 1860 to 1868 the “Success” was
used as a “women’s prison.” A sentence of only a few nights on
board had its effect on the most irreclaimable viragos in Victoria.
In 1869 the historic hulk was handed over to the Sir Harry Smith , and
used as a sleeping-place for the worst boys of that reformatory.
For many years the “Success” was moored in an out-of-the-way
part of the Salt-water River, and was employed as a store hulk for
the powder and ammunition used by the Defence Department of the
Colony of Victoria. Finally, the prison hulks, one and all (as relics of a
convict system offensive to the recollection of all Australians), were
ordered to be sold on the express condition that they were to be broken
up, and their associations lost to the recollection of the residents of
Melbourne. By a clerical omission that condition did not appear upon
the terms of sale of the “Success,” hence she has outlived the other four,
and is to-day the only Australian convict-ship afloat.
In the last few months of 1890 she first appeared before the public as
a ship on show, and even in that role her career was fraught with
incident. Governments were petitioned, influence was brought to bear,
and sums were offered privately for the removal of the figures of some
of the original occupants of the old convict prison. At Sydney, New
South Wales, the exhibition so roused the resentment of a class of
haughty colonists, who patronisingly came on board, peered through the
keyholes of the cells, sniffed contemptuously at their stuffed ancestors,
disclaimed any relationship, and planned revenge. At midnight, on
March 10th, 1892, the vessel was stealthily boarded, and all the figures
were mutilated and damaged beyond repair. The “ Success ” rose
superior to this wanton outrage. Two months later, however, she was
maliciously scuttled and disappeared—it was thought and hoped, by
some, for ever—beneath the waters of the picturesque harbour of Port
Jackson. Nothing daunted, the enterprise of the proprietors was equal
to the occasion, and five and a half months later the raising of the vessel
(which had had eight augur-holes bored through her fine teak timbers)
was an accomplished fact.


Grey with barnacles and bemantled with seaweed, the submersion only
served to make the appearance of the centenarian convict-ship still more
remarkable and grotesque; and since that time she has, as an exhibition
ship, fully justified her name by everywhere creating immense interest as
a unique relic of convict days. The “ Success ” serves as an antique and
useful reminder of a condition of things that existed prior to the establish-
ment of that high-water mark in the history of Australia—the absolute
abolition of transportation.
There are some who contend that no tradition attaches to, nor
interesting remnants of bygone ages are to be found in, Australasia to
reward the research of the historian. Colonial ruins are not, as in
older countries, crumbling cathedrals and tottering abbeys which later
generations regard with a religions reverence, but Britain’s convict
prisons in the last stage of decay, moss-grown corridors of cells, the
regularity of which is broken by Time's effacing fingers, and half-hidden
by wild creeping vines and undergrowth, as if Nature herself were anxious
to assist in hiding them from sight.
Colonial Governments have, year after year, expended large sums
of money in razing these prisons to the ground. By a special order
of the Legislature, a public bonfire at Bathurst, N.S.W., burnt all the
incriminating convict records that could be collected at that time; and
the abandoned prison hulks that still remained were ordered to be
broken up and lost from public view. But why should that leaf
in the history of Australia be turned down ? Is it not a matter for
congratulation that the colonies have risen superior to, aud outlived, the
base effects of England’s well-iuteutioned experiment in convict colonisa-
tion, aud have gained prestige amongst the nations of the earth ?
Convictism presses most hardly upon those whose forefathers’ names
are written in ineffaceable letters of blood in the early records as despots
and t} ? rants, who were often guilty of the grossest maladministration. In
those days, cruelty was inflicted both on land aud sea, in penitentiary
and prison ship, by officers whose distance from headquarters made them
practically irresponsible.
As to the convicts themselves, although the large majority were the
offscourings of the British penitentiaries, they were yet not by any means
all commonplace offenders. Some were men of superior birth and
education—revolutionary waiters, expatriated preachers, lawyers, lords,
and sons of noblemen ; even a monarch, the ex-King of Iceland, became
a convict in Australia, having been transported for publishing a book
entitled “ The Religion of Christ, the Religion of Nature.” No wonder
that Barrington—himself but a London pickpocket—felt honoured by
the company with which he was surrounded in the prison settlement
of Sydney: and in humorous verses of his own composition he used to
recite: 4
“True patriots all, for be it understood
We left our country for our country's good;
No private views disgraced our generous zeal,
What urged our travels was our country’s weal;
And none will doubt but that our emigration
Has proved most useful to the British nation.”
By the criminal code of England (operating as late as 1000) there were
one hundred and sixty different offences for which the penalty was death ;
branding in the hand and transportation being the penalties for offences of
lesser gravity. Aud in times of political turmoil many of those who crossed
the sea in custody were men of advanced opinions, who had spoken out
boldly against the wrongs they saw around them. In point of fact, the


very actions that would now give a man a reputation as a labour leader
and help him to a seat in Parliament, then branded him as a man who
was dangerous to society, and whose only fit place was Botany Bay.
The mortality among them is shown to have been so great that of the
second fleet that sailed only fifty per cent, of the convicts that left the
United Kingdom arrived in Australia. In later years half-a-guiuea a
head was paid to the surgeon-in-charge for every prisoner he delivered
safe and sound. Still later (transportation to Western Australia did not
cease till 1868), these surgeon-superintendents had such inducements held
out to them to pay the convicts attention that a pint of wine and luxuries,
such as sago, sugar and lime-juice, were often granted to the prisoners.
Their leg-irons were unriveted when well out at sea, and on Australia
being sighted, the carpenter of the vessel usually had to invest each
prisoner anew with his load of ankle-iron. The sorrowful faces of the
prisoners on resuming their chains used to command the sympathy of all
those who worked the ship.
The treatment of the prisoners on the coastal transport ships was
barbarous in the extreme. En route from Hobart to Norfolk Island the
custom was to shackle the whole of the convicts by the heels to an
immense cable that ran from stem to stern, passed through the hatchway
and was connected with the windlass; so that when there were any signs
of a disturbance amongst the prisoners a turn or two of the windlass
would haul the prisoners’ heels uppermost in the air, and in this painful
position they -would be kept till the skipper considered he had given his
victims a sufficient lesson.
At the establishments on shore suits of spiked iron were worn, and
tortures inconceivable inflicted. The intention of the British Govern-
ment was, no doubt, to offer the convicts an opportunity—through their
good behaviour and industry—of regaining some of the advantages
they had forfeited; but their good scheme was stultified by reason
of the tyrannical task-masters in whose hands lay the administration of
the law they so little regarded.
In that land of lovely lake and waterfall, of sombre mountains
towering to the skies, hiding beneath their forest-clad sides a wealth
of gold and mineral deposits, men slept in heavy chains, debarred
from every privilege, and envied the very animals which enjoyed
a freedom of which they could only dream. What wonder that the more
venturesome amongst them should make a bold dash for freedom,
and plunge into the unexplored interior ?
Freeing themselves from their leg-irons, they crossed the mountain
gorges, and passing through the dense bush, they scaled the lofty
ranges to their very summit. From east to west extended rolling
downs, besprinkled with the gorgeous flora with which Nature
has decked the dormant solitudes of Australia. Large tracts of
fertile plain, where the Aborigines roamed in undisturbed freedom, were
first seen from mountain heights by felons -who had lived for years
in chains, and finally became inmates of the hulk “ Success ” at Port
Phillip.
Vast changes have taken place since the days of those early criminal
explorers. Vast changes have taken place, also, in the treatment of the
criminal classes since the scandalous abuses to which we have referred
tarnished England’s reputation.
Now, possibly, the tendency of public opinion is rather to err
in the opposite extreme, and to make our prisons as much too
comfortable as before they were revolting. Magistrates find that the
same offenders appear before them again and again at almost regular


intervals, these periodic lodgers at the expense of the Crown seeing
that a vicious life pays them better than an honest one.
For students of the criminal classes, and of that great and difficult
problem of prison-reform, the convict-ship “ Success ” must possess
especial interest. The old’ hulk may be seen to-day practically in the
identical condition in which she was when moored off Williamstown.
There are the double rows of dark cells, the “ black holes ” and the
“tigers’ den.’’ There are the mustering barriers, the flogging frame, the
compulsory bath, and the various implements of punishment that were
used so unsparingly in the past. Yes, and there are the convicts also;
but, though lifelike and startling in their prison garb, as they appear to
gaze at you with their fierce eyes through the aperture in their cell doors,
they are as harmless as their own dust that is now mingled with their
mother earth in the far-off Australia.
But if the “ Success ” possesses a gruesome interest on account of her
eventful and crime-stained record, her proprietors have endeavoured to
impart a bright side to the picture.
Instead of the prison bell tolling its mournful monotone, soft music
may now be heard at intervals, stealing along the decks that have ever
been strangers to sweet sounds. H'oliday-seekers in large numbers
may be seen listening with the closest attention to the explanations and
many thrilling stories which the attendants have to tell. Aloft from
mast to mast stretch the flags of all nations in bright array, a rain-
bow of promise, heralding that better day when Mercy, that
“ Droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven,”
shall henceforth season Justice.

Part II.—The “Success” Prisoners.


PART II.
THE “SUCCESS” PRISONERS.
WK have so far dealt with the history of the vessel and some of
the typical incidents which occurred from time to time in
the lives of those on board this “ floating hell.” We must now
turn our attention to the state of Australia at the time, and
to some of the more notorious prisoners who passed a portion of their
existence on the “ Success.”
We have already alluded to the fact that some of the unexplored
tracts of Australia’s fertile interior were seen for the first time by felons
who had succeeded in making good their escape. For countless miles
around them stretched the virgin bush. Range behind range of moun-
tains clothed from base to summit with the dull green foliage of the
eucalyptus, or “ blue gums,” presented a sombre panorama to those who
gazed from some commanding height.
Not a sound broke the deathly silence that reigned supreme over the
mountain and down the valley that lost itself in leafy gloom. No sign
of life met the eye, save for the occasional darting of a bird, whose throat
eave forth no joyful notes such as eutrance the ear in England’s woods
and dales Even the feathered creation seemed to have imbibed the
deep melancholy that was inseparable from the mind when looking forth
on the timbered landscape of undeveloped Australia. Sometimes a faint
perfume resembling incense, caused by the burning of the eucalyptus,
would betray the encroachment of man into these solitudes, and a wreath
of smoke trailing skywards amidst the distant tree-tops would indicate
the spot where the settler was clearing the ground for what perhaps
afterwards became a flourishing township.
Such was the country in which those who escaped from the hands
of justice found themselves. But beside the boundless freedom and
liberty presented to them, there was also the hope of achieving riches
through the discovery of gold which was found to richly leaven the
Port Phillip Settlement, and they found it a much easier and pleasanter
task to waylay and rob those who had successfully toiled after the
precious metal, than go to the .trouble of seeking it themselves. Thus, in
a short time bauds of bushrangers, mounted on the fleetest horses, spread
themselves over the country, defying all authority, and robbing gold
escorts and mail drivers with the dread command, “ Bail up ”; any resist-
ance being speedily overcome by the free use of the revolver.
«• The good old rule, the simple plan,
That they may take who have the power,
And they may keep who can.”
To such a chaotic state had the condition of society come through
the inadequacy of police protection, that one notorious outlaw (who


as an old man became an inmate of the hulk “Success”) had the
temerity to write a letter, addressed—“ From the Governor of the Ranges
to the Governor of the Town,” offering terms whereby for a stated sum
to be enclosed in a free pardon, and sent to him in his mountain retreat
he would surrender and give up his life of crime.
ihe state of the country at that time was so desperate that even this
cool communication could not be treated with contempt, and Major Nairue
went as an ambassador to treat with the outlaw, and practically accepted
his terms. r
CAPTAIN MELVILLE.
“Captain Melville,” whose real name was Frank McCallum, was trans-
ported at the age of eighteen for the trivial offence of stealing a potato pie
from a cart m a street of his native village of Paisley, in Scotland. His
case impresses upon one very strikingly the fact that men were transported
in those days for the most petty crimes. In examining some old and time-
stained records in a prison, now in ruins, close to Wellclose Square,
London, the writer came across an entry which was worthy to so side bv
side with that of Captain Melville.
It stated that N R was transported on December 17th, 1785,
for stealing six ounces of sewing silk, of the value of tenpence! Nor
were these cases exceptional, for many of the convicts who served their
sentences on the “Success” were transported for no more serious offences
than stealing a few geese on a Yorkshire common, forging a tenpenny
stamp, or committing an act of the most petty larceny, as in Melville’s
case. The description of the offences for which the early convicts were
sent out was often purposely omitted from the official records, as can be
seen on examining an original “conditional pardon,” dated 1832, and now
displayed on the upper deck of the “Success,” It is signed by Major
Richard Bourke, the Governor of the time, decorated with a massive red
seal, and filled in with a detailed description of the prisoner, even the
colour of his hair and eyes being stated; and yet, strange to say, no
explanation is inserted after the word “ offence,” a significant omission
plainly implying that it was too trivial to be gravely recorded on such a
document.
Captain Melville arrived at Port Puer, Port Arthur, Tasmania, in the
transport ship Minerva (originally one of Nelson’s old flagships), with
one hundred and forty-eight other prisoners, who had “left their country
for their country’s good.” The condition of society, the admixture of bond
and free, and the conduct of those in power, gave rise to the remark, that,
at that time, there were but two classes in the colony, viz. : “those who
were in gaol and those who ought to be." Naturally a bold and determined
man, the cruelty to which he was subjected made Melville a dangerous
designing ruffian. Escaping from the “chain-gang,” he lived a lawless
life for years in Van Dieman’s Land. There, for robbery at Launceston,
he was sentenced to seven years’ imprisonment, but escaping from
custody, he found his way as a stowaway to Port Phillip, where he became
the leader of an armed baud of bushrangers and brigands. The robbery
of the Mclvor gold escort gained him much notoriety. He contrived
however, for years to escape the meshes of the law most skilfully.
The following incident wall show the daring and softer qualities that
were so stangely mixed in the character of this clever rogue. Upon one
occasion he made an uninvited appearance at the station of a Mr. Keenan,
in the Wimmera District of Victoria. The mother and daughters were


dressed in evening attire, ready to start for a musical party at a neigh*
bouring farm; but Melville, with many regrets and apologies, said that he
must request them to give him the pleasure of their company instead.
With a loaded revolver in his hand, he summoned everyone—servants
and all—to the drawing-room, where, choosing a seat near the piano
from which he commanded the door, he sat himself down to enjoy a
musical evening. At his special request, oue of the young ladies sang a
lullaby, which seemed to rouse the musician’s soul within this desperate
character. He then sat down at the pianoforte, and played an exquisitely
soft and dreamy melody that excited the admiration of the whole company.
Suddenly a heavy footstep was heard upon the verandah, and the next
moment an excited sergeant of police stood in the open doorway. Melville
sprang to his feet and instantly covered him with his revolver. “ Surren-
der,” demanded the bushranger. The sergeant, taken completely by
surprise, darted backwards and banged the door, holding the handle
with both hands. He shouted to his men for assistance, but Melville had
by this time jumped through the open window and disappeared among
the brushwood, just as a red-faced and breathless trooper came too late
upon the scene. The officer swore loudly at the constable, and fired his
rifle at the retreating form of the outlaw; but the shot went wide of its
mark. “ Secure his horse,” shouted the sergeant; but they were again
too late. A shrill whistle, which was answered by a whinnying from
Melville’s black mare, was heard, and Melville, with a burst of ironical
laughter, leaped on her back, and was gone like a flash.
Of the many hairbreadth escapes and brushes with the police which
this extraordinary man had, the following, often told by himself on board
the hulk, will serve as another example.
A reward of was offered by the Government for his capture,
dead or alive, but for many he successfully baffled the police. At
last he was sighted upon a jaded horse, skirting the spur of a mountain
range, and five troopers from the “ Ovens ” district immediately started
in hot pursuit. The outlaw at once spurred on his horse, and on their
gaining the level country the troopers’ inferior steeds “baulked” at the
country fences, and only two were able to follow the bushranger in his
flight. Melville’s fine black mare was gradually out-distancing his pur-
suers when, on looking backward to see what progress the police were
making, he was suddenly thrown to the ground through coming in contact
with the low branch of a eucalyptus tree, and his horse galloped away.
He was rendered insensible by the fall, and on recovering consciousness
he found that he had been secured, and was bound hand and foot with
the new rope halters used by the troopers.
As it was two days’ journey to the nearest town where they could
place their prisoner safely under lock and key, they made a halt for the
night, built a camp fire, as is the custom in Australia, and the two constables
slept one on each side of their prisoner. Judge then of their surprise at
finding on their awakening in the morning that their bird had flown!
During the night Melville had crawled stealthily, on his hands and knees,
to the camp fire, and holding the ropes that bound his wrists across the
smouldering embers, the flax soon parted, and his hands were then free to
unshackle his limbs.
The daring man stood free in the middle of the sleeping camp; but not
content, he robbed the troopers of their very rifles, and galloping away on
their swiftest horse, was once more in his home in the mountains.
It was, strange to relate, at a wedding party at Geelong, Victoria, that
Melville, the bushranger, was ultimately arrested. In the excitement of
the evening’s festivities, and under the influence of the wine-cup, he
incautiously boasted of his powers in baffling the police, and so was

in hot pursuit. The outlaw at once spurred on his horse, and on their
gaining the level country the troopers’ inferior steeds “baulked” at the
country fences, and only two were able to follow the bushranger in his
flight. Melville’s fine black mare was gradually out-distancing his pur-
suers when, on looking backward to see what progress the police were
making, he was suddenly thrown to the ground through coming in contact
with the low branch of a eucalyptus tree, and his horse galloped away.
He was rendered insensible by the fall, and on recovering consciousness
he found that he had been secured, and was bound hand and foot with
the new rope halters used by the troopers.
As it was two days’ journey to the nearest town where they could
place their prisoner safely under lock and key, they made a halt for the
night, built a camp fire, as is the custom in Australia, and the two constables
slept one on each side of their prisoner. Judge then of their surprise at
finding on their awakening in the morning that their bird had flown!
During the night Melville had crawled stealthily, on his hands and knees,
to the camp fire, and holding the ropes that bound his wrists across the
smouldering embers, the flax soon parted, and his hands were then free to
unshackle his limbs.
The daring man stood free in the middle of the sleeping camp; but not
content, he robbed the troopers of their very rifles, and galloping away on
their swiftest horse, was once more in his home in the mountains.
It was, strange to relate, at a wedding party at Geelong, Victoria, that
Melville, the bushranger, was ultimately arrested. In the excitement of
the evening’s festivities, and under the influence of the wine-cup, he
incautiously boasted of his powers in baffling the police, and so was

Melville was converted to religion; his demeanour was that of abiect
contrition and he prayed that he might yet be made the means of
assisting the conversion of his fellow-prisoners. At his request he was
provided by the Chaplain with books for his moral instruction, and he
actually made a commencement on a translation of the Bible into the
tongue of the Australian aborigines, with whose language he was
remarkably conversant, having lived for years among the blacks.
The Chaplain was so highly gratified at having made such a remark-
able convert that the rigorous punishment was relaxed, and Melville
gamed the privilege of working at the quarries. About five o’clock in the
afternoon of the 22nd of October, 1856, forty or fifty prisoners were
mustered at the little stone pier for the return to the “Success ’’ and
theu entered the launch provided for their accommodation, Melville
being amongst them. The convicts were noticed by Mr. Jackson, the
ship keeper of the hulk Lysander, to be crowding towards the bow of
the boat, and he ordered foiir or five of them aft, to bring the boat into
proper trim. With the towing boat (manned by four or five sailors from
the Lysander, and Owen Owens as guard) about four yards distant the
barge moved from the landing place. When two hundred yards ’from
the shore, the pious Melville gave a signal,* the convicts seized the tow-
line, and hauling it up, scrambled into the smaller boat and threw
themselves upon the occupants. w

The Melville “rush.”— The murder of two warders, Owen Owens and John Turner




inevitable, a convict named Stevens, remembering the tortures to which
he had been subjected on board, shouted, “I prefer this,” and, ironed
as he was, jumped overboard and instantly sank.
The affair had thus caused the death of Owen Owens, the warder;
John Turner, one of the seamen, who was drowned, and Stevens, the
convict. The murderers, on being challenged, surrendered, and were
ignominiously taken back to the hulk, manacled and thrust into their
cells. The convicts implicated were all long-sentence prisoners: Melville,
32 years; Power, 14 years; Murphy, 12 years; Johnstone, 13 years;
Harris, 12 years; Fielder, 15 years; Macdonald, 9 years; and O’Ready,
22 years. Melville, as he was being more heavily ironed, mocked the
officials, and in dumb show, pointing to his neck, intimated that he
expected to be hanged for that day’s exploit.
On the 19th of November, 1856. the trial of the nine convicts com-
menced at the Melbourne Criminal Sessions. They were all charged
with the murder of Owen Owens, and were separately arraigned, having
exercised their individual right to challenge the panel. Melville was tried
first, and defended himself.
Melville addressed the jury, and called God to witness that he had not
struck the blows. He said he had been most cruelly treated on board the
hulks, and that efforts had been made to provoke an outbreak, so that
the men might be shot. On first going on board the hulk he had, he
said, been cruelly beaten by thirteen men, and thrown in a small dungeon
two feet six inches wide, and there he lay in irons for five days and six
nights, his food being placed within his sight, but out of his reach. When
attempting to escape after Hill was wounded he was tending him as he
lay in the bottom of the boat, when Stevens struck Owens twice and
said, “I’ve done it now,” and, “I prefer this,” and he then jumped
overboard. Some others proposed to commit suicide in the same way,
to escape capture, but he dissuaded them. When he finished what was
described by the press as “a ver}' telling address,” he called the eight
other prisoners, who all swore that it was Stevens who had struck Owens;
that O’Ready had endeavoured to prevent him; and that at the time
Melville was tending the wounded man Hill.
For the Crown, it was urged that the prisoners had concocted the
story, throwing the guilt upon the dead Stevens, and that the evidence of
convicts should not weigh against the testimony of the Crown witnesses.
The jury, after deliberating for three-quarters of an hour, found Melville
guilty, but were not unanimous as to his being the one who struck the
blows. Melville was sentenced to be hanged, but as he had been originally
sentenced to labour on the roads, and as no warrant had been produced
for his transfer to the prison hulks , the point was raised as to whether the
nrisoner was in “legal custody” when attempting escape. In the
following month the full Court upheld the objection and the conviction
was finally quashed.
Melville’s trial was followed by that of Harris and Fielder, who were
defended by Dr. Mackay. They were found guilty, but were strongly
recommended to mercy by the jury, on the ground that they had not struck
the blows which caused the death of Owens. The remaining six accused
were arraigned during the following week and tried together. They were
defended by R. D. Ireland, with the result that the jury brought in a
verdict of “ not guilty.” This verdict was, no doubt, partly due to the
impression that had been made upon the public mind by the disclosures
in the previous trials and by the letters which had appeared in the press,
showing that the convicts were at times goaded to desperation.
The following anecdote of this notorious villain shows also the deep
plans he laid for escaping from the dull monotony and cruelty of the life


ov. board. On a certain occasion he had expressed a wish to have an
interview with a Catholic priest. The request, having been duly con-
sidered, was very properly acceded to. but, as the result showed no
religious motive had prompted this hardened sinner. The clergyman
was sent for, and every facility was given for the purpose of his visit but
scarcely was he left alone with “ Captain Melville,” than to his infinite
surprise he was ordered by him to strip off his garments, and change with
the prisoner. The Church, however, proved militant; the reverend
gentleman showed a bold front, threatened instant exposure, and to give
an alarm if the least attempt at violence were made.
The baffled ruffian therefore had to put up with further disappointment.
He subsequent!}' found means, however, to communicate again with his
visitor, and had the extraordinary coolness to ask him to come a second
time and to bring with him an extra priestly costume. Needless to say
this modest request met with no response.
Melville did not long survive the commutation of his sentence One
morning he was found in his cell strangled to death by his neckerchief.
Ihe opinion was held by some at the time that he was strangled by the
officers of the “Success,” who knew that he was possessed of a secret
the publication of which would have involved the expulsion of one or
more prominent officials. The verdict of “Suicide” was declared bv
those who held this opinion to be merely a screen for the murderers of
this unhappy wretch. How far the suspicion of foul play was instilled it
is at this distance of time, impossible to say. Certain it is that in the
absence of direct incriminating evidence, nothing would be more’reason-

HENRY GARRETT.
Henry Garrett, the subject of this chapter, played many roles, and
donned many disguises. He was tall and finely built, remarkably hand-
some, and most affable in manner. He looked his best in his accustomed
broadcloth, and even went so far as to affect spectacles, in order to add
to his sedate appearance. His partiality was very marked for the rich
and religious among the influential circle in which he moved. He spoke
frequently at the meetings of the New Zealand Young Men’s Christian
Association, but subsequent events plainly proved that he was a wolf in
sheep’s clothing, for he used to preach industriously by day and rob still
more industriously by night. To him Shakespeare’s words most aptly
apply;
“ With this I clothe my naked villainy
With odd ends stolen out of Holy Writ,
And seem a saint when most I play the devil.”
Garrett succeeded in ingratiating himself Into the most select society
in Dunedin, but on being found by a policeman one morning in a store,
fully equipped with burglars’ tools, such as a dark lantern, silent matches’
etc., matters assumed a very different aspect. This startling discovery
was soon noised about, and the society that had lionised him now gave
him the cold shoulder.
For this burglary Garrett was sentenced to five years. Records
proved that this was not his first step on the downward path, as it was
ascertained that at the age of fifteen he had acted as “useful boy” to a
gang of skilled cracksmen in London. In the year 1855 he “stuck up”
the Bank at Ballarat, in broad daylight, to the tune of He first
terrorised the teller by presenting a six-chambered revolver at his head,
and locked him in the strong room. Then, with the greatest unconcern,
he pinned a notice in bold letters on the door of the Bank as follows :
“Bank Closed for Haee-an-Hour.”
By Order.
Customers came and went, expressing no suspicion, while the daring
robber inside systematically looted the safes and left by the side door.
He got safely to Melbourne, and shipped on board a mail boat bound for
London. The detectives followed him by the next steamer, and one
morning, when proceeding through the Strand, they thought they saw their
“ suspect ” a little ahead of them. One constable, more astute than the rest,
hurried on until he got within a hundred yards of the suspected man, and
then gave a low “coo-ee.”* Garrett, for it was he, turned sharply round
upon hearing this familiar call, and being recognised, was promptly
arrested. Upon his return he was sentenced to ten years’ imprisonment
on board the hulk “Success,” and a few years later, for his good
behaviour, he was granted a ticket of leave for New Zealand. There he
returned to his life of crime and robbery under arms. Dressed in a red
check shirt, wide-brimmed sombrero hat, and top boots, with a brace of
revolvers ornamenting his belt, he looked the ideal bushranger. For
years he roamed the country, accompanied by a female confederate, and
succeeded in “ bailing up ” no less than twenty-five persons in one day!
J\t Dunedin he served a term of imprisonment, and avowed his
intention of taking his revenge upon Mr. John Pender, the chief magistrate,
* A commonly used in Australia, and originally adopted from the blacks,
who __ coo-ee across from hill to hill, aud the echo, resounding through the

by poisoning him. Being suspected, he was traced, and caught red-handed
in an attempt to poison the entire population of Dunedin by placing a
quantity of strychnine in the public reservoir. For this diabolical act he
served four years’ imprisonment.
Finally, as head of a gang of horse-stealers and bushrangers, he
received the severe sentence of twenty-two years. Whilst working in
different gaols throughout the country he became an expert cooper.
Mr. Caldwell, the Governor of the gaol at Dunedin, who was at one
time a warder on the prison-hulk “Success,” stated that Garrett
invariably had a “C ” placed opposite his name, denoting good conduct
in gaol.
Garrett wrote and published an “Essay on Crime,” a subject with
which his long and varied criminal career eminently entitled him to deal.
The pamphlet showed good reasoning powers, and considerable literary
ability. And as a prisoner he had acquired a considerable aptitude in
the practice of shorthand writing. The instruction books of the system
had been procured for him at his request by a friendly warder in New
Zealand.
Garrett, the versatile rogue, might well be quoted as an illustration of
the saying, “Once a criminal, always a criminal.” As years went on he
drifted farther and farther into crime, and “ did time ” in most of the gaols
in the Colony. At last, as a white-haired, decrepit old man, when infirm
through age and the severity of prison life, he met with a street accident
at Dunedin. He was carried in a dying state to a hospital, where, in the
very face of death, he boasted of having spent no less than fifty-two
Christmas Days in gaol, a statement which was proved by the records to
be perfectly true. Garrett passed away at the ripe age of seventy-one
years. He was well favoured in many respects, but instead of using his
gifts in a manner to win for him the admiration of his fellow-men, he
followed the crooked path of crime, that must inevitably end in shame
and obloquy.
GIPSY SMITH.
This old inmate of the “Success” was nicknamed Gipsy on account
of the swarthy complexion which is so a characteristic of those
picturesque people who used to roam through England in caravans. The
place and date of his birth, and all particulars of the early part of his
career are wrapt in obscurity. He became intensely excited by the
revolutionary utterances of the Chartist leaders delivered at a meeting
held on Kenniugton Common. Several of the crowd were so carried
away by the inflammatory appeals of one of the speakers that they rushed
off in the direction of Southampton Street, Camberwell, and looted a large
pawnbroker’s shop. Gipsy Smith was one of that excited mob, and was
most probably one of its ringleaders. He literally loaded himself with as
many watches and other portable valuables as he could conveniently
carry. Upon being pursued Smith plunged into the Grand Surrey Canal,
which runs close by.
By “treading water,” he was smoothly gaining the opposite bank. But
the wary constables had anticipated the thief’s manoeuvre, and, quickly
crossing, left several of their number on the other side of the canal, so
that Gipsy Smith was “between the devil and the deep sea.” Perceiving
escape to be impossible he surrendered, and for this, his first known
robbery, he was sentenced to twelve years’ transportation in Van Diemau’s


Land. He escaped from prison by some means, but he was quickly
recaptured and sent to Norfolk Island. Here, in the year 1854, he again
eluded the viligance of his captors, and made his way to Victoria, where he
resorted to bushranging, but he was recaptured at Ballarat.
A curious instance of the practice of wearing charms, often affected by
the gipsy element, was shown to have existed in his case. His faith
rested upon a simple battered coin, which he prized with a superstitious
regard., A visitor to the “Success” made an iuterestiug entry in the
Visitors’ Book bearing upon this matter, as follows:
“ John A. Lewis , late Inspector of Police. lam nozv in
“ possession of Gipsy Smith's crooked sixpence, ivhich I took from
“ him when he was arrested. He said at that time he did not
“ expect further luck as it had been his talisman .”
Gipsy was handed over to a mounted trooper, who was to escort him
to Melbourne. He was already handcuffed, and the precaution had
been taken of tying his feet beueath the horse’s stomach. They arrived
at a small roadside hostelry, and Smith, who was exceedingly affable,
earnestly begged the trooper to allow him to have a driuk. His
custodian at first refused, but at length consented. He unfastened the
ropes that bound Smith’s legs, and even helped him to dismount,
when Smith had the further audacity to plead for the removal of
his handcuffs, that he might raise the liquor to his lips. Smith
pleaded so long and earnestly that in the end the officer foolishly
complied with this second request.
In an instant Smith had seized the trooper’s sword, and had drawn it
from its scabbard. He then commenced a murderous onslaught upon
the unfortunate officer, who pluckily defended himself with the empty
steel scabbard. He parried the furious luuges of his antagonist with
admirable dexterity, and after a protracted and desperate hand-to-hand
encounter, Smith was finally overmatched, and throwing down the
trooper’s sword, took to his heels. The officer returned minus his
prisoner, and was severely punished for freeing Smith from the hand-
cuffs and leg-ropes.
No news of Smith’s whereabouts reached the police for about two
months, when an important clue came to hand and was promptly acted
upon. A cordon of men was drawn round a tent in which Smith and a
newly-found companion were rumoured to be sleeping. A constable
named Moore boldly entered the tent to effect the recapture of Gipsy,
but the latter and his mate were on the alert, and poured a deadly fire
into the ranks of the police by which Constable McNalty was killed on
the spot, while Moore was severely wounded in the arm.
The police having been taken aback by the suddenness of the volley,
allowed the two bushrangers to again make their escape. Smith
and his mate, it was found,* travelled all night, and made their way
to the “ diggings ” near Daisy Hill. A digger who was acquainted with
them saw Gipsy’s mate go into a store to obtain provisions. When he
reappeared the digger acted the spy and followed the outlaw to a hut,
situated on the outskirts of the diggings. He then gave this welcome
information to the police, who immediately took steps to ensure this
time the success of their raid. They surrounded the hut, and two of
their number cautiously creeping closely and peering through oue of the
chinks, saw a man asleep, with saddle and firearms close at hand. He
had evidently made all needful arrangements for bolting quickly, if
necessary. His mate was softly moving about the hut. Several
police were stationed round the hut with the muzzles of their rifles


through the chinks. At a given signal from their chief they made a

Gipsy Smith was tried for robbery with violence and attempted
murder, and received a sentence of sixteen years on board the “Success.”
During the course of his trial, Smith confessed that the severest thrashing

While undergoing his sentence on the “Success,” Smith earned the
unenviable reputation of being the sneak and spy of Inspector Price
was a!ways ready to do any of the more offensive duties on board, in
recognition of which he was allowed certain privileges. Under the
influence of Mr. Champ (the Inspector-General who succeeded Mr. Price)

was then employed by Mr. Dang (son of the Rev. Dr. Dang, of Sydney)

For this crime he was tried and sentenced to death. The night
preceding the day fixed for his execution he attempted to destroy himself
with a piece of jagged razor that he had concealed in his boot As
Smith was lying and pretending to be asleep, with his head wrapped in
a rug, the warder at his side suddenly felt the prisoner’s arm fall heavily
upon him. He immediately raised an alarm, and Smith’s determined
effort to evade the carrying out of the sentence was thwarted. The
execution of this callous criminal duly took place on the 22nd of April
TSfiT ; the colony being thus r;d of one of the most cruel and treacherous
villains that ever figured in the annals of Australian crime.
HENRY POWER.
• Po wer >’ alias ‘Johnston,’ was arrested this morning-, at 7-30 a.m.
the Kln £ Ranges, on the Glenmore run, by Superintendents
Nicholson and Hare, and is now lodged in the Wangaratta Watchhouse.
“(Signed) C. H. Nicholson,”
Thus ran the telegram notifying to the Victorian public the fact that
Power, the Pentndge absconder, was at last made a prisoner. As an
armed bushranger he had held the country-side in terror for many years •
the good traits he occasionally displayed to some extent redeeming his
character, being like glints of sunshine in his otherwise dark and mis-
spent life. Women were always treated by Power with the greatest
respect. Upon one occasion, when he was “ * bailing-up ’ a mail coach,”
full of passengers, a young lady who was greatly terrified at the sight of
firearms, was handing Power her gold watch and trinkets, with expres-
sions of great grief, as the trinkets were a keepsake from her dead
m ° t]lier - politely touched his broad-brimmed hat and at once
returned the trinkets to their owner, with the courteous wish that she
would live long to wear them. This incident was truly characteristic
oi the man in his dealings with the gentler sex. f
On another occasion a Scotchman named Hartley, on being “bailed up”
on the road near Seymour, absolutely refused, though at the point of
the rifle, to part with his money. It was a boast with Power that,
despite his lawless life, he had never shed blood; although, as he


afterwards remarked he feared this time, that some might think that
he was afraid to shoot a man. Without arguing the point, Power stepped
aside with the remark: “I’ll give you just five minutes to think over the
matter, and if, after that time, you still refuse I shall have to shoot you.”
Power then knelt down behind a tree, and fervently prayed to
God to soften the heart of the obdurate Scot, so that the shedding
of blood might be avoided. At the end of the allotted time Power
again demanded the money, which, to his relief, was then handed over
without a murmur. The story is endorsed by some engaged on board the
“ Success ” at the present time, who heard it from the bushranger’s
own lips.
Power was transported originally for poaching, and injuring the
squire’s keeper in the scuffle which ensued. As an early convict he
escaped from Van Dieman’s Land in 1848, and for horse-stealing and
shooting with intent, was sentenced to fourteen years’ imprisonment upon
the hulk “Success.” He was one of the gang who seized the boat when
the two warders were murdered at the “Melville Rush.” Having, on his
release, adopted his old mode of life, he was again arrested, after a great
deal of difficulty, at Beechworth, and lodged in the Peutridge Stockade
on an eight years’ sentence.
In 1869, he escaped through a bold trick which may be worth recording.
For his good behaviour he had been allowed to join a gang of prisoners
and assist in hauling a go-cart filled with rubbish, from the inside of the
gaol to some heaps in the surrounding grounds. As one of the loads
which he had helped to draw was being emptied, Power, unperceived by
the sentries, slid under the falling rubbish, and became part of the heap.
The other prisoners drew the cart back, leaving Power concealed
beneath the rubbish, and moved off for another load, the sentries being
ignorant of the fact that Power was missing from the team. The
convict anxiously listened till they had entered the gaol; then
shaking himself free from the rubbish and making sure that the
coast was clear, he made off as fast as he could into the brushwood.
Upon gaining the open country, Power’s convict garb, branded with broad
arrows, greatly terrified a country dame who was turning a churn, and her
fears were not allayed by Power’s imperative demand for an immediate
change of clothes. Some weapon of defence was needed as well as
clothes, so, as a temporary expedient, he fixed the blade of a pair of old
shears into a cleft stick, and, armed with this rudely-made lance, he
startled an elderly prospector with the call to “bail up.” He soon
relieved his victim of his revolver and his money, and then allowed him
to pursue his journey in peace.
Power was the tutor of young Ned Kelly, who afterwards played such
a prominent part in Australasian outlawry. Indeed, at Mount" Battery
Station, Kelly was very nearly arrested in Power’s company. They were
sighted by the police, and several shots were exchanged. Kelly wanted
to surrender, but Power scouted the idea, and the pair galloped away
together, Power’s steed receiving an ugly flesh wound during the melee.
On another occasion Power was caught by the owner (Dr, Rowe) as
he was in the act of skinning one of his lambs.
“ Who are you ? ” the doctor demanded, “ and what the devil do you
mean by killing my lamb ? ”
“I’ll soon let you know I am,” “get off those horses!”
roared the bushranger, assuming an upright position and presenting his
revolver.
“Oh!” exclaimed Dr. Rowe, rather crestfallen, “I suppose you are
Power. I should advise you to give up this mode of life.” Power


promptly replied, “ I want you to give me a cheque on the bank at
Mansfield for You can send your man for it.” And it was done.
Power then mounted the Doctor’s superb horse and rode off. He
covered a distance of seventy miles the following day, his swift flight
effectually baffling the police.
At last the officers received information which made them sanguine of
tracing the escaped convict to his lair. A man, whose name was never
disclosed, but who was referred to in official correspondence as L, ,
volunteered to betray Power’s secret hiding-place. It seems that the
outlaw had robbed a squatter of a valuable gold presentation watch,
richly chased. Power sent a message to his victim to the effect that he
could have the watch back on condition that he forwarded the sum of
.£l5. The police, with the assistance of their informant, who was himself
an old convict, proceeded to a lonely and mountainous part of the country,
armed to the teeth, accompanied by a party of black trackers.
After undergoing great privations and a wearisome search, they
succeeded in running Power to earth in a gunyah, in a lonely part, of the
ranges at the heae of the King River, Victoria. He was captured after a
desperate struggle.
As he was taken to prison in a cart, he assumed a deal of bravado,
and held his handcuffed hands aloft to attract attention. He told the
judge in open court that if he did not “ draw it mild,” he would return the
compliment if they ever met in the “bush.” At the Beechworth Assizes
he received a sentence of fifteen years’ imprisonment.
Some years afterwards, influential ladies in Melbourne, notably
Lady Clarke, remembering Power’s chivalry to women, petitioned the
authorities to reprieve the aged prisoner. They were finally successful,
and Sir W. J. Clarke offered him a home on one of his country stations.
Power kept the situation for several years, but becoming restless, he
visited Sandridge, near Melbourne, where the old “ Success ” was at
that time creating a sensation as an exhibition. He told his story
to the management, and pointed out the very cell in which he had been
incarcerated for so many years; the result being that he was offered
the position of attendant on board. Power occupied a comfortable
cabin just under the poop, where “he fought all his battles o’er
again,” much to the interest of visitors to the historic ship. He was
engaged to come to Loudon, but the prison life on board the “ Success ”
to which he had been subjected, had ruined his health (his life had been
one of intense hardship, both as a free man and as a prisoner), and in a
fit of despondency he wandered iuto the rural parts of Victoria, and
committed suicide in the Murray River, near Swan Hill, on November
7th, 1891 —a sad end to a chequered career, which had not been without
its promise of better things.
DANIEL MORGAN,
Bushranger, Incendiary and Murderer.
The visitor to the “ Success ” can hardly fail to be struck by the
villainous face of the red-shirted figure standing on the left of “ Captain
Moonlight.” His black, shaggy hair, bushy eyebrows, and fierce, relentless
eyes mark Daniel Morgan as no ordinary criminal.
One recoils instinctively from this heartless, cold-blooded villain who
put so small a value on human life. Morgan’s real name was Fuller. He
was born at Campbelltown in the year 1830, being the illegitimate offspring
of a man named Fuller and a woman named Owens. His father was a


costermonger or hawker, and afterwards for many years was a barrow-man
in the Haymarket, Sydney. His mother was a well-known character, who
was called by her associates “The Gipsy.” Tike most children born
under such circumstances, j'oung Fuller received, as the saying goes,
“ more kicks than ha’pence.” An old man who was known by the nick-
name of “Jack the Welshman,” seeing the treatment to which the child
was subjected, decided to adopt him, and young Morgan remained under
his benefactor’s roof until he was 17 years of age. He then migrated to
the Murrumbidgee, and was employed as a stockman until 1854. One
day he announced his intention of proceeding to Bathurst to see his
mother, who, he had discovered, was living in that locality. Two horses,
however, also disappeared from the homestead. Accounts now came to
hand of daring robberies, accompanied by the most brutal violence,
which were very soon proved to be the work of this notorious convict.
Unfortunate wayfarers were fastened by him to convenient trees, in
which helpless position he would taunt them by holding his loaded
revolver close to their fear-stricken faces; after which he would leave
them to perish of exposure and starvation.
The districts over which Morgan exercised such terrorism were Albury,
Gundagai, Wagga-Wagga, and Narandera. Morgan “stuck up” a
Mr. Gibson at his residence near Piney Ridge, and by menaces
obtained a cheque to the value of He next visited the Messrs.
Stitt Brothers’ station at Wolla-Wolla, and, having ascertained from the
servants the manner in which their masters treated them, he ordered
rum to be brought for the whole company. _
He next directed his attentions to a station at Mittagoug, owned by a
gentleman named Vincent, who, it appears, had given the police infor-
mation as to the whereabouts of Morgan.
Morgan quickly set at rest all doubt as to his still being in the vicinity
A few days later he called upon Mr. Vincent, and making him a prisoner,
ordered some of his employes to bind him to a fence. This order,
although obeyed, was not executed to Morgan’s satisfaction ; he commanded
the men to draw the strands that bound Mr. Vincent “much tighter.”
The straps were drawn so tight that it almost stopped the circulation of
the blood; and Morgan, standing before the hapless settler, mockingly
said, “You are the man who gave the police information of my where-
abouts. They have not taken me, you see, so it is my turn now; I will
give you five minutes to live, and allow you the privilege of communicating
any last wish or desire to your wife and family.” Upon the arrival of Mrs.
Vincent and her daughters they took in the situation at a glance. They
screamed and almost fainted with fear, and implored Morgan to spare the
life of his victim. Their supplications and prayers seemed to influence
the outlaw in favour of sparing Mr. Vincent’s life, and he then offered the
latter his choice, either to be shot, or to have his woolshed and contents
burnt. Mr, Vincent urged that he did not want to be shot, but he also
did not wish the woolshed to be<burned, as several brothers and sisters
had equal shares in it with him. To these entreaties, Morgan turned a
deaf ear, and promptly ordered a firestick to be applied to the hayricks
and woolshed. Upon this huge bonfire he bade the shearers to heap a
new dogcart and harness, together with all the provisions and account
books of the business transacted at the station.
Fiendishly gloating over his cruel work, Morgan then went his
leaving the unfortunate Mr. Vincent almost roasted alive and suffocated
with smoke.
His subsequent deeds showed that robbery was not always the object
he had in view. In Albany, at a station called Round Hill, Morgan paid a


visit which, was accompanied by some sensational incidents. Four
persons connected with the station were seated in a room conversing at
the time of Morgan’s visit. They were Mr. Watson, the Superintendent,
Mr. McNiel, the Overseer, Mr. McLean, the Cattle Overseer, and
Mr. Heriot, the son of a neighbouring farmer. Morgan quietly rode up
unobserved, and, dismounting leisurely, had the audacity to peer in
through the doorway of the bedroom in which Mrs. Watson was putting
the finishing touches to her toilet. The lady, as if by premonition,
turned round and met Morgan’s gaze. He proceeded to the room in
which Mr. Watson and his three friends were seated, and presented his
two revolvers at the party. He ordered one of the servants to bring him
some spirits. Mr. Watson poured out a glassfull, and offered it to Morgan,
who, under the impression that it had been drugged, compelled his host
to drink it himself. He next ordered his dinner to be served, and told a
man-servant to take his horse to the stables and feed and groom him.
After his meal was finished he mustered the station hands, and gave word
for all the available spirits to be brought for them to drink, adding, as a
reason for his own abstention, that he had been drinking excessively for
the past week. This statement was no doubt true, for his subsequent
behaviour could only be likened to that of a maniac. Ordering his horse
to be brought from the stable, the bushranger mounted, but in doing
so, accidentally discharged one of his own revolvers. In his excited
condition he imagined the shot was fired by one of the'prisouers, and fired
his revolvers indiscriminately right and left over the heads of the panic-
stricken party. Young Mr. Heriot had his leg shattered by one of the
shots, and a bullet went clean through the right hand of Mr. Watson, who
had raised it in protest. Morgan galloped round and round in a frantic
state of excitement, and on perceiving poor young Heriot lying helpless
on the ground, dismounted and pressed the muzzle of his still smoking
revolver close to the lad’s temple. He was about to fire when the
wounded boy made an imploring appeal for his life to be spared.
Morgan was moved by the lad’s entreaties, and even went so far as to
consent to Mr. McLean going for a doctor. McLean had not proceeded
more than two miles in the direction of Wolla-Wolla, when Morgan,
fearing that McLean’s real object was to inform the police, hastily
remounted his horse, overtook McLean and deliberately shot him through
the back.
A magisterial enquiry was held as to the cause of McLean’s death,
the result being that a verdict of ‘‘Wilful murder” was returned against
Morgan.
Meanwhile Morgan was still committing the most atrocious outrages,
the news of his violence and bloodthirstiness causing -widespread terror
through the whole country-side. The police used their most strenuous
efforts to capture him, but without avail, and the Government eventually
offered the substantial sum of as an incentive for the outlaw’s
friends to betray him.
A woman, whom the outlaw had found unprotected, was cruelly
tortured by being held over a smouldering fire, to compel her to tell the
whereabouts of some valuables, of which she protested she knew nothin".
The poor woman a few days later died of her injuries together with the
shock to her system.
On another occasion, riding round a spur of the ranges, Morgan
deliberately took aim at a man ploughing in a field below, and shot him
dead—“ Just to try a new rifle,” as he afterwards coolly explained.
From time to time the police had sighted him, but the horses of the
police always failed them at the critical moment. Raid after raid was


successfully made by the daring outlaw, who planted his spoil in his secret
lair among the ranges. Apropos of this, w r e may mention that a few years
ago a lad, who was exploring in the mountains, came across a cave,
screened behind luxuriant undergrowth. Inside, to his astonishment, he
discovered a wide-mouthed bottle, stuffed full with pulpy and mouldy
five-pound notes and tarnished gold, the proceeds, as it was supposed, of
one of Morgan’s plundering expeditions.
But perhaps the most frightful instance of this incarnate devil’s cruelty
has yet to be recorded. At Edgehill Run he “tentpegged” a woman
who had refused him rations, fixing her directly across a soldier-ant bed,
such as are often to be seen in Australia. Her emaciated body was found
days afterwards with the spark of life just lingering, but, alas! all reason
had fled. The torturous stings of the great red ants must have caused
her excruciating agony.
At last two sergeants of police, named McGinnity and Smyth,
succeeded in tracing the outlaw to a town named Tumberumba. After a
long and hard chase they rode him down, and McGinnity, together with
Constable Churchley, exchanged shots with Morgan at short range. In
the midst of this unique conflict, the horses of the sergeant and the bush-
ranger were shot dead simultaneously. The sergeant rushed forward and
tried to grapple with the fugitive, shouting, “ Now it’s you or I for it.” A
desperate struggle ensued, both being muscular, powerful men. Every
nerve was strained by each in the endeavour to gain the upper hand. As
they strove, a loaded revolver in Morgan’s belt accidentally went off, and
the plucky sergeant fell dead to the ground, having been shot through the
spine. The other sergeant, Thomas Smyth, now came upon the scene,
and Morgan turning upon him with flashing eyes sent a bullet through his
body. Thus two more tragedies were added to the already long list for
which this miscreant was responsible.
Robberies with violence followed in such rapid succession that a few
summarised examples culled from the newspapers of the time must suffice.
The outlaw “bailed up” fifteen road repairers at Kyamba, and set fire to
their tents. Five Chinamen were ordered to strip, and one was shot,
dying in frightful agony. Morgan threw a sovereign and some loose silver
into the river, being thoroughly disgusted at not having gained a larger
amount. Three miles from there two buggies were stopped and the
occupants robbed.
But the day of reckoning was drawing near. In consequence of the
many cold-blooded outrages that were committed, the vigilance of the
police was redoubled, and Morgan, finding that the district was getting
too hot for him, sought safety across the border in Victoria. There he
quickly resumed business by “bailing up” McKinnon’s station, situated
at Tittle River. He also subjected numerous carriers to “searching”
ordeals, and obtained sums varying from £$ to £S°- ft seems that not
one of these had the pluck to resist the outlaw’s audacious demands.
Morgan then passed on to the Peechalba Station, where he “bailed
up ” all the occupants, eight women and four men. A nursemaid, named
Alice Macdonald, made the excuse that the baby was crying, and so
managed to leave the room. On Morgan roughly intercepting her, she
pluckily smacked his face, which action so completely took the outlaw by
surprise that he allowed her to pass. The girl then quietly informed one
of the station hands who had been overlooked in the mustering. Morgan,
happening to hverhear her talking, said angrily, “ Who were you speaking
to ? ” She replied that she was merely calling “ Rufus,” the dog.
Morgan then prepared to enjoy his evening. A substantial meal, to
which the shearers were also invited to sit down, was served in style in


the large room. Morgan sank into an armchair in a position whicn
enabled him to keep his prisoners well in view. He drowsily remarked
that “he always slept with one eye open.” Towards morning he
intimated his intention of taking Mr. McPherson’s fastest horse, “Joan of
Arc,” which had gained a great reputation at the country races.
Rut the 9th of April, 1865, was destined to be a fateful day in his career.
He was walking to the stable to procure the horse he had mentioned
during the night, when a rustle in the adjacent thicket reached his quick
ear. With an impatient frown he suddenly turned, and saw faces peering
at him from all sides. Taking in the situation at a glance, he uttered
a wild shout, and made a dash for shelter. It was, indeed, a race for
life. John Quinlan, a station hand, stepped from behind a tree, took a
sure aim at the retreating figure, and fired. Morgan fell. The bullet
had struck him at the back of the shoulder, and had passed out through
his neck. As he lay dying he said reproachfully, “Why didn’t you
challenge me fair, and give me a chance? ” He lingered in great agony
for some hours, and then, in a fit of choking, sank back and expired.
The ;£x,ooo reward offered by the Government of New South Wales
was paid as follows£3oo to John Quinlan, who fired the fatal shot;
£ 2 s° to Alice Macdonald, the plucky nursemaid ; to James Frazer,
who rode to Wangaratta for assistance; and the remaining was
proportionately divided among the several others who had contributed to
bring about Morgan’s downfall.
Of him it may be said that he was the most utterly heartless,
diabolical demon that ever figured in bushranging annals. He exhibited
a fiendish brutality towards his victims that was happily unique. It
would be difficult to find in this coarse and bestial ruffian a single
redeeming point.
OWEN SUFFOLK,
The Prison-Poet of Australia.
Owen Henry Suffolk, the son of a Loudon merchant, was a junior post-
office clerk, who, in a moment of temptation, opened a money-letter. His
character till then had been exemplary, still there was no First Offenders’
Act then, so he was sentenced to be transported for seven years. He
proved to possess conspicuous ability. His life was a constant struggle
between his worse and better nature. In odd moments he wrote poetry. & A
verse from “The Dream of Freedom,” written in the old Melbourne gaol,
will serve as an example :
In the captive’s dream of fancy wild,
He looked no more on the man of care ;
His gaze was fixed on a beauteous child
Who knelt at his mother’s feet in prayer.
Its little hands were clasped—its eyes
Uplifted were to Paradise;
Its simple words of faith and love
Were registered in heaven above ;
Recorded there with angels’ tears
As they wept o’er the hopes the mother built,
For they looked through the vista of coming years,
And saw it fettered to future guilt.


Vet he robbed the Ballarat and Bendigo mail coaches, stole horses, and,
being arrested, escaped again from gaol and became a notorious bush-
ranger. The following lines were written whilst in the company and under
the influence of highwaymen, association with whom only hastened his
downward career. He always expressed regret that they had ever appeared
in print.
It is not in a prison drear.
Where all around -s gloom,
That I would end life’s wild career,
And sink into the tomb.
For though my spirit’s ever bold
Each tyrant to defy,
Still, still, within a dungeon cold
I could not calmly die.
It is not that my cheek would pale
Within a lonely cell;
It is not that my heart would quail
To bid this world farewell ;
For if oppressed by tyrant foe
I’d freely be the first
To give my life and strike the blow
To lay him in the dust.
But place me in a forest glen
Unfettered, wild and free,
With fifty tried and chosen men,
A bandit chief to be ;
'Tis there when fighting with my foes
Amid my trusty band,
I’d freely leave this world of woes,
And die with sword in hand.
Yet Suffolk would be melted to tears at any recollection of his early life
and home. By chance he saw in the “Missing Friends” column of the
Ace an appealing advertisement from his heart-broken mother in Fmglaud
imploring him to make his whereabouts known. He never answered the
advertisement, but the following lines (discovered in his camp) will show
his true feelings towards her
Mother! darling mother, you are seeking me, I know,
And I feel thy love will follow through the world where’er I go;
But I cannot come, dear mother ; 1 am sadly altered now .
The once fair wreath of innocence that garlanded my brow
Has faded ne’er to bloom*'again ; and from the things of yore—
The fair, the good, the beautiful—l’m severed evermore.
My onward way must be a path of darkness and of pain,
But I must tread it all alone —I cannot come again.
Of all the changes that have come, I know that this will be,
Where all the changes have been sad, the saddest change to thee.
I know how much thou’lt weep, mother, for thy dear boy so lost,
And ’tis the sorrow thou must feel that makes me sorrow most.
I strove against this darker fate, I struggled, mother, long,
I starved and suffered months, mother, ere I was linked to wrong ;
And even now good angels plead to win me—but in vain 1
Once fallen is for ever lost—l cannot come again.


I’m severed from thee by my sin, but cannot say “forget,”
Thy love is such a hallowed thing, I ask it even yet;
But let it be a memory that images all fair
The child that with uplifted hands in faith knelt by thy chair.
Ihink of me, mother, as I was, when joy lit up my brow
And my young heart was innocent, but not as I am now
Pray for me. This 1 know thou'lt do ! but seek me not, ’tis vain,
I’d throw a shadow on thy home—l cannot come again.
They say that in the desert drear some greenness may be found,
Some oasis in contrast strange to all the waste around,
And even thus, within my heart, guilt-darkened though it be,
There is a love all-beautiful that lives and clings to thee.
I’m weeping very bitterly, I cannot help these tears,
They are the tribute memory pays to joys of fleeted years.
Good-bye! God bless thee, mother dear I I sorrow for thy pain.
Oh ! if I were but innocent, I’d gladly come again.
He served seven years of his numerous sentences on board the “Success.”
After all that dreadful discipline of darkness mostly, the natural course of
time brought about his day of release. As he stepped free, his appreciation
of the brightness of everything is well conveyed in the following lines :
I FEEL THAT I AM FREE.
To me the sky looks bluer,
And the green grass greener still,
And earth’s flowers seem more lovely
As they bloom on heath and hill.
There’s a beauty breathing round me
Like a newborn Eden now,
And forgotten are the furrows
Grief has graven on my brow.
There is gladness in the sunshine
As its gold light gilds the trees,
And I hear a voice of music
Singing to me in the breeze.
There is in my heart a lightness
That seemeth not of me,
For to-day I’ve burst from bondage,
And I feel that I am free.
Free in the golden sunshine,
Free in the fresh pure air,
Where the flowers of the forest
In their wild homes flourish fair.
Free to thought, to give expression,
To sing, to dance, and show
That the stern world has not crushed me
With its weary weight of woe.
Are the years of care and sorrow
But a dark dream of the past,
Or this new life but a vision
That is all too bright to last?


How exultingly my spirit
Flashes forth its newborn glee,
As amid rejoicing nature
I can feel that I am free.
I have neither friend nor loved one
To welcome me, nor home ;
And lonely through the wide world
As a stranger I must roam ;
I know not where to-morrow
To procure my daily bread,
And to-night the waving branches
Must canopy my head.
But if I had a palace,
If of friends a gladsome throng,
If some darling one were near me
To cheer with love and song,
If I’d riches which were boundless.
No more joyous could I be
Than what I am, exulting
In the thought that I am free.
Free in the bright glad sunshine,
Free in the fresh pure air.
My heart with gladness throbbing,
And on my brow no care.
There’s the blue sky all above me—
Not a prison-roof between —
And at my feet the flowers
Nestle in the verdure green.
Hark! I hear the breezes singing—
“ Lift thy heart to God on high,
Who hath brought thee back from sorrow
To this world of hope and joy.”
And the little nodding flowers
In a chorus sing to me—
“lf thy God from sin shall free thee,
Then thou shall indeed be free.”
When the hulks were abolished and the prisoners were taken ashore,
the Melbourne Argus offered £lOO prize in open competition, for the best
Essay on “ Crime.”
Under a nom-de-plume, Oweu Suffolk won the prize with his “Days of
Crime and Years of Sufferance,” a really fine literary performance.


THE KELLY GANG.
The Last of the Australian Highwaymen.
Among the numerous relics of lawless life in Australia now shown
on board the “Success,” none is more interesting than the ingenious suit
of shot-resisting steel which formed the impenetrable armour of Ned
Kelly, the leader of the notorious “Kelly Gang.” This rusty relic of the
hunted outlaw swings to and fro on the deck, suspended by a rope, a
position which is strongly suggestive of the after-fate of the original
wearer. The suit consists of breastplate, shoulder-guards, back-plate,
and vizor, complete. Indentations made by well-aimed bullets may be
seen in clusters, showing that the bushranger was at one time subjected
to a hot fire, and that if it had not been for this protection he must have
met with instant death. Ned Kelly, Dan Kelly, Steve Hart, and Joe
Byrne were a daring and murderous quartet, whose acts of brigandage
and highway robbery in Australia form a story as sensational and
exciting as any to be found in fiction.
The gang carried on operations after the abolition of the hulk system,
but as types of the later bushrangers, in contrast with old-time convicts,
such as Morgan and Melville, a brief description of their life and doings
may not be out of place.
The Kelly Brothers were descendants of convict stock; the father,
“Red” Kelly, having arrived from Van Dieman’s Rand when the excite-
ment of the gold fever gave every facility to the vultures of society to
prey upon the well-to-do emigrants. The accommodation provided then
in Melbourne was quite inadequate, and an auxiliary encampment of
white canvas tents dotted the primitive scrub and picturesque slopes
that fringed the Yarra Yarra. At night the lights within these frail
dwellings reflected the moving shadows of their occupants upon the walls.
Murders and robberies with violence were of constant occurrence.
“ Red ” Kelly, on his arrival, lived in that part of “ Canvas-town,” as it
was called, just on the rise, overlooking the river, a spot then known as
Emerald Hill. He had gained the reputation of being a violent and cruel
man, and more than one suspected him of being able to throw some light
on the mysterious disappearance of a young Englishman named Emery,
who was known to have been possessed of considerable means. Kelly
took up a large plot of land at Dcnnybrook, a few miles out of Melbourne.
Here he lived a rough, wild life, raising cattle year after year, with-
drawing himself further from the encroachment of civilisation.
“ Red ” Kelly conceived a violent attachment to the eldest daughter
of an adjoining settler named Quinn. Her father viewed the match
with much disfavour, but the daughter overlooked his faults, and went
with him to Melbourne to be married. The Quinns were known for
miles around as “horse-lifters” and cattle stealers, and from this marriage
sprang the family whose names achieved a world-wide notoriety. There
were three sons and four daughters, the two unmarried ones, Kate and
Grace, also coming much before the public as time went on.
On the death of their father, the eldest sou, James, a steady fellow,
took control of the selection, though the younger brothers very quickly
graduated in the school of crime. As a lad of fifteen, young Edward
Kelly was charged, as assistant to the notorious Harry Power, with horse
stealing; and he afterwards served short sentences for various breaches
of the law. He was a flash, bold and daring rider, and a good bushman.


The other brother, Dan, had for years been known as a determined and
passionate man, although he was seven years younger than the leader
He had all the recklessness of youth, and a lack of self-control that was
characteristic of a lad brought up by his mother to regard the police as
his natural enemies.
Steve Hart was born in iB6O, and was one of the Kellys’ most early
acquaintances. He grew up to be a good type of an athletic country lad.
He could run like a deer, and outride even the proverbial trooper. In
transposing- and defacing the brands on stolen horses and cattle he was
without an equal amongst the whole fraternity, and woe betide the earner
or traveller who neglected due precautions in fastening their animals in
camp when young Steve Hart, the horse thief, was in the locality.
Joe Byrue, the fourth member of the gang, was a Beechworth native,
having been born in 1857.
In March, 1878, Dan Kelly, the younger brother was ‘‘wanted’’for
cattle stealing, and a constable named hitzpatnck ( ™ a ® ‘
suspended for misconduct) went to the house of Mrs Keny at Greta to
arrest her son. Mrs. Kelly pleaded with the constable to allow Dan to
take a meal before starting for Benalla. As no resistance was offered, the
constable at last consented.
A horseman then rode up to the house and hastily flung the reins oyer
the post at the gateway, and, sharply pushing the door open confronted
the astonished constable with a question'as to whether he had a warrant
for the arrest of his prisoner. Fitzpatrick said he had not, and reco om-
siny his Questioner as ? Ned Kelly, drew his revolver to prevent Dans escape

firearms Ned who was a tall, powerful fellow, reached down his rifle that
was slung over the mantelpiece and dared the constable to take the

being 1 lodged in Fitzpatrick’s wrist, but it is an open question whether the
ball was from Kelly’s rifle or the constable s own weapon.

Cm.l%°om I lwiul, C ''ml y s a ou lire following day just as


morning dawned, two of the troopers went to reconnoitre down the <rorge
They remained away for the best part of the day; Constables Mclntyre
and Lomgau remaining in camp. The latter, being an excellent cook
busied himself in preparing a meal for the party on the return of their
comrades. During his work he imagined he heard an unusual noise in
the bush, and left the camp, rifle in hand, to satisfy himself. In returning
he thoughtlessly discharged a shot at a couple of chattering parrots
The report resounded through the mountains, and the Kellys, who were
in ambush, seemed to have travelled immediately towards ’the firing
Through the dense forest they stealthily crept unseen, and, watching
their opportunity, sprang suddenly from the bush, and stood by the side
of Mclntyre, with the command: “Bail up! Throw up your hands'”
The surprise was complete. The constable’s revolver was some distance
away in the tent, and Douigan, disregarding the bushranger’s command
rushed towards the tent for his rifle. Ned Kelly, taking careful aim’
fired his rifle, and, when the smoke had cleared, the unfortunate constable
was seen prostrate, having received a shot in the head that very soon
proved fatal. Mclntyre was then ordered to a position close to a fallen
log. Dan Kelly suggested that Mclntyre should be handcuffed with the
handcuffs they had found in the tent; but Ned Kelly, tapping his rifle
said, “ No, never mind! I’ve something safer here.” ’
Just at that moment Kennedy and Scanlan returned to the camp quite
unexpectedly, but Ned Kelly’s call to “ Bail up ” was drowned by the
instant firing of the rifles of the younger members of the gang. Kennedy
fired, and after having emptied his revolver, cried out, “ It’s all right stop
it, stop it! ” The brave constable, Scanlan, was killed on the ’spot
Kennedy then, on foot, engaged in a terrible fight, and as his horse which
became startled by the firing, raced past the log where Mclntyre was
standing, that officer, with marvellous agility, vaulted into the saddle, and
bending forward, raced down the banks of the creek. Bullets whistled
round him, his hat being pierced by a ball, while his horse received a
wound from which it soon afterwards fell exhausted from loss of blood.
Sergeant Kennedy ran from tree to tree, firing meanwhile, and at last
being seriously wounded, threw up his hands as a sign that he surrendered
But scarcely had he done so than he fell heavily to the ground from the
injuries he had sustained. The bushranger, carrying his rifle slung- loosely
under his arm, muzzle downwards, bent over his fallen foe. The wounded
sergeant gasped with evident difficulty, “ Ned Kelly, I am dyino- • but I be<*
of you, for the love of God, to give me what little chance I may have tS
huger for a short time, so that I may perhaps still be able to say good-bye
to my dear wife and children, I would scorn to beg for my own life • but
oh ! it is hard to die without one look from those I love.”
The outlaw was moved by the dying man’s appeal. “ I always
admired you, Kennedy ” he said, “ and as you have acted like a brave
man in a fair fight, I 11 pass a message by one of the lads, so that before
sundown your wife can be with you.”
“ God bless you, Kelly ! God bless you! ” faltered poor Kennedy: but as
the last words left his bps there was a flash, a report, and the body of the
unfortunate sergeant writhed in its death agony.
Mclntyre reported at Beualla the sensational encounter; but the work
of following up the trail was difficult and dangerous, as the gang were
surrounded by sympathisers, who contrived to lead them on false scents.
On the 18th of December, 187S, just as the station hands were at
dmuer, a man, who had the appearance of a tired traveller, sauntered to
the door of Youughusbaud’s Station, about three miles from the township

jreast pocket, and then, quick as lightning, presented his revolver at the
head of the affrighted cashier.
At that moment Dan Kelly and Hart (who had drawn the cart into the
back yard and fastened up the horses) made their appearance in the office
having entered from the back of the houses. Mr. Scott, the manager of
the bank, whose feelings may be better imagined than described, was
ready dressed to attend the funeral of a resident in the town. Mrs. Scott
with her mother and seven children, were about to go for a walk through
the township, when the bushranger entered the room, smiling. The lady
exhibited great tact and presence of mind, and told Ned Kelly that he
a much better-looking man than she had understood him to be.
Kelly directed that they should all take seats in the vehicles that were in
waiting, and honour him with their company in a drive towards the
mountains. Dan Kelly and Hart then accepted the responsibility of the
safe custody of the gaily-dressed party; and Ned insisted on perfect
silence being maintained while he, in company with the manager and
accountant, made a careful examination of the bank.
The opening of the safes revealed a considerable amount of retorted
gold that had been purchased that afternoon from miners working in the
surrounding gullies, and also rolls of notes and about in gold and
silver. As the robber poured the glittering stream into bags that he had
found in the office, the banker must have thought that for one day, in a
country bank, • the drawings were very considerable.
Ordering the officials to precede him to the cart, Ned Kelly placed the
proceeds of the robbery, a weighty parcel, at his feet, and the banker’s
family party were then driven in the various vehicles out of the town,
with the robbers at the reins. Arriving at the homestead, the visitors
brought from Euroa were placed with the other prisoners in the store-
room.
The division of the spoil was next proceeded with, the stolen gold was
fairly shared, and papers consicfered useless or incriminating were scattered
broadcast by Ned Kelly as he sat upon his tall grey mare directing
operations.
The bolts on the storehouse door w T ere then withdrawn by Byrne, and
the prisoners were compelled to promise to remain within the precincts
of the station for fully three hours. The gang then put spurs to their
horses and galloped wildly round and round the homestead, so that the
tracks of their horses in the turf could give no clue to the direction of
their flight, and finally they made off towards the Strathbogie Ranges.
The reward was then raised considerably, and an old schoolmate of the
Kellys, named Aaron Sherritt, himself a doubtful character, volunteered
the information that the outlaws’ next exploit w 7 ould be in the adjoining
colony, probably at the towm of Goulburn. He had, he said, been asked


£8,000 REWARD.
WHEREAS Edward Kelly, Daniel Kelly,
.Stephen Hart, and Joseph Byrne have been declared
outlaws in the Colonies of Victoria and New South Wales;
and WHEREAS , warrants have been issued charging
them with wilful murder, and WHEREAS , the above-
named offenders are still at large, I hereby notify with this
my proclamation that the above Reward will be paid for
the apprehension of the above-named four men, etc., etc.
to join the gang, but had refused. The information proved, in a measure,
correct, for about three weeks afterwards the gang “ bailed up ” the whole
of the inhabitants of Jerilderie, a country town in New South Wales,
about fifty miles from the border. Instead of avoiding the local watch-
house as one would have expected, they gave it their first attention.
In the front were the constable’s quarters, a two-storey building with
rather a pretentious appearance. By the light of the lamp that hung in
the porch, the robbers read—with mingled feelings of interest and affected
derision—this startling proclamation :
But the outlaws had no inclination to read through the mass of print-
ing, in -which the word “whereas,” in great black capitals, occurred with
needless frequency. Signalling to the others to leave him in the entrance,
Ned Kelly shouted, “Help! Murder! Murder! Police!” and knocked
repeatedly at the door with his revolver. The village sergeant, who had
retired for the night, jumped up in a fright and groped downstairs, but
before opening the street door, demanded, “ Who is there ? ”
Kelly replied: “A man is being murdered at the rear of Cox’s Hotel.”
The door was no sooner opened, than a revolver was thrust in the face
of the half-dressed sergeant, and he was immediately handed over as a
prisoner to Byrne. The brothers Kelly and Steve Hart ordered the other
constables on the premises to be locked in the cells of the watch-house
adjoining.
The following morning their audacity reached its climax Dan Kelly
and Steve Hart donned the helmets and uniforms of the Jerilderie Police,
and posing as relief constables, perambulated the town. They made
inquiries as to the security of the bank, and all such information was
gladly afforded the pseudo-guardians of the peace.
Next door to the Hotel was the Bank of New South Wales. The
manager, Mr. Tarletou, had just returned from a long and dusty ride, and
feeling fatigued, was in the act of enjoying a bath. He was forced to
dress and give the gang assistance, and was ordered to explain the
working of the secret combination lock upon the treasure drawer. Kelly
collected ,£1,450, which he wrapped in a small parcel. Jerilderie was in
a state of siege and plunder for two days; saddlery and provisions being
taken from the shops and stores, while Dan Kelly and Steve Hart amused
themselves by galloping up and down the main thoroughfare, shouting,,


“Hurrah for the good old times of Morgan and Ben Hall! ” Ned Kelly
released the townspeople, but in a parting harangue he warned them that
the local constables were to remain prisoners till nightfall. If his orders
were disobeyed he would be surely avenged.
The rest of the gang then disappeared, and their hiding-place remained
a mystery. Relays of police returned from the mountains disgusted and
fatigued, and the “Kelly scare” had lost its interest in Melbourne through
the absence of information. But a fresh sensation and tragic occurrence
showed that the gang had not relinquished operations.
One Saturday night four troopers were in the house of Aaron Sherritt,
the man to whom we have already alluded. The supper had just been
prepared, when a loud knock was heard at the door. Sherritt called out,
“Who’s there?” The reply came, “I say, Sherritt, I’ve lost my way.”
Aaron immediately recognised the voice as that of Antonio Wicks (an
inoffensive neighbour), and opened the door. There was a flash, the
report of a rifle, and Aaron Sherritt fell back into the hut, shot dead on
the spot. Upon recovering from their first alarm, the inmates of the
hut found Wicks standing handcuffed, pale and trembling. He had, it
seemed, been compelled by the gang to play the part of decoy in order
to gain for them an entrance to the hut.
Ned Kelly and Steve Hart had preceded the others to Gleurowan to
carry out a diabolical design. The rails were wrenched from the sleepers
at a dangerous curve in the mountains where the line crosses a trestle
bridge spanning a ravine. As the ruffians had anticipated, the murder of
Aaron Sherritt was soon flashed along the telegraphic wire from town to
town, and a special train was promptly started from Melbourne. The
train contained the most distinguished of the Victorian troopers, sergeants,
and superintendents, and also picked reporters from the Melbourne
dailies, who became war correspondents for the nonce.
While they are travelling cautiously towards Beechworth, via Glen-
rowan, we must give our readers an account of the movements of the
“Kelly gang” at the latter place. Glenrowau is a small and sleepy
village, and Sundays were naturally very quiet and uneventful days. But
Sunday, the 28th June, 1880, was a memorable exception. As the day
advanced, each passer-by was made prisoner f by one or other of the
outlaws, and taken to Jones’ Hotel.
The Kellys promised that no injury would be done to those who offered
no resistance. Byrue now assumed a new rSle, and took up his post as
barman at the hotel, where beer and spirits were freely provided to the
involuntary customers. Others relieved the tedium of their captivity by
athletic competitions.
Ned Kelly stood for some time an interested spectator, and after
seeing the local wheelwright make a good jump, he joined in the sport,
his remarkable jumping powers astonishing everyone. Although Kelly
carried his revolvers in his hands as weights, the wheelwright eventually
leaped far in advance of the outlaw’s best effort, and Ned’s failure to
reach the same mark called forth the remark from Byrne, who had also
become an onlooker, “You seem a bit off, to-day, Ned,” whereupon Kelly,
throwing off his tunic, exposed a sheet of iron, curved so as to fit and
thoroughly protect the body.
But the massacre of the police by the wrecking of the “special’’ was
not to be. Kelly’s murderous design was frustrated by the bravery of a
man whose name deserves to figure on the list of heroes. That man was
Curnow, the village schoolmaster. In order to escape from the hotel, he
pretended to join in the merriment, and even danced with Dan Kelly.


Gaining the confidence of the outlaws, he was allowed to leave. Snatching
up a red llama shawl belonging to his sister, he procured a candle and
a box of matches, and after persuading his wife and sister to take the
children to their mother’s house for safety, he started out to stop the
special and save human life.
On gaining the railway he ran at top speed along the track in the
direction of Benalla, haunted by the double fear of being overtaken by
the watchful Ned Kelly and of being too late to avert the impending
catastrophe. Suddenly he came upon the devilish handiwork of the gang
—a wide-staring gap barring his way and causing him an inward shudder
as he pictured to himself the terrible fate that must await the train if he
failed in his efforts to warn the driver. Curnow darted down the
steep embankment, across the deeply-rutted road below, and then
climbed the embankment on the other side, where the line con-
tinued from the dangerous curve. Presently he discerned the
head-light of the pilot engine, and as his breath came quick and
fast, he heard the brakes applied. He shouted, “ The Kellys have
torn up the track,” and bolted through the bush back to his anxious
wife and family.
There was still no news of the expected train, and the outlaw began to
suspect that all his plans had been defeated. He anxiously watched the
proceedings at the hotel, where the younger outlaws seemed utterly
reckless and lost to all sense of fear. Dancing, card-playing and
singing were the order of the evening. The ne’er-do-weels and even
some of the townsfolk of Glenrowan, clinked glasses with the young
ruffians, and feigned a conviviality they could scarcely have felt. In an
interval between the dances, Dan Kelly mounted a chair, amidst loud
applause, and announced that he would contribute to the “harmony”
of the evening by giving them a song.
A bearded yokel, who was fingering an
accordion, then started “The Wearin’ o' the
Green,” as an encouragement to the vocalist,
who in a fairly pleasant voice then began :
“Oh ! Paddy dear, and did you hear the news
that’s going round,
On the head of bould Ned Kelly they’ve placed
ten thousand pound ;
On Stephen Hart and Joseph Byrne a similar
sum they’d give,
But if the sum were doubled, sure, —the
' Kelly bhoys’ would live.”
Verse after verse was reeled off recounting the
exploits of the “gang,” and even their future plans
were poetically outlined. But the party was
suddenly and completely disorganised by the
sound of a shrill whistle from a locomotive, and
the festivities came to an abrupt termination.
The train, with its formidable company of armed
police, had escaped the pitfall, and had safely
drawn up on the further side. The outlaws,
on finding that their schemes had failed, retreated
to a special room in the hotel, which, till then,
had been kept closely locked. Here they
protected themselves with suits of armour,
cursing loudly when the fittings gave them any
trouble. The helmets were of a most primitive
description, and all save Ned Kelly discarded that
portion of the equipment. The armour was
concealed at first by an overcoat.
Kelly’s Armour.


He boldly advanced to the front of the building, and on seeing the
police, who had b} r this time approached the hotel, he rattled the muzzle
of his revolver upon his rough breastplate, and in a loud voice challenged
them to “come on.’’
The police simultaneously fired a heavy volley, the force of which
caused Ned to stagger backwards, but quickly recovering himself, he
unslung his rifle and blazed away at his opponents, with the result that
Superintendent Hare’s wrist was completely shattered. Hare was forced
to retire to have his wound dressed, and eventually he had to return to
Beualla to procure surgical aid.
The police were in a very perplexing situation, for after firing the first
volley into the building a succession of women’s shrieks plainly told them
that they had either wounded or perhaps killed innocent persons. Joe
Bj-rne, who, notwithstanding the determined attack of the police, was
leaning against the bar of the hotel quite unconcernedly drinking, was
shot in the groin, and, after lingering some time in excruciating agony,
he gradually sank and died.
The police followed up the attack, and Ned Kelly showed a courage
that was worthy of a better cause. The conflict was carried on for upwards
of half-au-hour; then Sergeant Steele, getting to within ten yards of
Kelly, fired two shots which, striking him in the legs, brought him
down with a crash. Kellv’s eves flashed with anger, and he cursed and
roared with brute-like He was bound hand and foot and sent to
Melbourne in a special train.' Volley after volley was then poured into
the building, but there was no response from the outlaws, who, with their
few prisoners that had refused from timidity to leave the hotel, must
have passed a terrible time.
The firing of the outlaws having ceased, and darkness approaching,
the constables adopted a desperate plan to exterminate the bushrangers
that were located in the hotel. Constable Johnson cautiously crept to the
side of the wooden structure, placed straw against the boards, saturated it
with kerosene and ignited it. Quicker than it takes to write it, the flames
shot up round the building, which was soon burning fiercely with its
doomed occupants within. Just after the fire was kindled a thrilling
incident occurred. Father Gibuey, a Catholic priest, who was in the
locality, heard Ned Kelly’s confession, and having anointed him, hastily
made his way to the scene of the tragedy. Just then a voice among the
crowd cried out, “Old Martin Cherry is lying wounded in the hotel!”
Cherry it appeared, had been too severely wounded in the affray to leave
the hotel when the others had, and lay helpless in one of the apartments
on the ground floor. Without a moment’s hesitation the reverend gentle-
man ran towards the part of the building where Cherry was surmised to be
1 yin o' The crowd, upon perceiving his intention, gave the brave priest a
rousino cheer, and then, in bVeathless suspense, waited for his reappearance.
Several policemen also rushed forward to the rescue, and soon afterwards
were seen with Father Gibuey in their midst, bearing the dying form of
poor old Cherry and the corpse of Joseph Byrne terribly scorched by the
fire When the fire had spent itself, the police discovered the charred
remains of Dan Kelly and Steve Hart in the midst of the smoking debris,
their armour, twisted by the heat, lying alongside them.
But space forbids the writer to trespass further. The trial of Ned
Kelly was held in Melbourne, Judge Barry presiding. A verdict of guilty
was returned. The judge then proceeded to pass sentence of death, and
after he had concluded with the usual words, “And may the Lord have
mercy on your soul,” Kelly drew himself up to Ins full height and,
assuming a defiant air, said; “ I will go a little further thau that, and
say, I will see you where I go.”


The day preceding the execution, his mother paid Ned a farewell visit.
The mother’s last words to her son were, “Mind you die like a Kelly,
Ned! ”
As Kelly stepped upon the scaffold, he exclaimed; “Ah, well! it’s come
to this at last! Such is life.” On November 12th, 1880, the grim process
of law was carried out, death being instantaneous. The extermination
of this gang had cost the Victorian Government the stupendous sum
of
Kate Kelly, the younger sister, with the outlaw’s grey mare, formed
the principal attraction at the Melbourne music-halls for a time, but
the exhibition was promptly and properly stopped by the police.
Hundreds of sympathisers and admirers flocked to see her, and
regarded her in the light of a heroine; and in the height of the “ Kelly
scare” an enterprising Melbourne publican engaged her at the remunera-
tion of £5O a week, in the capacity of barmaid, though she afterwards
married a settler named Seymour, at Gippsland.
With the advancement of the Colonies and the greatly improved
organization of the police, a repetition of the humiliating failures to bring
these criminals to justice would be impossible. The uncouth suit of iron
armour, that is now the only memento of the bold and reckless robber,
belongs as much to another age as do those shapely suits of burnished
steel that fill the niches of our baronial halls. They alike speak of lawless
days when might usurped the place of right, and when murderers
masqueraded in the garb of heroes. The Kellys and their comrades ruled
b} r force and intimidation, and for years defied the vast machinery of the
law to encompass their capture. But the triumph of the law was at last
complete, the high purpose of law was maintained.
“ Law was designed to keep a stale in peace,
To punish robbery that wrong might cease,
To be impregnable—a constant fort
To which the weak and helpless may resort.”
Highway robbery in Australia has fortunately become a thing of
the past —the revolver-belt of the freebooter marks its wearer now as but
a scoundrel-at-large; and on the death of the Kelly gang, the colonies
received congratulations from all parts of the world at having at length
extirpated

One wonders how long it will be before the nation will regard moral imbecility as a
condition quite as helpless as mental imbecility. The spending of years in wretched
and torturing confinement could only, by a natural law, aggravate the moral habits and
deficiencies of those natural criminals whom the authorities thought thus to correct.”
