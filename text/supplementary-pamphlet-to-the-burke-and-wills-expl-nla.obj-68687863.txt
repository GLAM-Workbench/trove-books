BURKE AND WILLS EXPLORING EXPEDITION.
* COMMISSION OF INQUIRY.
FIRST MEETING.
The commission, consisting of Sir Thomas
Pratt, Sir Francis Murphy, the Hon. Mr Her-
vey, Mr. Sullivan, and Mr. Sturt, appointed
to inquire into the circumstances attending
the death of Mr. Burke and Mr. Wills, held
their first sitting on November 2,1861, in the
large committee-room adjoining the Legisla-
tive Cowncil chamber. All the members of
the commission were present, and Sir Thomas
Pratt was appointed chairman.
Mr. Dumas, assistant clerk of the Legislative
Assembly, officiated as secretary.
Dr. Macadam was present on behalf of the
Exploration Committee, and to present the
requisite books and papers; and Mr. Brahe
and Mr. Wills, father of the late Mr. Wills,
were also in attendance.
Sir Thomas Pkatt, after taking the chair,
said he trusted that the press would forbear
commenting on the evidence which might be
taken from day today, until such time as it
was completed.
In answer to the Chairman,
Dr. Macadam stated that he was deputed by
the Exploration Committee of the Royal So-
ciety to attend with all the papers connected
with the progress of the Exploring Expedition,
and to submit them for full investigation.
But perhaps the members of the commission
would be kind enough to say what document
they would require first.
The Chairman was desirous, first, of ascer-
taining the names of the persons appointed to
the various offices in the Exploring Expedi-
tion.
Sir Francis Murphy would point out, at
the same time, that they did not wish to go
further back than the Burke and Wills Expe-
dition, and what they desired to ascertain was
the names of the members of that Expedition,
and the amount of the stores taken up by
them.
Dr. Macadam would hand in the names,
together with a copy of the agreement entered
into; but he might state that the appoint-
ments made were simply these : ?Mr. Burke,
leader of the expedition; Mr. Landells, second
in command; Mr. Wills, astronomer; and Dr.
Becker, naturalist and geologist; and a num-
ber of other persons in subordinate positions,
whose names would be found in the agree-
ment ; and the instructions issued were regu-
lated according to the duties of the officers of
the party. He might also state that the astro-
nomical and geological observations would be
laid before the commission. They had been
drawn up from the notes by committees of
gentlemen capable of performing that duty
successfully?the astronomical and geological
notes having been arranged principally by
Professor Neumayer, and the observations in
natural history by Dr. Mueller and Professor
M?Coy. These observations had been received
at different times, as would be seen from the
books, and when necessary, as in the case of
Wills?s notes, they were immediately handed
over to the committees for arrangement. The
following, he would add, were the instructions
issued to the leader of the Expedition:?
? Exploration Committee, Royal Society of
Victoria
? Melbourne,? August 18,1860.
? Sir, ?I am directed by the committee to
convey to you the instructions and views
which have been adopted in connexion with
the duties which have devolved upon you as
leader of the party now organised to explore
the interior of Australia.
? The committee having decided upon
Cooper?s Creek of Sturt as the basis of your
operations, requests that you will proceed
thither, form a depot of provisions and stores,
and make arrangements for keeping open a
communication in your rear to the Darling, if
in your opinion advisable, and thence to Mel-
bourne, so that you may be enabled to keep
the committee informed of your movements,
and receive in return the assistance in stores
and advice of which you may stand in need.
Should you find that a readier communica-
tion can be made by way of the South Aus-
tralian Police Station, near Mount Serle, you
will avail yourself of that means of writing to
the committee.
?In your route to Cooper?s Creek you will
avail yourself of any opportunity that may
present itself of examining and reporting on
the character of the country east and west of
the Darling.
? You will make arrangements for conveying
the stores to a point opposite Mount Macpher-
son, which seems to the committee to be the
best point of departure from this river for
Cooper?s Creek, and while tte main body of
the party is proceeding to that part, you may
have further opportunities of examining the
country on either side of your route.
? In your further progress from Mount Mac-
pherson towards Cooper?s Creek, the committee
also desire that you should make detours to
the right and left with the same object.
? The object of the committee in directing
you to Cooper?s Creek is, that you should ex-
plore the country intervening between it and
Leichardt?s track south of the Gulf of Carpen-


taria, avoiding as far as practicable Sturt?s
route on the west, and Gregory?s down the
Victoria on the east. To this object the com-
mittee wishes you to devote your energies in
the first instance 5 but should you determine
the impracticability of this route, you are de-
sired to turn westward into the country re-
cently discovered by Stuart, and connect his
furthest point northward with Gregory?s fur-
thest southern exploration in 1856 (Mount
Wilson.)
?In proceeding from Cooper?s Creek to
Stuart?s country, you may find the salt marshes
an obstacle to the progress of the camels; if so,
it is supposed you will be able to avoid these
marshes by turning to the northward as far as
Eyre?s Creek, where there is permanent water,
and then going westward to Stuart?s furthest.
?Should you, however, fail in connecting
the two points of Stuart?s and Gregory?s fur-
thest, or should you ascertain that this space
has been already traversed, you are requested,
if possible, to connect your explorations with
those of the younger Gregory, in the vicinity
of Mount Gould, and thence you might pro-
ceed to Shark?s Bay, or down the river Mur-
chison to the settlements in Western Aus-
tralia.
?This country would afford the means of
recruiting the strength of your party, and you
might, after a delay of five or six months be
enabled, with the knowledge of the country
you shall have previously acquired, to return
by a more direct route through South Aus-
tralia to Melbourne.
? If you should, however, have been success-
ful in connecting Stuart?s with Gregory?s fur-
thest point in 1856 (Mount Wilson), and your
party should be equal to the task, you would
probably find it possible from thence to reach
the country discovered by the younger Gre-
gory-
? The committee is fully aware of the diffi-
culty of the country you are called on to tra-
verse, and in giving you these instructions
has placed these routes before you more as an
indication of what it is deemed desirable to
have accomplished than as dictating any exact
course for you to pursue.
? The committee considers that you will find
a better and a safer guide in the natural fea-
tures of the country through which you will
have to pass.
? For all useful and practical purposes, it will
be better for you, and for the object of future
settlement, that you should follow the water
courses and the country yielding herbage, than
to pursue any route which the committee
might be able to sketch out from an imperfect
map of Australia.
?The committee entrusts you with the
largest discretion as regards the forming of
dep6ts and your movements generally, but re-
quests that you will mark your routes as per-
manently as possible, by leaving records, sow-
ing seeds, building cairns, and marking trees,
at as many points as possible consistent with
your various other duties.
? With reference to financial subjects, you
will be furnished with a letter of authority to
give orders on the treasurer for the payment
of any stores or other transports, cattle, sheep,
or horses you may require ; and you will not
fail, as soon as possible, to furnish to the trea-
surer from time to time detailed accounts of
the articles for which you have given such
orders in payment.
? Each person of the party will be allowed to
give authority for of his salary being paid
into any bank or to any person he may appoint
to receive the same, provided a certificate is
forwarded from you that he has efficiently
discharged his duty.
? The committee requests that you will
make arrangements for an exact account be-
ing taken of the stores, and their expenditure
by the person you place in charge of them.
? The committee also requests that you
would address all your communications on
subjects connected with the exploration to the
honorary secretary; and that all persons act-
ing with you should forward their communi-
cations on the same subject through you,
? You will cause full reports to be furnished
by your officers on any subject of interest, and
forward them to Melbourne as often as may
be practicable, without retarding the progress
of the Expedition.
?The committee has caused the enclosed
set of instructions to be drawn up, having re-
lation to each department of science, and you
are requested to hand each of the gentlemen a
copy of the part more particularly relating to
his department.?
The Chairman ?From these instructions it
would appear that Mr. Burke was left in a
great measure free to exercise his own discre-
tion?
Dr. Macadam. ?Yes; and at a subsequent
meeting of the committee, it was decided to
leave Mr. Burke entirely to his own discretion
after leaving Cooper?s Creek. The decision
came to at that meeting would be found re-
corded in the minutes which he would after-
wards hand in.
Sir Francis Murphy presumed that these
instructions had been given in writing.
Dr. Macadam. ?Such was the case, and copies
of them were supplied to the commanders of
all the expeditions which had since gone out.
It would be seen that in the instructions the
committee had recommended Mr. Burke, after
forming a dep6t at Cooper's Creek, to keep
open the communication in his rear to the
Darling, if in his opinion advisable; and he
might quote from a despatch of Mr. Burke, of
date 16th October, from Menindie,to show that
he fully recognised the importance of that re-
commendation. In that despatch Mr. Burke
stated that it was his intention to form a
depot on the Darling, somewhere in the neigh-
bourhood of Menindie, and then to proceed on
to Cooper?s Creek with a small party, by a
route which would be shown to him by Mr.
Wright, and which he believed would be prac-
ticable; but he would run no risk, and he
would keep open his communication with the
Darling.
Mr. Sturt?Have you any subsequent letters
from him ?


Dr. Macadam.? Yes, one from Tarawatta,
seventy miles from Cooper?s Creek, dated the
29th October, which place Mr. Burke left on
the 31st, and another despatch from him from
Cooper?s Creek, dated the 13th December.
Mr. Sullivan? Have you all the correspon-
dence relative to the Expedition ?
Dr. Macadam.? The whole of the correspon-
dence would be laid before the commission.
In the despatch dated 13th December, Mr
Burke stated that he had informed Mr Wright
that he would consider him the third officer
of the party, from the day of his (Burke s)
departure from Menindie; and he fuither
stated that he had instructed Wright to follow
him on to Cooper?s Creek with the stores in
his charge as quickly as possible. It would
thus be seen that Wright was appointed by
Mr. Burke himself, and, therefore, a man in
whom the latter must have had confidence.
Sir Francis Murphy thought the commis-
sion would be proceeding more regularly with
the business before them if Dr. Macadam
would at that stage hand in the list of the
supplies given to Burke?s party, together with
the correspondence.
Dr. Macadam begged to hand in the list of
the stores and equipment, taken from the Go-
vernment storekeeper?s book. The stores and
equipment, he would add, were not purchased
by the committee, but under the instructions
of the Government; and the list when com-
pleted, was afterwards submitted to the chief
for his approval, which it received. The pro-
visions supplied, he might state, were calcu-
lated to support the whole party for eighteen
months. ,
Mr. Sturt? Was there any correspondence
with Mr. Wright when at Menindie ?
Dr. Macadam. ?There was. He might state
that although the provisions were calculated
to last eighteen months, it was understood
that in case of necessity, they would, with the
necessary care, suffice for two years.
Mr. Sturt.? Does Wright, in his correspon-
dence, show what stores he had at Menindie
after Burke left ? ,
Dr. Macadam did not think that such was
the case; but there was a list of the stores he
brought back with him.
Sir Francis Murphy presumed that the
books would show the full supply of provisions
provided for the Expedition.
Dr. Macadam said they would; and he
might add that the total expenditure had been
�4,585 2s. 10d., for the equipment of the party,
including everything. ,
The Chairman asked whether Mr. Burke
had not detailed the manner in which he had
dealt with the provisions when at Menindie r
Dr. Macadam did not think he had done so.
Mr. Sturt desired to know what had been
done in reference to the communication of
Mr Hodgkinson on the subject of provisions.
Dr. Macadam said that Mr. Hodgkinson had
come down with a despatch, dated 19th Octo-
ber, from Mr. Burke, stating that more pro-
visions would be required, and asking for a
grant of �250 for their purchase. That com-
munication was received on the 30th of Decern-
ber, and the committee met on the 31st. At
that meeting the sum of �4OO was voted, and
Mr. Hodgkinson immediately started to rejoin
his party. Burke and Wright left Menindie
together, hut when they reached Tarawatta,
the latter was sent back to Menindie to bring
on the remainder of the stores as fast as he
could. In carrying out that object, however,
there was some delay which had yet to be
properly explained, the downward journey
having been made in eight days, while there
was a difference of a month and nineteen
days in the return journey.
Mr. Sturt? Were there any letters from
Brahe ? , ,
Dr. Macadam.? There was only Brahe?s re-
port, which had been made up in town; but
Brahe had come as far as Menindie with
Wright, and had then come down by him-
self.
In answer to questions by Sir Francis Mur-
phy and Mr. Sullivan.
Dr. Macadam stated that, until Mr. Burke
ceased to communicate there had been no
correspondence with any other of the party.
The Chairman asked whether it had come
under the notice of the committee that Burke
had expressed a strong desire to be left un-
fettered ?
Dr. Macadam. ?Not particularly so, because
Mr. Burke understood that he was to be left
to exercise his own judgment, more especially
after leaving Cooper?s Creek.
Mr. Sturt wished to know whether the
committee had given any instructions to Mr.
Burke with reference to the formation of de-
pots elsewhere than at Cooper?s Creek?
Dr. Macadam? The only instructions were
that a depot should be established at Cooper?s
Creek; that, if possible, Mr. Burke should
keep open the communication in his rear to
the Darling; and, beyond that, he was left
to the largest discretion, not only regarding
the formation of depots, but as to matters
generally. In accordance with these instruc-
tions, there was a depot formed at Cooper?s
Creek, and left in charge of one of the party.
The Hon. Mr. Hervey wished to know
whether there had been any correspondence
with Mr. Landells ?
Dr. Macadam.? There was a communica-
tion with regard to an unpleasant matter,
which had arisen between Mr. Burke and
Mr. Landells, with regard to the management
of the camels; but there was nothing bearing
on the present inquiry. He begged to hand
in the following papers:?The despatches of
Burke; Wright?s diary; despatches from Dr.
Becker; Dr. Beckler?s statement in reference
to his resignation; meteorological notes by
Dr. Becker; letter from Dr, Becker; Mr.
Hodgkinson?s statement as to the resigna-
tion of Landells; Dr. Becker?s diary, to No-
vember 14; letter from Mr. Wills to Professor;
Neumayer respecting Landell s resignation;
correspondence relative to the purchase of
horses by Wright; despatches from Mr. How-
itt, from the Darling; the diary of Mr. How-
itt from the Ist September to the 9th October;
Mr. Howitt?s despatches; papers relative to


the communication between Captain Mayne
and the committee on the subject of the over-
land expedition from Rockhampton; de-
spatches from Mr. Knowles (?), left in charge
of the depot at Menindie by Mr. Howitt;
Landells?s report as to his resignation
Wright?s second despatches; Hodgkinson?s
statement as to the depot at Menindie; de-
spatches recording the progress of the journey
of W right; Howitt?s further despatches be-
tween the 14th October and the 4th Decem-
ber; narrative of John King; Beckler?s re,
port; despatches from commander Norman-
from Brisbane, dated August 24 and Septem-
ber 17; statement as to the chorter of vessels
for the conveyance of coals to Carpentaria;
notes on plants, by Dr. Becker; further de-
spatches from Captain Mayne respecting
Walker?s expedition: Will?s report up to the
15th December at Cooper?s Creek; two other
packets of Becker?s reports; the charter of the
Firefly for the conveyance of stores and horses
from Brisbane to Carpentaria; copy of a letter
from Sir Henry Barkly to Sir George Bowen
respecting the fitting out of the Expedition:
report of Dr. Beckler, health officer to Wright?s
party; Dr. Beckler?s despatches; the original
list of horses supplied to Wright at Menindie;
document referring to expenses at Menindie,
&c.
Sir Francis Murphy asked what men be-
longing to the Expedition were now available
for examination, supposing the commission
desired to take their evidence ?
Dr. Macadam said the men available for
examination would be Mr. King, who was on
his way to town, and would arrive on Monday,
it was expected; Mr. Brahe, who was present;
Mr. Wright, for whom he had telegraphed to
South Australia; Mr, M?Donough, who was
one of Mr. Brahe?s party at Cooper?s Creek ;
there was also a sepoy, who had been with that
party, who could be examined.
The Chairman. ?Does he speak English, or
is it difficult to make him comprehend what
is meant ?
Mr. Brahe said it was difficult to make the
sepoy understand in English what was meant.
He spoke Hindostanee. He was at Menindie
at present.
The Chairman. ?Where is Dr. Beckler?
Dr. Macadam could not say, but his address,
he thought, could be obtained from Dr. Muel-
ler, who was likely to know it.
Mr. Wills believed that Dr. Beckler was at
present with Professor Neumayer, somewhere
near the Murray. He had that morning seen
a letter from Professor Neumayer.
Dr. Macadam said there was also a man
named Smith, now with Howitt?s party, but
who had originally belonged to Wright?s par-
ty, who could be examined.
The Hon. Mr. Hervey asked whether the
maps which had been placed on the table were
for the use of the commission ?
Dr. Macadam. ?Certainly; but the survey-
or-general would provide them with a new
and more complete map, embracing Wills?s
last notes.
Dr. Macadam desired to make one state-
ment. He had already spoken of the rapidity
on the part of the committee in complying
with the request of Mr. Howitt for an addition
to his party, as contained in his letter to
them ; but he would add that the next com-
munication they had on the subject was with
Brahe, who arrived in Melbourne on the Sun-
day morning. The committee met that
afternoon, and in four days afterwards Howitt
was strengthened by an addition to his party.
Howitt himself had met Brahe on this side of
Swan Hill, and returned to town with him.
The date at which the committee had first
determined to send out a party in case any-
thing should have gone wrong, was the 18th
of June; while Brahe had not arrived until
the 30th, four days previous to which ?on the
26th ?Howitt?s party were actually in the
field. Howitt finally started with his in-
creased party on the 24th of July. He would
hand to the secretary a list of dates, which
might be of use to the commission; but he
might add, in the meantime, that the com-
mittee first entertained the idea of sending a
steamer round the coast on the 24th of June,
six days previous to the arrival of the news
by Brahe; but it would be remembered that
although the despatch of the steamer was de-
cided upon, she was at the time undergoing
repairs, and could not be despatched for some
time afterwards. He would also call attention
to the circumstance that Burke must have
been dying when Brahe was on his way be-
tween Sandhurst and Melbourne. He was also
desirous of mentioning that Wright wrote the
committee from Menindie on the 19th of
March, and left for Cooper?s Creek on the 26th,
reaching Bulla, 170 miles from the creek, on
the 4th of April, and there, it appeared, he
had remained, with an ample supply of pro-
visions, including preserved fruits, vegetables,
rice, pickles, and everything which could have
contributed to the success of Burke?s party,
until the 29th, when he met Brahe coming
down, and joining company, they reached the
Darling together, from which point Brahe
came down alone. He would only, for him-
self and the other members of the committee,
state that they would be happy to attend, and
give whatever information was in their power,
at any tine the commission might require
their presence.
The Chairman said it would be desirable for
Dr. Macadam to hand in the statement he had
made in writing, to be placed with the other
documents.
The commission then adjourned until
Wednesday. November 27th, at one o?clock.
SECOND MEETING.
The commission held its second meeting
November 27, at one p.m., in the large cham-
ber adjoining the Legislative Council cham-
bers. All the membrrs were present, as also
were Dr. Macadam and Mr. Brahe.
_ Nearly half-an-hour was occupied in pre-
liminary business before the representatives
of the press were admitted. Our reporter was
informed that during that interval Air.


Haverfleld had been appointed permanent
secretary to the commission, in the room of
Mr. A. G. Dumas, who had hitherto acted as a
temporary secretary. A vote of thanks to Mr.
Dumas for his services was unanimously
agreed to.
After the admission of the representatives
of the press,
The Secretary read a very lengthy precis
of the correspondence connected with the Ex-
ploring Expedition.
SirF. Murphy asked Dr. Macadam if he
would be willing to give evidence at once.
Dr. Macadam said he was ready to be ex-
amined at once. He should be present at
every meeting of the commission, and ready
at all times to give evidence. He took oc-
casion to hand in a few more documents
connected with the Expedition, including
despatches from Captain Mayne, from the
Commissioner of Land and Survey for South
Australia, lists of articles included in Mr.
Howitt?s equipment, as also the lists of articles
included in the original equipments of Mr.
Burke?s and Mr. Howitt?s parties.
In answer to questions put by various mem-
bers of the committee,
Dr. Macadam said that originally there were
two committees appointed to take charge of
matters connected with exploration. The
first one belonged to the Royal Society, and
the members of the other were selected at a
liublic meeting called for the purpose. The
after had to raise funds and collect subscrip-
tions for exploration purposes. With the
consent of the Government, these two were
amalgamated, and their names originally
stood as follow: ?Sir W. Stawell, chairman;
the Hon. J. Hodgson, M.L.C., Mr. C. W. Ligar,
Mr. Hodgkinson (deputy surveyor-general),
Professor M?Coy, Dr. Mueller, Professor Neu-
mayer, Captain Cadell, the Rev. J. Bleasdale,
Dr. Eades, Dr. Iffla, and Messrs. Selwyn, A.
M'Millan, Watson, Gillbee, Mackenna, James
Smith, and T. Enabling. Dr. Wilkie was
treasurer, and himself (Dr. Macadam) hon.
secretary. Sub-committees were appointed to
consider special subjects, and those gentlemen
more immediately acquainted with the sub-
ject which came in question were usually
appointed. There was a sub-committee ap-
pointed to select and examine the provisions,
and they were directed to work in conjunc-
tion with Burke. The calculations in respect
to quantity were principally made by Dr.
Mueller, who was supposed to be more par-
ticularly acquainted with the subject, he
having gone out with Gregory?s northern
expedition. Burke was cognisant of all that
was done, and he and the sub-committee went
through a list of articles, which was agreed to,
and submitted to the full committee, who
transmitted it to the hon. Chief Secretary;
that gentleman approved of it, and gave orders
on the Government storekeeper as required.
All this was done with Burke?s entire concur-
rence. At one period the committee were
disposed to accept an offer made by Captain
Cadell, on the part of the Murray Navigation
Company, to take thirty tons of stores
gratuitously as far up the Murray as they
could ; but Burke considered that it would be
much better to have the matter in his own
control, so that he would not be dependent on
that which accidents might very easily keep
from being in time. Before leaving, Burke
expressed himself entirely satisfied with the
provisions and material provided, and said
that his Expedition was equipped as no ex-
pedition had been equipped before. The com-
mittee had no knowledge whatever of what
plans Burke would have after he left the
Darling, He was entirely unrestricted as to
his course, except that he was to move on to
Cooper?s Creek. His route was entirely un-
known to the committee. Despatches were
received pretty regularly from him while he
was at Menindie, up to the day of his depar-
ture. No further despatch was received from
him till quite recently, when the committee
had that memorandum sent by him from
Cooler?s Creek. After he left the Darling, the
next desnatch was that sent by Mr. Wright,
per Mr. Hodgkinson, on December 19. It was
only then that the committee knew what
Burke had done. They knew that Mr. Wright
had returned to the Darling, after leaving
Burke on his way, on November 6. The
committee had no means of knowing what
prevented any dispatch being sent between
November 5 and December 19, nor did they
know that any party was remaining at the
Darling, The dispatch sent per Mr. Hodgkin-
son arrived in Melbourne on the 30th
December, and the reply to it was dated on
the following day. There were no means
provided by the committee for extra com-
munication with Menindie, but there was a
postal communication once a fortnight. The
provisions supplied were principally examined
by Mr. Nash, the Government storekeeper, and
Burke himself. The committee had heard
that the pemmican had spoiled, but no reason
had been given for the fact. He (Dr.
Macadam) was not of his own knowledge
aware that Burke examined the food, but had
heard him describe himself as satisfied. The
pemmican was the same as that prepared in
other countries, viz., meat chopped down very
fine, and thoroughly dried. At the time
Burke left Melbourne, it was considered that
he had ample time to reach the Darling and
cross over to Cooper?s Creek at the most
favourable part of the year. The roads, how-
ever, were extremely heavy, and more diffi-
culties were experienced than were anticipated.
When Burke did cross, he had abundance of
water, but he was conscious that he must
push on to get to Cooper?s Creek. The notion
the committee entertained was that the party
would have been kept together till it reached
Cooper?s Creek. The waggons furnished for
the conveyance of stores were supposed by the
committee as likely to be of great use in
carrying stores beyond Menindie. One very
large waggon was fitted up as a boat, by which
the party could cross rivers. All was left to
Burke?s discretion, nor was any course of
action laid down for Burke after he left the
Darling, Burke, in leaving town, never com-


plained that he was encumbered or over-sup-
plied. From the heavy state of the roads, he
found that the waggons, especially those which
he had hired, interfered with his progress. He
had full discretion, both as to the quality and
quantity of his provisions. From the time he
intimated his intention to move on with a
light party, with Mr. Wright as guide, until
the committee got Mr. Wright?s letter, they
had no intimation of his progress. The com-
mittee?s notion then was, that Burke would
move on himself to Cooper?s Creek, and let
the stores come up after. The waggons
having been left, the camels had to be loaded.
Burke had carefully abstained from loading
the camels before, in order that they might be
in good condition when they were required.
Mr. Sturt.? Did it never strike the com-
mittee that the interval between November 6
and December 19, during which no despatch
was forwarded, was a very long one ?
Dr. Macadam explained that when Mr.
Wright?s despatch was received from Mr.
Hodgkinson, the greatest precipitancy of
movement was urged. Only two days elapsed
before Mr. Hodgkinson was despatched with
the necessary funds, and in the hurry, the fact
of the long interval was not noticed. No ex-
planation of the delay had as yet been given.
Captain Cadell only offered to take the pro-
visions as far as the Murray steamers would
go, viz., about 100 miles from Menindie. Burke
calculated that he could take up the provi-
sions much better by waggon, and the com-
mittee adopted his suggestion. The first in-
timation of the start from Menindie was
received from Burke?s letter, stating that he
was going forward with a small party, by what
he believed to be a practicable route, under
the guidance of Mr. Wright, manager to Mr.
Baker. Nothing more was heard till the des-
patch dated December 19 arrived; in fact the
committee were not at all anxious, as Burke
had said that he should keep up communica-
tion with the Darling. Mr. Hodgkinson had
taken nine days to bring down the despatch
of December 19, and was ten days returning.
His return must have been on about the 10th
or 11th of January; and on the 26th, Mr.
Wright started from the camp, going out on
the other side of the lake. _ From that time
no knowledge of the Expedition reached the
committee till Mr. Brahe came to town. No
news was received of the progress of Lyons
and Macpherson till the report of their disas-
ter came down. The letter was first sent to
Swan Hill, and Mr. H. Foster, the superinten-
dent of police, selected Lyons, who was sent
on to Menindie. No news was received from
them till that of their failure to reach Burke
?in fact the committee had got their despatch
back, as it never reached Burke, to whom it
was addressed. On the 13th of June, the com-
mittee having received no information from
any of the parties out, a resolution was pro-
posed and carried, to the effect that a light
flying party should be formed to proceed ra-
pidly to Menindie, and so on to Cooper?s Creek.
This was done from a sort of dread that some-
thing had happened. That party was orga-
nised, and Mr. Howitt, its leader, received his
instructions on the 24th June. Mr. Howitt
left Melbourne on the 26th June, and three
days after met Brahe on his way to town, with
disastrous intelligence from Wright?s party,
Mr. Howitt came back; and the committee
who had before decided to send four men and
sixteen horses, increased the patty to eight
men, and he (Dr. Macadam) thought as many
as thirty-seven horses, so that they might
carry on provisions to Cooper?s Creek. Even
under this arrangement Mr. Howitt managed
to get aWay by the 4th July, with Mr. Brahe.
On the 24th June, too, a proposal was made to
apply to the Government to send the steamer
Victoria round to the Gulf of Carpentaria.
The Chairman.? Mr.Burke applied theword
? false ? to some passages in Mr. Landell?s des-
patch. Did the committee gite any instruc-
tions of which Mr. Burke knew nothing ?
Dr. Macadam replied that Mr. Landells re-
ceived no private instructions whatever.
The Chairman intimated to Dr. Macadam
that this was all the information which they
required from him at present. He requested
Mr. Brahe to reply to a few questions.
In reply to different queries put by the dif-
ferent members of the commission?
Mr. Brahe said that he had held no par-
ticular position in the Expedition when it
started, being only one of the ordinary men
engaged. He had never before been in any
exploring expedition, but since he came into
the colony, in 1852, he had always been in the
bush, principally in the neighborhood of Beech-
worth. As for the difficulties experienced in
overloading the waggons, the roads were found
to be very heavy on the other side of the
Murray. Some stores and some bars of iron
were left behind at Swan Hill, and a quantity
of rice, sugar, rifles, and revolvers at Bellerano.
He did not know if the rice and sugar were
left behind because they could not be carried,
or because they were not wanted. The party
got to the Darling with the greater part of the
stores. A quantity of stores were left at Phelp?s
station, ninety miles below Menindie. In fact
the chief part of the provisions required got to
Menindie, and there was abundance for every-
body. He (Mr. Brahe) remained at Menindie
before starting with Burke. He was one of
the advanced party with Burke. He under-
stood that at the time Burke started there
were six months? provisions. Having described
in detail the different persons forming the
parties, Mr. Brahe proceeded to say that Toro-
woto was 200 miles from the Darling. Mr.
Wright went back with the horses and two
blacks; and he (Mr. Brahe) went forward with
Burke and Wills, under the guidance of some
other blacks, to Cooper?s Creek. There was no
difficulty in getting from Torowoto to Cooper?s
Creek, for there was abundance of water,
though it was fast drying up. There was no
suffering for want of it. They arrived at
Cooper?s Creek on 11th November, and their
first camp on the creek was Camp 57. They
arrived safely and in good condition, except
with respect to the horses and camels, who were
knocked up. They remained at the first camp
two days, at the second two days, and at the
third two days; and each day Wills went on


tracing the course of the creek. They re- i
mained at Camp 63 for a fortnight, during
which time Wills was exploring the country,
and Burke went out once with him, and once .
with himself (Brahe). Burke and himself went
about twenty-five miles in a straight direction,
but could go no further because they could
find no water. Wills went out ninety miles
once, and lost three camels, returning on foot.
He did not appear much weakened by his jour-
ney when he returned; but M'Donogh, who
was with him, was very much cut up. The
party remained three days after that. Wills
went out a second time, with King and two
camels, to bring back those which had been
left behind ninety miles off. The lost camels
were never heard of, though he (Brahe) be-
lieved them to have been found in Adelaide.
Burke went down with the party to the last
depot, and remained five or six days after
Wills?s return from his second journey. They
killed two horses, and jerked the meat. He
(Brahe) had some idea as to what provisions
were in store, for on the day of starting Burke
had asked him to make out a list of them. He
had done so, and thought the stores left were
sufficient for twenty-four weeks. He handed
the store-book to Mr. Hodgkinson, who was
storekeeper to the party. All the stores taken
from the Darling were entered in some book.
There was enough for twenty-four weeks, after
Burke had taken away what he wanted. Burke
intended to go from Coopers Creek to Eyres
Creek, and from thence to the Gulf, if he could
do so without, as he said, running any risk.
Sir Feancis McEPHY.?Did he write any-
thing then? ,
Mr. Bbahb continued to say that the only
thing Burke wrote was the despatch he (Brahe)
had delivered in Melbourne. He gave him
(Brahe) a parcel of pocket-books, made him seal
them in his presence, and made him promise to
throw them into the water if he did not return
from Eyre's Creek. He (Brahe) said he would
burn them, and he did burn them, in the pre-
sence of M?Donough. Burke said he would run
no risk, but be back in three months? time.
The provisions he took were barely enough for
twelve weeks, and he knew that as well as
anybody. On the morning before he went he
called all round him, and said that if he found
any difficulty, or had to run any risk, he would
return in a month?s time. He (Brahe) did not
know that Burke wrote any memorandum of
the day?s proceeding. All slept in the open
air, with rugs. He had seen Burke writing
something once or twice. Wills was always
writing something every night, and sometimes
had his book in his hand nearly the whole of
the day. It was by no means a constant prac-
tice of Burke to write. The men had no exact
several duties assigned to them. Some attend-
ed to the camels, and some to the horses.
Some one was cook, and he was assisted by
the rest in carrying fire and water. Burke
gave him (Brahe) no written instructions what-
ever when he left Cooper?s Creek, except the
despatch brought down, and the books sealed
up, and afterwards burnt. Wills left three
books with him. Burke started with three
men, beside himself, six camels, and one horse.
The provisions were packed on the camels.
He believed Burke took the horse for the sake
of the meat. Burke started to the westward
of Wills?s ninety miles?journey. They all went
with Burke to his first camp. His last direc-
tions were, to follow with the despatch within
two days, if Wright arrived, and he expected
Wright to arrive within two days. Burke had
said that he expected Wright with a quantity
of dried meat, and that Wright would explore
the country between the Darling and Cooper s
Creek. Mr. Brahe proceeded to say,?l was on
the look out for Wright, but never tried to
find out what became of him, because I could
not leave the depot. A large quantity of na-
tives were about, and the horses and camels
had to be closely looked after in the narrow
strip of country where there was feed. Stony
rises were on both sides of the depot. I never
came down the track to the Darling to look
for Wright, because I should have had to be
away for some eight days, and no one could
leave the camp on account of the natives, i
could not be spared. I could not go along
Burke?s track either, except for ten miles.
I did not like to leave the depot for a
single night. We did not exactly live in
constant dread of the natives, but we could
never tell when we were near them, ihey
once stole a saddle from one of the tents
while three of us were in the camp. 1 was not
away for a quarter of an hour when I found a
saddle gone. No native had been seen, but we
found his tracks, and we followed them up.
When we went down with Burke, the country
improved very much. There was more sand,
and a little herbage. We had come across
natives when we first came to the lower depot
at Cooper?s Creek, and once before when we
were with Burke, and once we passed a camp
of some seventy or eighty natives. Burke
anticipated that they would be very trouble-
some, and told me that, if they annoyed me at
all, I was to shoot them at once, I heard that
Wright had expected me back at the Darling,
with the horses and camels. He said Burke
had told him that I should be sent on to meet
them. Scarcity of water, he said, had delayed
him. About Mr. Hodgkinson he only said that
gentleman had been sent down to
and a great deal of time had been lost. 1 had
made up my mind to leave Cooper s Creek on
account of the sickness of one of my men, and
my waiting any longer could be of no service
to Mr. Burke. I was so enabled to leavea
small quantity of provisions, which I should
have consumed had I remained longer. 1 did
not think it possible that Burke would return.
I did not think anything had happened to
him, but made sure I should hear ot bun
when I got to Menindie. I thought he had
made Queensland two months after leaving
Cooper?s Creek. I had spoken to him about
i going to Queensland some three or four times
before he left Cooper?s Creek. Certainly he
: had no notion of going there; but on the day
of his departure he said to me, If lam not
i back in three months? time you may consider
;me perished,? ?or,? I said, on the w T ay to


Queensland,? and he said, ?Just so.? I had I
afterwards thought it likely that he would go
to Queensland. I felt sure he had gone, and
told my companions and Wright so. I took
seven or eight weeks? provisions with me to
the Darling, for I expected I should be de-
layed fully that time on account of Paton,
who had been thrown from his horse. Paton
was very stiff, and becoming rapidly more and
more lame, though he never complained.
M'Donough Complained. He had been kicked
?by a camel, and laid up for some days. I my-
self had pains in the legs and gums, but did
not suspect what was the matter with us all.
I did not understand Paton?s leg at all. Dost
Mahommed was neither ill nor complaining.
We fed then on rice, flour, and biscuit. We
only got a few fish. We could only catch
them by baling out waterholes. There were
abundance of fish, but none of us understood
how to catch them. When I was with Mr.
Howitt we caught several large ones of three
pounds or four pounds? weight; but before that
I had never seen any more than six inches
long. We employed our time in looking after
our animals. There were a few wild fowls,
and a good number of ducks, but we soon got
careless about them. We lost our appetite,
and very little food did for us. The sepoy used
to be very fond of shooting, but not after
Burke?s departure. We did not understand
anything about the nardoo. If I had thought
Burke would have come back, I would have
left something niore than the piece of paper I
buried with the provisions. I would have left
a note explaining my conduct. I put the
stores into a large chest, and buried it eighteen
inches deep, close by a tree outside the stock-
ade we had made of saplings and small tim-
ber. I marked that tree and another with
? B? and ? A, 10th December, 1860,? and ? 21st
April, 1861.? I covered the chest up carefully,
and laid some horse-dung over it. The place
was just where Burke was in the habit of keep-
ing the horse tied up. I left a rake that I had
made in the tree. I believe I put it there when
I left the creek, but I am not sure. I left also
a piece of leather off one of the saddles, and
when I found it again I pointed it out to
Wright, and said I wondered that the savages
had not taken it. He said it was of no good
to them. There were no natives present when
I deposited the chest, but they had been about
S9me days previous. They threw no spears
either at ourselves or cattle. I have no expe-
rience with blacks, nor had any of those with
me. I knew a little of them at Port Fairy.
When we left the creek it was 10 a.m., and we
got fourteen miles that day, going at a very
slow pace, as two of the camels could not
travel. They were lightly packed, as Paton
so often wanted to be moved. He was unable
to sit, and had to be strapped on with a horse-
girth. He was eighteen days lying in one
position. I thought that the camels had had
the scab before it broke out, but the sepoy
always said they were well enough. We went
fourteen miles the first day, and twehty-seven
the next. There was a great level country all
about there. From Cooper?s Creek to Bulla
the country was without water, except in re-
spect to one small pool, just enough for the
men, which I found ten miles from Cooper?s
Creek.
After a few more unimportant answers had
been given, Mr. Brahe concluded his evidence.
Some conversation ensued with respect to
Mr. Wright, and at length
Sir F. Murphy moved that a letter be sent
to the Governor, showing the necessity of ob-
taining the presence of Mr. Wright as a wit-
ness, and asking that communications may
be opened with the South Australian Govern-
ment for the purpose of getting his attendance
before the commission.
The motion was carried, and after a little
desultory conversation about other witnesses,
the meeting adjourned till noon the following
day.
THIRD MEETING.
The commission held its third meeting on
Thursday, November 28, at noon, in the large
chamber adjoining the Legislative Council
Chambers. All the members were present
except Mr. Sturt, who, however, took his
seat when the proceedings were nearly half
over.
On the admission of the representatives of
the press,
Mr. Brahe said he wished to correct an
error into which one of the newspapers had
fallen. It had been stated that he had had
charge of the provisions. Such was not the
fact. He had been only asked by Mr. Burke
to make out a list of them.
The Chairman informed Mr. Brahe that the
evidence was being taken down at length by
the Government shorthand-writer.
Sir Francis Murphy said he wished to
take Mr. Brahe back to the time he left
Cooper?s Creek. In his last note, left in the
cache for Mr. Burke, he had written as fol-
lows :
?Two of my companions and myself are
quite well; the third ?Paton ?has been unable
to walk for the last eighteen days, as his leg
has been severely hurt when thrown by one
of the horses. No person has been up here
from the Darling.
? We have six camels and twelve horses, in
good working order.
?William Brahe.?
Was this quite accurate ?
Mr. Brahe. ?It is to a certain extent, but it
was written in a careless way. As I said yes-
terday, I did not expect that Mr. Burke would
ever see it, and I left it for any party that
might come in from the Darling, or who
might be sent on to ascertain what had taken
place. By that note they would know what
had become of the dep6t party. I did not
think it would be of any consequence to say
what was the exact state of our health. Both
M'Donough and myself and Botan (the sepoy)
were able to work. It would be an untruth
to say the camels were in good condition when
we left Cooper?s Creek. The doctor?s state-
ment would show our real condition. In fact j


it was not true either that We were well or I
that we had six camels and twelve horses in c
good wot king condition* The camels had not *
been worked for eighteen weeks, but the sepoy
said they were able to go on. I knew that the *
camels were sick, but not that they Were
scabby till the day I left the depSt. I kept a <
note-book. Before I left, Paton had been '
getting worse, and began to feel alarming
symptoms of some disease. When I wrote the
note I did not wish to give any uneasiness to
E arsons coming to the creek, or else it would
ave been thought that we could never reach
the Darling.
Sir Francis Murphy.?Do you not see the
difficulty in which you placed Mr. Burke? If
he had known that you were ill, and not able
to make fast progress, he might have attempted
to follow you. , ~ _ .
Mr. Brahe?l made sure that Mr. Burke
would not return. The rations were not given
out daily or weekly. A certain quantity of
rice was boiled in the morning for breakfast.
That was measured, so that there should be
just sufficient for the four of us. We used to
eat it with sugar. At dinner time we had
damper and tea, and jf we had salt pork or
beef, we used to eat it. We each had two
biscuits for tea.
Sir Francis Murphy said he asked these
questions because of the statement made in
Wills?s last letter, that the party left behind
had provisions enough to last them, with
economy, for twelve months.
Mr. Brahe. ?I stated yesterday that we took
six months? provisions to the Darling. I see,
by Mr. Hodgkinson?s statement, that we were
said to have taken twenty-four weeks? pro-
vision for six men, but since then Wright and
two blacks joined the party. (Here Mr. Brahe
quoted passages from Mr. Hodgkinson s state-
ment in reply to His Excellency?s questions
put at the meeting of the Exploration Com-
mittee, which was summoned when Mr.
Hodgkinson came to Melbourne from Memn-
die.) Ido not think the statement that we
had twelve months? provisions could be true,
unless we were disposed to kill our horses and
camels, and feed on them. I had no instruc-
tions to do that.
Sir Francis Murphy.? Had not your party
special instructions not to leave Cooper?s Creek
unless they were compelled to leave from ne-
cessity.
Mr. Brahe.? Mr. Burke never left the in-
structions, and I don?t believe that Mr Wills
expected as much. On our way forward, after
leaving Cooper?s Creek with Burke and Wills,
Wills asked me to remain four months if pos-
sible. He would not have asked that if Burke
had given those instructions.
Sir Francis Murphy.? Did it not strike
you not to leave unless from absolute neces-
sity?
Mr. Brahe.?Certainly not.
Sir Francis Murphy. ?Did you conceive
that you were leaving from absolute neces-
sity ?
? Mr. Brahe. ? I can?t say absolute necessity.
Burke said that after three months we should
have no reason to expect him, and no more I
did. If we had stopped longer we should have
used uo the other provisions, and left nothing
behind us buried. If we had remained a fort-
night longer, we could have buried nothing,
Paton was evidently getting worse. M Don-
ough?s leg Was getting Worse, and I was getting
The Secretary then tead a lettet which
had just been handed in by Dr. Macadam. It
was from Dr. Beckler, and had regard to the
state of the party at the time they came up to
Wright?s party. It was as follows :
? Junction of the Murray and Darling Rivers,
Nov. 20,1861.
?To the hon. Secretary of the Exploration
Committee.
? Sir,?The weekly impression of The Argun
newspaper of the 15th instant is so full of
accusations against a late officer of the Vic-
torian Exploring Expedition, that I think it
simply my duty to send you the enclosed
statement referring to the state of health of
the Cooper?s Creek part# at the time of their
arrival at Bulla. The state of Paton is fu Ily
described in my official report, which can be
referred to at any time. Mr. Brahe himse.i
was slightly affected with scurvy, yet he was
so altered that in the morning we had iden-
tified his horses I did not recognize him.
When he came up to our camp at Bulla, Botan
had similar slight symptoms of scurvy, but
M?Donough was suffering much more than
either Mr, Brahe or Botan, and it was
chiefly his left knee, which became, notwith-
standing immediate attendance, worse and
worse, so that he was unable to do anything
from the third day after our arrival at Koor-
lialto Creek, and he remained so up to the
, time of our departure from that place, three
. weeks after our arrival there. During this
, time, Botan also was getting gradually worse,
. and he was from the time of our departure
from Poria Creek to our arrival at the Darling
1 unable to work. Smith was exceedingly weak,
3 and unable to do anything while at Koorlialto
Creek, and so was Belootch. Mr. Brahe left
i with Mr. Wright for Cooper?s Creek a few days
- after our arrival at Koorlialto Creek,
only remedies he had with him, and both ot
ir which he used regularly, and in measured
i quantities, were alum and citric acid. Viter
. his return to camp he felt quite well 1 fully
believe that if Mr. Brahe had not left Cooper s
. Creek at the time he did, or a very few days
s after, he would have been unable to proceed
r with his small party towards Bulla. With
, regard to Mr. Brahe?s services during the Ex-
,l pedition, lam sure that I only state what any
e one of us would corroborate unhesitatingly,
that nobody could be more zealous, active, and
e conscientious than himself, and that no one
3- could have a stronger attachment to Mr.
Burke, and a more strict adherence to his
orders. The instructions which were given to
?e him by Mr. Burke he repeated to us so often
3- that there could not have been the slightest
misunderstanding or want of management.
7 As to the imposing appearance of our cavalcade,
d mentioned in Mr. Wright?s report, and referred


to by one of the correspondents of The Argus ,
I have still the fresh impression of it. It was
nothing more than shining misery. Smith
and M'Donough had to be helped on their
horses. Belootch had constructed for himself
a seat in which he could comfortably rest in a
reclining position whilst riding, and poor
Paton was lying helpless in his litter, to which
he had still to be secured. His transport alone
required the continued attendance of Mr.
Hodgkinson and myself. Of the six camels
which came from Cooper?s Creek, all were
suffering from a loathsome degree of scab, and
two of them died a short time after the party
had joined us?one at Poria Creek, and the
other a few days afterwards on the journey.
? I have the honour to be, Sir,
? Your most obedient servant,
?De. Heeman Becklee.?
The Chaxeman.?Had you no clothes which
you could have left behind ?
Mr. Beahe. ?Yes; I had a parcel left with
me by Wills. That was all I knew of. I
brought them back with me. We were very
badly off.
The Chaieman. ?Why did you not leave
them behind ?
Mr. Beahe. ?I thought they would return
as well provided as we were. The clothes
were mostly shirts, not warm clothing. There
were some shoes. When Wright and I re-
turned to Cooper?s Creek, we did not remain
above a quarter of an hour. I tied up my
horse near the cache, and went into the stock-
ade. I examined all the trees. I saw the
camels? tracks, and supposed them to have
been our own. I saw no tracks of human
feet ?it was impossible to see any. There had
been a lot of rats there, and the place was
very dusty. I am bushman enough to follow
the tracks of horses or camels. There is a
good deal of difference between the tracks of
white men and natives. Of course, if the
white men were barefooted, I could not have
seen the difference. If I had thought there
were white men?s tracks, I should have
opened the cache. I thought natives had been
there on account of the three different fire-
places; but I saw no native tracks. As
Wright had not been to Cooper?s Creek, and
the men were in the doctor?s hands, I thought
a little rest would do them good, and the
best way to spend the time would be to go
back to Cooper?s Creek. I had still suspicion
that Burke might have been there in our ab-
sence, and I wanted to give Burke a last
chance. The season had been dry for a long
time. I left Cooper's Creek, on April 21. I
had expected rain for some weeks, but thought
it would have rained down the country first,
rather than at Cooj>er?s Creek The rainy
season extends sometimes to the end of Jan-
uary, and I thought we should reach the
Darling safely as far as that was concerned.
The natives told me we should be flooded
out, and that the rains came sometimes in
the middle of summer. It seems there were
very heavy rains there in September last.
The Chaieman asked if Mr. Brahe could
account for the statement made in Wills?s
letter, which he read over to all his party, in
order that it should be correct ?
Mr. Beahe. ?I cannot understand it. Ido
not know what reason Wills could have had
for writing that, after Burke had given orders
for us to remain three months, and Wills had
asked me to stop four months.
Sib Feancis Murphy.?Did Wright give
any reason for not coming up before ?
Mr. Beahe?l told him Burke had ex-
pected that he (Wright) would leave the
Darling on November 15; and that Burke had,
moreover, expected him to arrive at Cooper's
Creek before he (Burke) left it, Wright said
it would have been impossible for him to
leave then; for when he returned to Menindie
he found Lyons waiting for despatches, and
gave him the horses he had brought down
from Torowoto, and sent him off to Burke
I am not sure whether Wright gave this last as
a reason or not. He said he expected some of
the party would return with Lyons, bringing
horses and camels to assist him. He said he
expected me back on the Darling a long time
before; and that is not unlikely, because I
was told by Burke two days after I left Menin-
die that I was to go back to the Darling, with
horses and camels, to fetch up the other party.
At that time Wright was not one of the party
but only a guide. At Torowoto Burke en-
gaged him. After Wright?s departure Burke
told me that Wright would be coming up with
me to the Darling. Until we arrived at Cooper?s
Creek, I expected to go to the Darling, when
Burke said, ?You will not go back to the
Darling, you shall go on with me.? I don?t
know what quantity of provisions Wright
had.
The Hon. Mr. Heevey.?When you went
back with Wright to Cooper?s Creek, could
you not have left some more provisions in the
cache.
Mr. Beahe. ?Yes; I believe we could. We
could have taken them from Bulla, but it
never struck me or Wright to do so. We only
just took enough for ourselves on the journey,
because we had to go through a long strip of
waterless country. We took ten days? pro-
visions with us, and returned on the 11th. I
was under Wright?s orders at the time. We
made no search beyond the depot, but only
remained a short time. The night before we
had camped four miles off, and started to the
depot early in the morning, so as to return the
same night.
The Chaieman. ?You found the rake where
you left it ?
Mr. Beahe. ?I believe I placed it on the
cache, against the tree, and I found it there
when I returned. When I was with Burke I
saw a number of natives a considerable dis-
tance from the place of the cache, but I never
saw any that could have seen us make it.
The Hon. Mr. Heevey?Did any of your
party wish to go to the Darling ?
Mr. Beahe?Yes, Paton was very anxious
to get assistance, but no one else. We had a
quantity of seeds to plant, but did not take
them to Cooper?s Creek. All of them were left
behind at the Darling.

iSttoldSrte wS Surki in conversation with Burke at the Dar-


ling about clothes, I heard him say that he
expected a vessel at the Gulf of Carpentaria to
meet him. I heard Professor Neumayer say
then, ? I hope to be the first to meet you in
the vessel.? On another occasion, when
Burke was packing up his clothes at Cooper?s
Creek, he was very short. He was always
giving a shirt or something to the natives
when they did anything for him. 1 gave him
then two flannel shirts that had. been express-
ly made for me, and he said, ? I don?t care,
M Donough, if I get on board the vessel with
only a shirt on me.? Afterwards 1 thought
he did not expect the vessel. The general
impression when we left Melbourne was that
a vessel would be sent round, but I never
heard as much stated in the party. When I
spoke to Brahe about it he always contradicted
it.
The Chairman.?You see he never expected
a vessel, because he never looked for one when
he got to the sea.
Mr. M'Donough.?Mr. Brahe said that Pro-
fessor Neumayer had said nothing to him. I
had many conversations with Wright as to
Burke. He gave Burke up for lost. He said,
The man rushed madly on, depending on
surface water. He was never able to go on or
come back, and he and his men are lost in the
desert.? No provisions were given away to the
natives except a few biscuits, and not two
dozen altogether. Unless Wills meant that we
were to eat our horses and cattle, he could
never have thought we had twelve months?
provisions. The blacks at Cooper?s Creek never
alarmed me much. I saw them the first time
they came. The sepoy came in trembling and
excited, saying the blacks were outside. I
went out, and there were about fifty of them.
Phey tried to feel my ribs, and I heaved one
of them down and fired my revolver in the
air. The blacks then ran away about 100 yards.
I never feared them, beceuse I knew they were
so cowardly, and that a shot would disperse
them. I was always able to defend myself till
I came under Dr. Beckler?s treatment. Burke
told me he should explore the country towards
Eyre s Creek, but not run any great risks. I
know some of Burke?s family and that was
why he was so confidential with me. Often
since he has been in the colony has he told
me many things. When I came to Bulla I was
scarcely able to walk, for during three days
and three nights we had to look so close
alter the camels that I had only two hours
sleep each night. My gums at that time were
quite soft, and two of my teeth were knocked out
by a blow from a horse. When we joined
Wright they were camped in the most wretch-
ed state, everything and everybody being
in the greatest disorder The remark was
made how could we get along so orderly; and
Wright abused his men for it, saying:?? Look
at those men (pointing to us), see how they
have got on, while hardly able to work.?
Smith and Beelooch (the other sepoy) were
down through illness. Dr. Becker died the
day after we came. Purcell had died before
we came up When we joined W right, Brahe,
Hodgkinson, Beckler, and Dost Mahommed
w re the only ones able to work. Altogether,
before we came they were not able to keep
watch at night. We were two days at Bulla,
till Dr. Becker was hurried. This was at the
time when Wright described the cavalcade as
having an imposing appearance. When we
were one stage further on our way to the Dar-
ling, Wright and Brahe went on to Cooper?s
Creek, I took a note of the quantity of pro-
visions we had then, and handed the list to
akinson. As far as 1 can recollect, there was
. or 8001b. of dour and a couple of bags of
rice or more. Flour had been given to the sick
camels. There was besides some warm cloth-
ing and fiannels not made up, seven or eight
hands of bacon, and a great deal of sugar,
some tea, but very little coffee. Wright never
spoke about sending any clothes to Cooper?s
Creek ; in fact, he spoke very little to us at all.
My opinion was, that his object was to go to
see Cooper's Creek, but not to relieve Burke.
That is the impression I got from his conver-
sation. I should think 61b. of dour would do
for a man for a week, and there were eight of
us. That would last fourteen or fifteen weeks.
There were about 1601b. or 2001b. of rice and
about 31b. of rice would have gone with the
rations of dour, but the men could have lived
very well on the 51b. of dour. The jerked beef
they had when we joined them would only
have lasted about six weeks more. I cannot
account for the sickness in Wright?s party
except by the hot climate and scurvy. We
brought back plenty of preserved vegetables,
some French beans, but no bottled picSfes. We
used citric acid as long as it lasted, mixing it
with the water and sugar to take away the bad
taste of the iron. The disorderly state of the
party was laid by Wright to the men?s negli-
gence in not preserving pairs of leather straps,
ropes, and girths, that would have been very
serviceable. They never attributed it to the
lateness of the season. Wright told me that
he had stopped so long, because he wished to
bave his appointment confirmed by the com-
mittee, and for money to get horses in place
of those Macpherson had knocked up. I heard
Mr. Hodgkinson say he was very anxious to
get on after Burke. I heard no men blaming
Wright for not pushing on. Burke stopped at
Cooper?s Creek because he wanted to explore
the route to the north to see if there was an
available route more to the north-east of
Sturt?s track of 1845. On that occasion Wills
and I took three camels, and he instructed
me to take stores for four weeks. Accordingly
Wills and myself started. We were gone be-
tween two or three days, when Wills calculated
that we had gone 100 miles. We then returned
about ten miles. Wills saw smoke to theN.E ,
rising, as he thought, over the range. He said,
? we will go and see what is over there. It ap-
pears to me as if the blacks h Q ve been camping
there, and that there is water to be found.?
We came to our camp as the moon was rising,
and Wills went to take an observation. I went
to the camels, they were some of Coppins?s
camels, and were very much done up. We had
some water in our bags, but they were leaking.
When he had taken his observations Wills re


turned to cook some supper. We sat down to
some supper, and in half an hour I noticed
the camels going towards the scrub. We
had just camped outside the scrub. We
brought them back to within thirty yards of
the camp. We could not hobble them, for the
hobbles were left behind at Cooper?s Creek.
We had finished supper in about ten minutes.
It was pretty dark. I went to look for the ca-
mels, but could not find them. We searched
till twelve o?clock, but could find no trace. We
then had a few hours? sleep. When we got up,
Wills told me to make some johnny-cakes, so
that we might walk back, or else we should
be lost. We went to a rise about seven miles
off to see if the camels were in the valley.
Wills looked through his opera glasses, but
could see no trace. We followed one camel?s
track towards the valley for about a mile,
and after that made up our swags to walk to
Cooper?s Creek. We did not like to light a fire,
for fear of the blacks. In about seven or eight
miles we found a pool of stagnant water. We
walked for eight hours, and then rested for
four hours, till we got to Cooper?s Creek. I
never saw the natives use the stores. We made
a boundary line, and told them not to come
further. I think the Expedition would have
been helped if we had had a strong spring-cart
and a strong horse. Neither waggons nor
bullocks would have answered our purpose.
The Chairman then intimated to Mr. M?Do-
nough that there were no more questions to
put.
Mr. M?Donough : I wish to remark about
Dr. Beckler?s treatment of myself and Paton.
When we got under his charge, I was quite
able to walk. In fact it was Hodgkinson and
myself who put up all the three tents. After
Wright and Brahe had gone to the stockade,
we cut wood for the stockade, and for what-
ever purposes it was required. Then Dr.
Beckler told me to lie up, and treated me for
my knee. Consequently I was laid up for
about six days or a week, during which time
lie tried four different modes of treatment.
At one time he used lotions, at another time
warm water, and at another time cold water.
When he told me to take some exercise, I
found the sinews of my legs all shrunk in. As
for Paton, he was for four or five weeks depend-
ing on a pint of arrowroot morning and
evening. Dr. Beckler had some tins of fresh
mutton, but Paton had hardly any of them,
for Wright and the other party used them a
few days before we got to the Darling. Dr.
Beckler said Paton died of scurvy, but as far
as I could see it was starvation. Mr. M?Do-
nough then proceeded to say that he had seen
in The Argus report that Mr. Brahe had said
that he (M'Donough) had complained, while
Paton did not. He wished that corrected,
Mr. Sturt explained that Mr. Brahe had
subsequently corrected himself.
The next witness was Mr. Edward Wecker,
storekeeper to Captain Cadell.
In answer to questions,
Mr. Wecker said he had been living at
Menindie for fifteen or eighteen months past.
He believed no one in the exploring party knew
how much stores they had there. From what
he heard, he thought Mr. Wright took up six
months? provisions for his party. After they
had gone there was left at Menindie more than
half a ton of flour, some sugar, camels? shoes,
water bags, camel trunks, drapery, and medi-
cine chests.
The Chairman.? Do you know why Wright
stayed so long at Menindie ?
Mr. Weckeb said he believed it was because
Mr. Wright was waiting for the confirmation
of his appointment, which had been sent down
from Menindie. The despatch left Menindie
on December 4.
Several questions were next put to Mr.
Wecker to ascertain whether he must not
have been mistaken in supposing that any
despatch left Menindie at the date named.
Mr. Weckeb said he had been postmaster,
and was quite sure. There was a general won-
der at Menindie why Wright did not start,
but Wright always said he was waiting for
the confirmation of his appointment. Before
Mr. Hodgkinson came down, the committee
were in great discredit, and Mr. Wright wanted
something on which he could fall back.
Cheques which Burke had drawn on the Na-
tional bank for small amounts ?for �1 or 30s.
?were dishonored. The other gentlemen of
the party refused to allow Mr. Wright?s con-
trol till his appointment was ratified. He (Mr.
Wecker) knew of several cheques which had
been dishonored. He had seen the mode of
curing beef which had been adopted. It was
cut in strings and hung from tree to tree,
and in his opinion had been cut in too thick
slices, and not covered at night, which had
caused it to be bad. Plenty of provisions
could be got at the Darling. There were
five or six tons of flour, and five or
six tons of sugar in his store, and also
vegetables. Besides the steamer had about
twenty tons of flour more. It was not a fact
that the smallness of the cheques caused them
to be dishonored, because some of the larger
ones were refused. It did not happen in the
case of the cheques which he took, because
he sent them to town through Wentworth?s.
Dr. Macadam said the cheques must have
been dishonored only through a mistake in
not sending notice of them to Dr. Wilkie,
the treasurer. The arrangement of the cheques
was changed at one time, and during the
transition from one system to another some
cheques were dishonored by mistake, for there
was plenty of money at the time.
Mr. M?Donough said that Tom Paine, a
storekeeper and publican, was always ready
to give credit to the committee, and take
cheques.
In answer to further questions,
Mr. Wecker said he thought all this had
interfered with the start of the party. Wright
was well acquainted with the country to Toro-
woto, having been there before. During the
month he was living at Baker?s station, but
he had no employment there, as the station
had been sold to a Mr. M'Gregor. He was
only permitted to remain as a favor. Wright
got the confirmation of his appointment on


January 11th, but he did not start until the
29th, because he had to wait for the return
of Dr. Becker and Dr. Beckler. He had also
to purchase horses, but that need not have
taken him more than half a day. He (Mr.
Wecker) thought the delay till January 29
perfectly necessary.
Dr. Macadam said he had just received a
telegram from Mr. Wright, in which that
gentleman offered to come to Melbourne, and
give evidence before the commission for �lOO,
which wouldJpay his expenses and compensate
him for loss of employment in taking a quan-
tity of sheep a long way up the country.
After some conversation,
Dr. Macadam informed the commission that
the letter alluded to by Mr. Wecker had been,
found. It had been received in Melbourne on
3rd December. Dr. Macadam read a quota-
tion from the letter, and proceeded to say
that the committee expected that Mr. Wright
would unquestionably have left immediately
after he returned from Torowoto. No reply
therefore was sent, because it was expected
such would not reach him,
Mr. Sullivan said the commission would
be glad to take the evidence of anybody who
would come forward to give it.
The Chairman then announced that the
commission would adjourn till twelve o?clock
on the following Thursday.
FOURTH MEETING.
The commission held its fourth sitting on
Thursday, December 6, in one of the committee-
rooms of the Legislative Council. The whole
of the members, except Mr. Sturt, were pre-
sent. The room was crowded.
The first witness examined was King, the
sole survivor of the Expedition.
In answer to questions, which were mostly
put by Sir Francis Murphy,
William King said : ?I am one of the ori-
ginal party who started from Melbourne with
Messrs. Burke* and Wills to the Darling. I
was not placed in charge of any particular
portion of the Expedition till Mr. Landells
left at Menindie. Till then I was an ordinary
man like the rest. I had an oversight of the
stores. We and the stores arrived safely. I
know nothing of any stores left behind any-
where. As far as I can judge, there was any
amount of them, and all except the dry meat
were good. That was damaged. The means
of transport were quite sufficient. The horses
arrived at the Darling before the camels. Mr.
Burke always went in advance of the camels,
leaving Mr. Landells in command of them. I
remained behind with Mr. Landells?s party,
and when Mr. Landells resigned, Mr. Burke
put me in charge of the camels.
The Hon. M. Hervey ?Had you any know-
ledge of camel management ?
Mr. King ?None, except that which I ob-
tained in coming out with Mr. Landells and
the camels from India. I started with Mr.
Burke, Mr. Wills, and a portion of the party
to Cooper?s Creek. The party consisted of
Messrs. Burke, Wills, Brahe, Paton, M'Donough,
Dost Mahomed, and myself. Mr. Wright
joined us at Menindie, and went with us as
far as Torowoto, having with him a couple of
the Darling blacks. At Torowoto Mr. Wright
and the natives left us, and I and the remain-
der of the party went on. I know nothing of
the arrangement made by Mr. Burke with Mr.
Wright at Torowoto. I heard none of the
instructions. When Mr. Wright was about
leaving, Mr. Burke called all the party toge-
ther, and asked the men if they had any desire
to return with Mr. Wright, or if they were
satisfied to proceed. Any man, he said, who
chose to leave, might accompany Mr. Wright
to the Darling. No one took advantage of
this offer, for they were all desirous to go on.
They were quite satisfied with the arrange-
ments. The provisions and transport were
quite sufficient. We were all armed, and each
of us carried a revolver. I heard rumours
among the party that Mr. Wright was ap-
pointed to some charge, but I did not know it
myself. We had no difficulty in getting from
Torowoto to Cooper?s Creek, for there was
water all the way, except on one evening,
when we camped without water. The horses
and camels travelled well, though we had to
leave one of the camels behind some two days
before we reached our first depot on Cooper?s
Creek. I had no conversation with Mr. Burke
as to his intentions, and I don?t know what
they were when we reached the creek, I did
not hear him mention any instructions to Mr.
Wright on the way up. I went on some of the
expeditions round about Cooper?s Creek. Mr.
Wills, Mr. Burke, and M'Donough started one
morning to try and find water at some dis-
tance to the north, but Mr. Burke did not seem
quite well, and returned after going about a
mile, the two others continuing their journey.
When they had been out some days, they lost
their camels through some neglect, and re-
turned to the depot which Mr. Burke had
formed, on foot, A few days after, myself, and
Mr. Burke, and Mr. Wills, went some seventy
miles north, but we did not find water. Mr.
Wills had found water where he and M?Don-
ough had gone before, and we went the same
track. I don?t know how it was, but Mr. Wills
did not seem to recognise the place where he
had found the water. We lost nothing then,
and returned. After a few days, Mr. Wills
and myself went a third time, and found
water about ninety miles to the north. We
had then to bring in the camels? saddles, and
other articles which had been left behind, and
which Mr. Burke wished to take with him
across the continent. Mr. Wills seemed to be
satisfied that we could not make the crossing
in that direction, as there was no vegetation
there. We had got into quite a stony and
level country. There were ranges to the
eastward, about two or three miles off. We
were at the foot of them, on the slope. To
the west was one mass of plains, covered with
stones, where there was very little vegetation,
no trees, animals, or birds There were a few
waterholes, but they were not surface-water,
but filled by water channels coming from the
mountains. The water in them was quite


brackish. The camels we had travelled well
over the stony ground. We took two riding
camels with us, and turned back, because we
could not make our way across then. While
we were away Mr. Burke had shifted to a depot
he had made further down the creek, and had
been making preparations for our start. He
announced to us when we came back that he
intended that a party of four men should
start to go across. I knew before this that I
was to go across with him. He s id nothing
further about the rest of the party. On the
morning we were about to start from the
depot, Mr. Burke called us all together, and
pointed out Brahe as the officer in charge of
the depot till Mr. Wright, who was expected
daily, had arrived. That was the first time I
really heard this, thohgh I had heard as much
rumoured in the camp. I heard him give no
instructions as to what Brahe should do. He
said he expected Mr. Wright to arrive at
Cooper?s Creek in a few days. He then shook
hands with the different men. When he
shook hands with Baton, who was very fond
of him, Baton was shedding tears on account
of his disappointment in not going across
with Mr. Burke. When Mr. Burke shook
hands with Baton, he said, ? You must not
fret. We shall be back in a few months, and
you shall go with us to the Darling.? That
was all I overheard. The party was in excel-
lent health. Brovisions were good and plen-
tiful, except the dry meat. We took a quan-
tity of the dry meat which we had brought
to the Darling to Cooper?s Creek. We killed
a horse at Cooper?s Creek, and just after
we had dried his meat, another broke its
leg, and Mr. Burke shot him, and we
dried his meat too. None of the party
were complaining of illness. The party who
started to cross were Mr. Burke, Mr. Wills,
Gray, and myself, and we took six camels, one
horse, and, I think, twelve weeks? provisions.
A considerable quantity was left behind ?
about twice as much more as we took away.
There were twelve bags of flour, each some
501b. or 521b. weight, and a considerable quan-
tity of sugar left behind. We had brought a
considerable quantity of sugar and oatmeal
from the Darling for the camels, but they re-
ceived very little of it till a few days before
leaving the depot. We took with us 3001b. of
flour, 1101b. of dry meat, some 401b. or 501b. of
sugar, 901b. of pork, 121b. of tea, 51b. of salt,
8 tins of preserved vegetables and meat. We
had no spirits of any kind, and had brought
none from the Darling. The pork was good.
We had plenty of clothing, and took sufficient
from the depot. Mr. Burke took as much as
he thought we required. There was no stint
about it, and we left some behind us. We took
two rifles and two guns, and we each had a
revolver.
The Chairman.? Did you ever hear Mr.
Burke express any expectations of a ship to
meet him at the Gulf of Carpentaria ?
Mr. King. ?No; none of us ever expected it,
The cattle did not appear to be overloaded,
and they all had light loads till we commenced
to carry water. They were able to carry much
more than they did. We had no other reason
for leaving them light than to spare them. In
fact, Mr. Burke did not intend to take with
him more than three months? provisions. If
he had wanted to take more we would have
been able to carry them. 2501b. was the ave-
rage weight carried by each camel. We left
the depot in the charge of Mr. Brahe, who ac-
companied us on our way to the first camp.
When he was about returning I was in charge
of the camels, when he rode over to me and
said, ? Good-bye, King. I don?t expect to see
you in less than four months.? That was on
the evening he left us altogether. We traced
the creek for about two days. We rode as long
as we traced the creek, but after that we
walked. We were two or three days thus
tracing the creek after Brahe left us.
The Chairman?How did you regulate your
daily proceedings ?
Mr. King. ?l had to lead the camels, and
Gray led the horses; Mr. Wills and Mr. Buike
walking ahead.
The Chairman.?Had you any regular ra-
tions ?
Mr. King. ?Yes, Mr. Brahe arranged all that.
The quantity we had was quite sufficient, and
it was composed of all the provisions we had.
We had each, I believe, every day about lib.
of damper, fib. of dried meat, and ilb, of pork;
and every other day Mr. Burke allowed some
11b. or Hlb. of rice to be boiled, and divided
among the four of us. That ration was to
enable the provisions to last three months.
The horse was laden with water when that
had to be carried. We went by compass and
observation. Mr. Wills took observations gene-
rally very regularly. He carried the compass,
and Mr. Burke used to relieve him in steering
when he was tired. They jotted down their
notes each day. Mr. Wills was generally en-
gaged about one hour and a half in jotting
down his surveys after he came into the camp.
Mr. Burke took notes very seldom. He carried
a note book with him, and he noted down
some things sometimes, but not constantly.
We had no tents, but camped out. The camels
were always hobbled. After leaving Cooper?s
Creek we had no difficulty in finding grass for
the camels.
Sir Francis Murphy.?You did not come
across that stony desert again, then ?
Mr. King. ?Yes, we did, some few days after
leaving Cooper?s Creek.
Sir Francis Murphy. ?l suppose that was
a little to the westward ?
Mr. King. ?Yes, the plains were others of
the same character as those we had seen be-
fore, only the stones were not so large. The
plains were barren and stony. We saw no
ranges except a few towards the southward.
The desert was of no great extent, and took
us a day and part of the succeeding day to
cross.
Sir Francis Murphy.? What distance did
you travel when you first started ?
Mr. King. ?Sometimes twelve and some-
times fifteen miles a-day, according to whe-
ther we got to a good halting place. Mr. Burke
was always particular in selecting a good


camp for the animals. Mr. Burke only pre-
ceded us by a short distance.
Sir Francis Murphy?l see that by Christ-
mas day you had got into a fine country.
Mr. King.? The country was all plains.
There was some good grass on it, and at places
a permanent water supply was to be obtained.
Some of the waterholes were seven or eight
miles in length. We halted on Christmas day
off Gray?s Creek. On the 23rd, we came to a
water channel, after travelling by night, and
Mr. Burke thought we should remain there
till morning, and examine the country round
for water. On the following morning, he des-
patched Gray in the direction of some timber
and sandhills, and Gray came back and told
us he had found water. Then Mr. Burke
moved the camp a distance of three miles and
a half, to where the water was, and we halted
there during the remainder of the day. We
started off again next morning. We usually
started at about half-past four or five o?clock
each morning. We always started before
breakfast, only once or twice having breakfast
first. Occasionally we travelled by night. We
did so when travelling over waste country and
stony deserts, but we did not do so when in
good country. We had no great difficulties
except when crossing the stony deserts. We
usually travelled about an hour and a-half,
and then had breakfast, and started afresh
afterwards. In the first part of our journey
we generally halted for dinner, and then made
another start, and camped at about half past
four or five o?clock in the evening. We never
stopped to give the cattle a good spell, but
went on each day more or less. We always
had sufficient water for our own use. The
camels did not seem to require much water.
We gave the horse two bucketsful every day.
We never had any great difficulty in this all
the way across, for we were never pushed for
water. We each had five pints a day for our
allowance. We did not suffer for want of grass
except in the stony deserts. There was no re-
duction in the rations before we got across.
We always carried water lest we should not
find it at night, so that we could always choose
our camping place where we got good feed. I
believe our average allowance of flour was
about 51b. per week, which was quite sufficient
for us. When we were getting quite conve-
nient to the Gulf of Carpentaria?about seven
or eight days? march off ?one of the camels
got into the bed of a creek, and could not get
out. None of the others stopped there, and
they were all in good condition.
The Chairman?Were any of you suffering
then?
Mr. King. ?Gray complained that he suf-
fered from headaches, but there appeared to
be no particular reason for it.
Sir Francis Murphy.? Did not you get any
supplementary provisions ?
Mr. King. ?We got a few ducks, but the
game was very shy. We saw lots of kangaroos,
emus, ducks, and other birds all the way right
through. We had no time to go after them,
but were continually pushing forward. Even
in the stony desert, where we could find no
water, we could see lots of pigeons, crows and
hawks, flying from east to west, so that we
knew there was plenty of water. We contin-
ued pretty much the same all the way till
we came to some high ranges in the north,
where it was difficult to get through.
Sir Francis Murphy.?l see by Mr. Burke?s
journal that he reports having had to push
the camels through some difficult hills. Do
you recollect that?
Mr. King. ?Yes. The morning we struck
Cloncurry Creek we had to descend some 400
feet into the creek. The ranges were very
irregular. The head of the creek was just then
forming. Mr. Wills has not mentioned about
the ranges. I recollect the place mentioned
by Mr. Burke well. When nearing the Gulf,
I did not hear Mr. Burke say he expected
relief either by land or sea, neither was there
such an expectation among the party. Before
Professor Neumayer left us, M?Donough and I
were in the tent next to Burke?s, and
M'Donough heard some conversation between
Professor Neumayer and the others concern-
ing a vessel. Mr. Burke said he did not
require a vesspl, and would not sanction one
being sent. Had he expected any assistance
we should have crossed the Albert River to
the west side, and gone to the sea. It was
quite impossible for us to reach the sea on the
east side, for the country was all under water.
Had we crossed the river we should have had
no difficulty in getting to the sea; but as our
provisions were so exhausted, we did not do
so. Mr. Burke found a rise and fall in the
water to about six or eight inches. The
water was quite salty. I cannot say myself
how much further we should have had to go
to the sea, but at the last we found the water
quite salt.
The Chairman. ?When did you first dis-
cover it ?
Mr. King. ?Mr. Wills had told us two or
three days before we reached the river that we
were in the country that had been struck by
Gregory and other previous explorers. He
showed us the place where he supposed Gre-
gory crossed the river. Mr. Wills I know
considered that we were on the Albert River.
Our provisions were very short when we
started to return. Mr. Burke had no consul-
tation with us as to what we should do, nor
did I hear him say what his plan was. We
took a longer time to cross than we expected,
for Mr. Burke thought we should do it in six
weeks, and we took two months. I often
heard Mr. Burke say we should have no diffi-
culty in meeting buffaloes and wild pigs, but
we only saw emus and kangaroos. We passed
extensive grassy plains before we got to the
Albert. There was very little timber, but
plenty of fresh water in the creeks. There
were ducks and pelicans all about. There
could be no doubt about the rise and fall of
the river, though the country was all inun-
dated. There were some large rocks at the
side of the river, and we could see them
covered when the tide was up, and their tops
again when the tide went down. We never
heard the sound of the sea nor anything sim-


ilar to it. Neither I nor Gray ever saw blacks,
but Mr. Wills and Mr. Burke said they saw a
few further north. We met several lots on
the way across, but no large tribes They
were quite astonished to see us. They fol-
lowed us a certain distance, and then stopped
and looked after us. They all had their
spears, boomerangs, and slings. They had
their slings for stones. I saw them use them
at King?s Creek. They never attempted to
molest us, though they came quite close. They
never tried to steal or hurt us, except at
Cooper?s Creek. Mr. Burke and Mr. Wills
made an effort to see the sea, and Gray and I
remained behind with the five camels, they
taking the horse with them. The camels
were in good condition, but leg-weary. We
remained in camp about three days while Mr.
Burke and Mr. Wills were gone. When they
came back Mr. Burke told us to get
ready for the return start. Mr. Burke said
he had accomplished his task as far as was
necessary; and that though he could not get
a view of the open ocean, he was quite satis-
fied with what he had done. He said they
had gone eighteen miles down the' river, but
they did not keep to its course. I could not
see the river eighteen miles lower down from
where we were. It was all under water,
though not where we camped. It was very
boggy where we were, and it rained while we
were in camp, continual showers coming from
the north, Mr. Burke said nothing about the
party going to Queensland, nor spoke of
going any way but the way we came. We
had no occasion to do so, for we could not
have got a better track. There were some
very small box trees near the camp, and we
cut the letter B in some fifteen trees. Mr.
Burke and Mr. Wills did not say they had
marked any trees where they had gone, and I
should not think they did, because they took
no knives with them. There were lots of
stones and rocks about, but we did not build
any cairns or make any heaps. We made a
small plant and left a note there. We buried
a few things, which we did not think neces-
sary for us. We left a few camels? pads, our
camp oven, and a lot of books. There was a
considerable quantity of books which we
brought to amuse ourselves with, but no one
read them. The camels seemed in good work-
ing order, except that they were leg-weary.
If we could have remained there a short time
they would have returned all safe with us, but
our provisions would not let us. We started
back the next morning after Mr. Burke and
Mr. Wills returned. The weather was very
wet, and the camels were often up to their
knees in mud. For the first few days of our
return we could not travel more than four or
five miles a day, in consequence of the wet.
It was not windy at all. There were some ten
or twelve showers each day, and between
each shower the sun shone out beautifully.
It was not hot. Mr. Wills supposed the
showers to come from the sea, as a northern
wind seemed to bring them from there. This
sort of weather lasted about four days. We
Eicked up the camel we had left behind, and
rought him some short distance. It was Mr.
Wills who found the camel and brought him
to the camp. I saddled him with a light
swag, and brought him some distance; but he
was unable to go far, so I took the saddle off,
and let him go loose. I have no doubt that
he made his way to some of the settled dis-
tricts. We knew that any party sent there
would be sure to pick him up. We did not
kill any game during our stay at the river.
We fished, and caught some few fish there.
Both I and Gray tried for game, but could
not get any except crows and hawks. When
Mr. Burke and Mr. Wills were with us we did
not try.
Sir Francis Murphy.?When did your
provisions fall off ?
Mr. King. ?lmmediately on our return;
our provisions were considerably reduced.
Our allowance was made much shorter. When
we were about twelve days? march from
Cooper?s Creek, after we had crossed the
ranges, our provisions were very short indeed.
We ate portulac, and killed two of the camels.
Shortly after we started back, Gray began to
suffer and complain. He was the first. He
complained of head-ache, and pains in his
back and legs. There were two of us walking,
and two riding, on our way back. We did so
to save the camels. Mr. Wills did not seem to
be in the least degree affected by short rations.
Gray got gradually worse. As far as Mr. Wills
understood, he tried to doctor him. He gave
him medicine. Mr. Wills said the man?s con'
stitution was gone through drink, as he had
lived in a public-house at Swan Hill. I have
heard since that he had drunk very heavily at
Swan Hill. Mr. Wills had some medicines
with him, and gave Gray what he thought
were remedies. I was the next to complain.
I suffered from pains in my back and legs,
which I attributed to the walking and short
provisions. We were on a quarter of a pound
of flour, ten sticks of dry meat, and as much
portulac as we chose to gather. We had that
daily allowance for a month. We did not
boil the vegetables with the meat, but we
boiled the meat and took the soup. The meat
was dry camel?s flesh. We had no time to
spare the cattle, particularly as we were
coming back. We were in no want of water
nor grass on our return, none of the water
having dried up. The country had not
changed, except that it was rather drier. We
never carried water if we could save the camels ?
At last Gray was unable to travel, and he sat
on a camel for several days previous to his
death. He had pains in his limbs and back,
as before. He did not suffer from dysentery,
nor did any of us.
Sir Francis Murphy said that in Mr. Wills?s
journal there were some remarks about Gray?s
taking some of the provisions without leave.
Did Mr. King know anything of this ?
Mr. Kiijg. ?Yes. It was when we had struck
our old track after crossing the ranges. On
the ranges we could not keep to our old track.
We had only left our camp some two miles
when Mr. Will?s rode back to fetch a ramrod
he had left behind. On his way he saw Gray
sitting under a tree, eating some flour por-
ridge. He questioned him, and asked him if


Mr. Burke had given him permission to do
this. Gray said Mr. Burke had not. He also
said he was suffering from dysentery, and he
took the flour because he thought it was best
for him. Mr. Wills then told, him that if he
said nothing to Mr. Burke about it he (Mr.
Wills) should do so when he returned. Mr.
Wills called to me, and told me the same. He
also told me to try and make Gray acknow-
ledge it to Mr. Burke before he (Mr. Wills) re-
turned, as he knew that if he told Mr. Burke
he would have to suffer more than if he told
him himself. Gray would not do this, and
requested me to do it, as I knew all about it.
I told Mr. Burke that Mr. Wills had found
Gray sitting under a tree some distance from
the camp, eating this porridge. The porridge
was cooked. It was boiled flour. Mr. Burke
called Gray, and asked him what he meant by
stealing the stores, and if he did not receive an
equal share of the daily rations. Of course,
Gray could not deny this. Mr. Burke then
gave him several boxes on the ear with his
open hand, and not a sound thrashing, as
Mr. Wills states. Mr. Wills was at the other
camp at the time, and the affair was all over
when he returned. The blows were given with
the open hand. It might be that Mr. Burke
gave Gray some seven or eight slaps. Mr.
Burke was not at all in the habit of striking.
The party were on very good terms indeed.
They were always very sociable, as much after
this affair as before it. Though Mr. Burke
abused, or rather scolded, Gray at the time,
when the affair was over nothing more was
heard of it.
The Chairman. ?In one portion of the jour-
nals 1 see that it was thought that Gray was
shamming.
Mr. King.? Mr. Wills thought so. We could
not understand Gray?s complaint, and the
other three of us did not suffer at all. In a
little while each of us was suffering, and then
we found it all out. We never thought he
was as ill as he said he was. I think a con-
siderable quantity of flour was used in that
way, as Gray always had charge of the stores,
coming and going, till he was found stealing.
The Hon. Mr. Hervey.? Do you think he
helped himself before ?
Mr. King. ?Yes. I think he helped himself
both ways.
Sir Francis Murphy.? Did Gray get worse
after this ?
Mr. King. ?Not for some time. This affair
occurred more than fifteen days after we had
started on our return.
Mr. Sullivan. ?Were the rations equal to
all parties?to the leaders as well as to the rest
of the men ?
Mr. King. ?Just the same. I will state the
manner in which the provisions were issued.
Mr. Burke used to divide. There were four
plates, and he used to put equal shares in each
plate. He then used to cover the plates with a
handkerchief or towel, and madeusall turn our
faces from them. Each was then to call out a
number, one, two, three, or four, so that no per-
son could expect to get a larger quanity than
the others, There was never any ground for
complaint that one got more than the other,
The quantity gradually became less and less,
till it was all issued, except the dry meat. It
was not before that Gray died; he died the day
before we struck Cooper?s Creek?some fifteen
miles from it. The camels were so reduced
that we could hardly get along. We left all
the things they carried behind, except a spade,
a shovel, a billy, and a few camels? pads. Mr.
Wills buried the instruments where we left
the camel. All the principal camps were
tree-marked ?B.? Certain trees in each
camp were picked out. They were not num-
bered. We had to leave all our blankets and
rugs behind us when we were reduced to two
camels. Gray was carried on one of these
for some seven days.
Sir Francis Murphy.? Did you hear Mr.
Burke say, when he was approaching the
creek, who he was likely to meet ?
Mr. King. ?He expected to find those whom
he had left there, and also the party from
town. I often heard Mr. Burke speak, in
conversations, about the party that was com-
ing up to survey the country convenient to
Cooper?s Creek. He was so sure of assistance
from the party coming up from town, be-
cause, as he said, he had repeated this so often
to the committee. He had no doubt, what-
ever, that he should find a party surveying
the country. It was Mr. Wright?s party he
meant, though he expected a surveyor at the
time as well.
The Chairman.? Did you not hear him say
that he expected that Mr. Brahe would follow
him from Cooper?s Creek as soon as Mr.
Wright came up there?
Mr. King. ? l never heard Mr. Burke say
so; but Brahe told me he expected to follow
us, if Mr. Wright came up in a few days.
Towards the last Gray became so bad that he
could not travel at all. The evening before
his death he travelled over seven miles tied
to a camel, till we camped at Porlinda Swamp.
He got very bad that night and could scarcely
speak. We made him as comfortable as pos-
sible, and remained there with him. On the
following morning we found him dead. He
had said nothing to me that night, or the day
before his death; but a few days before he
requested Mr. Wills to ask Mr. Foster to have
his effects given to his parents. After ho
could not walk he received every attention
we could show him. We found him dead
as soon as we awoke. We remained a day to
bury him, but we were all so extremely weak
that it was as much as we could do to dig his
grave. He was buried in his clothing, and he
had on a pair of flannel trousers, a flannel
shirt with short sleeves, and a wide-a-wake
hat. We left some of the camels? pads at
that camp. We put them, a tin pot, and some
other articles, in a branch of a tree and a
riff ?in a hollow trunk of a tree. It was near
a lake of water. I have read the account of
what Mr. M'Kinlay has discovered. lam al-
most positive that it was the remains of
Gray which he found. I do not know any-
thing about sabre cuts, but it was very likely
there were scars on his head. I feel satisfied
that it was Gray that was found.
Sir Francis Murphy here read a telegram


which had just been received from Adelaide,
in which it was stated that the bodies found
by Mr. M'Kinlay were discovered forty-five
miles W.N.W of Mr. Wills?s grave. Did Mr.
King think the distance agreed with the lo-
cation of Gray?s grave ?
The Hon. M. Hebvey.? That mentions
bodies.
Mr. King said he could account for the
discoveries in no other way. He pro-
ceeded : ?The day before we arrived at
Cooper?s Creek we were allowed to consume
as much provisions as we chose, in expecta-
tation of finding supplies so soon. We had
only 11b. of dry meat when we got there. If
we had found no provisions there, we should
have all died. It was as much as any of us
could do to travel along the side of the
creek. We had been so weak that for ten
days before we had scarcely been able to make
much distance or to walk about. I seemed
to be worse than either Mr. Burke or Mr.
Wills, but after we arrived at the depot, I im-
proved much more than they did. We had
no difficulty in finding the provisions there.
We arrived in the moonlight athalf-past seven
o?clock at night, after having pushed on
thirty miles that day. Mr. Burke rode on one
of the camels, and I and I and Mr. Wills on
the other. We had our revolvers with us,
and had been continually shooting at the prows
and hawks. When we got to the depot Mr.
Burke was a little a-head of Mr. Wills and my-
self. He had often before said, ? I think I can see
their tents ahead,? and made several remarks
like that until we there. When we got
near, he said, ? I suppose they have shifted to
some other part of the creek.? It was Mr.
Wills who first saw the tree-mark, and saw the
things scattered about the stockade. He saw
the words, ? Dig three feet to the north-east,?
or north-west; lam not certain which. When
he saw the date at which they came to the
camp, and the date at which they left, he said
at once, ? They have left here to-day. If they
had shifted to any other part of the creek, they
would not have marked this.? We set to work
digging up the plant. We did not know where
they had gone to, but thought they had left some
instructions. Mr. Burke was too much ex-
cited to do anything, and Mr. Wills and my-
self dug up the plant. I got the bottle there,
and Mr. Burke said, ? Whatever instructions
they have left are in this bottle.? T then open-
ed it.andjmnded it to him. When he had read it,
he informed us that the other party were in
good condition, except Paton, that the animals
were in good working order, and that on ac-
count of no person coming up to them, they
had made a start for Camp 60, taking a course
6.E. for Bulloo. Mr. Burke then said, it was
madness to attempt to follow them, as their
men were in good order, and their camels too.
He said, we could not expect to make forced
marches, and catch them up. Had the latter
said they were in a weak state, as it appeared
they were, we should have tried at anyrate to
overtake them. We remained at the creek a
few days, and Mr. Burke and Mr, Wills had a
consultation as to what was best to be done.
They came to the conclusion that they would try
and make Monnt Hopeless, as that was a shorter
distance than the Darling, especially as it was
a dry season. Myself and Mr. Wills were
eager to proceed up the creek, in consequence
of Brahe stating that he intended to make
Camp6o. We thought Brahe intended to remain
there a few days and give us a chance to over-
take them.
The Hon. M. Hebvey. ?Could the camels
have taken you on ?
Mr. King. ?l believe that after carrying us
the thirty miles they could not have got on
another day. We had forced them that day,
and it was as much as they could stand. We
remained at the creek a few days, but I can?t
say how many; and here I wish to say, that
in my narrative, which I made when I had
very little strength either of mind or body, I
made an incorrect statement in the number
of days we stayed at the creek and spent in
pushing on for Mount Hopeless. The number of
days can, however, be made out from Mr.
Wills?s journal. When we left for Mount
Hopeless, we covered up the plant, to leave it
as much as possible as we had found it. We
only left a few sheets of leather.
Sir Francis Murphy.? Did you see any-
thing of a rake leaning against a tree ?
Mr. King. ?We found it leaning against the
stockade, and when we left it we made it lean
against the marked tree. I was the person
who took it to arrange the dung over the plant
as we had found it. It did not occur to us to
leave any mark. We thought the word ? dig?
would answer the purpose of anybody else, as
it did Brahe?s. We never thought that any-
body would come back and think the place
had been undisturbed. Three or four days
before we arrived at the creek, Mr. Burke
asked me if I wished to accompany him to
town when he left the depot, if there was to be
a permanent depot there. He said he thought
he should get permission to remain a few days
in town for the benefit of his health. Mr.
Wills made me almost the same promise, and
I never heard them express any doubt. They
were quite confident to within half a day of
their arrival. Mr. Burke never referred to any
instructions to Mr, Brahe to leave after a cer-
tain period. The only doubt Mr. Burke seemed
to have was on the day before we struck
Cooper?s Creek. The blacks were surrounding
us, and Mr. Burke said, ?We must be very
cautious in dealing with them, as we don?t
know what they have done at the depot,? He
never thought they had gone away. We found
some 601b. of flour, about 501b, of oatmeal,
201b. of rice, 501b. of dried meat, and about
501b. of sugar. We thought they might have
left more for us, as they had nine months
provisions for themselves without stinting.
They had also been instructed to kill their
horses and camels if they required fresh meat.
We intended to travel down the creek slowly,
as Mr. Burke states in the note book left in
the plant. I think we had enough provisions
to get to Mount Hopeless. Mr. Burke cal-
culated on making the provisions last forty
days.
Sir Francis Murphy.?l suppose you have
nothing to add to the journals sent down ?


Mr. King.?l have nothing to add to that,
except that I gave the dates incorrectly.
The Hon. M. Hervet.?Did you not indulge
yourselves for a few days ?
Mr. King.?We had a certain allowance till
we lost one of the camels, when we had to
make away with some clothing and other ar-
ticles, so as to pack all into one swag. At that
time we consumed all the sugar except 121b.
We intended to trace out the creek, and get
on Gregory?s track. We left no provisions
behind us, but took everything with us.
When we consumed all the sugar but 121b.,
we gave some balls of it to the camel. For a
few days our principal food was porridge, which
we prefered to anything else. We boiled it
with water and sugar. In going down towards
Mount Hopeless, we found we could not carry
all the things we brought with us. We had to
leave the camel pads and such things. We
made two attempts to get to Mount Hopeless.
After losing one camel, we remained at the
creek some short time, till we recovered
strength to start for Cooper?s Creek again.
We had only the clothes we stood in, and no
bed clothing but the camels? pads and two oil-
cloths. We had boots and trousers, such as
they were. Mr, Wills had a guernsey and a
wide-awake. We all had wide-awakes. Mr.
Wills had an old pair of flannel trousers, and
towards the end of the journey, we had only
the horsehair in the camels? pads to cover us.
As was stated in the narrative, Mr. Burke ac-
cidentally set fire to the gunyah in which the
few articles of clothing were, so that after that
we could get nothing. After Mr. Wills died,
and while I was away, the natives pulled down
the half of the gunyah, and put the timber
across his breast. They took his hat, guern-
sey flannel, trousers, and some other articles
of clothing, and that was hW he remained
when Mr. Howitt came up. There were sipme
buttons and other articles which he had in a
housewife. The natives took this, but after-
wards returned it, and that is the housewife
which Mr. Howitt has now. It never occurred
to Mr. Burke?s mind, that if our absence ex-
ceeded three or four months the other party
would leave the dep6t. If we remained five
months he would have expected to find a party
there. Mr. Burke was exceedingly weak, but
he would have walked till he dropped,
Sir Francis Murpht?Did he express any
intentions as to the revolver?
Mr. King.?l heard him say, ? King, this is
nice treatment, after fulfilling our task, and
arriving where we left our companions.?
Dr. Wills asked that his son?s letter should
be identified.
Mr. King.?That is the letter Mr. Wills read
to me on the morning he wrote it. I believe he
read it over to us, that anything which might
be said to our disadvantage might be denied,
and that people should know what was the
truth, and nothing but the truth. That is the
watch which Mr. Wills desired me to give to
his father. The pocket-book Mr. Burke gave
me the evening before his death he told me I
was to give to Sir Win. Stawell, and under no
circumstances to any other member of the
committee, it to Sir Wm. Stawell
this morning. That was the same book I
showed to Mr. Howitt, telling him what I was
to do with it. Mr. Burke also gave me his
watch, which he said was the property of the
committee, and which I delivered to Mr.
Howitt.
The Hon. M. Hervet. ?How did you pre-
rerve these things from the blacks ?
Mr. King,? I had them in a small canvas
bag, which I always carried with me. The
natives were very meddlesome, and always
wanted me to show them what was in the
bag, but the watch was never found out.
Some questions were here put as to Mr.
Burke?s journal.
Mr. King,?Mr. Burke made some notes, hut
on the day he left Mr. Wills, he gave me a
small pocket-book, the contents of which he
said were of no importance. He often gave
me papers out of that pocket-book to use for
wads when we were firing at the crows. At
this time he gave me this book to use as I
chose. It is of no importance, but it contains
some notes and sketches relative to the
journey. I did not mean that that should
come into the possession of the committee.
It is my private property.
The Hon. M. Hervet.?Did he consult Mr.
Wills as to what should go into the journal ?
Mr. King.?He always did so. I believe one
journal answered for both. lam sure that is
the reason why there were not two journals.
The Hon. M. Hervet.?Then Mr. Burke
concurred in all Mr. Wills said ?
Mr. King.?Yes: hut any remark which Mr.
Burke made, Mr. Wills always put down in
the journal. Every evening after Mr. Wills ar-
rived in camp, he read over what he had
written, and Mr. Burke would make additions.
I generally heard the conversation.
The Chairman. ?The commission will
not trouble you any more to-day, Mr. King,
and they are very much obliged to you for
the clear and careful statement you have
made.
Mr. Sullivan said that the commission
did not wish to tire Mr. King.
Sir Francis Murpht.?The journal, then,
was always in Mr. Wills?s handwriting. _
Mr. King.?Always. One remark I wish to
make. I understand that there seems to be an
impression with the public that Mr. Wills
was the real leader of the party. Now, I deny
that. Mr. Burke was the leading man of the
party. Several gentlemen have spoken to me
on the subject. ,
The Chairman.? l don t think that is the
general understanding.
The Hon. M. Hervet.? The idea has arisen
from the fact of there being only one journal,
but you have explained that,
Mr. King.?l only made the remark to re-
move any wrong opinion on the subject.
Mr, King then retired to his seat, apparently
but little exhausted after making his long
statement. .
The Hon. M. Hervet desired to put a ques-
tion to Mr. Brahe,
Mr, Brahe then came forward.
The Hon. M, Hervet said he desired to
refer to that portion of Mr. Wills?s letter which


referred to his (Mr. Brahe?s) instructions, that
he was not to leave except from necessity. He
had subsequently said those were not his in-
structions.
Mr. Brahk repeated that he had never been
instructed according to the tenor of Mr.
Wills?s letter.
The Hon. M. Hervey. ?lf you had those
instructions, would you have acted differently?
Mr. Brahe. ?I should not have acted differ-
ently. I could not have done otherwise. I
considered it absolutely necessary to leave, for
the reasons I have already given to the com-
mission. I might perhaps have stated differ-
ently in my letter left in the cache, and tried
my utmost to have returned to Cooper?s Creek
with supplies.
Dr. Ferdinand Mueller was the next wit-
ness examined. He said he had not superin-
tended the preparation of the provisions for
the Expedition. He had been too ill at the
time. A list of the provisions and prepara-
tions had been submitted to him, and he had
suggested certain alterations which his own
experience had intimated to him. He only
shared in a general responsibility, therefore.
He had formed one of Mr. Gregory?s Expedi-
tion, and, having been eighteen months away
from the settled districts, had therefore con-
siderable experience. The arrangements
madeforithe Expedition were in perfect accord-
ance with his opinions. It seemed to him
to have been not of very great importance
what provisions were sent from Melbourne, as
more might be procured at the Darling. The
general outfit, he thought, was calculated to
last eighteen months. The question was
entertained whether it would not have been
better to have the heavy stores sent up from
the Darling; but as there was no regular
communication with that place, it was re-
solved to adopt the course which had been
followed. After comparing notes with Mr.
King, Dr. Mueller concluded by saying that he
could not be certain that the spot which the
Burke and Wills? party had struck was the
Albert River discovered by Mr. Gregory?s
party, and marked by Captain Stokes.
Dr. Macadam said that it had been calcu-
lated by Mr. Ligar that the place struck by
the Expedition should be placed on the map
more to the westward.
The next witness was Mr. A. Howitt.
Mr. Howitt said he was the leader of the
contingent exploring party, and had arrived
at the Darling safe and well. He believed the
list of stores he had found at Menindie (pro-
duced by Dr. Macadam) was a true copy of
the one which he had prepared. There was a
large quantity there ?either three or four bags
of flour, clothing of different kinds, only a
small quantity of sugar, four or five casks of
meat biscuits, a quantity of preserved vege-
tables. He could only speak to the stores
he found there, but could not say whether
they had been brought back or not. The
camels were not in good order, hut the horses
were in splendid condition ?indeed, they could
hardly be otherwise. He had taken with him
such provisions as he thought he should re-
quire. His journal related almost every inci-
dent that had taken place. He had had no
difficulty in getting to Cooper?s Creek. He
always got water, at least so far as that every-
body had enough, though sometimes only mud
was left. Except on one night, and two sepa-
rate nights, at two separate places, it had
always been obtainable without difficulty.
He had had instructions from the committee
to get whatever he wanted. The great diffi-
culty of getting water commenced at Toro-
woto. There was no permanent water there.
The first permanent water could be got at the
Daubeney range; that was, it was permanent
if other parties had not used it shortly before.
Beyond that there was another creek where he
believed permanent water could be obtained,
but a great deal of it had gone when he came
down. When he went up he only had to dig
seven feet, but as he came back his men had
to dig eight feet. He went from Menindie to
Bulloo in the dry season, though water could
generally be obtained some two or three
months after the rains had ceased. He had
followed Mr. Burke?s track as far as the Porio
Creek, where he had struck across to Camp
60. The country he passed through was very
similar to the other, but he passed through one
large creek which he believed was connected
with Bulloo. He could not speak as to Mr.
Wright?s detention at Menindie, for he knew
no more of the circumstances than from facts
which had been generally stated.
The Chairman asked if he did not think it
very desirable that Mr. Burke should have
been followed up immediately?
Mr. Howitt could only say that the country
was treacherous, the rains uncertain, and a
very short delay might sometimes be of the
greatest consequence. They might be fatal
to any large party. He had not met Mr. Wright
coming back.
The Chairman asked why Mr. Howitt had
not disturbed the plant ?
Mr. Howitt. ?That is easily explained. I
believe that there was nothing but stores
there ?nothing whatever. I had plenty of
provisions, and I thought that, if I opened
the plant, I must either have carried the
provisions with me, or have buried them
again, with an increased risk of their being
discovered by the natives. Looking at the
matter in this light, I thought it would be
useless to open the plant. If I was not sup-
plied, on my return I thought I should in
all probability find them untouched if I re-
quired them. Those were my reasons for
leaving them alone. Whether Mr. Burke
could have gone on depended entirely on
the state he was in. I scarcely like to give
an opinion after what I have heard. He
could have followed Brahe with forty days?
provisions if his horses and camels were in
good order. They could not have gone on
just as they were, because they could not
have carried on forty days? provisions them-
selves. As they were situated, I almost think
they might have done the journey. At all
events they would have been pretty near the
Darling. My instructions were to proceed to
Menindie with the greatest despatch, and
follow Mr. Burke?s tracks, Except in respect


to those general instructions, I was left to my
discretion. None of our party suffered from
scurvy, though we had only such vegetables
as we found there. We found portulac, a
native spinach, and several other things. The
season was very favourable for us, and was un-
usually tine. I did not see much game. I can
scarcely say how long the distance is between
Cooper?s Creek and Menindie. We all arrived
in excellent order. I did not see any natives
at Bulloo, for I did not go through their
country. I have seen Mr. M'Kinlay?s state-
ment, but it appears to require explanation
It is more possible that he has found Grey?s
grave than that he has struck any other.
Had he struck any other grave, he must have
seen my marked tree. I can scarcely tell
you the spot without referring to the map.
Had M?Kinlay been at Cooper?s Creek, he
must have seen my initials, and a broad
arrow pointing the direction in which our
party had gone.
Sir Fbancis Murphy.?Do you think you
could get back?
Mr. Howitt. ?It is quite impossible to say
till I know in what state the country is.
There may be a time when it would be im-
possible to get through to Cooper?s Creek, but
with camels in good order I think I could
get through in almost any season. I should
do it in this way:?When the stages were
long, and knowing I must depend on the
water I carry, I should send on a camel half the
journey. I should then water my camels
half way, and then push on through to the
next water. I think I could get through
with camels on which I could depend. The
most likely.place with good grazing capabili-
ties that I know of to suit for a permanent
depot, would be about 170 or 180 miles from
Menindie. I suppose I would do my best if
I were sent back. What I can do I will,
but success does not depend on me but on
a higher power. I think it would be the
most expeditious plan to send supplies to
the Darling by water, if any one could de-
pend on the time at which they would ar-
rive there.
After a short conversation,
The Chaieman asked if any person pre-
sent desired to give evidence?
No one replied.
In answer to the Chairman,
The Secretary said he did not suppose
Mr. Wright would be present to give evidence
on Saturday.
The commission then adjourned till Tues-
day following, at noon.
FIFTH MEETING.
The commission held its fifth sitting on
December 10th, at Parliament-house. The
whole of the members were present; Major-
General Sir T. S. Pratt presiding.
Mr. William Wright, who arrived on Sun-
day from Adelaide, was first examined. He
said, ?I joined Mr. Burke?s party at Menindie.
I went with him as far as Torowota, as a vol-
unteer. Mr. Burke had been advised by set-
tlers on the Darling, that it would not be
possible for him to reach Cooper?s Creek at
that season of the year. I believe they pre-
sumed this from what they had heard from the
natives. It was generally supposed by people
who had not seen the country that Mr, Burke
would not be able to go. As I had been in
that direction shortly before, I knew that he
could go. Having gone as far as Torowota,
Mr. Burke desired me to return to Menindie.
He then gave me the appointment of third in
command, subject to the approval of the com-
mittee.
By Sir F. Murphy.? l had been in charge of
a station belonging to John Baker for three
years before- I had been about twenty miles
beyond Torowota twice before, at different
seasons of the year. I knew more about the
country than any other man on the Darling,
and I was confident that Mr. Burke could take
the whole of the party up. I told Mr. Burke
before I left him that I would procure guides
to take him on to Cooper?s Creek. I got na-
tives to take him on as far as Bulla. From
Bulla to Cooper?s Creek he had to go without
guides. When Mr. Burke first arrived at
Menindie I was out of employment, the sta-
tion having changed hands. I saw the party
when they arrived at Menindie. It was a well-
equipped party. I went with Mr. Burke,
with the view of showing him a better route
to Cooper?s Creek. Two blacks went with us.
One of them had been with me before. We
had no difficulty in reaching Torowota. Mr.
Burke?s wish was that I should go. farther on,
but I could not possibly do it at the time. I
wanted to send to my wife and family, by the
Darling steamer. I accordingly returned to
Menindie. Mr. Burke arranged that I should
be the third in command ?Mr. Wills being
second ?and that I should bring up the re-
mainder of the party from Menindie. I had
no written agreement. I brought from Mr.
Burke a despatch, sealed, and addressed to the
committee. Mr. Burke read over the despatch
to me, but I had no copy of it. Mr. Burke
told me that he intended, when he reached
Cooper?s Creek, to send back the horses and
camels to Menindie, and that he should wait
there till I came up and then take me on with
him. I believe Mr. Brahe understood that he
was to be one of the party to bring back the
horses and cattle. When I got the despatch
I returned to Menindie; and when I arrived
at Menindie I forwarded the despatch, by post,
with a letter to the committee from myself.
I expected an answer in four weeks. Dr. Bcck-
ler was left in charge at Menindie.
By the President. ?I stated, in the letter
which I sent to ?the committee, what Mr.
Burke had stated to me. I made no state-
ment as to stopping at Menindie until the
appointment was confirmed; but until my
appointment was confirmed I did not know
rightly what to do.
Dr. Macadam here observed that this letter
was never received by the committee.
Mr. Wright. ?l have no copy of the letter.
It was not answered at all. The first des-
patches I received from the committee were
after I sent Mr. Hodgkinson down. I was six
or seven days coming from Torowota to


Menindie; and when I arrived at Menindie I
found the trooper Lyons there, with despatches
for Mr. Burke. He told me his instructions
were to deliver these despatches to Mr. Burke
himself. I must have returned to Menindie
early in November ?say about the sth. It so
happened that Dr. Beckler and Mr. Hodgkin-
son were out on the ranges with the horses,
and therefore I had to wait several days
l>efore I could send on to Mr. Burke the
despatches brought by Lyons. As soon as I
had horses I sent on Lyons and Macpherson,
with the guide who had been out with me. I
expected that when they returned I should
receive horses and camels, and orders to follow
up Mr. Burke I had no doubt about their
being able to overtake Mr. Burke. If I had
had any doubt I should not have started them.
I heard nothing of them for some time. The
first I heard of them was when the black-
fellow came in with a letter from Lyons,
stating that he had not overtaken Mr.
Burke, that two or three horses were lost,
and that he and McPherson were in a state of
starvation. I sent Dr. Beckler to their relief
and I sent an express to the committee by
Hodgkinson. This was on thel9th of December.
Sir F. Murphy.? From the sth of Novem-
ber to the 19th of December seems an enor-
mous time. Can you give any explantion to
the committee how that time was occupied ?
Did you keep any journal?
Mr. Wright.?No.
Sir F. Murphy. ?What were the party and
yourself engaged in all that time ?
Mr. Weight. ?We were merely looking af-
ter the stock and attending to the camels. In
fact, I did not know rightly what to do, or
how to act. I had no instructions from the
committee ; indeed, I had nothing further than
what Mr. Burke had said.
Sir. F. Murphy. ?But you knew the nature
of the country and the difficulty of reaching
Cooper?s Creek in a bad season; and yet from
the sth of November to the end of December
nothing was done.
Mr. Wright. ? l was waiting for horses and
camels coming in with Lyons and Macpherson
and some of Mr. Burke?s party, according to
the arrangement made with me by Mr. Burke.
. The President. ?According to Mr. Burke?s
statement, he expected you to have followed
him up so closely that you would have reached
Cooper?s Creek two or three days after he
started.
Mr. Wright.?l don?t see rightly how he
could have expected that.
The President. ?That is his statement. In
fact, he was almost inclined to wait at
Cooper?s Creek until you came up.
Mr. Wright. ?lf Lyons and Macpherson
had overtaken him, I believe he would have
waited for me.
The President. ?But knowing that twenty-
eight days must elapse before you would re-
ceive a communication from the committee,
how is that to be reconciled with Mr. Burke?s
idea that you would be only two or three days
after him ?
Mr Wright. ?l cannot understand that at
all. Mr. Burke?s instructions, when I left
him, were to follow him up as soon as my ap-
pointment was confirmed.
The President.? Mr, Burke says, in his
despatch of the 29th October,-r? Meanwhile I
have instructed him to follow me up with
the remainder of the camels to Cooper?s
Creek.? How do you reconcile that with your
not starting?
Mr. Wright, ?One reason why I did not
start was, the having to send despatches after
Mr. Burke. Some six or seven weeks elapsed
between the departure of the trooper Lyons
and his return.
Sir F. Murphy. ?l have before me your let-
ter of the 19th December, stating that the
camels, &c., left behind were too few for
carrying on the party. Do I understand you
to say, that the delay from the sth November
to the 19th December, when you wrote down
with respect to Lyons? failure, was occasioned
in the first place by your having a portion
only of your stock, and secondly, by not having
any confirmation of your appointment from
the committee ?
Mr. Wright.? Yes.
The Hon. Mr. He rye Y.? Did you deem it
indispensably necessary to have the confirma-
tion of the committee ?
Mr. Wright. ? l really did not know whether
my appointment would be confirmed. I
thought it proper to get some instructions
from the committee.
The Hon. Mr. Hervey.? Did Mr. Burke
know it was your intention not to start with-
out the confirmation of the committee ?
Mr. Weight. ?l said I would wait for an
answer from Melbourne.
The Hon. Mr. Hervey.? Then he must
have known you would have to wait a
month ?
Mr. Wright. ?He told me to wait for
despatches. It appears that what Mr. Burke
wrote was somewhat different to the conver-
sations he had with me.
The Hon. Mr. Hervey? Did you entertain
the expectation that if you waited a month
you would be able to reach Cooper?s Creek ?
Mr. Wright?l felt I should be able to
reach Cooper?s Creek at any season of the
year.
Sir F. Murphy.? lt appears that, after
waiting until the 19th December, you made a
further delay until the 26th of January.
Mr. Weight. ? l was waiting for despatches;
and after I received despatches, I had to pur-
chase horses; the horses on the Darling are
not exactly fit for that work. I made a final
start for Cooper?s Creek on the 26th of Janu-
ary. We took all kinds of stores and clothing
?enough to last my party about six months?
andwe left stores behind. My intention was to
proceed straight to Cooper?s Creek, to go on to
Eyre?s Creek if I found myself able to do so,
and to send back a party if possible. We had
some difficulty in getting up. We were out
on the Torowota about sixteen days, the
country being dried up to such an extent. I
thought it advisable to go on forwards, to see
if the rest of the party could follow. I could
not find Mr. Burke?s track. Two of the party
(Dr. Becker and Stone) were not at all well.


I did not make an effort to send them back at
first, because I did not think they were
affected to such an extent as it turned out
that they were. I had never had any expe-
rience of scurvy. I had never suffered from
want of water in the bush. Indeed, I was
never better in my life than when out in the
bush. I brought the party up to Bulla, but I
could get them no further. I reached Bulla
on the 4th April, having been upwards of two
months in proceeding thither from Menindie,
Sir F. Morphy. ?And in the meantime Mr.
Burke had crossed the continent. However,
the difficulties were great, I presume.
Mr. Wright. ?My party remained at Bulla
from the 4th to the 17th April. I made an
effort to reach Cooper?s Creek. I left the
party in charge of the doctor, and pushed for-
ward with John Smith, but did not strike
Cooper?s Creek. I was away from the camp
a day and a night. I was afraid to be away
longer. The reason was that I was surround-
ed by blacks. It was not safe for me to leave
the camp. The distance to Cooper?s Creek
from Bulla was between seventy and eighty
miles.
Mr. Brahe informed the commission that
the distance to the depot on Cooper's Creek
was nearly 150 miles.
Mr. Sullivan. ?Did you ever make use of
the observation that you felt it would be use-
less to go to Cooper?s Creek, as you did not
expect that Mr. Burke would ever get back ?
Mr. Wright. ?Never. After I went with
Mr. Brahe to Cooper?s Creek, and returning to
my depot, I expressed the wish to go back to
Cooper?s Creek again. I said there might be a
chance of Mr. Burke?s return although so late.
But Dr. Beckler said, ? You see the position
you are in. So sure as you go back to Cooper?s
Creek, three men who are here will die. It
will be three or four weeks before you will be
able to start for the Darling, and you will be
sacrificing these men?s lives for the chance of
men who will never come back this way.?
The blacks were every day annoying us, com-
ing sometimes in crowds of forty and fifty
and more. The blacks tried to surround Smith
and myself the first day we were out. Mr.
Brahe met us at Bulla on the 29th April. Mr.
Brahe told me that his instructions were to
remain three or four months at Cooper?s Creek.
He extended that to eighteen weeks, and left
only when the rations were running short.
His men were in such a state that they could
not stop there; one died on the way, and ano-
ther (M'Donough) was so ill that he had to be
lifted on and off his horse or camel. Mr. Brahe
told me he had buried some provissions at
Cooper's Creek. When I went to Cooper?s
Creek I took no provisions to add to the store,
I had to make a hurried journey; indeed I
was uneasy all the time I was away from the
camp. The provisions which Mr. Brahe left,
I thought would be sufficient to carry Burke
on if he came back, which I did not expect,
after what Mr. Brahe told me. I expected that
he had made along to the east coast and to
Queensland. Mr. Brahe joined us on the 29th
April, and on the Ist of May we turned back.
Sir F. Murphy? There were yourself, Hodg-
kinson, Beckler, Brahe, Smith, M'Donough,
Belooch, and Dost Mahomed. Two were ail-
ing, but all the rest were in tolerable health.
Your horses and camels were in good condi-
tion ?you were well supplied with provisions,
and on the Ist of May you turned your back
on Cooper?s Creek ? But after going a short
distance you thought better?
Mr. Wright. ?l did not think better, be-
cause it was my intention, after Mr. Brahe
came in to go to Cooper?s Creek. I buried
Mr. Becker, and shifted the camp twenty
miles further down, and then went to Cooper?s
Creek with Mr. Brahe. We took a pack-
horse. We reached the depot at Cooper?s
Creek on Wednesday, the Bth May, but found
no signs of Mr. Burke having been there, or
of the natives having disturbed the stores.
There were no marks to show that white men
had been there. There were the remains of
fires, which seemed as if they had been made
by the blacks. I did not leave at Cooper?s
Creek any record of my having been there.
I intended doing so, but I thought that if I
disturbed the cache, and took the bottle out,
the chances were that the blacks would dis-
cover it. In fact, I was not sure that they
were not watching us. We saw smoke the
night before, and, therefore, desiring to be
over-cautious, I did not take up the bottle
to put in a note from myself. The tree, as
marked on the 21st April by Mr. Brahe, was
left unaltered?
The President. ?Would there have been
any difficulty in carving beneath the inscrip-
tion of Mr. Brahe, ? W., Bth May.?
Mr. Wright. ?No, if I had only had the
presence of mind to do so. I looked about
the place, and thought at first of camping
there, but Mr. Brahe stated that if we did so
the horses would assuredly go back to a
camp five miles higher up where they used to
run. We accordingly went to that place, and
there camped. We had no water from the
time we left Koorlialto Creek until we got to
Cooper?s Creek. The country around Bulla
was very good, and it would have been pos-
sible to remain at Bulla a considerable time
without injury to man or horse.
Sir F. Murphy. ?When you returned to
Bulla you immediately made for home?
Mr. Wright ?Yes; as any wise man would
have done under the circumstances. I can
detect the difference between the track of a
white man and that of a black man. A great
deal of our beef spoiled at Menindie, but not
all, as I took a considerable quantity with
me. The process we adopted in curing was
that of sun drying.
The President.? You have already stated
that you could not leave Menindie without
the sanction of the Exploration Committee
to your appointment. But in your letter of
the 19th December to the committee, you
state: ?? Pursuant to a previous understand-
ing with Mr. Burke, it was my intention to
rejoin that gentleman with the members of
the party and stores at present in this camp.
I delayed starting merely because the camels
(nine) left behind by Mr. Burke were too few
in number and too inferior in carrying powers


to carry out a really serviceable quantity of
provisions.? Now, can you reconcile the two
statements ?
Mr. Wright?l was waiting for an answer
from the committee; and after I had sent
away Lyons and Macpherson the camels were
not sufficient to take up the stores. lam
quite clear that Mr. Burke?s despatch, which I
sent from Menindie, was accompanied by a
letter from myself. . .
Dr. Macadam here informed the commission
that all the despatches, as they came in from
any party, had been regularly handed over to
the press; and on looking over The Argus of
the 4th December, which contained an account
of the proceedings of the Exploration Com-
mittee the previous day, not the slightest men-
tion was made of any separate despatch from
Mr. Wright. He would call the attention of
the Commission to the fact that the introduc-
tory portion of Mr. Wright?s letter of the 19th
December would not have been necessary if
any letter from him had been received before.
Mr. Wright said he distinctly recollected
sending a letter with Mr. Burke?s despatch.
Mr. Sturt. You were aware that Mr.
Burke?s despatch was received safely?
Mr. Wright.?Not till I received an answer
by Mr. Hodgkinson.
Mr. Wecker, the Menindie postmaster who
was examined at a previous sitting, stated, in
reply to questions, that he remembered Mr.
Burke?s despatch being posted by Wright, but
he could not say whether Wright posted a
letter from himself at the same time, and (in
the absence of registration) there was no means
of ascertaining. The mail left fortnightly.
The bag was made up for Wentworth, where
it was again made up for Swan Hill. He be-
lieved the bag was afterwards opened at B'en-
di^o.
Mr. Sturt (To Mr. Wright).?Did you hear
that the settlers on the Darling commented on
your losing so much time at Menindie ?
Mr. Wright.?No. I was aware that the
waters were drying up, and that there would
be some difficulty in getting through.
Mr. Sturt. ?Did you not conceivethere was
some extraordinary delay in the acknowledge-
ment of your despatch ?
Mr. Wright.?l expected a reply every day.
The President.?When you returned from
Cooper?s Creek, you did not come straight to
Melbourne.
Mr. Wright.?No; I went to Adelaide. I in-
tended coming round by Swan Hill, but was
informed that the mail cart would not come
to Euston that week; and as the steamboat
was passing at the time, Mr. Commissioner
Cole said the best way was for me to go on
board. This was about forty miles above the
Darling junction. Mr. Burke never expressed
a doubt as to my appointment being con-
firmed by the committee. I think there was
something mentioned at Menindie as to some
of Mr. Burke?s cheques being dishonoured.
Had the confirmation of my appointment ar-
rived earlier, I could not have started from
Menindie without the return of Lyons and
Macpherson. .
The President.?Mr. Burke says in his des-
patch,' after giving you the highest charac-
ter?* I shall proceed on from here to Cooper s
Creek. I may or may not be able to send back
from there until we are followed up.?
Mr. Wright.?l cannot understand that,
Mr. Burke read the despatch over to me. _
Mr. Sullivan?Had you any conversation
with Mr. Burke during the journey as to the
course he would pursue?
Mr. Wright.?l understood from him that
he would make Eyre?s Creek, but that he
would not leave Cooper?s Creek, till I joined
him. He did not know exactly what he would
do. He said, if he had any difficulty in coming
back, he would make for Queensland. This
was spoken of several times. There was some
mention, made of a vessel to meet him, hut
I don?t think Mr. Burke really expected it.
He said the chances were there might be such
a thing. , . , . ,
The President.?Mr. Burke says in his des-
patch, ? Perhaps I may find it advisable to
leave a depot at Cooper?s Creek, and go on
with a small party to examine the country
beyond it. Under any circumstances, it is
desirable that we should be soon followed up.
So it seems that he expected no delay.
Mr. Wright.?The fact is that when Mr.
Burke read over the despatch to me I did not
take particular notice. Indeed, Mr. Lurke
used to alter his mind so very often that it
was not possible, at times to understand what
he really did mean. Before leaving Menindie
I strongly advised Mr. Burke to take out the
whole party to Cooper?s Creek. I don t know
his reason for taking a smaller party. 1 here
was a distinct understanding that Mr. Burke
would send back the camels, and most likely'
the whole of the horses, after reaching Cooper s
Creek. He took fifteen horses. I told him
that if I did not catch the mail at Menindie,
it would make a fortnight?s difference. Mr.
Burke made me understand that he would
remain at Cooper?s Creek, and not attempt the
larger journey until I joined him.
Mr. Hervey.?There is soine_ allusion in
your journal, after you were joined by Mr.
Brahe, to the spectacle being an imposing
The Chairman. ?You say that ? the caval-
cade made quite an imposing appearance.
Mr. Wright.?That was only an extrava-
gant expression on the part of Mr. Hodgkin-
son. There were two camels which, at the
time, could hardly put one leg before the
other. ,
John Smith stated that he joined the ex-
pedition at Menindie on the 7th December.
Mr. Wright engaged him. He was engaged in
no particular capacity. He had not been
living at Menindie before the 7th December.
From that time until the 26th January he was
? knocking about? at Menindie. He came
from the Murray. He was not in the Darling
country before. The party started with stores
for five or six months on the 26th January.
He suffered from scurvy on the way up. He
had suffered from it before, on the Murrum-
bidgee. It affected him in the same way both
times. The party had fresh meat, jerked meat,
preserved vegetables, rice, sugar and tea. He


had plenty of clothing; still he did not escape
scurvy. He went with Mr. Wright in advance
of the party in search of water. He did not
go on to Cooper?s Creek. He started with that
intention with Mi. Wright, but did not get
there, owing to the blacks surrounding them.
Mr. Wright and himself had arms. He had
been among the blacks a great deal and was
not afraid of them. The blacks surrounded
the camp at Bulla on one occasion. They
came with Boomerangs within fifty yards, and
would not retire until fired into. He knew
nothing of the plans of the party.
Dr. Macadam handed into the Commission
the last despatch from Mr. Burke, written in
pencil in his pocket-book, and which came
fbe hands of Sir William Stawell through
Mr. King, The committee were anxious that
great care should be taken of it.
The President asked if any person present
had evidence to give ?
. No one responding, the Commission ad-
journed until Thursday, at noon.
_ SIXTH MEETING.
The commission held its sixth sitting on De-
cember 12th., in one of the committee rooms
of the Legislative Council. The whole of the
members were present. The room was
crowded.
The first witness examined was Mr. W.
, right, late the third in command of the Ex-
ploration Expedition.
The Chairman reminded Mr. Wright that
there was a discrepancy between the state-
iiia-de on Tuesday last, and that made by
Dr. Macadam, in reference to a letter alleged
to have been written by him on his return
from Torowota. Was the letter of the 19th
December written by himself?
Mr. Wright. ?No; Mr. Hodgkinson did all
the wntmg for me. He did not write the one
which is stated to be missing; I wrote that
myself. My memory would not serve me to
state more than the general purport of the
letter. I never thought for a moment of keep-
ing a copy. I only mentioned that Mr. Burke
had appointed me to take the party out. That
was about the whole of it. After explaining
the times at which he believed the mail started
from the Darling, Mr. Wright proceeded;?
1 believe the letter I wrote did not leave the
Darling till the 13th of the month, which
w �uld be the second post of the month. It
could not reach Melbourne, therefore, till the
end of the month.
I?he next witness was Sir William Stawell,
Chairman of the Exploring Committee. In
answer to questions put by different members
of the commission.
Sir William Stawell said, ? I was the chair-
man of the Exploration Committee. There
was a sub-committee, which, however, was
not formally appointed, which co-operated
with Mr. Burke, at his own request, in the ar-
rangement of the stores, more particularly in
respect to the dry meat. At that time of the
year ther were some difficulties in getting the
meat prepared, and it was a matter of debate
whether it should not be procured at the Dar-
ling. Ultimately it was determined to get
? the meat in Melbourne, and have it dried
i artificially.
; Sir Francis Murphy? What were the ob-
: jects of the Expedition ?
. Sir William Stawell.? To cross the con-
tinent, if that were possible, and if not to ex-
plore such portions of it as could be explored
with safety. The Exploration Committee
represented to a certain extent, a committee
formed apart from the Royal Society; and by
a resolution, which was regularly passed, it
was settled that Cooper?s Creek was to be a
depot. The Committee considered itself bound
by that resolution, inasmuch as money had
been received on the faith of it, and therefore
the resolution respecting the formation of a
depot at Cooper?s Creek was never departed
from. _ In addition, it was considered that,
from information received from Sturt and
Gregory that spot was the most advanced po-
sition of the country where the presence of
water could be relied upon, and that, there-
fore, from thence the exploration into the
interior might be carried on with the utmost
safety; for the Committee was disposed to run
no risk whatever. A proposition was made to
the committee to start from Blunder Bay; but
seeing that the Expedition would in such a
case have no where to fall back upon, it was
ultimately decided to start from Cooper?s
Creek to the Gulf of Carpentaria. It was a
general notion that the leader of the Expedition
was not to be interfered with, nor was he to
be bound by the suggestions of the committee.
Mr. Burke attended all our meetings, and
assisted at our deliberations. If the Gulf of
Carpentaria could not be reached, it was con-
sidered advisable to follow the N.W. direction
to the Victoria. This, however, was not so
much pressed at the time, because it was sup-
posed that Stuart either had discovered or
would discover it. It was next thought that
after that the best thing to explore was the
route to Western Australia. Our object was,
not merely to cross the continent, but to
make a survey as well. It was once discussed
whether the Expedition should not start from
Port Augusta, but the proj ect was given up when
it was remembered that the most liberal sub-
scriptions came in consideration of the desire
that the country round Cooper?s Creek should
be explored. Mr. Burke was instructed, over
and over again, that when going from the
Darling to Cooper?s Creek he was to make
diversions on each side; in point of fact, to
see if there was any country which would be
valuable for stock. It was another considera-
tion of the committee that a depot should be
formed at Cooper?s Creek, from which com-
munications might be obtained. These were
most desirable, as it was intended to go to the
public again for further funds, and if the
public were not kept au fait, their interest
would fail; while, on the other hand, with a
constant interest in the matter, they might
come forward with liberal subscriptions. We
looked forward to the Expedition being en-
gaged many months, if not several years. If
they were successful in reaching Carpentaria,
the leaders might fall back and recruit, and
afterwards make researches in other direc-


tions. In fact the discovery of a route to Car-
pentaria was only intended to be the first \
stage of operations. It was intended that the <
whole party should go across ?that is, leaving i
enough behind to keep up communication
with us. To establish the depot on the Dar-
ling was the suggestion of the leader after
starting, the stores being too large for him to
take on. Waggons were hired, and the com-
mittee intended to send the stores left at Swan
Hill on to Menindie.
Sir Francis Murphy ?l believe there was
no hurry in starting Mr. Burke off?
Sir Wm. Stawell? The committee had de-
sired that Mr. Burke should start before he
did, that he might avail himself of the good
weather to reach Cooper?s Creek. He stopped
on account of the camels, for it was thought
necessary that they should go on with him,
and having only lately arrived, their condi-
tion was too weak for them to do so at once.
The Expedition waited solely for them. Mr.
Burke had ample time to make arrangements,
and expressed himself satisfied with every-
thing. His own words were, that they had
a glorious start.? .
Sir Francis Murphy He chose his second
in command for himself?
Sir Wm. Stawell.? He himself wished Mr.
Landells to be appointed, and all the other
arrangements were made with his full appro-
bation. ? T ~ , ..,
Sir Francis Murphy? Was it part of the
original project to send a vessel round to the
Gulf of Carpentaria ?
Sir Wm. Stawell. ?No, never in that
way. The subject was once mentioned, and
that was all. It was explained that the
? plan of sending a vessel was an injurious
one, because if Mr. Burke started with suffi-
cient stores to enable him to return the way
he came, after he had reached the gulf,
such a plan would be far preferable, as he
could improve so much on what he had dis-
covered before. Besides, the chances of miss-
ing a vessel on a coast of such an enormous
extent were so great that the Expedition
might be easily misled, and find itself on
the northern shores of the continent without
stores. Mr. Burke had no reason to expect
a vessel. On the contrary, Mr. Burke?s views
were quite of another kind. He at first ap-
proved of the start from Blunder Bay, but
when he became informed of the objections
to such a course, he was perfectly satisfied
that the start from Cooper?s Creek would be
be st. He took so large a number of men with
him that he might have an early opportunity
of knowing which was the most efficient, and
judging for himself. The stores were all
chosen by himself, except the meat biscuit,
which was chosen by Dr. Mueller. I regret to
say that the Expedition did not avail them-
selves of those biscuits; and that, according
to Mr. Howitt?s statement, they were the best
food he could wish for. After the lapse of
twelve months they were perfectly good still,
and yet scwt. was lying still unused at Men-
indie. Except that he was to go to Cooper s
Creek, Mr. Burke was left entirely to his own
discretion, and could take any course he chose.
Sir Francis Murphy.? After Mr. Burke?s
start, who had the management of the details
of the Expedition, such as the correspondence
and other matters in Melbourne ?
Sir Wm. Stawell.?No particular person.
When despatches were received the whole
committee were invariably summoned to
meet by the secretary. All those who could
attended. On account of the large number of
members, and the fact that some attended at
one meeting and others at there was
a certain want of uniformity in their proceed-
ings. After the start of the Expedition, the
attendance of the members was better than
before, on account of the great public interest
felt in the matter. The despatches were
always read as soon as received, and were
generally published in the papers on the next
Francis Murphy.?l see that the first
despatch received from Mr. Burke after he left
the Darling was written at Torowoto, and
arrived here on December 3.
Sir Wm. Stawell. ?Yes; early in December.
Sir Francis Murphy. ?But Ido not see that
any notice was taken of it at the time.
Sir Wm. Stawell. ?I have a distinct recol-
lection of its being laid before the committee
just after it was received. It was discussed,
but no formal icsolution was proposed or
passed, because the opinion of the committee
was, that it was too late to send any answer.
The reason the fact is so clearly impressed on
my memory is, that when I attended the
meeting the public had been informed of
Stuart?s discoveries only a short time before,
and I was very apprehensive of the eftect that
fact might have on Burke's and Wills?s minds.
I knew their zeal, and was afraid that they
would incur risks. I had written a private
letter to Burke, imploring him not to throw
any chance away, in consequence of a natural
anxiety to cross the continent first. I told
him that I quite saw that it would be a race
between the two, but told him always to re-
member the number of people whose lives
w r ere entrusted to him, If, on the receipt of
hat despatch from Burke, I had thought there
was any prospect of another letter reaching
him, before he arrived at Cooper?s Creek, I
should have been too anxious to repeat what
I had said previously. The committee arrived
at the same conclusion, more particularly
because at the time, they received no de-
spatch from Wright himself. At that time of
year the water was drying up. Every day was
of importance, and to send any further de-
spatch was judged useless.
Sir Francis Murphy said he had asked the
question seeing that by the newspaper re-
ports nothing had been done at that meeting,
though the committee had become aware that
Burke had divided his party, and left a large
number of persons at Menindie, with a view
i of being followed up immediately. Now
: Burke said in his letter?
, ? I shall proceed on from here to Cooper s
? Creek. I may or may not be able to send
i back from there until we are followed up.
l Perhaps it would not be prudent to divide the
, ) party; the natives here have told Mr. Wright


that we shall meet with opposition on our way
there. Perhaps I might find it advisable to
leave a depot at Cooper?s Creek, and go on
with a small party to examine the country
beyond it. Under any circumstances it is
desirable that we should be soon followed up
I consider myself very fortunate in having
Mr. Wills as my second in command.?
And so on. It did not appear that any des-
Satch was forwarded to Mr. Wright?s party at
Lenindie in reference to the following up
Sir Wm. Stawell. ?That arose from the
construction that the committee put upon the
letter, and the fact that there was no letter from
Mr. Wright. Mr. Burke had full authority to
h lre Wnght or any body else. In fact,
Mr. Wnght was only appointed vice Wills,
promoted. doubt two constructions might
be placed on Mr. Burke?s letter?one, that
Wright should be written to at once; and, an-
other, that we should wait; and in consequence
of receiving no letter from Mr. Wright we
came to the conclusion that if he had wanted
instructions, or was waiting for them, he
would have asked for them.
Sir Francis Murphy remarked that letters
were received about the same time from Dr
Beckler, dated November 13, and from Dr.
Becker, dated Menindie, November 27, but
nothing seemed to have resulted from their
reception by tne committee. He mentioned
these facts to show that the committee must
have been aware of the delay at the Darling.
Sir Wm. Stawell. ?The first information
received to the effect that any portion of the
Expedition was being detained at the Darling
was when Mr. Hodgkinson came down, and
then as much as the committee could do was
done. The committee met at once, and de-
termined to send back by Mr. Hodgkinson
authority to Mr. Wright to draw for a sum
much larger than that he had asked for. It
was first suggested to us by Mr. Hodgkinson
that Mr. Wright should be allowed to draw
not only to buy horses but sheep. I considered
at the time that Mr. Hodgkinson himself con-
tradicted his statement that the stores were
not sufficient, for he looked remarkably well
Mr. Wright asked for �2OO or �250, and
the committee authorised him to draw for
Sir Francis Murphy.? But still the com-
mittee must have been aware before that the
party was remaining at Menindie up to Nov.
Sir Wm. Stawell?l was not aware of it
I merely understood the letter from Dr.
Becker to enclose notes and sketches.
Sir Francis Murphy? But it was dated a
full month after Mr. Burke had left Torowoto.
Surely the committee must have known that
the party were at Menindie still, and yet they
appear to have done nothing on that know-
ledge, or on the remark in Burke?s letter that
he was to be immediately followed up.
Sir Wm. Stawell. ?There was most cer-
tainly a discussion, because I remember that
passage being commented upon, but nothing
was done for the reasons I have given
Sir Francis Murphy.? Then, until the 30th
December, when a further despatch was re-
ceived, nothing was done in reference to that
paragraph in Mr. Burke?s letter?
Sir Wm. Stawell.? Nothing till Mr.
Hodgkinson returned. Had there been any
i doubt previously on the minds of the com-
mittee, they would have at once adopted the
same measures which were taken when Mr.
Hodgkinson arrived.
, Sir Francis Murphy.? l see in the discus-
sion which took place when Mr. Hodgkinson
arrived, that it was stated that a letter con-
firming Mr. Wright?s appointment had gone
on to Mr. Burke. Is there any truth in it ?
Sir Wm. Stawell? None that I ever heard
of. I know of no necessity existing for the
committee to confirm Mr. Wright?s appoint-
ment, beyond the fact that the appointment
was subject proforma to the ratification of the
committee. It was supposed, however, that
Mr. Wright had already stalled from Menindie,
the confirmation of his appointment not be-
ing necessary. In fact no resolution was come
to, because it was considered that actually
nothing could be done.
Sir Francis Murphy. ?ln the discussion
I alluded to just now, I find it reported in
The Argus , Jan. 1,1861, that ?
? Mr. Hodgkinson observed there were a few
small accounts, amounting to about �3O,
which were incurred at the Menindie station,
but which Mr. Wright did not like to dis-
charge, as the ratification by the committee
of his appointment as third officer never
reached him, the letter containing it having
gone on to Mr. Burke.?
Sir AVm. Stawell. ?I don?t remember any-
thing of the kind, nothing of the kind being
brought before the committee. I have no re-
collection of anything of that nature having
passed.
Mr. Sullivan. ?Do you remember the na-
ture of the despatch sent by Lyons ?
Sir Wm. Stawell. ?Substantially it was to
convey information of Stuart?s having gone so
far across the continent.
Mr. Sullivan. ?Would not that have urged
Mr. Burke forward ?
Sir Wm. Stawell. ?On the contrary, there
was nothing in the official despatch to urge
him on. The committee plainly expressed
themselves that no risks should be incurred,
their only anxiety being that he should press
on safely in the proper way. Neither the com-
mittee nor myself thought the difficulties in
reaching Cooper?s Creek would be so great as
they were. Mr. Burke had spoken so easily
of it, and it was known that, beyond a tract
of country westward of the Darling, the route
was comparatively safe till Cooper?s Creek
was arrived at.
Sir Francis Murphy.? l see that Mr. Hodg-
kinson reckoned on getting up there in a
month.
Sir Wm. Stawell.? Yes. He spoke with
great confidence of doing that. I can only
express my own and others? opinion, that the
committee were more anxous about Mr.
Wright?s contingent party than they were
about Mr. Burke, even before they knew that
Mr. Burke had left Cooper?s Creek. So long a
time had elapsed since we had heard from


Wright that we were all anxious, and so Mr.
Howitt was sent up.
Sir Francis Murphy.? Mr. Burke never
communicated what his particular plans were,
did he? T , , 4
Sir Wm. Stawell.?No, never, I dont
think he could possibly have had any plan.
The committee always took tjjat view, and
suggested that although he might have made
some definite plans, yet they should not pre-
vent him from availing, himself of such cir-
cumstances as might arise.
Sir Francis Murphy.? Mr. Burke never
said anything about returning to Queens-
land?
Sir Wm. Stawell.? l strongly recommended
him to do so if he reached Carpentaria, and
had doubts about getting safely back across
the country. I pointed out the different
routes; and when the settlers had extended
their stations to the westward from Queens-
land, I thought it was probably the shortest
way of getting back to the settled districts.
Sir Francis Murphy. ?Do you know what
Burke knew of the nearness of South Austra-
lian cattle stations to Cooper?s Creek?
Sir Wm. Stawell. ?We were told I think
by Captain Cadell, that there were tracks
more than 100 miles from Cooper?s Creek,
leading S. W., or S. and by W., to stations
over an interval of about eighty miles which
was without water.
In answer to other questions,
Sir Wm. Stawell. ?The committee took par-
ticular account of one thing, ? Contingent ex-
penses would be in all likelihood incurred by
Mr. Burke, who was nervously apprehensive
that his credit would be assailed if he were
not fully provided. The formal way of meet-
ing this difficulty appeared to the committee
to be to give Mr. Burke a letter of authority to
draw on the treasurer. Eventually, however,
the committee adopted Burke?s own suggestion,
and placed �l5O to his credit; and we told
him if he even exceeded that to advise us of
his want of funds. We saw all the way
through that the expenses would rise up to
a larger'/amount than was anticipated. In
short, some of the settlers along the route
behaved most liberally and hospitably, while
others took the exactly opposite course, and
extracted the last farthing they could, they
looked on it as a Government Expedition,
which they ought to get as much out of as they
could. Seeing this, the treasurer mentioned
the matter to the committee, who were to
advise the bank that, if there were any further
orders on them, they were not to dishonour
them, but send them to the committee. It
was foreseen that the amount placed there
would be overdrawn. Communication was
made toffhe bank, but whether before or after
this I can?t say, but, quite unintentionally,
some trifling drafts were dishonoured. It wus
seen that the matter was of importance, and I
saw that to stop the supplies must be most in-
jurious to the party. I don?t think apprizing
the treasurer had anything to do with it,
and the whole of the amounts were most
trifling, , , , , ,
The Chairman.?ln fact the bank had not
written to the treasurer to say that the drafts
had been presented ? '
Sir Wm. Stawell?No, it had not.
The Hon. M. Hbrvby.? After receiving the
despatch brought by _ Mr. Hodgkinson you
found out the necessity of sending to Mr.
Wright to confirm his appointment?
Sir Wm. Stawell. ?Mr Hodgkinson said
that Mr. Wright hesitated to act till his ap-
pointment was confirmed. That does not
appear in. the despatch he brought, but he
stated it verbally, distinctly. He told us that
Mr. Wright's authority was questioned, though
the despatch led us to an opposite conclusion.
The conclusion drawn from Mr. Hodgkinson s
statement was that Mr. Wright would have
gone on at once had not the other members
of the party put the question ? Who are
J �The Hon. M. Hervey. ?But Mr. Wright
denied as much. , . .
Sir Wm. Stawell had only spoken from his
own observation.
Mr. Sullivan. ?That agrees with Mr.
Wright?s statement that he could not go on
till his appointment had been confirmed, and
Lyons had returned.
The Chairman ?This story of waiting for
confirmation is entirely at variance with
Burke?s idea that he would be followed up by
Wright in a few days.
Sir Wm. Stawell, ?In fact, the matter was
described by Mr. Burke in the following terms.
He said Mr. Wright was a thorough bush-
man ; the water was drying up, and he did
not think a thorough bushman would stop
for official reasons when a matter of such im-
portance was in question.
Mr. Sturt.? Then, if you had not seen Mr.
Hodgkinson, you would not have thought it
necessary to send any confirmation of Mr.
Wright?s appointment? . .
Sir Wm. Stawell. ?No, on receiving that,
I despaired of, or rather I abandoned, all
prospect of communication with Mr. Burke
till he had reached the Gulf and sent back a
report to us.
This concluded Sir William Stawell s ex-
amination. Sir William then left the room.
Mr. Sullivan.? l understand that Mr. Lan-
dells is present. I should like to hear what
he has to state about the matter.
Mr. Landells then came forward, and took
the seat usually occupied by witnesses.
In answer to questions,
Mr. George Jas. Landells said, ?I started
from Melbourne with Mr. Burke, as second in
command of the Expedition, I shall be happy
to give any information that lies in my power
if the members of the party originally com-
posing the Expedition are here. Until they
are here I cannot do so.
The Chairman.? But it is impipssible to
have them here. There is no question of ex
onerating yourself or anyone else before the
commission. We simply ask that you should
supply any missing links of evidence.
Mr Landells? l consider myself extremely
ill-used, and require to have evidence to prove
that the statements brought against me by


different gentlemen can be carried out. But
I feel confident
Sir Francis Murphy.?You must under-
stand that the question before the commission
is not
Mr. Landells. ?I should be very happy to
give information ; but unless the gentlemen
originally composing the Expedition are pre-
sent I can?t do it.
Sir Francis Murphy.? They can?t all be
here. Some of them are dead.
Mr. Landells. ?I understand that justice
is not to be had from the Royal Society. They
are shut against me, and I am not able to
give any opinion till the others are present.
The Hon M. Hervey.? How could they all
be here? We can?t send all round the
country for those who are alive.
, Mr. SuLLiVAN.- ?The object of the commis-
sion is to obtain information from those
persons who can throw some light on the
subject. Further than that we are not dis-
posed to go.
Mr. Landells replied that he could not, in
that case, say anything more. He then retired.
The next witness was Mr. Thomas Dick, a
publican, of Swan Hill.
Mr. Dick said ?I am a publican at Swan
Hill, and am here for several parties. I wish
to volunteer a statement in relation to Charles
Gray. Very few people know much about
him. I know more about him than any one
else, except his previous employer, and I wish
generally to state something about his charac-
ter. It seems to be a general impression that
Gray was not altogether right?that there is
something not clear about his character. I
have simply to state this?that he was in my
employment for fifteen months. I had him
at one time as general servant, at another time
as cook, at another as ostler, and another as
puntsman, for the punt over the Murray. In
short, when any of my servants get the worse
for drink, I make it a point to sack them at
once. Gray was the only man I could fall
back on. He has, of course, been repeatedly
the worse for liquor, when I gave him his
wages. I make it a point to pay all my men
once a month. He would go on the spree for
an afternoon. A general tippler he was not.
In fact, being in a public bouse, one might be
led to suppose that he was continually on the
drink, and he wasn?t. He only had some six
or seven sprees in eighteen months.
The Hon. Mr. Hervey.? That is very good.
(A laugh.)
Mr. Dick ?He was a steady hardy man, and
an able bushman. I have no hesitation in
saying a better bushman was not to be found.
You know what the mallee scrub is. I sent
him fifteen miles right bang into that scrub
for cattle. He was thoroughly honest. What-
ever I say the people of Swan Hill will back
me up in. His previous employer was a mail
contractor, and while with him Gray was
scarcely ever under the influence of liquor,
Mr. Dick then retired.
In answer to the chairman,
The Secretary said nothing more had been
heard about Dr. Beckler and Mr. Hodgkinson
from South Australia.
Mr. Sullivan said he wished to ask Mr.
Wright a few questions.
Mr. Wright came forward.
Mr. Sullivan asked what Mr. Wright was
doing during the interim between Mr. Hodg-
kinson?s return from Melbourne and the final
start from Menindie to the Darling.
Mr. Wright. ?As soon as I got my appoint-
ment confirmed, I had to do what I might
have down while I was waiting; I had to pur-
chase horses ; besides four bullocks had to be
killed. I had to train the horses. I could not
buy them as easily as I-should have liked.
After a somewhat detailed account of his deal-
ings with a Mr. Walker respecting some
horses ?
Mr. Sullivan? ln fact, the difficulty of get-
ting horses kept you back. When Mr. Burke
sent you back to the Darling, were you not
aware of his object, that you should follow
him up as soon as possible?
Mr. Wright.? Mr. Burke told me repeatedly
that he was not sure about my appointment,
nor that another person would not be sent up
to supersede me before my start. I mentioned
that to Mr. Haverfield when I came in.
Mr. Sullivan.? Then you made no prepara-
tion for starting while you were remaining at
Menindie ?
Mr. W right. ?l had the whole thing to keep
in order. There was nothing to be done but
to get horses and cattle. The stores were all
ready any day,
Mr. Sullivan.? What induced you to ex-
press doubts that Burke would never come
back to Cooper?s Creek ?
Mr. Wright. ?l never thought about it till
I heard what Brahe had to say. When I
heard about Burke telling him to stay twelve
weeks, I supposed he had gone along the east
coast of Queensland. I took that to be his
course, knowing that he had only taken twelve
weeks? provisions, while he had been gone
eighteen weeks.
Mr. Sullivan. ?How long did you expect
Lyons to take?
Mr. Weight. ?l expected him to take three
months. I thought he would stop and give
the horses a spell, and prepare the camels,
which I expected to see back. In fact, till I
got my appointment confirmed, I did not con-
sider myself a servant of the Expedition at all.
Mr. Sullivan.? Did you not think that Mr.
Burke had sufficient authority?
Mr. Weight.? Not by the way I was ap-
pointed, He told me another person might
be sent up from Melbourne.
Mr. Sullivan. ?Supposing Mr. Burke told
you that he had ample powers for everything?
Mr. Wright.? His letter does not show
that. In that he said he hoped the committee
would confirm my appointment. I recollect
that very well.
Sir Francis Murphy. ?But he says also
? In the meantime I have instructed him to
follow me up with the remainder of the
camels to Cooper?s Creek.?
Mr. Sullivan.? lf you had gone on with
Mr. Burke, instead of returning, should you
not have thought his authority sufficient?
Had he not employed you then?


Mr. Wright.?No; he did not employ me
at all; I went as a volunteer.
Mr. Sullivan? But you agreed with his
engagement. Did you not acknowledge hxs
authority then ? .. T
Mr. Weight? ln the whole conversation 1
had with him he seemed to he doubtful of it;
and till I heard from town I did not think X
had power to act. . , ~
The Hon. M. Hervey? But in your letter
dated December 19, you express your anxiety
to go on, and the reason you give for not doing
so is that your camels were too few, and insuf-
ficient in carrying power. On the last day the
commission met, you said you were kept be-
cause you wanted your appointment con-
firmed. How do you reconcile the one state-
ment with the other ? That question is still
unanswered. , ~
Mr. Wright. ?ln fact there were two
reasons. That we had not sufficient carrying
power was one thing, and another thing was?
The Hon. M. Hervey. ?We simply want
you to reconcile the two statements, because
in the first statement, you make no allusion
whatever to the second.
Mr. Wright.? l think you will find part of
it when I make mention of it. I wrote to ask,
if I was not sent, to send some one else.
The letter was then producedand carefully
read through by Mr. Wright and Mr. Haver-
fl(Mr Wright.? There is no mention of the
kind. The letter is not worded in the way I
intended at all.
The Hon. M. Hervey.? Can you reconcile
the two statements ? ~ .
Mr. Wright said he could give no answer
further than that he had given already. Ihe
despatch in question was written by Mr
Hodgkinson, and was worded very differently
from what he intended. . ~
The Hon. M. Hervey? lt is signed by your
na Mr.? Wright -Yes, it is. It was read over
to The Hon. M. Hervey.? Yoiir appointment
as leader made you virtually leader of all the
party left behind. Was not that appointment
made because Mr. Burke was satisfied that
you were able to take a party as far as 3 ou
accompanied him ? ... ... , ?
Mr. Wright. ?l believe he did think so.
The Hon. M. Hervey.? Do you suppose
Burke anticipated the detention ofyour party
at the Darling for two months ? Had he any
idea of the kind ? ,
Mr. Wright.? Certainly he had, because he
questioned me about the mail, and how long
it would take to send a despatch to the Dar-
ling. I mentioned a good deal of this to Mr.
Haverfield. ~ , .. ? ?.
The Chairman.? You don t mention it m
the despatch. , _
Mr. Wright said there were a good many
things he had not mentioned in the despatch.
The Hon. M. Hervey? But in the despatch
I mean, you evidently did not Intend to lose a
m S 61 Wright.? l intended to stop at Menin-
die till I got my appointment confirmed; ana
another reason was, that I was waiting for
Lyons and Macpherson.
The Hon. M. Hervey. ?Then, under any
circumstances, you would not have started
till your appointment was confirmed, even if
you had fifty horses and camels.
Mr. Weight. ? No, I should not. I should
have sent a despatch long before, had I
not waited for Lyons and Macpherson.
Letters were sent down by every mail, and
none of them were answered. In the first
place, Mr. Burke knew I should not start till
I had sent my wife and family home; and I
did not know how long the steamer would be.
The Chairman. ?How do you reconcile that
with the fact that Mr. Burke expected you up
two or three days after he left Cooper?s Creek ?
Mr. Weight.? l don?t see how he could ;
because he had to go from Torowoto, travel-
ing twenty or twenty-five miles a day, and I
had to go back and then overtake him.
The Hon. M. Hervey. ?By the statement
you just made, it would seem that Mr. Burke
was not aware of all your plans, and that you
could leave when you expected ?
Mr. Wright. ?He must have been aware of
all, for he told me over and over again that
some one might be sent up from Melbourne.
The Hon. M. Hervey. ?Then he must have
apprehended delay. Did he not express those
apprehensions.
Mr. Wright. ?No ? he did not, because he
mentioned sending down some of the camels
and horses back from Cooper's Creek. Mr.
Brahe told me several times that he was to be
one of the persons sent back.
The Hon. M. Hervey?D9 you consider
you have answered the question, and recon-
ciled the two statements ?
Mr. Wright made no reply.
The Hon. M. Hervey. ?l wish to point out
to you that if you do not answer that ques-
tion properly, you stand in a very awkward
position before the committee.
Mr. Weight still refrained from replying.
Sir Francis Murphy. ?Mr. King, I under-
stand you forgot to mention that on your first
visit to Cooper?s Creek after your return, you
left something there.
Mr. King came forward and said ?I was
the person who broke the bottle to get the
note out. I put the pieces of bottle on the
top of the stockade. I stuck them quite close
to where the provisions were placed, to the
best of my belief, about ten yards off. The
pieces were on the top of one of the planks?
that was to show as a record. Mr. Burke
changed his boots there. He took the old
I pair, and the pair left at the stockade also
I away with him. There is not an accordance
; between the first statement, and the remark
1 Mr Wright made just now, that Mr. Burke in-
! tended to send Mr Brahe back to Torowoto.
1 I think Mr. Wright was present when Mr.
Burke said he might have occasion to send
some man back at Cooper?s Creek or Eyre?s
Creek, or perhaps not at all.
Mr. Weight? What he told me was, that it
j was more than possible. He did not say he
would send any one.
Mr. King? l also wish to say something


about the party being provided with good books.
I have the pleasure to say that each of us had
a Bible and a prayer-book, and occasionally
read them both coming and going back, and
before the death of Mr. Burke, I am happy to
say he prayed to God for forgiveness in Christ.
Sir Francis Murphy.?We must all feel
that that is very satisfactory.
Mr. Brahe. ?Did you believe that I was to
he sent back from Cooper?s Creek after reaching
it, Mr. King?
Mr. King. ?l could not believe that, be-
cause ?
Mr. Brahe. ?Were you not all under the
impression that I was to go ?
Mr. King.? You were not told positively that
you were to go. If anybody was to go back
you were; that was what was understood.
Mr. Burke said, before all the party, that he
might have to send you back.
In answer to Mr. Sturt,
Mr. King said, ?I was one of those who
opened the cache. It was Mr. Wills and I who
did it. We restored it to its original state as
well as we could.
Mr. Sturt. ?Did you think it possible that,
after a fortnight, two persons could return,
and not notice that the cac/ichad been opened ?
Mr. King. ?lf it were the person who made
the plant, I think he should have been able to
notice that it had been opened. There was
no fresh cutting on the tree, but there were
fires, and anybody must have known that they
were the fires of Europeans. There were sev-
eral small heaps of ashes about the camp, and
any blackfellow who makes a fire always keeps
pushing the sticks towards the ashes.
Mr. Brahe. ?If both bum all their wood up,
how is any one to tell the difference ?
Mr. King. ?We left wood there, whereas they
stated we left no wood there. Wood was
scarce, and we had to bum up some of the
small stools the depot party had left. That
was not near the gunyah, which was thirty
five miles down the creek.
Mr. Sturt.? Did it not occur to you to leave
some trace or mark ?
Mr. King. ?We had no implements to cut
with. All we had were two lancets and the
blade of a knife. Mr. Burke never expected
the party to return so soon. It was suggested
amongst us to leave some mark, but Mr. Burke
said he saw no use in it, as the word ? Dig,?
would answer our purpose. At that time we
had every prospect of getting to Mount Hope-
less. We always had the expectation of find-
ing some one at the depot. Mr. Burke was
cooeying to the men he had left there when he
was about forty yards off. I have nothing else
to state unless it is that, if Mr. Landells is to
be examined, I should wish to defend Mr.
Burke?s character.
At the request of Dr. Wills, the Chairman
asked Mr. Brahe if Mr. Burke had not left a
portmanteau with him.
Mr. Brahe. ?It was a calico bag. I was
aware that it was Mr. Burke?s property. I
took it away with me to Menindie, because I
believe that Mr. Burke was as well supplied
with clothes as we were. I never thought he
would be in want of them.
Dr. Wills. ?Are you not aware just now,
that those clothes would have saved his life ?
Mr. Brahe.?l know a great many things
now that I did not know then. If I had
known then what I know now, I would rather
have perished than have left Cooper?s Creek.
The Chairman said he would read the follow-
ing letter from Mr. Howitt, in respect to Mr.
Brahe
? Melbourne, Dec. 7,1861.
? Sir, ?I have the honour to inform you that
Mr. Brahe has requested me to communicate to
you my opinion of him while with me on the
Contingent Exploring Party, and at the same
time I must say, that independent of this re-
quest, I had intended doing so before leaving
town, as a matter of justice to that gentleman.
? While with me I have found Mr. Brahe a
zealous and efficient second officer, and one on
whom I could place every confidence; and I
can say no more than that it is by Mr. Brahe?s
own wish that he does not accompany me
this time, and that it is a matter of regret to
me that I shall lose his services. I feel that I
could have left Mr. Brahe in charge during
my absence with perfect confidence.
? I have the honour to be,
? Your Obedient Servant,
? A. W. Howitt,
? Leader of the Victorian Exploring Party.
? E. R. Haverfield, Esq., secretary to the
? Royal Commission of Inquiry.?
In answer to a few other questions,
Mr. Brahe said he knew that M'Donough
was in charge of the camels that were lost dur-
ing the exploring expedition taken by Wills
and M?Donough from Cooper?s Creek. Mr.
Wills told him that the camels were lost by
M'Donough?s neglect. M?Donough said they
were at supper when the camels were lost, but he
(Mr Brahe) could not see how that could be,
as the custom was to take supper at six o?clock,
and it was quite dusk when the camels got
away. He had understood that Mr Wills was
writing at the time.
In reply to the chairman,
The Secretary said there was no chance of
getting Mr. Hodgkinson for some months, as
he could only be communicated with at great
expense.
Dr. Macadam wished to explain with refer-
ence to Mr Wright?s remark about the inferior
officers of the Expedition sending down des-
patches, that the original instructions to the
scientific officers were that notes, sketches and
other things, were only to be sent through the
leader, due credit being given to each officer.
After some time, they began to send in not
despatches, but diaries, and instructions were
again sent up to a contrary effect.
Mr. Sullivan. ?Your object was to show
the position of the party at Menindie ?
Dr. Macadam. ?Yes; that was my notion.
The Chairman asked if any one else would
volunteer evidence ?
No one replied.
The Chairman then adjourned the sittings
of the commission sine die. If further evidence
was forthcoming, due notice would be given.
