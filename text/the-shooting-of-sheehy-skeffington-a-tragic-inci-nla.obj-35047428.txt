THE SHOOTING OF
Sheehy-Skeffington
INTRODUCTION.
IRELAND?Iand of Sorrow and Suffering,
with your emblem of music, and song sad-
ness, with your turbulent sons and daughters
and unquenchable spirit of rebehion, one
more blood and tear-stained page has been
added to your history.
Whether the motives of the Dublin Rebel-
lion were right or wrong, wise or foolish there
were perpetuated on that day against the
inhabitants of Dublin outrages as diabolical
as any of the outrages which are reported to
have been committed by Germans. The
palpable attempt at white-washing the mur-
derers of Sheehy-Skeffington and others only
serve to disgust the fair-minded with the
colossal hypocrisy of governmental England,
who while shrieking of German baby-killers,
slaughters and murders her own kith and
kin. How many innocent men, women and
children were done to death during that four
days orgy will never be rightly known, as the
whole matter was hushed up with the most in-
decent quickness. One has to go back to the
Paris Commune to find a parallel for such
wholesale working-class massacre. If there
is one thing we can learn ifrom the sob-
bing protest which ascends to heaven from
that stricken country it is this that not until
there is a common understanding between
all workers of all countries will the brutality
of Governments and ruling classes be made
to fail.


Report of British Royal
Commission, 1916
�-3> ci>i<l ?
Reports 1 to 7 being the description
and locality of Portobello Barracks.
8. Mr. Sheehy-Skeffington was the first of the
three individuals to be arrested; his arrest had no
connection with the arrest of Mr. Dickson and Mr.
Mclntyre, which occurred some three hours later.
9. Mr. Francis Sheehy-Skeffington was a well-
known figure in Dublin, and shortly before 8 p.m.
on April 25 th he was walking from the city in the
direction of his home, which was situated at 1 I
Grosvenor Place, Rathmines. His way led over
Portobello Bridge, and about 350 yards further on
he would have passed the turning which leads to the
main entrance of Portobello Barracks.
10. It was conceded on all hands, before us that
Mr. Sheehy-Skeffington had no connection with the
rebellion; his views were opposed to the use of
physical force; and it appears that he had
been engaged that afternoon in making some
public appeal to prevent looting and the
like. Mrs. Sheehy-Skeffington gave evidence
of this fact, and her evidence is confirmed by
a document which was found on him when he
was searched, and which contained a form of mem-
bership of a proposed civic organisation to check
looting. As he approached Portobello Bridge he
was followed by a crowd, some of the members of
which were shouting out his name.
11. It was about dusk, and the disturbances had
now continued for some thirty hours. A young offi-
cer, named Lieut, M. C. Morris, who was attached
to the 3rd Battalion of the Royal Irish Rifles, at
Portobello Barracks, had taken up duty an hour
before in command of a picket at Portobello Bridge,
occupying premises at the corner known as Davy?s


public-house. His orders were to do his utmost to
avoid conflict, but to keep the roadway clear as far
as possible. Lieut. Morris heard people in the
street shouting out Mr. Sheehy-Skeffington's name,
and he determined to detain him and send him to
the barracks. Lieutenant Morris did not himself
leave his post for many hours afterwards. He sent
Mr. Sheehy-Skeffington, under an escort of two men,
to the barracks.
12. We consider that there is no good ground of
complaint against the action of Lieutenant Morris in
causing Mr. Sheehy-Skeffington to be detained and
sent to barracks. He told us that he had taken the
same course with one or two others who seemed
likely to cause a crowd to congregate; his picket had
been fired at from time to time from houses close by;
there was no police force in the streets; and it was
obviously better to require pedestrians who appeared
to be attracting notice to go to the barracks rather
than run the risk of altercations in the roadway. No
charge was made against Mr. Sheehy-Skeffington,
and he went quite willingly. Many other civilians,
against whom no charge was made, were sent, in the
course of the disturbances, to the barracks in similar
circumstances, and the fact that they were innocent
of all complicity in the rebellion does not necessarily
imply that their temporary detention cannot be ex-
plained or justified. The really important matter in
such cases is not tjie fact of detention, but the subse-
quent treatment of the individuals detained.
ARRIVAL AT BARRACKS
1 3. On arrival at the barracks, Mr. Sheehy-Skef-
fington was taken to the main guardroom; three
young officers, named Dobbin, Tooley, and Alexan-
der Wilson, were sharing duty there, Mr. Dobbin
being the senior of the three. Mr. Dobbin was
only eighteen years of age, having left school in the
previous year, and he had held his commission only
a few months; he had, at that time, seen nothing of
fighting. He and the other two second lieutenants
arranged among themselves spells of duty, and it
was not clearly established before us which of them
was in actual charge when Mr. Sheehy-Skeffington


was brought in. Sergeant Maxwell, who was in
the guardroom, was ordered to take Mr. Sheehy
Skeffington across to the orderly-room to be interro-
gated, and he was there interviewed by the Adjutant
of the battalion, Lieutenant Morgan, who is an offi-
cer of experience. Evidence as to this interrogation
is not quite precise or consistent, but witnesses agreed
that Mr. Sheehy-Skeffington stated that he was not
a Sinn Feiner, but that he was in favour of passive
resistance, and opposed to militarism. Since there
was no charge of any sort against Mr. Sheehy-
Skeffington, Lieutenant Morgan thought it best to
communicate by telephone with the Garrison Adju-
tant for instructions as to whether Mr. Sheehy-SkeL
fmgton should be further detained or not. Orders
having been received that he should be detained for
further inquiries, he was brought back to the guard-
room.
!4. Mr. Sheehy-Skeffington was searched by
Captain Bowen-Colthurst. This gentleman was an
officer of sixteen years? service. He belonged to the
Royal Irish Rifles, and had considerable experience
of warfare. He had been with his battalion of the
regiment at the Front, when he was seriously
wounded and invalided home. At the time of the
Dublin disturbances he was attached to the 3rd
Battalion, at Portobello Barracks. Having searched
Mr. Sheehy-Skeffington, Captain Bowen-Colthurst.
about 9 o?clock, handed over to the Adjutant what
he had found upon him. The Adjutant made
copies of these documents, and produced them
before us; they were few in number, and none of
them had anything to do with the disturbances save
the document already referred to, which was a draft
form of membership for a civic guard. There was
nothing of an incriminatory nature found on Mr.
Sheehy-Skeffington. When we come to deal with
the cases of Mr. Dickson and Mr. Mclntyre, it will
again be seen that nothing of consequence was found
upon them, and the absence of compromising docu-
ments in all three cases is, in the light of a report
subsequently made by Captain Bowen-Colthurst, a
fact of considerable importance.


15. Later, on the same evening, Captain Bowen-
Colthurst went out of the barracks in command of a
party under orders to enter and occupy premises at
the corner of Camden-street and Harrington-street,
occupied by Mr. James Kelly for the purposes of his
tobacco business. Mr. Kelly is an Alderman of the
City, and a Justice of the Peace, and had recently
held the office of High Sheriff of the City. There
is no question that the suspicion entertained against
Mr. Kelly?s loyalty was due to a misunderstanding #
and that Mr. Kelly was, in fact, quite innocent of
any connection with the outbreak. Mr. Kelly?s
premises are some 300 yards on the city side of
Portobello Bridge, and the route for Captain
Bowen-Colthurst?s party, therefore, lay from the
main gate of the barracks along the lane leading
into the Rathmines-road, and then along the Rath-
mines-road, over Portobello Bridge, past Davy?s
public-house.
ORDERED TO SAY HIS PRAYERS
1 6. Captain Bowen-Colthurst adopted the extra-
ordinary, and, indeed, almost meaningless, course of
taking Mr. Sheehy-Skeffington with him as a ?host-
age.? He had no right to take Mr. Sheehy-Skef-
fington out of the custody of the guard for this or
any other purpose, and he asked for no one?s leave to
do so. Captain Bowen-Colthurst?s party consisted
of a junior officer (Second Lieutenant Leslie Wil-
son) and about forty men. Before they left the
barracks Mr. Sheetiy-Skeffington?s hands were tied
behind his back, and Captain Bowen-Colthurst
called upon him to say his prayers. Lpon Mr.
Sheehy-Skeffington refusing to do so, Captain
Bowen-Colthurst ordered the men of his party to
take their hats off, and himself uttered a prayer, the
words of it, according to Lieutenant Wilson?s evi�>
dence, being: ?O Lord God, if it shall please Thee
to take away the life of this man, forgive him, for
Christ?s sake.?
1 7. The party proceeded from the main gate of
the barracks to the turning into the Rathmines-road,
where a shooting incident occurred which wd
thought it right to investigate, since Mr. Sheehy-


Skeffington was present, and since it was suggested
(though not proved) that it might have led to some
protest on his part, or might have had some bearing
upon his subsequent treatment. We find it impos-
sible to reconcile all the testimony given on this mat-
ter, but it was established that a youth named
Coade, with a friend, named Laurence Byrne, were
in the Rathmines-road when Captain Bowen-Colt-
hurst?s party came by. Captain Bowen-Colthurst
asked what business they had to be in thq road at
that hour, and warned them that martial law had
been proclaimed. The evidence as to what next
happened is not consistent, but there is no sugges-
tion that either of the young men showed any vio-
lence, and it was clearly established before us thalf
Captain Bowen-Colthurst shot young Coade, who
fell mortally wounded, and was subsequently taken
by an ambulance to the hospital in the barracks.
Lieutenant Leslie Wilson testified that Captain
Bowen-Colthurst fired with a rifle, but two civilian
witnesses?whose good faith there is no reason to
doubt?asserted positively that they saw Captain
Bowen-Colthurst (whose identity was unmistak-
able, since he is a man of exceptional stature) bran-
dish and fire a revolver. There was admittedly
other firing as Captain Bowen-Colthurst?s party
marched down the road, which Lieutenant Leslie
Wilson told us was for the purpose of securing that
people at the windows should keep indoors. The
evidence of the different witnesses can only be recon-
ciled by inferring that more than one case of shoot-
ing occurred during the progress of Captain Bowen-
Colthurst?s party.
1 8. None of the evidence offered to us afforded
any justification for the shooting of Coade; it is, of
course, a delusion to suppose that a proclamation of
martial law confers upon any officer any right to
take human life in circumstances where this would
have been unjustifiable without such a proclamation,
and this delusion in the present case had tragic con-
sequences.
19. On reaching Portobello Bridge Captain
Bowen-Colthurst divided his party into two, and


left half of it in the charge of Lieutenant Leslie Wil-
son, while going forward with the rest to attack
Alderman Kelly?s shop; he also left Mr. Sheehy-
Skeffington at the bridge, giving Lieutenant Leslie
Wilson orders that, if he (Captain Bowen-Colt-
hurst) and his men were knocked out, Lieutenant
Leslie Wilson was to take command, and if they
were fired upon Lieutenant was to shoot h4ir.
Sheehy-Skeffington.
BOMB THROWN
20. The advance party then went on its way,
and was absent about twenty minutes; they threw a
bomb into Alderman Kelly?s shop, and met with no
resistance there. Alderman Kelly was absent; Mr.
Mclntyre, who was a friend of Alderman Kelly, had
been on the premises some time, and Mr. Dickson,
who lived close by, took refuge there when he heard
the soldiers firing as they approached. Miss Kelly,
who is a sister of Alderman Kelly, gave us a de-
tailed account of the road on her brother?s premises;
it is evident, from her account, that Captain Bowen-
Colthurst was in a state of great excitement. Dick-
son and Mclntyre, together with two other men,
who were shortly afterwards released, were taken
into custody, and Captain Bowen-Colthurst returned
to barracks with them, picking up Mr. Sheehy-Skef-
fington and the other section of his party on the way.
21. Meanwhile, the news of Mr. Sheehy-SkeT
fington having been taken out of barracks reached
the ears of the Adjutant, who fixed the time when
he heard this from Sergeant Maxwell at about 1 0.20
p.m. The Adjdtant saw Llieutenant Dobbin, and
asked him for a written report; this document was
produced, and runs as follows:
?April 25th, 1 1.10 p.m.
?An armed party, under Captain J. C. Bowen-
Colthurst, has just passed through my guard, de-
manding and taking with him the last captured
prisoner, Sheehy-Skeffington.?
It is important to observe that the terms of this
document, while they show that Lieutenant Dobbin
realised that the prisoners were in his custody, and


under his control, record a 4 ?demand? made upon
him by an officer cf superior rank and vastly greater
experience. The report does not state that Cap-
tain Bowen-Colthurst was taking out Mr. Sheehy-
Skeffington as a ?hostage,? and both the Adjutant
and Lieutenant Dobbin assured us that they were
ignorant of Captain Bowen-Colthurst?s object.
22. Captain Bowen-Colthurst returned to
barracks he made a verbal report, in the presence of
the Adjutant, to Major Rosborough, in the course
of which, according to the Adjutant, he mentioned
that he had taken Mr. Sheehy-Skeffington with him,
and had arrested Dickson and Mclntyre. The
Adjutant was unable l to give us a fuller account of
the interview, and he had no recollection of any
reprimand being administered to Captain Bowen-
Colthurst. Major Rosborough himself had no
recollection of the interview at all, and explained
that he was working at great pressure, and under
extreme anxiety, and that whatever Captain Bowen-
Colthurst said it never conveyed to his mind that Mr.
Sheehy-Skeffington had been taken out in the way
and for the purpose described. Nothing was said
as to the shooting of Coade.
23. We are satisfied that the seriousness of the
irregularity committed by Captain Bowen-Colthurst
in his treatment of Mr. Sheehy-Skeffington on this
Tuesday night was not fully realised by those under
whose commands he was supposed to be acting.
Whether from the lateness of the hour, or from the
strain and anxiety caused by events outside the bar-
racks, and the apprehension of even greater trouble,
this officer was not effectively reprimanded, and the
civilians detained under the main guard were not
rendered more secure, with the result that Captain
Bowen-Colthurst was at liberty the next morning
again to override or disregard the officer of the
guard, and to deal with civilian prisoners as he
pleased.
24. Mr. Dickson and Mr. Mclntyre were
searched, but nothing material was found on them.
They spent the night in the detention-room, along
with some other civilians. Mr. Sheehy-Skeffington,


as being of a superior social position, was put into a
separate cell, and was made as comfortable as pos-
sible.
23. Mr. Dickson was the editor of a paper called
?The Eye-Opener,? and Mr. Mclntyre was the
editor of another paper known as ?The Search-
light.? So far as there was any evidence on the
point before us, it appears that the only reason for
arresting either of these men was the circumstances
that they were found on Alderman Kelly?s premises,
and, as we have already stated, the suspicion enter-
tained against this gentleman was without any foun-
dation. Mr. Dickson was a Scotchman, and de-
formed. Neither he nor Mr. Mclntyre had any
connection with the Sinn Fein movement.
26. On Wednesday morning, April 26th, the
officers in charge of the main guard were the same
as on the previous evening?namely, Lieutenants
Dobbin, Tooley, and Alexander Wilson. The ser-
geant of the guard was Sergeant John W. Aldridge,
then of the 1 Oth Royal Dublin Fusiliers. Sergeant
Aldridge was on leave at the commencement of the
rebellion, and on returning to Dublin reported him-
self (like many other soldiers at this time) at the
nearest barracks; he was, in consequence, new to
his surroundings at Portobello, and the officers at
the barracks were not known to him by sight. He
mounted guard at 9 a.m. on Wednesday morning.
27. Shortly after 10 a.m. Captain Bowen-Colt-
hurst came to the guardroom. He appears, on his
first arrival, to have entirely ignored Lieutenant Dob-
bin, who was standing in the barrack square, near
to the guardroom entrance, and having passed into
the guardroom itself, to have given his orders direct
to the sergeant. These orders were to the effect
that he required the three prisoners, Skeffington,
Dickson, and Mclntyre, in the yard for the purpose
of speaking to them. The yard in question is
within the guardroom block of buildings, being
reached by a short passage from the guardroom. It
comprises a space less than 40ft. in length, and some
15 ft. in width, and is surrounded by high brick
walls.


28. Sergeant Aldridge had not seen Captain
Bowen-Colthurst before, and was not aware of
what position he occupied in the barracks, save that
his uniform showed him to be a captain. Owing
to the sergeant having mounted guard only an hour
previously, he did not know who were the officers
of the guard, and there was, consequently, nothing
which appeared to him to be unusual in Captain
Bowen-Colthurst entering the guardroom and giving
orders. The orders were complied with. Mr.
Sheehy-Skeffington was called from his cell, and
Messrs. Dickson and Mclntyre from the detention-
room, and all three were ordered out into the yard,
which was but a lew paces away.
29. During the few moments that were occupied
by the calling out of the three prisoners, Captain
Bowen-Colthurst stepped out of the guardroom to
the spot where Lieutenant Dobbin was still standing,
and informed that officer that he was taking the three
prisoners out for the purpose of shooting them, as he
thought ?it was the best thing to do.? Lieutenant
Dobbin's recollection is not clear as to whether the
three men were mentioned by name, but there is no
doubt that their number and the purpose for which
Captain Bowen-Colthurst was taking them out were
distinctly conveyed to his mind. Captain Bowen-
Colthurst immediately re-entered the guardroom,
while Lieutenant Dobbin called to Lieutenant Alex-
ander Wilson, who was near by, and despatched him
with an urgent message to the Adjutant. Lieutenant
Wilson had his bicycle with him; he mounted it,
and rode off to the orderly-room, in which the Adju-
tant was working, and which is some 500 yards
distant from the guardroom.
30. Lieutenant Wilson's recollection of these vital
incidents has varied from time to time, but we think
there is no reason to question the sincerity of this
witness in ultimately arriving at a conclusion as to
what took place differing materially from his earlier
impressions. Erven so, his recollection of the
sage he delivered does not altogether agree with the
Adjutant?s memory on the point; the latter's version


is corroborated by the evidence of Sergeant Camp-
bell.
THE SHOOTING
31. Lieutenant Dobbin?s own statement is that
he told Lieutenant Wilson to inform the Adjutant
that Captain Bowen-Colthurst was taking the pri-
soners out of the guardroom. He does not recol-
lect stating in the message for what purpose they
were being taken out. We think it probable that
Captain Bowen-Colthurst?s purpose was present to
the mind of Lieutenant Wilson when he conveyed
the message, but we are satisfied that the message
itself, as received by the Adjutant, contained no
mention of the fact that the prisoners were about to
be shot. The impression made on the Adjutant?s
mind by the receipt of the message was that Cap-
tain Bowen-Colthurst was engaged in repeating his
irregular proceedings of the evening before, and the
message he returned by Lieutenant Wilson was
that Major Rosborough was out, that he (the Adju-
tant) could give no authority for any prisoners to be
taken out of the guardroom, and that in taking them
out Captain Bowen-Colthurst would be acting on his
own responsibility. Lieutenant "'Wilson returned
with this message on his bicycle, and while he was
giving it to Lieutenant Dobbin, just outside the
guardroom, the shots of the fatal volley rang out
from the adjoining yard.
32. When Captain Bowen-Colthurst returned
into the guardroom after his brief statement to Lieu-
tenant Dobbin, he ordered some of the guard, with
their rifles, out into the yard, where the three pri-
soners had preceded them. All the men on duty
had their magazines already filled, and seven of the
guard, who appear to have been merely those that
happened at the moment to be nearest the yard pass-
age, accompanied by Sergeant Aldridge, followed
Captain Bowen-Colthurst out into the yard. What
then occurred took place so rapidly that we have
little doubt that none of the three victims realised
that they were about to meet their death. We are
confirmed in this view by the fact that all the wit-
nesses, including civilian prisoners in the detention-


room to whom everything that took place in the yard
was audible, agree in stating that no sound was
uttered by any of the three.
33. While the soldiers were entering the yard,
Captain Bowen-Colthurst ordered the three prisoners
to walk to the wall at the other end, a distance, as
we have stated, of only a few yards. As they were
doing this, the seven soldiers, entering the yard, fell
into line along the wall adjoining the entrance, and
immediately received from Captain Colthurst the
order to fire upon the three prisoners, who had then
just turned to face them. All three fell as a result
of the volley. Captain Bowen-Colthurst left the
yard, and the firing party began to file out.
34. Immediately upon hearing the volley, Lieu-
tenant Dobbin (who was engaged in receiving the
Adjutant?s message outside) hastened through the
guardroom and entered the yard. On looking at
the bodies, he saw a movement in one of Mr.
Sheehy-Skeffington?s legs, which gave him the im-*
pression that life was not yet extinct, and he ex-
claimed to Sergeant Aldridge, who was still in the
yard, ?Sergeant, that man is not dead.? It is Ser-
geant Aldridge?s impression (and we are inclined to
accept the evidence of this, witness, who was both
experienced and candid) that death had, neverthe-
less, been instantaneous in all three cases, and that
what Lieutenant Dobbin saw was a muscular con-
traction of the unfortunate gentleman?s limb. As
a result, however, of what he saw, Lieutenant Dob-
bin despatched one of the other officers of the guard,
Lieutenant Tooley, to the orderly-room to report
and obtain instructions. At, or in the neighbour-
hood of, the orderly-room Lieutenant Tooley met
Captain Bowen-Colthurst, and received from him
the order to ?fire again.? Lieutenant Tooley re-
turned with this message, and thereupon four sol-
diers of the guard (not all members of the first firing
party) were ordered into the yard by Lieutenant
Dobbin, and upon his direcetions fired a second
volley into the body of Mr. Sheehy-Skeffington.
33. Certain civilian witnesses, who were in the
detention-room during the course of these events,


spoke to having heard a shot, or volley, in addition
to, and separated by a distinct interval of time from
the two volleys spoken of by the military. If their
evidence be correct (and there is no reason to doubt
their good faith) this third shot or volley was heard
at a moment antecedent to Messrs. Dickson and
Mclntyre reaching the yard, and the question was
raised by those appearing for the relatives of Mr.
Sheehy-Skeffington whether the latter had not been
shot separately from the other two prisoners. We
are quite satisfied, on the evidence as a whole, that
the three prisoners were shot together in the way we
have described, and that the earlier report heard by
those in the detention-room had no connection with
any shooting in the yard. It may, perhaps, be ex-
plained by the accidental discharge of a rifle in the
neighbourhood of the guardroom, which was the
impression conveyed to at least one of those in the
detention-room.
36. It should be clearly understood that the
events we have been recording, from the arrival of
Captain Bowen-Colthurst at the guardroom, occu-
pied but a very few minutes. The guardroom, de-
tention-room, detention-cells, and yard all closely
adjoin one another in the same block, and a very
few steps suffice to take a person from one into
another.
37. Not long after the shooting had taken place,
and before 10.30 a.m., Captain Bowen-Colthurst
reported verbally to the Adjutant at the orderly-
room that he had shot Mr. Sheehy-Skeffington and
the editors of the ?Eye-Opener? and the ?Search-
light.? Either then or later he gave as his reason
for so doing the fear that they would escape or
might be rescued by armed force. There was no
foundation whatever for any apprehension as to the
escape of these prisoners, and no sane person who
honestly entertained such a possibility as a rescue
would have seen in it any ground for distinction be-
tween these three prisoners and the other detained
persons. At or about the same time, Captain
Bowen-Colthurst verbally reported his action to
Major Rosborough, adding that he had shot the


three prisoners on his own responsibility, and that he
possibly might be hanged for it. Major Ros-
borough told him to make his report in writing, and
instructed the Adjutant to report the matter to the
Garrison Adjutant at Dublin Castle.
38. Lieutenant Morgan/ after going over to the
guardroom, and seeing the three bodies carried out,
telephoned, in accordance with his instructions from
Major Rosborough, a report of the circumstances, as
far as they were then known to him, to the Garrison
Adjutant (Captain Burton). A telephonic report
on other matters was about this time being made to
Headquarters, Irish Command, and, in view of the
seriousness of the occurrence, the Adjutant, under
Major Rosborough?s directions, did not confine him-
self to the usual channel, but also made a direct
communication by telephone to Headquarters, Irish
Command. Major Rosborough had, in the mean-
while, given directions that Captain Bowen-Colt-
hurst should not be detained for duty outside the
barracks. No further action was taken as regards
Captain Bowen-Colthurst until May 6th, when
orders were received from the superior military
authorities to place Captain Bowen-Colthurst under
open arrest. Major Rosborough?s directions as to
his duties do not seem to have placed any effective
check upon his movements in the meantime.
BURIED IN BARRACK TARO
39. Later in the day Lieutenant Morgan tele-
phoned again to the Garrison Adjutant in order to
ask for directions as to the disposal of the bodies
(which were lying in the mortuary), and was
ordered to bury them in the barrack yard that even-
ing. Lieutenant Morgan, accordingly, after con-
sultation with the medical officer, Major Balch, and
also the engineer officer, had the bodies wrapped up
in sheets and buried in the barrack square. It
should be remembered that, in the then state of the
city, coffins were difficult, if not impossible, to
secure, and the same mode of burial had to be
adopted in the case of soldiers whose bodies were
brought into the barracks. We are satisfied that
Lieutenant Morgan carried out his duties in con-


nection with the burial as decorously and reverently
as was possible in the circumstances at the time. He
ascertained that all three of the deceased were-
Roman Catholics; and the religious rites were car-
ried out by Father O?Loughlm, the Roman Catholic
chaplain of the barracks. At a later date, at the
request of the relatives, and by permission of Sir
John Maxwell (who had arrived in Ireland some
days after these shootings), the bodies of all three
men were exhumed and re-interred in consecrated
ground. IVlr. Sheehy-Skeffington, senior, was pre
sent at the exhumation of his son?s body.
40. From time to time during the course oi
Wednesday, April 26th, Major Rosborough pressed
Captain Bowen-Colthurst for the written report
which he had directed him to make; it was ulti-
mately received at a late hour in the afternoon, and,
so far as it is material to our inquiry, it reads
?Sirs,' ?I have to report for your information
that yesterday evening, about I I p.m., according
to your orders, I proceeded with a party or /.<3
men to Kelly?s tobacco shop in Har court-road.
?Some shots were fired at them, but whether
from this shop or not I cannot say. Fwo men
were seen standing in conversation outside ihe
shop, who at once bolted inside. An, entrance
was effected, and four men were made prisoners;
two of these were subsequently released, and two
men were detained. The two men detained were
Mclntyre, editor of the Searcnhght, and Dickson,
editor of the 'Eye-Opener. 1
?Sniping was going on, and I lodged the two
men detained in the Portobello guardroom. I
may add that I was informed that all of the to-
bacco had previously been removed. This morn-
ing, at about 9 a.m., I proceeded to the guaid-
room to examine these two men, and I sent for a
man called Skeffington, who was also detained.
?I had been busy on the previous evening up to
about 3 a.m., examining documents found on
these three men, and I recognised from these docu-
ments that these three men were' all very dan-
gerous characters. I, therefore, sent for an armed


guard of six men, and ordered them to load their
rifles and keep their eyes on the prisoners. The
guardroom was full of men, and was not a suit-
able place, in my opinion, in which to examine
prisoners. I ordered, therefore, the three pri-
soners to go into the small courtyard of the guard-
room. I regret now that I did not have these
three men handcuffed and surrounded, as the
yard was a place from which they might have
escaped. When I ordered these three men into
the yard I did not, however, know this. The
guard was some little distance from the prisoners,
and as I considered that there was a reasonable
chance of the prisoners making their escape, and
knowing the three prisoners (from the correspon-
dence captured on them the previous evening) to
be dangerous characters, I called upon the guard
to fire upon them, which they did with effect, the
three men being killed. The documents found
on these three men have been forwarded to the
orderly-room.?
41. It is to be noted that, although this report
purports to give an account of the raid on Alderman
Kelly?s tobacco shop, no mention is made of Mr.
Sheehy-Skeffington having been taken out as a
?hostage? on that occasion, or of the shooting of the
young man, Coade. The account of the events
which took place on Wednesday morning is entirely
untrue. Captain Bowen-Colthurst?s object in going
to the guardroom was not to examine the prisoners,
but, as he stated to Lieutenant Dobbin at the time,-
to have them shot. The armed guard was not
ordered out for the purpose of preventing the pri-
soners? escape, but for the purpose of shooting them.
There was no possibility of the prisoners making
their escape from the yard, a fact which is obvious to
anyone who has seen it. No documents or corre-
spondence whatever were found on the prisoners
which showed them to be ?dangerous characters,?
and any documents found on them could be thor-
oughly examined in a few minutes.
42. At a later date, and after he had been placed
under arrest ?viz., on May 9th, 1916, Captain


Bowen-Colthurst forwarded a further report, ad-
dressed to the Officer Gommandmg 3rd Battalion
of the Royal Irish Rifles. This report reads as
follows :? ?
?Sir, ?In accordance with your instructions, I
have the honour to forward for your information
a more detailed account of the circumstances con-
nected with the shooting of three rebels in Porto-
bello Barracks, Dublin.
?On Tuesday evening, 25th ultimo, I was
officially informed that martial law was de-
clared in Dublin. There were three leaders of
the rebels in the guardroom in Portobello Bar-
racks. The. guardroom was not safe for these
desperate men to be confined in ? their rescue
from outside would be very easy.
?On Tuesday, and up to Wednesday morning,
rumours of massacres of police and soldiers from
all parts of Dublin were being constantly sent to
me from different sources. Among others, the
rumour reached me that 600 German prisoners
at Oldcastle had been released and armed, and
were marching on Dublin. I also heard that the
rebels in the city had opened up depots for the
supply and issue of arms, and that a large force
of rebels intended to attack Portobello Barracks,
which was held only by a few troops, many of
whom were recruits ignorant as to how to use
their rifles, and a number of the others were sol-
diers and sailors who had taken refuge in the
barracks. 'W'e had also in the barracks a con-
siderable number of officers and men who had
been wounded by the rebels, and whose protec-
tion was a source of great concern to me. I be-
lieved that it was known that these leaders were
confined in ,the barracks, and that possibly the
proposed attack on the barracks was with a view
to their release. Rumours of risings all over
Ireland, and of a large German-American and
Irish-American landing in Galway, were preva-
lent. I had no knowledge of any reinforce-
ments arising from England, and did not believe
it possible for troops from England to arrive in


time to prevent a general massacre. I knew of
the sedition which had been preached in Ireland
for years past, and of the popular sympathy with
rebellion. I knew, also, that men on leave home
from the trenches, although unarmed, had been
shot down like dogs in the streets of their own
city, simply because they were in khaki, and I
had also heard that wounded soldiers home for
convalescence had been shot down also. On the
Wednesday morning, the 26th April, all this was
in my mind. I was very much exhausted and
unstrung after practically a sleepless night, and
took the gloomiest view of the situation, and
felt that only desperate measures would save the
situation. When I saw the position described in
my previous report I felt I must act quickly, and
believing I had the power under martial law, I
felt, under the circumstances, that it was clearly
my duty to have the three ringleaders shot. It
was a terrible ordeal for me, but I nerved myself
to carry out what was for me at the time a ter-
rible duty/?
43. So far as this second report repeats the pre-
vious explanation as to the shooting having taken
place with the object of preventing escape or rescue,
the observations we have already made on this point
apply to it. With the reference to martial law and
the powers which this officer claimed to exercise
under it, we deal in a later paragraph of this report.
He is at present, as was proved to our satisfaction,
confined in Broadmoor Criminal Lunatic Asylum,
consequent upon the sentence of a Court-Martial
(which found him guilty of murder, but insane at
the time of committing the crime), and we have,
therefore, felt ourselves debarred from taking his
evidence.
44. The disturbances continued throughout the
week, and on Friday (April 28th) Mrs. Sheehy-
Skeffington, who had last seen her husband in
Westmoreland-street on the previous Tuesday after-
noon, was still without definite information as t�'
what had happened to him. As a result of alarm-
ing rumours about him winch reached her from


various sources, her two sisters, Mrs. Culhanc and
Mre. Kettle, on the morning of Friday went to the
police station at Rathmines to make enquiries. The
police had no information to give, but suggested that
the two ladies might enquire at Portobello Bar-
racks, where they accordingly went.
45. To appreciate what followed it is necessary
to say a word as to Mrs. Sheehy-Skeffington and
her two sisters. They are the daughters of Mr.
David Sheehy, M.P. Their brother, Lieutenant
Sheehy, of the Dublin Fusiliers, was engaged in the
fighting which was still taking place in Dublin. The
husband of Mrs. Culhane, then recently deceased,
had been a highly-placed and responsible official in
the Irish Courts of Justice, while Mrs. Kettle?s hus-
band, Lieutenant T. M. Kettle (who since our
sittings has gallantly given his life for his country
in France) was with his battalion. In such cir-
cumstances, Mrs. Sheehy-Skeffington not unreason-
ably expected that, whatever fate had overtaken her
own husband, her two sisters would at least be
treated with candour and consideration at the bar-
racks, and would be able to obtain such informa-
tion as was available about their brother-in-law.
MRS. SHEFFINGT ON PLACED
ARREST
46. Mrs. Kettle and her sister arrived at the bar-
racks at about 1 p.m., and after some slight delay
were admitted past the first and second gates. A
junior officer, Lieutenant Beattie, came up to
enquire asi to their business. This gentleman was
not called before us, but as regards both this and
the subsequent events to which Mrs. Kettle and
Mrs. Sheehy-Skeffington speak, we were expressly
informed by those representing the military autho-
rities that the accuracy of the evidence given by
these ladies was not called in question. Indeed,
Lieutenant Beattie was present at the inquiry, and
we were told that his evidence was unnecessary,
since it could in no way controvert what Mrs.
Kettle stated. Mrs. Kettle and her sister thought
it well to commence their enquiries by asking, in ths
first place, as to their brother, Lieutenant Sheehy.


To this they received a courteous reply. They
then asked as to their brother-in-law, Mr. Sheehy-
Skeffington, whereupon the young officer with whom
they were conversing betrayed some confusion, asked
them to excuse him, and went away to consult with
some other officers. On returning, he informed
the two ladies that he regretted that he would have
to place them under arrest, giving as his reason that
they were Sinn Feiners, and had been seen speaking
to Sinn Feiners. Mrs. Kettle and her sister pointed
out the absurdity of the allegation, and referred to
the position of Lieutenant Kettle and of the late
Mr. Culhane; they were, however, placed in charge
of some soldiers, and marched across the barrack
square to the orderly-room, outside which they re-
mained standing, surrounded by soldiers, while a
consultation of officers appears to have taken place
within. After some minutes Captain Bowen-
Colthurst emerged from the guardroom and ques-
tioned them. They repeated their enquires as to
Lieutenant Sheehy and as to Mr. Sheehy-Skeffing-
ton. Captain Bowen-Colthurst, in reply to the
letter enquiry, said, ?I know nothing whatever
about Mr. Sheehy-Skeffington.? Mrs. Culhane
referred to some of the rumours which had reached
them, and Lieutenant Beattie, who was the only
other officer actually present at this interview, made
some remark to Captain Bowen-Colthurst in -an
undertone. Captain Bowen-Colthurst then said, ?I
have no information concerning Mr. Skeffiogton that
is available, and the sooner you leave the barracks
the better.? There was then an order given to
have the ladies conducted back, and, by Captain
Bowen-Colthurst?s direction, they were forbidden
to speak to one another. The guard was dismissed
at the gate, and the two ladies were conducted to
the tramway line by Lieutenant Beattie.
47. It is obvious to us that throughout the inci-
dents recorded in the last paragraph Lieutenant
Beattie acted under superior orders, and the evidence
satisfied us that the part he was called upon to play
was extremely distasteful to him.
48. About four o?clock in the afternoon of Fri-


day, after receiving her sisters? report of what had
just taken place in the barracks, Mrs. Sheehy-Skef-
fmgton got into touch with the father of the young
man, Coade, to whose death we have referred.
Father O?Loughlin, the chaplain of the barracks,
whom we have already mentioned, knew young
Coade as a member of the religious sodality of
which he (Father O?Loughlin) was spiritual direc-
tor, and at a meeting of which Coade had been
present on the night he met his death. The father
of Coade was informed of his son?s fate by? Father
O?Loughlin, and was permitted to visit the dead
body in the mortuary at the barracks. Here the
unfortunate man saw the body of Mr. Sheehy-Skef-
fington laid out beside that of his son, a fact which,
on Friday afternoon, he communicated to Mrs.
Sheehy-Skeffington. Mrs. Sheehy-Skeffington, on
Mr. Coade?s suggestion, at once sought out Father
O?Loughlin, and besought him for particulars as to
her husband. She was told that he was dead, and
already buried.
49. At 7 p.m. on this same Friday evening Mrs.
Sheehy-Skeffington was putting her little son, aged
seven, to bed, when a body of soldiers from Porto-
bello Barracks, headed by Captain Bowen-Colt-
hurst and Colonel Allett (an officer of advanced
years, who had returned to service after the out-
break of the war, and who was killed during the
later stages of the rebellion), arrived at the house.
Mrs. Sheehy-Skeffington was alone in the house,
save for her boy and a young maidservant. Before
any attempt was made to obtain an entrance into
the house a volley was fired through the windows.
A body of soldiers, with fixed bayonets, under Cap-
tain Bowen-Colthurst, then burst in through the
front door. No request for the door to be opened
was made, nor was any time given to those in the
house to open it. Mrs. Sheehy-Skeffington and
her boy had bayonets pointed at them, and were
ordered to hold their hands above their heads.
They were then, by orders of Captain Bowen-Colt-
hurst, placed in the front room, together with the
maidservant, and kept guarded while the house was
searched. All the rooms in the house were thor-


oughly ransacked, and a considerable quantity of
books and papers were wrapped up in the house-
hold linen, placed in a passing motor-car, and taken
away. Mrs. Shcehy-Skeffington has been herself
a teacher of foreign languages, while Mr. Sheehy-
Skeffington was at the time the editor of a paper
known as ?The Irish Citizen/' and a large part of
the material removed seems to have consisted of
text-books, both in German and other languages, as
well as political papers and pamphlets belonging to
Mr. Sheehy-Skeffington. The search lasted until
a quarter-past ten, when the soldiers departed. Mrs.
Sheehy-Skeffington, together with her boy and maid-
servant, remained under arrest up to that hour.
50. On Monday, May Ist, Mrs.
fington's house was again visited by soldiers be-
tween 1 1 a.m. and 1 p.m., but Captain Bowen-
Colthurst had nothing to do with this second visit.
Neither Mrs. Skeffington nor her boy were in the
house at the time, the only occppant being a tem-
porary maidservant, Margaret Farrelly by name, a
girl aged 19 or 20. Mrs. Skeffington's previous
servant had been terrified by her experiences o$ the
Friday, and had left, and the maid Farrelly had
been obtained from one of Mrs. Skeffington's sis-
ters. Sergeant Claxton told us that he received a
message, transmitted through the police, that an un-
known person had been seen entering the house.
Consequently, two soldiers, in charge of this ser-
geant, went there, and the maidservant was arrested
and taken to Rathmines Police Station. She was
detained until the following Saturday, when, by
the efforts of Mrs. Skeffington's sisters, her release
was effected. Nothing else appears to have taken
place on the occasion of this visit to the house.
51. Mr. Dickson's house at 12 Harrington-
street was visited by a military search party during
the course of Wednesday, April 26th, and a bag
with some documents in it was taken away, and
left temporarily with the picket, which was still
in occupation of Alderman Kelly?s tobacco shop
near by. It was suggested before us that this was
done with the object of attaching suspicion to Alder-


man Kelly, but we are satisfied that this was not the
case, and that the incident must be judged merely
as an ineffectual attempt to obtain evidence which
might justify or excuse the shooting which had
already taken place at Portobello Barracks.
52. Before the outbreak of the rebellion in Dub-
lin much attention had been attracted to a printed
pamphlet, entitled ?Secret Orders Issued to the
Military/' This pamphlet had been widely cir-
culated, with a view to creating the impression that
its contents represented the text of confidential direc-
tions issued by the military authorities with the
object of an attack upon the Sinn Fein organisation
and its supporters. The document was a forgery
from beginning to end, and the false representations
it contained as to the orders actually issued, no
doubt, played some part in precipitating the out-
break of the rebellion. A copy of this document
was produced before us, with the following note
attached to it in red ink, and in the writing of Cap-
tain Bowen-Colthurst :??l certify that I found this
document on the person of F, Sheehy-Skeffington.?
J. W. Bowen-Colthurst, Captain, R.1.R., Porto-
belio Barracks, 25/4/? 16.? Lieutenant Morgan,
who took a careful copy of all the documents found
on Mr. Sheehy-Skeffington on the night that he was
arrested, satisfied us that this document was not
among them, and, moreover, that it was not attached
to Captain Bowen-Colthurst?s report, written on
the day of the shooting. It is quite certain that
Captain Bowen-Colthurst added this document, to-
gether with the above note appended to it, to those
documents actually found on Mr. Sheehy-Skeffing-
ton at a later date than that which the note bears,
and that the certificate endorsed upon it was untrue.
The document itself was probably found by Cap-
tain Bowen-Colthurst at Mr. Sheehy-Skeffington?s
house at the search after his death, and the false
certificate was added later. It was conceded before
us that some copy of the printed document could
have hardly failed to have come into the hands of
any Dublin journalist. We think it right to state
explicitly that no other person is in any way impli-
cated in this misrepresentation, and the matter is


only of importance as a further instance of the
endeavours made by Captain Bowen-Colthurst,
after the event, to excuse his action.
STATE OI INSANITY
53. As a result of a communication to the mili-
tary authorities in London, made by Major Sir
Francis Vane (one of the many officers who had
reported at Portobello Barracks at the commence-
ment of the outbreak), Captain Bowen-Colthurst
was placed under u open arrest upon IVlay 6th,
and subsequently, on May I 1 th, under close
arrest. Major Sir Francis Vane was not an officer
of the regiment stationed at the barracks, and had
no responsibility for any of the events we have de-
scribed. On the 6th and 7th of June Captain
Bowen-Colthurst was tried by court-martial in Dub-
lin for the murder of the three men, and was found
guilty, but insane.
54. We have thought it formed no part of our
duty to conduct any inquiry of our own into the
state of Captain Bowen-Colthurst?s mind at the time
he committed the offence of which he has already
been found guilty, or to hear any evidence upon the
point. The court-martial pronounced on this
matter, and its conclusion is on record. Apart
from the defence of insanity, there can be no excuse
or palliation for his conduct from first to last, a state
*of things which was frankly recognised by those who
appeared before us on behalf of the military autho-
rities.
All which we humbly submit and report for your
Majesty?s gracious consideration.
