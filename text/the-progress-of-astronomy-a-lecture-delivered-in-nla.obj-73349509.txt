THE PROGRESS OF ASTRONOMY:
A LECTURE,
DELIVERED IN THE DUKE OF EDINBURGH THEATRE, ON THE
25th JULY, 1870,
R. L. J. ELLERY, ESQ.,
GOVERNMENT ASTRONOMER.
The Hon. Sir James M?Culloch presided, and introduced the Lecturer,
who said:?
In the year 1676, Charles the Second appointed Flamsteed to be the
? King?s Astronomical Obseryator,? at a salary of �IOO per annum. The
duties of the ?Astronomical Observator? were thus set forth: ??He is
to forthwith apply himself with the most exact care and diligence to the
rectifying the tables of the motions of the heavens and the places of the
fixed stars, so as to find out the so much desired longitude of places for
the perfecting the art of navigation.?
At this time the Greenwich Observatory had just been erected, and as
the building of the observatory and the appointment of Flamsteed mark
an epoch in the history of Astronomy, I propose to take this, one of the
few good acts which embellished Charles the Second?s reign, as the
starting point in my lecture.
To give us a fair start, however, it will be well to briefly review the
state of astronomical knowledge at this period, in order that we may more
readily estimate the progress subsequently achieved.
You will remember that, long before this, the older theories of the
universe had been cast aside, and the solar system as we now know it
firmly established. The rotation of the earth had been proved, though
even at that time questioned by some philosophers. The planets Mercury,
Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn were well known, and Kepler had
enunciated his three great laws of planetary motions, whose correctness
Newton afterwards tested, proved, and from them deduced his theory of


gravitation. These laws were ?Ist, That the planets move in ellipses,
having the sun for one of the foci; 2nd, They describe equal areas in
equal times; and 3rd, That the squares of their periodic times are
proportional to the cubes of their mean distances from the sun.
The last law gives us the means for deducing the relative distances of
the planets from the sun from the time they occupy in making a complete
circuit of their orbits ; for example ?if the sun?s distance from the earth
be taken as the unit, that from Venus will be found to be seven-tenths
of this unit, and Mars one and a-half times.
The four satellites of Jupiter had been discovered by Galileo, and one
of Saturn by Cassini; Huygens had also discovered the ring surrounding
Saturn ; and it had been shown that Venus, Mars and Jupiter rotated on
their axes. Telescopes had been invented since 1608; Gregory made
his first reflecting one in 1663, and Newton his in 1669. Clocks and
spring watches had also been introduced. Charts of the heavens had
been constructed, as well as tables of the approximate motions of the
moon and other heavenly bodies; and successful efforts had been made
to determine with more precision than had before been attempted the
figure and dimensions of the earth, by the measurement of certain lengths
of meridians by Norwood, Picard and La Hire.
Before referring to the astronomical instruments in use at this time,
it will be well to point out that they may be classed under three heads.
First, those which enable us to bring distant objects near to us, so as to
render their form, features, and peculiarities visible; second, instruments
by which the angular separation of one body from another can be
measured; and third, instruments by which time can be measured.
The first class simply comprises telescopes of various forms; the
second class depends upon the subdivision of the circle into parts ?into
degrees, minutes, and seconds. One of the oldest astronomical instru-
ments of this kind was the astrolabe, a divided circle, about whose centre
revolved an arm, carrying sights or pins; its extremities pointing to
different divisions on the circle, as the sights were pointed in different
directions. The complete circle afterwards gave place to portions of a
circle more accurately graduated, such as a fourth or sixth part of a circle
called quadrants and sextants, forms of which have continued in use up
to the present day. The third class, for measurement of time, you are
familiar with in the form of the exquisite clocks and watches which are
now so common. At the time lam now speaking of, however, although
the old methods of measuring time by clepsydras or water clocks, sand
glass or ? rush lights,? had been entirely superseded for astronomical
purposes, the clocks and watches were of a most homely description.
During the observatorship of our first Astronomer-Royal, Flamsteed,
the instruments used consisted principally of large sextants and quadrants,
which had already been greatly improved by the substitution of telescopes
for the simple tubes and sights hitherto used, and by the more careful
graduations of their circular arcs. These instruments were very large
compared to those of the same class now in use, and frequently occupied
the whole wall of a large room, or even the whole side of a large house
?as in the case of Tycho Brahe?s mural quadrant at Copenhagen?and
it is somewhat amusing to compare these gigantic instruments with this


small pocket sextant, more especially when we consider that this little
apparatus is capable of giving better results than its big forefather at
Copenhagen.
The reluctance exhibited by astronomers and navigators, at this time,
to adopt new inventions, was remarkable. We find that the substitution
of ? optical glasses,? or telescopes for plain sights in the large sextants
and quadrants, was strongly opposed by some of the most celebrated
observers. Hevelius, for instance, in writing concerning his astronomical
observations, about this time, says:?? But this I am convinced of, that
if I had undertaken the business by means of telescopic sights, I must
not onjy have wasted many years in fruitless examinations, but I should
doubtless have been disappointed of my hopes, and that on various
occasions, not necessary here to mention.?
It is worthy of note that, in the appointment of Flamsteed, he was
directed ? to set himself to the rectifying the motions of the heavens
and the places of the fixed stars, so as to find out the so much desired
longitude of places.? One of the principal objects of the establishment
of Greenwich Observatory was to facilitate navigation ?an object that
has been faithfully kept in view and assiduously followed up from the
time of its foundation to the present day.
The progress of the art of navigation had for a long time been
retarded, from the difficulty of determining the longitude at sea. Several
methods had been propounded, but owing to the insufficient knowledge
of the true places and motions of the heavenly bodies, and defective instru-
ments, it had not yet been possible to put them in practice.
These methods resolved themselves into observations for determining
the moon?s motions with respect to the stars, or to transport of the true
local time of the point of departure from place to place ; the first requir-
ing angle-measuring instruments and tables of the moon?s place and
motions, and the second accurate time-keepers or chronometers.
Longitude is, in fact, the difference of local times between any two
places at the same moment; so that if we can carry a clock or watch set
to, and keeping true Melbourne time, to Adelaide, we should find that it
did not correspond to Adelaide time. When the watch showed twelve
o?clock, it would only be llh. 34m. 275. there. This difference is a
measure of the difference of longitude; multiply it by 15, and it gives the
difference in degrees, minutes and seconds. Melbourne time is faster than
that at Adelaide, and therefore Melbourne is east of Adelaide 6� 23' 15".
If, instead of Adelaide, we took the watch to Sydney, we should find the
difference to be 25 min. 56 sec., but the other way. Sydney time would
be faster than Melbourne, showing Sydney to be east of Melbourne.
This will give, you a notion of what is meant by longitude: every
method for obtaining it resolves itself into ascertaining the difference
between the times at the place whose longitude you wish to determine,
and that at the standard or starting point, for which Greenwich is now
almost universally used. The time at your starting point (or Greenwich)
can be kept by means of good timekeepers, or it may be found by careful
astronomical observation of the moon?s place, and comparing this with
tables showing what her place will be at certain hours of time at the
starting point; the local time is readily determined by observation and


simple calculation ?thus the differences of local times, and hence the
ongitude, can be found.
But, as I have already stated, neither the instruments available nor the
knowledge of the moon?s motion were sufficiently accurate to allow of
these methods being satisfactorily practised in the year 1675 ; hence the
great and principal object for the foundation of Greenwich Observatory?
? the finding out the so much desired longitude of places.?
The method of finding longitude by observing the moon?s place, by
getting her distance from known stars, was proposed many years before,
but could not be carried into practice on account of the inaccurate lunar
tables. The method of transport of time had already been tried by
Huygens; and it was during his first trials to overcome the difficulty
presented to the good going of his timekeepers by the violent motion of
a ship at sea, that he fell upon the discovery of the isochronous spring,
with which he made afterwards his pendulum watches, and which is the
same that is now used in our watches and chronometers. Huygens par-
tially succeeded, but found that to render his timekeepers sufficiently
reliable, it would be necessary to devise some greatly improved mechan-
ism by which the irregularities in them, brought about by changes of
temperature, could be overcome.
It will be interesting to show with how much more precision the
longitude could be determined with Huygen?s primitive and uncom-
pensated ? pendulum watch ? (as he styled it,) than by the methods
already in use, and to do this I cannot do better than give you an abstract
from a paper communicated to the Royal Society of London in the year
1665, by a Major Holmes. He states that in one of his voyages to Guinea,
he had given into his care, by some of the grand promoters of navigation,
two of M. Huygens? ?pendulum watches,? ?that after leaving the coast
of Guinea, and ? being come to the Isle of St. Thomas, under the line,
he adjusted his watches, put to sea, and sailed westward seven or eight
hundred leagues, without changing his course ; after which, finding the
wind favourable, he steered towards the coast of Africa N.N.E., but,
having sailed upon that line about two or three hundred leagues, the
masters of other ships under his conduct, apprehending that they should
want water before they could reach that coast, did propose to him to
steer their course to the Barbadoes, to supply themselves with water
there. The Major having called the master and pilots together, and
caused them to produce their journals and calculations, it was found that
those pilots differed from the Major in their reckonings, one of them
eighty leagues, another about a hundred, and the third more ; but the
Major judging by his pendulum watches that they were only some thirty
leagues distant from the Isle of Fuego, which is one of the isles of Cape
Verde, and that they might reach it next day, and having a great
confidence in such watches, resolved to steer their course thither; and
having given order so to do, they got, the very next day about noon, a
sight of the said isle of Fuego, finding themselves to sail directly upon
it, and so arrived at it that afternoon as he had said.?
Another method for finding the longitude had also been proposed.
Jupiter was known to have four satellites, and it had been observed
that these were frequently eclipsed, disappearing suddenly by entering


within the planet?s shadow as they revolved around him. It was
proposed that these occurrences, the times of which could be predicted
with moderate precision, should be observed at sea, and the local time
compared with the predicted time at the starting point. To observe
these eclipses a steadily supported and powerful telescope is required,
and although this might be secured on land, it could not on shipboard ?
the method, therefore, was impracticable for use at sea.
I think I have now briefly touched upon the most important points in
connection with the state of astronomy at the date I start from. But
before we leave our first Astonomer-Royal Flamsteed, I will give you a
rather amusing anecdote concerning him, taken from Reliquce Hearniarus,
and given in Chambers?s Booh of Days: ?? He was weakly and unhealthy
in childhood. His father, a maltster at Derby, set him to carry out malt
in a brewing pan, which he found a very tiresome way of effecting his
object; so he set to and made a wheelbarrow to carry the malt. The
father then gave him a larger quantity to carry, and young Flamsteed
felt the disappointment so great that he never after could bear the
thoughts of a wheelbarrow. Many years after, when he reigned as
Astronomer-Royal in the Greenwich Observatory, he chanced once more
to come into unpleasant relations with a wheelbarrow. Having one day
spent some time in the Ship Tavern with two gentlemen artists of his
acquaintance, he was taking a rather ceremonious leave of them at the
door, when, stepping backwards, he plumped into a wheelbarrow. The
vehicle immediately moved off down-hill with the philosopher in it; nor
did it stop till it had reached the bottom, much to the amusement of the
bystanders, but not less to the discomposure of the Astronomer-Royal.?
Whilst our Royal Observator was ? applying himself with exact care
and diligence rectifying the places and motions of the heavenly bodies,?
and constructing his star catalogues and charts, the famous Halley took a
voyage to St. Helena in order to obtain a catalogue of southern stars,
which could not be seen by northern astronomers. It was he who, out
of compliment to Charles 11., formed a new constellation of some southern
stars which he called Bobur Carolinum, or Charles?s Oak, in commemora-
tion of the well-known tree in which the King (then Prince Charles) took
refuge after the Battle of Worcester.
Whilst at St. Helena, Halley witnessed the transit of Mercury across
the sun?s disc. You will remember that both Mercury and Venus are
inferior planets, having their orbits between us and the sun; they are,
therefore, liable in their orbital motion to pass between the earth and the
sun, appearing to move across his disc like a small round black spot; and
such occurrences are called transits.
That such phenomena did sometimes occur had long been known, and
the times of some had even been predicted by Kepler?a transit of Mer-
cury in 1631 for instance?which was the first really observed with cer-
tainty. A Parisian astronomer named Gassendi thus quaintly describes
the event: ?? The crafty god had thought to deceive astronomers by
passing over the sun a little earlier than was expected, and had drawn a
veil of dark clouds over the earth in order to make his escape more
effectual. But Apollo, acquainted with his knavish tricks from his
infancy, would not allow him to pass altogether unnoticed. To be brief,


I have been more fortunate than those hunters after Mercury who have
sought the cunning god in the sun; I found him out, and saw him where
no one else had hitherto seen him.?
The first time the transit of Venus was observed was in 1639 by Mr.
Horrox, a clergyman in Lancashire. This is what he tells of it. He began
his observations at sunrise, and continued them to the hour of church
service (it was Sunday.) As soon as he was again at leisure?that is to
say, at 3.15 p.m. ?he resumed his labours, and, to quote his own words :
?? At this time an opening in the clouds, which rendered the sun dis-
tinctly visible, seemed as if Divine Providence encouraged my aspira-
tions; when, O most gratifying spectacle, the object of so many earnest
wishes, I perceived a new spot of unusual magnitude, and of a perfectly
round form, that had just wholly entered upon the left limb of the sun,
so that the margin of the sun and spot coincided with each other, form-
ing the angle of contact.?
The occurrence of the transit of Mercury, which he observed at St.
Helena, suggested to Halley the possibility of using like occurrences for
the solution of one of the greatest problems in astronomy, and the basis
of all celestial measurements ?the distance of the sun from the earth.
The means of ascertaining the relative distances of the planets from
the sun had been given to astronomers by Kepler?s Third Law, so if the
absolute distance of any one could be found, the rest would follow,
Halley perceived that the parallax of the planet might be found by the
apparent alteration of the position of its path across the sun?s disc, due
to observers being placed at widely different parts of the earth?s surface.
By the word parallax, I mean the angle that would be subtended, at
the planet, by the earth?s diameter. Determining the parallax is equi-
valent to finding the distance of an inaccessible object by means of a
triangle, the base of which, in this case, is the earth?s diameter, the two
angles being obtained from observation. Now, Venus being nearer to
the earth than Mercury, her parallax is greater, and consequently the
separation of her apparent path across the sun would be greater in pro-
portion. The transits of Venus, therefore, were considered by Halley to
present far more favourable conditions for the desired determination than
those of Mercury.
The transits of Mercury are comparatively frequent: for instance,
there will be thirteen in the present century, while those of Venus occur
very seldom ?not more than twice in a century, ?and Halley scarcely
dared to hope he would live long enough to put his suggested method
in practice, for it was then the year 1677, and there would be no transit
of Venus till 1761, a space of eighty-four years. He, however, addressed
to future astronomers a most earnest exhortation that such ? precious
occasions should not pass unprofited,? and urged them to unite all their
efforts to deduce on this and similar occasions one of the most important
elements of our system, the distance of the sun. How this request has
been fulfilled, we shall presently see.
The determination of the parallax of Mars ?the planet next to the
earth in order of distance from the sun ?has also been used for finding
the sun?s distance. This planet being ? superior,? never transits the sun;
a different mode of observation is therefore necessary. When in oppo-


sition, its position with reference to that of well-known fixed stars is
measured at two widely different parts of the earth's surface.
Halley was the first astronomer to actually compute the orbit of a
comet, and predict its return ?(the method for doing this had already
been indicated by Newton, in 1680, after the appearance of the great
comet of that year.) Among the orbits of about twenty-four comets,
which he calculated, he found those of 1531, 1607, and 1682 so nearly
alike?in each case the inclination to the ecliptic was about 17�, the peri-
helion distance about 48,000,000 of miles, and the motion retrograde,
while the other elements were equally similar; and, moreover, just about
seventy-five years had elapsed between each successive appearance?that
he at once concluded they were one and the same comet returning
periodically to perihelion. He felt so confident of this that he predicted
it would return again in 1758. His age at this time?l7os?was forty-
nine ; he did not expect to reach the age of one hundred and two years;
he therefore appealed to posterity that if the comet should really return
about that time, not to lose sight of the fact that the prediction of such a
result was due to an Englishman. As the period drew nigh, astronomers
throughout the civilised world were on the watch to test the value of his
calculation and predictions
On the 25th December, 1758, a farmer and amateur astronomer in
Saxony, named Palitsch, -discovers a comet; it was Halley?s comet. It
came back again in 1835 (and was the first comet I ever saw,) and will
probably do so again in 1910. This fulfilled prediction marks another
epoch in astronomy ;* and, remembering Halley?s appeal, posterity of all
nations has not, and is not likely, to forget that this great triumph was
Halley?s, and that Halley was an Englishman.
We will now pass over the next fifty-eight years, which brings us to
the year 1800. In these fifty-eight years astronomy had not slept.
Flamsteed and his successors ?Halley, Bradley, and Bliss, ?as well as
various celebrated Continental astronomers, had so faithfully attached
themselves to the work for which the Greenwich Observatory was
established, that the places and motions of the moon, stars, and planets,
were now known Avith very considerable precision, and reliable tables of
these were published. The art of navigation had therefore advanced
considerably, and the great problem of obtaining the longitude at sea
had been, to a great extent, solved. All these astronomers, however,
had now gone to rest, and Maskelyne was ? Royal Observator.? The
immortal Newton had closed his great career in 1727, and the glorious
results of his labours placed Astronomy the highest among the exact
sciences, and gave an impulse to it and other branches of Natural
Philosophy which will never cease to be felt.
One of our greatest of the Greenwich, and of all astronomers, had
come and gone in this interval. Bradley succeeded Halley in 1742,
worked well for twenty years, and died in 1762. It was Bradley who
discovered the aberration of light, and the nutation of the earth?s axis?
an example of the one being the amount by which the apparent position
of a star differs from its real one, in consequence of the combined motion
* Halley died in 1742, and was succeeded as Astronomer-Royal by Bradley.


of the spectator (resulting from the earth?s rotation), and of the light
emanating from the star; and the other a small irregularity in the earth?s
motion, caused by lunar gravitation?both affecting the positions of
heavenly bodies, as determined from observation, to an extent, if un-
eliminated, that would render them very inaccurate. Bradley also initiated
and prosecuted a system of observation, which will compare in precision
with that of the present day. With Bradley?s observations commenced
a new era in astronomy.
In this interval, too, Dollond invented the Achromatic Telescope, and
Hadley the Nautical Quadrant- Harrison also gains the parliamentary
reward for the perfection of his chronometer. The Nautical Almanac
was first published in 1767. The transits of Venus, both of 1761 and
1769, were observed. Herschell (Sir W.) discovers the new planet
Uranus, and erects his great forty-feet reflecting telescope at Slough,
near Windsor. Large observatories had been erected at Berlin and St.
Petersburgh. Dollond?s new invention of making telescopic object glasses
achromatic, rapidly led to a very great improvement in all classes of astro-
nomical instruments; and the old mural quadrants were replaced by transit
telescopes and mural circles. Abbe La Caille had been to the Cape of
Good Hope, measured an arc of the meridian there, observed and catalogued
a large number of southern stars with great precision ; and Sir William
Herschell had discovered that the Milky Way was separable into stars.
I will now draw your particular attention to three of these ? signs of
progress ,? and in the first place show how Halley?s suggestions with re-
spect to the future transit of Venus were attended to.
The first transit after Halley?s death was in 1761. To observe it,
astronomers were sent out to different parts of the globe by the English,
French, and other European Governments; and Maskelyne, who after-
wards succeeded Bradley at Greenwich, went to St. Helena. With one
exception, however, all these observers were unfortunately more or less
disappointed; cloudy weather appeared to prevail at every one of the
stations selected, except at the Cape of Good Hope, where Mr. Mason
observed all the phases successfully. At Greenwich and several other
places in England it was also satisfactorily observed. The parallax of the
sun resulting from these observations was eight seconds and a half, which
would give the sun?s distance as about 96,000,000 miles.
The next transit took place in June, 1769 ; and it was on this occasion
that George HI. despatched, at his own expense, a well-equipped expedi-
tion to Tahiti, under the command of that celebrated navigator Captain
Cook. The phenomenon was successfully observed in both hemispheres,
and the parallax resulting was 8" 58?equivalent to a distance of
95,023,000 miles.
We find, therefore, that Halley?s request was not forgotten, and that
the results fully justified his anticipations. The great problem of the
sun?s distance was far nearer its solution than it ever had been ; and this
determination was accepted as perfectly trustworthy until later years,
when circumstances arose indicating that it required even further correc-
tion. To this I shall presently refer.
The next transit of Venus will take place four years next December
(December 1874,) which will be followed by another in 1882.


The improvements in the methods of obtaining the ? much desired
longitude ? during the period under review are worthy of remark, and a few
moments? attention; for on two or three of them depends, in a very great
measure, the state of almost perfection to which the art of navigation has
now arrived. I refer to the invention of Hadley?s Quadrant (1731,)
Harrison?s Chronometer (1765,) and the publication of the Nautical
Almanac in 1767.
From what I have already told you concerning the methods of obtain-
ing longitudes at sea, you will understand that at my last stage the great
desiderata were ?more accurate time-keepers, more convenient, and
precise angle-measuring instruments for sea use, and more correct tables
of the places and motions of the heavenly bodies, and especially of the
moon.
The mode of determining the longitude by lunar distances had for a
long time been advocated by the most eminent astronomers. The difficul-
ties were the want of good instruments available at sea, and of tables of
the moon, to obviate the necessity of mariners having to compute her
place at each observation ?a difficulty that put an almost insuperable bar
to its adoption. The invention of Hadley supplied the first want ad-
mirably ; and Maskelyne soon after met the other by inducing the Board
of Longitude to publish annually a nautical ephemeris, containing the
places of the sun and moon for eveiy twelve hours, and the distance of
the latter from the principal fixed stars. Hadley?s quadrant, the ancestor
of our present beautiful sextant, is an instrument with a graduated
arc, as in the old quadrants, but which by means of one fixed and one
movable mirror enables the observer to reflect the images of two stars or
objects, so as to appear in coincidence. The movable mirror is attached
to an arm that traverses the graduated arc, the amount of movement
necessary to bring the object into coincidence measures their angular
separation, and the angular distance between the moon, and the sun, or a
fixed star, when corrected by a careful calculation, gave, by the help of
the lunar tables, the mean time at Greenwich; and this, compared with
the local time at the place, at once furnished the desired longitude.
In the year 1714 the British Parliament passed an act holding out
a great recompense to those who should contribute to the discovery
of the longitude at sea?namely, �IO,OOO if the longitude were found
within a degree, �15,000 if within forty minutes, and �20.000 if within
half a degree. These magnificent rewards produced the desired ( ffect.
John Harrison, a man of humble origin but great genius, devoted a long
and laborious life to the construction of clocks and watches for navigation.
So numerous and important were his improvements that we may with
justice consider him the inventor of the marine chronometer. It will,
perhaps, give the best idea of his merits to say that he has done as much
for this instrument as James Watt for the steam engine. In 1749 he ob-
tained the Copley medal of the Boyal Society, and in 1761 obtained from
the Commissioners of the Board of Longitude a trial of his chronometer
by a voyage to Jamaica. It was found at the end of sixty-one days that
his chronometer gave the longitude of Port Royal within five seconds of
time ; and on the return to England, after an absence of 161 days, the
whole variation was only one minute five seconds. It was evident that


the conditions of the Act of Parliament were satisfied, and Harrison re-
ceived a payment, on account, of �SOOO ; but the Commissioners decided
that the remainder of the reward should not be paid till a second trial had
taken place. This was executed in 1764, and crowned with complete suc-
cess. It was decided unanimously by the Board of Longitude that the
longitude of Barbadoes had been determined within the limits prescribed
by the Act. �SOOO was immediately granted to him, and �IO,OOO more
when he had explained to Commissioners appointed for the purpose the
details of his construction. This took place in 1765.
It is somewhat remarkable that an impression is still extant with some
people that the reward above referred to has yet to be claimed. This
country, like all others, has its inventors and men of one idea; and the
amount of correspondence I have received during the last twelve or fifteen
years from this class of individuals would scarcely be credited. Not a few
among these correspondents are inventors of nautical instruments or new
methods of finding the longitude at sea, and until enlightened to the con-
trary have usually persevered in their frequently chimerical efforts, in the
hopes of gaining the reward Avhich was long ago given to Harrison,
The renowned name Herschell first appears upon the records of
astronomical progress, in the period I am now referring to.
William Herschell (afterwards Sir William,) a self-taught but able
astronomer, who had for a long time been engaged in constructing reflect-
ing telescopes of great perfection and considerable dimensions, to enable
him to pierce deeper into the mysteries of space, while engaged on the
evening of the 13th March, 1781, in observing some stars in the con-
stellation Gemini, noticed one that appeared different in character to the
rest; the excellence of his telescope admitting of the use of eyepieces
magnifying several hundred times, he found that the diameter of this object
increased and assumed a well marked disc-like form, as he increased the
power, while that of the fixed stars around it remained unaltered. At first
he thought it was a comet, and communicated the discovery to Maskelyne
and others, and in the course of two or three months it had been seen by
nearly all the European astronomers; it was some time, however, before
it could be decided whether it was a comet or planet, although its
defined planetary appearance led most astronomers to believe it was the
latter. Lexell was the first to show that its orbit about the sun was
nearly circular, and it was therefore a planet, not a comet.
Herschell, the discoverer, named the planet Georgium Sidus, in honour
of the King, George HI., from whom he had received great and liberal
encouragements; but this name did not meet with much favour among
Continental astronomers. The famous Laplace suggested it should be
called after Herschell himself, but the other planets having received
mythological names, it was ultimately agreed to call it Uranus, which
in the Greek fables is the name of the father of Saturn, as the latter is
of Jupiter.
In 1787, Herschell completed his great forty-feet reflector, the first
of Brobdignagian telescopes (the last is in Melbourne;) with it he dis-
covered two satellites of Uranus?Oberon and Titania. In 1789 he
discovers two more satellites of Saturn?s system, Mimas and Euceladus:
and also suspects the existence of two more satellites in the Uranian


system; and in 1798 he announces the discovery that the satellites
of this planet revolve around him in an opposite direction to that of the
satellites to other planets.
While on the subject of this planet, I might mention that it has
generally been accepted that Uranus has eight satellites, six of which
were found by Herschell, but Mr. Lassels states emphatically, after a long
series of observations with his grand reflector, that there are only four,
or if there are more they remain yet to be discovered. The revolution of
Uranus about the sun occupies about eighty-four of our years. Its diameter
is about 33,000 miles, and its distance from the sun about nineteen times
that of the earth from the sun.
We will now put on our astronomical ? seven-league boots,? and pass
on to the year of grace 1870, and look back on the results of astronomical
research during the last seventy years. It is unfortunate, however, that
as I come to the thickest of my work, I become sensible that I am
approaching nearer and nearer to the end of your patience.
Towards the beginning of this period the first of a series of discoveries
was made by Piazzi and Gibers, which promises to be almost inexhaus-
tible, so long as the perfection of telescopes increases in proportion.
I refer to the planetoids. The first of these, Ceres, was discovered
by Piazzi, in 1801; Pallas was discovered by Gibers in 1802; Juno in
1804, by Harding; Vesta'in 1807, by Gibers; and so on, till these small
members of the solar family number 109.
It had been long noted that there was a wide space between the orbits
of Mars and Jupiter, and that there was a certain regular gradatory
distance between the orbits of the other planets in some manner propor-
tional to the distance from the sun. This regular order was, however,
broken for want of a planet to fill this gap in the system, until the first
planetoid Ceres was discovered.
The orbit of this body was found to very nearly coincide with the
position required to complete the order of the distance from the sun?
an order which is known as Bode?s Law, by which it is assumed that the
distances are as the numbers 4, 7, 10, 16, 28, 52, 100, 196, and 388 ; for
the actual distances of the planets accord very closely to this; Neptune
is, however, to some considerable extent an exception. The large num-
bers and minute dimensions of these bodies have led to the belief that
they are fragments of some large planet which had in ages gone by been
shattered to pieces. This supposition is rendered the more probable
from the almost inexhaustible supply which seems to attend on each
increase of the penetrating power of telescopes. The orbits of these little
planets are so interlaced that we almost wonder that they do not stumble
across one another in their circuits. If we were to represent the orbits,
interlaced as they are in space, with rings, we could not lift one without
lifting all the rest.
Numerous national observatories have been erected in this interval,
prominent among which are those at the Cape of Good Hope (1821,) at
Parramatta, N.S.W. (1822, since dismantled,) Cambridge, in England
(1823,) at Harvard College, U.S.A. (1840,) Washington (1842,) Williams-
town, Victoria (1853,) Sydney (1858 ;) and so identified has astronomy
become with national progress, that several large observatories have been


established, and are maintained, by municipalities ; instances of these are
those of Manchester and Liverpool, while many of the highest class
have been instituted in connection "with colleges and universities for
educational purposes.
Ihe places and motions of the heavenly bodies are now known with
great exactitude, and the charts, catalogues, and ephemerides of the moon,
sun, stars, and planets are almost perfect; so precise, in fact, that the
times of eclipses of the sun or moon, or of the forthcoming transits of
Venus, can be predicted years beforehand, to commence at a certain time ;
and it shall be found that the times of prediction and occurrence tallv
within two seconds.
More giant telescopes had been constructed, both refractors and re-
flectors, Among the former I may instance the Dorpat and Pulkowa,
one nine and a-half, the other sixteen, inches aperture ; Cincinnati twelve*
Harvard College fifteen, Greenwich twelve inches; and within the last
year the largest refractor ever made has been completed. I refer to Mr.
Newall?s great twenty-five inch refractor, constructed by Cook and Son'
of York.
Inspecting the Pulkowa telescope, which was known as the ? Great
Pulkowa Refractor,? Struve, the late Russian Imperial astronomer,
said?? It might well be called the great refractor, as it broke the legs of
himself and two of his assistants while they were erecting it.?
There is one fact in connection with the splendid telescope at Harvard
College which is worthy of notice?it was purchased with funds raised by
subscription among the citizens of Poston, Salem, New Bedford, and Nan-
tucket. _ Mr. Bond says, in one of his reports ?? It is worthy of note that
no restriction or reservation was in any instance required (by the con-
tributors) in regard to a right of visiting the observatory, or a control of
its operations. This liberality on the part of the contributors has been
productive of the most beneficial effects.? The cost of the telescope and
tower in which it is erected was about �5OOO, one thousand of which was
contributed by President Quincy. The Cincinnati telescope is another
instance of a similar kind, but in this case the contributions were not
confined to money subscriptions ; no inconsiderable portion of its cost was
covered by donations in kind, of hams, preserves, and other produce, and
a contribution of caps figures in the list.
Of large reflectors. Lord Rosse?s giant of Parsonstown stands first; then
there are those of Mr. Lassels, Mr. Warren De La Rue, Nasmyth, and
lastly, the great Melbourne reflector. Besides these, numberless magni-
ficent telescopes of both kinds, but of smaller dimensions, are now nightly
scrutinising the skies in the hands of both amateur observers and pro-
fessional astronomers. In 1835 Sir John Herschell (the son of Sir
William) commenced his famous scries of observations of the southern
nebulae and stars at the Cape of Good Hope, with his great reflector, a
task which occupied him five years. It is in following up and revising
some of these observations that our great reflector is principally eno-agech
The results of Sir John Herschell?s Cape observations are now published,' and
constiute the stadard authority on the nebulae of the southern hemisphere.
At Greenwich, Pond succeeded Maskelyne in 1812, and next came
Airy, the present Astronomer-Royal, who was appointed in 1835.


The first measurements of the distances of the fixed stars were made
in 1838 and 1839. Bessel determined that of 61 Cygni, and Hender-
son that of a Centauri. You will remember that the distance of the
nearest of the fixed stars is immeasurably greater than that of the farthest
planets, and that consequently the earth?s diameter, the base line used in
determining the distance of the planets, becomes uselessly small when we
come to deal with the stars; instead of the earth?s diameter, therefore,
the diameter of her orbit about the sun is taken as the base line, which
gives us a length twice the sun?s distance, or about 183,000,000 miles.
The process of finding the distance, which is known in astronomical lan-
guage as determination of annual parallax, depends upon ascertaining
whether a star?s true position remains the same when observed while
the earth is in any certain part of her orbit, and again when in another
part six months distant, in which case there will be, roughly speaking,
183,000,000 miles between the two points of observation; if the star?s
position appears unaltered, then it is said its parallax is insensible, and its
distance so great as to be immeasurable. If ever so small a difference of
position, however, is discernible, the distance can be deduced.
In the case of the two stars mentioned, the annual parallax of
a Centauri was found to be 9-10ths of a second, which gives it a distance
of 224,000 times the sun?s distance; this star appears to be by far the
nearest to us. The distance of 61 Cygni, the next nearest, is 366,000
times the sun?s distance.
The fact that the solar system is actually moving through space, was
by this time pretty well established; but there was considerable un-
certainty as to the precise direction or rate of this movement. Sir John
Herschell pointed out so long since as 1783 that the direction appeared
to be towards a certain point in the constellation Hercules. Struve has
now shown that this is actually the direction; and he says : ? The
velocity of the motion is such that the sun, with the whole cortege of
bodies depending on him, advances annually in the direction indicated at
the rate of 154,000,000 miles per annum.?
The greatest astronomical achievement during this period was, un-
doubtedly, the discovery of the planet Neptune ?the last and most distant
of the major planets now known.
The circumstances attending this discovery are, I have no doubt, well
remembered by most of you. Two mathematicians were (independently
and unknown to each other) engaged in investigating as to the cause of
certain irregularities exhibited by Uranus in his orbital motion, which
could only be accounted for by supposing the disturbing cause to be an
unknown and large planet still more distant from the sun. Both these
mathematicians (M. Le Vender of Paris, and Mr. Adams of Cambridge)
sent the results of their calculations to the principal European astronomers,
indicating the position in the heavens in which the supposed planet might
be found. A systematic search was commenced, and on September 23rd,
1845, M. Galle, an assistant in the Berlin Observatory, found the stranger
close to the position indicated by Le Vender and Adams.
This new planet has been called Neptune. The full significance of
this discovery may not at first, perhaps, be so apparent to those un-
acquainted with the whole circumstances ; but, when we come to consider


that the actual position in space occupied by an unknown and invisible
body, the only indication of whose existence was the disturbing effect on
the motion of Uranus, was almost precisely pointed out by those mathe-
maticians, after calculations involving the most difficult and complicated
considerations, we shall be prepared to endorse the words of Mr. Hind,
who says :
?A most brilliant discovery,?the grandest of which Astronomy can boast, ?
and one that is destined to be a perpetual record in the annals of science?an
astonishing proof of the power of the human intellect.?
In all other cases, the one who first sees has reaped the whole honour
due; but here the mere finding falls far into the shade when compared with
the intellectual skill that enabled Adams and Verrier to tell astronomers
where to find it.
The dimensions of Neptune are not yet known with certainty, on account
of his immense distance from us; his diameter is, however, estimated at
about 37,000 miles. He occupies 164.6 years in his revolution about the
sun, at a distance of about 2746 millions of miles.
The origin and nature of meteors have long presented a fertile field
for speculation and theorising. Within the last few years, however, our
knowledge of these minute denizens of space has been very considerably
increased, especially since the celebrated meteor shower of November,
1866. Long prior to this, however, it had been remarked that on certain
occasions meteors had been seen in unusually large numbers, and Hum-
boldt describes a grand shower of them he witnessed in 1799, Oldsted,
in comparing this with former occurrences, adopted the theory that
these meteoric storms are due to the progress of the earth through
a mass of these atoms, which appear to be congregated into a ring
which intersects the earth?s orbit. Professor Newton, of America,
and others, have still further investigated the matter, and their con-
clusions tend to establish Oldsted?s theory ; and it is now considered
that ordinary shooting stars or meteors are minute particles of
cosmical matter which revolve about the sun in an orbit or ring,
like the planets; that they are chiefly congregated into two rings,
one intersecting the plane of the earth?s orbit in August with an inclina-
tion of 79�; the other in November, with an inclination of 17� ; and also,
that in some portions of these rings the meteors are more densely crowded
than at others. They are called the November and August rings, from
the fact that they intersect that part of the ecliptic occupied by the earth
in those months. In these months, therefore, meteors are usually far
more numerous than at others; but it is only when the crowded portions
of the rings cross the earth?s path at those months that we have those
grand displays called meteor showers, the last of which was witnessed in
Northern Europe in November, 1866. Professor Newton shows that so
far as the November ring is concerned, these showers occur every thirty-
three years, although the grandest of them will come only at periods of
about 133 years.
The motion of these minute bodies is contrary to that of the earth ; we
therefore meet them ? full filt.? They all appear to come from one point
in the heavens within the constellation Leo. Mr. Alexander Herschell,
one of our highest authorities on this class of astronomy, states, as one of


the results of his observations of the August fall of 1866, that not one in
twenty ol these bodies exceeds a pound in weight, most are very much
smaller, and some cannot exceed a few grains. It appears pretty certain
that these bodies become visible to us while yet at a distance of from
seventy to fifty miles; and why such small masses at such a distance can
produce the brilliant light with which they become visible is accounted
for by the immense velocity (thirty miles a second) with which they
approach us, becoming converted into heat immediately they enter our
atmosphere.
Photography has of late years come into extensive use in astronomy.
The first application of it in this direction is due to Dr. Draper, of New
York, who obtained photographs of the moon in 1840. Mr. Bond, of
Harvard College, seems to be the next to use it, in 1850, since which it
has come into very general use; and in the hands of Mr. Warren De La
Rue, Rutherford, Draper, and others, has now reached a very high state
of perfection. The moon has naturally received the greatest attention
from photographers, and some very magnificent pictures have been pub-
lished from time to time. Photographs of the brighter planets, double
stars, and star clusters, have also been successfully obtained; and at the
Kew Observatory, pictures of the sun?s surface are taken every clear day.
In total eclipses of the sun, also, photography has proved eminently useful
in securing for all time some of the strange and evanescent appearances
witnessed on such occasions.
The application of the electric telegraph to observational astronomy
belongs to the late portion of the period lam dealing with. It was first
used by Dr. Locke, in America, in 1848, and the galvanic current has
now become one of the essentials to a first-class observatory. The
observer has no longer to listen painfully to the ticks of his clock or
chronometer, as he watches the progress of the stars across his telescope,
or the moments at which various phenomena occur; his undivided
attention can now be devoted to the ocular part of his task. With a
telegraphic key in his hand, he can at a touch send a signal to the chrono-
graph, which records the desired instant with greater precision than
could otherwise be obtained. The extended application of cbronography
by means of the galvanic current has opened up new modes for the
solution of many very important astronomical problems.
So far as our knowledge of the condition and constitution of the
heavenly bodies is concerned, there is no modern accessory in astronomy
that has done so much as spectrum analysis. By its aid the constitution
of the visible portion of the sun has been revealed to us with certainty
as consisting of incandescent vapours, among which are the vapours of
many of the substances and gases we know on the earth?s surface, notably
sodium, iron, nickel, magnesium, barium, calceum, and hydrogen. On
the occasion of the last total eclipses visible in India and America,
the spectroscope unravelled the mystery of those strange red prominences
which are seen to jut out from the sun?s edge during the moments of
totality. It showed them to be incandescent hydrogen gas ?jets of flame
projecting for tens of thousands ?nay, almost a hundred thousand miles
into space, of such gigantic dimensions that they would embrace dozens
of such puny globes as ours in their fiery arms, like motes in a candle.


By an ingenious arrangement of spectroscope with the telescope, these
red flames can now be witnessed at almost any time without an eclipse,
with which they have nothing whatever to do, hut which become
the more readily visible on these occasions on account of the complete
obscuration of the sun?s direct glare. The spectroscope has also shown
that the fixed stars are in all respects suns. Lines indicating the
presence of many of the substances known in the earth, and in a
state of vapour in the sun, are easily recognised on numbers of them.
Hydrogen appears to be a common constituent among the stars, and in
some the hydrogen spectrum becomes the most prominent. Some years
ago a star, T. Corona, was observed to suddenly grow brighter; before
the change it was so small as to be invisible to the unaided eye, but in a
few days it became as brilliant as the brightest stars. The spectroscope
told us that the sudden increased brilliancy was due to an outburst of
hydrogen, far outvieing in magnitude the most stupendous flames that are
ejected into space by our sun. This occurrence, with respect to T.
Corona, has given rise to speculations, as our sun is continually vomiting
forth these monster flames, whether there may not be occasions when
some such terrific outbursts take place on it; but cases like T. Corona
are the very rare exception, and not the rule; and few instances of
such rapid variability in the brightness of stars are on record.
Before concluding, I would like to refer to one item, and that not the least
in the past seventy years of Astronomy: the establishment of an observatory
in Victoria, Like Greenwich, it was established to facilitate navigation;
that was, and still is, its prime object, Its beginnings took place in 1853,
when I was invited to form and conduct an observatory at Williamstown,
for the purpose of obtaining and maintaining accurate local time, and of
giving public time signals to enable masters of ships to obtain errors and
rates of their chronometers. By this time chronometers had been
brought to such a state of perfection, that the method of obtaining
longitude at sea, by the transport of Greenwich time, was almost
exclusively practised Chronometers, however, of the best construction
are but machines liable to break down, stop, or go wrong; the Lunar
distance method therefore affords a valuable stand-by in case of any such
contingencies, and no good seaman is master of his art, or a safe navigator,
unless he is up to ?Lunars.? That they are not always so, is unfortu-
nately a fact, for which, perhaps, the excellence of chronometers is to blame.
I recollect, some years ago, an excellent old salt whom I had known for
several years, bringing his chronometers to the observatory on his arrival
in port; one of them had gone wrong, and the other was not quite trust-
worthy ; he had been in a quandary. I said to him, I suppose you made
yourself safe by a few ?Lunars.? ?Lunars !? he said, ? No, sir, I only took
two ?Lunars? since I was master of a ship; once I was about the meridian
of Ascension, and my ?Lunar? put me about the middle of the desert of
Sahara, and next I was near St. Paul?s Island, and it put me pretty nigh
the meridian of Cape Leuwin, so I thought ?Lunars? were not much
account, and never took any since. I knocked along this time with the
log and my lame chronometer, and I guess I?m in port safe enough now.?
Like Flamsteed, I commenced with indifferent instruments. For about
twelve months a sextant and chronometer were the only ones of which our


National Observatory could boast. Through the liberal support that has
ever been accorded to science by our Governments and Legislature, how-
ever, the Observatory in the course of a few years grew out of its swaddling
clothes, and became a well-equipped establishment. After nine or ten
years it was removed from Williamstown to its present site.
Our Observatory was one of those which undertook a series of obser-
vations for the determination of the parallax of Mars at its opposition in
1862, for a new measurement of the sun?s distance ; and the Williams-
town series has been acknowledged to be the most successful obtained on
that occasion. The sun?s parallax derived from the combination of our
with the Greenwich observations was 8".93, while that from the Pulkowa
and Cape of Good Hope was 8".96?a very close coincidence. The most
noteworthy fact connected with these results is that they agree so closely
with the parallax assigned by Le Yerrier and Foncault on other grounds.
Light had hitherto been assumed to travel at the rate of 192,000 miles
a second. Foncault?s beautiful experiments show r ed its speed to be only
185,170 miles a second. From eclipses and other phenomena we know
light takes eight minutes eighteen seconds to come from the sun to us. A
simple calculation, then, gives 92,000,000 as the distance and 8".86 as the
parallax. Le Yerrier assigned a parallax of 8".95, which resulted from
his investigations of the perturbations of some of the planets. The paral-
lax resulting from the transit of Yenus in 1769 was 8".58, equal to a dis-
tance of a little over 95,000,000 miles; that from the Mars observations
gave a distance of 91,500,000 miles ?a difference of three and a half mil-
lions miles. Were it not for the coincidence of the Mars results with
those deduced by Foncault and Le Yerrier, there might be some reason
to doubt the results. Lately, however the Venus observations of 1769
have been re-discussed by Mr. Stone, of Greenwich, who finds that by
applying some necessary corrections to the observations, which certain
appearances on a late transit of Mercury had indicated to be requisite,
the results coincide almost exactly with those obtained in 1862.
The astronomical work that has engaged our Observatory is, as at
Greenwich, the Cape, and many other national observatories, confined al-
most exclusively to the utilitarian class. The maintenance of correct
local time, and giving public time signals, to enable mariners to rate their
chronometers correctly and with facility ; the determination and correction
of the places of the principal fixed stars ; and a complete survey of cer-
tain portions of the southern heavens, for the formation of accurate star
catalogues and charts of the southern hemisphere (a work that has been
undertaken by this in co-operation with two other British observatories,)
constitute the principal routine work. Since the erection of our great
telescope, observation of and depicting the southern nebula; have been
added to this. The Melbourne star catalogues of the southern heavens
are now admitted to be the most valuable extant, and it appears they have
become of special importance with reference to the forthcoming transit
of Venus; so that whatever our colony may do on that occasion, she has
already contributed a very honourable share in these star catalogues
alone.
It is a very popular belief that practical Astronomy consists of star-
gazing, looking at the moon, or searching for some unknown stars, planets


or comets ; and young ladies who come to the Observatory on fine, plea-
sant nights, to have a keek at the moon, say, ? How delightful! What a
beautiful, romantic occupation !? and so it is for an hour or two, if it is
not too cold ; but long, weary hours of monotonous watching and record-
ing at night, with the long, dreary calculations of to-morrow looming
ahead, soon strip the delightful romance from the calling of the practical
astronomer, and bring it down to the level of other bread and butter
getting occupations. There is no such thing as star-gazing (as that term
is generally understood) in a regular observatory ; ?every observation is
for a particular purpose, and set out beforehand. The more popular
branches of Astronomy, such as comet and planet seeking, investigations
of the moon?s surface, delineations of the features of the nearer planets,
and such like, are, by general consent, left to amateurs and private
individuals, many of whom are in possession of magnificent telescopes,
well fitted for the work, and who yearly contribute very largely to our
knowledge on these subjects. National institutions, however, have to
grind away at the harder stuff, which does not present enough excite-
ment, or requires too much application, for those who follow up astronomy
for amusement. This is how it is we nearly always hear of comets, and
even planetoids, being discovered by such observers, and not by those who
have to do the less genial but more utilitarian work.
The most important work in astronomy, as in other sciences, is that
which appeals least to the uninitiated and the general public ; hence the
cui hono question so frequently advanced with respect to observatories
and scientific institutions ; and i recollect an occasion when an astronomer
engaged upon some work of the highest importance and real commercial
value, was severely blamed in public print for allowing a zealous
yqung amateur astronomer to discover a comet! Greenwich Observatory
has been established nearly two centuries, yet neither a comet, planet
or planetoid has ever been first discovered there. For all this, the
basis of modern astronomy is admitted by all astronomers to rest on the
Greenwich Observatory.
As an example of the value?the commercial value ?of the simple
maintenance of true time, one of the first objects of a national observa-
tory, I may mention Mr. Warren De la Rue, the celebrated paper
manufacturer, states that ? he estimates the annual saving to his firm,
by having exact time, and enforcing strict attendance on his work-people,
at �3OO per annum (besides some saving of gas and coals, not taken into
account,) which is an amount that would otherwise be entirely lost; and
of this he is able to make a return to his work-people in the way of
additional privileges as respects holidays.?
In conclusion, I believe I cannot do better than quote the words of Sir
John Herschell, when speaking of the work of national observatories;?
? If we ask to what end magnificent establishments are maintained by
states and sovereigns, furnished with masterpieces of art, and placed
under the direction of men of first-rate talent and high-minded enthu-
siasm, sought out for those qualities among the foremost in the ranks of
science?if we demand, cui hono ? For what good a Bradley has toiled,
or a Maskelyne or a I'iazzi worn out his venerable age in watching?
The answer is?not to settle mere speculative points in the doctrine of


the universe; not to cater for the pride of man, by refined inquiries into
the remoter mysteries of nature; not to trace the path of our system
through infinite space, or its history through past and future eternities.
These indeed are noble ends, and which I am far from any thought of
depreciating; the mind swells in their contemplation, and attains in their
pursuit an expansion and a hardihood which fit it for the boldest enter-
prise : but the direct practical utility of such labours is fully worthy of
their speculative grandeur. The stars are the land-marks of the universe;
and. amidst the endless and complicated fluctuations of our system, seem
placed by its Creator as guides and records, not merely to elevate our
minds by the contemplation of what is vast, but to teach us to direct our
actions by reference to what is immutable in his works. It is indeed
hardly possible to over-appreciate their value in this point of view.
Every well-determined star, from the moment its place is registered,
becomes to the astronomer, the geographer, the navigator, the surveyor,
a point of departure which can never deceive or fail him?the same for
ever and in all places; of a delicacy so extreme as to be a test for every
instrument invented by man, yet equally adapted for the most ordinary
purposes; as available for regulating a town clock as for conducting a
navy to the Indies; as effective for mapping down the intricacies of a
petty barony as for adjusting the boundaries of transatlantic empires.
When once its place has been thoroughly ascertained and carefully
recorded, the brazen circle with which that useful work was done may
moulder?the marble pillar totter on its base?an d the astronomer himself
survive only in the gratitude of his posterity: but the record remains,
and transfuses all its own exactness into every determination which takes
it for a ground-work, giving to inferior instruments, nay even to temporary
contrivances and to the observations of a few weeks or days, all the
precision attained originally at the cost of so much time, labour and
expense.?
