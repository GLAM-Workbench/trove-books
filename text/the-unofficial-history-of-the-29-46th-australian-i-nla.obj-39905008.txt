FOREWORD
The following pages are a collection of stories of im-
portant events in the life of this unit during the war
years of 1939-1945. The object of printing this unit
history is to provide its members with a diary of events
in which they took part and in later years to stimulate
their memory of happy friendships and history-making
events in which they themselves were interested.
By far the greater portions of the writings in this book
are the work of Lieut. A. L. Mclntyre (Battalion
Intelligence Officer) and much credit is due to him. He
was assisted in this work by Pte J. Dwyer and the In-
telligence Section. To Capt. Ray Eames fell the heavy
task of seeing that the history got to print. The amount
of work involved was not small, and our gratitude is due
to him.
Portions of the book were written by the following:
Lt-Col. K. S. Cusworth; Capt. R. Eames; Capt. K. A.
Boyd; Capt. H. Wilson; Lieut. S. Pigott and Sgt W.
Mclntosh.
Our thanks also go to Mr Rupert Charlott of the
Melbourne Argus whose able editing enabled us to com-
plete the manuscript and to Lt-Col. Treloar (Director,
Australian War Memorial) for valuable help and advice.

CHAPTER I
EARLY TRAINING DAYS OF THE UNIT
September 1939- August 1942
When, on 3rd September 1939, war with Germany came
for the second time in a quarter of a century, members
of the 29th Battalion had for weeks already been training
in the routine of mobilization procedure. Overnight
their years spent in voluntary service promised valuable
dividends in national defence.
By 18th September city members of the Battalion had
taken over security guard duties at Victoria Barracks,
Melbourne, the Commonwealth Oil Refineries, Widdis
Battery factory and the outer perimeter of the barracks.
They were relieved by country personnel of D and C
Companies with one platoon of Machine Gun Com-
pany, on 4th October, but on 20th October the Battalion
was relieved of these duties and prepared for the longest
camp of continuous training held for many years.
Site of the 30 days’ camp was Meadow Hill, Trawool,
with Lt-Col. C. S. Barber, M.C., V.D. commanding the
Unit and Major F. Hosking second in command. Brig.
E. F. Lind, C.8.E., D. 5.0., V.D., who had previously
commanded the Unit, was Brigade commander.
Mechanization was then unknown. All the Unit’s
motive power was literally “horse-power”, but the
strenuous training was undertaken with enthusiasm and
culminated in a visit to the Battalion by Maj.-Gen.
Drake-Brockman, C. 8., C.M.G., D. 5.0., V.D., followed
by a Unit sports meeting at Seymour racecourse. Many
Unit members by this time were leaving to join the
Australian Sixth Division, then being formed.


First draft of universal trainees marched in while the
Unit was in its next camp at Nagambie road from nth
April to gth July 1940. The second week of cadre train-
ing for officers and N.C.O’s had by then been com-
pleted. Although a majority of personnel voted at a
census in favour of the 4th Brigade joining the A.I.F. in-
tact, as Brig. Lind had wished, it was learned later that
the Brigade could not be accepted as a whole.
Instead, reorganization of the Battalion brought many
changes, including formation of Headquarters Company
and a fourth Rifle Company, while the mortars in D
Support Company were transferred to H.Q. Company.
D Company became E Machine Gun Company. .
Among many well-known officers who had left the
Unit to join the A.I.F. were:
Maj. B. J. O’Loughlin, later Lt-Col., 0.8. E., E.D.
Maj. W. G. Cannon, E.D., who later became Lt-Col.
and commander of 2/i4th Battalion A.I.F.
Capt. Val Miller, later Maj., who was unfortunate to
be taken P.O.W. in Greece.
Capt. Norm Goble, who was later mentioned in des-
patches and commanded sth Australian Infantry Bat-
talion.
Capt. Steve Noonan, later Maj. 2/i4th Battalion
A.I.F.
Capt. Bob Joshua, who later commanded 2/43rd
Battalion A.I.F. and was awarded the Military Cross.
Lieut. Ken Mac Queen, who was a P.O.W. in Germany
for five years.
W.O. Fletcher, who escaped from Greece and Crete
and later joined the 29th Battalion as company com-
mander.
To trace all these Unit personalities, including some
who died in action, would take many pages. It is sufficient
to say that the Battalion was carrying on the high


traditions of its older members in the Great War of
1914-1918.
About this time Lt-Col. Barber left to take over com-
mand of 4th Brigade, and Maj. Hosking, promoted to
Lt-Col., became C.O. About the same time, too, the
Unit was witnessing the end of an era—the horse trans-
port which had given great service in the other war,
and in training soldiers for this one, was giving way
quickly to the internal combustion engine. By almost
completely eliminating the suffering of horses, mechan-
ized warfare was at least more humane in this respect.
Perhaps in peace time, on sunny afternoons, the site
of the next Unit camp, at Trawool, on the banks of the
Goulburn River, would have been a place of arcadian
charm and beauty. Unit members who camped there
from 3rd January to 23rd April 1941 remember it as
bleak, windswept and dusty. Not that there was much
time for communing with nature, for motor transport
was beginning to arrive and with the marching in of
the 20- to 25-year age group, training began in earnest.
Already lessons learned from what people were now
calling “World War II” were finding their way into
training manuals and tactics.
On 2nd August 1941 the Unit moved to “25A” at
Trawool, but three weeks later its training ground be-
came the new Bonegilla camp. Here the men took great
interest in the new mechanized equipment, especially the
carriers. Most noticeable advance in training methods
was the improved signalling equipment and technique.
An added incentive to make training “as near the real
thing” as possible was the ominous threat of Japan’s
entry into the war. People—and especially those training
as soldiers—realized that the war, instead of remaining
a remote affair to Australians, might now bring the
fighting to their very shores. Unit personnel were not
surprised when they came on to full-time duty on 31st


October. By 7th December Japan had begun its grim
southward drive. On 23rd January 1942 the Japanese
landed in force at Rabaul.
About this time one officer and 90 other ranks enlisted
for service in the 39th Battalion and left for operational
service near Moresby. Meantime the Unit’s training and
“toughening up” process increased in tempo, and March
1942 saw large-scale exercises. Conjectures about a north-
ward move were confirmed with the arrival of a host of
new equipment, including a full establishment of car-
riers, motor transport and Bren and Vickers guns. The
“Q” store became one of the busiest places in the camp
with the issue of new clothing and equipment, and on
17th March 1942 the northward move was “on”.
How well those responsible for “security” in the Unit
had learned their jobs was indicated by the complete
secrecy with which the Unit’s destination was guarded.
Most of the troops were at Warwick, Queensland, before
they realized that this was to be the new camp site. Here
the Unit lost three more of its well-known identities—
Maj. Tom Griffith, M.C., V.D., Capt. Eric Loh and
Lieut. John Sharpe. Maj. Griffith, affectionately known
as “the Mad Major”, one of the keenest and most en-
thusiastic officers in the Unit, which he had served for
many years, was a severe loss to the Battalion as it neared
completion of its preparations for battle.
Nothing more than a staging camp, or jumping-off spot
for future moves, Warwick served the useful purpose of
demonstrating to Unit members that Army life had real
discomforts and demanded a genius for improvisation if
the men were to live in reasonable comfort. However,
Warwick’s conditions demonstrated that the Unit had
its fair share of typical “Aussie Mandrakes” when it
came to improvising “all mod. cons.” out of thin air.
Lt-Col. Hosking left to take command ofi 15th Brigade


arid Maj. F. Corr administered command, with Maj.
R. F. C. Alsop as second in command.
Next move introduced the Unit to the inimitable
experience of travelling by M.T. convoy. It staged for
several weeks at Chermside, Brisbane and then, with the
vital Coral Sea battle raging, moved to Caloundra to
“man” the defences of this section of the coast against
a possible Japanese landing attempt.
Within a fortnight the Unit moved again, this time
to take over defence of the Coomera River area against
invasion danger near Southport. Unit members were
warmly welcomed by Southport’s amiable residents, and
many lasting friendships were formed. At the same time
valuable first-hand information of combat conditions
was obtained from personnel of Bth Brigade A.I.F.
recently returned from the Middle East, who had been
temporarily exchanged with personnel of 4th Brigade.
While at Coomera many members were at last granted
permission to join the A.1.F., a privilege they had long
been seeking, and A.I.F. enlistments poured in.
Many changes in establishment and organization fol-
lowed. After having moved temporarily to Maryborough,
Queensland, where medical classification of those enlist-
ing in the A.I.F. was completed, the Unit moved back
to Caloundra for more training. Maj. Alsop administered
command when Maj. Corr left. The M.G. Company
was disbanded, except for one platoon, which was re-
tained in the H.Q. Company, and the Carrier Platoon
was deleted. With the establishment of the Tank Attack
Platoon it was obvious that the Unit had changed over
to tropical war establishment, and the shape of things
to come was now much clearer.
On 26th August 1942, with formation of a composite
battalion, the Unit’s designation became 2g/46th Aus-
tralian Infantry Battalion. After its long wait the Unit
was soon to get down to the serious business of war.


CHAPTER II
CALOUNDRA, QUEENSLAND, TO MILNE BAY
Appointment of Lt-Col. K. S. Cusworth as C.O. marked
a new era in the Unit’s preparations for its active service
role. Soon after this appointment, on 12 th October
1942, training in jungle battle tactics began in earnest.
But there remained need to correct many of the dis-
abilities from which the Battalion had suffered. From an
administrative point of view frequent changes in policy
and command had made smooth working impossible. A
two-hour Battalion parade had disclosed that the men
were sadly ill-clad and equipped. In fact, out of the camp
area they were able to appear reasonably smartly dressed
by buying their own shorts and shirts!
The “two-man tents” in which the men were living
were unsatisfactory, and there was general need for
“tightening up” not only in living conditions. Good
clothing, better food and better hygiene fortified the
men against the “shock” of coming abruptly up against
stricter discipline and tougher training. Weekly Bat-
talion parades caused the usual “digger” chorus of com-
plaint, but the men soon realized that the new routine
was producing results.
The new training was designed to produce soldiers
who could not only fight the Japs, but the New Guinea
jungles at the same time. Exercises without transport
were essential in preparing soldiers for jungle fighting
where most of the time they would be without the
appurtenances of modern mechanized warfare.
The comparative monotony of training was broken by
the field firing exercise carried out miles north of


Caloundra township. Working in conjunction with ar-
tillery for the first time, the Unit had a realistic “bap-
tism of fire” because live ammunition was used to make
the exercise as realistic as possible. Subsequently at the
request of the Department of Information the exercise
was repeated and filmed for training purposes.
With the prospect of an early move from Australia,
the subject of leave became increasingly important, as
there had been no home leave for a year. Amid scenes of
rejoicing the first batch of men left on 17 days of home
leave. The many who had to remain in camp over Christ-
mas did themselves well, the Unit organizing a first-rate
dinner and a fairly generous quota of Australia’s favourite
thirst-quencher.
But when the last and biggest batch of men was about
to go on leave a new instruction came through that the
leave period was to be reduced from 17 to 12 days. There
was wide resentment at this discriminatory treatment,
and so many men unofficially extended their home leave
for the extra five days that subsequently there was a
“mass orderly room” and consolidated revenue bene-
fited by more than £ 1000. There was, of course, no truth
in the suggestion that the C.O. was “in on the rake-off”,
though he certainly deserved some form of compensa-
tion. Each conviction required his signature—ten times!
On 21st February 1943 the Unit embarked on the
United States Liberty ship Jason Lee, but what was to
many their first sea voyage was a bitterly disappointing
affair because of the thoroughly unpleasant conditions.
There were compensations, however: the weather was
excellent, and close co-operation between Lieut. Hough-
ton, the Quartermaster, and the cooks resulted in good
meals which everyone, because of the calm seas, was able
to enjoy. The troops organized their own entertainment,
and a member of the U.S. forces, known as “Turk”,
warbled “Buddy” night after night and, surprisingly,
B


retained his popularity as a performer. And “Bingo”
helped many a dreary hour to pass unnoticed. According
to the general opinion, however, it was a good trip with
no credit to either ship’s master or crew.
Then abruptly it was brought home to everyone that
he was now at the war! Nearing Milne Bay a flight of
Japanese bombers came over, but no bombs were
dropped. Soon afterwards as the ship came close inshore
the men could see their future home—or rather they
could see the coconut trees that grew round their future
home. Soon afterwards the Unit was taken to a camp site
at the end of Route No. 8. All roads in the area had
numbers, not names.
During its fortnight in this area the Unit occupied
and fortified the Rabi sector of the Milne Bay defences.
B and C Companies were fortunate in being allotted
well-prepared positions, but A and D Companies had
days of back-breaking toil and heavy transport to their
sites in the hills.
Tragedy struck suddenly on the night of 21st March
1943. Out of a clear sky came a flight of Japanese bom-
bers. They passed over the Rifle Companies and headed
for Turnbull Field, near which Battalion H.Q. and
H.Q. Company were located. Headquarters was the
selected target, and the Japanese bomb-aimers were
right on their mark. The Battalion lost two staff officers,
Capt. N. Hirons and Lieut. G. Flynn, both killed. Next
night about the same time the bombers were over
again and their bombs were again on the mark, but
fortunately there were no casualties. Battalion H.Q. and
H.Q. Company were then moved to the north side of
Turnbull Field.
First operational task consisted of patrols to Mullins
Harbour, K.B. Mission, Wagga Wagga and Wopi. The
Mullins Harbour patrol was a stiff endurance test to
troops not yet acclimatized to the tropics, but the in


terest in the natives and the luscious fruits they supplied
at the various missions were some compensation.
The Battalion rear party, under Capt. Mollison, re-
joined the Unit on 31st March and early in April the
Battalion moved into reserve position of the Milne Bay
defence plan, replacing 37752nd Battalion. From here
C Company made the initial patrol to Wedau and
Taupota on the north coast of Papua, each company
being relieved after three weeks of outpost duty.
Then the troops had a chance to realize at first hand
the real significance of the Army term “working party”.
In blistering heat the Unit supplied working parties
three days in every nine, each “day’s” work being done
in four shifts each of six hours. In one record day the
Unit supplied 575 all ranks.
Japanese air power was still a formidable force, as
the Unit learned on 14th April. On this day there had
been many rumours of considerable numbers of Japan-
ese planes lurking outside the bay, but when by mid-
day nothing had happened the earlier buzz of excitement
had somewhat subsided. Most men were at mess when
the characteristic drone of Japanese bombers was heard.
By the time the warning had been given the bombers
could be clearly seen with their protective fighters. The
whole force of 100 planes bore down on the Unit’s area
and there was a scream of bombs and a brief but devas-
tating sample of hell let loose. When the planes had gone
Cpl Berriman was dead and Pte Marsden wounded.
The Unit had barely taken up its new positions at Gaba
Gabuna before the wet season set in and A Company
had to be evacuated from its flooded, low-lying camp
site in Engineer assault boats.
After the Unit had moved to a more congenial site on
Route 7 there was more intensive training and H.Q.
personnel undertook their first large-scale exercise—36
hours of slogging through knee-deep mud. The route


was from Hagita House to the Gomini River and then
to Gibara, where the weary troops were met by boats
and taken back to Gili Gili.
The hazards of crossing four streams in pontoon boats
which natives had carried, added to the trials of the
three-day exercise to Elibolele on which the whole Bat-
talion set out a few weeks later. And when the exercise
was over everyone had to turn round and get back home!
Soon afterwards, the Unit regretfully said goodbye to
Brig. Barber. The Brigade had much to thank him for
in his untiring efforts on its behalf both in welfare and
training. Brig. Barber had been C.O. of the 29th Bat-
talion and followed its subsequent doings with a great
deal of pride.
Farewells were also said to W. 0.1 P. Hazzard, who
had given loyal service in both world wars.
Brig. C. R. V. Edgar,* an energetic and able com-
mander with actual experience with the Japanese, became
Brigade commander.
The itinerant Unit’s rambles were by no means over.
By August 1943 the men were building a new camp at
Mapo, high in the mountains, which was destined to
become a rest camp. The souls of the aesthetic were
stirred by the magnificent panoramas of the blue waters
of the bay on fine days, but on other days the troops
were literally high in the clouds and knee-deep in mud.
Preserving the local architectural scheme, buildings
and huts, modelled on the native design, sprang up into
a mushroom township and for the first time since leaving
the mainland the troops had a permanent water supply.
But they wanted other things more urgently than
bathroom facilities. After six months in New Guinea
there was still no immediate prospect of going into
action. Some despondent souls began to believe that
they were doomed to be garrison troops until, in the
» Brig. C. R. V. Edgar, later C.8.E., D. 5.0., E.D.


tradition of old soldiers, they “simply faded away”. In
the north the Salamaua campaign was nearing its climax.
The Ninth Division was already in Milne Bay and was
likely to be “featured” in the next “show”, at Lae.
“Won’t we ever get a flamin’ guernsey?” was the plaintive
query.
Then abruptly on 17th August the Unit was switched
back to intensive training, and the men knew instinc-
tively that “it was on”. Live ammunition appeared in
large quantities and the camp was rapidly transformed
from a rest camp to a miniature battlefield.
When Gen. Sir Thomas Blarney dropped in on a
flying visit one day, ostensibly to inspect Mapo, whose
rest camp was his idea, he said nothing to relieve the
gradually mounting tension.
And then, on 28th August, Brig. Edgar, addressing a
Battalion parade, announced that the Unit was about
to go into action. Spirits soared, and the weary months
of toil and training were forgotten with the immediate
prospect of coming to grips with the Jap instead of merely
dodging his bombs.
With the required quota of A.I.F. enlistments the
Unit now qualified to be classified as A.I.F. It learned
about the same time that it was to come under command
of the Ninth Division and embark for Lae. At last it
had achieved an operational role in a real offensive.


CHAPTER III
RED BEACH-LAE
On 9th September first flight of the Battalion—Battalion
H.Q., A, C and D Companies—made its last truck journey
down the Mapo road to barges waiting to take it on the
first stage towards Lae. The second flight—H.Q. and B
Companies—followed 24 hours later.
The L.C.l’s in which the men travelled were escorted
in calm seas by four American destroyers which brought
a certain feeling of security in an area where Japanese
aerial activity had been particularly heavy.
Next morning, on 10th September, the convoy with
the first section of the Battalion called at Buna for an
hour. Here the troops enjoyed a swim and stretched their
legs on dry land.
Inextricably mixed with even war’s starkest tragedy are
those lighter moments which often outlive in memory
the grimmer interludes. On the way out of Buna the
troops had an unexpected “variety” show.
First there were the few stragglers who literally nearly
missed the boat, and had to “break evens” along the
beach to clamber aboard. Most of the men made good
time, but not so Mr Wilkinson, Brigade Salvation Army
representative, who was “top weight” in the field, with
an “extra penalty” of a shirt filled with tins of fruit for
the boys.
Wading out to his armpits he was able to climb only
half-way up the L.C.I. anchor chain, where he was sus-
pended while members of D Company on an adjacent
barge offered mirthful suggestions that were entertaining
rather than practical. Eventually a sailor, well schooled


in what to do in an emergency, lowered a boat hook and
“Wilkie” came up literally by the seat of his pants!
By evening the barges were approaching Red Beach,
i 6 miles east of Lae. From the south-west the men could
hear the rumble of a distant artillery duel, and just
ahead our 25-pounders were shelling Lae, still occupied
by the Japs.
As the escorting destroyers, their work now done,
swung away, the sky became overcast and the barges
made their final run to the beach under a blanket of
misty rain. Everyone was eager to get to the beach, for
it was common knowledge that Jap planes had pounded
the area every night since the initial landing.
The rain became heavier and with it the mud became
deeper. Father Reis, the Unit padre, claimed that he
prayed for the rain, but what prestige he may have
achieved by demonstrating such influence over the
elements diminished rapidly as the first shower steadily
developed into a heavy downpour.
It was more than determination to get a job done that
speeded the unloading of the barges that night, for it
was recalled that the Japanese bombers had come over
as though running to a fixed timetable. However, Father
Reis’s* rain, which would have made visibility from the
air nil, apparently kept the Japs grounded this night.
By midnight the men were ready to move. They were
met by 2/15th Australian Infantry Battalion guides and
were led for a mile through mud two feet deep, with
rain falling in bucketfuls, and darkness as black as pitch,
each man loaded with between 80 and 90 lb. of gear.
Mud and rain kept few awake that night, even though
they had nowhere to sleep but on the ground.
On the morning of 11th September, following a con-
ference of Battalion commanders and Brig. Edgar at
20th Brigade H.Q., the Unit moved to Buso 2 to relieve
* Chaplain C. Reii, later m.i.d.


the 2/15th Battalion. This meant a three-mile hike over
country that reproduced all the features of the previous
night’s muddy nightmare. On the way each man had to
pick up an extra five days’ rations.
When at 7 a.m. on 12th September the 2/15th
Battalion moved out, the Unit took over Battalion H.Q.
with one platoon of C Company being sited just north
of Buso 2. A, D, and C Companies, less one platoon,
occupied perimeters further inland to the north and
east.
With the flair for improvisation common to all Aus-
tralians, the troops made good use of the local vegetation
for building themselves sleeping “doovers”. Banana
leaves proved very handy for roofing and bedding, and
later on kunai grass was used to good effect on a “super
doover” for the C.O.
With the same enterprise troops relieved the monotony
of rations consisting mostly of “bully” and “M. and V.”,
by using fruit and vegetables from native gardens. The
fruit was of the never-ripening type, but boiled paw-
paws and fried bananas made a poor meal into a tasty
dish. Taro, too, was a popular substitute for potatoes.
Improvisation went even further. When there was a
temporary shortage of cigarette papers it was found that
banana leaves, sundried and fresh, made quite a good
smoke. But no one was able to improvise a substitute
for inward mail, of which there was no delivery in the
first fortnight.
Constant patrolling and the daily organization of a
“white boong” train to carry rations and other supplies,
kept the troops occupied at this time. Wet weather made
ration-carrying a very heavy job, especially as A Company
at “Mary” was nearly five miles inland. One jeep would
have been a great help, but there wasn’t one in the
Brigade.
Some anxiety was felt about the whereabouts of the


second section of the Unit—H.Q. and B Companies—
which, although it had embarked only 24 hours after
the first section at Milne Bay, had not been heard of.
In the absence of H.Q. Company a small B Echelon
had been formed from Company Quartermaster Sergeants,
with the Adjutant in charge. They had a full-time job, as
in addition to their normal work a nightly vigil had to
be maintained on the beach to watch for H.Q. Company
and B Company.
Eventually, on 16th September, the “lost” companies
arrived, and they had thrilling stories to tell—“ear-
bashing” some irreverent members of the first section
called it, perhaps a little envious of being cheated out of
similar adventures by only a few hours.
It was explained that after the second section had
embarked reports were received of heavy Jap air activity
over Huon Gulf, and the convoy commander sought
protection at Morobe. Here the two companies had to
spend five days, and those days provided much material
for breath-taking accounts of low-level bombing and
strafing attacks to which they were subjected.
B Company and the Pioneer Platoon came up to
Battalion H.Q. to strengthen the perimeter. C Com-
pany’s platoon rejoined its company, but B Company,
with Capt. Fletcher in command, was suddenly ordered
to concentrate near the beachhead for a special task. A
composite company of American troops was to join it and
come under command. Although it was all very “hush-
hush” and exciting, it was rumoured that there was to be
an attack on the Jap-occupied Tami Islands, just south
of Finschhafen.
Jap air raids were still a regular feature, one on 21st
September abruptly ending the men’s absorbed interest
in a dog-fight when bombs began to whistle down.
Brigade H.Q., 300 yards to the north, suffered two cas-
ualties.


Patrolling was also a regular feature, but search for
the Japanese in person proved fruitless.
The Machine Gun Platoon and Tank Attack Platoon
in defensive positions at the beachhead were joined by
18 Platoon from D Company at Warwick. On 18th Sep-
tember C Company was ordered to Nomalili to relieve a
company from the 2/3rd Pioneer Battalion. From Noma-
lili, a native village in the mountains north-east of Lae,
there were to be vigorous patrols to the north and north-
east to cut the retreat of Japanese attempting to escape
that way from Lae, which by this time was in our hands.
A Company was instructed to move down to Battalion
H.Q. area in readiness to take over the right flank pro-
tection of the Brigade area, in place of 22nd Battalion,
which had commenced a coastal advance east towards
Finschhafen. This move was cancelled, however, and only
one section left, its task being merely to guard a stores
dump at Yellow Beach. B Company was near Red Beach,
still waiting for “zero hour”.
Finally the Battalion, less B Company, was ordered
to move into Lae. A rear party under Maj. Tilley and
Capt. Boyd set off on 24th September with all available
three-tonners and as many stores as possible. Because
of the heavy loads and terrible roads the trip took five
days. C Company was signalled to rejoin the Battalion.
When the main move took place on 30th September
it looked like another long “hike”, but luck was in and
the Unit travelled in the comparative comfort of barges.
It landed at G Beach, just east of Lae township, in the
afternoon. A five-mile tramp past Malahang strip, and
then across to the west bank of the Busu River, led to
what was to be the Unit’s home for the next month. The
rear party had tents ready and C Company, having come
overland into Lae, had arrived two days earlier.
Disappointed at having missed what had looked like
being an entertaining “show”, B Company rejoined the


Unit on 3rd October, the Tami Islands venture having
fallen through because our Intelligence had discovered
that the Japs had already evacuated.
Except for a section of A Company, which was still
at Yellow Beach, the Battalion was again a complete
Unit. Its move from Milne Bay to Lae had ended more
quietly than anyone had expected.


CHAPTER IV
HOPIO-MONGI PATROL
Into the Unit’s chronicles must go this story, written by
Sgt W. Mclntosh, with the co-operation of the “11
Platoon boys” themselves. It is the first-hand story of
11 Platoon, B Company which, under Lieut. Home, left
the Battalion at Lae on 17 th October 1943 with the
object of clearing the track of suspected enemy from
Hopio to Mongi River, a march of about so miles.
This is their story:
“Our patrol left the Company area at 7 a.m. by truck
but owing to the condition of the road had to walk from
the Malahang airstrip to the barge point. With all extra
gear, such as cooking utensils, rations and ammo, this
was quite a feat, but eventually we reached the beach and
had a well-earned cup of coffee from Mr Wilkinson at
a Salvation Army stand. Then we began loading our
barge with supplies and ammo which took only a few
minutes, and we were off.
“Once we got away everyone was in a happy mood, all
wondering what we were about to strike. A wind got
up suddenly and with it a rough sea and some rain, and
it was not long before a lot of men were looking green
in the face and constantly leaning over the sides of
the barge. . . .
“When at last Hopio was sighted our two barges broke
away from the main convoy and came in to land. It was
certainly a good feeling when at 3.30 p.m. we landed.
We wasted no time unloading the barges so that they
could get away again. In the other barge there were
Capt. Ormsby, of Angau, W.O. Irving, a war photo


grapher, and four police boys. Capt. Ormsby at once sent
the police boys out to bring in the headmen of the
villages.
“We moved 300 yards up to the Hopio Mission Station,
and while tea was being prepared, along came the head-
men. They were very soldierly indeed, saluting Capt.
Ormsby every time he opened his mouth. Eventually he
explained to us that he had instructed them to report
back with all the fit men from their villages. They
began to arrive before dark, and by next morning there
must have been three hundred, including very old men
and little boys.
“We had quite a comfortable night’s rest in the church
building, and most of us went along after breakfast to
where Capt. Ormsby was picking out the best boys. It
was quite a parade, with the headmen looking very im-
portant, especially one very knowing old fellow who had
seen service in the last war.
“Eventually, after 50 boys had been selected by Capt.
Ormsby, the remainder were dismissed, and after an early
lunch we distributed the supplies evenly among the
carriers. We were about to move off when over came a
formation of Jap bombers. A dispersal was carried out in
good order (no one was killed) but apparently the Japs
had their eyes on another target as a few minutes later we
heard the explosion of bombs. When we had found every-
one again and were moving off W.O. Irving took some
photographs.
“To give the carriers maximum protection, we moved
with two sections and Platoon H.Q. forward and one
section in the rear. The going for the first couple of miles
was good. We came upon a beautiful lagoon, its placid
waters a perfect mirror for the surrounding jungle, but
of course it was no time for admiring scenic views.
“From the lagoon the track led down to the beach,
where the going was rather difficult, As the tide was


coming in we had to take an inland track for about two
miles, and this was the toughest part of the trip. We
climbed cliffs and slid down gullies, and the carriers
had a difficult time keeping up with us. By the time
we got over to the main track they had worn out their
toe nails.
“Yambo was the first village we passed. Here the
natives met us with a basket of fruit each, which was very
acceptable. The large quantity and variety of fruit was
eaten without any ill-effect.
“We moved on to Widuu, where we planned to stay
the night. This village was not inhabited, but there were
the usual signs that recently it had been occupied by the
Japanese. We decided that it was inadvisable to camp
in the village, so we made camp 200 yards on the other
side. It was an ideal camp site, with a lovely fresh stream
running through the area. Next morning, after an un-
eventful night, we packed up and moved on, crossing
the Widuu River without mishap. It was about 200 yards
wide but like most New Guinea rivers, was broken by
small islands and was not very deep.
“With the going fairly easy we made the next village
of Buiencim, a picturesque place on the beach front in
a little coconut grove. Although no longer inhabited,
the gardens and paths were in good order, and the
church, quite an elaborate affair, still had wooden forms
on its concrete floor, and there were a few fine, polished
wooden ornaments. The carriers had a meal there, but
as it was only 11.15 a.m. we quenched our thirsts with
coconut milk and then set out for Bua. This village we
found to have been badly knocked about by bombs, but
in it there was one hut, apparently having been the
chief’s, in which there were wonderful life-size carvings
of crocodiles. While we were in swimming some of the
boys pushed one of these carved crocodiles out into the
water and yelled “Look out for the croc!” Olympic


Games and world swimming records were smashed
(unofficially) right and left until the swimmers dis-
covered the joke.
“Our next village was Tamigidu. Here a branch track
led off the main one and went around the point. As a
precaution, one section was detached and sent round
with orders to contact us again at the track junction. At
the end of this small peninsula was Cape Gerhards. The
two sections met at the track junction after an uneventful
checking of the area, and we moved on to Oligidu. On
the way we came across a Jap bomber that looked as
though it had made a very forced landing indeed!
“Soon afterwards the country became very marshy. We
hadn’t gone far before some of the boys saw a large
crocodile and there were numerous footprints of others
in the mud. It was ideal croc country (for the crocs!) so
we kept our eyes open. For about a mile we travelled
through mud and water, sometimes only ankle deep and
sometimes up over our waists. The shorter personnel
were not able to keep their heads above the muddy water
in places, but their progress could be followed readily
by watching the lines of bubbles on the surface!
"We were all thankful when at last we came to the
bank of the Mongi. We pulled up on a fairly large
island, and Lieut. Home and the platoon sergeant made
a reconnaissance of the main stream. This was 200 yards
wide, running swiftly, and apparently very deep, a fact
we subsequently, verified the hard way.
“It was now 4.30 p.m. and we wanted to get across
before dark. There was a Jap barge with a wire cable
running across, so the first six got in and after a little
difficulty reached the other side. Pte Mulquinny volun-
teered to bring the boat back, as he was quite a strong
swimmer, but he had just pushed off when trouble began.
With only one in the boat it unbalanced and before
long was rapidly filling. ‘Mul’ stripped off and dived


overboard, thinking that he could grab the cable and
tow the boat. He was much mistaken. When he dived
the current caught him. He came up 30 yards or so
further down the stream, and it took him all his time
to get to the bank. The boat by this time was acting
like a porpoise and ‘Mul’s’ clothes went sailing down
the stream. The natives managed to rescue one boot,
a pair of pants, and the rifle, but everything else was
lost, including personal gear such as a watch, paybook
and other valuables. After this, we decided not to cross
that night.
“In the morning a patrol of P. 1.8., under a sergeant,
came down to the opposite bank to see what had hap-
pened, and directed us to where A and D Companies
were camped. After tightening the cable, the boat was
handled without difficulty, and the whole party crossed
in record time.
“From this time on our job was to guard rations and
ammo while A and D Companies patrolled inland. We
also escorted carrier trains that took their supplies to
them.
“Only Lieut. Home had a razor with him, so there was
a notable growth of best varieties of naval beards. In
this area we had some good meals of fish, which the
natives were wizards at getting with grenades. Main
hardship was the lack of mail and tobacco. In despera-
tion some of us took to ‘boong twist’ and ‘kanaka leaf,
and even roots which the natives described as ‘No. 1
smoke’. We didn’t quite agree.
“Thoughts of mail and tobacco were uppermost in our
minds when the barges came on sth November to take
us back to the Unit, and spirits were high when the
barges turned north for Finschhafen.”


CHAPTER V
TILLEY FORCE
Into the Unit annals must also go a record of the “ex-
pedition” by “Tilley Force” to the Mongi River from
17th October to Bth November 1943. This “force” con-
sisted of D Company, 8 and 9 Platoons A Company, and
11 Platoon B Company Australian Infantry
Battalion with two sections B Company P. 1.8. Leaving
Lae on 17th October, it was charged with the task of
removing from the Mongi River area a force of about
200 Japanese which natives had reported there.
Heavy swell on the six-hour journey soon had the
troops involuntarily feeding the Pacific marine life. At
Hopio, 11 Platoon B Company, under command of Lieut.
S. Home, landed to patrol the coast until the main force
was contacted at Mongi River. The remainder of the
force went on and landed at Bukasip, where a beachhead
was formed by D Company and supplies and stores
landed.
No enemy was found by patrols to the east and west.
Working for the first time with P. 1.8. the troops were
greatly interested in conversations with the natives who
quickly established a reputation for matching the troops’
tallest stories with tall stories of their own. One native,
for instance, claimed to have a kind of “radar nose”
with which he could “smell out” troops and distinguish
their nationalty at a range of 50 yards. He distinguished
the “racial smells” as follows:
“Japanie, him smell like rotten fish.”
“Yank, him smell like rotten egg.”
“Aussie, him smell like P.K.”
c


By the morning of 18th October carriage of stores to
the base at Butala airstrip was complete, but all that
was found of the enemy were some old dumps and defen-
sive positions. On 20th October D Company and one
section of P. 1.8. under command'of Capt. R. B. Eames
moved north to Buga No. 1, a village consisting of one
hut and many coconut trees. Here D Company’s sgt
cook, “Boong” Carroll, showed unsuspected prowess in
scaling the trees and was immortalized by the natives’
admiring endorsement as “him No. 1 man, very strong”.
At Buga 17 Platoon commanded by Lieut. R. Dalzell
patrolled forward in the hope of finding at least rem-
nants of the Japanese force. The two Bren gunners,
“Colt” Stayner and “Obe” O’Brien, were seen to bestow
affectionate kisses on the Brens as the patrol moved off,
but they returned looking disappointed, for the area
seemed to be “Japless”. On 21st October, 16 Platoon
commanded by Lieut. F. O’Brien patrolled the Mongi
River east bank also without result.
On 23rd October Force H.Q. and one platoon A Com-
pany arrived at Buga No 1. The other platoon of A
Company had established a standing patrol with Lieut.
Hodgson in charge, at the Mongi River mouth. A long
string of boongs accompanied Force H.Q. carrying
rations and ammunition. The remainder of D Company
moved north to Bukaman Creek, another good watering
place, but again there was no sign of the Japs. On 24th
October 18 Platoon commanded by Lieut. Alcock left
on patrol to Kaming to contact 17 Platoon, returning
with picturesque descriptions of the stiff climb to the
village. D Company was then ordered to move to Kaming.
With native carrier line and four days’ rations D
Company arrived at Kaming on 25th October after six
gruelling hours of climbing. Lieut. Dalzell became very
ill and had to be carried out by native stretcher-bearers.
The rough country was quickly wearing out boots and


clothes, and the company soon became ragged and
notable for abundance of beards and scarcity of tobacco.
Seeking better water supply, the company moved to
Sambeang, 16 Platoon remaining at Kaming on the Satel-
berg track. Down the steep grade to Sambeang the com-
pany “coasted” in an hour and 10 minutes, to find that
the P. 1.8. statement that “water lik lik way down hill”
meant a too foot climb almost sheer down to reach the
stream. The water had to be hauled up this too feet.
The troops’ comments when Sgt “Crutchy” Cole carried
a bucket of water to the top, only to trip and spill it
over himself, were even ruder than the comments troops
usually make about a sergeant. Early next morning Force
H.Q. and A Company, with a huge carrier train that
looked like a “crowd scene” from a Cecil de Mille film,
arrived after having completed the journey in one day.
When on 27th October the whole force moved to
the banks of the Mongi River the troops revelled in the
green waters of the swift-flowing, cold stream. In the
next four days patrols north to Wamuki and east to
Moikisung still found no trace of the enemy.
Patrolling troops and P. 1.8. section brought back
some native recruits, one of whom insisted upon having
his “de facto wife” with him. Next day it was noticed
that the native boys had taken much more pains with
their “toilet”—such being the power of woman!
And there was that gramophone with one record that
sent the plaintive strains of “Begin the Beguine” like an
incessant echo floating down the Mongi.
And the story of a certain nameless officer (whose
initials may be R.8.E.) who selected a dry hot day for
laundering, only to have his “washing” deluged by a
tropical shower when it was almost dry. He is reported
to have wandered dejectedly round the camp for the
remainder of the day clad only in “gaiters, American”,
and hat.


Meantime on the beachhead the troops under Lieut.
Jarman were keeping forward elements well fed, sending
supplies by carrier train, nevertheless sinister references
were made to “spine-bashing” and “expanding waist-
lines” and “bludgers on the beach”.
On goth October D Company was ordered to move to
Wamuki village to establish a base. In this village 18
Platoon had lived like kings, the natives keeping them
well supplied with firewood and European vegetables.
Heavy rain delayed the company’s departure and the
swollen river had to be waded chest-deep or crossed by
a fantastic native vine bridge on which some of the more
daring troops performed wire-walking feats never seen
in any circus.
After having marched for two hours on ist November,
the company was instructed to return to the beachhead.
Spirits sagged and before the onslaught of thirst, weari-
ness, and the yearning for a “smoke”, pride wilted.
Troops “bit” the natives for “smokes”. “Boong twist”
and native-cured leaves were the two varieties offering.
The troops had a technical classification of the two
varieties. “Boong twist” was comparatively mild, as it was
only necessary to hold on to saplings while smoking it.
"Boong leaf”, however, was more virile stuff, and while
smoking it you needed the support of a healthy tree.
On 2nd November, Force H.Q., A Company, 16
Platoon, D Company, P. 1.8., and carriers moved back to
the beachhead, leaving the remainder of D Company to
move back after a spell. D Company moved four hours
behind Force H.Q. and camped at Bukaman Creek that
night. Meantime two police boys had travelled to Eiba-
bang to instruct natives to search for a parachute which
had been seen from the air. Eibabang was an occupied
village two days’ march from Kulungtufu, where natives
said there were “plenty too many Japanie”, which the
troops freely translated as “a hell of a lot of Japs”.


One of the police boys passing through on the way
to the beach said that the other boy had injured his leg
and was coming on later. Long after dark a series of
blood-curdling yells rang out in the darkness and then
there was the ominous click of rifle bolts. A curt chal-
lenge brought the words: “Don’t shoot, mass, don’t
shoot! Me police boy, plenty buggar up finish!”
Next morning the company rejoined the remainder
of the force at the beachhead where for several days
theirs was a life of leisure, sunbathing and comparative
luxury while the arrival of barges was awaited. On Bth
November the force embarked for Finschhafen there to
rejoin the Unit and regale it with picturesque accounts
of “life on the Mongi”.


CHAPTER VI
LAE TO BONGA
8th October-2nd December 1943
Stiffening enemy resistance at Finschhafen led Unit
“prophets” to suggest that this would be the Unit’s next
location, and orders received on 28th October proved
them to be right. The Unit was to assemble on the Lae
beach at 2 a.m., which meant little or no sleep for
anyone. However, for a Unit which had been unsuccess-
fully seeking the Jap in various areas many believed
that there might be something prophetic about the title
of the Clark Gable-Lana Turner film screened a few
hours before the embarkation, “Somewhere I’ll Find
You”.
By midnight the convoy of trucks was rolling towards
Lae; by 4 a.m. troops and stores were aboard the barges
and the nine-hour trip began.
Some troops, who seemed to spend most of the trip
hanging over the side of the barges apparently staring
moodily into the depths, rather suggested that “the
rollin’, rockin’ rhythm of the waves” isn’t all the song-
writers imagined.
The Unit landed at Kedam beach and went inland to
a bivouac site opposite 2/3rd Pioneer Battalion in a
coconut plantation. It was now a completely infantry
Unit, without a vehicle of any description. Working
parties had to be organized for speedy movement of all
stores from the beach to make way for urgent supplies
for the battle in progress on the Satelberg road and
Song River. It was here that the ground-sheet “doover”


first became a recognized dwelling for members of the
Unit.
Taking its part in the defence of Finschhafen, the
Unit sent out patrols over the western approach tracks,
but no enemy was sighted. The Tank Attack Platoon and
Medium Machine Gun Platoon were detached on beach
defence, while Maj. Lovejoy was responsible fbr defence
of Langemak Bay. The Japanese, taking advantage of this
period of moonlight, again used the nuisance tactics
of sending over lone bombers which succeeded only in
causing considerable loss of sleep. There were no
casualties or damage.
On 15th November the Unit came under direct com-
mand of Ninth Australian Division, as Divisional
Reserve, for the attack on Satelberg beginning on 17th
November. In readiness for this task the Unit, less un-
essential stores, moved to a new bivouac area at Easy
Street on the Quoja River banks. Wild speculations
regarding the Unit’s probable role in the battle for
Satelberg were indulged in, and details of the battle
were followed with avid interest.
The Japs varied their “lone bomber” tactics by twice
sending over a flight of ten and fourteen bombers
respectively. The swish of bombs on the second raid
caused a general exodus to the slit trenches, but no
bombs fell in the Unit area, though a workshops unit
only 200 yards away suffered casualties.
On 20th November orders were received that the
Unit was to relieve the 2/15th Battalion of the defence
of the lower part of the Satelberg road. The C. 0., com-
pany commanders, platoon commanders and section
leaders reconnoitred the new area immediately, but it
was not until 26th November that the Unit moved to a
new bivouac area near these positions. Finally relief of
the 2/isth Battalion was completed on 28th November
and the Unit reverted to command 4th Australian In-


fantry Brigade for administration but remained under
command of 20th Australian Infantry Brigade for opera-
tions.
Meanwhile the attack on Satelberg by 26th Australian
Infantry Brigade had been successful and it was now
apparent that the next attack would be along the coastal
track northwards from Gusika.
Soon afterwards the Unit was told that the Brigade had
been allotted this attack, and that the Unit would be
leading battalion with tank support. It seemed that at
last the Unit would be able to put into practice some of
the things it had learned at the wearying Milne Bay
exercises.
Use of tanks in the attack made it imperative that
the leading company should be trained in tank warfare.
D Company was relieved by A Company 22 nd Battalion
and with A Company trained with tanks on goth Novem-
ber and Ist December. Lectures on tank co-operation were
given by experienced officers of the 2/48th Battalion.
These few days were full of ceaseless toil for B Echelon
in equipping the Unit for action and moving all un-
necessary stores to the Brigade dump.
On 31st November an almost unbelievable message was
received that 28 personnel were to “proceed on leave”.
This increased the work of the Unit’s staff, but the leave
draft departed in the opposite direction to the remainder
of the Unit on Ist December.
Late on the night of Ist December final orders were
issued for the move to the assembly area at Bonga on
2nd December 1943.


CHAPTER VII
ACTION: BONGA TO FORTIFICATION POINT
And now for the story of the Battalion’s victorious cam-
paign in the Huon Peninsula, one of the chapters in the
larger story of Japan’s retreat after having threatened
the Australian continent. For the Battalion it was a
triumphant climax to weary months of training and
hard work and the other glamourless tasks that go into
producing the co-ordinated, disciplined fighting force.
Before a single Japanese was encountered (except from
the air) the Unit had to wage a relentless fight against
the tropical scourges which in that formidable country
always take a heavier toll than the more tangible enemy.
A few important events prefaced the Unit’s appear-
ance in the firing line on the morning of sth December
1943, as point battalion in the peninsula advance. The
Battalion had been placed under direct command of
Ninth Australian Division as reserve for the attack on
Satelberg by 26th Brigade. When this was completed the
Battalion took up a defensive position on the Satelberg
road and reverted to the command of 4th Brigade. Mean-
time 24th Brigade had followed up the original landing
of 20th Brigade on Scarlet Beach by pushing up the
coast to Gusika. 4th Brigade now had orders from Ninth
Division to take up the advance from 24th Brigade and
move northwards along the coastal strip, with the final
Brigade objective of securing the beach at the mouth of
the Masaweng River and Fortification Point.
On 2nd December the C.O. received orders from the
Brigade commander that the Battalion would lead the
advance along the coastal track. 22nd Battalion was to


secure a bridgehead over the Kalueng River at Gusika.
The task of 37752nd Battalion was to be left flank of the
advance. Next morning aerial photographs were sup-
plied covering the operational area, and proved in-
valuable. The C.O. moved forward with all company
commanders and the Intelligence officer to make a close
reconnaissance of the area, selecting a suitable assembly
area and determining a probable start line for the
attack. Subject to a crossing of the river by the tanks
supporting the attack it was proposed to go forward on
the morning of 4th December. However, the crossing
was extremely difficult at this stage and moreover the
bridgehead was not well enough established. The Japs
were bitterly contesting the efforts of 22nd Battalion,
despite liberal use of artillery on their positions. After
this postponement orders were revised and re-issued late
on the afternoon of 4th December but soon afterwards
the C.O. was again called to Brigade H.Q. and the orders
were further supplemented. The tank difficulties had
been overcome and the bridgehead was established over
the Kalueng.
To D Company fell the honour of initiating the
attack. The start line was to be 300 yards north of the
Kalueng in the kunai. At 7 a.m. D Company was to cross
it under cover of a 10-minute artillery barrage which
would then lift in bounds of 100 yards or as determined
by the forward observation officer. B Company was to
take the responsibility of clearing the left flank after
contacting 22nd Battalion’s forward troops, by moving
round the western edge of the timber beyond the river.
Their progress was to be dependent on D Company’s
success in the coastal strip where stiff resistance was
expected. As usual in jungle operations a reliable
estimate of enemy strength was impossible, but the Japs
appeared at this stage to be well organized and equipped


and, as usual, fanatical defenders of the prepared posi-
tions.
Long before dawn on sth December the Battalion
was ready for the most momentous day in its history.
For most of the men it would be their first experience
of battle at close quarters. Training and leadership were
to receive their ultimate test, but morale was high, and
there was firm confidence in the supporting arms, those
of 56th Battery of 2/6th Australian Field Regiment, C
Squadron of Ist Australian Tank Battalion and A Com-
pany 2/2nd Australian Machine Gun Battalion. The
moral and practical value of their help, and consequent
saving of lives, was to be deeply appreciated in the days
to come.
The Bonga-Gusika track had its limited capacity taxed
to the utmost that morning. Tanks, machine guns and
infantry toiled forward in the impenetrable darkness
which makes night movement in New Guinea all but an
impossibility. Still, with a big job on hand all obstacles
vanished before the tense enthusiasm of the moment.
By dawn the Unit was taking up its position in the
assembly area chosen, and D Company awaited the laying
of the start line. This ticklish job was carried out at
7 a.m. by Cpl Paddy Guilfoyle and Pte George Wilmot,
of the Intelligence Section, and 20 minutes later the
company started to advance from the river bed, with
300 yards to cover before zero hour. Lieut. Purbrick
took 16 Platoon to the right and Lieut. Godfrey moved
left with 17 Platoon while Company H.Q. and 18
Platoon under Lieut. Alcock followed. D Company was
led now and throughout the whole campaign by Capt.
Ray Eames, with Lieut. Jarman second in command.
The tanks moved with the infantry and many a silent
prayer went up that their co-operation would be possible
despite the difficulties of the thick, tangled jungle and


the narrow track winding over creek beds whose depth
and steepness could only be guessed at.
Before the actual start line could be reached, the Japs
opened fire on our forward troops, and their light
machine guns, rifles and mortars warned that here again
they were prepared for the same dogged resistance that
they had offered at Finschhafen. The artillery barrage
had gone down as scheduled, but it soon became apparent
that help from this quarter would be limited by the diffi-
culty of isolating targets.
The forward troops continued to forge ahead despite
the fire and lack of targets, adopting arrow-head forma-
tion to minimize risks. By this time the tanks had crossed
the kunai with them and entered the timber. The narrow
track allowed only movement in line ahead. Soon the
slow, menacing fire of a “woodpecker” (Japanese heavy
machine gun) was heard, but although the tanks used
their Besas and howitzers in reply they could not find the
target.
Company H.Q. and the rear platoon were still crossing
the kunai while Jap positions on the left flank continued
firing through the long grass. The first tank had now
reached the first creek in what was known as the “Huts”
area. The rear elements of the company entered the
timber where the third and last tank was nosing its way
along the track.
Then there was news of a minor disaster—a land-mine
had blown the tracks off the leading tank, putting it out
of action. While the type of country limited the effective-
ness of tanks their presence was so reassuring to “foot”
troops that loss of one of the three tanks so early in the
attack was a severe blow.
However, the two forward platoons were still making
good progress, going up on each side of the track despite
the continued activities of snipers and machine gunners.
First casualty was L/Cpl Killalea, who was wounded.


Soon afterwards Sig. Cressington also fell wounded, and
members of the Sig. Platoon quickly realized that the
men responsible for maintaining communicatons had a
tough assignment. From the first the platoon was short-
handed, and throughout the operations very few signal-
lers were left at H.Q. The hard-working Pioneer Platoon
was often called on to help with the transport of equip-
ment and cable.
The signallers nearly suffered another early casualty
as Sig. Holmes, taking cover in the lead-swept kunai,
slid feet-first into a cosy site already selected and occupied
by Capt. Eames. Then Sig. Holmes discovered that a
bullet had passed through his gaiter and trouser-leg,
merely scorching his skin.
Then more bad news was received from the tanks.
Reaching the creek where the first one had been put
out of action, the other two found the creek such an
effective natural tank obstacle that they could not cross
without engineer assistance. The troops, for the time
being, would have to go on without tank support.
But D Company found heartening signs as it forged
ahead; in many places there were signs that the Japs
had retreated hastily from their positions. The artillery
had now ceased to give assistance as the troops were
completely cloaked by the dense timber, and the forward
observation officer (F. 0.0.) found it difficult to keep
track of troops’ movements.
While D Company pushed along the line of the track
on the right flank, B Company was completing its task on
the left. The first task was to contact two companies of
22nd Battalion still in the positions won to protect the
bridgehead they had gained on the previous day. These
were beyond and to the left of the morning’s start line,
entrenched on the small, timbered creek running up
the first re-entrant beyond the Kalueng.
10 Platoon which went to the left, struck opposition


from well-concealed positions on the far side of the
creek. There were no casualties but it was decided to
adopt a defensive role to hold the Japs on the flank and
thus prevent any encircling move from this direction.
Here the platoon remained until early afternoon. The
other platoons of B Company moved on the right and
although snipers took pot-shots at selected targets among
the ranks of 12 Platoon, no hits were scored and 22nd
Battalion was eventually contacted.
Crossing a track 12 Platoon paused at the creek to
await developments from a patrol of 11 Platoon, which
passed through the 12 th, drawing heavy fire from enemy
on the right. It was decided to send two patrols up the
north bank of the creek. Lieut. Home, of 11 Platoon,
took out one patrol but snipers and well-concealed light
machine guns forced the party to go to ground. Every
move brought heavy fire from the Japs who were so
strongly entrenched that it was decided to return and
pass back what information had been obtained.
Lieut. Home was in the act of describing the happen-
ings to Capt. Fletcher, O.C. B Company, when he was
killed by a sniper’s bullet. His platoon set out to avenge
his death, moving in extended line through the thick
scrub. Snipers were still active, however, and L/Cpl
Keenan was wounded. L/Sgt Curtin, who was nearest the
wounded man, applied a field dressing while bullets
whistled over them as they sheltered in what little cover
they could find.
As the enemy fire remained heavy a withdrawal was
staged, but the sergeant and his wounded companion,
isolated from the remainder of the platoon, were faced
with the problem of frustrating the snipers, who were
still active. Their plan was simple and effective—they
rose suddenly and ran in opposite directions, eventually
rejoining the platoon.
Company H.Q. and 11 Platoon decided to dig in


temporarily while the remainder of the company moved
back to cross the creek at the main track. This move was
marred by an accident when a bulldozer, making a cross-
ing for the tanks, struck an undetected land-mine which
exploded. Ptes Bish and Steel were wounded by shrap-
nel and Cpl Hunt and L/Cpl Nathan suffered shock.
The remainder continued to follow the north bank
of the creek, but ran into a miniature, Japanese-made
hell. Snipers opened up, and first casualties in this
advance were Lieut. Routley and Pte McDonald. Lieut.
Routley was in command of 2 Platoon in B Company’s
attack. With no other officer in the vicinity, Sgt H.
Herring took command of the platoon and maintained
the attack’s momentum. His initiative and drive in this
action earned him the Military Medal. He was ably
assisted by Sgt Strahan. These two junior leaders set a
high standard of leadership in the first day’s fighting.
Pte Weatherall, forward scout of the leading 1 o Platoon,
sighted a sniper and began to work his way into a good
fire position. Pte Crisp was wounded in the leg, and
another shot pierced the magazine of Cpl. Lott’s Owen
gun, then going through his pouches and grazing his
side. As enemy fire was intense and showed no sign of
abating, it was decided to pull out, but when the men
re-grouped it was found that Pte Weatherall was missing.
Sgt Strahan, now acting platoon commander, sent some
men back to look for him, but the Japanese fire was
even heavier, and after L/Cpl Hutchinson had had a
narrow escape from a sniper, the men were forced to
postpone the search. Later in the afternoon it was found
that Pte Weatherall had fallen victim to another sniper
and his body was recovered. It was decided to dig in
on a good site south of the creek, where a perimeter was
formed for the night.
12 Platoon, seeking the source of fire that had caused
the casualties already mentioned, was met by another


hail of bullets, this time from the right flank. As it was
considered that tank support would help against the
Jap positions, two tank officers came forward for re-
connaissance, but as the tank crossing was not yet ready,
the platoon joined 10 Platoon in its perimeter.
Earlier D Company had reached the northern edge of
an old, neglected native garden in the midst of dense
timber, south of the lagoon that linked with the sea.
Patrolling revealed that the Japs had left the immediate
vicinity, but as the creek where B Company had been
engaged was by no means clear, D Company was ordered
to form a perimeter and remain there for the night.
While D Company was going into perimeter, a patrol
from 18 Platoon found a L.M.G. post about 200 yards
away to the north, but it did not cause undue concern.
This patrol also sighted six Japs and killed one of them.
While digging in on their return they heard sounds
which indicated that the Japs were likewise engaged.
Artillery support was called for and the area forward
was shelled to the limit of safety.
C Company had a quiet day, its only activity being a
patrol under Lieut. Brearley which moved through the
thick jungle and swamp south of the lagoon and to the
right of D Company. They found nothing apart from a
few abandoned positions.
Battalion H.Q. had moved across the kunai beyond
the river and eventually formed a perimeter with C
Company on the track near the first garden. A Company
also moved up and dug in for the night behind D Com-
pany.
About 7 p.m. the C.O. issued orders for the following
day’s attack, to the Battalion “O” group. The first day’s
fighting had not been as decisive as had been hoped, but
the individual troops, most of whom were having their
first taste of battle, had given a fine account of them-
selves, despite casualties and discouragements, including


the temporary loss of tank support. However, the tank
commander and engineers were working vigorously to
get the tanks back into the fray. D Company had dis-
tinguished itself by a brilliant push forward and the stage
was set by B Company’s activities for the clearing of
the Japs from some particularly strong positions on the
creek.
During the night artillery and mortars pounded the
Jap positions, and Jap mortars retaliated but caused no
casualties or damage.
At first light on the sixth, artillery shells poured into
the Japanese positions in and around a native garden
west of the lagoon. A Company moved forward un-
opposed along a track that led off west to the main track,
on D Company’s left flank. Two platoons were forward,
and a thickly undergrown jungle made progress slow
and tiring. 8 Platoon was on the right, and the two
forward sections passed beyond a small coral cliff that
lay before the garden, reaching a barely discernible foot-
pad crossing the creek. Pte Clarke was forward scout, and
when he saw movement in the thick, low scrub the
section was called up close enough to hear voices. At
first it was suspected that there were natives in the
garden, whose sympathies might be for or against us,
as it was known that the Japs sometimes employed them
as carriers. Doubts were soon resolved by the clattering
of their light machine guns being hastily assembled.
Then two Japs came in view within Owen range. Pte
Clarke was first to observe the results from his fire. L/Cpl
Kirk also found a target, but a “woodpecker” hidden in
the thickets gave a slow, answering burst, and bullets
tore into the trees above Pte Clarke’s head. Pte Power
had a moment of great apprehension when he felt some-
thing trickling down his leg, but found that it was only
water from his bullet-punctured water-bottle.
Meanwhile 7 Platoon had moved up on the right to
get within range of the woodpecker. Cpl Taubman
D


claimed a victim early in the engagement, but found
that his section, in its eagerness to get into the fight, had
been cut off from the remainder. Cpl Tomlinson’s section
moved round the left of the track but ran into light
machine gun fire. Pte Smith was hit in the leg and was
heard to call out “The b got me!” Further bursts of
fire continued to harass the remainder of the section,
and its leader was the next victim, being wounded in
the thigh. As he fell he pointed to a tree from which he
had been “sniped”, but Capt. Petersen, who was nearby,
tried unsuccessfully to find the sniper.
9 Platoon had been sent to the left flank to hold the
high ground while the remainder of the company probed
the jungle. From their positions they could not see the
enemy, but turned their fire against his approximate
positions. A Jap machine gun gave one long answering
burst and then was silent. Either the Japs, fearing an
outflanking move, had withdrawn, or a lucky shot had
disposed of the gunner. Subsequently it was found that
the enemy had pulled out, following this engagement
at close quarters.
A patrol from 9 Platoon under Cpl Pemberton set
out up the gully to the south where signs of recent
occupation were found in the form of fresh footprints
and a heavily used footpad. As there was no sign of hostile
movement, the patrol returned. This was the creek where
C Company later had considerable trouble.
Pte Pollard of 9 Platoon took time off to answer an
urgent call of nature, but was startled to find a grenade
falling almost into his lap. Abandoning what conventions
regard as an indispensable item of male attire, he bounded
out of the danger zone. The grenade was a “dud”, how-
ever, and he was able to dress decorously again.
The remainder of the company now left 9 Platoon
sitting on the high ground and pushed along the track,
having had the help of an artillery barrage. It had been


noticed that artillery gained much effect from tree bursts,
as pieces of shrapnel were apt to fly in all directions.
D Company had begun a forward move early in the
morning, with 16 and 18 Platoons taking the lead. It
was not long before the familiar burst of a Jap light
machine gun met them, coming from somewhere between
the two tracks that led away to the north on the inland
side of the lagoon.
Cpl Deslandes’s section was under fire from the usual
well-hidden positions and lost touch with the other sec-
tions who could not pin-point the source of the fire. A
woodpecker and light automatic caused casualties on our
side, and while the site of the first outbreak was receiving
attention diversionary fire was encountered from a wood-
pecker placed further up the track.
Cpl Deslandes was killed when within a few yards of
the first enemy heavy gun. Although he had been already
wounded four times he went forward heroically but was
hit again just as he was pulling the pin from a grenade
to attack the gun position. He fell and the burst of the
grenade killed him.
About the same time Pte Pilgrim was seriously
wounded, and died soon afterwards. Both bodies were
carried to the track and Chaplain Reis performed the
burials while the battle continued.
In this fierce engagement, after which the bodies of
six Japanese were counted, Ptes Paton, Toner and Duck-
worth were wounded, and the only remaining member,
Pte Pike, was suffering from shock as the result of a
grenade burst. The remainder of 18 Platoon were now
re-grouped and with the help of 17 Platoon made a con-
certed drive on the troublesome spot. They found that
the Japs had made a hasty exit, leaving no stragglers.
About midday Battalion H.Q. moved forward to the
creek below the lagoon and it was arranged that A Com-
pany, which had already taken over the forward role,
should put in a supported attack north of the lagoon,


while C Company was to operate in clearing the creeks
to the west of the line of advance.
Leaving 9 Platoon on the high ground, A Company
went forward with 7 Platoon in front and climbed Bald
Hill, a large kunai-covered feature north-west of the
lagoon. Cpl Taubman and Pte King sighted what they
at first took to be an American, but soon decided that he
was of another colour and gave him his entitlement. He
was seen to execute a lively jig, which was cut short
when Ptes Nipple and White intervened, leaving no
doubt as to his fate.
The company went into a wide perimeter on high
ground in the kunai. A number of troops with full equip-
ment were seen on the left flank and for awhile they
were mistaken for C Company. The artillery support
which had been ordered was held after one shell had
fallen near these troops, but after the forward observa-
tion officer had satisfied himself that they were Japanese
the shoot continued.
The assaulting troops then attacked successfully, and
carried forward to the track junction near Gnaopoa
village. A few Japanese were killed in this advance
against weak opposition, without any losses on our side.
A Company now linked with D Company, which had
captured a mountain gun and ammunition at the north-
west end of the lagoon. The gun was already packed,
apparently in preparation for being moved back with the
enemy retreat, but the retreat was not “according to
plan”. D Company thus had the honour of capturing
the first gun of this type in the Finschhafen area.
A Company now sent for 9 Platoon, but as it was
getting under way grenades came hurtling from high
ground which the Japanese still held. The platoon,
escaping damage or casualties, followed the signal wire
back to its company, patrolling carefully as it went. On
its safe arrival, a perimeter was formed at a point on
the higher track north of Gnaopoa.


D Company patrolled the area north of the lagoon
beyond the limits of A Company’s advance into Gnaopoa.
No movement was found, so the company went into
perimeter at the track junction south of A Company and
near the north-west corner of the lagoon.
A valued trophy was secured by Lieut. Purbrick’s
platoon while patrolling that afternoon, when it found
a large flag flying from a coconut tree near the village. It
was promptly collected by Sgt Carroll as a souvenir. As
it bore none of the characteristic Japanese markings, it
was thought to be a German mission flag. The names of
the then serving members of the Unit were inscribed on
this flag and it was brought back to Australia to be
proudly displayed at reunions.
In the morning, while A and D Companies were carry-
ing the attack forward, C Company had been given the
initial task of clearing the enemy pocket that had given
trouble the previous day near the track junction, south
of the lagoon. Its job proved easy, as the Japs had de-
cided to pull out of the area. Patrolling of the creek
area to the native garden was completed within an hour,
and the company then began to comb the area up to the
east end of the lagoon to ensure that the ground gained
by D Company’s advance was thoroughly cleared of the
enemy.
During these operations no contact was made with the
Japs, however, and the garden was reached by 2 p.m.
While A Company attacked in the afternoon, C Company
was to make sure that the creeks running west of the
lagoon into high, rugged country were thoroughly
cleared, as many timbered gullies might have given the
enemy shelter.
The temporary calm was to be broken, however. With
13 Platoon forward, the company moved to its task with
the idea of reaching the headwaters of the creek and
making a downward sweep towards the track. It had not


gone very far into the doubtful zone when the leading
platoon came suddenly on the waiting Japs. Cpl Henry,
the leading scout, found himself literally on top of a
Japanese machine gun post. It was difficult to say who
were the more surprised, but not difficult to decide who
made the more serious tactical error. “Don’t shoot,
master, me native boy, want to go through,” one Jap
said, trying an old ruse. He “went through”, all right-
through to his ancestors, by courtesy of Pte O’Connor,
who was with Cpl Henry. The other members of the gun
crew accompanied him, and the section took cover while
it debated the next move.
Orders were received to move ahead, and Cpl Henry
advanced smartly up the gully, looking for the next
enemy post. Sighting one, he tossed a hand grenade which
fell accurately enough, but failed, to explode. That “dud”
probably cost Cpl. Henry his life, for as he was in the
act of tossing a second grenade he was killed by a burst
of machine gun fire. Pte Hayes, who was within a few
feet of him, was wounded in the shoulder but was able
to move back with the remainder of the section.
Meantime the Japs had opened up with rifle grenades
which fell among the troops, but the only other casualty
at this stage was L/Cpl Lemin,* who was wounded by
a flying fragment. While the Japs continued to fire
spasmodically the platoon withdrew about 150 yards.
Then it was found that Pte Monti was missing, and Ptes
Lewin and Gray made a search for him, eventually find-
ing him temporarily pinned down. The whole party
then returned safely to a perimeter arranged after join-
ing two other platoons. Meantime Japanese grenades
continued to come over, but most of them failed to
explode. They would not bear comparison with our
deadly “36” grenade.
A 10-minute artillery barrage was then called on to
soften the opposition, and when the company went for-
* L/Cpl, later m.i.d.


ward again it found that the Japs had hastily retired
from their positions, in which they had had no time to
dig in.
C Company now moved into position in the kunai
and made its perimeter beyond the higher track leading
past the south-west corner of the lagoon.
B Company had a quiet day following the hectic pro-
ceedings of its opening engagement. In the morning the
men moved up the track after C Company had checked
the creek area. The lead was taken by 11 Platoon, but
no enemy was seen. One section patrolled round the
creek to the west without result, and in the afternoon
the company reached the garden south-west of the lagoon
where it went into perimeter after incidental patrolling.
Several enemy dead were found in the garden, and L/Cpl
Cullen found a Jap 89-type discharger. A lone Jap was
also sighted, but vanished before a suitable reception
could be arranged for him.
The advance during the day had taken the forward
elements well beyond the lagoon area, that prominent
landmark in the Unit’s story of this campaign, and it
seemed certain that at least the area immediately round
it and Gnaopoa village was clear of enemy. However, it
seemed equally certain that the Jap had not yet been
dealt a decisive blow. His resistance was still stubborn
and bitter, despite his tendency to retire after our
determined attacks on the pockets so far encountered.
The high ground to the left of our line slowed up
the speed of advance to some extent, and the country
so far covered provided the usual violent contrast of
low jungle and high, rocky kunai, interspersed with
creeks that became mountain gorges in their upper
reaches.
The morning of 7th December saw C Company make
an early start to reach the high ground almost 800 yards
west of Gnaopoa, from which could be obtained a good
view of the country ahead, running down to the Tunom


River, to the north. The company had reached its im-
mediate objectives by 9 a.m. From here it was intended
to sweep down on enemy hide-outs, and for the remainder
of the morning the company remained in perimeter in
readiness for the attack.
A Company sent a patrol out early to investigate a
report that a Jap had been seen on the kunai spur nearby.
A hostile party was identified moving in the long grass
but too far away to justify pursuit. Two sections (3 and
9) protected the forward observation officer who moved
up to an observation post (0.P.) established on the
high ground beyond the company area.
Our machine gunners relieved the platoon of 2/2nd
Machine Gun Battalion and took up position at the
O.P. Then the F. 0.0. (forward observation officer) came
back, leaving the two sections and the Vickers platoon.
A Jap artillery shell landed near the 0.P., killing Pte
Richardson and wounding Cpl Pemberton in the head,
as well as a member of 2/13th Battalion. The little
garrison was forced to retire for a time, but was soon
able to return to its post.
A patrol sent out under L/Cpl Kirk passed through
the O.P. and had made little headway when more shells
began to fall. One member of the patrol—Pte Brennan
—was wounded, and Pte Dutton, the medical orderly
attached from 9 Platoon to attend the casualties, was
also hit. The patrol then withdrew under orders, and
although the enemy guns had ceased, artillery fire was
brought down on their probable positions.
B Company had moved along the coastal track and
was accompanied for part of the way by the Brigade
commander, Brig. Edgar, who was visiting the forward
areas that morning.
10 Platoon was in front and soon met a concentration
of fire from rifles, machine guns and mortars. Pte Nealer,
the second scout, fell victim to a sniper and was sent
back to the R.A.P., where he died of wounds. Pte Sid


Cooper was moving into a fire position with his Bren
when he was hit in the shoulder. There were many
narrow escapes from bursting grenades, but their effect
was lessened by the thick kunai.
The vanguard of 11 Platoon, represented by 4 and
5 Sections, took a track that led towards the sea, and
4 Section came under fire. Sgt Mclntosh then ordered
them to draw back but 5 Section by this time were in
cover. Soon 4 Section were able to move on, believing
their companions to be following. They ran into a fresh
hail of bullets, and the slow note of a woodpecker
sounded its grim warning. Only then did members of
the section discover that they were alone in the advance
into extremely hostile country, but luckily they were
able to get back to the remainder of the platoon.
The company runner, Pte Rosewarne, then arrived
with orders to move forward. Despite the difficulties,
they were able to reach a dry creek bed near its entrance
to the sea, about halfway between the lagoon and the last
creek before the Tunom.
11 Platoon then crossed a track leading north and
hoped to link up with the other platoons which mean-
time were pushing up the main track. Suddenly fire
came at them from three directions. Pte Traynor had his
hat pierced by a burst of machine gun bullets, and
another bullet went through Pte Friend’s water-bottle
—and it was the only full bottle in the section.
Cpl Stahl was struck by an explosive bullet. A moment
later Pte Hautot saw a Japanese sniper in a tree. Although
the sniper clipped Pte Hautot’s hand with a bullet, it
was the last shot he ever fired. His body crashed to the
ground, holed by well-placed bullets from Pte Hautot’s
Bren.
The Japs were trying old ruses to make the platoon
reveal its position. Some of them were snapping rifle
bolts and during one exchange of fire Japanese voices
were heard calling out “Let it up!” and “Cut it out!”


The patrol then withdrew so that the Japanese posi-
tions could be “done over” by the artillery. Meantime
the remainder of the company had been pinned down on
the track by heavy mortar, L.M.G. and woodpecker fire
from the front and left flank.
8 and 9 Sections moved to the left to draw fire and
allow 10 Platoon to close in, but cross fire from two
woodpeckers caused them to withdraw. They were then
joined by 11 Platoon, and at this time supporting fire
from the artillery was put down.
Cpl Bayliss and Pte Savage, of 10 Platoon, could not
be accounted for at this critical moment, the artillery
already having opened fire on,the positions where they
had last been seen. It was found subsequently that,
having been cut off early in the action, they had taken
refuge in a newly-prepared Japanese gun-pit. Perilously
close to the enemy, who fortunately did not see them,
and with our artillery shells bursting round them, they
suffered dual perils for two hours before they were able
to rejoin their platoon. They gave first-hand testimony
of the effectiveness of one of our artillery barrages com-
pared with the Japanese equivalent.
Early in the afternoon 12 Platoon re-formed and was
ordered to go through the Japanese position. Bayonets
were fixed for a charge, should this be necessary, and
the platoon advanced to the south side of a small creek.
Meantime C Company on the left flank drew enemy fire
to assist 12 Platoon to its objective.
Forward patrol work was undertaken by 8 Section,
which set out along the track and was able to pass back
word that there was nothing to be seen near what they
thought to be Japanese positions. The company then
assembled on the south side of the creek (the last before
the Tunom) and went into perimeter.
It appeared that enemy resistance at this point had
been broken, and that the task for the day was complete
so far as B Company was concerned.


Early in the afternoon C Company was still on the
high ground overlooking three creeks which ran towards
the Tunom River, then towards the sea, after linking up
in heavy timber. It was decided that 14 Platoon should
be sent down the centre creek which was also densely
timbered on both sides. The forward section (6) had
entered the timber and begun working its way down the
creek when grenades fell among the men from cleverly-
concealed Jap positions. Pte Mann was wounded, also
a member of the attached combat team from 20th Aus-
tralian Infantry Brigade. This combat team was com-
posed of selected officers and non-commissioned officers
who had had experience in jungle fighting, and whose
help and advice in the early stages greatly helped those
members of the Battalion who were still to become
battlewise.
The platoon opened a deadly fire on the probable
Jap positions with automatic weapons and grenades, but
in the sharp action L/Cpl Smith was killed and Sgt
Wilson wounded. The platoon was at a great disadvan-
tage, with the Japs occupying high ground covering the
line of advance.
6 Section then attempted a frontal attack, using its full
fire power in an attempt to break through, but it met
heavy cross fire at short range. Pte Blythe was killed and
Cpl Larkin was wounded in the wrist, but continued to
fire until a second bullet in the right forearm put him
out of action.
At the height of this bitter encounter enemy fire
switched from the front to the left flank and slightly to
the rear. While the platoon was preparing to meet this
new threat Pte Eustace was killed and shortly afterwards
Cpl Joyce and Pte Shields were wounded.
Meanwhile 6 Section, which was still forward, was
able to withdraw after the diversion of fire, but an
attempt to rescue Cpl Joyce failed because of the heavy
fire the enemy was still concentrating in this area.


The platoon then withdrew without further loss and
decided to attempt to contact A Company, which had
gone forward along the track. At first the platoon was
unable to find this company, but finally managed to
link with 9 Platoon. Both platoons then bivouacked
together for the night across a ravine above the most
easterly of the three creeks mentioned earlier. The re-
mainder of C Company eventually went into perimeter
above the headwaters of the westernmost creek, where it
stayed for the night.
Early the same afternoon A Company, less 9 Platoon,
which was left to protect the machine gunners, moved
down the creek on the left of the track. 7 Platoon was
forward with a section going along each bank and the
other section following the creek bed. While moving in
the gully Company H.Q. was grenaded, but no one was
hurt. Later on, snipers and woodpeckers opened up on
the section moving along the left bank and it was brought
down to contact B Company.
A Company then passed through B with the intention
of going into the perimeter forward of this company,
which had completed its action at this stage. As heavy
machine gun fire was being directed against the position
it had intended to hold down, the company returned to
a site near the B Company position, and established
defences for the night.
While 9 Platoon was protecting the machine gunners
at the O.P. they were fired on with rifle grenades. Maj.
Green, O.C. of the Machine Gun Company in support,
spotted smoke at the source of the fire. He jumped into
a weapon-pit on top of its two occupants, grabbed the
Bren and directed a few bursts of fire towards the tell-
tale smoke. The grenades ceased, and when 14 Platoon
of C Company made contact, they joined forces as
described near the O.P.
D Company had spent the morning quietly, and the
first move of the day was made at 2 p.m. when it set out


to push up behind B Company. It moved through A
Company and then was able to pass B Company which
was held up by the engagement previously described.
D Company’s objective was the beach at the mouth of
the Tunom, and it pressed on in this direction.
The company began to enter the belt of thick bamboo
along the coast below the river mouth, and found the
going very hard. 17 Platoon, which was forward, re-
ported the finding of a chasm 60 feet wide and from 30
to 40 feet deep, where one Jap was killed.
Pushing up on the left in trying to find a crossing,
16 Platoon came under fire from three light machine
guns and a woodpecker, and it was noticed that the Japs
had resorted to the use of explosive ammunition.
The company attempted to dig in behind 16 Platoon,
but the fire was too heavy. It was decided to draw back
behind B Company and it eventually went into peri-
meter in the kunai to the right of where the track entered
the jungle.
The day’s fighting had brought the Battalion within
striking distance of the Tunom River, where it was hoped
to establish a supply point for barges on the small beach
at the river mouth. However, the creek behind which the
forward companies were entrenched for the night threat-
ened to be a tough proposition because its precipitous
gorges offered many natural defences to a strong and
determined enemy.
The night was uneventful, but in the evening the
following day’s orders were issued by the C.O. to com-
pany commanders.
C Company was to carry the attack forward by moving
one platoon down each re-entrant. Artillery and machine
gun support was to go down at the junction of the three
creeks.
Early on the morning of Bth December the company
moved forward. 13 Platoon took the left creek bed, 14
the right and 15 and Company H.Q. went down the


centre. While 13 Platoon was moving along a footpad
on the edge of the timber, the forward scouts found the
body of Cpl Joyce, who had died of wounds received
the previous day.
Lack of activity by the enemy caused many to think
that he must have pulled out during the night, but they
changed their minds abruptly when there came a shower
of grenades and a burst of machine gun fire. Snipers
opened up and there were sounds of grenades being
struck against helmets, this being the Japanese equivalent
of pulling out the pin to detonate the charge. The platoon
returned fire with Owens, but in the sharp encounter
Cpl Hunter was killed. Lieut. Mills, the platoon com-
mander, considered that the forward sections were in
danger and they were pulled back, but 3 Section, under
Cpl Jones, remained pinned down in the kunai to the
right of the creek.
Pte Lewin was wounded in the wrist during the with-
drawal and Pte Catlin, who moved to place a field dress-
ing on the wound, was wounded in the hand. Pte Martin,
of the company aid post, met them and they were taken
to the R.A.P.
Pte Heath could not be found at this stage, and 4
Section was still detached. It transpired that the fire
against them had ceased, the only casualty being Pte
Serong, who was wounded by a grenade burst. They were
able to make their way back to a knoll from which the
machine gunners had been giving support. The journey
through the kunai had taken three hours in the intense
heat.
14 Platoon moved down the right re-entrant according
to plan, and travelled 300 yards before meeting opposi-
tion. 5 Section then went forward to cover with fire an
attack by the other sections. Their plan of attack was
based on the previous day’s experience of the siting of
Japanese positions.
Immediately they opened up they were met by heavy


fire on the right flank. First casualty was Lieut. Brearley,
who was struck in the arm by an explosive bullet and
had to be taken out.
Meantime Pte Dean’s section, the 4th, was under fire
from knee mortars and rifles. The company commander
then ordered 14 Platoon back, but before it could with-
draw, L/Cpl Crooks and Pte Price were wounded. Com-
pany H.Q. and 14 Platoon then came back to the peri-
meter of the previous night.
15 Platoon, which had moved down the creek on the
right, sent a party of three men with Cpl Howie to
observe the Jap positions. They reported having seen
a group, of seven Japs having a meal. Then Cpl Howie
guided 8 Section, with Sgt McLaren, to the spot from
which the Japs had been observed. The party dispersed
on a bank overlooking the enemy group, and by concerted
effort threw about 16 grenades and opened up with auto-
matic weapons as more bewildered Japs appeared. Terri-
fied squeals from below indicated that the men had
found their targets, but there were still many Japs dug in
out of sight of the ledge.
Recovering from their surprise, the enemy returned
heavy automatic and machine gun fire. Sgt McLaren,
firing from a kneeling position, accounted for three Japs,
and Pte Hughes was having similar success with his Bren.
Cpl Shipp, the best rifle shot in the company, was putting
his prowess to practical use. Sgt McLaren, after claiming
several more victims, was seen to fall, and it was found
that a chance shot had killed him instantly. Sgt Denny,
of the combat team, advised a withdrawal to the platoon
perimeter, but while this was being done Pte Parr, one
of the Bren gunners, was killed at his gun.
The Japs maintained exceptionally heavy fire, and
when the platoon reached the perimeter, Sgt Denny
recommended a further withdrawal. Unfortunately,
during the withdrawal Ptes Stamford and Elliott were
killed and Pte Punton wounded.


Cpl Howie made a desperate effort to get Pte Punton
to safety, after having applied field dressings with the
assistance of Pte Natoli. But while Pte Punton was being
assisted out he was wounded again, this time so severely
that it was almost certain to prove fatal. While heavy fire
still hemmed the three men in they found that a small
enemy patrol was trying to isolate them. They succeeded
in reaching a place of comparative safety just in time to
avoid encirclement by the enemy patrol. Pte Punton had
to be left in a place of concealment as his wounds were
such that he could not be carried further. When his com-
panions rejoined their patrol they found that Sgt Denny
had accounted for two of a party which had set out to
lay an ambush.
All assembled late in the afternoon at a newly-formed
perimeter, having been out of communication with the
company for the whole day. While awaiting the return of
Cpl Howie the men heard a Jap call out from nearby,
“Is that C Company?” They did not fall for the ruse,
however, and remained undetected. Eventually the
platoon was able to return to where it had spent the
previous night, and rejoined the company.
About 9 a.m. that morning Capt. Petersen, of A Com-
pany, moved out to make a reconnaissance forward of
the company’s position. He was accompanied by the
mortar sergeant and a protective patrol under Cpl Taub-
man. After they had moved about 30 yards down the
track towards where a woodpecker had been previously
reported, Cpl Taubman saw a Jap crossing the track and
at the same time noticed two enemy “doovers”—con-
cealed shelters used also for nightly habitation. Capt.
Petersen moved forward and, apparently noticing hostile
movement, tried to draw a grenade, but was shot down
before he succeeded. The remainder of the patrol re-
tired, Cpl Taubman covering the return of L/Cpl Law-
son, who had been the most forward of the party. No
further casualties had been suffered, but Capt. Petersen’s


body could not be recovered because of the heavy enemy
fire.
On their return Cpl Taubman reported to the C. 0.,
repeating his account to Capt. Eames and Lieut. God-
frey. He then guided Lieut. Godfrey’s platoon which
went forward to clear the enemy pocket. D Company
moved through A Company with 8 Platoon protecting
the rear. A Company then took up a perimeter where
it remained for the day.
The forward elements of D Company soon reached
the point where Capt. Petersen had been killed. Sgt Cole
was able to retrieve the body under cover of fire. The
Japs apparently had withdrawn slightly, but their fire
still menaced the advance. 16 Platoon made a fire diver-
sion to the right while the other two platoons went in to
engage the machine gun position which had fired on the
company the previous day.
A woodpecker and sniper fire hampered operations.
Three casualties were suffered, Cpls Jones and Stayner
and Pte Vincent being wounded. Cpl Jones was hit twice.
Cpl McNee, of 17 Platoon, determined to put the
woodpecker out of action, gathered all the grenades he
could carry, and went forward to launch his own private,
one-man onslaught on the gun position. He killed the
entire crew and the gun was captured intact.
When finally the company was able to close on the
pocket of resistance it found that the Japs had been
driven out by D Company’s vigorous attack, and the
advance was continued through dense jungle.
The deep chasm, previously reported, was encountered
near the last creek junction south of the Tunom. This
chasm was estimated to be at least 30 feet deep, 20 feet
wide at the bottom, almost bare of growth, and steeply
walled. In this advance 16 Platoon was moving on the
right and 17 and 18 on the left. Owing to the density of
the jungle, broken only by steep creek banks, the difficulty
E


of maintaining communications and the need for care
slowed up proceedings.
17 Platoon moved to a small rise from which it could
overlook the chasm. Sgt Cole brought a Bren into action
against Japs sighted below, and fire was also directed
against positions they had taken up on the opposite bank.
Up to this stage grenades had been used profusely
and to good effect by D Company, which called for fur-
ther supplies. They were brought up from A Company.
Positions on the south bank of the chasm were held
with grim determination, but early in the afternoon a
new threat appeared. L/Cpl Hamilton, a Bren gunner
in 16 Platoon, suddenly noticed an enemy O.P. appar-
ently in the act of directing fire on the company. He
soon accounted for the Jap at the 0.P., then switched
to spray the probable site of the enemy gun position.
The suspected Jap 75-mm. gun opened up at point blank
range and shells from this commonly-used mountain
artillery piece fell in 17 Platoon’s area, causing heavy
casualties. Ptes Woods and McMullen were killed, Pte
Plowright suffered wounds from which he died later, and
Ptes McNevin and McGrath were wounded.
L/Cpl Hamilton continued firing his Bren, and the
enemy shelling ceased as abruptly as it had begun. How-
ever, the Japs across the creek showed no sign of with-
drawing.
An O.P. detected enemy movement along the western
edge of a small coconut plantation north of the Tunom
River. It appeared that the Japs were preparing for a
hasty withdrawal. D Company gave them every encourage-
ment to speed up their preparations by sending over a
fusillade of rifle, Bren and mortar fire.
It was decided that the company should remain on the
south side of this natural obstacle and take up perimeter
there, but soon after 4 p.m. one platoon was able to
cross, accompanied by Capt. Wilson and a party from
B Company which had come forward to observe the


probable line of the next day’s attack. Capt. Wilson had
taken over as O.C. of B Company from Capt. Fletcher,
who had to be removed to hospital.
The gun responsible for the shelling earlier in the day
was found. Although spiked to make it unserviceable,
it was still charged and apparently had been abandoned
in great haste as a result of L/Cpl Hamilton’s deter-
mined use of his Bren against the gun position. Al-
though it was likely that the enemy had fallen back from
this area, the platoon returned with the reconnaissance
party and went into perimeter with the remainder of
the party.
A and B Companies had remained in position through-
out the day, and although little progress had been made
so far as gaining ground was concerned, enemy resistance,
which had been very stubborn, now appeared to be
broken south of the Tunom. Part of the success had
been achieved by C Company which had met the enemy
in considerable strength and, taking them by surprise,
had inflicted heavy casualties.
That day, so enemy dead and many community
graves were counted, and two days later a report was
received from Brigade that an additional 50 dead had
been found in the re-entrant where C Company had
been fighting. Considerable quantities of equipment
had been left behind and it was obvious that the enemy
had been hurtled from their strongholds in this area so
hurriedly that there had been no time to arrange an
orderly withdrawal.
The scene of C Company’s action was known there-
after to the Battalion as “Death Valley”, as it presented
such a grim picture of death and destruction when it
eventually fell into our hands. C Company had lost
many valuable lives, but in doing so it had thrown back
an enemy far superior in numbers and entrenched in
formidable positions.
That evening orders were received from the C.O. for


the push through to the Tunom. B and C Companies
were to clear out the creeks where opposition had been
so heavy on the first encounter, while D Company went
forward towards the river.
On the morning of the gth, before B Company moved
up the creek beyond the chasm, the mortar platoon
opened up on the enemy pocket still holding out, and
many accurately-placed shells made matters uncomfort-
able for any of the enemy who remained. As soon as
they sighted movement, machine gunners gave additional
support from the high ground.
C Company meantime made a feint movement beyond
the creeks, where the fight had taken place the previous
day. Japs still in the gullies were to be trapped by G
Company moving through to contact B Company.
B Company moved into the creek bed, patrolling for-
wards while 10 and 11 Platoons went to the head of the
gully where C Company had struck the stiffest opposition
the day before.
12 Platoon set an ambush for Jap stragglers who
might emerge to avoid encirclement. 11 Platoon, under
covering fire from 12 Platoon, moved so close to the
enemy positions that they could hear them talking and
digging. Pte Friend saw a Jap and fired a burst from his
Owen gun, but his target vanished. Pte Fleming went
to the top of the gully and opened up with a Bren.
There was an immediate response from the enemy, one
bullet almost severing his sling and others splinterng
the trees round hm. The bursts from his Bren severed
a tree which fell across the Jap positions.
As the enemy was entrenched strongly on high ground,
it was decided soon afterwards to pull the forward troops
back. Some snipers were active, but the move was made
without loss. Mortar support was called for again, and
120 bombs fell among the Japanese.
While 12 Platoon was still settling the ambush, Jap
stragglers moved up the gully. One walked close to Pte


Chalmers, whose aim with his Bren was unerring. Soon
afterwards he gained two more victims, and a fourth Jap,
just as he observed the bodies of the earlier victims, was
shot by Sgt Herring.
12 Platoon now moved forward to the high ground.
9 Section covered the gully to cause a diversion while
11 Platoon completed its return trip. 8 Section noticed
a Jap walking up the gully, very casually carrying his
rifle at the trail. Pte Day managed to wound him but
his Owen jammed. Cpl Gullquist finished him off with
his rifle.
While 10 Platoon was on the high ground, the only
incident was the abrupt removal of a cigarette from the
mouth of Pte Dunn by a stray bullet. His comments,
though both relevant and eloquent, are omitted.
B Company re-grouped, as a relief had been arranged
from 22nd Battalion and this arrived in the afternoon.
The company returned close to Battalion H.Q., now
established near the chasm where D Company had been
shelled the day before.
C Company observed Japs crawling up the gully dur-
ing the morning. Pte Florimel killed one, and shortly
afterwards movement was heard in all three gullies.
Nothing developed from this, and by noon they were
relieved by a company from 22nd Battalion. C Company
then returned via Battalion H.Q. to A Company’s area
near the chasm. Members of the company missing from
the previous day—Ptes Elliott and Stamford—were found
by a patrol from B Company.
Early in the morning D Company, with 17 Platoon
forward on the left under Sgt Cole, patrolled towards
the Tunom. It was reported that the coastal strip of
timber was clear, and the company moved on to secure
a beachhead at the mouth of the river and a bridgehead
for the crossing.
D Company moved up the narrow fringe of timber
without meeting opposition until it reached the track


junction below the coconuts, vyhere Pte Solomons killed
one Jap who was walking towards them, carrying only
grenades and the dial sight of a mountain gun. The
company went into perimeter, the forward elements thus
forming a bridgehead at the Tunom.
Lieut. Alcock and one section of 18 Platoon patrolled
to the beach and reported it suitable for barge landings.
16 Platoon, with the attached machine gunners in sup-
port, went forward with two detachments of mortars to
strengthen the bridgehead.
. A composite patrol from A and D Companies under
Lieut. Perry then followed the north bank of the river
to the coast for several hundred yards into the coconuts
without meeting anything. Some enemy dead and vacated
positions were noted, but apparently the Japs had aban-
doned all hope of holding out in this area.
After a very successful day without casualties but with
considerable gains in ground, all companies dug in and
had a quiet night except B Company, who were disturbed
by the screaming of a wounded Jap. Apparently he had
a companion in misfortune, as next day two were found.
One was dead and the other so severely wounded that
he soon died.
Heavy rain fell throughout the night.
The supply line by this time was rapidly lengthening,
causing problems for B Echelon, which initially had
drawn supplies from the Detail Issue Depot at Bonga.
On the sixth and succeeding days they were able to use
a freshly established depot at Gusika. Wet weather made
transport problems acute, but the creation of a Brigade
pool of vehicles enabled them to use two and sometimes
three jeeps to supply troops with ammunition and food.
They soon became accustomed to operating a “break-up
point” close to the front line, and on Bth Decem-
ber received their first allotment of native carriers
(boongs), making them to a certain extent independent
of weather.


The operation order for the attack on 10th December
was issued early in the morning. Forward Battalion H.Q.
was set up just south of the Tunom, in cover of the tim-
ber. The machine gunners in support gave five minutes’
rapid fire on the coconuts. The attack was timed for
8.30 a.m., and A Company was to move into the timber
beyond the coconuts along a small creek which flowed
into the sea at a sandy strip to become known as Coco-
nut Beach.
C Company went to the Tunom and patrolled west
along the river. One Jap straggler, with no weapons but
a few grenades, was taken by surprise and killed by
Pte White.
A Company reached the creek near Coconut Beach and
patrolled up to the creek junction without meeting any-
thing. Apparently the Japs had already retired across
the Sowi River, and were to be seen digging in on the far
bank.
Cpl Porter fired on the enemy without effect, as they
were now out of range. Patrols were sent out to search
the intervening ground to the Sowi. Meantime the peri-
meter taken up at the creek was enlarged to give pro-
tection to the bulldozer working on the crossing to
enable tanks to cross and co-operate in the attack on
Kiligia, a native village below the Sowi. Five enemy rifles
were found abandoned in this area.
B Company moved up to the creek junction and began
to patrol to the south-west along the creek. Japs were
seen moving across the kunai, but as they were out of
range, fire was held.
Early that morning, Pte Heath, who had been missing
for two days, returned to C Company and was taken to
hospital. He had been wounded, searched and left for
dead by the enemy, but had recovered and taken shelter
until he was able to get back to our lines.
The track across the Tunom was now ready for the
passage of tanks, which moved forward. It was decided


to launch the attack on Kiligia at 3 p.m. that day. This
task was allotted to A Company with mortar and artil-
lery support.
A Company withdrew along the track below Kiligia,
which had been skirted by their forward patrols, to
permit artillery fire to be brought down on the village.
B Company was to move up and cut the track leading
south-west from the village.
Supporting fire went down as scheduled, and A Com-
pany began the forward move. About this time a visit
was paid to forward Battalion H.Q. by Lt-Gen. Berry-
man, Maj.-Gen. Wootten and Brig. Edgar, who expressed
satisfaction with the progress.
A Company, with the tanks, now entered Kiligia, but
with the exception of a solitary Jap killed by one of the
artillery personnel forward with the signals, the enemy
had flown. Positions recently abandoned were found as
the only evidence of the Japanese occupation.
B Company had gone forward to its allotted task, but
had made no contact. Its communications to Battalion
were cut, but it was able to send back a report that it
had reached the south bank of the Sowi without seeing
any enemy movement. After patrolling over the high
ground and through the kunai, it reported this area clear.
A and B Companies went into perimeter for the night
near Kiligia.
This was a quiet day for D Company, which moved
across the creek south of the Sowi and remained there
for the night in a defensive position, having relieved B
Company. Ambushes were set on the north and south
arms of the creek in case enemy strayed close to the
perimeter. At last light booby traps replaced the am-
bushes, and two Japs were “scored” by 16 Platoon’s
traps which consisted of grenades in tins.
In a highly successful day further considerable advance
had been made without opposition or casualties. The
Japs apparently had decided not to contest the issue at


the Sowi River, which did not present a good defensive
line.
The Sowi was a shallow stream in a wide, rocky bed,
unlike the “milky” streams more typical of rivers in this
part of New Guinea. Beyond the river to the north
rose a large bare feature known as Scarface, from which
numerous small creeks drained the coastal strip running
up to Lakona, near the mouth of the Sanga River.
On nth December both A and B Companies sent
patrols to examine the river for tank crossings. A Com-
pany found that the river could be crossed near the
mouth, but there was a 30 foot drop 75 yards upstream.
During the search a Jap was seen across the river by Pte
Wakefield, who fired and wounded him, but he escaped.
A 75-mm. firing piece and an ammunition dump of
mortar bombs, grenades and small arms was found near
the river. Another Jap was killed, and more fresh graves
were found.
Intense patrolling continued in the jungle round
Kiligia and the coast, and was also extended 300 yards
across the river. A standing patrol was established by B
Company where the river turned north in a “U” bend.
A reconnaissance party, including members of A Com-
pany, and tank and artillery personnel set out to in-
vestigate further round the mouth of the Sowi River.
It encountered a small party of Japs, who threw grenades.
The party immediately engaged them, and although
they were able to take cover ( among rocks a tank officer
killed one at 300 yards. He was seen to fall into the sand
at the water’s edge.
A party was sent under Lieut. Hodgson from A Com-
pany to try to cut off the retreat of the fleeing Japs, but
returned after an unsuccessful search.
D Company, which had remained at the creek, set an
ambush with L/Cpl Rogers in charge. It was highly
successful, accounting for another six Japs. One was
severely wounded and was brought to the advanced


dressing station for questioning by an officer from the
Allied Translators and Interpreters Section attached to
Ninth Division. Unfortunately the prisoner died of his
many wounds before the officer arrived. His unit was
identified, but no further information could be gleaned
from his few personal belongings.
The only other contact that day was by A Company,
which fired on some Japs who apparently had been sent
back to observe our positions. Although no direct hits
were seen, the fire forced them to withdraw.
The bulldozer was working on a suitable crossing
place for the tanks at the point where A Company had
made its reconnaissance. Forward companies gave pro-
tection, and when this task was completed they began
operations on the road north of the river, while A Com-
pany stood by.
Late in the afternoon the tanks began to move over the
Sowi, and A Company, 22nd Battalion, came forward
to relieve our A Company, previously responsible for
the bridgehead.
The night was without incident.
The operations of 11th December completed the im-
mediate spearhead task of the Battalion. On the morn-
ing of 12th December Brigade Operation No. 7 was
received, giving the Battalion the task of protecting the
lengthening line of communication from the Tunom
River to the beachhead across the Sowi.
Meanwhile 22nd Battalion was to carry the attack
forward and capture Lakona, which was the next enemy
supply point to the north.
Capt. Boyd was moved to hospital that morning with
dengue fever and Lieut. Grace took over as adjutant
during his absence.
The principal activity was now patrolling by B Com-
pany, which followed the small creek branching off the
Sowi River to the north. It set out to contact 37752nd


Battalion, which had been moving up on the left flank
over high and difficult country.
The C.O. made a reconnaissance of the beachhead
area, the vital zone of the Battalion’s responsibility, and
decided to place 5 Platoon north of the river. B Company
was to watch the high ground to the left, with C Company
at the first creek south of the Sowi and A and D Com-
panies across the river and protecting the beach.
Battalion H.Q. was established in Kiligia, close to the
river and protected by the remaining platoon of A
Company. These moves were completed by mid after-
noon and there was little other activity that day.
B Company patrol contacted the flanking battalion
without meeting any Japs. Towards evening, however,
there was one kill. This was claimed by Pte Hann, and
the victim was found to be barefooted and already
wounded.
A Company found two enemy dead, and a message
from Brigade that evening told of the finding of 53
bodies in the pocket attacked by C Company, these in
addition to those already counted and buried. It had
not been possible at the time to get exact details of the
killing in that area, known as Death Valley, because it
consisted of a maze of scrub thickets and gullies, inter-
spersed liberally with rocky outcrops. These further
discoveries amply justified the name given to this minia-
ture Golgotha.
That night also passed without incident, and next
morning more patrolling was initiated by A and D Com-
panies, whose commanders moved forward to examine
the ground ahead. The patrols searched the timber west
of the company areas, but apart from seeing some evi-
dence of Jap occupation, they had nothing to report.
That day B Echelon moved up to Coconut Beach.
Its work had been made hard by the frequent moves and
the strain was beginning to tell. Evacuations to hospital


were also thinning their ranks, so the rest enjoyed by
the Battalion at this stage was doubly welcome.
Protection for Kiligia beach was increased by moving
up to this position the Tank Attack Platoon of 22nd
Battalion, also a 6-pounder and a 2-pounder of the 2/3rd
Tank Attack Regiment. The Japs, however, were too
preoccupied by the need for a speedy withdrawal to give
any trouble in this quarter.
Capt. Northcott joined the Unit that day and Lieut.
Mclntyre took over the duties of Intelligence officer from
Lieut. Pigott, who returned to take charge of the rear
details.
On the 14th the Battalion became Brigade Reserve.
A and D Companies were to hold their positions until
further orders preparatory to 20th Brigade taking over
the defence of Kiligia Beach.
As the companies were about to move forward enemy
shells landed in D Company area. Pte Stevenson was
killed and Pte Batch wounded before the position of the
gun could be pin-pointed by the artillery.
The forward moves were completed during the after-
noon and the Battalion took up positions about half-way
between Kiligia and Lakona. As 22nd Battalion’s advance
had been carried forward to the nearer approaches to
Lakona village, it was necessary to co-ordinate our moves
with their progress.
Signal communication with the forward battalion was
somewhat difficult, but a forward reconnaissance ascer-
tained that there was a gap between the rear elements of
22nd Battalion and our A Company, which was on the
track close to the second creek north of the Sowi. A
platoon of B Company was sufficiently far forward to
close the gap.
37/52nd Battalion had moved across to the high
kunai-covered slopes beyond and to the left of the line
taken up by our companies. All then went into perimeter
for the night.


Late that night the Machine Gun Platoon challenged
someone moving in the kunai just outside the perimeter.
Although the challenge was repeated, no reply was made,
so the platoon opened fire. Because of the danger of
moving outside perimeters at night the results of the
shooting could not be investigated until next morning,
when it was found that a Jap had been killed. He was
armed with nothing more dangerous than a paybook,
and apparently had been cut off by the movements of
37/52nd Battalion.
Operation Order No. 8 was received next morning.
The Battalion remained Brigade Reserve and 22 nd
Battalion was to capture Lakona and establish a bridge-
head over the Sanga. The C.O. of the 2/15th Battalion
arrived to discuss taking over the Battalion’s positions
and preparations were made to close up further on 22nd
Battalion’s advance.
A and B Companies carried out searching patrols up
the creeks running towards the high feature, in all cases
with negative results, except for the finding of vacated
positions. Battalion H.Q. moved up close behind the
H.Q. of 22nd Battalion near the third creek south of
Lakona. C and D Companies moved up close by and B
Company joined the forward platoon. A Company re-
mained in position as rearguard.
That afternoon there was almost a cloudburst, and rain
fell intermittently throughout the night. The track to-
wards Lakona was already a quagmire, having been
churned up by the tanks. Steep creek banks had several
times delayed the tanks, which at this stage were parked
behind 22nd Battalion’s H.Q.
Digging-in operations were interrupted by the down-
pour and the holes already dug quickly filled with rain
and seepage water, depriving them of their comfort for
the night’s performance, which featured Japanese 75-mm.
shells. These landed within the forward perimeter, and
two members of D Company and one of C Company


were struck by shrapnel. Sig. Baird was also wounded,
and had to be taken out. The R.A.P. had to work in the
dark and bandage by torchlight. Sgt Hough and Ptes
Manzie, Hill and Barton did everything possible to
make the wounded men comfortable.
After the shelling had ended, the aircraft warning was
given, but nothing eventuated, and the Battalion settled
down to a miserably wet and uncomfortable night.
Artillery registered on targets for the following day,
and shells whistled over our heads on the way to enemy-
occupied territory. The guns of 2/6th Field Regiment
did excellent service through the action and many lives
were saved by their accurate shooting, which softened up
strong points of resistance.
The terrific destructive power of 25-pounder shells
was shown by scarred trees and broken foliage wherever
they had registered on enemy strongholds. In later weeks
patches of brown among the uniform green of the jungle
showed where death had lurked for the Japs in these
areas. Some very convincing lessons were learned about
the value of artillery in the jungle, and apart from the
deathroll it caused, the moral effect must have contributed
considerably to our cause.
By 8 a.m. on the 16th, the rain had cleared but the
deluge of the previous afternoon had made the narrow
track an even greater morass than before. The trenches
were muddy water holes.
At 9 a.m. the C.O. of 22nd Battalion asked for relief
of his B Company which had been posted on high ground
guarding the south-west approaches to Lakona, from
which an attack might have been made on our lines of
communication. It was decided that our A Company
should take over this role, involving an arduous march
up steep slopes to gain the heights. By noon the com-
pany had taken up this position.
The Battalion now settled down to await the fall of
Lakona. The Japs hung on grimly to their positions


round the outskirts of the village, and up till this time
the tanks had been unable to move forward. However
it was hoped to use them in the final assault if the natural
obstacles in the way could be overcome. Engineers and
tank-men were working feverishly to this end.
From reports reaching Brigade early in the afternoon,
it was decided that the attack on Lakona would be
sufficiently decisive to enable the advance to be con-
tinued north of the Sanga River on the following morn-
ing. This was to provide the Battalion with another oppor-
tunity to grapple with the Japs at close quarters.
The C.O. was warned to prepare for the attack. Shortly
afterwards the company commanders of A and D Com-
panies were summoned, and accompanied the C. 0.,
Battery Commander Maj. Prichard and 1.0. on a recon-
naissance of the mouth of the Sanga.
Passing through 22 nd Battalion positions dug in on
the south side of the river, the party sought a vantage
point to view the river and the country to the north.
The Sanga was an unimpressive stream, a narrow, shallow
channel in a wide, rocky bed, its waters clouded with
lime. Further upstream, the valley narrowed to a ravine,
and it was obvious that crossings higher up the river
would be extremely difficult. Beyond the river was a
stretch of timber extending up the line of the coast
towards the Masaweng River. Behind the timber rose a
large bare feature scarred by wooded re-entrants running
up to the rocky gulches. This timber obviously had har-
boured Jap snipers, and possibly machine gun nests. Our
artillery had been busy enlivening proceedings for the
occupants.
While the reconnaissance was in progress there were
occasional shots from a still-defiant enemy. After having
determined a start line and the probable line of the
advance, the party returned and later orders were pre-
pared and issued.
An hour’s artillery barrage, augmented with mortar


and medium machine gun fire, was to precede a two-
company advance. A Company was to cross the river
near the mouth and then advance through thick jungle
along the coast. D Company’s crossing was to be about
300 yards up the river, from where it would advance over
high ground and control the left flank. An assembly
area was chosen at the first creek before the village,
where the two other companies were to await orders
while the advance secured a bridgehead.
Meanwhile, 22nd Battalion had attacked the coconut
area and with the help of tanks had cleared out the last
of the Japs. Some were seen to disappear over the cliffs,
and it was hoped that their end was speedy. The Battalion
remained in position to pin down any further movement
that might eventuate in Lakona from odd pockets of
resistance not yet cleared out.
Capt. Miller, who had given sterling service as a
medical officer, had to return to hospital for a minor
operation. His place was taken by Capt. Baker, of the
Tanks.
After an uneventful night the Battalion rose early for
the fray, and the two companies moved forward to a
point behind their respective start lines. A Command
Post was established on the south bank of the river,
and at 8 a.m. the artillery opened up with a terrific
barrage of 2000 shells.
The s/snd Machine Gun Battalion poured a hail of
fire into the timber as their contribution to a most im-
pressive overture to the attack. The troops on the start
line listened with grim satisfaction to the crackle of
the guns and the roar of the artillery.
The only unfortunate incident at this stage was when
L/Cpl Rackham, a member of the escort party with the
command group, was struck by the base plate of a shell
and suffered a nasty wound on the shoulder blade.
D Company was unable to reach the start line by
9 a.m., as 22nd Battalion was busy with one of the enemy


pockets still holding out near the river. A Company was
able to move unimpeded, and the going in their sector
was easier. Five minutes after zero hour they were
crossing the river without opposition, and soon after-
wards were fanning out in the timber.
8 Platoon was forward and 4 Section, under L/Cpl
Kirk, sighted the first Jap of the day. The section leader
brought his Owen gun into action and his first shot was
a direct hit. His gun then jammed but the Jap apparently
was in no condition to take advantage of it. L/Cpl Kirk
was instructed to take him prisoner, as prisoners were
at a premium and this looked like a good opportunity
of finding out something more about enemy intentions.
Meanwhile, Pte Porter’s section, moving on the right,
found a kunai patch athwart the track, and when a rust-
ling nearby materialized into a Jap, the section opened
fire. Pte Harris scored a bull’s-eye, and the unlucky
straggler fell dead. While Pte Harris was moving up to
examine his kill a burst of woodpecker fire passed
between his legs and five yards ahead he saw three Japs
crouching behind this formidable weapon.
Jumping forward and reaching instinctively for a
grenade he yelled, “Get down, you yellow b s!” While
the terrified gunners fumbled and jammed their gun the
grenade burst in their midst, killing them and enabling
the gun to be captured intact.
4 Section was now moving to contact Porter’s “mob”
when Pte Kidd saw a Jap, fired, and observed him fall.
Pte Clarke saw a Jap lying across a rock and fired a burst
into the prostrate figure.
L/Cpl Kirk, who was still relentlessly pursuing the
potential prisoner, examined the latest corpse and was
disappointed to find that apparently it was the remains
of the Jap he had been following. The prospective in-
formant, who had about 15 slugs well distributed over
his body, was no longer interested in anybody’s intentions.
7 Platoon, which had moved round on the left flank,
p


found a Jap light machine gun which had been deserted
by its gunner, but there was no other sign of activity,
either past or present.
The general attitude and lack of initiative by the
few enemy so far met with in the advance suggested that
the terrific pounding had left them dazed and “bomb
happy”. The punishment imposed by the supporting
arms seemed to have caused general demoralization of
the harassed rearguard.
While A Company’s triumphant progress continued
up the coast, D Company had eventually crossed the river
after being delayed half an hour by operations of 22nd
Battalion. There was no enemy opposition, the difficult
country alone hampering their progress. They forged
ahead steadily, and by noon caught glimpses of the
Masaweng River. Observation revealed that the Jap
vanguard was just crossing the river, heading north. This
information was immediately relayed back so that a
further dose of “artillery medicine” could be adminis-
tered.
D Company waited some hours in an excellent obser-
vation post, although the men sweltered in the strong
sun after the hard climb since crossing the Sanga.
There was an unexpected interlude at Lakona that
morning after the main battle had moved forward. Many
of the Japs thought by 22nd Battalion troops to have
jumped over the cliffs of Cape Sibida into the sea, had
taken refuge in caves and foxholes. Their camouflage
was so effective that our main forces moved on, and
their presence was not suspected until one indiscreet
Jap attempted to shoot up a member of the 2/2nd
Machine Gunners, who had taken part in the morning’s
“entertainment programme”. These men, veterans of the
desert, took a poor view of the lone Jap’s unfriendliness,
and immediately set out in the unfamiliar role of riflemen
to empty the caves and foxholes. Their score: 14 Japs
and considerable booty.


As it was apparent that considerable advance would
be made forward of the Sanga, B and C Companies were
called forward from their reserve positions, to close up
behind the forward companies. C Company went up to
relieve A Company, which had been halted astride the
track still within the jungle. B Company covered the
north bank of the river from a position astride the creek
on the south side. Meantime, 22nd Battalion began to
move its rear companies forward to protect our lines of
communication. 20th Brigade took over the responsibility
for rear protection.
The search of enemy dead, killed during A Company’s
move, revealed maps of Bonga and Satelberg, many
diaries, paybooks and textbooks, apparently on engineer-
ing.
A Company again moved ahead on its relief by C
Company, which in turn was relieved by 22nd Battalion,
and prepared to follow up A Company’s advance. Patrols
were sent out from A Company to search the ground
ahead, the next objective being the only creek of any
consequence between the Sanga and the Masaweng. This
appeared to be the sole remaining strongpoint left to
the enemy in its defence of the area of the Masaweng.
One lone Jap straggler discovered by a patrol was
immediately despatched by Pte Hook. After the patrols
had returned, 8 Platoon went forward to a rocky feature
overlooking the creek. D Company was instructed to
contact A Company and sent out a patrol for that pur-
pose. Hostile movement was seen north of the creek,
where Japs appeared to be carrying 75-mm. shells. Other
parties of Japs were seen among the coconuts just south
of the Masaweng.
An artillery support fire plan was arranged as a
prelude to an attack into the creek. Both forward com-
panies were brought back into a place of safety while
shells fell very accurately where most needed.
A Company then moved into attack on the right and


advanced close to the creek without opposition. With
about 30 yards to go snipers and light machine guns
indicated that there had at least been a few survivors of
the barrage.
Cpl Hall, of 8 Platoon, who was moving on the right
flank, approached the edge of the creek, but although
he heard enemy movement he could not pin-point it.
While he was investigating he was wounded and Pte
Quirk, who took over, sighted Japs in the creek. A
30 foot drop blocked the advance and the platoon had
to await further orders.
9 Platoon, on the left, saw a counter-attack threaten-
ing and promptly engaged the enemy with Brens while
Pte Ryan hurled grenade after grenade into the enemy
strongholds. Pte Clarke, acting as link between the two
forward platoons, was killed by a sniper’s bullet and Pte
Bennett was killed soon afterwards.
Orders were received •to withdraw as it was getting
late and the Japs appeared to have strong, well-concealed
positions. There was also a danger to the left flank, as
D Company was also engaged in a sharp encounter and
a considerable gap separated our forces.
The withdrawal was made as speedily as possible, but
not without further casualties. Pte Pollard was killed and
Ptes Port and Gardner were wounded. It was decided
that A Company should go into perimeter 300 yards
south of the creek. A link was established with C Com-
pany and the Machine Gun Platoon which had gone
forward to strengthen the perimeter.
Despite his leg wounds, Pte Port showed a remarkable
turn of speed when the platoon had been ordered to
take up a position of greater security. To the surprise
of his unscathed comrades, he romped home an easy
winner in a field of “triers”.
While all this was going on, D Company, which had
moved towards the creek a quarter of a mile further up,


found that it was allowed to go well forward before being
opened on with light machine guns.
It had been hoped that lateral communication could
be kept up with A Company by means of the “walkie-
talkies”. Unfortunately these would not operate at the
critical moment, and line communication was also cut
by a mishap to the sig. wires. Serious trouble might
have arisen had not a signaller been able to hook on to
the Brigade line, thus restoring a link to the rear.
The enemy dispositions were difficult to observe, and
it was considered that a better chance of success might be
given by moving round to attack from the rear. Con-
sequently the creek was bombarded with rifle grenades
and 2-inch mortars, but as progress was difficult orders
were given for a re-deployment to more favourable
ground.
Lieut. Alcock was wounded and desperate efforts were
made to bring him to safety. Sig. Pearson was also
wounded about the same time. An enemy machine gun
had now been located and was engaged and silenced. 17
Platoon was able to continue with the rescue of the
wounded. Lieut. Alcock was brought in, but he died
later of wounds. Sig. Pearson could not be found.
The company went into perimeter on higher ground
along the creek and the night passed without disturbance.
Artillery fire harassed the enemy at dusk as part of the
softening-up process in preparation for next day’s attack.
B Company had a quiet day, and after guarding the
Sanga until 22nd Battalion was able to pass through,
the company moved up in rear of Battalion H.Q. estab-
lished in the timber near the point where the coast ran
into a cliff-line north of the river mouth.
The only attempt at retaliation by the Japs was some
mild shelling just before dusk, when a few shells fell
harmlessly in Battalion H.Q.’s area.
No doubt the enemy was trying to re-assemble his
scattered forces and decide whether it would be of ad


vantage to him to contest our advance as stubbornly as
before. The day must have dealt a terrible blow to his
morale, although the dead counted were relatively few.
On the morning of the ißth, B Company was to take
over the sector previously contested by A Company. D
Company was to complete the task of clearing the upper
reaches of the creek. Support fire was to be provided by
600 rounds of artillery into the creek.
The R.A.P. moved forward soon after 7 a.m. to
a post near where C Company had spent the night, in
preparation for a general move through to the Masaweng,
which it was expected would be possible as a result of the
day’s operations.
The artillery barrage went down at 9 a.m. and B and
C Companies went forward to their tasks. B Company
was provided with additional support fire from our own
machine gunners. One Jap straggler was killed soon
after entering the creek. Orders were given to contact
D Company and to make sure the creek was no longer
giving refuge to enemy fugitives.
As patrolling continued, it was evident that the enemy
had been thoroughly discouraged. His retreat had been
so hasty that a considerable quantity of gear was left
behind. This was later investigated in greater detail by
C Company, whose role was to follow the advance through
to the Masaweng.
D Company went into its sector without meeting op-
position and patrolled the headwaters of the creek and
down to a junction. This was found to be the extreme
flank of the former Jap positions. Instructions to contact
B Company were complied with before noon, no hostile
movement being seen. A patrol also went forward to
high ground north of the creek but could not discover
a good vantage point overlooking the Masaweng.
The body of Sig. Pearson, who had died of wounds
the previous day, was discovered. There was another un-
fortunate episode when Sgt Bryce, with a section from A


Company protecting the Machine Gun Platoon, was
accidentally shot. The bulldozer, working on the track
to make it “jeepable” for the advance, caused consider-
able trouble to the sigs by cutting all sig. lines.
C Company was moving ahead with instructions to
co-operate with B Company in patrolling to the mouth
of the Masaweng. A Company moved up soon after
midday to take over from B Company at the creek and
thus enable both companies to get on with the job. By
this time the tanks were forging ahead and reviving hopes
of their help in future operations.
A dump of abandoned Jap arms was examined and
found to consist of three mountain guns, a 4-inch mortar,
a knee mortar, a woodpecker, a 37-mm. gun, two flame-
throwers as well as boxes of ammunition and explosives.
This confirmed suspicions that a hasty retreat had been
forced on the enemy, instead of a planned withdrawal.
C Company reached the mouth of the Masaweng
without contact and awaited instructions to cross. B
Company completed the task of ensuring that the creek
was clear of enemy. During the morning they met an
American on a souvenir hunt. He inquired the where-
abouts of the forward troops and on being assured that
he now had the honour of being with them, he appeared
to lose all interest in his mission, probably fearing that
his turkey luncheon might be getting cold.
The company objective was now the river, which
was crossed without opposition, one isolated Jap being
accounted for in the process by Pte Pratt. B Company
had forded the stream about 500 yards inland and one
platoon went on to investigate some native huts shown
on the map as being 200 yards beyond the river near a
garden. As there was no evidence of Jap occupation here
the company moved up and dug in for the night.
Battalion H.Q.’s first move of the day brought them
to the creek where the dump was found and the tanks
were parked in the kunai nearby.


After instructions had been given for C Company to
cross the river, the forward platoon forded it near the
mouth. The water was found to be thigh-deep and the
stream 50 feet wide. The loose stones on the bed of the
stream made the crossing difficult for those burdened with
the heavier weapons, and the current was fast, the water
bearing discolouration from lime brought down from the
upper reaches.
It was about 4 p.m. when the crossing was made and
the first to set foot on the northern bank was Sgt Craw-
ford, of the Tank Attack Platoon, who was attached to
C Company. Soon afterwards the remainder of the com-
pany followed.
Cpl Gray’s section went forward into the strip of low
jungle fringing the narrow beach, and a stray Jap was
killed. Apart from this nothing of moment happened and
the company went ahead to establish itself in the timber.
Battalion H.Q. went forward to a site on the high
ground rising sharply south of the river. Through the
trees the white sandy strip of Masaweng beach could be
seen running north towards the cliff line. Beyond the
line of sand the track followed the coarse shingle and
disappeared into the timber where C Company formed
its perimeter.
A battered and bedraggled coconut plantation at the
H.Q. site gave evidence of the punishment meted out
by the artillery, but at this stage everyone was too busy
to take much interest in the surroundings.
Captured documents and books were brought in by
the companies and sent for closer inspection by Brigade.
The forward troops, despite their busy time, showed re-
markable zeal in the collection of every scrap of paper
likely to yield any information about the enemy.
D Company had been relieved that afternoon by A
Company of 22nd Battalion and moved up to a position
on the river just beyond H.Q. Their nearness to the


river enabled the troops to enjoy the luxury of a good
wash and clean up, the first for many days.
A Company moved forward late in the afternoon to
the south bank of the river near the crossing place used
by B Company and here they went ahead with the task of
digging in. Cpl Taubman saw someone moving on the
river bank but as he knew B Company was in that area
he held his fire. However, his suspicions were aroused
and after the matter had been reported to C Company
another Jap straggler was shot.
B Company, having established itself on the river,
L/Cpls Nathan and Murray were sent down for water.
While they were moving along the track through tall
kunai they heard what they imagined to be a party of
37/52nd Battalion, which was still covering the left flank
of the advance. They stepped aside to allow the party to
pass, but to their amazement suddenly came face to face
with four Japs. L/Cpl Murray fired a burst from his
Owen before the Japs had time to go to ground, and
they disappeared into the grass. Suspecting that other
enemy might be following in strength, L/Cpls Murray
and Nathan withdrew. Later investigation revealed that
one of the Japs had been killed and another wounded.
Ptes Jones and Dunn, scouting near the huts in the
hope of finding a nearer water point, saw a Jap who
must have taken cover on the company’s approach. Pte
Jones’s aim was unerring.
Between 4 a.m. and 5 a.m. the next morning (the 19th)
enemy aircraft were overhead and bombs were heard to
fall south of the Battalion area. It was learned later
that a raid had taken place near the Brigade H.Q. site,
causing some casualties.
No shelling or mortaring worried the Battalion that
night and very early next day the C.O. issued orders to
company commanders for the day’s attack. B and C Com-
panies were to carry the offensive forward towards Forti-
fication Point.


All that could be seen of this imposing landmark—the
Brigade objective—was a cliff running out of sight to
the north-west. It was heavily skirted by dense timber,
giving way about 300 feet up this vast feature to rocky
grasslands stretching westwards and ending in a partly-
timbered peak.
Operation Order No. 10 gave the Battalion the task of
securing Fortification Point and the high ground domina-
ting it while 37/52nd Battalion consolidated on the left
flank. Tanks, artillery and machine guns were to give
support in the attack. It was decided that B Company
should move along the edge of the timber beyond the
kunai and provide the left flank of our attacking force
while C Company moved north to the extreme edge of
the fringe of timber skirting the cliff.
The attack was to go forward at 8 a.m., with A Com-
pany relieving B and D relieving C. While A Company
was going forward to cross the river, their forward patrol
from 7 Platoon found and killed an armed Jap. Pte
Barnard “beat the Jap to the draw”, and the patrol
gave the all-clear to the remainder of the company. The
relief of B Company was duly effected.
B and C Companies’ advance was held up for some
time during a spell of enemy mortaring. Some bombs fell
close to 15 Platoon, C Company, but there were no
casualties as the cover in a dry creek bed was good.
The advance then continued. D Company had moved
over the river and took over from C Company. Here
they remained for the rest of the day.
Artillery and machine gun support was used on the
timber and C Company was instructed to await further
support if the enemy was encountered in strength.
Opposition was expected in the heavy timber, especially
as high rocky ground dominated the only possible line
of advance along the track.
There was further enemy mortaring at 10 a.m., and


an attempt was made to find the source of the harrying
fire.
During the morning Cpl Stogdale, of B Section, Field
Security Service, arrived to check over the captured
weapons.
A Company observed troops crossing the Masaweng
River, and a patrol under L/Cpl Kirk went out to
contact them. As expected they were from the 37752nd
Battalion. After the patrol had reassured itself as to
their identity it returned as mortar shells were falling
in the area.
B and C Companies had not made contact as soon as
expected and a platoon of B Company was sent in search
of C Company, while the remainder waited in cover of
the timber. 11 Platoon ascertained that C Company had
reached the point where the track disappeared into heavy
timber. B Company moved over towards the track, keep-
ing on high ground to enable them to protect the spear-
head troops moving lower down into the thickets. A
buried 75-mm. gun and much ammunition were dis-
covered on the way.
Early in the afternoon the forward elements of C
Company, pressing forward along the track, came under
fire from light machine guns and rifles. This first intima-
tion of the Japs’ presence came from high ground on
the left flank. Pte Gray was wounded. It seemed that
the enemy positions were strongly held; consequently
the forward companies were both withdrawn to enable
a support fire plan of artillery, mortar and machine
guns to be arranged before the advance continued.
While C Company was going forward in its initial
advance a request had been sent back for more cable,
which was to have been brought up by a party from D
Company. In view of the impending barrage the party was
recalled.
The artillery went into action at 2.20 p.m. for half
an hour, three troops each firing 350 shells into the


timber. The Mortar Platoon contributed 60 bombs,
firing from near Battalion H.Q. The 2/2nd Machine
Gun Platoon gave six minutes’ “rapid” with the Vickers,
making a total of 10,000 rounds towards destruction of
the Jap.
C Company prepared to advance, this time with the
support of the tanks which had now arrived, impatient
to make up for past delays. The only drawback was the
failure to establish wireless communication between
tanks and infantry as the walkie-talkie sets were not
working successfully.
B Company continued its advance on high ground to
the left and found going tough. They made no contact
but were able to assure the safety of C Company from a
flanking attack. C Company had gone beyond the point
where contact had originally been made, and now were
without the menace of fire from above.
Soon afterwards those of the enemy who had with-
stood the barrage from prepared positions further along
the track reopened hostilities when C Company had
reached a point where the track began to present serious
difficulties. To the left was a steep, upward slope, thickly
timbered, with coral terraces and an abundance of cover
which the Jap had used previously and where he was
still present in undetermined numbers. On the right
was a cliff from which there was a sheer drop to the sea.
The track C Company was following wound steeply
upwards, narrowing rapidly as it penetrated the timber.
The tanks opened up with Besas and howitzers when-
ever enemy posts could be located sufficiently to enable
fire to be concentrated on them. Unfortunately the diffi-
cult going and precipitous country lessened the tanks’
ability to manoeuvre, thus robbing their fire of some
of its effectiveness.
Shouting and screaming from the Japs often disclosed
that the shots were finding their mark, and short advances
were made after pockets of resistance were overcome.


The nature of the track made the task of getting ahead
increasingly difficult, while B Company on the high
ground was having trouble in negotiating the steep and
rocky ground, although as yet there had been no contact
with the enemy.
C Company continued to get ahead by taking advan-
tage of every “bound” made by the tanks, and mopping
up was attended to as the company went forward.
The leading tank then came under close-range fire
from a Jap 37-mm. tank attack gun concealed in the
timber just beyond the second creek. The gun registered
four direct hits on the tank, but failed to damage it
seriously. The tank personnel were not so fortunate,
however. The commander was wounded in the chest by
shrapnel and the reconnaissance officer had an ankle
shattered. In C Company Ptes Hewson and Lewin suff-
ered shrapnel wounds. The tank commander was able
to return on foot and stretcher-bearers were sent up for
the other casualties. Sgts Styles and Barrett, Cpl Romeril
and Ptes Goudy, Irwin and Lewis did a magnificent job
over extremely difficult country, enabling all the wounded
to receive prompt attention.
Soon after this episode the tanks were held up by a
natural obstacle in the form of a steep chasm which could
not be crossed. The advance was temporarily halted
while the next moves were being considered.
C Company, by now weary and depleted in numbers,
was still in a difficult situation, as there were many
hiding places from which the enemy could still give
trouble. Orders were received from the Brigade that the
ground gained must be held at all costs, and it was
decided to send A and D Companies forward to form
a strong perimeter. This would ensure that the enemy
could not infiltrate and jeopardize the day’s gains.
Shortly after 6 p.m A and D Companies set out to
relieve C Company, which then returned to the north
bank of the Masaweng, where D Company had remained


that day. D Company went to the most forward point
of the day’s advance and took up a perimeter while A
Company moved up to a position in the timber well
beyond the beach, taking with them the Machine Gun
Platoon to provide additional fire power in the event of
a counter-attack. B Company remained on the high
ground and while digging in heard occasional shots which
it was suspected were coming from enemy snipers,
probably in an effort to make the company reveal its
position by returning the fire. It made no such mistake
and the firing eventually died down.
While D Company was digging in, Cpl McNaughton
surprised a Jap who was carrying a Bren-type gun, but
he was given no chance to use it, as the corporal scored
a kill. Soon after dusk Pte Donohue wiped out another
luckless Jap who had made the mistake of wandering into
D Company’s perimeter, apparently lost and dazed by the
day’s proceedings.
A count of enemy dead set the day’s total at 18, not
including a few stragglers mopped up incidentally dur-
ing the day.
All companies had an undisturbed night, and although
it was not fully realized until investigations were made
next day, the Battalion had already virtually completed
its allotted task. The enemy had taken a terrific beating,
the swiftness of the attack having frustrated their attempts
at re-grouping or counterattacking. They had been
hurled back so rapidly that they had to leave behind the
heavy weapons that could have provided their only means
of retaliation. Their scattered and broken forces were
destined to wander for weeks to come, and those for-
tunate enough to be taken prisoner subsequently spoke
bitterly of the futility of their part in the Huon cam-
paign.
Next day, 20th December, was devoted principally
to patrolling to ensure that all enemy were cleared from
the limit of the Battalion area of responsibility which


extended just beyond Fortification Point. D Company
patrolled to the edge of the timber forward of their posi-
tions and later in the day extended their activities to the
open ground beyond. Once past the timber the coral
terraces stood out in bare kunai, while the space between
the track and the sea widened out into flat, heavily grassed
land which became swamplike in parts.
The tanks were moved forward from the park in which
they had been sheltered during the night, but it was found
that engineer assistance would be needed before the
chasm met the previous day could be made passable.
C Company patrolled the area round some old native
huts, finding a considerable quantity of abandoned
equipment, some of which had been burnt to prevent
its falling into our hands intact.
The first American barge arrived at Masaweng beach
at 11.30 a.m. and it was not long before it became just
another link in our lines of communication.
A company from 37/52nd Battalion made contact with
our B Company and took up a position about 200 yards
to the west. A Company was meantime patrolling through
the timber, but all patrols were able to report that the
enemy had fled.
During the afternoon a large fire in the kunai tem-
porarily destroyed communications by burning out the
sig. wires, and also gave C Company some uncomfortable
moments, finally driving them into an area where the
fire had not penetrated.
D Company had an interesting find, a crashed Zero on
low ground near the most easterly tip of Fortification
Point. The cockpit, tail and one wing had been destroyed
by fire, but the engine appeared to be reasonably in-
tact. A standing patrol was established at the wreckage
pending an inspection by a representative of the sth
American Air Force.
Mortars fell to the west of the Battalion area late in
the afternoon, but none close enough to cause alarm.


Further patrols went out next day but D Company
saw the only Jap for the day, a straggler seen from afar,
who managed to scramble out of range and elude his
pursuers.
The day was made notable by the visit of General Sir
Thomas Blarney, G.8.E., K.C.8., C.M.G., D. 5.0., E.D.,
and Maj.-Gen. Wootten, C. 8., C.8.E., D. 5.0., com-
manding Ninth Australian Division, who was accom-
panied by Brig. Edgar, D.S.O. They conferred with the
C.O’s of all three battalions at our Battalion H.Q. Greet-
ings were exchanged with the men and pleasure was
expressed at the excellent showing of our troops through-
out the campaign.
On 28th December patrols from A Company searched
out all the remaining pockets where enemy might have
taken refuge, but apart from documents and the dis-
covery of a small hospital camp site near the river, noth-
ing of importance came to light.
That morning Brigade Operation Order No. 11 made
the Battalion responsible for protecting 20th Brigade
lines of communication, and 2/15th Battalion took up
the chase which was to lead to Sio. The tasks set us had
now been fully accomplished and a great impetus given
to the northward drive.
As well as playing a vital part in expelling the Japs
from an important sector of the New Guinea coast, the
Battalion had achieved an intrinsic unity and esprit de
corps that could come only from a baptism of fire.
In keeping with the traditions of the Battalion, an
exemplary standard of leadership and control was main-
tained throughout. Although individual initiative is
often of paramount importance in jungle fighting, it
can never be used to effect unless morale and discipline
are high. Indiscriminate fire and panic were completely
unknown in the action.
The Battalion’s success was due in no small way to the
fact that from the beginning of Brig. Edgar’s command


of the Brigade, the Unit was able to appreciate and
assimilate the Brigade commander’s vigour and lessons he
had to teach from his actual experience of the Japanese.
This resulted in a mutual confidence that meant much
to success.
The Battalion was fortunate indeed in having as Com-
manding Officer Lt-Col. Cusworth. Experience in the
Middle East and an intensive study of New Guinea from
all angles gave him a command of the situation that he
never failed to exercise. All operations were planned to
cover every detail. In his orders nothing was overlooked
or left to chance, and company commanders went to
their tasks confident in their knowledge of what was
required of them. He maintained a calm assurance in the
face of seeming difficulties, giving orders and advice with
the quiet confidence of the leader whose faith is strong
in his knowledge of his subordinate commanders and men.
No unnecessary risks were taken or invited, but the
impetus of the attack was never allowed to slacken. For
his fine leadership Lt-Col. Cusworth was twice men-
tioned in despatches.
The Adjutant, Capt. Boyd,* worked ceaselessly to-
wards perfecting the administrative details so necessary
to the smooth functioning of a battalion at war.
The Quartermaster, Capt.' Mollison,f and the Trans-
port Officer, Lieut. Hartnell, juggled jeeps and boong
trains, D.l.D’s and “break-up points” in their onerous
task of keeping up the flow of ammunition and rations.
In concluding this part of our history, too great a
tribute could not be paid to the fighting men of the
Battalion, and the decorations given as immediate awards
bear lasting testimony to the examples of unflinching
devotion to duty and loyalty to the cause for which we
were fighting.

HATER VIII
MASAWENG RIVER PATROL
4th December 1943 - 2nd January 1944
With the Battle of Fortification Point finished, the
Battalion enjoyed a well-earned rest and expectations
of Christmas turkey and hampers. But not for long. D
Company H.Q. telephone conveyed an order to move
at 2 p.m. on Christmas Eve, the task for the time being
undisclosed. Meantime great efforts were made to eat
the remaining contents of Christmas parcels.
At g a.m. on Christmas Eve the nature of the task was
learned at Brigade H.Q. Briefly, it was to protect the
left flank of operations, a company from each of the
battalions in the Brigade to move to a number of tac-
tical points inland to patrol and control tracks.
D Company, Australian Infantry Battalion,
with two sections of B Company P. 1.8., under command
of Capt. R. B. Eames, were to move to Hompua to
establish a base and then patrol to Zagehimi. Little was
known of the nature of the country and the accuracy of
the provisional map was doubtful. At 2 p.m. D Company
left the company area on Fortification Point, moving to
the mouth of the Masaweng River and then along the
north bank to the 37752nd Australian Infantry Battalion
where the P. 1.8. was contacted. The force then crossed
to the south bank and moved westward, accompanied by
two guides from the 37752nd Battalion, who had pre-
viously patrolled some distance up the river. Among the
P. 1.8. the troops were pleased to find some of their native
friends of the Mongi River patrol. At 5.30 p.m. the force
went into perimeter about three miles from the mouth


of the river. Some abandoned positions and equipment
indicated that the Japs had moved through the area.
Christmas Day arrived without a single appearance
by Santa Claus. Breakfast was eaten from field operation
ration tins and the force moved on, re-crossing the river
and passing through an old Japanese dump. The 37752nd
Battalion guides returned and the P. 1.8. took over the
forward patrolling. Here the force left the beaten track
and continued its way along the north bank. The nature
of the country made it necessary to cross and re-cross the
river, which was now becoming a very swift stream. At
one crossing P. 1.8. scouts reported tracks, about three
days old, of three Japs accompanied by natives. Christ-
mas dinner was eaten from the little green tin and the
move continued along the south bank. A whispered warn-
ing came back along the column that the P. 1.8. had
sighted a humpy on the north bank. Three natives
swiftly crossed the stream and equally as swiftly disposed
of two unsuspecting Japs. Once again the river was crossed
and another Jap was seen travelling quickly upstream,
but he vanished into the timber.
At 3 p.m. the force halted and patrols were sent for-
ward to look for tracks and other possible signs of enemy.
No tracks were found but one patrol reported having
come across a large Jap camp site, recently occupied by at
least 100 troops. A fire was still burning on the site.
These discoveries appeared to indicate that there might
be an enemy force considerably stronger than ours in the
vicinity.
Perimeter was formed for the night. The native carrier
line had not yet arrived with supplies, so it was decided
to send guides back next morning and carry out vigorous
patrolling.
Next morning a platoon patrol accompanied by P. 1.8.
investigated the Jap camp site and established that it
had been vacated several days earlier. However, presence
of a large enemy force in the area called for caution and


vigorous patrolling. The company moved on to select
ground more suitable for defence, and awaited the
arrival of supplies. Everyone was looking forward to the
Christmas turkey which the C.O. had promised to send
forward, but when those fuzzy-wuzzies arrived it was
without the turkey. They had “gone through” on S/Sgt
Villani the previous day and dumped the turkeys in the
hills.
On 27 th December, because of the increasing difficulty
in crossing the Masaweng, the force took to the high
ground. Stiff climbing with Brens, ammunition and
packs made the going strenuous. Maintaining its westerly
direction the patrol covered some miles before perimeter
was made for the night at a small hunting village over-
looking the country yet to be covered. The maps were
proving increasingly unreliable and it was difficult to
place our exact position. Because of the formidable
appearance of the country and the complete absence of
tracks it was necessary to patrol and look for a way to
climb the next high feature. The next two days were
spent in this way, but it was found impracticable to carry
the heavy loads unless a track could be found. During
this patrolling another Jap was killed. A native armed
with a rifle was chased but he escaped. However, the
P. 1.8. brought in a native who, when questioned, said
he knew a way to Hompua. A patrol went with him to
investigate this route, which was found to be an old
native pad invisible to the white eye.
On 30th December the company continued its move
to Hompua, climbing down to the Masaweng and then
up the almost sheer face of a mountain. It was back-
breaking and exhausting work for troops already weary
from battle, but they showed great stamina. After eight
hours of toiling they reached the top of the mountain
which was shown on the map to be 2400 feet high but
which proved to be considerably higher. A large village
on top of the mountain was the objective. It was hoped


that it would be Hompua but hopes were dashed when
it was found to be deserted. The native guide then ex-
plained that it was Hompua No. 1 or Pondokia, the
original Hompua village.
Near the top, “Three Minute Paddy” Guilfoyle urged
his companions on with calls of “Come on, it’s only three
minutes to the village.” It took an hour or more - to
complete those last “three minutes”. The company
settled down at Pondokia for the night and a well-
earned rest. A small seepage hole near the village church
yielded enough water for the night’s “brew”, and rain
during the night replenished the partly empty water-
bottles.
Next morning 4th Brigade was notified of the location
and the company rested until supplies arrived at midday.
A patrol from 4th Australian Cavalry Squadron was con-
tacted and it was found that the Hompua village where
they were based was still a half-day march away over the
next feature. Zagehimi, the village to which we were to
patrol, was situated on a much higher feature than Pon-
dokia. It was reported that the track ran up a steep escarp-
ment and was at least two days’ march away. Native
reports indicated that 200 Japs were dug in at Zagehimi,
which was a Jap base of 40 huts and two large rice sheds.
This was a grim outlook, for now a few were lame and
sick, and fatigue was showing on all faces and in the
rapidly-reducing waistlines. Important messages then
began to come in on the 208 wireless set. A loud cheer
and a war dance by “Three Minute Paddy” who had a
piece of paper in one hand heralded the welcome order
to return to the Unit. There was great rejoicing and
without further ado the force was on its way back before
the order could be changed. It was raining and the descent
to the Masaweng was treacherous and slow. It took six
hours to reach the river and the tired force camped
there for the night.
On Ist January the return journey was continued in


easy stages and camp was made about five miles from
the mouth of the river. At noon on 2nd January after
a good meal, wash-up and rest, the remainder of the jour-
ney was begun and the company marched into the Unit
lines with heads up in spite of numerous infections,
injuries and weariness.
The general verdict after this operation was that
although they might write songs about “Fuzzy-Wuzzy
Angels” the land of the fuzzy-wuzzies certainly bore
little resemblance to heaven.


CHATER IX
PABU AND CHRISTMAS HILL
1st January-30th June 1944
The new year dawned auspiciously enough for members
of the Battalion, who spent much of their time swimming
and sunning on Masaweng beach, testing for themselves
the curative powers of salt water and sun on bodies weary
from war and scarred with the skin diseases peculiar to
New Guinea. The placid, luke-warm waters of the
Bismarck Sea brought back happy memories of other
seaside resorts from which their patronage had been
reluctantly withdrawn. Most of the men were thin and
weary, but morale was 100 per cent. In the sun optimists
even dreamed of some home leave. . . .
On Ist January Capt. J. A. Oliver arrived to become
O.C. of C Company, and a few days later hopes of leave
vanished abruptly when a warning order came for a
move to a new rest area. The tattered and much-travelled
belongings were “jeeped” over the former battlefield
to a newly-historic section of the Finschhafen area, the
Wareo track. On 3rd January the C. 0., company com-
manders and Intelligence officers made a reconnaissance
of the new home and on sth January the Battalion took
over from 2/32nd Battalion, whose H.Q. was replaced
by ours on Christmas Hill. In three days the move was
complete, with Battalion H.Q., H.Q. Company and D
Company on the hill, C Company on the lakes area and A
and B Companies on Pabu, made famous by Ninth
Division. All these sites were on the Bonga-Wareo track
and our “outpost” on Christmas Hill was two miles east
of Wareo. A few days later H.Q. Company moved down
to join C Company at the lakes and B Company eventu


ally came to this area as well since accommodation on
Pabu was very restricted.
When we arrived all areas were simply vague clearings
in moderately dense country, and as wet weather threat-
ened to set a big problem the men concentrated on mak-
ing a healthy, habitable and well-drained camp site. The
“civic” centre at B.H.Q. was made resplendent with
corduroy paths and very soon the familiar “doovers”
were replaced by tents and later where possible by Sisal-
kraft huts. Such is the adaptability of the human being
when trained as a soldier that some of the men were almost
reluctant to abandon their ramshackle homes, impro-
vised from ground-sheets and gas-capes, at best far from
proof against downpours. Although our initial water
supply from an inferior creek was equally inferior, there
was no shortage of impromptu supplies from the sky.
Mud cluttered up everything until the Unit axemen
provided wood for paths, and about the same time an
efficient water point came into operation.
A lot of persuasion and “face-lifting” were necessary
before the Wareo track began even remotely to resemble
a road, and the drivers (and especially their passengers!)
had all the thrills anyone could wish for in their at-
tempts to climb the steep Christmas Hill in sticky
weather. Eventually boongs arrived in large numbers to
toil on the construction of the broad highway, but they
were not conspicuously successful. The Battalion pro-
vided working parties on the same job until relief was
given by 4th Field Company and the Battalion could
return to its primary job of training for war. Weapons,
section drill and range practices occupied much of our
attention and a route march to the sea at Gusika broke
the monotony each week-end.
In January reinforcement officers began to arrive from
the mainland where they had been enjoying themselves
at Canungra. These included Lieuts Mclnnes, McGuin-
nes, Meacham, Brown and Power, but Lieut. Power was


transferred to Torres Strait Force a few days after his
arrival. Capt. Grant, M.C., from 2/43rd Battalion held
a temporary posting with the Battalion as O.C. A Com-
pany.
A combat team of five officers and 13 N.C.O’s was
attached to Bth Brigade which took over from 20th
Brigade in the push up the coast beyond Sio. Aware of
the invaluable assistance given by the Ninth Division
combat team in the recent action, the new party was
determined to do even better while passing on lessons
that had been learned from the best teacher, first-hand
experience.
On its arrival at Bth Brigade H.Q. the party was sent
immediately to 4th Battalion whose forward companies
were moving up to Sio that evening to take up the
advance from 2/17th Battalion. The arrival of our boys
at this Battalion created a furore; mess parades disin-
tegrated and all crowded round our little band lined up
outside Battalion H.Q. To inexperienced eyes the ration
tin billies, sandbags filled with rations, Jap picks and
shovels, stray bits of sig. wire, grenades and other novel-
ties which decorated the party appeared ludicrous. Before
long, however, the various uses of this quaint array of
articles were explained, with the result that a formerly
orthodox battalion presented a definite spectacle of
war-mindedness on its next parade.
To see good equipment, particularly pugarees, being
thrown away stirred unsuspected urges for salvage, with
the result that several bulky sandbags were seen moving
rapidly towards the 29/46th area. . . .
That night there was little sleep for anyone, from the
Brigadier down, and although there was some inevitable
“leg-pulling” the discussions resulted in the imparting
of a great deal of common-sense from experienced men
to those who were about to gain some experience for
themselves.
Next morning found Fortification Point on the port


bow, and as it dissolved into the distance some highly-
coloured accounts of 4th Brigade’s part in the “Battle of
Fortification Point” were heard on all barges.
At Sio the party settled down to work, the next two
days being devoted to practical instruction in patrols,
battle formations, perimeters and the arts of jungle war-
fare generally. Paradoxically the battle experiences of
members of the party gained them less admiration than
their conspicuous ability to build “doovers”. For the
remainder of their stay with the 4th many envious glances
were cast at members of our party sheltering from the
continuous rain in a natty “ground-sheet mansion”, with
the “brew” and “M. and V.” boiling merrily while the
rookies searched wildly for supports or struggled with
seemingly incombustible wood.
On the fourth day 4th Battalion took over and the
game was on in earnest. Shortly after midnight'the first
and only brush with the Japs took place, a small party
of them crashing through our forward perimeter. The
party had a chance to prove its real worth. Cool advice
was mingled with rapid action. Subsequently Lieut.
Mills, Sgt McLean and Pte Dean were personally com-
mended by the C.O. 4th Battalion for their part in the
incident. Pte Dean again distinguished himself the fol-
lowing day by “smelling out” some Japs off the track
and sending them speedily to join their ancestors.
But after these enlivening incidents it was “plain
slogging”, 12 to 16 hours a day along the coast with count-
less rivers to ford and large stretches of kunai to cross in
blinding heat. Along the track dead Japs lay in hundreds.
With grim satisfaction our party noted that many had
died from wounds apparently inflicted by the Battalion
in the recent action. Despite their weariness, for it was
hard to keep up with the better-conditioned and fresher
troops just up from Australia, the party was well to the
fore, prompted not so much by a possible action, for
that seemed remote, as by the “souvenir bug”. It was not


long before the pick of the pickings had been duly
“salted down” by our party.
One interesting “find” was a Jap officer’s pack con-
taining marked maps and what looked like a documen-
tary account of 4th Brigade’s action from the enemy
point of view. Although everything was in Japanese it
was easy to trace the course of the action and to see that
after our early engagements beyond the Kalueng River
we had had the Japs on the run. The maps were sent
to Military Intelligence with a request that a translation
be sent to Battalion.
After three weeks of monotonous plodding 4th Bat-
talion was relieved as the forward battalion and the party
went back to Bth Brigade H.Q. where Brig. Cameron
personally thanked Maj. Tilley, leader of the party, for
the valuable help that had been given. The party’s first
good meal for a fortnight was cut short by the necessity
for a forced march of a mile to catch a barge to Kelanoa,
where the party spent a glorious day swimming and en-
joying the luxury of a smoke, tobacco having become
scarce in the last week of the march. They then returned
overland to the Battalion, well-equipped for the favourite
occupation of “ear-bashing”.
The comparative mildness of the climate in the Wareo
area and particularly on Christmas Hill was a welcome
change from the stifling humidity of the coastal strip.
Back here the nights were cool, almost cold, and in the
daytime pleasant breezes and abundant shade helped to
counteract the normal tropical conditions.
As this part of Finschhafen became more and more
“civilized”, the troops had their first entertainments since
Milne Bay. An excellent picture show site was centrally
placed near the lakes, and Rex Dawe’s concert party
gave some really excellent shows. Mr Wilkinson, of the
Salvation Army, brought amplified playing of recordings,
and there were visits from Capt. Inglis Moore and other


members of the Education Service, who also provided
musical recitals.
Encouraged by the enthusiastic reception of all forms of
entertainment, a Battalion concert party was formed by
Sgt Trenkner, of H.Q. Company, who was chiefly respon-
sible for the construction of band instruments from
cake and biscuit tins, sig. wire and pandanus wood.
Ground-sheets were stretched over oil drums to make
drums, the only orthodox instrument being an ancient
harmonica. “Star performers” included Sig. Fennessy
(compere), Sig. Jones (drums), Bill Robins (uke), Bill
Manzie (clarinet), Harry Fedley (crooner), “Swede”
Kelson (baritone), Eric Morgan and Jack Utan (vocal-
ists) and Jack French (female impersonator).
On yth February there was'the welcome arrival of a
small Unit library. As usual in New Guinea large quan-
tities of papers and periodicals turned up from time to
time, and from then on we were seldom short of reading
matter.
■ On 15th February there was an unfortunate accident
when, while on exercises near Pabu, members of B Com-
pany walked into a booby-trap. Those involved were Sgt
Strahan, L/Cpl Hutchinson and Ptes Ruben, Bish, Lacey,
Hewat and Mitchell.
Until early in February the main operational activity
of the Battalion was a patrol from Scarlet Beach to the
Masaweng. This was undertaken every third day, but
without revealing any signs of the enemy. On sth Feb-
ruary it was suspended and our role became purely
defensive, although it was not expected that the Japs
would make any further attempt to infiltrate the Finsch-
hafen area. Their only activity was a series of spas-
modic bombing raids directed chiefly against shipping
and installations in and around Langemak Bay. Never-
theless the familiar discordant note of Jap bomber en-
gines kept us reminded that a long fight lay ahead.
Capt. Northcott and Lieut. Jarman completed a course


at N.G.F. Mobile Training Cadre and returned to the
Unit on 7th February. Next day senior officers from and
Australian Corps and an observer from the British Army
toured the battle area as far as the Masaweng. The party
was escorted by 4th Brigade officers who pointed out the
various scenes of activity and explained the nature of
the operations. The Battalion was represented by Capt.
Boyd and Lieut. Mclntyre. Lieut. McGuinnes left on
16th February for a photo school at Moresby and on
completing this course went to Southport to attend the
L.H.Q. School of Military Intelligence.
A telegram arrived on 21st February from the Worces-
tershire Regiment on the occasion of its 250th annivers-
ary. This is the British regiment with which the 29th
Battalion is affiliated. Shortly afterwards greetings were
also received from the Rand Light Infantry, the affiliated
unit in South Africa.
By a curious coincidence the same day (21st February)
was one well described by Lt-Col. Cusworth as the
proudest day in any Commanding Officer’s association
with a Battalion. News was received of the granting of
immediate awards for gallantry in the recent operations.
The C.O. personally congratulated those concerned:
Capt. Eames, O.C. D Company, who received the Military
Cross; Sgt Herring, B Company, Cpl McNee and L/Cpl
Hamilton, D Company, who were awarded the Military
Medal. D Company thus had the distinction of receiving
three awards for its share in the Battalion’s victories, and
morale was “sky high”.
CITATIONS
During the action in December 1943, Capt. Eames, com-
manding D Company, displayed outstanding qualities of
leadership in that by his coolness and tenacity he inspired
his company to a very high level of service against heavily
held positions in most difficult country.


VX108987 Sgt H. H. HERRING, M.M.
Displayed coolness and courage in the face of heavy
opposition when he took command of two platoons when
the Force Commander, Lieut. Routley, had been
wounded. By his initiative and courage the attack was
kept going, the enemy being forced out.
VXi08999 Cpl L. J. McNEE, M.M.
On Bth December 1943 showing great courage he ad-
vanced alone through heavy fire, grenaded an enemy
post, killing the crew and capturing the gun, thereby
allowing his platoon and company to advance.
VX144391 L/Cpl J. W. HAMILTON, M.M.
On Bth December 1943, D Company was held up by
enemy positions and a 75-mm. gun, firing at very short
range. With complete disregard for personal safety, L/Cpl
Hamilton stood up with his Bren gun and sprayed the
crew of the Jap 75-mm. gun, killing some of the crew
and causing the enemy to abandon the gun which was
captured.
His courage was instrumental in the capture of strongly
held positions.
Capt. Miller, the R.M.0., left that afternoon to take
up duties with 4th Field Ambulance, and his successor,
Capt. Woodburn, was inducted into the mess that even-
ing. Lieut. Webster joined the Unit on 23rd February
and was posted to C Company. Maj. Lovejoy, 2 i/c, left
on 26th February to return to his civilian occupation.
Lt-Gen. S. G. Savige, C. 8., C.8.E., D. 5.0., M.C., E.D.,
G.O.C. 2nd Australian Corps, visited Lt-Col. Cusworth
on 21st February but contrary to expectations he was
not the bringer of good tidings. In fact, the most optimis-
tic hopes for leave were dashed. At the end of the month
the Tank Attack Platoon was attached for beach defence
duties under command of 22nd Battalion, which had


moved to Scarlet Beach from Wareo, exchanging posi-
tions with 37/52nd Battalion.
By the beginning of March the good effects of a
favourable climate and better living conditions began
to show in a marked change in health and morale, and all
sections of the Battalion settled down to a vigorous
training programme.
Maj.-Gen. A. H. Ramsay, C. 8., C.8.E., D. 5.0., E.D.,
G.O.C. Fifth Australian Division paid a visit on 21st
March, but there was still no news of the Battalion’s
new role.
After a long secondment to 4th Brigade as 1.0., Capt.
Kent returned to the Unit and was posted 2 i/c D Com-
pany. A new batch of officers appeared on 28th March:
Lieut. Nurse, who went to B Company, and Lieuts
Kempster and Bargwanna, who were posted to the Mortar
and M.G. Platoons respectively. Lieut. McSweeney also
arrived that evening and was posted to A Company.
Early in April an interesting phase of infantry train-
ing was undertaken—tank co-operation, which had been
a feature of the recent operation. After numerous exer-
cises and lectures a demonstration was staged by D
Company in conjunction with Ist Australian Tank Bat-
talion, followed by an explanation by Lt-Col. Cusworth
and Maj. Hordern, of the tanks, who pointed out the
technical principles of infantry-tank co-operation. There
was a big and interested audience consisting of officers
from all units under command of Fifth Division.
On 15th April Battalion H.Q. was moved to a more
central position with the companies assembled in the
lakes area. The same day a warning order was received
placing the Battalion on 72 hours’ notice for an opera-
tional move. This gave rise to much speculation and
there were many rumours when 7 Platoon A Company
left under Lieut. McSweeney for Sio to relieve a platoon
of Bth Brigade which had been defending the radar
station.


On 24th April notice was reduced to 24 hours and
Lt-Gen. Savige and Brig. Edgar called to discuss the
position with Lt-Col. Cusworth. Although there were
shrewd suspicions about our destination and role nobody
knew definitely. Lieut. Jarman and a small advance
party left for Saidor, which was to be the first stage of
our journey.
Early on the afternoon of 25th April movement began
to Fifth Division Reception Camp at Finschhafen, leav-
ing a rear party of 25 men to stay in the area with Lieut.
Hartnell, Transport Officer, who took charge of our
jeeps and heavy stores. For the first time in its history the
Battalion was to be airborne, and only personal gear and
small portable essentials could be carried. Owing to a
hold-up in transport the movement to the reception camp
was completed in rain and darkness. The camp was in
a coconut plantation, partly under water, and the only
shelters were two-man tents hastily erected before we
crawled in to snatch a few hours’ sleep before the big
move.
After several alterations in the departure time the
move was fixed for not earlier than 7 a.m. next day,
at which hour the first trucks were loaded to take us to
the airfield at Langemak Bay. Here we settled down as
comfortably as possible in large shelter sheds near the
field and before long the first plane loads had moved
up to the emplaning point. Lt-Col. Cusworth and his
party climbed into a plane but after waiting patiently
for an hour were informed that all air traffic had been
suspended because of heavy weather up the coast.
Capt. Boyd meantime had remained at the reception
camp with the balance of the troops whose move to the
airport had been postponed. The plane loads waiting at
the airfield had to bivouac for the night at the shelter
sheds. Accommodation was cramped, and comfort was
not increased by heavy rain. Troops however were not


deterred and that night were dispersed widely among the
various Allied picture shows in the area.
Early next morning the troops who had spent the
night at the airfield began to emplane for Saidor. By noon
on 26th April they had moved into an area at Wilwillan
beach, where the Americans had made a surprise landing
at the end of December 1943. It was discovered that
Lieut. Jarman and the advance party had already left
for Singor and that we were to follow as soon as possible.
This was heartening news, as the camp site looked far
from promising, and it was difficult to find enough dry
spots on the swampy jungle flat as sites for the two-man
tents. The afternoon passed without any sign of the
troops who had been left behind, and at this stage the
Unit was distributed over no less than six points—the
Wareo track, the reception camp at Finschhafen, Lange-
mak Bay, Sio and Singor.
As promised the stay at Saidor was fortunately brief
and at noon on the 27 th the arrivals of the previous day
left for Singor. This party of 199 comprised the bulk of
Battalion H.Q., H.Q. Company and B Company. Those
left behind at the airfield arrived at Singor a few days
later, but there was still no word of Capt. Boyd’s party
at the reception camp.
Lieut. Jarman selected a beautiful site at Singor on
the banks of the Yangdar River, a clear, fast-flowing
stream which justified the name “river”. Despite heavy
rain the stay there was an enjoyable interlude with
swimming, surfing and sunbathing “turned on”.
Clashes had occurred in the vicinity between the
Americans from Saidor and Jap rearguards. Several of
the sites of these encounters were marked by a cryptic
notice that they held “one good Jap”. The natives in the
area had considerable quantities of worthless Japanese
invasion money with which they had been paid for their
services, but were able to exchange some of it for real
money because of its souvenir value.
H


After some uncertainty on both sides about the missing
portion of the Battalion, Capt. Boyd and his party
boarded the destroyer Vendetta on 29th April and arrived
at Madang the following day, just five days after Bth
Brigade had entered this former Japanese strongpoint.
This party consisted of D Company, part of A Company,
and a few B.H.Q. personnel.
The beautiful site of the former German capital
reeked of Japanese filth, and all but a few of the build-
ings were now mere shells. Our bombings had caused
terrific damage and the Japs who had been in the area
must have had a torrid time. The name Burns Philp
was still intact on the store, a conspicuous landmark.
Numerous dumps of medical stores and clothing were
found in the township area and souvenir hunters had a
field day. The flats near the harbour were covered with
enormous coconut plantations which extended back to
the foothills. Numerous islands were scattered in the bay
and everyone was struck with the beauty of the scene.
Flowering shrubs grew prolifically among the ruins of
the town which still presented evidence of the former
prosperity of its few Europeans.
On 2nd May Lt-Col. Cusworth and an “advance party”
of 11 left Singor after waiting on the beach for 24 hours
for barge transport. Those left at Singor stood by and
signalled frantically to passing barges on the way to
Madang. On 4th May their energetic efforts were re-
warded and that afternoon found them in Madang look-
ing for forward elements of the Battalion.
Meantime the main body had left Madang for
Friederich Karl Harbour where they had arrived early on
the morning of 3rd May. The previous day Capt. Boyd
and members of the I Section had made a reconnaissance
on foot of the new area which was to be the Unit’s site in
the Gamoi plantation, not far from Nagada. After tramp-
ing many weary miles they found a prospective Battalion
H.Q. site near the junction of the Nagada River and a


small creek, close to the main road between Madang
and Alexishafen. The road was poorly surfaced and the
bridge across the river had been destroyed. Battalion
H.Q. was established and it was decided to make the most
of an unpromising situation. Although we had selected
the best available spot in the area in view of water supply
there were certain disadvantages which could be over-
come only with a great deal of hard work. We were in
the middle of a large, neglected coconut plantation,
overgrown with rank vines and grasses to a depth of
several feet. This cover crop harboured many kinds of
reptiles, including death adders and other sizable snakes.
Mosquitoes and flies were there in abundance and we soon
found that the coconuts rotting on the ground were a
favourite breeding ground for these pests. To add to our
joys we had arrived in the wettest of wet seasons, the
doldrums. Madang is distinguished by having the highest
rainfall in New Guinea and the humidity is terrific away
from the pleasant sea breezes.
After putting up the two-man tents the next job was
the clearance of all unwanted vegetation and destruction
of its many inhabitants. While this work went on apace
the C. 0., 1.0., the A/Sig. Officer Lieut. Wilcox and
representatives of the Rifle Companies went on a recon-
naissance of the area where our forward companies were
to be placed. The Brigade’s responsibility was the close
defence of Madang and our Battalion was allotted the
Nobinob sector, with 22 nd Battalion to the south and
37/52nd to the north in similar roles. It was suspected
at this stage that the Japanese might launch a counter-
attack on Madang from the hills and there was always the
threat of raiding parties.
Three company positions were selected in the Nob-
inob Mission area and A, B and C Companies were to
take up perimeters as outer defences while D Company
and H.Q. Company remained in reserve with Battalion
H.Q.


This former German Lutheran Mission was on a
feature about 1800 feet high which rose beyond the
plantation. An old mule track led up the hill but with
our limited facilities there was no prospect of making it
jeepable without the help of engineers. The mission
itself was in ruins but a former guest house which was
still standing contained, to our surprise, an ancient
refrigerator. Several native villages, mostly deserted,
were grouped round Nobinob and the mission area
itself was a flowering wilderness. An unexploded bomb
just off the track and several large craters testified that
our Air Force had not neglected any Japanese outpost
that might have existed here.
Native labour was provided to carry rations to the
companies who were now installed on the hill, and we
saw once again the familiar boong train struggling
under heavy loads. These natives were imported from
Lae and later on we had an allotment of Ramu Valley
boys. The local natives were mostly undersized and scaly,
but quite a few had been taught to read and write in the
missions.
The active side of our defence job was to patrol the
back country beyond Nobinob to the villages of Sula-
bob, Mogurel, Haidurem and Kamba. Many miles were
covered by these patrols but the only enemy activity
during our stay was the appearance in the Brigade area
of a few stragglers who were disposed of before they
could do any damage. They knew better than to
approach our perimeters and so we were spared any
excitement.
Much interest was taken in the large deserted Jap
camps, which had obviously housed the base units
round Madang. They were all cunningly hidden in
thickly-timbered gullies and apparently had suffered
little from our bombings'. Evidence of the presence of
geisha girls was noticed and a few interesting souvenirs


were collected including crockery pillaged by the Japs
from Madang.
On 19th May, 7 Platoon of A Company was able to
rejoin the Unit following its relief at Sio and came
under command of D Company on the flat. The com-
panies on the hill had meantime prepared defences and
established strongpoints and O.P’s at strategic intervals
to prevent any possible penetration by the Japanese. A
particularly good O.P. was a big tree about half a mile
from the mission, which was visible for 40 miles off
shore and which had been used by the Japs to spy on
our activity over Madang and Alexishafen. But the
watchers at the O.P. were now chiefly concerned with
the arrival of our home-leave ships.
On 6th May Lieuts Trims and Marsden joined the
Unit and were posted to A and B Companies respec-
tively. On 10th May Lieut. Thompson returned from
a signal school at Moresby and Lieut. McGuinnes re-
joined the Unit from the Southport school.
A great transformation had taken place in the Bat-
talion area. Early in June the two-man tents were re-
placed by the normal Army-pattern tents, enabling the
troops to live in some comfort in wet weather. Paths,
drains and clearings helped to make the area more
habitable and the construction of an administrative
block, mess huts and a large “Q” store enabled more
expeditious carrying on of the Battalion’s routine work.
Large maps, prepared as usual outside the “I” office, and
a news service helped us to follow the progress of the
war.
Working parties were provided to unload barges and
improve and make roads. The main Madang road had
become impassable for heavy traffic in wet weather and
even a short jeep ride was a major adventure on our
local “highways”. The Engineers were toiling to build
bridges and make the road usable, but Battalion
did a lot of hard work about this time.


Training cadres were instituted in June and a course
in air photo interpretation was given to all officers and
senior N.C.O’s by Lieuts Mclntyre and McGuinnes and
members of the I Section. On 20th June Lieuts Mc-
Carten, Morgan, Shaw and Newton arrived in the Unit
and Capt. Terry rejoined on 26th June after his second-
ment to Brigade, and was posted O.C. A Company. On
the same date Capt. Parker took over M.L.O. duties at
Nagada.
The departure of a large leave draft on 28th June,
including the R.M.O. Capt Woodburn, made it neces-
sary to appoint a new medical officer and Capt. Davies
of 4th Field Ambulance joined us in this capacity on the
same day. The leave draft also included Capt. Eames,
O.C. D Company, Capt. Boyd, Adjutant, and Lieut.
Hartnell, Transport Officer
The close of this period saw us hard at work training
and on the working parties which still found plenty to
keep them busy. All were confident that home leave was
in the offing and with this in mind settled down to await
arrival of the good news.


CHAPTER X
MADANG
1st July- 19th August 1944
At the opening of the second half of 1944 we were still
waiting patiently in Gamoi plantation for the long-
expected leave. The Japs evidently were in no position
to challenge our possession of Madang. As extensive
patrolling in the hills to the west had revealed no threat
to our safety, patrolling in the Nobinob area was
reduced to one local patrol to link up with B Company
of 37/52nd Battalion. Arrangements were also made for
gradual withdrawal of company personnel manning
defensive positions on the outer perimeter.
On 3rd July Lieut. Lidgerwood joined the Unit and
was posted to B Company. The following day 41 rein-
forcements arrived, also five of the Unit jeeps from
Finschhafen. On 6th July Maj. Tilley returned to take
command of H.Q. Company and Capt. Northcott
became 2 i/c B Company. On the same day Capt. Par-
ker left the Unit and Lieut. Buse was detached as
Movement Control Officer, Nagada. Lieuts Mac Queen
and Mills rejoined us on gth July but Lieut. Mills left
again the same day to take up duties at an infantry train-
ing battalion.
It was becoming more and more difficult to settle
down to the dull routine of training and working parties
without adequate diversion, especially as notice of our
return to the mainland for leave was expected almost
hourly. Lt-Col. Cusworth, the C. 0., took matters firmly
in hand and within a few days energetic squads were
toiling on the construction of a super sports oval. As we


were not fully mechanized the work was finished only
after much toil and setbacks due to heavy rain. Tropical
downpours occurred frequently, one of them drenching
players in muddy water at the first game on the new oval.
Brigade gave permission to begin a new training
syllabus, including 40 per cent sports, and this gave a
fresh impetus to our efforts. As if to help us get a start
the weather took a turn for the better and soon almost
drought conditions prevailed. The oval became a firm-
surfaced playing field 150 yards long by 60 yards wide,
designed as an Australian Rules field, with two pitches
for the cricket season. A large name board with the Bat-
talion colours proclaimed it “Deslandes Oval”, the name
being chosen by Lt-Col. Cusworth in honour of Cpl Roy
Deslandes, who was killed in action on 6th December
1943, after a gallant attack on a Japanese strongpoint
towards which he kept advancing despite grievous
wounds. The fine oval, hewed from what had been
virtually swamp land, was a constant reminder of his
gallantry and self-sacrifice.
After a few experimental games an inter-company
competition was inaugurated and negotiations were
opened for matches with other units. With such an oval
the 2g/46th Battalion became the focal point for foot-
ball activities, and our enthusiastic footballers took full
advantage of it as a practice field.
A team from 2/14th Field Regiment which had
recently defeated strong teams on the Tablelands found
that the 2g/46th Battalion could keep up the pace a
little longer than its opponents, and match them in
scientific handling of the ball. Despite a strong opening,
the gunners weakened before the pace and co-ordination
of the 29/46^.
Pte “Slab” Rule, of C Company, was outstanding. He
had able support from former Victorian League players,
including Sgt Alan McDonald, Sgt Arthur Hart,* Joey
* Later mentioned in despatches.


Jones, Paddy Dean and Harry Heard. The last quarter
found us easy winners. This early success on 16th July
gave the team’s morale a good boost.
The next outside match, played on 20th July, was
against 4th Field Ambulance, whose “star” was Cpl
Wally Lock, former Melbourne full-back. Again we had
a good win, and then sent out overtures for a match
against an infantry team likely to test our mettle more
fully. One was staged on 30th July against 37752nd
Battalion, which played well but lacked practice. Alan
McDonald was in top form, his 11 goals helping us to
a runaway victory.
The next big match was against 152nd Australian
General Transport Company, and once more Sgt Mc-
Donald was to the fore. After another easy win we felt
with justifiable pride that we would be “hard to toss”.
“Slab” Rule was a spectator at the last two matches,
having been injured in the Ambulance match, but
played on gamely until the finish.
The R.A.P. was a busy place in those days, with a
multitude of minor injuries to be treated, but none was
really serious. Interest mounted as players rapidly ran
themselves into top form. Those who did not “make”
the team crowded the sidelines and dissipated their
energies in violent “barracking”.
Meantime, keen competition had developed between
rival teams within the Battalion. Of the seven teams en-
gaged, one was from each Rifle Company, one from
Battalion H.Q. and two from H.Q. Company. All had
keen supporters and there were rumours of certain
modest wagers.
The spirit of rivalry provided some keen contests.
Most exciting finish of all was a drawn match between
B Company and H.Q. (2). The semi-final between A
and B Companies also provided a sensational finish, Ben
Nathan kicking two goals in the last two minutes to
snatch a win for B Company. By the time B Company


and H.Q. (2) met in the final both sides had been
weakened by casualties. Although B Company fought
valiantly H.Q. (2) was the better team on the day. Alan
McDonald and Arthur Hart were their outstanding
players.
By way of variety a game of Rugby League was
arranged between two scratch teams selected from those
who had previously played the game. The game was
handicapped by the fact that the oval had not been
designed for it and only a few of the players showed
glimpses of Rugby form. It was agreed generally that the
experiment was not a success, and it was resolved to con-
centrate on Australian Rules.
A volley ball competition, run concurrently with the
football, resulted in a close finish in which Battalion
H.Q. defeated A Company in the final. A cricket com-
petition on a “knock out” basis was won by C Company.
It was definitely a “bowlers’ pitch”, but the perfor-
mance of “Swede” Kelson, who took 14 wickets for 5
runs, playing for H.Q. (1) against Battalion H.Q. was
nevertheless noteworthy. Ron Biilman gave some spark-
ling hard-hitting displays with the bat
On sth August a Unit field sports day resulted in a
win for Battalion H.Q., Pte Laurie Cooper and Pte
“Mo” Luxmore contributing largely to their success.
“Musical Jeeps” provided a novel and entertaining item
on the programme. Another popular activity was swim-
ming, and after trying out Battalion representatives at
Nagada beach, a Brigade carnival was held at Siar.
This big programme of varied sports helped consider-
ably to lift both the morale and physical stamina of the
Unit, promising that everyone would be thoroughly fit
when leave, now looming on the horizon, finally came.
The responsibility for the defence of Madang was
taken over by 7th Brigade on 6th August. The Unit was
now all congregated in Gamoi plantation. After a new


issue of clothing all stores were boxed and moved to a
Brigade dump.
On 3rd August a Battalion parade was held and Brig.
Edgar inspected. A limited amount of road work and
training continued, but main interest lay in preparations
for leaving the island.
On 15th August a combined parade of 2g/46th and
37/52nd Battalions was inspected by Maj.-Gen. Ram-
say, Divisional Commander, who congratulated them on
their excellent turn-out and on the fine job done in New
Guinea. Lt-Gen. Savige, G.O.C. New Guinea Force,
also honoured the Battalion with an informal visit.
Next day boat numbers were isued to all ranks and
on 18th August an advance party boarded the Katoomba
to prepare for the accommodation of the Battalion,
which was to travel with 37752nd Battalion and Brigade
H.Q. The following morning there were many beaming
faces as the exodus began towards the barge point at
Nagada.
So ended the long, and at times, weary sojourn in
New Guinea— 19 months that saw much history in the
making both at home and abroad. Despite the hard
times they sometimes endured, spirits ran high and all
were exultant that the long-made plans for leave were
soon to be fulfilled.


CHAPTER XI
LEAVE AND MARCH OF HONOUR
August-October 1944
At last the hopes of all were realized and on 19th Aug-
ust at 8 a.m. the Battalion began to move by barge from
Friederich Karl Harbour to Madang, where we boarded
s.s. Katoomba. On the wharf at Madang the advance
party, which had boarded the ship the night before,
guided the troops on board. We were accompanied by
4th Brigade H.Q. and 37752nd Battalion.
The Katoomba pulled away from the wharf at noon
on the 19th and we began our homeward journey,
a rather pleasant and uneventful one. Our only stop was
at Milne Bay, the sight of which brought back many
memories.
All were astir early on the morning of 26th August
for our entry into Moreton Bay and progress up the
Brisbane River. Feelings ran high at the sight of
familiar Australian soil and reached a high peak when
we were tying up at Hamilton wharf, where Queens-
land L. of C. band gave the ship a musical welcome.
After some little delay, as we had arrived ahead of
schedule, we disembarked and entered waiting trucks
which took us to Kalinga staging camp. Here we were
re-clothed and arrangements were made to send the
troops to their various home states. The final Victorian
party left Brisbane at 4 p.m. on 29th August.
The only big worry at this time was: “How long will
we get?” There was much rejoicing when we found at
last that we were to get all the leave in our paybooks.
At Kalinga we met the previous leave party under


Capt. R. B. Eames and Capt. K. A. Boyd, which returned
to complete the leave to which it was entitled.
Not everything that happened during the leave period
could, of course, be recorded here, but it is of interest
that Unit comradeship was kept alive in the precincts
of the Royal Mail Hotel, Melbourne, where it was a
pretty safe bet that any day at any time a member of
2g/46th Battalion could be found. It was also said that on
occasions the Carlton Hotel was “run by the ‘push’ on
the corner”. Notables among the gatherings were woun-
ded officers and men since discharged, renewing old
friendships. Lieut. Brearley, “Bluey” Lemin, Len Duck-
worth, Barney Goss and Norm White were some of the
men. Visits were also paid to the homes of men who had
given their lives.
Those whose leave finished early were held at Wat-
sonia for the March of Honour for 4th and 15th Bri-
gades. 15th Brigade had completed its leave and so was
at full strength. The only members of 4th Brigade who
marched were those who had completed leave. Men were
not recalled as it would have meant loss of leave days,
but an opportunity was given to 29/46th personnel still
on leave to take part. However it was an arduous march
for which some training was needed, so only a few of the
men availed themselves of the opportunity.
The men who took part in the march worthily upheld
the standard and traditions of 4th Brigade. It was a day
of great pride both for those marching and those who
looked on.
A cheering post was established on the day of the
march, 13th October 1944. Mrs Cusworth, wife of the
C. 0., made the meeting point by displaying the Unit
flag and many of the men not marching gathered there.
Officials at the Town Hall, noticing this enthusiastic
assembly, allotted the men a clear space in the official
enclosure where they were visited by the then Army


Minister, Mr Forde and Lt-Gen. Savige, C. 8., D. 5.0.,
M.C., E.D.
Melbourne’s public reception to the troops was be-
yond our expectations and helped to dispel the feeling
that these units’ excellent work was not fully recognized
and acknowledged. It was a day that will long be remem-
bered.
Typical of newspaper accounts of the achievements
of both 4th and 15 th Brigades was this extract from the
Age of 9th October:
MEN OF THE NEW GUINEA CAMPAIGN
Men who took part in the famous Salamaua-Lae-Finschhafen
actions in New Guinea will march through Melbourne on
Friday next. They are members of the 4th and 15th Brigades,
and it will be their first march through a capital city. Both
brigades are composed of men enlisted in Victoria.
The 4th Brigade made a notable contribution to the Lae
Finschhafen campaigns. Twenty decorations were awarded to
officers and men of the Brigade for gallantry and devotion to
duty during these campaigns.
In the Lae operation the Battalion carried out
hazardous patrolling into the mountainous hinterland of the
Huon Peninsula.
During the Finschhafen campaign fierce fighting was en-
countered in the drive north along the coast from Gusika
before the Battalion captured its objective, Fortification Point.
The Lord Mayor of Melbourne, Aid. T. S. Nettle-
fold, in an interview with the Press, said:
“In connection with the march through the city on
Friday 13th of the 4th and 15th Brigades, I would
appreciate a display of enthusiasm by the public as this
is a march to honour two brigades of Australian infan-
trymen who fought with distinction in New Guinea and
pushed the Japanese back from our shores. I would like
to emphasize that the men who will be marching on
Friday are those who fought most successfully both the
Japanese and the jungle. They have earned the right to,


and expect, a triumphant reception, and this will pro-
vide Melbourne people with a grand opportunity to pay
these men a well-deserved tribute.”
Army Minister Forde commented: “These men have
done all that has been asked of them. They have been
asked to do more than we could rightly expect.”
Here is an excerpt from the Herald 13th October: -
JUNGLE CONQUERORS OF JAPS CHEERED
TUMULTUOUSLY IN CITY MARCH OF HONOUR
Marching under a snowstorm of streamers, torn-up paper
and confetti, men of the 4th and 15th Australian Infantry
Brigades, conquerors of the Japanese in many a jungle battle,
were cheered tumultuously in their march of honour through
city streets this afternoon in support of the Second Victory
Loan.
The many thousands lining the barricades gave them a real
victor’s ovation.
Unlike other parades, the cheering began before the march
started. This was today’s tribute to the cot cases and other
convalescents from Heidelberg Military Hospital, who formed
a strongpost to the north of the Town Hall for the first time
in the history of these parades.
Strongposts along the route, groups of cheering girls waving
from windows on high, mothers and wives who had waited
for hours behind the barriers, and little children whose
fluttering flags lent gay colour to the panorama, joined in the
city’s welcome.
It was a scene at once joyous, poignant and inspiring. It
was a parade of one prevailing and subdued tone of khaki as
distinct from the most picturesque and colourful displays of
the past, but what it lacked in colour it had gained in
romance.
The true colour of that parade was not visible to the eye,
nor was it to be judged by the grey steel of bayonets under a
leaden sky, the sage green patterned webbing and the rich
russet of leather; rather was it in the knowledge of their
accomplishments.
Of the quality of their marching there could be but one
opinion-it was superb. This was all the more so, considering
that these were not troops fresh in training from the parade


ground, but men from battle stations, their leave just com-
pleted, and unaccustomed to precision marching since they
left their training camps for New Guinea; yet the ripple of
swinging arms and the pulsation of the ranks over Princes
Bridge was as rhythmically perfect as any ever seen.
Brig. C. R. V. Edgar, D. 5.0., was march commander, as
leader of 600 men of 4th Brigade which, only a brief 18 months
ago, embarked for New Guinea to operate with the Ninth
Division at Lae, Finschhafen and up the Huon Peninsula.
More recently elements of this Brigade had occupied the
Karkar Islands.
Of the infantry battalions of this Brigade, 22nd Battalion
had forced the Japanese to retreat in vicious fighting during
the Finschhafen attack. From that day of victory, in which
most of the Battalion saw action for the first time, they have
never looked back.
Of the other two battalions, 37/52nd won renown in the
coastal drive to Sio and the Karkar Island landing, while the
29/46th Battalion battled fiercely up the coast and captured
Fortification Point.
For their gallant part in the Huon Peninsula campaign this
Brigade won two Military Crosses, one D.C.M., five Military
Medals and 12 m.i.d’s.
Lt-Col. K. S. Cusworth led the first group behind the
R.A.N. band with two companies of the 29/46th, of which
he is the Commanding Officer. Renewed cheering greeted the
Signallers, Engineers, Supply Platoons and workshop per-
sonnel, for they, too, were vital links in the Brigade operations.
In the second group were the Gippslanders, 22nd Battalion,
led by Lt-Col. J. D. Carstairs. Originally raised in South
Gippsland, the Battalion is now virtually drawn from all over
Victoria. Lt-Col. J. G. Rowan, M.C., led the 37/52nd Battalion,
originally enlisted in East Gippsland.
Lt-Gen. Stan Savige, who as Division Commander had 15th
Brigade under his command at Salamaua, took the salute at
the Town Hall base.
. . . And so ended a glorious day, with every man
showing pride in his unit and its achievements.


CHAPTER XII
QUEENSLAND INTERLUDE
Amid wild speculation as to the ultimate destination,
the great exodus from Victoria began on 17th October
1944. For many leave was over, and for the remainder
it was almost over. Personnel from the northern States
had already begun to congregate at the immediate des-
tination of the Unit, Strathpine, a camp 14 miles from
Brisbane, which had been occupied until recently by
the Seventh Division. As the troops arrived at Brisbane
Leave and Transit Depot they were moved to Strathpine
by motor transport.
Battalion H.Q. was first established by Capt. Boyd,
the Adjutant, in Sheridan Road; on 20th October a new
area was allotted and company areas defined. Lt-Col.
Cusworth, the C. 0., arrived on 23rd October, with
many Victorian personnel, and soon the whole Unit was
assembled at Strathpine, except for those still in hospital
and a very small number of “A.W.L’s”.
Despite the spacious log cabins and well-built kit-
chens, first impressions of the camp were not com-
pletely favourable. The nuisance from the dusty roads,
after a long dry spell, was only partly counteracted by
speed traps placed at frequent intervals to slow down
vehicles when travelling through tented areas.
New Guinea “technique” was apparent in the ingen-
ious construction of beds, for the making of which there
was an almost complete absence of materials. “Dust
resistant models” of weird design were conspicuous
among the finished products.
The new training area, with its scattered trees and
open spaces, was a violent contrast to the lush vegetation
1


among which the Unit had done most of its fighting, but
the formalities of mainland training left little time for
meditation about contrasting topography.
The troops settled down to route marches of increas-
ing lengths, rifles were issued, and when the Medical
Officer, Capt. Spring, worked overtime on injections
against cholera, which had been given for the first time,
there was a renewal of speculation about the subsequent
destination of the Unit.
Leave to Brisbane was fairly liberal at first, but was
gradually reduced because of limited transport. A picnic
arranged by Mrs Pickering, hostess at the Lady Bowen
Club, at Petrie picnic ground, was enjoyed by members
of the Unit on sth November.
Between 7th November and 4th December the Tank
Attack Platoon was detached to 22nd Battalion for com-
bined training. Four new guns were allotted to the
platoon, which recorded some good scores at Enogera
range despite unfavourable conditions.
Four new officers joined the Unit on 10th November:
Maj. Prince, who was posted O.C. of B Company, and
Capts Phillips, Hughes and Hipsley, who became second
in command of A, B and C Companies respectively.
To the Unit this year’s celebration of Armistice Day
had a new significance. It was a time when the troops
recalled the sacrifice of comrades who had fallen in
action since the last celebration of this anniversary.
A gruelling 22-mile route march took place on 16th
November, everyone in the Brigade taking part, except
the “lame and the halt” and a skeleton staff. The exacting
nature of the task was added to by the fact that it was one
of the hottest days since the Unit had left New Guinea,
but all except a few who “fell by the wayside” com-
pleted the march in the time allotted.
On 18th November Capt. Kent left for the R.A.A.F
School of Army Co-operation.
Tactical training on the sand table culminated in the


Brigade tactical exercises without troops, attended by
all officers. On 23rd November a new Brigade school to
train junior leaders and signallers was established and
Capt. Oliver was detached to it as Chief Instructor, with
Lieut. Walkley as Adjutant and Lieut. Thompson as
Assistant Signallers Instructor. Lieut. Lidgerwood also
joined the staff of the school, which, before it ended on
12 th December, was attended by the whole Signal
Platoon and 18 selected N.C.O’s and potential N.C.O’s.
Lack of athletic training handicapped Battalion mem-
bers at a Brigade sports meeting on 26th November.
Three days later the winter uniforms, issued on arrival
in Queensland from New Guinea, were withdrawn.
Reinforcements began to arrive, 24 on 2nd December
and 14 on sth December, while the arrival of a further
159 on 11th December brought the Battalion strength
near the war establishment figures.
Realistic training was carried out by all companies at
Samsonvale range, including field firing exercises.
On 6th December Lieut. Newton left to attend the
First Australian Army School on the Tablelands and
three days later Capt. Terry went to Beenleigh to attend
a tactical school.
On 12 th December platoons competed for the honour
of representing the Battalion at the next sports day in
the marching competition. The winner was 13 Platoon,
commanded by Lieut. Peckham.
While at Strathpine, both officers’ and sergeants’
messes flourished as far as rationing permitted. They
honoured all occasions worthy of celebration, and did so
in the best traditions. The troops’ entertainment was
catered for in an excellent recreation hut, presided over
by Mr Wilkinson, Salvation Army officer. There were
games, recorded music and a fine wireless set.
All companies were informed on 14th December that
they were on’embarkation notice, and must hold them-
selves ready for movement. That day the Unit’s eight


new jeeps were moved to Chermside where they were
concentrated with those of other units.
While this news was received with mixed feelings
there was considerable speculation regarding the possible
location at Christmas. Some troops, working on the old
soldier’s principle of “take it while you can”, returned
from leave with fantastic tales of what happened to them
during their respite from military duties.
There were excellent performances both in military
and atheletic events at the Brigade Field Day on 16th
December. In the principal event, the platoon drill, 13
Platoon, under command of Lieut. Peckham, did well
but had to be content with second place. All specialist
platoons had an opportunity to demonstrate their skill
in mounting and dismounting their weapons, and pro-
vided spectacular interludes. Brig. Edgar, D. 5.0., was
present, and personally presented the prizes.
Orders were received that an advance party of six
officers and three other ranks were to be ready to move
at 10 a.m. on 18th December. A Brigade parade was
ordered for 19th December.
Major Jahn, posted to the Unit, took command of
H.Q. Company.
The main basis of the advance party was B Company,
strengthened by members of A Company to complete
the number. Maj. Prince was O.C. of the party and his
officers were Capt. Hughes and Lieuts McSweeney,
Nurse and Mac Queen. Lieut. Mclntyre, Intelligence
officer, was the sole representative of Battalion H.Q. By
good organization the party was completely fitted and
ready to move well before the allotted time. They did
not leave, however, until 7.30 a.m. on 20th December,
to the accompaniment of “Auld Lang Syne” and “They
Are Jolly Good Fellows”. Farewells, as the band played
them out, were mingled with conjecture as to when and
where the remainder of the Unit would rejoin them.
At 2 p.m. on 17th December the C.O. held a Battalion


parade for an inspection of the troops in preparation
for the Brigade parade. The Battalion “marched past”
the saluting base, providing an inspiring spectacle as the
sunlight glinted on their bayonets. As reinforcements
had swelled the ranks, this was the largest parade for
almost two years.
B Company was not available for the Brigade parade,
because of the impending move, but the remaining com-
panies were evenly balanced to make four companies
each of 120 men.
Lt-Col. Cusworth directed the movements of the
Battalion and other Brigade units to their allotted
positions and all were in perfect aligment when at 2.15
p.m. Brig. Edgar, D. 5.0., arrived. His arrival was greeted
by General Salute, and he was obviously pleased by the
display when Lt-Col. Cusworth handed the parade to
him. After a close inspection, lasting more than an hour,
Brig. Edgar spoke to the troops, emphasizing that this
was the first occasion on which the whole Brigade had
paraded as one since his appointment as Brigade com-
mander. He concluded by extending everyone Christmas
greetings and good wishes. After being given another
General Salute he went to the saluting base where he
took the salute from the marching troops.
2g/46th Battalion was led by Maj. Jahn, the C.O.
having command of the Brigade Group. Bat-
talion band, which provided accompanying music
throughout the inspection, as well as the two General
Salutes, marched at the head of the Unit for more than
a mile during the return march, and, taking up position
near Battalion H.Q., played the troops in, the C.O.
taking the salute from each company successively.
Christmas 1944 was celebrated beneath the gums at
Strathpine. The C.O. spent much time personally organ-
izing festivities and arranging a special menu. The cele-
brations began on Christmas Eve with an impressive
open-air choral service conducted by Mr Wilkinson, in


which the Unit band and massed voices of the troops
mingled in a programme of carols. There was a moving
silence in memory of the fallen.
In the subsequent musical programme by the band
there was prolonged cheering when Lt-Col. Cusworth
took over the baton from Sgt (“Toscanini”) Barrett to
conduct the march “St Kilda”, and “Wilkie” performed
on the B-flat bass. An appropriate solo, “The Holy City”
was given by Lieut. Webster.
At 10.30 p.m. transport was provided for Roman Cath-
olic personnel wishing to attend midnight Mass, and
before Father Reis began the celebration of the Mass
there was more singing of carols.
There were other “less formal” festivities which went
far into the night, the Christmas “spirit” prevailing.
Those who took part in them were reported to have
been duly grateful for the delayed reveille on Christ-
mas morning.
The C.O. had prepared a programme for the day.
An extract from his Christmas greeting is: “All officers
join me in wishing every one of you a merry Christmas,
and we hope the day will be as pleasant for you as it is
within our power to make it, and that the next Christ-
mas will be spent in happier circumstances.”
The Christmas Day menus speak for themselves:
Breakfast: Porridge, fresh fish, chipped potatoes.
Dinner: Roast turkey, roast duck, seasoning, baked potatoes,
baked pumpkin, gravy, plum pudding, custard, ice cream,
and beer.
Tea: Cold poultry, cold meat, salad, paw-paw fruit salad,
ice cream.
A morning Protestant church parade was held, followed
by Church of England Holy Communion.
The day, which was hot, was spent mostly in “spine-
bashing”. At night there was a show at the Unit picture
theatre, concluding a day on which everyone was satis


fied that all possible arrangements had been made for
a fitting celebration of the yuletide season.
The C. 0., in a brief appeal to the troops, said: “This
is a season for giving, and it is fitting that we think of
those less fortunate than ourselves. I invite you to join
me in subscribing to the fund for the Legacy Club, whose
efforts are directed to the relief and education of orphans
of those who have given their lives for their country.
I feel sure you will agree it is a fitting cause at a fitting
time. Your company commander will arrange to receive
your donations.”
In a gratifying response £7B was collected, with a
particularly fine contribution of £3O/12/6 from H.Q.
Company.
B Company, which had left a short time before Christ-
mas, was unable to share in these festivities, but £2O in
canteen goods had been put aboard for distribution at
Christmas.
Returning promptly to training, troops spent Boxing
Day at firing practice on Strathpine Range. As movement
was imminent, all non-essential accommodation stores
were returned, all troops were fitted with good clothing
and equipment, and all other customary pre-movement
preparations made.
The stay at Strathpine had been longer than expected,
but the respite was welcomed, particularly by those whose
homes were in Brisbane. However, early in the New
Year embarkation orders brought to an abrupt end this
“Queensland interlude”.


CHAPTER XIII
JACQUINOT BAY
Meantime the advance party which had left Strathpine
on 20th December had joined the Taroona and with
advance parties from other units, which made up the
ship’s complement, headed “somewhere north”.
There was a brief stay at Milne Bay, which brought
back to some of the old hands memories of their first
adventure beyond the mainland. Christmas Eve was
spent quietly, as there was no shore leave, and next day
the ship again headed north, weaving a tortuous course
among the islands west of New Guinea. A sumptuous
Christmas dinner was prepared by the ship’s galley, which
did something to allay the general homesickness.
Early on the morning of Boxing Day land was sighted
—the island of New Britain, which proved to be the
destination. Hearts sank at the prospect of facing again
the rugged mountains, dense jungles and other tropical
hazards, but those more optimistically inclined reflected
that it could scarcely be worse than New Guinea.
Just before noon the Taroona anchored close inshore
in Jacquinot Bay on the east coast of the island, about
130 miles south of Rabaul. Troops were taken by barge
to a small coral beach which a humorist promptly named
“Bondi”. It was only a short march to the Battalion
area on the banks of the Wunung River. Tents had
already been erected, and as soon as everyone had been
accommodated there was a general stampede to the river.
After the necessary water restrictions aboard ship the
prospect of having an excellent swimming site close at
hand delighted the troops.
The river, about 50 yards wide, was clear, cold and


fast flowing. Bombing had destroyed a former bridge
across it, but a new one was being built. Enthusiasm
was dampened a day or so later when it was learned that
there were crocodiles in the river, but after a period of
cautious swimming without sighting a single “croc” the
troops concluded that they and the Japs must have been
evacuated about the same time.
The area, part of a young coconut plantation, had to
be cleared. Few of the trees bore fruit, the whole place
showing many signs of neglect. Clearing of the thick
undergrowth revealed a multitude of snakes, scorpions
and lizards. There were a few death adders, but most of
the snakes were of the python family, and fortunately
no one was bitten.
Within a few days dense vegetation was disappearing
before the clearing onslaughts of B Company, and the
work of making Jacquinot Bay clean and habitable went
ahead rapidly. Soon good roads serviced all encampments
and a barge service, operated by American engineers,
facilitated transport around the bay, where the Fifth
Australian Division and Base were established. Every-
where there was evidence of rapid development and
mail and canteen services were excellent considering
the short time in which the base had been established.
Within a week the bridge across the Wunung had been
finished, enabling road connection with points further
north along the bay, including Swan Beach, where 13 th
Brigade had a barge point.
One of the pleasing features of the new site was the
almost complete absence of mosquitoes. The sickness
rate was low, and apart from the usual skin infections
of the tropics, the Regimental Aid Post, conducted by
Cpl Reiter, had few customers in the settling-in period.
Lieut. Nurse was detached to H.Q. Fifth Australian
Division as “Beachmaster Bondi”, where he was respon-
sible for checking in and out the numerous barges sup-
plied for transport and working parties. At this stage the


tidal mouth of the Taut River was unbridged, and every-
thing had to come by barge.
New Year passed quietly and soon letters began to
arrive from Strathpine with picturesque descriptions
of the Christmas festivities. There were some faint twinges
of envy as the tales were passed round.
A picture show site was allotted close to the Battalion
area but the first screening did not take place until 12 th
January. A show had already been established at a gravel
pit near Brigade H.Q.
Meantime the remainder of the Brigade had em-
barked on the Duntroon at Brisbane on the morning
of 6th January. The trip through calm seas was without
event. There were no intermediate ports of call, and
five days later the disembarkation took place smoothly at
Jacquinot Bay. Within a few hours the Battalion took
up temporary abode in the limited number of available
tents, and the following day the companies moved out to
their allotted areas.
Several new officers joined the Battalion early in
January. On New Year’s Day Maj. Hodge arrived and
was posted Acting O.C. of A Company in the absence
of Capt. Terry, who was attending the L.H.Q. Tactical
School. On sth January, the day before embarkation,
Lieut. Knapstein (D Company), Lieuts Perringand Howe
(H.Q. Company), Lieut. Smith (A Company) and Lieut.
Monds (B Company) also joined the Unit. Lieut. Shaw
had gone to hospital while at Strathpine and was later
transferred to another unit. W.O. Laud left the Unit and
W.O. Nichols became regimental sergeant-major.
As soon as essential offices had been established all
personnel went vigorously to work on the clearing of
vines and creepers from the outskirts of the area. Mr
Wilkinson, Salvation Army representative, erected a
large marquee which served as a recreation hut and
writing room, where coffee was “on tap” each night.


Later the marquee was replaced by a substantial struc-
ture which included a lending library.
The clearing operations were impeded by the usual
demand for working parties which always fall to the lot
of an infantry battalion. The working parties were em-
ployed on road work and other duties in the Division
and Base areas. An airfield was being rapidly constructed
near Pal Mai Mai plantation, near Cape Cunningham
on the south side of the bay. Before long R.A.A.F. per-
sonnel began to arrive to prepare the way for squadrons
to operate against the Japs still holding out in Gazelle
Peninsula.
Training hours had been amended to conform to
adoption of “I” time, which applied to operations in the
Philippines. Some confusion was caused because Base,
although only a few miles away, still used “K” or Eastern
Standard time. In March, this time was extended to all
areas.
The rear party, which had remained at Madang when
the Unit went home in August, rejoined the Battalion on
18th January, making it complete except for those still
at Strathpine with the mainland rear details. At this
stage the Unit was almost at full war establishment
strength.
Earth tremors similar to those at Madang were noticed
at times, some of them being of considerable duration.
There were many fierce tropical downpours, particularly
in the late afternoon and at night, but the Unit was for-
tunate in that it had arrived in the dry season and had
time to prepare for the bad weather.
The dry season in New Britain varies as between the
north and south coasts. At Jacquinot Bay the heavy rains
normally fall between June and November, with August
as the wettest month, but days of continuous rain are
not uncommon throughout the year.
Natural drainage of the area was improved, paths and
office and tent floors were gravelled to prevent their


becoming the usual “sea of mud” in the wet season. Later
in the year offices and the Regimental Aid Post were
concreted to check the dust which is so often germ-laden
in the tropics. Strict malarial precautions and insistence
on highest hygiene standards kept the sickness rate low,
no cases of malaria being reported. Main worry was
caused by “tropical ear” (otitis externa).
The Battalion training areas were found to be rough
and poorly tracked, while the only available water came
from the Wunung River or unreliable waterholes. Maps
were inaccurate or misleading, and it was some time before
they could be corrected. Most of the track information
added to the local Drina map was the result of recon-
naissance by the Intelligence section of and 22nd
Battalions.
Lack of bridges, except the one on the main road north,
presented difficulties, but a new type of bridge was
devised and later perfected by Lieut. Downing,* the
Pioneer officer, to overcome the barrier of the Wunung
River. Stone cairns were erected at regular intervals
across shallow stretches of the river and the cairns were
linked by decking made of long planks or poles. Within
a few weeks a great variety of bridges spanned the river
at strategic points.
On 29th January intensive tactical training was under-
taken to enable sections and platoons to work as a team.
Emphasizing the need for uniformity, platoon exercises
and tactical exercises without troops were committed
to writing and discussed at conferences so that no points
would be overlooked. Despite the difficult country the
troops stood up well to the training, helped considerably
by their favourable living conditions in a comfortable
camp beside an excellent river. The work on the camp
site paid big dividends when the wet season arrived, and
* Later mentioned in despatches. Also mentioned in despatches, Sgt. R. Barry, Postal
Sergeant, Sgt T. Heenan, Pay Sergeant.


there was justifiable pride in the appearance of the whole
area.
There was a change of staff on 3rd February when
Lieut. Jarman was seconded to Fifth Division as Liaison
officer, his place as assistant Adjutant being taken by
Lieut. McSweeney. /
A party of six officers and 17 N.C.O’s from 13th Brigade
was attached for a week to observe the Battalion’s train-
ing. Company commanders and specialist officers from
this Brigade conferred with officers of Battalion
whose battle experience qualified them to answer the prac-
tical questions arising during active operations.
On Bth February Capt. Eames, M.C., left to attend the
L.H.Q. Tactical School, Maj. Jahn taking command of
D Company in his absence. Maj. Hodge took over H.Q.
Company.
An umpires’ school which began on 10th February was
attended by Capt. Hughes and Lieut. Knapstein. On com-
pletion of the school Capt. Hughes undertook instruc-
tion of all officers and senior N.C.O’s and this culminated
in exercises in which all took part.
4th Brigade decided to conduct a school for the train-
ing of potential N.C.O’s in jungle warfare. Capt. Oliver
was detached on 14th February as Chief Instructor to-
gether with Lieut. Webster and W.O. Herring, M.M., the
latter as school sergeant-major.
On the nights of 15th and 16th February “raiding
parties” under Lieut. McSweeney and Lieut. Marsden
tested the perimeter defences of B and C Companies
respectively. This unscheduled exercise taught some
valuable lessons and caused much interesting discussion.
All companies moved out the following week to bivouac
areas about a mile from camp along the Wunung River.
A long daily march was necessary to the new training area,
near Palar.
Reinforcement personnel quickly learnt from their
experience in the bivouac areas how to construct rain


proof “doovers”. From Unit “veterans” they also learnt
other lessons not featured in the curriculum of L.H.Q.
training centre. The bivouac site was excellent and the
weather favourable, despite moist and showery nights.
Battalion H.Q. also moved out for two days and prac-
tised the formation of perimeters.
On the morning of 23rd February Lt-Gen. V. A. B.
Sturdee, C. 8., C.8.E., D. 5.0., G.O.C. First Australian
Army, accompanied by Maj.-Gen. Ramsay C. 8., C.8.E.,
D. 5.0., E.D., G.O.C. Fifth Division, paid the Unit a brief
visit.
The Unit band, despite the handicap of having mem-
bers with little previous experience, continued to prac-
tise assiduously and raise its standard. Sgt Geoff Barrett,
the bandmaster, did an excellent job, while Lt-Col. Cus-
worth gave every encouragement, including the provision
of new instruments. A long list of invitation performances
began with a recital at 105 Casualty Clearing Station on
22 nd February.
On 24th February the rear details who had assembled
at Strathpine with 37752nd Australian Infantry Battalion
arrived at Jacquinot Bay on the Katoomba. They in-
cluded Capt. Terry and Lieut. Newton, who were
returning from schools, together with 80 other ranks.
Another change in appointments occurred on 26th Feb-
ruary when Capt. Hipsley went to 4th Brigade as trans-
port officer. In the absence of Capt. Oliver command of
C Company was taken by Capt. Phillips and Capt. Terry
resumed his posting as O.C. of A Company.
Intensive training continued until 12th March, when
a week’s rest was taken with a syllabus made up chiefly
of organized sport, culminating in a carnival on the
Wunung River. Brig. Edgar and members of Brigade
staff were present to see many fine displays of skill,
despite the fast currents of the river. A Company won
the points aggregate narrowly. Events of special interest
were the lakatoi race, won by Capt. Hughes, and the


water-ski race, won by Lt-Col. Cusworth and W. 0.1.
Nichols. A great deal of time and labour had been spent
on the building of a number of water craft, some of which
could be used for racing. Finest of them was a sea-going
craft, designed and built by Capt. Mollison, the Quarter-
master, complete with engine, which enabled its proud
owner to chug merrily round the bay.
A defensive scheme, as a precaution against the possi-
bility of Japanese aggression by land or sea, was drawn
up for the Jacquinot Bay area. 4th Brigade became
responsible for defence of the area between the Wunung
and Taut Rivers, including the airstrip. The C. 0., Adju-
tant and Intelligence Officer made a reconnaissance of
the front for which Battalion was to be respon-
sible, and company commanders then pin-pointed the
positions of their defences. As there did not appear to be
any imminent danger of attack, companies were not
moved into these positions but they were marked in
readiness should the need arise. The Tank Attack Platoon
was to co-operate in the beach defence plan.
An occasional enemy plane ventured as far south as
Jacquinot Bay, but no bombs were dropped in the
Brigade area. However, several alerts served as a reminder
that there was still an enemy. In April a plane was shot
down while attacking a P.T. boat, but anti-aircraft fire
from the local defences kept the intruders at a safe
distance.
Meantime 6th Brigade was maintaining a steady ad-
vance towards Wide Bay with very little contact with
the Japs.
On the newly-constructed Wunung airstrip a Brigade
parade was held on the morning of 17 th March, Brig.
Edgar being favourably impressed by the good condition
of the troops. It was evident that healthy, comfortable
camp life had made up a lot for the rigours of intensive
training in jungle country.
A Battalion concert, organized by Lieut. McSweeney,


was the highlight of St Patrick’s night. Considering the
limitations of costumes and stage, it was a huge success,
with the band doing its usual good job between the vocal
items and humorous sketches. Pte Mark Harris proved
an able compere. Among well-known personalities who
contributed to an enjoyable show were Harry Fedley,
“Doc” Graham, “Swede” Kelson and “Tich” Williams.
Sgt “Jock” Smith showed considerable talent and helped
greatly with the sketches. For a wonder it was a rainless
night, helping to ensure success of the entertainment.
Among the guests of Lt-Col. Cusworth were Brig. Edgar,
Lt-Col. Carstairs (of 22nd Battalion) and Lt-Col. Em-
brey (37752nd Battalion). All thoroughly enjoyed the
show.
Next week’s daily rain, which turned all low-lying areas
into quagmires, gave a foretaste of the “wet” season.
Improved drainage and construction of firmer paths
helped to control the mud nuisance, and the wet weather
syllabus went into operation to spare the troops as much
inconvenience as possible.
On 21st March the Unit was honoured by a brief visit
by Gen. Sir Thomas Blarney, who was engaged in a tour
of all operational areas. He was accompanied by Maj.-
Gen. Ramsay and Brig. Edgar. After an exchange of
greetings with Lt-Col. Cusworth, Gen. Blarney inspected
part of the Unit area.
The new recreation hut, built by the Unit Pioneers,
was opened on 25th March with an impromptu concert
and soon became a Unit rendezvous.
Lord Wakehurst, Governor of New South Wales, ac-
companied by Lady Wakehurst and Lady Blarney, visited
Jacquinot Bay on 29th March. The Unit band and a
selected Guard of Honour of a platoon from each bat-
talion in 4th Brigade gave them a fine reception at the
airstrip. After inspecting the guard Lord Wakehurst
congratulated Lt-Col. Cusworth on the fine performance


of the band and the excellent turn-out of the men of
2g/46th Battalion.
Towards the end of the month, unusually heavy rains
caused the Wunung River to rise, sweeping away the im-
provised bridges. The one built by B Company near
the company lines was swept downstream almost intact.
A short course of air photo interpretation was con-
ducted for selected officers and N.C.O’s early in April
by members of the Intelligence Section. The Mortar and
Machine Gun Platoons carried out a shoot at a point
three miles up the Wunung River.
On 1 ith April there was a short air raid alert, but the
bombs were dropped harmlessly in the sea, the impres-
sive ack-ack barrage apparently convincing the pilot that
his mission had little chance of success.
Maj. Prince was transferred to 22nd Battalion on 14th
April and Capt. Hughes, who had been detached to 37/
52nd Battalion, rejoined the Unit as O.C. of B Company.
Capt. Terry went to 4th Brigade as Brigade Major
(learner), and Capt. Phillips became O.C. of A Company.
The same day Lieut. Meacham was taken to hospital,
but returned a few days later.
The Unit volley ball team, recruited from Battalion
H.Q., completed its unbeaten record by becoming divi-
sional champions.
On 15th April a small leave draft of 12 personnel left
on the Taroona. On 22 nd April Lieuts Williams, Watson
and Hollier joined the Unit and were posted to A, C
and D Companies respectively.'
Capt. Jensen and Sgt White, of L.H.Q. Gas School,
were attached to the Unit on 18th April to train instruc-
tors in the use of the flame-thrower, giving the Unit its
first experience of this effective weapon. A demonstration
at the New Guinea Force Training School gave impres-
sive proof of its value against enemy strongpoints. Lieut.
Hollier and selected N.C.O’s and men soon became very
proficient in the use of the flame-thrower and throughout
K


the training period huge clouds of black smoke were seen
to billow forth from behind C Company’s lines.
There was an unfortunate incident during the month
when Pte Stenner of A Company was accidentally
wounded by a grenade fragment. Complications followed
and despite desperate efforts by the staff of 105 Casualty
Clearing Station, his life could not be saved. There was
an impressive funeral service in the C.C.S. chapel.
During the month the New Guinea Force School was
established near Wunung airstrip and Lieut. Lidger-
wood left the Unit on'2Bth April to attend the first course
in the new location.
Bob Dyer, of the Tivoli Circuit, accompanied by female
artists—the first civilians personnel had seen for many
months—gave a show at 22nd Battalion during his tour
of combat areas. The programme was very well received.
About this time leave drafts were begun again, the
first party to go home being those who had stayed behind
as rear party at Madang. A second draft left on 26th
April. It included Maj. Jahn, Lieut. Knapstein and 34
others.
In this month there was a change of command of
H.Q. Fifth Division, Lt-Gen. H. C. H. Robertson, C.8.E.,
D. 5.0., taking over from Maj.-Gen. Ramsay. The new
G.O.C. paid his first official visit to the Unit on goth
April, being welcomed by Lt-Col. Cusworth, who then
introduced company commanders and staff.
Inter-company competition increased interest in a
second period of sport which began on 30th April.
Soft-ball, table tennis, and basketball competitions were
organized, the games including several matches against
outside teams. On Bth May a second swimming carnival
was held on the Wunung River, D Company carrying
off the honours.
On 4th May C Company moved to the area vacated
by 37/52nd Battalion, which had left for Open Bay.


Three days later A Company also moved to the same
area, leaving only three companies on the original site.
Early in May when Capt. Oliver was transferred to
29th Brigade, Lieut. Peckham received a well-merited
promotion to the rank of captain on his appointment as
O.C. of C Company.
Official news of victory in Europe was received on 9th
May 1945. A Brigade Thanksgiving Service was held in
22nd Battalion area, members of all Units attending. It
was conducted by Chaplain Hibbard. The 2g/46th
Battalion band provided music and Ptes Dutton and
Green sounded the Last Post and Reveille.
There was a large attendance at a Thanksgiving Mass
celebrated by Chaplain Reis in the Battalion
area. Celebrations were carried out in both officers’ and
sergeants’ messes. Brig. Edgar and Maj. MacPherson
(Brigade Major) were entertained by Lt-Col. Cusworth
in the mess, but heavy rain unfortunately delayed the
Unit concert planned for that night. There were certain
unofficial celebrations also that night, but details were
not available for publication.
Capt. Ray Eames, M.C., returned from successful com-
pletion of the L.H.Q. Tactical School course and re-
sumed command of D Company on 10th May. The same
day, Capt. Terry returned from 4th Brigade and re-
sumed his appointment as O.C. of A Company.
The Unit concert, delayed from VE day, took place the
following night, and was a conspicuous success. The band
was resplendent in blue coats, white shirts and black bow
ties. There was a two-hour programme of sketches, songs
and band numbers, the climax being a presentation of
“Cinderella” in which John Dwyer played the feminine
lead with artistry and distinction and Lieut. Andy
Mclnnes, as the village queen, gave a moving perform-
ance. Pte Mark Harris was again to the fore as a comedian,
cheerfully ad-libbing his way through a number of
sketches. Supporting artists included Charlie (“Swede”)


Kelson, Harry Fedley, “Doc” Graham and a host of
others.
After 10 days of sport and relaxation training was re-
sumed, and there was a high standard of efficiency in all
departments. The area was continually being improved,
and additional ranges and firing courses were constructed
to add variety to training. Training films were screened
in the Battalion area to supplement normal training.
On 20th May Lieut. Morgan was detached to H.Q.
4th Brigade as O.C. 25 Guard Platoon, 2/1 Guard Regi-
ment. The following night the First Australian Army
Entertainment Unit staged a concert in C Company
area and gave a polished performance. On 22nd May the
finals of a boxing tournament were held in the excellent
boxing ring, which also served as a bandstand and concert
stage. In the interval Lt-Col. Cusworth presented prizes
to successful competitors from the last sports week.
Heavy rain in the third week in May at times inter-
rupted training. As from 1 oth May company picquets no
longer operated and a regimental guard was mounted
daily at 6 p.m. Inspections were carried out at the slow
march, and the turn-outs and drill of the guards were
uniformly excellent.
The H.Q. Administrative block was enlarged by the
removal of the Intelligence office to a separate building,
and the floors of all offices were concreted, greatly adding
to their appearance and comfort. Early in June the civic
square outside Battalion H.Q. was gravelled to improve
drainage.
To improve facilities for competitive sport an arena
was constructed in the old area vacated by A Company.
The levelling work was lightened by use of a bulldozer
kindly lent by the 55th Australian Field Park Company.
On 4th June the C.O. and other selected officers at-
tended 4th Brigade H.Q. where Maj.-Gen. Robertson
addressed the group on duties in their units and the
standards he sought in the Division. The Battalion was


then issued with 4th Brigade Operational Instruction
No. 4, wherein action was to be taken immediately by this
Battalion for a defensive fire plan covering the area
between Taut and Wunung Rivers. After contact with all
sub-units in the area the scheme was completed and
approved.
Incessant rain (4664 points for the month, 25 inches
below the maximum recording over seven years but still
only the initiation of the “wet” season) flooded the Bat-
talion H.Q. area, necessitating evacuation of tents for
one night. After this, further improvements were made
in the drainage system.
With the news of an impending visit by the Duke
of Gloucester, Governor-General of Australia, active
preparations were undertaken. Clothes and equipment
were issued for rehearsals of the combined parade at
Wunung airstrip until the standard was pronounced to
be “fit for any duke”.


CHAPTER XIV
VISIT OF DUKE OF GLOUCESTER AND PEACE
1st July - 8th August 1945
The opening of this period was marked auspiciously
by the arrival of the Duke of Gloucester. The big day
dawned with the sun breaking through rain clouds and
making conditions very humid. This was unfortunate
because of the bustle of preparations for the Brigade
parade and the uncertainty as to procedure because of
lack of precedent for such a visit.
The Brigade Guard of Honour, under Capt. Terry,
left the Unit at 9.30 a.m. for the airstrip, where they
assembled with the band to receive the Royal visitor.
Without any implied reflection upon His Royal High-
ness, the two main topics of comment by troops after
the arrival of the Duke and his entourage were the size
and impressiveness of both the Duke’s plane and his
A.D.C., Brig. Schreiber.
From independent sources there came encouraging
assessments of the performance of both the guard and
band, reflecting high credit on Capt. Terry, who trained
the guard, and Sgt Barrett, the bandmaster. Credit for
their high standard that day must go also to individual
members of the guard and band. The meticulous care
and pride that went into the polish and precision of their
turn-out could have been achieved only by individual
enthusiasm.
Work on the Wunung airstrip and dais was completed,
and at 2.5 p.m. the Battalion marched on to the Brigade
parade. Onlookers agreed that it was a fine military


ceremony, the drill and steadiness of the Brigade being
of a high order.
Contrary to expectations, and to the pleasure of the
troops, the Duke inspected every man and spoke to a
few, including the Regimental Sergeant-Major, W. 0.11
Herring, M.M., and W. 0.11 Ford.
By his questions His Royal Highness showed consid-
erable interest in the history and activities of the Unit.
After the inspection the Brigade “marched past”, again
showing high standard in its work.
The day’s duties for the men ended soon afterwards,
and they dismissed with feelings of relief and satisfaction
in a job well done. The band, however, rushed off for
a hasty meal and then to Division where it played from
5.30 p.m. until 10.15 P-m.— a herculean task to which its
members stood up most creditably.
The next day was spent quietly, with renewed atten-
tion to urgent maintenance. The band again performed
at Division in the evening.
The next cause for enthusiasm was the fine record of
the Unit football team in disposing of challengers from
other units. On 7th July it defeated 4th Field Ambulance
by 15 goals 10 behinds to 4 goals 11 behinds, and a week
later it defeated 52 Line Section by 14 goals 22 behinds
to 6 goals 6 behinds. On 18th July it defeated 41 Landing
Craft by 16 goals 17 behinds to 6 goals 7 behinds and
later 22nd Battalion by 9 goals 19 behinds to 5 goals 9
behinds.
On 10th and 1 ith July a Jacquinot Bay sports meeting,
reflecting great credit on its organizers, was held on
Wunung airstrip. Successful entrants from the Battalion
were Sgt Pemberton, Cpl Crum and teams in M.M.G.,
signals, 2-inch mortars and basketball competitions.
Lieut. Lidgerwood and Pte Furlong put up a fine per-
formance in reaching the final of the table tennis.
Returning from leave on sth July Maj. Jahn was
posted 2 i/c of the Battalion. On 22nd July he took


over command while Lt-Col. Cusworth was detached to
take over command of 37752nd Battalion, then in an
operational role at Open Bay. When Maj. Jahn was later
taken to hospital Maj. Hodge took command of the
Battalion.
Command of the area changed from Fifth Division to
Eleventh Division on 25th July, and on Ist August
Maj.-Gen. Eather relieved Maj.-Gen. Robertson, who
left to take up a posting as G.O.C. Sixth Division, with
Lieut. Newton as A.D.C.
The Unit football team maintained its fine record by
defeating 18 Army Ordnance Depot by 22 goals 13 be-
hinds to 2 goals 8 behinds. Spurred on by the triumphs
of this team, New South Wales and Queensland person-
nel decided to form their own Rugby League team. It
was at first “uphill” work but a win, 20 points to 6,
against the Docks Operating Company on 6th August
encouraged it to further efforts.
The even tenor of camp life was disturbed when a
batman set fire to the Commander’s hut while drying
clothes on a “patent” drying machine. Little damage was
done, however, and the Pioneers soon completed repairs.
This hut, by the way, proved a valuable refuge for Maj.
Jahn when the Battalion Headquarters were threatened
by flood waters from the almost continuous rain in the
mountains. Two members of the Unit, Lieut. Williams
and Pte Pearson, had narrow escapes from the floods.
Lieut. Boles, who joined the Unit on sth August, was
posted Intelligence Officer in place of Lieut. Mclntyre,
who had returned to the mainland.
Accompanied by Brig. Edgar, Maj.-Gen. K. W. Eather,
C.8.E., D. 5.0., E.D., paid his introductory visit to the
Unit and made a general inspection of the area.
After midnight on 10th August a terrific barrage by
the A.A. guns roused personnel from their slumbers and
recalled vivid memories of past air raids. Temporary
anxiety turned to revelry when it was announced by


wireless that Japan had accepted the conditions set out
at Potsdam.
Next day a Catalina brought Lt-Col. Cusworth back
from Open Bay to resume command of the Unit. He
reported that he had received complete co-operation
during his sojourn with the “sister Battalion”.
The Unit’s football colours remained on high when
the same day 33 Line Section was defeated by 22 goals
16 behinds to 5 goals 7 behinds.
Enthusiasm for celebration waned during the delay in
announcing victory, but when at last the announcement
came there was a general relaxation of nerve tension, if
little actual excitement.
As a move to Rabaul was anticipated, preparations
were made to ensure lack of bustle and “panic” when
the time came. Surplus stores were put away in boxes
and tents were numbered and painted the familiar
“brown, yellow, brown”.
Training now became drill in the morning and sport
in the afternoon, the Rugby team showing its mettle
by defeating 88 Transport Company by 18 to nil, and
12 Army Troops by 31 to 5 on 23rd August.
The first recorded peacetime Australian Rules premier-
ship was decided on 22nd August, when B and C Com-
panies met in a fine match that lacked only “hot dogs”
and female-propelled umbrellas to complete the picture
of a pleasant Saturday afternoon at home. With Lt-Col.
Cusworth, former Carlton player, as field umpire, the
match began at terrific pace, with weight used freely
but fairly, the little men “infiltrating” with the tradi-
tional skill of the “boys from Melbourne”. B Company
won a brilliant game by 8 goals 6 behinds to 5 goals 4
behinds.
The Rugby team, confident from its recent successes,
challenged Royal New Zealand Air Force, which agreed
to play Rugby Union. More than a thousand turned up
at Cusworth Oval to see the first game of its kind on the


island. A spectacular three-quarter line movement early
in the match resulted in the opening score by 29th Bat-
talion. Next score came when 29th Battalion was awarded
a penalty on the Kiwis’ 25 and Wilde put it through,
making the score 6 to nil. New Zealand opened its score
when Johnstone took the ball through on the toe. In
the second half New Zealand was far stronger in the
rucks, preventing 29th Battalion from scoring, despite
its consistent furious attacks. The three-quarter line
worked beautifully but could not penetrate the Kiwis’
defences. However, 2g/4fith Battalion won a fast and
keenly-contested game by 9 points to 5. Its unbroken
Jacquinot Bay record was maintained when on 29th
August it defeated Eleventh Division H.Q. by 19 points
to 11. The opposition was strong despite lack of some
of its best players who had not yet arrived from the main-
land.
The last of the series of outside matches was played on
Ist September when the recently-returned 37752nd Bat-
talion mustered a football team but “went under” to
the Battalion by 15 goals 19 behinds to 10 goals 9 behinds.
After rehearsals of a Brigade parade for an inspection
by the G.O.C. had been held on Wunung airstrip, heavy
rain and the impending move eventually caused cancel-
lation of the parade.
On 3rd September definite movement to Rabaul be-
came assured, and the last stage in the packing of stores
and equipment was reached. It was a case of: “Mind out
Rabaul, here we come!”


CHAPTER XV
OCCUPATION OF RABAUL
The move to Rabaul, as it turned out, was something
like “the last round up”. The Battalion was ready on
time, but as usual there was delay. However, at 4 p.m.
on gth September 1945, the first of the Battalion were
laboriously staggering up the gangway beneath an array
of packs, haversacks, water-tins, stretchers, shovels, mor-
tars and accessories. They were shown to their sleeping
quarters, part of which was on the deck of H.M.S.
Manoora.
After 12 hours of sailing the light of dawn etched the
outlines of ranges and volcanoes standing like sentinels
near the entrance to Rabaul harbour. There was a hur-
ried breakfast and packing of gear in readiness for dis-
embarkation. The naval escort manoeuvred into a pro-
tective position and soon the ship lay at anchor while
barge transport to the shore was awaited.
Following the return of a reconnaissance party the
barges were soon moving beachwards and the stage was
set for a scene that was to be recorded in newspapers,
theatres and history. At 9.10 a.m. on 10th September
the barges grounded and A Company, under command
of Capt. Terry, was led ashore by Sgt. Strahan. This was
the first stage in the occupation of what had been regarded
as an impregnable Japanese fortress.
Risks could not be taken as there were reports that
Japanese marines had not agreed to surrender. As part
of a precautionary plan A Company formed the beach-
head while the remainder of the Battalion came ashore.
Moving to the south, C Company filled its role of form-
ing a road block and Battalion H.Q., B, D and H.Q.


Companies trekked north to a bivouac area near Togoi
Wharf. It was a long way, particularly on a hot day and
with heavy gear, but interest was aroused by the new
role of meekness and politeness by the “sons of Nippon”.
The remnants of cars, once proud possessions of
Rabaul civilians, chugged along the roads and there were
many mutterings from the labouring troops when they
saw that the occupants were well-fed Japanese.
B and D Companies, after a rest and a meal, pushed
on to Talili Bay, after examining dumps and tunnels
and relieving Jap guards in their path.
Arduous patrols were carried out by all companies
until every dump in the allotted area had been located,
pin-pointed and examined. Tunnels containing valuable
equipment were guarded to prevent looting and up-
heaval among dissenting Japs, but the honeycomb nature
of these tunnels prevented complete exclusion of the
übiquitous souvenir-hunters, despite the proficiency of
the guards.
Hatred of the Japs was intensified as Indian, Nether-
lands East Indies and Chinese P.O.W’s reached company
lines in search of friendship and news. They related,
and bore on their persons evidence of, the atrocities they
had suffered.
Exchange of native foods, paw-paws, beans, marrows
and potatoes for cigarettes' and “bulmakeu” made the
meals palatable, and there was a helpful supply of “wash
wash” boys to help with the laundry. In fact, one officer
who visited an outpost to make sure that the troops were
paying attention to their personal appearance suffered
the surprise and embarrassment of finding the men a
jump ahead of his own dress, as the natives insisted upon
ironing the clothing as well as washing it.
As soon as the Battalion had completed its allotted
task it was concentrated on the picturesque shores of
Talili Bay. With the changing order from war to peace


farewells were already being said to many old comrades
leaving to go back to civilian life.
And with that changing order the events this book has
sought to record came to an end. Factual, objective re-
porting has been preferred to any attempt at dramatiza-
tion. In fact, the whole of this story of the Unit was
originally written by members of the Unit. All that has
been done has been to re-arrange their writings to
preserve sequence, with a little discreet (and, it is hoped,
unobtrusive) editing to maintain some uniformity of
style.
Perhaps the story might end with a news report which
conveys admirably some idea of the magnitude of the
task allotted to the Australian force which landed in
New Britain in November 1944:
NEW BRITAIN CAMPAIGN - WAR’S BRAVEST BLUFF
The bravest bluff the Australians ever pulled off can now
be revealed. It was the campaign in New Britain.
1400 Australian troops, two heavy guns and seven Wirra-
ways opposed the Japanese landing at Rabaul in January
1942. They failed, inevitably.
Since then their successors have succeeded, but the numerical
odds were still against Australia.
An Australian force of 8000, under command Fifth Division
“contained” 89,000 Japs within narrow defences in which the
enemy held three years’ supply of food and equipment.
The New Britain campaign was one of the best-managed
and most audacious Australian actions of the whole war—
a classic of a great deal being done by a very few.
