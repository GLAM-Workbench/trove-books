PATRIOTIC POEM.
“ADVANCE TO THE FRONT, AUS-
TRALIANS.”
Composed by B. F. James. Copyright.
Australia’s gallant sons have gone
To fight tor England’s fame—•
For honour and for glory;
They will help to keep her name.
Our boys they’ll find are loyal and true,
Wherever they may go^ —
To help the dear old Motherland
To fight the German foe.
Australia’s naval boys have met
And fought the foe at sea;
Soon they made the Kaiser think
He’d better let them be;
For on the sea our boys have proved
Their gun a-bil-ity
To keep the dear old Motherland
Still Mistress of the Sea.
There’s Russia,, France and Can-a-da,
Our loyal Indians, too; .
The gallant little Belgians,
Who surprised the whole world through;
Now, with the aid of 1 It-alv,
And Japs, on land and sea,
Soon they’ll all make Kaiser Bill
Sing- out for sym-pathy.
Advance to the front,. Australians,
Show the Kaiser what we mean to do.
We’ll stick staunch and true to dear ©ld
England,
To auickly put old Kaiser Billv through.
Both on land and sea we’ll show him
British bull-dog breed we be-.
We’ll fight for our liberty and freedom—-
Australia’s sons are we.
