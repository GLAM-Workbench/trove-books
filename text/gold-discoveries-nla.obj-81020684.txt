AMONG the accidents which have influenced the fortune of
the world will hereafter be ranked the erection of a saw-
mill on a branch of the Sacramento. An officer in the Swiss
guards of Charles X.? ? a good old Dutchman ? according to
Mr. Coke?who received an ugly wound while fighting against
the barricaders of July, found France no place for him when the
conspiracy of Messrs, Lafitte and Co, triumphed. He crossed
the Atlantic and proffered his services to the Mexican govern-
ment, He served well, we must suppose, for very speedily he
was rewarded with a grant of land in Alta California, comprising
some 700 or 800 square miles?the extent of a fair-sized English
county!
Three hundred years had elapsed since Cortes discovered the
Californian peninsula. Some years later a Spanish navigator
visited the coast further north, and took formal possession of it,,
but, strangely enough, the adventurers, in their eager search for
gold, overlooked the richest prize of the New Continent. The
valley of the Sacramento yields yearly a greater treasure than in


the first fifty years after the discovery of America could he
wrested from the ancient kingdoms of Mexico and Peru. Some
Jesuit missions were early established in Lower California, but,
so far as any real use of the country was concei?ned, it might as
Avell have remained unknown. The missionaries did their best to
secure themselves from intrusion by representing the soil as
barren, the climate pestilent, the people cruel and treacherous.
Nothing but zeal for the glory of God could render life bearable
in such a region. They established themselves in Alta California
at about the same time that they were expelled from the chief
kingdoms of Europe, and had they manifested any true capacity
for government, they might have retrieved in the New World
their losses in the Old. But their policy has very little corre-
sponded with the idea entertained of their profound and subtle
wisdom. Their aim has been always isolation ?as if isolation
could have any other consequence than to dwarf or deform the
standard of man. The illustrious nobility of Spain, who pride
themselves on their constant intermarriages, exhibit Grildrigs
and mannikins as the descendants of the chivalry which rolled
back the wave of Mahommedan conquest. Intellectual exclusive-
ness leads to yet more miserable results. All trace has long been
lost in the Jesuit missions of the higher qualities ascribed to
their founders. Enthusiasm was represented by bigotry?piety
by juggling?and benevolence by tyranny. The rule of Francia
in Paraguay and of Rosas in Buenos Ayres sufficiently illustrates
the tendency of Jesuit teaching.
The travellers who at rare intervals visited the coast of Cali-
fornia could do little to dispel the gloomy fictions of the mis-
sionaries, and when they spoke vaguely of rocks abounding in
ores, or of the black soil appearing, when turned up freshly to
the sun, intei?mingled with scales of gold, these things were set
down among the strange sights which travellers are privileged to
see. When the Jesuits fell in Spain, a commissioner was sent
out to report on the real condition of this peninsula, but though
his report was highly favourable, and distinctly mentioned gold
mines, and though he himself at a subsequent date became
minister of the Indies, no steps would seem to have been taken
to test this reported richness of the soil. A glance at any of our
best maps of a dozen years old will show how little was then
known of that wide region which stretches from Cape San Lucas
to the Oregon boundary, and from the Rio del Norte and the
Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Ocean. Basil Hall notices that
before the arrival of the Conway at San Bias, no English man-
of-war had ever anchored in that port.
The Santa Fe traders were among the first to perceive the
commercial
i.


commercial importance of Alta California. Of all the heroes
of commerce, we are inclined to rank as the most marvellous
those merchant bands who set forth on a journey of two thousand
miles through an unexplored country where not a vestige of
civilized life existed?with broad and rapid rivers to ford?pre-
cipitous rocks to scale and descend?paths to force through
mountain passes, and roads to form over swamp and morass?
dependent wholly on chance for supplies of water and fodder?
certain of the hostility of tribes of Indians whose hunting grounds
they invaded?and, should they ever reach their point, likely to
meet with a rough reception there. Many pens have been
busied with the burning prairie?the stampede the awful
storms which sweep over those oceanic solitudes the night
attack of savages?the tortures of extreme thirst?the liability to
destruction from the theft or death of cattle?the hopeless dis-
appearance of individuals who ventured too far from the waggons
?yet it is felt that descriptions can give but a faint idea of the
realities.
The way once opened was never suffered to be closed; and
by and by companies of adventurers were formed for other pur-
poses than trade. The easy acquisition of Texas was remem-
bered, and the piratical expedition recorded by Kendall?though
ending in defeat and cruel suffering?only stimulated further the
more restless part of the States? population to seize a country
which it was evident there would be no force to defend against a
determined assault. And ere long their own feeble government
found it necessary or expedient to yield to the fast-spreading
movement of the popular mind.
Faithful to the Mexican government, our veteran turned out
with his people when the territory was invaded?although it
seems most probable that he saw from the first the hopeless-
ness of the contest. Of the few settlers in California hardly
any knew their government save by its extortions. It vexatiously
interfered with their concerns, but it did not protect them. Their
interests were on the side of the invaders, and they very cheer-
fully concurred in the arrangement which enrolled their ter-
ritory under the flag of stars and stripes. Captain Sutter re-
turned uninjured to his estate, and had soon cause, in the
increased prosperity of his clearing, to be well satisfied with the
change. He was the first white man who had established him-
self in that district where the Americanos joins the Sacramento.
Without the slightest idea of the treasures beneath his feet, he
had by degrees brought two or three hundred acres into culti-
vation. The Indians troubled him at first, but he had taken the
precaution to bring some guns with him, and on an attack he
threw


threw a shell into the midst of their force, which effectually dis-
persed them, and inspired a salutary dread of his power. Sub-
sequently they became useful, though never very safe, neighbours,
and assisted the Captain in building his fort and tilling his fields.
He had been settled ten years before he contracted with a
Mr. Marshall for the erection of a saw-mill on the Americanos, a
few miles from his fort. The ? tail-race ? being too narrow for
the water to run off freely, the mill-wheel was taken out that the
whole body of water in the dam might rush through, and widen
the race to save the trouble of digging it out. A great body of
loose earth was carried away by the torrent, and the next morning,
while Mr. Marshall was surveying the work, he observed some
shining yellow spangles on spots where the water had laid bare
the bank. At first he would not take the trouble to stoop for
them, but his eye being caught by a particle of superior magni-
tude, he picked it up, and found that it had all the appearance
of pure gold. He then collected some twenty or thirty similar
pieces, and imagining these might be the fragments of some
treasure buried by the Indians, he examined the neighbouring
soil, and found it to be more or less auriferous. In joyful
excitement he hurried off to Captain Sutter. They commenced a
search together, and soon satisfied themselves that the soil was
teeming with gold?they picked up an ounce of the ore from
the sand without trouble. The next morning they continued
their exploration, and found gold in abundance up the South
Fork. With his knife the Captain picked out a lump of an
ounce and a half from the rock.
They had prosecuted their search quite secretly, as they thought,
but a Kentuckian, employed at the mill, had ? guessed ? and ? cal-
culated ? on their unusual movements ; he followed in their steps
and imitated their actions. When the gentlemen returned to the
mill they were met by their workmen, who showed a handful of
the glittering dust. Whether the captain and his companion
were learned in the mysteries of mica and pyrites we are not
informed, but they did their best to convince the men that w hat
they took for gold was some worthless mineral. While the col-
loquy was proceeding, an Indian, who had elsewhere seen enough
of gold mines, decisively exclaimed, ? Oro, oro! ? Concealment
was no longer possible. The captain, that he might be first in
the field, hired a gang of fifty Indians, and set them at work.
The news spread ; fresh hands poured in, and the results of
their operations were soon beyond the dreams of the ? good old
Dutchman.?
The first announcement of the discovery was received with
incredulity beyond the immediate neighbourhood. But pre-
sently,


sently, when large and continuous imports of gold from San
Francisco placed the matter beyond doubt, there ensued such
a stir in the States, as even in that go-a-head region is wholly
without parallel. Numbers of every age, and of every variety
of occupation, pushed for the land of promise. Many were
accompanied by their families, and most, under the excitement
of the hour, overlooked their physical unfitness and their inability
to procure necessaries. The waters of the Humboldt, from their
head to their ? sink??a space of nearly 300 miles?are in the
dry season strongly impregnated with alkali; and it was here
that they first began to faint. Some died from thirst?others
from ague?others fell beneath the burdens they attempted to
cai?ry when their last animals dropped into the putrid line which
grew thicker at every step. Beyond the ? sink ? the diminished
bands had to encounter sixty or seventy miles of desert, where
not a blade of herbage grew, and not a drop of pure water
could be procured; and those who pushed safely through this
ordeal had still to ascend the icy slopes of the Sierra Nevada,
when the rigours of winter were added to all other difficulties.
At different points?one being almost in sight of the golden land
?overwearied groups had formed encampments, in case perhaps
some help might reach them. It is to the credit of the settlers
that, on hearing of this, they strained their resources to the
utmost to afford relief. Yet, when all was done, a sick, destitute,
most wretched horde of stragglers was all that remained of the
multitude, who, full of hope and spirits, had commenced the
prairie-journey.
Enterprise and energy have now overcome or smoothed the
Avorst difficulties of the route. A great central railroad has been
projected, and will probably at no distant time be formed. As
it is, says Mr. Kelly in the preface to his entertaining ? Journey
across the Rocky Mountains/ ?
? Replenishing depots have been established at convenient points in
the wilderness ; the faint Indian trail has become a beaten thorough-
fare ; the morasses no longer threaten to engulph the traveller; the
rapid rivers are ferried over ; the thicket is pierced ; the forests felled ;
the rugged pass smoothed ; there is a well in the desert; and the terror
of retribution keeps the Indians in awe.?
To this time the stream of life flowing into California has kept
continually increasing. Upwards of 20,000 souls, and about
50,000 animals, forming a scattered train of 700 miles in length,
passed Fort Kearney in the month of May last. In this mul-
titude the strangest contrasts Avere seen ; ladies on spirited steeds,
in full Bloomer costume, or in the more modest equestrian habit
to which we are accustomed, and men gallantly mounted with
Kossuth


Kossuth hat and plume, swept by the humble pedler driving
ass or mule, and toil-worn women leading their children by
the hand. Some had their little stock of provisions strapped on
their backs; others trusted to hand-carts and Avheelbarrows.
? The journey would be pleasant,? writes one of the company,
? but for the vast number of graves along the road. There are
about eighty graves to the one hundred miles so far, that is, new
ones. The old ones are nearly obliterated, and their places no
longer known to man.? The passage depicts well the reckless-
ness with which in the States life is squandered in the pursuit
of gain. By sea the arrivals are even more numerous ; upwards
of 10,000 landed at the port of San Francisco in May, and about
an equal number in June. In the first six months of the year
10,000 Chinamen had arrived to claim part in the golden harvest,
4000 more followed in the first fortnight of July ; and eighteen
women, in the costume of the Celestial empire, had come in from
Hong Kong. The population of California was about 200,000
at the commencement of the present year ; it will be 300,000 by
its close.
Great disorders are inseparable from this amazing influx of a
mixed population into a new country. Among the diggers the
refuse iniquity of every race in the world is to be found. The
gains of many are promptly spent at the gaming-table; and
knives and revolvers are freely used in the broils which ensue.
The very nature of the grand pursuit?crowding such a con-
geries together in a narrow space and ever and anon throwing
masses of treasure into the hands of some two or three half-mad-
dened comrades, offers powerful incentives to crime. It seems,
however, that the great majority have the sense, if not the virtue,
to recognise the necessity of preserving some kind of order;
their ferocious justice restrains the reckless ruffianism which
would probably be able to defy any other force. In general,
we must add, respect is manifested for the rights of property.
The patience of the diggers has sometimes been severely tested.
In the remote districts, when intercourse with the towns has
been interrupted by the floods, provisions have risen to a most
unreasonable rate. There are instances where flour?less from
scarcity of the commodity than from the necessity of the
people?has advanced in a day or two from half a dollar to a
dollar and a half per lb. The diggers submitted to the extortion
rather than make any illegal demonstration against the store-
keeper. They hang a thief without mercy; but they never think
of hanging a baker. The monkish maxim, Lahorare est or are,
seems especially true of men who, snatched from infamous
haunts and habits, discover that it is given to them to com-
mence


mence a new and better career. It is in the diggers? favour,
let them be as bad as they may, that they must work hard to
be even moderately successful. The habit of toil is salutary;
and the speedy acquisition of larger sums than they ever hoped
to possess may be likely to convince the most hardened that they
have an interest in maintaining the law.
Wherever a rich field is discovered, a township springs up in
its neighbourhood, and the necessaries of life are now usually to
be procured on reasonable terms. San Francisco is becoming
one of the most crowded, as it is certainly one of the most
magnificent, harbours in the world. The railroad across the
isthmus of Panama is approaching completion. A rival line, in
anticipation that the traffic will be sufficient for two, has been
started; and already the sea-board of California is brought
within a month?s passage of England. A line of telegraphic
communication, of 2400 miles in length, has been decided on,
which, stretching westward from Natchez, on the Mississippi,
will reach the Pacific above the head of the Californian Gulf,
and skirt the coast to San Francisco. The coasts of the Atlantic
and the Pacific will thus be brought into instantaneous inter-
course. Years?months even?accomplish for this new country
the work of centuries; its exports already amount in value to
one-fourth the exports of the United Kingdom. The agri-
cultural capabilities appear great; the crops this summer, we
hear, are astonishing; and there is every chance that Yankee
enterprise will open other and deeper sources of wealth when
that which lies on the surface is exhausted. It is marked out by
position as a great seat of commerce. The barriers of the Ce-
lestial Empire having been fairly broken, that intercourse is not
likely to end with the passage to and fro of some thousands of
Chinese labourers. The States now possess a thousand miles of
sea-coast on the Pacific, enough to found a magnificent empire
of itself. What Venice was to the restricted trade of the middle
ages, San Francisco may probably become to the commerce of
our own and future times, ?the great medium of communication
between the East and the West, and the entrepot for the choicest
productions of both. ? The enterprise and energy of our citizens,?
says a letter of June last, ? have become a proverb. The growth
of the city is fairy-like; whole rows of good substantial brick
edifices continually being erected,? Besides English newspapers,
a French, a Spanish, and a German one have been established.
With the Californian discovery science had nothing to do. It
was otherwise with Australia. Sir R. Murchison in his latest
address to the Geographical Society reminds them that, when
he first filled their chair, in 1844, he noticed a forthcoming work
by


by Count Strzelecki on the physical geography of Australia ; and
declared that on an examination of that traveller?s collection of
rocks, fossils, and maps, he could not but recognize a singular
uniformity between the Australian Cordillera and the auriferous
Ural mountains. Two years later he received evidence of the
truth of his conjecture in some specimens of gold quartz sent to
him from Australia. Thus confirmed, he strongly advised a
body of Cornish emigrants to select Australia, and to seek for
gold among the debris of its older rocks. His advice, printed in
the Cornish papers, and transmitted to Sydney, stimulated in-
quiry, which was so far successful that in 1848 he received
several letters from persons in the colony, stating that they had
detected gold, and expressing anxious hope that Government
would so modify the law as to make it worth their while to
engage seriously in mining speculations.
In that same year, 1848, Murchison addressed a formal
communication on the subject to Earl Grey, but that statesman
did not take any steps in consequence, because, says Sir Ro-
derick, ?as his lordship has since informed me, he feared that the
discovery of gold would be very embarrassing to a wool-growing
country.? More nonsense has been written on the ? auri sacra
fames ? theme than on almost any other. It is remarked by one
of the acutest of the French novelists that money can hardly, in
one sense, be ill-spent, as it so rapidly flows from wasteful to
industrious hands. We are inclined, however, to think that the
converse is more true, and that money can hardly be ill-saved.
In its more literal sense the phrase will not better stand scrutiny.
If in any country the collection of gold is more profitable than
the rearing of sheep, we know no reason why it should not prefer-
ably be followed. We were quite unprepared for such pastoral
predilection in the Colonial Office under Lord Grey?s presidency.
To realise Arcady in New South Wales and convert convicts into
Strephons might be a very amiable conception, but would hardly
justify the minister of a great commercial empire?above all, a
zealot of Free Trade ?in an attempt to cushion rich sources of
mineral wealth opened in a colony under watch of his intel-
ligence.*
By the despatches of Governor Fitzroy we learn that it was
some time in 1849 that a formal application was made to the
authorities at Sydney to know what reward would be given for
* We believe most of our readers are aware that Murchison finally developed his
views on the Distribution of Gold throughout the Earth in an article of this Journal
for 1850. But it is due to him that we should state the fact; for, on the title-page of
an Italian translation of that article lately forwarded to us the authorship is ascribed
to Herschel?the translator adding that Sir John was rewarded for it by the Mastership
of the Mint!! !


the discovery of a gold district. The applicant was a Mr. Smith
?who produced a specimen of gold imbedded in quartz. The
reply was a very proper one, that they could enter into no blind
bargain on the subject, but that if Mr. Smith chose to trust
Government, he might rely upon being rewarded in proportion to
the value of his discovery. The Governor does not seem to have
been sorry that this answer proved unsatisfactory ; ?like his chief,
Lord Grey, he feared that gold-seeking might ? agitate the public
mind, and divert the attention of persons engaged in industrial
pursuits from their proper and more certain avocations.?
Nothing further was heard of Mr. Smith, nor of gold-finding,
?though the news from California must have been eagerly
studied until April 30th, 1851, when a Mr. Hargraves ad-
dressed a letter to the Secretary at Sydney, stating that he had
explored a considerable tract ?that he had succeeded beyond his
expectations as to gold?and that he would point out the loca-
lities on being assured of 600/. upon the truth of his represent-
ations being ascertained. This Mr. Hargraves had left Australia
to try his fortune in California?but, being struck?though Dr,
Shaw says he had no scientific pretensions with the simi-
larity of structure between the Sierra Nevada and the Blue
Mountains of New South Wales, he soon returned. To him the
reply was the same as to Smith. Hargraves prudently resolved
to trust to the justice of Government, and named the Macquarie
river with the Lewis and Summerhill creeks branching from it.
His communication was referred to the Geological Surveyor, but
he was too sharp to wait the movements of officials; he set
some labourers to dig at Summerhill Creek; and before the Sur-
veyor could reach the spot, the Government had received notice
(May 8) from the Commissioner of Crown Lands at Bathurst,
first, that several ounces of gold had been found, ?next (May
15), that a man had found a piece weighing thirteen ounces, and
that the excitement among all classes was intense, hundreds being
already on their way to the new diggings.
On the 19th the Geological Surveyor arrived there, and found
about 400 persons occupying a mile of the creek, each collect-
ing with merely a tin dish from one to two ounces daily. The
Governor felt the necessity of acting with promptitude, A
proclamation was issued, asserting the rights of the Crown to all
gold found, and a system of licensing was established:?each
licence being fixed at 1/. 10s. per month, payable in advance,
and no one to be eligible for a licence unless he could prove that
he was not absent from hired service without leave.
The town of Bathurst lies beyond the range of Blue Moun-
tains which forty years ago were thought to form an impassable
barrier


barrier to the colony on the west. When they were crossed in
1813, a wide and well-watered pastoral country was revealed;
and General Macquarie appreciated the discovery. He passed
the mountains in person, and founded the township of Bathurst,
121 miles from Sydney. The gold-field at Summerhill?promptly
christened Ophir?lies 40 miles north-west of Bathurst over a
now clear and defined road, fit for a carriage, and extending to
the verge of the settled country. By Sir Charles Fitzroy?s care,
police-stations were now established along the whole line of
road, and a government escort for the conveyance of gold was
set a-foot, the charge being one per cent, on the value.
The Government was fortunate in finding an active and intelli-
gent officer to carry these regulations into effect. Mr. Hardy,
the Commissioner appointed, arrived at the diggings on the 2nd
of June, and immediately began issuing licences. He found
about J 500 persons assembled; they were so orderly that he did
not need a single policeman, and far from offering resistance to
the payment of the licence-fee, they were glad to be placed under
the supervision of Government. Those who had not money to
pay the fee gave gold, which was received at 31. 4s. the ounce for
that obtained by washing, and 21. 8.9. by amalgamation. Each
little company had a space marked out fronting the creek, 15
feet of frontage being assigned to a party of from three to six.
Hardy by and by estimated that about 800 were working regu-
larly. The remainder were mainly old and feeble persons, who
came and went?now afresh trying their luck, and then afresh
despairing.
During June he issued 605 licences, and the earnings of the
diggers were computed at 30,000/., which would give nearly
50/. for each montldy licence.
Notwithstanding the numbers congregated, provisions were
moderate in price: meat 3d. per lb., tea 25., and sugar 6<L
The only exception was flour, which at first sold for 7 id. per
lb., but it fell in a few days to less than half that price. In
fact, the diggers were living as cheaply as they could do at
Sydney?for 10s. or 12s. per week.
On the 3rd of June the Council, to their honour be it said,
bestowed on Hargraves 500/., and an appointment as Commis-
sioner of Crown Lands. He was at the same time informed that
it would be for the Imperial Government to grant him such
further remuneration as his discovery might be thought to deserve.
Considering that gold is now produced in Australia at the rate of
at least five millions per annum, it is !o be hoped that this enter-
prising man will receive some additional reward.
By the end of May winter had set in: the nights were frosty,
VOL. xci. NO. clxxxii. 2 L and


and the small ponds covered with ice. Those persons who had
arrived without tents or clothing, hoping to pick up a fortune
in a day, were grievously disappointed at the toil and time
required to collect but a moderate quantity of the coveted
ore. Many had come on foot from Sydney ; long and wearj
as the route had been, they saw no resource but to retiace it,
and their dismal representations served to cool the excitement
which had set in. Those, however, who had been more provident
and were better fitted for the work, continued their labours with
general though by no means uniform success. Four men,
working on the slopes of Lewis Pond?s Creek, obtained one
two ounces, and the next seven. The Commissioner estimated
that at these creeks there was profitable employment for 5000
diggers: ?but they were soon to be deserted for richer ground.
The Government?s Geological Surveyor, Mr. Stutchbury, in
the course of his explorations, found that gold was distributed
over the bed of the Turon river, and much more evenly than in
other places. This stream flows, like the Summerhill and Lewis
Creeks, into the Macquarie, but twenty or thirty miles further to
the east. The watercourse of the Creeks is steep, rugged, and
narrow. The Turon runs through a spacious valley, in a broad
and level course, between much higher hills, but miles distant
on either side, and all formed of mica-slate witiiout quai iZ-a ems,
whereas at Summerhill the quartz-veins aie abundant. The
stream is without any of the abrupt elbows and nan ogorges
which mark the Creeks, and, as a consequence, the gold is more
evenly distributed and much finer in the grain. This fine gold
he found diffused through the soil ? as regularly as wheat in a
sown field ? ?but the yield was not in this part of the river
very large. It was suggested that nearer its source the ore
would turn up more abundantly, though of coarser grain, and,
trial being made, within four days three men found ten pounds
weight of gold. A thousand men were speedily congregated at
the Turon, and the average of each man seemed to be about
an ounce daily. By and by, after careful tiaiel, Mu. HaigiaAcs
reported the course of the stream to be auriferous for at least
130 miles.
Some 20 miles north of the Turon is the Meroo, another
tributary of the Macquarie, and branching from it is the Louisa
Creek. By this creek a native shepherd in the service of Dr.
Kerr discovered gold embedded in masses of quaiiz. lie struck
one of the blocks with his tomahawk, and the pure ore was at
once revealed. The gold 6 was contained in three blocks of
quartz lyin" 100 yards distant from a quartz vein. The largest
of the? blocks weighed 75 lbs. gross, and 60 lbs. of gold were
taken


taken from it. Unfortunately the blocks were broken up for
greater convenience of transit ; the largest piece of gold then
weighed 6 lbs. 4 oz. The whole mass of gold taken from the
quartz weighed 106 lbs. It was promptly taken to the Austra-
lian Bank at- Bathurst, and was subsequently seized by the
Commissioner on the part of the Crown, as Dr. Kerr had taken
out no licence, and a royalty of 10 per cent, was reserved on gold
in place. But as this was the first discovery of the kind, the
Government remitted its claims, and Dr. Kerr became the un-
disputed possessor of the 6000/. prize. It may be supposed that
the surrounding country was diligently explored ; the search
was for some time unsuccessful; but at last another lump of
gold, also embedded in its natural matrix of quartz, was dug
out from the clay, about 25 yards from the spot where the
former blocks were discovered. The weight of this lump was
336 ounces, and it was sold by public auction for 1155/. With
such prizes in the wheel it is easy to account for the restlessness
of the diggers.
The next discovery of magnitude was at Araluen, 200 miles
south of the Turon, and between 160 and 170 miles south of
Sydney. The Araluen is a tributary of the Dena river, which
empties itself into the ocean near lat. 36� S. Mr. Hardy expresses
ere long his opinion that its wide valley would prove ? the most ex-
tensive digging yet discovered Even at the present height
of the water persons can make from 1 5s, to 30.9. each per diem
Several thousand diggers would not exhaust the locality for
many years.??Other gold fields, since revealed, in New South
Wales, and some of them rich ones, have their places in the map
of the latest blue-book. They extend from the tributaries of the
Condamine and the Brisbane, in the Moreton district, on the
north, to branches of the Snowy River, in Gipps?s Land, to the
south a distance of 700 miles. But the richest were to be
eclipsed by the discoveries in the sister colony.
Nothing whatever had been known of Port Philip until 1836
when some stock-masters from Van Diemen?s Land, noting its
beautiful pastures, carried thither large numbers of sheep and
cattle. Sir Thomas Mitchell, appointed to report, termed it
Australia Felix. A town was speedily commenced on the Yarra
1 arra, and, though the site was ill-chosen as a port, Melbourne
became, almost as soon as founded, a flourishing settlement.
In 1850 the district had assumed so much importance that it was
formed into a separate colony, and the name of Victoria conferred
upon it. Here the traders and farmers were now groaning over

for the gold-fields, and, if this went on, what but ruin could be

anticipated ? To keep the people at home a meeting- was held,
and 200 guineas proposed as a reward to the discoverer of a gold-
field within 120 miles from the town of Melbourne ; nor did
they wait long before such discoveries were announced?first, at
Anderson?s Creek, only 16 miles off?next, at Clunes, on one of
the head-waters of the West Lodden, 90 miles to the north ; and
then at Ballarat, near the remarkable volcanic hill Boninyon.
Before the worth of the other diggings could be tested, the superior
richness of this field attracted all adventurers. The discovery
was announced in August last year, and the regulations adopted
at Sydney were immediately put in force by Governor Latrobe,,
hut with far less effect from the scant resources at his disposal.
The Ballarat diggings are situated near the source of the river
Lea?the richest locality being appropriately termed Golden
Point. It was visited by Mr, Latrobe, who states that it presents
superficially no feature to distinguish it from any other of the
numerous forested spurs which descend from the broken ranges
at the foot of the higher ridges, and bound the valley on either
side. Though gold is to be found in greater or less quantities in
the whole of the surrounding country, this particular point has
a superficial structure different from that of others. In his
despatch of October 10 Mr, Latrobe says :
? Roughly stated, a section of a working shows, under the superficial
soil, ?
1. Red ferruginous earth and gravel;
2. Streaked yellowish and red clay ;
3. Quartz gravels of moderate size ;
4. Large quartz pebbles and boulders ; masses of ironstone set
in very compact clay, hard to work;
5. Blue and white clay ;
6. Pipe clay below which none of the workings have as yet
been carried.?Gold has been detected, I believe, in all the superior
formations, even in the superficial soil. But by far the richest deposit
is found in the small veins of blue clay, which lie almost above the so-
called ? pipe clay,? in which no trace of the ore has been discovered.
The ore is, to all appearance, quite pure. It is found occasionally in
rolled or waterworn irregular lumps, of various sizes, sometimes in-
corporated with round pebbles of quartz, which appears to have formed
its original matrix ; at other times without any admixture whatever, m
irregular rounded or smooth pieces?and again in fused, inegulai
masses of pure metal The seams break off, and thin out, con-
tinually. The closest proximity to a rich vein can afford no certain
assurance that labour will be similarly rewarded. I however witnessed
the washing of two tin dishes of this clay, of about twenty inches in
diameter the vield of which was no less than eight pounds weight of
pure gold, and I have seen two or at most three cubic inches of the
same yield four ounces.?


Mr. Latrobe found about 2500 persons assembled; and be
says?
? One party is known to have raised sixteen pounds weight at an
early hour of the day, and to have secured thirty-one pounds weight in
one day?s work. Many parties of four men have shared, day after day,
ten ounces per man. I can testify to the fact of ten pounds weight
and upwards being the produce of a single working during one of the
days of my visit, and I have no reason to believe that this case was an
isolated one.?
The effect of this discovery was almost completely to empty
Geelong and Melbourne?neither of the towns being distant
above sixty miles. In a few weeks, however, the excitement
here, as in the sister colony, cooled down; the product, though
in particular instances larger, seems to have been less regular
than on the Turon and Araluen, and numbers returned to their
former employments. Up to the month of October the steady
workers do not seem to have exceeded 3000; ? but the discovery
of yet more productive diggings at Mount Alexander, about
forty miles north of Ballarat, and seventy-five of Melbourne,
raised the fever higher than ever.
The discovery was accidental. A shepherd found gold encased
in a piece of quartz which he picked up on his folding ground.
A careful examination showed gold in a seam of compact quartz
of about a foot in thickness. A party followed up the seam, and
in the course of a fortnight took from it, and from narrow layers of
clay in the adjacent rock, gold to the value of 300/. or 400/.
But here, as in so many other places, Nature had beneficently
spared man the labour of breaking up the rock, and had spread
out her richest treasures ready to his hand. In the bed of a creek,
descending from the Mount, and facing a junction with the East
Lodden river, gold was found abundantly diffused in the gravelly
soil. When these tidings were published people flocked, not
only from every part of Victoria, but from Van Diemen?s Land,
from South Australia?even from the rich grounds of the Turon
and Araluen. Seamen slipped from the ships in harbour, thriving
shops were shut up, and respectable men left situations of trust
to take their lot with the diggers. By December it was com-
puted that 12,000 were assembled in an area of 15 square miles.
The Governor and Council inconsiderately resolved to raise
the licence fee to 3/. per month. The diggers met to the number
of several thousands, and resolved on resistance. The Govern-
ment was in no position to enforce its act, and had to draw
back, thus affording a dangerous evidence of its own weakness
and of the diggers* strength. Mr. Latrobe complains bitterly of
the insignificant force at his disposal, and seems seriously to
apprehend


apprehend some lawless and desperate outbreak from the hordes
ol adventurers thus suddenly drawn together, JVEr. Lutrobe, in
fact, seems to have shared in the excitement of the hour, and
imagined, with the Australian papers, that the world was about to
be turned upside down. 1 here is something strongly resembling
exaggeration in the statements he furnishes of the distress of
Government from the desertion of clerks and officers. It has
been reported that his domestic servants left him en masse ,
and that he was reduced to the necessity of grooming his own
horse and chopping wood to light a fire for his
These afflictions, however, do not darken any page of his
despatches j nor, when we examine in detail the reports sup-
plied him from the heads of departments, do we find that
wholesale desertion we had been prepared to shudder over. It
is true that an augmentation of 50 per cent, was ordered on all
salaries not exceeding 250/., and that salaries of 250/. and of
350/. were advanced respectively to 350/. and 500/. Some
considerable increase was, in fact, unavoidable from the rise
in price of necessaries. The only departments which seem
seriously to have suffered are those of the police and the har-
bour-master, Governments, like private individuals, must ex-
pect to pay for labour what it is worth. These discoveries
altered the conditions of society. Those on the lowest rounds
of the ladder suddenly found themselves at the top of it.*
Able-bodied men became the most valued members of the com-
munity. It is contrary to all our notions that a policeman or a
scavenger should be entitled to as high wages as a government
clerk. Not often can the rude labour of the nervous arm assert
equality with the skilled hand or trained head. Mr, Latrobe
found it difficult to accommodate himself to the change ; and there
was some reason in the complaint of the Victorians, who found
themselves destitute of efficient protection, while a stream of
gold produced by their labour was flooding the treasury. The
large sums returned by the licensing system could hardly have been
* One stockmaster whose hands had deserted him went to the diggings to induce
them to return to shear his flocks, and made up his mind to submit to their own
terms. ?Well, master,? said the fellows, after a consultation, ?we?ll return and do the

Mighty fallen ! A member 'of the Legislative Council of Victoria was seen a few
days ago retailing apples at the diggings. Another gentleman, well known in South
Australia as an old colonist, hospitable country gentleman, and M. L. C., is now

shirt, a.nd carrying a heavy swag.? The ? ladies ? of the diggers flaunt through the
streets in the richest silks and satins the stores can furnish, while some of their lords in
their holiday excursions scorn to drink anything but champagne.
turned


turned to better account than by hiring labour at what it was
worth to preserve order, to collect the government dues, and to
form roads through districts suddenly thronged with traffic. A
liberal outlay for these purposes would perhaps have been true
economy, as from the insufficiency of the government staff thou-
sands of diggers evaded payment of the licence fee, and thus set
a bad example by showing how easily the official regulations
might be defied. The last accounts ?among others the shrewd
pages of Dr. Shaw?represent matters as mending. The police
force has been strengthened; men are not difficult to be pro-
cured when due wages are offered; the constables receive ss. 9 d.
per day and their rations ; and a commencement has been made
in the very necessary work of forming roads to the chief gold-
fields, as it was feared that necessaries might rise to famine
prices from the old paths being cut up in the winter months.
As it is, an instance is recorded of the rate of carriage from
Alexander to Melbourne being as high as 90/. per ton.
The increase in the Victoria revenue is without parallel. The
licences alone in the last quarter of 1851 yielded 25,481/., and in
the first quarter of 1852 the amount rose to 48,597/., a much
larger sum than was produced by the whole general revenue in
the corresponding quarter of the previous year. Ihe chief items
in these returns mark more plainly than any description could do
the influence which the diggings have already exercised over the
fortunes of the colony. The general revenue from customs, post-
age, &c., which in the last quarter of 1850 was 31,330/., rose in
the last quarter of 1851 to 42,041/., and in the first three months
of 1852 to 75,272/.! The crown revenue from the sale of lands,
licences, &c., which was 37,008/. in the last quarter of 1850, in-
creased to 102,307/. in the last quarter of 1851, and to 156,827/.
in the first quarter of 1852. The total revenue of the first three
months of 1851 was 49,118/., and of the corresponding period
in 1852, 232,099/, ! At this rate Victoria, our youngest child
in Australia, has a revenue about equal to the kingdom of
Saxony. We must imagine our Chancellor of the Exchequer to
be in possession of some fifty millions per quarter, when he had
only reckoned on the customary thirteen, to appreciate the for-
tunate state of the Victoria treasury, or to understand those com-
plaints of Mr. Latrobe?s inertness and of the insufficiency of the
police-force which such outrages as the robbery of the Nelson
treasure-ship call forth from the colonists.*
A rise
* The governors of the sister colonies manage to be on better terms with the people.
Sir Charles Fitzroy recently paid a visit to the Turon diggings, and was rapturously
received. Upwards of a hundred diggers, in their usual costume, met him at
dinner


A rise in the price of provisions was to be expected:?it,
however, has not been of so alarming a nature as might be antici-
pated from Mr. Latrobe?s language. The Government contracts
for 1852, as compared with 1851, show a rise in bread from l%d.
to 2i d. per lb.; fresh beef from \hd. to 'ld. ; tea Is. Id. to
Is. 4 d. ; sugar 2 id. to 2%d. ; brandy 15s. to 175., &c. The
latest reports of the Melbourne markets quote good bullocks
at 01. ss. to 4/. each?sheep Bs. to 10s.; fine Hour 255. per
cwt. These are certainly not famine prices. The charges of
retailers have, of course, risen more considerably, but will soon
fall as supplies are brought from other ports. By the enhanced
price of all manufactured articles, a field is opened for the
industry of the mother country, which, it is obvious, will not be
neglected.*
We fear Air. Latrobe is not to be taken as a safe authority
on the general earnings of the diggers. His imagination is in a
feiment on this as on other points. As a proof of 4 the wonder-
fully great yield,? he mentions that a pound weight of gold a day
is a moderate remuneration for a party; that there are instances
ol as 4 much as fifty being the result of a few hours? labour
and that 4 many parties within a very limited period have secured
forty, fifty, and even seventy pounds weight.? Among the pay-
dinner at Captain Hroomfield s. In responding to the hearty cheers which greeted
his health, we learn ? his Excellency said he could perceive that many a�warm
and friendly heart towards him was beating under the red shirt of the digger. He
further alluded to the admirable obedience and respect to the laws which had been
shown by this community under such exciting circumstances, and finally sat down
amidst a tremendous burst of applause.? Sir F. Young is not less popular in
South Australia. '1 he establishment of a mail between Adelaide and Mount Alexander
is a sign ot the excellent spirit of his government. Some of Mr. Latrobe?s regulations
appear unnecessarily stringent, as, for instance, that the escort shall take no parcels of
gold of less than a pound weight.
* At the late Sheffield Cutlers? Feast (his point was effectively noticed by Lord E.
Howard:??At the present time, when no man, not even the most intelligent?when
neither the hardworking merchant nor the greatest financial authority could tell what
was likely to be the result, or even the probable extent, of the gold discoveries, that
wonderful phenomenon that had recently occurred in the world?when in search of
that metal our most distant colonies were becoming thickly peopled?it was impossible
to doubt that the tendency of events was to open large markets for the commerce of
this country ; and he was quite sure that Sheffield would not be behind in her com-
mercial relations with those new communities, and that a market for her wares would
be found wherever the llritish name or even the foot of man had penetrated.? Other
speakeis dwelt on the Improved state of the town. One said that six years ago there
were in that borough some thousands of unoccupied houses?now they were at a pre-
mium ; and Mr. Denison asserted that the other towns of the West Hiding were more
prosperous than had been previously known; that they were accumulating wealth
more rapidly; and that comfort and sanitary improvement were increasing in an
equal ratio. The accounts from other manufacturing districts are similar; at Man-
chester ? every spindle and every loom is in full employ;? yet, according to some
economists, the gold discoveries have had no effect in producing this gratifying
change. J �

merits of gold brought down by Government escort he instances
the following:?
1 Eddy and Gill (five in company) 3008 ounces raised in seven
weeks.
? D?Arcy (four in company) 2222 ounces in eight weeks.?
This would give nearly 2000/. to each man?a product so great
as to suggest a doubt whether the whole was actually raised
by the individuals who claimed it. We are not without data
for a tolerably correct average. Taking the actual amount
shipped from Melbourne to the end of March last, and allowing
for the quantity supposed to be at the diggings and waiting ship-
ment, it would appear that about 700,000 ounces had been raised
in Victoria. At 3/. per ounce this would be worth 2,100,000/.
The licences issued up to the same date were 49,380. Dividing
the gold by this number, we get 42/. 10s, as the average
monthly earnings of each licensed digger, but as a great number
of persons evaded payment of the licence-fee, the real earn-
ings of the diggers must have been considerably less. In New
South Wales the government regulations were more strictly en-
forced. The amount raised there to the end of March may be
taken at 320,000 ounces, and the value at 960,000/, The
licences issued were 30,781, and by the same rule these figures
give 31 /. 3s, as the monthly average, which is probably very near
the truth, the most intelligent of the Commissioners commonly
speaking of 1/. per day as the diggers? earnings.
At Adelaide this golden news had not only the effect of draw-
ing away the bulk of the labouring population, but of draining
the colony of money to purchase the gold, which offered by far
the most profitable and certain investment that could be found.
While Governor Latrobe lugubriously feared that the discovery
would prove ?anything but a blessing,? and regarded with a
troubled mind the efforts of 4 the disreputable or unthinking
agitators of the day,? and 4 the language and demeanour of many
portions of the press,? to whose comments his Excellency seems
to have been needlessly sensitive, Governor Young in the
sister colony deplored the stagnation of business and the absence
of that stimulus which made Victoria so bustling. One required
that 4 a regiment at least ? should be stationed at Melbourne to
preserve order; while the other offered a reward of 1000/. for
the discovery of gold in South Australia, and made every
preparation for thankfully receiving the bright stream, even to
the issue of proclamations and the preparation of forms of licence,
whenever its sources should be opened. So eager was the expect-
ation of the colonists, that some clever hands ?as they would
be


be styled on the other side the Atlantic?attempted to secure
the reward by stratagem. They took the commissioners to some
creeks in the Mount Lofty ranges, and washing the black alluvial
soil, produced from it four small pieces of gold. ? Every portion
that was w?ashed, whether taken from the banks of the stream, or a
few yards distant from it, yielded a small piece of gold. Altoge-
ther 14 grains were obtained,? A government notice, stating
the fact, was immediately put forth, and the deputy-surveyor
was directed immediately to proceed to the spot, and ? cause plots
of ground to be measured off,? and licences to be issued according
?to the terms already published.? But?for the prudence of the
Government we are happy to say ?the notification contained a
warning that the quantity of gold yet found did not exceed two
shillings in value. A considerable number soon gathered, and
commenced digging and washing with great eagerness; but
neither by them nor by the careful researches of the commis-
sioners was a trace of gold found ; and these last could come to no
other conclusion than that the gold which had been produced in
their presence ? was not a natural deposit of the soil from which
it was then taken.? Up to the latest date it does not appear that
any gold has been discovered in South Australia, though the
geological formation of the country about Adelaide is said to be
highly promising.
One of Sir F. Young?s measures has excited much contro-
versy. To attract capital to Adelaide he established?as we
understand?an office for assaying and stamping bars of gold,
directing that it should be a legal tender at 71s. per ounce, and
that the banks should issue notes at that rate on gold deposited
with them. The immediate effects of this measure were bene-
ficial. It brought a considerable amount of treasure into the
colony, restored the circulation, and stimulated the land-sales and
the general course of trade. As the gold is intrinsically worth a
higher price, it may be held that there can be no permanent loss.
But it is difficult to understand how that policy can be good
which artificially enhances the value of gold in one government
of Australia, while it is left to find its own value in others ; or
how the banks can avoid inconvenience, as notes are issued in
Adelaide on gold at 71s. per ounce, while in Melbourne and
Sydney the rates are respectively 635. and 645. Though the
principle of the measure be sound, no attempt should have been
made to carry it out, we think, unless in concert with the other
governments.
For the convenience of the colonists it has been suggested that
a mint should be set up in Australia ; and on this subject Mr.
Watherston?s tract, as well as the Blue-book correspondence,
deserves


deserves to be well considered. It would be contrary to all
experience to expect that the same perfection could at once be
achieved in a new establishment that it has cost our mint cen-
turies to attain ; and the reputation of our coin, standing so
deservedly high all over the world, might seriously suffer
from unavoidable inaccuracy in that portion of it which issued
from Australia ; while, against the issue of a distinct colonial
coinage, there are weighty, and, as we think, decisive objec-
tions, though, of the two evils, we should esteem that the least.
Assay offices might, however, safely be established in the capitals
of the Australian colonies, and at a very trifling expense. All
that our mint purports to do, in theory at least, is to return
the gold sent to it divided into pieces of a certain weight and
fineness. Supposing that colonial assay-offices formed the gold
they received into bars of not less than a pound or half a pound,
and stamped each with its true weight and quality, they would
perform, in a manner sufficiently exact for colonial uses, what
our mint does for the general coinage of the empire. The gold
thus stamped might be made a legal tender, and form the basis
of an Australian currency, at such a rate per ounce as would
fairly cover the charges of its transmission to England.*
The gold-fields discovered thus far stretch in a south-westerly
direction from the Moreton district to Ballarat, a distance ex-
ceeding one thousand miles : the line is everywhere marked by
mountain ranges, from which innumerable streams flow into
the principal rivers. Gold is also said to have been found
in Van Diemen?s Land, though the produce has not yet been
sufficient for any judgment to be formed of the value of the
discovery. It is to be recollected that that search for gold which
has been diligently maintained in the Old World since the first
period of recorded history, and which has in the aggregate pro-
duced an amount of treasure beyond all calculation, has scarcely
yet commenced in Australia. The extent and richness of the
deposits found in the first year of inquiry can be regarded as
but specimens of the wealth which lies yet unexplored in her
virgin soil.
The encouragement which these discoveries will certainly give
to emigration from England is a very important point. It is
more than half a century since an amiable and ingenious man
* Australia will soon be abundantly supplied with coin, ? The shipments on
freight (says the Times of Sept. 13) are understood to amount to about 2,000,000/.,
and, estimating the additional sum taken out by emigrants, it is probable that the
value of the total quantity exported equals that of the gold received.? The diggers
must be largely benefited by these shipments of coin, as the gold, which in London
would realize 41. per ounce, has not always brought them 31.
tormented


tormented himself and his readers by speculations on the miseries
which would, according to all probability, overwhelm civilized
countries from a superabundance of population. We do not
remember whether any date was fixed on for the commence-
ment of the calamity among ourselves ; but as it was laid
down as a first principle that no increased production of food
could possibly keep pace with the increase of population, the
danger became more imminent year by year. Since the issue of
Mr. Malthus?s Essay our population has doubled in number, and yet
we are in this year (1852) likely to experience a scarcity of hands
for the work set before us, as a great empire, to accomplish.
What a comment does this fact supply on those daring theories,
which go to the length of questioning the wisdom and goodness
of the Almighty Creator and Governor of the Universe ?
From all our colonies in the Southern Ocean the cry is for
more people. We can send them nothing they value so highly
as labour. The settlers, without exception, see their way to new
enterprises and greater profits, if they had but more hands to help
them. In New South Wales the Legislature passed an address,
urging the continuance of immigration, and voted a sum of
100,000/. for the purpose, to be raised by loan on the land re-
venue. ? A deputation of gentlemen interested in New South
Wales,? say the Colonial Emigration Officers, ? have already waited
on us, to press for its immediate expenditure.? ? Never,? says
a Sydney paper of Ist May last, ? was labour so difficult to
procure as it is at the present time, nor do we believe that wages,
taking all classes of operatives together, were ever so high.? In
Moreton Bay labour is so needed that the people pray for a
separation from New South Wales that they may be supplied
with convicts. From Victoria 113,000/. has been sent over by
Governor Latrobe, to be spent in immigration for the present
year; and he writes that ? several gentlemen possessing property
and influence have urged, that, if emigrants could not otherwise
be obtained, paupers should he obtained from the union workhouses,
and foreigners from the continent of Europe? Sir F. Young, from
South Australia, states the general wish, 6 that the stream of
emigration at the expense of the land-fund should continue to
flow into the colony as heretofore.? Sir W. Denison, from Van
Diemen?s Land, presses that convicts may be sent out on proba-
tion, and that the whole 30,000/, voted by Parliament for emi-
gration purposes may be spent in providing passages for labouring
men and their families to that colony.
There were two obstacles in the way of these suggestions?
first, the difficulty of procuring desirable emigrants. To remove
this, the Commissioners have twice lowered their scale of
deposits,


deposits, which now stands at 21. and 3/. a head for agricultural
labourers, 1/. for women and married men, and 10s. for children.
The age for the minimum rate of deposit has been advanced
from forty to forty-five, and families with not more than four
children under twelve are admitted to a free passage. The
deposit for certain classes of artisans and mechanics and their
wives has been reduced from 5/. to 21. each. Special missions
were sent to localities where it seemed likely that emigrants
might be obtained: one, for example, to the isle of Skye and
another to the north of Ireland. As the result in great part, no
doubt, of these ? stimulating ? measures, the Commissioners have
now on their books the names of some thousands more than it
will be possible to provide with a passage. ?The scarcity of
shipping presents a second and a more serious obstacle. The
freight paid by the Commissioners in past years to the various
ports of Australia was from 13/. to 15/. per head ; this year the
contract price has risen to 17/. 19s, per adult for Geelong, and
18/. 19s. for Portland Bay. The emigration to Australia
was ?

For the later months of the year the Commissioners proposed, if
possible, to despatch ten or twelve ships a month. ?Yet even
this emigration will probably be insignificant compared with that
effected by private effort. A glance at the daily advertisements
excites amazement at the sudden extension of our commerce
in that direction. From fifty to sixty first-class ships, vary-
ing from 500 to 2200 tons, leave the ports of Liverpool and
London each month. Steamers of magnificent dimensions are
pressed into the service, and new ones, better adapted to the
length of voyage, are on the stocks. The Great Britain, of 3500
tons, sailed at the close of August, with between 600 and 700
passengers. It is computed that during the summer the emi-
gration


gration to Australia lias been at the rate of 20,000 persons
monthly.
During the last five years the emigration from the United
Kingdom has averaged 284,534 persons a year, and ?it now,?
say the Commissioners, ? exceeds the highest estimate of the
annual increase of the population.? In the second quarter of
this year there were abstracted from us ?

The births amounted to 159,136, showing a decrease in the popu-
lation for three months of 66,789 souls ! Previous to 1847 the
largest number who emigrated in one year was 129,851 in 1846 ;
last year the number was 335,966, and it appears likely that this
year it will be still greater. In last August 61 emigration ships
sailed from Liverpool, having on board 21,907 persons. The
number in the corresponding month of 1851 was only 16,714,
The amount of money sent over by the emigrants who had estab-
lished themselves in other lands, to assist the emigration of their
friends, amounted in 1851 to 990,000/. It is observed by the
Commissioners that those who depart, include a large proportion
of the youngest, the healthiest, and most energetic of the adult
population, on which the excess of births over deaths mainly
depends. In the case of Ireland we watch such an operation
without regret; for it opens the fairest prospect of relief from the
long-rooted evil of a pauper peasantry. But in England we
have no surplus of that class from which the Commissioners
pick their emigrants?men in the prime of life, of steady in-
dustry, and good character. Some apprehensions are not unrea-
sonably expressed that we shall soon feel the need?if the need
is not felt already?of those artizans and labourers whom we
aie using unnecessary efforts to send from our shores.* Emigrants
of another class we could better spare, VEe have amongst us
a superfluity of ingenious and educated men. In Australia many
such might, no doubt, find some occupation better suited to their
adventuious disposition than any they can innocently pursue at
home?and perhaps succeed in scrambling their way to fortune.
It must be confessed, however, that gold-digging is no child?s
play. ? The whole is an operation of great labour and uncer-
tainty,? writes one Sydney official; 6 it is hard work compared
with shepherding or hut-keeping, but it is not hard work to able

men,?


men,? reports another. A Bathurst paper informs us that at the
1 uron the labour is extremely heavy, and the works of an
extraordinary character; many parties have dug from twenty-four
to thirty feet deep, and some of them are actually tunnelling under
the bed of the river / Again, from Major?s Creek, ? the labour is
immense, the depth of the holes would be pronounced by Dominie
Sampson prodigious, and the constant exertion required in
pumping, diaining, &c., calls into exercise the patience and
perseverance of the most industrious.? At one spot we hear of
two men sinking a shaft 130 feet deep. The general report of
the diggers is, that they have 1 a squalid unhealthy appearance,
from exposure, privation, and dust, sore eyes being universally
prevalent.? We therefore recommend those persons here, who,
seduced by Mr. Latrobe s despatches, and by the visions of
Sofa!a and Mount Alexander, are on the point of throwing up
good situations and of engaging first-class berths for Sydney or
Port Philip, to try a little amateur digging in their suburban
gardens just to see how they relish the work. Let them mark off
a surface of 12 feet oy 20, and dig it 30 feet deep. 1 hen let
them convey the earth round their bounds a sufficient number of
times to represent the miles that must often be traversed to get
at water, and afterwards carefully wash it. Or, if they have no
fancy for dry diggings, let them turn the pipe of the New River
Company which supplies their premises, into their partially ex-
cavated ? claim,? till the water rises to the height of their chin,
and then dig, and pump, and bale until they have got to the
required depth. Let them retire from their labour at night to
sleep on the ground under shelter of a canvas tent; and?if they
find this way of spending their autumn holidays more agreeable
than a ramble through Switzerland or a sojourn on our own
coast if, moreover, they do not mind either ugly language and
ruffianly threats or ague and ophthalmia?then they may depart
and take their chance of earning 20/. or 30/. a-month by the
drudgery of a navie.
There are exceptions to all rules?and just as in our late
battles under Lord Hardinge it did not escape observation that
the most daring of the private dragoons were often English
Gentlemen of fallen fortune?several of whom in fact had once
held commissions in Her Majesty?s army ?so among the diggers,
in spite of their red shirts, Dr. Shaw?s eye at once detected a
not inconsiderable sprinkling of ? Aristocrats but, in spite of
everything, as a rule, the rough work must be done by the horny
hands. Whatever effect it may have on their condition, to them
belongs the toil and the profit. The mere superficial diggings
are rarely of much value. One experimenter says ;


? On the third morning we commenced on a bed of red marl, which
we found more difficult to work than stone ; from its close and compact
texture, it turned the points of the picks so as to render it necessary to
have them repointed and sharpened every hour. My hands soon blis-
tered to such a degree, that the blood oozed from them down the
handles of the tools. Notwithstanding the great exertions made by every
one of ,the party, some days elapsed before we got through the stratum
of red marl; and on testing it in the usual manner not a grain of gold
was obtained. When we got through the red marl, we expected that
our labour would be comparatively light to what it had been, but we
were sadly disappointed. On commencing work, we found that the
yellow marl was much harder than the red, and resembled cement. We
could only chip small pieces about the size of a crown-piece, in addition
to which it was intermixed with large pieces of quartz we had to break
before it could be thrown out; the jar of the tools was most distressing
to the hands. After a week?s hard work we got through this forma-
tion.??Hall?s Practical Experience , pp. 25-7.
After all only three or four ounces were got from this hole, and
another had to be sunk with equal labour?. On the seventh day
the blue clay was reached, and gold to the value of 415/. obtained
in a few hours. Fortunate claims are frequently sold over and
over again, the product becoming richer as the depth increases.
In California, Mr. Coke relates, ?
1 Three Englishmen bought a claim, 300 feet by 100 feet, for 1400
dollars. It had been twice before bought and sold for considerable
suras, each party who sold it supposing it to be nearly exhausted. In
three weeks the Englishmen paid their 1400 dollars, and cleared 13
dollars a day besides for their trouble. This claim, which is not an
unusually rich one, though perhaps it has been more successfully worked,
has produced in eighteen months over 20.000 dollars.?
In Australia the like trafficking in claims is common, but, from
the depth to which they are carried, they are to be considered
rather as small mines than mere surface diggings.
It would be vain, as we have already said, to attempt any
calculation of the ultimate proceeds from discoveries so recent.
Up to the first week in June last it is certain, from the actual
exports, that the total gold raised in Australia must have amounted
to about 4,000,000/. in value?and the produce was still in-
creasing. For the last week in May the government escort
started from Alexander with 37,000 ounces, but, finding the load
too heavy, left 6000 ounces behind. We have seen that the de-
posits first discovered were deserted, not from any failure of
production, but from richer fields being found. They remain to
reward later comers ; and as other tracts are explored, new trea-
sures, we doubt not, will be revealed. The number of diggers
at present, judging from the licences issued, can hardly reach
1 20,000;

20,000; at what rate will production proceed when emigrants
from England, from China, from California, flow into the ports
of Sydney and Melbourne ? It seems moderate to assume that
50.000 labourers will be scattered over the various Australian
gold-fields before the end of this year; and, taking their earnings
at?(what is for the moment below the mark) ?20/. per month?
we have a yield equal to 12,000,000/, yearly.
The total produce of California, up to the 10th of January, is
stated by Mr, Scheer at about 62,000,000/,; but his figures,
taken from a gold circular published at San Francisco, must be
much too high. From 35,000,000/. to 40,000,000/. would pro-
bably be nearer the mark. The careful inquiries of Mr, Birk-
myre, whose tables appeared in the Times of May 21, give
17,339,544/. as the amount raised last year ; he adds??
? It is confidently expected by the Americans that the recent discoveries of
very rich deposits in various districts will raise the exports for 1852 to
21,041,660/. This, moreover, is a very moderate allowance, as the
exports alone in the first three months are known to have amounted to
3.900.000 dollars more than those of the three corresponding months
of 1851.?
The main fact here is the continuous increase in the rate of pro-
duction.* The diggers now carry forward their works on a larger
scale. One of the finest pieces of gold yet raised, weighing
26 lbs., was found 60 feet below the surface. Canals are being
constructed to carry water to rich grounds, and further discoveries
are announced.
? An English company had purchased the Mount Ophir vein, and
were about to erect new and extensive machinery upon it. The miners
at Carson?s Creek, Angels, and San Andreas, were averaging 12 dollars
per day. New and valuable diggings had been discovered at Soldiers?
Gulch, Calaveras County; and exceedingly rich cayotte diggings on
the middle fork of the Yuba; shafts had been sunk to the depth of 30
feet, and as much as 115 dollars had been taken out of a single panful
of the dirt. The Bay State Company, at the Marmaduke-hill diggings,
were cutting a tunnel of 500 feet in length through the solid quartz
rock.?? Times , August 30, 1852.

With the rapid development of these new fields of supply
there appears no reason to apprehend any failure from older
sources. The yield of Russia in 1851 is calculated in Erman?s
Archives at more than 60,000 lbs. Troy. This may have been
exceeded in former years, but as it has advanced from about
13,000 lbs. in 1828 (according to Humboldt?s estimate), and as
it is likely, from the heavy duties levied by the Russian govern-
ment on the produce of private mines, that a much less quantity
is exported than is actually raised, there is no ground for
supposing that the average of some years past is materially
declining.
The produce of gold from California and Australia must there-
fore be regarded as a clear addition to the treasure of the world.
Sir Robert Peel wrote to Murchison in March 1850:
? On the 6th May, 1844, in bringing in the Bank Charter, I adverted
to the rapid increase of the annual supply of gold from mines within
the dominions of Russia, and recommended those who wished for a
diminution in the standard of value to benefit the debtor, to consider
whether their objects might not be effected by natural causes? the
decreasing relative value of gold in consequence of more abundant
supply ?without the aid of legislative intervention,?
The like argument was used by Sir Robert when he introduced
his new tariff in 1845. He endeavoured to show, by the rise in
the market price of commodities, that the purchasing power of
the sovereign was diminishing, and that a relaxation of our
import duties was justifiable on that ground. He adds, in his
letter to Murchison?
? Your arguments are powerful to show that there is no probability
(risk, I should say) of precipitate and violent disturbance. It takes a
long time and a great disproportion in the amount of supply, to affect
the relative value, throughout the world, of two such articles as gold
and silver. The united influence of Siberia and California will, how-
ever, I think, justify my inference of 1844 that there is a tendency
towards diminished value on the part of the gold. An extraordinary
increase in the supply of both gold and silver might concurrently take
place, not affecting their relative value between each other, but affect-
ing the price of all other commodities, estimated with reference to the
precious metals, and the interests of debtor and creditor.?
The views of Peel on this subject are to be taken with re-
serve. He was nervously and unduly anxious to maintain at
what he considered its due height the purchasing power of
the pound; and it is probable that in 1844-5 he mistook an
advance in prices, from local and adventitious circumstances, for
a depreciation in the value of precious metals. But, at all events,

lie is a good authority to show that, previous to the discovery in
California, there was no tendency from scarcity of gold or failure
of supply to appreciation in its relative value. The amount then
produced was sufficient to maintain a moderately high range of
prices. We do not, however, find sufficient data for determining
what that amount actually was. Mr. Birkmyre supposes that in
1846 there was raised from?
Borneo 305,900
Ava, Malacca, and other countries . . 317,519
�5,846,752
1 his total is exclusive of China and Japan ; ?but even so we
think it must be understated, as it would scarcely appear suffi-
cient to cover the consumption of gold in arts and manufactures,
its loss by wear of coinage, and its disappearance from the
various accidents of life. But though we raise the amount as
high as eight or ten millions in value, that quantity will probably
be exceeded threefold by the recent discoveries.
There are eminent men both in science and in the City who
reason that this enormous increase will have very little practical
effect; that the mass of property in the world is too vast, and the
operations of trade too extensive, and too much carried on by
mere instruments of exchange having no intrinsic value, to be
affected by the production of some extra millions, whether they
be numbered by tens or hundreds ; and that it is probable the
supplies will fail before the value of the metal can be depre-
ciated to any sensible extent. In stating the ? opposing forces,?
Mr. Scheer appears to rely most on the enormous value of the
productive property of the civilized world, which he rudely esti
mates at 28,780 millions; and his arguments lead us to infer
though we do not know that the conclusion is expressly stated
that the increased quantity of gold produced can only affect other
property in the ratio that one amount bears to another, for
instance, if we suppose the stock of gold within a limited term
to be increased by 100 millions sterling, then as 100 millions are
to 28,000, so will be the influence on prices by the increased
supply. But a little consideration will show that this reasoning
is fundamentally erroneous. In showing haw small a part is
borne by the precious metals in the shape of coined money in the
larger operations of commerce, he says?
-2 m 2 t They


* They may be found to be only measures of value , without giving
value, and we may not perhaps be far wrong in looking upon them
much in the light in which we regard other measures?the pound, for
instance, and the bushel; the greater or less number of which in use
would not alter the weight or bulk of the commodities to be weighed
or measured.?
The leading idea here is so well expressed that we wonder the
author did not perceive the riglU deduction from it. The quantity
of gold contained in a sovereign is strictly a measure the same as
a yard, a pound weight, or a bushel?and there is nothing in the
mere multiplication of these measures to affect the value of the
commodities they mete?so long as their capacities remain the
same. But if the capacities of any of these measures be altered,
then the value of the commodities will be proportionably altered,
though the measures retain their former denominations.?Sup-
posing it to be enacted that the bushel should contain twelve
gallons instead of eight, it is not to be doubted that, if wheat
were before at ss. the bushel, it would rise to Is. �d. If, on the
contrary, the bushel were reduced from eight gallons to six, wheat
would fall from s s. to 3s. 9rf. If, again, it were enacted that the
sovereign should contain only three-fourths of its present amount
of gold, is it not equally sure that the sovereign?after perhaps
some interval of plausible talk and anxious experiment?would,
instead of buying four bushels, buy only three?
Here, to some extent, the analogy ceases. The value of the
sovereign may be diminished in other ways than by diminution
or increase of quantity, which the bushel or the yard measure
cannot be. The sovereign which will purchase two cwt. of flour
here, will not purchase one at San Francisco. Practically, its
purchasing power is equally reduced by depreciation in the value
of gold from increased supply, as by a reduction of the quantity
contained in it. , .
To a ? disturbed confidence, not a contracted currency the
phrase is Mr. Johnson?s?Mr. Scheer-whom we take to be a
disciple of Mr. Tooke?s?would ascribe those panics of which
our commercial history of late years has presented so many sad
examples. He supposes that as cheques, bills of exchange, &c.,
suffice to carry on the bulk of commercial transactions,
? those masses of money tokens must exert their peculiar influences on
matters of traffic, and have their share in the prices of commodities.?
He does not attempt to show how slips of paper ? intrinsically
worth nothing? can have the influence he ascribes to them but
we can perceive a plausible and in degree a satisfactory solution
of the difficulty. These securities are to a great extent the in-
struments by which commodities are exchanged, and therefore
they


they may decide the relative value of commodities, without more
than nominal reference to their money value. They may in
foreign trade, for example, serve to exchange?not by a direct
but by a circuitous operation?cotton for tea and iron for tobacco.
In home trade the same action may take place on a smaller scale,
and through more numerous ramifications; and in this way it is
intelligible that commodities according to their scarcity or abund-
ance, or their cost of production, may adjust their relative value
one to the other, without much use of the circulating medium.
But their price in pounds and shillings?that is, their denomi-
national as distinct from their real value?their relation to gold
and silver apart from their relation to other commodities?must
have direct reference to the greater or less facility with which the
precious metals can be collected, and to the stock of them which
exists in the world.
Seeing, as Mr. Scheer does, that gold is a measure of value, we
wonder that he should lay so much stress on the amount of commo-
dities or property to be measured by it. The number of bushels of
wheat in a granary must vary according to the capacity of that
measure which we call a bushel, as the number of ounces in a bar
of silver according as we use avoirdupois or troy weight; but
the quantity of wheat, be it one quarter or a million of quarters,
or of silver, be it ten ounces or a thousand, will have no influence
on the capacity of the measure or weight. Nor, considered
purely as a measure, can the value of the pound sterling be affected
by any increase in the amount of the commodities to be measured;
but we have already stated in what respect it differs from other
measures ?i.e., that its capacity varies with the increase or dimi-
nution of gold, and by consequence with the amount of that vast
mass of property to which it bears a relative value. If the stock
of gold in the world remained the same while goods or property
increased twenty per cent., the value of the metal would become
appreciated by the disturbance of the relative proportions ; that is,
supposing there were no economising contrivances of banking, by
which the balance was in degree restored. The rule, then, for
determining the capacity of gold as a measure of value, is, not
to say: ?as 100 millions of gold increase is to 28,000 millions of
property existing, so will be the rate of advance in prices ; ?but
as the stock of gold in the world (say 300 millions) is to the
amount of existing property (say 28,000 millions) so will be the
advance in the nominal value of that property by an addition of
100 millions to the stock of gold.
When Mr. Scheer tells us that ? the precious metals are
but a small and indefinite part of the great mass of circulating
medium,? the obvious answer is that they are its entire founda-
tion ;


tion; and when he speaks of the use or waste of gold and silver
as perpetually abstracting from the superfluity and tending to
preserve the purchasing power of the remainder, it may be
replied that this loss on the increased supply can amount only to
a small percentage, leaving the remainder a clear addition to the
existing stock.
It may be argued that with greater abundance of the precious
metals there will be a greater proportion abstracted lor use in
arts; but it does not appear that this greater use is likely to
arise until that action takes place which Mr. Scheer supposes
will not occur?viz., a decline in their relative value. We extract
a pleasing passage from his Appendix:?
The progress of civilization discloses mankind under new and unex-
pected aspects. Rightly considered, it would appear that all men might
produce?and vast numbers do produce?a great deal more than they
consume; hence the vast accumulation of property. Mutual assistance,
designedly given in private or public enterprises, or unconsciously, as
in large cities or communities, further enlarges the powers of pro-
duction. Consumption, on the other hand, proceeds on different prin-
ciples. No one can eat more than one dinner in a day, nor wear out
more than two or three suits in a year. Beyond that, expenditure
implies the maintenance of others An African petty sovereign
will have his thousands of attendants, his harem of five thousand black
beauties, his herds of slaves, executioners, and the like, deemed necessary
to his regal state. In wasteful expenditure he outstrips the sovereigns
of more civilized nations. The wealth and influence of the latter are
used for better purposes, and progressively more so. Men of station
and rank now lead the way in useful enterprises. They have greater
satisfaction, we may suppose, in erecting a bridge, or constructing a
railway, than in building a palace. Such is pre-eminently the case in
England. Thus we might say, that whilst production leads towards
constant extension, consumption diverges in the opposite direction of
curtailment.? ? Scheer , p. 38.
Applying this to the consumption of gold, it seems likely
that the tendency of the age is towards economy rather than
extravagance in its use. In former times a wealthy noble might
be ambitious to possess a service of gold, to dazzle his guests
withal; but the same character now would perceive gilding to be
equally showy, and would hardly care to keep under lock and
key an amount of treasure sufficient to permanently improve
his estates, and add a considerable sum to his yearly revenue.
The exceptions are rare and ridiculed.
His calculation is that, according to the increased production
of gold in 1700-1800 over 1600-1700, the present century should
have a supply of 1908 millions sterling. But as only 445 millions
have yet been furnished, he assumes that there is?
? a balance


< a balance due of 1463 millions, which, spread over forty-nine years,
would make an annual sum of thirty millions necessary that this century
may be closed in respect to the precious metals analogous to the last.
But considering the accelerating rapidity of increase in the population,
an additional two-thirds, in round numbers fifty millions per annum,
will in reality do no more than preserve the equilibrium. As 800 did
not in the last, so 2800 millions would, probably, not in the present
century disturb the range of prices.?
The reasoning here is palpably defective; for, to prove that the
2353 millions assumed to be due to the last half of this century
would do no more than preserve the equilibrium of prices, Mr,
Scheer was bound to show that the 445 millions received in the
first half of this century failed to preserve the equilibrium. Peel,
as we have seen, held that, with the limited amount of gold re-
ceived up to 1844, there was a tendency to depreciation in its
value. Mr. Scheer has entirely overlooked that economising
tendency of our time in the case of the precious metals?and of
gold particularly?which he has himself so well shown to take
place in the general commerce of life. It is that economy which
has enabled this century to do with a much smaller quantity of
gold than might have been thought necessary. ?Mr. Scheer seems
to be aware that facts are against him:?
?We must not form our judgment on the experiences of former
times.. . .Even if precedent were to be our guide, the records of
former times are obscure ; their correctness and the inferences drawn
from them may be fairly questioned, and analogy is not to be trusted
when in our days very anomalous fluctuations of prices have run counter
to popular opinion or theoretical deductions.?
The fact that prices have greatly and universally advanced
since the discovery of America is notorious, and it is difficult to
see what other explanation can be given of it than the increased
supply of the precious metals. Mr. Scheer makes no attempt to
show how they can be excepted from the rule which regulates
the value of all other commodities. What, in effect, can become
of the increased supplies, unless greater facility is afforded to
their possession by diminished value ? It is the interest of no
one to hoard them. They become productive only by use, and,
as with all other articles, they can be brought into more general
use only by being made cheaper. Assuming that their increase
will be more rapid than that of other great products of the
earth, whether used for food or for manufactures, it seems very
conceivable that their value will decline, notwithstanding a
tendency to the cheaper production of those commodities with
which they are compared.

That the first symptom of their depreciation, a general rise in
prices, would have the effect of stimulating production, cannot
be questioned. But it would very soon be seen that that rise
was in great part delusive. It would be met by higher rates
of labour, higher prices of all the great staples of agriculture
and commerce, and higher cost of living. Though commodities,
from the wholesome stimulus of superior activity, would be rela-
tively cheaper, they might be nominally dearer; and that anomaly,
which has often puzzled mankind, would be presented of greater
abundance combined with rising: rates.
The absorbing power of the great banks of the world is sufficient
in ordinary times to preserve the equability of the precious metals,
and to prevent those variations in their value which would other-
wise probably take place with the occasional influx of treasure
or fluctuation in the exchanges. But there must be a point at
which this power of absorption ceases, and that point it seems
likely is not far from being attained. If we inquire what has
become of the increased supplies since the Californian disco-
veries, we find the stock of bullion in certain banks rising as
follows:
1848. 1852. Increase.
�17,754,398 �47,980,687 �30,216,289
If we suppose that the other banks of the world have increased
their stock of bullion in anything like the same proportion,
it is easy to understand where the produce of California has gone
to, and how it is, that being in great measure locked up, the cir-
culating medium of the world has expanded so little, and that no
very signal effect has yet been produced on prices,
A considerable addition has, however, been made to the gold
coinage of the three countries during the same period. Accord-
ing to Mr. Birkmyre?s tables:?
? The average yearly coinage of gold during the first thirty years of
this century was,?in Great Britain 1,700,000/. ; France 1,300,000/.;
in the United States 55,000/.; total 3,055,000/. The following is a
statement of the recent gold coinage in the same countries, beginning
with the year in which the gold discovery was made in California :??
Great Britain. France. United States. Total.


As our own coinage for 1851 is left in blank by Mr. Birkmyre,
we quote some details from Mr. Hunt:?
? From November, 1850, to June, 1851, the Bank of England
issued 9,500,000 sovereigns, being at the rate of 18,000,000 a year;
and so great is the demand for our gold coins, that Sir John Herschel
informs me, since November last there have been coined at the Mint
3,500,000 sovereigns and half-sovereigns, and the rate of production
can scarcely keep pace with the increasing demand.?
As the proportional increase in the circulating medium has
been far greater in the United States than in the other countries,
it is there that we should look for the greatest increase in prices ;
and accordingly the letters agree that a very great rise has taken
place there in all descriptions of property. The value of house
property has, they say, doubled in the last four years.
To assume, as several writers before us do, that there has been
no advance in prices here , because there has been no material
change in the value of silver and grain?the commodities with
which they say gold can best be compared?is by no means con-
clusive of the question. The production of silver has been for
some years increasing, and the quantity thrown on the market by
the Bank of England of late years must have had a sensible in-
fluence in checking a rise. In September, 1846, the amount of
silver bullion held by the Bank was equal to 2,710,077/., ?the
amount having been swelled by the sycee silver from China.
The amount held by the Bank on the 28th of last August
was only 18,967/. The difference, taking it at ss. per ounce,
would amount to the enormous quantity of four hundred and
forty-eight tons weight. Yet, notwithstanding the release of this
quantity and increased supplies from the mines, silver barely
maintains its relative value to gold, and perhaps, judging from
the small quantity held by the Bank, and the complaint beginning
to prevail of the scarcity of silver coin, may not do so long.
A succession of good harvests would alone have had a tendency
to depress the price of grain; but to this must be added the
abolition of all protective duties since 1849. In the absence of
data for estimating the influence of these causes in keeping
down prices, every one will form his own opinion of what rates
would probably have prevailed but for the gold discoveries.
Mr. Scheer proclaims that the bulk of the gold received by this
country has passed through it as through a sieve. A great pro-
portion of it has, of course, gone to pay for our imports from
grain-growing countries; and the question is, in what position
this country would have been placed without those arrivals of
gold ? It can hardly be doubted that grain must have ruled much
lower


lower than it has done, so as to render its importation less pro-
fitable?or that the continuous demand for bullion would have
reduced our stock even lower than it was in 1847. In October,
1848, the amount of Bank of England notes in circulation was
�17,505,718; on August 14th, 1852, it was �22,952,555, At
the former period Consols were 84; at the latter 100. It will
hardly be denied, we imagine, that the increase in the circulating
medium, if it has had no influence in directly raising prices, must
have had a tendency to prevent their depression. The amount
of gold sent to grain-growing countries must have materially
tended to keep up the price of their produce. That there has
been a rise?and a considerable rise?in the value of all kinds
of landed and house property, is a fact beyond all dispute.
The height to which public securities have risen is, however,
of itself sufficient to prove that realized property must be
advancing in value.
So far as we can at present venture to prognosticate, the supe-
rior abundance of gold will very materially lessen the chance of
those commercial panics which, since the currency settlement of
1819, have been the plague of the industry of this country.
Were the amount of bullion in the world to remain fixed, or
nearly so, our stock, by an adverse action of the exchanges, might
still be inconveniently reduced at one time as compared with
another ; but with an increased supply continually proceeding,
all apprehension of any sudden drain?of contraction of the cur-
rency ?and of restricted credit must disappear, and legitimate
enterprise will feel itself secured from those unexpected shocks
to which it was before exposed. Nor can we be sufficiently
grateful that these discoveries have come at a time when, from
the rash change in our commercial system, they were eminently
needed.
It may be argued that a general rise in prices can hardly be
regarded as -a general benefit; that to the bulk of any com-
munity the action must be wholly indifferent; and that if bene-
ficial to some it must be injurious to others. We have, however,
the fact universally established, so far as we know, that every
great advance in national prosperity has been coincident with
rising, and every marked decline with falling, prices. The
treasure of the Roman empire, which had been 358,000,000/.
under Augustus, sank to 70,000,000/. under Justinian; and it
would, perhaps, be impossible to exaggerate the misery caused
during those five centuries by attempts to maintain the exactions
imposed at a more prosperous time. It is to be observed that
industry, as a general rule, is set in motion by those who have
fixed


fixed payments to make ; and that, as those payments are ren-
dered easier or more difficult by an increase or diminution of the
precious metals, the prosperity, not only of the employers of
labour, but of all dependent on them, must augment or decline. In-
dependently of state burdens, which may even become heavier with
the declining wealth of a country, those who set industry in motion
commonly do it with other capital than their own. The farmer
rarely cultivates his own land; the manufacturer not often conducts
his business on his own premises : not one trader in a hundred can
call the shop his own in which he sells his goods. Many of these,
and of the other productive classes, trade with borrowed money ;
and besides fixed rents and taxes, have fixed interest to pay, and
other fixed obligations to fulfd. The difference to them between a
rise and fall in price to but a moderate extent, when either action
is continuous, is all the difference between prosperity and ruin ; and
it is impossible for any country, hardly for any class, to thrive on
their decline. On the contrary, those who have fixed payments
to receive constitute the luxurious rather than the productive
classes: fruges consumere nati , they must flourish, if they flourish
at all, from the industry which renders their property productive ;
the creditor or landlord can rarely suffer from the prosperity of
debtor or tenant. But when a contrary action takes place, it is
not difficult to understand how wealth may accumulate, or
appear to accumulate, from the increase of luxury, while men
decay.
Under an action by which gold becomes slowly depreciated in
value, property producing a fixed income is undoubtedly placed
at a disadvantage as compared with the property which may yield
a greater or less income according to the character of the times ;
but we do not know that this is to be regretted ; most persons
are free to choose what investment they please ; and the steadi-
ness and certainty of one class of property may more than
counterbalance the probability of an increased income from
another.
Hitherto the holders of public securities have, by the high
rates to which their stocks have risen, been the greatest gainers
by the abundance of money. Whether the rate of interest they
receive will be reduced is a point not resting with the present or
any other government, but dependent on the question what influence
the gold discoveries will have on the rate of interest generally.
Should public securities rise much higher than at present, it
would be a proof that so moderate a rate was no longer tenable,
and by that index our Finance Minister must rule his conduct.
He cannot prescribe the rate of interest which shall prevail, but
he


he may, and should, make the best bargain for the public which
the prevailing rate will admit of. Were the Three per Cents, to
reach 109, it would show that money in the funds was only worth
2| per cent., and if to 120, only per cent. In either case, a
careful Minister would have no choice but to reduce the interest
on the public debt to the marketable rate, as is commonly done
with Exchequer Bills. Or were there reason to suppose that
prices were kept down through fear of such reduction, that would
in itself be so unsatisfactory as to call for ministerial interference
or explanation. But the power of government in every case of
conversion must be limited by the necessity it is under to keep
the stock it converts at a rate equal to, or above, par. No change
can be carried out in that large portion of our debt?amounting
to three-fourths of the whole?which would have the effect of
reducing its marketable value below 100/. money for the 100/.
stock, or our Financier might find himself in the awkward predi-
cament of being called on to actually pay off the debt he only pro-
posed to convert. That the apprehension of such a change incon-
veniently depresses the Three per Cents, at present is clear from
the relatively higher price of theThree-and-a-Quarter per Cents.,
on which interest at 3 per cent, is guaranteed for twenty years
after 1854; but neither from the price of that particular stock,
nor from the general state of the interest market at this time, does
it appear that a reduction, even to the extent of one quarter per
cent,, could be attempted on any considerable portion of our debt
with a reasonable prospect of success.
We look to other sources of relief. In the expansion of our
trade, the increasing commerce of the world, the rapid growth of
our colonies, we hope to reap the fruits of this latest gift of
Providence. Whenever we see movements of great masses of
men, as lately towards California and now towards Australia, we
think we can recognize Divine design more plainly than in other
facts of history. The singular manner in which gold is spread
over certain tracts of the earth, the ease with which it can be
collected by individual effort, and the universal opinion enter-
tained of its value, seem to point it out in an especial manner as
one of the agencies by which intercourse between nations is to be
promoted, and the social condition of man raised.
