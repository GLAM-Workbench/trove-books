Some Aspects of the Star
LECTURE BY THE HON. P. M‘MAHON GLYNN, M.H.R.
(Reprinted from “The Advocate” of August 28, 1915.)
On Thursday evening, August 19, a lecture on “Some Aspects of the
War” was delivered by the Hon. P. McM. Glynn, M.H.R., at the Chris-
tian Brothers’ College, East Melbourne, under the auspices of the Old
Paradians’ Association. There was a large attendance of members and
visitors, including a number of ladies. Amongst those present were :
Rev. T. B. Walshe, Rev. N. Hoare, Messrs. A. S. Rogers, M.H.R., T.
Livingston, M.L.A., H. Sinclair, M.H.R., the Principal of the College
(Rey. Brother O’Dwyer), the vice-president (Mr. Cody), and the hon. sec.
(Mr.' A. M. O’Sullivan).
/Mr. F. E. O’Connell, president of the association, in introducing Mr.
Glynn, promised the audience an intellectual treat, the fame of the lec-
turer being known throughout Australia.
Mr. Glynn, who was received with applause, said :
In acceptance of the invitation, I
shall say something, however discur-
sive, on the cause, significance, and
probable issue of the present war.
One point should be axiomatic in its
recognition, that the question of the
comparative merits, or effect on pri-
vate or national character, of peace
or war, is not relevant now. When
war is on, the course of duty and
manliness—indeed, in the long run,
of humanity, too —is to strike hard ;
to think of one thing only—an hon-
ourable and successful issue ; while
playing the game, as nations of
honour, according to accepted inter-
national rules, to brace every
faculty to the attainment of victory;
the success of the cause of our Al-
lies and ourselves. (Applause.)
War, indeed, has its grim aspect,
its sad and sombre side, as in a
world of trial and vicissitudes most,
if not all, things, to a greater or
less extent, have. The true sense of
its brutalities is conveyed, to those
who can see and feel, in Milton’s
picture of Moloch, the universal god
of slaughter, the fiercest spirit that
fought in Heaven, ever impetuous in
counsel and bloody in action —
“First Moloch, horrid king, be-
smear’d with blood,
Of human sacrifice, and parents’
tears;
Though, from the noise of drums
and timbrels loud,
Their children’s cries unheard, that
passed through lire
To his grim idol.”
It is all there, in his sublime con-
ception and majesty phrase; but it is
Milton also that, with his unique
touch, raises us to a senSe of the
compelling glories and inspiration of
war, as when he tells us that at the
sound of the ethereal trumpet :
The powers militant
That stood for heaven, in mighty
quadrate join’d.
Of union irresistible, moved on
In silence that bright legions, to the
sound
Of Instrumental harmony, that
breathed


Heroic ardour to adventurous deeds
Under their god-like leader, in the
cause
Of God and His Messiah.
Man is a curious mixture of op-
posite elements. If he was not, he
could scarcely be the paragon of
animals; the centre of interest and
distraction, if one may rise a pagan-
ism, to the eternal gods.
But war, not philosophy, prescribes
the lines 'of duty now. Great sacri-
fices are necessary; and victory can-
not be attained without them. We
must not her guilty of what Bacon
calls the solecism of power, “to
think to command the end, and yet
not to endure the mean.” (Ap-
plause.)
The end is the success of the Al-
lies’ arms in a just cause. In the
issue, we are not likely to forget
that the power that can strike can
spare; and that it is only the vic-
tors that can be, or afford to be,
magnanimous.
THE CAUSES OF THE WAR.
No single cause sufficiently explains
the welter of forces and events. The
stream of tendency and circum-
stances that produce the national
tempers and international relations,
and the precipitating events, have to
be considered.
Nations, at times, gradually be-
come obsessed with doubts, sus-
picions, and anxieties; and there is
no neutral arbiter, or, on this side of
eternity, all-pervading and com-
pelling mind, to check trepidation or
allay their mutual fears. The in-
telligence and imagination of states-
men do not completely grasp either
the problems of the present or the
possibilities of the future. Up to
1870 Prussia, as a possible danger
or force, did not count with Britain.
There were some suspicions of
France then. The press at home dis-
quieted the public mind. There are
sections of the press that are scarce-
ly worthy of its traditions, and on
subjects and occasions subordinate
public interests to sensational effects.
The “Pall Mall Gazette,” for in-
stance, which about then was edited
by a Frank Harris, a writer whose
patriotic solicitude has since changed
its objects, for he has just published
an apology for Germany, denounced
Germany in 1897 and France in
1900.
“That the French Government,” it
wrote on August 22, 1900, “is pre-
paring for war, there can be no
longer any doubt. From every bar-
rack-room round Paris that boasts a
rifle range comes the sound of rifle
practice. The huge imports of steam
coal to be stored in the north of
France tells the same tale,” etc.
A few years later the same paper
spoke again of a German menace.
Scares come and go. In January,
1905, Germany was scared ; thought
we were about to declare war to
prevent development of her navy.
However, on the occasion of King
Edward’s visit to Germany on 9th
February, 1909, the possibility of an
understanding was professed, for the
Berlin “Tageblatt” wrote ; —“The
monarchs clasped hands. The peoples
can do nothing better than follow
this example, and call across the sea,
‘Let us be friends.’ ” Then the
“Germania” wrote :—“lf Germany
and Great Britain hold together in
the general determination to keep the
general peace, no other power in the
world will dare to disturb the
world’s peace.” But the growth of
armaments went on. President Taft
said, in March, 1908; “With all na-
tions of the world armed and pre-
pared for war, we must be ourselves
in a similar position to prevent
other nations from taking advantage
of us.” In 1878, 1885, 1899, etc.,
we were on the point of war with
Russia. The past clearly has its
lessons of balance and vision, and
teaches the necessity for that modest
doubt which is called “the beacon of
the wise,” and the responsibility of
those in a position, by speeches and
writings, to affect the public mind.
More light is required. Take the case
of Russia. How few, until this war,
realised the moral and material
greatness in many respects of Rus-
sia ! Yet, in literature, music, and
in social and its own religious life,
our ally is unique and intensely na-
tional. Tolstoi was, in some re-
spects, one of the greatest forces of
the centuries. The Norse, the Tar-
tar, and the Slavonic elements of
character were there to account for
many apparent inconsistencies of
moods and methods. Reform was a
matter of date. There were few na-
tions that had not their periods of
class dominance and oppression. But
‘the emancipation of the Serfs in 1861
antedated the agrarian reforms of
some more western countries. There
was a new spirit abroad, which
would have its hour and its applica-
tion.


REMOTE CAUSES OF THE WAR.
One of the remote causes of the
war was the ignoring of nationality
in the delimitation of Europe after
Waterloo. The diplomatists who
framed the treaty of Vienna were af-
fected by the old territorial tradi-
tions, and the so-called dynastic
rights of kings. Some years later,
Chateaubriand, in his “Congress of
Verona,” condemned the basis of
settlement, and foretold interna-
tional possibilities that have been
realised in the events of more recent
times. The larger part of Europe,
it has been well said, was left a
chaos of divided peoples, imperfect
States, and subject nationalities.
From the revolutionary outbreaks of
1848 to the present war, the strug-
gles of subject or discordant races or
nationalities was a result. Besides,
nineteenth century Continental Im-
perialism—the Imperialism of ad-
ministrative compression rather than
of organic affinity—ignored nation-
ality. The problem of our day, of
reconciling empire and nationhood,
local autonomy, and central unity,
had not been faced, except to an ex-
tent in the British dominions.
WHAT IS A NATION ?
What is a nation, is not easy to
define. Nationality does not de-
pend on blood or race alone. These
are the chief causes of likeness of
feeling and character; but unity of
relations, of history, the fellowship
that arises from environment, from
the ups and downs of fortune borne
in common; similarity of outlook
and community of interest that come
from associations and with time, all
contribute to the national sense. He
need scarcely remind them of the as-
similative power of the Celt; of that
voluntary acceptance of, or adapta-
tion of, an attractive type, through
which some settlers beyond the Pale
in time became more Irish than the
Irish themselves. French insight,
sympathy, and sociability had the
same effect. “Nation,” said Burke,
“is a moral essence, and not a geo-
graphical arrangement, or a denomi-
nation of the nomenclator.” The
histories of Poland —the names that
brought back the romance of one’s
boyhood—of Ireland, and of Serbia
showed the working and persistence
of the national spirit. It was this
sentiment that inspired Grattan’s
apostrophe to the Irish Parliament
of his time. “You not only possess
an unconquerable force, but a cer-
tain unquenchable fire that has
touched all ranks of men like a
visitation.” It was the same sense,
whether expressed in the vision of
the past, reflected through Moore’s
poem beneath the waves of Loch
Neagh, or through Enoch Arden’s
emotion, when, after years of ab-
sence, he approached the white cliffs
of his native land, and
“Drew in the dewy morning breath
of England
. Blown across her ghostly walls.”
The intensity of Serbian national-
ity and patriotism is suggested by
the proverb, “Imprison a Slav idea
in the deepest dungeon of a fortress,
and it will blow up the fortress in
order to get out.” (Applause.) He
might be excused if, on the question
of nationality, he quoted Sidney
Low’s preface to “The Spirit of the
Allied Nations” :
“And one may suggest that it is
usually something personal, con-
crete, exquisitely intimate and real.
Some village asleep in the sunshine
of an English June, with rose-em-
bowered porches and whispering
elms; some surf-whipped beach in
Finisterre, where the dim lights from
the cottage windows cross the lan-
terns of the fishing boats in the bay;
some huddle of grey towers and
brown roofs at the foot of a vine-
clad hill above the reaches of the
Rhine; such, one may suppose, is the
picture that the last sigh for Eng-
land or France or Germany will
evoke; this, and with it all these
things bring back of love, friendship,
childhood, home, and work.”
Its significance was felt also in the
lines of Rupert Brooke, who had
perished in his prime, but at the post
of duty in the Dardanelles :
“If I should die, think this of me:
That there is some corner of a
foreign field
That is forever England.”
IN THE BALKANS.
For thirty years there has been a
struggle of races —about 10 £ mil-
lion Slavs under foreign rule against
Austro-German-Magyar ascendancy.
An essential principle of the law
of nations is that no power can
liberate itself from the engagements
of a treaty or modify the obliga-
tions thereof, unless with the con-
sent of the contracting parties.


In breach of this, Bosnia and Her-
zegovinia were annexed by Austria in
1908. Servia then looked to Russia.
In March, 1909, the Kaiser intimated
to the Tsar that if war ensued, Ger-
many would support her ally.
Then came Sir .Edward Grey's de-
mand for a conference, supported oy
France and Russia, which was re-
fused by Germany.
Austria-Hungary precipitated the
war; yet Redlich claims that it in-
corporates a great and a new prin-
ciple of State life —the modern ex-
pression of nationalism in the shape'
of the fusion of many peoples, under
the principle of equal rights, in one
great State.
ANOTHER CONTRIBUTING
CAUSE.
Another contributing cause is the
materialisation of the German Em-
pire.
It is not transformation; rather
the application of old energies and
ambitions to new enterprise and oc-
casions.
Notwithstanding Mozart, Bee-
thoven, Goethe, Schiller, Jean Paul
Richter, and others, the historic tem-
per of Germany was warlike and ag-
gressive. It was a mixture of op-
posites, of complimental qualities,
for nature is dual.
Voltaire said that ‘‘France had the
empire of the land, England of the
sea, and Germany of the air.” But
in the past Germany was more than
a land of philosophy and dreams.
Tacitus and Gibbon speak of the
Germans’ contempt of the laziness of
peace, their desire to acquire more
than renown through voluntary dan-
gers. The sound that summoned the
German to arm was grateful to his
ear.
‘‘To solicit by labour,” says Gib-
bon, ‘‘what might be ravished by
arms was deemed unworthy of the
German spirit.”
‘‘Their climate, their want of
learning in arts and laws, their no-
tions of honour, of gallantry, and of
religion, their sense of freedom, im-
patience of peace, and thirst of en-
terprise, all contributed to form a
people of military heroes.”
RESURRECTION.—AFTER JENA,
1807,
‘‘Prussia is done for,” said Na-
poleon: ‘‘she has disappeared from
the map of Europe.”
Then came the war of liberation,
Elba, and Waterloo.
Niebuhr, in 1910 made Professor of
Ancient History in the Berlin Uni-
versity, wrote his Roman history to
inspire through the noble examples
of antiquity. "I went back,” he
said, ‘‘to a nation, great but long
passed by, to strengthen my mind
and that of my hearers. We felt like
Tacitus.”
“In short,” writes Antoine Guil-
land in ‘‘Modern Germany and Her
Historians,” ‘‘it seemed necessary to
him to bring before the eyes of the
German people, who had no country
or state of history of this people,
who had been the model of national
development.”
After Jena, resurrection was
sought through regeneration of
Prussia. It was the first German
State to make education free and
obligatory. Its universities aban-
doned Latin for German. Not until
about the middle of the 19th cen-
tury did it change its mission to
militarism.
‘‘There were at that time,” says
Guilland of 1810, “a number of Ger-
mans in the Prussian service at Ber-
lin —Baron Stein from Nassau, Prince
Hardenberg and Major Scharnhorst
from Hanover, Gneissnau and Fiechte
from Saxony, Niebuhr from Schles-
wig-Holstein. Others were still com-
ing in. And they all recognised at
the same instant the same truth —
‘We must regenerate Prussia for the
salvation of the whole of Ger-
many.' ”
Ranke, about 1848, marks the
change. ‘‘The true destiny of Prus-
sia,” said he, ‘‘is to be and to re-
main a military monarchy.”
Treitschke later wrote that ‘‘the
historical roll of Prussia had begun
in the day when that power incor-
porated, one after another, those
German States whose death knell
they had sounded.”
Treitschke was born in 1834, and
died in 1895. He preached that the
essence of the State is power; that
power is moral; so that the autho-
rity of the State over the individual
is supreme and without appeal. He
challenged the moral right of the
British to empire. Treitschke and
Bernhardi say that Britain is the
one nation that blocks the way of
German Imperialism.
Houston Stewart Chamberlain,
born in 1855 at Southsea, wrote
•‘Foundations of the Nineteenth
Century,” the story of the
rise of thought, of religion,


of learning, of civilisation, of
art ; the story of all those ele-
ments of which the complex life of
the Indo-European of to-day is com-
posed—the story which he calls “Dei
Germane.’’ It comprises Kelts, Ger-
mans, Slavs —all northern races from
which the people of modern Europe
have sprung. The Jew he calls the
witness of the past, the Teuton the
power of the future. The Teu-
ton was the central driving
force of what he called the
Germane elements. The Batin
races, according to Chamberlain,
were degenerate. Possibly the
war would open his eyes, or modify
his views, as to the comparative
vitality and decadence of races. But,
to sum up his position. The Homan
was the past master of policy, of all
that contributes to the pros-
perity and welfare of the State. Af-
ter the symptoms of the decay of
Rome there was a welter of nation-
alities, in which Greeks and Romans,
Syrians, African mongrels, Armeni-
ans, Gauls, and Indo-Europeans of
many tribes were all jumbled up to-
gether—a seething, heterogeneous,
conflicting mass of humanity, in
which all character, individuality, be-
lief, and custom were lost.
“In this witches’ Sabbath,’’ to
quote from Bord Redesdale’s preface,
“only the Jew maintained his indivi-
duality, only the Teuton preserved
the two great characteristics of his
race, freedom and faith —the Jew the
witness of the past, the Teuton the
power of the future.”
OUR PRESENT POSITION.
The present appeal to the manhood
of Australia is a reminder, rather
than a remonstrance; an intimation
that after twelve months of war,
with Russia pushed back in Galicia,
Przemysl won and lost, and War-
saw, the heart and capital of Rus-
sian Poland, taken by the enemy ;
with a deadlock in the West; Galli-
poli still held by the weight of Turk-
ish forces and German audacity and
cunning, we must prepare for that
pressure of men and materials which
such an Empire can supply, and
which alone can assure us the final
triumph, (Applause.) It is the
moment now 7 for unity and effort; for
bracing all the energies of the Em-
pire to the success of the cause of
ourselves and the Allies. We have
many memories and many motives
to inspire us. First, there is the
pledge of honour and the obligation
of duty to Belgium. Belgium was
bound by a treaty, to which the Em-
pire was a party, to neutrality. To
preserve her territorial integrity was
our interest, as well as duty. She
was prohibited from forming al-
liances, and bound to resist the pas-
sage of troops to belligerent coun-
tries. The treaty of 1889 was re-
newed by the assurances of 1870,
which declared, and professed to as-
sure, her neutrality and integrity.
The ambition of a Napoleon was the
menace then. The growth of Prus-
sian power after Sadowa made
France anxious. “It was in Bel-
gium,’’ said McDonnell, “that
France, irritated to see her
pretensions to the European suzer-
ainty ruined by the growth of a for-
midable political and military op-
ponent, sought a fresh outlet.’’
At Sedan, the question of invad-
ing Belgium to gain Bille, by march-
ing through the frontiers of Namur
and Hainault, was ruined. Glad-
stone, in 1870, asserted the indepen-
dence of Belgium against all comers.
He knew what the people would say
if the Government stood quietly by
and witnessed, as he said, “the perpe-
tration of the direst crime that ever
stained the pages of history, and be-
came a participator in the sin.” It
was this which gave such signific-
ance to the appeal of the King of
Belgium, twelve months ago, to the
diplomacy and intervention of Eng-
land. The words of the soldier King
may well be recalled :—“Remember-
ing the numerous proofs of your
Majesty’s friendship, and that of
your predecessors, and the friendly
attitude of England in 1870, and the
proof of the friendship you have just
given us again, I make a supreme
appeal to the diplomatic interven-
tion of your Majesty’s Government
to safeguard the integrity of Bel-
gium.” (Applause.)
“If the obligations of honour and
interest had been ignored, I doubt,”
said Sir Edward Grey, W‘whether
whatever material force we might
have at the end w 7 ould be of
much value in the face of the respect
which we w r ould have lost.”
Well, Belgium is still to be saved.
As the vicarious victim of the over-
weening ambition and ruthless, and
for the moment effective, power of
one nation, and the anxieties, jeal-
ousies, and short-sighted statesman-
ship of others, she calls to us with a
compelling voice and pathos that to
men of honour, and to all interested


countries that value a reputation for
decency, should prove irresistible.
It is only defective imagination and
sympathy that could permit the great
neutral countries of the world rally-
ing around her with the full weight
of their moral influence and material
resources.
Next are our obligations to France,
Russia, and Servia —the protagonist
of the Slav elements in the Balkan
States.
Let me refer to the significant
words of Sazenoff, the Russian Fo-
reign Minister, a few days before the
war. He said he assumed that
England would not delay definitely
to take its stand by the side of Rus-
sia and France, “in order to pre-
serve the equilibrium of Europe,
which has been continuously shaken
in the past, and which will be un-
doubtedly destroyed in the event of
an Austrian triumph."
Both these great Allies have re-
sponded with appalling sacrifices and
unmistakable resolution. (Applause.)
Russia’s lines are for the moment
broken and her armies pushed back ;
but her spirit is intrepid and her re-
solution firm. (Applause.)
France did marvels at the Marne.
The check administered by Joffre on
September 6 to the triumphant
march of the German invaders is one
of the feats of history.
Listen to his order of the morn-
ing : —“At the moment when a bat-
tle on which the welfare of the coun-
try depends is about to begin, it is
my duty to remind you that the
time for looking behind is gone. We
have but one business in hand —to at-
tack and repel the enemy. An army
which can no longer advance will at
all costs hold the ground it has won,
and allow itself to be slain where it
stands rather than give way. There
is no time for faltering, and it will
not be suffered." (Applause.)
That was the voice of destiny.
Still, her most industrial provinces
are in the hands of the enemy.
France is now, as ever, the home of
heroic enterprise and manly senti-
ment —the nation, as Burke said, of
gallant men, of men of honour, and
of cavaliers. (Applause.)
All her myriad moods and voices
of the times of peace now respond to
the inspiring strains of the “Marseil-
laise," and sweep in full concert and
diapason towards a redeeming and
triumphant close.
Italy, also, is at full tension and
strain.
Nor must we forget that the rights
of smaller nations are at stake —
those nations to which most of what
is best in civilisation is due.
THE HAGUE CONVENTION
VIOLATED.
There is also the moral elements
involved. We are at issue with an
armed doctrine; with a military
caste that would supersede morality
by might, that would impose its
primitive notions of right and
wrong, its so-called Teutonic cul-
ture, upon the rest of Europe, and
base gradations of rank and merit
for the future on the sole supremacy
of the sword. The temper of the
enemy is reflected by Clausewitz,
who said, “War is an act of violence
which in its application knows no
bounds."
Germany broke three chief articles
of the Hague Convention. No gene-
ral penalty, pecuniary or otherwise,
can be inflicted on the population on
account of isolated acts for which
it cannot be regarded as collectively
responsible.
The Hague Convention resolutions
were broken first at Liege.
Germany did not subscribe to the
Hague resolutions in all parts, but
did to three out of four of the De-
clarations of 1899.
The third declared —“Countries en-
gaged in war to abstain from the
use of loro ject-ilcs the sole object of
which is the diffusion of asphyxiat-
ing or deleterious gases.”
The Hague resolutions also con-
demn killing or wounding treacher-
ous^.
Frederick the Great’s saying that
“one uses alternately in war the
skin of the lion and the skin of the
fox —cunning frequently succeeds
where force fails," seems to be a
guide to action.
RESPONSIBILITY FOR WAR.
Austria’s despatch to Berlin, “to
entertain the proposal of Sir Ed-
ward Grey to negotiate between us
and Serbia," was concealed by Ger-
many on July 31, 1914. Russia had
promised to maintain a waiting at-
titude.
Between the nations it is now a
case of the survival of the fittest.
“Straight let us seek, and straight
we shall be sought," says the Bas-
tard in “King John" ; and with him
we can declare of that greater Eng-
land, the Britain of twin islands at


the centre and of the remotest seas,
for which it still remains to find an
appropriate name, that —
This England never did (nor never
shall)'
Lie at the proud feet of a conqueror,
But when it first did help to wound
itself,
Now, when the princes are come
home again,
Come the three corners of the world
in arms,
And we will shock them. Nought
shall make us run.
Tf England to itself do rest but true.
(Applause.)'
ECONOMY IS NECESSARY.
Great Britain’s gold percentage is
low, because as yet we export gold
as freely as wanted, but her credit
is absolute. A banker says ;
“Every pound’s worth of food wast-
ed, of meat, petrol, rubber, tobacco,
or any other material which we can
economise, unnecessarily consumed,
means a pound’s worth more import
and a pound more in the bill against
us. We should import only absolute
necessities, and produce everything
in the country we possibly can.’’
Peace is apt to produce over-con-
fidence, and a sense that its continu-
ance is inevitable.
Long enjoyment of prosperity, and
immunity from invasion, leads us to
suppose that we are exempt from the
possibility of disaster and the stroke
of the eternal powers. But neither
Providence, nor Nature, His instru-
ment, is partial, or applies the prin-
ciple of preference to nations.
IMMORTAL GALLIPOLI.
Gallipoli has memories that teach
us how transitory is the greatness
and security of even the proudest
empires. (Applause.)' Dynasties
perish before the written word. The
romance of Tom Jones, said Gibbon,
“that exquisite picture of human
manners, will outlive the palace of
the Escurial and the Imperial Eagle
of the House of Austria.” Rut no
people can ever perish who are true
to the saving temper; to the gifts of
intellect, energy, and opportunity,
with which, in adequate measure, a
paternal and just Providence has en-
dowed the least, as well as the great-
est, of men and nations. Energy,
self-sacrifice, and devotion protect
and preserve; it is degeneracy alone
that is the death of a nation. (Ap-
plause.)'
I have spoken of General Joffre
and the push-back of the Marne.
France, the country of impulses and
vicissitudes, is still France after a
thousand years of developing, and,
for the main part, of chequered life;
she is still her romantic and, in the
long run, unconquerable self, because
in prosperity and in depression, in
the zenith of her greatness and her
glory, as well as in the most dis-
turbed or torpid moments of her
varied history, she has ever quick-
ened to new energy and inspiration
when, through the instruments, how-
ever humble, of the Divinity, the
voice of duty and of patriotism was
heard. (Applause.) From all her
children alike, when national inde-
pendence was threatened, there was
ever the same response to the one
clear call. Let me bring back to
memory, for it may renew our vig-
our and enthusiasm, two of the
daughters of France who, in life and
in death, had the saving devotion
that we, who respect purity and
self-sacrifice, may yet learn to emu-
late to-day. Let me recall what De
Quincey said of one—his tribute to
the noble Charlotte Corday—“That
in the bloom of youth, that with the
loveliest of persons, that with hom-
agewaiting upon her smiles wherever
she turned to scatter them —homage
that followed those smiles as surely
as the carols of birds, after showers
in spring, followed the reappearing
sun, and the racing of sunbeams over
the hills —yet thought all these
things cheaper than the dust upon
her sandals, in comparison of deliv-
erance from hell for her dear, suffer-
ing France.” (Applause.)
THE MAID OF ORLEANS.
Well, there is another whose mes-
sage and example are still potent
after the lapse of nearly five hundred
years, and whose memory seems to
chasten and to invigorate the sons
and daughters of Prance in this the
hour of their trial and
glory. None of us can ever forget
the shepherd girl of Domremy, the
pure and ardent Maid of Orleans. At
this stage the lecturer quoted M. de
Leseure’s fine tribute to the Maid of
Orleans. “Truly,” says an observer
of the temper of France at this
hour, “Joan has come into her
own; and after the last ten months
there is not a saint in the calendar
who stands near her in the love and
pride of Frenchmen, and Englishmen
too. There is never a church so


poor that it cannot afford the mailed
figure of the Maid, Other statues
may go lacking in offerings,' not
hers.”
Well, a people who, in the extreme
hour of suffering and endurance, but
of never wavering purpose, can turn
for refreshment of body and mind,
for faith and vigour and inspiration,
to the memories of such heroic and
unselfish souls; who can find energy
and resolution in the records of
lives that, how T ever lowly in birth,
were exalted in patriotic enthusiasm,
are not likely to fail or falter be-
fore the end that redeems and
crowns. (Applause.) And what
better can we do than apply in ac-
tion the valorous and defiant w 7 ords
of the President of the French Re-
public in the darkest days of his
country’s fortunes ? :—“A nation
which is determined not to perish,
and in order to live recoils before
no suffering or sacrifice, is sure of
victory.” . (Applause.)
If ours is to be the issue and the
triumph; if with the Allies is to be
the moulding of the future, we must
assert to the utmost, and maintain
to the end, those virtues and quali-
ties that are the secret of Imperial
prestige and integrity, and which
enable us to make light of every per-
sonal and national sacrifice, however
great or vicarious, upon which the
redemption of Europe depends. (Pro-
longed applause.)'
The necessarily serious nature of
the subject Was relieved at times by
flashes of humour, which were great-
ly appreciated.
