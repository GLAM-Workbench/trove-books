The fir§t building having been demolished in 1816, in the follow-
ing year a permanent church, known as Christ Church, was
erected on the same site, and in 1847, by Royal Charter,
became the Cathedral Church of the Diocese of Newcastle.








In 1820, owing to signs of weakness in its con§lru6lion, the lofty
spire was pulled down and a simple bell-cote erected in its place.
Thus the Cathedral remained, without much alteration, until 1884.








In 1884, the old Cathedral building showing serious signs of
weakness, a large hall was built on the opposite side of the road,
to serve as a Pro-Cathedral while the new Cathedral was being
ereEled Owing to miscalculations as to coSls, law suits, etc., after
the foundations of the new building had been placed at a coSl of
£6OOO, all work ceased for six years. A new effort was mads to
complete the building in 1891, but after £13,000 had been spent
on the superstructure, work again ceased until 1900








Much of the internal fittings of the old Cathedral was used for
the furnishing of the Pro-Cathedral. This building had a seating
capacity of about 600.








In 1902 the half-built walls of the nave of the new Cathedral
were roofed in and this portion of the building dedicated for Divine
service on November 21§l, 1902.








A temporary wooden chancel was ereSted between the north and
south transept, which served until 1909.








In 1909 the permanent chancel was completed, except as to
height, and spacious veSlry accommodation provided.


Epil|l






The length of the Cathedral, including the chancel, is now 205 feet.








The chancel alone measures 62 feet




p
it




In 1912, this year being the centenary of the erection of the first
church, the whole of the chancel was completed by raising the
walls to their proper height, and the erection of a permanent
roof and great east window.

The Chapel of St. Nicholas, situated in the northern transept,
was dedicated in 1909.








In November, 1910, the Lady Chapel, known as the Bishop
Tyrrell Memorial Chapel, was completed and dedicated.








The pulpit was rebuilt in 1909 and placed on a stone base.
The central figure is that of Our Lord; on the left are figures
of Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel, and on the right figures of SS. John
the Baptist, Peter and Paul. The figures were completed by
December, 1912.

sites in Australia, when completed, will be worthy of the Australian
Church.

The Bapistry is situated in the north-west comer of the Cathedral,
and is probably not excelled by any other in Australia.
