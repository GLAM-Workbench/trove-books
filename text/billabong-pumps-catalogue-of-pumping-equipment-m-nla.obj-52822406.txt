Notes on Pumps
1. TO GIVE SATISFACTION, a pump must be suitable for its duties
and properly installed.
2. THE SUCCESSFUL ACTION of a pump depends, firstly, on the
suction pipe joints being absolutely air tight.
3. TOTAL SUCTION HEAD should never exceed 20 to 25 feet. This
may be computed by adding together the vertical height from
lowest summer water level, to centre of pump and the friction
in the suction piping.
4. HORIZONTAL SUCTION PIPES when necessary should always
fall from the pump; all air will then pass upwards. When this
is not convenient, care must be exercised to see that there is
no chance of air lodging along the top of the inside of piping.
If this may occur it is absolutely essential to fit cocks so that
all air may be allowed to escape. When different sizes of
horizontal suction piping are used, air cocks are generally neces-
sary. The shorter the suction piping, the greater the efficiency.
Never use elbows, and as few bends as possible. When con-
venient, keep piping underground to avoid frost,
5. A FOOTVALVE and strainer are in all cases recommended.
6. DELIVERY PIPES should not be of less diameter than half the
bore of the working barrel, and, if of considerable length,
larger than this. If delivery pipes are of small diameter, great
friction is caused, and much more power than necessary is re-
quired to work the pump.
7. STATIC HEAD. —This means the height the point of discharge
is above the level of the water being pumped.
8. FRICTION HEAD is the term applied to the resistance caused
by the friction of the flowing water against the pipe interior.
This friction cuts down the effectiveness of the power used, and
should be reduced as much as possible. A small pipe offers more
friction to a given flow of water than does a larger pipe. There-
fore, pipes, of large diameter, and with few bends, are more
economical, in the end, as less power is required to pump
through them.

A popular Pump for Cisterns and
Shallow Wells. The base is secured
to cylinder by lugs and setscrews, which
allow the spout to be turned in any
direction. Not supplied with Nut and
Tail.
Duplicate Parts listed on page 3.
Vertical Suction Lift—from water to pump—should not exceed
25 feet.
The American gallon is I/6th less than the British Imperial gal-
lon. A pump throwing 420 gallons per hour based on the U.S.A.
table will only throw 350 British Imperial gallons. U.S.A. tables
are much in use throughout Australia. The capacities in this cata-
logue are shown in both British Imperial and American gallons.

Abyssinian Tube Wells
W \
This illustration shows an Abyssinian Tube
Well plant, complete with pump, piping and
fittings. The Driving Point seen at bottom of
Bore is illustrated and described below.
Where possible and practicable, these plants
offer exceptional advantage—they can be
easily and quickly installed, they do away
with the necessity of digging a well, and the
cost is small.
Although a pump will raise more water
when placed over an open well, many
Abyssinian Wells successfully yield hundreds
of gallons of water daily.
The limited depth for an Abyssinian Tube
Well is 25 feet. Beyond that depth this type
of well is not practicable.
Driving Point

Codeword—Padders.
The 5105 Driving Point is
made of galvanised wrought
iron tube and drilled. It is
then covered with brass
gauze and jacketed with per-
forated brass. The octagonal
point, which is of solid cast
iron, is securely riveted to
body, and is sufficiently wide
in the shoulder to ensure
ample clearance for pipe fol-
lowing.

KEROTIN
SPRAY
PUMPS
MADE WITH
GRADUATING
OR
ORDINARY
NOZZLE
The Kerotin has been a popular spray pump throughout Australia for many
years. From time to time improvements have been made, and now we claim it
is without a peer for length of life, efficiency and low price. This handy little
pump is made of Brass throughout. It is fitted with Ball Valves, and the Air
Chamber is our New Type, with air retaining tube. The Kerotin is sent out with
3 feet of strong detachable hose, armoured at pump to prevent kinking, fitted
with a 6 inch brass director. The rod and plunger can be withdrawn through
the air chamber by unscrewing nut A. The Kerotin discharges a continuous
spray, and is an ideal pump for small orchards and the flower garden, for apply-
ing lime wash and disinfectants to fowl runs, cattle sheds, etc. The iron and
brass footrest makes the pump suitable for use with standard size Kerosene tin
or ordinary bucket.
The “Kerotin”
Air Chamber.
The illustration of the Kerotin’s Unique
Air Chamber shows how air force is produced
by confining the liquid (B) and compressing
the air cushion (A), ensuring an evenness of
spray under all pressures.

The Billabong Double-
Acting Piston
Pump
With Fast and Loose Pulley for
Petrol Engine or Other Belt
Drive.
Fig. 5201.
Codeword—Paralepsis.
Made for elevations up to 250
feet, Head or Equal Pressure.
The “Billabong” Double-Acting Piston Pump is made at our
own works. Only expert workmanship and good quality materials
enter into its construction.
The “Billalbong” combines ample power and large capacity in
most compact form. The Base, Cylinder, Bearings, and one Cylinder
Head are cast in one piece—ensuring the alignment of Gearing, and
giving an unusually rigid construction.
It is specially adapted to meet the demand for a medium-priced
power pump to be operated by kerosene or petrol engines, or other
belt power.
The Piston is made of high-grade carbon -steel, and the Piston
Rod is brass cased. Gears and Pinions are machine cut from the
solid. The Cylinder is brass lined, and the rubber valves are seated
on brass. Bucket leathers are cup-shaped. Suction may be taken
from either side, and delivery in four different directions.
Geared 5 to 1. Revolutions per minute, 200. Speed of Crank
Shaft, 40.
B.H.P. is that required at Pump Pulley, and expressed in terms
not less than % BH.P. Efficiency is taken at only 60 per cent.

as one of the most satisfactory
units, more especially when it
is to be automatically controlled.
The illustration shows a unit
with automatic control for
use in a sump suitable for
pumping against a total bead
of 15 feet. It is self-support-
ing, on its own base.
Vertically driven submerged
centrifugal pumps with drive
for direct coupling to electric

Billabong Galvanized Steel Fluming
Far better than earth channels, which waste water by
soakage, and frequently fall in and become choked.
Handy to transfer to other positions. Forms an excel*
lent stock drinking trough, when fitted with ends.
Billabong Fluming is made in various styles. The one shown
above is fitted with the Cross Band Clip, and the one shown below
—which should appeal to orchardists—is fitted with the Clincher
open pattern Clip. Both styles of Clips exert a powerful and even
pressure against inside and outside of curved sheets.
The inner and outer bands of both clips are in one piece, thus the
inner band cannot become dislodged.
