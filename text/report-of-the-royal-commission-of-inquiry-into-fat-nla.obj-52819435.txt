COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.
REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONERS.
INTRODUCTION.
To His Excellency the Right Honorable John Lawrence, Baron Stonehaven, a
member of His Majesty's Most Honorable Privy Council, Knight Grand Cross
of the Most Distinguished Order of Saint Michael and Saint George, Companion
of the Distinguished Service Order, Governor-General and Commander-in-Chief
in and over the Commonwealth of Australia.
May it please Your Excellency :
We, the Commissioners appointed l>y Royal Letters Patent to inquire into and report
upon the deaths and illnesses associated with the use of toxin-antitoxin preparation at Bundaberg.
Queensland, during the month of January, ] 928, including the causes of those'deaths and illnesses
have the honour to report as follows :
After preliminary experimental work conducted at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute
at the Melbourne Hospital, your Commissioners proceeded to Queensland and heard evidence at
Stanthorpe, Toowoomba, Bundaberg and Brisbane. In New South Wales evidence was heard
at Sydney, and in Victoria at Melbourne. The witnesses examined numbered forty-eight (48)
in Queensland, three (3) in New South Wales and fifteen (15) in Victoria, making a total of
sixty-six (66) persons. Since returning to Melbourne extensive experimental investigations
have been conducted at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute.
NARRATIVE OF EVENTS.
In pursuance of the policy of free active immunization against diphtheria, advocated
by the Commissioner of Health for Queensland throughout that State, and adopted by the
Council of the City of Bundaberg, Dr. Ewing George Thomson, Medical Officer of Health of
Bundaberg, began the inoculation of children with diphtheria toxin-antitoxin mixture in January,
1928.
The material used was taken from an india-rubber capped bottle purporting to contain
10 c.cm. of diphtheria toxin-antitoxin mixture. The bottle was one of thirty issued by the
Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, Melbourne, to the Commonwealth Health Department,
Brisbane, on the 29th November, 1927. It belonged to Batch 86 which had been made up on
the sth September, 1927, to contain in 1 c.cm. 0.8 L + dose of diphtheria toxin together with
one unit of antitoxin. No antiseptic was present in the mixture.
The bottle was forwarded to Dr. Thomson on 6th January, by Medical and Surgical
Requisites Ltd., Brisbane, who procured it on the same day from the Commonwealth Department
of Health, Brisbane.
On receipt Dr. Thomson stored the bottle until it was required in an instrument cupboard
in his surgery, where it was also kept during the periods between the inoculations which he made
from it.
The first inoculations were given on the 17th January, 1928. At the Bundaberg City
Council Chambers, in a room previously occupied by the City Engineer, Dr. Thomson gave six
children the first dose of two minims.
On the 20th January, 1928, at the same place, eight children received their first injection
of two minims.
On the 21st January, 1928, at his surgery, Dr. Thomson gave three children, including
his own son, the initial dose of two minims.


On the 24th January, 1928, at the Council Chambers, six children who had received their
initial dose on the 17th January, were given a second injection of four minims, and in addition
another child received her first injection.
No untoward effects resulted from any of these inoculations.
On the 27th January, 1928, in the room at the Council Chambers, between 4.10 p.m. and
5.5 p.m., the eight children who had received the initial dose on the 20th January, received their
second injection of four minims and in addition thirteen children received an initial dose of two
minims.
Of these twenty-one children, eighteen became ill with symptoms of significant similarity
during the night of the 27th January or the early morning of the 28th January. Eleven died
during the 28th January, and one on the 29th January.
During the morning of the 28th January all these children except one, who was brought
to Dr. E. T. K. Schmidt’s surgery but was found to be dead on arrival, were seen by Dr. Thomson,
Dr. L. D. McKeon, Dr. S. Robinson or Dr. I. C. Hains. Fourteen were admitted to the Bundaberg
General Hospital where nine died, several soon after admission. One was admitted to St. Vincent’s
Hospital and died there and one died in his own home.
Dr. Hains, the Medical Superintendent of the Bundaberg General Hospital, at about 3 p.m
on the 28th January, informed the Senior Sergeant of Police at Bundaberg of the deaths occurring
at his hospital and intimated that he was not prepared to sign death certificates.
The Sergeant of Police reported to the Inspector at Maryborough who gave instructions
that post-mortem examinations of all the bodies were to be made by Dr. E. T. K. Schmidt, the
Government Medical Officer at Bundaberg.
While the medical men at Bundaberg appear to have done all that was possible
in the circumstances, they were confronted by an emergency which taxed all their powers. The
unavoidable absence of skilled specialist aid early on the 28th (at which time no outside help could
have been available in any circumstances) and the heavy strain on the resources of the hospital
staff in the treatment of so many very sick children, naturally made the clinical records somewhat
incomplete.
It early became evident that it was desirable to obtain expert assistance. On becoming
aware of the facts and in view of the responsibility of the City Council, the Mayor of Bundaberg
at once attempted to get into communication with the Home Secretary (Queensland) to obtain if
possible the services of an expert pathologist from Brisbane, who, he suggested, might travel
up by special train that night or by aeroplane in the morning.
There was an unavoidable delay in conveying this request to the Home Secretary and the
importance of sending expert assistance was not realized by the State Authorities, who evidently
regarded the matter as the province of the Commonwealth and were anxious only to avoid
overlapping. On learning the steps which the Director of Tropical Hygiene, Commonwealth
Department of Health, Brisbane, proposed to take, the State Authorities considered that no
further action by them was called for (See Appendix 9).
Consequently no pathologist was available until the 30th January when Dr. Richards of
the Commonwealth Health Laboratory, Rockhampton, arrived at Bundaberg, and by then the
only material available for autopsy was the body of one child who had been dead fifty-two and a
half hours, during which time at the temperature of Bundaberg much post-mortem change must
necessarily have occurred.
On the evening of the 28th and the morning of the 29th January, Dr. Schmidt had already
carried out autopsies on eight bodies at times varying from four to twelve hours after death.
He also performed the autopsy at which Dr. Richards was present. From three of the bodies
he retained for subsequent investigation certain organs which were placed in spirit, unfortunately
in a manner unsuitable for their satisfactory preservation. Consequently, much of the material
was of little value. Dr. Richards preserved portions from one other body. Dr. Schmidt had had
no special post graduate training in pathology, and Dr. Richards’ training had not been specially
directed to this branch of investigation, so that many important possibilities which required
immediate investigation were overlooked.
The Director of Tropical Hygiene also sent Dr. G. A. Murray from Brisbane to Bundaberg,
where he arrived on the 30th January to inquire into the circumstances of the tragedy from an
administrative point of view.
Finally Dr. Tilling, on the 31st January, arrived on behalf of the British Medical Association
and the Brisbane City Council and made further investigations which later proved of considerable
value.
On receipt of the news of the tragedy, the Director-General of Health, Dr. J. H. L.
Cumpston, gave instructions that all toxin-antitoxin of Batch 86 should be withdrawn and that
no further issues of toxin-antitoxin should be made.


The remainder of the toxin-antitoxin mixture used by Dr. Thomson was handed over to
the Mayor on the afternoon of the 28th January. Its subsequent history is dealt with later,
(Appendix 18.)
On the Ist February, 1928, a Royal Commission was appointed to inquire into the fatalities
at Bundaberg.
CLINICAL HISTORY OF THE CHILDREN INOCULATED ON 27th JANUARY, 1928.
1. Those who Received Their First Injection op Two Minims on
27th January, 1928.
Case I— W.F., Male—aged two years and six months. —He had had scarlet fever three months
and his mother had had diphtheria two months before. He received his inoculation soon after
4 p.m. on 27th January. He had two large evening meals, was in the best of spirits at 7 p.m.
and went to sleep about 9 p.m. At 11 p.m, he woke his parents up “ rattling his cot with the
shivers.” His body was cold and his head very hot. From 11.30 p.m. to 11.45 p.m. he vomited.
He was given castor oil but no drinks, though he asked for water. He slept from midnight to
7.30 a.m. and was then found by his parents in an unconscious condition. He was apparently
deeply cyanosed with a blotchy purple mottling of the skin of the body, with blue lips and eyelids
and was breathing heavily. He was taken by car at about 8 a.m. on 28th January to Dr. Schmidt’s
surgery, but was found to be dead on arrival there.
Case 2 — F.8., male —aged nine years and six months. —There was no history of diphtheria
or other infectious disease. He was inoculated about 4.30 p.m. on 27th January, 1928, and there
were no symptoms whatever until 29th January, 1928, when the site of inoculation became
swollen and slightly painful. A day or two later an abscess formed and discharged pus.
Case 3 — G.8., male —aged jive years and eleven months. —-He had had no history of diphtheria
or other infectious disease, but suffered from “ coeliac disease.” He was inoculated at 4.30 p.m.
on 27th January. His illness commenced at 10 p.m. with vomiting and diarrhoea and continued
till 3 a.m. on 28th January, 1928. He was seen by Dr. Thomson at 8.30 a.m. —-temperature 101°.
At 11.45 a.m. he was admitted to the Bundaberg General Hospital—temperature 104°, pulse 120,
respirations 40. An enema was given with a green offensive slimy result. At midday 4,000 units
of diphtheria antitoxin were given intramuscularly. At 2 p.m. he was pallid and unconscious,
with dilated pupils, temperature 102.8°, pulse 132 respirations 56. After 2.30 p.m. there were
continuous convulsions and he was deeply cyanosed and vomiting green fluid. He died at 5.35
p.m. (See Appendix 8 for temperature chart.)
Case 4 — Monica S., female —aged tivo years and nine months. — There was no previous history
of diphtheria. She received her inoculation between 4 and 5 p.m. on 27th January, 1928. The
onset of symptoms was between 9 and 9.30 p.m., with vomiting and diarrhoea all night. She
was still conscious at 7 a.m. At 10.15 a.m. on the 28th January, 1928, she was seen by Dr.
Thomson and admitted to the Bundaberg General Hospital. She was then unconscious with
rolling eyes and glassy stare. The pupils were dilated though she had not yet received any
atropine. There was deep blotchy cyanosis ; temperature 102.8°, pulse 160, respiration 70. At
11 a.m., 4,000 units of antitoxin were given intramuscularly. An enema was administered, with
green offensive slime as result. She convulsed continuously, the convulsions being preceded by
a cry, and vomited from time to time first green and later brown fluid. At 2 p.m., temperature
104°, pulse uncountable, respirations 92. She died at 3.15 p.m. (For temperature chart, see
Appendix 8.
Case s—Maisie5 — Maisie S., female — aged four years and eleven months. — There was no previous hist-
ory of diphtheria. She received her inoculation between 4 and 5 p.m. on 27th January, 1928. The
onset of symptoms was between 9 p.m. and 9.30 p.m., with vomiting and diarrhoea until morning.
She was still conscious at 7 a.m. on 28th January, 1928. At 10.15 a.m., she was seen by Dr
Thomson and admitted to the Bundaberg General Hospital; temperature 103.2°, pulse 180,
respirations 60. She was then unconscious, with rolling eyes, glassy stare, and dilated pupils.
There was a deep blotchy cyanosis. An enema was given, resulting in a green slimy offensive
stool. At 11 a.m., 4,000 units of antitoxin were given intramuscularly. She had convulsions
and vomited, at first green, but later brown-coloured fluid. At 2 p.m., temperature 105.2°,
pulse uncountable, respirations 80. She died at 3.15 p.m. (For temperature chest, see Appendix 8.)
Case 6 — W.S., male — aged six years and six months. —There was no previous history of
diphtheria. He received his inoculation between 4 and 5 p.m. on 27th January, 1928. The
onset of symptoms was between 9 and 9.30 p.m., with vomiting and diarrhoea until morning. He
was still conscious at 7 a.m. on 28th January, 1928. He was seen by Dr. Thomson and admitted
to the Bundaberg General Hospital at 10.15 a.m. ; temperature 104°, pulse 166, respirations 74.


An enema was given with green slimy offensive result, and 4,000 units of diphtheria antitoxin
were given intramuscularly. It is doubtful if he was unconscious on admission, but he would
not speak. He did not know his father at 11.30 a.m. The area round the site of inoculation
was inflamed. There was projectile vomiting and cyanosis. (For temperature chart see
Appendix 8.)
2 p.m. —Temperature 103°, pulse 144, respirations 74.
6 p.m. —Temperature 102.4°, pulse 160, respirations 70, twitching of face and shoulders.
10 p.m. —Temperature 100.6°, pulse 160, respirations 36.
11 p.m. —Temperature 100.8°, pulse 140, respirations 48.
12 p.m. —Pulse 144, respirations 38, retention of urine, restless and vomiting. Catheterized
and 7 ozs. of urine were obtained.
29 th January, 1928 —
1 a.m, —Temperature 100.8°, pulse 136, respirations 32.
2 a.m. —Pulse 121, respirations 40, restless.
3 a.m. —Pulse 140, respirations 24, 8.W.0. green fluid stool.
4 a.m. —Pulse 136, respirations 26, speech more rational.
6 a.m. —Temperature 98.6°, pulse 136, respirations 24.
8 a.m. —Pulse 124, respirations 28, 8.W.0. voided urine with stool.
10 a.m. —Temperature 99°, pulse 140, respirations 32.
12 m.d. —Temperature 97.6°, pulse 114, respirations 32, restless.
2 p.m. —Temperature 97.8°, pulse 120, respirations 32, pain in left chest.
4 p.m. —Temperature 98.2°, pulse 120, respirations 32.
6 p.m. —Temperature 98.6°, pulse 116, respirations 30.
7 p.m. —Temperature 97°, pulse 128, respirations 30, voided urine, 1032—n0 albumin, no
sugar. Vomited sour curds.
8 p.m.—Temperature 98°, pulse 130, respirations 30, coughing.
12 m.n. —Pulse 124, respirations 28, sleeping.
30 th January, 1928 —
12.30 a.m. —Temperature 98.2°, pulse 134, respirations 36.
2 a.m. —Temperature 97.4°, pulse 112, respirations 26, sleeping.
6 a.m.—Temperature 98.4°, pulse 120, respirations 24.
During this day the temperature remained about 98.4°, pulse 108 to 120 and respirations
26 to 32, and there was a definite pleuritic rub on the left side of the chest. About midday he
complained of severe abdominal pain. This was relieved after an enema which yielded a dark
green offensive stool. On this day Dr. Eichards obtained a blood film which showed 91 per cent,
polymorphs in the differential count.
On 31st January, 1928, the temperature, pulse and respirations remained about the same
as on the 30th, and had returned to normal by the 2nd February. On the 6th, the area of
inflammation at the site of inoculation had become hard and very painful, and on the 7th February
temperature, pulse and respirations showed a marked rise doubtless due to this. On the Bth
February, Dr. Hains evacuated an abscess from which Dr. Eichards isolated a staphylococcus
in pure culture.
Case 7 — J.S. — male, aged eight years and one month. —There was no history of diphtheria.
He received his inoculation between 4 and 5 p.m. on 27th January, 1928. The onset of symptoms
was between 9 and 9.30 p.m. with vomiting and diarrhoea all night. He was seen by Dr.
Thomson in the morning and admitted to the Bundaberg General Hospital at 10.15 a.m. on 28th
January, 1928 ; temperature 103°, pulse 176, respirations 60. 4,000 units of diphtheria anti-
toxin were given intramuscularly. He was only semi-conscious on admission but knew his
father at 11.30 a.m. An enema gave a green slimy offensive result. (For temperature chart, see
Appendix 8.)
2. p.m. —Temperature 103°, pulse 148, respirations 68.
6 p.m. —Temperature 102.4°, pulse 172, respirations 52, very restless.
11 p.m. —Temperature 101.2°, pulse 140, respirations 48, restless and twitching.
29 th January 1928 —
1 a.m. —Temperature 101.2°, pulse 146, respirations 48, catheterized 11-ozs. ; urine
1,034 normal.
2 a.m. —Pulse 126°, respirations 30, 8.W.0., green slime with mucus.
3 a.m. —Temperature 101°, pulse 132, respirations 40, vomited offensive greenish fluid.
6 a.m. —Temperature 99.8°, pulse 140, respirations 28, more rational but vomiting green
fluid.
9 a.m. —Temperature 103°, pulse 144, respirations 48, restless.
12 midday.—Temperature 98.4°, pulse 126, respirations 36, dark green slimy stool.


2 p.m.—Temperature 98°, pulse 128, respirations 40.
4 p.m.—Temperature 99.6°, pulse 140, respirations 24.
Later in this day he passed urine normally twice; Sp. Gr. 1,020, acid, normal. There was
some cough and the pulse remained high. On the following day the temperature was a little
above normal, the pulse ranged from 112 to 128 and the respiration rate ranged from 22 to 40. On
this, the third day of the illness, Dr. Richards made a blood culture, which was sterile.
On 31st January, 1928, the temperature was almost normal, but the pulse varied trom
102 to 112.
On Ist February, 1928, he was much better, taking nourishment well, and he remained
well with only very slight pyrexia until 6th February, when his temperature rose slightly and the
local swelling at the site of inoculation increased and became definitely tender. On the 7th, the
abscess opened spontaneously and pus discharged from it. From this time the patient made an
uninterrupted recovery, though his temperature and pulse rate were slightly above normal from
time to time, and the arm discharged intermittently for some days.
Case B—N.W.—female,8 — N.W.—female, aged four years and seven months, was said by the parents to have
had diphtheria twelve months before. This was corroborated by Dr. Robinson but not confirmed
by the records of reported cases. She received her inoculation on 27th January, 1928, about
5 p.m. and thereafter had no symptoms until about three days later when a swelling appeared
at the site of the inoculation. On about 9th February, 1928, this broke down and discharged
pus. This child and her sister were seen on 28th January, 1928, by Dr. Robinson who found
them perfectly normal.
Case 9 — C.W.—female, aged eight years and five months, had diphtheria about a year before.
She received the first inoculation about 5 p.m. on the 27th January, 1928, and had no symptoms
of illness until three days later when the arm at the site of inoculation became painful and tender.
Pus discharged about 9th February, 1928.
Case 10— V.T.C., — male, aged five years and ten months. —There was no history of
diphtheria or any other infectious disease. He was inoculated at about 5 p.m. on 27th January
1928. Twenty hours later he had a temperature of 100° and a slight headache. There were no
other symptoms. On 15th February, 1928, a small local abscess was opened on the arm at the
site of inoculation and a staphylococcus was isolated in pure culture from the pus.
Case 11— G.M.G. — male, aged seven years and three months. —There was no history of
diphtheria or any other infectious disease. He was naturally a nervous child and vomited readily
if upset or frightened. He was inoculated at about 5.5 p.m. on 27th January, 1928. The onset
of symptoms was at 11 p.m. with vomiting, great distress and helplessness. He could not sit up
properly. The bowels were opened three times during the night with foul-smelling stools. He
was also delirious. In the morning he was still conscious but was breathing in short gasps and was
“ very blue and white ”. Dr. Robinson saw him about 8 a.m. He was then in a very excitable
state throwing himself about on the bed. He was cyanosed, temperature 103° and no pulse could
be felt. The heart was “ fluttering ”. He died soon after the doctor’s arrival.
Case 12 — J.P. female, aged five years and nine months. — There was no previous history of
diphtheria or infectious disease. She was inoculated between 4 and 5 p.m. on the 27th January,
1928. The onset of symptoms was at 10.30 p.m. when she felt sick, vomited and had diarrhoea.
On the morning of 28th January, 1928, she was seen by Dr. Thomson who had her removed to
the Bundaberg General Hospital. On admission at about 10 a.m., temperature 102.6°,
respirations 60. She was collapsed with an imperceptible pulse, was unconscious but not
convulsing. The stools were green, slimy and offensive. 4,000 units of diphtheria antitoxin,
were given intramuscularly. There was no cyanosis and her colour was waxy. At 2 p.m.,
temperature 103.4°, pulse 140, respirations 80. She died at 2.30 p.m. on 28th January, 1928.
(For temperature chart, see Appendix 8.)
Case 13 — B.P. — female, aged six years and nine months. — There was no history of
diphtheria or other infectious disease. She was inoculated between 4 and 5 p.m. on 27th January,
1928. The onset of symptoms was soon after 10.30 p.m. with vomiting and diarrhoea. She
was seen on the morning of 28th January by Dr. Thomson who had her removed to the Bundaberg
General Hospital where she was admitted at 10 a.m. in a collapsed condition —temperature
103.6°, pulse 168, respirations 58. There was a green slimy offensive result from an enema.
4,000 units of diphtheria antitoxin were give intramuscularly. The pupils were dilated, the lids
inflamed and a rash was observed on the body. She was delirious. (For temperature chart,
see Appendix 8.)
2 p.m. —Temperature 103°, pulse 180, respirations 56.
4 p.m. —Temperature 102°, pulse.lBo, respirations 56.
6 p.m. —Temperature 102.6°, pulse 156, respirations 52.
10 p.m. —Temperature 100.2°, pulse 174, respirations 44.
12 midnight.—Pulse 140, respirations 40.

She was catheterized at 1.30 a.m., and 7 ozs. urine were obtained Sp. Gr. 1020, acid
normal.
2 a.m.—Temperature 99.2°, pulse 108, respirations 28.
4 a.m. —Pulse 136, respirations 36, dark green stool with mucus.
6 a.m. —.Temperature 99.8°, pulse 100, respirations 26.
10 a.m. —Temperature 100°, pulse 104, respirations 28, very restless.
12 midday. —Temperature 98.8°, pulse 134, respirations 34.
2 p.m, —Temperature 99.6 °, pulse 136, respirations 32, voided urine.
8 p.m. —Temperature 99.8°, pulse 136, respirations 32.
During the night she was restless, but slept. She voided urine normally. By the early
morning of the 30th, the rash was all over the body and hands and was extremely irritable. The
temperature ranged between 99.8° and 101°, the pulse from 116 to 144 and the respirations from
26 to 36. Blood was taken in the evening for culture by Dr. Richards—result negative. The
next day, 31st January, 1928, her condition had definitely improved. The temperature ranged
from 98° to 99.8°, the pulse from 112 to 136, and the respirations from 24 to 28. The area on the
arm at the site of inoculation was now definitely inflamed.
On Ist February, 1928, the temperature, pulse and respirations were about the same and she
complained of a sore throat.
Her condition improved steadily though the local inflamation at the site of inoculation
persisted. On the 13th February, 1928, Dr. Hains incised the abscess in the presence of the
Commission who isolated a staphylococcus in pure culture from the pus. When seen on the
13th February, 1928, there was desquamation of the skin of the hands and feet.


Of these thirteen children, six were females and seven males. Three remaies and three
males died. The average age of the group was 5.8 years. The average age of those who
succumbed was 4.7 years. ‘ The average age of the survivors was 7.1 years. The illnesses in
families suggest that age or possibly body weight influenced the result, for on the whole the younger
children died and the older recovered. An exception to this is afforded by the C. children in
which the elder child died. In the B. family the younger child had suffered from coeliac disease.
The absence of illness on the W. children suggests a familial immunity.
Children who Received Their Second Inoculation op Four Minims on
the 27th January, 1928.
Case 14 — K.B. — male, aged three years and two months. —There was no history of diphtheric
but he had been a carrier about a year before. There was no history of other infectious disease.
He was inoculated on 20th January, 1928 and between 4 and 5 p.m. on 27th January, 1928. The
onset of symptoms was at 9.30 p.m. with vomiting followed by diarrhoea, until 12 midnight,
then only occasionally to 3.30 a.m. He was unconscious after 2.30 a.m. In the morning he was
limp, with short quick breathing and cyanosis. Seen by Dr. Hains and admitted to hospital at
8.45 a.m. —temperature 103°, pulse 190, respirations 80. He was then cyanosed, unconscious,
with glassy eyes, rolling stare and dilated pupils. The pulse was poor in volume. An enema
was given and a green slimy offensive stool resulted. 4,000 units of diphtheria antitoxin were
given intramuscularly. He convulsed almost continuously to 10.30 a.m. There was blotchy
cyanosis and vomiting. He died at 11.45 a.m. (For temperature chart, see Appendix 8.)
Case 15 — E.B. — male, aged five years and nine months. —There was no history of diphtheria
or other infectious disease. He was inoculated on 20th January, 1928, and between 4 and 5 p.m.
on 27th January, 1928. The onset of symptoms was at 9.30 p.m., with vomiting and diarrhoea
until midnight, when he settled down with only occasional vomiting until 3.30 a.m. He was
unconscious at 2.30 a.m. At 8.45 a.m. on 28th January, 1928, he was seen by Dr. Hains and
admitted to the Bundaberg General Hospital; temperature 103.4°, pulse 170, respirations 72.
He was then unconscious, deeply cyanosed, with glassy stare and dilated pupils. The pulse
volume was poor. A green slimy stool followed an enema. 4,000 units of diphtheria antitoxin
were given intramuscularly. From 9.15 a.m. he was convulsing continuously, appearing to have
pain before the onset of convulsions and was very restless and cyanosed. The colour of the lips
improved temporarily at 2 p.m. after administration of digitalis. At 2 p.m. —temperature 102.4°,
pulse 118, respirations 48. He vomited frequently, first green and later brown material. The
breathing became irregular and he died at 4.15 p.m. on 28th January, 1928. (For
temperature chart, see Appendix 8.)
Case 16 —M .Br.—female, aged three years and sir months. —There was no history of diphtheria
or other infectious disease. Her brother had just had diphtheria and came out of hospital on the
26th January, 1928 after three weeks there. She was inoculated on 20th January, 1928, and
between 4 and 5 p.m. on 27th January, 1928. The onset of symptoms was with dry retching at
12.10 a.m. There was then no pyrexia. She had no diarrhoea at any time. At 6.30 a.m. she
got out of bed and was able to walk out to the kitchen and ask for a drink of water. She was
conscious until 9 a.m., when she was seen by Dr. Thomson and sent to the Bundaberg General
Hospital. She was admitted there about 11.30 a.m. 4,000 units of diphtheria antitoxin was
given before admission. Temperature 105.4°, pulse 196, respirations 64 ; then unconscious and
cyanosed with a rash like a serum rash on the body. The pupils were dilated, the eyes rolling
and the stare glassy. A green slimy stool followed an enema. She was convulsing almost
continuously and her colour was very blue. There was twitching of the face before the onset of the
convulsions. Later there was projectile vomiting. She died at 5.30 p.m. on 28th January, 1928.
(For temperature chart, see Appendix 8.)
Case 17 — B.D. — female, aged one year and three months. —Two other children in this family
were in hospital with diphtheria on 20th January, 1928. She was inoculated on 20th January,
1928, and between 4 and 5 p.m. on 27th January, 1928. The onset of symptoms was about 1 a.m.
on 28th January, 1928. She was then still asleep but feverish and somewhat later vomited.
She was seen by Dr. Thomson at 2 a.m. (temperature 102.3°) and was sent to the Bundaberg
General Hospital, where she was admitted at 3.15 a.m. —temperature 102.8°, pulse 134, respirations
64. There was definite inflammation at site of inoculation.
Her temperature ranged from 100 to 102.4° during the day, but the pulse and respiration
rates were disproportionately rapid—l2o to 180 and 32 to 60 respectively. The temperature
remained above normal until 29th January, 1928, but the pulse and respiration rates were high
for some days later. On sth February, 1928 she was discharged from hospital apparently well,
except for a rapid pulse rate but was re-admitted on 7th February, 1928, on account of an abscess
in the arm at the site of inoculation. This was opened by Dr. Hains on 9th February, 1928, and


pus was evacuated from which a staphylococcus was isolated by Dr. Richards. The local infection
at this stage caused no pyrexia though the pulse rate was still somewhat high. (For temperature
chart, see Appendix 8.)
Case 18 — T.R. — male, aged five years and six months. —There was no history of diphtheria.
He was inoculated on 20th January, 1928, and again between 4 and 5 p.m. on 27th January,
1928. The onset of symptoms was at 9.30 p.m. He vomited for about ten minutes and then
had diarrhoea for about an hour, He then became febrile. At 6 a.m. his temperature was
103°. At about 9 a.m. he was seen by Dr. McKeon who was in the house about two and a half
hours. His general condition was good early in the morning, though he was irritable and feverish.
Later he became worse and at 12.45 p.m. on 28th January 1928 he was admitted to the.Bundaberg
General Hospital. He was then unconscious, with blotchy cyanosis and dilated pupils—
temperature 100.4°, pulse 116, respirations 20. An enema gave a green slimy offensive result.
Soon after admission his face and hands were twitching, though he was not convulsing.
At 2 p.m. —Temperature 102.6°, pulse 132, respirations 60.
6 p.m. —Temperature 103.4°, pulse 160, respirations 56.
10 p.m. —Temperature 105°, pulse 138, respirations 40.
11 p.m. —Temperature 104.4°, pulse 150, respirations 40.
29 th January, 1928 —
1 a.m. —Temperature 106°, pulse 152, respirations 36.
Late in his illness he developed projectile vomiting and Cheyne Stokes breathing. The
back appeared to be arched with the onset of convulsions. The cyanosis was profound and the
limbs were stiff before death, which occurred at 2.45 a.m. on 29th January, 1928. (For
temperature chart, see Appendix 8.)
Case 19 — W.R. — male, aged four years and two months.- There was no history of diphtheria.
He was inoculated on 20th January. 1928, and again between 4 and 5 p.m. on 27th January,
1928. The onset of symptoms was at 9.45 p.m. with vomiting and diarrhoea. His temperature
at 6 a.m. was 103°. About 8.15 a.m. he had a convulsion and, at about 9 a.m., was seen by
Dr. McKeon, who, after staying with him some time, and administering 4,000 units of
antitoxin subcutaneously, had him admitted to St. Vincent’s Hospital at 11 a.m.
He was then deeply cyanosed, unconscious and pulseless with shallow breathing.
Temperature 102.8°. He had occasional convulsions in which the hands were clenched, arms
and legs extended and the head slightly retracted. These spasms followed a little whine which
could just be heard. The jaw stiffened and the mouth remained slightly open. The child vomited
just before death, which occurred at 11.45 a.m. on 28th January, 1928.
Case 20 —M.R. — male, aged one year and eleven months. —There was no history of diphtheria.
He was inoculated on 20th January, 1928, and again between 4 and 5 p.m. on 27th January, 1928.
The onset of symptoms was with vomiting and diarrhoea at 11 p.m. on 27th January, 1928. He
was seen by Dr. McKeon at 9 a.m., and admitted to the Bundaberg General Hospital at 12.45
p.m. on 28th January, 1928, temperature 104°, pulse 160, respirations 60. His colour was pale
and flushed by turns and his pupils were dilated. An enema gave a green slimy offensive result.
Soon after admission he was convulsing, cyanosed, and later vomited. At 2 p.m. —temperature
104.2°, pulse 152, respirations 60. He died at 4.30 p.m. on 28th January, 1928.
Case 21 — E.D. — male, aged seven years and one month. —There was no history of diphtheria.
He was inoculated on 20th January, 1928, and 27th January, 1928. Abdominal pain and diarrhoea
occurred at between 6 and 7 a.m. on 28th January, 1928. He then felt alright and went fishing
until Dr. Thomson arrived at 10.30 a.m. and sent him to the Bundaberg General Hospital, where he
was admitted at 11.30 a.m. —temperature 100.5°, pulse 118, respirations 38. An enema gave a green
slimy offensive result. He was somewhat flushed and had a definite area of inflammation at the
site of inoculation, which was tender. His temperature and respirations were down in the evening
but his pulse rate remained high. The next day his temperature ranged from 98.2° to 99.2°,
pulse from 100 to 120 and respirations from 20 to 28. He vomited a quantity of watery fluid
at 6 a.m. and again later in the day.
His blood was cultured on 31st January, 1928, with negative result. He still had a raised
pulse rate though his temperature was practically normal. By Ist February, 1928, he was much
better. On 6th February, 1928, the arm became more inflamed. There had been a
slightly increased temperature since the 3rd. On Bth February, 1928, a deep area of
inflammation appeared on the buttock —this broke down and discharged on the following day.
On 13th February, 1928, both the arm and buttock were widely incised by Dr. Hains and
cultures were made from both by the Commission. A staphylococcus was found in each case,

Recovered
In this group there were eight children—six males and two females. Their average age
was four years and one month. Two only recovered and, unlike the first group, there were no
cases without symptoms. The higher morbidity and mortality is seen to be correlated with
increase in dosage of the injected material. Despite the lower average age of the children
comprising this group, these facts favour the view that the injection itself was responsible for
the deaths and not some unrelated cause.
The differences between the two groups are not such as are met with in the comparison of
the effect of a dose of toxin in the region of the M.L.D., with one twice as large, and may be held
to suggest the intervention of a living organism. The figures are, however, too small to exclude
error due to individual variation in susceptibility.
ANALYSIS OF SYMPTOMS AND DISCUSSION OF THEIR SIGNIFICANCE.
In the majority of fatal cases as well as in those which were severely ill, the symptoms
and signs are so closely similar that the description of a single case, with one or two exceptions
only, would adequately describe all of them.
Onset of Symptoms and Course of Illness. —The onset of symptoms was between 9.15 p.m.
on 27th January, 1928, and 1 a.m. on 28th January, 1928 —five to eight hours after the inoculations
were given. In the severe cases (Nos. 1,3, 4,5, 6,7, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, and 20), fifteen
in all, there was vomiting at the onset which was followed soon after by several loose foul-smelling
actions of the bowels. Diarrhoea only occurred during the early phase of the disease, and by the
time the children reached hospital had ceased. Enemas and bowel wash-outs then yielded green
slimy motions, with mucus in some, but no blood. In case 16, there was no diarrhoea. The
vomiting also ceased early, but vomiting of bile stained, and later still of brown material (? stained
with altered blood, due to continuous vomiting) was a late almost terminal event in Nos, 3,4,
5, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19 and 20. This last vomiting was most probably of central origin and due to
bulbar anoxaemia.
In all cases where the temperature was observed, there was pyrexia, which appeared to
reach its highest level some hours after the onset of symptoms and which declined fairly rapidly
in the case of children who recovered. The pulse rate was extremely rapid and out of proportion
to the temperature, as also was the respiration rate. In cases which recovered, it took some days
longer for the pulse to come back to norma] than for the subsidence of the temperature. The


respirations appear to have been shallow and exceedingly rapid, and the picture in most of the
severely affected children was, at the height of the disease, one of profound circulatory collapse
and suggested the action of some powerful toxin on the vasomotor centre or directly on the
peripheral circulation. In from eight to twelve hours from the onset of symptoms the children
who subsequently died became unconscious with equal widely dilated pupils.
The Cyanosis and Convulsions. —The last stages of the disease were in nearly all cases
associated with deep blotchy cyanosis and convulsions. The latter may have been asphyxial
in origin or due to the action of some potent toxin on the cells of the cerebral cortex. It is
uncertain, however, whether the cyanosis was not in most cases the result of the convulsions.
So far as can be gathered from the narrative, they were sometimes preceded, but generally
accompanied, by the cyanosis, and as was to be expected, occurred with greater frequency in the
younger children. Case 1 had cyanosis without any definite convulsions. In Case 3it is uncertain
whether the cyanosis proceeded or resulted from the convulsions. The child was pallid at 2 p.m.
and convulsions and cyanosis appeared half-an-hour later. Case 6 was deeply cyanosed, but had
no convulsions. He had, however, some twitching of the face and shoulders in the early morning
of 28th January, 1928. Case 11 was pale and later cyanosed, but had no convulsions. Case 12
was not cyanosed and there were no convulsions. Case 15 was very cyanosed before the onset
of convulsions. In Cases 18 and 19 the cyanosis accompanied the convulsions. In Case 20
the colour was alternately pale and flushed and cyanosis only appeared with the convulsions.
Nervous Signs and Symptoms. —The pupil reflex was absent for some time before death in
some cases. In only one was there definite rigidity before death (Case 18). There was no trismus,
no emprosthotonos or opisthotonos, although in Case 18 the back was arched with the onset of
convulsions. There was no local rigidity near the site of the inoculation. There was no head
retraction. No paralyses were observed and no squints except in the doubtful case of one of the
S. children, and then only during the convulsions. No changes were recorded in the reflexes
before the onset of convulsions. In most cases irritability of a “ cerebral ” type was a conspicuous
feature. Some of the fatal cases developed irregular or Cheyne Stokes breathing before death.
Most of these cases had retention of urine, which by the second day, in the cases with severe
symptoms which recovered, had passed off.
Rashes. —In two of the acute cases there was a rash on the body (Case 13, which recovered,
and Case 16, which died). In the latter there was a generalized rash on the body on admission
at 11.30 a.m., and though she had had anti-diphtheritic serum before admission, the period was
too short for the rash to have been due to serum sickness. In Case 13, serum was given at 10.30
a.m. on the 28th and the rash was out by noon. This is unlikely to have been a serum rash, as
they do not commonly appear on the first day. It was very irritable and general, extending to
the feet and hands. When the child was seen by the Commission on 13th February, 1928, there
was definite desquamation on her feet and hands. The rash in Case 16 was probably of septic
origin and unrelated to the administration of serum, and the same may be true of that in Case 13,
though the marked irritability after 48 hours and the spread on the extremities with later
desquamation are equally favorable to the view that it was an unusually early serum rash.
Dr. Hains drew our attention to the condition of the tongue, which in most of these cases
had a bright red area down its centre.
One case (No. 1) is said to have had its onset “ rattling his cot with the shivers.” A rigor
in a child of two and a half years must be a rare phenomenon, onset with convulsions being more
common at that age.
Symptoms in Survivors— The children who survived the injection on the 27th January
all present one important feature in common. All had abscesses at the site of the inoculation,
from which, in five cases, staphylococci were isolated in pure culture. (Appendix 22).
Case 21, E.D., also had a marked local reaction and only very slight general symptoms,
apart from a brief attack of abdominal pain and diarrhoea twenty hours after the inoculation,
followed by pyrexia with two attacks of vomiting on the second day. The pulse rate was
disproportionately high in this case also. He later developed a deep abscess in the buttock,
from which a staphylococcus was isolated (different from that isolated from the abscess in his
arm at the site of inoculation (Appendix 22). He was said to have had no antitoxin injected
into the buttock, and this statement is supported by the examination of his serum taken on
15th February, 1928, for its content of diphtheria antitoxin, which was much lower than that in
the children who were treated with antitoxin (Appendix 28).
In this case (E.D.), that of B.P. (CaseA3), and that of J.S. (Case 7), blood cultures were
made on 31st January, 1928 and 30th January,*; 1928, and examined by Dr. Richards. They were
only incubated four days and were 4 then discarded as they had grown nothing. J.S. and E.D.
were almost afebrile, I, and B.P. had onlyjslightjpyrexia at,"the time at which the cultures were
taken, so that had bacteriaemia been present earlier, it might have been missed at this time.


Case 10 (V.T.C.) had only a slight headache and a temperature of 100° twenty hours after
the injection and later a local abscess.
C.W. and N.W. (Cases 8 and 9) had no immediate symptoms, but only a local abscess
appearing later. No observations on the pulse rates are available in these children.
Case 7 (J.S.), the oldest child in the inoculated group, had moderately severe symptoms
with vomiting and diarrhoea at the onset. There was pyrexia with disproportionately increased
pulse rate, restlessness, retention of urine, and stupor. Like the other children who recovered,
he had an early local reaction at the site of inoculation, where he later developed an abscess.
Case 6 (W.S.) was the most severely ill child who recovered. He had early vomiting and
diarrhoea, high pyrexia and unconsciousness. There was twitching of face and shoulders,
restlessness and retention of urine. He, likewise, developed a pleurisy on the second day and
later an abscess at the site of inoculation.
Finally, Case 2 (F. 8.) developed no symptoms at all apart from the late abscess.
The treatment of these cases is briefly described in Appendix 8.
OUTSTANDING DEFECTS IN THE CLINICAL STUDY OF THESE CASES.
In pointing out, briefly, some of the defects in the clinical study of these cases, having
regard to its value in this investigation, it must not be thought that we are reflecting unfavourably
on the medical practitioners at Bundaberg, who in the absence of specialist aid did nearly all
that was possible in the short time available.
Blood cultures from two or three of the less seriously ill children taken on the morning of
28th January, when the pyrexia was at its height, would have been of great value, so also would
leucocyte counts and a few blood films. Broad, general observations on the nervous system, such as
the presence or absence of head retraction and of Kernig’s sign would have been useful also.
Lumbar puncture might with advantage have been done in two or three of the cases. The
description of the order and appearance of symptoms is in some cases vague and the exact
description of the symptoms themselves leaves much to be desired.
It was not possible to obtain microscopical and bacteriological examinations of the urine
and stools. Somewhat unexpectedly no albuminuria was recorded in any case and we do not
know whether or not pus cells, red blood corpuscles or micro-organisms were present in the urine.
It must be borne in mind, however, that confronted with the problem of treating a number
of mortally sick children, it would have been very difficult to meet all these requirements.
THE PATHOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS.
The Autopsies at Bundaberg.- -The police authorities, on learning that a number of deaths
in children were occurring at Bundaberg in circumstances in which the medical attendants were
not prepared to sign death certificates, ordered that Dr. Schmidt, the Government Pathologist,
should perform autopsies on the bodies of all the victims of the tragedy. This instruction was
not completely carried out. Nine autopsies in all were performed. At 3.15 p.m. on 28th January,
1928, Dr. Schmidt examined the body of one child (W.F.), and in the evening, between 7 p.m. and
10 p.m. (the exact order and times not being specially noted) the bodies of six others. The
Commissioner of Health at this stage told the Commissioner of Police, in answer to inquiry, that
it would be unnecessary to do more if Dr. Schmidt was prepared to give certificates of death in
the remaining cases. Dr. Schmidt, however, decided to perform one more, which he did at
11.30 a.m. on 29th January, 1928, and in this case retained specimens of most of the tissues.
One body (M.Br.) was held over to permit Dr. Eichards to be present, and the examination on
this case began at 10 p.m. on 30th January, 1928, i.e., 52J, : hours after death.
No post-mortem examination was made in the cases of Monica S., Maisie S., and W.E.
Organs or portions of organs were retained from only four of the bodies, W.F., J.P., T.E.,
and M.Br. In the case of M.Br., specimens were retained for microscopic examination only.
Of the others in two (W.F. and T.E.) the more important organs 'were preserved, though only in
one (T.E.) d d these include the whole intestinal tract and brain. In the third (J.P.), two organs,
a portion of another and a piece of clot, are all that were kept. Cultures and smears were taken
in one case (M.Br.).
The tissues from W.F., J.P., and T.E. were preserved in methylated or rectified spirit
and covered with gauze wet with the fluid on account of the insufficient quantity available.
On being taken over by the Commission on 14th February, 1928, the specimens were
suitably incised and transferred to a large volume of 5 per cent, formalin in hermetically sealed
tins for transport.


Resume of Pathological Findings by Drs. Schmidt and Richards.—As the Commission Jiad
no opportunity of being present at an autopsy, they have had to rely tor much that is of importance
chiefly on the evidence of the operator, Dr. Schmidt, and of Dr. Richards, who assisted at the
examination of one of the cases. Drs. McKeon and Hains were present at several autopsies
and have also given evidence on their observations.
There is a remarkable uniformity in the phenomena observed in the cases which have
been examined pathologically in detail.
The early, apparently almost instantaneous, onset of rigor noted by a number of observers
had completely or almost completely disappeared by the time of autopsy. In each case there was
considerable bluish discolouration of general distribution on the surface of the body and limbs and
less noticeable on the face, but with darker patches here and there, not hypostatic and with no
special prominence or pigmentary demarcation of the veins. Dr. Schmidt did not think there
were any haemorrhages into the skin. The glands in the neck and groin were not enlarged.
The serous cavities contained no excess of fluid nor was this abnormal in character, and no
haemorrhages, exudate or other abnoimal appearances were observed on the serous surfaces.
The hearts were firmly contracted, with no observable abnormality in musculature, valves,
chambers or endothelium. The contents were red clots and not fluid blood. Clots apparently
of antemortem character are described as being a constant phenomenon in both*venae cavae.
The lungs were said to be a peculiar pink colour but free from congestion, haemorrhages, oedema
or consolidation. The mediastinal glands did not attract notice at the autopsy and the thymus
presented no unusual features.
The stomach and intestines gave no indication of the presence of a lesion recognizable
on examination from the peritoneal surface. Indeed the evidence is emphatic that they appeared to
be anaemic. No localized contraction or dilatations were observed except in the case held over.
The alimnitary tract appeared empty and collapsed. No congestion or lesion of the mucosa nor
blood-stained mucus in the bowels was seen, though it must be pointed out that the examination
of the interior of the bowel seems to have been very limited indeed. The liver called for no
special comment. The spleen was very congested, but not enlarged. The kidneys are reported by
Dr. Schmidt as normal except in one case (J.P.) where a dark-red area at the lower pole, thought
to resemble an infarct was seen. Nothing abnormal was observed about the pancreas, great
vessels, or gall bladder, and the lymphatic glands did not attiact attention. The suprarenals
were not found at any of the autopsies. The examination of the brain and its membranes revealed
the presence of meningeal and superficial cerebral congestion and possibly pin-point haemorrhages
into the substance of the brain. The site of inoculation was not specially observed.
The above is the substance of Dr. Schmidt’s observations. It was supplemented in some
of the earlier cases by those of Drs. McKeon and Hains.
Dr. McKeon particularly noted the meningeal congestion and confirmed Dr. Schmidt’s
observation of the possible presence of an infarct in one kidney, and the excessive congestion
of’the spleens, which in the cases he saw at autopsy (W.F., T.R., and M.Br.), he thought were
enlarged. He could express no opinion on the nature of the clots.
Dr. Hains was particularly struck by the anaemic appearance of the gastro-intestinal
tract, and the injection of the surface of the brain, and observed on section general congestion
in the kidney of W.F.
Dr. Richards has put his observations at the autopsy on M.Br. on record in a report to the
Director of the Division of Tropical Hygiene (Appendix 10). They differ in several points from
those of the observers who were present at earlier autopsies and from his own evidence given
before the Commission. He was inclined to the opinion that the darker patches of the blotchiness
observed in the skin were due to haemorrhage. He did not observe clots in the heart or great
veins and fluid blood is mentioned as present in the heart. The spleen in his judgment was not
enlarged or apparently engorged. No noticeable congestion was present in the meninges or
brain, which, however, showed much post-mortem deterioration. Of the alimentary tract, the
stomach was the only part laid open, and the mucous membrane was without congestion or lesion.
There was some distension of the intestines with gas and a comparatively greater distension of
the stomach.
Dr. Richards also reports on microscopic sections taken from the heart, lung, liver, spleen,
pancreas, meninges, and brain, and on cultures from meningeal and pericardial fluid, liver, spleen
and heart blood. Smears of liver and splenic tissue and films from the heart blood were also
obtained. The suprarenal was not found in the specimens retained.
His microscopic examination of the sectioned material revealed no pathological changes
in liver, heart muscle, spleen, lungs or brain. He describes changes considered degenerative in
the pancreas, and toxic changes in the convoluted tubules of the kidney.


The cultures from the pericardial fluid were sterile, those from the heart blood, brain,
liver and spleen showed putrefactive organisms.
The smears from the liver and spleen contained a number of organisms, amongst which
short chains of cocci, possibly streptococci, were seen.
Additional Findings hy the Commission.— These findings are the result of the examination
of material obtained, as already described, from four of the children who died (Appendix 11).
In three cases the autopsy was begun within eight and a half hours of death, in the fourth 52|
hours had elapsed. The advantage of the earlier autopsies was lost by the subsequent treatment
of the specimens.
A detailed examination confirms in a measure the previous observation, but in some points
leads to quite different conclusions. Dr. Schmidt’s statements concerning the condition of the
heart, stomach, pancreas, great vessels and gall bladder are substantiated. The lungs, however,
show much congestion, especially of the larger vessels, and microscopically congestion in variable
degree is present in the alveolar walls, with in some cases oedema and in all some alveolar
dilatation and slight bronchial catarrh. The bronchial glands are definitely swollen and markedly
engorged. Vascular congestion is also seen in the heart and thymus. Comments on the condition
of the surfaces of organs are not of much value, but as far as the examination goes the absence
of haemorrhages, exudate or other lesion is confirmed. The oesophagus at its lower end and the
stomach and duodenum show no gross recognizable change. Prominence of the lymphoid
tissue increases towards the ileocaecal junction, where the mucous membrane generally is somewhat
swollen and beyond that point the lymphoid tissue continues to show up conspicuously.
Microscopically, there is no ulceration, haemorrhage or other lesion to be seen, and this is confirmed
microscopically, except that there is much disappearance of exposed epithelium, probably chiefly
post-mortem, which limits the value of the observations. The anaemic appearance recorded at
autopsy does not apply to the condition of the submucosa, which is quite definitely, though not
excessively, congested. All the abdominal glands show moderate swelling and microscopically
at least seme vascular engorgement. The appearance of the lower margin of the liver suggests
some volume increase. Section showed no recognizable change beyond some dilatation of hepatic
veins.
The spleen in two cases is larger than usual and in the other case much smaller.
Nevertheless, all are congested and all show evident swelling and pallor of the lymphoid tissue.
The kidneys show engorgment of the larger blood vessels, but no recognizable focal lesion. If
the kidney of J.P. retained is the one in which the infarct was suspected, no evidence now remains
of its presence. The suprarenals were found in two cases (both organs in W.F. and one in T.R.)
and present no sign of any pathological condition macroscopically or microscopically. The
brain shows much superficial congestion and in one case (M.Br.) microscopic haemorrhages near
the surface, but no other abnormality is evident. Post-mortem changes in the pancreas are too
advanced to allow of any useful histological examination.
Due allowance being made for post-mortem change, there would appear to be some cloudy
swelling of the liver cells and of the epithelium of the convoluted tubules of the kidneys. Apart
from this the liver exhibits a curiously uniform and the kidney a somewhat patchy congestion. No
focal lesion or fatty change is found in either, but a certain leucocytic excess is noticeable in
certain areas in the portal tracts. The most definite microscopic picture is that of the lymphoid
tissue, which is everywhere swollen and somewhat hyperplastic.
The phenomena shown in the centres of lymph follicles whether in glands, intestinal
mucosa or malpighian bodies of the spleen are similar throughout, fragmenting nuclei and granular
degenerating material being phagocyted by proliferated endothelial cells. Bizarre nuclear
degenerative forms are common and are seen not only here but variably in the splenic pulp or
in the lymph cords and sinuses of lymphatic glands. In addition, in the glands at the root of
the lungs (which are intensely engorged) and of the porta hepatis in two cases, the afferent lymph
sinuses are notably dilated and contain large numbers of polymorph leucocytes, while
proliferation and desquamation and phagocytic activity of endothelial cells in the sinuses complete
a striking picture. The thymus does not share in this change and gives the impression only of
a very moderate degree of cedematous swelling. The tissues from the site of inoculation, the
bone marrow and the spinal cord were not included in the material retained from the autopsies.
Bacteria are present in the clot from the inferior vena cava of J.P. and in many organs.
Many of these are coarse gram-positive bacilli, probably putrefactive. They are found in
varying numbers on the peritoneal surfaces, in the clot, and in all the organs of M.Br. They
are scanty or have not been found in the tissues from the other cases. In the clot there are also
abundant staphylococci chiefly distributed in clumps or colonies round the margin of the fibrinous
portion. There are also streptococci and other bacilli in small numbers. In most of the organs


diplococcal and single coccal forms, apparently staphylococci, are present in small numbers, but
never in such numbers as to leave the mind free from doubt of their bacterial nature. Attempts
to obtain unequivocal evidence of the distribution of staphylococci in the tissues must be regarded
as unsuccessful.
Defects of Pathological Procedure. —While the provision of death certificates following
autopsy by a Government Pathologist may satisfy purely administrative requirements, from the
point of view of a Commission endeavouring to establish a cause for the fatalities at Bundaberg,
the performance of the autopsies by a practitioner without special training leaves much to be
desired. His consciousness of insufficient special knowledge, equipment and facilities for
carrying out a peculiarly difficult investigation led Dr. Schmidt to appeal for expert assistance.
The early presence of expert assistance at Bundaberg might have made the present inquiry
unnecessary.
The outstanding defects are, in addition to the fact that autopsies were not performed on
every case, the failure to retain samples of all tissues from every case done, the absence of
examination of or retention of specimens from the site of inoculation, the lack of any proper
examination of the intestinal tract, the absence of any observations on the suprarenal glands,
the omission of any bacteriological examinations, and the unfortunate method of
preservation of such specimens as were retained.
There was no facility at the morgue for the storage of bodies at a temperature below that
prevailing at Bundaberg. One autopsy was done during the hours of daylight, and six at night
in from two and a half to three hours, a quite inadequate period for a thorough investigation.
Organs or specimens of organs (and those incomplete) were taken from only four of nine bodies.
No measurements of body length or weight or of the weight of the organs were made. The sites
of injection of the toxin-antitoxin were not specially examined and no tissue, culture or smear
was taken from them. No specimens of the axillary lymph glands were retained though it appears
that those in the neck and groin were examined. Lymph glandular conditions elsewhere were not
observed. The nature of the skin discolouration was not determined nor the presence or absence
of skin lesions noted. The suprarenals though searched for diligently in the case of M.Br. were
not seen at autopsy. The throat and oesophagus were not examined. The alimentary tract
(particularly the intestinal portion) was not completely laid open in any instance and the
intestines were retained from only one of the cases. No precaution to preserve stomach contents
or examine bowel contents was taken. The bladder condition and contents were not observed
or specially examined. The spinal cord and bone marrow were not examined or retained for
examination. Facilities for laboratory investigations are not available at Bundaberg, and
except in the case reserved (and by that fact the least likely to yield information of any value)
no smears or cultures were taken from organs or body fluids.
No effort was made to preserve suitable samples of the various tissues in either routine
fixatives or fluids appropriate to special investigation. The organs preserved were not incised
to ensure access of the fixative used. The amount of fluid applied was quite inadequate and
resulted in the exposure of organs to the air, while the use of methylated or rectified spirit for the
preservation in bulk of organs (extensively smeared with blood) was unfortunate. Moreover,
the fluid was never renewed.
No notes of the conditions observable only at the time of autopsy were made and there is
in consequence conflict and uncertainty of observation as well as of opinion amongst those who
were present.
IS THERE ANY POSSIBILITY THAT THE DEATHS WHICH FOLLOWED THE
INOCULATIONS ON THE 27th JANUARY WERE DUE NOT TO THE INJECTIONS
BUT TO SOME OTHER CAUSE ?
Taking into consideration the nature of the symptoms presented by the affected children,
we had to explore the possibility of ( a ) food poisoning, (b) acute gastro-intestinal infection,
(c) heavy metal poisoning, ( d ) other acute disease unrelated to the injection. In collecting
evidence the Commission only publicly heard the male parents, though privately a number of the
mothers were interviewed. It was obvious that the latter would provide more detailed
information. We, therefore, addressed to the mothers a questionnaire which they very kindly
filled in for us. The information derived from this source is included here. We have sought
some common factor in the history of the children on 27th January which might afford a clue.
School. —Some of the children were of school age and were pupils at schools situated in
different parts of the city. As the school holidays had not ended, the place of attendance is not
significant.


Location of Homes. —The attached map (Appendix 1) shows the distribution of the
homes from which the children came. It will be seen that these are scattered. In conversation
with parents we were not able to ascertain that the children who were inoculated on the 27th
of January had recently been congregated at any picnic or entertainment or at any place of
meeting other than the Municipal Chambers at which the injections were given.
Inquiries were also directed towards ascertaining to what extent parents and children were
acquainted with each other, and no indication was found of any association which covered all the
children involved.
Food and Drink on 21th January. —Particular attention was directed to the food and drink
taken on 27th January. In no case was food, drink or sweets partaken of at the Council Chambers.
Except in their own homes, the only children who partook of any food or drink, sweets or fruit
on the afternoon of 27th January, were the following : —E.D. (Case 21) had two ice-creams during
the afternoon, T.R. (Case 18) and W.R. (Case 19) had ice-cream and cake, and M.R. (Case 20)
had some cake. E.B. (Case 15) had a lemon squash and cake and some apples and plums, and
his younger brother K.B. (Case 14) also had some fruit in Bundaberg. N.W. and C.W. (Cases
8 and 9) had malted milk at a cafe in the city.
How the Children went to he Inoculated and went to their Homes —Y.T.C. and G.M.C. (Cases
10 and 11) left home with their mother at 3 p.m., were inoculated immediately at the Council
Chambers, left with their mother and went straight home. N.W. and C.W. (Cases 8 and 9) left
their home about 3.45, had to wait about twenty minutes for their injection and afterwards left
with their mother and had malted milk at a cafe and then went straight home.
E.D. (Case 21) was taken by his mother. They left home at 12.30 p.m. and visited numerous
shops before going to the Council Chambers. He was inoculated at once on arrival and left with
Mrs. Br. and his mother, going straight home.
W.P. (Case 1), aged two years and six months was taken by his mother, leaving home at
3.50 p.m. They had to wait about ten minutes at the Council Chambers and left to go straight
home with Mrs. C. 0.8. and her children (K.B. and E. 8.).
J. and B.P. (Cases 12 and 13) left home at 3.50 p.m. They had to wait about twenty
minutes at the Council Chambers and went straight home afterwards.
T.R., W.R., and M.R. (Cases 18, 19 and 20) lefthome at 2 p.m. and visited a confectioner.
They had to wait about fifteen minutes for the inoculations, but went straight home afterwards.
K. and E.B. (Cases 14 and 15) left home at 2.30 p.m. with their parents. They visited a
hairdresser, but were injected immediately upon arrival at the Municipal Chambers. They went
straight home afterwards.
M.Br. (Case 16) was taken by her mother, leaving home at 2.30 p.m. They visited a draper’s
shop before going to the Municipal Chambers, had to wait about fifteen minutes and left with
Mrs. D. and E.D. to go straight home.
E.B. and G.B. (Cases 2 and 3) had to wait thirty minutes at the Council Chambers before
inoculation, but went straight home with their mother afterwards.
The four S. children (Cases 3,4, 5, and 6) were taken by their mother. They had to wait
fifteen minutes at the Council Chambers, but went straight home afterwards.
B.D. (Case 17) was taken by her mother. They had to wait fifteen minutes at the Council
Chambers, but went straight home afterwards.
These facts do not allow of the supposition that on the day of the injections these children
all partook of any common article of food or drink. Apart from the exceptions noted above,
all the food consumed was prepared and eaten in their various and widely-separated homes.
The only experience they shared in common was their presence in the Engineer’s Room at
the Municipal Chambers between 4 and 5 p.m. and the injections which they received there.
Despite the unlikelihood of a common “ food poisoning ” or gastro-intestinal infection, we
considered it desirable to examine the sera of those children who survived to ascertain whether
in any of them there was evidence of antibody production to any member of the “ Salmonella ”
group.
This was done for us by Dr. F. M. Burnet, of the Hall Institute, who at the same time
tested the sera for agglutinins against the organism which was found in abscesses at the site of
inoculation in every case in which it was sought.
Agglutinins in the Sera of the Children who Survived. —Sera from eight of the surviving
children —J.S., W.S., C.W., Y.T.S., 8.D., E.D., 8.P., and F.B.—were examined for their content
of agglutinins against various Salmonella strains. The cultures used were from the National
Collection of Type Cultures, London, but in the absence of homologous sera their agglutinability
and their present state as to specific or non-specific phase could not be determined. In no case
was any agglutination evident at dilution of 1:20 or higher. The following Salmonella strains

were used against all sera—B. paratyphosus 8., B. enteritidis Gaertner, Salmonella types,
Stanlev, Reading and Derby, and B. paratyphosus C. (Hirschfeld). There is, therefore, no
evidence of the presence of Salmonella agglutinins, and, moreover, the clinical evidence is
unfavorable to the possibility under discussion.
At the same time the sera were tested with an agglutinating emulsion of the Bundaberg
staphylococcus and four sera from children in Melbourne were used as controls. Agglutination
was evident with all sera to the titres shown —
There is, therefore, only a very doubtful slight increase in the amount of staphylococcus
agglutinin beyond the normal in children.
Discussion of Symptomatology and Pathological Findings. —The diarrhoea occurred soon
after the onset of symptoms and by the time the children were admitted to hospital had ceased.
Vomiting, it is true, continued, but the late vomiting seems to be clearly due to other causes.
No blood was noted in the stools though mucus was present in some, and no bacteriological or
microscopical examinations were made. The clinical picture only very superficially resembles
that due to food poisoning or acute gastro-enteritis.
Furthermore, the pathological evidence is distinctly unfavorable to these possibilities.
The serous surface of the small and large intestines was in all cases pale and not congested, though
proper immediate examination of the mucosa was not made in any of the nine autopsies.
The post-mortem findings in* the only case in which they have been fully investigated are
also opposed to this hypothesis. Specimens of the whole intestinal tract were only available
to the Commission in one case (W.R.), autopsied eight to nine hours after death. The value of
this material was greatly reduced by the post-mortem changes (desquamation of cells, &c.) which
had occurred. There was general lymphatic hyperplasia in the ileum and caecum and some simple
hyperplastic enlargement of the adjoining lymph glands, but no congestion, oedema, cellular
infiltration, necrosis or ulceration was evident in any portion of the mucosa.
Finally, no other cases of severe gastro-intestinal disorder occurred in Bundaberg and its
environs at this time. The evidence of all the doctors in the town is unanimous on this point.
The whole evidence is, therefore, overwhelmingly opposed to the possibility that the deaths at
Bundaberg on 28th and 29th January, following the inoculation of toxin-antitoxin mixture were
due either to food poisoning or to acute gastro-intestinal infection.
The absence of any common food supply also excludes the possibility of botulism and the
clinical picture does not bear the faintest resemblance to this disease.
The possibility of heavy metal poisoning has been suggested by more than one authority
as a possible cause of the Bundaberg deaths. Administration with food or water by accident
or intent is excluded by the evidence detailed above and the possibility of any heavy metal
gaining access to the interior of the bottle is eliminated by the fact that we were able to isolate
living organisms from its remaining contents —which would certainly not have been possible
had any heavy metal been present in significant concentration. The needles used for the injections
were in excellent condition, little used, and free from any obvious oxidation, so that this extremely
unlikely source is excluded.
Further, the pathological findings already discussed, particularly those in the liver, kidney,
and large bowel, are incompatible with acute death from any such cause. We have, however,
had an analysis made of the livers of W.F. and M.R. (Cases 1 and 20) by Mr. F. H. Holden, of the
Hall Institute. The results o£ these analyses are given in Appendix 12. No significant amounts
of heavy metals were found.
That the deaths were caused by some other acute disease unrelated to the injection, in
the absence of any other similar cases of illness among children in the City of Bundaberg, is too
remote a possibility for serious consideration. The mere gathering of these children together
in one place in which only a few of them were present at the same time cannot be regarded as
providing even the slightest ground for the belief that while at the Municipal Chambers some of
them were infected with a mysterious and fatal disease.
Finally, as has been earlier pointed out, the heavier mortality among those children who
received the second and larger injection, and the general though not absolute relationship of the
severity of the effect to the age, and presumably to the body weight of children in the same families,
and finally the onset of significantly similar symptoms at approximately the same time interval


after the injections, in most cases, afford strong evidence that the injection of toxin-antitoxin
mixture on the 21th January was the cause of the deaths and the severe illnesses which followed only in
children who had received the injection on that date.
DO THE SYMPTOMS WHICH FOLLOWED THE INJECTION IN THESE CHILDREN
FAVOUR THE VIEW THAT THEY WERE CAUSED BY FREE DIPHTHERIA
TOXIN IN THE BOTTLE OF TOXIN-ANTITOXIN MIXTURE ?
Clinical experience of diphtheria would not enable us to answer this question definitely
though Dr. Scholes of the Infectious Disease Hospital speaking from his very large experience
thought it unlikely that the symptoms were due to this cause.
Resume of previous accidents. —Previous accidents in the history of immunisation afford
us the only satisfactory evidence in regard to the symptoms which may be expected to follow
the administration of free diphtheria toxin. The most important of these for our purpose is that
which occurred at Baden, Vienna, in September, 1923, when seven children died as the result
of the injection of a mixture supposed to contain toxin and antitoxin for active immunisation
against diphtheria. According to Grassberger the deaths in this case were due to some of the
phials being filled in error with toxin instead of with toxin-antitoxin mixture—though Busson
and Loewenstein, who were responsible for making the mixture, held that the phials became
toxic by the dissociation of free toxin from the mixture which according to them was originally
atoxic.
This accident took place at an infant’s home where two cases of fatal diphtheria had occurred
and necessitated active immunisation to limit the spread of the disease. All the infants were
first Schick tested to ascertain how many of them were immune, and thirty-four susceptible
children received a subcutaneous injection of 1.0 c.cm. of the supposed toxin-antitoxin mixture
in the abdominal wall. After twelve hours some of the children became restless and within
twenty-four hours swellings appeared at the site of inoculation which soon spread widely to
the axilla and groin (infiltration). • Despite the subcutaneous administration of 2,000 units of
antitoxin at this stage, there were seven deaths and ten cases of severe reaction. The deaths
occurred in infants aged 50, 34, 30 and 144 days, 2, 1 and 1 years respectively. All had been
Schick positive. In all the diphtheritic infiltration of the abdominal wall was very extensive
(large vesicles appearing in the skin) and in some cases this was followed by necrosis. Death
occurred on the 7th, 4th, sth, 9th, 12th, 17th and 41st days. In all the fatal cases the typical
haemorrhagic infiltration of the adrenal glands was found postmortem. The two which died on
the 9th and 12th days had each an excessively large thymus and two others were described as
“ weakly,” the first being a premature child.
The toxin-antitoxin mixture made by Loewenstein and Busson should have contained in
1 c.cm., 14-19 M.L.D. for guinea pigs of 250 grams, over-neutralized with antitoxin. The actual
material used for injection into the infants and children at Baden estimated by its toxicity for
guinea pigs contained, according to Grassberger, about 10 -M.L.D.’s of free toxin in 1.0 c.cm.
Another accident occurred at Dallas in Texas. In this case forty severe reactions in children
followed the injections from one particular batch of toxin-antitoxin mixture. In mixing this
batch the Danysz phenomenon was overlooked and a toxic mixture resulted. The symptoms
observed were pyrexia, vomiting and pain at the site of injection and in all of them there was an
extensive local reaction, the skin being intensely inflamed and the inflammation extending to the
forearm, shoulder and hand and even across the chest in some cases. Large vesicles filled with
clear fluid appeared, presumably like those observed in the Baden disaster. Five deaths occurred
in from twelve to sixteen days after the injection, but no postmortem examinations were made.
Still another accident occurred in 1924 at Concord and Bridgewater, Massachusetts,
following the injection of toxin-antitoxin after it had been frozen during the intensely cold weather
and then thawed out for use. Material from the same batch had been used earlier without any
ill-effects but after freezing and thawing it produced severe local reactions and constitutional
disturbances. G. W. McCoy, M. J. Rosenau and W. H. Park commenting on this accident
recommended that in future mixtures containing 1/10 L -j- dose of toxin per dose for injection
should be used —a strength which, it may be noted, had already been in use in Australia since
1922 when the toxin-antitoxin mixture was first made by the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories
under Dr. Penfold’s direction. This accident was clearly shown by the later work of Glenny
and Pope to have been the result of the localized concentration of phenol in the mixture during
the process of freezing with consequent destruction of antitoxin.
Consideration of toxin-antitoxin mixture used at Bundaberg —No method is readily available
of dissociating toxin from antitoxin mixture so as to obtain a quantitative yield of free toxin,
and we were not, therefore, able by experiment to exclude the possibility that Batch 86 was a


more concentrated mixture of toxin and antitoxin than it purported to be (Appendix 13)
We have, however, checked the process of mixing from the original notes of the laboratory and
have ascertained beyond question that these had in no way been altered since they were first
written.
A large number of independent witnesses speak for the fact that the mixture was evenly
balanced. No ill effects followed injections from a number of different samples of this batch
in a large series of children, not did any such effects follow the injections made by Dr. Thomson
prior to 27th January. In addition to the tests originally made when the batch was issued,
special tests were set up immediately at the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories and these were
satisfactory. Finally our own experiments showed that the mixture was properly balanced
(Appendix 16).
Possibility of deaths from free toxin. —Gross errors in dosage by Dr. Thomson being excluded
by the volumetric considerations in regard to the quantity left in the bottle, detailed in Appendix
18, the first immunising dose of two minims given at Bundaberg on 27th January could have
contained only 0.1 L -f- dose and the second dose of four minims rather less than 0.2 L + dose
even if all the toxin present had been set free. There is furthermore a very striking
difference between the deaths at Bundaberg and those at Baden. The affected children at
Bundaberg were not weakly infants like those at Baden but strong healthy children and even
presuming that the whole of the available toxin in Dr. Thomson’s bottle had been dissociated
from antitoxin it could not possibly have caused the very rapid fatalities which ensued at
Bundaberg. Further, none of the survivors in the three months which have elapsed since the
injections have developed any palatal palsies or late effects from diphtheria toxin.
Even if it were supposed that the mixture had been made up wrongly and contained
much more toxin and antitoxin than it purported to do, the deaths could not be explained by the
liberation of correspondingly greater amount of toxin as there were no local reactions in any of the
children injected on the 27th, which were in any sense equivalent to those which would have been
produced by the subcutaneous injection of a significant amount of un-neutralized diphtheria
toxin.'
It is, however, not clear from the clinical evidence that dissociation of quantities of
diphtheria toxin too small to produce infiltration might not conceivably have played some part
in increasing the activity of the agent which actually caused the deaths, or of diminishing the
resistance of the affected children. That this possibility is very unlikely is indicated by our
experiments in Appendix 29.
History of children in regard to diphtheria. —Among the children inoculated on the 27th
January, one (Case 9), gave a history of diphtheria a year before, one (Case 8), a doubtful history
and one (Case 14) had been a carrier. The two first had no symptoms following the injection
and the last died. The mother of Case 1 had had diphtheria in November, 1927. Two other
children of the same family as B.D. (Case 17) were in hospital with diphtheria at the time when
B.D. was inoculated, and a brother of M.Br. (Case 16) had just come out of hospital where he
had been treated for diphtheria.
We twice swabbed all the survivors of the injections on the 27th January without finding
any carriers of virulent diphtheria bacilli among them.
Antitoxin in blood of survivors. —ln view of the possibility that diphtheria toxin might
have played an adjuvant role in causing the deaths, we considered it advisable to ascertain whether
there were any notable difference in the amount of diphtheria antitoxin in the blood of the
survivors which might account for differences in the severity of symptoms.
Since it was not expedient to request the parents to allow us to submit these children to the
Schick test, we obtained the sera of eight of the nine survivors and tested them for their content
of diphtheria antitoxin (Appendix 28). The sera from two of four children who had no
symptoms following the injections were found to have a very high titre of antitoxin. A third
had an extremly low titre and we were not able to get serum from the remaining child. The
sera of three children who recovered after a severe illness and who had received 4,000 units of
antitoxin intramuscularly on 28th January, 1928, were found to have a moderately high titre of
antitoxin. Finally, the sera of two children who had a less severe illness and to whom no antitoxin
had been administered, had a very low titre of antitoxin.
It seems likely that the children who had a high titre of antitoxin in their circulating blood
of 15th February, 1928, would have been protected against diphtheria toxin on 27th January,
but a third child who also had no symptoms could have had no such protection.
With regard to the remaining children, it is not possible to infer from these results whether
they were Schick positive or Schick negative before 27th January. The effect of the administration
oi. antitoxin is still evident in the relatively high titres given by those who received 4,000 units


in hospital and it is not unlikely that, had they not received this treatment, the antitoxin content
of their sera would also have been low. These results are unfavourable to the view that free
diphtheria toxin was responsible in whole or in part for the deaths at Bundaberg.
There is no specific evidence that diphtheria toxin is the cause of the pathological lesions
found. It should be remembered that most of the systemic lesions described as characteristic
of diphtheria have been observed in cases in which there was a much longer time for their
development than there was in the present series. It is true that the most striking lesions present
in the histological material from these cases are those of the lymphoid tissue, but they are not
demonstrably specific and may occur in other diseases in which the incidence of the poisoning
is prominently in that tissue, more especially in children. There was no haemorrhage in or about
the lymph glands. In the only cases in which autopsies have been performed following deaths
presumably due to the direct inoculation of children with diphtheria toxin, haemorrhagic infiltration
into the suprarenal glands was constantly present. No such lesions were present in the suprarenals
examined from two of the present cases. There is an absence of change in the musculature or
interstitial tissue of the heart, of focal or central necrosis in the liver, of localized cellular
accumulations in the kidneys or lungs, and of phagocytic activity in the vicinity of the Hassel’s
corpuscles in the thymus. Characteristic infiltration of the tissues at the site of inoculation
would probably not have been missed had it been present.
Experimental studies on toxin-antitoxin dissociation. —We have not been able to
demonstrate the smallest amount of free toxin (1/250 to 1/500 of an M.L.D.) in toxin-antitoxin
in which we have grown the Bundaberg staphylococcus at various temperatures (Appendix 26).
Free antitoxin is destroyed only very slowly by this organism which we isolated in pure culture
from the remaining contents of Dr. Thomson’s bottle of toxin-antitoxin mixture (Appendices 18
and 25). Even the growth of an organism capable of rapid proteolysis (B. proteus x 19) does not
appear to be capable of dissociating toxin from antitoxin mixture (Appendix 21). The assumption
that dissociation was produced by some organism other than the staphylococcus, which multiplied
aud then died out, is inherently improbable upon this ground alone. When, however, we take
into account the ease with which organisms like streptococci and B. proteus are recovered after
growing together with staphylococci in toxin-antitoxin mixture for a week or more (Appendix 21),
the stability of diphtheria toxin in the presence of the Bundaberg staphylococcus (Appendix 25)
and our inability to demonstrate any trace of toxin in Dr. Thomson’s bottle (Appendix 18), the
possibility of such an occurrence becomes very slight indeed.
Taking all these facts into consideration, we may dismiss the possibility that dissociation
of toxin from toxin-antitoxin mixture played any part at all in causing the illnesses and deaths
under consideration.
Was tetanus the cause of the Bundaberg fatalities ? —The second possibility that must be
discussed here is the suggestion that tetanus toxin might have been produced in the bottle in
sufficient amount to give rise to rapid death, assuming that the contents at some time had become
contaminated by B. tetani. Regarding this suggestion in the light of the clinical findings, it
must be admitted that there is no clear evidence in its support. It is true that most of the fatal
cases had convulsions, but these only occurred in the younger children. In the others there
were twitchings of the shoulder and face. Dr. Schmidt who saw three of the children during life
regarded the convulsions as those peculiar to young children and infants. Dr. McKeon in two
of the fatal cases observed flaccidity between the convulsions. Dr. ITains, who saw most of the
children in the late stages, observed a certain degree of rigidity between the spasms in some of
them, notably in T.R. (whose back w T as somewhat arched with the onset of the convulsions).
He was, however, quite definite that the rigidity he observed was not a tetanic rigidity and that
the convulsions were not tetanic. There was no suggestion of any local rigidity in the
neighbourhood of the site of injection and in no case was there rigidity of the abdominal wall,
or trismus and in only one (Case 18) were the limbs stiff before death.
Retention of urine and early unconsciousness observed in the fatal cases also form no part
of the picture in tetanus, nor do the gastro-intestinal disturbances present in nearly all the
Bundaberg cases.
The amount of tetanus toxin required to be generated in the bottle must necessarily have
been very large, despite the extreme sensitiveness of man to this toxin, to permit of the time
from injection to death being so short. If B. tetani had multiplied in the bottle to a sufficient
extent to liberate this amount of toxin, it is inconceivable that in the surviving children, who
suosequently developed abscesses at the site of injection, living tetanus bacilli should not also
have flourished and given rise to chronic local tetanus or more probably to acute tetanus with
its normal incubation period of some days.


The pathological findings, as might be expected, do not provide any evidence either for
or against this hypothesis. The nervous system was not in suitable condition for examination
by special staining methods to demonstrate changes in the dendrites, granules or nuclei, and
in any case the changes which have been described in tetanus are not specific.
Neither degeneration of voluntary muscle nor gross haemorrhages nor rupture were
described in any of the Bundaberg autopsies.
Attempts to grow tetanus bacilli (Appendix 20) both in the presence of the Bundaberg
staphylococcus and alone in rubber-capped bottles of toxin-antitoxin mixture, indicate that
the conditions are unfavourable either for the growth of the organism or for the production of
toxin.
We were unable to recover B. tetani from the bottle used by Dr. Thomson for his injections
and the experiments in Appendix 20 show that these organisms when present even in small numbers
are readily recoverable by culture in the media which we used for the investigation of the remains
of the bottle of Batch 86 from which the injections at Bundaberg were made. On these various
grounds, therefore, we can exclude the possibility that the deaths at Bundaberg resulted from
tetanus.
Were the deaths at Bundaberg due to anaphylaxis w allergy ? —The next question which
arises is as to whether the symptoms could possibly have been anaphylactic or allergic in origin.
It was evidently from this point of view that atropine and adrenaline were freely used in treatment.
Dr. Scholes who had had a large experience of the effect of serum injections, was of the
opinion that the symptoms could not be explained in this way. There are some further general
considerations which confirm this opinion.
In the first place it would be an extremely remarkable phenomenon if in a group of 21
children (eight of whom had previously been inoculated from the same bottle without any
symptoms) twelve should die from allergy (using this term in the sense defined by Coca) and at
least four others should exhibit severe symptoms. On the other hand, if anaphylaxis were
presumed to be the cause and the first injection the sensitizing dose, the affected children should
have been only in the group who received their second injections, and in any case the intervening
period is too short for the acquirement of sensitiveness. Further, the nature of the material,
its extremely small content of horse serum, the small size of the dose and the manner of the
injection are unfavorable .to this possibility, though in view of the case noted below they do
not exclude it. The symptoms of the Bundaberg cases only very superficially resemble those
produced in anaphylaxis or allergy. The time elapsing until the onset of symptoms is too long
and the breathing which was shallow and rapid is unlike the type of respiratory distress which
would be expected in at least some of the cases were they allergic or anaphylactic in origin. Finally
the cases did not appear to respond to treatment with adrenaline.
In Dr. Derham’s evidence he referred to an illness which may possibly have been
anaphylactic in a girl of fourteen years of age who had had a previous injection of diphtheria
antitoxin about three weeks before. About four hours after the injection of two minims of
toxin-antitoxin mixture she developed pyrexia, a very rapid pulse rate, cyanosis and dyspnoea
(resembling asthma, but not definitely expiratory). She responded well to an injection of
adrenaline. Such an isolated case may have this explanation.
THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SYMPTOMS.
What then is the significance of the symptoms in the children who were inoculated on
27th January at Bundaberg ? They were those of a profound and overwhelming toxaemia
resulting either from the injection of preformed toxin or from the formation of toxin “ in vivo,”
with or without septicaemia.
The toxin evidently had a profound effect on the cardio-vascular system whether exerted
centrally or peripherally. The early vomiting and diarrhoea have no special significance. These
symptoms are commonly met with as an early non-specific response to any toxin. The late
picture was dominated by anoxaemia and cyanosis associated with the profound circulatory
failure induced by the toxin. The convulsions may have been due either to a direct action of
the poison on the central nervous system or to asphyxia.
For the further consideration of the cause of these symptoms it is necessary to take into
account the results of our investigation of the contents of the fatal bottle (Appendix 18),


RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION OF THE REMAINING CONTENTS OF
DR. THOMSON’S BOTTLE.—THE BUNDABERG STAPHYLOCOCCUS.
The remaining fluid was turbid, and, apart from a yeast which we failed to grow, the only
organism which could be isolated from it was a staphylococcus which we have named the
Bundaberg staphylococcus. This organism was found to be identical with staphylococci isolated
in pure culture from abscesses at the site of injection of five of the surviving children (Appendix 22),
In the remainder it was not sought for. Its pathogenicity for guinea pigs, mice and monkeys
(macacus rhesus) is slight. In rabbits, intravenous injections in relatively small doses may give
rise to death in 12 to 24 hours with convulsions and without gross lesions at autopsy. In
animals surviving longer, gross suppurative kidney lesions are invariably found. Even for this
species the pathogenicity of the organism is subject to wide variation.
Its morphology is in every way typical of the staphylococcus pyogenes group, i.e.,
minute Gram positive spherical cocci forming pairs, tetrads, short chains and clusters.
It grows readily at room temperature and somewhat better at 37° under both anaerobic
and aerobic conditions. Its coloration on solid media is intermediate between the typical
“ aureus ” and “ albus.” Twenty-four hours’ growth on agar has a pale cream colour ; longer
incubation produces an orange tint which is more noticeable where the growth is heavy or is
drawn up into a heap with a platinum loop. It forms a smooth and not viscid emulsion in
physiological salt solution, and the emulsion runs rapidly through a moderately tight cotton-wool
filter, differing in these respects from staphylococcus epidermidis albus.
On agar plates discrete surface colonies are flat but the centre is somewhat raised, and if
the plates be left in the incubator there is some further thin peripheral growth which develops
a finely dentate edge. The colonies are at first cream coloured but later the centres have an
orange tint by transmitted light.
Plates occasionally showed more typically aureus variants often appearing as a sector
change in a predominantly white colony. In platings from, the original cultures in glucose broth
after some weeks well-marked aureus colonies appeared as well as typical pale types. These
colonies showed distinctly different serological behaviour referred to in Appendix 22. Deep
colonies in agar plates are shaped like a double .convex lens. Gelatin is liquefied, a small
cup-shaped depression being visible at the lower end of the streak in eight days at room
temperature.
In broth there is a smooth growth, but a deposit begins to form quite early. With a
moderate inoculum there is a considerable turbidity and a little creamy deposit in 24 hours,
both more marked after 48 hours. The deposit becomes buff coloured but does not develop the
typical orange colour of the “ aureus ” deposit. Old cultures may show some scum on the surface,
more particularly attached to the glass round the periphery.
On blood agar plates there is slow and only slight haemolysis, contrasting strongly with
the typical haemolytic “ aureus.” After some days growth on human blood agar plates discrete
circular areas of haemolysis appear in a zone adjacent to the regions of growth. These almost
certainly represent the phenomenon described in 1927 by Muller as “ haemophagie.”
Glucose, lactose, saccharose and mannite are fermented with acid production in 24 hours.
Salicin, raffinose and inulin are not fermented in nine days. Litmus milk becomes slightly acid
in 24 hours, more strongly acid in two days and is clotted in four days.
A serum produced against the Bundaberg staphylococcus agglutinates most pyogenic
aureus strains to its fuU titre.
The organism when grown at 37° C. for so short a time as seven to eight hours in broth,
or in broth or toxin-antitoxin mixture to which human blood has been added, produces a
filterable toxin, somewhat unstable in dilute solution, which reacts specifically in skin tests in
man (Appendix 24). We have been able to show that there is a great deal of variability in the
sensitiveness of different individuals to this toxin. In sensitive individuals good skin reactions
may be obtained in dilutions of 1 in 2,000. In some cases better reactions are observed when
human blood has been added to broth than when broth alone is used for culture.
It may be significant that the virulence of the organism for rabbits is enhanced by injecting
the serum from blood from the heart of an animal killed by intravenous injection of the organism,
after this blood has been incubated a few hours.
The substance which in such high dilutions give rise to skin reactions in man is non-toxic
as judged by the results of injection in large doses into laboratory animals (guinea-pig, rabbit
and monkey) —a point of interest in view of the low pathogenicity of the organism when tested
by subcutaneous injection in these animals.


Pathogenicity of Bundaberg Staphylococcus in Toxin-Antitoxin Mixture. —We have also
carried out suggestive experiments in which this organism has been grown in toxin-antitoxin
mixture at Bundaberg temperatures. It is interesting that under these conditions a cellulitis
is produced in guinea-pigs following the subcutaneous injection of O's c.cm. of the mixture at
about the sixth day. The power to produce this reaction is then lost but returns at about the
ninth day. Since similar infiltrations can be obtained by the injection of an emulsion of the
organisms in sufficient number together with O's c.cm. of nutrient broth or of toxin-antitoxin
mixture, this phenomenon is difficult to interpret. Its development appears to depend on the
presence in sufficient numbers of both living and dead organisms rather than on the number of
living organisms, but the disappearance and re-appearance of activity remains unexplained.
Individual variations in the resistance of the experimenta l animal only exaggerate, but do not
explain the effects produced.
Did the Deaths at Bundaberg result from the Activity of this Staphylococcus ? —Let us now
consider in the light of these facts whether it is possible that the illnesses and deaths at Bundaberg
resulted from the subcutaneous injection of toxin-antitoxin mixture containing this organism
in considerable numbers. In Appendix 27, we have given reasons for thinking that on 27th
January, in an injection of two minims there were either (a) at least 130,000, or ( b ) 5,000,000
living staphylococci. These estimates are extremely conservative, (a) is based on the assumption
that Dr. Thomson was correct when he stated that the contents of the bottle were turbid on the
morning of 28th January, but clear on 27th January, when he made the injections, and (b) is
based on the probability that the bottle was contaminated on 24th January, as we think was
almost certainly the case.
Discussion. —In considering the clinical and pathological data in relation to these facts,
it must be borne in mind that, though some of the earlier bacteriologists injected staphylococci
into their subcutaneous tissues with striking local effects, there is not, within our knotdedge, any
previous experience of the results of the subcutaneous injection of large numbers of living staphylococci
into young children. The results of clinical experience of staphylococcal infections are not strictly
analogous to the cases under discussion. In the sudden dissemination of staphylococci from a
pre-existent focus which sometimes results in staphylococcal septicaemia and pyaemia, the
process is taking place in the body of an individual who has presumably acquired some degree
of immunity both local and general to the organism and its products. Such general staphylococcal
infections are rarely fatal in less than 48 hours though a few in which death occurs at about this
time have been described. They have an exceedingly high mortality, vide Osier’s Modern
Medicine 1925, Vol. 1., p. 547, where according to Jacob, the mortality for various infecting
organisms is given as staphylococcal, 88 per cent., streptococcal 83 per cent., pneumococcal
52 per cent., and due to the colon bacillus 41 per cent.
We ourselves have seen several rapidly fatal staphylococcal septicaemias in which collapse
and stupor or unconsciousness have been prominent features.
In the profound toxaemias produced in general staphylococcal and streptococcal infections,
the pulse tends to be rapid out of proportion to the temperature. This sign was characteristic of
the Bundaberg cases, but can only be regarded as the effect of toxin on the peripheral vascular
system or on the bulbar centres. The cerebral symptoms would accord well with fulminating
staphylococcal infection.
Instances are on record of rapid death in children following operative interference in
osteomyelitis with entry of staphylococci into the surrounding normal tissues.
We are indebted to Dr. Paterson, Superintendent of the Hospital for Sick Children,
Brisbane, for the following histories of acute staphylococcal osteomyelitis obtained from the
Hospital records of the last three years which illustrate how extremely rapid the course of fatal
cases of this kind may be :
C.P., male, aged two years. The child awoke this morning feverish and the
right knee was seen to be swollen and extremely tender to touch. He commenced
vomiting about ndd-day and the bowels have since been rather loose. He was admitted
at 9 p.m. At 10.5 p.m. the upper end ot the right tibia was explored and thin pus found
from which staphylococcus aureus was cultured. He died at 3.45 a.m. after an illness
of less than 24 hours.
E.N., male, aged eleven years and nine months. He had had slight pain in the
right knee for two days. This morning he was convulsed and since has been delirious.
An enema was returned with blood stained fluid and faeces. He was admitted at 11 p.m.
and operated on two hours later. The lower end of the right femur was explored and
a large amount of brown fluid pus obtained which yielded staphylococcus aureus on
culture. He died at 6 a.m.


W.D., male, aged two years and ten months. His illness began with convulsions
and vomiting last evening and continued this morning. He would not use his right
arm. He was wrongly diagnosed as infantile paralysis and left in the ward ten hours
before being seen by a Senior Surgeon and operated upon. The upper end of the right
humerus was explored and thin pus found from which staphylococcus aureus was
cultured. The child died shortly after operation.
Dr. Wanliss has examined for us the literature and the records of some hospitals for
fulminating cases of staphylococcal infection. These cases are rare, but by no means unknown.
A contributory cause to their rarity is that only a short time is available for investigation before
death, and that at autopsy no gross lesions are found. A certain number of these obscure cases
are met with in infants and children. The following cases in adults are worthy of particular
notice :
Cabello {Med. Ihera, 1925, p. 235 —cited by Herrick in Nelson’s loose-leaf Medicine,
December, 1925), reports a case of septicaemia due to staphylococcus aureus in a young man,
who died 48 hours after an operation for hernia. In this case it is noticeable that though
staphylococci were isolated from the wound and the heart blood no other lesions except
endarteritis of the femoral artery were found.
Yincenzi ( Deutsch. Medizin, Woch, 1906, p. 1039) records a case of acute infection which
was fatal within three days and which occurred in a healthy and strongly-built young man of
21. It originated in an acute lesion of the lower lip, which was mistaken for anthrax.
Staphylococcus pyogenes aureus was recovered in pure culture from a deep puncture of the tissues
underlying the lesion. Restlessness, extreme cyanosis, difficulty in breathing, delirium, pyrexia
(104 - 5° F.) and later collapse were the main clinical features. The most notable feature of this
case was that the organism unlike nearly all staphylococci recovered from acute fatal septicaemias
in man (which, according to this author, have only slight or no virulence for laboratory
animals) had a high degree of virulence. 01 c.cm. of broth culture (age not stated) injected
subcutaneously, killed mice with oedema spreading from the site of injection in eight to twelve
hours. The same dose killed guinea-pigs in two or three days with a similar haemorrhagic or
serous infiltration [vide Appendix 26). Rabbits of 1.5 K. were killed in - three days.
French (Guy’s Hospital Reports, LXIY., p. 343), describes the case of a woman, aged 33,
who died of acute staphylococcal infection on the third day without any lesions at autopsy other
than cloudy swelling of organs and subpleural and subdural petechiae. She had apparently
tried to open a whitlow in her thumb with a knitting needle. Her illness commenced with a rigor,
on the next day she vomited and developed a high temperature, 105° F. Twenty-four hours
from the onset she managed to walk to the hospital, but quickly became comatose, had slight
diarrhoea and died the following day. Blood culture on the third day and, at autopsy, cultures
of the spleen, heart blood and pericardium all yielded a pure staphylococcus aureus.
Let us consider what might happen following the introduction of large numbers of virulent
staphylococci into the subcutaneous tissues. Variations in the effects produced in individuals
would presumably depend either on the nature of their local resistance or on the degree of
susceptibility to the action of toxic substances produced by the organism.
If local resistance were weak, though some of the organisms at the site of injection might
be phagocyted, many would in the course of a few hours find their way through the lymph paths
in the vicinity and become widely spread in the lymphatics and tissue spaces. Multiplication
would ensue with only a short lag, particularly if the organisms were introduced at a favourable
stage of growth. Toxic substances would be produced which in a few hours would reach a
concentration sufficient to cause symptoms in an individual susceptible to their action. Some
organisms would also get into the bloodstream, but the toxic bodies would doubtless be produced
chiefly in the tissues. In resistant individuals many more organisms would be dealt with locally
by the phagocytes and the area of inoculation would be rapidly walled off with strong inflammatory
reaction. The organisms carried off in the lymphatics would possibly fail to multiply and
ultimately be destroyed. Production of toxic substances would be slower and more localized.
It is inconceivable that sufficient staphylococcal toxin could be produced in vitro in the
toxin-antitoxin mixture to account for the symptoms. Massive production of toxic substances
“ in vivo ” must have taken place in the fatal cases if staphylococci were the responsible agents.
The cases m which reactions were produced should have survived while in the fatal cases local
reaction should have been slight or unnoticeable. This appears to have been the case in the
Bundaberg fatalities. The lesions at autopsy would be those of an intense toxaemia, with
indications of lymphatic involvement, as indeed they were.


The post-mortem findings in the Bundaberg children are strictly in accord with toxaemia
death and are in no sense specific. Apart from cloudy swelling in the liver and kidneys, the
changes in the lymphatic system are the most distinctive. In the lymph glands at the root of
the lung and in the porta hepatis there are polymorph infiltration of the afferent lymphatic paths,
and conspicuous proliferation of the endothelium of the dilated lymph sinuses, the proliferating
cells exhibiting active phagocytosis. The malpighian corpuscles of the spleen also exhibit central
degenerative changes affecting lymphocytes and endothelial cells. There are no infarctions, but
the deaths occurred so rapidly that none could reasonably be expected to have occurred even
had septicaemia been present.
The thrombus from the inferior vena cava of J.P. (the only example examined by the
Commission) was unquestionably ante-mortem and possibly those described in the other cases
were of the same nature. We have found no evidence of endothelial damage in the walls of the
large veins in W.F. and T.R. in which the thrombi were described as being present.
We hesitate to draw conclusions from the distribution of the organisms in the blood and
tissues of the cases examined post-mortem. In the only case in which staphylococci were found
in abundance, other organisms were present which probably originated from the intestine and
gained access to the blood stream in the terminal stages of the illness or entered the vessels
post-mortem, though apparently unmistakable single and paired cocci were found in lymph
glands and spleen in this and other cases. Any deductions which might be drawn from their
presence in small numbers, even in suggestive surroundings, must necessarily be open to grave
suspicion owing to the fallacies involved in such, an examination.
Were it assumed that the deaths at Bundaberg occurred from fulminating staphylococcal
septicaemia, they should in theory have been spaced out over a longer period and in those
individuals who survived, the course of the disease should have been more prolonged and attended
by evidence of metastasis. The distribution of the deaths and the lengths of the illnesses in
the survivors at Bundaberg may be regarded as an expression of the degree of immunity of the
individuals at the time of inoculation. Apart from possible congenital differences, this should
show some correspondence with age. So far as we are aware there is no careful analysis of the
influence of this last factor in staphylococcal infections in childhood.
With the doubtful exception of the pleurisy in the case of W.S. and the equally
dubious abscess in the buttock in E.D., there were no metastases in the Bundaberg cases. Further,
in three of the survivors, blood cultures made on the fourth day, when, it is true, only one of these
children had pyrexia, and that of slight degree, were sterile. These facts make it clear that
staphylococci were not present in the blood of the survivors for any length of time.
There is, therefore, no evidence that any of the survivors had septicaemia, nor do we suggest
that this was necessarily the cause of death in the fatal cases. We present instead the hypothesis
that the deaths resulted from an overwhelming toxaemia at an early stage of the invasion of
the organism ; that in the survivors, staphylococci, if present in the blood stream at all, were few
in number and failed to multiply to any extent.
Whether or no there were septicaemia in the fatal cases we have no clear evidence upon
which to form an opinion. In only one case (M.Br.) at autopsy, 52| hours after death, was a
blood culture obtained. Only a few colonies of putrefactive organisms were found when the culture
was plated, but we are not inclined to lay any stress on this observation because we found organisms
in clot from cases autopsied at a much shorter period after death. The clot in the right auricle
in W.F. and the ante-mortem thrombus from the inferior vena cava of J.P. both contained large
numbers of cocci.
Possibly the negative findings recorded by Dr. Richards are explained by the fact that
most of the organisms present in the blood had become entangled in the clot.
'On the other hand it may be contended that the slowness of development and nature of
the abscesses in the survivors, together with the very slight symptoms attendant upon their
“ ripening,” point to the low pathogenicity of this organism for man. If it be assumed, upon
this wholly insufficient evidence, that the Bundaberg staphylococcus is a relatively harmless
organism capable only of producing a local lesion, the deaths at Bundaberg, which are so certainly
related to the injections, must have been due to the presence in the toxin-antitoxin mixture
either of an unknown toxic substance or of some living agent undemonstrable by the methods
we employed, the only criteria of whose presence are the results of injection into young human
beings. The absence of symptoms in children injected on occasions before the 27th January
must be held to demonstrate its absence from the mixture at those times and to suggest
that, like the staphylococcus, it was introduced during the course of the earlier inoculations.
Apart from the preconceived opinion that pyogenic staphylococci are incapable of causing
rapidly fatal results when injected in large numbers into young children, there is no necessity to
postulate such a hypothetical agent,


We are, therefore, of the opinion that the deaths at Bundaberg were caused by the injection
of living staphylococci in toxin-antitoxin mixture, a conclusion which rests in part upon negative
evidence, other possible causes of the disaster having been excluded.
Short of the unthinkable experiment of injecting living staphylococci into children, it is
not possible to offer rigid proof. The positive evidence is by itself suggestive rather than
conclusive and is briefly summed up as follows :
(1) Abscesses occurred at the site of the injection in all the surviving children who
were inoculated on 27th January at Bundaberg. From five which were
examined, staphylococci identical with those present in the original bottle were
recovered in pure culture.
(2) The symptoms exhibited by the children who died conformed to the general
picture of fulminating staphylococcal infections.
(3) The post-mortem findings in the children who died are compatible with extremely
rapid death from an infecting organism.
(4) The staphylococcus in question is capable when grown “in vitro ” for eight hours of
yielding a toxin which produces positive and specific skin tests in a dilution
of lin 2,000 in susceptible individuals. Further, the reactions are intensified
when the organism has been grown in media to which human blood has been
added. Only a proportion of the individuals tested are susceptible to the
toxin even in high concentrations.
(5) Cultures of the Bundaberg staphylococcus in toxin antitoxin mixture exhibit
variations in activity when injected into animals at varying times which fit
the observed facts in regard to this tragedy.
There are the following difficulties in accepting this view :
(1) Staphylococcal infections are generally local and when septicaemia occurs it is
usually less rapidly fatal than were the cases at Bundaberg. (Natural infections
with staphylococci on account of the small numbers of organisms usually
introduced do not provide a parallel case and consequently clinical evidence
that staphylococci do not usually cause death in so short a time cannot be held
to exclude this possibility.)
(2) From clinical experience it might be predicted that had the children at
Bundaberg died from fulminating staphylococcal infection, the cases which
recovered should have shown definite metastatic abscesses. (There are only
the doubtful abscess in E.D. and the pleurisy in W.S.).
(3) The absence of gross lesions at the autopsies apart from ante-mortem thrombi
in the great vessels might be held to exclude staphylococcal septicaemia, save
that the time from the onset of symptoms to death was too short for lesions
to be produced. (Instances of acute staphylococcal septicaemia are quoted in
the text in which no lesions were found at autopsy ; similarly rabbits dying
rapidly after intra venous injection may show no lesions. (Appendix 23.)).
(4) In the single autopsy 52f hours after death, staphylococci were not recovered from
the blood culture. Sterile blood cultures were also obtained on the third
and fourth days in children who recovered,
(5) The relative non-virulence of the organism to laboratory animals with the
exception of rabbits. (This finding is common, according to Vincenzi, in acute
staphylococcal infections.)
Looking at the unfortunate accident at Bundaberg as a crucial experiment on the infectivity
and virulence towards young children of staphylococcus aureus growing in a fluid medium, we
are not aware of any precedent or of any parallel experiment. On some day between 17th
and 24th January—and most probably on the 24th—the bottle of toxin-antitoxin became
contaminated by the Bundaberg staphylococcus. It was incubated for at least three days at
Bundaberg temperatures, and on the 27th eight children received subcutaneously four minims,
of whom six died and two were ill, but recovered, afterwards developing local abscesses, and
also thirteen received two minims, of whom six died, four were ill and afterwards developed
local abscesses and three were not ill, but developed abscesses. The disastrous result of this
fortuitous experiment is not what we ourselves would have expected, and will doubtless occasion
surprise and possibly controversy, but we have found ourselves gradually driven to this verdict
by the accumulation of evidence, both positive and negative, incomplete though it be. Owing
to the absence of bacteriological investigations during the acute illness and the very inadequate
post-mortem examinations, we cannot assert that an overwhelming septicaemia occurred in the
fatal cases.


The variations in susceptibility disclosed at Bundaberg, viz., from death in sixteen hours
to a local abscess are almost paralleled in natural human diseases, e.g., diphtheria, pneumonia,
epidemic influenza. We have said “ almost ” because there are two striking differences between
most natural infections and the Bundaberg cases. They are the extremely short incubation
period and the rapid progress to a fatal issue. We have, however, adduced a reason for these
differences. Our hypothesis demands that a very large number of organisms was directly
introduced into the subcutaneous tissues of extremely susceptible, partially susceptible, and almost
insusceptible children. An incompletely sterilized needle introduces but a few organisms and
an abscess may result. An accidental wound or an operation area is contaminated with but a
few organisms and sepsis may result. In these instances there is time for the development of
the local immune mechanism. But the sudden introduction of a large number, in all probability
several millions according to our conservative calculations, would be received by unprepared
subcutaneous tissues, and it is inconceivable that some would not within a very short time reach
the general circulation. Whether a temporary bacteriaemia or a septicaemia would result might
then depend, not on the local immune mechanism, but on “ humoral ” immunity.
The Source of the Contamination. —We have attempted to ascertain the source of the
contamination in Dr. Thomson’s bottle. All the unopened bottles of toxin antitoxin without
added antiseptic (Batches 78a and 86) which we examined have been perfectly free from any
turbidity and all those which we have cultured have proved to be sterile (Appendix 16). There
can be no suggestion that the contamination had already occurred when the bottle in question
left the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories in November. We are thoroughly satisfied with
the technique of filling and with the checks upon the sterility of the biological products issued
from the Laboratories. Thorough inspection for cracks in the containers and for specks or
particles suggestive of possible air-borne contamination is made and any ampoule or bottle of
which there is any suspicion is discarded. Neither is there any question that when Dr. Thomson’s
bottle reached him on 7th January, it was still uncontaminated and indeed, according to
Dr. Thomson’s evidence, the contents remained clear till the evening of 27th January. In the
meanwhile it was stored in a cupboard in his surgery and remained in its carton unopened till
17th January. It was used for inoculations on the 17th, 20th, 21st, 24th, and 27th and between
these times of use it was stored in the doctor’s surgery at a temperature which probably varied
between 70° and 80° Fah. (Appendix 7). It is certain that contamination occurred on one of
these occasions when toxin-antitoxin mixture was being withdrawn from it.
Dr. Thomson’s Technique. —We have inquired into Dr. Thomson’s technique in withdrawing
samples for inoculation and in addition he has been good enough to demonstrate his method for
us in the room where most of the inoculations were done (Appendix 3).
This demonstration, carried out on the afternoon of 15th February, consisted in the
withdrawal of two samples of 1 . 0 c.cm. of toxin-antitoxin mixture from two bottles of Batch 78a
and one of Batch 86 (containing no antiseptic). We find that there are two ways in which
contamination may have occurred.
As described in Appendix 3, Dr. Thomson, after thoroughly scrubbing his hands with
soap and water, fixed the needle to the nozzle of the syringe, picking it out of sterile water with
his fingers instead of carrying out this operation with a pair of sterile forceps. The contact of
Dr. Thomson’s fingers with the water in which the needles were allowed to lie, in order to remove
the methylated spirit in which they had been sterilized, gave opportunity for the contamination
of this water and hence of later needles withdrawn from it.
Air Contamination. —The second possibility of contamination arises from the fact that it
is not possible to withdraw material satisfactorily from rubber-capped bottles without first
admitting a corresponding quantity of air. When the air in the room is still, it is possible with
rigid technique to withdraw samples or introduce air into the bottles of toxin-antitoxin mixture
without contaminating them. If the air in the room is in motion, as it was as a result of the
use of a fan on all the occasions when Dr. Thomson carried out inoculations and when he
demonstrated his technique for us, even with rigid technique it is impossible to avoid contamination
(Appendix 4). Of the three bottles in the experiment Dr. Thomson made for us two were
contaminated, one containing the only staphylococcus recovered from any of our air contamination
experiments or in the examination of partly used bottles of toxin-antitoxin mixture which at all
resembles the Bundaberg staphylococcus.
On our return to Melbourne we carried out a further experiment in which we used a powerful
fan to cause air movement and injected large quantities of air so as to provide every opportunity
for air contamination. We used two sets of bottles of toxin-antitoxin mixture, one with, and one
without, antiseptic. In this way we successfully contaminated all of four bottles containing
no antiseptic, but bottles containing antiseptic subjected to similar treatment have remained


perfectly clear and we have not been able to recover any organism from them by culture. Further,
our attempts to grow the Bundaberg organism in toxin-antitoxin mixture containing antiseptic
have invariably failed, even when heavy inocula have been used.
It is certain then that when antiseptic is present in the mixture the possibility of air-borne
contamination, the only serious possibility with good technique, is eliminated.
We have no clear evidence as to whether Dr. Thomson’s bottle was infected by air
contamination or by contamination of the water in which the needles were immersed. We think
the latter is the most probable explanation as far as the staphylococcus is concerned, since
serologically it is unrelated to the common air-borne cocci which we obtained in several of our
air contamination experiments.
The Withdrawal of the Sample from Dr. Thomson's Bottle. —At this stage it is important
to discuss the question of the withdrawal of a sample from Dr. Thomson’s bottle of toxin-antitoxin
mixture, admittedly already turbid, by Dr. McKeon on 28th January. This was done with a
sterile syringe and needle, but the top of the rubber cap was not sterilized. It may be argued
that this in itself vitiates our examination of the residual contents of the Bundaberg bottle.
The bacteriological examination of the contents of the original bottle and of the sample
withdrawn by Dr. McKeon showed that both contained a staphylococcus identical with that
isolated from the abscesses at the site of inoculation in the survivors. As far as the case against
this staphylococcus is concerned, therefore, the omission by Dr. McKeon to sterilize the top of
the bottle does not in the least affect our conclusions.
Since we were not able to grow any other living organism, pathogenic or otherwise, either
from the contents of the original bottle or the portion withdrawn, the faulty technique of the
withdrawal of the sample is without significance.
Investigation of other partly-used Bottles. —The use by other medical practitioners of material
of Batch 86 is of importance in the present inquiry. In Appendix 17 we have recorded the results
of testing the contents of a number of partly used rubber-capped containers of this batch, together
with the manner in which the material was used. It will be observed that a number of capable
practitioners used them in the same way as did Dr. Thomson, making injections on more than
one occasion at varying intervals of time from the same bottle. This practice doubtless arose
from the fact that vaccines containing antiseptic are commonly so used. With the exception
of vaccines which are specifically prepared for use on a number of occasions, biological products
should, however, be used up as rapidly as possible after opening them, and the unused balance,
if any, discarded. A fortiori, in a tropical or sub-tropical climate this rule should be observed,
since the growth of any organisms accidentally introduced may be rapid.
The Absence of Antiseptic in Batch 86. Narrative re the Warning Notice. —When
Dr. Morgan, Director of the Laboratories Division, Commonwealth Health Department, decided
to avoid the possible risks attendant upon freezing toxin-antitoxin mixture, by leaving out the
antiseptic, his intention was that all future samples of the product should be issued in sealed
glass ampoules to avoid any risk of further use of the mixture after it had been opened and possibly
contaminated. This method of putting up the product is somewhat inconvenient for use when
large numbers of injections are to be given at one time. Requests were made to Dr. Morgan
for rubber-capped containers of the mixture for this purpose. Batch 78, the first batch made
up without antiseptic, was issued only in sealed glass ampoules. It was ready for issue on the
25th August, 1927. The next two batches, 86 and 78a, were bottled on the 10th October, and
the 28th November, 1927. Both were put up partly in ampoules and partly in rubber-capped
containers. Dr. Morgan was careful to warn Dr. Hilda Bull, who was doing large scale
immunization for the Melbourne City Council, and who had specifically asked for rubber-capped
bottles, that the mixture would shortly be issued without antiseptic and, therefore, should be
used up at once, any unused material being discarded.
The first issue of Batch 86 was of 24 rubber-capped containers to the Commonwealth
Health Department, Brisbane, and was made in response to an emergency order on 12th October,
1927. On about 22nd or 23rd November, 1927, Dr. Morgan decided that it was advisable to
warn specifically practitioners using this product, that it contained no antiseptic and must not
be used on a number of separate occasions like a vaccine. This notice was printed and ready
for enclosure with the rubber-capped containers of Batch 78a on 19th December, 1927. Between
30th November and 19th December, 1927, a typewritten copy of the notice was sent out wrapped
round every package and fixed with a rubber band.
In the meanwhile in response to a request for rubber-capped bottles in exchange for
ampoules in stock at the Brisbane Office, Dr. Morgan sent a copy of this notice to Dr. Elkington
on 25th November, 1927, with a covering letter which unfortunately did not make it clear that


the second issue of thirty rubber-capped bottles of Batch 86 and eighteen rubber-capped bottles
of Batch 78a, sent off to the Brisbane Office on 29th November, 1927, would not contain this
warning notice, which was not yet available in printed form. From the last sentence of
Dr. Morgan’s letter (Appendix 15), Dr. Elkington justifiably drew the conclusion that future issues
of the material would contain the warning notice inside the carton. Dr. Elkington gave
instructions that mimeographed copies of this circular were to be issued with all the accounts
in December to firms who retailed the products and to any medical practitioner who purchased
directly, but in view of Dr. Morgan’s letter did not consider it necessary to circularize the
medical profession in Queensland.
The only issues directly from the Divisional Office, Brisbane, after Dr. Morgan’s letter
was received, were to the Murgon Shire Council (material presumably used by Dr. Eandall). The
remainder were made through Queensland Druggists Ltd. (Dr. Green and Dr. Reye’s bottles),
and through Medical and Surgical Requisites Ltd. (Dr. Thomson’s bottle). Though the firm of
Taylor and Elliotts and Doctors McLean and Earnshaw received a typewritten copy of the warning
notice early in January, 1928, the Manager of Medical and Surgical Requisites Ltd., Brisbane,
denied having received it from the Commonwealth Health Department, Divisional Office, Brisbane,
and in any case it is clear that it was not transmitted to Dr. Thomson.
History of Diphtheria. —ln his evidence before the Commission Dr. Cumpston sketched
the history of diphtheria in Australia and made some important comments on the problem of
its control. In general the death rates from diphtheria in the various States were already declining
before the introduction of antitoxin in 1895, though notification indicates that the disease is
still active in the community. The diphtheria death rate after 1890 shows a general parallelism
with the birth rate. Tracing a correspondence between immigration rate and diphtheria
incidence, with the experience of Western Australia in the years following the gold discoveries
as a striking example, Dr. Cumpston suggests as potent factors in the influence of immigration
on diphtheria incidence, the disturbance of the composition of the population in its adaptation
to the disease, the increase of births and improved means of communication. He points out
that the period 1921 to 1931 promises to show the greatest influx of population as yet experienced
in Australia, which, in spite of the declining birth rate, is likely to cause a definite activity of
diphtheria over several years.
The value of active immunization as a prophylactic against diphtheria is a question of
public health which does not come strictly within the scope of this inquiry.
The fatalities at Bundaberg occurred incidentally in the early stages of a campaign of
active immunization against diphtheria. This was a public measure carried out on medical
advice necessarily based on experience gained in other countries. In Australia, immunization
has been limited in scope and confined to institutions, to sporadic municipal ventures, and to
private prophylaxis. No authoritative pronouncement can, therefore, be made from evidence
gained from Australian sources alone.
It should be emphasized that active immunization is the only specific measure at present known
for the control of the incidence of the disease, and that there is no inherent danger in its practice
when properly controlled.
FINDINGS.
1. The injections of toxin-antitoxin mixture administered by Dr. Thomson at Bundaberg
on 27th January, 1928, were responsible for the deaths of twelve out of twenty-one children
inoculated and for the illness of several who survived.
2. The toxin-antitoxin mixture as issued by the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories was
properly prepared and sterile, but contained no antiseptic and, therefore, did not prevent the
growth of micro-organisms accidentally introduced into it.
3. The rubber-capped bottle of toxin-antitoxin supplied to Dr. Thomson at Bundaberg
was accompanied by no information as to the presence or absence of antiseptic.
4. The omission of antiseptic was intended to safeguard against the dangers attendant
upon freezing, but the issue of this preparation without antiseptic in rubber-capped bottles
suitable for repeated usage is an unsound procedure.
5. The toxin-antitoxin mixture in the bottle used by Dr. Thomson was contaminated by
him with a pathogenic staphylococcus during a series of inoculations on 17th, 20th, 21st and 24th
January, most probably on the last occasion.
6. The consideration of all the available evidence concerning the deaths at Bundaberg
points to the injection of living staphylococci as the cause of the fatalities.


RECOMMENDATIONS.
1. That biological products in which the growth of pathogenic organisms is possible
should not be issued in rubber-capped containers for repeated use unless there is present in
the material a sufficient concentration of antiseptic to inhibit bacterial growth.
2. That all biological products not containing antiseptic, however issued, should bear a
conspicuous printed notice, both on the container and on the package, to the effect that no
antiseptic is present; that they should be used immediately on opening, and any remaining
product discarded.
3. That biological products, should be distributed in bottles or ampoules of clear glass in
which it is easier for the medical practitioner himself to detect turbidity or any other defect,
4. That the Commonwealth Department of Health should make full and careful enquiry
as to whether it be advisable to substitute anatoxin or some similarly modified immunizing agent
for toxin-antitoxin.
5. To ensure the adoption of the most approved technique, facilities for special
post-graduate training should be afforded to all medical officers entrusted with the conduct of
public campaigns to diminish the incidence of disease by immunization.
In concluding this report we desire to acknowledge the courtesy and assistance we have
received from individuals, officials and institutions in the course of this enquiry. We wish to
record our appreciation of the assistance rendered to us, particularly in making materials
available, by the Director-General of Health of the Commonwealth and the Director of the

APPENDIX 2.
DESCRIPTION OF THE ROOM IN WHICH INJECTIONS WERE PERFORMED BY
DR. THOMSON AND WHERE EXPERIMENTS ON AIR CONTAMINATION WERE
CARRIED OUT BY THE COMMISSION.
This room, the Engineer’s Office, which is placed at the rear of the Council Chambers,
away from the main street, has one door and one window on the northern aspect. (Fig. 1). A
third window was not obvious from the interior as the western end of the room was occupied by
stretchers piled up to the roof and harbouring a good deal of dust. The door and northern window
look out on a small grass covered yard at the rear of the building which is continued on its eastern
side, but which is not open to the street. Entry is effected to the room through the Council
Chambers.
The room has a concrete floor 12 x 18 feet, but only about two-thirds of this space was
available, as the stretchers and other oddments stored there were not disturbed when it was cleaned
out for Dr. Thomson’s use. A table and two chairs occupied the central space (Figs. 2 and 3), and
there was also a high stool on which the basin “B” stood. Along the eastern wall was a long
desk “ M.” The chair seen in the photograph (Fig. 3) is the one at which the doctor sat.

APPENDIX 3.
DEMONSTRATION BY DR. E. G. THOMSON OF THE METHODS USED BY HIM IN
WITHDRAWING TOXIN-ANTITOXIN MIXTURE FROM RUBBER-CAPPED
BOTTLES.
On 15th February, Dr. Thomson and his nurse arranged the furniture in the Engineer’s
room at the Municipal Chambers as it had been on 27th January, and laid out on a small table
covered with a clean sheet the apparatus used for inoculations in approximately the positions
which they occupied when the inoculations were performed there. Part of the interior of the room
and the arrangement of the table and the objects on it are shown in the photograph taken at
4 p.m. immediately before Dr. Thomson’s demonstration to the Commission (see Figs. 2 and 3).
The door was widely open and the north window in its lower half, as on 27th January, and the
preceding occasions when inoculations were performed. The position of the fan on the table is
shown in the photograph. It was in action during the procedures to be described, as it was on
all the occasions when Dr. Thomson performed inoculations. The draught from it blew directly
across the far end of the table and not over that portion where the materials for inoculation were
laid out.
At 4.10 p.m., in the presence of the Chairman and Nurse I. G. Currey, Dr. Thomson drew
off two successive samples of 1 c.cm. from each of three rubber-capped bottles of batches 78a
and 86 which contained no antiseptic.
His technique was briefly as follows :
The syringe and needles, enclosed in their metal case, were brought over from
Dr. Thomson’s rooms where they had been, sterilized, by boiling for fifteen minutes and the
needles, four in number, were now placed in the vessel “ A ” in methylated spirits.
The syringe was a 1 c.cm. glass and metal “ Record ” graduated in tenths of a c.cm. and in
minims and the needles used were four in number. The syringe and needles were those recently
used by Dr. Thomson, and in the intervening period examined by the Commission (Appendix 5).
Dr. Thomson first scrubbed his hands with soap and water in the basin “ B,” using a nail
brush and drying them on a freshly laundered hand towel. He then transferred the needles
from methylated spirits in “ A ” to the kidney dish “ D ” containing boiled water from the bottle
“ C.” This was done by hand. A needle was now taken from the water also by hand and fitted
to the syringe, water being expelled from the syringe and needle by forcing down the piston.
Air was now drawn into the syringe. The centre of the rubber cap had been moistened with
iodine solution from an iodine “ pencil ” (I.), and now the needle was passed through this part
of the rubber cap, air was forced into the bottle and a sample of toxin-antitoxin mixture was
withdrawn. This was expelled from the syringe, the needle was placed in the methylated spirits
:n vessel “ A ” and a fresh needle was taken by hand from the kidney dish “ D ” and fitted to the
nozzle of the syringe. Air was again taken into the syringe and the procedure was repeated.
When the needles had all been used once they were taken from the methylated spirits in which
they had been immersed for two minutes or so, and replaced in the kidney dish “ D ” in water.
From this the needles necessary to complete the experiment were taken.
Each of three bottles, therefore, had inoculated into it 2 c.cm. of air in order to withdraw
the corresponding amount of toxin-antitoxin mixture.
The bottles were not incubated but kept packed in cotton wool in a closed wooden box,
which was kept in a closed suit case and in this way were maintained at approximately the
temperature of Bundaberg for a few days.
The subsequent history of these three rubber-capped bottles is as follows :
T. 1. No turbidity after two days—sterile when tested by culture after a week. Guinea
pigs inoculated each with 1.0 c.cm. on the fourth and seventh days showed no infiltration and
survived.
T. 2. Turbid after two days—sub-culture by plating on blood agar on the seventh day
showed the presence of a faintly haemolytic staphylococcus albus which Dr. Burnet, of the Hall
Institute, was able to show did not correspond to the organism isolated from the fatal bottle, also
a non-haemolytic staphylococcus albus and a Gram-negative cocco-bacillus. Guinea pigs
inoculated with 1.0 c.cm. of the mixture on the fourth and seventh days showed no infiltration
and survived.
T. 3. was also turbid after two days and from it on the seventh day a faintly haemolytic
staphylococcus albus like that in T 2 was isolated. Guinea pig experiments on the fourth
and seventh days were negative.

ATR CONTAMINATION EXPERIMENTS CARRIED OUT AT BUNDABERG.
These experiments were performed in the Engineer’s Room at the Council Chamber
using rubber-capped bottles of batch 78a.
Into each of these bottles air in varying amounts was injected, using syringes and needles
which had been sterilized by boiling in water for 25 minutes. The sterilization was performed
at the Hospital, and the syringes were transported in a closed aluminium saucepan in which
they had been boiled. The syringes were fitted together in the saucepan with forceps sterilized
by flaming. Two injections were made into each bottle through the liquid, the needle being
plunged to the bottom of the container through the top of the rubber cap which had been sterilized
either by pouring methylated spirits into the cavity and burning it out with the flame of a spirit
lamp or by the use of Dr. Thomson’s iodine “ pencil.”
After bubbling the air through the toxin-antitoxin mixture, the needle was withdrawn
out of the liquid and the excess of air in the bottle removed by withdrawing the piston. The
needle was now withdrawn from the bottle, the air emptied out of the syringe, and a fresh sample
taken into it. The rubber cap was once again punctured and the procedure described above was
repeated.
After inoculating the bottles with air in this manner, they were kept at room temperature
packed in cotton wool in a closed box, which was placed inside a suit case. They were examined
at Brisbane on the 16th February for turbidity, and again at Sydney on the 19th February. A
guinea pig was inoculated on this latter date with 1 c.cm. from each of those bottles which
showed any trace of turbidity.
On the 22nd February, 1928, at Melbourne, guinea pigs were injected with I c.cm. from all
the bottles used in the experiment, and subcultures on blood agar were made at the same time.
In carrying out the experiments at Bundaberg, the north window and the door of the
room were kept open. In some experiments the fan was “on ” and in others, when the fan was
“ off ” the air in tire room was not perfectly still owing to a slight breeze.
The bottles were inoculated at varying times on the 13th and 14th February. Altogether
six bottles were inoculated with the fan “ off ” and the air in the room perfectly still; seven at
times when there was a slight wind blowing in from the north through the open window and door,
and eleven when the fan was working, placed in a similar position in regard to the bottles which
were being inoculated as that which it occupied during Dr. Thomson’s inoculations.
No toxicity was developed in any of the bottles as judged by the results of inoculations
in guinea pigs, none of which showed any infiltration at the site of inoculation or any serious
loss of weight except F 5, inoculated on the 19th February, which died on the fifteenth day. No
definite lesions were found at autopsy and the heart blood was sterile.
The results of these experiments are set out in tabular form together with a summary of
results.

It will be noted that of six bottles inoculated when the air in the room was still, none were
contaminated, but of seven inoculated when the fan was not working and when there was a mild
breeze blowing, one was contaminated, and of eleven inoculated with the fan in action, six were
proved to be contaminated. Variable amounts of air were injected, as will be seen in the table,
and all seven contaminated bottles in the experiments had had a larger amount of air passed
through them.
In Melbourne, on the Bth March, 1928, we made a further smaller experiment, in which
we studied the effect of the presence of o's per cent, phenol in preventing air borne contamination.
Eight rubber-capped bottles, four of batch 78a, containing no antiseptic, and four of batch
111, containing o‘s per cent, phenol were inoculated each with 10 c.cm. of air. The syringes and
needles were sterilized by boiling in water for twenty-five minutes, and the top of the rubber-
capped bottles were sterilized with tincture of iodine. Air from a large fan was blowing directly
on to the bench while the inoculations were being carried out.
The bottles were incubated at 26 -6° C. for eighteen days and at the end of this period
those which contained phenol were still perfectly clear. All four bottles of batch 78a were turbid
by the fourth day, one being only very slightly so. On 13th March, 1928, subcultures of 0-2 c.cm.
from each bottle were made into 10 c.cm. of broth and stroke cultures of the turbid bottles on


agar plates, one loopful only being used. The subcultures from the bottles of batch 111,
containing antiseptic showed no growth even after incubation for eight days at 37°. Those from
the bottles without antiseptic all showed growth in 24 hours, and stroke cultures on agar plates
gave numerous colonies in three, but only a few in the fourth.
The results of subculture on agar plates are summarized below —
Bottle 1. Many white colonies of staphylococci.
„ 2. Many yellow colonies of staphylococci and white colonies like those of 3.
„ 3. Staphylococci forming large flat white colonies with wavy margins.
Many colonies.
„ 4. Four yellowish colonies of tetracocci, one mould and three large colonies
like those of 3.
It is evident that the presence of antiseptic, despite statements given in evidence
to the contrary, is of considerable value in preventing air-borne contamination—a result which
is in accord with experience in the use of vaccines containing antiseptic.
We attempted also to grow the Bundaberg staphylococcus (Appendix 18) in bottles of
batch 111 containing 0-5 per cent, phenol, but were unable to do so, using small inoculations
which readily produce growths in rubber-capped bottles without antiseptic.


APPENDIX 5.
EXAMINATION OF THE RECORD SYRINGE AND NEEDLES USED BY
DR. E. G. THOMSON AT BUNDABERG.
.These were received in their metal case on 7th February. The glass barrel was somewhat
cloudy looking. There were six (6) needles, four (4) marked R.S. (rustless steel), two (2) with no
such marking. One (1) R.S. needle had no stylet in it, three (3) R.S. needles and the other two
contained stylets.
A special examination was immediately carried out. Another sterile syringe fitted with
a needle was taken and sterile saline drawn in and out several times, and then a little saline was
drawn up, the plunger drawn backwards and forwards several times and the fluid ejected on to
a slide.
The Bundaberg syringe was fitted together and the same needle as above (after being
washed out again with the other syringe) fitted to it, a minute amount of saline drawn up and
the inside of the barrel washed with it. It became obviously turbid and was ejected into a sterile
watch glass. A film of this was made and a stroke culture on plain agar. Saline was then drawn
up into the syringe and ejected numerous times, the barrel becoming cleaner looking except a
small section near the needle end which remained cloudy.
The needle without stylet, called needle No. 1, was then taken and the Hall Institute
syringe fitted to it. A minute amount of saline was drawn up and ejected numerous times on
to a sterile watch glass. The saline became markedly cloudy and flocculation occurred later in
the watch glass. A film and culture were also made from this fluid.
All the other needles, Nos. 2to 6, were treated in the same way. Only one gave a turbid
washing and this was much less turbid than No. 1 needle.
Examination of the films in all cases showed only debris and no organisms. The cultures
from the syringe and needle No. 1 gave no growth.
At the time these results were puzzling, but they became explicable after evidence was
taken at Bundaberg. Evidence on oath was given that Dr. Thomson’s nurse boiled the syringe
and needles after their use on 27th January, and that subsequent to the fatalities Dr. McKeon
removed a small amount from the bottles with this same syringe, transferred it to a small phial
and then plunged the syringe and needle into methylated spirits. Hence the turbidity of the
washings from the syringe and one needle. No explanation is forthcoming for the slight turbidity
of the washings from one other needle.


APPENDIX 6,
EXAMINATION OF THE BOILED RAIN-WATER USED BY DR. E. G. THOMSON
ON THE 27TH JANUARY, 1928.
The water used by Dr. Thomson in his inoculations was obtained from a cylindrical,
concrete-lined galvanized iron tank of 800 gallons capacity, which received rain-water draining
from the roof of his house by two open gutters.
The water in the bottle which had been left unchanged from the 27th January to the 13th
February, 1928, when it was examined, was inoculated in doses of -5 c.cm. and 1 c.cm. into two
bottles, one of batch 86 and the other of batch 78a.
In both cases marked turbidity was evident on the 17th February and culture on the 22nd
February demonstrated the growth of staphylococci forming white colonies which were shown
later on not to be identical with the Bundaberg staphylococcus isolated from the bottle of toxin-
antitoxin mixture from which Dr. Thomson made the injections on the 27th January, 1928.
These water staphylococci were larger than pyogenic staphylococci, and did not agglutinate with
the sera of rabbits immunized with the Bundaberg staphylococcus.
Guinea pigs were inoculated from each of these bottles with a dose of 1 c.cm. subcutaneously
on the 19th and 22nd February. The injections produced no ill effects.

APPENDIX 7.
THE TEMPERATURE AT WHICH DR. E. G. THOMSON’S BOTTLE OF TOXIN-
ANTITOXIN MIXTURE WAS STORED.
The bottle of toxin-antitoxin mixture was kept in a closed glass instrument cupboard in
Dr. Thomson’s surgery and we were only able to arrive indirectly at the temperature at which it
had been kept by getting Dr. Thomson to keep a record of maximum and minimum temperatures
in the instrument case itself for nine consecutive days in the month of February. The
thermometer which was used was corrected for us by Mr. F. H. Holden, of the Walter and Eliza
Hall Institute, Melbourne. The temperatures observed by Dr. Thomson and the corrected
temperatures are given below, together with the official Bundaberg temperatures observed
at the Post Office during the two periods, 17th January to 27th January, and 20th February to
28th February. These last we obtained through the courtesy of Mr. H. A. Hunt, the
Commonwealth Meteorologist.
TABLE showing the Maximum and Minimum Temperatures between 20th February and 28th February,
OBSERVED AND CORRECTED IN THE CUPBOARD IN Dr. THOMSON’S SURGERY, TOGETHER WITH THE OFFICIAL
Temperatures recorded at the Post Office, Bundaberg, on the Same Days and during the Period
of Storage of the Bottle of Toxin-Antitoxin after its First Use on 17th January, 1928.
The temperature in the cupboard will be seen to have been remarkably constant, and in
all probability the mean maximum and mean minimum temperatures between 17th January
and 27th January did not differ appreciably from 79° and 72° F.
For the period 23rd January to 27th January, the mean official maximum and minimum
Bundaberg temperatures were 86° and 68° F., and in our experimental attempts to produce toxicity
in samples of toxin-antitoxin mixtures we have, therefore, used an incubator set at 80° F.


APPENDIX 8.
THE TREATMENT OF THE CASES, AND TEMPERATURE CHARTS FROM THE
BUNDABERG GENERAL HOSPITAL.
Since the response of the sick children to treatment of various kinds might possibly have
some bearing on the problem of diagnosis, we have summarized it briefly here. Cases 2,8, 9
and 10 which presented no symptoms did not receive any immediate treatment.
Diphtheria antitoxin, 4,000 units intramuscularly, was given in cases 3,4, 5, 12,14,15, 16
and 19 which died, and in cases 6,7, and 13 which recovered. No antitoxin was administered
in cases 1, 11, 18 and 20 which died and in cases 17 and 21 which recovered. Had the
symptoms been due to the injection of free diphtheria toxin, much larger doses administered
intravenously would have been indicated, and it is doubtful whether at the stage at which
the treatment was given even this would have saved any lives. Dr. Hains, however,
was concerned only with the possibility that a lack of balance between toxin and antitoxin in
the immunizing injections might be a contributory cause of the illnesses. He was of the opinion
that the administration of antitoxin had no influence whatever on the outcome.
Adrenaline in doses of 2 and 3 minims of 1 in 1,000 was given in a number of the cases.
Apart from a temporary response to a dose of 5 minims obtained by Dr. McKeon in Case 19,
the administration of adrenaline does not appear to have had any favorable result.
Atropine in doses from 1/150 to 1/200 grain with or without morphine 1/24 grain was
given in most of the cases. There is no clear evidence that this treatment was of any value.
Oxygen was administered in most of the fatal cases and appeared to have but little effect
on the cyanosis.
Digitalis was administered in a number of the cases and in Case 15, Dr. Hains thought it
caused some temporary improvement. On the whole it was without effect.
The general treatment in most cases was the application of cold compresses to the head,
sips of water to drink and frequent sponges, bowel washouts, enemata and purgatives. These
measures appear to have been of value in the less seriously ill cases.
In Case 16 an attempt was made to control the convulsions with chloroform. This was
without avail and was not persisted in.

APPENDIX 9.
DETAILED NARRATIVE OF EVENTS IN RELATION TO THE REQUEST OF THE
MAYOR OF BUNDABERG FOR A PATHOLOGIST.
Action taken at Bundaberg to procure a Pathologist. —Dr. E. T. K. Schmidt, during the
morning of 28th January, 1928, notified the Senior Sergeant of Police at Bundaberg that he
was not prepared to give a death certificate in the case of W.F., who had been brought to his
surgery, already dead. An autopsy was conducted on the body of this child at 3 p.m. At
about this time Dr. I. C. Plains, the Medical Superintendent of the Bundaberg General
Hospital, where several deaths had already occurred, telephoned to the Senior Sergeant of Police
at Bundaberg and intimated that he was not prepared to give certificates of death. Subsequently,
the Sergeant telephoned the Medical Superintendent that his instructions from the Inspector of
Police, Maryborough, were that post-mortem examinations were to be conducted by the
Government Medical Officer (Dr. E. T. K. Schmidt). The Medical Superintendent then
communicated with the Chairman of the Hospital Board and the Mayor of Bundaberg, and with
their concurrence an urgent telegram was despatched at 5 p.m. to the Home Secretary, Brisbane,
informing him of the disaster.
At about 6 p.m. the Mayor attempted to get in touch with the Home Secretary by telephone
but was unable to do so. He then communicated with the Inspector of Police, Brisbane, and
asked that the Home Secretary should be requested to send a pathologist by special train that
evening to help the Government Medical Officer.
Subsequently, the police stated that they had been unable to locate the Home Secretary,
but had communicated with the Under-Secretary of the Home Department, Mr. Gall, who was
taking up the matter with Dr. J. S. C. Elkington, Director, Division of Tropical Hygiene,
Commonwealth Department of Health, Brisbane.
On Sunday morning, 29th January, at 10 o’clock, the Mayor had a telephone conversation
with the Home Secretary at his residence. The Mayor suggested the advisability of sending a
competent pathologist by aeroplane. The Home Secretary said it was a Commonwealth matter,
but that he would do everything possible. He later telephoned that Dr. Elkington, of the
Commonwealth Department of Health, was arranging for Dr. G. A. Murray, a Quarantine Officer
of the Commonwealth Department of Health, Brisbane, to leave for Bundaberg by the train on
Sunday, the 29th January, and that Dr. R. E. Richards, of the Commonwealth Health Laboratory,
Rockhampton, was also coming to Bundaberg.
State Action taken at Brisbane, re Pathologist. —At 6 a.m. on Sunday morning, the 29th
January, the Home Secretary had a conversation with Dr. J. I. Moore, Commissioner of Public
Health, Queensland, and inquired whether he had received any intimation relative to the fatalities
at Bundaberg. He replied that he had and that he had already been in communication with
Dr. Elkington, and suggested that, as the matter was a Commonwealth concern, Dr. Elkington
should make all inquiries. At 10 a.m. the Home Secretary spoke on the telephone to the Mayor
of Bundaberg, who requested that a pathologist should be sent by special train or aeroplane to
Bundaberg. The reply of the Home Secretary was to the effect that the matter was one for
experts, that nothing should be done at present, but that he expected to hear any moment from
Dr. Moore, who was in consultation with Dr. Elkington. Dr. Moore subsequently informed the
Home Secretary that Dr. Elkington had decided to go to Bundaberg. Dr. Moore was then
instructed by the Home Secretary to place the full resources of the State Health Department at
Dr. Elkington’s disposal. Dr. Moore advised the Home Secretary that in his opinion the services
of a pathologist were unnecessary. Later in the day Dr. Moore received advice from Dr. Elkington
that he was unable to proceed to Bundaberg, but that Dr. G. A. Murray and Dr. Richards were
going.
Commonwealth Action at Brisbane. —At 8.20 p.m. on Saturday, 28th January, 1928, Dr.
J. S. C. Elkington, Director, Division of Tropical Hygiene, Commonwealth Department of Health,
Brisbane, Queensland, received a telephone message from Dr. G. A. Murray, who had just
been informed by Dr. Moore, giving him the first intimation of the deaths at Bundaberg.
On receiving this information Dr. Elkington telephoned to Dr. J. I. Moore, State Commissioner
of Public Health, Brisbane, who confirmed Dr. Murray’s message stating that eleven (11)
deaths had occurred. Dr. Elkington stated he would get in touch with Dr. Thomson
at Bundaberg and advise Dr. Moore later what action had been decided upon. After
obtaining an outline of the situation from Dr. Thomson, Dr. Elkington advised the
Director-General of Health, Commonwealth Department of Health, Melbourne, of the fatalities,
and telephoned Dr. Moore that he would send an officer to Bundaberg by the first available train.
This officer (Dr. G. A. Murray) was despatched by Dr. Elkington only to investigate the situation
from the administrative aspect. Dr. Moore stated that the Mayor of Bundaberg had asked for
a pathologist to be sent, but Dr. Moore stated that he did not see the necessity for such action.
Dr. Elkington refrained from commenting on Dr. Moore’s view as he (Dr. Elkington) considered
the situation a “ domestic ” matter of health.

DR. RICHARDS REPORTS ON THE AUTOPSY OF M.BR.
Commonwealth of Austealia.
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH.
Commonwealth Health Laboratory,
Rockhampton, 3rd February, 1928.
28/64.
The Director, Division ot Tropical Hygiene, Brisbane.
Deae Sie,
The following are the details of the post-mortem examination performed by Drs. Schmidt
and McKeon upon M. Br., aged two years and six months, 56 hours after death.
There was a marked bluish blotchiness of the si in on the limbs and trunk, being apparently
due to intracutaneous haemorrhages.
This feature, I was told, was characteristic of all the other cases and was attributed to the
injections of adrenaline or antitoxic serum, 4,000 units, given before death.
The chest wall was opened and the pericardium appeared normal containing a little fluid,
which was cultured on serum agar plates.
The heart was markedly contracted, this was opened and some of the fluid blood cultured
on serum agar plates.
The lungs were then examined and appeared to be normal.
The abdomen was then opened and the peritoneum was well spread out, pale and not
injected. The stomach and intestines were pale both inside and out, showing no injection.
The spleen, liver, kidney and pancreas were examined in turn and did not appear to be
different from normal.
One feature was our inability to find any well-defined suprarenal gland tissue on the upper
pole of the kidney in the fat. We, however, removed the whole upper pole with the fat in the
hopes of finding adrenal tissue therein later.
The brain and meninges were then exposed, both were pale with no marked injection.
Upon asking the operators if the post-mortem examination showed the same changes as
the ones on the fresher corpses, they said it was so, except in the cases of brain, which showed
marked injection with small petechiae in the white matter and an ante-mortem clot in the superior
and inferior venae cavae.
This was also corrobated by Dr. Hains.
Cultures of the meningeal fluid, liver and spleen were taken on blood agar slopes.
Pieces of heart, lung, liver, spleen, pancreas, meninges and brain were taken for microscopic
examination.
Yours faithfully,
(Sgd.) R. E. RICHARDS.

Memorandum.
The following is a report on the Microscopical Examination of organs removed from M. Br.,
post-mortem, Monday, 30th January.
Liver.
The lobules appear well defined.
The portal canals appear normal. Some of the intralobular veins seem more distended
than normal.
The liver cells do not show any definite change. There may be a little more shrinkage
than normal making the intercellular lymph spaces larger, probably a post-mortem change.
The capsule seems unchanged.
Heart Muscle.
The muscle fibres show well-stained nuclei, and are definitely striated.
There seems to be more fragmentation than normal, but this is probably a post-mortem
change.
There are no signs of degeneration in the muscle cells themselves.
Arteries and fibrous tissue seem normal.
Spleen.
Microscopic examination of the spleen does not reveal any changes from the normal organ.
Lung.
The epithelium lining the alveoli appears normal. The alveoli themselves do not show
abnormal contents in the way of any exudation.
The blood vessels do not show abnormal content/of blood cells.
Kidney.
The glomeruli appear normal. There is no distension of the Bowman’s capsule caused by
any excess exudation from the capillaries, nor is there excess of lymphocytes.
The epithelium fining the convoluted tubules in the vicinity of the glomeruli shows granular
changes and loss of staining power.
I am inclined to think this has been caused by the “ toxins ” as the tubules lower down
show well-defined and deeply-stained epithelium.
The blood vessels appear normal.
Pancreas.
In parts of the glands, the cells show a degenerative change, i.e., lack of definition and
staining power.
In other parts the cells stain fairly well, but there is considerable shrinkage leaving the
fibrous tissue framework very well marked.
There is no marked inflammatory change in the way of increased blood vessels and increase
in leucocytes.
Brain.
The nervous tissue appears normal.
The blood vessels and capillaries do not show any engorgement.
Further than this lam unable to comment on brain tissue.
From these findings it will be seen that the only changes were in the kidney and pancreas.
This is only a toxic spoiling characteristic of any toxaemia.
I failed to find any adrenal tissue in the fat on the upper poles of the kidneys.
This may be due to lack of anatomical knowledge on the part of Dr. McKeon and myself,
but we spent quite a considerable time looking for the adrenal glands and finally decided they
must be in the fat.
I am forwarding a duplicate set of these slides to you.
I would be pleased to hear the report on them from some other pathologist.

APPENDIX 11.
POST-MORTEM EXAMINATION OF THE TISSUES RETAINED FROM THE AUTOPSIES
AT BUNDABERG.
Tissues and organs were retained from the autopsies on four bodies, those of J.P., W.F.,
T.R. and M.Br. The autopsies were performed at the following periods after death:— At 1\
hours, 7 hours, hours and hours respectively.
The tissues examined by the Commission were—
In addition the smears taken from organs at the autopsy on M.Br. (Case 16) by Dr.
Richards were examined. These were marked Liver (? Lung) and Spleen. Films from his
cultures from pericardial fluid and heart blood were also examined.
The weights of the organs where possible were determined on arrival in Melbourne. The
weights in grammes were as follows : —-
The figure’s given in brackets are the average weights of the organs for the age and sex
(after Vierordt). The weights give little information, making due allowance for the variability
of the organs, and for the fact that the method of preservation used causes great reduction in
weight of an organ. Similar pieces of kidney and liver so treated lost 20 per cent, and 14 per
cent, of their weight in a week. The spleen is possibly enlarged in W.F. and T.R. (Cases I and
18) and remarkably small in J.P. (Case 12). The kidneys are uniformly below what we should
expect dehydration during preservation to account for. The high values for the lung are
probably due to incomplete removal of fixing fluid. The bodies of the children were not weighed
at autopsy and no accurate information is available to allow consideration of the relationship to
body weight.
The changes which were found to be present in the organs of the children were so similar
both macroscopically and microscopically that it will be convenient for the purposes of this report
to give a general description and note individual variations where these occur.
One feature common to all the cases except M.Br. (Case 16) is that owing to the way in
which the specimens had been preserved, the superficial tissues of the organs were brittle and
discoloured to a variable depth, while satisfactory fixation was correspondingly limited. The
scope for observation in certain directions was, therefore, restricted.

Liver. —Two of the organs were complete (W.F. and T.R.) —
Viewed from the front both are roughly quadrangular and the lower margin of the right
lobe is bluntly rounded in each case.
The peritoneum is thin, transparent and free from haemorrhages or exudate. The fine
mosaic of the underlying lobules is just visible through it. On section the organ has a uniform
very pale buff color. The hepatic veins are somewhat distended and filled with clot and a similar
distension of less degree is seen in the portal veins. The central lobular veins are just visible
and not obviously distended. No excess of fibrous tissue is present and no evidence found of
haemorrhage or focal lesion of any kind. No changes are observed in the structures in the porta
hepatis or ligaments. In the case of W.F. (Case 1) though no gas formation had occurred, the
central portion of the liver when first sectioned was a brown spongy mush.
Microscopic. —The capsule is not thickened but is finely wrinkled. The peritoneal
endothelium appears to be intact. There is some indeterminate debris on the surface which,
however, is not exudate and there is no suggestion of peritonitis. There are some dilated veins
distinguishable in the pigmented shrunken tissue.
Beneath this surface alteration the usual architectural characters of the liver are main-
tained. The sinusoids are uniformly dilated throughout the liver lobules. This is not a shrinkage
effect (though varying degrees of this are seen), for blood fills the sinusoids. The capillaries
in the portal tracts are similarly dilated. The veins both central and portal are likewise fully
charged with blood. The arterioles are not affected in this manner and some of them have a
contracted appearance. The distension of the sinusoids is not especially marked round the
central veins, nor is the condition of the cells there in any way different from that of those near
the portal tracts. The contour of the liver cells in spite of the separation of the columns gives
them a slightly turgid appearance. The cytoplasm is granular, and shows no excess or special
localization of fatty accumulation. Chromatolysis is advanced in the nuclei of many of the
cells, though the majority retain their staining characters well.
No swelling or other change is detected in the vascular endothelium. There is no thickening
of the walls of the veins.
What appear to be widely dilated lymphatics with finely granular contents are seen
alongside the large arteries and veins in the portal tracts. A notable feature is their content
of fairly numerous polymorphs, which is the more remarkable as the impression obtained from
an examination of the blood in the vessels does not suggest a leucocytosis of this kind.
It is also noted that in the connective tissue of many of the portal tracts and sometimes
extending along between the lobules, there is a general slight but definite excess of cells, mostly
mononuclear or lymphocytic, but a fair proportion of them of the polymorphonuclear variety.
At no point does this cellular increase amount to a focal lesion. No abnormal biliarv or other
accumulations of pigment are noticeable. No pathological features are seen in the Kiipffer cells.
The bile ducts also show no change, the epithelium being in good condition. Their lumina
contain granular material. No focal lesions or haemorrhages are seen.
In the sections from W.F. (Case 1) the tissue is badly altered by post-mortem change.
More vacuolation is seen in the sections from W.F. and T.R. (Cases 1 and 18). In the latter case
it is present in some excess, but it is doubtful if it is of any pathological significance. The same
slight but definite cellular infiltration is present in the other cases, but in none of them are the
polymorphs in such high proportion.
Gall Bladder. —The organ was examined in W.F. and T.R. (Cases 1 and 18) and shows
no obvious lesions on the peritoneal or mucous surfaces. There is no distension or thickening
of the wall. The bile had been evacuated before the organ was examined.
Microscopic.— The gall bladder is severely affected by post-mortem changes. The
epithelium has mostly disappeared. Apart from much vascular dilatation, no significant changes
are seen in the walls.

tThe peritoneaFsurface is without lesion, and nothing abnormal is noted about the arteries
at the hilum. The vein is wide and full of red clot. The surface exposed on section show as
greyish brown colour dotted prominently throughout with paler buff circular areas of
approximately -5 c.cm. diameter, the malpighian bodies. The surface is somewhat granular
and the pulp looks congested and has minute black dots scattered through it. A number of
veins plugged with red clot show up on section. There is no gross change visible in the arteries
nor special prominence of fibrous tissue.
Microscopic. —The changes most obvious on general inspection are sinus engorgement
and focal lesions in nearly every malpighian body.
The capsule presents no unusual features.
The larger vessels in the trabeculae are all somewhat engorged.
The malpighian bodies are all much enlarged with a peripheral lymphocytic concentration
and a central area of poor definition in which much cellular degeneration is evident. In a
typical focus the periphery of the follicle is densely packed with lymphocytes. Eccentrically
placed is usually an arteriole which shows no abnormal features beyond in some cases very slight
swelling or fusion of the inner layers giving a hyaline appearance. Several rather dilated
capillaries are sometimes to be seen. The centre and main bulk of the follicle consist of
more loosely arranged degenerating cellular material in which the more numerous and best
preserved nuclei recognizably belong to cells of the reticular type. The remaining nuclear
material is pyknotic and derived from lymphocytes or reticular cells.
The sinuses are much engorged, their contents being chiefly red blood corpuscles with
fairly numerous leucocytes of lymphocytic and larger mononuclear types. There is no swelling
or other readily recognizable change in the endothelium. The pulp between the sinuses shows
mostly a very loosely arranged reticulum in the meshes of which in the more congested areas
erythrocytes predominate, while in other areas there are more leucocytes mainly of mononuclear
type. The amount and distribution of pigment does not indicate either excessive haemolysis
or abnormal phagocytic activity. Occasional degenerating cells and phagocytosis can be found
in the pulp.
This description applies to the appearances seen in the other cases except that the central
degenerative changes in the malpighian bodies are even more marked in the case of T.R. (Case
18), while the lymphoid tissue is less dense, more diffused and poorly defined. In W.F. and M.Br.
(Cases 1 and 16) the degenerative changes are not so marked, though in M.Br. affected reticulum
is seen beyond the zone of lymphocytes. The hyaline appearance of the inner layers of the
arterial walls is very slight and inconstant.
Kidneys. —
Both organs from two cases and one from a third were retained.
Apart from minor unimportant anatomical differences, the same description will apply
equally well to all the organs examined.
The capsule is not thickened and strips easily and cleanly, leaving a surface not noticeably
congested and on which no haemorrhages or other focal lesion can be detected. On some areas
the fine mottling appears to define the surface projection of the cortical structures on the capsule.
Section gives no indication that the kidney tissues were under any undue tension. The
cortex has a depth of about -4 cm., and is quite regular in structure, There is some slight con-
gestion visible directly under the capsule, occasionally extending for some distance between the
cortical columns or medullary, rays, which have a slightly swollen appearance when examined
with a hand lens. The glomeruli are not specially prominent. The pyramids are darker in
colour than the cortex, and many of them show minute dark points or streaks indicating some
slight congestion. This is especially noticeable in the intermediate zones. -The papillae present
no unusual features. No infarcts, abscesses or other gross indication of any focal lesion are
seen.
The larger blood vessels are considerably engorged. The arterial walls are not prominent
on section and have no gross appearance of disease. There are no abnormal appearances in the
structures in the sinus renalis.

The engorgement of the larger vessels in the intermediate zone is particularly marked in
the organs from W.F., T.R. and J.P. (Cases 1, 18 and 12) and widely dilated vessels are not
uncommon in the cortex. In the last at autopsy there was some suspicion that an infarked in
present at the lower pole of one of the kidneys. If this be the organ retained, the infarction
cannot now be distinguished.
Microscopic. —The capsule is thin and beneath it are seen somewhat engorged veins.
The architecture of the cortex is not grossly disturbed. The glomeruli stand out in staining
contrast to the surrounding tubular tissue. The capsular spaces are fairly wide, and the
glomerular capillaries are uniformly but not excessively engorged. No thickening of Bowman’s
capsule is seen in any part, no swelling of its epithelium, nor are adhesions or haemorrhages to
be detected. The convoluted tubules show a uniformly marked swelling of the epithelium
(often almost obliterating the tubular lumen) and granularity of cytoplasm, while many nuclei
stain very faintly. No vacuolation of the cytoplasm is present. The margins of the cells are in
most cases fairly well defined, a little debris only being found in any of the lumina, while casts
and blood are not found at all. The loops of Henle and collecting tubules show better nuclear
preservation, though especially in the deeper parts of the section the cellular preservation is
not satisfactory.
Throughout the section the intertubular capillaries, both in cortex and medulla, but perhaps
more especially in the intermediate zone, show a general engorgement with local exaggerations.
Red blood corpuscles everywhere stain badly. The larger vessels, both arteries and veins, are
distended with blood, it being exceptional to find a collapsed vein. No endothelial change is
to be detected in the capillaries. No haemorrhages are present in any part of the sections
examined nor are any focal accumulation of cells or areas of necrosis or other focal lesions observed.
In T.R. (Case 18), the engorgement in the capsule and immediately subjacent tissue is
rather more marked. Most of the glomeruli are rather more congested and in contrast to the
description given, fill their capsules and sometimes show an irregular contact that suggests
adhesions. The glomeruli throughout give no other structural indication of past or present
lesion. In M.Br. (Case 16) the post-mortem deterioration is much more advanced than in any
of the other cases. In M.Br. and W.F. (Cases 16 and 1) the congestion is more patchy in
distribution.
Suprarenals. —The right suprarenal is available from W.F. and T.R. (Cases 1 and 18)
and about half of the left from T.R. (Case 18).
Both, right suprarenals were found attached to liver and the left to the upper pole of the
left kidney.
Macroscopic.— Except that they had been slightly deformed by pressure, there is no
departure from the usual form to record.
On section the medulla shows merely as the dividing line between the layers of the cortex,
which is of a pale yellow colour with regular striation visible on close examination. There is no
trace of haemorrhage or congestion apart from the fact that there was a visible clot in the central
vein of the right suprarenal of T.R. (Case 18). The appearance of this organ in all three specimens
is perfectly normal.
Microscopic. —The capsule shows no congestion. The suprarenal tissue is much affected
by post-mortem change. The general structure, however, is seen to maintain the normal
relationship of the zones in accordance with the age of the subjects. In the glomerulosa (a narrow
zone) and the fasciculata vacuolation presumably corresponds to the removal of lipins, which
are uniformly distributed and more especially developed in the fasciculata (normal). The
reticularis and medulla are less well defined. The cortex shows no necrosis. There are no areas
of leucocytic infiltration. There is no haemorrhage. There is perhaps a very slight general
capillary dilatation and some engorgement of the larger blood vessels. The medullary cells
show no hyaline change.
Pancreas.—- About half the organ of T.R. (Case 18) and a small portion of that of M.Br.
(Case 16) were kept. •
Macroscopic. —The organ is soft and the lobules of pancreatic tissue of a uniform pinkish
tint (greyish white in the specimen from M.Br.). The connective tissue does not appear to be
excessive and the ducts show no abnormal features. No congestion is seen macroscopically and
no haemorrhages or other macroscopic lesions are discernible. The splenic vessels in relation to
it show no changes of note in the preserved state.


Microscopic.— The tissue is with difficulty recognizable, so advanced is the post-mortem
change. Some of the larger vessels appear to be congested. No focal lesions or haemorrhages
can be discovered.
Stomach. —Two organs were examined —W.F. and T.R. (Cases 1 and 18).
The length along the lesser curvature is approximately 5 cm. The stomach is neither
contracted nor dilated. There are a few congested veins radiating for a short distance over the
anterior surface from both curvatures. Otherwise the peritoneum is uniformly pale grey. No
peritonitis or sub-peritoneal haemorrhages are present. The mucous membrane apart from the
usual folds is fairly smooth and on close examination intact, no ulcerations, haemorrhages or
or other focal lesions being observed. It has a pinkish tinge in some areas, but there is no
congestion. The lower end of the oesophagus and the pylorus are similarly free from
abnormality. The fundus of the stomach of W.F. (Case 1) is slightly distended and thinned out.
A few dilated veins are visible in this part on transillumination.
Microscopic. —This organ has suffered much from post-mortem changes.
The mucous membrane, however, appears to be quite regular in structure, though many
of the more superficial cells have disappeared. There is no swelling or congestion in the stroma.
No notable reaction in the lymphoid tissue is found. Scattered through the mucous membrane
in small numbers are seen lymphocytes and occasionally a few polymorphs. There is some slight
vascular dilation in the submucous tissue, but no changes are seen in the muscular or peritoneal
coats.
Intestines —These were only examined in one case, T.R. (Case 18).
Macroscopic—The Small Intestine. —The duodenum is slightly distended. The jejunum
for the first 3 feet is considerably distended, probably by gas. Thereafter the lumen of the bowel
is for the most part small and somewhat contracted with a few short lengths of moderate dilatation.
The contracted condition of the bowel is more marked in the ileum than in the jejunum. The
contents are scanty and pultaceous and, except in a few lengths of bowel, bile stained.
The Peritoneum— Much of this, from unsatisfactory preservation, is of no value for
examination, but where observation can be made, is seen to be smooth, shiny and transparent,
with no thickenings, adhesions or exudate. There is some very slight fine sub-peritoneal vascular
congestion in the first part of the duodenum and a little similar congestion in the first part of the
jejunum chiefly at the mesenteric attachment. Apart from this insignificant engorgement,
there is no congestion to be seen, the surface generally being pale.
The mucous membrane reveals no gross lesions; no ulcers, or areas of congestion,
inflammation, necrosis or haemorrhage being detected. Beyond the stretching out of the mucous
membrane in dilated parts and increased rugosity in the contracted areas, no significant change
is evident.
In all but the lowest portion of the ileum the lymphoid tissue is not noticeably swollen or
obviously congested and no affection of the Peyer’s patches is visible macroscopically. In the
last foot and increasingly towards the ileocolic valve the lymphoid tissue is prominent, the follicles
and Peyer’s patches projecting from the surface. No necrotic foci or other gross changes are
visible on inspection of the surface or on section of these lymphoid projections. A central
depression is readily visible on the summit of each follicular mass. The mucous membrane of
the last 2 inches of the ileum is very rugose and appears to be swollen. The ileum projects
prominently into the caecum.
Appendix.— Length 8 cm. The appendix was retrocaecal in position. It shows no swelling
or congestion. A little faecal accumulation was found in its lumen 2 cm. from the orifice.
Large Intestine. —The peritoneal surface, apart from some very slight venous congestion
in the sigmoid region, is pale and presents no pathological features.
The caecum is dilated, the ascending and transverse colons somewhat contracted. The
descending and sigmoid colons are dilated except for a few very short lengths of bowel, which are
firmly contracted.
The lymphoid tissue in the caecum and throughout the large intestine is somewhat
prominent. The mucous membrane is everywhere intact as far as can be determined by naked
eye inspection, and there is no lesion discernible at or about the sites of contraction in the
descending colon. Bile staining is evident in the caecum and some of the pultaceous food material
lower down in the bowel (sigmoid) is also tinged with bile. No mucus is seen in the preserved
specimen. No formed faeces were found in any part of the bowel.
Microscopic.—Duodenum.-^- There is much disappearance of the surface cells of the mucous
membrane and at the tips of the denuded villi the cells of the stroma show faded nuclei or none,
and stain poorly. The epithelium in the deeper parts of the crypts is sometimes healthy looking,
thottgh shrunken away from its basement membrane, but in many places the cells have swollen,
become vacuolated, or degenerated or have completely disappeared. The cells of Brunner’s


glands also have a swollen appearance. There is little indication of congestion in the submucosa,
and no alterations are seen in the muscular, sub-peritoneal or peritoneal layers. The abnormal
appearances are probably in the main of post-mortem origin.
Jejunum. —In this portion of the bowel the epithelium is less altered, but much separation
of strips of membrane is seen at the surface. The villi, however, show a good deal of capillary
congestion and are somewhat oedematous. The vessels in the stroma of the valvulae conniventes
are also engorged, and this vascular condition and some slight oedema are general throughout
the subniucosa. In addition to the usual leucocytes, there are also in the submucosa and of the
villi a considerable number of polymorphs, which together with lymphocytes are also seen amongst
the cells of the mucous membrane, in fair number in the lumina of some of the crypts, and in
places associated with local disintegration of the mucous membrane. These cells are very few
amongst the desquamated cells on the surface, which has not the appearance of an exudate.
Nevertheless the picture is inflammatory in kind, though not of severe degree. The muscular
tissue, subperitoneal and peritoneal coats show no appreciable alteration.
Ileum. —In the upper part of the ileum there is little or no congestion and the mucous
membrane displays no special feature beyond the diappearance of many of the surface cells.
Towards the ileocaecal junction, however, there is an increasing submucous congestion and much
swelling of the lymphoid tissue. The lymphoid tissue of the Peyer’s patches and agminated
glands shows numerous dilated capillaries and is oedematous. The “ germ centres ” are large
and of loose structure, and show similar features to the lymphoid tissue in the spleen, granularity,
and lack of cytoplasmic definition, with poor affinity for stain, and nuclear degeneration and
fragmentation. The villi in these areas are mostly denuded of epithelium. In the intervening
parts similar loss of epithelium is seen and congestion and oedema of the stroma are present in
varying degree. Polymorphs are rare. There is a mixture of amorphous granular material
and degenerating cells on the surface. The congestion is present also in the vessels of the muscular
coats, which, however, are otherwise not affected, while the peritoneal and subperitoneal tissues
show no apparent change. No haemorrhages are found.
Ccecum. —At the beginning of the large intestine the post-mortem changes obscure a picture
which in the better preserved parts is seen to be essentially similar in character. The changes in
the lymphoid tissue are the same. Some congestion, submucous and mucous, and a certain
amount of oedema, together with desquamation of epithelial cells are common to all the sections
examined.
Different portions examined differ in their preservation. Lower down in the large intestine
submucous congestion and superficial desquamation is still seen, but in diminished degree.
Lungs. —From T.K. (Case 18), both lungs, from W.F. (Case 1) the left lung, and from M.Br.
(Case 16) a portion of one lung were examined.
Macroscopic. —T.E. (Case 18) —combined weight, 380 gm.
W.F. (Case 1) —left lung, 115 gm.
The organs are much distorted from pressure.
No evidence of exudate or haemorrhage is seen on the pleural surface. There are no pleural
thickenings or remains of adhesions. The cut surface of the lung has a reddish brown colour,
deepest in the neighbourhood of blood vessels. All the lobes present a uniform appearance of a
coarse reticulum, the finer bronchioles remaining distended. The bronchial mucous membrane
is smooth and does not appear congested. No pneumonic consolidation or demonstrable gross
oedema or hypostatic congestion is observed. No haemorrhages or focal lesions are visible.
The pulmonary arteries and veins and their larger branches are greatly engorged with
red clot which show conspicuously on the cut surface. The interlobular fibrous tissue strands,
especially near the hilum stand out slightly as though swollen.
Some of the large bronchi in the lung of T.R. (Case 18) show a slight surface deposit. The
appearance of the sample from M.Br. (Case 16) justifies the opinion that the description given
applies also in that case.
Microscopic. —The pleura shows no lesion. The parenchyma shows a varying distribution
of areas of infundibular and alveolar distension (acute emphysema) grading to areas of relative
collapse. Where the distension is great the walls are thin and bloodless ; where it is absent they
are somewhat swollen, the extreme engorgement of the capillaries giving the alveoli an irregular
contour. Oedema is present in tissue and in alveolar spaces chiefly where congestion is most
developed, but is not general. The great vessels everywhere are extremely engorged and even
in the emphysematous areas wherever the tissue is sufficiently loose or the vessel large enough,

engorgement is evident. In the engorged areas occasional red blood corpuscles are seen in the
alveoli, but apart from this and a few desquamated cells no cellular accumulations are seen.
The bronchioles are distended and empty and their epithelium flattened, but mostly intact.
The interlobular connective tissue shares in the congestion and is but slightly oedematous.
The alveolar congestion and oedema is most prominent in the lung of M.Br. (Case 16).
Emphysematous distension is almost exclusively predominant in T.R. (Case 18) and in this case
more congestion and oedema, and some catarrhal exudation is present in the bronchi. In W.E.
and T.R. (Cases 1 and 18) a few very small congested subpleural and para-arterial areas of lymphoid
tissue are present.
Lymphatic glands. —From both W.F. and T.R. (Cases 1 and 18), glands from the root of
the lung, porta hepatis and lesser curvature of the stomach were examined, and from T.R. (Case
18) alone glands from the head and upper border of the pancreas and from the mesentery.
The lymph glands in all these situations show a moderate degree of enlargement. The
largest gland observed was the lowest of the ileocaecal group in the mesentery and measured
2 x 1.1 x. 6 cm. Commonly the glands are about half this size. On section vascular engorgement
can be seen in the bronchial glands. Those from other parts are of a uniform pale pink colour
with no gross evidence of congestion, haemorrhages or focal lesions.
Microscopic.—Lymph gland —from porta hepatis. Section including the hilum of the
gland shows some dilatation of the lymphatics in that situation. The afferent lymph paths,
peripheral and trabecular are broadened, of loose structure and loaded with polymorphonuclear
leucocytes. Many of these show nuclear degenerative changes. In these areas and in the
neighbouring lymphatic tissue there are very numerous large cells with vesicular nuclei, apparently
locally proliferated (some show double nuclei). They are often vacuolated and contain
polymorphic nuclear debris, partly derived from lymphocytes. Some are full of blood pigment.
There is much fibrin in these areas, and much loss of definition of cytoplasmic structure and
loss of staining character (as contrasted with neighbouring tissue). The lymph follicular tissue
is hyperplastic and slightly hyperaemic and for the most part rather rarified as though
oedematous, with localized peripheral areas of denser lymphocytic accumulation. “ Germinal
centres ” are not prominent. No polymorphs are seen in the lymphatics at the hilum.
Bronchial glands. —These show similar features but in addition are much more congested.
The subcapsular lymphatic spaces are not so easily observed, lymphoid tissue frequently reaching
the capsule. The internal structure of the gland is, however, much more grossly disturbed.
All the vessels, arterioles, veins and capillaries are widely distended with blood. The lymph
cords are represented by indefinite lymph cell areas in the medulla, practically the whole of which
has the openwork appearance of the lymphatic paths. In the reticular spaces, the large
endothelial cells are specially numerous. Polymorphs are also very numerous but rather more
indeterminate in distribution and more patchy in concentration than above described.
The concentration of polymorphs in some parts resembles that of an acute pyogenic focus. In a
few areas the shadows of numerous red cells are seen in the sinuses and some even amongst the
lymphocytes. Lymphoid hyperplasia is only seen at the cortical periphery, and often in the
centres of the follicles nuclear fragmentation and degeneration and cytoplasmic changes
recalling those seen in the splenic lymphoid tissue are present.
Ileocaecal lymph glands. —These vary somewhat in the appearances presented but all are
swollen and show marked vascular engorgement throughout but no haemorrhages. The lymph
sinuses are dilated and in some rather empty with somewhat less prominent endothelial swelling,
desquamation and phagocytic activity than that seen in the bronchial glands; others are quite
as active as those glands in this respect. Some of them show numerous curious degeneration
forms, apparently of lymphocytic nuclei, which make the cells difficult to distinguish from
polymorphs. These are especially numerous round dilated blood vessels. The lymph cords
are wide, the reticulum delicately spread out and the lymphocytes uniformly and somewhat
loosely distributed. The peripheral lymph follicles for the most part are not well marked off, and
show some endothelial activity but only occasionally are there seen the degenerative changes
resembling those in the spleen. Other smaller abdominal glands are less affected and show
chiefly an oedematous condition together with some vascular congestion.
The organs show no notable pecularity in form or position. Some slight congestion of
superficial veins is seen. No haemorrhages are visible on the surface or on section. The lobules
on section have a pale pink colour and are free from obvious lesions.

Microscopic. —All the blood vessels are considerably engorged but no haemorrhages are
present. The whole thymic tissue is of very loose texture and wide spaces are present between
groups of cells. The cellular elements are of healthy appearance and no hyperplasia is observed.
No areas of haemorrhage or necrosis are seen ; no nuclear fragmentation or phagocytosis and no
abnormal cellular accumulations.
Brain and Meninges. —The whole brain was retained from T.R. (Case 18) and some small
pieces from M.Br. (Case 16). Portions of the dura mater were examined in each case.
Macroscopic. —The dura mater is not thickened, the surfaces show no notable alteration
and little indication of vascular congestion is seen. The superior longitudinal sinus contains
red clot and anteriorly on the left side appears to communicate with an oval area of blood clot
2xl cm. in extent in the layers of the dura. The specimen is parchment-like and it is difficult
to estimate the true nature of the appearance.
The Brain. —Over the whole surface and in the sulci the vessels of the pia mater are much
engorged, even minute branches being affected. No surface haemorrhages of macroscopic size
are present. The preservation makes any estimate of the internal condition of dubious value.
No grossly recognizable changes are visible. A little pigmentary diffusion into the brain substance
round the blood vessels is seen, but no haemorrhages.
Microscopic. —Brain and Meninges. —All sections show the effect of postmortem change
and shrinkage. Representative sections were examined from all important parts of the specimen
from T.R.
Vascular congestion is present in the pia mater and extends along the sulci, but only a
very few mononuclear and lymphocytic cells are seen outside the vessels and no haemorrhages are
present.
The brain tissue shows many rounded and irregular spaces of artificial origin especially
the mid brain. Fine histological evidence of the condition of the ganglionic cells is lacking as
nuclear and granular definition is poor and no observations are possible on the dendrites. Between
these cells the rest of the sections show mainly a granular looking reticulum with darkly staining
nuclei dotted through it. Dilatation of the blood vessels is present in many parts, more especially
near the surface of the cerebral hemispheres and in the meninges where minute capillaries are
engorged. *
In the specimens from T.R. no evidence of escape of blood from the vessels can be seen
in any part, but in those from M.Br. (Case 16) red blood corpuscles are found in small numbers
outside the vessels in the cortical tissue.
There is no evidence of any cellular accumulations round the blood vessels, ganglionic
cells or elsewhere in the substance of the brain. Necrosis is not seen in any part.
Heart. —The complete organs from W.F. and T.R. (Cases 1 and 18) and the apical portion
of both ventricles from M.Br. (Case 16) were examined. No part of the pericardial sac was
available.
Macroscopic. —Through the unaffected epioardium is visible a marked degree of venous
congestion that involves the injection of many tiny venules. No petechical haemorrhages are
observed. The atria have been damaged during removal, but as far as can be judged the chambers
were not dilated. The left ventricle is firmly contracted. In T.R. (Case 18) a little friable red
clot is found in both atria, the upper part of the left ventricle and the aorta, and red clot fills the
right ventricle and extends into the pulmonary artery. A little fibrinous material in the right
ventricle and a little red clot in the left atrium and the pulmonary artery is all that was left in
the specimen from W.F. (Case 1) which has been opened at autopsy. No petechiae, adherent
thrombi, or affection of the endocardium is found in any of the chambers. The valve cusps and
chordae tendineae appear unaffected. Irregular blood staining of the endocardial surfaces is
present in all chambers and the valve cusps and the interior of the aorta are similarly discoloured.
The thickness of the right ventricular wall near the base is -3 cm., that of the left *9 cm. No
haemorrhage or focal pathological change is observed in the muscular tissue, but some vascular
congestion can be seen. The appearance of the specimen from M.Br. (Case 16) indicates that the
heart was in a similar condition to those described.
Microscopic. —In no part of the heart can any change of a pathological nature be found
in the epicardium or endocardium. There is much congestion of the superficial arteries and
veins and even of vessels in the muscle, but no haemorrhages are found. No swelling, loss of
striation, hyaline or fatty change or other indication of pathological alteration is recognizable.


In the case oi M.Br. (Case 16)“ fragmentation ’ ’ of the muscle fibres in the left ventricle is observed.
The connective tissue shows no abnormal features. In the sections from W.F. (Case 1) in a few
places in the perivascular and subepicardial connective tissue there are very small collections of
lymphocytes. No haemorrhage is found in the muscular tissue.
Valves. —No change is found in the endothelium. No vascularity or cellular infiltration is
seen. There is no indication of endocarditis.
Arteries, veins and capillaries. —No significant changes are seen in the walls of any of these
structures which have been examined except as recorded in the spleen, where some hyaline change
is seen in some of the arterioles (most marked in J.P. (Case 12) ). Gross affection of the
endothelium is not observed in the vessels of any organ.
Thrombus from inferior vena cava. —This was removed at autopsy from Case 12 and was
not adherent to the vein. Similar thrombi are described as being constantly present in superior
and inferior venae cavae in the other cases.
It is apparently moulded to the form of the vessel in a partly collapsed state. In transverse
section measures 1 '25 c.m. x -6 c.m. The preserved specimen is greyish white externally and
material of this colour constitutes most of its bulk. In the middle it consists of dark red clot
conforming to the shape of the mass and forming a central canal of rather less than | of the whole
in sectional area.
On microscopic examination the outer portion consists of leucocytes and fibrin, the inner
of red blood corpuscles.
A differential count of the white blood corpuscles shows—Polymorphs 27%, lymphocytes
52%, and large mononuclears 21%.
BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION OF SECTIONS OF THE AUTOPSY MATERIAL.
Organisms were diligently sought for in sections of all the organs from each case and of
the clot obtained at autopsy from the inferior vena cava of J.P. and from the heart and blood
vessels wherever possible.
J.P. (Case 12). —In the clot, chiefly along the surfaces, internal and external, of the fibrinous
portion are seen abundant gram positive bacilli of putrefactive type, abundant staphylococci
and less numerous streptococci. The bacilli are the most diffusely distributed. The staphylococcal
groups which are most numerous on the external surface are in a number of places colonies of
some size. A small colony of streptococci, the largest group of this organism found, is present in
the red clot.
In the arteries of the kidney and in the capsule are numerous organisms, gram positive
bacilli (some of putrefactive type), gram negative bacilli and a few streptococci and staphylococci.
There is no apparent reaction to their presence and only in a few instances are they seen in the
tissues immediately beyond the walls of the vessels. On the peritoneal surface of the liver
similar organisms are seen. In the substance of the liver a few gram positive bacilli and a few
doubtful coccal forms are seen. On the surface of the spleen are gram positive bacilli. None
were encountered in the tissues of that organ and cocci were not certainly identified.
W. F. (Case 1). —In this case the only place in which organisms are found in any
numbers is the capsule of the kidney where gram positive cocci (staphylococci) and bacilli are
present. In the clot from the left atrium gram positive bacilli (putrefactive), gram negative
bacilli and gram positive single cocci and diplococci are present. On the mucous surface of the
stomach in the debris are numerous organisms, bacilli and cocci, which invade the tissue scarcely
at all. In the other tissues only occasional gram positive bacilli and coccal forms liable to
suspicion are seen.
M. Br. (Case 16). —In every tissue gram positive putrefactive bacteria are numerous.
Coccal forms are seen but are not numerous and always leave their identification uncertain.
T. R. (Case 18). —The same appearances are present on the mucous surface of the
gastro-intestinal tract as have been described in W. F. (Case 1). At no point is more than
superficial invasion observed nor is reaction to their presence excited.
In the kidney capsule a few doubtful gram negative bacillary forms are present. In the
exudate on the bronchial surfaces, organisms in great variety and abundance are seen. In the
rest of the organs bacteria are difficult to find, and the same doubt of coccal forms seen makes
such observations as are made of no value. No organisms are found in the blood clots in the
heart.


Smears from organs and films from plate cultures from the heart blood and pericardial
fluid obtained at the autopsy on M.Br. by Dr. Richards and stained at his laboratory were
available for examination.
Smear from Spleen. —ln this film are seen abundant gram positive bacilli of putrefactive
type many of them spore bearers, a very few diplo-streptococci and staphylococci- and a few
faintly staining negative bacilli.
Smear from Lung. —Cells from the bronchial mucous membrane are recognizable. The
film contains abundant organisms ; gram positive baccilli of putrefactive type, short slender and
longer and thicker gram negative baccilli, long slenderer filamentous gram negative forms, gram
negative fusiform baccilli, gram negative cocci, abundant gram positive streptococci, and
scantier staphylococci and gram positive diplococci resembling pneumococci.
Films of colonies from the plate culture of the heart blood. —These show a small gram
positive bacillus of diptheroid morphology, some longer and thicker gram positive bacilli and
large pleomorphic gram positive diplococci with the individuals of pairs showing flattened
adjacent surfaces.
Films of colonies from the plate cultures of pericardial fluid. —These show the same
organisms as those from the culture of the heart blood and, in addition, a smaller rounded gram
positive coccus of diplococcal habit and staphylococcal grouping, possibly only a variant of the
larger form.
COMMENTARY ON BACTERIOLOGICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL FINDINGS.
Bacteriological. —The rapid development of putrefactive and other bacteria in the tissues
is not surprising in view of the temperature conditions at Bundaberg, but whether the invasion
began terminally or post-mortem, it is not now possible to establish by histological examination
that a particular organism caused the deaths. No plugging of vessels in the kidney or elsewhere,
nor focal concentration of any one pathogenic organism in the tissues with or without lesion is to
be observed. Nor when the route of entry of the organisms and the rapidity of death is considered,
even on a hypothesis of staphylococcal septicaemia need this cause great surprise. It is
notoriously difficult to demonstrate cocci in the tissues of animals inoculated intravenously
with lethal doses, if death follows too rapidly for the development of local lesions. In the absence
of such lesions, for the occurrence of many cocci in the amount of tissue on a microscopic slide,
the distribution of enormous numbers in the whole body would be required. It is difficult to
be absolutely certain of the diagnosis of gram positive cocci singly or in pairs in the presence of
the numerous artefacts in such post-mortem material scarcely to be distinguished from them,
and while we may be convinced that all the forms observed cannot be dismissed as artefacts,
they can in the circumstances have no weight as evidence. We have, therefore, no unequivocal
histological evidence that staphylococci (or another organism) multiplied in vivo in the blood
stream or in the tissues. On tfie other fiand, the evidence can not be taken as excluding either
hypothesis. There is, of course, no means of proving that any staphylococci observed are
identical with the Bundaberg staphydococcus.
Pathological. —Thought the detailed account of the pathological findings does not provide
us with conclusive evidence of the cause of the deaths of these children, it does put us in
possession of valuable information in the light of which the nature of those deaths may be
discussed, and by which the validity of the various hypotheses put forward on other grounds
may be tested.
The uniformity of the findings confirms what is not seriously in doubt, the unity of the
cause. It also increases the probability that they are, with the possible exception of those in the
gastro-intestinal tract, safely applicable to the cases which were not examined in detail. We are
concerned here with an agent so rapidly lethal that there is barely time for the occurrence of
appreciable lesions, and insufficient time for the development of characteristic changes which
might permit specific diagnosis.
Nervous and Cardiovascular Systems. —That in common with other tissues the centra]
nervous system was profoundly affected by the action of a poison is abundantly evident from the
effects on cerebral and motor functions, and heat-regulatory and cardiovascular control.
We can point to no primary changes in the nervous system, central or peripheral, to
correspond with the neurotoxic symptoms exhibited. The cerebral congestion was probably
exaggerated by the convulsions in the cases in which these occurred. Though it is scarcely
possible that it can have been entirely unaffected, the heart muscle is to all appearances sound.
Except for the slight changes in the splenic arterioles, no demonstrable lesion is found in any
of the blood vessels. Yet the poison, however produced, vitally affected the neuro-cardiovascular
mechanism. Of this we have evidence in the blotchy cyanosis of the skin and in the peripheral
congestion in the organs, as well as in the condition of the pulse. It is probable that the blood
pressure was low.


The absence of petechial haemorrhages in a toxaemia of this severity is somewhat
surprising. They were not seen at autopsy or found later. The escape of a few red cells from
the vessels is seen in the lungs and at the surface of the brain in M.Br. (Case 16). These are
probably related to the pulmonary congestion and the convulsions. More such microscopic
haemorrhages might have been observed had the conditions for the preservation of tlie
erythrocytes been more satisfactory.
Respiratory System. —lnformation on changes impairing the capacity of the blood to
effect gaseous exchanges is necessarily lacking. There may have been primary stimulation
of the respiratory centre. The increased respiratory rate and the occurrence of areas of acute
emphysema in a greatly congested lung suggest response to a severe anoxaemia. There is no
evidence of obstruction of the respiratory passages.
In the Liver, apart from the general stasis, which is evident on both sides of its venous
circulation and in its uniform sinusoidal congestion, and from the moderate toxic effects on its
cells, the variable slight leucocytic infiltration of the portal tracts is the only change of note.
This infiltration, with the presence of occasional polymorphs and ot cells showing nuclear
degenerative changes, together with the appearance of the lymph glands from the porta hepatis
is one of the few localized effects observed and is possibly significant.
In the Kidney there is again congestion, in places extreme, and a more marked toxic effect
especially on the epithelium of the convoluted tubules. Infarcts, necroses, cellular infiltrations,
haemorrhages, and other lesions are absent.
The Suprarenal is to all appearances completely normal.
Intestinal Trad. —The possibility of gastro-enteritis from “ food poisoning ” or the
ingestion of some metallic or other irritant must be considered. Ir does not appear to us that
the affection of the bowel, which mainly falls on lymphoid tissue, is of an extent or degree that
will support any such theory. The slight amount of congestion, oedema and leucocytic
infiltration in the mucosa, the absence of haemorrhages, necrosis, ulceration or bacterial invasion
of mucosa or lymphoid tissue, and the nature of the changes in the liver and kidneys (particularly
in the latter case the slight affection of the epithelium of the convoluted tubules); are unfavorable
to the supposition that gastro-enteritis of any kind was the affection responsible for the
deaths. The vomiting, intestinal disturbance and biliary flow and the condition of the tract,
are amply accounted for by the action of a circulating poison on the central nervous system, the
lymphoid tissue and secretions of the tract, and on the vascular system.
The Lymphoid Tissue. —Both macroscopically and microscopically the changes found
in this tissue in the lymph glands, spleen and intestinal tract are the most definite and striking
of any observed. Lymphatic tissue in children is frequently prominent and readily affected by
injurious agents arriving by the blood or lymph paths.
That a toxic agent circulating in the blood stream was acting is obvious from the
degenerative changes seen in the lymphoid tissue of the spleen and the similar appearances in
the follicles of the lymph glands and in the Beyer’s patches. In the lymph glands, the
nuclear changes common in the lymphocytes, the dilatation of the sinuses, the endothelial
hyperplasia and phagocytosis and the presence of occasional polymorph accumulations in the
sinuses, afford evidence of toxic action. The presence of fibrin in the sinuses of some glands
(bronchial) is evidence of the severity of the action of the poison. The appearances in
the bronchial glands and those from the porta hepatis suggest its arrival by the lymph paths,
though no focus for drainage in the case of the bronchial glands is observed and that in
the liver is uncertain. The extreme congestion in the bronchial glands is probably in part due
to the same causes as that in the lungs.
General infections (scarlatina, diphtheria) are common causes of lymphadenitis. Much
attention has been paid to lesions of lymphoid tissue in diphtheria both in man and animals,
and the characters of the changes observed in this disease are very similar to those which have
been described in these children. There is, however, no specific diagnostic lymphatic lesion
characteristic of diphtheria, but in view of the possibility of the injection of diphtheria toxin
being the cause of the fatalities at Bundaberg the pathological evidence for and against this
hypothesis must be examined.
All observations on autopsy material in human beings are necessarily on cases in which
the disease has been present for some days, and in the case of the deaths at Baden which were
held by Grassberger to be due to the injection of diphtheria toxin, death did not occur earlier
than the fourth day. The reports on the autopsies of the Baden children are very incomplete,
but characteristic haemorrhagic lesions in the suprarenal are reported to have been present in
every case. It is reasonable to expect that this lesion, or at least congestion, would have been
present in such acute cases as those at Bundaberg, though it is conceivable that the time was


too short even for this. No hyaline change or other lesion is present in the medulla. Fatty
change in the heart muscle, which is stated to occur early in diphtheria is not observed, nor is
there any hyaline or other necrotic lesion, nor is interstitial myocarditis present. No
haemorrhages are seen in or about the lymph glands. The congestion in the lungs and the slight
indications of toxic effects in the cells of the liver and convoluted tubules of the kidney, though
they occur in diphtheria, are of no diagnostic value. Unfortunately the lesion at the site of
inoculation was not observed at autopsy. In the Baden cases the infiltration about the site of
injection was of such character and extent even within 24 hours that it would probably not
have failed to have attracted attention at autopsy in the Bundaberg cases had it been present.
Since none of the changes, including those of the lymphoid tissue, specifically point to
diphtheria toxin as the cause, while others that might be expected to be present in such acutely
fatal cases are lacking, the weight of evidence may fairly be considered to be against this
hypothesis.
There is no suggestion from the examination of the Thymus and other organs that
lymphatism was a factor in the deaths of either of the cases in which this organ was examined
Tetanus has been suggested as a possible cause. For this the examination of the tissues
can give no positive assistance. Changes in the cells of the central nervous system whether of
nuclei, granules or dendrites could not be satisfactorily demonstrated on the material available,
and in any case none of the changes would characterize tetanus specifically. Convulsions might
conceivably account for cerebral pulmonary and other congestions. Affections of lymphoid
tissue form no part of the picture of tetanus poisoning. Hsemorrhages or necrosis in voluntary
muscle were not specially sought at autopsy, and if present did not attract attention.
There remains the view that the staphylococcus, which was present in the bottle and is of
pathogenic type, was responsible for the deaths. In spite of certain difficulties it is not only
the most obvious explanation of the tragedy, but the one with which the pathological findings
fit most completely.
The main assumption required is that the organisms after introduction multiplied within
the body, with little lag, sufficiently rapidly to produce the necessary toxin. The question of the
presence or absence of septicaemia is quite subsidiary. We have under consideration a series of
cases in which the outstanding feature is an overwhelming toxaemia acting on all tissues, pro-
ducing in the short time of its action • demonstrable lesions in some, and in others only
functional changes. Vitally important was the action on the neuro-cardiovascular mechanism,
the consequences of the derangement of which we have observed, but in the elements of which
no lesion was discovered. The cells of the liver and kidney show changes scarcely to be termed
severe, which are common in many toxaemias. The lymphoid tissue presents the grossest
damage. In the portal tracts of the liver the process is indefinite, but there are reasons for
considering that it represents an early stage of reaction to toxin or possibly infection arriving
by way of the blood stream. All these are early changes and, what reaction there is, is
quite local, the only evidence of the advent of leucocytes from without being in the portal tracts
and certain lymph glands, and then in very limited numbers. The blood as observed in the
vessels contains no excess of polymorphs, bur. rather a preponderance of cells of mononuclear
type. This may be regarded as evidence of the overwhelming nature of the toxaemia.
Can the staphylococcus produce such changes as are seen in these cases ? That the
staphylococcus can produce the common toxic changes in the liver, kidney and other organs is
well known. It is also known that it belongs to the group of organisms which by actual
invasion or by their toxins alone produce lymph glandular lesions, and further that its
poison produces symptoms referable to action on the central nervous system.
The results of the examination of the tissues of rabbits killed by intravenous injection
of a sufficient dose of the Bundaberg staphylococcus to cause death within 24 hours are of interest
in this connexion. Ignoring the vessels plugged with cocci which are common in the kidney of
rabbits so inoculated, in a favorable case (judged by the lack of reaction round such coccal
plugs), the vascular and parenchymatous changes in the liver, the cellular infiltrations in the portal
tracts, the swelling and the degenerative changes in the lymphoid tissue generally, the cerebral
congestion, and even the congestion, slight oedema and emphysema of the lungs make a picture
which has striking features of resemblance to those seen in the autopsy material from these
children. In more advanced cases, from the development of focal lesions in the liver, kidneys
and elsewhere, the resemblance is lost. Considering, therefore, the number of organisms and the
route by which they were introduced in the inoculations at Bundaberg, and the effect this
would necessarily have on the manner of their distribution, the absence in the kidneys of the
children of vessels plugged with cocci is not very surprising and the resemblances are the more
striking,


In postulating that the deaths were due to the introduction of living agents, the
fulminating character of the infection, whatever the micro-organism, demands the satisfaction
of the same requirements of virulence and pathogenicity. The effects observed in the tissues
are early, and non specific within a broad group of general infections. Within that group strong
circumstantial evidence implicates the staphylococcus. The hypothesis that the inoculation
of virulent staphylococci was responsible for the deaths appears to be best adapted to the
pathological evidence.

APPENDIX 12.
ANALYSIS OF ORGANS FOR HEAVY METALS.
For this purpose we had available only material which had been preserved for histological
examination. This had been preserved- first in spirit, but later it was placed in formalin and
transported to Melbourne in soldered kerosene tins. On arrival here pieces of tissue were taken
for histological examination, and the remainder was stored in formalin which was later found
to have been contaminated with arsenic.
The formalin was removed from T.R. liver by soaking it in 50 per cent, spirit before
analysis. The lead found in W.F. liver, Sample 111., was probably due to a small trace of solder
falling into the specimen when the kerosene tin containing it was soldered up. Pure commercial
formalin contains traces of copper and of iron and the trace of copper found in this specimen
probably came from this source.
The absence of these metals in the much larger sample of T.R. liver analysed was
doubtless due to the formalin having been removed before the analysis. The arsenic in W.F.
unquestionably came from contaminated formalin.
Arsenic is extensively used in the preservation of museum specimens and the formalin
was contaminated by the hands of an attendant. All the formalin in the room was found by
analysis to contain traces of arsenic. In any case the amount found was not significant.

Unitage = 0 -74 c.cm. of the 1 in 1,000 dilution of the antitoxin.
= 1 c.cm. of a 1 in 1,350 dilution.
Therefore 1 c.cm. undiluted antitoxin contains 1,350 units. In the standardization of the
toxin and antitoxin the pipettes used were never changed, but washed out and dried with ether
between each step.
Preparation of the Mixture, op which 1 c.cm. contained 1 Unit of Antitoxin and 8/10
op an L + Dose of Toxin.
After preparing Batch 78, 1,845 c.cm. of toxin remained, also a quantity of antitoxin, and
it was decided to prepare B. 86.
Step 1.
How much of the mixture would the 1,845 c.cm. of the toxin prepare ?
2,600 c.cm. of toxin were required to prepare 10,000 c.cm. of Batch 78.
10,000 X 1,845 _ 100 X 1,845 __ 50 X 1,845 _ 7
2,600 26 13 ’
Proof.
1,845 c.cm. contain L + doses, but each 1 c.cm. of the mixture is to contain
oA o
8/10 L + dose.
Therefore the total mixture that can be prepared = * 1.000 x lO _ qqq c cm<

Step 11.
Number of Units Antitoxin required = 7,096.

Therefore the number of c.cm. of antitoxin required = —= 5 -25 c.cm.

Step 111.
Saline required = the difference between 7,096 and (1,845 -j- 5 -25) = 7,096 1,850 -25
= 5,245 -75.
Step IV.
The antitoxin was mixed with 500 c.cm. of saline and mixed with the toxin, the balance
of the saline was then added, using some to wash the last traces of toxin and antitoxin in.

DISPOSAL OF BATCH 86.
The batch when bottled on 10th October, 1927, consisted of 100 x 10 c.cm. rubber-capped
containers and 75 x 10 c.cm. sealed glass ampoules. There were 21 rejected after filling on
account of specks of glass, black specks, a trace of fluff or leakage. Two were broken and two
were kept as samples, leaving 150 containers to be accounted for.
The exact number of rubber-capped bottles and sealed glass ampoules cannot be
ascertained, but from the analysis of the used and returned samples there appear to have been
83 rubber-capped containers and 67 sealed glass ampoules. The demand for the former is indicated
by the fact that the whole 83 had been issued, but only three of the latter.
The table below shows the disposal of the batch, the issues by the Commonwealth Serum
Laboratories, the issues from the Commonwealth Health Department, Brisbane, of the 54 rubber-
capped bottles sent there, and finally the numbers of partly used and unused samples returned
to the Commission at Melbourne. In this last portion of the table partly used samples are
indicated by an asterisk, glass ampoules by the letter (A), and rubber-capped containers by the
letter “E, ”. These designations are not absolutely certain in quite all the cases.
The Commission had of this particular batch for investigation 26 unopened rubber-capped
containers and 52 unopened sealed glass ampoules. In addition they received 30 partly used
rubber-capped containers and one partly used ampoule (Derham). The partly used ampoule
received from Dr. Jackson, Tasmania, could not fairly be investigated, as it had been transferred
for postage to an old sterile rubber-capped bottle. The history of these rubber-capped bottles
and of several others of Batch 78 (which also contained no antiseptic) is of peculiar interest in
view of what happened at Bundaberg. They are dealt with in detail in Appendix 17.

WARNING NOTICE AND COVERING MEMORANDUM ADDRESSED TO DR. J. S. C.
ELKINGTON, DIRECTOR, DIVISION OF TROPICAL HYGIENE, BRISBANE,
FROM DR. F. G. MORGAN. DIRECTOR OF LABORATORIES DIVISION.
Note.
For Users of the Diptheria Prophylactic in Rubber-Capped Bottles.
This product contains no antiseptic. Toxin-antitoxin mixture is issued from the
Laboratories in a sterile condition. Should, however, the rubber diaphragm be pierced for the
purpose of withdrawing a quantity of fluid for injection into a patient, the contents may become
contaminated and the bacteria multiply within, making the fluid cloudy and unfit for use.
The presence of antiseptic in biological products does not guarantee sterility, but inhibits
the growth of organisms. It is considered undesirable to use antiseptic in the preparation as
now issued.
Persons employing diphtheria prophylactic from rubber-capped containers are advised to
use the whole of the product without delay, and not to treat the bottles of this preparation as
they would a bacterial vaccine ; that is, to withdraw successive doses from one bottle during a
period of several weeks.
For economy, it is advisable to inject a number of children at the same time, choosing the
size of the phial according to the total volume required. In view of the above, the Laboratories
recommend the use of hermetically sealed ampoules which are ideal for keeping products in a
sterile condition when unbroken.
Where rubber-capped containers are used the possibility of bacterial contamination, as
described above, should be borne in mind, and the necessary precautions taken.
To be issued with all rubber-capped bottles containing toxin-antitoxin mixture.

Memorandum.
Reference : Your memorandum No. 465 of the 15th inst.
I am enclosing a copy of instructions issued with toxin-antitoxin mixture in rubber-capped
bottles. The matter contained in that statement bears directly upon your memorandum.
Since the immunization against diphtheria is usually carried out in schools, the use of
ampoules of suitable size in place of rubber-capped bottles should be easily carried out. A
number of children would be inoculated at the same time.
The first dose recommended is one-eighth of a c.c. and a 1 x 5 c.c. ampoule of toxin-
antitoxin mixture would contain approximately 40 doses. A 1 x 1 c.c. ampoule would be
sufficient to give the first inoculation to eight children.
The elimination of antiseptic from the diptheria prophylactic obviates a certain amount
of stinging, due to tricresol, following injection, and at the same time avoids the possibility of
undesirable chemical reaction of the tricresol with the ingredients of the mixture.
The stock of ampoules held at the Brisbane Office may be exchanged for rubber-capped
bottles. They will be issued with the note as enclosed.

APPENDIX 16.
EXAMINATION OF UNOPENED BOTTLES OF BATCH 86 AND OF OTHER
BATCHES WITHOUT ANTISEPTIC.
After the accident at Bundaberg, Dr. Morgan (Director Division of Laboratories,
Commonwealth Department of Health) at once had six samples of Batch 86 tested by culture
into broth and into alkaline meat media. The cultures examined after one, two, three,
four, five, seven and thirty days showed no growth, and the control tests of the media were
satisfactory. At the same time two doses of 1 and 5 c.cm. were injected from each ampoule
into two guinea pigs of 250 grams weight. The animals which received 1 c.cm. showed only loss
of weight for 24 hours except one in which body weight had fallen to 234 grams on the first day,
stayed above 250 grams to the fourth day, had fallen to 244 grams by the seventh day and was
still below 250 grams by the thirtieth day, when it had developed a slight paralysis—dragging the
hind legs. The animal inoculated with 5 c.cm. from the same bottle had regained his original
weight by the seventh day, weighed 328 grams on the thirtieth day and was apparently normal.
The other five animals inoculated with the larger dose had recovered their original weight
between the second and fifth days and none showed any symptoms, having body weights of 340,
354, 380, 352, and 364 grams on the thirtieth day.
After withdrawing from stock in the presence of witnesses twelve ampoules of Batch 86,
Dr. Morgan had the remainder sealed up and stored till handed over to the Commission. Of
these 52 ampoules we immediately tested six taken at random (Ml, Mls, M 25, M2B, M 34 and M4O)
both for sterility and by injection of 5 and 1 c.cm. subcutaneously into guinea pigs of 250 grams.
These animals were not weighed daily during the first few days, but showed no infiltration.
They developed no symptoms, and after twenty days the body weights of those who had received
5 c.cm. were 307, 345, 327, 337, 324 and 345 grams respectively. The corresponding animals
which had received 1 c.cm. weighed 332, 314, 327, 320, 288 and 365 grams. They all appeared
then to be in excellent condition and there was no sign of any paralysis.
The sterility tests made into broth and alkaline meat media were also quite satisfactory.
Later we tested a further three ampoules injecting them in doses of 5 c.cm. and 2 c.cm. into
guinea pigs. The results on body weight are shown in Table.
None of these animals had any infiltration at the site of injection for the first or second
days and in none of them was there any trace of paralysis evident up to the fortieth day.
A number of other ampoules and rubber-capped bottles were tested for sterility and also
by injection into guinea pigs prior to inoculating them with the Bundaberg staphylococcus and
with other organisms. The following were so tested
Ampoule M 46. —Sterile, injected into a guinea pig in a dose of 1-0 c.cm. No infiltration
or other symptoms. Weight on the twentieth day 300 grams.
Murgon Shire Council , 3 Rubber-capped Bottles. —Sterile. 0-9 c.cm. injected into a
guinea pig of 250 grams. Weight on twentieth day 303 grams. No symptoms.
Brisbane Office Supply 8 ( Rubber-capped Bottle). —Sterile. 1 -0 c.cm. injected into a guinea
pig of 250 grams. Weight on twenty-first day 313 grams. No symptoms.
Brisbane Office Supply 10 ( Rubber-capped Bottle). —Sterile. 1 -0 c.cm. injected into a guinea
pig of 250 grams. Weight on twenty-first day 317 grams. No symptoms.
Brisbane Office Supply 13 ( Rubber-capped Bottle). —Sterile. 1 -0 c.cm. injected into a guinea
pig of 250 grams. Weight on twenty-first day 395 grams. No symptoms.
Brisbane Office Supply 2 ( Rubber-capped Bottle). —Sterile. 1 -0 c.cm. injected into a guinea
pig. Weight on twenty-first day 297 grams. No symptoms.
Brisbane Office Supply 11 ( Rubber-capped Bottle). —Sterile. 1 -0 c.cm. injected into a guinea
pig. No symptoms. Weight on twenty-second day 363 grams.


Ten ampoules and six rubber-capped bottles of batch 86 were, therefore, tested by us for
sterility in broth, on blood agar and in alkaline meat media which had been shown to grow B.
chauvei with ease. Various doses injected into guinea pigs demonstrated that the mixture
was over-neutralized and the same fact was attested by the intradermal injection of 0 -2 c.cm.
from a number of other ampoules and bottles of the same batch during the course of our
experiments. All the unopened bottles and ampoules were perfectly clear and remained so.
In none of the unopened ampoules or rubber-capped bottles of this or any other batch of
toxin-antitoxin was there any trace of turbidity. All the samples tested by us were found to
be sterile. The animal experiments show that the toxin-antitoxin was, as it purported to be,
an over-neutralized mixture and our bacteriological tests lead us to the conclusion that the mixture
as put on the market is properly safeguarded in regard to the possibility of contamination until
the ampoules are opened or the rubber cap pierced for the removal of doses.


APPENDIX 17.
RESULTS OF INVESTIGATION OF PARTLY USED RUBBER-CAPPED BOTTLES
OF BATCH 86, WITH THEIR PREVIOUS HISTORY.
The results of the investigation of these bottles are shown in the table below. Except in
two cases 1 or 2 c.cm. or more of the material was injected subcutaneously into a normal guinea
pig of about 250 grams weight. In many cases the amount available was too small for this purpose.
Owing to our early departure for Bundaberg and the demands thrown on the Laboratory Staff
at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, we were not able to arrange for the daily weighing of all
the animals under experiment. Any decrease in weight which may have occurred during the
first two or three days after inoculation was, therefore, missed in many cases.
Cultures were made on to blood agar slopes, into alkaline meat broth and sometimes into
glucose brain broth as well. When only a trace of material was left in the bottle, its contents
were washed out with sterile broth and the media were inoculated with the washings.
Dr. Randall of Murgon used part of one rubber-capped bottle of Batch 86 on one occasion
only, his practice being to use materials of that kind only once and to discard any product that
had been open for more than an hour. Using Batch 78 and Batch 86, he had inoculated 166
children, three injections being given to each at seven or eight days interval. Most of the material
used was from ampoules of Batch 78 and all of it was devoid of antiseptic. No ill effects followed
any of the inoculations. From his single rubber-capped phial, Dr. Randall with some difficulty
withdrew about 4 c.cm. without injecting air. He sterilized the top of the bottle first with spirits
and then with iodine.
The following points concerning the technique are taken from a letter to Dr. Elkington
in the official file of the Health Department, put in evidence by Dr. Cumpston.
He used 6, 1-0 c.cm. syringes and 36 needles kept in spirit when not in use. Each needle
was used for one injection only and was then cleaned and sterilized by drawing spirit through
it several times before replacing it in spirit. The needles were lifted out of the spirit and placed
on the syringe with forceps. As soon as ampoules were opened their contents were at once
transferred to the syringes. Dr. Randall had not received the “warning notice.” His bottle
was faintly turbid but sterile on culture.
Dr. WiUiams of Brisbane used a rubber-capped bottle of Batch 86, making injections
into two children on 12th November, 19th November, and 26th November, 1927. On 17th
November, three other children received each 0-5 c.cm. On 18th and 25th January he gave
injections to one child and on 29th January, a first injection to another child was given. This
bottle was, therefore, used repeatedly between 12th November, 1927, and 29th January, 1928.
He had had one small local, but no general reactions following his injections. The remaining
contents of his bottle were clear and sterile when we received it. Dr. Williams used methylated
spirit as an antiseptic both for his needles and for sterilizing the top of the bottle. It was not
his practice to inject air into the bottle in order to remove material from it. He was not
aware that Batch 86 contained no antiseptic and had not seen a copy of the warning notice,
having bought the material from an agent and not directly from the Commonwealth Health
Department, Brisbane.
Dr. Green of Brisbane also used a rubber-capped bottle of Batch 86, making sixteen
inoculations in six children from it between 14th December, 1927, and 25th January, 1928. He
relied on methylated spirits for sterilizing the top of the rubber cap and injected an equivalent
amount of air when withdrawing material in his syringe. He washed out the syringe and needles
first with “ boiling ” water and then with methylated spirits. Dr. Green’s bottle was infected with
a gram positive bacillus. The mixture produced no symptoms in a dose of 1 c.cm. injected
subcutaneously into a guinea pig of 250 grams. Dr. Green had had no reactions in any of the
children injected. He had asked specificially for a rubber-capped bottle. He had not received
the “ warning notice,” having obtained the bottle through an agent and not directly from the
Commonwealth Health Department, Brisbane.
Dr. Reye of Brisbane was not called to give evidence before the Commission, but the
following facts have been obtained from the official file of the Commonwealth Health Department
from his letter to Dr. Elkington, since confirmed by telegram to the Commission. He obtained
his bottle of Batch 86 on 16th January, 1928, and gave the first injection on that day. He made
seven further injections on the 20th, 23rd, and 27th of January. He used acriflavine lin 1,000
to sterilize the rubber cap and the children’s skin, but the hypodermic syringe and needle were


boiled before use. When several injections were given on tbe same day, tbe syringe and needle
were boiled between each, unless tbe children were in one family, when only the needle was boiled.
The material in his bottle when examined by us was turbid and contained three species of
contaminating organisms. It was without effect on guinea pigs in doses of 1-0 and 2-0 c.cm.
He also had received his bottle indirectly through an agent.
Dr. McLean of Brisbane also used material out of rubber-capped bottles making repeated
injections from the same bottle at intervals. He had inoculated two patients on the 4th, Bth,
and 14th of December, 1927, and had noticed one or two local reactions like a positive Schick
test. His technique was to clean the top of the rubber cap with ether. The syringe and needle
were sterilized with lysol washed out first with methylated spirit and subsequently with “ boiling ”
water. He always injected an equivalent amount of air into the bottle before withdrawing
the mixture. He had received his bottle direct from the Commonwealth Health Department,
Brisbane, on 7th November, 1927. He had received the “ warning notice ”by post some time
in January and had since abandoned the use of rubber-capped bottles. When we received his
bottle the remaining contents were found to be sterile and without effect on a guinea pig in a
dose of 1 -0 c.cm.
Dr. Earnshaw injected three patients from a bottle of Batch 86, giving each two doses
at an interval of five days. The top of the rubber cap was steriliized with methylated spirit or
iodine and the syringe and needle by boiling. He did not inject air into the bottle to withdraw
samples. He had had no ill effects following any injections other than a slight local reaction
in the older children. He had purchased his bottle on 7th November, 1927, from the Common-
wealth Health Department, Brisbane, and had received a copy of the warning notice some time
in January, 1928. The remaining contents of his bottle were contaminated with a staphylococcus
albus, but in a dose of 1 -0 c.cm., the mixture produced no ill effects, when injected subcutaneously
into a guinea pig.
Dr. Elwell, of Stanthorpe, injected three children from his bottle on three occasions each,
the Ist, 6th and 13th of December. He sterilized the syringe by boiling, the needles by
placing them in methylated spirits for fifteen minutes, and the rubber cap by filling the depression
with methylated spirits for ten minutes before withdrawing the sample. He used 0.5 per cent,
phenol as a diluent for the doses. The remaining mixture in Dr. Elwell’s bottle was clear and
sterile. He had received the bottle about the Ist of December, 1927, directly from the Common-
wealth Serum Laboratories, Melbourne. He had not received the “ warning notice ”.
Dr. Myers used a bottle of Batch 78a to inject two patients, one received three injections
on 9th December, 16th December and 21st December, 1927, and the other, one injection only on
23rd January, 1928. He had received the bottle, a partly used one, without wrappings, from
the Children’s Hospital, Brisbane. He was not informed that it contained no antiseptic. The
contents of this bottle were perfectly clear when it reached us in Melbourne. Dr. Myers’
practice was to clean the rubber cap with ether, with ether and alcohol or with dilute lysol. The
syringe was sterilized in one or more of these liquids.
Dr. Patterson, Superintendent of Children’s Hospital, Brisbane, had used a number of
rubber-capped bottles of Batch 86. Repeated inoculations were made from the same bottle
which, since many inoculations were made on one day, did not last more than three or four days.
Lysol was used to sterilize the rubber cap and the needles and syringe were sterilized in lysol and
subsequently washed out with distilled water.
Dr. Patterson had used active immunization to control institutional diphtheria with
apparently good results. In eighteen months prior to the introduction of this measure
there were 53 cases of diphtheria presumably contracted in hospital, and in the last seven months
there had been one only. He had observed four cold abscesses following inoculation among
1,020 children immunized. Two injections of 0.5 c.cm. of toxin-antitoxin mixture were used
at five-day intervals so as to get rapid immunization.
There were no cases of ill effects resulting from the injections of toxin-antitoxin mixture.
The case of one child named Nock was fully investigated by a member of the commission and by
Dr. S. F. MacDonald, of the honorary staff of the Hospital. They were satisfied that the child’s
condition was not related directly or indirectly to the immunizing injections he had received.
Dr. Patterson had not seen the “ warning notice ”, nor was he aware that the mixture he
had been using contained no antiseptic.
Dr. J. Y. Duhig, the pathologist in charge of the hospital laboratories, thought that the
technique used for injections was so good as to preclude any possibility of serious contamination,
particularly as the bottles were used up so rapidly. He had requested the Commonwealth Health
Department, Brisbane, to let the hospital have rubber-capped bottles in place of 1.0 c.cm.
ampoules which he found wasteful and expensive. He had received a copy of the “ warning
notice ” at this time from the Commonwealth Health Department, Brisbane.
F. 825.—6


None of the remaining contents of any of the bottles used in this hospital were available
for examination by the Commission.
Under the direction of Dr. Tilling, 23 children were inoculated by specially trained nurses
from the contents of rubber-capped bottle of Batch 86 between the 3rd and 16th of January,
1928. Inoculations were given on 3rd, 4th; 6th, 9th, 11th, 12th, 13th and 16th January. This
bottle was completely used.
Dr. Tilling was unaware that the bottles of this batch contained no antiseptic. These
cases were injected at the Children’s Hospital. Miss Barstow was one of the nurses who had
carried out these injections. She had noted no ill effects following any of the injections. She
apparently did not know that the material she was using contained no antiseptic. The technique
used was to sterilize the rubber cap, and the syringe, which was kept for this purpose only,
with ether. The needles were sterilized with strong lysol.
Dr. Lowe, of Heidelberg, had given up using rubber-capped bottles since “ about two months
before Christmas ”. He had, however, used part of a rubber-capped bottle of 78A (bottled 28th
November, 1927). He was apparently using toxin-antitoxin mixture for the treatment of various
conditions and not for immunization. It was his practice to make repeated injections from the
same bottle at varying time intervals. One of his patients, a woman of 48 years of age, became
very ill with vomiting and high temperature after an injection. He opened the bottle from
which this injection was made and found it contaminated. He attributed this to air
contamination in withdrawing samples from the bottle. The batch to which this bottle belonged
is uncertain. The bottle itself was not available for examination. He used flavine to sterilize
his syringe and needles, and methylated spirits to sterilize the rubber cap. Dr. Lowe did not
remember any of the notices packed round the bottles inside the cartons.
Dr. A. P. Derham, of Melbourne, had used a sealed glass ampoule of Batch 86. 4 c.cm.
were used on one day at the end of December, and the cut end of the ampoule was sealed with
cotton wool moistened with spirits. It was his practice to use the ampoules on the second day
as well as the first and even on the third day after opening them, the opened ampoule being in
the meanwhile plugged with cotton wool. This ampoule was sterile when examined by "the
commission.
Dr. Hilda Bull who was immunizing school children for the Melbourne City Council, had
used a large number of rubber-capped bottles of Batch 86 and had been warned previously by
Dr. Morgan (Director of the Division of Laboratories, Commonwealth Department of Health)
that they contained no antiseptic. She used 24 bottles of Batch 86. The top of the rubber-cap
was sterilized by first pouring on methylated spirit and then burning it off. The three bottles
labelled Bull 1, 2 and 3 and the nineteen other partly-used bottles (labelled Melbourne Health
Department) tested by us, came from this source. Only five out of 22 were contaminated and
eleven contained only a trace of material so that a large number of inoculations must have been
made from each. No risk attached to these contaminations as it was her practice to use the
whole contents within one hour and discard material that was left. She had observed no ill
effects following a large series of inoculations. Growth in some of the bottles had taken place in
the long period which had elapsed since she used them.
The only rubber-capped bottle containing antiseptic which appears in the table is from
Dr. J. A. Goldschmid, of Brisbane, and belonged to Batch 989/3. He had inoculated two
children on the Ist, Bth and 15th of December from this bottle without untoward results.
The remaining contents were sterile when examined by the commission and in a dose of 1.0
c.cm. produced no ill effects when injected subcutaneously into a guinea pig.
The use of rubber-capped bottles containing toxin-antitoxin with or without antiseptic,
when large numbers of children are to be inoculated on one occasion, is a very convenient one and
perfectly satisfactory when the rule followed by Dr. Bull and Dr. Eandall, of discarding all
material not used within an hour, is adhered to. It is evident that the practice of using the same
rubber-capped bottle on a number of occasions at widely-spaced intervals is very prevalent,
possibly because medical men are accustomed to administer vaccines containing antiseptic in
this way.
Of the rubber-capped bottles which the commission examined, 30 per cent, were shown
to be contaminated. Considering the large number of injections given from them and the
possibilities of air contamination, this percentage is not excessive (Appendix 4), though
some of the contaminations are doubtless referable to faulty technique.
We have not examined a series of partly-used bottles containing antiseptic, but are assured
from other experiments that with antiseptic present (Appendix 4), the percentage of
contamination would be negligible.

APPENDIX 18.
EXAMINATION OF THE REMAINDER OF THE TOXIN-ANTITOXIN MIXTURE
IN THE BOTTLE OF BATCH 86 FROM WHICH DR. THOMSON MADE HIS
INJECTIONS ON THE 17TH, 20TH, 21ST, 24TH AND 27TH JANUARY.
Subsequent History of this Bottle. —On the afternoon of 28th January, Dr. Thomson
handed the bottle to the Mayor in the presence of Mr. McLeod. It was taken by him to
Dr. McKeon’s surgery where in the presence of Messrs. Marshall, Finnimore, McLeod, McCarthy
(the Town Clerk), and the Mayor, Dr. McKeon withdrew about 0 -3 c.cm. using a sterile syringe,
but without sterilizing the top of the rubber cap.
This portion of the contents was placed in a small sterile rubber-stoppered phial. The
original bottle and the phial were now made up in separate packages and sealed by Mr. Marshall
in the presence of the above witnesses. The small phial was placed in the safe at the Council
Chambers and handed over to Dr. Tilling on 31st January. Dr. Tilling took it to Brisbane and
placed it in safe deposit, together with another sealed package containing the needles and syringe
used by Dr. Thomson. They were forwarded by registered post to the Commission at Melbourne
on the 3rd February.
The sealed package containing the original bottle was placed in the safe at the Council
Chambers and handed to Dr. Murray on 30th January. Dr. Murray took it to Brisbane and
handed it to Dr. Elkington who enclosed it in a second sealed package and transmitted it by post
to the Health Department, Melbourne. On arrival on the 3rd February, 1928, the registered
package was at once handed over to the Commission and was opened at the Hall Institute by
the members of the Commission who found that the wrappings placed on the package at Bundaberg
and Brisbane had not been tampered with, and that the seals were intact. The second sample
arrived by post at the Hall Institute on 6th February, 1928, and when opened the seals of the
original packages made up in Bundaberg were also found to be intact.
The bottle was examined on the evening of its arrival in Melbourne. It contained
1 -45 c.cm. of turbid fluid, 1 -25 c.cm. of which was removed, after the rubber cap had
been sterilized by methylated spirit and flaming, with a syringe sterilized by boiling in water
for 25 minutes. The operation of withdrawing the contents was carried out in a dust-free
cabinet. 0.2 c.cm. was subsequently estimated as remaining in the bottle.
The total amount actually used in immunizing injections in Bundaberg was said to be
7.0 c.cm. With 1.47 c.cm. in this bottle and 0.3 c.cm. previously withdrawn by Dr. McKeon
forming the second sample (B.T.AT. (2)) examined, there remains 1.23 c.cm. to be accounted
for. or possibly slightly more if, as is usual, generous measure is given in filling the bottle. It is
not unreasonable to suppose that this is fully accounted for by wastage in the dead space of the
syringe and needle and in adjusting dosage when 45 separate injections on five occasions have
been given. Dr. Thomson states definitely in his evidence that more was removed on each
occasion than was necessary.
MICROSCOPICAL AND BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION OF THE FATAL
BOTTLE.
A. — Microscopical. —Films were made immediately from the contents of the rubber-
capped bottle of toxin-antitoxin used at Bundaberg (labelled B.T.AT.). When spread on glass
slides a distinct acid odor could be recognized with the nose close to the slides. The films were
stained by Gram’s and Ziehl Neelsen’s methods. They showed numerous gram-positive cocci
which varied somewhat in size and arrangement. They were mostly in pairs or as single cocci,
but also in short chains of four to six cocci. There was also much amorphous and granular
gram-negative material. Seven films altogether were examined and in five of them a few clumps
of yeast were found, but apart from the staphylococci, no other organisms of any kind.
B. — Bacteriological. —Cultures were made immediately from the aseptically removed
contents of the rubber-capped bottle on or in the following media, with the results as shown ;
(1) Two (2) rubber-capped bottles of toxin-antitoxin of Batch 78a prepared recently
at the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories and containing no antiseptic.
0 -01 c.cm. was injected through the rubber cap into each bottle. One bottle
was incubated at 37° C. and the other left at room temperature"(2o-32° C.),
whilst a third uninoculated bottle was placed in the incubator at 37° C. The


latter remained perfectly transparent during the subsequent five (6) days,
and at later dates it was still quite clear. The inoculated bottles became
slightly turbid on the following day, particularly that at 37° C., and the
turbidity of both was greater on the second day. On the third day some of
the toxin-antitoxin was removed, films were made and also subcultures into
alkaline meat medium and glucose brain broth. The films showed only gram-
positive cocci, diplococci, short chains of three and four cocci, and many small
groups or clusters of cocci. Films made later from the subcultures in the
above-mentioned media showed a very similar picture and hanging drop
preparations showed mainly diplococci, but also short chains of four cocci and
clusters.
(2) Four (4) tubes of glucose brain broth. These were inoculated with one platinum
loopful, one of each incubated aerobically and anaerobically at 37° C. and at
room temperature. The latest pattern of Mclntosh and Fildes anaerobic jars
was employed for all anaerobic cultivation. Growth was rapid aerobically at
37° and acidity without gas was noted within 24 hours, whilst the same
results were obtained at room temperature only on the second day. On the
fifth day the medium became alkaline and on the sixth a small amount of gas
was noted. Anaerobically there was more growth at 37° than at room
temperature. Films from these cultures showed gram-positive cocci,
diplococci, chains of three and four and even as many as six cocci, also tetrads
and small clusters. These aerobic and anaerobic cultures were plated on
blood agar aerobically and anaerobically and the anaerobic brain broths
re-inoculated into brain broth. The blood agar plates showed numerous
glistening white colonies resembling at first staphylococcus albus. A slight
degree of haemolysis was slowly produced, and the colour of the colonies
became slightly yellowish. There were no very small colonies where the
colonies were spaced out.
(3) Four (4) tubes of glucose broth prepared at this Institute were similarly inoculated
from the B.T.AT. and incubated as in 2. Turbidity and later greyish-white
deposit were noted in all tubes and plating on blood agar gave only colonies
of staphylococci. One small colony was picked off on to an agar slope, but
gave a typical growth of staphylococcus. Films from the glucose broths
showed again short chain formation as well as diplococci and clusters.
(4) Four (4) sloped agar tubes (hormone agar) incubated as in 2. Aerobically at
37° C. there was a good growth in 24 hours. It resembled staphylococcus
albus, and showed the typical microscopical appearances of the staphylococci.
After three days the growth was faintly yellowish, but on keeping never
became typically aureus. At room temperature growth was decidedly slower.
Anaerobically there was a good whitish growth at 37° C. in three days, no
visible growth in three days at room temperature, but a whitish growth
appeared later. Examination of films showed only staphylococci.
(5) Agar plates. One platinum loopful of B.T.AT. inoculated into melted agar,
well mixed and plated (shake cultures) gave innumerable colonies. One
loopful of one in ten dilution of B.T.AT. gave a moderate number of colonies,
of one in a hundred dilution a few colonies only, of one in a thousand dilution
very few colonies. At the time no counting of colonies was carried out, but
experience obtained since by repeating this experiment with other bottles
allows us to be reasonably certain that the number of living cocci in the bottle
when received by us on 3rd February was not greater than 200 millions per
c.cm. The whitish surface colonies grew to a considerable size and became
of a slight yellowish colour in three days. The deep colonies were lenticular.
Five of the smaller surface colonies were picked off on to sloped agar, but
proved to be of the same type. Anaerobic plates were also made in the same
way with similar results. All films showed only staphylococci.
(6) Glucose agar plates. The glucose agar was prepared at the Commonwealth
Serum Laboratories. Shake cultures were made as in (5) and incubated
aerobically and anaerobically. The results were much the same as in (5).
(7) Blood agar plates. Surface stroke cultures were made, using two plates each
for undiluted B.T.AT. and for dilutions of one in ten, one in a hundred and
one in a thousand. One set was incubated aerobically and the other
anaerobically. On the aerobic plates falling numbers of colonies resembling


staphylococcus albus were found next day. After three days there was slight
haemolysis. Nine colonies were picked off and subcultured. Staphylococci
were alone found in films of these subcultures. There was a good growth also
on the anaerobic plates and seven of the smaller colonies were subcultured on
to sloped blood agar and incubated anaerobically. In 24 hours these showed
whitish confluent growth or separate colonies, but films of these showed
staphylococci, mostly clusters, but also diplococci and chains of three or four
cocci.
(8) Sloped serum agar prepared at the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories. Stroke
cultures were made with one loopful of one in a hundred and one in a thousand
dilutions of B.T.AT. were made and incubated aerobically and anaerobically.
The lesser dilution gave whitish discrete colonies and some confluence, the
greater dilutions only discrete colonies. Two colonies of smaller type were
subcultured but proved to be staphylococci. After three days the confluent
growth was slightly yellowish. The anaerobic cultures gave good growths of
staphylococci within three days.
(9) Glucose broth prepared at the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories. The results
were much the same as in (3) and do not warrant separate description.
(10) Plain broth. Aerobic cultivation at 37° C. gave a moderate turbidity with
some deposit in twenty hours, and on the third day there was a scum on the
surface against the glass of the test tube. Plating on blood agar gave only
staphylococci which produced haemolysis slowly. Anaerobic cultures gave
only staphylococci.
(11) Alkaline meat medium prepared at the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories.
One set was covered with a layer of paraffin and the other was not covered.
Aerobic cultivation at 37° C. gave turbidity in 24 hours. Plating on blood
agar gave only staphylococci. No gas was observed in subsequent observations
up to twenty days. Films of the cultures at room temperature showed only
staphylococci. Anaerobic cultivation gave only staphylococci and there was
no gas production.
Some of the one in ten dilution of B.T.AT. was heated at 60° C. for 30 minutes and then
incubated on to serum agar and into glucose brain broth. No growth took place within ten
days.
To exclude the possibility that our media were unsuitable for the growth of anaerobic and
sporing forms we inoculated control tubes with B. chauvei. Good growth was obtained with
all the media tested.
Examination of sample withdrawn by Dr. McKeon —The remainder of the contents of
the fatal bottle were received in a small ampoule sealed with a small rubber cork on 7th
February. It was labelled by us B.T.AT. 2. As described elsewhere, the volume of the contents
was very small. Indicators showed the P h to be between 7-5 and 8. Films indicated a smaller
number of organisms than in the original bottle. They were gram-positive cocci, most
numerous as single cocci, but also many diplococci and less often three cocci in a row or forming
a triangle. No definite chains or bacilli were seen. There was much gram-negative material,
mostly in coccoid forms ; a few doubtful forms which were probably yeasts were present.
The contents were plated on blood agar. Most of the colonies were white resembling
those grown from the original bottle, and there were a few smaller colonies. Subcultures
of these large and small colonies were made on sloped blood agar. One large and one
small colony gave a confluent whitish growth of staphylococci resembling that found in the
original bottle, but one small colony gave an orange-yellow confluent growth of staphylococci.
It was not known whether this latter was another contamination made in Bundaberg in
withdrawing the sample from the bottle to the ampoule, a variant from the less orange type, or
an air contamination of the blood agar plates.
Cultures were also made in two alkaline meat tubes and in two glucose brain broths,
incubated aerobically. After two days the former were turbid and one showed a bubble or two
of gas. Films, however, showed only gram-positive cocci in short chains and in groups. No
bacilli could be found.
The glucose brain broths were turbid and showed acidity in two days. Films showed
cocci, mostly in clusters. No bacilli could be found.
No animal inoculations were made direct from this second sample.


ANIMAL INOCULATIONS.
There was obviously an insufficient amount of material available in the original bottle for
its complete characterization as a mixture of diphtheria toxin and antitoxin by subcutaneous
inoculation into guinea pigs and, for reasons detailed elsewhere in this report, it seemed unlikely
that excess of diphtheria toxin would prove to be responsible for the tragedy.
At a later stage on our return from Bundaberg, we used the intradermic test with and
without added antitoxin to determine the presence of free toxin in some of this original
material.
This was done by injecting into the skin of a white guinea pig in a total volume of 0 -2 c.cm.
the following doses of the material—o -02 c.cm., 0 -01 c.cm., 0 -005 c.cm. and 0 -002 c.cm. with and
without 0 -002 c.cm. of standard antitoxin. None of these doses produced the slightest skin
reaction, and as from 1/250 to 1/500 of the M.L.D. of diphtheria toxin gives a definite skin
reaction, it may fairly be concluded that at the time when these tests were performed, nearly
a month after the tragedy, the material did not contain a significant amount of free diphtheria
toxin. Our subsequent experimental evidence has shown the remarkable stability of old diph-
theria toxin in the presence of the staphylococcus which was isolated from the material (Appendix
25) and it may, therefore, be regarded as unlikely that significant excess of diphtheria toxin
was present at any time in the bottle.
In the immediate investigation of the material for the presence of some unknown toxin
of extreme potency or of a virulent living organism, we considered it advisable to test its action
in as many species as possible, and to utilize intravenous injections which would afford small
doses of any toxic substance present the best chance of producing fatal effects.
The animals which we used were rabbits, guinea pigs and mice. In addition to intravenous
injections in these animals we decided to give to three monkeys doses comparable with those
administered to the children at Bundaberg. The monkeys were said to be about three years
old and weighed 4, 3-5 and 2-6 kilos respectively. 0-2 c.cm., 0-1 c.cm., and 0-2 c.cm. of the
contents of the fatal bottle were given subcutaneously. The first of these animals was protected
against any possible free diphtheria toxin by the subcutaneous injection three hours earlier of
6,000 units of antitoxin. None of them had any illness following the injections. Though many
living organisms were shown to be present in the injected material, no abscess resulted at the
site of injection. The animals were in excellent condition two (2) months later and were used
again for the experiments detailed in Appendix 26.
Rabbits. —Two rabbits of 2 -4 and 1 -8 kilos were inoculated intravenously each with 0 ' 1
c.cm. of the material. Both of these became definitely ill within 24 hours. One died on the
fifth day with a broncho-pneumonia and septic infarcts in both kidneys from which a pure culture
of a staphylococcus was obtained (identical with that isolated from the original material). The
second was killed,on the thirtieth day when moribund. It developed a stiff and painful left
elbow joint 48 hours after injection and appeared to be definitely ill for some days. On the
twenty-sixth day complete paralysis of both hind limbs developed, as has been described in
experimental staphylococcal infections in this animal. At autopsy there were no obvious lesions
in any of the joints, and the brain and spinal cord were macroscopically normal. The only definite
macroscopic lesions were extensive organized infarctions of both kidneys, which were sterile on
culture.
Guinea Pigs. —Three guinea pigs of about 250 grams weight were injected, one with ‘O5
c.cm. of the material subcutaneously, and two with -03 and -035 c.cm. intravenously. A fourth
guinea pig received -02 c.cm. of the material which had been heated to 60° C. for half an hour.
The subcutaneous injection caused no trace of infiltration. The other animals which received
intravenous injections were not very well for a few days and showed some loss of weight. They
all survived and three of them when killed and examined nearly a month later showed no obvious
lesions at autopsy. The fourth animal received an intravenous injection of 1-0 c.cm. horse
serum on the fifty-fourth day when it weighed 400 grams, and no anaphylactic symptoms resulted.
Mice. —Eight mice weighing from 16 to 26 grams were injected intravenously by the tail
vein with O' 1 c.cm. of alin 10 dilution of the material. They showed no symptoms of illness
following the injection except one weighing 16 grams in which part of the injection was given
subcutaneously. This animal was very sick within 24 hours, and was found dead on the second
day. No definite lesions were present at autopsy. A second mouse was found dead on the
fifteenth day, and the uterus was distended with caseous material.
Two mice of 17 and 15 grams were injected intravenously by the tail vein with -01 c.cm.
of the material diluted 1-10 with sahne and heated to 60° C. for half an hour. These also showed
no ill-effects following the injection.


The results of these inoculations into animals are very unimpressive. There is nothing to
suggest the presence of free diphtheria toxin in the bottle and its contents show, in the dosage
used, no great toxicity or pathogenicity for laboratory animals. It seems probable that we are
concerned either with great loss of activity of the contents of the bottle during the week which
elapsed between its use on 27th January, and its examination by us on 3rd February, or with an
activity which could only be manifested by injection into young susceptible human subjects.
We are inclined to think that the material had lost some of its activity, that the doses we used
would with advantage have been larger and administered to fewer animals, but that it is not
unlikely that all the laboratory animals used were unsuitable for the purpose of testing its
activity.
Subculture from B.T.AT. 2 into a bottle of toxin-antitoxin mixture (M.S.C. 3.) incubated
at room temperature grew rapidly. Guinea pigs inoculated on several successive days showed
no symptoms and smears of the material contained only cocci. When, however, the residual
contents of the bottle were spun down and the deposit examined, two small clumps of yeast
were found. No yeasts were found on any of the cultures of B.T.AT. on solid media and later
attempts to grow them on Sabouraud’s media were unsuccessful.
The only organisms which could be recovered from the original bottle and the sample
removed by Dr. McKeon were staphylococci. The yeasts found in the original smears were
not recovered by culture and were very probably an “ air contamination.” It is extremely
unlikely that they had any pathogenic activity.


APPENDIX 19.
EXAMINATION OF THE BUNDABERG BOTTLE OF TOXIN-ANTITOXIN FOR IODINE.
We were interested in tlus question from the general standpoint of the possibility of the
entry into the rubber-capped bottles of liquids used for sterilizing the top of the rubber cap.
lodine as used by Dr. Thomson lends itself particularly well to the investigation of this point.
Other liquids used for the same purpose might quite conceivably have some deleterious action
on biological products, e.g., pyridine present ■in methylated spirit. Apart from these
considerations it seemed possible that iodine might have played some part in the accident we were
investigating.
When we had withdrawn as much as possible of the remaining contents of the bottle, we
asked Mr. F. H. Holden, the Research Biochemist of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, to
estimate the amount of iodine present in the remaining contents. These contents were estimated
to be 0 -075 c.cm. by washing out and weighing after removing the rubber cap. The method
used for iodine estimation was capable in practised hands of detecting with certainty 0 -0005
m.gm. The reagents were free from iodine in quantities capable of detection by the method used.
0 -003 m.gm. of iodine were found corresponding to 0 -04 m.gm. per c.cm. of toxin-antitoxin
mixture.
This of course represents the maximal amount of iodine ever present as it was doubtless
added to by successive needle punctures.
We were not able to show that iodine in half this concentration made any appreciable
difference to the growth of organisms or produced any product toxic to laboratory animals.
Neither did it aid in the dissociation of toxin from antitoxin. Toxin was quite stable in its
presence in this concentration. In higher concentrations it inhibited the growth of organisms
without producing any toxic products in toxin-antitoxin mixture.
The presence of iodine in the bottle is also suggestive of the ease with which organisms
could be carried in through the puncture in the rubber cap if the surface of the latter were not
efficiently sterilized.


APPENDIX 20.
ON THE POSSIBILITY OF TETANUS BEING THE CAUSE OF THE FATALITIES.
We were not impressed in this connexion by evidence obtainable as to the symptomatology
presented by the children at Bundaberg, nor did any local practitioner who saw the affected
children make a diagnosis of tetanus. The microscopical .and cultural examination of the
bottle of toxin-antitoxin mixture used by Dr. Thomson lent no support to this view, nor
were we aware of such great individual variations in susceptibility to tetanus toxin as was
shown by these children to the inoculated material. As shown elsewhere, several children
died within 24 hours and several showed no symptoms following an injection of 0.125 c.cm..
and moreover none of the children inoculated three and six days previously suffered any illness.
The two questions we endeavoured to answer were —(1) Would the addition of a small
number of tetanus bacilli to toxin-antitoxin result in the production of tetanus toxin in doses
possibly lethal to children ? (2) Would tetanus bacilli or their spores, having .grown in the toxin-
antitoxin, be demonstrable after a lapse of time, or might the bacilli multiply, produce toxin,
and then disappear 1
An agar culture of B. tetani (Clostridium tetani) was obtained from the Commonwealth
Serum Laboratories. Films showed mostly typical drum stick forms, but also a few free spores,
non-spored forms and long forms. A weak emulsion was made in normal saline and 0.1 c.cm.
injected into one rubber-capped bottle (referred to later as No. 1), of toxin-antitoxin containing
no phenol (Batch 86), into another (No. 2) containing 0.5 per cent, phenol (batch 111), also
into two bottles (Nos. 3, batch 86 and 4, batch 111) which received in addition 0.2 c.cm. of a 1 in
10,000 dilution of an emulsion of the Bundaberg staphylococcus, an inoculation of 1,000 to 2,000
cocci per c.cm. of toxin-antitoxin in the bottle. These four bottles were placed in an incubator
which was at first set at 75° F. (24° C.) and later at 80° F. (26.5° C.).
Guinea pigs were inoculated subcutaneously with 0.2 c.cm. from each of these bottles
after two days, with 0.5 c.cm. of Bottles 3 and 4 after five days, with 0.5 c.cm. of each bottle
after eight days, with 0.5 c.cm. of Bottle 1 after ten days, with 0.5 c.cm. of each bottle after
thirteen days and after twenty days. None of these animals showed any local lesions or any
signs of tetanus during the 34 days following the commencement of, these inoculations.
Altogether, therefore, nineteen animals were inoculated at various intervals and all survived.
Their average weight at the time of inoculation was 231 grams. A few showed a slight loss of
or failure to gain weight for a few days, but during the period of observation stated above the
average gain in weight was 73 grams. There were no deaths among these animals, which
remained in splendid condition, during a further period of 3 weeks, when they were discarded.
• When the bottles were inoculated, subcultures were also made from the same agar culture
of B. tetani on to agar and into alkaline meat medium. These were incubated at 37° 0., the
former in an anaerobic jar. and good growths were obtained which appeared to be pure when
examined microscopically. Subcultures on agar incubated aerobically showed no growth. 0.2
c.cm. of a three days’ culture in alkaline meat medium killed a guinea pig in two days. No
infiltration could be felt at the site of inoculation. Also a guinea pig inoculated with 0.2 c.cm.
of a four days’ culture in plain broth was found in convulsions nineteen hours later and died
after a further two and a half hours.
Subcultures were made from the bottles of toxin-antitoxin at intervals. No. 3 bottle
became slightly turbid in two days, Nos. I, 2 and 4 were still perfectly clear after six clays. The
turbidity in No. 3 bottle was due mainly to the staphylococcus a,s was shown by plating on agar
anaerobically. Plating after two days gave no tetanus colonies, after five days a few filamentous
forms were found amongst the staphylococci in films made from the plate, and after ten days
subcultures from Bottle No. 3 into alkaline meat medium gave gas formation and both B. tetani
and staphylococci were found microscopically, whereas a meat tube heated to 80° C. for fifteen
minutes after inoculation gave only B. tetani. Plating from this bottle after twelve days gave a
mixture of staphylococci and B. tetani. Films made from a drop of the contents showed a few
spored and unspored bacilli and a few gram positive diplococci and cocci. Some of this bottle
was also centrifuged and the deposit showed also B. tetani and staphylococci. In fact there
appeared to have been some growth of B. tetani in No. 3 bottle, though 0.5 c.cm. did not cause
any ill-effects in the guinea pig.
Subcultures into meat media from Bottles 1, 2 and 4 also gave prompt growth of B. tetani,
though films made from the toxin-antitoxin and from the deposit obtained by centrifuging showed
few bacilli. Finally, Bottle No. 3 (containing no phenol and inoculated with both B. tetani and
the Bundaberg staphylococcus) was subcultured on the twenty-first day into a tube of meat
medium and this was immediately heated to 80° C. for fifteen minutes. After several days
incubation at 37° C., 0.1 c.cm. of this subculture killed a guinea pig in 43 hours, death being
preceded by convulsions, whilst 0.2 c.cm. killed in 21 \ hours.


We are of the opinion that the contamination by the Bundaberg staphylococcus took
place at Bundaberg during inoculations on some day previous to the 27th January. It seems
reasonable to suppose that a contamination by B. tetani would have occurred either at Bundaberg
or at the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories. These experiments do not lend any support to
a contamination by B. tetani either at the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories or at Bundaberg.
With regard to the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories there is no evidence before us that any
other bottle of Batch 86 or of 78a gave rise to tetanus, though large numbers of inoculations
have been carried out with them. This contingency would mean that first of all the toxin-anti-
toxin was contaminated by 8., tetani at the laboratories in November, that the bacillus began
to multiply subsequently,* that the bottle was then contaminated at Bundaberg by the
staphylococcus, that a lethal dose of tetanus toxin was produced only between the 24th and 27th
January, so that on the 20th and 24th, for example, numbers of children could be inoculated
without the slightest suggestion of tetanus toxin poisoning, and finally, that B. tetani disappeared
so completely by the 3rd February that they could neither be found in films nor cultivated in
suitable media.
Now in the one bottle of Batch 86 (Bottle No. 1) which received a small inoculation of
B. tetani only, there appeared to be little if any multiplication or toxin production in twenty
days, though B. tetani could be cultivated from the bottle by inoculating small quantities into
meat medium or by plating on agar. The growth of the staphylococcus appeared to favour a
slight and slow growth of B. tetani, but this was scarcely appreciable within 8 days, and there
was no evidence of the production of tetanus toxin in doses lethal to guinea pigs. It was not
thought necessary to look for the presence of doses smaller than this.
• With the exception of the time taken by transport to Brisbane this bottle was kept at low temperatures until 6th January. From this date to the
27th January it was kept at room temperatures averaging not higher than 80° Fahrenheit (26.5° C.)


APPENDIX 21.
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT ORGANISMS OTHER THAN STAPHYLOCOCCI WERE
PRESENT IN THE BUNDABERG BOTTLE OF TOXIN-ANTITOXIN MIXTURE,
WHICH HAD DIED OUT OR BEEN DESTROYED BY PROTEOLYTIC
ACTIVITY OF THE STAPHYLOCOCCI ?
The examination of smears of the material in the bottle of Batch 86 received from
Dr. Thomson revealed the presence, in addition to enormous numbers of cocci, of a few clumps
of yeasts which could not be recovered by culture. Their presence and the results of our
experiments on air contamination, raised the question as to whether it was possible that some
other organism had once been numerous and had first been overgrown and subsequently dissolved
by the activity of the staphylococci which alone were cultivated from the bottle in a large number
of media.
To test this hypothesis we inoculated a streptococcus (faecalis) and the Bundaberg
staphylococcus together into a rubber-capped bottle of toxin-antitoxin mixture of Batch 86 and
incubated it at 80° F. 1-0 c.cm. of the mixture was injected on the first, second, third, sixth,
and ninth days into guinea pigs and in no case were any symptoms produced other than slight
temporary loss of weight and local ulceration. On the tenth day both organisms were recovered
by plating.
B. proteus X 19 was inoculated into a rubber-capped bottle of Batch 78a and after
24 hours the Bundaberg staphylococcus was also inoculated in a dose of about 1,000 organisms.
Injections into guinea pigs in doses of 0 -5 c.cm. were made on first, second, third, fourth, fifth
and eighth days. Beyond some local ulceration and loss of weight no symptoms were noted,
though the animal inoculated on the fifth day was very slow in recovering its original weight.
After nine days incubation at room temperature (about 23° C.) both organisms were recovered
by plating. Another bottle was inoculated with B. proteus Xl9 alone in a dose of about 1,000
organisms. A similar series of animal injections were made without positive results. These
experiments are of particular interest in that an organism with strong proteolytic powers
apparentl}' failed to cause any obvious dissociation of diphtheria toxin from toxin-antitoxin
mixture.
Other streptococci tested for powers of growth and survival for ten days in toxin-
antitoxin mixture were a haemolytic strain from a puerperal case and one from a case of scarlet
fever. Guinea pigs were inoculated at the intervals described above and none showed any
symptoms. The organisms were recovered from the bottles at the end of the experiment.
Similar experiments were later carried out with B. tetani (Appendix 20). In view of these
findings it did not seem worth while pursuing this line of inquiry further.
No experiments were made with yeasts as we had been unable to recover them by culture
either on the many media in which the staphylococcus grew, in bottles of toxin-antitoxin, or
later, on special media.
It is very unlikely that any pathogenic organisms of microscopic size other than the
staphylococci were at any time present in any considerable numbers in Dr. Thomson’s bottle.
If, as is possible, a few other contaminating organisms got in, they should, if they had grown, have
been recoverable by culture when the bottle reached us.
We cannot exclude the presence of a pathogenic filter-passing organism in the Bundaberg
bottle, but it is exceedingly improbable that any such organism would have grown in so feebly
nutrient a medium. The only organism other than the staphylococcus of whose presence in
Dr. Thomson’s bottle we have evidence, is the yeast which we were unable to recover and which
did not appear to have multiplied to any extent in the bottle. Unlike the case of the
staphylococcus, we cannot exclude the possibility that this organism was introduced by
Dr. McKeon in taking a sample (Appendix 18).

APPENDIX 22.
REPORT OF SEROLOGICAL AND OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF STAPHYLOCOCCI
ASSOCIATED WITH THE BUNDABERG INVESTIGATION.
Dr. F. M. Burnet, of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, who worked out for us the
relationship of the various staphylococci isolated in these experiments, contributes the following
summary of his results :
Material.
Numerous cultures from the original bottle used by Dr. Thomson showed the same
organism, and for stock a single colony was taken from one of the original serum agar slopes
made on the 3rd February, 1928. This is named “Bundaberg” in the following.
From anaerobic glucose broth cultures inoculated from the original bottle a number of
aureus colonies were obtained and stock culture B.T 2 was developed from one of these. Reasons
will be given for considering this a variant of the original Bundaberg strain.
Other material was as follows :
1. Agar slope cultures of organisms from abscesses in children’s arms —

These were all of the same appearance, white with a faint creamy tinge
in young cultures, as the Bundaberg staphylococcus.
2. Agar slope culture from abscess of buttock (E.D. (B)).
3. Staphylococci isolated from Dr. Thomson’s water bottle (W. 8.) and rainwater
tank (Tank) by Dr. Tebbutt on agar slopes.
4. Several strains of staphylococci obtained from bottles of toxin-antitoxin mixture
injected with air in Bundaberg, viz., Fl (albus), F 3 (albus), F 8 (albus), F?
(aureus).
5. Two strains isolated from bottles into which Dr. Thomson had injected air in
removing samples for demonstration of his technique at Bundaberg, viz., T2.A.
(albus), T 2.8. (albus).
Several sera eventually pooled were made by immunizing rabbits against “ Bundaberg,”
the final titre being approximately 1,280.
Sera were also made against strain B.T 2 .
Agglutinating emulsions were made from all the strains available, in the usual way —
growth on agar and emulsification in formalized saline to an opacity corresponding to 2,000 millions
per c.cm.
These were tested with each serum with the -results tabulated below. In the same table
are shown the colour and the haemolytic power of the various strains on human blood agar.

It will be seen that the cultures from the arms of the various survivors form a compact
group differing in no important point amongst themselves. They are identical with the
Bundaberg staphylococcus except in the one respect that they agglutinate to a consistently lower
titre with the heterologous serum B.T 2 .
Absorption experiments with the two sera and their homologous strains indicate that
B.T 2 possesses two antigens, one in common with “ Bundaberg,” the other specific. This is
compatible with the view that B.T 2 is a variant of “ Bundaberg ” analogous to a partly “ rough ”
strain, although m the present absence of knowledge concerning the serological changes with
staphylococcal variation no stress can be laid on this interpretation.
The serum “ Bundaberg ” agglutinated several typical pyogenic aureus strains from
other sources to full titre, and this organism must be regarded as a serologically typical pyogenic
strain as first described by Kolle and Otto, and confirmed (on the whole) by Julianelle, Hine
and others. The various strains derived from air and water at Bundaberg seem to belong to
the unrelated non-pyogenic strains with the possible exception of T 2.8, which is closely related
to the presumed variant of “ Bundaberg ” B.T 2 .
The difference in the history of the strains is probably sufficient to account for the slight
distinction in serological behaviour between “ Bundaberg ” and the strains derived from the
children’s arms.
The identity of all these strains is also supported by two incidental lines of evidence
They all show under appropriate conditions Muller’s phenomenon on human blood agar, i.e., an
appearance of punctate haemolysis in a zone extending several millimetres beyond the limits of
growth of the organism. This phenomenon is rather rare amongst staphylococci, two others
only of about a dozen tested showing it.
In the second place a bacteriophage was obtained weakly active against strain
“ Bundaberg.” This was tested against a number of staphylococcal strains with the results
tabulated, the number of +’s indicating the relative degree of lysis on agar.
In all cases where lysis occurred it was incomplete and was followed by secondary growth.
Staphylococcal bacteriophages fall into two types, one type is active against almost all varieties
of staphylococci with the exception of specifically resistant variants, the other is practically
confined to the homologous strain (d’Herelle, Gratia, Callow and others). The sensitivity of all
the arm cultures and these only to the phage active against “ Bundaberg ” is, therefore, very
strong evidence of their identity with this strain.
In regard to the strain E.D. (buttock), its characteristics (aureus, haemolytic, not sensitive
to phage) are sufficient to separate it from the “ Bundaberg ” group despite its practical serological
identity. It resembles in all respects a normal pyogenic aureus and is serologically distinct
from the aureus variant obtained from “ Bundaberg.”
Later work has shown that in its agglutination and absorption reactions its sensitivity to
bacteriophage and its reactions on blood agar the Bundaberg strain is identical with Hine’s
Type 11. (Lancet , 1922), strain 1,393 of the national collection of type cultures.
Conclusions.
The organism “ Bundaberg ” obtained from the implicated bottle is identical with the
staphylococci recovered from the children’s arms in the cases of 8.D., W.S., 8.P., E.D. and
Y.T.C.
None of the organisms obtained by injection of air into toxin-antitoxin bottles (or from
the water supply) at Bundaberg are of this type.
The staphylococcus obtained from the lesion in the buttock (E.D. (B)) is also not of the type.


APPENDIX 23.
THE PATHOGENICITY OF THE BUNDABERG STAPHYLOCOCCUS TO
LABORATORY ANIMALS.
The experiments detailed in Appendix 18 do not suggest that this organism is. with
the single exception of the rabbit, highly pathogenic for the ordinary laboratory animals. A
large number of experiments with guinea pigs, and a few with mice, rabbits and monkeys have
been concerned with the pathogenicity of the staphylococcus when grown in toxin-antitoxin
mixture (Appendix 26).
In this place we have gathered together a few of the results of inoculation of cultures and
emulsions from various media which indicate the somewhat variable pathogenicity of the
organism for rabbits, and its low pathogenicity for monkeys, guinea pigs, and mice.
Subcutaneous and intramuscular injections in these animals do not produce fatal results.
These can only be obtained by intravenous or intraperitoneal inoculation.
In mice of about 20 grams weight inoculated intraperitoneally with a saline emulsion from
a 24-hours agar slope culture, 5,000 million organisms kill in from six to eight hours, 500 million
in twenty hours, while with doses of 50 millions the animals survive.
In guinea pigs of 250 to 300 grams weight, 500 to 1,000 million organisms cause a small
local abscess when injected subcutaneously. There is also a temporary decline in body weight.
Doses of 200 million organisms injected intravenously kill on about the fourth day. A fatal
result is produced in six days by injecting intravenously 0.5 c.cm. of a twenty-hour broth culture
while the same culture in twice the dose injected intramuscularly fails to kill and causes only
local abscesses.
In rabbits weighing approximately 1 kilo., 200 and 400 million organisms when injected
intravenously killed on the second and sixth day, and 10 million organisms killed one of two
animals on the tenth day. Five hundred and 1,000 million staphylococci injected subcutaneously
caused only a small local lesion and the same doses given intramuscularly gave only local effects
with small loss of weight. Comparing intravenous and intramuscular injections with a
twenty-hour broth culture, doses of 1.0 c.cm. by the latter route caused only local lesions and
loss of weight, while half this dose given intravenously killed on the third day. In these late
deaths the usual pyaemic lesions in the kidneys were found at autopsy.
Intravenous injections of broth cultures of the staphylococcus were also made into a number
of young monkeys.
Monkeys 5,6, and 7 had earlier received subcutaneous injections of cultures of the
staphylococcus in toxin-antitoxin mixture. The results of these injections are described in
Appendix 26.
Monkey 5, which weighed 2 -1 kilos, received 1.0 c.cm. of a 24 hours’ culture which had
been inoculated with one platinum loopful of a standard emulsion from an agar slope, which was
itself a subculture from a culture of the staphylococcus grown in a mixture of monkey blood
and toxin-antitoxin. No effect was apparent in thirteen days and the weight was then 2-5 kilos.
Monkey 6, which weighed 2 -27 kilos, received 2 -0 c.cm. of a 24-hour broth culture inoculated
direct from defibrinated monkey blood, in which the staphylococcus had grown for three days,
after passage through decreasing dilutions of monkey blood with toxin-antitoxin mixture. A
slight rise in temperature was observed next day, but no obvious illness resulted.
After nine days the weight was found to be 2-13 kilos. The lymph glands in the groin
were enlarged though the local lesions resulting from the previous subcutaneous inoculations
had quite disappeared.
Monkey 7, which weighed 2 -35 kilos, received 2-0 c.cm. of the same broth culture as
monkeys 6 and 10, but after 48 hours incubation. A slight rise of temperature also occurred
next day, but no obvious illness resulted for eight days when his weight was found to be 2-38
kilos and he appeared well. Two days later he went off his food. On the eleventh day he was
obviously ill, eating very little, temperature only 36° C. He was found dead but still warm the


next morning. He had not had diarrhoea. Weight 1-9 kilos. Autopsy revealed a remarkable
picture oflacute generalized staphylococcal infection. There were haemorrhages into the skin
and serous membrane and small vegetations on the mitral valve. The spleen was enlarged and
firm and showed recent firm infarcts of large size. The liver was congested but showed no focal
lesions. The kidneys showed haemorrhages and one recent infarct and were much swollen. The
retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymph glands were markedly swollen and of dark colour. Cultures
gave staphylococci resembling “ Bundaberg ” from heart blood, liver, spleen, lymph glands
(several), and kidney all in pure culture.
The histological examination of the liver shows congestion of the sinusoids, central veins
and portal branches, accumulations of small and large mononuclear cells in some of the portal
tracts, and occasional small areas of focal necrosis in or near portal tracts.
In the spleen there is much engorgement of the pulp, and relatively small malpighian
bodies, many of which show central necrosis, sometimes involving thrombosis of the arteriole.
All the glands examined show haemolymph characters. They are extremely engorged
and oedematous with dilatation especially of the medullary sinuses which contain abundant
large phagocytic endothelial cells stuffed with red corpuscles. A large number of the lymph
follicles have necrotic centres which, like those seen in the liver and spleen, are mostly in process
of absorption.
In many points there is a close resemblance in the condition of these glands to some of
those examined from the children at Bundaberg, and the appearances observed suggest the
possibility that some of these also may be of haemolymph type, though the difficulty or
impossibility of recognizing red cells in sections of engorged vessels in these cases allows no
security of opinion.
Gram’s stain reveals abundant staphylococci distributed everywhere through the tissues
examined. They are seen in the blood stream, occasionally plugging small vessels in the glands
and spleen, in phagocytes, in the swollen Kiipffer cells and even in the liver cells themselves.
It is notable that their presence does not appear at any point to excite any focal reaction and
nothing in the nature of abscess formation is seen. Polymorphs are not a conspicuous feature
of any of the sections.
Monkey 10, weighing 2 -75 kilos, received 1 -0 c.cm. of the same broth culture (24 hours)
as Monkey 5. The temperature response following the injection may be regarded as typical in
this series of experiments. Before inoculation the rectal temperatures of all the animals lay
between 38 -5° C. to 38-75° C. On the second and third days the temperatures in Monkey 10
were 38 -75° C. and 39° C. and the animal was sulky. On the sixth and the following three days
the temperatures were 39 -2° C., 38 -9° C., 38 -9° C. and 38° C., and the animal looked well and was
active and eating well. Its weight on the fourteenth day was 2-6 kilos. There were then
enlarged glands in the groin particularly on the right side, but no other signs or symptoms of
illness.
Monkey 11, weighing 1 -6 kilos, temperature 38 -3° C., received 2 -0 c.cm. of the same
broth culture (48 hours) as Monkey 7. This animal was already underweight and sullen. On
the second day the temperature was 38 *l° C., on the third 38 -6° C., on the fourth 37 -8° C. It
developed diarrhoea and on the seventh day the temperature was still lower. It refused food
and was moribund on the ninth day. No abscesses were discovered at autopsy and no lesions
of the internal organs other than enlargement of the mesenteric lymph glands. Cultures from the
heart blood and pericardial fluid were sterile. The cultures from the spleen when plated grew
a few colonies resembling the Bundaberg stphylococcus. Death was apparently due to entero-
colitis. *
Monkeys 7 and 11 were the only animals in this series which succumbed, and of these
Monkey 7 alone showed a generalized infection. Monkey 11 received the same intravenous
injection but not the preliminary subcutaneous ones, and died within the period of development
of the disease in Monkey 7, possibly from an intercurrent bowel affection. There is a possibility
that the previous subcutaneous injection of a four-day culture of the staphylococcous in toxin-
antitoxin mixture may have determined the fatal issue, but it seems more probable that the
important factors were the larger number of organisms later introduced (48 hours culture) and
the individual susceptibility of the animal in question.

•78a B =» battle of batch 784 inoculated from the original Bundaberg bottle (BT.AT-) and incubated at room temperature (Appendix 1$).
For the ordinary laboratory animals this staphylococcus is of about average virulence.
Its virulence for rabbits is somewhat variable. The first sub-culture from the Bundaberg bottle
showed surprising virulence and killed a large rabbit so quickly as to give no time for the
production of any obvious lesions.
Two of these animals which died rapidly, convulsed continuously before death. This
symptom was never seen in the animals which died after longer periods with a less acute illness

APPENDIX 24.
PRODUCTION OF A SKIN-REACTING TOXIN FROM THE BUNDABERG
STAPHYLOCOCCUS.
It is known that filtrates from staphylococcal cultures may produce positive skin
reactions when injected intradermally in susceptible human individuals. This offered a
suggestion for an attempt to demonstrate the formation of an active toxin by the Bundaberg
staphylococcus, and Dr. F. M. Burnet has kindly carried out experiments for us of which a brief
resume is given here.
If a staphylococcal toxin played any important part in causing the Bundaberg deaths,
it must have been produced within a few hours of the introduction of the organisms into the
body. For this reason the tests were all made with filtrates from young cultures seven to eight
hours old. Preliminary experiments were done with cultures in a mixture of toxin-antitoxin
and human blood. In susceptible individuals a positive skin test was obtained with lin 500 or
lin 1,000 dilutions of a filtrate from such a culture. The reaction showed as an area of erythema
about 2 cm. in diameter with occasional slight subjacent swelling in all respects similar to a
positive Schick or Dick test. Later work showed that similar reactions were obtainable when
the cultures were grown in human blood broth and this medium was used for most of the
experiments.
5 c.cm. of freshly-drawn human blood was added to 10 c.cm. of citrated broth. The
tube was heavily inoculated from a young agar culture of the required staphylococcal strain
and incubated at 37° for seven or eight hours. The supernatant fluid was then pipetted off
from the deposited corpuscles and after dilution with saline (1 in 3) was passed through a Seitz
filter. The filtrate was tested for sterility and diluted to lin 500 as required. In addition to
the Bundaberg strain another staphylococcus (5.1.) was used. This was a typical pyogenic
aureus strain derived from a human skin lesion.
A mixed group of individuals was tested with these filtrates by the injection of 0.2 c.cm.
of 1 in 500 dilutions with the following results :
In each instance about half the individuals tested were sensitive to the filtrate at this
dilution.
The skin-reacting substances present in filtrates from the two organisms seem to be
distinct one from the other. The degree of reaction noted in each of the individuals who received
both filtrates is shown in the following table ; —
-t- + denotes a reaction 1 inch or more in diameter.
-j- denotes a reaction £ inch to 1 inch in diameter.

It will be seen that occasionally either filtrate may give a strong reaction while the other
is completely inert.
Filtrates from staphylococcal cultures in plain broth grown for the same length of time are
definitely less active than those from blood broth cultures although some skin-reacting substance
is produced. It seemed possible that differences in the amount of active agent produced might
be found according to whether the blood used in the medium were derived from susceptible or
non-susceptible individuals. The “ Bundaberg ” staphylococcus was, therefore, grown in
citrated Broth—
(a) with blood from a positively reacting individual,
( b ) from a non-reacting subject,
(c) without addition of blood.
Filtrates were tested on a susceptible subject with the following results :
If anything, the “ non-susceptible ” blood produces more of the skin-reacting substance,
but it is doubtful if the difference is significant.
We have further attempted in two of the workers in this Institute, F.B. and 8.5., to
ascertain whether the serum from N.W. (Case 8) who had no symptoms following the injection
on 27th January, could protect in sensitive individuals in a dilution of 1 in 20 against 1 in 1,000
and lin 400 of the toxin (filtrate of Bundaberg staphylococcus blood broth cultures). The serum
itself in this dilution produced a very slight reaction which is not surprising in view of its age and
the possibility of contamination. The dilution was of course filtered before use. As controls
in this experiment we injected 1 in 1,000 of the toxin alone and 1 in 1,000 and 1 in 400 of the toxin
mixed with a 1 in 10 dilution of the sera of R.G. and J.C. (both known skin reactors).
These preliminary observations are too few for any stress to be laid upon their interpreta-
tion. The Bundaberg staphylococcus grown under appropriate circumstances can produce a
substance whose activity is shown in specific skin reactions in a proportion of human individuals.
It may be that these reactions indicate differences in susceptibility to the general pathogenic
activity of the organism. This interpretation would be analogous to the current view of the
relationship between the Dick test and the variation of pathogenicity of the streptococcus of
scarlet fever in human individuals. A further point of resemblance is afforded by the absence of
any toxic effects when skin-reacting filtrates are injected in doses of 5 c.cm. (undiluted) into
laboratory animals (monkey, guinea pig and rabbit).
If the Bundaberg staphylococcus were responsible for the illness and deaths which
followed its subcutaneous injection on 27th January, these observations may be held to suggest
a partial explanation of the failure of some of the children to show any symptoms. It is obvious
that the crucial experiment of ascertaining whether the survivors at Bundaberg are or are not
sensitive to the skin-reacting substance cannot be carried out.

APPENDIX 25.
THE EFFECT OF THE BUNDABERG STAPHYLOCOCCUS ON TOXIN AND
ANTITOXIN SEPARATELY.
For this purpose it was decided to use toxin diluted to about the same concentration as
in Batch 86, to which normal sterile horse serum was added so as to make the protein content
of the mixture about equal to that of the toxin-antitoxin mixture. Similarly antitoxin was made
up containing approximately one unit per c.cm. with sugar free broth to take the place of toxin.
The toxin used was pooled 21a and 21d of the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories. The
antitoxic serum used was also prepared by the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories and consisted
of mixed batches of returned sera similar to those used in the preparation of Batch 86.
It was first of all necessary to determine the approximate L r dose of the toxin and the
titre of the antitoxin.
For the determination of the L -f- dose a number of guinea pigs weighing 250 grams were
inoculated subcutaneously with mixtures consisting of varying amounts of toxin with 1 -0 unit
of standard antitoxin. The mixtures were made up to a volume of 4-0 c.cm. with salineJand
allowed to stand one hour before injection.
The results of these tests are shown in Table 1.
The L -f- dose was, therefore, about -250 c.cm. for this toxin.
This dose of toxin was now put up with varying doses of 1 in 1,000 dilution of the antitoxic
serum to be used. The mixtures were made up to 4-0 c.cm. with saline and allowed to stand
one hour before injection into guineapigs of 250 grams weight. The results are shown in
Table 2.
We, therefore, regarded this antitoxin as containing approximately 1,250 units per c.cm.
The mixtures were, however, made up before the results of this last titration were
complete and were as follows ;
A. Toxin Mixture —
Toxin . . .. .. .. .. .. 20 c.cm.
Horse serum 1 in 20 in saline .. .. .. 1 -5 c.cm.
Saline . . .. . • ■ • • • .. 80 c.cm.
B. Antitoxin Mixture—
Sugar free broth .. .. .. • • 10 c.cm.
Antitoxin lin2o in saline .. .. .. 1 -s^c.cm.
Saline .. .. .. • • - • .. 90 c.cm.


In spite of the too small proportion of antitoxin in B, when 1 -5 c.cm. was added to an
equal quantity of A. and the mixture injected subcutaneously into a guineapig, the animal showed
no infiltration and gained weight steadily.
The mixtures were made up with full aseptic precautions and proved to be sterile in bulk.
Their P.h. was approximately 7.0.
They were now bottled in sterile amber glass bottles (obtained from used samples of Batch
86) containing approximately 10 c.cm. each and covered with rubber caps from the same source.
They were tested for sterility separately by inoculation of 0 -5 c.cm. into 10 c.cm. of broth, and
all but one or two bottles were found to be uncontaminated.
They were now inoculated with the Bundaberg staphylococcus and incubated at 80° F.
The dose inoculated was estimated by plating to be 7,000 cocci.. Growth took place in all the
bottles. (See Appendix 26.)
Each day in the earlier days of the experiment and later at longer intervals the titre of
toxin and of antitoxin was determined, and at the beginning and end of the experiment the
original bulk was similarly tested. In the case of antitoxin a further control was provided by
incubating an uninoculated rubber-capped bottle seven days at 80° F. Antitoxin was titrated
by the intradermic method using 0 -1 c.cm. of the following range of dilutions of the mixture—
-1 in 12 -5, 1 in 16 -6, 1 in 25, 1 in 33 -3 and 1 in 50, corresponding to -008, -006, -004, -003 and
•002 unit of antitoxin if the mixture had contained 1-0 unit of antitoxin per c.cm. An equal
volume of standard toxin solution was added to each dilution in a dose of 'OOO9 c.cm. ineachO'l
c.cm. Protection experiments were also carried out using some or all of the following dilutions of
B—l in 80, lin 70, lin 60, lin 50, lin 40, lin 30, lin 25 and lin 20. One c.cm. of each of
these was mixed with the C.L.D. of toxin, 0 -01 c.cm. in 1 c.cm. of saline and the mixture after
standing an hour was injected subcutaneously into guineapigs weighing between 240 and 260
grams. Animals which survived were discarded on the twentieth day or later.
Toxin was titrated using the toxin mixture A. in dilutions of 1 in 24, 1 in 22, 1 in 20 and 1
in 18 for intradermic injections of 0T c.cm. mixed with 0T c.cm. of saline containing -002 unit
of standard antitoxin. The total volume of the injections in the intradermic tests was in every
case o'2 c.cm.
The content of toxin in A was also checked by injecting 1 c.cm. of 1 in 20 of the mixture
equivalent to 0 -01 c.cm. of toxin if no deterioration had occurred, and occasionally in a dilution
of 1 in 16 -6 and 1 in 14 -3 to indicate the extent of any loss of activity.
The results of these experiments are set out in Tables 3. and 4. Judged by the
intradermal test no appreciable destruction of toxin occurred during eighteen days incubation.
The guinea-pigs injected with what should have been equivalent to the C.L.D. of toxin did not
all die, so that it is possible that a small loss of activity resulted from the growth of the
staphylococcus. On the eighteenth day 1 c.cm. of 1 in 20 of the bottle containing the
staphylococcus killed both animals into which it was injected on the third day.
Mr. Holden had been able to recover a trace of iodine (Appendix 19) in the washings
from the interior of the Bundaberg bottle. This amounted to 0.003 m.gms. in 0 -075 c.cm. of
mixture left in the bottle (estimated by weighing). This amount corresponded to 0-04 m.gms.
per c.cm. of mixture and had evidently been introduced into the bottle by successive punctures
through the rubber cap. We attempted to ascertain whether the presence of iodine had any
elfect. The staphylococcus inoculated into a bottle of A. containing iodine in half the
concentration observed by Mr. Holden grew satisfactorily and the intradermal tests indicated a
slight but definite decrease in the activity of the toxin.
The effects of the growth of the Bundaberg staphylococcus on antitoxin were somewhat
greater than those observed in the case of toxin. The intradermal tests indicated a decrease of
about one-third in antitoxic value after eighteen days.
The protection experiments confirmed this finding though they suggest that the decrease
is about 1/5 and that some falling off of antitoxic activity takes place in this dilution at 5°C.
even in the absence of bacterial contamination. 1.0 c.cm. of a dilution of linso of the original
mixture protected against the C.L.D. of toxin. After eighteen days at 5°C. 1 c.cm. of 1 in 40
was required. The bottle incubated seven days was unfortunately contaminated though it was
still clear and grew only a few colonies on plating. This control was, therefore, abandoned. Of
the material in which the Bundaberg organism was growing, 1 c.cm. of 1 in 40 was necessary
after eighteen days incubation, for protection against the C.L.D. of toxin.
It cannot be inferred from these experiments that the Bundaberg organism is capable of
destroying antitoxin preferentially in toxin-antitoxin mixtures. In our experiments {vide
Appendix 26) we have been unable to obtain any evidence that such is the case.

ON THE CULTIVATION OF STAPHYLOCOCCUS IN TOXIN-ANTITOXIN, ON THE
POSSIBILITY OF DISSOCIATION OF TOXIN BY THIS METHOD, AND ON THE
PATHOGENICITY OF STAPHYLOCOCCI GROWN IN THIS MEDIUM.
Toxin-antitoxin as prepared by the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories cannot compare
with plain broth as a culture medium for staphylococci. The particular batch (No. 86) with which
we are mainly concerned was made up to contain in 1 c.cm. 80 per cent, of an L + dose of toxin
and one unit of antitoxin. The L + dose of the toxin used was 0.325 c.cm. and the titre of the
antitoxin 1,360 units per c.cm. Therefore, each c.cm. of toxin-antitoxin should contain—
(l) .260 c.cm. of toxin (i.e. broth in which first colon bacilli, to render sugar free, and then
diphtheria bacilli have been grown), (2) .00073 c.cm. of antitoxin (i.e. horse serum globulins)
and (3) normal saline made up to 1 c.cm. Regarded as a nutrient medium it consists of one
quarter strength broth, in which already two types of bacteria have been cultivated, and a very
minute amount of serum globulin.
Immediately after the cultivation of the staphylococcus from the Bundaberg bottle
subcultures were made into other bottles and after varying periods at room temperatures or at
37° 0. animals were inoculated. From one bottle doses of 1.0 c.cm. given subcutaneously after
one, two three and nine days at room temperature produced no obvious effects in guinea pigs,
Oat it was noted that whilst the first three animals gained 104, 122 and 92 grams in weight in
twenty-two, twenty-six and twenty-five days respectively, the fourth animal, inoculated with
the nine days’ growth, only gained seven grams in a corresponding time.
From another inoculated bottle kept at room temperature, subcutaneous injections of
1.0 c.cm. were given with the following results ;
The first five animals inoculated on the first four days gained on the average 105 grams in
weight in 24 days, whilst the animal inoculated on the sixth day which early showed a firm
indurated area in the abdominal wall only gained 19 grams in 24 days, and the animal injected
on the ninth day showed no gain in weight after 21 days.
Another series of animals were inoculated subcutaneously with doses from a bottle of
Batch 78a (toxin-antitoxin) infected directly from the original Bundaberg bottle and incubated
for 24 hours at 37° C. 1.0 c.cm. injected into a guinea pig produced a small local abscess healing
to a clean scar by the tenth day and the animal gained only 27 grams in nineteen days. 0.5 c.cm.
also produced late ulceration but the animal gained 67 grams in nineteen days. 0.2 and 0.1
c.cm. produced no obvious lesions and the animals gained 63 and 60 grams respectively in nineteen
days. A rabbit showed only a slight local lesion after a subcutaneous inoculation of 0.5 c.cm.
and gained well in weight. Four mice received an intraperitoneal inoculation of 0.2 c.cm.
They appeared to be very sick after five hours with neurotoxic symptoms but seemed 'well on the
following day. One died after six days with multiple abscesses in both kidneys.
Another bottle of Batch 78a inoculated direct from the fatal bottle was kept at room
temperature. Of two mice inoculated intraperitoneally after 24 hours with 0.1 c.cm. one was
moribund in four hours and the other survived. After 48 hours four mice received the same
dose and one only died in four days.
Eleven guinea pigs also were inoculated from two bottles of Batch 78a infected directly
from the fatal bottle. Doses ranging from 1.0 to 0.1 c.cm. and injected subcutaneously after
varying periods up to four days produced no deaths and scarcely any local effects. The four
days’ growth, however, produced some necrosis of the skin.
The results of these early animal experiments suggested to us that a more detailed study
should be undertaken in which animals would be inoculated daily with the same dose, and at
the same time the number of cocci enumerated.

Moderately extensive infiltration (d —h) becoming firmer and band like after three days, then settling
down to form two lumps, one rather deep below costal margin, the other superficial in the lower abdominal

by a thin band of tissue. No lesions noted in other organs. Weight fell from 210 to 193 grams in two
days
Another animal was inoculated with 0,5 c.cm. plus 6 units antitoxin. It also developed a definite
infiltration (-] —h)
Graph 1 shows the counts obtained at intervals in a 10 c.cm. rubber-capped bottle of
toxin-antitoxin (Batch 86) marked M.S.C. 4 and also the local effects of subcutaneous inoculation
in the abdominal wall of guinea pigs.
The rubber cap was sterilized by filling the cup-like depression in it with methylated
spirit, most of which after two minutes was gently shaken out and the remainder flamed. With
a sterile 1 c.cm. tuberculin syringe 0.1 c.cm. of a very dilute saline emulsion of the staphylococcus
was injected through the rubber cap and the bottle inverted several times to mix evenly. The
same amount was well mixed with melted agar and the latter plated. Counts made after two days
at 37° C. show that the inoculum was approximately 550 organisms per c.cm. of toxin-antitoxin.
This bottle was incubated at 80° F. (26.6° C.) and from the second to the fourteenth day,
excepting the tenth and eleventh days, the bottle was taken out on to the bench for several
hours, the contents gently agitated, and 0.6 c.cm. withdrawn with a syringe. 0.1 c.cm. was
mixed with agar and plated or known dilutions of it were made and plated. At the same time
the remaining 0.5 c.cm. was inoculated subcutaneously into a guinea pig. As may be seen
from the graph, animals were inoculated after two days and every subsequent day to the fifteenth
day inclusive. It is admitted that the withdrawal of the dose for counting by a syringe though
graduated in hundredths of a c.cm. is not a! very accurate method but it was convenient and
suited to the double purpose of this research.
The counting of the plates was done after 48 hours and by a different member of the
Commission. The highest figure observed, 363 million per c.cm., was reached on the ninth day,
though possibly if counts had been done on the eleventh or twelfth days they might have been
higher. The fall in the count between the third and fourth days was also noted in another bottle,
whilst in a third bottle it was not noted. Otherwise the tendency is towards a steady rise reaching
a plateau about the seventh, eighth or ninth day. In the third bottle above mentioned the
increase from the first dayfto the sixth day is roughly in arithmetical progression.
The guinea pig inoculations showed curious results. In Graph lit will be seen that 0.5
c.cm. produces marked local infiltrations at two periods, on the sixth day and on the fourteenth
and fifteenth days. The admixture of six units of antitoxin did not prevent the reaction on
the fifteenth day. There is no obvious correlation with the number of living organisms. The
effects of inoculation from this bottle are summarized here :

■ Weight fell from 287 grams to 266 grams in five days, then rose to 307 grams by eighth day. The
animal was killed by ether on the thirteenth day. The lump proved to be a small well enclosed abscess
containing whitish rather thick pus. Adrenals normal looking. No other lesions found. A film of the pus
showed numerous gram positive cocci and pus cells and much phagocytosis, A staphylococcus was
cultivated
8
No infiltration, but a very small lump noted on fourth day. It could not be felt on fifth day. Weight
fell from 275 to 255 grams in four days, then rose to 289 grams by the eighth day
9
An extensive soft subcutaneous infiltration (fl —h+) and some redness of skin within 24 hours. On third
day it was firmer. On fourth day it was incised and bled freely (haemorrhagic exudate) but no pus
was found. Cultures from the incised tissue gave several colonies only of a staphylococcus. The wound
began to heal although the swelling remained. On the tenth day it had resolved into two firm raised
lumps
The animal was killed by ether and dissection showed a superficial abscess in the mid abdominal
wall and a deeper abscess higher up affecting the muscle. The inflammation had caused adhesion of
the anterior surface of fiver to the abdominal wall and there were several superficial miliary abscesses
in the liver. Staphylococci were cultivated from the abscesses, but the heart’s blood was sterile. There
was no lesion of the adrenals. The weight had fallen from 294 to 243 grams in four days, was only 249
grams after seven days and 262 grams after ten days.
10
Slight infiltration (+) settling down to a small lump in three days. This lump was still palpable after
ten days, but had disappeared by sixteenth day. The weight increased from 277 grams to 297 grams
in four days, and to 314 grams in six days.
11
Slight infiltration after 24 hours but extensive (fl —1-+) on second day. A deep incision caused free bleeding
but no pus was found. The wound healed well but the swelling remained and settled down to a raised
lump free from surrounding infiltration by the eleventh day. It then showed fluctuation and settled
down partly by discharge and partly by absorption. The weight fell markedly from 261 to 177 grams
in four days, was only 181 grams on fifth day, and 197 grams on eleventh day
12
This animal was given the remaining contents of the bottle, viz., 1.4 c.cm. In 24 hours its abdomen showed
an extensive oedematous swelling which oozed serum from the needle hole. On the second day it was
much the same, and on the third day the animal looked very ill. It was killed by ether. Dissection
showed oedematous subcutaneous tissue and necrotic muscle. The subjacent anterior surface of fiver
showed some greyish exudate. The organs were somewhat wet. Adrenals not haemorrhagic, but
slightly congested. Staphylococci were cultivated from the heart’s blood and from the necrotic tissues.
The weight had fallen from 272 to 248 grams in two days and was 245 grams after three days.
Looking through the weights of animals inoculated with this and other bottles, the main
facts elicited are that inoculations after two, three and four days incubation at Bundaberg
temperatures as a rule do not cause loss of weight, inoculations after longer incubations may or
may not cause loss of weight, but when the infiltration is severe the loss of weight is usually
prompt and definite. Recovery and gain of weight occur after a variable period. The
injections from this bottle did not cause death in doses of 0.5 c.cm.
Another rubber-capped bottle inoculated with the Bundaberg staphylococcus gave a
somewhat similar sequence of effects. This bottle was kept at room temperature in hot weather,
the maximum bench temperature during the eleven days being 93° F. the minimum 65°, whilst
the average bench maximum and minimum for the period were 82° and 72° respectively, therefore
not far removed from the Bundaberg temperatures (See Appendix 7). The inoculum, counted
by plating, amounted to 140 cocci per c.cm. of toxin-antitoxin. The results of subcutaneous
inoculations of 0.5 c.cm. are tabulated :
Sections of the tissues involved in the local lesion of this last guinea pig showed oedema
and haemorrhage in the subcutaneous tissue, degeneration of striped muscle, and infiltration of
tissues with Gram-positive cocci and leucocytes. Sections of the adrenals showed no
abnormality.
In this series the results indicate an initial innocuous period of four or five days duration,
next a short period in which there is a severe local effect, then a period of lessened effect and
finally a second active period (possibly more permanent) in which severe local effects are obtained.
This bottle gave the highest counts of cocci which have been observed in toxin antitoxin of Batch

No infiltration Weight was 197 on day of inoculation and only 206 grams six days later
86. It was the first bottle to be investigated in this manner. Counts of over 2,000 millions
per c.cm. were reached though 400 million was the maximum observed in three other bottles.
Possibly the organism in our later experiments had lost some of its ability to grow in toxin-antitoxin.
Whether this could be regained by passage through successive bottles of toxin-antitoxin mixture
has not been investigated.
Another bottle of Batch 86 inoculated with approximately 700 cocci per c.cm. and incubated
at 80° F. showed a steady uninterrupted increase in the numbers of living cocci from the second
to the sixth day. The results of plating and the effects of subcutaneous inoculations of guinea-
pigs with 0 -5 c.cm. are here detailed :
The remaining contents of this bottle were centrifuged. The organisms deposited from
1 c.cm. were emulsified in saline and inoculated subcutaneously. No local lesion resulted.
Another guinea-pig was inoculated with the organisms from 0 -5 c.cm. emulsified in saline and
mixed with 0-5 c.cm. of the super-natant fluid. On the following day there was definite
infiltration which persisted for three days and then settled down to a well-defined lump.
In the series above described, no definite infiltration was produced until the seventh,
eighth and ninth days, and the local lesions were not as severe as in the two preceding series.
The centrifuged organisms emulsified in saline did not produce infiltration.
Another series was carried through with the. inoculated bottle in an incubator set at 37° C.
The inoculum was approximately 1,000 cocci as determined by plating. There was slight turbidity
within eighteen hours. The results were as follows :

The counts obtained in this series at 37° C. were surprisingly low and irregularly variable
from day to day, the maximum count being 129 millions per c.cm. Infiltrations were obtained
with the toxin-antitoxin after 22 hours incubation and lesser reactions after two and five days,
but not after three, four, seven, eight and nine days.
To another bottle was added half the percentage amount of iodine present in the remains
of Dr. Thomson’s bottle (Appendix 19) (the concentration found was probably a maximum reached
gradually during the series of inoculations at Bundaberg). The actual amount of iodine added
to the 10 c.cm. ! bottle was o*s c.cm. of a solution containing 0-4 m.gm. per c.cm. The maximal
count obtained|in this bottle, incubated at 80° P. was 200 millions per c.cm., so that there
was no vidence of any inhibitory effect on growth with this concentration of iodine.
Guinea-pigs were inoculated every day from the third to the fourteenth day, excepting the fifth,
eighth and twelfth days. No infiltrations resulted, but the inoculations on the seventh day
produced a late and very small ill-defined superficial lump, and that on the tenth day produced
a somewhat larger lump, first noted on second day and persisting tlntil on the eighth day it was
found discharging a little.
It is unfortunate that inoculations were not done on the sixth and eighth days,
and considering this omission we are not justified in assuming that the presence of this amount
of iodine inhibits the production of the local lesions in guinea-pigs.
Other investigations were carried out on the growth of the Bundaberg staphylococcus
in an antitoxin dilution of the same strength as in toxin-antitoxin mixture, the toxin being replaced
by nutrient broth diluted one in five (Appendix 25). Counts were made at intervals and the
figures obtained were higher than in most bottles of toxin-antitoxin. The results were as follows: —
A few guinea-pigs were inoculated from this bottle and two others of the same preparation,
but unfortunately inoculations were not carried out during the first eight days. No reactions
were obtained on the ninth and tenth days ; on the eleventh day one bottle gave a definite
infiltration (-(- +) and the other two did not, and on the twelfth day the former did not, whilst
one of the others produced a definite infiltration (+)• On the thirteenth day neither of these
produced any reaction.
Similarly a dilution of diphtheria toxin was made up of the same strength as in toxin-
antitoxin, antitoxin being replaced by lin 1,350 horse serum. The same inoculum was introduced
as was used above for the antitoxin and a few counts were made. The figures obtained were :
Obviously it was not possible to investigate staphylococcal reactions in animals without
first destroying the diphtheria toxin, and there seemed to be no useful purpose to be pursued along
these fines. The figures are given here for comparison with growth in antitoxin (Appendix 25).
It may be contended that the variations in the reactions of individual guinea-pigs described
above are only the expression of variation of susceptibility in the animals themselves. We did
not have sufficient animal accommodation at our disposal to enable us to inoculate several animals
each day from each bottle of toxin-antitoxin mixture, as we were using many guinea-pigsAlaily
for the titration of diphtheria toxin and antitoxin. We have been able to show, however,’that
while individual variations in the susceptibility of guinea-pigs do occur they are insufficient to
account for our results.

We now attempted to ascertain whether when the staphylococcus was grown in riche*
media in the absence of toxin and antitoxin the same phenomena could be produced. For thi
purpose we used tubes containing 10 c.cm. of broth inoculated with 1 loopful of standard emulsion
(approximately 1,000 millions per c.cm.). After growth for various times at Bundaberg temperature
the broth was well shaken up and most of it filtered through Seitz filters, using discs through
which bacteria could not penetrate. The filtrate and the unfiltered material were injected
subcutaneously into different guinea-pigs.
In no case between the twelfth hour and the eighth day did filtrate from any of the cultures
in doses of 2 c.cm. cause any lesion, though after 30 and 40 hours growth the injection caused
some slight loss of weight.
The unfiltered cultures in a dose of 0 -5 c.cm. produced the following results :
As the filtrates were in all cases inocuous even in large doses, we next studied the effect
of adding increasing numbers of organisms to filtrates and to sterile broth which were injected
subcutaneously, 0-5 c.cm. of standard emulsion, equivalent to 500 million organisms, with
0 -5 c.cm. and 2 -0 c.cm. of unfiltered sterile broth gave infiltrations in all respects similar to those
recorded with unfiltered broth cultures. 0-1 c.cm. of broth plus 0-5 c.cm. of standard emulsion
gave only a trace of infiltration and similar but less’marked reactions were produced with 0-6
c.cm. standard emulsion and 0-5 c.cm. of filtrate from 24 hours’ broth culture. Standard emulsiou
alone in doses from 0-5 to 10 c.cm. never produces any trace of infiltration.
We next attempted to reproduce the phenomenon by emulsifying the organisms off an
agar slope eighteen hours old, in 3 c.cm. toxin antitoxin mixture. This emulsion was estimated
to contain very approximately 16,000 million staphylococci per c.cm. A series of dilutions
were made of this emulsion using toxin antitoxin mixture as a diluent and 0 -5 c.cm. of each
was injected into pairs of guinea pigs of about 200 gm. weight. The following results were
obtained, the degree of infiltration being indicated as heretofore :


While our plate counts in the experiments with toxin-antitoxin mixture inoculated with
staphylococci indicate that the number of living organisms is not the explanation of the
phenomenon we have described, it may well be that the total number of living and dead organisms
is the determining factor in the production of infiltration.
Is Toxin Liberated from Toxin Antitoxin Mixture by the Staphylococcus ? —lt might be
thought that the lesions we have described in guinea pigs were due to diphtheria toxin liberated
from toxin-antitoxin mixture by the activity of the staphylococcus. It is quite certain that this
is not the case since broth cultures of the staphylococcus, and cultures in antitoxin alone, produce
similar lesions. Further, the infiltrations produced by subcutaneous injection cannot be prevented
by the simultaneous administration of large doses of antitoxin. Toxin-antitoxin mixture in
which staphylococci have been grown has at no time produced intradermal skin reactions in
guinea pigs when injected, in doses of 0•2 c.cm. No late paralyses have followed in any of the
guinea pigs injected subcutaneously with doses of 0 -5 to 1 -0 c.cm., and finally the microscopic
examination of the infiltrations has shown them to resemble cellulitis of staphylococcal origin.
The large series of experiments which we have made with staphylococci growing in toxin-antitoxin
mixture under various temperature conditions and the experiments described in Appendix 21
with B. proteus definitely exclude the possibility that toxin can be liberated by the action of
proteolytic organisms and in particular by the Bundaberg staphylococcus.
Experiments ivith Monkeys —Vie did some further experiments with monkeys, which we
hoped would prove to be more susceptible to the Bundaberg organism than other laboratory
animals. Unfortunately this was not the case, but the general results obtained by the
subcutaneous injection of toxin-antitoxin mixture injected with the staphylococcus and incubated
at 73° to 85° F. for varying periods, were on the whole confirmatory of our observations on
guinea pigs. Our first experiments were carried out on the same three monkeys which had been
already used for testing the contents of Dr. Thomson’s bottle. They had then shown no ill
effects. One of these animals on each day received a dose of 1.0 c.cm. from each of two bottles
infected with the staphylococcus, in the right thigh from one, and in the left from the other
bottle.
Monkey 2, who received his inoculations on the third day of incubation, remained perfectly
well, showed no rise of temperature and developed no local lesion at the site of inoculation.
Monkey 1, who received his inoculations on the fourth day, had slight pyrexia on the first
and second days after inoculation. His general condition was poor for several days and within
24 hours of the injection there was a firm swelling in the left groin which appeared to consist
of swollen glands ; by the fourth day a definite abscess appeared to be forming. By the second
day a slight firmness was apparent in the adductors and hamstrings in the right thigh. This
gradually developed and formed a very large abscess which with that on the left side was opened
on the tenth day and a quantity of pus was evacuated.
Monkey 3, who received his inoculations on the fifth day of incubation did not show any
pyrexia following his injections but was definitely sick for two or three days. On the third day
a painful lump appeared in the right groin. This had cleared up by the sixth day when an
area of hard infiltration was observed for tKe first time in the adductor muscles of the right thigh.
By the ninth day this had cleared up and the monkey remained perfectly well.
Further experiments were made on much younger animals which had not had any
previous injection.
Monkey 5, weighing 2 T kilos, received in the right thigh a subcutaneous injection of 0 •5
c.cm. of toxin-antitoxin mixture infected with staphylococci and incubated 55 hours, and in the
left thigh a similar dose of material, incubated 31 hours. The animal’s temperature was slightly
elevated (39 -6° C.) on the first day, though there were no marked general symptoms. On the
second day there was a small hard lump on the left side at the site of the injection, but this
disappeared by the fifth day. On the right side there was no definite lesion except some firmness
in the adductor region on the second day.
Monkey 6, weighing 2 -27 kilos, received in the right thigh a subcutaneous injection of
0-5 c.cm. of toxin-antitoxin infected with the staphylococcus and incubated for three days at
room temperature. In the left thigh a similar dose of material incubated for two days was given.
There was no definite general reaction, but a firm infiltration of the adductor muscles on the right
side appeared on the first day and persisted to the twelfth day. On the left side a small
subcutaneous lump developed and persisted to the fifth day.
Monkey 7, weighing 2 -35 kilos, received in the right thigh a subcutaneous injection of
0 -5 c.cm. of similar infected material incubated four days, and in the left thigh material incubated
for three days. On both sides a firm subcutaneous lump appeared associated with some induration
of the adductor muscles. These lesions had disappeared by the ninth day.


Monkey 8, weighing 3-11 kilos, received similar doses of material incubated four and five
days respectively. No local lesions resulted and there were no general symptoms.
Monkey 9, weighing 1 -42 kilos, was inoculated subcutaneously in each thigh with 0 -5
c.cm. of toxin-antitoxin mixture infected with the Bundaberg staphylococcus, incubated for four
days at room temperature and not disturbed in any way till one hour before it was used. (An
attempt was thus made to imitate the conditions in Dr. Thomson’s bottle). The general reaction
following these injections was very slight and the local lesions were definite but transitory.
Twenty-five minutes after the subcutaneous inoculations approximately 4-0 c.cm. of
blood was withdrawn from the heart with a syringe and the blood distributed in graded quantities
both into broth tubes and into melted agar, the latter being poured into petri dishes. No
staphylococci were cultivated from any of these fractions of the 4-0 c.cm. of blood. In a
previous experiment with another monkey no staphylococci were cultivated from approximately
3 -0 c.cm. of heart blood 1| hours after a subcutaneous inoculation.
Twelve days after the inoculation this monkey went off his food and became quiet and
listless. On the fourteenth day it weighed only 1 kilo. It had some diarrhoea, refused food and
was moribund on the sixteenth day. After death by chloroform an autopsy was performed.
There were no abscesses in the thighs or in the internal organs. The heart blood was sterile.
The liver showed numerous greyish white flecks, of irregular size, under the cupoula but on
incision no pus was found and cultures from them remained sterile. Microscopical examinations
of sections showed a heavy coccidial inlection. The spleen and kidneys showed no lesion. The
mucous membrane of the colon was slightly swollen and of a light pink colour but without
macroscopic ulceration. The mesenteric lymph glands were markedly swollen and firm and
only colon bacilli were cultivated from them.
These experiments, though carried out upon relatively insusceptible animals, suggest
that at temperatures approximating to those at Bundaberg, there is an optimum time for
the development of pathogenicity of toxin-antitoxin mixture infected with the staphylococcus.
Generalization of staphylococcal infection cannot be produced by the subcutaneous route
in maeacus rhesus.

APPENDIX 27.
ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF TURBIDITY IN TOXIN-ANTITOXIN MIXTURE IN
RELATION TO THE NUMBER OF STAPHYLOCOCCI PRESENT IN
DR. THOMSON’S BOTTLE ON 27TH JANUARY, 1928.
The Bundaberg staphylococcus forms a “ smooth ” growth both in broth and in toxin-
antitoxin. A slight deposit appeared at the bottom of the amber coloured rubber-capped
bottles in which the toxin-antitoxin was kept during the experiments recorded in Appendix 26,
but the haziness or turbidity in the supernatant liquid was usually free from visible particles.
To detect very slight haziness it is necessary to examine the amber bottles side by side with a
sterile bottle. Dr. Thomson stated in evidence before us that on 28th of January (the day after
the inoculations) he noted that the contents of the bottle were turbid though on the afternoon
of the 27th of January (when he made the inoculations) it had been clear. He had in his
possession only one bottle of toxin-antitoxin and, therefore, had no standard of comparison.
From a considerable experience of turbidity in these bottles and from the very strong probability
that the contamination took place not later than the 24th January, we consider that some
degree of turbidity was present on the 27th January. The time in which turbidity appears
depends on the number of cocci injected through the rubber cap into the bottle, upon the
temperature of incubation and possibly upon other factors which we have not elucidated. We
endeavoured to obtain a uniform inoculum using a known dilution of a saline emulsion made with
a platinum loop from an 18 to 24 hours growth on agar. The number of living organisms was
controlled by plating.
At temperatures between 75° and 85° F. (24° to 29° C.) slight turbidity is visible in
from 32 to 48 hours with a very small inoculum, e.g., in two experiments in which agar plate
counts showed the number inoculated to be 500 and 700 cocci respectively per c.cm. of toxin-
antitoxin. At 37° C. the turbidity appears more rapidly, e.g., in one experiment an inoculum
of 1,000 cocci per c.cm. determined by plate culture produced slight turbidity within eighteen
hours. The turbidity increases but never becomes as great as in nutrient broth, nor did we in
an experiment in which the bottle was incubated at 37° C. find any greater turbidity. There is
a definite lag in growth under the conditions of these experiments. For example, in an
experiment at room temperature (75° to 85° Fah.) with an inoculum of approximately 140
cocci, plate counts after four hours gave 100 cocci per c.cm., after eight hours 450, after 28
hours approximately 3,000,000, and after 46 hours 29,000,000. In another experiment at 80°
F. an inoculum of 730 cocci per c.cm. had increased to 4,500,000 in 21 hours.
Even allowing that Dr. Thomson’s observations were correct, viz., that the bottle was
clear on 27th January, and turbid on 28th January, our experiments indicate that the number
of cocci present on 27th January, would have been, on an extremely conservative estimate,
not less than 1,000,000 per c.cm. For example, in the experiment with a very small inoculum
only 100 cocci per c.cm. were found after four hours, but after 46 hours when very slight
turbidity was noted the number of cocci was 29,000,000 per c.cm. On the day before turbidity
was noted, the count showed 3,000,000. Again, in the experiment with a larger inoculum,
enumerated as 730 cocci per c.cm., the count on the day on which turbidity was first noted (but
not less than six hours after it appeared) was 92,000,000, and on the day before the count showed
4,500,000 per c.cm. Further, in another experiment where the count was made in the afternoon
of the day on which turbidity was first noted, the number was found on this day to be 116,000,000
but it was not counted on the day before. These experiments were either at room temperature
(82° to 72° F.) or in an incubator set at 80° F.
But if, as we hold, the contamination of the bottle took place not later than the day on
which it had been previously used, i.e., not later than 24th January, then from our experiments
it would have been slightly turbid on 26th January, the turbidity depending on the factors
enumerated, and probably more turbid on 27th January. Our counts after three days, using
small but variable inocula, are in the same three experiments respectively 264, 130 and 265
millions per c.cm.
To obtain these small numbers of cocci we took a fresh saline emulsion which from its
opacity we judged would work out somewhere in the neighbourhood of 1,000 million per c.cm.
o'l c.cm. was added to 9 - 9 c.cm. of saline and well mixed, and of this o'l c.cm. was added to
a further 9'9 c.cm. of saline. Either 0 - 1 c.cm. of this dilution was used as the inoculum or O' 1
c.cm. of a further tenfold dilution. If, as in one experiment, 1,400 colonies were obtained by
plating o'l c.cm. of the latter, then the inoculum per c.cm. of toxin-antitoxin in the 10 c.cm.
bottle was 140 cocci, and the strength of the original emulsion approximately 1,400,000,000
per c.cm. Now we do not know how many cocci were admitted to Dr. Thomson’s bottle and it
would be unjust to presume that it was above the minimum that would succeed in multiplying


sufficiently to cause turbidity. The possibly longer lag in this case and the small initial number
of organisms might well have ensured smaller numbers, if counts had been made, than we have
obtained. Our smallest estimate after three days at the specified temperatures was 130,000,000
per c.cm. Dividing this by three, as we have done in the consideration of our first hypothesis
(on which we presumed Dr. Thomson to have been correct in his observations as to turbidity),
we find on this second hypothesis (on which we presume that the bottle was contaminated on
24th January) that the bottle would have contained not less than 40,000,000 per c.cm. on 27th
January. This again is an extremely conservative estimate.
If Dr. Thomson had contaminated the bottle only during the final inoculations on 27th
January, then with a very small inoculum it would not have become turbid on 28th January,
when he noted it, unless the inoculum had been a heavy one, a contingency which we consider
extremely unlikely. (See Appendix 3.) Contamination on the 27th., moreover, would not
explain the abscess formation in the arms of all the children who survived.
A further observation was made on the turbidity of toxin-antitoxin in amber bottles.
An addition of Bundaberg staphylococci to toxin-antitoxin so that it contained not less than
8,000,000 per c.cm. could not be detected by two of us. A concentration of not less than 12,000,000
could just be detected by two of us by careful observation and comparison with a
control bottle in a suitable light. A concentration of not less than 20,000,000 could be detected
by a third trained observer without previous practice with these bottles. But even a concentra-
tion up to 80,000,000 per c.cm. does not cause gross turbidity and might easily be missed if the
contents were not closely observed.

APPENDIX 28.
INVESTIGATION OF CONTENT OF DIPHTHERIA ANTITOXIN IN THE SERA OF
THE SURVIVORS OF THE INJECTION OF TOXIN-ANTITOXIN MIXTURE ON
27TH JANUARY AT BUNDABERG.
For this purpose two methods were used —(1) the protection of guinea pigs of approximately
250 grams weight against the subcutaneous injection of the certainly lethal dose (C.L.D.) of a
sample of diphtheria toxin by its mixture with varying doses of the sera to be tested and, (2) the
intradermal method first described by Homer and his colleagues (1909).
The toxin used, pooled 21a and 21n of the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, was similar
to that used in the manufacture of Batch 86. 21a was planted on 12th October, 1926, with the
C.S.L. strain of Park 8 and 21 d with R.G.W. from the Lister Institute. 21 a was collected 20th
October, 1926, and 21d on the following day. They were later pooled. This toxin, approximately
seventeen months old, was used in all our experiments. It had an L+ dose of -225 c.cm. when
tested at the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories on 13th December, 1927, but when tested by
us in March, the L-f- dose was found to be approximately *230 c.cm. We did not accurately
determine its M.L.D., but this evidently was not far removed from its C.L.D. The L+ dose for
this toxin probably does not contain more than 30 M.L.Ds.
For the use of the first method we determined the C.L.D. of the toxin used. This, as
will be seen from Table 1, was 0 -01 c.cm.
We next determined the amount of standard antitoxin necessary to ensure survival when
injected subcutaneously together with 0 -01 c.cm. of toxin. In all cases the mixtures were allowed
to stand at room temperature for one hoiir before injection. Table 2 shows the protective effect
of varying doses of standard antitoxin. The standard antitoxin used throughout was prepared
by the United States Public Health Service, Hygienic Laboratory, Washington.
The dose of antitoxin necessary to ensure survival was 1/60 unit antitoxin, while that
which gave complete protection (freedom from infiltration and loss of weight) was 1/25 unit.
We were now able from the protective effect of varying doses of the sera to deduce the
amount of antitoxin present in them.

For the intradermal method we used the technique described by Glenny and Allen (1921),
taking as a standard the reaction produced by the injection of that amount of toxin (Ln/500)
which together with 1/500 unit of standard antitoxin just suffices to produce necrosis. The
sera were put up each in a series of dilutions mixed with this dose of toxin and the total volume
injected was in each case 0-2 c.cm. Mixtures were allowed to stand one hour before injection.
Albino guinea pigs were used. The flanks were shaved and four intradermal injections were
made on each side, without anaesthesia. In every animal a standardizing injection of the Ln/500
of toxin mixed with 1/500 standard antitoxin was made, and proved of value as there was some
individual variation in the sensitiveness of different animals.
Determination of the Ln/500 Dose. —Several experiments were made, the range of doses
used being as follows: —0004, -0005, -0006, -0007, -0008, -0009, -001, -0012, -0014, -0016,
•0018, and ’OO2 c.cm. of toxin. The smallest dose which with -002 c.cm. standard antitoxin
produced definite necrosis in different animals was either -0008 or -0009 c.cm. We, therefore,
selected the latter as the Ln/500 dose.
As a test of our ability to obtain satisfactory results by these methods, we examined the
sera of a number of children in Melbourne who had previously been Schick tested, and some
who had later been partially immunized and retested. The results obtained are shown in
Table 3, and the details of the protection tests are shown in Table 4.

It will be noted that in two of the three sera of children in the first group who had no
symptoms there was a particularly high content of antitoxin. The fourth child, C.W., who
had no symptoms and from whom we failed to obtain blood had had diphtheria thirteen months
before. Her sister, N.W., who had the highest observed titre of antitoxin was also said by her
parents to have had diphtheria. These high titres of antitoxin were observed too soon after
the last injection to have resulted from active immunization in Schick positive individuals. The
children probably had a high titre of antitoxin before 27th January, the injection acting as a
secondary stimulus. It may be argued that protection against diphtheria toxin was the cause
of their freedom from symptoms. The absence of symptoms in V.T.C. cannot be explained in
this way.
With regard to the children in the second and third groups, it is not possible to infer from
the antitoxin content of their sera on 15th February whether they weie Schick positive or Schick
negative before 27th January. In the second group the effect of the intramuscular injections of
4,000 units of antitoxin given while in hospital is still evident in the results of these titrations,
and it is possible that had they not had antitoxin the content of their sera in antitoxin would
have been similar to that of those in the third group.
On the whole, these results are unfavorable to the view that free diphtheria toxin played
any active role in causing the Bundaberg deaths.


APPENDIX 29.
THE EFFECT OF THE SUBCUTANEOUS INJECTION OF DIPHTHERIA TOXIN
TOGETHER WITH THE BUNDABERG STAPHYLOCOCCUS.
Although we have been unable to dissociate toxin from toxin-antitoxin mixture by growing
organisms in it, we thought it advisable to make a few experiments to ascertain whether the
resistance of animals could be so reduced by diphtheria toxin rhat rapid death would result from
the injection of the Bundaberg organism. We have used only subcutaneous injections of both
toxin and staphylococci in mice, guinea pigs and rabbits, injecting both in the same region. The
staphylococci have been injected in saline emulsion made from eighteen to 24 hours old agar
slope cultures and estimated by opacity.
In mice we did not determine the C.L.D. of the toxin, but injected in a dose of 0.1 c.cm.
it failed to cause any symptoms. Injection of 100 million staphylococci was also without effect
both alone and together with 0.1 c.cm. of diphtheria toxin.
In guinea pigs the C.L.D. of the toxin was 0.01 c.cm. (Appendix 28) for animals of
250 grams weight. The injection of 1,000 million staphylococci produces only a local lesion
(Appendix 23). In four animals 1,000 million organisms were injected together with 0.002
c.cm. of diphtheria toxin and all survived. Of four animals injected with the same dose of
staphylococci and 0.005 c.cm. of toxin, one died on the fourth day and the remainder and the
control guinea pigs, which received ordy 0.005 c.cm. of toxin, survived.
The injection ot 200 million staphylococci does not appear to shorten appreciably the time
of death after administration of the C.L.D. of toxin. The average death time in ten animals
which received 0.01 c.cm. of toxin was 55 hours, and in four guinea pigs which received in
addition this dose of staphylococci the average was 52 hours.
In rabbits of about 1 kilo, the C.L.D. was not accurately determined but was probably
between 0.005 c.cm. and 0.01 c.cm. 0.1 c.cm. killed in 27 hours, 0.05 in 41 hours, 0.025 in 50
hours and 0.01 in 86 hours, while with 0.005 c.cm. two of three animals died on the fourth and
seventh days. Rabbets injected with 0.0025 c.cm. of toxin with and without 1,000 million
staphylococci survived, and two rabbits which received 0.005 c.cm. of toxin and the same dose
of staphylococci survived beyond the tenth day.
These experiments show clearly that even large doses of diphtheria toxin do not enable
the staphylococcus to kill rapidly, when administered by the subcutaneous route in the doses
which we have used. It cannot be inferred with certainty from these negative results that
an effect of this kind cannot be produced in man, but our evidence makes it unlikely, and
experience of staphylococcal infection complicating clinical diphtheria is also unfavorable to this
possibility.


APPENDIX 30.
ON GENERALIZED STAPHYLOCOCCAL INFECTION.
By the kind permission of Dr. Cecil Purser, Chairman of the Board of Directors, Dr. A. H.
Tebbutt has examined for us the records of the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney, in order
to obtain some insight into the incidence of the mortality and clinical features of generalized
staphylococcal infections. The group studied is classified under the heading “ Septicaemia and
Pyaemia (non-puerpural).” Prom the year 1910 to 1928 80 cases have been so classified, but
one was definitely a case of sapraemia, and another a readmission, leaving 78 cases ; 54 of these
have been recorded as septicaemia, and 24 as septico-pyaemia. It must be remembered that the
distinction is not always clear, and in many cases the diagnosis has been made on clinical grounds
only. It should be emphasized that many conditions other than puerperal (e.g., sub-acute
bacterial endocarditis) in which cultures of pathogenic organisms can be obtained from the blood
during life, are not included in this group. In only one of the cases studied were there vegetations
on the valves of the heart.
Of the 54 cases of septicaemia, 45 died and nine recovered giving a mortality rate of
83 -3 per cent. Of the 24 cases of septico-pyaemia fourteen died and ten recovered, giving a
mortality of 58-3 per cent. The mortality for the whole series was 75 -6 per cent.
In 27 cases cultures were made from the blood during life. In eleven staphylococcus
aureus, in six streptococci, in one a pneumococcus, in one a colon bacillus and in eight cases no
organisms were cultivated. In two cases the pathologist recovered staphylococci (aureus and
albus respectively) which were regarded by him as contaminations. These have not been
included as positive cases. Cultures obtained during life from various lesions yielded confirmatory
evidence in many cases.
Autopsies were carried out only on 39 cases. Where cultures were made they have
supported the diagnosis by blood culture during life, and the same organisms have been obtained
from the heart’s blood, the splenic pulp, septic infarcts in the lung or miliary abscesses in the
kidney.
In a few cases in which blood cultures were not made during life, cultures obtained at
autopsy were available for the diagnosis of the infecting organisms. These are as follows :
Streptococcus, three cases,
Staphylococcus aureus, six cases,
Staphylococcus albus, one case,
Pneumococcus, three cases,
Colon bacillus, two cases.
Adding these to those in which the organism was obtained by blood culture, we find that
the infecting organism has been determined in 34 cases as follows ;
Staphylococcus aureus, .. .. 17 cases ..1
Staphylococcus albus .. .. . . 1 case .. j
+52 -94 per cent.
Streptococcus .. .. .. 9 cases .. 26 -47 per cent.
Pneumococcus . . . . . . 4 cases . . 11-76 per cent.
Colon bacillus .. .. .. 3 cases .. 8-83 per cent.
These figures indicate the frequency of occurrence of staphylococci in this somewhat
restricted group of general infections.
The mortality rate in the eleven cases in which staphylococcus aureus was obtained by
blood culture during life was 100 per cent., whilst that in the remaining eight cases in which
other organisms were recovered was 50 per cent, and in the eight cases in which the blood culture
proved sterile 62 -5 per cent.
A careful study of the cases in this series indicates the gravity of generalized infection
by staphylococcus aureus and engenders a very marked respect for it as an infective agent. It
is regrettable that from the point of view of accurate diagnosis and prognosis that blood cultures
are not more frequently and promptly carried out in severe infective conditions,

The principal features of this series of eighteen generalized staphylococcal infections are
briefly considered
1. Age .. .. Seven out of eighteen patients were under the age of twenty
The cases are distributed in decades as follows :
Ist Decade—2, aged 14 months and 3 years.
2nd Decade-—5, aged 13, 14, 14, 14 and 17 years.
3rd Decade—2, aged 20 and 25 years.
4th Decade—s, aged 33, 33, 37, 37 and 39 years,
oth Decade—3, aged 42, 47 and 48 years.
6th Decade —1, aged 55 years.
2. Sex .. . . There were fifteen males and three females. Apart from this
small group, in the whole series the great majority are males.
This predominance may be correlated with the greater
incidence of septic wounds (trauma) and boils and car-
buncles in the male sex.
3. Primary foci .. These were as follows .
4. Onset. —The symptoms as a rule are related to a primary septic focus which had
sometimes been neglected. The illnesses begin in various ways, sometimes
with headache or pains in the chest, abdomen or limbs, occasionally with
vomiting or biliousness, feverishness, flushing of the skin and thirst or profuse
perspiration. There was a definite chill in only one case and rigors in none.
The local lesion sometimes flared up but in some cases only a serous exudate
was found in the inflamed tissues. Enlargement of lymph glands is sometimes
mentioned. Osteomyelitis or periostitis is noted in a few cases.
5. Temperature. —This is usually high but remitting one, two or three degrees daily.
Temperatures of 104° F. and 105° F. are reached in most cases, and in many
there is a marked rise and in a smaller number a fall before death.
6. The Pulse. —The pulse is usually very rapid and soft. In most cases it varies
daily from 120 to 160, but usually reaches 180 towards the end, even in adults.
7. Respiration. —This is always moderately rapid, varying daily from 25 to 40 on the
average but in several cases the rate is much higher, from 40 to 60. It tends
to increase towards the end. The rate is apparently influenced by the extent
of the pulmonary lesions, and fibrinous or septic pleurisy and plumonary
infarcts or abscesses are common. Respiration may be either rapid and quiet,
grunting or gasping. Dyspnoea is occasionally a feature.
8. The Blood. —The illnesses were often of short duration or the patients were admitted
in a very grave condition so that blood cultures were usually done rather late
in the disease. In twelve cases the diagnosis was made by blood culture,
In no case was the finding of a sterile blood followed by the autopsy finding
of staphylococcal septicaemia or septico-pysemia. The number of days
between positive blood culture and death were as follows :
The day of death .. .. .. .. 3 cases
One day before death .. .. .. .. 3 cases
Two days before death .. .. .. .. 3 cases
Three days before death .. .. .. 1 case
Fourteen days before death .. .. .. .. 1 case
Fifteen days before death ~ ~ .. ~ 1 case


Leucocyte counts were done in nine cases and showed considerable
variations. In two of the cases there were only 8,000 leucocytes. Most
commonly the number was between 10,000 and 20,000 (five cases). In the
remaining two cases there were respectively 22,000 and 58,000. In nearly all
the cases the count was made within a day or two of death.
9. The Skin and Connective Tissues. —In many cases no observations are recorded.
In several there is profuse sweating which is sometimes an early symptom.
The skin may be flushed, hot and dry. Apparently until near the end the
colour may be good though pallor may be present. There may be marked
lividity post-mortem. In one case, a boy of fifteen years, two days before death
the skin became ashy grey with blue lips, ears and nose and glazed eyes. In
another case cyanosis was marked. A notable feature in a number of cases
is the occurrence of small and large btillse on the same limb as the primary
focus, or fleeting red patches with oedema particularly on the forearms even
though the primary focus be elsewhere. These are apparently metastatic
lesions. In some there are secondary subcutaneous abscesses. Secondary
infection of joints is distinctly rare as compared with streptococcal and
pneumococcal infections. Sometimes there is direct spread of a furuncle into
adjacent subcutaneous and even muscular tissues.
10. Digestive System. —Troublesome symptoms are uncommon. The mouth is some-
times very dry, the tongue usually furred, the breath sometimes offensive
Vomiting if present is usually an early symptom. Diarrhoea is rare. The
abdomen is often distended.
11. Execretory System. —Albuminuria is noted in several cases, glycosuria in only one
case. Oedema of the limbs is always either inflammatory or follows venous
thrombosis.
12. Nervous System. —-Nervous symptoms are often prominent. Delirium is specially
noted in seven cases. It is either very early or does not occur until the last
two or three days. Not infrequently it gives place to coma towards the end.
In another case there were headache and drowsiness deepening to coma. In
two others also coma developed apparently without preceding delirium. In
another case there was mental confusion. Marked restlessness sometimes
accompanies the delirium. A young man of 25 years, on the day of his death
“ stared wildly with almost fixed pupils, clutching fiercely at objects or
bystanders, then relapsed into general convulsive movements or twitellings.”
Pain is not infrequently noted early in the illness. Stiffness and pain about
the local lesion, or pains in the limbs or joints are not infrequent. Pains in
the chest are not uncommon and appear to be due to pleurisy or pleuro-
pericarditis. Incontinence of urine and faeces are often coincident with states
of delirium and coma. The outstanding features are the effects upon the higher
centres —stupor, delirium or unconsciousness. This is in strong contrast with
the lucid mental condition often seen in streptococcal septicaemia.
13. Special Features. —A pleural friction rub or an effusion from which staphylococci
were cultivated is not uncommon. Lobar or broncho-pneumonia has been
suspected where congestion, infarction or abscess formation have been found
at autopsy. Typhoid fever has been suspected but the Widal reaction has been
absent when sought for.
14. Duration. —This is not always easy to determine. There is evidence that a
decided rise in temperature and pulse rate and varying effects upon other
systems mark the transition from local infection to septicaemia or septico-
pyaemia. There is great variation in the length of the illnesses. One case had
a raised temperature for only two days before death occurred. In other cases
the duration was apparently 3 days, 6 days (3), 7, 10, 11 and about 21 days
(3). Several patients died within 24 hours of admission to hospital but had
been ill for a few days in their homes. The patient whose acute illness lasted
only two days had nevertheless septic infarcts in the lungs, and a few small
abscesses in the kidneys.
15. Lesions at Autopsy. —-There is no definite evidence that any patient with
staphylococcal septicaemia or septico-pyaemia recovered. All the patients in
whom the diagnosis was established by blood culture (12 cases) died and nine


of them came to autopsy. These and the remaining six cases in which the
diagnosis was made at autopsy make a total of fifteen autopsies. There is no
significant difference between the findings in those cases which gave a positive
blood culture and those in which blood cultures were not done.
The Heart frequently shows some dilatation particularly of the right side and not
infrequently there is greyish or white clot in the right auricle and ventricle.
In only one case is ulcerative endocarditis noted and that on the tricuspid
valve with ulceration spreading through the adjacent heart wall and finally
rupture and haemopericardium. In one other case there was some mitral
stenosis, but it was not thought that there was any acute endocarditis. The
infarction of the lungs, therefore, is not due to malignant valvular disease. In
only two cases is pericarditis recorded.
Lungs. —ln most cases there are obvious pulmonary lesions. Fibrinous or septic
pleurisy is frequently mentioned. Septic infarction is the most common
lesion of the lung itself. The infarcts often stand out prominently and
apparently progress rather rapidly to abscess formation. Large branches of
the pulmonary artery supplying an extensive infarcted portion of one lobe
were found definitely thrombosed in one case. In other cases there is congestion
of the lung or collapse associated with a large pleural exudate. Subpleural
and interstitial haemorrhages may also occur. Septic mediastinitis is noted in
one case.
Spleen. —Almost invariably the spleen is moderately enlarged and very soft, even
diffluent. Sometimes it is noted as enlarged and friable. Haemorrhages are
also described but in no case infarcts or abscesses formation.
Liver. —This organ is usually described as enlarged and congested, sometimes also
as fatty. Abscesses are not noted in any case.
Kidneys. —These are generally described as swollen or congested. Multiple abscesses
are common, though in several cases there were only a few abscesses. They
are generally described as small or miliary. Infarction is described in two
cases and haemorrhages in two.
Alimentary Tract. —Lesions of note are rarely found, though the examination is often
incomplete. In one case haemorrhages into the wall of the small and large
bowel are described.
Brain. —In several cases congestion of the external blood vessels is noted, and in one
case numerous sub-arachnoid haemorrhages. In a number of cases it was not
examined.
Skin. —In two cases there is special mention of marked lividity of the face and chest
In one it is noted that lividity was not confined to the dependent parts. In
another there were abscesses and petechiae in the skin of the back and in
another blebs in the skin of the forearm.
The Primary Focus. —In two cases dissection of the veins from the lesion showed
definite thrombosis.
Post-mortem Cultures. —The heart blood and spleen give possible findings, though in
by no means all the cases were cultures made, since the blood had given staphy-
lococci during life. Abscesses of the lung also gave staphylococci. Cultures
from the brain were made in one case and gave positive results.
Summarizing these findings one may classify the autopsy findings and divide them into—
(1) Septicaemia in the strict sense, without secondary foci : three cases.
(2) Septico-pyaemia, with infarctions, abscess formations, septic inflammations of
serous membranes : twelve cases.
Crypto-genic cases. —
These are rare and constitute an interesting type. There are two in this series.
One patient, a boy of fifteen years, had been feeling “ off colour ” for a few days, then
complained of fleeting pains in the joints, and later on of pains in the chest especially during deep
inspiration. There was some dyspnoea. No primary focus was found. On admission to hospital
his temperature was 104° F., respiration 35-40, pulse 130. His skin was ashy grey, and his lips,
ears and nose bluish. A pleural friction rub was heard over the left base and crepitations over


the right base. He became delirious, showed albuminuria and gave a positive blood culture.
Diagnosis was not much helped by the leucocyte count in this case. Three days before death
it was 10,000 with 79% neutrophils and 4% eosinophils. It cannot be too greatly stressed
that leucocyte counts should be often repeated to bring out their real value in diagnosis and
prognosis. Temperature pulse and respiration rate rose steadily, reaching respectively 106 *B° F.,
190 and 80 on the day of death, five days after admission. There was no autopsy.
The second patient was a man of 33 years, who had a bilious attack with vomiting. On
the following day he felt better. On the third day he felt sick again and had abdominal pains
without diarrhoea. There were headache, anorexia, feverishness and some cough. On
admission the temperature was 102° F., pulse rate 110 and respiration rate 40. The provisional
diagnosis was typhoid fever but the Widal test proved negative. The spleen was thought to
be enlarged. There was a previous history of rheumatic fever, nineteen years before, and a
systolic murmur was detected. Nothing else was elicited in the physical examination. His
temperature remained high —103° F. to 105° F. —the pulse only 110, but rising to 180 before death
which occurred five days after admission. On the third day staphylococci were cultivated from
the blood. The urine contained much albumin. At autopsy the skin showed much lividity.
The bases of both lungs were greatly congested. The mitral valve showed some stenosis and
there were a few vegetations, which were noted as “ not recent,” on the fimbriae of the valve
cusps. The left ventricle showed hypertrophy and dilatation. The spleen was much enlarged,
friable and congested. The liver was large and fatty. Both kidneys showed cloudy swelling,
petechial haemorrhages and one showed two septic infarcts. There were haemorrhages into the
bowel wall, more notably in the colon. These haemorrhages were “ not infiltrated ”. Culture
from the spleen and heart blood gave staphylococcus aureus. No primary focus was found.


APPENDIX 31.
DEFINITION OF SOME TECHNICAL TERMS USED.
1. ALLERGY is a natural inherited condition of hypersensitiveness to the injection of
various substances which is not dependent in any way on antibody production.
2. ANAPHYLAXIS is a special form of hypersensitiveness induced by the injection of
substances with antigenic properties, the toxic phenoma following the re-injection of the antigen
after a suitable interval of time.
3. ANTIGEN. A substance which on injection into live animals stimulates the production
of antibody.
4. ANTITOXIN UNIT (Ehrlich) was originally defined as the smallest quantity of
antitoxin that would entirely prevent all the toxic effects of 100 minimum lethal doses of the
particular diphtheria toxin which Ehrlich was using at the time.
5. BACTERIOPHAGE (phage). An agent which causes dissolution of the micro-organisms
with which it is propagated.
6. C.L.D. (certainly lethal dose) is for any species the smallest dose of a toxic substance
which invariably kills an animal of that species.
7. DANYSZ PHENOMENON. A dose of toxin which is exactly neutralized when
mixed in one operation with a given quantity of antitoxin, if added to the same amount of
antitoxin in successive moieties, results in a toxic mixture.
8. L + DOSE is the least quantity of diphtheria toxin which when mixed with one unit
of standard antitoxin and injected subcutaneously into a guinea pig of 250 grams kills within
four to five days.
9. M.L.D. (minimum lethal dose) of diphtheria toxin is the least quantity of any given
toxin which when injected subcutaneously into a guinea pig of 250 grams kills it in about four
days.
10. MULLER PHENOMENON (Haemophagie). The appearance on blood agar of a
zone of punctate haemolysis round a staphylococcal colony at a small interval from its edge.
11. SCHICK TEST. The intradermal injection of a minute dose of diphtheria toxin to
determine by the occurrence of reaction the susceptibility of an individual to diphtheria. A
positive reaction indicates that an amount of circulating antibody insufficient to protect the
individual is present.
