FOREWORD
While attached to the Flying Doctor Base at
Cloncurry, Queensland, in 1948, Dr. A. Anderson
prepared certain medical notes for use in connection
with the Standard Medicine Chest supplied by the
Flying Doctor Service of Australia to outposts linked
with the Base Wireless Stations of the Service.
The Federal Council desires to express its
appreciation of the interest shown by Dr. Anderson
in the preparation of the notes. These have been
considered by Dr. George Simpson?Hon. Secretary
of the Federal Council?and certain other Doctors
associated with the Service.
At the meeting of the Federal Council held in
1950 it was unanimously agreed that the notes,
with certain additions, be published for general
distribution throughout the areas served by our
respective bases.
To the notes has been added ?Notes on Giving
Medical History over the Air,? which, with the
accompanying charts, were prepared by Dr. J. C.
Edwards, of Wyndham, in conjunction with Sister
L. Garlick, of the W.A. Department of Public
Health. Sister Garlick is Infant Health Sister in the
Kirnberleys.
The production of this booklet has been possible
through the legacy received by the Federal Council
from the late Miss C. S. Higgins, of Melbourne.
The notes are now distributed bearing in mind the
objects of the Service, ?to foster develop and safe-
guard the health of residents in sparsely settled areas
of the Commonwealth of Australia,? and ?to foster
promote assist and conduct research in medicine
aviation radio and other matter appertaining to the
health morale and physical well-being of pioneers.?

Giving a Medical History
It makes it much easier for the Doctor if a good medical
history is given.
Before giving a description of an illness to your Flying
Doctor Base, check and record these points as listed below:
ALWAYS STATE? Patient?s name, age, sex, occupation
and race.
TAKE TEMPERATURE, PULSE AND
RESPIRATION.
FIND OUT?
Of what does the patient complain?
Where is the complaint?
How long has the patient had it?
What has already been done for it?
Is it becoming better or worse?
Has the patient had any similar attacks before?
Has the patient had any other serious illness or
operation?
In case of an accident when did it occur and how?


NOTE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF THE
FOLLOWING SEVEN CONDITIONS
1. Pain and Tenderness
See chart below, also note if any previous attacks.
Is it affected by?eating, moving, breathing, passing
water, opening bowels?
2. Fever
At what time of day does this occur? Is it accom-
panied by sweating or shivering attacks?
3. Breathlessness
Is this present all the time or only after exertion?
Is breathing difficult or more rapid than usual?
Do the attacks come at night?
Does the patient sleep sitting up?
Is there any wheezing or coughing?
4. Cough
Is it painful, constant or spasmodic?
Is there sputum? Does it contain blood?
5. Nausea and Vomiting
Is this associated with pain or eating?
6. Passing of Blood
Is it vomited or coughed up?
Is it passed by bowels or in urine?
Particularly note colour. In vomitus it may be bright
red or resembling coffee grains; passed by bowel it
may contain flecks of bright blood or may be black
and tar-like.
7. Inquire are patient?s bowels normally regular. Is he
constipated?
If so, is he passing wind?
Is there any blood or mucus in the stool?
Is there any pain or difficulty in passing water?
Is there any blood visible in the urine?

A CLEAR DESCRIPTION WILL BE OF ASSISTANCE
TO THE PATIENT AND APPRECIATED BY THE
DOCTOR DIAGNOSING THE CASE.
If you receive advice over the air, it is always
appreciated if you report back progress.
Thank You,


SECTION A
First Aid
1. REST. SHOCK
Rest , and prevention and treatment of Shock are
the most important measures to take in any case of
injury or sickness.
REST. ?In case of broken bone this is obtained by
splinting. In the case of a cut, a dressing and bandage
and suture will ensure rest for cut edges and allow healing.
In the case of sickness of any sort rest for the body
is encouraged by a clean, comfortable bed, by easing pain
and by giving a sedative or sleeping draught if necessary.
SHOCK results from any injury or haemorrhage, and
may be the most important factor to prevent and treat.
In all cases measures must be taken to prevent develop-
ment of severe shock. Guard against mental anxiety,
blood loss, cold, and pain. Calm patient and remove from
excitement, visitors, etc. Control bleeding. Keep warm
with rugs, hot stones or bottles. Give hot drinks with
sugar. In case of a fracture, splint the limb. In all cases
insist on resting, lying down with head low.
In severe cases, elevate foot of bed on a chair or
blocks.
In treating shock, the important things are ?
(1) restore body heat
(2) replace body fluid.
2. APPENDICITIS.
If the patient feels nauseated or vomits, and has pain
starting near navel and later on the right side of the
abdomen between navel and groin, it may be a case of
appendicitis.
Proceed as follows Contact Doctor at once, and until
medical aid is available
1. Give nothing by mouth, except sips of water.
2. Sit well up in bed with 4-5 pillows.
3. Apply a hot water bag (or bottle containing hot
water, wrapped in newspaper) to the area.


4. Give phenobarbital (No. 10), 2 tablets; i.e., 1 gr. to
an adult. Grains Ito a child of 5.
or Dovers Powder (No. 11), 2 tablets for an adult.
Half dose to a child of 5.
5. Do not give castor oil or cascara, etc. This is most
important, as it may perforate the appendix and
cause a fatal peritonitis.
3. BURNS AND SCALDS.
A severe burn or scald is a very serious injury.
Household Burns and Scalds.
1. If the skin does not blister, just put on Tannafax
(No, 2) and then cover up with gauze and a
bandage. Take 2 tabs of APC (No, 5) for the pain.
2. If the skin does blister?
(a) Get a friend to carefully wash his hands, boil
up scissors, forceps and a kidney dish, also
some water with pieces of cotton wool in the
water. Swab the blister several times with the
boiled water to which Dettol (No. 22) has been
added (1 dessertspoon of Dettol to a pint).
Now snip the blister and remove the skin from
over the top of the blister. This should be
relatively free from pain. Now take a clean
piece of gauze or gauze bandage and dip it in
Proflavine (No. 27) after applying Vaseline
(No. 14) to one side. Apply the gauze to the
burn with the vaseline side away from the burn.
Ungvita (No. 2a), covered with gauze is alter-
native dressing. Cover with cotton wool, and
do not dress again for four days unless it seems
to be suppurating, in which case some pus will
come through the bandage.
(b) Rest the part concerned, e.g., if an arm, in a
sling.
Severe Burns or Scalds.
Immediately notify the Doctor. He will probably
give instructions, but if he cannot be contacted,
proceed as follows: ?


Treatment of the Burnt A.rea.
Do not touch anything until the hands have
been carefully scrubbed for five minutes , �.s
one of the big causes of trouble in these cases
l hands Ctl � n whl � h he carried on unwashed
(1) Swab the whole area with 1 in 50 Dettol
solution (I dessertspoonful to a pint of boiled
water).
(2) Sterilise some gauze or linen of suitable size
by heating for 10 minutes in an oven. Smear
this sheeting (after scrubbing the hands) with
vaseline (No. 14) or Paraffin, and apply to
the burnt area, having smeared the burnt area
with Tannafax (No. 2) or Ungvita (No. 2a).
Bind up the burnt area after applying cotton
wool over the above sheeting.
If an arm or leg, immobilise it.
Treatment of Patient.
The patient will probably be shocked (i.e., the pulse
weak, sweating and pale). If does not appear shocked
but burn is extensive, treat as for shock.
Treatment of Shock.
(1) Give black coffee preferably. If not any coffee, give
alcohol (brandy, whisky, or sherry).
(2) Give the patient as much fluid as he will take, as
much fluid is lost into the burnt area.
(3) For pain, give Aspirin or APC (No. 5), 3 tablets
every 2 hours, for 4 doses.
(4) Keep the patient warm with hot water bottles (if
none, wrap a bottle containing hot water up in news-
paper) , and give him plenty of blankets. This applies
even on a warm day. If the day is extremely hot these
measures are not so necessary. Suffice it to say the
patient must not feel cold.
(5) Elevate the foot end of the bed on a chair or blocks.
These patients should he transported to hospital as
soon as possible.

end on any availabJe piece of furniture so that
the head is lowest, with the head over the edge of
the couch.
(3) Put fingers down the patient?s throat.
The windpipe arises towards the back of the throat
so seek the offending object in this position and
remove it.
(4) If still unsuccessful, continue as above with another
person giving artificial respiration.
// a child, turn the child upside down and hit forcibly on

still upside down.
Croup is a form of choking in a child due to inflammatory
we mg m the windpipe. It generally comes on at night
b?eth^ht7*
Treatment (until Doctor can give advice). Have child in
warm room with kettle on fire and steaming (to give moist
atmosphere). Put Friar?s Balsam in kettle or tin wTh
boiling water.
Give Phenobarbital gr, (No. 10).
5. CONVULSIONS.
Diagnosis ? Child first holds its breath and goes blue
Regular jerking movements then ensue. This is easily
diagnosed and, although rather frightening, is usually just
a symptom that the child has a high temperature


Treatment?
(1) Place the child in a bath of warm water with
approximately one tablespoon of mustard to a
gallon of water. Place a towel wrung out in cold
water over the child?s head. When spasm ceases,
remove the child from the bath, dry and wrap in
blanket.
(2) Now take the child?s temperature. If over 102,
give sponges every quarter hour with cold water
till the temperature comes down to 101.
(3) Give phenobarbital tablets (No. 10). One tablet
(gr. |) suitable for child 1 year-5 years.
Enquire over air as soon as possible about Sulpha
Drug administration.
(4) An aperient should generally be given; e.g..
Castor Oil (No. 26).
An enema may be necessary.
6. DROWNING.
(1) Pull out patient?s tongue ?if necessary, this can be
done by putting a safety pin through the tongue and
pulling it forward.
(2) Raise the lower part of the patient?s body ?in other
words, have the head sloping down so that water
will drain out.
(3) Turn the patient into the prone position; i.e., lying
on his stomach and turn the head to one side.
(4) Commence artificial respiration. This can be done by
placing the hands well out on either side of the back
of the chest over the lower ribs applying intermit-
tent pressure on for two seconds and then off for three
seconds, thus forcing air in and out of the lungs.
Make sure airway is free. Artificial respiration should
be kept up for one hour or until patient is breathing.
(5) Meantime, the patient should be kept warm with hot
water bottles and plenty of blankets. If neither of
those is available, a coat or rug, etc., may be used.
This last point is most essential.


7. FAINTING
The patient is pale, sweats, has a slow and feeble pulse.
The pupils are dilated, and the patient is usually uncon-
scious, but condition is transient and not serious.
Treatment:
(1) Lay the patient down in a cool place and elevate
the patient?s legs on pillows or some suitable
substitute.
(2) The patient?s head should be kept low
(3) Legs and arms should be massaged towards the
heart.
(4) An ice pack should be applied to the face.
(5) Smelling salts or a weak solution of ammonia
should be applied to the nostrils.
(6) If the patient becomes blue, push the jaw forwards,
open mouth and pull out tongue to ensure a free
airway.
If the teeth are tightly clenched, they may be
forced apart by placing the handle of a spoon
between the teeth and then twisting it around at
right angles.
(7) When patient can swallow, give small quantity of
brandy (dessertspoon in water) or spirits of
ammonia.
8. (A) FRACTURES.
A fracture means a broken bone
The Recognition of a Fracture?
(a) Pain This is a constant feature, especially on
attempted movement.
(b) Swelling of the part This is also fairly constant,
and is due to injury of the muscles, etc,, overlying
the break.
(c) Deformity will also be present if the bone ends
are displaced to any extent. If the bone is just
cracked and there is no displacement, this will
not be present.


(d) Crepitus This means that on attempted move-
ment of the part the examiner may feel the bone
ends grating together.
The patient is also aware of this, and often they
can feel the bone ends grating together when the
examiner cannot do so.
(e) Inability to use the limb This is largely due to
the pain, but also partly due to the fact that the
muscles which move the limb are attached to the
bone, and they cannot exert their normal action
if the bone is broken. Although ' there are the
classical signs of fracture, the old saying, ?Seeing
is believing? holds true with fractures also. A
severe break anyone can pick. If, however, there
is just a fine crack, the only way to be certain is
to X-ray the area, as even the finest crack will
show up on a good X-ray plate.
Treatment Doctor must be contacted, but First Aid
is very necessary.
1. Firstly, the break itself?
(a) A Compound Fracture is where the skin is broken
by the bone, and the end of the bone may appear
on the surface. If this is the case, cover the
broken skin area with a clean antiseptic dressing
and cotton wool. Then proceed as for a simple
fracture.
(b) If it is just a simple fracture, the most important
thing to do is to immobilise it. The limb may be
gently straightened. Do not use force, but exten-
sion by pulling will ease pain. To immobilise it
get two pieces of board the size and length of
course will depend on what bone is broken. Cover
them with a very thick layer of cotton wool or
some substitute, and bind them on to the broken
bone.
N. 8.: It is important to immobilise the joint above
and the joint below. That is to say, if the leg is
broken below the knee it is important to extend the
splint above the knee and below the ankle.


A splint cannot be too long, but it can very easily
be too short.
Immobilisation is the most important factor in
reducing pain.
2. The Patient A break is a very painful thing. When
properly immobilised as above, the pain will be con-
siderably relieved as the bone ends will not be con-
tinually moving on one another. However, there will
be considerable pain still, and perhaps some shock,
depending on what bone is broken.
For pain ?lf an adult, give three APC (No. 5)
tablets at once. These may be repeated in four hours.
For shock A shocked patient will feel faint, look
pale, have a poor volume pulse, and will probably be
sweating with a cold skin.
So for Shock ?
(1) Give stimulants; e.g., coffee (black) or alcohol.
(2) Elevate the patient?s feet ?if the patient is in
bed, lift up the end of the bed on a chair or
blocks.
(3) Keep warm.
(4) Keep up patient?s morale.
(5) Keep still and quiet, and do not jolt or knock.
It is important to remember that pain makes
shock worse.
8. (B) FRACTURES IN SPECIAL AREAS.
JAW Recognition : The best way to tell whether a patient
has a fractured jaw or not is to look inside the mouth
and notice the tooth alignment. In the upper or lower
jaw it can be quite easily picked where the teeth verge
out of alignment.
Treatment : A bandage is applied under the jaw
holding the jaw in a closed position. This bandage
should be tied above the head and a second encircling
bandage bound from the forehead to the back of the
head, with a twist on either side around the first
bandage ?it is really much the same as tying a
parcel with string. The patient should only drink
fluids through his closed teeth.


SKULL Recognition : This is often recognised by blood
or clear fluid issuing from the ears, nose or back of
throat. Of course, blood may well issue from these
areas without the skull being fractured.
Haemorrhages may also appear in the eyes.
Treatment : A pleget of clean cotton wool should be
inserted into the ear or nose as the case may be.
(a) The pupils should be regularly checked and a
record made of any change in size.
(b) The patient should be kept quiet, if necessary by
giving two grains phenobarbital (No. 10) by
mouth (for an adult).
SPINE Recognition : Usually an irregularity is easily
visible in the back. Paralysis may be present
below fracture.
Treatment: The great danger is nipping of the spinal
cord. Movements must be carried out with great
care, and moving patient in one piece. The patient
should be placed on his front with a pillow under his
chest. If this proves very uncomfortable, he may lie
on his back with a pillow under the small of his back.
The object of course of both these manoeuvres is to
keep the back well bent forwards, and to prevent
pressure on the spinal cord.
RIBS A fractured rib may or may not be serious.
Usually it is not serious.
Recognition: Pain on breathing and if pressure is
applied to the mid part of the chest front and back,
and the two hands approximated pain will be felt
where the rib is broken.
Treatment: Adhesive plaster should be applied while
the patient breathes out as vigorously as possible.
The strapping should overlap the mid line front and
back.
PELVIS A fractured pelvis is often a very serious thing
indeed as the bladder may be injured.
Recognition: Pressure on either side of the pelvis
causes severe pain.


Treatment : The treatment of a fractured pelvis is
often very complicated. The first aid treatment is
usually very simple a binder ( e.g., of sheeting
about one foot wide and long enough to encircle the
pelvis) is placed around the pelvis, and bound as
tightly as possible by clipping with safety pins.
Notice should be made if patient is able to pass
urine, and whether urine passed contains blood.
LEGS AND ARMS
Recognition ; The cardinal signs mentioned under
fractures should be looked for pain, deformity,
crepitus, swelling and inability to use the part.
Treatment : Immobilisation with two broad splints well
covered with cotton wool on either side of the limb
in the lower limb immobilising the joint above and
the joint below.
IN THE ARM; The arm should always be placed in a
sling as well as the splint being applied. If the fore-
arm is broken the splint should immobilise the joint
below; i.e., the wrist, but if a bent splint is not
available, the sling will be sufficient to immobilise the
joint above; i.e., the elbow.
FINGER: The finger should be immobilised in the bent
position, and this can be best done by cutting a tin
splint and binding the finger on to it after bending
the splint to form part of the circumference of a
circle.
CLAVICLE OR COLLAR BONE: This is the bone that
joins the breast bone (or sternum) to the tip of the
shoulder.
Recognition: The signs of fracture are present in this
area, and the whole arm drops. Usually the patient
will be seen holding the arm up with his sound arm,
supporting it just above the wrist.
Treatment:
(1) Put the arm in a sling.
(2) Bind the arm to the side by a bandage around
the arm and encircling the body, and tie it as
tightly as possible with comfort to the patient.
If the patient lies flat on the back on a firm surface
the clavicle sets itself.


9. HAEMORRHAGE ( i.e Bleeding).
1. If the arm or finger is cut, elevate the part; with
antiseptic dressing apply firm pressure over wound.
2. If an artery is cut this is very serious. It can be
recognised by bright red blood coming from the area
in regular spurts with each heart beat.
(a) Apply very firm pressure directly over the area
time will not permit proper sterilisation, so
with some clean piece of linen and cotton wool
apply direct pressure and bind this very tightly
around the part, but only just tight enough to
control the bleeding. If the bleeding cannot be
controlled in this way, apply a very tight tourni-
quet on the heart side of the bleeding area, and
leave on.
After half an hour the tourniquet must be released;
if there is any sign of bleeding recurring, immedi-
ately tighten the tourniquet again, but release each
half hour for a few minutes, otherwise the limb
may die.
N. 8.: In most cuts the bleeding can be controlled
by fair pressure with a piece of linen or gauze
and cotton wool applied directly over the cut,
bound firmly in position, and the part elevated if
practicable.
General Treatment of the Patient
As for shock, under burns and fractures. This is only
necessary if much blood is lost.
Miscarriage (first 3 months of pregnancy). If any
bleeding in early pregnancy, put patient to bed and
contact Doctor.
Treat for shock see under fracture and burns.
(a) If loss of blood not great, just apply menstrual
pad.


If the bleeding is severe and looks as though it
will threaten the patient?s life, packing may be
necessary.
(1) Wash pubic area with Dettol 1 in 50. Push
firmly down on lower abdomen and expel
blood clot from vagina before packing. For the
pack, cut a piece of linen about three inches
wide and about three feet long and sterilise
it by putting it in a hot oven for 10 minutes.
Four 3-inch gauze bandages may be used
instead.
Now boil up forceps and a kidney dish for
5 minutes in water.
Now place the pack in glycerine (No. 32) in
the boiled kidney dish.
Now grasp the end of the pack with the
forceps and firmly pack the vagina. Apply
external pads.
Only do this in case of severe haemorrhage, as
it may introduce infection.
(2) Put on ?Sulpha? drugs (No. 18) (see else-
where), and ?QES? (No. 39), as advised
by Doctor.
(3) Carefully inspect all clots passed for informa-
tion of Doctor.
Haemorrhage from lung, Haemoptysis. Bright frothy
blood coughed up.
Treatment Rest. Nothing hot by mouth, only ice
cold drinks. Contact Doctor.
Haemorrhage from stomach, Haematemesis. Dark
blood and ?Coffee grounds? vomited up. There will
always be considerable bleeding into bowel in addition
and patient may be very collapsed. Bleeding into
bowel is indicated by dark, tarry motions.
Treatment Rest. Iced water only by mouth. Trans-
port to hospital at earliest.


10. HEAD INJURIES.
A head injury is almost invariably due to a fall on
the head, although it may also be caused by a direct blow
on the head. The symptoms are due to injury to the
brain, and all cases should be regarded seriously, and
Doctor must be contacted.
Symptoms and signs. The patient may be?
(a) Unconscious.
(b) Semi -conscious.
(c) Maniacal.
(d) Have been unconscious and then regain conscious-
ness, may vomit and be difficult to control
(concussion).
The respiration may be stertorous (which means noisy)
if the patient is unconscious.
In more serious cases there is increased tension in the
cranial caviety ( i.e ., skull) ; the patient may become?
(a) Deeply unconscious.
(b) Have a slow pulse (Normal, 72 per minute).
(c) Have unequal pupils or facial paralysis.
There may also be bleeding from the ear and the nose,
indicating a probable fracture of the skull.
Treatment;
(1) Lay flat in bed.
(2) If bleeding from the ear or nose, put a clean piece
of cotton wool in the appropriate orifice.
(3) If not unconscious but difficult (as these cases
frequently are), give 4 tablets of No. 10 (Pheno-
barbital, gr. by mouth to an adult. This may
be repeated in six hours if the patient does not
settle down.
(4) If deeply unconscious, give a magnesium sulphate
(epsom salts) enema. This is given by dissolving
three ozs. of epsom salts in six ozs, of water, and
giving as an enema. This enema must be retained
to be of value. To accomplish this approximate
the buttocks for a few minutes and elevate the
foot of the bed.


(5) For the Doctor?s information ?
(a) Take the pulse every 2 hours a slow
pulse is a bad sign.
(b) Watch the pupils and note the relative sizes
on both sides. (Keep diagnostic chart of
this.)
11. POISONING.
Most cases of poisoning occur in young children who,
as all of us know, are constantly picking up things and
tasting them.
An adult may, of course, swallow some poisonous fluid
accidentally. Then some cases are suicidal.
General Treatment:
(1) Empty the Stomach (this must be done in all
cases). Thus may be done by?
(a) Mustard one tablespoonful in 8 ozs. of
warm water.
(b) Salt and water.
(c) Tickling the back of the throat.
Save stomach contents for identification by
Doctor.
(2) For pain Aspirin or APC tablets for an adult,
3 tablets four-hourly. Also a hot water bag, hot
blankets, antiphlogestine poultice or hot water
bottle applied to the area.
(3) Give fluids freely ?milk or water. The idea of
this is to wash the poison through the system as
soon as possible.
(4) Stimulants Only give if the patient seems
unduly sleepy or shows signs of collapse; give
coffee or brandy if conscious.
If unconscious, it is important to remember that
coffee and brandy can also be given per rectum
with enema tubing. It should be given slowly,
and the end of the bed elevated.


ANTIDOTES?
N. 8 .: Charcoal - In all cases of poisoning, get
charcoal out of the fire and, after crushing it
up, take two tablespoonfuls, washing it down
with water. This should be done immediately
as it binds itself on to all poisons and stops
their absorption.
Acids Baking soda in water or soap and water
solution.
Alkalies, e.g., ammonia vinegar or lemon juice.
Carbolic and Lysol magnesium sulphate (ep-
som salts) in water.
Arsenic, e.g., weed killer, sheep dip, etc. castor
oil and olive oil.
lodine starch and water.
Sleeping Tablets, e.g., Phenobarbital, etc.
give Black Coffee; if patient unconscious, give
rectally. Keep patient awake.
Corrosive Sublimate large quantities of milk
and white of eggs.
Phosphorus, e.g., matches and rat poison
Epsom Salts in water.
Prussic Acid and Cyanides ammonia to nos-
trils, Artificial respiration should be started at
once as cyanide poisons the breathing centre.
Carbon Monoxide poisoning due to fumes
from motor cars, etc. Remove from fumes. Give
artificial respiration if unconscious. If conscious,
make patient breathe as deeply as possible.
Morphia artificial respiration. Rouse patient.
Strong black coffee by mouth or rectum. Am-
monia to nostrils.
Strychnine Phenobarbital (No. 10), gr. 2
orally (4 tabs.). Do not touch patient more than
necessary. Tannic acid in form of strong tea.
(This delays absorption.)
Formalin dilute ammonia 1 in 10,


12. SNAKE BITE.
Proceed as follows ?
1. Apply tourniquet on heart side of bite. Slowly release
in \ hour.
2. Cleanse the area by washing with water; if none avail-
able wash the area with saliva on a handkerchief.
3. Cut the area of the snake bite about i inch deep and
inch long, and let it bleed freely. It will hurt less
the sharper the knife. Now apply a glycerine (No. 32)
dressing.
4. Treat for shock.
Inform the Doctor as soon as possible, so that he can
come and give an injection of anti-venine.
13. WOUNDS CLEAN AND INFECTED
1. Clean Wounds.
A clean cut or wound will heal naturally if it does not
become infected. Any cut, however small, may become
infected, with serious consequences. It is important,
therefore, to prevent infection, and nature will do the
rest. Once the dressing is put on a clean cut, it is
most important to keep it there and not to change it,
as, in changing it, it is likely infection will be
introduced. Every cut and scratch must be treated.
(1) Bathe the wound with ?
Dettol 1 in 50 (No. 22), or
Potassium permanganate (No. 6) 2 or 3 crystals
to make the water a deep purple colour.
(2) Apply proflavine (No. 27) on a piece of gauze.
(3) Cotton wool and bandage.
If the wound is extensive and it looks as though
it may stick to the dressing, put acriflavine on the
side of the gauze nearest the skin, and vaseline
(No. 14) on the other side.
(4) If skin edges gape, wound must be sutured by
Doctor.
(5) Leave dressing on, preferably till healed, in about
a week.


2. For an Infected Wound
This should be dressed frequently unlike a clean
wound.
(1) Clean the wound.
Use Dettol (No. 22) 1 in 50, for this purpose;
or, preferably, peroxide. Now swab over with
Acriflavine solution (No. 27), and then apply a
dressing of gauze soaked in Glycerine (No. 32). To
prevent this sticking, put vaseline on the other side
of the gauze. Cover with cotton wool and bandage.
(2) Contact Doctor.
(3) If the wound is in an area that is constantly
moved, e.g., knee, it is essential to keep it still to
get rapid healing; i.e., if the leg, rest in bed.
If an arm, put in a sling.
these cases, scrub the hands for five minutes
before starting the dressing, and get someone else to take
the corks out of bottles, etc., so as not to unsterilise the
hands. All trays, kidney dishes, scissors, forceps, etc.,
should be boiled for 5 minutes. Any dressings used may
be sterilised by heating in the oven for 10 minutes, and
only handle these articles after scrubbing the hands as
above.


SECTION B
Common Medical Conditions
1. boils and carbuncles.
Boils are due to infection occurring in a hair follicle.
The usual organism is a staphylococcus, which is a smalt
round germ.
The symptoms of boils are well known pain, swelling
and redness.
The symptoms and treatment of boils and carbuncles
are similar.
A carbuncle is essentially a very large boil that points
in numerous areas and discharges in numerous places.
Carbuncles and boils usually occur in people who are
low in health. It is therefore essential that an adequate
diet should be taken of plenty of milk meat, fruit and
vegetables, and that adequate sleep should be obtained.
Rare causes of boils and carbuncles are kidney trouble
and diabetes. Both of these cases may be excluded by a
urine examination.
Treatment of Boils and Carbuncles.
(1) As mentioned above, in way of general treatment,
plenty of food and rest is necessary.
(2) A course of sulpha drugs may be advised. Enquire
over air about same. Penicillin (which has to be
injected by Doctor) cures quickly.
(3) Drink plenty of water.
(4) For pain, use Aspirin or APC. As many as three
four-hourly may be taken by an adult.
(5) Rest the part if a limb is involved bed if the leg,
a sling if the arm.
(6) In the way of local treatment?
(a) If in a hairy area, shave about two or three inches
around the area.
(b) Apply Plastine (No. 35) dressing till discharging.


(c) When discharging, apply a mixture of epsom or
glaubers salts (No. 33) (magnesium sulphate and
sodium sulphate respectively) in an equal quan-
tity of glycerine (No. 32). If only glycerine is
available, use this alone. Apply all these solutions
on a small piece of lint.
To the area round the boil apply Hydrarg ammon
dil (mercury ointment) (No. 12).
Relief will be obtained in bed at night by applying a
hot water bag, or placing a bottle filled with hot water
and wrapped in brown paper near the area.
N.B. ?A boil is very dangerous on the face, below the
eye, at the side of the nose, and, if infection occurs in this
area, Doctor should be consulted as soon as possible. ,
2. CONJUNCTIVITIS.
(popularly called ?sore? eyes)
Inflamed eyes may be due to many causes, the most
common being conjunctivitis.
Treatment:
It is most important to ?
(a) Keep dust out.
(b) Keep glare out of eyes
(c) Keep flies away.
This is best accomplished with dark glasses and fly nets.
(1) Bathe the eye every two hours with boric
solution No. 7. 1 teaspoon to a cup of water.
(2) Instil Argyrol drops (No. 23) after each eye
wash, or Sulphacelamide eye drops (No. 24a).
(3) Doctor should be contacted if there is not rapid
improvement.
LIME IN THE EYES.
Put milk or sugar in water in the eyes.


FOREIGN BODIES IN THE EYE.
To remove ?
(1) Bathe the eye by using an eye bath.
(2) If foreign body can be seen, remove with corner
of handkerchief or wisp of cotton wool.
(3) If it cannot be seen, turn the upper lid back by
standing behind the patient and rolling the upper
eye lid over a match stick.
(4) Instil Castor Oil (No. 26) into the eye with an
eye dropper.
(5) Apply pad and bandage.
N.B. ?lf the eye remains sore, inform the Doctor, as if the
foreign particle remains, an ulcer may form on the eye
which is serious.
3. DIARRHOEA.
This, of course, may be due to an enormous variety of
causes, and this treatment only applies to the ordinary
acute variety due to mild food poisoning.
(1) Give a dose of castor oil (No. 26)
tablespoonful for an adult,
teaspoonful for a child.
(2) Stay in bed.
(3) Eat nothing and only have fluids such as weak tea
and warm water until the attack is improving.
{4) Take 15 drops of No. 19 (Tinct. opii et chloro-
formi). This may be repeated in 6 hours. (This
applies only to adults.)
(5) Take Sulphaguanidine tablets (No. 18a) ?10 to
start with and 5 three times a day (adult dose).
For a child, see ?Dosage of Sulpha Drugs.? (In-
form Doctor as soon as possible if this is done.)
(6) A hot water bottle on the abdomen will be found
soothing.
(7) In the case of young children, it is most important
to give adequate fluid to compensate for that lost
in frequent bowel actions. Water, Condensed Milk,
Barley Water, Fruit Juice.


4. EARACHE.
(a) If not discharging.
1. Instil No. 25 (Glyc ac Carbol) every three hours.
2. Apply a hot water bag or substitute to ear (see
previously).
3. Take Aspirin or APC tabs. (No. 5) for the pain
2 every 2 hours for an adult until relieved.
4. Sulpha drugs will probably be advised by Doctor.
(b) If the ear is discharging.
Before commencing the above treatment, twist a piece
of cotton wool around the end of a match stick, and clean
the pus away, then when all the pus has gone, again using
a similar piece of cotton wool on a match stick, dip it in
methylated spirits, and again clean the ear; then proceed
as under A.
N.B. ?Watch for any swelling or redness in the area behind
the ear. This is the mastoid area, and if the infection
spreads to this area it is very serious. Fortunately this is
rare.
To put in ear drops.
Use an eye dropper. If none available, put the solution
on some cotton wool and squeeze it into the ear.
5. HEAT CRAMPS AND HEAT STROKE.
Heat Cramps are due to a loss of salt from the body in
the form of perspiration. Cramps occur in the calves,
arms and even the muscles of the chest and abdomen.
The best treatment is to take as much salt as possible in
the food or in drinks as tablets.
Heat Stroke A moist heat, unsuitable clothing and lack
of ventilation predispose it. The patient?s temperature
shoots up to even 108�, coma and convulsions occur.
Treatment consists in placing the patient stripped naked
on a sheet (preferably waterproof) and ice packed around.
The patient placed in coolest available place and in a
draught or create a draught by fans.


If ice unavailable, use cold water packs. Cease treatment
when temperature falls to 102�.
The patient should drink iced water as soon as he is
capable of doing so.
In the way of prevention of another attack, as much cool
water should be drunk as possible, and as much salt as
possible taken with food.
6. HAND INFECTION.
All infections of the hand should be regarded seriously,
because if a hand infection gets a strong hold it often
means the fingers remain permanently stiff. The serious-
ness of this can readily be appreciated as it can cost a
man his livelihood.
The fingers are worked by tendons one in the back
that on contracting straightens the fingers and one in the
front that causes the finger to bend. These tendons are
enclosed in sheaths that bathe them in fluid. If a serious
infection occurs these sheaths become partially mutilated
and this causes the stiffness. Hence, all hand infections
must be regarded seriously.
Penicillin which must be injected by the Doctor is
the best and quickest treatment.
A hand infection, of course, is a simple matter as
regards diagnosis. It will be ?
(1) Hot.
(2) Painful.
(3) Tender.
(4) Swollen.
All four will usually be present, but sometimes only
some of these may be present. If the infection is limited
to the tip of the finger it is not so serious as, provided
it does not spread, it will not involve the tendon sheaths
mentioned, which start just behind the first joint.


Treatment:
(1) Infection around the nail.
(a) It is important to keep this dry. It usually
occurs in women, and it is most important to
keep the hand out of water.
(b) Regular 2-hourly application of methylated
spirits.
(c) Aspirin or APC (No. 5) for pain.
(2) Infection of end of finger.
(a) Apply heat either with a Plastine poultice (No.
35) (heated up every four hours), or by putting
the finger in hot water as often as possible.
(b) If this infection does not rapidly subside, enquire
re Sulpha drug administration.
(c) Splint as below.
(d) Aspirin or APC (No. 5), 2 every 4 hours for
pain.
(e) Drink a lot of water
(3) For more extensive hand infections
A Doctor should always be contacted, as if it spreads
the fingers as mentioned before may remain permanently
stiff.
(a) Apply heat plastine (No. 35) every 2 hours
or putting hand in hot water.
(b) Sulpha tablets as under 2.
(c) Drink a lot of water.
(d) Aspirin or APC (No. 5), as under 2, as this
condition very painful.
(e) Splinting.
The finger should be splinted so that if it does become
permanently stiff it will still be useful. The most useful
stiff finger is one that is bent a straight stiff finger bumps
into everything.
The arm should be put in a sling.


7. NOSE BLEEDING.
(1) Sit the patient up.
(2) Apply a towel wrung out in ice cold water to the
whole of the face area.
(3) Squeeze nose firmly or, pack nostril firmly with
cotton wool plug.
(4) Do not blow the nose
Bleeding vein is usually on nasal septum near front end.
Some elderly people at times have nose bleeding
endangering life which will not respond to the above
measures, but the measures outlined below will be rarelv
necessary as 99% of cases respond to the above treatment.
(1) Cut a piece of.gauze about a quarter of an inch wide
and eighteen inches long. Heat this for 10 minutes in the
oven. Boil up a kidney dish and forceps for 5 minutes.
Pour some acriflavine solution (No, 27) into the kidney
dish in which gauze strip has been placed, and with the
forceps firmly pack the nostril concerned, pushing the
pack as far back as it will go. This is a somewhat painful
procedure if done correctly. Leave in for 24 hours.
(2) Give phenobarbital grains 2 (No. 10), i.e., 4 x i
grain tabs, for an adult.
8. TOOTHACHE
(1) Take APC tablets (No. 5) every 2 hours (adult dose).
(2) Soak a piece of cotton wool in oil of cloves (No. 3)
and insert.
(3) Hot mouth washes.
(4) Have dental treatment as soon as possible.


SECTION C.
1. DOSAGE OF SULPHA DRUGS.
Sulpha drugs should only be given under medical
directions , as they are dangerous. If Doctor cannot
he contacted at once , and indications are clear , treat-
ment may be commenced and Doctor contacted as
soon as possible.
Sulphadiazine 4 tablets to start with and then 2 every
four hours.
Sulphapyridine 4 tablets to start with and then 2 every
M. & B 693 four hours.
Sulphathiazole 4 tablets to start with and then 2 every
M. & B 760 four hours.
Sulphamerazine 8 tablets to start with and then 2 every
four hours or 4 twice daily.
Sulphaguanidine If severe, 14 to start with and then 7
(for diarrhoea) three times a day.
If not so severe, 10 to start with, then
5 three times a day.
There are numerous other sulpha drugs, and sometimes
three are combined as in Sulphatriad.
Children?s dose can be worked out as follows: Take an
adult as anyone 20 or over.
If 5 or under, give iof the adult dose. If 10, give i the
dose, and so on.
At least 4 pints of water should be taken daily by an
adult taking sulphonamides.
If a patient is put on sulpha drugs, watch for the
following:?
(1) Blood in the urine or suppressed urine, due to
sulpha crystals irritating the urinary tract.
(2) Rashes ?of various types.
(3) Persistent temperature sometimes the tempera-
ture continues and rises due to sulphonamides
administration. If the patient is now taken off
sulphonamides, the temperature falls.


(4) Anaemia. The patient may become very pale due
to the sulphonamides affecting the blood stream.
(5). A sore throat may develop. This is the most
serious complication. It is due to the white blood
cells being greatly diminished, and if treatment is
not promptly started death will occur.
2. MIDWIFERY.
A real account of midwifery and its complications
would fill a book, so just a few practical points on a
normal case will be given; also an account of what to do
if haemorrhage starts, and if the baby does not breathe.
Preparation for delivery.
(1) Don?t panic, birth will probably be normal.
(2) Shave the patient?s pubic area or cut hairs close
with scissors.
(3) Boil up ?
1. Some string.
2. Some scissors.
3. F'orceps.
(4) Put several large pieces of linen in the oven for
10 minutes to sterilise them.
(5) Put some cotton wool swabs in 1 in 3 Dettol (No.
22).
The patient.
At first patient is best walking about, but when pains
are severe, and coming every few minutes lie the patient
on her back, and when each pain comes get her to grip
on to the top of the bed. This enables the abdominal
muscles to contract better.
2 grs. (4 tabs.) of Phenobarbital (No. 10) should be
given when severe pain starts. 1 gr. (2 tabs.) may be
given in two hours? time.
Moral encouragement is most important.


The Delivery.
(1) One of the pieces of sheeting should be put
beneath the vaginal area.
(2) The area should be swabbed (after the attendant
has carefully washed the hands for 5 minutes), with
1 in 3 Dettol solution.
The waters break before the birth.
The head will then be born, and if the shoulders do not
follow on they may be easily delivered by gentle traction
on the head, and, if necessary, a finger placed in the
armpit. The rest of the baby will follow on.
Attached to the baby?s umbilicus (navel) is the cord
leading to the placenta or ?after birth.?
Gently lay the baby between the mother?s legs with its
mouth unobstructed, and wait until the cord stops pulsat-
ing. Now tie the cord in two places with the string
one about 3 inches from the baby?s navel and the other
about six inches near the mother. These should be tied
very securely, especially the former. Now cut with the
scissors between the ties, and put the baby in a warm cot
and later put a sterile dressing over umbilicus and cord.
The after birth.
This usually comes away within about half an hour.
If it doesn?t do so, wait for one hour, when gentle pressure
on the mother?s abdomen will usually produce it. If gentle
pressure does not produce it, and there is no bleeding,
wait until medical attention is available.
Now cover the vaginal area, with one piece of sheeting
(prepared in the oven), folded up several times, or
alternatively with a menstrual pad which should be
sterilised by placing it in the oven for 10 minutes.
The mother?s abdomen over the uterus (womb) should
be rubbed vigorously. This causes the uterus to contract
and stops haemorrhage.
Only two complications will be mentioned:?
1. The baby does not breathe.
(a) Make sure there is no obstruction in the baby?s
mouth by putting a finger in and cleaning away
any mucus.


(b) Hold the baby by the legs (which causes any
mucus to drain out), and gently slap it on the back.
(c) If still no result, place the baby in a warm bath,
and gently press its chest several times.
If the mother starts bleeding.
(1) If the after birth has come away and bleeding
starts:
(a) Lift up the foot of the bed and treat as for
shock.
(b) Vigorously rub the mother?s abdomen over the
uterus.
(c) If haemorrhage is very severe, pack vagina
tightly, as under miscarriage.
This should only be done as a last measure as
it will probably cause a severe injection. Put
the patient immediately on sulpha drugs to
combat same.
(2) If the after birth has not come away and bleeding
starts ;
(a) Lift up the foot of the bed and treat as for
shock (see under burns).
(b) Vigorously rub the mother?s abdomen over
the uterus.
(c) If bleeding still continues, proceed as follows:
(1) Feel the top of the uterus.
(2) By pressing the hand well into the
abdomen, and facing the mother?s feet,
grasp the top of the uterus with the right
hand the thumb in front and the fingers
behind, wait until uterus becomes firm,
then push downwards on the uterus as
hard as possible. This is naturally pain-
ful, but will probably cause the alter
birth to appear, check the haemorrhage
and save the patient?s life.
(d) If still unsuccessful, and after birth not
delivered, proceed as under 1 (c).
