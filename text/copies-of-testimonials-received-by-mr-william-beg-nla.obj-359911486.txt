Mr. Walter Bentley informs me that
he is a candidate for the office of Cen-
sor of Films, &c. I have known Mr.
Bentley and various members of his
family for many years and I can con-
fidently say that I think he would per-
form the duties of the office with con-
scientiousness and efficiency. His long
experience of the theatre in its every
aspect in different parts of the world
has given him the necessary intimate
knowledge of the business, and his
well-known practical philanthropy gives
him the necessary desire to be of ser-
vice to the community. Altogether it
would be difficult to find anyone bet-
ter fitted for the post.

In reply to yours of yesterday ask-

appointment to the Censorship of Films
and Theatres, I would be glad to know
that you were successful in your ap-
plication. That something is to be
done in the way of eliminating the un-
desirable so far as possible from the
stage and picture show is gratifying,
but an experience such as yours is hard
to get, and yet very necessary so that
justice may be secured to the* manage-
ment, companies and audiences also.
The matter must be handled in a broad-
minded way and from my long know-
ledge of you, I fully believe you to
have that qualification.

Dec. Ist, 1916.
TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN.
Having learned that it is proposed to
appoint an official Censor of Theatri-
cal and Photo Plays, I have much
pleasure in stating that in my opinion
the appointment of Mr. Walter Bentley
would be the best that the Government
could make.
Mr. Bentley’s expert knowledge of
Dramatic Art would enable him to
readily detect the undesirable.
Having an interest in both social re-
form and the Dramatic Profession, he
would hold the balances evenly, and
whilst not unnecessarily harassing
producers of plays or picture showmen,
he could be relied upon to suppress
and discourage the objectionable feat-
ures too often seen upon the stage arid
picture sheet.
I feel sure that the appointment of
such an estimable citizen as Mr. Walter
Bentley will be unanimously approved.
Yours sincerely,

Having learned that my old and es-

atic Censor for Theatres and Films, I
have great pleasure and full confidence
in recommending him for -the appoint-
ment. I knew him quite 30 years ago
and more, during my residence in Dun-
edin, N.Z., and of course, since. He
has had wide experience, and is very
capable of expert and well-balanced
judgment, in matters of that character;
and I am sure will know how to dis-
tinguish himself in a confessedly diffi-
cult but vitally important function,
what is and what is not suitable or
“Tolerable” for public presentation;
avoiding the extremes of undue sever-
ity and of harmful laxity in his dis-
crimination.
I very heartily recommend him.
