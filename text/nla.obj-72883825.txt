PROLOGUE,
SPOKEN BY GEORGE BARRINGTON,
Jan. 16, 1706, at the Opening of the Theatre at Sydney,
in New South Wales.
From distant climes, o?er wide-spread seas we come.
Though not with much eclat , or beat of drum ;
True patriots all, for be it understood,
We left our country, for our country?s good:
No private views disgrac?d our generous zeal,
What urg?d our travels, was our country?s weal;
And none will doubt, but that our emigration
Has proved most useful to the British nation.
But, you inquire, what Could our breasts inflame*.
With this new passion for theatric fam^;
What, in the practice of our former dajrs,
Could shape our talents to exhibit plays ?
Your patience, Sirs, some observations made,
You?ll grant us equal to the scenic trade.
He, who to midnight ladders is no stranger,
You?ll own will make an admirable Ranger.
To seek Mackheatb we have not far to roam,
And sure in Filch I shall be quite at home.
Unrivalled there-, none will dispute my claim
To high pre-eminence and exalted fame.
As oft on Gadshill we have ta?en our stand,
When ?tvvas so dark you could not see your hand,
Some true-bred Falstaff we may hope to start,
Who, when well-bolster?d, well will play Ins part.
The scene to vary, we shall try in time
To treat you with a little pantomime *
Here light and easy Columbines are found.
And well-tried Harlequins with us abound-;
From durance vile our precious selves to keep,
We often had recourse to th? flying leap;
To a black face have sometimes ow?d escape,
And Hounslow Heath has proved the worth of crape.
But how, you ask, can we e?er hope to soar
Above these scenes, and rise to tragic lore ?
Too oft, alas! we?ve forc?d th? unwilling tear,
And petrified the heart with real fear.
Macbeth, a harvest of applause reerj/,
For some of us, I fear, have murdered sleep:
His lady too with grace will sleep and talk,
Our females*have been us?d at night to walk.
Sometimes, indeed, so various is our art.
An actor may improve and mend his part;
� Give me ahorse,? bawls Richard, like a drone,
We?ll find a man would help himself to one.
Grant us your favour, put us to the test,
To gain your smiles we?ll do our very best;
And, without dread of future Turnkey Lockits,
Thus, in an honest way, still pick your pockets


THE EIGHT.
Round 1. The altitude'of Spring was very imposing. He
stood up to his man coolly and firmly. Carter seemed rather in
a jesting humour; arid smiled significantly, as much as to say
? I?ll take the pride out of you.? Carter first broke ground, hut
was scientifically stopped by Spring (applause). Sparring for
some minutes. Spring stopped one of Garter?s left handers,

look lacerated. Spring in high spirits went in, and Carter at
1 once closed. Spring?s head got under Carter?s arm, hut before
he could fib with effect, Spring threw him off by main strength
( u Well done, Spring summer?s a coming.?)
