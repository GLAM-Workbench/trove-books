DIGEST
OF THE
BATTLE OF WATERLOO
/ ? v^s
yi m e. The Battle of Waterloo was fought on Sunday, the
18th of June, a.d. 1815. The engagement was commenced by
the French at 11.30 a m., and raged with increasing fury until
9 o?clock p m., when the entire French army was defeated and
broken up in tumultuous flight. Blucher?s Prussian cavalry
pursued the defeated army the greater part of the night, but all
effective resistance was over at the hour named.
? 1
Place. ?Waterloo is the name of a small village ten miles
south of Brussels, the capital of Belgium, on the great paved
highway running from Brussels to Charleroi, a town on the
northern border of France. It was from Waterloo that Wel-
lington, the night following the battle, sent his despatches
announcing the victory, and at once the English newspapers
adopted ? Waterloo? as the name of the battle. As a matter of
fact, however, the battle was fought in the immediate vicinity of
Mont St. Jean, a little hamlet two miles south of Waterloo, on
the same highway. With greater propriety the French his-
torians for a long time called this action the Battle of Mont St.
Jean.
The Armies. ?The battle was feught between the French
on one side, and the Allies on the other.
Of the troops actually participating in the battle, the French
numbered 71,947, including 16,000 cavalry and 246 cannons
They were commanded by Napoleon,


The Allies consisted of a portion of Blucher?s Prussian Army,
of which 51,944, including 9000 cavalry and 104 cannon were
engaged; and the Anglo-Dutch army, under Wellington,
numbering 67,661, including 12,500 cavalry and 156 cannon.
The Prussian force, above-mentioned, did not take part in any
considerable numbers until 6 o?clock p.m., so that it may be
fairly said that Wellington?s army bore the brunt of the actual
struggle. On the other hand, at 1 o?clock p.m., Napoleon was
compelled to detach 16,000 men to guard his flank against the
approach of the Prussians, leaving Wellington?s army numerically
the stronger during the greater part of the afternoon.
Something, however, must be allowed for the character of
Wellington?s troops. Napoleon?s ?Grand Army? was one of the
best that this great warrior ever commanded. It was largely
composed of veterans who had provoked the mingled fear and
admiration of all Europe through long years of distinguished
achievement. Even the more recent organizations had seen
sufficient service to fairly entitle them to the reputation of
soldiers; and the whole army was armed and equipped with
everything which the best science of war could require. They
were C* 3ne tongue under one commander, and were burning with
enthusiasm.
Wellington?s army, on the contrary, was a nondescript aggre-
gation of troops, speaking several languages, and, for the most
part, |uite unused to battle. Of the entire force, only 25,000
were British, and many of these were but recently enlisted.
The rest of the army was composed of Hanoverians, Bruns-
wickers, Nassauers, and Dutch-Belgians. The latter had been
suspected of treachery, and many of them, both at Quatre Bras
and Waterloo, justified the ill opinion entertained of them by
their commander. Writing to Lord Castlereagh a few days
before the battle, Wellington said : ?We are in a bad way! I
have got an infamous army?very weak and ill-equipped, and a
very inexperienced staff.?
But the event proved how strangely the ? Iron Duke? had
under-estimated the temper and capacity of his men, especially of


the British. Every member of that '?inexperienced staff? was
killed or wounded on that bloody day, suffering and dying with
more than veteran heroism ; while of the rank and file it may be
said that, never before in the whole history of the warlike British
people did British soldiers behave with more of lofty courage and
steadfast endurance than they did at Waterloo?the day that
marks, and will probably mark for ever, the most splendid
achievement of British arms. Writing about it afterward,
Wellington said: ? I never saw British infantry behave so
well.?
Losses. ?The total losses of the Allies, including killed,
wounded, and missing, were 22,428. It is illustrative of the
heroic conduct of the British troops especially, that one out of
every four on the field was killed or wounded !
The French losses have never been accurately ascertained. A
moderate estimate puts killed, wounded, and prisoners at 30,000
men. They also lost all of their artillery and trains.
ANTECEDENT EVENTS.
On the 19th of October, a.d. 1813, Napoleon was terribly
defeated by the Allies at Leipsic. They pursued him into
France, took Paris, March 30th, 1814, and five days later
Napoleon gave up the struggle and abdicated the throne.
With singular magnanimity the Allies granted him the Island
of Elba as a sovereignty, with a large appanage from France \
But the restless ambition of Napoleon would not remain satis-
fied. Before ten months had passed he secretly left Elba with a
few followers, and landed in France March Ist, a.d. 1815.
The spell of his name was irresistible. The people rose every-
where to welcome him, and even the soldiers sent to resist his
advance abandoned the failing fortunes of Louis XVIIL, and
took service with Napoleon. Louis fled from his capital, and
within a month from Napoleon?s escape from Elba a hundred
guns fired from each of the fortresses throughout France,
announced to the startled sovereigns of Europe that the Corsican
adventurer was again an Emperor and a dangerous neighbour.


The Allies at once determined to raise an overpowering force,
and march upon France from all sides. Napoleon, after vainly
tendering peace, and seeing that war was inevitable, decided to
take the initiative, and with one of those swift movements,
characteristic of his genius he secretly and rapidly concentrated
his army behind his fortresses on the Belgian frontier in the
vicinity of his nearest enemies.
Of the Allied armies only those of Wellington and Blucher
were near him. They, in great doubt as to Napoleon?s objective
point, lay stretched out in posts and cantonments through
Belgium occupying a line nearly a hundred miles long. Napoleon?s
plan was to break through this thin line, roll the British and
Prussian armies apart, and defeat each in detail before the other
Allies could get into the field.
But, notwithstanding the more than ordinary secrecy with
which Napoleon veiled his movements, enough was known to
Wellington to put him upon his guard. Wellington and Blucher
rapidly drew closer together. Plans of co-operation were matured
between them, and with singular, almost prophetic prescience,
Wellington caused the field of Waterloo to be accurately mapped
a week before the battle.
Meanwhile Napoleon was now ready. His army was concen-
trated around Beaumont, 40 miles south of Wellington?s head-
quarters at Brussels. Leaving Paris on the 12th of June, in a
rapid ride of two days, the Emperor joined his enthusiastic army,
and before daylight on the 15th he began his forward movement.
The Battle of Waterloo cannot be intelligently dissected out
of that short, but bloody campaign, of which it was the culmina-
tion. Happily for our purpose that campaign is separable into
four simple parts included in four corresponding days?the 15th
16th, 17th, and 18th days of June, a.d. 1815.
June 15th? Napoleon?s Advance,
At 3 o?clock a.m. on this day Napoleon moved to the attack.
Immediately before him, the bridges over the Sambre at Charleroi
and Marchiennes were occupied by some brigades of Blucher?s


army under Zieten. Unexpected delays in the movements of
some of Napoleon?s divisions, together with the stubborn resistance
of the Prussians, so retarded Napoleon that it was noon before he
had secured a passage of the river. Even then Zieten, to gain
time for a more perfect junction of the Allies, contested every mile
of ground, and the entire afternoon was consumed in a slow
advance of the French, stayed at intervals by sharp fighting
until 11 p.m., when darkness closed the conflict, and the trench
a: my bivouacked the left under Ney, facing a portion of
Wellington?s army at Quatre Bras, and the right under Napoleon,
in the presence of Blucher, near Ligny, six miles south-east of
Quatre Bras.
June 16th?Quatre Bras and Ligny.
On this day two battles were fought six miles apart, and com-
mencing at precisely the same hour?battles so fierce and fatal
that only the overshadowing horror of Waterloo made them seem
inconsiderable.
The Battle of Quatre Bras.? Quatre Bras, 13
miles north of Charleroi and 7 south of Waterloo, is a small
hamlet located at the ? four roads,? where the Nivelles and
Brussels roads cross each other, making a strategic position of
great importance to the Allies. This point was oceupied on the
night of the 15th by some of Wellington?s Dutch-Belgians, under
command of the Prince of Orange.
Ney, with 20,000 troops, had been ordered by Napoleon to
?seize this place, and engage Wellington, while Napoleon himself
should deal with Blucher at Ligny. Failure to get his troops up
delayed Ney?s attack, and it was not until 2.30 p.m. that the battle
opened.
Throughout the afternoon the conflict was one of increasing
violence. Wellington hurried reinforcements southward from
Brussels, and Ney northward from Frasne. In the earlier part^


of the battle the Allies were sadly outnumbered. The Dutch-
Belgians gave way, and victory seemed assured to the French
when just at the crisis the red coats of Sir Thomas Picton?s
division of British infantry appeared upon the field and succored
Wellington?s imperilled fortunes. Picton?s personal conduct was
fairly illustrative of that of his men. Although severely wounded
in the action, he concealed his injuries from his troops, and at the
head of his command fiercely charged the enemy again and
again.
At 9 p.m., Ney, defeated, fell back to the heights of Frasne,.
and sent for reinforcements.
The loss of the Allies was 3500 killed and wounded, of whom
two-thirds were British. The French loss was 4300 killed and
wounded.
The Battle Of Ligny. ?At the same hour (2.30 p.m,)*
that Ney opened the battle at Quatre Bras, Napoleon attacked
Blucher at Ligney. The French numbered 72,000, the Prussians
about 84,000; but the superior numbers of the Prussians were
more than an offset by their inferior training. Fully half of
Blucher?s troops were mere landwehr, and of his regulars a lar<re-
part were recently enlisted.
The fighting, however, was desperate. The stone houses of St.
Am and and Ligny afforded the Prussians a strong defence, and
Blucher, whose courage and resolution had already earned him
the title of ?Marshal Vorwarts,? plucked new honours at Ligny.
Although seventy-three years old, this stern, silent, old soldier 1
the prototype of Yon Moltke-exhibibited more than youthful
valour and energy. No quarter was given upon either side, and
for hours the fighting was hand to hand along the streets and in
the houses of Ligny. But the French were slowly gaining ground,
and at 8 p.m. Blucher led a desperate charge to cover the & retreat
of his array. His horse was killed under him, and the old hero,
disabled by the fall, was with difficulty saved from the swords of
the French cavalry. At 11 o?clock p.m. the Prussians were in
full retreat Blucher?s loss was 12,000, that of Napoleon 8000.
&o ended the 16th of June.

June 17?The Race to Waterloo.
The double confusion of defeat and darkness did not wholly
demoralise the Prussians. Gneisenau succeeded Blucher in
command, and with wonderful coolness and sagacity directed the
retreat on Wavre, the nearest practicable route to Waterloo.
Doubt, darkness, rain, muddy roads and the exhaustion of his
troops dissuaded Napoleon from pushing the retreating Prussians.
At daylight he made another fatal mistake. Supposing that the
Prussians would naturally fall back eastward on Liege, their base
of supplies, Napoleon sent Grouchy with 30,000 men to pursue
in that direction, and hours passed before the French general
ascertained his mistake. Instead of retreating eastward, the
Prussians had gone north, and at daylight had got together
again in tolerable order at Wavre, 14 miles away. Blucher was
again in the saddle, and, detaching a divison under Thielmann to
engage Grouchy, should that general threaten to overtake his rear,
was pushing on. It was a race with empires for the stakes j
Napoleon was swiftly marching to join Ney, and fall upon
Wellington. Blucher, with a full knowledge of the peril, was
hastening to respond to Wellington?s urgent summons for help,
and was floundering on through deluges of rain and almost
impassable swamps toward Waterloo. ? Forward! Forward !? he
cried; ? I have promised Wellington.? In the meantime, late in
the morning, Wellington had tardily learned of the disaster that
had befallen the Prussians at Ligny the evening before. Sending
word to Blucher to meet him at Waterloo, 7 miles north of Quatre
Bras, Wellington himself, at 10 o?clock a.m., began to fall back in
that direction. The elements favoured his retreat. Just as
Napoleon, who had now joined Ney, was in overwhelming
numbers, deploying to attack, a terrific thunderstorm broke over
the field, accompanied with blinding sheets of rain. In a few
minutes the ground was so saturated that artillery and cavalry
could move only on the paved Brussels road. The friendly storm
continued all the afternoon, and it,together with the stubborn fight-
ing of his rear-guard, enabled the British general to move off
without serious loss; and at with the French army lying


only a mile south of him, Wellington?s tired troops lay down in
line among the dripping barley-fields of Mont St. Jean.
? Night and morning were at meeting
Over Waterloo ;
Cocks had sung their earliest greeting,
Faint and low they crew,
For no paly beam yet shone
On the heights of Mount Saint John ;
Tempest-cloud prolonged the sway
Of timeless darkness over day ;
Whirlwind, thunder-clap, and shower
Marked it a predestined hour.
Broad and frequent through the night
Flashed the sheets of levin-light;
Muskets gleaming lightning?s back
Showed the dreary bivouac,
Where the soldiers lay,
Chill and stiff, and drenched with rain.
Wishing dawn of morn again,
Though death should come with day !?
Scott.
June 18th? The Battle of Waterloo.
We have reached sacred ground! History has seized and
consecrated it for ever to Valour and Liberty. This field has been
made immortal in the memories of men?a landmark in the
history not only of Europe, but of the world. For three-fourths
of a century the pen has been busy recording what the sword
there performed, and the minds of new generations still gather
around the field of Waterloo with unabated interest. In that
small plat of earth nothing is commonplace or inconsiderable.
The broken and rusty pieces of shells, guns, swords, and armour,
the significant mementoes of that fierce struggle in which
empires perished and were born, have been carefully gleaned from
the field where they lay and placed in museums. Enduring
monuments mark the salient places where the waves of battle
rolled highest, and broke wildest. Every house, hillock, ditch,
and hedge of that little Belgian neighbourhood, made eminent by
its part in the conflict, has taken its place with the names of
classic history, and all around the world Hougoumont and La Haye
Sainte are spoken of with Marathon and Thermopylae.
To understand the battle one must know something at least of
the ground upon which it was fought, and we may profitably
spend a few words in a hasty survey of the field.


On the gieat highway running due south from Brussels to
Charleroi, 12 miles south of Brussels, is the village and farm of
Mont St. Jean. At this point an irregular ridge of no great
height crosses the road from ep.st to west. This ridge was occu-
pied by Wellington. Three-fourths of a mile south of it is
another somewhat higher ridge crossing the road in the same
general direction, This was occupied by Napoleon. Two ridges
running east and west, nearly parallel to each other, and three-
fourths of a mile apart, Wellington on the northern ridge facing
south, Napoleon on the southern ridge facing north?that is the
situation.
Between these ridges lies an irregular valley, a thousand yards
wide and nearly three miles long, marked and dotted with farm-
houses, orchards, groves, and hedges, but mainly lying open
and covered with a rank growth of rye and barley just ready for
harvest.
A tremendous artillery duel between these opposing ridges, mad
charges and counter charges across this valley, and a final death-
grapple on the plateau of Mont St. Jean, the centre of the
northern ridge. This was the Battle of Waterloo.
The rain had ceased before daylight, but the sky was still over-
cast with clouds. Unaware that Blucher had escaped from
Grouchy, and was marching to reinforce Wellington, Napoleon
waited some hours to allow the ground to dry, so that he might more
effectually manoeuvre his artillery and cavalry. It was perhaps a
necessary, but still a fatal delay. At length the supreme moment
came. At precisely 11.30 a.m. Napoleon?s batteries opened, and the
dance of Death began.
Happily for the student a few principal lines of action run
through the wild welter of this battle, and serve to simplify what
would otherwise be almost unintelligible.
The Battle of Waterloo may be regarded as a terrible drama
in five great acts, corresponding to Napoleon?s five attacks on the
position held by the Allies.


First Attack?Hougoumont.
Standing under the ?Wellington Tree? at Mont St. Jean, with
his back to the north, the spectator looks down in the valley
south-west of him, and sees the strong post of Hougoumont 1200
yards away. It consists of a farmhouse and a number of out-
buildings, disposed in a square, and connected with each other by
brick and stone walls, so as to form a small rectangular court,
penetrated by a gate and several doors. The farmhouse is joined
immediately on the south by an old Flemish chateau, which also
had its enclosed court. In the rear was a garden, surrounded by
a. strong, high brick wall. South of these buildings was a small
wood, and east an apple orchard of about four acres.
This advanced post was seized by Wellington before daylight,
and hastily prepared for defence. The walls of the houses, courts,
and garden were loopholed f�r musketry, and scaffolds were built
in the garden to enable the troops to fire over the top of the
enclosure. Hougoumont was defended by the 2nd Brigade of
Guards and two light companies of the Ist Brigade, about 1500
men in all, commanded by Sir John Byng, who disposed his force
as follows :?The light companies of the Coldstream and Third
Guards, under Lieut. Col. McDonell, occupied the houses and
garden. Those of the Ist Regiment occupied the little wood
under Lieut. Col. Saltoun, the remainder of the command being
held in reserve 200 yards in the rear of Hougoumont.
It was against this little band of heroes that Napoleon aimed
his first terrific blow. At 11.30 a.m. Napoleon opened on the
Allied centre with 120 guns under cover, of which Reille?s 2nd
Corps, consisting of the three divisons of Foy, Bachelu, and
Prince Jerome, moved across the valley against Hougoumont ?
and soon the sharp rattle of musketry announced that the great
battle had come to short range.
The Anglo-Dutch troops were quickly driven out of the wood
and orchard, but the British, paying heavy toll to Death, clung
tenaciously to their riven walls hour after hour. In vain Reille
pushed column after column against those flaming walls. In
vain the French infantry, with a gallantry no whit inferior to


that of the devoted defenders, pressed in ever-increasing numbers
to the assault. Once the Frenchmen succeeded in bursting in the
gate that led into the enclosed farmyard, and rushed in with loud
cries of ? Vive VJEmpereur /? but the undismayed Britons, heavier
and stronger than their assailants in a hand-to-hand struggle with
swords and bayonets, flung them out and barred the gate again.
In the middle of the afternoon Napoleon, chagrined by his losses,
concentrated an artillery fire upon Hougoumont. A haystack in
the farmyard ignited, the flames rapidly spread to the buildings,
and the hardly-pressed heroes within were compelled to contend
with flame and smoke, as well as the shots of their enemies.
But their valour was unconquerable. Death and wounds codld
diminish, but not daunt them; and, like wearied, panting bull-
dogs they held on, mangling while they bled !
Both sides received reinforcements at intervals during the
afternoon, and while the fight raged into terrible importance else-
where, it never wholly ceased at Hougoumont until 8 p.m,, when
the battle was dosing everywhere. Nor did it materially change
its aspects. A determined attack upon those walls and a
desperate defence continued until night came, and the French
rolled back, leaving the sadly-thinned but triumphant ranks of
the British still holding the post, which was the monument of
their valour. Over 800 of Wellington?s men and 4000 of
Napoleon?s suffered wounds or death at this historic spot. The
importance which was attached to the defence of Hougoumont is
attested by this expression in Lord Dudley?s Letters ?This
Belgian yeoman?s garden-wall was the safeguard of Europe, and
the destiny of mankind, perhaps, turned upon the possession of his
house!?
Second Attack?La Haye Sainte.
Let the spectator again look south from Wellington s Tree, and
he will see near the foot of the slope, 275 yards away, the farm
of La Haye Sainte. It is close upon the western side of the
Brussels-road, and presents a brick farmhouse and a number of
outhouses, connected by walls, arranged around a rectangular


court like that at Hougoumont. South of the house was an
orchard, surrounded by hedges of dwarf-beech and holly, The
eastern wall of the buildings was extended 200 feet north to
protect a garden which lay in its rear, and the other sides of
which were fenced by a hedge. Though much inferior to Hougou-
mont in size and strength, La Haye Sainte was of supreme
importance from its location on the Brussels-road, and its near-
ness to Wellington?s centre. Wellington occupied this post also
on the night of the 17th, Col. Baring, with 400 men from the
2nd Light Battalion of the King?s German Legion, was deputed
to hold the houses, while a short distance north, behind some
hedges, Picton?s division lay in line east of the road, and Alton?s
Division west of it.
It was 1.80 p.m. when Napoleon struck at La Haye Sainte ; it
was to be the grand movement of the day. By it Napoleon
planned to break the British centre, thrust a wedge between
Wellington and Blucher, now known to be advancing, roll the
former westward away from the Brussels-road, and cut off his line
of retreat. The preparation was commensurate with the purpose.
Twenty-five thousand troops, including a division of Kellerman?s
cavalry, all under the command of Count D?Erlon, were assigned
the task. While the battle-storm was raging at Hougoumont, this
magnificent body of men was formed in the valley, and 74 pieces
of artillery were brought to within 250 yards of La Haye Sainte ;
and, at the hour mentioned, they opened furiously on the farm-
houses and Picton?s division. Covered by this terrible cannonade,
D?Erlons? infantry pressed on in columns to the attack; while
from the head of each column the light troops detached them-
selves, and spread out in an open line of skirmishers extending
from La Haye Sainte to Papelotte, 1200 yards east. With loud
shouts of ? Vive VEmpereur !? the assaulting force closed in, and
the cries of contestants were lost in the indescribable roar of
small arms. Ney, who had brought a brigade across from Hougo-
mout, struck Baring?s brave little band at La Haye Sainte, emit-
ting such a storm of musketry that these devoted men were soon
driven out of the orchard and garden, leaving their dead and
dying as a testimony of their valour.


But Baring?s men were veterans. They had fought under
Wellington on the Peninsula, and were seasoned by fire. Driven
from the garden and orchard, like their comrades at Hougoumont,
they threw themselves into the buildings and courtyard, piled-up
logs and stones to block the entrances, and kept up such a rain of
bullets that their enemies could not dislodge them. Unable to
loosen Baring?s grip on the buildings, the French commander left
a force to continue the struggle, and with the main body swept on
past toward Mortt St. Jean. At this supreme moment Bylandt?s
Brigade of Dutch Belgians, posted in front of Pictoti?s left, dis-
ordered by the French Artillery fire, and terrified by the near
approach of the French Infantry, gave way, and retreated in
confusion over the brow of the hill. Thus Picton?s Division,
depleted by heavy losses at Quatre Bras, and now numbering
only 3671 men, was left to stem the attack of 13,000 Frenchmen.
But they Were men capable of meeting such an emergency.
Long before in the Peninsular War they had earned the title of
? Picton?s Fighting Division,? and on this day they were destined
to add new honor* to the old. Concealing his men in the tall
grain, and behind a hedge, Picton waited until the French were
within 30 yards, and then poured into them a terrific sheet of
fire. Staggered by the volley, and impeded by the hedge, the
attacking column deflected toward the east. Quick to see his
advantage, Picton rose in his stirrups, and shouted: ?Anothei
volley, and then charge!? Delivering their fire as commanded
his men struggled through the hedge, and rushed upon their
enemies with the bayonet. In five minutes the French were
falling back, and victory seemed assured, when a new crisis arose
The retreat of the Dutch-Belgians had left a gap in Picton?s line
between Kemp?s and Pack?s brigades ; and through this opening
another column of French infantry poured toward the coveted
heart of Wellington?s line at Mont St. Jean. Picton was dead
shot through the forehead with a musket-ball as he led his men
through the hedge. His division, confused by the rapidity of their
charge, now perceived the enemy triumphantly penetrating their
Une, while they were not in a situation to form a new front. For


a few moments the fate of the whole battle hung trembling in
the balance! But at that moment Wellington?s hand fell hvavily
on the British side of the scales. For some time he had been on
the heights in the rear of Hougoumont watching the battle there,
but he had not failed to notice the French advance on La Haye
Sainte, and at the crucial moment he galloped along the ridge to
his imperilled centre, and ordered his only available reserves to
charge. These reserves were Lord Uxbridge?s cavalry, the
Household Brigade under Lord Edward Somerset, and the Union
Brigade under Sir William Ponsonby. Uxbridge himself led the
way at the head of the Household Brigade. At a smart gallop
the Households swept down the slope, and in a moment collided
with Roussel?s Cuirassiers, who had passed the French infantry,
and were making for the British batteries, It was wild work.
Swords flashed and fell, and at arm?s length the furious combat
went on, man to man, horse to horse, officers and men without
distinction. The French cavalry had the advantage of longer
swords and the protection of steel cuirasses, but the British
wedged themselves into the ranks of their enemies, getting a
shorter sword-stroke, and bringing to bear the superior weight of
their men and horses. Desperate and bloody as was the struggle,
it was of brief duration. In this, as in every other hand-to-
hand conflict that day, the superior valour and strength of the
Britons decided the victory. In a few minutes the French horses
were broken, and retreated down the hill which they had
ascended with such confidence. Further east the French cavalry,
disordered by crossing a sunken road previously unnoticed by
them, were struck by Somerset?s dragoons, and were also swept
away.
Meantime, Ponsonby?s Brigade had the more difficult task of
dealing with a column of infantry quick set with bayonets; but
the Royals Iniskillings and Scots Greys were capable of anything
that soldiers could do. A heavy volley from the French emptied
many of their saddles, but did not stay their onset. With a wild
cheer the British horsemen rushed in among their enemies,
thrusting and slashing with lightning strokes, and in half-an-hour

Fsued the fleeing foe down
past La Haye Sainte, out into the valley; and the Scots Greys,

an overwhelming force of cuirassiers and lancers. They escaped
to their own lines after heavy losses, including the brave General
Ponsonby and Col. Hamilton.*
*The spectator at the Cyclorama may see this
furious charge splendidly shown at the middle
distance in the low, swampy ground, just over the
brow of the hill, to the south-east, and between
Napoleon and Papelotte.
Napoleon?s second attack had lasted a full hour, and had
exacted a terrible tribute of blood from both sides, but at 3.30
p.m. it had utterly failed,
Attack on British Centre?Fall of
La Haye Sainte.
Napoleon, not discouraged by these repulses, now prepared for
fresh onset that should break the British centre and sweep the
plateau of Mont St. Jean. He directed Pire, under Prince
Jerome, to shell the chateau of Hougoumont, and otherwise
menace the British right with a view to induce Wellington to
weaken his centre by detachment to the right. The shells soon
set fire to Hougoumont, consuming the chateau, and many of the
wounded who had been carried thither for shelter perished by the
flames, but neither the flames nor the shot shook the consistency
of the brave defenders. The Duke not to be led astray by these
manceuvers, contented himself by sending a brigade of light horse,
under Grant, to watch the Frenchmen.
At about this time* Napoleon sent forward, in two columns, a
combined body of Donzelot and Quiet?s divisions to storm and

Sainte was taken. The Duke of Wellington fixes the time at about two,

carry the so far impregnable La Haye Sainte. Gallant men among
them, axe in hand, strove to break in the great barn door on the
Charleroi Road, while others sought to carry (he gateway on the
opposite side. Shot down or beaten off they fell back to the orchard
and thence renewed the attack. Twice they were compelled to draw
off; twice they set the buildings on fire, but as often was it ex-
tinguished by the courageous Germans. Major Baring had been
twice reinforced, but his men fell fast, and his amunition grew
scarcer every shot; while further support was cut off by the
French calvary.
As the fire of their enemy slackened, the French grew bolder,
they broke through the door into the courtyard, they climbed upon
the roofs of the buildings, and poured a murderous fire down upon
the resolute defenders. Quite cut off from the army, over-
whelmed by numbers, and their amunition expended, resistance
was no longer possible. The French with shouts of victory
battered down the gates and doors, shot and bayonetted all except
the mere handful of Germans who were fortunate enough to
escape over the wall and through the wheat field to (he ridge.
The French had gained a great advantage, but at a great cost.
Grand Cavalry Attack.*
*This assault of the French Cavalry upon the
hollow squares of the English Infantry has very
happily been chosen as the feature of the Cyclorama.
The conception is grand, and the execution of it is
well nigh faultless.
Annoyed by the stubborn resistance of the British infantry,
Napoleon now determined to carry the heights of Mont St. Jean
by a grand cavalry charge.
Twelve thousand horses, the largest and best equipped body of
mounted men that ever charged on a field of modern Europe, were
drawn out for this purpose, and committed to the fiery genius of
Marshal Ney.
Half-an-hour had been consumed in preparing this movement, but,
at precisely 4 p.m. the avalanche was loosed. As before, a tremen-

dous artillery fire played oyer tlie heads of the advancing columns.
All the way from La Haye Sainte to Hougoumont a great tide
of waving plumes and uplifted sabres moved straight at the British
centre, ?Key?s splendid cavalry rushing to the charge !
Gradually accelerating their speed, they broke into a gallop as
they neared the crest of the ridge, and dashed into Loyd?s and
Cleve?s batteries, which had played upon them all the way across the
valley. The guns, twelve in all, were captured, and with fierce
cries the French thundered on to attack the British infantry
supports. But Wellington?s men were ready. They had been
fiastily formed into thirteen hollow squares, the officers inside.
Key?s horsemen dared everything, and feared nothing. They rushed
madly upon those fire-fringed squares, and firing their pistols in the
faces of their stubborn foes, flung them away, and hacked with their
swords at the bristling bayonets with wild ferocity. It was Death?s
saturnalia ! Scores fell on both sides for every strenuous second that
passed, but the infantry stood fast. In vain the French rode around and
around those blazing squares, and even leaped their horses into the
centre of some of them. It was only to perish among their enemies.
Human courage and endurance have their limits, and soon scattered
and broken, the French horse fell back. Yet thrice more Key re-
inforced and reformed his cavalry, and hurled them on the British
squares, refusing to accept defeat ; and thrice more did Wellington?s
invincible battalions meet them as the cliff meets the tide. At
5.30 p.m. the tide receded, and left the squares still standing among
the wreckage of death.
Notwithstanding the florid French accounts to the contrary,
nothing is historically more certain than the fact that not one of the
British squares was finally broken in that charge. The fourth attack
had failed.
By this time detached bodies of French were assaulting the whole
of Wellington?s line from Hougoumont to Fapelotte ; but dangerous
as they were to Wellington?s weakened force, the assaults were
desultory in their nature, and need not be followed here.


Last Attack?The Old Guard Dies.
The British batteries were, many of them, disabled, and
their defenders fearfully reduced. One more charge might win
everything. Ney gathered up all the stragglers, but sent to
Napoleon for more infantry before making what he knew must be
a last effort. Unfortunately, Napoleon could not respond at
once, it was G p.nv, Bulow?s corps of the Prussian army had
arrived upon the field, and were moving upon Napoleon?s right
flank and rear. The danger was too great to be disregarded, and
the Emperor detached Lobau with 10,000 men to drive the
Prussians back, or at least to hold them in check. Having pro-
vided as best he could for the new danger, he turned to deliver
the last attack.
Matters were now desperate with both Wellington and Napo-
leon. So evenly did the balance hang, it seemed as though th�
weight of a straw might determine the victory. Napoleon knew
that with the Prussians coming in upon his flank in ever-increas-
ing numbers, he could not afford to try any dilatory movements.
The crisis was at hand. He must hurriedly crush Wellington,
and drive him from the field before the remainder of the Prussians
could arrive.
It was t p.m., and twilight was approaching, when Napoleon
ordered a general advance of all troops previously engaged, and,
in addition, threw in his priceless veterans, the Imperial Guard.
Ney led them, and in that last hour of the Empire they justified
the fame which they had won in many previous battles. But the
die of their destiny had been cast, and was against them and
their Master. \V ith sublime courage and steadiness they breasted
the savage artillery fire that decimated them as they ascended the
fatal plateau. A final blast from Napier?s battery withered the
head of the column, but they pressed on and seized the guns.
The victory seemed won ! The French veterans could see no
enemy in their immediate front, but a few officers in cocked hats
sitting on their horses a little way off. One of these was Wel-
lington, and at his feet, concealed in the tall grain, lay Maitland?s


I ? % S : ! s

I* * *
Brigade of British infantry ; and, as the French came on with
levelled bayonets, suddenly the Iron Duke?s voice rang out: ?Up
Guards, and at them!? Springing up apparently out of the
ground, Maitland?s men poured in a volley at short range that
struck down 300 of their assailants at a blow, and then dashed
upon their staggering column with the bayonet. Napoleon?s old
soldiers struggled heroically for awhile, but the white fury of the
British bore down all before them. Maitland and Saltoun charged
them home, and they were defeated, A second column further
east shared the same fate. Wasted by the British Artillery, they
reached the top of the ridge, only to be charged by the impetuous
Oolborne, and driven back with terrible slaughter.
The defeat of the Imperial Guard now quickly extended to the
whole French army, and in a moment it began to crumble away
in retreat. Napoleon in person rallied some of the Old Guard in
the valley, and sought to stay the tide of British success, but in
rain. The Prussians broke through Lobau?s line, Wellington
ordered a general advance, the field was swept, and at 10 o?clock
p.m. Wellington and Blucher clasped hands in mutual congratula-
tions at Genappe, four miles in rear of the position held by
Napoleon in the morning.
Napoleon?s star had set. His army, under the furious pursuit
of the Prussians, had ceased to exist before daylight. And what
was Napoleon without an army 1 Only the jealous, fretful,
impotent prisoner of St Helena !

HOW CYCLOKAMAS ARE PRODUCED.
The general public can have but a vague idea of the methods
employed, or the vast amount of labor necessary to create and set
for view a great Oyclorama.
In the space alloted, the writer can give in outline only some
of the means employed, and the successive steps as they are taken
in the work.
A battle Cycloram a, to be a success, must be true to nature,
true to history, a complete and harmonious whole. It must be
spirited, every figure must be doing something, and doing it well
to use an Americanism, there must be plenty of ? go? in it. The
landscape should be like ? holding a mirror up to nature.
The undertaking is one far too great to be done by any
one man. The best results are gained by the colaboration of a
dozen or more artists, each of whom is a specialist, trained and
-fitted for his respective work. There must be no jealousies, and
no favourites; but rather a willingness to unite for a common
purpose, and work as one man.
Those who know something of the sensitiveness of great artists,
their strong individualities, not to say eccentricities, may have
some conception of how dangerous and thorny is the path of the
directing artist, who for month after month supervises, arranges
and details the work as it progresses.
Preparatory Work.
The first duty of the leading artist is to exhaust the subject
chosen by close, careful study of all reliable history, a personal
inspection of the battle field, make or secure a topographical
survey of it. He must gather from the war archives and
museums the various implements of warfare used. He must
understand thoroughly the military tactics of the combatants,
and above all, have a genius for the work in hand.


From the ever shifting scenes, from the kaleidoscope of the
battle, some one view is chosen and the position of observation is
selected; this is known as the ? initial,' and it must be fixed upon
the field. From this point the artists now work. Sketches and
studies are made here from nature, the tones, values, atmospheric
effects are carefully noted.
The landscape is so photographed in sections, that by joining
the several prints (16) the entire horizon is shown. From these
prints, all objects such as houses, barns, or roads, placed there
subsequent to the battle, are removed. Buildings torn down and
trees cut away since the battle are restored. These photo prints
are carefully joined so as to show, without a break or overlap,
the entire landscape as seen from the ? initial.? The prints are
then ruled into squares of about one inch. These squares are
numbered from right to left, and lettered from the bottom to the top
These squares are referred to, as for example, G 74 or K 56.
The horizon line of the landscape of the cyclorama to be made
is fixed to be 20 feet from the bottom of the painting. The
leading landscape artist prepares a canvas 20ft. x 4ft. mounted up-
right, the top serving as the horizon of this study from nature.
Upon this he paints very carefully a small section of the landscape
(about degrees wide, and extending from the horiaon to the
u initial,?) this is the principal study, and known as ? The Key.?
The use of this will be explained hereafter.
The Work Begins.
A large canvas about 50 by 400 feet is carefully stretched in
a circular building just as you see it on exhibition, except there
is a tramway all around close to the canvas, upon which are
movable staging or carriages of different heights to enable the
artists to readily reach any part of the great canvas. This
canvas is lined off into squares, numbered and lettered to exactly
correspond to the squares of the photo prints, to which they
relate. The landscape artists draw in black with charcoal the
landscape as shown by the photo prints, being exceedingly careful
that every object is drawn to its proper scale, and placed


accurately in its particular square. This requires several months
time. When this is finished ?the key? already described is
brought out, and the top, or horizon of the key, is hooked into
the large canvas at its horizon. The key thus hung reaches the
bottom of the canvas, and shows at once the tones, inflections,
strength of shadows, character, and quantity of detail, etc.,
required to guide the artist in the use of his brush, whether he
be painting the delicate, hazy distance of the horizon, the sunny
fields of the middle distance, or the strong, rugged foreground at
jour feet.
The Composition of the Conflict.
So far has been given only the modus operandi of the landscape
artist. We shall now speak briefly of the work of composition,
a task far more arduous than anything else in the whole work-
The composer must conceive and create a > ideal conflict of mighty
proportions that shall fairly bristle with the spirit of the times
that must in a striking and realistic manner portray the mad
furious rush of war ; and yet, hardest of all, he must keep well
within the lines of authentic history that nothing inharmonious
or incongruous may appear. The composer must be a living
cyclopaedia upon the subject in hand; he must know all about it.
To assist him in his work, his associates have prepared a canvas
5 by 40 feet (being one-tenth the dimensions of the large canvas).
Upon this is carefully placed in water-color the entire landscape
one-tenth the required sire. This canvas is carefully laid out into
squares, and upon it the composition is made. Figures are drawn
in and rubbed out, again and again ; the work of weeks some-
times wiped out in a moment. To aid him, hundreds of instan-
taneous photographs are taken of men and horses in action and in
attitudes. It may be one time a dozen or more men in French
uniform charging an imaginary English battery, or the corner of
a hollow square, about to receive an onslaught from the Lancers j
or perhaps, a dying soldier being borne from the field by his
faithful comrades. When the composition has been satisfactorily
made (the reader can never realise what this means), the canvas


is photographed, and the prints are lined into squares properly
numbered and lettered, and from these figure the artists draw and
paint, d When the work upon the large canvas is completed, a
seam is opened from top to bottom. A large hollow, iron roller,
18 inches in diameter by 50 feet long, is mounted in a vertical
position at the side of one of the tallest carriages. The carriage
is moved along very slowly a few inches at a time, as the canvas is
loosened from its fastening at the top, and tightly wound upon
the roller. To roll the painting properly requires great care and
skill, and is not unattended with danger.
If all goes well, in five or six days the dozen trained men will
have the great painting rolled up and covered with waterproofing
material, boxed up and ready to be sent away to its destination,
where the operation of hanging the painting is similar to that of
rolling it up only the operation is reversed.
The Artists.
The Waterloo painting is by Monsieurs Sargeant and
Bertrand, two among the most prominent artists of Paris,
assisted by a corps of special artists selected by them from the
leading art centres of Europe. The hanging, setting, and
arranging of the foreground and effects was done by Paul
Wilhelmi, of Munich, 0. H. Collins, and Joseph P. Birrens, of
America, working under the personal supervision and direction
of Mr. Howard H. Gross.
The Waterloo Painting.
Unlike same histories of that great conflict, the Cyclorama is
non-partizan, and rigidly conforms to historic facts as given by
impartial historians. The artists have fairly caught the spirit of
the conflict, and with true and telling effect have spread upon the
great canvas, in a thrilling and wonderfully realistic scene, the
climax of this ? mightiest struggle of modern times,? at the
supreme moment when Napoleon hurls his entire cavalry, under


the furious leadership of Marshall Key, against the hollow squares
of British infanty, a scene caught and held, that the observer may
contemplate it at his leisure. The time required to produce and
?et the Oyclorama was something over two years.
Interchange of Paintings.
The proprietors of the Waterloo Oyclorama have placed in
Sydney, a splendid painting of the chief battle of the American
War ?Gettysburg. They have another painting, equally good,
of another splendid subject. As these paintings are on the same
scale, they may be readily shifted when desirable, and thus at
?mall expense, maintain the interest for many years to come.


Points of Interest?A Key to the
Painting.
The observer upon the platform, looking south-
ward, sees upon the knoll by the roadside the central
figure in the history of his time, Napoleon the
Great, surrounded by his staff. Some rods to his
left by the roadside is the farmhouse and garden of
La Haye Sainte, that has just been captured by the
French. Artistically, this is the gem of the canvas,
and is not approached by any similar bit of painting
in the world, unless it be a scene in the Cyclorama of
the Siege of Paris, now on exhibition in the French
capital. To the South, on the paved road in the
distance, is La Belle Alliance, Napoleon?s head-
quarters. A thousand yards south-west of La Haye
Sainte, the woods and burning buildings of Hougou-
mont stand out in bold relief. Directly west, and
just across the Brussels-road, lies the principal scene
G f interest, the charge of the French cavalry, under
Marshal Ney, upon the hollow squares of Wellington,
the nearest of which is the Highlanders, flanked by
the famous 52 nd and 95th. To the north, across
the road, near a clump of trees, is the ?Iron Duke,?
mounted upon his favourite horse, ? Copenhagen.?
Further up the road is the farm of Mont St. Jean,
Wellington?s head-quarters. Beyond this in the
distance is the Forest of Soignes, whose tall trees
limit the field of vision. To the eastward from
Wellington may be traced the English line of battle
along the Wavre-road. Batteries crown every

Conclusion
The proprietors trust that the reader will have
found this little work of assistance in making the
salient features of the mighty conflict of Waterloo
clear, the very vastness of the subject having made
the compilation in so small a space one of great
labor and difficulty.
The inclusion of the various maps and illus-
trations will be found of immense value in getting a
better and clearer understanding of the Campaign as
.a whole, and in this respect the book is superior to
any single work at the present time published
or obtainable.
The illustrations have been executed by Mr.
E. James McKaige, Draftsman and Wood Engraver,
of Modern Chambers, Collins Street, whose skill
and care in his w'ork the Proprietors desire to
acknowledge.
The Advertisements-
The business announcements of the leading firms
in their respective lines which are included, will

I. CRAWFORD BRADLEY, Esq.,
Dear Sir.
It affords me much pleasure to bear testimony to your ability as a
Curative Magnetist.?
Last November I had a very severe attack of ?English Cholera,? and
being an-old man (I am in my seventy-seventh year), I was reduced to a very
?weak state in a short time, but, thanks to your valuable gifts, I was
speedily restored to my usual health and strength, and have continued to
?enjoy the same up to the present time.
You are at liberty to make what use you may think fit of this letter, and
I shall be pleased to answer any enquiries made of me, either personally or by
letter, as 1 consider the possession of such power as you possess for the cure
of various complaints cannot be too widely known.
Very truly yours,
WILLIAM OVERTON.

I. CRAWFORD BRADLEY, Esq.
Dear Sir,
I have much pleasure in testifying to the efficacy of your treatment in my
case.
In September, 1888, I was suffering from general debility of the system,
accompanied by fainting and hysterical tits, of daily occurence. Previous to
placing myself under your treatment I had tried various remedies but received
no benefit from them.
My general health began to improve after the first treatment by you,
aaad after the third treatment the fainting and fits left me. Altogether I had
(8) eight treatments from you. at the end of which I was in the full enjoy-
ment of good health, and still continue so.
You are at liberty to make any use you see fit of this, as I consider it
to be my duty to make known to others who may be suffering, the means by
which I was restored to perfect health.
I know of others who have been similarly benefited by your magnetic
gift.
Yours truly,
EMMA FENTON.

. SPEECH OF .
the GLotmcj,= ( QjauoVvi/aV,
SIR WM. C. R ROBINSON,
( fyp/irn rfAe rr//Ae *io'y.r/#iaina J / y
From the 11 DAILY TELEGRAPH!
Sir William Robinson said he was so impressed with the
beauty of the scene that he could not refrain from expressing,
his admiration and appreciation of those gentlemen who had
brought it over to this city. It was one of most stirring in-
terest, and the way in which it was placed before them was
worthy of all credit. The atmospheric effect and manage-
ment of the distance was marvellously pourtrayed. The pro-
prietors were to be heartily congratulated for the manner in
which they had placed the Cyclorama before the public, rightly
judging that Australians, satisfied with nothing short of excellence,
would gladly appreciate the endeavour to cater for their require-
ments in the best possible manner. It was a happy circumstance
that one of the most eminent battlefields in the history of the
world should be the first picture presented for the instruction
of a colony that had done more in proportion to its size than
any other portion of Her Majesty?s dominions for its own defence;
and her efforts should be an incentive to other parts of the
Empire to do likewise. Certainly, there were scenes depicted
on this canvas which they were gazing on, if canvas it might
be, which would make them all wish for the happy time when
wars shall cease, and national differences be settled in a less
cruel manner; but that happy time had not yet come. Hence
it was well m looking at the past to learn a lesson for the future.
On his own account, and on behalf of the many thousands who
would visit this Cyclorama, he congratulated the gentlemen who
had provided this remarkably successful enterprise.
