PRE FACE.
Gold Mining Companies are divided into two
distinct classes:?
I. Those that have not, and never had any Mines
at all, but possess an unlimited imagination.
11. Those that have plenty of Mines, equally fertile
brains, but no Gold.
The first-mentioned Company issues its Prospectus
with this understanding- that if the public will en-
trust its Directors with a few millions sterling, those
kind gentlemen will do their best to spend the money
for them.
The second genus of Company is more reasonable,
but equally fantastic. It presents its Shareholders with
a few acres of mountainous land, ?ground which, but
for these ? auriferous ? rocks, might have been usefully
employed in the propagation of that delicious vege-


table the cabbage; and in return it charges its sub-
scribers such a thumping sum lor the stoney property,
that the price must inevitably ruin all engaged in the
undertaking, unless he be a Director, a Trustee, or an
Engineer.
The illustrated portion of this book deals only
with those Companies that have purchased Gold
Lands ?that have invested largely in granite or
quartz ?signed a long lease for a chain or two ol
precious crags and precipices. Their motto should
be ? Parturient montes nascetur ridiculus nugget.''
From the minute size of the metal realized in these
crushing undertakings, these schemes have been very
properly turned ? specs.? For experience has shown
us, that after much excavating, diligence, and patient
pounding, a moderately sized spangle is all these rich
deposits have yielded to the Shareholders.
Those Companies, whose Gold Mines exist merely
in the brains ?or rather pockets ?of the originators,
have been especially dealt with in the letter-press
part of this work. These schemes are said to be
vast undertakings , probably from the fact of the large
sums that are buried in them, and the general mourn-
ing that invariably follows their operations.


The ? victim ? who lias written and sketched the
pages of this book does not mean to assert that every
Gold Mining Company, started during the late popular
madness, was either in thought an imposition, or in
execution a robbery. He confesses that there were
honorable exceptions schemes commenced with
good promise of lucrative success, but choked up
and destroyed by the weedy ore-crushing societies
that sprang up in such fearful numbers around
them. Unfortunately such Companies as these were
as rare among Mining Speculations, as eight-legged
kittens are among animals, or ? General Tom
Thumbs ? among mortals.
Third Floor Bach, near Fusion Square.,
December , 1854.




The other day, as we were walking up and down in front
of the Royal Exchange, stretching our legs and munching a
biscuit, we could not help noticing the crowds of people that
were entering that huge cash box of England, the Bank.
Cabs and carriages drove up in quick succession, delivered
their happy cheque-bearing passengers, and then, submitting
to the mild sway of that magnificent, cleanly gentleman?
the bank beadle?took up their stand on the opposite side
of the road.
Sometimes it was a glass coach from Hackney, Clap-
ham, or Islington. As it drew up, there would jump out
from its ?neat? interior, a smirking lawyer, who, with a
tendefness, which no six-and-eight-pence could sufficiently
reward, would hand out the weazing body of the corpulent
lady, the fair client, who was to finger the glorious cash.
There were plenty of cabs, some of them Hansom?s, with
young fellows smoking cigars. How recklessly they threw
away the half-consumed havanna, as if they did not care for
money now they had reached the Bank. There were plenty


of four-wheel cabs too, hired by business-looking men, who
fought over the fare, and walked through the gate of that
town-residence of Plutus, as calmly as if they had apartments
there on the first floor. Occasionally a heavy swinging chariot,
drawn by fat-backed horses, dashed up to the entrance. Then
the magnificent beadle would rouse himself to do honour to the
rich visitor, and as the shining body of the carriage swung to
and fro on its easy springs, he himself would consent to open
the polished door and clatter down the carpetted steps. Then
a white hand, that looked as if it were accustomed to write
cheques to any amount, rested for a moment on the Bank
beadle?s livery, and a glossy round figure would disappear
through the gates, leaving behind a sound, as of sovereigns
being shovelled up in a copper scoop.
One thing we noticed, all those that went in came out again,
buttoning up their pockets and looking ten inches higher, and
prouder, and happier, than when they entered.
We could not help thinking to ourselves ? Where does all
the money come from that is hoarded up in that fortress of a
building ? Where does it go to ? To whom does it belong ?
If we could only peep into those lovely cellars, what bars of gold
should we see, piled up like the old iron in the wharves on the
river side. Then that sublime Printing Office, where each
turn of a wheel?the true wheel of fortune ?sends out a dozen
five pound notes ?crisp, tinkling, golden paper. Who would not
love to write for such a publisher ? O ! to edit one edition of
such lovely printing! O ! for one day?s work at that press; how
we would work, until our arms and legs smarted and ached
with the labor 1 ?
We turned away, for we felt a bitter hatred of the entire
world creep into our hearts. To distract our thoughts we reso-
lutely fixed our eyes upon the green shop of Mr. Birch, that
luscious soup manufacturer, and began to think of eating and


cold punch. Whilst we were theorizing, the door opened, and a
gentleman, whose waistcoat seemed to fit tightly, stepped on
to the pavement. He was smacking his lips loudly as a whip,
as though he were flogging his palate, to make it deliver up
the last flavour of the spiced turtle. He advanced slowly
towards us, flicking away the bread crumbs that had fallen
on to his crimson satin cravat. We were about to commence
an inward essay on gluttony, when we suddenly recognized in
that tight-waistcoated being, the plump body of a friend ?Mr.
Thomas Tiddler?a man whose bill has never known dishonor,
but always been taken up to a minute; a gentleman who,
although commercially he has never yet been noted, is yet
not entirely unknown to fame, as we shall very soon explain
to you.
Tom informed us ? that there was no money in the City;
that he had never known the market to be so tight?it was as
if men fastened up their pockets with patent locks.?
When a thinking creature has been standing for half an
hour before the walls of the Bank of England, such assertions
as these sound idiotic and impertinent; we looked upon what
he said with a kind of wall eye, and merely pointed towards
that classic building; we allowed our sermon to be spoken by
the stones themselves.
?Money there!? answered Tom, ?Yes! there?s plenty of
money there. But they won?t speculate; they belong to the
tight ones. ? And he sighed as though he would have blown
the brains out of the Board of Directors, and then coaxed
them into one of his new schemes for fortune making.
� Can you tell us,? we asked, ? what becomes of all the
gold locked up like a big toad?in that rock of a place ?
He laughed! Such a laugh ! Each giggle came bubbling
up through his throat, like the jerks of some monster linnet.
He could not speak, but he thrust his hand into his pocket and


pulled forth a paper, folded up like a barrister?s brief, and
handed it to us.
We read the printed title?it was as follows:
GREAT TANKARD
GOLD AND PEWTER IMPERIAL QUARTZ CRUSHING,
SMASHING, AND CRASHING COMPANY.
? That?s where some of it went! ? said Tom, pulling up his
laughter, and finishing it off with a cough.
We knew nothing about these Gold Companies beyond
having read the long advertisements in the morning papers, and
wondered at them. We had sometimes imagined to ourselves
the fearful sums these announcements cost, and indeed we had
once entered into a kind of rule of three sum, after this fashion:
? If an advertisement for a maid of all work cost three-and-
six, what would two columns of a Gold Company come to??
But beyond gratifying our curiosity, it did not signify to us
what the sum might be that had been paid over the counter
of the Times Office.
But now that we held in our hand this Prospectus, a
species of madness came upon us to know something more
about these speculations. It is very strange, the peculiar?the
almost magical?effect, that word ? Gold ? has upon all men.
Suppose any one was to stand in Cheapside, at that period of
the day when it is most crowded; and that he were to call
each passer by ? a scoundrel,? how many would stop ? but let
him simply utter the word ? Gold,? and in a second he would
be surrounded; people would flock round him and ask ? How ?
and where??


Tom saw that a powerful emotion had seized upon us ; our
eyes grew larger, we bit our lips, and the blood was mounting
to our cheeks. We held in our hand the prospectus of the
? Great Tankard,? and it seemed to us as if the prolific mines
it so powerfully described, were our property. It made us
feel rather sick and uneasy.
? That?s where some of tire money went,? he continued,
pointing to the paper, ? Capital �2,000,000 ! rather a large
sum to invest in spades and pickaxes, is?nt it ? Ah! we shall
never have another f Great Tankard ! ? ?there?s no money in
the city!?
We again looked at the Bank; lie saw us, and taking our
arm, dragged us away. We felt relieved by the exertion of
walking, it seemed to jolt our brains into their proper place,
as shaking sometimes sets a watch working.
He led us to a city luncheon-room close by, and ordering
a pint of sherry?even that looked like Gold ! ?began as
follows:
? When I say there is no money in the city, I am not speaking
of those rich old fellows in Lombard Street. Of course they
have lots of cash; if they liked they could cover all London with
their Gold; spread the streets with it like gravel. But they
are all after the same game as myself. We want your small
men ?your men with their three hundred pounds?men who
have saved up their little amounts ?they are the kind of
gold-fish that we like to see in our nett profits.?
As we had saved up a little amount we listened atten-
tively.
? What a wonderful thing eight per cent is!? continued Tom!
<e what would become of us if it was?nt of that blessed profit ?
How many poor fools have parted with all they possess, merely
in the hopes of increasing it by an annual five pounds ! They
throw out their mackerels to catch sprats, poor things! We


have used them up now, at least for a week or two; hut bless
you there are lots of them still. They?ll come ! they?ll come !
or my name is not Tom Tiddler.?
?You see if it was?nt for us Adventurers the world would
grow too rich; every body would be keeping a banker?s
account. Don?t believe in the saying that money makes
money; it does?nt, money ruins people ; it only makes fools,?
?Now there was old Careful, a man well to do in the world,
who could afford to have his soup and fish for dinner, every day
of his life, and his glass of port wine afterwards. How did he
lose it all ? Why his wife read one of our advertisements.
Instantly she was seized with a golden delirium. For three
nights running she dream?t of a one-horse shay. She longed
to eat game after her soup and fish. She literally dragged old
Careful up to the ? Great Tankard ? office, and then we took
him in hand.?
? Gold, like water, will always find its level; a few hundreds
may get out of the right channel, but before many months
have passed they come rushing back again into our pockets.
Many are of course left high and dry, as soon this tide in the
affairs of men ebbs back to its proper bed. Give me a hundred
saving footmen, fellows who have grown tired of the savings?
bank, and pant for the gambling that ends in a public house
or a prison. They are the men that I like.?
It was not difficult to perceive that Tom belonged to that
class of men, known as getters-up of Companies. He was an
inventive genius. He had as much imagination as a poet, and
would have been one no doubt, if it liad?nt been for the rule of
three and its teachings.
How he would walk the streets of London thinking over
the wants of mankind. That philanthropist Mr. Howard,
never took half the pains to benefit his fellow creatures, that
Tom Tiddler did; if he heard of any one who had an exe-
cution in his house, his instant idea was to start a


COMPANY
FOR THE
Ipratyctioit of Swants being Jistnungd upon
|ntt lent.
You could tell his character from the Companies he kept
afloat. He was scarcely sixteen when the notion of his first
speculation entered his head. He parted with a silver watch,
engine-turned, that he might start his
CAMBERWELL CANAL FISHING GROUNDS
FISHING-ROD LOAN SOCIETY.
At maturer years, he was the originator, getter-up, and
chairman of the
FOREIGN CLARET
BRITISH RED INK COMPANY.
What he made by this dodge, (he called them all dodges,)
nobody knows. That year some of the medical men of London
doubled their practice, and in the returns of the Registrar-
General it is written ? that dysentery has increased to an
alarming extent.?


GREAT SALISBURY PLAIN

was his idea. The subscriptions were small, to be sure, but
as he never bought any books but ?Alison?s History of
Europe ? and ? Dixon?s Life of Blake,? he is supposed to have
cleared something very handsome.
From all accounts he is even to this day working with good
profit a patent which he bought from a French gentlemen,
for making oyster sauce out of oyster shells; and as he has
taken the contract for supplying Bedlam, of course it must
bring him in a few pounds. Besides, Yankee Barnura has a
share in the discovery, and they say?see the Prospectus?that
the sauce is a great favorite with all hon vivants.
When we had finished one pint of sherry, Tom paid for it.
That pint of sherry cost us more money than we could have
purchased a whole vineyard for. Each drop of it was a
sovereign.
We are mow, alas! living in a third floor near to Euston
Square?and those places near to Euston Square are not palaces
?indeed ours is not, for it is situated between a coal and po-
tato warehouse on the right, and a general dealer?s on the left,
where they sell sweetmeats, songs, firewood, the ? London
Journal,? treacle, and string. Before the unlucky Friday when
we stood gazing at the Bank?until we drank that costly pint
of sherry?we were men of comparative wealth. Our cham-
bers were the prettiest in London. Many and many a time
have dear Cousins, darling Fannies, and sweet Julias, and
lovely Amelias gazed with envy upon our bright furniture,


borrowed our un-cut books, and feasted on our cozy dinners.
And now where are these comfortable chattels? Where?
Only three days ago we saw our solid rosewood table at a
second-hand furniture shop in Drury Lane.
We grew into the habit of visiting Tom Tiddler. He always
lunched at two precisely; and then we would sit by the hour
listening to him as he talked?by jingo, how he could talk!
about what he intended to do, the Companies he intended to
start, the Directors he intended to choose. As we listened to
him, we felt, as it were fascinated, we were like a poor gold-
finch trembling under the gaze of a hungry tom cat.
What a glorious man was this Tom Tiddler! He talked of
Lords, and Dukes, and Members of Parliament, as if he were a
militia colonel chatting about his men. Then the sums of money
he laid his imagination upon! Bless you, hundreds of pounds
were unworthy of his notice; he laughed at them; treated them
as if they were half-pence! He wanted millions! nothing but
millions!!
? If I can only manage to set going my
BATTERSEA GOLD FIELDS
own Mfli) TIMID MU ��HIPAIMY,
I shall be a made man before the year is out.? And he
would swallow a glass of sherry on the strength of the coming
fortune.
Usually we answered all his statements with a ? Yes! but
this time we uttered an ? Oh! ?
? Ah! that?s the next spec;? he said, musingly, ? we should
not want more than a million ; yes! I think a million would
do. It?s not much, but we might manage.?


Our eyes grew so large that the stretched eyelids felt
uncomfortably tight, ?A million!? we cried, ?is it not a
great deal of money??
We were the more startled because he had that very morning
borrowed five pounds from us.
? You don?t understand these matters,? he answered; ? two
hundred thousand Shares at five pounds! That?s it!?
? But you have not got a Mine yet,? we suggested.
What a common-place fellow you are,? indignantlv ex-
claimed Tom, ? that s the very last thing to be thought of.
Haven?t we got a title? You can easily purchase the Mine?
hundreds of them?but a good title is the difficulty.?
We thought he was wandering, but held our peace.
?We must have a couple of Dukes. Where can I, can
I, get them? Let me see! They say the Duke of Albateos
is very hard up. Yes, he might do! Albateos sounds well.?
? Do you know him ? ? we ventured to say, staggered by the
daring talk of the man.
? Know him ! ? and he laughed, ?as if it was necessary to
know him. If we promise him ten thousand Shares at 2
premium, do you think a nobleman, who is mortgaged up to
his wig, would hesitate about lending us the use of his name.
He would put it to a bill for less money.?
We have a sincere respect for noblemen?especially Dukes
?and did not believe him.
? Yes, we?ll have a duke,? he half said to himself, � and a
couple of Lords to follow. I know my men ? Loed Helpus
and Loed Ceicketgeound. They are the boys. I don?t think
I shall have an M.P. The Irish ones would come in cheap?
say two thousand shares?but the public are tired of ?em, I
fancy. However, we shall see ! we shall see I?
How was it possible not to admire a man like this?a fellow,
who, whilst smoking his cigar, could pick and choose among


the best blood of the land, as if he were selecting a cheese
instead of a noble.
We never left one of these extaordinary meetings without
feeling inclined to say ? good bye, sir,? to that Tom Tiddler
?confound him !
One afternoon we were quietly seated at home, reading a
book, with our feet in the fender, and a cigar in our mouth ?
in fact enjoying ourself, when a bold, impertinent, swaggering
knock was hammered at our door. It was just such a rat-a-
tat-tat as a half tipsy creditor?one who had always found
you out for the last six months ?would give. We hastily ran
our memory over all our outstanding accounts, but there was
no little bill that we could think of, that would in any way
warrant such an assault on our panel. As we were delibe-
rating, a second knock came. We made up our mind that
the chimney was on fire, and rushed to the door.
It was Thomas Tiddler, Esq. No-body but the originator of
a Gold Company could have given such a knock.
He had new clothes on. The sleeves of his frock coat were
lined with sky-blue silk. His waistcoat was rich, flowery, and
ungreased. Those trowsers ! all stripes and cross stripes?
a prison window wrapped round his leg.
We handed him a chair, and enquired meekly after his
health. We forgave him the knock; did not even mention the
circumstance. We felt awed in the presence of that immense
man.
Who shall describe the easy swagger of his ways. Three
cigars did he take up one after another, and fling back again,
after pinching their ends, as if they had been butterfly?s heads.
Then the grace with which he whisked about the diamond
ring, on that elegantly-managed little finger of his!
We offered him?but with much modesty and respect ?a
bottle of bitter ale, and asked him if he would allow us to
pour it out for him.


He refused; lie had been drinking champagne all the morn-
ing. He had been closeted with a Duke, two Lords, and
three M.P?s; swallowing that aeriel drink, and laughing, and
chatting, and plotting, and in fact, Tom Tiddler?Thomas
Plantagenet Tiddler?was the owner and originator of a Gold
Company, the discoverer and proprietor of three Gold Mines.
blush now to think of the many little meannesses we
were guilty of towards this man. But how can you be face
to face with the sole proprietor of
GREAT DOO AND DIDDLE
GOLD, SILVER, COPPER, AND BRASS,
& tel] Cnmp%
and not feel that there is some respectful worship due to
such a Demi-god. We let him put his muddy boots upon
our green velvet sofa; we allowed him to drop his cigar ash
on our velvet piled carpet; we, without a groan or a reproach,
beheld him lean back and break the back of one of our best
rosewood chairs; and yet, although it cost us many a sigh
when he had departed, we accompanied him to the door and
bowed him away, as though we had been his servant?out
of livery, and on board wages.
But to return to our story. When he was fairly settled and
comfortable, he commenced:
? I?ve done it at last, old boy! all right this time ! It?s as
good as a clean forty thousand to me. It?s my last venture,
and I?ll take care it?s a good one. We come out to-morrow.


A column and a half of advertisements in all the morning
papers. You should see the offices I have taken! There are
twelve men in them now, french polishing as hard as they can.
The desks, chairs, tables, and matting, will be delivered in
three days. What a lucky fellow I am, to be sure!? he added,
nodding his head, and smiling at the fire place.
? What do you think of this ? ? he continued, after a time;
? Read it out loud; I like to hear it; it?s so confoundedly
clever; the best that ever came out,?
He handed to us a roll of manuscript as big as a telescope.
It was the Prospectus. Our breath grew short; our hands
trembled as we untied the red tape that bound this precious
document. The hand-writing was excellent?every thing
seemed excellent?and I read with ease:

We were certainly greatly impressed by this long list of
wealth and nobility. Before us sat the genius that had raised
up this army of great men.
We had noticed whilst reading the names of the Directors,
that Tom had described himself as an Engineer. We had not,
up to that time, been aware that he was acquainted with that
science; indeed we addressed some such observation to him.


? Any body can be an Engineer,? be answered, ? it?s as easy
as fun; I once put some coals on to an engine fire, and if that
doesn?t qualify a man, I should like to know what does.?
We object to any thing that sounds like an imposition, and
said, ? But, dear boy, pray consider, ?
He interrupted us: ? I have considered, and I have come to
this conclusion, that every body knows his own business better
than any man can tell him; it therefore stands to reason, as
Engineering is my present business, that I must know that
science better than any other person.?
We did not press the point, but continued reading:
The extreme fertility of the gold fields of California and
Australia is no longer a matter of doubt, but is as certain
as rumour can make it, if any reliance is to be placed in the
strange tales told by travellers. Sir William Fuzzle, in
speaking of the gold fields of New South Wales, says,
1 heir fertility is very great. The crops are seen waving
like a sea of gold, answering to each breeze that visits this
wealth-producing land!?
? ie very name of our colony is sufficient to prove its
metallic richness. The word Australia is?as every one knows
?derived from Ores, metals in their mineral condition?
Frail, to lie about in disorder?and here, in this place, or state.
? One of the richest copper mines in the whole civilized
world, is the Burra Burra Mine, Especial care will taken
by the Committee that no ground shall be purchased on the
banks of the Maraboo River, unless they fancy that a Mine as
rich as the Burra Burra actually exists upon the property.
? A plan of the estates, the Directors would like to purchase
in California, will be open for inspection at our Office, any time
after nine o?clock in the evening. It will bo seen that gold
absolutely covers the face of the land?the property having


been coloured yellow to prove this desirable fact, to those
Shareholders who may feel inclined to doubt our assertions.
?The all-absorbing interest at present evinced by the
thousands of our fellow countrymen for the obtaining of gold
in large quantities, emboldens the Committee of Management
to undertake one of the grandest schemes ever devised by man.
Powerful machinery, such as spades, picks, and barrows,
efficient and scientific direction, perfect colonial amity, con-
fidence in the home management; this is all that is required
to ensure the perfect success of the undertaking.
? There is every reason to hope that the Capital of the Com-
pany will be sufficient to meet all expenses. If, however, such
should not prove to be the case, the Directors will take good
care to let the Shareholders know it as early as possible.
The Committee, taking into consideration the great mineral
wealth of both Australia and California, and remembering that
a copper mine, equal in richness to that of the Burra Burra,
must exist somewhere on the banks of the Maraboo River,
feel that they will not be accused of exaggeration if they
indulge in the fond hope that before many full moons have
reached their mature rotundity, the returns of the Great Doo
and Diddle Company will prove the excellence of the under-
taking, the truthfulness of the Directors, and a blessing to
mankind.
? The report of our engineer, Mr. Plantagenet Thomas
Tiddler, may be seen at our office daily, at any hour between
one and half past, when the office closes. Mr. Tiddler, in his
account of the territory, so much desired by the Directors,
says: 4 The vast quantities of gold?amounting to millions?
each year brought into Geelong and Sydney, justify me in
stating that this is the richest mining district in the world. On
the banks of the River Maraboo are to be found huge moun-
tains of quartz, in which the finest Gold exists in large quan-


titles, although undistinguishable to the naked eye, or even
the highest microscopic power. Let us take these moun-
tains at �6OO per ton of quartz. That will then give us
�3,496,203,400 tons of rock, at �6OO per ton, or more
metal than even the famed mines of Peru could ever have
contained.?
?Neither does Mr. Tiddler speak less confidently of our
success in California. If, as we said before, the Directors
can only obtain the Mines they have given orders to their
agent to purchase, the profits of the Company must indeed be
enormous. ?No one,? writes Mr. Tiddler from saceemaetin,
4 can picture to himself the richness of the Californian quartz
and ores. The Gold abounds in the greatest plenty. I have
examined one of the pits opened since my arrival here; from
the mouth downwards runs a jugular vein of Gold.? ? The
Albert Rock and Golden Drop Peppermint� Mining Com-
pany? have already realized �496,000 195., and they have
ores in hand valued at 3,000,000 of dollars. ? The River
Plated Gold and Gilt Washed and Silver Glitter
Crushing Company ? have retired from business; the amount
of ore they met with being so great that it was utterly im-
possible to bring it away with them.?
? One of the Californian Directors will be in attendance daily,
at the offices of the Company, at five o?clock in the morning, to
give all necessary information. A native of South Australia
is also anxiously expected by the next steamer, to explain,
in his own unvarnished and incomprehensible language, the
immense value of the grounds, to be shortly purchased for
the Great Doo and Diddle Company.?


?We read this, and fell back exhausted on our sofa. Could
it he true? Did this large amount of wealth really exist?
There was Tom Tiddler before us smiling proudly at the effect
his Prospectus had produced. It was not a dream.
We had?alas had\? a very pretty little sum of money
invested in house property, which produced us a neat income
of about �350 per annum. Of course, like all other civilized
men, we have never been contented with our lot, and con-
tinually thought to ourself, that we could with ease manage to
spend more than that moderate sum yearly.
The idea now entered our silly brain, that the moment had at
last arrived when our golden, goose was to lay her biggest egg,
when our miserable pittance was to be changed into a princely
revenue. We saw the Form of Application for Shares, written
at the foot of the Prospectus, and with a nervous tone turned to
Tiddler.
We reminded him of our long intimacy; of the time
when we were at school together; we enumerated to him the
many little favours we had done for him; we asked him if
he had forgotten the small sums we had lent to him in our
infancy; and the accommodation bills we had accepted for him
in our manhood. In fact we did not leave a single chance
untried for rousing his generosity; and after having done all
this, we appealed to him in the name of friendship, that he
would use all his influence, exert all his authority, to obtain
for us an allotment of a few hundred Shares in the Gee at
Doo and Diddle Mining Company.
Tom Tiddler has since confessed to us, that he could not for
the life of him imagine what we were after, appealing to his
feelings in that pathetic style. He half fancied that we were
going to borrow money from him, and he candidly told us


that he had fixed upon the excuse he intended to deny us
with.
The Geeat Doo and Diddle came out in style. Every body
talked of it. It was the best Company of the day. An
Exhibition Room was taken, and nine tons of quartz, with
lumps of gold as big as eggs sticking about them, were shown
to the wondering crowd.
The gentleman who lectured on this glorious specimen, told
us that the left side of the Maraboo River was one long line
of rocks, similar to the one exhibited, and that the entire chain
had been purchased by our Company.
In all the Morning Papers a paragraph appeared which set
the city m a perfect blaze. It had been discovered that Gold
m an immense quantity existed in the Torpedo and Mosquito
districts; on those very plots of ground about to be purchased
by the Doo and Diddle Company. As the writer said, � they
are not viens, they are carotid arteries.?
Although Tom had promised us three hundred Shares, still
he never sent them. On remonstrating with him he explained
to us that the success of the Doo and Diddle had surpassed his
most eager expectations, and that in fact the value of the
Shares had become so immense, that the Directors had
determined on keeping them all to themselves. He how-
ever, out of consideration for our long intimacy, kindly con-
sented to let us have one thousand out of the many which
had been reserved for his especial benefit. For this great
favour, he only charged us 3 Premium.
It is useless for us to narrate in detail how those three brick
tenements in Gray?s Inn Lane were sold, or what sum that
neat cottage at Brompton, with garden attached, was knocked
down for; but they went, and our three hundred and fifty
a year was converted into Gold Shares.
We shall never forget our first visit to an office in Cornhill;


chairs and tables, as polished as glass; a carpet into which the
feet sank as if it had been grass; green cloth doors, geo-
logical specimens, the Australian Native, and the Californian
Engineer, all were there to delight and astound the happy Share-
holders. We determined that we would keep our Shares as
an excellent investment, for life, and bequeath them as a
valuable inheritance to our children.
The night we went to bed, the Shares were at 5 Premium.
& ta- �
The next morning they were at 1 Discount.
It appeared the Directors, who held a large amount, had
thought it advisable to take advantage of the excellent state
of the market, and sell out. This' sudden deluge of shares
swamped the whole concern, and every one with it.
Then came angry Meetings of Shareholders, which began
in libels and ended in fights. Twice did I hear that exquisite
man the Duke of Albatros, called a common swindler.
Loed Helpus was laid up from a blow which he received in
consequence of denying that he was a rogue and a vagabond.
Baron Runti m Foozelli disappeared suddenly, and it is said
that he now forms one of the chief ornaments of the Boulogne
Aristocracy.
It subsequently appeared, (according to the statement of
Sir John Jackall,) that the smash was entirely owing to a
stupid mistake; the land purchased by the Company?s Agent
was on the right hank of the Marahoo, instead of the left.
In consequence of the deranged state of oui pecuniary
affairs,' it was deemed advisable by our friends, relations, and
the family attorney, that we should travel for a short time on
the Continent. We started on Sunday morning that glorious
day of liberty to the oppressed debtor ?by that fast-sailing
vessel the Queen of the Cannibal Islands, bound for Ostend.
On board we noticed an elegant and costly chariot, fitted up
with polished leather boxes of all shapes and sizes. Curiosity


impelled us to read the label attached to one of the trunks
which the carriage contained. Imagine our rage and agony
when we read the following inscription:?
Plantagenet Thomas Tiddler, Esquire ,
Passenger to Vienna.
