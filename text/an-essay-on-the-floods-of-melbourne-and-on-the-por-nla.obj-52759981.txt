PEE FACE.
WRITING in the first person singular number for the reasons
assigned in the first chapter of this Essay, and for the sake
of preserving uniformity of manner, which I think most will
allow to he some slight additional reason, I have now to
remark that in writing it, one of my principal objects has
been to make it a manual, useful as a means of reference
to those who have duties to perform in the matters of which
it treats, or who, for personal motives of any other kind,
would desire to acquire and retain the information which
it imparts, but who, from the dissimilarity of their ordinary
pursuits, would not as readily call to mind the different points ot
the subjects as the professional and practised engineer would do;
and that it should serve this purpose to the best of my ability,
I have divided the whole matter into sections, such as the
nature of it indicates, and each of these sections occupies a chapter
in the Essay, to which is given at the heading of each a concise
description of the part of the matter contained in it; and in a
table of contents, which next follows this preface, are all these
descriptive headings with the page at which each of the chapters
commences, by means of which any part may be speedily
referred to.
But another motive for writing as I have done is that much for
which I contend is denied by others who have spoken and written
on the subject, and to meet this denial it has been necessary that
I should reduce that for which I contend to as incontrovertible
a demonstration as the logic which I am capable of bringing to
bear on it would enable me to do. But such writing is anything
but amusing to many readers, and those to whom it is not so I


advise, as soon as they have read this preface, to turn at once
to the fifth chapter, and if their opinions coincide with what
is written in the two first paragraphs of that chapter, and if they
do not believe that seventeen inches extra rise of tide on the
morning of the 17th of December, 1863, and ten inches extra rise in
the afternoon was the cause of the flood on that day being twelve
feet above sea-level on four thousand acres of the land lying on
the south and west sides of Melbourne, twenty-one feet above that
level at the Punt-road, and twenty-three feet nine inches above
it at the lower side of the Chapel-street bridge, and who do
believe that the Jive miles of ridge, several feet higher than any
yet known flood, reaching from St. Kilda to the mouth of the
Yarra, was the cause of it, and who do believe that four hundred
acres area of tide (and there may be as much as five hundred
acres) rising and falling two feet eight inches, and flowing
through twenty chains horizontal width of openings ten feet
below low water level deep, and another opening in addition
thereto, a chain and a half wide and twenty-two feet below low
water level deep (this latter opening being for the passage of
shipping,) and allowed to ebb through the chain and a half
opening only will produce a scour of sufficient force to keep the
passage for shipping always open and passable, will be in no
need for reading any part that precedes that fifth chapter, and
will thereafter get all that is of practical importance. The fourth
chapter will be of little value to any who may be unacquainted
with the topography of the floods; and its principal value consists
in whatever it may amount to as a demonstration of the truth of
what some deny, and of the fallacies for which some contend.

ON THE
FLOODS OF MELBOURNE
AND ON THE
POET OF MELBOUENE.
CHAPTEE I.
Consisting of Introductory Matter only.
Some readers of the following pages may perhaps charge me with
egotism; to such I beg to remark that it is both more natural
and more easy to write just as you think, and I am quite ready
to plead guilty to a charge of being a great lover of personal
ease. Moreover, to write just as you think is least distracting
from the subject on which you may have to write, and, after all,
it is but a mere matter of taste whether it be better to write in
the first person singular, or in the third person ; and, according
to my taste, the iteration and continual reiteration of such expres-
sions as “ the writer,” “ the author,” &c., when the subject
matter in the nature of it obviously pertains either largely or
wholly to the writer, savours much more strongly of mere mock-
modesty than the appropriate repetition of the big “ I,” however
frequently the repetition of it may occur, savours of the true
essence of egotism, and that which alone is true egotism —namely,
conceit and undue self-esteem; and these being my views I shall,
notwithstanding the sensitiveness and timidity which are part
and parcel of my nature, write in the first person singulai


wherever and whenever it may appear to me to be better that I
should do so, and suffering the idiosyncracies just mentioned, I
must, nevertheless, brave and bear as best I can whatever cruelties
I may experience from censorious, satirical, and sarcastic critics.
As the big “ I ” will be more freely used in what remains to be
written of introductory matter than in any part of the real
subject matter of this essay, I have considered it advisable, as a
preliminary thereto, to make the foregoing remarks, and shall
now proceed to show how my attention was first drawn to the
subject, and to set forth some of the incidents by which my
progress with it has been affected, but shall first point out for
whom and for what that which lam writing is intended. It is
not at all intended for the professional engineer, but principally
for those who have a practical interest, either from personal self-
interest or from the duties of their situations and offices in
relation to the subjects of which it treats, and its object, is to lay
before them in an unmistakable form certain matters on which
extraordinarily erroneous notions have been almost universally
held, and to show how those matters should be dealt with; and it
may help those for whom it is intended to tell them that, in a
certain section of engineering practice—namely, that in which
the mechanical operations of nature have to be dealt with by the
engineer for the purpose of remedying their bad effects, or
increasing their beneficial operations—those operations of nature,
if understood by the engineer, and the mode of dealing with them,
if it be the correct mode are, when properly explained, just as
intelligible to the non-professional person of ordinary intelligence
(in more than nineteen instances out of every twenty,) as they are
to the engineer himself, and the former not only understands what
is explained to him, but he knows that he does understand it, and
where in such a case such an one has to say—after exercising a
simple willingness to understand—l am no engineer, and there-
fore cannot form a judgment of it, it is pretty certain that there
is something wrong in the engineering, and in the engineer too.
When I began writing this essay, it was with the intention of
dividing it into short sections, prefacing each section with a title
or heading appropriate to the part of the subject of which it
treated, my motive for thus arranging it being to afford the
greatest possible facilities for easy reference by those whom I
hope to have as my readers, should they need to refer to it to
refresh their memories; and my intention was to make one single
section of the whole of the introductory matter, but what I have
already written has run to a greater length than I intended any
single section to do, and as I do not intend to re-write any part
of it, I shall now make a separate section of that which I have
already promised—namely, to show how my attention was first
drawn to the subject, and to set forth some of the incidents by
which my progress with it has been affected.


CHAPTER 11.
Further introductory matter , wherein are shown the way in which
the attention of the author of this essay was first drawn to the
subjects of lohich the following pages treat, and some of the
incidents set forth by which his progress has been affected.
I came to this colony more than twenty years ago, intending to
stay but a few weeks in it, and I brought with me some of those
erroneous ideas respecting it, which at that time prevailed exten-
sively in England and elsewhere, one of which then held by me
being that the population of it was about five millions; and
believing this, I considered that the large quantity of shipping
which then lay in Hobson’s Bay was but little, if any more, than
that which was required for the foreign commerce of such a
population, and with this belief I was struck with the blunder
that had been made in making the Hobson’s Bay Railway
instead of making a dock at Melbourne, and a ship canal
from the bay to it. I soon discovered that an opinion
prevailed that the entrance to a ship canal could not be
kept open; but this opinion I then held, and still hold, to
be a great fallacy, even if no other means for doing it existed
than those that were apparent to me at that time. These views
led me to pause about leaving the colony, and although, in
the course of time, my error inspecting its population became
connoted, other engineering prospects arose which gave me
stronger reasons for staying here; and, although I had very
much ceased to hope for any benefit from a dock project, I had
never altogether given up that hope, but in the of Decem-
ber, 1863, came the great flood at Melbourne, and this threw an
entirely fresh light on the matter, for not only did I see the
importance of preventing the floods, but I also saw in the most
effective means for doing it, an effective and economic means for
keeping the entrance of a ship canal open to the sea.
On the evening of the day on which that flood had risen to its
greatest height (the 17th of December, 1863,)_ information reached
me of its magnitude and the great damage it had done, and this
induced me to go to Melbourne for the purpose of ascertaining all
the phenomena which it had presented. Ihe first thing I noticed
which at all concerns my present purpose was that the whole
rainfall over all the tracts of country to the north and east of
Melbourne, drain into the Yarra and Plenty rivers, had
passed under the Chapel-street iron bridge, where the fall from
its east to its west side must have been very great—l believe
about seven feet. I have gained very accurate information as to
its highest level on the lower or west side of the bridge, but have


been unable to get it with as great accuracy on the other side. I
noticed the small area of land occupied by the flood between the
Chapel-street bridge and the St. Kilda-road, the very large area
it occupied after it had passed the St. Kilda-road; and also
noticed that a ridge, many feet higher than the flood, reached the
whole distance from St. Kilda to the mouth of the Yarra, forming
a basin of very large extent, with no other outlet than the mouth
of the Yarra and a very small opening at the Sandridge lagoon,
the latter not becoming an outlet till the flood had attained a con-
siderable height, and it at once became evident to me that this
ridge was the cause of the great height and large extent of the
flood at Melbourne; but of all this 1 shall have to speak more
fully hereafter.
At the time just referred to I had already projected a dock on
the south side of the Yarra, and a ship canal from Hobson’s Bay
to it —making the Yarra available, in the best way then apparent
to me, for keeping the canal open to the sea : and of this project
I had several years before prepared on paper a small coloured
plan in which the Military Reserve was made the site for the
dock, and the way for shipping into it a canal, commencing at
the beach a little to the east of Sandridge, which passed round
Emerald Hill on the St. Kilda side of that place. In this plan I
proposed, at a point near the Immigrants’ Home, to divert the
Yarra from its present course and bring it out at the beach a
little to the west of the mouth of the ship canal, with a few
chains length of foreshore intervening between the newly formed
debouchure of the river and the mouth (
of the canal. From the east side of the v.
mouth of the canal I proposed that a M 1 j
pier should extend into the bay to the |i|
depth required for shipping, and from Jij
the west side of the new debouchure of fifrp'
the river another similar pier converg-
ing towards the other to the same depth
of water, with no greater space between
their heads than would be required for
the passage of shipping; and from the
west side of the mouth of the canal a
third pier parallel to the former of
the two already described, but rather
shorter than it, in order that its head
should not obstruct the flow from the
river. This arrangement of piers, and
the purposes to be accomplished by
them, will be better understood by
reference to the woodcut in the margin,
in which a short length of the canal
from the beach is marked by the letter


C, a similar short length of the new cut for the river by the
letter E., and each of the piers by the letter P. By this, it will
be seen, that the practical effect would be the same as that which
would result from the joint debouchure of the river and canal by
a narrow opening at the end of a headland projecting far out into
the sea, none of the muddy water of the river ever getting into
the canal till it had become largely diffused in and largely diluted
by the clear water of the bay, and thus diluted a small portion
only of it would get into the canal, and that only during the flow
or return of tide, and even then far more of it would pass up the
outside of the two outer piers than would be carried into the
narrow space between them, whilst the ordinary mouth of the
estuary of a river invites, if I may be allowed the use of the term,
as much as possible of the mud to return into it.
That which I have just described was my original plan for
dealing with the Port of Melbourne, and when I projected it
I did not even know that floods ever did occur there ; but when
the flood of 1863 came I saw at once that the best, and in fact the
only means of preventing them, except at an enormous expense,
would be to carry off the flood waters by a channel of large
surface extent and shallow depth, and that if carried no lower
than lowest low water level it, and the ship canal, and dock,
might be made by great extent of surface, notwithstanding the
small rise and fall of tide in Hobson’s Bay to compensate for the
absence there of that hydrostatic pressure which is made available
for what is called flushing at the entrance to docks, where there
is a great rise and fall of tide, and for this purpose all that would
be required would be to provide by means of sluices that wouM
require but small power to open and close them, a large extent of
openings for the flow of tide into the flood channel, canal, and
dock, and by closing all the sluices during the ebb, cause the
whole quantity of tide water to flow out through the ship
entrance only. I did not expect by my former project to
altogether supersede the necessity for dredging, but I always
have felt sure, and still do feel sure, that this latter method will
entirely do away with all necessity for that part of the dredging
which, in the absence of it, would be indispensable for keeping
the entrance for shipping open.
At the beginning of the year 1867, several of the Metropolitan
Municipal Councils joined in united action for the purpose of
getting means taken for the prevention of the floods, and several
meetings of delegates from these bodies were held in Melbourne,
and this induced me to prepare a plan for submission to them,
showing how I proposed, in the way just mentioned, to make the
means for preventing the floods serve also as a means for bringing
the Port of Melbourne from Hobson’s Bay to Melbourne ; and at
the same time I addressed a circular to the town clerks of each
municipality, a copy of which will be found commencing an


appendix hereto. It can scarcely fail to be noticed that in this
circular there is some appearance of discrepancy with what I have
said and done at other times; indeed, my first project for dealing
with the Port of Melbourne—the plan of which, though not now
in existence, was seen by many persons still living—gives the
lie direct to some parts of that circular; but this must be ascribed
to the timidity already confessed, which delights in peace and
quietness, and instinctively shrinks from disputes and contra-
dictions on points which have no practical bearing on matters in
hand.
Some considerable time before the Metropolitan Municipal
Councils commenced the line of action which they took in the
year 1867 with reference to the floods at Melbourne, I had learnt
that those floods were generally ascribed to what has been called
the heaping up of the waters of Port Philip Bay by the action of
southerly and south-westerly gales in that part of it which is
called Hobson’s Bay. This being assigned as the cause first came
to my knowledge on reading the report of the Yarra Flood
Commission of 1864, in the fourth paragraph of which is the
following passage :—“ And in Melbourne and its neighbourhood
the evils were greatly aggravated by the height to which the
waters rose in the bay under the influence of a gale from the
south-west.” Knowing, as I did, the large extent of country
round the south and west of Melbourne over which the floods had
spread (since ascertained to be fully four thousand acres,) and
knowing also of the high ridge which reached from St. Kilda to
the mouth of the Yarra, by which the fall of the flood into
Hobson’s Bay was intercepted, I was very greatly surprised on
reading this passage, but still more surprised when I found that
the same opinion which was thus expressed by the Commissioners
was held by every other person that I ever heard express an
opinion respecting it. Undoubtedly such floods as that of 1863
never occur but with southerly and south-westerly gales, and for
the simple reasons that no other winds are ever accompanied
with sufficiently heavy and continuous rainfall; but the ridge
just mentioned is the true cause of the height and extent of the
floods at Melbourne. In the appendix hereto I have given a full
reprint of the report of the Commission of 1864, as I have done of
my own circular, already mentioned, and my reason for doing so
is the same in both cases, namely : that neither are procurable
by my readers generally by any other means. I shall have
occasion to refer to what others have written, but as all else to
which I shall refer that has been written by others is accessible,
I shall quote nothing else in extenso, but shall merely quote what
is required for my purpose, and only indicate here where the
entire text may be found.
Nothing of any practical value resulted from what was done by
the Metropolitan Municipal Councils, and but for one incident, it


is doubtful whether I should have made any allusion either to
what they did or what their action induced me to do. I was
introduced by one of the delegates to a delegate from Sandridge,
and the latter, on seeing the plan of my project, remarked, “ I do
not believe that will be done in any of our time, and I hope
This, and certain proposals which were made by the Sandridge
delegates, led me to maintain silence with reference to the ridge
as the cause of the floods, and, as I have already confessed, a love
of peace and quietness restrained me from disputing about the
heaping up of the waters in Hobson’s Bay being the cause.
With reference to the interest of Sandridge, I must remark that
few persons regret more than I do the almost universality of a
great good not being to be done without harm to a few, and as a
place of business Sandridge must suffer by Hobson’s Bay ceasing
to be the Port of Melbourne; but this must be a result of no
distant time, and the amount of benefit that will accrue therefrom
will immensely exceed the amount of harm.
During the interval from the time last referred to till the
passing of the Melbourne Harbour Trust Act, nothing occurred
to induce me to any further activity with reference either to the
Port of Melbourne or the floods of Melbourne, but the passing of
that Act and the constitution of the Commission have become
more important reasons than any which had previously existed
why I should, with as little delay as possible, give publicity to
my project, and forthwith I shall conclude this prefatory
matter, and proceed to the explanations I have to give of it.
CHAPTER 111.
Explanations of the Causes and Peculiarities of the Floods at
Melbourne , and of the Phenomena which they there prese'nt.
What has already been said can scarcely fail to throw consi-
derable light on this part of the subject, but more precise
information must be given before the prevention of the floods and
the suitability of the means thereto for purposes pertaining to the
Port of Melbourne can be properly understood, and this should
be the matter for first consideration, as all those whose duties or
interests are most concerned in that port naturally say on first
approaching the consideration of the subject, “ The floods are
matters that do not come within our province.” This has been
said and wall be said till it becomes understood that no mode of
dealing with the Port of Melbourne in the way most to be desired


can be canned into execution without increasing the evils of the
floods in some directions; and, if it can be shown that the means
for preventing the floods will be of considerable utility and value
for the purposes of the Port, the fact of the double utility is a
matter of importance to those who have a duty or an
interest in the affairs of the Port, inasmuch as it gives them a
just claim to have the cost of it divided in some proportion between
themselves and those whose duties or interests are more connected
with the floods.
As has already been stated, what has been called the heaping
up of the waters of Port Philip Bay in Hobson s by the
action of southerly and south-westerly gales has been assigned as
a co-efficient but main cause of the great floods at Melbourne,
excessive rainfall being given as one essential cause, though
insufficient without the other to produce floods of such magnitude
as that which occurred in December. 1863, or that which occurred
in October, 1866. No one can doubt the latter being a very
essential cause, and that the former is so has been a matter of very
general belief, but on what foundation and with what reason
remains to be seen. At the 161st page of the 6th volume of the
“ Transactions of the Royal Society of Victoria is the commence-
ment of a paper which was read at a meeting of that Society on
the last day of October, 1864, in which the variations of atmos-
pheric pressure, as indicated by the barometer, are set forth as
more potent causes of the variations of the height of the waters
in Hobson's Bay than the direction and force of the winds. The
demonstrable laws of hydrostatics involve that at any points,
however near together, or however far apart, where any difference
of atmospheric pressure exists, either on water or on any other fluid,
the depression of the surface of the fluid at the points of pressure
will be directly proportional to the pressure, and that, where no
other causes for variation of level operate, the barometer will be a
very correct indication of the variations of level; but this is a fact
that does not affect my purpose, the question therein concerned
being not what is the cause of the heaping-up of the waters, but
whether that heaping-up has any appreciable effect as a cause of
the phenomena which the floods present at Melbourne, and I
think I shall be able to convince all who favour me with a reading
of these pages that it cannot possibly have any such effect.
The second lithograph at the end of this essay is a diagram
showing the rise and fall of tides in Hobson s Bay from the 13th
to the 25th day of December, 1863, both days inclusive. This
diagram is copied from a diagram which faces the 161st page of
the 6th volume of the “ Transactions of the Royal Society of
Victoria ” (the volume and page already mentioned,) the latter
diagram extending over a period of time from the 30th day of
October, 1863, to the 25th of December next following, which
shows, in addition to the rise and fall of tides, the rises and falls


of the barometer, the direction and force of the winds, and the
phases of the moon at every quarter of each lunation, it being
there stated that these particulars were taken from Mr. Ellery’s
register of these phenomena. The diagram hereto annexed is
copied from the tide register only, no other parts of the original
diagram being at all pertinent to my subject, and special attention
has been paid to the following particulars, namely—drawing the
scale of feet correctly which shows the rise and fall of tides,
showing the higher (the afternoon) tide of the 14th of December
correctly, and both tides on the 17th of December. The horizontal
parallel lines show in feet the extreme range of tide, the number
of feet being shown by numeral figures at each end of the diagram,
and the rise and fall of tides by the strong zig-zag line. And,
referring to the 163rd page of the volume just mentioned, there
will be found on the last entire paragraph of that page the
following passage : —“ The maximum effect is shown on the 14th
of December with the barometer at 28-90, and a gale of wind from
the south-west with a force of ten, being equal to 25lbs. pressure
to the superficial foot, during which time the waters are driven
up two and a-half feet higher than the ordinary range of flood
tides.” If either diagram be referred to, it will be seen that this
“ two and a-half feet higher than the ordinary range of flood
tide ” is six and a-half feet from the zero of the scale, from which
it follows that the fourth foot of that scale represents the ordinary
range of flood tide or spring tide high water level; and, if the
17th of December be referred to, it will be seen that the morning
tide of that day (the day on which the flood was at its greatest
height) was but about seventeen inches higher than the ordinary
range of flood tide, and the afternoon tide only about ten inches
higher. I think anyone who considers these facts will find it
difficult to believe that such heapings-up as these of the waters of
Port Philip Bay at its northern end, or Hobson’s Bay could
possibly have been the cause of the floods on the south and west
sides of Melbourne, extending over an area of 4000 acres, and
rising over the whole of that area to twelve feet higher than
ordinary flood tide level, or the cause of the floods of the Yarra
rising to twenty-one feet above that level at the Punt-road, and
twenty-three feet nine inches above it on the west or lower side
of the Chapel-street iron bridge.
Those who do not believe that such large effects could have
resulted from so insignificant a cause will naturally ask—where
is the real cause to be sought and found?—and, for the purpose
of answering this question, I beg to refer them to the first litho-
graph at the end of these pages, which will be found to be a map
so prepared as to be in many respects self explanatory. On this
map will be seen a ridge extending the whole distance (about five
miles) from St. Kilda to the mouth of the Yarra, the height of
which is greater than that of any Melbourne flood, and there is


no opening through it except at the Sandridge Lagoon, and this
after a lapse of ten years from the last flood has always ceased to
he an opening till the next flood has risen very considerably, and
thereby opened it, and when fully opened it is but a very incon-
siderable addition to the outlet which the mouth of the Yarra
affords. This ridge I think, will be seen to he the sole cause of
all that is principally observable in the floods of Melbourne, that
is, it is the sole cause of the great area over which the floods
spread at Melbourne, and of the consequent height to which they
rose there; but to make this sufficiently plain, I must beg further
attention to the map which has just been referred to.
On the map will be seen three lines, each of the three consisting
of short straight lines alternating with two dots ; one of these
lines commences on the north side of the Yarra, at the Chapel-
street iron bridge, and reaches from that point to the top margin
of the map to the west of North Melbourne; another of them
commences on the south side of the Yarra, at the Chapel-street
bridge, and, taking a westerly course along the south side of the
Yarra, with about a point and a-half of northing, turns round the
high land on which stand the Immigrants’ Home and the Military
Barracks, and thence by a southerly course, with about two points
of easting, reaches nearly to St. Kilda, where it again turns round
into a course parallel to the shore of Hobson’s Bay, by which
course it ends at the mouth of the Yarra; and the third of these
lines surrounds Emerald Hill. It will be seen by the first of the
references on the map that the lines just described are designed to
show the margin of the flood of the year 1863 at Melbourne ;
and all who at all accurately observed that flood will see that the
margin of it as shown by them is a very close approximation to
the truth. There are three slight inaccuracies, one of which was
designed, and the other two have been discovered since several
hundred copies of the map have been printed. The inaccuracy
that was designed, is in that part of one of the lines, the course
of which is about parallel to the shore of Hobson’s Bay, and had
that part of it been shown, so as to correctly represent the course
of the flood margin there, the line, instead of extending to the
mouth of the Yarra, would have turned towards and ended on
the coast line, at the east side of the outlet of the Sandridge
Lagoon ; and a fourth line of the same kind reaching to the
mouth of the Yarra would have had its commencement on the
west side of the outlet of the Lagoon, but the distance of the
point of termination of one line, and of commencement of the
other, would, on the scale of the map, be less than the tenth of
an inch, which fully justifies my having said, w r ith reference to
the outlet of the Lagoon, that, “ when fully opened, it is but a
very inconsiderable addition to the outlet which the mouth of the
Yarra affords.” This departure from the correct representation
was made for the purpose of showing more plainly certain methods


which I propose for dealing with the Port of Melbourne and with
the floods. The two inaccuracies, which were not designedly-
made, but were discovered too late to be corrected on the map,
both occur on the line on the north side of the Yarra which
extends from the Chapel-street bridge to the north side of the
map. The first commences at the point where this line crosses
the Punt-road, on the north side of the bridge by which the rail-
way crosses that road, at which point the line has diverged
considerably from the course of the river, and thence, instead of a
westerly course it should have been shown converging towards
the river in the direction of the Botanical Gardens. 1 saw this
error from the Punt-road a few days only before the time at which
lam now writing, and am confirmed in what I now state by the
seventh paragraph of the report of the Yarra Flood Commission
of 1864, a reprint of which, as I have already said, is given in
the appendix hereto. In the paragraph just referred to is the
following passage, “ embankments to the necessary levels should
he formed along the north and south side of the channel, and
extended to an oblique weir which we propose should be built at
Jolimont in substitution for the Falls and other embankments
higher up the river on the north side of the Yarra from the
Chapel-street bridge to the high ground opposite the Botanical
Gardens.” Had this line been a correct representation of the
margin of the flood of 1863, at this part the whole area occupied
by flood water from the Chapel-street bridge to Princes’ bridge
would be but about a hundred acres, but that area is considerably
reduced by this “ high ground” opposite the Botanical Gardens
being outside of the flood bounds, and by its position considerably
reducing the flood area at this part. The other recently discovered
error is at a part where the flood margin crossed Flinders-
lane West, and I am informed by a gentleman who is well
acquainted with the premises w T hich were formerly the timber
yard of the late Mr. Edmund Westby r , that the flood did not
extend quite so far on to those premises as is represented by the
map. The correction of the former of these tw-o inaccuracies is
of some importance as will hereafter be explained, but the latter
is only worth mentioning as being of a kind of which there must
of necessity be many, no survey having been made to secure perfect
precision, but all such very slightly affect the question of flood
area and the only important point in connection with either is
that of showing the great difference in the area of the land
occupied by the flood between the Chapel-street bridge and the
St. Kilda-road, and that which was occupied by it below the St.
Kilda-road, the former less than a hundred acres and the latter
not less than four thousand and that the latter was as much as
four thousaud will be seen when it is known that the peninsula
which has the part of the Yarra called Fisherman’s Bend, to the
north of it Hobson’s Bay to its south, the part of the Yarra below


its confluence with the Saltwater river to its west, and its neck
in a line between Melbourne and Sandridge is fully two thousand
out of the four thousand acres.
Another line requiring to be here noticed (the second in order
in the references on the map) is one consisting of a succession of
short straight lines, which commence at the middle of the Chapel-
street bridge, and terminate at a short distance below the
St. Kilda-road. This line is intended to show approximately the
course of the flood current as distinguished from the river current,
the former (the flood current) getting its direction not at all from
the river, but from the banks on each side of it, and taking its
course over the land on that side where the banks are least steep.
This current takes a north-westerly direction on the north side of
the river, from the Chapel-street bridge, and in its course, by the
succession of floods which have occurred during hundreds, and,
perhaps, thousands of years, has washed hollows in the soil over
which it has passed, which in wet seasons, and the deepest of
them at all times, form a succession of small lagoons, and one of
them, the first on the west side of the Punt-road, lies just in a
direction towards the Botanical Gardens, in which direction this
line" ought to have been shown. How the lagoon in the Botanical
Gardens was formed is a matter which had always escaped my
consideration, till I became aware that the deflection of the flood
current by the high ground opposite to those gardens instead of
being from a north-westerly to a westerly direction, as shown in
the map, was from the former direction to a south-westerly one,
or directly towards the lagoon ; and unless that lagoon be entirely
a work of art, which in the absence of any evidence to the
contrary is quite possible, it must have been the effect of the
currents of the floods which have occurred during many hundred
years, which, crossing the river by their already acquired
momentum at this point, and running as they have on all occasions
done there into a cul de sac, a recoil from the further end thereof
would be a necessary consequence; and an under current over a
considerable part of the return would be a further necessary
consequence, and thereby not only would the lagoon be formed,
but from the force of the under current on its bottom it would be
deeper than some of those that had been formed by the uninter-
rupted passage of the flood currents through them.
The part of this flood current which requires most to be noticed
is that immediately before it ceases and becomes lost in the
waters of the four thousand acre flat to the south and west of
Melbourne. Towards this part the high lands on both sides
converge, forming a narrow channel, through which the floods
pass with great force and rapidity, so much so that during the
flood of 1863 the road material of the St. Kilda-road was washed
away to such a depth that part of the fencing was carried away
with it. But what requires most notice here is, that just above


this part, owing to the land becoming higher on the north side of
the river, the flood current crosses the river current, and by the
impetuosity of the former the succession of floods f?om remote
periods of time have formed that lagoon, which has lately been
beautified as an ornament to the Government Domain, all the
works of which will be demolished by the first great flood, and
the occurrence of these floods is at intervals averaging at about
eight years. The further and fuller consideration of this latter
matter will be more appropriate to one of the following chapters
of this Essay, its main importance having reference to the point
at which a channel for the discharge of the floods should
commence.
CHAPTER IV.
A few, of the means that have been proposed for the prevention of
the floods at Melbourne considered, that proposed by the author
being explained in the next chapter.
It would be scarcely possible to over-estimate the importance of
this flood question being thoroughly understood by all who have
any great interest in the Port of Melbourne, and especially by all
who have any share in the decision of any course of action for its
management or improvement, or who may take any part in
designing works for those purposes, for were the latter duty to be
assigned to any one unacquainted therewith, and he to proceed to
the execution of that duty in ignorance of. or with erroneous
views respecting this matter, very serious errors, however gicat
his ability as an engineer might be, would almost inevitably be
the consequence; and this is the reason why I consider it to be
better to go into it as exhaustively as I am able before I say a
word on any other point that has any practical bearing on what
ought to be done with the Port.
For the purpose of forming a correct judgment on this part of
the subject, one of the most important points for consideration is
the causes on which depend the velocities of the flood currents at
every point at which those causes are at all operative on the floods
at Melbourne, and for this purpose the area of the whole of the
country, which is drained by the River Plenty, and the whole of
that which is drained by the River Yarra, from its most remote
tributary down to the Chapel street bridge, come first for con-
sideration, the whole of the drainage off those areas having
passed under that bridge both during the flood of 1863 and that
of 1866.


The most remote tributary of the Yarra rises near the summit
of Mount Baw-Baw, due east from Melbourne, and seventy-six
miles in a direct line distant from that city, and a line drawn
due north from Melbourne will, at a distance of thirty miles r
intersect the ridge of the dividing range to the north of Wallan-
Wallan, and the tract of country contained within the right-
angled triangle of which these tw r o lines contain the right angle
is of 729,600 acres extent, but the country drained by the River
Plenty and by that part of the Yarra which lies above the
Chapel-street bridge considerably exceeds that extent; for
although the line to the north from Melbourne would give the
drainage area of that part very correctly, there being, as shown
by the creeks of that part, about an equal drainage area from
east to west into the Saltwater River, and from west to east into
the River Plenty, but the case is very different with the other
two sides of the triangle. From the north side of the easterly
line from Melbourne to Mount Baw-Baw every drop of drainage
flows into the Yarra ; whilst from the south side of it a strip of
country, at least twelve miles wide at the Emerald Diggings,,
drains across it into the Yarra too ; and another strip of country
on the .south side of it, about twelve miles wide, reaching to the
high land to the south of Oakleigh, also drains by the Gardiner’s
Creek into the Yarra. Then on the hypothenuse, or third side of
this right-angled triangle, for a distance of forty miles from its
north-westerly end, the mean breadth of country outside of the
triangle to the ridge of the dividing range is not less than two’
miles, and all this drains into the Yarra; whilst from its south-
easterly end the dividing range closely approximates to a
segment of a circle, the chord of which is thirty-four miles long,
and the versedsine (a line perpendicular from the middle of the
chord to the ridge of the range) is eleven miles long, and the
whole drainage from this segment is into the Yarra, excepting
only a little more than seven miles length of this line, which is
crossed by a spur of the dividing range, on which is a small
triangle of country, the drainage of which flows into the River
Goulbourn, but the triangle is obtuse-angled, the obtuse angle
subtending the side which is formed by the portion of the line
which lies between the forty miles length from its north-westerly
end and the thirty-four miles length from its south-easterly end - r
and were this line eight miles long instead of a little more than
seven, and the triangle a right-angled instead of an obtuse-
angled triangle, the whole area of it would be but 10,240 acres —
a quantity wdiich would not be worth notice as a deduction from
the whole drainage area, were it not that some whose opinions
differ from my own may be disposed to accuse me of making
inaccurate representations. My only sources of information are
the maps of the district, bat the evidence which they afford


leaves no room for doubt that the drainage off 1 nearly, if not
quite, a million of acres has found its way under the Chapel-
street bridge ever since that bridge was erected.
At this Chapel-street bridge everything conspires to give great
velocity to the water which passes under it, whilst just the reverse
is the case with that which has to find its way out at the mouth of
the Yarra, one agency only (so far, at least, as all water situate
below sea level is concerned) aiding thereto, namely: a hydrostatic
pressure, which, when the flood of 1863 was at its greatest
height, varied with the variations of the height of the tides of
that day, from ten feet seven inches to thirteen feet five inches at
the most, all other agencies then operating being antagonistic
thereto, the inertia of the waters of the Bay presenting the
principal antagonism; and, owing to this, the absurdity of a deep
-channel anywhere for the escape of the floods, and the still
greater absurdity of cutting such a channel from any one point
in the river to any other point within it, are evident. Mr. Robert
Adams, who till his death was the City Surveyor of Melbourne,
plainly indicates his conviction of this latter fact in the paragraph
with which the 153rd page of the 6th volume of the Transactions
of the Royal Society of Victoria ends, and which the 154th page
commences. Amongst the lithographs which I attach hereto,
the third is a fac-simile of one which faces the 148th page of the
volume, just referred to, showing Mr. Adams’ method of dealing
with the floods, which, in one respect, is identical with that of
the Flood Commission of 1864, namely : that he proposed to cut
a wide flood channel from the river at Melbourne to a point
within the mouth of the river, but deep only over a sufficient part
of its width for the passage of shipping, the rest of its width
being a kind of under water terrace, of shallow depth.
It has been necessary for me to ascertain what is the area of
country the whole drainage from which flows under the Chapel-
. street bridge, as I have found it impossible, notwithstanding
repeated and long-continued efforts for the purpose, to get any
reliable information respecting the height to which the flood of
1863 rose on the upper side of that bridge. I have ascertained,
with considerable precision and certainty, what its height was on
the lower side and at the Punt-road, but on the upper side one
person has pointed out to me a spot as being about the height to
which it rose, which I find to be 6.99 feet, or, taking the
centesimal part of a foot as too insignificant to be admitted into
the estimate, seven feet higher than the height on the lower side.
Another person has taken me to a point only two feet six inches
higher, which he believes to be about the height to which that
flood rose, and another to a point less than eighteen inches
higher. Which of these differences of height is nearest to the
truth will readily be seen when it is known that the flood of 1863
was caused by about three days’ almost incessant and very heavy


rain, that the whole drainage of it from off about a million acres
of country passed under the Chapel-street bridge, and that the
water-way under that bridge is hut three chains wide at the base
of the piers, and three feet wider between the upright part of the
piers, which commences at nine feet from the base of each. I
believe that all three are below the truth, and that, with
reference to two of them, the persons from w'hom I sought the
information unintentionally confounded the flood of 1863 with
that of 1866, and one of my reasons for this belief is that I have
clearly ascertained that the flood of the latter year did not rise
on the lower side of the bridge so high as that of the former year
by three feet and a half.
The facts just stated necessarily show that the velocity of cur-
rent through and directly from the bridge must have been very
great. The whole of the water was in rapid motion down to the
bottom of the river which, under the bridge, is now T twenty-three
feet deep below summer level, and was two feet deeper at the
time of the flood of 1863 than it is now, owing to the falls at
Melbourne being two feet higher then than now. The flow must
have been very rapid down to the bridge for so large a quantity
of water to have reached that distance in the time, and through
and from the bridge, the rapidity must necessarily have increased
very considerably as the consequence of a hydrostatic pressure of
seven feet acting as an accelerating force to the momentum with
which the water had reached that point. By seven feet hydros-
tatic pressure I mean the pressure consequent on the flood water
being seven feet higher on the upper than on the lower side of the
bridge, and I have no doubt that if I could obtain as accurate
information about the height above the bridge as that which I
have gained about its height below and at the Punt-road, I should
find that seven feet was less than the real difference. The dis-
tance through the bridge is but thirty-six feet, and a fall of seven
feet in so short a distance would give a great surface velocity if
the fall commenced from a point where the water was in a state
of rest; but in the fairway the water came to the bridge with
great acquired velocity as it must have done for so large a body
of it to have reached that point within the time at which it got
there, and from a distance so gi’eat as that from which it had to
flow, and this the initial velocity at the commencement of the
fall, would greatly increase the velocity of the fall.
To give a clear idea of the velocities of the current through
and from the bridge, I cannot do better than to refer my readers to
“ Molesworth’s Pocket Book of Engineering Formulae,” a small
manual which must be very generally in the hands of members
of the engineering profession, and therefore easy of access to
most persons. At the 153rd page of the seventeenth edition is a
table giving the surface bottom and mean velocities of rivers at
thirty-two different velocities, ranging by equal gradations from


four inches in a second to a hundred inches in the same short
space of time. The various matters of information there given
respecting the flow of rivers are deduced from experiments made
on the Mississippi, and in the table just referred to it will be seen
that, at the slowest surface velocity there given, namely, four
inches to the second of time, the bottom velocity is but one-fourth
of the surface velocity, whilst at a surface velocity of a hundred
inches to the second of time, the bottom velocity is more than
four-fifths, and the mean velocity more than nine-tenths of the
surface velocity ; and it will be seen hereafter, from effects which
will be described, that the surface velocities under and from the
bridge are not likely to have been so little as a hundred inches to
the second of time during the greater part of the rise of the flood
of 1863.
A little consideration of the facts which become evident from
what has just been said, and of other more simple facts which
will become as evident from what has to be said respecting the
outflow of floods at the mouth of the Yarra, will enable persons
of ordinary intelligence to judge correctly of the modes of dealing
with the floods which arc proposed to be considered in this
chapter.
The floods which pass under the Chapel-street bridge being the
drainage off about a million acres of country, and the whole of it
during the flood of 1863 reaching Melbourne within the time in
which it did reach that city, it is evident therefrom that the flow
of it must have been everywhere very rapid, and very rapid
indeed through all valleys as narrow as that which lies between
South Yarra and Richmond, but the Chapel-street bridge which
had been erected across that valley presented, by its piers and
approaches, lateral obstructions to the flow of floods which, in
1863, caused the extra rise, already mentioned, of seven feet on
the upper side of the bridge by which an extra velocity was
caused, which then, and not till then, sufficed for carrying the
flood water through the water-way of the bridge as fast as it
came down from the country above, but in the fairway above the
bridge the flow was in no way obstructed, and its water would,
without any other agency than its own already acquired momen-
tum, pass through the bridge with the same velocity as that by
which it had reached it; but another agency came into operation
here, namely, the hydrostatic pressure ot seven feet caused by the
seven feet extra rise above the bridge, and this would accelerate
the velocity of the flow of water through the bridge from its
surface down to the bottom of the river. But here it has to be
considered, as in the case of the outflow of the floods into the
bay, how is the flow of water through the bridge affected by that
which at the time is occupying the water-way below it? Below the
bridge, in times of flood, the water passes from it with very little
decrease of the velocity with which it has passed through it,


and each quantity that passes makes room rapidly for that which
has next to follow, and the effect of this would be very consider-
able if nothing but acquired momentum and the absence of
obstructions contributed to it, but the flood of 1863 was not more
than six chains wide at the lower side of Chapel-street bridge, and
within half a mile, namely, at the Punt-road, it spread out to a
width of about three furlongs, which of necessity did much for the
maintenance of acquired momentum. But, to form a correct
judgment of the relative facilities for the flow of flood water
through the Chapel-street bridge and out at the mouth of the
Yarra, the width and depth of both passages have to be considered,
as well as the causes on which depend the velocity of current at
both places. In 1863 the depth of the Yarra under the middle of
the Chapel-street bridge at ordinary summer level was twenty-
five feet, but it is now two feet less, in consequence of the falls at
Melbourne having since then been lowered two feet, and the space
between the piers of the bridge at their base on the banks, nine
feet and a-half higher than the then summer level of the river, is
three chains, or 198 feet; but the width of the river between the
piers is reduced fifteen feet on the north side by a towing-path of
that width, constructed with pile planking filled in with earth, and,
allowing half-a-chain as the width of the towing-path by way of
compensation for taking the depth at twenty-five feet across the
whole width of the river under the bridge, which will be much
more than an adequate compensation, the transverse vertical section
of the river there at the summer level of 1863 will be 4125 square
or superficial feet.
The width of the river at its mouth is a little more than a
quarter of a mile, and the greatest depth at that part at spring
tide low water level w 7 as in 1864 twelve feet. These dimensions
are shown by the survey made by Commander H. L. Cox, R.N.,
in that year, but the twelve feet depth is the result of artificial
deepening for the passage of shipping ; and, taking the other
soundings across that part, for which I have no other guide than
Commander Cox’s map, it is evident that the mean depth across
the mouth is less than five feet; but, taking it at five feet, and
the width at a quarter of a mile, this would give the transverse-
vertical section as 6600 square or superficial feet, which show r s
the transverse vertical section of the river at summer level under
Chapel-street bridge in 1863 and 1864 to be rather less than two-
thirds of the similar section at the mouth of the Yarra. But the
mouth of the Yarra gives passage for the waters both of the Yarra
and Saltwater Kiver, but the proportions which these sections
bear each to the other is only of importance for the purpose of this
Essay from each forming a part of larger dimensions, the com-
parisons of which are of the greatest importance in dealing with the
matters under consideration.


Returning to the river at the Chapel-street bridge, the trans-
verse-vertical section of it at summer level in 1863 and 1864 (the
lowering of the falls at Melbourne has been effected since the
latter year) was, according to the estimate which has been made,
which is certainly something below the truth, 4125 square or
superficial feet; the bank at the part under the north end of the
bridge (the artificial towing-path) was nine feet and a-half above
that level, and, taking the width across at the level of that bank
as the same as that taken as the width at the water’s surface,
namely, two chains and a-half, or 165 feet, this will give a
transverse-vertical section from the level of the towing-path to
the bottom of the river of 5692 J square or superficial feet. The
width from the base of one pier to the base of the other at the
level of the towing-path is just three chains, hut the face of each
pier on the side towards the river is eighteen inches out of the
perpendicular at the height of nine feet from the base, the
inclination being away from the river, which gives a mean width
of that part of 199| feet, thereby adding 1795£ square or super-
ficial feet to the transverse-vertical section, which gives that
section, from the bottom of the river to the height of nine feet
above the towing-path, as 7488 square or superficial feet; but the
whole height of the flood of 1863 on the lower side of the bridge
was but three inches more than the last-named height, and the
distance between the piers—which rise perpendicularly from the
last-named point—being 201 feet, this will add one-fourth ol
that number of square or superficial feet to the already
accounted for, and, taking the fourth at fifty, this will make
the transverse-vertical section of the flood of 1863 in the plane
of the lower or west face of the piers of the bridge, and down to
the bottom of the river to have been 7538 square or superficial
feet. The facts just stated are a part but not the whole of those
which are concerned in what has been stated at the 21st page
hereof as to the conditions which, at the Chapel-street bridge,
conspire to cause a greater flow of water under that bridge than
the outflow at the mouth of the_ Yarra, the most important point
for comparison of the two being the causes which come into
operation at both places as soon as there is any more than the
ordinary quantity of water passing. At the mouth of the river
all outflow below sea level is retarded by the inertia of the water
which occupies the space into which the water of the river has to
flow, and, whilst that in the river and that in the bay are at the
same level, there can be no flow in either direction; but when
that in the river has attained a higher level than that in the bay,
however small the difference may be, the former, by its own
gravitation only, begins to flow to the same level as the latter.
This is a fact well known, and only needs to be mentioned for the
purpose of showing wherein consists the difference between the
motive force on which it depends, and that on which depends the
motion of the water which lies below the sea level.


As has just been stated the water in the river, which occupies
a higher level than that in the bay, flows out to the latter solely
by the force of its own gravitation ; but the water in the river,,
which lies at and below sea level, has no tendency to flow by the
direct action of gravitation only; every part of it, from top to bottom,
being counterpoised foot by foot and inch by inch by the water in
the bay, which lies at the same level, and the only motive force by
which outflow is given to it is the pressure of the higher water
which lies on it, technically called hydrostatic pressure, and this
is a force which always bears direct proportion to the height or
level from which it acts, and as motive forces, according to the
laws of dynamics, always impart velocity to bodies on which they
act in inverse proportion to the mass or quantity of matter acted
on, it follows, that whatever be the hydrostatic pressure caused
by any height of flood at Melbourne, and whatever be the velocity
imparted to the water occupying any depth of the river below sea
level in the bay, the hydrostatic pressure would only impart half
the velocity to water of double the depth, and double the velocity
to water of half the depth, and the same inverse proportion to all
other variations. But it may be asked: Does not the current of
the water which lies above sea level produce a current in that
which lies below the level? My first answer to this is, that till
the flood waters have nearly reached the mouth of the Yarra
there is no more of such a current in the four-thousand-acre
basin, occupied by the floods on the south and west sides of Mel-
bourne, than there is in the lake of Constance from the flow of the
Rhine through it, or in the lake of Geneva from the flow of the
Rhone through it. There are very large and strong eddies, as I
saw during the flood of 1866, but these are always caused by the
force with which flood waters descend from the valley of the
Yarra and the valley of the Saltwater river; and were a large
number of floating bodies to be thrown into these valleys
during such floods as those of 1863 and 1866, and suitable nets
placed at the mouth of the Yarra to intercept the passage of
any into the bay, but few of them would be found in the nets,
and most of them would be found to have drifted to some
parts of the margin of the floods and left there by the sub-
sidence of the waters; but if a current of the kind referred to
did exist, its effect would be nil in expediting the total outflow
of the floods, for whatever momentum a body in motion imparts
to a body at rest, or to a body moving at a less velocity, just
the same amount of momentum is lost from the body imparting
the momentum as is gained by the body to which it is
imparted; and if these be facts the folly is apparent of cutting
a channel to a great depth below sea level for the escape of
floods, and the equal folly of cutting a deep channel for the
passage of shipping wider than would be required for shipping
to pass.


The proposal to cut a channel, both wide and deep, direct
from Melbourne to Hobson’s Bay has all the objections just
suggested, but they all become greater when considered with
reference to such a channel from Melbourne to any part near
the mouth of the river and within the mouth ; and objections
arise with reference to the latter, some of which do not apply
at all, and others but limited by the former. A cut direct from
the Yarra, a little to the south-west of Melbourne, into Hob-
son’s Bay, which is what ought to be done, but done for
shipping only, and only of the width required for ships to
pass, would be less than half the length ot the cut
to be made from Melbourne to the inner side of the mouth ot
the river, and the. former, however narrow it might be, would
give some additional space for the outflow of flood water; but
the latter, however wide, would do but little, if anything, of
the kind, as I think anyone will see who only observes the
distance (more than two miles) from the of the
Saltwater river to the mouth of the Yarra, and the width and
course of that part of the Yarra, and also becomes aware that
during such floods as those of 1863 and 1866, the whole length
of the east bank of that part of the river is deeply submerged.
From all these conditions it follows that, with a very rapid
outflow from that part of the river—which, in reality, cannot
be very rapid, owing to the narrowness of the mouth and the
low level of the water) a very sluggish flow from east to west
across its east bank, would keep as much of the flood water
at the mouth of the river as could possibly find a way out
there, and if so, there can be no utility in making a channel
for the passage of flood w r ater to the mouth when nature has
already provided for as much getting to that part as can
possibly get away from it.
To commence a channel at a point where the flood waters
have got to a state of rest, as they do at the south bank of
the Yarra, below the falls, except such motion as results from
the eddies already noticed in this chapter, and to neglect an
opportunity, where one offers, of commencing a channel for the
purpose at a point at which the flood current has attained
great velocity, and flows in the direction of the place for final
discharge is—unless such a point for commencement would
require a much greater length of channel—a most unwise
neglect of a facility which nature has afforded for accomplish-
ing the desired purpose; but with this point I shall have to
deal more fully in the next chapter, which will be to
an explanation of what I recommend as a method of carrying
off the floods, and shall make no further remarks thereon here
than that the channel which I propose will be shorter than the
one proposed to be cut to the mouth of the Yarra, though longer
than one that may be cut direct from Melbourne to the bay.


Before dismissing the part of the subject to which this chapter
has been devoted, it will be desirable to draw one other
■comparison between the conditions which exist in times of flood
at the mouth of the Yarra, and those which exist at the same
time at the Chapel-street bridge. This comparison will, I believe,
afford the means for estimating the value of the outflow of the
floods at the mouth, as a means of keeping it open, which I
believe to he almost nil.
Before the falls at Melbourne were lowered the Yarra under
the Chapel-street bridge at summer level was twenty-five feet
deep, and on the lower side of that bridge the flood of 1863 rose
eighteen feet nine inches above that level. As I have already
said, I have found it to be impossible to ascertain to what height
it rose on the upper side of the bridge, but I have given good
reasons for feeling sure that the difference of height on the two
sides could not have been so little as seven feet, but for want of
accurate information I take that as the difference, and this will
give forty-three feet nine inches as the total depth to the bottom of
the river on the lower side of the bridge, and fifty feet nine inches
as the depth on the upper side. These being the depths of water
the next matters for consideration are the causes of velocity, and
most of these have been sufficiently explained in what has been
said in the 22nd, 23rd, 24th, and 25th pages of this essay. It has
been argued, but how correctly others must judge, that as the
whole drainage off about a million of acres of country during the
floods of 1863 and 1866, flowed to and passed through the
Chapel-street bridge, the flow through the narrow valley to the
the bridge must have been very rapid, and the flow through and
from the bridge very rapid, too; and comparisons were made
between the causes of velocity which operated there, and those
which operated at the mouth of the Yarra, all of which will be
found in a few of the preceding pages; but one comparison
which was not made there, and the one which is now required to
be made, is the velocity of the flow of the water above the bridge,
which in its flow descends to the level of that below the bridge,
and the effects of the rapid fall there, with the probable velocity
of flow from the flood level at Melbourne to the level of the
waters of the bay, and its probable effects.
The rapids consequent on the seven feet fall from the east to
the west side of Chapel-street bridge, of course have a perceptible
commencement before the water has reached the line of the east
face of the bridge, but the greater the velocity of current in the
fairway above the bridge, the shorter will be the distance from
the east or upper side of the bridge at which the rapids will
perceptibly commence; and, considering the rapid flow there
must have been in the fairway above the bridge during the flood
of 1863, the perceptible commencement of the rapids would be
scarcely thirty feet above the bridge, and this added to the


thirty-six feet distance, through it would make seven feet
in the distance of a chain ; and ascertained effects give reason for
considering this estimate to be very close to the truth. For I have
recently taken sounding under the Chapel-street bridge, and
about a chain’s length below it, finding the depth at the former
point to be twenty-three feet, and at the latter twenty-eight and
a half feet. Now considering how nearly straight this part of
the river is, and how nearly equal at every part is the width of
it for a long distance, it is certain that this sudden change of
depth was no operation of nature prior to the erection of the
bridge, and equally certain that it must have been the effect of
the floods of 1863 and 1866, in both of which floating bodies in
the fairway above the bridge came downwards very rapidly with
the current, but on arriving at the point where the rapids became
perceptible, they must have passed with something like arrow-
like velocity from that point to the lower side of the bridge.
This rapid rush of the water through the bridge was the came of
this sudden increase of depth, which on the subsidence of the
flood of 1866, must have been greater than it now is, for it is
certain that the hollow in the bed of the river thus formed must
be progressively filling up by deposit from the waters of the
river, and in the absence of floods will continue to do so till that
part is brought to the same mean level as the bottom of the
river above and below it.
In comparing the outflow of floods at the mouth of the river
with the flow of them through the Chapel-street bridge, I will
again remark that there are no appreciable or perceptible currents
in the four thousand acre area of flood till the current by which
the flood waters descend to the level of the waters of the bay, at
the mouth of the river, has become perceptible, the eddies, twice
already mentioned, which do nothing to produce a scour at the
mouth of the river, nor anything to carry off floods of course
excepted. As the waters of the flood of 1863 were, as far as all
motions on which their escape to the sea depended, stagnant for
a distance of more than three miles from the mouth of the Yarra,
the perceptible commencement of the rapids (if the term rapids
be admissible to a flow as slow as the flow there must have been)
would certainly be a very great distance farther from the river s
mouth than the perceptible commencement of those at the Chapel-
street bridge was above that bridge; and whilst a fall of seven
feet in the distance of a chain under that bridge, together with
all the other causes for rapid flow under it would did scour
away the bottom of the river to a greater depth than its present
twenty-eight and a half feet, the perceptible commencements of
the rapids, or of the current towards the mouth of the river,
would be so distant therefrom and the fall so small in proportion
to the distance, that there would be no appreciable scour. ihe
maximum fall at the lowest state of tide in the bay was thirteen


feet five inches, and there can be no doubt that the perceptible
current resulting therefrom commenced at as great a distance as
half a mile from the mouth of the river, and no scour of any
value could result from such a current. My own conviction is
that the flood of 1863 did not carry away, and that no such flood
ever will carry away from the mouth of the river as much of the
obstructions to navigation that exist, and are continually forming
there, as might be removed by a dredge in one day. There is a
fact which, if ascertained, will completely set this point at rest,
which is the possibility or impossibility of a man rowing a boat
from the bay on to the flood through the mouth of the river,
which any expert boatman would have been able to do when the
flood of 1863 was at its greatest height, if the rapids were as
unrapid as they would have been had they perceptibly commenced
as far as half a mile from the mouth of the river; and surely the
withdrawal therefrom of such a scour as this, lasting as it does
for a few days only, and occurring on an average less frequently
than once in seven years, could not be the cause of much injury
thereto. A much greater scour than this would not be of sufficient
utility to be worthy of forming a part of any estimates in this
matter.
CHAPTER Y.
An explanation of the method hy which the author of this Essay
proposes to deal with the floods at Melbourne.
I have already acknowledged that since I commenced writing
I have discovered that I was in error as to the course of the flood
current in the vicinity of the Botanical Gardens, and I have reason
to believe that the course of it in other parts, as shown on the
map, hereto annexed, is not perfectly correct, but there are no
inaccuracies that in any way materially affect the matters under
consideration. What is required to be understood to judge
correctly of all that has been proposed to be done by most who
have suggested anything on the subject, and by any whose
suggestions have for any reason been worth consideration is,
firstly, the rate of current through the Chapel-street bridge and
its causes; secondly, the small area of land which the floods of
the Yarra occupy from the bridge just mentioned to the St. Kilda-
road, and the consequent rapidity of their flow through that part;
thirdly, the great rapidity of the flow of floods through the
narrow passage between Flinders-street and the Immigrants’
Home, by which the floods which have occurred during many


have formed the lagoon on the east side of the St. Kilda-
road, the flood of 1863 washing away the road material there to
a depth which allowed the fence to be carried away with it, the
width of that passage being now contracted to less than its
natural width by the south approaches to Prince’s Bridge and
other artificial erections; and fourthly, the flow of the flood-
waters after they have passed the St. Kilda-road into a basin of
four thousand acres extent, formed by a ridge five miles long,
reaching from St. Kilda to the mouth of the Yarra, in which,
owing to the very wide expansion of the waters all perceptible
current was lost, except at the mouth of the river and at the
mouth of the Sandridge lagoon, and the eddies ■ caused by the
rapid downflow of the floods from the valley of the Yarra and the
valley of the Saltwater River, the eddies doing nothing to aid
flood outflow. These four conditions are required to be known to
understand the whole subject, but the two last are all that will
be concerned in the explanation, which will next follow, of what
I propose to be done for the prevention of floods at Melbourne
and for improving the Port.
If the map hereto annexed be referred to, it will be seen that I
propose, for the prevention of that portion of the floods at Mel-
bourne which consists of the flood waters from the watershed of
the Yarra, that a channel for its escape shall commence at that
point where the flow of it is excessively rapid between Flinders-
street and the Immigrants’ Home, that it shall be carried in a
straight line to a point where a curve will be required round the
north and west sides of Sandridge; and I believe that at the
present time there are but few buildings that stand in the way of
its being so carried, and all there are, stand on land on which
leases of short currency only have been granted, that it shall be
of uniformly expanding width through its whole length, and that
its depth at every part shall be two feet below low water level,
reasons for all of which I shall next proceed to give.
Why I propose commencing the channel at the point shown on
the map is, that the flood waters reach that point in a state of
very rapid motion by which, as has already been said, the floods
of many centuries have formed the lagoon there, and the flood of
1863 washed away the road material to a depth that caused the
fences to be carried away with it; and why I propose the direc-
tion in which the channel is shown is, that it is the same as that
in which the flood current has reached that point, and therefore
that in which there will be no check to its velocity from distortion
of its course—both of which highly favouring conditions for
rapid escape are entirely wanting in every project that has been
propounded for providing an outlet for the floods which has its
commencement farther down the river—all current there having
ceased, except mere eddies and gravitation, being the only force
on which outflowing motion there depends, and gravitation is a


very feeble force where the gravitating matter has to move
through a distance of three miles to attain a fall of twelve feet.
Why I propose that the channel should expand in width is, that
whatever may he the velocity with which the flood waters enter
it, they will lose velocity by attrition against its sides and bottom,,
and losing velocity they will require greater space through which
to flow, and in one of two ways, or partly in one w r ay and partly
in the other, they will gain that space, that is inevitable, and if
the expansion of the channel be sufficient, they will spread out to
it without any rise of their surface, but if not, their surface will
rise, and will (what is called) tail back from which will follow a
rise of the floods on the part whence they have flowed, and how
much of this may be allowed is merely a matter of pounds,
shillings, and pence, for in engineering, as in most other things,
the maxim that “ gold may be bought too dear ” holds; and here
I must remark that I do not now profess to give exact details,
having done no more of surveying and other preliminary opera-
tions in engineering than is required to show what are the kind
of works that will be required without giving the exact details
of any. The depth to which I propose that the bottom of the
channel shall reach below low water level is a matter, the expla-
nation of which will better suit a future chapter, in which the
Port of Melbourne will be considered.
Proposals have been made for cutting a channel for the twofold
purpose of carrying off floods, and for the passage of shipping
for the former purpose one to a width of three hundred and
another to five hundred feet, and for the latter purpose, the
former of the two to a depth of twelve feet below low water level,
to be increased in depth as other parts are deepened, and the
latter to a depth at once of twenty-five feet below low water
level. Now at the former of these depths, just half of the whole
depth in the flood of 1863 would have been counterpoised by the
same depth of water in the bay, and the only flow of that which
lay below the level of the waters of the bay would be that which
was caused by the supernatant flood water, which would have but
very little effect on anything that lay many feet below sea level,
and in the case of the depth of twenty-five feet, five-sevenths of
the whole depth would, in such a flood, be in that position.
By the map it will be seen that I propose a width of eight
chains for the head of the flood channel, and a width of sixteen
chains for its debouchure at the beach, but the suitable width at
either place cannot be accurately determined till it be known
what, in superficial or square feet, was the vertical section of the
flood of 1863 in the line where it was narrowed, between
Flinders-street and the Immigrants’ Home, and, fortunately, this
fact can be easily ascertained by a mark made by Mr. FitzOibbon
on a tree, which is still standing, recording the height to which
that flood rose there.


For purposes which relate to the Port of Melbourne, I advise,
absolutely and unqualifiedly, that the bottom of the flood channel
should be two feet lower than ordinary low water level, and for
the sake of avoiding all increase of the height of flood above the
Immigrants’ Home by the tailing back of the waters in the
channel, another line of level should be taken two feet lower than
the mark on the tree just referred to, and when the difference in
feet of these two levels has been ascertained, the vertical section
of the flood of 1863, where it was narrowed between Flinders-
street and the Immigrants’ Home, taken in superficial or square
feet, and divided by that difference, will give in linear feet the
proper width for the head of the channel. I give the foregoing
suggestions subject to such variations as may be suggested by the
maxim “ that gold may be bought too dear,” for when all the
cost has been incurred of preventing floods on the immensely
valuable property in Flinders-street and other parts near thereto,
and the channel has been made deep enough and wide enough to
receive and contain the quantity of tidal water which will be the
portion which it must contribute to the whole quantity of that
water that will be required for scouring the entrance for shipping
to the Port, and the tailing back of the flood waters be then
found to in any degree increase the height of flood in the
direction towards Richmond (an effect which, at the worst, will
be very small,) it may be less costly to liberally compensate any
who may suffer injury, than to incur the cost of preventing the
injury, and a few hours surveying will settle the question of
what ought to be done with reference to this part of the matter.
In the map, the debouchure of the channel is shown as sixteen
chains wide, but from recent observation, and principally in the
interest of the Port of Melbourne, as will hereafter be seen, I am
now of opinion that its width should not be less than twenty
chains, with the same kind of expansion thereto as that shown:
on the map. The channel must be embanked on both sides, and
to provide for the greatest possible magnitude of flood, the top of
the embankments should not be less than two feet higher than
the mark on the tree which was made by Mr. Fitz Gibbon in
1863.
What has been suggested, if carried into execution as suggested,
cannot possibly fail to prevent as much of the floods on the south
and west sides of Melbourne as the valleys of the Rivers Plenty
and Yarra contribute thereto, but whether or not nature has
sufficiently provided against floods at Melbourne from the floods
of the Saltwater River remains to be seen. lam of opinion that
she has, and that Melbourne will never be flooded after that which
I have already proposed has been put into execution; but to decide
this point, one fact only has to be considered, namely: what is
the area of country that drains into the Saltwater River ? The
line due north from Melbourne to the ridge of the dividing


range, thirty miles long, which has been taken as the west
boundary of the country which is drained by the Rivers Plenty
and Yarra, is also the east boundary of the country which is
drained by the Saltwater River, and another line reaching to
thirty miles from Melbourne, at an angle of sixty degrees from
that line, will, with the segment of a circle of thirty miles radius,
extending from one of those lines at its farther end from
Melbourne to the farther end from Melbourne of the other,
surround and include an area of country which, though not
exactly coinciding in figure, very closely approximates both in
extent and form to the country which is drained by the Saltwater
River. The correctness of the line to the north from Melbourne
as a boundary between the drainage into the River Plenty and
the drainage'into the Saltwater River has already been pointed
out at page 20. The part of the dividing range which lies
between the farther ends of the two lines is sufficiently near to a
segment of a circle of thirty miles radius to be fairly taken as
such, and the creeks which flow into the west side of the
Saltwater River, viewed in conjunction with those that flow into
the River Werribee, show that the second of the two lines just
mentioned may be taken as sufficiently accurately marking the
line of country which divides the di’ainage into the Saltwater
River from the drainage into the River Werribee, and these two
lines, with the" segment of a circle connecting their two ends,
contain an area of country of 215,406 acres, which is but a little
more than a sixth of the whole country, the drainage from which
causes the floods at Melbourne; and, from this, I think it cannot
fail to be seen that the floods from the valley of the Saltwater
River alone can never fill to the level of its banks that part of
the Yarra which lies below the confluence of the Saltwater River,
and, if not, no flood can ever occur at Melbourne, except the
well-known and speedily evanescent street floods, after the flood
channel has been constructed in the manner herein described.
CHAPTER VI.
The River Yarra considered in its relation to the Port of
Melbourne.
To induce a due appreciation of the extreme unfitness of the
river Yarra for forming any part of the system of the Port of
Melbourne, and the importance of excluding it almost entirely
therefrom, requires a comparison of it with other rivers, and I
know none so well suited for the comparison as the River Clyde,


the immense difference between the quantity of perennial water
which flows in the Yarra and that which flows in the Clyde being
the subject of comparison. There are other British rivers, the
perennial waters of which exceed in quantity those of the
Clyde, and I have no doubt that those of the Thames, and
also those of the Severn do; but neither of the latter
streams affords to a common observer the means for so well
estimating at a glance what their magnitude may be, as is
afforded on the Clyde by the Bennington Falls, the Cora
Linn, and the Stonebiers Fall. The art of writing graphic
descriptions is not one of my accomplishments, and therefore, to
aid me under that deficiency, I quote the following extract from
a description of the Clyde which I happen to have at hand. “It
affords many romantic views, running for several miles between
lofty eminences covered with wood, and exhibiting in its course
many stupendous cataracts.” The Stonebiers Fall (one of the
cataracts referred to) being the lowest down the course of the
Clyde, of course has all the perennial waters of the river which
flow in it down to that point passing over it. But I never saw
that fall; I intended to see it, but the time at my command did
not allow of my doing so; but I saw Cora Linn, the next fall
above it, and to me, who had never seen Niagara, it did indeed
appear stupendous, although the whole waters of the Clyde do not
pass over it there as they do at Stonebiers, a considerable portion
of them having been diverted from a point above the Cora Linn to
the New Lanark cotton-mills, for motive power and other
purposes. Nevertheless, this robbery of the Cora Linn still left
it looking stupendous, and the whole of the waters were then
perennial, no surface drainage, for it w r as in the month of June,
after an unusually dry spring.
As most persons for whose information I write are aware, the
Port of Glasgow is situate abput eighteen miles from the mouth
of the Clyde, at the upper end of the tidal portion of the river,
where the fresh water, instead of the brackish tidal water, is
required for its cotton manufactures. Till quite the end of last
century a place called Port Glasgow, at the mouth of the river,
was the port at which all exports from Glasgow were shipped,
and where all its imports were landed ; but about that time was
commenced a deepening of the Clyde between the two places, the
progress of which has led to the largest ships in the world being
built at Glasgow. Although Glasgow has a splendid supply of
river water by the Clyde, as compared with the supply to
Melbourne by the Yarra, I think that those who are mostly
interested in its port, and actively concerned in and acquainted
with it, would (if they could have had such a choice) have given
a very decided preference to a ship canal from the sea to Glasgow
of less than a third of the length of the navigation by the Clyde,
but, unlike those who have had to deal with the Port of


Melbourne, they had no such choice ; what they did was a matter
of necessity, and to them—except on the score of cost of construction
and length of navigation—not a very serious necessity, considering
how much less the waters of the Clyde at Glasgow resemble those
of a common sewer than do those of the Yarra at Melbourne ; and
the latter are becoming more and more of that character as the
current of the river diminishes in rate of flow by the deepening
and widening of its waterway. But there are frequently recurring
seasons, of several months’ duration, in which there is no other
current in the Yarra at Melbourne than that which results from
the flow and ebb of tide, and the cause of this, which is but very
imperfectly understood by many of those whose colonial career
has been confined to Melbourne, requires explanation.
The perennial waters of the Yarra, as I believe, of all the other
rivers of the colony, flow only from springs nearly at the ridges of
lofty ranges, and near the summits of high, conical-shaped hills or
mountains. How it is that springs of sufficient strength to cause
a flow from the points at which they rise exist in this colony only
at such points as those just described, and why all others are so
few and far between, and are capable of no more than maintaining
a moisture of the soil for the distance of a few feet around them,
are questions which those more learned in geology than I am must
answer; but so arid is this colony, and so dependent on surface
drainage fur a sufficient supply and storage of water, that I believe
that, if every drop of truly perennial water of the colony could be
made to flow to one point, and there fall over such a precipice as
that over which the Cora Linn falls, the whole of it would be
insufficient to produce the counterpart of that cataract. But
what the Yarra is as to the conditions just described is all that
concerns my purposes. The most remote of its tributaries, as I
have already stated, rises near the summit of Mount Baw-
Baw, and the last, which flows into it above its confluence
with the Kiver Plenty, is one which has its rise on the east
side of that Uandenong range on which stands the northern
Trigonometrical Station; this last, I believe, is called the Brushy
Creek, but what its name, or whether it be the last, is by no
means material, the matter requiring to be here understood being,
that none of them are more than mere rivulets, and when the
winter rains have ceased and the face of the country has, by
evaporation, acquired its ordinary summer dryness, then the
whole of the waters from these rivulets is unequal to the quantity
absorbed by the soil at the banks of the river, and before the tidal
part of the river is reached the current of it ceases, and ceases,,
except in wet summers, for several months. Whenever there is
any noticeable current in the Yarra more than nineteen twentieths
of its water must be surface drainage, and less than a twentieth
perennial water; at the best of times it is in a filthy state of
pollution, and during dry seasons no better than a common sewer,.


in fact, very little but sewerage in it, and as it is widened and
deepened the diminished interchange of its waters with those of
the bay consequent on tidel action, will cause its condition to
become much worse than it is now.
The effect on a tidal dock, of what has just been described, is
the last point that has to be considered in reference to the Yarra
that has any bearing on the subject of the Port of Melbourne. In
the tidal part of the river tidal action, together with other con-
stantly recurring causes of commotion, would cause the water at
the surface to hold in a state of suspension a not much less
quantity of silt than that similarly held in the water near the
bottom and into a tidal dock fed therefrom, as large a proportion
of silt would flow with the tide as that which was contained in
the river outside of it; but in the still water of the dock the silt
would subside rapidly—a very little of it would remain in the
surface water at the commencement of the ebb, and as the ebb
would be mostly, if not entirely, from the surface, very little of
the silt that had entered with the flow would ever get out again
by any other means than dredging, and the amount of dredging
that now has to be done, great as it is, is small in comparison
with what it will be if the river and a tidal dock fed from it be
made of the depth and area required for all the shipping that
trades to Melbourne. Sanatory considerations are of very great
importance in this matter, but they constitute a distinct subject
too large for me to enter on here.
CHAPTER VII.
description of the method proposed hy the author for the con-
struction of a Dock and Ship Canal at Melbourne , in ivhich
there ivill be no need for dredging; and a description of a
method for keeping the entrance open to the sea.
So much of the subject matter of this chapter is shown so
plainly on the map that much will not need to be said here.
The deviation of the Sandridge railway is shown as a thing that
may be desirable to be done in the interest of most that will be
affected by the port being taken from Hobson’s Baj r , but by no
means necessary to be done if the impediments to it are such as to
throw any great difficulties in the way of it. All the railways of
the colony, except The Melbourne and Hobson’s Bay United
Railway Company’s property, being State property, few can be
of opinion that that property ought not to become State property


too, if the purchase of it can be effected on fair and reasonable
terms, and when the port is brought to Melbourne, and the rail-
way pier has ceased to be of any use the site for the terminus
shown on the map, will be much more convenient for most of the
people of Sandridge than the present railway station, and the port
being taken away from the bay will not affect Sandridge as badly
as some suppose ; in one respect it has an advantage over every
other place on Port Phillip Bay, in the sun’s rays never being
reflected on to it from the water, by which its residents are
spared the double scorching caused by the united action of the
direct and reflected rays so overpowering in the morning on the
west side, and in the afternoon on the east side, of Port Phillip
Bay, and a reproduction of the foliage of which it has been so
completely denuded, would soon bring the seekers for health and
pleasure it. The population of Sandridge would undergo
considerable change, but in a short time no considerable
diminution;
I have, as will be seen by the map, indicated the south side of
the Yarra as more suitable for a tidal dock than the north side ;
the objections to the latter being those set forth in the last
chapter, whilst one situate on the south side would get all its
w 7 ater from the clear waters of the bay, except a very small
quantity that would be passed into it by locking from the part of
the river just below the falls, and preferring that side for the
reasons stated, I have shown a dock of forty acres extent in the
triangular space, which lies between the south side of the
Yarra and the Hobson’s Bay railway, that being the site where
access to it from the principal mercantile establishments will
be a shorter mean distance than to one situate at any other
practicable point; but apart from the question of proximity to
the principal places of business, any other part of the south side
of the Yarra would be quite as suitable. A small quantity of turbid
water from the bay would, during the continuance of freshes, enter
with the flow of tide into the canal, but heavy freshes are not of
frequent occurrence, and although the bay, as a whole, when seen
from the shore, has a very turbid appearance, during their con-
tinuance small quantities of its water in transparent vessels have
something like a crystal clearness when compared with the water
of the Yarra, in its clearest state, placed in the same kind of
vessels; one looks like water at the worst of times, the other
little better than mud when at its best, and at every lockage,
either way between the river and the dock (there being, as is
shown on the map by the words “ ship lock,” though the litho-
grapher has omitted to show the lock gates, a short canal with a
lock between the two,) turbid water will flow from the river into
the dock, but the matter which is suspended in the water will
subside at the head of the dock, and would scarcely in ages accu-
mulate to any depth or extend far from the gates of the lock,.


When no wind ripples were on the surface of the water, the
bottom of both would be as distinctly seen as that of any inland
bay of the same depth in any part of the world.
On the short canal referred to in the parenthesis near the end
of the last paragraph, it will be seen by the map that I propose
that a swivel or swing bridge shall be constructed across it, which
will provide a road to both ends, and to the north-west side of
the dock, and to all parts to the west of the dock and canal that
lie between the river and Hobson’s Ray, and I propose that the
lock on that short canal shall be made to raise the water in the
river a few inches, and a few inches only above ordinary high
water level, which alone it would not do, but in addition to it I
propose that a dam shall be constructed across the river a little
below the Gas Works, and at this dam there must be a by-wash,
which should be made to carry more water at any given depth of
water on it than now flow over the falls at the same given
depth of water on them, and no excess can be too great that can
be attained without great extra expense or some other objection-
able consequence and through this dam there must be a Jock, if
it be necessary, to preserve the navigation from Footscray to
Melbourne. The overfall of the dam must be that height above
ordinary high water level as that at which it is designed to
maintain the water in the river above it. The dam should be no
higher than has been proposed, as all unnecessary height would
needlessly increase the quantity of turbid water which at each
lockage would pass from the river into the dock; but, on the
other hand, wlienever tide in the dock rose much higher than
ordinary high water level, both the head and tail gates of the
lock would open, causing a free communication of the waters of
the river with those of the dock, and although there would be no
current from the river into the dock, yet the strong disposition,
which w aters in contact have to blend, would cause some of the
turbid water of the river to pass into the dock, and the lock gates
thus opened would not close of tliemselves, as no current would
ever arise of sufficient force to start the closing motion, but a
man must be kept constantly at the swing bridge, and a part of
his duty should be to keep the lock gates nearly closed whilst
tide water w-as passing from the dock into the river, and to com-
pletely close them as soon as the tide had ceased to flow.
The next part requiring explanation is the works in Hobson’s
Bay which extend beyond the mouth of the canal and the outflow
of the flood channel. The scale of the map being four inches to
a mile, it will be seen that a pier, sixty-two chains long and a
chain and a half wide, extends in a south-westerly direction into
the bay from the east side of the outfall of the flood channel, and
that a narrower pier extends forty-five chains into the bay, in a
southerly direction, from a point to the west of the mouth of the
ship canal, the outer end of it forming an opening with the other


pier, a chain and a half wide, for the entrance of shipping into
the space which they enclose, and thence into the ship canal and
dock. The longer pier may be constructed with a walling of
timber, filled in with earth taken from some convenient part of
the excavations, and the other may be similarly made at both
ends, and is so represented in the map, but being completely
sheltered from all violence, both of wind and water, a timber
groin throughout its whole length would be sufficiently strong,
but the middle part, marked “ sluices,” should be entirely of
timber. The scale of the map is altogether too small to allow of
the construction of these sluices being shown, but the wdrole range
of them, as will be seen by the map, is intended to occupy a
length of twenty-two chains, by which a clear water-way of
twenty chains may be afforded after the necessary allowance has
been made for the space occupied by the thickness of the sluices,
and the width or thickness of the necessary number of upright
jambs. It is designed that the sluices should reach to a depth of
ten feet below low water level; that they should be a hundred
and eighty in number, each sluice seven feet four inches wide,
plus its thickness; that ail should open and close by a quarter
rotation on a vertical axis at the middle of the width of each
sluice, and from what I know of the ease with which heavy lock
gates on rivers and canals can be opened and closed, I know that
such sluices may be geared together, in sets of three, by bars
similar to the side rods of luggage locomotive engines, connecting
each set of three by means of cranks of equal length, one fixed
on the head of the axis of each sluice, and by a lever projecting
from the middle sluice of each set, one man will easily open or
close the whole range of them in less time than an hour. These
sluices must all be kept open during the continuance of floods, as
also must those at the head of the flood channel, but the latter,
for which water tightness will be required, must be made to be
raised and lowered by rack and pinion, and must only be open
during floods, whilst those in the bay are designed to be opened at
low water, and kept open during the flow of tide, and closed at
high water, and kept closed during the ebb, thereby allowing
more than four hundred acres of tide water in the flood channel,
canal, and dock, to enter through twenty-one chains and a half
width of space, and ebb through the chain and a half width of
opening provided for the passage of shipping. I feel quite sure
that the opening and closing of these sluices will not need to be
repeated at every tide, and 1 do not believe it will be necessary to
be done so frequently as once daily. It has been said, and said
most positively, that no entrance for shipping can be kept open at
the beach, but no reason why has been assigned, and I feel quite
sure that, for the reasons stated in my original project, a part of
which is shown by the wood engraving in the margin of an early
part of this essay, would have done it, but in the next chapter I


«hall show by phenomena, which are always to be seen in Hob-
son’s Bay, that a fortiori, what I now propose to be done, cannot
fail to accomplish the object. One gentleman has said that the
part of a canal which would be under sea level outside the beach
would, in some states of wind and waves, fill up with sand in one
night more than could be removed by dredging in a month.
That is quite true, if such a channel were to be left unprotected
from wind and waves, but no one, who is likely ever to have any-
thing to do with the matter, would think for a moment of making
such a channel without protecting it on both sides with piers or
groins.
CHAPTER VIII.
On phenomena, which may he seen in Port Phillip and Hobson's
Pays, which prove that the scour described in the last chapter
will he more than sufficient to keep open an entrance for
shipping to the ship canal and dock.
At the east side of the mouth of the Yarra is a promontory
of silt, which, in the references on the map, is described as being
shown by a line of dots. The form and dimensions of this
promontory were taken on a double linear scale from a map of
Melbourne and its suburbs, lithographed at the Crown Lands
Office on the 23rd of April, 1864, and at the end of this essay will
be found a lithograph (the last of four) which is an exact copy
of as much of the Crown Lands map just named as is required
for my purposes, except that added thereto are three triangular
figures marked A, B, and C, which do not appear on the Crown
Lands map, and which will be herein explained.
The map which accompanies this essay is a copy from three
different maps, the east side of it being copied from the one
which, till lately, formed a part of the Victorian Bradshaw’s
Guide ; but as on the latter, the distance from Emerald Hill to the
Yarra is thirteen chains and a-half less than the real distance,
this error had to be corrected in the copy taken front it in order
that geographical errors should not exist in the delineations of
my own plans. The original source of the west side was a map
which came into my hands nearly, if not quite, twenty years ago,
a copy of which I took on a larger scale, but have lost all
remembrance of whose it was and where and by whom published,
and from my copy, the whereabout of which is altogether unknown
to me, if it be in existence, I took cardboard templates to enable
me to make after delineations of it with ease and expedition, and


these cardboard templates, if still perfect, are lying about as mere
■waste—sheet metal ones having been taken from them, and the
latter are the ones I now use and the ones by which I made the
manuscript map from which the lithograph was taken. With all
these transitions it would be scarcely possible that some small
errors of delineation should not have crept in, and that this has
been the case is shown by the description which next follows.
The representation which is made on the map hereto annexed of
the promontory of silt on the east side of the mouth of the Yarra
is a copy taken from the Crown Lands’ map already mentioned,
lithographed on the 23rd of April, 1864, and taken therefrom on
a scale of double linear dimensions. It will be seen on the map
at the end of this essay that if the side of the promontory which
faces in a south-easterly direction were extended at its north-
easterly end it would, instead of running into the line of the
foreshore, and forming one continuous unbroken curve therewith,
intersect that line, which I know—from having gone to the place
to assure myself by personal observation—is not the case; and
that the curve of the promontory runs into the curve of the
foreshore, forming one continuous curve, as shown on the Crown
Lands’ map. But instead of altering the map drawn by myself
ft’om which to get the lithographs made, I have preferred getting
a lithograph made from the Crown Lands’ map, which is the one
already mentioned as the last of four at the end hereof. My
reason for being,, as circumstantial as I have been in all that I
have yet stated in this chapter is, that that which is therein
contended for is one of the most important proofs that a canal
opening dfrect into the bay may have the entrance to it kept open
by natural operations after the woi'ks required for it have been
executed, and with no more than very uncostly manipulations of
some parts of those woi’ks.
For more than twenty years I have been variously informed
respecting the height of tides in Poi’t Phillip Bay, and the mean
depth of the bay, and from the most reliable information I have
been able to get as to the rise and fall of tide at Port Phillip
Heads and in Hobson’s Bay, I ai’rive with considerable certainty
at the conclusion that the mean rise and fall of tide in Poi’t
Phillip Bay is five feet, and that the mean depth of the bay does
not exceed forty-five feet; and these being taken as facts they
show that a volume of water, equal to the whole contents of the
bay, flows into it through the Heads from the ocean in nine tides,,
or in less than five days, and the same quantity flows out of it
through the same channel in the same time; and from the relative
position of Point Lonsdale and Point Nepean a strong current in
a north-easterly direction must pass inward between them wdth
every flow of tide, running from south to north up the east side of
the bay, and from east to west across the shore of Hobson’s Bay,
and I felt sure that whatever its strength and duration might be,


it and it alone was the cause of the south-east side of the
promontory of silt being as well defined as is the west side of it
by the currents of the river. This is well shown on the fourth
lithograph, and on the Crown Lands’ map from which that
lithograph was copied, and those who wish may satisfy themselves
of the fact by going to the place and seeing it for themselves.
Mr. Adams in his lithograph, from which the third lithograph of
this essay was copied, represents this hank of silt in a very
different form, but in this matter he must have drawn a little on
his imagination. But the duration of this current in Hobson’s
Bay is a point on which the value of the evidence it affords
depends. To save myself from taking a journey so far as
Sandridge uselessly, I went first to Mordialloc, where I found the
current just as I had expected ; and soon afterwards I went for
the first time since I have been in the colony to the mouth of the
Yarra, going there expressly to see which representation of this
bank of silt was correct —that shown in the Crown Lands’ map
or that in Mr. Adams’ lithograph, and there found the former to
be quite correct, the margin of it being as distinctly defined on
the south-east side of it as on the river side, and that side a
continuous curve from the curve of the foreshore, as shown in the
last of the four lithographs. Going along the beach close to the
water’s edge from Sandridge, for the purpose of watching the
tidal current if it reached round as far as Hobson’s Bay, I saw
within the water’s edge small pieces of decayed seaweed lying on
the bottom almost motionless, very evenly dispersed, and no
motion of it that indicated current; and returning from the river’s
mouth I kept to the top of the ridge for a short distance, but I
soon turned to the water’s edge, where all the pieces of seaweed
were then drifting along towards the mouth of the river, and all
at the same rate of speed, from which it was obvious that the
tidal current for which I was looking had commenced, and
marking off about a chain’s length of the foreshore I, by
my watch, ascertained the time occupied by one of the pieces
in drifting over that distance. My memory does not serve
me now as to the exact rate, hut it was not over a very slow walk,
I did intend to go to the Sandridge town pier to look for and
watch this' current, hut as it had commenced, I decided to stay
where T was to see how long it continued; and whilst staying, it
altogether ceased within a time that could not have far exceeded
half an hour. It did not continue till high water, for the tide
rose after it had ceased, but I did not stay to see how long it
continued to rise, no reason for so doing occurring to me at that
time, nor indeed, at either of my subsequent visits, which I have
yet to describe. But whilst going towards the mouth of the
river, I observed another phenomenon of quite as great importance
in the way of evidence as that which was afforded by the bank of
silt or the drifting of the seaweed. This consisted of a number


-of promontories of sand, from a dozen to twenty in number,
projecting from the foreshore into the bay, in that part which
lies between the Sandridge baths and the bank of silt, on neither
of which was its highest point more than three or four inches
higher than the then level of the water; but before high water
they had all disappeared, without any others of the same kind
appearing on the parts over which the further rise of the tide had
flowed. These promontories of sand were all triangular, with
angles not sharply defined, all of them having a long side
forming a very acute angle with that part of the foreshore which
formed one side of the triangle, a very obtuse angle being formed
by it with the line of foreshore which extended easterly from the
angle just named. The parts marked A, B, and Con the fourth
lithograph represent all the variations of these promontories, but
on a much larger scale than the rest of the lithograph, it being
impossible to show their configuration on the same scale. The
westerly side of some of them formed a slightly obtuse angle with
the line of foreshore extending westerly from them, as is shown
by the one marked A. In others that side formed about a right
angle with the foreshore, as is showrn by the one marked B ; and
with others that angle was a slightly acute angle, as is shown by
the one marked C; and from these all lying in the tidal
current, and none appearing on the parts which became covered
with water after that current had ceased, as well as from
the configuration of all, it was obvious that they were caused by
that current. Shortly after this I went again to Sandridge about
an hour before the time of high water, and on this occasion I
went direct to the town pier, and on my arrival saw no current,
but after being there a short time, some small pieces of wood,
which I had brought with me for the purpose, when thrown into
the water, floated away to the west, in a line about parallel to
the shore, the first few thrown in floating away slowly; others
floated away in the same direction at a greater speed; but the
rate soon became slower, and ceased altogether in less than forty
minutes from the time when it commenced. From all these
facts, and what I had seen at Mordialloc, where the current
becomes perceptible earlier than it does in Hobson’s Bay, I
became certain that I was right as to the existence of the current
and its cause, and as to its effects on the promontories of sand
along the beach to the west of Sandridge, and on the promontory
or bank of silt on the east side of the mouth of the Yarra, and
that the clearly defined character of the side of each that was
washed by this current was an effect of it—an effect which, on
the bank of silt, was, in the mean and aggregate, as great on one
side of it as the action of the river is on the other side.
Soon after the last-mentioned visit to Sandridge some heavy
rains came, and the waters of the Upper Yarra nearly filled its
banks, causing heavy freshes in the bay, and tnis induced me to


go again to the Sandridge town pier to see what effect the
increased outflow from the river had on the tidal current, thinking
it not improbable that the former might altogether overpower the
latter at as great a distance from Port Philip Heads as Hobson’s
Bay, but before high water the cun-ent came though much
slower, and it did not last so long as a quarter of an hour ; but
I fell in with an elderly labouring man, whose residence was at
Emerald Hill, but whose occupation evidently was at the pier,
and, speaking to him about this current, he told me that if
always came just before high water, but never lasted long; and
in answer to the question of how long, he said that he never
knew it to last an hour, and not often much more than half
an hour.
As in some of the former parts of this essay I have felt it
necessary to be very circumstantial in all the facts there described,
so I have felt it to be in all those described in this chapter,
thei’e being persons who are very willing to cast doubts on my
deductions and conclusions, but I think most persons will see that
if this current is capable of forming the promontories of sand
which I have described, and is capable of preventing the silt from
the river extending along the beach in the way shown in
Mr. Adams’ lithograph, but which as shown by the Crown Lands’
map does not so extend, and this anyone by goingto the place may"
see for himself that it does not do, then, a fortiori, the outflow
from a tidal area of four hundred acres, filled to a depth of nearly
three feet by a flow of tide through twenty-one chains, and half
width of openings extending to a depth of ten feet below low
water level, and the whole of that tide water returning with the
ebb through an opening only a chain and a half wide, and
twenty-two feet below low water level deep (that opening being
for the passage of shipping) will afford more than a sufficient
scour for keeping that passage always open.
CHAPTER IX.
Showing some of the ill-consequences that would result from
persons who do not understand the phenomena of the floods at
Melbourne, and their causes, becoming the projectors of amj
scheme for the construction of a ship canal and dock.
As far as I am able to learn from ship owners, and from persons
who are concerned in the navigation and piloting of their ships,
it appears that a ship canal from the shore of Hobson’s Bay,
whether leading into the Yarra or into a dock, must be embanked
on both sides, not only to a greater height than that to which


any flood has ever been known to rise, but to a greater height on
the east side than that to which the embankment itself will be
capable of raising any flood, for the floods off a million acres of
country which come down the valley of the Yarra will flow across
the St. Kilda road , and instead of having a four-thousand-acre
basin to flow into, and the mouth of the Yarra for its outflow, it
would then flow into a basin of not more than a few hundred
acres extent, reaching from the embankment to St. Kilda, with
no other outlet than the mouth of the Sandridge Lagoon, and this
would involve the almost complete submerging of Sandridge, a
much more extensive flooding of Emerald Hill than has ever yet
been known, and a flooding of some of its most valuable property,
and possibly of some property at St. Kilda that has never yet
been flooded. Some of the prospective sufferers by such a piece
of engineering as this may perhaps say “ Stop it from crossing
the St. Kilda-road by extending the embankment from the east
side of the ship canal up the south side of the river to the high
ground where stands the Immigrants’ Homebut what would
the people of Richmond and Collingwood say to the many feet
extra rise of flood that this would cause above Melbourne ; for if
Melbourne did not exist, and all the space which before it came
into existence nature afforded for the passage of the floods on the
north side of the river were now available, the floods at Richmond
and Collingivood would be raised several feet by what these
embankments alone would do. But the natural course for floods
there, when dammed up by the embankments, would be immensely
obstructed by an immense block of buildings, foremost of which
are the New Fish Market and the Bridge Hotel, and these and all
the adjoining masses of bricks and mortar, would raise the floods
at Richmond and Collingwood several feet higher than they
would be raised by the embankments only, but the effect of the
buildings just mentioned, and the streets and ways that pass
through them, must next be considered.
There are four passages for the floods (should they unwisely
be forced to go there,) and others, should the four not afford
sufficient space for their passage —the four being the new
course of the railway from the old Suburban Station to the
Flinders-street Station, Flinders-street, Flinders-lane, and
Collins-street—which, it is true, make up a greater collective
width than that of the water-way under the Chapel-street
bridge; but then, what is to compensate for the absence of
the forty-three feet nine inches depth on the lower side and the
fifty feet nine inches depth on the upper side of that bridge, and
for the velocity of the flow of all the water passing there ? With
the retardation that would result from attrition against the
unmoving surface of the streets and the unmoving walls of the
buildings (if the latter should not be washed away,) the four
passages that have been named would not afford the necessary


space if the water rose to the level of the tops of the buildings,
and as water probably never will again, as it did once in the Red
Sea, stand without any material support in an upright position,
such a flood as that of 1863, if prevented from flowing across the
St. Kilda-road, would reach to as high a level, if not higher, than
Latrobe-street, and then running by the cross streets into Eliza-
beth-street, would rise as far up all the west streets as it could
go without running up hill. I don’t think that either the people
of Sandridge or those of Emerald Hill are likely to try to get this
done, nor do I think they would succeed if they did try; but I
have pointed out what the effects of it would be because precisely
such engineering was carried into execution—though not on so
magnificent a scale—in the year 1873. A part of the engineering
just referred to consisted of the convertion of the lagoon on the
east side of the St. Kilda-road into a beautiful lake for the ©ma-
ture of the Governor’s residence; but that which was identical in
kind with that which I have just described, though not on so
grand a scale, was an embankment on the south side of the river
for preventing the destruction of the beauties of the lake, by
stopping the flow of the floods through it and thence across the
St. Kilda-road, and thereby causing them to flow wherever they
■ could find a way on the north side of the river. All that I was
aware of at the time this was projected and in progress was that
the sedgy lagoon was to be converted into a beautiful lake. I had
heard nothing of the embankment. Had I heard of it, I should
have endeavoured to stir up the Hobson’s Bay Railway Company
and some of the mercantile firms of Flinders-street to a perception
of the mischief with which their properties were threatened. But
I did get a circular letter printed at my own expense, having for
its object the prevention of the waste of two thousand pounds on
the lake, which, beautiful as it is, must be destroyed by the next
flood, whenever that flood comes; and I sent two or three dozen
copies of this circular (a reprint of which will be found in the
appendix) to the Low-lying Lands Commission. But the lake was
made, and the embankment too; and then, to avert the mischief
threatened by the latter, a considerable portion of it had to be
cut away at a considerable additional cost, exposing afresh the
beauties of the lake to the ravages of the floods.
It may be asked is it necessary to embank the canal. The four
thousand acre basin is entered by the flood waters of the Yarra
through a pass which, on a line drawn from the Immigrants’
Home to Flinders-street, is about a furlong wide—the point of
outflow being the mouth of the Yarra, which is nearly five miles
distant in a straight line from the point of entry ; and, drawing a
line across that line at the middle of it, and at right angles with
it, the point where the latter line intersects the flood on the south
side of the former will be nearly three miles distant from its
intersection of the flood margin on the north side. This is


how it appears on the map which all who saw the flood of 1865
will know to he a very close approximation to the facts, and with
such an expansion as this there could be no more current from the
Immigrants’ Home to the mouth of the Yarra, than there is as I
have before said in the Lakes of Constance and Geneva, from the
river which flows through each of them. But, as I know from
what I saw of the much smaller flood of 1866, a strong current
runs down the south side of the river caused by the rapid down-
flow between the Immigrants’ Home and Flinders-street, and this
being mere eddy, there was of course the same kind of current
round the Barracks and up the Military Reserve though there
was no outlet for it in that direction. These eddies must be ugly
things for a pilot bringing a towed ship up a canal with its banks
submerged by water in a perfectly opaque condition, and their
continuance is too short, and their occurrence too infrequent for
him to acquire any acquaintance with them.
The embankments may be avoided, and ought to be avoided,
and the way to do it is to construct a flood channel that in
conjunction with the little nature has done for it, will altogether
carry off the floods.
CHAPTER X.
A very short chapter, hut very well worth reading.
It has lately been proposed to take borings from the beach to
the Yarra, in the course of the line where a ship canal is proposed
to be made, a most important thing, but as it happens, a thing
that has already been done. It was done by Mr. Christy in 1853,.
and some years ago Mr. Selwyn gave me a lithograph of the
vertical section of it, but unfortunately I have lost it; never-
theless, I believe copies of it are still in existence, and may easily
be procured. It discloses two ugly old river channels, over which
is a crust of some thickness, from the underside of which, to a
greater depth than was penetrated by the borings, is nothing but
liquid black mud, and these will have to be crossed by a ship
canal, but they need not scare the advocates of that project, for
they can be dealt with effectually.


CHAPTER XI.
A chapter altogether uncontemplated by the author of this Essay
till most of it was written, but then suggested to him— undesignedly
of course—by the Honourable Minister of Railways.
In the sixth chapter of this Essay I have shown some very
strong objections to a dock being made on the north side of the
Yarra, and deriving its supply of water from so filthy a source as
the Yarra must become when it has been deepened as much as
will be required to bring all the shipping up to it that trades to
Melbourne. The condition of that river is filthy enough now, but
it will become vastly worse when the alterations to be made for
the contemplated purpose have been carried into execution.
Nevertheless, I am perfectly mindful of the importance of the
shipping being brought to the Government railways ; but it has
always been my conviction—a conviction of which lam not yet
divested—that at no distant time the property of the Melbourne
and Hobson’s Bay United Railway Company will become State
property, and this is one reason why I have shown in the annexed
map a dock with its north-east end extending into the Hobson’s
Bay portion of that property ; another reason being that in that
situation its accessibility to the mercantile firms of Melbourne
will be greater there than at any other site where a dock and the
railway system can be brought into conjunction. But it is
perfectly possible, at less than an extra quarter of a million of
cost, to construct a dock adjoining the present Government
railways which would be wholly unconnected with the river, and
in which no dredge will ever be required during the life of any
person now living.
If it be decided to at once make a dock with the present State
railways traversing either of its quays, a mode for the
accomplishment of it, which wall avoid the filth of the river, will
be to construct as much of the head of the flood channel which
has already been proposed as will allow of a cut or artificial river
from it to pass down the Military Reserve, across the road from
South Yarra to Emerald Hill, and thence into Hobson’s Bay
about half-way between Sandridge and St. Kilda and instead of
building the sluices at the head of the channel, where they are
now shown on the map, they must be built a short
distance below the point at which the new cut leaves the
flood-channel, but that channel should at first be made no farther
down than has just been proposed, in order that facilities may be
afforded for transporting, by temporary railways, all the excavated
earth that may not be required in the construction of the new-
cut, to the parts of the river which I shall now suggest to he


filled up and obliterated. Two chains wide and five feet below
low water level deep will, I feel sure, be more than sufficient for
carrying all the waters of the Yarra when verging on flood
quantities, and in larger quantities the flood channel will be the
proper course for them; but when this new cut is made no further
progress than has just been described should be made with the
flood-channel till all the spare excavated stuff from the new cut
has been shifted across the course proposed for it to the parts of
the river that have to be filled up, and the part first to be thus
dealt with will be from the point where the north side of the
flood-channel commences, at the north bank of the river, and
thence down to the falls, and when all of it has been shifted,
then the flood-channel should be completed through its whole
length to the Bay, and whatever spare excavated earth it may
afford should be used also for filling up the river, and the next
point at which this should commence will be on the west side of
the part where it has been decided that the ship canal shall cross
the river, and the filling up with it should extend to the Saltwater
River if the quantity of it be sufficient, but if not it should extend
as far west as the distance for which it will suffice, and all
beyond that distance should be made a free depository for
whatever suitable rubbish might be brought to it. The point for
commencing the lower of the two fillings up of the river must
be below the Gas Works, in order that the gas main may not
obstruct the construction of the ship canal in its course from the
river to the dock at the state railways; and the next thing to be
put in execution may either be the ship canal and dock, or the
works in the Bay, which are designed for keeping the passage for
shipping open, and in this chapter I need say no more about the
latter, and that which needs to be said about the former is that
the canal should cross that which is now the river, making the
part where the lower filling up commences a part of its west
bank, whilst its east side, opposite thereto, will be its communica-
tion with that part of the river on the north side, of which are
the Australian and Queen’s Wharves, and this part will thereby
become a tidal dock with sea-water only in it, and the dock at
the state railways will be of the same kind, and in neither nor in
the ship canal will a dredge ever be needed, more than one is
needed in Milford Haven, Plymouth Sound or Portsmouth
Harbour. A swivel or swing bridge will be required for the
purpose of getting to the west side of the dock, to the road to
Williamstown across the mouth of the river, and to the country
to the west of the ship canal and dock, and this bridge should be
somewhere between the Australian Wharf and the new dock.
The only other matter that remains to be considered is the
drainage of Melbourne; and that which flows off the west side of
East Melbourne and down Swanston-street should, after crossing
Flinders-street by the ordinary paved channels, fall into a deeper


paved channel, and thence flow into the flood channel above the
sluices, whilst that which flows easterly from Elizabeth-street and
westerly from Spencer-street, and now flows into the river below
the falls should, if the levels admit of it, also flow by a paved
channel into the flood channel above the sluices, but should it be
found that the levels render this impracticable, it must not flow
where it now flows, but into the flood channel below the sluices.
The drainage from the north-west of Melbourne must be into some
part of the river above its mouth, which will then be all saltwater
river, as the Yarra will be entirely severed from it.
I much regret that the subject of this chapter did not come
before me in time for me to get a lithograph made of that which
I have just described, but it’s not having done so may induce me
to write a supplement to this essay, and, should I do so, I shall
go more fully into sanitary matters than I have done here.

APPENDIX.
The Circular referred to at Page 11.
Dandenong, 23 rd February , 1867.
Sir, —Having been advised by a Member of the Yarra Flood
Deputation to lay before the Town Clerks of all the Municipalities
interested in the matter, a scheme of which I am the projector,
for uniting in one undertaking the construction of a Sixty-acre
Dock at Melbourne, and the prevention of those Floods, I take
the liberty of addressing you on the subject. I cannot go into
the whole matter by letter, but shall be happy to wait on your
Municipal Council, or on their Representatives in the Deputation,
if you will please to inform me of any time when either will be
disposed to see me respecting it.
The first thing to which I wish to call your attention is the
relative position in which the two sections of this scheme (the
construction of the Dock and prevention of the Floods) stand, as
matters both of national and local importance; for I think no one
can refuse to admit that if any very large portion of the absolutely
necessary works be equally required for both sections, and will
cost no more applied to both than applied to one only, the union
of the two will be the course to be taken to secure the earliest
execution of either; but before the relative importance of the two
can be shown to have a bearing on the question, it will be
necessary to show what works common to both sections are
absolutely necessary, and on this point I must quote a passage
from the Report of the Yarra Flood Commission, which runs
thus : —“ We do not believe that it would be possible to keep open
the mouth of a channel at any point on the Beach, between the
mouth of the Yarra and St. Kilda, in the face of southerly and
south-westerly gales.” I would advise every one who takes a
deep interest in this matter, and who is not already well acquainted
with this report, to get a copy of it. It contains the whole matter
with reference to the Flood question, so far as engineering practice
known at the time it was written is concerned, and will serve very
efficiently to aid in forming a judgment of any scheme which
includes no novel practice in engineering, and of course it at once
condemns as useless the mere cutting of a storm-water channel
from any of the flooding parts to the Beach. Such a channel
would have no appreciable effect in diminishing the height to


which Floods would rise; the only beneficial effect it could have
would be to let the Floods off a little faster after they had done
all the mischief they were capable of doing, and to do no more
than this would but ill justify incurring an outlay which it is
admitted would exceed a hundred thousand pounds. Of course,
all the Commissioners were well aware that such a channel could
be kept open by dredging, but they were also aware that this
would be too expensive to be at all expedient; and therefore the
passage which I have quoted, though it be not literally, is never-
theless virtually true.
The essential features of my own scheme consist in entirely
novel engineering works outside the Beach, by which a storm-
water channel will at all times be kept open, and which will at
one and the same expense keep open the mouth of a ship canal;
and with thus much of explanation on this point, I come next to
fFe question of the relative importance of the two sections of the
j€int undertaking.
However large the claims on the Government to deal with the
Yarra Floods may be (and I have no wish to underrate them, for
they certainly are great,) they rest entirely on the fact that every
Government has at all times spent large sums of money in all the
settled parts of the Colony on works which confer no other than
local benefits; and whilst the sufferers by the Yarra Floods, who
are numerous, and their sufferings great and continually recurring,
have borne of other people’s burdens, they ought not
in return to have their own claims to the reciprocation of these
benefits ignored; but no one can say that the Yarra Floods have
the slightest injurious effect on any part of the Colony, except
the immediate vicinity of Melbourne, or on any but a very small
proportion of the population of that locality. But how does
bringing the Port of Melbourne to Melbourne affect the Colony
generally ? Melbourne, for Foreign trade, is the sole Port of the
Colony, and will so continue till the population has reached five
or six times its present amount, all others being ports merely for
the Intercolonial and coasting trades. By this Ido npt mean to
say that no ship ever has freighted from a distant part of the
world to any other port, but such occurrences are so unfrequent
as not virtually to affect the truth of the assertion which I have
just made, and therefore the construction of a Dock at Melbourne
is something in which every individual in the Colony has some
amount of interest, from which it follows that to make the two
things an united undertaking would justify any Government in
expending an amount which could not in justice be applied to the
prevention of the Floods only. I do not mean to say that for
prevention of the Floods alone, if no other public benefit could
be advantageously united with it, the Government ought not to
expend as much as is asked to cut a storm-water channel out to
the Beach, but this would be useless when done unless a much


larger outlay were gone to to complete its effectiveness. These
are much stronger reasons for uniting the two works in one under-
taking than the mere fact that a necessary part of the works will
he common to the two, and will at one expense serve both
purposes ; but a stronger reason than both combined remains yet
to be shown, namely—that if the whole be made an undivided
undertaking it will be unnecessary for the Government to furnish
so much as half the amount which would be required for them to
deal with the Floods only, and that which would be required for
the latter purpose, and to do it effectively, is far more than any
Government will propose, and more than the Parliament would
vote if the Government proposed it.
The two members of the Government who have spoken on the
subject of the Floods have both admitted it to be right that
assistance should be granted from the treasury •, but as neither
has given any intimation of the amount of assistance which he
would consider should be given, it will be useless for me to gay-
more than 1 have already said on this point. One of them, in
expressing his own personal views, has stated his willingness to
confer legislatively special powers for local rating not provided by
the municipal law of the land, and what this will do for the
accomplishment of the object is matter for consideration. A very
small portion only of the local population suffer by the Floods,
and whilst those who do not suffer may probably possess sufficient
humane sympathy and philanthropy to be willing to bear their
share of the burden if thrown on to the general revenue of the
country, they possess a larger share of these qualities than I give
them credit for if they would be willing to bear the burden in the
more concentrated form in which local rating would bring it on
them; and I strongly opine that the non-suffering portion of
them will be disposed to say that if the country at large does not
see fit to bear the burden, or at least a large portion of it, it is too
heavy for them to bear, and the sufferers must help themselves.
Having shown the course the Flood Question is likely to take
if dealt with separately, I now come to the real point for considera-
tion, namefy—what is likely to be the result if it form pait and
parcel of a scheme for the construction of a Dock. Let me ask,
would the large mercantile firms which abound in est Melbourne,
and of which in East Melbourne there are not a few, be willing
to submit to local rating for the mere prevention of Floods, from
which a very few only of them suffer harm P and would they not
be willing to be rated to the amount, or to a large part of the
amount that would be necessary to prevent the Floods, if thereby
they could secure close proximity to their own warehouses, of a
Dock, and of the shipping which trade to the Port ? But another
feature of this matter which demands consideration, is the fact
on the one hand that whatever amount be expended merely to
prevent the Floods, it will bring in no revenue, whilst on the


other hand that which is expended on the construction of a Dock
will bring in constant revenue; and it so happens that the
Honourable the Treasurer, as lately as the 20th instant, gave us
some valuable information by which to form an estimate of what
that revenue is likely to be. What it will eventually amount to
may appear to you incredible, but I can assure you it is less than
docks and canals are paying in England at the present time.
The Honourable G. F. Verdon stated in Parliament, on the
20th instant, that which shows the yearly imports and exports of
the Colony to amount at the present time, in round numbers, to
eight hundred thousand tons. Now if this be the fact, and there
can be no doubt that it is, a lower rate of Dock Dues than is
commonly levied, and a rate which will induce nearly every vessel
trading to the Port to come into Dock, will at once pay about
twenty per cent, per annum on that share of the whole outlay
which will justly fall on the Dock Proprietary, whoever that
proprietary may be; but there are two features of this particular
part of the matter which must not be overlooked, one of which
is that a large amount of the Dock Proprietary’s whole outlay
need not by any means be permanent investment, but may be
immediately recovered by the sale of valuable warehouse sites;
the other matter requiring note being, that the proposed Dock will
not be merely suited to the present time, but will serve all the
purposes of the Colony for more than the next hundred years, and
till it pays more than a hundred per cent, per annum on its cost,
which persons now living, and those, too, who are not very young,
will live to see realised.
It is not for me to offer any suggestion to the Government,
neither is that which I am about to state offered as a suggestion,
but merely as a statement of fact; nor do I think it wise on the
part of Governments to dabble unnecessarily in matters which are
more legitimate objects for joint-stock enterprise; but if there be
the doubt about raising the necessary funds which some seem to
think, but which no one would believe who is correctly informed
of existing facts which throw light on the subject, the Govern-
ment may as a dernier resort (and should it by any possibility
become a dernier resort , it ought to be done,) borrow money for
the purpose, with a perfect certainty that they will at once have
a balance flowing into the Treasury, and a balance, too, which at
no very distant time will be a pretty large multiple of the amount
of interest to be paid on the loan.
I have the honour to be, Sir,
Your most obedient servant,
CHARLES PHILLIPS.

Reprint of the Report of the Yarra Flood Commission of 1864,
referred to at page 12.
REPORT
Of the Board appointed to Advise as to the Best Means
of Preventing the Flooding and Improving the
Navigation of the River Yarra.
To the Honourable the Minister of Public Works.
Sir,
Referring to the instructions conveyed to us by your
memorandum of the Ist February, 1864, “to enquire into and
ascertain the causes of the recent overflow of the Yarra in and
about the City of Melbourne and its Suburbs, and to specify the
principal impediments to the free egress of the waters,” and “to
enquire into and to advise as to the best method of facilitating the
discharge of flood water from the River Yarra, limited as far
as practicable to its natural channel, and such other channel or
channels as may be prescribed for it, with a view to preserve and
improve the navigation thereof, and other commercial facilities of
the River and Port,” we have now the honour to lay before you
the following Report:—
We desire to explain, first, the general principles by which we
have been guided in considering the opinions and plans that have
been brought before us, and the subject generally referred to us ;
and, secondly, the scheme which—designed in accordance with
these principles—appears to us will be the most effectual in reliev-
ing Melbourne and its neighbourhood from the evils caused by
the floods in the River Yarra.
The principles we have laid down for our guidance may be
very shortly stated: they are, firstly, that any effective improve-
ment of the river must commence at or near to its discharge into
the sea, and that such improvement must precede any attempt
to make the discharge of the waters of the upper portions of the
river more rapid; secondly, that it is of the greatest importance
to avoid, as far as possible, any interference with the regimen of


the river, and that any new channel should be used for carrying
off the waters of the Yarra only in times of flood; and, lastly,
that any new channel should discharge its waters into the mouth
of the Yarra; as, apart from the injury that the mouth of the
Yarra must suffer from the withdrawal of the scour effected by
the flood waters, we do not believe that it would be possible to
keep open the mouth of a channel at any point on the Beach,
between the mouth of the Yarra and St. Kilda in the face of
southerly and south-westerly gales. We have given every
consideration to suggestions that have been made from time to
time on this subject, and we have had the advantage of hearing
the opinions and examining the plans of several gentlemen who
have given much care and attention to the matter, but they all
appear to us to fail when examined by the principles that we
have agreed upon as essential to be observed in the endeavour
to effect the object in view.
The great flood of December last was, no doubt, caused by
the incapacity of the river channel to discharge the extraordinary
rain-fall that occurred at that time, the natural incapacity of the
channel being seriously increased by artificial obstructions; and
in Melbourne and its neighbourhood the evils were greatly
aggravated by the height to which the water rose in the bay
under the influence of a gale from the south-west.
After a careful consideration of the several surveys and
sections we have caused to be made of the river, with personal
examinations at various places, and assuming that the works
now in progress for deepening and regulating the mouth and
outfall of the river will be vigorously prosecuted—
We advise that a channel 300 feet wide and having for
the present a depth of water of twelve feet at ordinary
low-water, to be increased pari passu with the deepening
of the outfall, should be cut from the south bank of the
Yarra, about opposite to the Gas Works, to a point oppo-
site the stone quarries, between Stony Creek and the river’s
mouth; the sectional area of this channel w ould provide, after
allowing for the reduction of the water-way by the shipping
on each side, for the discharge of the water we have calculated to
be the quantity in the flood of December, 1863, beyond the
capacity of the present river below the Gas Works to discharge.
The lower end of this channel should be left open and the upper
end closed by a long oblique weir, which should be carried to the
level of high water spring tides, and only come into action for the
discharge of water in time of floods; bu tit should be provided
with sluice gates for occasional use in freshes, &c., and may, if
experience shows it to be desirable, have gates to admit of the
passage of ships from the new channel to the basin. This
channel, while it wdll effectually relieve Melbourne from floods,
will form a dock of great extent and perfect security. It would


afford about five and a half miles of wharfage accommodation,,
and should be connected with Melbourne and the terminus of
the Government lines of railway by direct communication across
the river, and both banks of the channel should be connected
with each other by a bridge over the weir.
Embankments to the necessary levels should be formed along
the north and south sides of the channel, and extended to
an oblique weir, which we propose should be built at Jolimont in
substitution for the Falls, and other embankments higher up the
river on the north side of the Yai'ra from the Chapel Street
bridge to the high ground opposite the Botanical Gardens; by
these means the low land in Kichmond, and that opposite the
Suburban Kailway station, the St. Kilda Koad, Emerald Hill,
Sandridge, and indeed all the land on both sides of the channel
and the river to the Botanical Gardens would be protected from
flood.
The works now in progress in forming the embankment on
the north bank of the river from the Gas Works to the Saltwater
junction, and thence along the east bank of the Saltwater Kiver
should be continued.
The lagoon to the eastward should be drained that the land
it occupies might become available.
We advise that the waterway of the river, from the weir
at Jolimont to about the Gas Works, should be deepened and
widened to a sufficient extent to allow, at least three times the
quantity of water to pass in a given time that is possible at
present; this will involve the building of new bridges of increased
waterway.
We recommend that the new Princes Bridge should be
of increased width, and carried across the river in the line ot
Swanston-street, at the level of that street, where it crosses
Flinders-street, and that an approach should be formed on the
south side by arches and an embankment.
We advise that the Falls should be entirely removed, and
an oblique weir constructed higher up the river at a point nearly
opposite Jolimont, for the purpose of preserving the summer
level. The pipes to the engine-house, for occasional water supply
to Melbourne, should be removed to a point above this weir.
New bridges in place of the present Hobson’s Bay Kailway
bridge, and that over the Falls, should be built with larger spans,
and all the obstructions, natural and artificial, that exist at
present between Princes Bridge and the basin should be removed.
By reference to the section attached, it will be seen that,
next to the Falls, the most serious of these is the reef under
Princes Bridge,
We recommend the construction of a lock at the weir
opposite Jolimont, that a passage to boats and small craft up
and down the river may be provided.


We estimate the cost of the works we recommend at £675,000.
The works included in this estimate are as follow ;
The cutting and embanking the new channel; the widening
and embanking of the river from the Gas Works to Jolimont;
the construction of the weirs and the lock ; the embanking of the
river near Richmond; the removal of Princes Bridge, and
building a new bridge and approaches; removing the Falls and
other obstructions; and the erection of bridges over the weir
at the north-east end of the new channel, and across the river to
the terminus of the Government Railways. The new bridge
for the use of the Hobson’s Bay Railway we have not included.
As a set-off against this expenditure we estimate that about
2000 acres of land now useless will become available for occupa-
tion and for business purposes, besides a wharf frontage of
about five and a-half miles on the sides of the new channel
for shipping, in addition to the frontages made available on the
Yarra banks
We would also recommend the construction of a culvert of
suitable dimensions, from the bottom of Elizabeth-street through
the Railway station to the Yarra, to assist in the discharge
of the storm water from the city.
We have confidence that the works we have proposed would
relieve Richmond, and effectually protect Melbourne, and tdb
land to the south of it from any possible injury from the Yarra
floods; and as river improvements should, as a rule, commence
from the lower end, if it should be afterwards found neces-
sary to carry out works higher up the river than we think
desirable at present, they will form an extension and develop-
ment of those we are now recommending, and which we are
of opinion will discharge the flood waters without interfering
with the regimen of the river in its ordinary state, or withdrawing
any portion of the water which is required for the preservation
of the outfall.
We attach general plans and sections illustrating this Report.
We beg permission to record our appreciation of the zealous
assistance rendered to us by Mr. S. H. Merrett of the Depart-
ment of Public Works, the gentleman you appointed to act as
secretary to us in this enquiry.
We have the honour to be, Sir,
Your most obedient Servants,

( R. W. LARRITT.
Melbourne, 31st August , 1864-


Dandenong, 18th March, 1873.
To the President and Members of the Royal Commission on Low
Lying Lands South and West of Melbourne.
Gentlemen, — Seeing in a copy of the Argus, at the end of
last week, that the tender for the execution of certain works at
the Lagoon—north of the Immigrants’ Home and east of the St.
Kilda-road —was accepted, I feel that I should be doing wrong
did I not add something more to that which I have already
written. I could have written more than double what I have
done without a word of irrelevant matter; but, on account of the
importance of all practicable brevity, I have had to select those
points of the subject which at the time appeared to me to be of
the greatest importance, and to reject many other points which
ought not to be overlooked.
If the works to which I have just referred are executed, one of
two consequences must of necessity follow: either about £2OOO
will be thrown away without one farthing of benefit as the result,
or the expenditure of it will interfere for an indefinite time—but
certainly not for ever—with the only means by which the floods
of the Yarra at Melbourne can be prevented in a way that will
be compatible with the interest of Melbourne as a port, and with
the interest which the colony has in Melbourne as its chief port,,
and the one of far more importance to the colony than all the
others collectively.
To form a correct judgment on this point, it becomes necessary
to understand clearly what are the conditions of these floods
through the various points of their course to their outfall into the
Bay; and into these conditions I have never had an opportunity
of looking any farther up the Yarra than its course through the
immediate suburbs of Melbourne, but that part of it is all that
materially affects this question.
From the character of the country through which the Yarra
flows, it appears certain that its floods consist of alternations of
impetuous torrents, passing through narrow gorges, on to flats
where the lateral expansion reduces the rate of flow to a com-
paratively sluggish current. But whether or not these be the
features which these floods present far up the river, this is their
condition at Melbourne; and the last of these torrents is the one
which commences at Cremorne and terminates at the Lagoon—
where the works above referred to are noW designed to be
executed ;—and in its course down this gorge it sweeps everything
before it which has. not something like a rock-like fixedness, as
was shown in 1863 by its action on the bridge at the Botanical
Gardens, on the St. Kilda-road, and on a multitude of other


things which were swept away by it. But past the St. Kilda-
road all impetuosity of current ceased, owing to the flood-waters
expanding on to an area of about 4000 acres or more, on which it
was held at twelve feet aboye sea level, not by thirty inches*
extra rise of tide (that was all that the tide then rose,) but by the
ridge of blown sand which has been accumulating for thousands
of years round the shores of the Bay, making this 4000 acres and
upwards what the Hon. Captain Cole has very aptly called a
basin, and from this basin there are but two outlets, one at the
Sandridge Lagoon, a mere chip in its brim, that does nothing for
flood escape till the floods have done all the mischief they are
capable of doing, and the other the mouth of the Yarra, which,
owing to its low level—and indeed the low level of all the Lower
Yarra, and the consequent slow flow of water through it—it is
altogether incapable of carrying off the quantity of water which
rushes down the gorge from Cremorne to the Lagoon in question.
The distance from Cremorne to the Lagoon is seven furlongs,
and the fall from the flood level of 1863 at the upper of these two
points to the surface of the water in the Lagoon at its ordinary
level, is about twenty feet; but when the 4000 acre basin is full,
this fall is reduced to about ten feet, but ten feet in seven furlongs
is an enormous fall for water which was everywhere as deep as the
flood then was.; and the momentum with which it reached the
St. Kilda-road was plainly shown by its destructive action on
that road, but there its momentum was immediately lost in the
comparatively still water of the said basin. Now, who that
considers these facts can for a moment doubt that the point where
I propose to tap the river is, par excellence, the point for doing
it ? The flood current (which never gets its direction from the
river current, but always from the higher land on both sides of it)
crosses at this point from the north to the south side of the river,
and, by means of the storm water channel which I propose to
commence there, the flood waters will be carried on down to the
sea with the same impetuous velocity as that by which they have
descended from Cremorne to that point: there will be no check
to their momentum till it is lost in the waters of the Bay, in the
same way as that by which it is now lost in the waters of the
4000 acre basin.
To fairly estimate the value and importance of this channel,
and the importance of making it exactly where I propose, I must
draw a comparison of its effects with those which would result
from tapping the river at any point below where the waters of
the said basin had fallen into a comparatively stagnant condition.
* After this circular was printed, and copies of it sent to the Low Lying
Lands Commissioner, it was ascertained that on the 17th of December,
1863, the morning tide rose but about seventeen inches, and the afternoon
tide hut about ten inches higher than ordinary high water level.


In a former communication I have said enough about the
impracticability of a channel from the beach to the river, for the
twofold purpose of flood prevention and navigation by shipping,
and therefore I need now speak only of attempts which may be
made there for the former purpose only; and this I admit may
be done without subjecting Melbourne and other places to that
increase of floods which would be the result of making a navigable
channel there, but with what effect will presently be seen. I will
ask anyone whether, in a storm-water channel made there, any-
thing could ever cause a current to flow through it at half or even
a third of the velocity of the current which there will be in the
channel which I propose to make P and, if not, will not more than
three times the breadth of channel be required to effect the same
amount of flood prevention P
It has been said, and said lately, that a channel cannot be kept
open at the beach. Now, I beg to refer those who think so to
my model which is made to a scale of three-eighths of an inch
to the foot, and also to the plan by which it is accompanied.
In the model it will be seen that the sluice sills are eleven feet
above the sea bottom, and, this being designed to represent that
part of the groin where the depth below low water is twenty-
two feet, this gives the immersion of the sluices at that part and
at that state of tide, as the other and upper eleven feet; but
these openings through the groin, each twenty-two feet wide,
and each containing three sluices, are designed to be forty-five
in number, amounting to a collective width of fifteen chains, and
of course they cannot all be at parts where there is a depth of
twenty-two feet below low water; but the length of the groin
will allow of the whole forty-five being that distance from the
shore that none of them will be in shallower water than sixteen
feet below low water, and at every part my design is that the
sluice sills and the bottom of the sluices shall be just half as
high from the bottom of the Bay as the height of low water level
therefrom; and this fifteen chains, together with the space for
the passage of ships, are the spaces through which the floods will
escape; and, to determine whether this width of fifteen chains
for the passage both of flood and tide can be kept open, I beg
now to request attention from the model to the plan, and by the
latter it will be seen that I propose to place the groin, with its
system of sluices, facing to the west, from which direction there
is no sand-drift, and silt is too small in quantity for much of it
to reach the groin for ages, or ever to reach to the level of the
sluice sills at the distance they will be from the river’s mouth.
Were the sluices to face to the east or south-east they would soon
get choked up with sand, and, unless made very strong, would
soon get knocked to pieces by the heavy seas that would break
on them; but nothing will ever interfere with them if they face
to the west.


It would be absurd for me to attempt to prove by letter that
my means for keeping a road open for the shipping would be
effective but I am ready to discuss the matter at any time, and
to show’ by the results of perfectly analogous dynamic actions
that it is absurd to doubt the fact. The subject is one in which
I am neither a tyro nor a mere amateur; engineering has been
my main business for nearly forty-five years, and my sole
dependence for daily bread during the nineteen years next
preceding my coming to this colony, and in this section of that
profession my opportunities for getting sound knowledge have
been as good as those of most. With the exception of London-
derry and Waterford, I have been in every important port ot the
United Kingdom which lies between the latitude of Dundee to
the north and Falmouth to the south, and between the longitude
of Yarmouth to the east and Limerick to the West, and at ail
times have made the subject one for attentive investigation.
I have the honour to be, Gentlemen,
Your most obedient servant,
CHAS. PHILLIPS.
