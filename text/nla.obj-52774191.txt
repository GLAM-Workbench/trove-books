The Vocational Training and Employment of
the Returned Soldiers, with some
Notes on Afforestation and
Land Settlement
By Hon. Colonel W. FITZPATRICK, C.M.G.,
Member of the Vitftorian Stale
War Council.
VOCATIONAL Training and Employment for
the returned soldiers are here united under
one branch of the Repatriation Organization for
the following reasons, viz. ;
(a) There are so majiy points of contact in the
working details of each.
In the actual operations of the Em-
ployment Bureau there are many
instances where the Soldier applicant
is seen to be a fit subject for Vocational
Training owing to his history as dis-
closed in his papers or to some physical
disability, while he appears to have
mental capacity which raises him
above the average of the men seeking
the lower grades of employment;
(b) The aim of each is to find work for the men ;
in one case the men are fit to take
work at once; in the other they have
first to be trained in a suitable occupa-
tion before they are fit, and the
Employment Bureau is the proper
place for them to seek for employ-
ment immediately they are trained,
and afterwards when out of work.


Vocational Training.
Some General Remarks.
The aim of Vocational Training is to give every
wounded, or crippled, or otherwise more or less
incapacitated soldier such training as may be
necessary to make him an independent and
productive member of the community, instead of
the man remaining largely a burden on the State
or his friends for the rest of his life, and it is
our duty to seek all agencies that will stimulate
the individual to recover his courage and self-
reliance and develop his ingenuity. This problem
is a new one to us, and because of that the only
way to face it is by experiment, which alone
will lead to successful results. This problem is
also just as new to all the countries engaged in
the War, and they are all approaching it with
anxious footsteps, perplexed, like us, with its
strangeness and magnitude, in spite of their
much more highly organized administrations.
In Canada, the Vocational Training of invalided
men is commenced in the Hospital or Convalescent
Home as soon as the men are able to undergo it
in however small a degree, as it is recognised that a
convalescing patient’s recovery is expedited by
the gradual and judicious introduction of new
interests. A beginning is made in Vocational
Training, however slight, and with the patient’s
growing improvement in health that training is
gradually increased.
This takes the form of elementary training in
wood-working, mechanical drawing, market gar-
dening, poultry farming, bee-keeping, &c. The
result has been very salutary; the monotony of
8


hospital or convalescent home life has been
relieved, and the risk of invalided men dropping
into an apathetic state through want of interest
in life is avoided.
The Canadian practice, and that of Lord
Astor, in England, in this respect might engage
the attention of the medical staff of our Defence
Department, for these reasons— (a) the beneficial
effect upon the health and spirits of the invalids,
and (b) the economy in cost of starting Vocational
Training while the men are still in receipt of
soldier’s pay.
In conjunction with the Military Medical
Authorities of the Defence Department, the
Vocational Expert of the State War Council in
each State should devise a suitable system of
gradually expanding Vocational Training while the
men in Class 3 are still inmates of the Military
Hospitals and Convalescent Homes, so that
systematic training might be given at an early stage
for the reasons above stated.
It is the desire of the State War Councils that
there should.be a considerable expansion of Voca-
tional Training, which should include all callings
suitable for the classes of men offering, so that
as great a variety of the simpler skilled occupations
may be embraced as possible, with the view of
spreading the trainees over a wide field of varied
activities, and thus prevent the diversion of an
excessive number of men to a limited number of
callings, with the consequent risk of oversupplying
the market.
/ It is not only necessary to extend Vocational
Training to those men who will be selected to fill
the skilled jobs enumerated later on, but it is also
just as necessary to train men for other occupations


that are usually thought to be outside the
category of trades and other skilled callings
which we generally have in our minds when we
think about the matter.
We must enlarge our conception of what is
required to fit untrained men in new occupations,
and include poultry farming and similar occupa-
tions which require an apprenticeship at farms
engaged in the business in a fairly large way,
if the men arc to make good.” A preliminary
practical training should be given in any pursuit
in which the men have not had sufficient experience,
and this is easily obtained in all those occupations
associated with the land in our Government
Training Colleges.
It is a waste of money to start men in strange
undertakings without training or experience.
In many cases the establishing of men in small
industries or small businesses with which they
have little or no acquaintance is a waste of money,
and particular care should be taken, in this line
of operations, to see that no one is launched on
such a career without first serving an apprentice-
ship if there' has been no previous experience.
The small shop-keeping idea should be cut out
of our operations to a large extent, and we should
confine its continuance to partially disabled men,
otherwise it will lead not only to loss of capital,’
but will create jealousy later on, as it cannot be
indulged in as an “ easy way out ” indefinitely.
An inclination to try and re-enter civil life in
some new way is noticeable, in a certain percentage
of the veterans, both in the case of men invalided
who previous to their enlistment followed light
callings, as well as in the case of the more robust


men who have received a pre-war training in
some of the more skilled occupations—and even
in some cases in the highly skilled trades. It
would seem that as the result of their war expe-
riences many of the men are dissatisfied with their
previous civil environment, and wish to seek
entirely new avenues of employment. Men able
to follow their pre-war trades, crafts, or callings,
in which they served an apprenticeship, or in
which they qualified, and at which they were
formerly able to earn their living, should not
be diverted into other callings, but should be
persuaded to resume their old ways of earning
their bread if they are capable of doing so.
They have a claim on us to be helped to get
the work they are familiar with, and there is a
patriotic obligation upon employers to give it
to them.
The only exceptions to this rule are to be
found in agriculture and its various affilia-
tions which have as their foundation the cultiva-
tion of the soil, in connexion with which we should
give every encouragement in this country. There
may also be a few exceptional cases requiring a
departure from this rule, which, however, should
be specially authorized only by the Secretary to
the War Council.
There should be a printed form containing the
conditions under which a soldier trainee is accepted
for training in any Technical School, clearly
pointing out that if the trainee misconducted
himself, or did not make a reasonable effort to
qualify himself, or absented himself from attendance
without sufficient cause, he would run the risk of
the withdrawal of any further aid or assistance
from the State War Council.


This form should be signed by the trainee to the
effect that he accepted the conditions and would
abide by them.
While it is desirable as a general practice to
confine the operations in connexion with Voca-
tional Training to the official initiative of the State
War Councils in the manner later on suggested, the
routine to be pursued should not be too rigidly
applied in the cases of outside agencies such as
may be offered by individual or organized private
generosity desirous of providing either wholly or
partially the funds to train local men, or in con-
nexion with employers who do now, and may desire
in the future, to undertake to train men and bear
all the cost.
Such agencies should be encouraged, expecially
in the country, by all means; but to secure
uniformity, and insure that the men are “ fitted
to the job,” and that private kindness may not be
misdirected, it should be incumbent that appli-
cation should be made in all cases ,to the State
War Council for permission, so that all concerned
might have the Selection Committee’s advice, and
the trainee ultimately obtain an indenture or
certificate of competency when trained.
A difficulty experienced in Canada is shared
by us, and that is the inclination of the returned
soldier who previous to enlistment was a country
worker to seek city employment.
While we are trying to divert as many men as
possible to the' country, I am hopeful that the
tendency to remain in Melbourne will not be pro-
nounced, as the life of a soldier on service should
be likely, on the whole, to foster a love for a
freer and more open air life, and this ought to


incline previous city dwellers towards a country
life, and thus counterbalance the urban preference
above noticed.
The diversion of a large number of the men to
the country will be secured by the settlement of
men on the land, and if the Governments of the
States take up the matter of Afforestation, as I
earnestly hope they will, a still larger number of
men would be diverted to the country, many of
whom would make their permanent homes there.
I am personally of opinion, after much thought
and consultation with men engaged in industrial
and commercial pursuits, that the aim of Vocational
Training should be to fit men for the battle of life
as employees in the open market. If the men in
Class 3, and some of those in Class 2 to whom
Vocational Training should be confined, cannot
be trained to earn their bread at the various avoca-
tions we have in mind for them, then assuredly
they are not likely to succeed in any co-operative
undertaking, which will demand their entry into
competition with manufacturers, where the actual
capacity of the workman to produce certain articles
is only one of the many factors that make for
success.
I confess it is an alluring prospect, at first sight ’
to contemplate a number of returned soldiers
trained in certain skilled avocations being estab-
lished in a co-operative factory, with all the
machinery necessary, with skilled foremen to direct
their labours, and a highly competent business
manager to control the enterprise and to turn
the results of their industry into coin of the realm,
and with the aid of the Repatriation Fund to
finance the venture!


I am afraid that any attempt of this kind is
doomed to financial failure.
I came to this conclusion reluctantly, and only
after much consultation with keen business men.
We should turn a deaf ear to any proposals
of this kind.
It is also a doubtful policy to train men in an
avocation which calls for isolated individual
industry, where the existence of large manufac-
tories for the economical production of kindred
products is at any time a menace to the success
of individual effort with a limited market—the
avocation of hand-weaving to wit—where it
appears to me there is such a risk.
This form of industry is likely to appeal to us
for certain reasons, but it should not be extended
by the State War Council without the best expert
advice.
In connexion with the men who may receive
Vocational Training in a Technical School, it is
necessary to pay them a sustenance allowance
while being so trained, and the present pract ce
in such cases is for the State War Council in Victoria
to pay single men £2 2s. per week, and married
men £2 125., with an additional allowance of 3s. 6d.
per week for each child.
If, however, the man is in receipt of a pension
he is only allowed the difference between the amount
of his pension to bring it up to the above weekly
maximum while being trained.
In no case does he get more than the sustenance
allowances above mentioned.,


In connexion with Vocational Training it will
be essential to have a proper system of registration
by means of a card index, and this should contain
every particular required to make a full and
complete history of the man.
When ready to launch any system of Vocational
Training that will apply to a considerable number
of men, the first thing to do is to notify the men
in Class 3 and those to whom it applies in Class 2,
by placards and advertisement, that such a system
is ready to be brought into operation, with instruc-
tions that applications should be made to the
State War Council.
In the operations of Vocational Training a close
purview must be kept over the trainees,, and
suitable printed forms will be required.
A Repatriation Bulletin.
I would strongly urge the issue, at suitable
intervals, by the Repatriation Commission, of a
Bulletin similar to that issued by the National
Commission in Canada, containing reports of the
activities in all the States of all the States’ War
Councils that may be thought desirable, and of
all the organizations and agencies that may be
helping in repatriation.
The issue of a Bulletin alone will go a long
way towards securing uniformity, as it will rapidly
disseminate information of what is taking place
everywhere; and, by giving publicity to new
ideas which will be constantly evolved, help in
no small degree to inspire emulation and enthusiasm.
It should also form a ready means of affording
the Press opportunities to bring its powerful aid
to the various schemes.


The Case of the Maimed Soldier.
The men in Class 3 who have suffered the loss
of a limb should receive especial care and attention
at the hands of the Technical Expert attached to
the War Council.
The surgeon and the artificial limb maker can
give him some sort of a substitute to replace what
he has lost, but he is seriously handicapped in the
battle of life, and should be specially trained in
some suitable avocation, which should be carefully
chosen for him by the Technical Expert in con-
sultation with our medical adviser.
If he is a man of sufficient education, or capable
of having his education raised to the required
standard at a Technical School, so as to be able
ultimately to earn his living by the use of his
brains, that course should be taken.
In any case men so afflicted should be the
especial care of our Technical Schools.
If the loss is that of a right hand or arm, he
can be taught to write with his left hand, or even
with his right if the loss is only the hand, so great
is the improvement that has been made in the
manufacture of substitutes. If the loss is merely
that of an arm or a leg it is little bar to his
intellectual improvement.
If, however, he has not intelligence enough to
make his brains his source of future income, or
is not inclined that way, but wishes to learn some
industrial avocation, his infirmity so long as he
has one sound arm or leg need not cause him to
despair, if he is taught a suitable avocation which


has to be chiefly carried on by machinery. lam
sure that there are many employers who will help
such a man in their workshops.
In the Vocational Training of the men employers
and technical teachers who undertake to train
the men will be called upon to exercise much
patience and sympathy.
Many of the men are still under the influence
of the after-effects of their war experience, and
it will take time to gradually wean them,back to
normal conditions.
Forbearance and sympathy and a steady occupa-
tion to employ their minds will gradually restore
them to health.
All concerned will, I am sure, remember that
these men now entrusted to their care are
in their present weakened condition because
once upon a time, they were brave steadfast men
who risked their lives, at the other end of the
world, that those who are now called upon to
help them might live in security, far away from
the theatre of war in which they bore themselves
as men.
A study of what has been written on the subject
of Vocational Training for returned soldiers
reveals a certain amount of vagueness in all
references to training in trades and crafts that
require considerable skill in their execution.
It is usual to refer to a few “ simple ” means of
earning a living, such as type-writing and steno-
graphy, and coupled with these we find shoemaking
and carpentry, when discussing the subject in
England ; but we in Australia must approach
the subject with a knowledge of our industrial
926. —2

laws and practice in connexion with trade appren-
ticeships, which are more rigidly adhered to
and jealously guarded than elsewhere, perhaps.
The number of skilled occupations generally
suitable to the class of men we have to cater for,
and not requiring too long a time to learn, exist
in the United Kingdom to an immeasurably
greater extent than they do here, because of the
enormous commercial and manufacturing opera-
tions in Great Britain, which is one of the “ work-
shops of the world.” The limited number of men
employed in such avocations in Australia is a
handicap, when seeking to place the partially dis-
abled soldiers who may be unable to resume their
previous more strenuous callings. The list of
trades and skilled crafts open to the more robust
of the men must be examined with some care ;
but, as these take a long time to learn, I am
afraid our efforts will have to be largely confined
to those skilled occupations that require but a
short time to master.
In such trades as fitters, turners, iron machinists,
blacksmiths, boilermakers, coppersmiths, tin-
smiths, brassmoulders, ironmoulders, brass-
founders, painters, cabinetmakers, carpenters,
electroplaters, frenchpolishers, pattern makers,
sailmakers, upholsterers, and printers, for example,
great skill is required, and the period of apprentice-
ship is five (5) years.
It is assumed- that for the undermentioned
reasons such trades as the above will have few
apprentices from the ranks of the returned
soldiers :
(a) Because the age of the great majority of
the men is over that at which such
expert trades can be readily learned ;


(&) Because of the great expense of sustenance
for so long a period of training, and
the invidious treatment such an ex-
pensive course would lead to.
We then come to those minor crafts which
require varying degrees of skill, and a shorter time
to learn. I think for these avocations it is a
reasonable thing to allow of a maximum period of
training of twelve months for learning the most
difficult of them, with a corresponding reduc-
tion in the time required for the more easily
acquired.
Many of these avocations are sections of some
of the highly skilled trades, and, of course,
apprentices to the latter have to learn them ; but
with the growth of industries and the increased
use of machinery it became necessary to specialize
in these sections, and thus we have a number of
minor crafts as the result in every large factory
and workshop.
There are also a great many other more or less
skilled callings in the various industries and in the
manufacture of the great variety of articles
required in modem life, and in the disposal thereof
to the people.
Now, assuming that it is not the province of
Repatriation to incur the great expense necessary
to train men in the regular highly-skilled trades,
for the reasons given above, we are reduced to the
lesser skilled crafts we are now dealing with, in
our efforts to provide suitable Vocational Training


for the returned soldiers, and others that may be
added, and to ascertain which it will be necessary,
in each State, to obtain from the Employers’
Associations a complete list of all skilled jobs
used in the operations of all their industrial,
manufacturing, and commercial members.
This has already been asked for in Victoria, the
State War Council having arranged with the
various Employers’ Associations for the formation
of joint committees, consisting of sub-committees
of the various associations, which meet and consult
with the employment committee of the State
War Council. A large number of circulars have
been distributed to the employers of every kind,
explaining to them the aims of the War Council
in connexion with Vocational Training, and
pointing out the absolute necessity of ascertaining
what suitable skilled jobs there are in each
employer s business; what time is required in
each job to train ; the minimum wage ; how many
trainees each employer can take in the ordinary,
course of his business and under the condition
that the minimum wage must be paid to each
trainee while so learning, the full minimum wage
to be paid by the employer in the first instance,
and an agreed upon percentage thereof to be
reimbursed him subsequently by the State War
Council; and, finally, asking him to reserve
such jobs in future for our veterans who may be
suitable #nd properly trained. The circular has
a detachable tabulated return, which the em-
ployer is asked to fill in and forward to the Secre-
tary of his Association, who has been asked to
collate the information and send it to the Secre-
tary of the State War Council. See Appendix
“A” for tabulated statement.


A Suggested Scheme of Vocational
Training.
Having eliminated the highly skilled trades
that require five years’ apprenticeship, for the
reasons already stated, I found myself reduced to
the choice of those partially skilled avocations
which require a short time only to learn.
After much consideration I decided that
avocations ranging from 48s. to 665. per week, and
requiring varying periods of training up to a
maximum of twelve calendar months {i.e., thirteen
lunar months), must be the mainstay of my scheme.
Having come to this conclusion, I set to work to
discover what was the extent of this field of industrial
and manufacturing operations, and what prospects
did it hold out of meeting the needs of men in
Class 3, and to some extent those of Class 2,
they being the classes out of which the vast
majority of the men for Vocational Training should
be selected.
Through the good offices, of the Secretary for
Labour, Mr. Murphy, and his staff of Factory
Inspectors, I discovered that there existed a wide
choice of avocations of the exact character I wanted,
and I am able to give below a large number of
more or less skilled avocations suitable for the men
in the above classes, a full list of which I give in
Appendix “ C.”
It will be seen from the following brief summary
that the work of the Factory Inspectors has been
very thorough and complete.


Analysis of Factory Inspectors’ Digest of
more or less Skilled Avocations for
the men in Class 3 and to some
extent in Class 2.
I had intended to make a complete analysis of
the Inspectors’ work, but found that it would take
up too much space, and I now content myself with
asking my readers to refer to the Appendix “C ”
itself, which discloses the results of an investigation
of a most searching character into every “nook
and cranny of our industrial and manufacturing
operations, conducted by all the Factory Inspectors
in Victoria, and covering many weeks’ labour.
In the first place I strictly confined the
Inspectors’ operations within these limits :
{a) Maximum period of training not to exceed
thirteen lunar months ;
(b) The avocations to be such as to suit the
men in Class 3, and in certain cases
Class 2.
Appendix “C gives us the following informa-
tion :
(a) Trade or manufacture, &c., grouped under
(b) Dissection of each, laying bare the separate
departments;
(c) In which the avocations required to suit
our purpose are particularized ;
*


(o') Give the minimum wage of each ;
(e) Period of training required to learn each;
(/) Approximate number of men now engaged
in each;
{(/) Whether the work is heavy, medium, or
light.
There are in all over 200 avocations, comprising
a total of 13,000 men, thus affording a fairly large
field of labour to operate in. From time to time
the Inspectors will add to the list herein given, as
suitable avocations present themselves.
In actual practice the ■ Technical Expert of the
State War Council need not be rigidly confined to
those avocations with a maximum of thirteen
lunar months’ training, but might be allowed
some latitude.
The skilful industrious trainee will not be content
to remain in a lower paid avocation in the work-
shop he may be placed in. Employers are only
too glad to encourage their men to acquire a
knowledge of the more skilled work, which carries
increased remuneration.
I think my readers will agree with me that the
Factory Inspectors deserve every credit for their
patriotic work. I am especially indebted to
Messrs. Hall, Billingham, Bishop, and Pemberton,
who composed the sub-committee of the committee
of investigation, which comprised all the Inspectors.
/
Having obtained a long list of suitable avoca-
tions that should spread the returned soldiers
like a veneer over many workshops and factories,


I have now to try and indicate how the returned
soldiers can be taken to the jobs, and right here
I find myself entirely in the hands of the employers
and the trade unions.
If we cannot get these two chief factors in our
problem to join hands to help the returned
soldiers to a reasonable scheme of Vocational
Training, we might just as well throw up the
sponge ; for if these men who are the life blood of
our industrial, manufacturing, and commercial
activities do not join the States’ War Councils
in an earnest practical effort to achieve this
national obligation, which we all recognise and
should have so much at heart, nothing whatever will
be done, and we shall continue to spout patriotism
and write complaints to the Press in vain.
I do not ask the “ lion to lie down with the
lamb ” in what I am going to propose later on ;
but I do appeal most earnestly to both sides to
sink for a while the distrust that exists between
them, and which I have had evidence of in my
investigations.
I ask both sides to believe that I am entirely
impartial in my endeavour to solve the difficulties
that our industrial laws present to the solution
of the problem I am facing, in what I hope may
not be a vain effort.
I shall now endeavour to present the views of
both sides as I have heard them in the course of
my inquiry, and I start out by declaring em-
phatically that I believe both sides to be equally
willing and anxious to show their patriotic
sympathy for the returned soldier.


The Case for the Employers.
Employers everywhere are, I am sure, willing to
do what they can to help in the training of the
men, so that they may be able to make a fresh
start in civil life under the most favorable
circumstances.
Very little has been done in this direction up
to the present, and the chief reason why this is so
has been the absence of any clearly defined practical
scheme that would be likely to meet the wishes of
employers and the demands of the unions in
connexion with our industrial laws.
Employers generally recognise that they should
help the State War Council in this phase of
Repatriation; but they justly contend that it is
not reasonable to expect them to pay the minimum
wage to men while training them, and when the
value of the work done by the trainees is much
below the minimum wage they are compelled by
law to pay in such circumstances.
Why, they ask, should so large a share of the
burden of Vocational Training fall upon them, in
addition to whatever taxation that may be imposed,
while the rest of the community have to pay that
taxation only ?
They urge that if a reasonable scheme of
Vocational Training were introduced, in which the
wages to be paid while training bore a closer
relationship to the value of the services given by
the trainees, they could undertake the work even
if they lost by it to some small extent.


The Case for the Trades Hall.
In order to be quite clear in my mind upon the
attitude of the unions in connexion with certain
phases of Repatriation that touch upon trade
practices and the minimum wage, I have had two
lengthy discussions (with a considerable interval
between them, to allow of mutual digestion of each
other’s views) at the Trades Hall, with a con-
siderable number of representative men, and
generally debated with them matters connected
with Industrial Repatriation, under the presidency
of one of my colleagues on the State War Council—
Mr. Bennett —who is the Trades Hall representa-
tive thereon.
The union delegates made it quite clear that the
trades unionists insisted upon the law in connexion
with the minimum wage, which makes it obligatory
that the employer must pay that wage, being
rigidly adhered to in the case of soldier trainees.
They did not urge this on the merits of the case,
but on the broad grounds of fixed union policy.
They urge that it took them many years to obtain
the minimum wage, which is now rigidly fenced
about by the law against trespassers, and they
think any attempt to waive the enforcement of
its exaction in this instance will be quite futile.
I am satisfied that there will be no yielding upon
this matter, which is one of the fundamental
principles of trade unionism in Australia.
The delegates were very earnest in their desire
to help the returned soldiers in their training in


any other way. I have no doubt whatever that,
whenever it is consistent with their fundamental
rules, the utmost sympathy and help will be
given by unionists to the trainees in the life of the
workshop and factory, where they may depend
upon the daily guidance and advice of the unionists.
A Suggested Solution.
The scheme outlined herein is an attempt to
meet the reasonable contention of the employers
that too great a disproportion of the cost of training
should not fall on their shoulders, and, at the same
time, comply with the rigidly held view of the
unions, that the trainee must receive the minimum
wage of the avocation he is learning while he is
being taught.
•
I have verified the fact that in a private work-
shop the industrial law makes it obligatory for
the employer to fay the minimum wage of the
avocation being taught, in the case of an adult
learning it.
There is only one way to reconcile the conflicting
views of the employer and the Trades Hall, and
that is to do what both consider absolutely neces-
sary to overcome their mutual opposition, and I
am facing that only way in my suggested recon-
ciliatory scheme.
In other words, I propose that when soldier
trainees are being trained by private employers,
they shall be paid the minimum wage of the


avocation they are being taught while they are
learning it, and, if there is no minimum wage
created for a particular, avocation, the wage to
be paid, under the above circumstances, shall be
that which is customarily paid for the work at
the time the trainee starts work, and that a reim-
bursement of part of this wage be made to the
employer by the State War Council, as I hold,
strongly, it would be unreasonable to expect the
employer to bear the loss attending such a system
of training for the reasons given elsewhere.
After a great deal of inquiry, I have come to the
conclusion that a fair reimbursement to the
employer on the part of the State War Council
of the minimum wage which this scheme proposes
should be paid to the trainee should be one-third
of the total amount of the wages paid during the
whole period of training, and that .this should be
paid every four weeks on the following graduated
scale.
As the service of the trainee is of small value
for some time after he begins his training, and
as it is then that the employer has to detail a man
to tram him, it is a reasonable thing to largely
increase the reimbursement to the employer
during this period of training.
The graduated scale given below has been
carefully compiled to represent the gradually
increasing value of the trainee’s labour, and the
final diminution of the reimbursement in the
last month of a thirteen lunar months’ period of
training.

To ascertain by means of this Table the amounts to be paid by the employer and the War
Council respectively, for the successive periods of four weeks included in the period of training
decided upon, multiply the total of the weekly wage for four weeks by the decimal proportion
shown opposite each, under the successive four-weekly periods, thus
Assuming that the period of training has been fixed at twenty weeks (i.e., five four-weekly
periods) and the wage to be paid to the employee at 50s. per week, the proportions are ascertained
as under; —


Any attempt to deal with each individual case
separately, in an endeavour to assess the value of
each trainee’s work in a private establishment,
with the object of calculating how much in each
case should be paid by the State War Council to
each and every employer, would cause so much
work in checking, and so much difference of opinion,
that it would need an army of inspectors and tax
our supervision beyond our powers.
To keep “ tag ” in every case would be a hope-
less task.
The employer should take “ the fat with lean,”
and each side to the bargain should give and take.
I have mentioned elsewhere that the total
sustenance allowance now made to trainees in
Technical Schools while being trained, counting in
the pension, if there is one, is £2 2s. per week°for
a single man, and £2 12s. for a married man, with
an allowance of 3s. 6d. extra for each child. ’
If the trainee in a private workshop received
the full minimum wage while being trained, an
important distinction at once arises between the
man learning at a Technical School and the man
learning at a private workshop.
We will assume that the minimum wage is £3
per week in the private workshop and that the
men in each case are single men.
The single man in the Technical School receives
£2 2s. per week, while the single man in the private
workshop receives £3 per week; but that is not all.
If the men in each case have the same pension,
say, for instance, £1 per week, the man at the
Technical School has his pension merged in his
sustenance allowance, and, therefore, still gets no
more than the £2 25., while the man at the private


workshop gets his £3, plus pension of £l, or a total
of £4 per week, a difference in favour of the private
workshop of £1 18s. per week!
If such a state of affairs were allowed to continue,
the Technical Schools would be deserted for the
private employer.
This is the “fly in the ointment” in the proposed
scheme.
Of course it is out of the question to allow such
an anomaly, apart altogether from its disastrous
effect on Technical School training; if permitted
to exist, it would he a sheer waste of money that
no excuse could condone.
Trainees should not be entitled to receive more
than a reasonable sustenance allowance while
being trained in an avocation that is going to
enable them to earn a better livelihood than
would be possible otherwise.
It might just as reasonably be contended that a
returned soldier being trained in an Agricultural
College should receive the wage of an agricultural
worker during his training instead of a sustenance
allowance, or that the trainee of a Technical School
should receive the minimum wage of the craft he
is learning as paid by a private employer for such
work.
Now, how are we going to remove the fly in this
ointment ?
We must pay the minimum wage in private
employ, and this proposed scheme admits that it
should be paid and recommends it.
The object of the unions, in insisting that the
minimum wage must be paid, is clearly to prevent
the employer from exploiting the soldier, trainee
926 3
33


to the disadvantage of the ordinary trained worker,
whom the soldier trainee might displace, if he were
allowed to work as an “ approver,” for instance.
The best way out of this dilemma that I can
suggest is to fix an adequate uniform sustenance
allowance for single and married trainees in agree-
ment with the “ Returned Sailors and Soldiers
Association” for all Vocational Training, in either
Technical Schools or private establishments, and
add to a man’s pension the amount required to
secure that allowance ; but if the minimum wage
should, with or without a pension, increase the
weekly wage to over the sustenance allowance, then
deduct the difference, which should be returned to
the State War Council.
The money thus deducted does not, in this
arrangement, go into any wages fund, but into
the funds of the Council which exists for the
purpose of ameliorating the returned soldiers’ con-
dition in various ways.
This course should also be discussed with the
“ Returned Sailors and Soldiers Association,” and
their approval obtained.
I can think of no other reasonable way out of
this apparent cul-de-sac.
I do not think the Trades Hall would stand
in the way. I have conserved their fundamental
principle of the minimum wage in the best way
I know how, and they will, no doubt, look upon
this suggested solution with a reasonable eye.
Moreover, I have spread the Vocational Training
of the returned soldiers over a large variety of
avocations, with the object of causing only the
minimum of interference with the workers
generally.


It will be necessary, where the men are placed
as trainees in private establishments, that a legal
contract shall be entered into by the parties
concerned, viz., the trainee, the employer, and the
Secretary of the State War Council; and I give in
Appendix “B ” a suggested form of contract
(drawn up by Mr. Norman, of the Crown Solicitor’s
Department), which is also an indenture. This
indenture should be in triplicate, one part to be
retained by the State War Council, one part by
the employer, and one part by the trainee, and,
as a matter of administration and practice, the
certificate of competency could be indorsed on the
trainee’s copy, and on the Council’s, also.
The form of the certificate can follow as nearly
as may be the wording of the employer’s covenant
to give the same.
This is essential, in my opinion, to secure the
Council against neglect on the part of the trainee
to diligently apply himself to his training, &c. ;
and on the part of the employer to properly
discharge his obligation to the trainee.
Such a contract will help to “ stiffen ” the
trainee’s desire to learn a new avocation, which
at first may be irksome to him ; and in the case of
the employer it must be borne in mind that the
proposed reimbursement of one third of the
minimum wage he will have to pay the trainee is
much heavier in the initial stage of the training,
and it is just at that stage that there is most risk
of failure on both the part of the trainee and the
employer, with the consequent larger loss to the
State War Council in its disbursements.


Inspection.
It will be necessary to have adequate inspection
and oversight of vocational trainees in private
workshops and factories, &c., and for this purpose
there will have to be a number of inspectors. In
this connexion it may be advisable to arrange with
the Secretary of Labour in each State for his
factory inspectors to do all the inspection that they
can in ordinary routine matters, while some of
them who may be technically competent might
deal with technical matters, all under the direction
of the State War Council’s officers.
In the daily course of their duties the factory
inspectors have to visit frequently the very places
where our trainees are at work, and it seems a
common-sense arrangement to make use of their
services to whatever extent it is possible to do so.
Employers do not like to have strange men
poking about their workshops, while they are
well acquainted with and have confidence in these
State officers.
It will also be necessary to keep an eye upon the
men for some time after they are trained and
placed in work, and thus thrown upon their own
resources, to see that they get some encouragement,
and that they get a fair deal in the battle of life,
and to insure this it will be incumbent to keep a
complete card index register of the men for some
time after they are trained. Here, again, the
factory inspectors’ services ought to be of value.
Joint Committees of Employers and
Workmen.
In order to insure greater harmony, and, also,
with the object of enlisting the full aid and


sympathy of employers and the Trades Hall, it
has been suggested that joint committees consisting
of employers or their representatives and workmen
in every section of industrial and manufacturing
activity should be formed for the better attainment
of these objects.
Something of the kind has been in existence in
the boot factory trade in connexion with trainees
in the avocations taught therein.
This suggestion is well worthy of the attention
of the employers and their workmen. Such joint
committees should play an important part in
avoiding friction, and showing the trainees that the
“ Boss ” and the trainee’s own comrades were
mutually concerned in his training and future
prospects.
These committees should not only concern
themselves with the trainee in training, but also
keep in touch with him when he finally learns his
craft and finds employment in the open market.
Disputes Committees.
As disputes between the trainees and the
employers training them are sure to arise, it will
be necessary to have a means of settling them as
they occur, and a good way to deal with the
minor disputes would be for the factory inspectors
to Inquire into them as they made their rounds,
or specially, if necessary.
The district factory inspector seems to me the
proper man to appeal to in minor differences.
In the usual course of their duties these inspectors
are now in the habit of settling complaints made
by employers or the men or the unions. In this
way many small troubles could be adjusted.


If, however, the matter was beyond the power
of the district factory inspector to settle, it could
be dealt with by a “Disputes Committee,”
consisting of a representative of the State War
Council, the district factory inspector, and a
nominee of the Trades Hall if the trainee be a
union man, or, if not, by the trainee’s nominee.
The Approval of the Employers and the
Trades Hall.
It will, of course, be necessary to obtain the
approval of both the employers’ organizations and
the Trades Hall to whatever scheme of Vocational
Training, in private workshops may be adopted,
and also their joint consent to accept the
indenture or certificate of competency issued by
the Council after the men are competent.
The employers and the Trades Hall must be
with the Council in whatever is done.
When the scheme is approved by the Council,
a large number of circulars should be issued
containing an analysis of what is proposed, so that
there may be no misunderstanding of what is
intended.
The proof of this pamphlet was submitted
to Mr. Donald Clark, the Chief Inspector of
Technical Education, and Mr. J. E. Stevens, and
those gentlemen sent a synopsis to the members
of the Council of Technical Education, and a
special meeting of that body was called to discuss
the whole of the views and suggestions made
herein upon Vocational Training, at which I was
present.


The result of our discussion was of value in
modifying some of my views, and in the addition
of some suggestions to what I had already written,
which I have incorporated.
The conference also made it clear that, in the
opinion of the highly qualified experts and
capable business men who were present, the
scheme of Vocational Training herein outlined
was worthy of their concurrence and approval.
Division of Returned Soldiers into Classes.
The returned soldiers should be divided into
four (4) classes, viz. :
Class 1. —Able-bodied men, for -whom the
situations and positions they held when
they enlisted have been kept open for
them by patriotic employers.
Class 2. —Able-bodied men who were out of
work when they enlisted, or who have
been superseded in their absence ;
and invalided and wounded men,
similarly situated, who will become
able-bodied after a period of rest in
a Convalescent Home and be able to
resume their old way of life.
Class 3.—lnvalided and wounded men who
are unable to follow their previous
occupations by reason of their dis-
ability, but who will be capable, after
proper training, to take up other work.
Class 4. —Men who are permanently disabled,
and will be unable to earn their own
living under any circumstances.


Class 1.
No responsibility should rest upon the people
of Australia with respect to the men in this class.
There may, however, be cases where the men
on return are unfitted for their previous work,
either through changed conditions, or through the
effect of their long absence. In such cases these
men should come under Class 2.
While it might be accepted, as a general principle,
that there is no responsibility upon the country
in connexion with the men in Class 1, and it
should be generally recognised that able-bodied
men who return sound and fit, and can go hack to
their old jobs which have been kept open for them,
should do so, and have no material claim on the
Nation whose gratitude they have nobly earned,
and that they will find their reward, as citizens,
in their own virtue, it does not follow that that
is the end of the matter, for it should not be.
The men in Class 1 who desire it should be
encouraged to take up agriculture, as they are just
the kind of men physically that, with proper
training, should succeed on the land.
The men in Class I should not be allowed to
suffer any disability because they were fortunate
enough to return to Australia “able bodied.”
The employers who undertook to keep their
jobs open for them should faithfully carry out
their promises. The men should not only be
restored to their old positions, but should also
receive any promotion or advancement that might
have been given to them had they continued at
their posts, instead of risking all the dangers of
active warfare rather than remain here in security.


Their patriotic service gives them a claim upon
Government Departments and private employers
for special preference whenever and wherever
it can be reasonably given.
Except in agriculture and its kindred pursuits,
and in the matter of preference above suggested,
and also in certain cases where specially capable
young men in this class might be chosen to acquire
technical knowledge in Australia or abroad, in
order to increase the number of our technical
teachers in connexion with agriculture, or the
various industries we may wish to encourage,
it may not be thought necessary for the Nation
to do anything more for them.
As good citizens they have given splendid proof
of their patriotism—like Othello, “ they have done
the State some service and it knows it.”
Let us look at this matter in a plain, common-
sense way. The men all owed a sacred duty to
our country, but when that duty has been well and
faithfully done, and they return to civil life, “ safe
and sound,” they should not look for or expect
any material reward for their services beyond
what I have suggested.
If we are not careful in Australia in this regard,
we will lay the foundation in a smaller way of
the blunders wrought by indiscriminate sentimental
generosity in the United States after their civil
war, which loaded the Union with a vast repatria-
tion expenditure.
A definite policy will have to be laid down in
connexion with the men in Class I and rigidly
adhered to, as above suggested, or we shall be
encouraging many of the men in this class to
expect some material reward for their military
service.


When we reflect upon the millions of men now
engaged in this war, and that in Europe and
the United Kingdom, and in Canada, men in this
class will have to take up their old occupations in
civil life without any reward, it should “ give
us pause to think.”
Class 2.
Steps should be taken to provide employment,
as soon after arrival as possible, for the men in
Class 2.
Machinery such as that hereafter mentioned
should be organized in all the States War Councils’
Employment Bureaux, and in urban and country
sub-agencies, whereby suitable situations may be
found for all able-bodied men in this class at a
remuneration as near to what they were previously
receiving as possible.
In regard to the men in this class who return
able-bodied, the general remarks made in connexion
with the men in Class I apply, once they have
been placed in employment, but as the employ-
ment, generally speaking, that will be available
for men in Class 2 is likely to be of a less perma-
nent or more intermittent character than that
which has been “ kejft open ” for men in Class 1
“ unt il their return,” there are sure to be cases,
and many of them, in which it would be scant
measure to mete out, entirely, the same treat-
ment, and in such cases Vocational Training might
be permitted.
Any of the men in Class 2 who have been wounded
or invalided, and who will regain their old vigour
after a period of recuperation, should have a
claim to be vocationally trained second only to
that given to the men in Class 3.


Class 3.
There is a clearly defined responsibility on the
Nation to come to the help of the men who are
wholly or partially unable, for a time, to earn
their living.
Those who by reason of physical or mental
disability, owing to causes directly due to their
war service, are unable to follow their previous
occupations should be wards of the country until
such time as they are able to earn sufficient to
keep them.
They should be given an opportunity to learn
new ways of earning their bread, and their pen-
sions should be supplemented by the Repatriation
Commission in order that their dependants may
not suffer in those cases where the pension is less
than the maximum pension and the individual
cannot get work.
In the Vocational Training of the men it will be
necessary —
(a) To ascertain exactly the capacity of the
men in Class 3 for productive work
of some special kind.
( b ) To train him in the shortest possible time
to a reasonable standard of productive
efficiency.
(c) To place him in some industrial plant, or
otherwise, at labour which is stable and
healthful.
(i d ) To place him in the various kindred
occupations that are associated with
land settlement, such as poultry farm-
ing, dairy farming, fruit-growing, horti-
culture, &c., when his physical con-
dition warrants it. This kind of work


should be largely earmarked for men
in Class 3, to whom such avocations
should appeal. Any of the men who
have not had previous experience in
these occupations should receive suit-
able training at our Agricultural Col-
leges or State training farms, or at
approved private, farms, before they
are allowed to embark upon their own
resources.
The men in this class have been
inured to an out-of-door life. The
work is eminently healthful, and, on
the whole, an industrious man should
do better on the land in these occupa-
tions, and make a better provision
for his old age, than he could in those
“hired jobs” which keep a man the
servitor of others all the days of his
life.
A married man in Class 3 with a
pension should have no difficulty in
settling himself in life very comfortably
in one of these occupations.
(e) From Class 3 should be largely drawn
the men to be settled in small industries
and small businesses, after a proper
training. The number of such ven-
tures should, however, be strictly
limited, and our efforts to re-establish
the men in Class 3 in civil life should
be restricted as much as possible to
the occupations suggested in (a), (b)
(c), and {d).


(/) Where from any sufficient cause men in
Class 3 cannot be placed in (a), ( b ).
(c), (d), or (c), work might be found
for them as caretakers with (Quarters
or other similar jobs requiring trust-
worthy men, There will be a certain
number of men at a “ loose end ”
with whom it will be hard to deal, and
these will have to be dealt with as
circumstances may dictate.
(i g) The various Federal and State Government
Departments, and Municipal and other
official offices, should be constantly
reminded of their obligation to find
work for the men in Class 3.
While the Working Men’s College and other
Technical Schools can give great service in Voca-
tional Training of the men in Class 3, and in some
cases in Class 2, in various industrial avocations,
there are a number of men in these classes who,
prior to the war, filled clerical or other sedentary
occupations requiring a higher degree of educa-
tion than is to be found in the majority of the men.
At present any of these men who are capable
of doing good clerical work are readily absorbed
in civil life ; they should not, however, be allowed
to disappear to be heard of no more. Any of them
who wish to improve their education, so as to be
better equipped for the battle of life, in any way
that the educational facilities of these colleges
can help in, should be given the opportunity of
studying without expense, the State War Council
paying any necessary cost to enable them to do
so in the way of fees, and if necessary by arranging
with their employers to allow the men time off


for the purpose, the Council contributing to the
cost of enabling this to be done where necessary.
In this same connexion the Universities might
relax their rules and waive or reduce their fees
so as to give the utmost scope to men who, prior
to the war, had actually started to study at the
Universities, but who threw up everything in their
ardour to serve their country. I think such men
should be allowed to resume their studies, and
continue to pursue them free of all fees to those
men who cannot afford them. The self-sacrifice
of these men should not be turned into a bar to
their undertaking a University career.
It is accepted as a reasonable contention in
Canada (although not in Great Britain) that a
man s pension is based upon his actual disability
and not upon his loss of earning power.
It is contended that if a man by his industry or
through the Vocational Training given him by
the Repatriation Commission so equips himself
that he can earn more than he previously could,
his additional earning power should not (as appears
to be the case in England) result in a reduction
of his pension.
I believe this is the view finally taken in
Canada, and it is the one that we should adopt, too,
for it seems to be reasonable to hold the opinion
that the pension granted to a soldier is for “ value
received, to put it in a commercial way, and it
should not be affected when the man is able to
add to it by his skill and industry.
There is a great deal of doubt in the minds of
the returned soldiers who are in receipt of pensions
and also in the minds of the public at large on this
point.


Many think that when a man obtains any em-
ployment that gives him a decent living wage his
pension will be liable to reduction, and cases are
being “quoted” in which the Defence Department
has taken this course.
This point must be cleared up in a definite way,
otherwise the men who receive pensions will
“ stand off ” from Vocational Training, and also
be reluctant to take work that may risk a reduc-
tion in their pensions.
Class 4.
It is probable that many of the men who will
return will be permanently incapacitated from
earning their own living. At the same time some
of them may be able to do a little work.
These men should be given an opportunity of
going to a Permanent Soldiers’ Home, where light
occupations could be found for them. Such Homes
should have a considerable acreage of land, so
that the meat, vegetables, and fruit consumed
might be grown on the land, and the work done by
the inmates.
As all these inmates would be in receipt of pen-
sions, it would be unnecessary to pay more than
nominal wages, and the only expense would be
their,maintenance and the upkeep of the Home.
This will be imperative, in each State, otherwise
many poor fellows will lead shattered, isolated lives,
instead of having a comfortable Home, with social
amenities to brighten their lives, such as we see
in Chelsea Hospital. The existence of such Homes
will afford the great many kind-hearted people in
each State 'a worthy cause in which to exercise
their generosity.


When considering the establishing of these
Homes, the desirability of building a nupober of
small cottages in which the veterans might
“ chum ” together in small parties, and have
their meals in the main building, where the chief
accommodation should be provided, might be
considered.
In these Homes Vocational Training of a simple
character should be introduced by the Vocation
Expert, and no doubt the services of some local
voluntary help would be available to assist.
When designing the Home, provision should be
made for a suitable where power
machinery of a light kind should be provided.
It will be found that there are few men so com-
pletely disabled that they cannot take pleasure in
doing some simple skilled work.
The Blind Soldier.
A very pathetic and heart-moving sight is the
returned blind soldier.
To one born blind the affliction is bad enough,
and every civilized country has provided excellent
institutions for the purpose of housing them, and
caring for them, so that everything may be done
to ameliorate their condition; and a visit to
one of these homes for the blind reveals the resigna-
tion with which individuals so afflicted accept
their fate.
But to the returned soldier nature has not yet
extended her soothing influence. “ Time, the
great healer,” has not yet reconciled the poor chap
to his saddest of all fates.
To have left our bright land full of youthful
vigour and hope, and to return to it in a short time


with the loss of what largely makes life endurable—
lost for ever without hope of recovery—is an awful
lot for any man, no matter how brave he may be.
It is unnecessary to urge that this poor brother
should be cared for. This will be done no matter
how we may fail in other ways, and I have only
this to urge, that the returned blind soldier who
has no wife or children, or no ties, should be placed,
not in a Blind Asylum, but in one of the Homes
which we hope to see provided for the soldiers in
Class 4, where the companionship of his old com-
rades may help to brighten his life.
The veterans in Class 4 can give him “ eyes to
see,” while he can help them with his otherwise
unimpaired physical vigor.
General Supervision of Vocational Training
at the Repatriation Commissioners’
Head-quarters.
The Commission in Canada which supervises
and directs the operations in connexion with Voca-
tional Training, in order to get sound technical
advice, has secured the services of a Vocational
Expert with considerable experience both in
England and Canada of a general character to
direct and supervise their Vocational Training
throughout the Dominion.
I think that our Commission should follow so
good an example, and select one man of general
attainments to direct and supervise this phase of
Repatriation work throughout the Commonwealth.
The importance of having such a man always
available to control, direct, and correlate the opera-
tions in all the States is obvious. Most of the work
will be such as to require the advice and assistance
926. — 4
49


of an all-round capable man at Head-quarters
well versed in Technical matters, and conversant
with the Trade rules and practices in each State.
He should be a salaried officer, and devote his
whole time to the work.
One of his first duties should be the standardi-
zation of the methods to be pursued, and the forms
to be used in all the States. I have a number of
excellent forms used in Vocational Training in
Canada which might be used as examples of what
should be used by us.
The State Machinery for Vocational Training
and obtaining Employment.
At the Head-quarters of each State War Council
there should be a special branch created to take
charge of this combined work in all its phases
throughout the State.
It should be presided over by an officer skilled
in Employment Bureau work rather than one
skilled in technical training, for the following
reasons :
An officer with years of experience in employ-
ment work has a grasp of the operations control-
ling employment throughout the State, which takes
a long time to acquire. He is more in touch with
all the various trades and crafts and the great
variety of callings to be catered for when placing
men in employment. He is used to handling men
seeking work and the employers who want them,
and understands both, and must be a man with a
general all-round knowledge of business methods.


The combination of Vocational Training and
employment in one branch is, I think, very desir-
able, but whether it should be presided over by
an Employment Bureau Officer or a Technical
Expert entirely depends upon the man. If there
is a thoroughly competent employment officer
available, then I distinctly favour his control,
while the Technical Expert can make full use of
the staff.
So that the officer in charge may not be bur-
dened with executive routine, and have time to
devote his mind to the more efficient supervision
of both Vocational Training and employment, he
should have a competent Technical Assistant, and
an Employment Assistant, to take off his hands the
general office work.
There should be a Technical Expert of general
attainments on the .State War Council of each
- State, whose services should be at the Council’s
command, so that his advice and assistance
might be always available; and, as it is not likely
that such a man could be found able to give the
constant service that will be required voluntarily,
it will be necessary to pay him a salary, or,
if his time is not fully taken up, part of
the salary he now receives in his present
position, which, of course, should be kept open
for him. I recommend that this expert should be
on the Council as well as a paid officer—an unusual
combination—because I am convinced his presence
there would prevent the honorary committee
which I recommend later on from straying away
from grace in the discussion of purely technical
matters in a committee largely concerned with such
subjects.


With an honorary medical man or two also on
the Council, and two or three other honorary suit-
able business men members of the Council, an
advisory committee could be formed in connexion
with this branch of the Council’s work. While,
no doubt, the Secretary of the State War Council,
who will be the Commission’s Chief Executive
Officer, will really be the responsible man whose
“ word goes,” it would be a politic thing to also
have the assistance in an advisory capacity of
suitable representative men, who might in the eyes
of the public “ leaven the ‘ official ’ mass.”
The President of the Returned Soldiers Asso-
ciation for the time being in each State should be
a member of the State War Council. This should
be of much service in removing any suspicion
from the minds of the men that the wishes of
their association are not heeded.
The Secretary of the State War Council should
make it his duty to have frequent discussions with
the Secretary of the Returned Soldiers Association,'
so that he may know how things are going from
the latter’s point of view.
The Technical member of the Council should
particularly supervise everything connected with
Vocational Training, and, for a considerable time,
he should devote all his energy to the task, so that
a good foundation might be assured. And after
things are in good running order, it should not be
necessary for him to devote more than a part of his
time to the work.
It will be necessary to have a Technical man
in the larger cities, such as Ballarat, Bendigo, and
Geelong, to supervise the local activities in those
cities and the country districts adjoining, otherwise
there will not be sufficient purview over them.


The men appointed to such places might also super-
vise employment. There should be an office in
each of those cities, where men might register for
employment, &c. The Technical Expert could
also keep local interest active generally.
In most cases the choice of a new trade or calling
should not be left to the untutored invalided soldier,
whose general ignorance of his own adaptability
may be intensified by his physical or mental weak-
ness.
In all cases the invalided man’s choice should be
tactfully influenced by the Technical Expert, who
alone is competent to guide the man to a wise
selection, in consultation with a medical man.
This phase of Vocational Training must not be lost
sight of by the Selection Committee of the State
War Council.
While the choice of what skilled callings a man
weakened by the war may take up should not be
left to his own judgment alone, care should be
taken to give full value to his own predilection,
which should not be ignored altogether.
In selecting men, it will be necessary to exercise
discrimination to insure that they are physically and
mentally suitable, and this should be done by a
Selection Committee.
This Committee should consist of the Officer in
Charge of the Vocational and Employment Branch,
the State War Council’s Technical Expert, and
one of the State War Council’s honorary medical
men.
When selecting men there should be no need for
a medical examination in every case, where the
medical member of the Selection Committee is


satisfied with a perusal of the Army Surgeon’s
certificate, and there should be only occasional
need to re-examine men in any case ; but, of
course, this should be entirely determined by our
medical adviser.
Suitable Workshops for Technical Training.
Full use should be made of all the Technical
Colleges and Schools in each State for Vocational
Training, and of all competent voluntary help.
The facilities that exist in the capital of each
State for training may, or may not, be capable
of sufficient expansion to cater for the men whose
homes are there, but I am afraid there will be
difficulty in the country towns which may not have
Technical Schools. Then, again, the fact thatthere
will not he so many men trained in the highly-
skilled trades, and that a great many will be trained
in a multiplicity of skilled jobs, spread all over
the entire industrial, manufacturing, and com-
mercial establishments in each capital, and in the
inland cities and towns, will affect the situation,
so far as our Technical Schools are concerned,
where no doubt there exist the means of training
men in the more highly-skilled trades, but which
have not the knowledge, perhaps, to tackle the
great variety of skilled work that it is expected
will be open to Vocational Training in the
larger number of workshops and factories that it is
hoped will be available.
This aspect of the matter has perhaps not been
thought of.
It is quite clear that if we get the great bulk of
the training in private establishments it will ease


the situation in connexion with the Technical
Schools, both in the capital cities and inland cities
possessing such schools.
In many country towns which have not got
Technical Schools and from which, and the vicinity,
a fair number of men enlisted, there should be some
organization for the training of men in various
skilled work, and in such places the existence of
“ Soldiers’ Aid and Employment Committees ”
should be of great service in arousing public effort
to do something to help to re-establish the men in
new occupations. This is a ■ matter that should
engage the attention of our Technical Expert.
The use of private workshops and factories in
the country towns which have not got Technical
Schools will absorb a number of men, as the towns
inland having such schools are few.
Something should be done to establish Technical
Schools in a greater number of towns in the
country than now exist, and the present seems to
be a suitable time to make a start, using some
public building for the purpose, such as a court
house, town hall, or similar building.
To revert to the question of training men in the
highly-skilled trades requiring years of training.
We all had some idea of this at the beginning,
but a better acquaintance with the problem
diminishes the probability of any such application
of Repatriation Funds, so much so as to reduce
it to a very small percentage. This, I repeat, alters
the whole prospect very materially.
The resources of our Agricultural Colleges will
be taxed to adequately train the men who will


decide to settle on the land, and, no doubt, the
existing institutions for training will have to be
increased in size and in number.
It is a golden opportunity that is now forced
upon the Governments of the States to place their
Agricultural Colleges on a truly National basis.
We are behind other countries in the facilities
for agricultural training, and, until recent years,
in our facilities for technical education in Aus-
tralia. This remissness is not due to want of
capable men to “ blaze the way,” but to other
causes. The time is ripe for our Premiers and
their Cabinets to give their attention to the
very important questions of scientific agricultural
training and technical education in every part of
the Commonwealth.
Now is the time to give the skilled experts in
each State their heads. These men are well aware
of what is being done in the United States, Canada,
and Germany, in recent years, to raise the standards
of efficiency in Agriculture, Industry, and Com-
merce, but have had to content themselves with
doing as much as they could with the scanty means
afforded them ; their views have been circum-
scribed and their energies curbed by want of funds.
We should now set to work and, out of the im-
perative necessity to train a large number of
War Veterans, we should set the required machinery
in motion that will secure a general all-round
improvement in efficiency. This little digression
is not apologized for. Vocational Training is our
theme. Its absolute necessity having been de-
monstrated by war’s stern lessons, we would
indeed be wanting in National common sense
if we did not profit by them.


An Appeal for the Recognition of Australian
Ability, Initiative, and Efficiency.
I wish to make an appeal to Australians to
recognise and reward Australian ability, initiative,
and efficiency in every walk of our commercial,
agricultural, and industrial life.
At the other end of the world there are a great
many thousands of Australia’s picked sons dis-
playing all the courage, intelligence, and initiative
that are so eminently required in the modern
soldier.
These gallant young men have shown that they
possess all the qualities which we should desire
to see applied to the improvement of our agri-
cultural and industrial activities, and these same
qualities now ripening in the stern school of war
will be at the service of the nation, to be marshalled
and directed into the channels of peaceful enter-
prise at its close.
Let this great war clear our vision in this regard
and give us more faith in our own sons.
Things after the war are not going to run in the
old grooves. The war has shaken us all up, and
the minds of men are thinking of increased efficiency
in every walk of life.
A considerable number of young returned
soldiers, chosen for their ability and fitness,
ought to be sent to the United Kingdom, the
United States, and Canada, to serve an appren-
ticeship at various skilled industries we may decide
to encourage, and to study at Agricultural Colleges
and Technical Schools; and the same thing should
be done in Australia up to the limit of our resources,


in order that we may be able later on to provide
teaching staffs to adequately deal with our
expansion.
While, no doubt, the great aim of Australian
statesmen will be to do everything possible to
increase natural production, and it is being realized
that the return of a host of young men after the
war offers a splendid opportunity to give an impetus
to the cultivation of the varied products of the soil,
they will also, I feel sure, grasp the importance
of doing what is possible to make Australia more
self supporting.
The marvellous expansion of Germany in the
last 40 years in agricultural industry and com-
merce has not sprung from individual enterprise
alone, on which the British people are too prone
to rely. No ! It is due to the better technical
training of the young, the general adoption of
more scientific methods in agriculture and industry,
and the carefully thought out and discriminating
financial assistance of the State.
The Employment Bureau.
The information from our soldiers abroad re-
garding the various trades and avocations of the
men, with their suggestions as to new avocations
on their return, from those who have no special
skilled occupations, together with the intimations
of those who wish to settle on the land, &c.,
should not be lost sight of, but should be classified,
with the view of seeing what the directions are in
which we might have to provide employment for
the men when the war is over.


Office Arrangements at the Bureau.
The methods pursued by the officer in charge of
the Victorian Bureau are given below, and, as this
officer has had many years’ practical experience
in this kind of work, his operations may be taken
to indicate broadly what is required to efficiently
carry on this important work, which is diligently
and successfully carried out by him and his staff.
The card system has been installed, and all
applications, both for employment and for
employees, are registered and carded daily, and at
the close of each day each file completed is properly
noted and put away, so that on the next day a clear
start is made, the only papers on hand being those
dealing with vacant positions and unemployed
applicants.
The following methods are adopted :
Employers’ Applications.
On receipt of the morning mail, a daily list of
vacancies is posted in the public room, and this
is revised about every half-hour, the positions
taken being deleted, and new ones added.
Employers’ applications are registered daily,
and if not immediately filled are kept standing for
a reasonable time, when the employer is asked if
the vacancy is still open.
If there is any doubt in regard to a vacancy, a
telegram or phone message is sent to the employer
before a man is sent along.
When an employer calls at the office, an
endeavour is made to meet his requirements from
those waiting, and if none are available, his
application is treated in the same manner as one
received by post.


When any position is filled, the applicant’s
name is indorsed on the application, and also on
the employer’s card. Before dealing with an
application, previous applications, if any, are
attached.
Applications for Employment.
Each applicant for employment on arrival
daily records his name with the Sergeant in charge
of the public room, so that he may be dealt with
m his turn. If it is his first appearance, he fills in
an application form, which the Sergeant checks,
and notes thereon the character indorsed on his
discharge. If he has previously called, his former
application is obtained and utilized.
The applicants are then called in order of arrival.
As soon as an applicant is sent to employment,
the name of his employer is indorsed on his
application form, and also on his registration
card. If employment is found in the country
districts, provided it is necessary, he is granted a
railway pass, and sometimes a pass for the coach.
In special cases dungarees or necessary tools are
provided, and arrangements are made for him to
get a small monetary grant from the Repatriation
Funds.
By these means a record is kept both on
employers’ and employees’ files and cards of each
transaction.
No application for temporary relief is dealt with
unless the applicant is registered in the Employ- '
ment Bureau if he is in a condition to work, and a
certificate to that effect is given him to present to
the Repatriation relief officers.


If at the end of the day there are likely applicants
registered who may suit vacancies on hand, they
are asked to call, and the vacancies are held over
for them specially.
If applicants asked to call fail to reply, or if
applicants registered do not call at the office for a
period of fourteen days, it is considered they have
found work, and their applications are indorsed
“ Put away pending further call ” (with the date),
and filed away.
Applicants for special classes of work are
registered under the particular heading required,
and when vacancies arise are sent for in their
turn.
Returned men only are sent to Government
positions, except in very special cases, such as a
man permanently injured whilst in camp.
In other circumstances precedence is given to
the returned man, and to married men over single
men.
Great care is exercised to send along only men
who after exhaustive inquiry are deemed suitable
for the work. Often men have' to be dissuaded
from accepting employment they consider they
can do. Others, especially unskilled labourers,
are often placed in factories and workshops they
have never before been in, and in the great majority
of cases they have proved good workers.
The shortage of workers in special trades has
led employers to take partly skilled men and give
them a fair trial. This has provided work for
numbers of men, and it is hoped further facilities
will be offering.


A daily record is kept of all cases dealt with,
and a return is submitted to the Secretary of the
Council weekly.
The secret of success in the matter is the
completion of each day’s work on the day it is
received, for if any portion of one day’s transac-
tions are allowed to stand over to the next con-
fusion will surely result.
To illustrate the methods of the Victorian State
War Council’s Employment Bureau, I give below, in
some detail, the various steps taken to find em-
ployment for the returned soldiers, which show
that a fairly complete scheme is in operation.
I particularize what has been done, and is being
projected, in order to emphasize the fact that if,
in spite of the minuteness of its detail work, this
Bureau has failed to engage all the activities of
the country districts, it is less the fault of the State
War Council than of that want of organization
outside its 'purview, which exists in the sparser
population of the provinces, a remedy for dealing
with which I venture to suggest later on.
Methods Adopted by Employment Bureau
in Securing Positions for Returned
Soldiers.
Placards are exhibited in public places and
Railway Stations.
Cards are exhibited in shop and office windows.
Newspaper advertisements.
Frequent newspaper paragraphs in all the
papers of the State.


Lantern slides in Theatres and Picture Shows
arranged.
Newspapers’ advertisements studied and likely
Employers communicated with.
Telephone largely used to get in touch with
Employers.
Circularizing of Manufacturers, Wholesale and
Retail Merchants, frequently.
Circulation of lists showing classes of men avail-
able, frequently sent to about 1,000 Employers,
covering Metropolitan and Country areas.
The assistance of the Railway Department,
which has taken a large number of men, and with-
out whose active sympathy and assistance we might
have fared badly in the earlier stages of our
operations.
The assistance of the Government Departments
generally.
The co-operation of all the organizations of
Employers, embracing through their affiliated
societies practically all the Employers of the State,
has been sought, and Sub-Committees of such
organizations have been created to work in unison
with the War Councils’ Employment Committee.
The active co-operation of the “ War Service ”
Committees throughout the State has been sought.
The employment, when available, of a certain
number of Recruiting Sergeants to act as Employ-
ment “ Scouts ” for the Bureau.
The co-operation of all Church organizations,
the Y.M.C.A., and kindred associations.
The co-operation of all the Friendly Societies,
Agricultural Societies, Racing Clubs, and all Sports
Clubs.


The valuable help of the Secretary for Labour
and his agents throughout the State has been
generously offered.
The active co-operation of the Trades Hall
through the various Unions will be of especial help.
The Commercial Travellers of the State, as they
visit every “ nook and corner ” of the land, will
plead our cause.
The Police everywhere have been asked, through
the Chief Commissioner, to give their individual
help, and their intimate knowledge of all local
conditions will render their aid of especial value.
All Mayors, Shire Presidents, and Municipal
Officers have been enlisted in our campaign, and
can render us great aid.
Ihe Railways Commissioners have agreed to
Stationmasters, in the country, acting as agents
for our Bureau. These officers cover the greater
part of the State, and are in constant touch with
the Commercial, Industrial, and Grazing sections
of the people and with all the various cultivators
of the soil. The local Stationmaster knows every-
body, sees everybody, and can give us great personal
service.
Up to the middle of February the Employ-
ment Bureau of the State War Council has found
employment for over 5,000 men. In some cases
the same men have registered more than once
since they returned. All the same, the large number
of men placed in work shows that the returned
soldiers are steadily resuming their places in civil
life.


Suggested "Soldiers’ Aid and Employment
Committees.”
Throughout the Dominion of Canada “Welcome
and Employment Committees” of citizens are
being established in every city, town, and village,
in order to engage the assistance of the whole
community in the work of finding employment
for the returned soldiers. These local committees
are springing up everywhere, and are a great aid
in finding work locally, and will prove of still greater
assistance as time goes on. They fix the minds
of the whole people on the great problem, and
each such committee vies with its neighbours to
achieve a greater result.
It is a capital movement, and we should imitate
it in Australia without delay. While the State
War Council is doing good work in obtaining
employment for Returned Soldiers, the response
from the country districts is not as general as it
ought to be. lam sure that the lack of develop-
ment in this direction is not due to want of
sympathy, and I am also sure that a large number
of returned invalided men have been quietly
re-absorbed into country life ; but while that is
so in some country districts, it is not so in others,
and it is growing more and more evident that
something must be done to rouse and organize
the Repatriation movement in connexion with
employment all over the State.
The State War Council has asked all the War
Service Committees, Municipalities, and Shires to
give their aid, and the Press also is helping, but
these, and other isolated agencies, are not enough.
The whole State should be roused, and the best
way to do that is for the elected leaders of the
926.-6
65


people to open a campaign on behalf of the Re-
turned Soldiers, and by the assistance of Mayors
and Councillors, and other, representative men,
have public meetings convened with the object of
forming “ Soldiers’ Aid and Employment Com-
mittees,” to watch over the interests and welfare
of the local soldiers.
It must be remembered that it is now —not
next month or next year —but now that we have
the Returned Invalided or Wounded Soldier with
us. The great majority of the men now returning
to Australia are the poor fellows who have been
wounded or weakened by disease and hardship—
the gallant men “ who have fallen by the way,”
and have been reported unfit for active service
in the field.
It is now that our sympathy should be roused,
for at no time in the future are there likely to be
more invalided soldiers than what we have right
now constantly arriving. Some of the men recover
sufficiently to be able to take various kinds of
work, but many have been less fortunate, and
their cases call for all our sympathy. All the
men, no matter how much they may have rallied
since they left the theatre of war, are now, and
will be for some time, sufferers from the strain,
and employers will have to bear this in mind and
deal sympathetically with them.
If each city, town, and village had its local
“ Soldiers’ Aid and Employment Committee,” there
would be innumerable nuclei of active assistance
established to give effect to the heart’s desire of
all of us to do something to show our gallant boys
that we are grateful.


During the winter of this year the State War
Council of Victoria will find it impossible to place
all the men desiring employment, and fit for it,
unless it receives more active assistance from both
urban and country sources.
If the above suggestion to establish local com-
mittees is put into effect, such committees should
notify their creation to the State War Council,
send a list of their officers, and ask for instructions.
It should be the duty of such committees to make
a Register of local employers and a Register of
applicants. Inquire into the opportunities of em-
ployment, exert their individual private influence
to obtain employment, and officially to bring the
matter under employers’ notice by circular. To
furnish the Central Bureau with complete infor-
mation of the disposition of the men that work
has been found for, and to keep a kindly purview
over them, to give suggestions to the Central
Bureau which their local knowledge may inspire,
to furnish information of promised openings, and
to be prepared to undertake inquiries the Central
Bureau may desire, and aid that Bureau in all
ways. These committees might also be of great
assistance as general local agents to the Repatria-
tion Commission in each State in a variety of
ways. w
The Aftermath of the War.
While the placing of the men now returning to
Australia in civil occupations is more immediately
engaging our attention, steps should be taken
throughout all the States to meet the great influx
of returned soldiers at the termination of the war.
This phase of the aftermath of the war will tax
our resources to a greater degree than we have
ever had any experience of.


It is absolutely necessary to endeavour to devise
means to mitigate the hardships and the financial
difficulties that unpreparedness will surely bring in
their train. By a timely recognition of the magni-
tude of the task we may do much to ease the situa-
tion when it arises.
The Federal and State Parliaments should tackle
this matter at once. Short of doing all that we
can to help the Empire to a successful conduct
of the war, there is no more important matter
than this one, which should engage the attention
of our Parliaments, to the exclusion of a variety
of comparatively unimportant local matters, the
postponement of which might well be agreed to.
What do all the usual controversies that keep
Parliaments busy matter compared with the great
—the vital—subjects of the successful conduct
of the war and the mitigation of its more im-
mediate effects ?
In Canada they have already undertaken the
task of preparing for the great influx of
men, when the war is over, by projecting large
public utility works such as railways and roads,
&c., which will have to be provided sooner or
later in any case, and which if undertaken a
little earlier will help to absorb the men more
readily, and pay the nation better, even if higher
interest is paid for the necessary capital, than to
have to keep the men in “ camps of succour ”
idling their time, or giving them useless tasks
pending the time of gradual absorption.
Now is the time to deal with the afforestation
problem in Australia, which, if proper arrange-
ments were made, should absorb large numbers of
the returned soldiers.


An Appeal for Every One’s Help in all
Phases of Repatriation.
The official authorities to whom is intrusted the
important task of repatriating the returned
soldiers in civil life, both in regard to land settle-
ment and general Repatriation outside land settle-
ment, will have work requiring great administra-
tion and organizing capacity, at the hands of men
who for some years must make it their sole concern.
They should have no other business to attend to
that will distract them from their official duties
in connexion with Repatriation.
I write here of the executive officials—the salaried
officers.
Only thus can satisfactory executive work be
done.
While this must be conceded, so far as the
permanent officials are concerned, it should not be
assumed that, because the Repatriation work is
intrusted to capable men, wholly devoted to the
work, and with sufficient funds at their disposal
to finance the various schemes that will be under-
taken, that, therefore, the sympathetic assistance
of the citizens of Australia need not be engaged
in helping in the great work, and that they may
leave the whole of the trouble to the officials,
while they—the citizens—merely pay the taxation.
No matter how capable the officials may be to
control and direct Repatriation, the aid of the
people at large, competent and willing to help,
cannot be dispensed with in so great a national
undertaking.
Every citizen is financially interested in Repa-
triation .


The controlling authorities must have agencies
spread all over the country, and if all these agencies
had to be paid it would entail a greater expendi-
ture than there should be any necessity to incur.
A great deal of voluntary help is a sine qua non,
where a truly national and patriotic work has to
be carried to a successful conclusion.
If this is not given public enthusiasm will wane
after the war is over, and destructive criticism, in
which we Australian people are very prone to
indulge, will take the place of voluntary help.
In this connexion the creation of “ Soldiers’ Aid
and Employment Committees ” in every city,
town, and village might take the places of the
various organizations now in existence —which
might all (Red Cross alone excepted) be merged
in the above suggested new organization.
The existence of one organization such as this,
devoted to any and every phase of Repatriation,
with the one exception above mentioned, would pro-
vide the Repatriation authorities with ready made
agencies everywhere, and save a lot of working
expenses, as well as concentrate in the hands of
one association patriotic work, which otherwise
will be dissipated in aimless and undisciplined
ways.
Appeal to Women.
In any efforts that may be made to secure a
suitable re-settlement of the returned soldiers in
civil life, the aid of the women of Australia is just
as necessary as that of the men to the Repatriation
Commission.
Indeed, I will go further and state that in many
ways the help of women should be of more
efficacy.


While there are organizations of women for
various purposes in connexion with the war, and
their influence is paramount in Red Cross work, I
do not know of any attempt to make use of them
in connexion with the Repatriation of the returned
soldiers, and it is this aspect of affairs that engages
my undivided attention just now.
I wish to direct the attention of women to what
I have written in favour of “ Soldiers’ Aid and
Employment Committees ” being established in
every city, town, and village in the land, whose
sole concern should be the welfare of our veterans.
“ Men forget but women do not! ” Men are
engaged in the struggle for existence, and those of
them with time to spare from their places of business
and offices are limited.
We have not got in Australia a leisured class of
men, and a class of men with administrative
capacity and sufficient leisure, such as exist in the
United Kingdom to a large extent, and from whose
ranks efficient organizers and helpers can be
obtained to give a sustained impetus to any public
movement such as Repatriation.
We have not got the men here in sufficient
numbers, “ at a loose end,” to permit of a thorough
organization for the welfare of our veterans such
as I wish to see established with its agencies and
branches, in every corner of the land, and I am
afraid that if we trust to men alone for the creation
and extension of such a movement we may not
be entirely successful.
Women have more enthusiasm than men, and
if we could engage their aid in this great work
I feel certain that its success would be assured.


I wish to make an earnest appeal to women of
all ranks of society to take a hand in this “ labour
of love.”
Is there a woman in Australia whose heart has
not responded with a prideful throb to the gallant
deeds of our boys in every theatre of this greatest
of all wars ? Is there one who does not wish to
show her gratitude to the brave men who, but for
an accident of fortune, might have shared the fate
of so many of Australia’s sons, who now fill lonely
graves in far distant parts of the earth, that she
and' you, and I, my readers, might live here in
security and freedom ? Are there any who have
not lost a relative, or a dear friend, in this sanguin-
ary struggle for the world’s freedom ? And, alas !
there remain those mothers who have been called
upon to make the greatest of all sacrifices for their
country.
To all these women—the mothers, the daughters,
the sisters, and the friends of our heroic dead—
I make an earnest appeal to come to the help of
the comrades of those who will never return, but
who have found “ a niche in the Temple of the
Immortals.”
Let the rich woman and the poor woman work
side by side in this cause, which appeals to the
hearts of both.
It is not so much a question of obtaining money
that I have in mind —that will largely be found by
taxation —but to insure its economical expenditure,
and above all to see that the returned soldier is
not neglected ; to make it their business to see
that he gets a fair deal in his efforts to re-establish
himself in civil life.


In the “ Homes ” that will be created for the
veterans who are totally incapacitated, women will
find a most worthy object for the exercise of their
kindheartedness.
To the convalescent hospitals they can also
bring their sympathetic help.
To the widows and orphans of those who have
paid the great price of their lives, they can give a
helping hand—not in the way of charity, but in
that of heartfelt obligation.
The childless woman can adopt an orphan ; the
rich woman can plan out a career for the orphan
boy or girl.
Once the women of Australia have taken this
duty of Repatriation up, there are countless ways
in which their heartstrings will be touched for
many a year to come.
An Appeal to the Red Cross Society.
For a long time after the war broke out, the
members of this noble society were severely taxed
to deal with the unprecedented claim that was
made upon their services.
The splendid results that have been achieved
bear eloquent testimony to the efficiency of its
organization and the liberality of our people.
The purposes for which this society works are
clearly defined, and are of world-wide sanction,
and in time of war especially it is important that
the funds raised and the labour expended should
be confined within the prescribed limits which
long experience has found to be necessary. _


Is there any prospect that, after the war, this
fine organization which now exists, with a great
many active members, all well trained and highly
efficient, may be used in some way in connexion
with the Repatriation of the returned soldiers ?
The magnitude of the aftermath of this greatest
of all wars will far transcend anything that has
ever been experienced before, and while it may
have been wise to confine the operations of the
Red Cross Society within certain limits in previous
wars, should not the very greatness of the task of
Repatriation be the excuse for utilizing the services
of so highly trained a body of patriotic men and
women, if not as actual Red Cross workers, then
in an affiliated association under its segis and
composed of the same members ?
Already a start has been made in the creation
of an affiliated society, or an offshoot of a local
branch of the Red Cross, viz., at Brighton where
the “Read aptation Society for Maimed and W ounded
Soldiers” has been established for the purpose of
training a number of returned soldiers vocation-
ally, the new association paying part of the cost
and the State War Council the rest.
An Appeal to the Education Departments to
Help the Veterans.
In Victoria we have seen how the power of
well-directed organization to inspire enthusiasm
has resulted in the State school children’s magnifi-
cent contributions towards patriotic objects,
aggregating over £150,000.
The Director of Education, his head-quarters
staff, and his large staff of teachers have seized
this great crisis in our history to inspire the


children of the State with an ardent patriotism,
which will bear fruit throughout their whole lives.
The great organization which Mr. Tate has
created for patriotic purposes exists to-day an
elaborate machine, with its influence in every
city, town, and village, and in the remotest corners
of the State, and in every household therein.
Money for further contributions will, no doubt,
become scarce, and Mr. Tate’s organization may
languish for “ a want of pence.”
May I venture to suggest that no better use
could be made of this powerful machinery for
educating our children in unselfish devotion to
an ideal than to direct its influence to the service
of the returned veteran.
Let our children take a prominent part in rousing
us all to a proper sense of our individual obliga-
tion to the gallant men who have returned to us
with so many honorable claims upon our gratitude.
The same organization, which has done such
splendid work, can be kept alive to help the
proposed “ Soldiers’ Aid and Employment Com-
mittees ” when formed, in various ways. Indeed,
there is no reason why these committees, which are
slow of creation, should not owe their birth in
small places to the activities of the Education
Department.
The returned local men should be objects of
pride and admiration to the local schools and the
welfare of the men their “ hearts’ desire.”
Wherever there are “ Homes ” established for
the disabled veterans where they may spend their
days in peace and comfort, their lives can be
brightened by the solicitude of the local schools.


The wounded men struggling to make a living
should receive the homage of the schools, and the
men should feel that they had a friend in every
scholar.
There are many ways in which Mr. Tate and his
staff can use this national “ labour of love,” to the
benefit of our brave veterans, and the lasting moral
training of our children.
What can be done in Victoria by the Education
Department can be done in all the other States.
Afforestation as a Means of Employing
Thousands of the Returned Soldiers at
the Close of the War or before.
I cannot too strongly urge the importance of
the afforestation question to the future of Aus-
tralia, not only in the conservation of indigenous
timbers, but in the growth of the soft woods
of the Northern Hemisphere in suitable localities.
Mining and the wholesale destruction of timber
in land clearing brought about an alarming con-
dition of affairs in the United States, which the
Federal Government has faced in an energetic
way of late years. We in Australia should take
up a similar campaign, for we have suffered from
the same causes. We have experts who are con-
stantly pointing out our duty in this regard,
but their voices are “ the voices of those crying
in the wilderness.” Here we have a great source
of remunerative employment for thousands of our
returned soldiers waiting to he tapped.
Commencing about next May, we are going to
have increasing difficulty in finding work for the


returned soldiers fit for it, a difficulty that will
face us with increasing intensity before the war is
over.
A large number of men could be put on this
winter to make a start in connection with
afforestation, and thus prevent the liability of
having to start relief work in a less promising
way.
I have been astonished for years at the general
apathy shown in regard to afforestation, the
importance of which in Europe and America is
so generally recognised.
In Australia some people seem to think that
it is a matter of little moment, because they
think the indigenous trees will reproduce them-
selves, and that the country is not suitable for
the growth of the soft woods, of which we import
such enormous quantities.
Personally I have no knowledge of tree culture,
but as a railway manager for many years I know
what splendid timbers our forests have produced
for many railway uses, and I have made repre-
sentations in deprecation of the want of care to
insure sufficient reproduction of certain valuable
timbers which are rapidly being exhausted.
If there is one thing more than another in which
we have displayed ignorance and neglect it is in
not taking up the question of afforestation as a
live one 30 or 40 years ago. We have now in
the various States made a small beginning, and we
have enthusiastic conservators of forests who are
fully alive to the vast importance of this matter
to the future of Australia.


If any of our statesmen wish to know how
important this question is in one direction only,
that of the State railways, they have but to call
on their State railway manager, and he will soon
convince them that if steps are not taken to plant
and conserve our own timbers the time is not
distant when imported soft woods will have to
replace our own hard woods.
Let me give a few facts, obtained from the best
authority, in the hope that it.may be realized
how great a part afforestation might be made to
play in the Repatriation of the soldiers, large
numbers of whom might be profitably employed
in each State in giving effect to local afforestation
schemes which have been recommended from time
to time without receiving anything but a cold
welcome.
We have the land, the climate, and the organizing
and directing knowledge and capacity, all ready to
give an impetus to any movement in this direction,
of sufficient magnitude to greatly ease the situation
in connexion with the large influx of returned
soldiers after the war, and all we lack to enable
us to enlarge the volume of any such enterprise to
large dimensions, so far as soft woods are con-
cerned, is seed, and this can be obtained from
America by cabling for it.
Now for the facts which I owe to our Conservator
of Forests (Mr. Mackay).
The consumption of pine and fir by civilized
nations is over 90 per cent, as compared with
10 per cent, of hard wood, and of soft wood
trees Australia, apart from very limited areas of
hoop-pine in Eastern Queensland and Northern
New South Wales, has scarcely any indigenous


soft woods of value now left. It will thus be seen
where the most pressing work in connexion with
new afforestation mainly lies.
The price of all kinds of timber is steadily
rising, but the great need in Europe after the war
will be for pine and spruce, and this foreshadows
much higher prices here, with increased consump-
tion of our hard wood timbers.
Taking a period of five years prior to July, 1914,
when a drought period began and the great
war commenced, the annual imports of timber
into Australia exceeded five hundred million
(500,000,000) superficial feet, with a value of
£3,200,000. The bulk of these imports consisted
of pine and spruce, and, at least, three-fourths of
this immense bulk could have been grown in the
temperate regions of South-eastern Australia under
the fostering care of a national forest policy.
Careful and conservative estimates show, after
examination of soil and land by men whose work
it is to accurately forecast tree-growth and timber
yields, that along the coasts of New South Wales,
Victoria, South Australia, and Tasmania there are
nearly two million (2,000,000) acres of waste Crown
lands, now unproductive, awaiting the hand of
the forester and tree planter.
In Victoria alone there are over three hundred
thousand (300,000) acres of such land, stretching
from the mouth of the Glenelg River, near the
South Australian border, and extending eastward
through the Portland, Port Campbell, Otway,
South Gippsland, and East Gippsland districts.
These lands, lying behind the sea-dunes,
consist of long and wide tracts of gently undulating
country, the surface composed of pure sand or


sandy loam, and covered with rough vegetation,
such as heaths, and at intervals ragged belts of
low scrubby timber. Much of it, however, is
treeless, and the first cost of preparing the ground
would be light, being confined to fencing and
burning off the heath.
In their present state, these lands are unfit to
carry sheep or cattle, except for very short periods,
but poor as they are the soil contains all the plant
food necessary to the successful growth of pine,
and it must be remembered that even the expe-
rience of thirty years in Victorian plantations shows
that belts of pine, by the continuous dropping of
their needles, quickly form a deep mulch on the
surface which, gradually becoming humus, enriches
and strengthens the poorest soil.
These coastal lands have also the advantage
of an ample rainfall (30 to 45 inches annually)
and the coolness of climate which is essential to
the growing of conifers. Further, owing to the
mildness of our winters, there is but a short period
of rest in tree growth here, and it thus happens
that pines and firs, which are native to Europe
and North America, mature and yield useful
timber in our climate in three-fourths of the period
necessary for harvesting the timber crop in their
original home. •
There are very few of the hardier pines now
acclimatized and grown here in plantations which
will not yield thinnings in 20 years, and the final
crop in 35 to 40 years, whereas the rotation or
harvesting period in Europe for such species is
usually fixed at 60 to 70 years.
The cost of planting these heath lands, including
enclosure, preparation of surface, raising of tree


plants, and planting, is set down, after full expe-
rience, at about £5 an acre, including all charges
of up-keep and maintenance, and allowing interest
(compound) at 5 per cent, per annum, the total
cost throughout the growing period is assessed
at £l7 to £2O per acre.
Thinnings are obtained from the sixteenth year
onwards, and the final crop is harvested from the
twenty-fifth to the thirtieth year, according to
the stem girth and size of the trees.
The actual net yields obtained in Victoria from
medium-class pine ranged from £lOO to £l2O an acre.
As to the laying down of plantations in our
climate, all the work connected with them is
pleasant and healthful, and should be especially
attractive to the returned soldiers, who have
become inured to an out of door life.
Taking the State of Victoria as an example, the
utilization of the poor coastal lands described
would easily give employment to 2,000 men
all the year round (for a large acreage must be
prepared each year in advance), whilst an addi-
tional 1,000 men would be required during the three
months of the planting season, and at least the
same number of men could be employed usefully
throughout the year in the improvement of the
young natural forests.
Such a force of men, under ordinary business
management, and working under skilled guidance,
would quickly transform the barren wastes here
described, planting them with useful trees at the
rate of 20,000 acres yearly, and repeating here
in a smaller way what the genius of the great
Napoleon did to the enormous barrens of the
Gironde region in Western France, now one of
the most productive regions of that rich country.

Land Settlement.
I do not wish to trespass in any way on the
domain of the capable men now intrusted with the
task of settling the returned soldiers on the land
in each State.
At the same time, I should like to direct the
attention of those gentlemen to one or two matters
that are of common interest to both the States
War Councils and the executive intrusted in each
State with the very vital phase of repatriation-
land settlement.
I have included in this pamphlet my “ extracts ”
and remarks upon Land Settlement in Canada,
given in a previous pamphlet, because land
settlement will he to some considerable extent
a matter of Vocational Training, and it will be
more convenient in the future for my readers to
find what they seek under one cover.
Although Agricultural Repatriation has now
become a State matter, there will have to be
some sort of an alliance between the Repatriation
Executive in each State and the Land Settlement
Executive —however slender it may be.
Vocational Training is to some extent common
to both, and whatever scheme is adopted by the
future Repatriation Commission cannot fail to
have features of interest to those engaged in the
settlement on the land, and vice versa, and it
should be of mutual help to proceed on identical
lines where the aims of each coincide, as they must
do in some ways.
This should bring to the problems that both
will have to face a more varied experience.
' In connexion with other points I can see the
importance of having cordial interchange between
the two Executives.


Some Notes dealing with Canadian Land
Settlement in general, and more par-
ticularly in connexion with
the Repatriation of the
Returned Soldiers.
Canada has probably given more attention to the
matter of land settlement, or that phase of it which
consists in the increase of the number of settlers
on the land, than any other part of the British
Dominions. In its study of the land problem,
Canada has had the advantage of a close knowledge
and practical experience of the long continued
efforts of the United States, owing to its proximity,
and, therefore, Canadian efforts to provide land
settlement for her returned soldiers are well worthy
of our close study and imitation. No doubt
Australia has points in connexion with her land
laws that are also of great interest to her sister
Dominion. The Canadian Pacific Railway and
other long distance lines were pushed out into very
sparsely settled country, and, as the lines went
farther west and north-west, they traversed prac-
tically uninhabited lands. The large land grants
in alternate blocks were valueless almost without
the railways, and with the railways constructed
it was vital to the latter to get settlers to till the
soil, and it became absolutely necessary to offer
the most liberal terms and inducements to secure
them, so that the results of their industry might
provide the freight and passenger traffic without


which the lines would have been a dead loss.
A brief resume of the C.P.R. method of land
settlements may be interesting.
Canadian Pacific Railway Colonization Methods.
At the beginning of 1913, the company made a
radical change in the methods by which it had
hitherto sold its land holdings in Western Canada.
This change had a very direct bearing on the
aggressive colonization policy which the company
desired to press forward.
All unsold land was withdrawn entirely from
sale for speculative purposes, and dealings have
since been conducted only with those who gave
assurance of their intention of residing upon and
developing the land they purchase.
In Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba the
“ C.P.R.” declined to sell its land to speculators
under any circumstances. Its object is to settle
producers on the land, so that the railways may
have traffic to handle.
It, therefore, desires to have industrious, suc-
cessful settlers located along its lines. To such men
the terms are liberal. The company’s general
terms of sale provide for a small cash payment by
the settler, the balance to extend over twenty years
with interest at 6 per cent, on the amount re-
maining unpaid. (Note that in Canada the rates
of interest generally throughout all financial
operations are higher than in Australia.) Pur-
chasers of land in the company’s irrigation blocks
in Southern Alberta, for instance, are provided with
a loan if they want it, to the value of 2,000 dollars,
which is expended under the company’s super-
vision, in erecting a house and barn, sinking a
well, and fencing. This loan is also repayable in
twenty years with interest at 6 per cent. In order


to qualify for it the settler must be a married man,
with agricultural experience, must have his own
implements and horses or the means to buy them,
and have sufficient cash to make his first payment
and care for his family during their first year’s
occupation of the land. No security is required
except the land itself and the first payment,
which is made in advance; and the chance of the
company getting back its money depends on the
success of the farmer.
In certain districts the company has for sale
“ ready-made ” farms, that is, farms on which
improvements have been made, in the form of
houses, barns, wells, fencing, cultivating a certain
area and placing it under crop, at the proper season
of the year. These farms are sold on terms ex-
tending over twenty years. To settlers in certain
specified areas who have been one year in occu-
pation of their land, and who have the necessary
food and shelter,, and can satisfy the Superintendent
of Agriculture and Animal Industry that they are
possessed of practical experience in the care and
handling of live stock, and, in some cases, sheep,
an advance not exceeding 1,000 dollars may be
made under easy terms. The company’s Agri-
cultural and Animal Industry Experts are glad
to give the benefit of their practical advice to
settlers, and to assist them in every way to make
a success of their farm undertakings. Although
the prairies are celebrated for their wheat pro-
duction, the company recognises that the. greatest
success comes from mixed farming, which it strongly
recommends.
The company places at certain points pure bred
bulls for service, the only fee being a nominal one,
which goes to remunerate the caretaker.


The company maintains Demonstration Farms
in a number of localities, where free advice is given
to all settlers asking it. At some of its farms the
company has installed creameries, paying the
highest cash prices for cream brought in by farmers,
who retain the skimmed milk.
The company has also established at certain
points egg circles, taking all the eggs brought in
by farmers. In these and other ways it is sought
to advance the settlers’ interests.
In connexion with their irrigation blocks, the
O *
company deals in a thoroughly systematic way with
tree culture, and with shrubs, plants, grasses, &c.
C.P.R. proposals for land settlement of returned
soldiers —
The company is preparing one thousand (1,000)
farms for colonization by returned soldiers, the
buildings and improvements being provided on
these farms prior to settlement, and the farms
thoroughly equipped, the purchaser being given
a long term within which to pay for them.
These farms are being laid out in colony groups,
and each group will be under the supervision of a
qualified agriculturist, who will have general
control of operations.
In addition, the company is providing a system
of assisted settlement for returned soldiers, under
which certain advances will be made to the soldiers
to enable them to provide their own buildings and
improve the farms.
It is estimated that the cost of this special
enterprise on behalf of returned soldiers will
amount to upwards of three million five hundred
thousand dollars.

That in recognition of their services to the
Empire —
(1) A land grant be made to those soldiers in ac-
cordance with the following regulations :
(2) That an Independent Board of Commissioners
be appointed to select suitable land for settlement;
to direct the preliminary land clearing or equivalent
improvements ; to approve of the purchase of all
stock, implements, &c.; and to administer all funds
in connexion with the Co-operative Settlements.
(3) That the land grant take the form of farms of
such acreage as may, in the opinion of the said Board
of Commissioners, be best adapted to the different
classes of farming to be pursued thereon, in accord-
ance with the location and adaptability of the land.
In the districts best suited to the purposes of mixed
farming and dairy farming, the acreage will neces-
sarily be larger than where it is the intention of the
beneficiary to follow poultry raising, market
gardening, or fruit-growing.
(4) The farms to be located in such districts as
may be determined upon by the Board of


Commissioners, and that such provision be made
by the Government as may enable the said Board
of Commissioners to acquire such lands, and to
carry out the co-operative land settlement, and
that these lands be in blocks of such size as to
provide for at least sixty allotments.
(5) The farms to be subdivisions of selected areas
of suitable size, in the respective districts, such areas
to be Government lands, if available, or to be
acquired by the Government for the purpose, and
to be within easy access of transportation and
markets.
(6) Each of the foregoing areas to constitute a
co-operative settlement, for which purpose it shall
be laid out or disposed of as follows
acreage to be reserved for a demonstration farm,
central organization plant, roads, recreation
grounds, &c., the balance of the acreage to be
subdivided into farms of such size as may be
decided upon by the said Board of Commissioners,
with regard to the location and the class of farming
to be followed thereoti.
(7) The central organization plant and demon-
stration farm are to be centrally located, in order
that they will be within the shortest possible
distance from the farms on the boundaries of the
areas.
8. It being a prime necessity that all the farms
shall have easy access to the central organization
plant, roads shall be constructed both along all
section lines, and also connecting each farm with
the main or trunk roads.
(9) The demonstration farm eventually to be
provided with equipment necessary for the proper
working and developing thereof, and with live
stock in accordance with its requirements.


(10) To make complete the organization of the
settlement, it will be necessary that there be provided
those features essential to the successful working
out of a co-operative system, to be availed of by the
soldiers occupying the settlement farms. These will
constitute the central organization plant, and will be
located centrally, in accordance with paragraph 7,
and will comprise :
(a) General store,
( b) Creamery,
(c) Blacksmith’s shop,
(. d ) Carpenter’s shop,
(e) Public hall,
(/) School,
(g) A residence designed to provide temporary
accommodation for soldiers going to look
over land, &c.

hotel, and should be suitable for the accommo-
dation of the soldiers’ wives as well.
(11) Those eligible to become possessors of farm
lands under this recommendation are :
(a) All returned soldiers irrespective of the
point of enlistment, and without dis-
tinction as to military rank or length of
service.
( b ) The son of a deceased or permanently dis-
abled soldier, providing he is at least 18

until such time as he attains the age of
eighteen.


(c) The widow of a deceased soldier.
( d) The wife of a permanently disabled soldier.
(e) The daughter of a deceased soldier if there
is no son in the family.
Provided always that only one allotment shall be
available by a soldier or any member of his family,
and that such allotment will only be made where
it is the intention of the beneficiary to make bond
fide settlement thereon. It is not intended that
these allotments shall be made available for purely
speculative purposes.
(12) That on each farm allotment there be certain
improvements made at the expense of the provincial
Government, said improvements to be confined to
land clearing, and to the draining and fencing of
the cleared land.
(13) That in no case shall the cost of these initial
improvements exceed the sum of 500 dollars per
allotment.
(14) That further assistance be given in the way
of a long term loan, at a low rate of interest, for the
purpose of erecting farm buildings, for the purpose
of machinery, stock, seed, fodder, household neces-
sities, &c., or for further improvements in clearing,
draining, or fencing.
(15) That all such stock and equipment be
purchased only on approval of the said Board of
Commissioners and remain the property of the
Government.
(16) That a lien, or mortgage, to the full amount
of such loan, with interest as agreed upon, be
established against the farm, including all chattels
and improvements.


(17) That 1,350 dollars be the maximum amount
loaned by the Government against any allotment.

supplies, which will be charged against the allot-
ment holder on the books of the central organiza-
tion to be provided by the Board of Commissioners.
All such supplies, whether buildings, live stock,
implements, or improvements to the land will be
provided by the central organization, although
the allotment holder has, of course, the option of
specifying his requirements.
(18) That no titles be issued for at least three
years from date of entry.
(19) That at the expiration of such period, pro-
vided that improvements to an extent to be decided
upon by the Board of Commissioners have been
made to the approval of the said Board, patents be
issued, any unpaid part of a loan to be a first
mortgage against the property.
(20) That the taxes on any allotment for the year
in which such allotment is taken up by a returned
soldier be remitted.
(21) That arrangements be made whereby a
limited number of returned soldiers receive assist-
ance in establishing at the centre of the settlement
such industries and occupations as, in the opinion
of the Board of Commissioners, directly contribute
to the needs of the settlers.
(22) That full opportunities to obtain training
and instruction in agricultural matters be placed
at the disposal of the returned soldiers who may
wish to avail themselves of the opportunity to
acquire land.
(23) That such training and instruction be given
under the direction of the College of Agriculture of
the provincial University.


(24) That a short course of three months’ dura-
tion be offered in general agriculture, and that the
course be repeated as often as is deemed advisable.
(25) That in this course laboratory work con-
stitute the maj or part of class room instruction, and
that practical work in the fields, orchards, and
stables receive special attention.
(26) That tuition be provided by the provincial
Government free of cost for all returned soldiers
who are desirous of taking a three months’ course
with a view to acquiring a holding in the co-
operative settlement; their board and lodging,
while taking such course, to be provided by the
Dominion Government.
(27) That adequate facilities be provided in the
way of instructors, class rooms, dormitories, labora-

(29) That a trained agricultural adviser be ap-
pointed for each settlement, and that he undertake
field demonstrations in co-operation with the
farmers, and generally assist them in the conduct-
ing of their work in accordance with best farm
practice.


(30) That, with a view to assisting those returned
soldiers who had taken up pre-emptions before
going to the front they may, if they desire, receive
assistance in the form of land improvements to
the value of 500 dollars, such improvements to be
made by, and, to be subject to, the approval of the
said Board of Commissioners.
(31) That the nature and the extent of the
improvements required to be made on any allot-
ment, before title to the same shall be granted, be
decided upon by the said Board of Commissioners,

limits, provided that the total improvements are
not required to be done in less than three years’
or more than five years’ time. Failure on the part
of the allotment holder to comply with the'Regu-
lations regarding improvements to constitute
grounds for the cancellation of such allotment.
Personal Remarks.
I have been an interested spectator of our
agricultural development in Victoria for very many
years, and could say a great deal about the tardy
progress made for a long time ; the disinclination
of the ill-trained ‘‘ selectors ” to adopt improved
methods of tillage ; and the failure of the Govern-
ments of the time to properly supervise and direct
the labours of the settlers, who, in the main, how-
ever, succeeded after great hardships. They made
good in spite of every handicap, and if they could
do that, how much more successful should the
young returned soldier be with his opportunities
of training in our Agricultural Colleges and the
more capable and efficient advice and assistance
now given by our experts.


There are certain drawbacks in farming that
weigh with young men, such as the monotony of
the life and its isolation. Our farms are large in
acreage, and the amenities of life that are offered
by the Canadian Pacific Railways projected
“ Colony Farming Scheme and the recommended
“ Community ” Farming Scheme of British Colum-
bia are limited in Australia. lam strongly in
favour of mixed farming, and that each soldier
should have enough acreage to carry on that system.
I am much pleased with the thoroughly practical
recommendations of Canada, which will go far to
popularize farming as a calling among the young
returned soldiers.
These schemes carry the cultivation of the soil
to an' economically higher plane than the usual
practice of numerous isolated farms scattered over
the country side, with each individual farmer fol-
lowing his own bent, with little association for
either mutual benefit or social intercourse. I
earnestly hope that in every State in Australia
similar schemes will be adopted of settling our
soldiers on the land.
I would draw attention to the scheme submitted
by Mr. Hawkins, of “ community ” poultry farms
and apple-growing combined in such a suitable
locality as the Mornington Peninsula.
Such a settlement, with each soldier provided with
a cottage and the necessary fowl runs, fowl houses,
and enclosures wire-netted, and with sufficient
acreage for fruit-growing, and a little pasture,
ought to prove highly successful. With a com-
petent man centrally situated to teach the men,
to superintend their work and advise them, collect
the eggs, fowls, ducks, and pigs, and later on


the apples, and despatch them by rail to the
markets, the whole of the settlers’ time could be
devoted to their productive work.
Similar “ community ” settlements should be
established elsewhere, and in all the States, in a
more or less modified way in the matter of fruit-
growing, and so far as poultry farming is con-
cerned, at any rate, solve the prime necessity of
training the men, without the loss of the remunera-
tion or return for their labour that would be
entailed by a six months’ training at one of the
large poultry farms that should otherwise be
necessary. This is a new way to “ kill two birds
with the one stone.”
There are many capable patriotic farmers who
could give a practical training to suitable men in
agriculture and its kindred affiliations, in a way
that should ease the strain on the Government
establishments, and by means that could secure
Vocational Training somewhat similar to those
suggested in connexion with industrial avocations,
viz. :
The farmers to receive .the pupils should of
course be competent men, in the opinion of our
Experts, so as to insure efficient practical training,
the farmers to have the labour of the trainees as
“ working pupils,” and pay them a part of the
“ sustenance ” allowance determined upon, with
board and lodging, and the State to pay the rest
of the “ sustenance ” allowance.
This scheme should enable many men to be
trained and find employment at the same time,
and help the farmer to obtain labour.
