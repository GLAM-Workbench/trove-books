'there are many persons desirous of bringing out their families, who cannot spare at any
one time a sum sufficient for the purpose, or who are deterred from sending home their money
because they cannot ensure its application to the desired purpose.
The principal object of this society is to enable the Australian colonists to bring out at
first cost, payable by easy weekly or monthly instalments, their friends and families from Europe and
America, with superior accommodation and comfort, protected during their passage, and on their arrival
from incivility and extortion.
t his Society, from the extent of its transactions and enlarged credit, being able to charter
its own ships, will secure objects unattainable by private individuals. And as the owners of the
ships chartered will be paid in part in England and the .remainder on the arrival of the vessels
at their destination, the Society can exercise a powerful influence over the comfort and treatment
of their passengers.
The Society will apply the co-operative principle as follows:
'1 here will be two classes of Passenger Tickets issued to the Shareholders—a First-class
and Second-class, the members paying for the same by easy weekly or monthly instalments.
Any member who can secure to the Society the payment of his instalment, or who shall have
paid up three-fourths of the entire amount, shall receive his ticket entitling the person named therein
(or if on blank, entitling any holder thereof), to a passage to the port in the ticket named, and
to be landed with his luggage free of expense. These tickets will be transmitted to England,
in duplicate —one copy to the Society’s Manager, and the other to the intended passenger, and
will entitle the holder to a passage in the priority of the issue of his ticket; the holder having
the power to postpone his departure upon certain terras. The Manager in England, on receipt
of tickets, shall at once communicate with the passengers, so as to give them timely notice,
and shall also furnish printed directions for their assistance in obtaining outfit and such other
matters as they shall require. When the passengers are ready for embarkation, the Society
will charter a vessel of the first class, having superior accommodation and ventilation, and
will bind the owners and captain by strict contract and in heavy penalties to practice civility
and gentlemanly demeanor to their passengers. And it shall be the especial care of the Society
to prosecute lor any breach of the Passengers Act, or other improper conduct on the part of the
officers of their ships.
lire Society shall be managed by a directory of the highest respectability here and
in England. The public shall be protected by the enrolment of the Society as a Friendly
Society in both places, and the proper application of the funds shall be amply provided for by
the Rules, which can be had on application to Adolphus A. F. Haller, at the Offices of
the Australian Freehold Association, New Buildings, Mechanics’ Institution, opposite the Argus
Office, vvhere every information will be given and members enroled daily.
Agents will be appointed throughout the principal Cities of Australia and abroad.
