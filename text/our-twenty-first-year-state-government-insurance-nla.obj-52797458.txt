A QUEENSLAND PASTORAL SCENE.
ROBABLY these words would never have
been written, and certainly not in 1937, as a
record of twenty-one years, but for the
'.conception of “ The Workers’ Compensation
Act of 1916,” and “ The Insurance Act of
The first was Labour’s expression of
“ Increased compensation for workers for accidents
: and industrial diseases
and the second,
“ State Insurance, covering every class of insurance
business,”
Their general acceptance by Queenslanders has justified
their conception.
State , Insurance was definitely and successfully
launched in ig 16, and to Insurance Commissioner, John
Goodwyn, A.1.A., who showed how the “ change-over ”
could be successfully made, and who successfully made it,
grateful acknowledgment must be recorded.


The Late JOHN GOODWYN, A.I.A.,
First Insurance Commissioner.


We—every past and present member of the Office
Staff—modestly believe that in. the trust reposed in us. on
ist July,'l9l6, by the Government and the people oft
Queensland, we have not failed.
We believe that all Queenslanders, for twenty-one
years, have held high the name of the Office, the principles
for which it was established, and the service it. has rendered,
and by that good name, those, high principles, and that
unselfish service, have created by Ist July, iQ37 r an Insur-
ance Office, pre-eminent in the State, and giving State-wide
service.
. “Insurance” is a blessed word, and is well defined in
dictionaries, but we think that the best conception of
it is “the contributions of the many for the misfortunes
of the few,” so indicative of help, financial and otherwise, in
times of misfortune.
/ Those responsible for the administration of this bless-
ing must see that those contributions are equitably correct
and as light as possible to the “ many,” and the benefits
equitably correct and as compensating as possible to the
“few.”
This view has always been taken by the Office, with
excellent results for the insuring public, and those who
benefit under its policies.


JOHN A. WATSON Esq., F.I.C.A., F.A.I.I.,
Insurance Commissioner.


J. A. O’CONNOR Esq.,
Deputy Commissioner,


ITH the passing of “ The Workers’ Com-;
TVAWSP e nsation Act of 1916,” the State Accident
Insurance Office was established’ for the
P ur P ose of carrying the liability of Workers’
Com P ensation business of employers in
Q ueens i an d. The Act was assented to on
sth January, 1916.
Office space was taken in Parbury House, Eagle
Street, Brisbane, on Ist April, 1916, where operations com-
menced, although a small staff under the control of the
first Commissioner, Mr, John Goodwyn, A.1.A., handled
a good deal of preparatory work as from 14th February
of the same year.
“ The Workers’ Compensation Act of 1916 ” came into
operation as from Ist July, 1916, on and after which date
employers of labour were obliged to take out policies cover-
ing their workers with the State Accident Insurance Office.
Previously policies were issued by various insurance offices
to cover the liability laid down in “The Workers’ Com-
pensation Act of 1905 ” (which was repealed by the new
Act of 1916), but insurance was then not compulsory.
On Ist February, 1917, “The Insurance Act of 1916”
came into force, authorising the Office to transact all
classes of insurance business. The title was changed from
State Accident Insurance Office to the State Government
Insurance Office, and the Office actively commenced the
transaction of other classes of insurance business. In the
subsequent,pages the history of these various departments
is treated separately.
, The first Commissioner was Mr. John Goodwyn, A.1.A.,
who had as his Deputy Commissioner, Mr. John A. Watson,
F.1.C.A., F.A.1.1. Mr. John A* O’Connor was Secretary.
The business expanded rapidly from the commencement, and
the original staff of ten officers had to be augmented from
time to time.


LOUIS J. GREALY Esq.,
Secretary and Chief Statistical Officer.


On the resignation as from 31st October, 1920, of
Mr. Goodwyn, Mr. John A, Watson was appointed Insur-
ance Commissioner, Mr. J, A. O’Connor, Deputy Commis-
.sioner, and Mr. L. J. Grealy, Secretary and Chief Statistical
Officer.
The following years witnessed further progress and
rapid growth, until in January, 1922, a new Head Office
was ready to accommodate the staff. As an indication of
the growth of the Office, we mention that the staff at Head
Office and ten Branch Offices at 30th June, 1922, numbered
460 salaried Officers, with Local Agents in various country
centres numbering in the vicinity of 700, as against a staff
of 138 Officers employed at Head Office and five Branch
Offices and 169 Local Agents as at 30th June, 1917.
In 1930 it was found necessary to move the Head-
quarters of the Office again, and pending the completion
of a new building, the Head Office staff was housed in the
C.C.M. building at the corner of Adelaide and Creek
Streets.
By July, 1933, the new and permanent home of the
State Government Insurance Office was ready for occupa-
tion by the Head Office staff. This magnificent building,
seven stories high, was named “ Insurance House,” and is
a testimony to the progressiveness of the Office and its
rapid development.
In order to give the reader an adequate conception of
the service rendered to the insuring public and workers of
Queensland by the Office in its twenty-one years, we shall
give a summarised account of the various departments and
their work and progress under the following headings:—
Workers’ Compensation.
Fire.
Life.
Miscellaneous Accident.

WORKERS' COMPENSATION
HE position regarding Workers’ Compensa-
tion in Queensland is that the Government
and t^ie Office have been able to take the
credit for having:—
( J ) More than doubled the benefits to
injured workers; the maximum weekly allow-
ance to disabled workers has been raised
from £i per week under the previous Act to £2 15s. per
week, with a special provision that married workers shall
receive up to the basic wage per week, according to the
number of children under 16 years of age dependent on the
earnings of such worker; increased from £4OO to £750 the
maximum amount payable in respect of total incapacity
and/or death.
(2) Provided a definite basis of compensation, two-
thirds of earnings, with conjugal qualifications where an
adult worker at the time of the injury works under an
award or industrial agreement, irrespective of his earnings
during the previous twelve months or shorter employment.
(3) Settled approximately 260,300 claims, and paid
approximately £6,000,000 in cash to injured workers or
their dependants.
(4) Brought sufferers from Miners’ Phthisis and
other specified industrial diseases, including Pulmonary
Tuberculosis, where traceable to work in mines, etc., within
the scope of the Act; in November, 1928, increasing the
amount payable from £4OO to £5OO, and in December,
1935, increasing this from £450 to £550 in case of total
disablement or death.
(5) Brought within the Act all workers in receipt of
earnings not exceeding £520 per year. The operation of
the 1905 Act was restricted to manual workers only, but
now no such limitation exists. Casual workers and domestic
servants have also been provided for, as they were excluded
under the previous Act.


(6) Provided under the Acts for percentage or per-
manent loss of limb or joints.
(7) Established a Medical Board at Mount Isa to
minimise lead poisoning and its harmful effects on the
workers in silver and lead mines.
(8) Given general satisfaction to employers and to
workers and their organisations who have all been relieved
of a considerable amount of the work of claim settlement
which devolved upon them under the old system of private
insurances.
The value of the type of Workers’ Compensation legis-
lation of 1916 and its amendments is best exemplified in
its compensatory provisions by—
The loss of the Steamer “ Llewellyn ” in July, 1919,
which brought about 13 claims;
The Mount Mulligan Coal Mine disaster in
September, 1921, when 75 miners lost their lives,
and their dependants were compensated;
The loss of the Steamer “ Douglas Mawson ” in
March, 1923, which resulted in 13 claims; and
The loss of the Steamer “ Dorrigo ” in April, 1926,
with 22 claims.
A passing reference might be made to the public
protection granted, by an Order in Council issued in
February, 1919, when Industrial Diseases provisions were
extended to include pneumonic influenza of workers in or
about hospitals, ambulance brigades, quarantine stations,
vessels coming to Queensland from any infected port
beyond Queensland; for compensatory provisions in con-
nection with Weil’s Disease particularly to workers in
cane, and quite recently to sewerage workers; and an Order
in Council providing for the allowance of discounts for
approved ambulance services maintained by employers.
The system of merit rating of Workers’ Compensation
risks was inaugurated in 1924 and carefully applied since
that date.

HIS Department was commenced on ist
February, 1917, at rates approximately 11
cent - below those previously charged.
I wttjfij On Ist Ma y> i 9 i B, the Office granted a
further reduction in Fire rates of 25 per
cent, on Dwellings, which later applied to
Churches, Colleges and the like, and 10 per
cent, on other fire risks. The net result has been that
dwellings, churches, schools, and like rates, have been
lowered by 33J per cent., and other rates by 20 per cent.
As from ist October, 1925, the Office declared a
10 per cent, bonus on the majority of risks. The estimated
saving then to the insuring public, owing to this distribu-
tion of profits alone, from ist October, 1925, to ist October,
1937, totals £1,002,200.
From the foregoing, it will be seen that since the State
Government Insurance Office commenced operations in
February, 1917, to date, the people of Queensland have
benefited to the extent of more than £6,497,000, made
up as follows: —


POLICY DEPARTMENT— FIRST FLOOR.


Saving owing to reduction of
premium rates .. .. £5,495,000
Saving owing to distribution of
profits and of bonus of 10
per cent., commenced on Ist
October, 1925 . . £1,002,200
Since Ist November, 1935, a wider coverage has been
extended to State Insurance fire policy-holders in that their
personal belongings are held covered while in transit, or
at the seaside, in laundries, &c. Previously, these were
only covered while in the dwelling or residence named
in the policy.
The abolition of the Explosion Risk charge on risks
contained in premises not considered extra hazardous by
fire or explosion has been an added financial benefit to
policy-holders throughout the State.
The Fire Department has continued to progress in
an extremely satisfactory manner, which shows the measure
of support given to the State Government Insurance Office
by the public.
Premium rates have been carefully amended and
revised from time to time, and, where possible, reduced;
towns, whose construction was improved, and fire hazards
reduced by water supplies, have received lesser rates, and,
consistently since 1925, profits have been distributed to fire
policy-holders.


HE Life Department was opened on ist
January, 1918, and has been phenomenally
successful.
The success of this Department may be
ntPlv' •'«bI1 S au S e d by the fact that, following on the
Actuary’s valuation of the liabilities under
the contracts in force at 31st December, 1922
(four years after the commencement of business), the
Office declared a reversionary Bonus of £1 10s. per £lOO
insured per annum on “ Whole Life ” participating policies,
and £1 per £lOO insured on Endowment Insurance and
Endowment policies.
No Australian Life Office, except one, has declared a
bonus so early in its existence, and few, if any, have
declared a bonus on the first three years’ working in any
way approaching that distributed by the State Government
Insurance Office.
Bonuses have been declared annually since 1922, and
have steadily increased. At the present time the Office
is paying bonuses on participating policies at the following
rates: —


per £lOO assured.
£ s. d.
Whole Life Policies .. 280
Endowment Assurances and
Pure Endowments—
Term 35 years and over .. 2 0 0
Term 20 years and under
35 years .. .. 1120
Term under 20 years ..140
An excellent example of the bonus additions attaching
to a State Insurance policy is given hereunder.
Policy No. 501764 was taken out as from Ist August,
1918, for £l,OOO plus bonuses, payable at age sixty or
previous death. The applicant’s age at entry was twenty-
nine years next birthday.
On 23rd March, 1937, the insured died, and the value of
the policy at the date of his death was £1,307 35., repre-
senting total bonus additions of £307 3s.
The number of policies in force as at 31st December,
1936, totals 46,552, with sums assured amounting to
£10,206,706.
Claims paid by death and maturity have amounted to
£855,502, and show what a force the Office is in Life
Insurance in Queensland.
The fact that Life Insurance Funds now total
£3,555,686 tells a story of public confidence, and public
security, which need not be elaborated.

HE Miscellaneous Department, which
embraces Plate Glass, Personal Accident,
Comprehensive Motor Car, Public Risk,
S Fidelity Guarantee, Ordinary Guarantee,
Burglary, and Ledger Guarantee insurances,
was opened for the transaction of business
on ist February, 1917, at rates 10 per cent,
lower than those operating prior to the establishment of
the Office by “ The Insurance Act of 1916.”
The relative importance of the different classes of
insurance is shown by the following annual premium

From the first year of operations this Department
functioned profitably and each year has grown steadily,
until in the year ended 30th June, 1936, its reserves were
£119,646.
As from ist November, 1933, a profit distribution of
20 per cent, was paid to all Motor Car policy-holders on
policies renewed during the twelve months, and has been
continued to date.
Motor Vehicle Insurance is one of intense interest to
a large body of the public, and the following new and
renewal premium examples—
can bear comparison, in the Queensland public’s favour,
when rates in other States are considered.
Rates of premium and claims experience on all classes
of Miscellaneous business have been carefully watched and
revised from time to time in the public interest.
MARINE
HE Marine Department was opened on ist
August, 1919, and has maintained steady
progress. At 30th June, 1936, its reserves
jmfa were £31,229.
This class of business is transacted
imrnmM mainly for valued clients in other Depart .
ments, and their interests are closely watched.


EPILOGUE
n v j ew 0 f the activities in all Departments,
I iptiP ** ma y now be f air ly claimed that the Office
« is generally regarded as a useful and profit-
able national institution with which all
B-j
■SiFjii classes are doing business. The measure of
t h e SU pport it has received from the Queens-
land public clearly indicates its position in
the national and economic life of the State, and the Balance
Sheet adequately demonstrates the sound financial position
at the present moment. Assets exceed £4,750,000.
As a purely Queensland Office, with its profits
remaining in the State and being distributed among its
policy-holders, the Office deserves the support of every
Queenslander, and will continue to give the highest type
of insurance service to the public as it proceeds on its
march of progress. Twenty-one years have passed, and,
during that period, it has emerged from its adolescence
to full vigour with a proud record of achievement, unsur-
passed by any similar institution in the State.
We are not unmindful of valued fellow officers who have
fallen by the wayside in the past short twenty-one years,
and whose useful lives were really lived in that service
which we record. We wish them to be linked with the
past, the present, and the future of that task they loved
so well.
