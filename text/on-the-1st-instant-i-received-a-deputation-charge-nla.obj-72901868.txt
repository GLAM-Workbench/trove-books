Government Office,
Melbourne, 20 th August, 1853.
ON the instant I received a deputation charged with the duty of
presenting me with a Petition on behalf of a large number of licensed
miners engaged on the Mount Alexander, Bendigo, and other Gold Fields.
2. In my verbal reply I expressed my perfect readiness to give every
subject urged upon my notice the fullest consideration, and, as far as
circumstances permitted, took occasion to express my general views and
impressions on the document laid before me, and on the topics which were
started in the course of the conversation which followed.
8. In order to obviate any misapprehension or doubt on the part of
those interested, I would now direct the Colonial Secretary to forward this
more formal reply to the Petition placed in my hands. This is the more
incumbent upon me as a very erroneous impression is likely to be conveyed in
various important particulars, by the publication of what purports to be a
detailed report of the interview and of the conversation which followed the
presentation of the Petition.
4. The first prayer of the Petition urges the reduction of the License
Fee. It may be well here, at once to correct a false impression entertained,
and insisted upon by some, that the License Fee is A tax, and as such, more-
over unjust, as being levied upon a portion of the community which is at
present unrepresented. The term is in no way applicable to it. It is a
charge made upon the individual for the liberty of seeking and appropriating
to his own use that, which according to law, is the property of the public ;
property from which it is but reasonable and just that the community at
large, as well as the individual, should reap some advantage for the common
good ; and this advantage cannot be secured in any other way than by raising,
with the concurrence of the Legislature, a revenue in one shape or other, such
as may enable the Executive Government to meet that great expenditure
which the gold discoveries themselves, their occupation by the individuals
interested, and the results to which they have led, have entailed upon the
public.
The system now in force is, for the time, the law of the land. The
License Fee is levied under an Act of the Legislature, which cannot he
repealed without the consent of that body. The Lieutenant Governor, even
if convinced of the propriety of so doing, has no power to set it aside.
The Act will expire at the close of the present year, before which time it will
be necessary to introduce another measure either for its renewal or alteration.
\ v !


It will he for the Legislature during the approaching Session, to weigh
well what may he the just course to pursue for the good of the whole com-
munity, and to consider the reasons, which time may have brought to light,
for admitting a modification, if any, in the present system, or for the
substitution of any other arrangement equally fair and equitable, calculated
to produce the same means of maintaining those great establishments which
must be kept up at all hazards, for the public good, and in a great measure
for the direct benefit and advantage of the mining population itself.
5. Any reduction of the License Fee itself, would be attended by no
proportionate diminution in the expenditure necessary to ensure to the Miner
the security, and advantages now held out to him: The necessity of the
maintenance of a Staff for the support of the Public interests?the manage-
ment of the respective Gold Fields?the distribution and protection of Claims
and settlement of disputes, is obvious : It will also be requisite to provide
for a large Police force, Gold Escorts, and support of establishments for
the prompt administration of Justice. All this expenditure will be as
imperative after such reduction, as at the present time. The call for the
formation and maintenance of the great lines of communication will be as
urgent as ever. On the line of road between Melbourne and Mount
Alexander alone, there have been made, or are in progress of formation at
this, time, no less than sixty-two miles of road with eighty bridges and
culverts, the formation of this road alone will cost, it is calculated, \above
�700,000, of which �250,000 have already been expended.
The direct expenditure from Ist January, 1858, to end of July, caused
by the Gold Fields, Police, Escorts, Coroners, Medical, Clerical, Judicial,
and other establishments, amounted to above �600,000. I believe no great
amount of this expenditure could be reduced, even if the License Fee were
entirely abolished.
The revenue derived in the same period from Gold Fields and
Escorts, reached only to �474,000.
6. I have said that, until repealed in due course of law, the payment
of the License Fee is the law of the land; and it is the duty of the Executive
Government to tale all proper measures to see that it is paid in accordance
with the regulations.
I express no opinion here, as to the expediency or practicability of
raising the required revenue in any other manner, hut when the proper time
arrives would turn aside from no suggestion which might hold out a prospect
of its being raised, in any form in appearance less burdensome to individuals,
or more easy of collection.
7. The fact alleged, that the mining population, as a body, may not, in
appearance, be represented in the Legislature, is a subject which may justly
demand attention.


It will meet with every consideration on my party for it is very
contrary to the spirit and wish of the Government that any portion of the
community should he debarred the proper means of bringing their interests
and wishes fairly under notice.
The subject, however, is one which it is requisite to approach with
caution, and can only be remedied by an Act of the Legislature .
Up to a comparatively late date, the constitution only recognized the
possession of freehold and leasehold property of a certain class as giving
a claim to direct representation, and the pastoral interest, great and im-
portant as it has undeniably been, until the recent alteration, exercised no
direct right of representation in the Councils of these Colonies.
8. The second proposition made by the Petitioners is, that monthly or
quarterly licenses should be issued at the option of the applicants. To this
suggestion there may be some objection raised, but none, perhaps, of sufficient
weight to render me indisposed to concede it, if it can be carried out under
proper regulations.
I will take the subject into early consideration. It is the obvious
interest of Government that every facility should be given by the Regulations
to the ready issue of licenses, when applied for; and so far as any extension
or alteration of existing arrangements may afford greater convenience, I shall
at once direct such to be made.
9. I apprehend, with regard to the third request, that not much real
hardship would be removed by its being acceded to. It would entail a yet
greater difficulty upon the authorities, in carrying out the regulations, and I
would point out that the regulation of April 5, section eleven, was specially
framed to meet the reasonable objections which were advanced against the
prompt enforcement of the payment of the License Fee, in the case of the neic
arrival, and I had reason to believe that it had generally answered the
purpose.
10. The fourth claim of the Petition, that greater facilities should be
given to the miners and residents on the Gold Fields for the purchase of small
portions of agricultural land, has long been the subject of my most anxious
attention. lam doing every thing that lies in my power to comply with their
tvishes ; so far as I have been advised, that the law would bear me out, I
have sought to secure for the miner all the advantages which he could
reasonably look for. There have been difficulties (I trust these are now
being overcome) chiefly arising from the inability of the Survey Department
to meet all the demands upon it.
11. The fifth, that the fine for not taking out a license should be
reduced to one pound, I must decline to accede to, as it would be a mere
concession to the breaker of the law, which lam bound to support. It must
be left to the discretion of the Magistrates to deal with each case brought
before them according to its merits.


12. The sixth application, that the constabulary should not carry arms
when enforcing the License Fee, I have no difficulty in conceding, as I consider
that under ordinary circumstances it may be both inexpedient and unnecessary
for them to do so. I have always expressed my disapproval of any display of
unnecessary force. It must, however, not be forgotten, that the custom of
sending out the Police armed upon this special duty, as far as it has prevailed,
has arisen from the custom of carrying arms amongst the mining population
itself. I believe the great majority of the licensed occupants of the Gold
Fields are, as they profess, thoroughly loyal, and disposed, when left to the
discretion of their own reason and good sense,'to support the authorities and
discountenance disorder.
I have no reason to believe that any class of the numerous bodies of
foreigners, who have hitherto intermingled freely with the mining population,
are otherwise minded. I have never intimated distrust in them, and have
ahvays evinced a disposition to treat all, as long as they conducted themselves
in accordance with the laws, to which they had made themselves subject, with
perfect impartiality. And here I may state that lam represented in the
published report above alluded to, to have stated that, t( if I found that the
Petition laid before me was signed by Germans and aliens, it would militate
against its force with me ?this does not convey the truth. What I said was
in reply to an insinuation from, one of the deputation, that invidious acts of
the Government agents were calculated to excite discontent among the
foreigners. I expressed my doubt if that were the case, and I observed that
from the first the Government of this Colony had placed the foreigners upon
precisely the same footing as the native born subjects of Her Majesty ; and
that, viewing this undoubted fact, and (in the case of the numerous Germans
particularly), contrasting the perfect personal liberty which all enjoyed
here, with the political restraints of the countries from which they had
emigrated, I should be surprised to find any large number of signatures of
those classes, attached to any document expressing discontent.
18. Adverting to the general statements made in the preamble to the
Petition, not hitherto touched upon, I have to make 9 the following remarks :
On referring to the Chief Gold Commissioner, as to the observations in the
third paragraph, I have ascertained that, while it may be admitted that
instances of extraordinary individual success may not be so frequent, as
in the earlier workings of the Gold Field, there are reasons to be adduced
ivhy this may be the case.
The great energy shewn by the first miners is not now so frequently
exhibited, nor is the same opportunity perhaps afforded; for now, whenever
a spot of extraordinary richness is found, there are at all times numbers ready
at hand to set in and fully occupy the whole ground, so that of late no single
party could hope to open many claims upon it. To bear out the assertion, that
the Gold Fields are failing, and the people proportionately impoverished,


reference is made to the quantity of gold brought down, being less in propor-
tion to the numbers engaged on the Gold Fields than was the case formerly.
But this is not a fair criterion to go by, inasmuch as the number of actual
miners does not bear the same proportion to the population that it did some
months ago. A far larger number being now engaged otherwise than in
mining; a far larger proportion of females and children are now on the
ground:?and it is probable, that full one-third of the whole adult male
population is occupied in other pursuits.
14. With regard to the general allegations made against the Police,
and other authorities on the ground, I can only repeat as I have done on
former occasions, when appealed to, that I have been most anxious, that the
administration of the Law, and the necessary control over the Gold Fields
for the public security, should be carried on without undue severity, or
reasonable cause of complaint.
The injustice of general and sweeping charges is evident, and their
inutility equally so. Causes of complaint in particular cases may arise, but
iii no instance whatever has an appeal been made to me, in a form which
would admit of enquiry, but every attention has been paid to it, and in no
single instance, where misconduct has been proved, has the offence been passed
over.
15. With regard to the broad assertion, that unlicensed Miners have
been chained to trees, and condemned to hard labor on the public roads of the
Colony, I am satisfied by the result of the enquiry I have made, that the
statement will not stand the test of investigation.
If it be shewn, that any unlicensed Miner has been so treated, it will be
found that he has not been in custody solely for unlicensed mining, but on
so7ne more serious charge, and that in the absence of a proper lock-up), 07i the
first occupation of a new field, it has been necessary to secure his person in
the 07ily manner which was at hand.
I am assured, that no such illegal sentence has been passed, still less
carried out, as that of condemning the non-possessors of licenses to hard
labor on the public roads. But in many cases, it is known, that individuals
who have been sentenced to imprisonment, in default of pay 7nent of a fine for
working without a license, have been permitted at their own request, a7id as
an indulgence, to earn the amount of the fines inflicted by laboring on the camp
works ; and for every day so employed, the fullest amount of wages has been
allowed, according to the rates given at the ca7np.
16. The deputation stated to me, that hundreds of i7istances could be
cited, to prove the general assertion of a disposition on the part of the officials
to act despotically, and to exercise cruelty. These I requested might be
formally brought under my notice. This has not beeii done up to the present
date.


But as they have since given publicity to certain of them, with sufficient
clearness to allow them to be identified, I have been enabled at once to enquire
into the fact.
In Simpson?s case I am informed that the defendant was fined under
the Act for the prevention of OBSCENE LANGUAGE, after most aggravating
conduct on his part towards the constabulary, and that he did not attempt to
deny the charge.
The case of the Blacksmith who is represented as rescued from the
Police, has also been enquired into. It is found, that he never was legally in
custody, and it might have been well to mention that the authorities at Bendigo,
had already long before the representations thus made public, dismissed the
Sergeant for exceeding his authority.
When other similar cases come to be enquired into, lam justified in
the belief that in many of them, it will be found that the whole truth has not
been stated; but I would repeat, that in every instance, in which investigation
may be asked, it will be granted, with every disposition to discover the truth.
I believe that it is the wish of the officers entrusted with the government
of the Gold Fields, to act rightly and repress and punish official misconduct
amongst subordinates to the utmost. They can have, it must be recollected,
no interests distinct from the general well-being of the community.
17. I would here take occasion to express my regret at seeing any
attempt made to introduce distinctions, between the mining and other classes
of the colonists. There are few of the latter who, though not actually mining
for gold, are not directly or indirectly connected with or dependent upon the
prosperity of the former. There is a constant interchange of interests, and
even of position, between the several classes ; and far from magnifying one
interest above another as I have been represented to have done, I have never
considered that the interests of any class were such as could not be recon-
ciled with those of others, and as far as my ability and power went have
sought to unite and harmonize all.
18. In conversation with the Deputation I pointed to the measures of
the Government as a proof of its due appreciation of the just claims of the
mining class to attention and protection ; and the members of the Deputation
expressly admitted that such a disposition had been evinced.
The Deputation informed me that the sole object which they personally
had in view in moving in the matter, was the PUBLIC GOOD. I differ from
them, however, in their estimate of the means and machinery by which the
public good and social prosperity are to be secured.
lam no enemy to free and honest discussion of any subject of public
interest?am ready to give due consideration to any memorial addressed to
me, whether signed by many or by few ; but Ido not think public advantage
is to be promoted by loose and intemperate discussion of questions of im-
portance, or by an agitation, which, however plausibly defended, may be

shewn to he, in sober fact, questionable or uncalled for; still less by incite-
ment to the adoption of a course of conduct on the part of any portion of
the community, which must at once infuse doubt, and possible distress, amongst
every class of individuals connected with the Gold Fields / interpose a check
alike to our present public and private prosperity, and be hailed by the
disorderly throughout the Colony as a special movement in their favor.
I will not doubt hut in the opinions here expressed, I shall be seconded
by those of a very great majority of the licensed occupants of the Gold
Districts; and I look to their principle and good sense, to yield that
obedience to the laws of the country, and support to the authorities charged
with administrating them, which both may claim from all professing them-
selves loyal subjects.
