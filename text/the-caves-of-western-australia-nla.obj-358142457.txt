"jpde Jbimestone (Baves
of Western Jiustralia.
HE beautiful Limestone Caves of Western Australia are situated in the South-West portion of the State,
between Cape Naturaliste and the Leuwin, and the known Cave Country extends north and south for from
40 to 50 miles. The Illustrations speak for themselves as to the wonderful beauties —Stalactites and
Stalagmite of fantastic shapes and dazzling whiteness are to be found in almost every chamber, associated
with lovely Shawls and Crystal floors.
Tourists may travel by railway to Busselton, a pretty little seaport town about 150 miles distant from Perth. The
nearest Cave to Busselton is called “ Yallingup,” and is reached by a drive of about 20 miles from Busselton. About
30 miles southward of “ Yallingup ” comes “ Wallcliffe,” and journeying, still further south the visitor arrives successively
at the “ Blackboy-Hollow,” “ Witchcliffe,” “ Calgardup,” “Mammoth,” and “Lake” Caves. In the neighbourhood
of the “Mammoth” there are numbers of shafts and holes, which on being explored will, no doubt, reveal beauties
similar to the caverns already traversed.
At Busselton conveyances may be procured by tourists for visiting the Caves, and the caretakers of the latter conduct
visitors through them. The Board of Management have already rendered them much more accessible by means of stair-
ways, bridges, etc., and it is purposed within a few months to properly illuminate the Caves by the erection of an
Electric-lighting Plant.
It might be mentioned that the climate of the district is an almost perfect one, especially during the summer
season, and affords great relief to those visitors who come from places having a high temperature, whilst along the sea-
coast, almost anywhere, first-rate fishing can be obtained.
