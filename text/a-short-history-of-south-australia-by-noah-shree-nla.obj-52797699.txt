THE
EXPERIENCE OF AN EMIGRANT
IN
SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
THE VOYAGE OUT.
I sailed from Southampton in May, 1856, in the ship “Eliza,”
Captain Lottit, and Doctor Pearce, with Government emigrants,
numbering about three hundred and seventy; we arrived in
Adelaide, South Australia, in August.
Our captain and doctor were men of great kindness ; we had a
good passage, and were as comfortable as persons could expect on
board ship with so great a number of passengers: it cannot be
expected to find such comforts there as on dry land. During the
voyage we had three deaths and five births; our health in general
was good, with the exception of sea sickness. We all got very
tired, and longed much to see land. We had about three days
rough weather, when the females were afraid of a watery grave,
and said, when they got on land, they would never go on the sea
again.
At the commencement of the voyage, soon after leaving South-
ampton, we were nearly all sick; for myself I was not so much as
others, so I waited upon ladies, gentlemen, and children, occasionally
washing and cooking for them, and ultimately obliged to act as
chambermaid.


THE ARRIVAL.
When we arrived in Adelaide I first tried to obtain work in my
business. After searching for days I could not obtain any; my
wife and family were allowed to remain on board for twelve days
during my trying, and in the course of my walking I took a
small cottage with two rooms at ss. per week, where I removed
my wife and six children, and was three weeks trying to get some-
thing to do. We remained some months without furniture; our
boxes served for chairs and tables, the ship beds were our bedding.
Our mess utensils on board the ship served also for the kitchen
use; we also made shift in this way for twelve months, with the
exception of a bedstead for my wife, as she said she must have one.
After three weeks I got work as a labourer at a steam mill, using
the pickaxe and shovel, cleaning up the mill, &c. I remained there
three weeks, my pay was 7s. per day; I also sent one child out to
work for 10s. per week with board, the rest were too young for
service. The first week I was out of work I was taken very ill
with the dysentery, which very nearly caused my death; I also had
very bad eyes, and my wife at the same time confined to her bed.
I was obliged to crawl to wait upon her. The Government relieved
ns with a little money and rations for three weeks. I was an
Odd Fellow of the Manchester Unity, and that Society to which I
belonged made a collection, and made up £10: with the same I
hired a bakehouse, and worked at my business, but could not get
on. Finding it would not answer, we gave that up, and I went to
service with a gentleman, a Member of Parliament. I was the
only man-servant he kept, and, was obliged to be jack of all work,
which was my first appearance in that character in my life.
I remained there thirteen weeks, when I gave notice to leave on
account of my mistress. I then went labouring again, which was
to sink a cellar, in the month of December, the weather extremely
hot, made me perspire very much. My pay was 7s. per day. It
was four miles from Adelaide. I next got work with the brick-
layers, where I had to carry the hod of mortar and stones; not


being used to such work, caused my hands to get very sore. I
remained until the work was finished, and went to Adelaide, where
I obtained work as a labourer again, working with the pickaxe,
shovel, and barrow, for 7s. per day. I had then been in the colony
six months. Labour then began to be scarce, I began to be very
tired of standing about doing nothing, and made up my mind to
try something else.
TRAVELLING.
I thought of f rying to get a few pounds of tea, and travel with, it;
also some coffee and a few other little things. The first day I.made
65.; and, after a few weeks’ practice, I found I could sell other
things with more profit, and travelled from door to door for four
months; after which I began to call at the small shops in the
suburbs of the town, and took orders in the wholesale way, carrying
some with me the same time for sale.
I then began to make a little more money, to which I added
what was saved at labour. I then commenced selling on com-
mission in the city for merchants. I also made some business with
them, still saving money; but still making shift without any fur-
niture, and with but very little for two years. Confidence then
began to be placed in me by all classes, for the manner in which I
did business.
After I had been in the colony two years I was taken very ill,
with a slow fever; for two months every person thought I should
have died. Medicine and attendance cost me many pounds, beside
the loss of 'time. A short time previous my wife was laid up with
severe illness, all which added to my expenses. When I began to
get a little better, I took a large house with four rooms, for the
benefit of our health, at 13s. 6d. per week. I made the front room
into a shop, and commenced to sell a few little things ; and when I
regained my health, I began to travel again.
In seven years after landing the cash received altogether amounted
to £9,000, during which time we had four children more, but two
5


died; in the whole we had thirteen children: so with our heavy
expenses my savings amounted to a few hundred pounds, which
made me feel anxious to visit Old England, and tell my friends
what I had seen, thinking I had saved sufficient money for that
purpose.
CLIMATE.
It is the impression of many that South Australia is a healthy
country; the changes are so many and sudden, that it has weakened
many a strong man and woman ; but many weak persons come from
England, afflicted with many complaints, soon become strong,
and enjoy their health better than some that are strong and
hearty.
The climate suits my wife very well. When in England she
suffered very much with rheumatism in the head, but soon after
arriving in the colony she got better, and never felt it since. For
myself, being obliged to work in the sun for many hours a day, it
has brought on liver complaint, which causes pains in the back, and
is very prevalent in the colony, and all hot countries. The summer
commences in December, which often is very hot; but I have
found, in each year, that February and March have been the two
hottest months; —April and May are generally very pleasant;—
June, July, August, and September are the winter months, during
which months we have much rain, which causes the city of Adelaide
to be very muddy, and much water in some of the bye streets and
roads, where they are not completed. The soil of Adelaide, in
general, is clay, lime, and brick earth, with a covering of limestone,
which is raised for building, and burned for lime. October and
November are two very pleasant months, especially before sunrise
and after sunset, when I found the air much clearer than in
England; and all the time I was in the colony, I think, we had only
six fogs. In general, the sky is clear, and at full moon a person
can see miles distance.
After sunset we have but little or no twilight; and if the moon
6


is not up, we are in darkness in half an hour afterwards, and
the gas not being extended to the back streets causes it to be
rather difficult to find out the streets in the winter months.
I have not travelled much in the interior, only fifty miles to the
north; but lam informed it is not quite so hot, which makes it
more healthy and much cheaper for new comers, as wood and water
is obtained by fetching it, and house rent much cheaper.
The changes of the weather come so sudden, that when you go
out for the day it would be advisable to take your winter coat to
come home in the evening. I have known many to be sun-struck,
who died in the street, and some in a few hours. The hottest day
1 have experienced the thermometer stood 116 in the shade; but
that does not last long before a change takes place, which is caused
by a shift in the wind; it often blows very strong, doing much
damage. The dust also in the city of Adelaide is a great annoyance
to shopkeepers, for they are at times obliged to have their doors
closed to prevent their shops being filled; and men often wear
veils, and those that do not, look very much like sweeps. The
thermometer often at those times falls to 60 degrees. In summer,
when the wind blows from the north, it is much the same as the
steam from a boiler, and lasts from two to four days. Before my
time it lasted nine days, which is very oppressive to every person,
especially new comers, and is one of the greatest drawbacks in the
colony. People cannot sleep in their houses, for they become so
hot, that many are obliged to sleep in the open air, and some cannot
sleep for the time it lasts. For myself, I cannot sleep but when
the change takes place; we want to sleep day and night, and it
often causes persons to take colds. Those who live in the country
say it is much better, and people that can afford it have residences
a few miles out of town.
We generally find the coldest weather when the wind is from
the south; the east winds are very unhealthy ; the wind from the
west is more healthy, as it comes from the sea, which is about six
miles from Adelaide. When the hot winds blow, every one wishes
it would change to the west.
The water works have been finished about two years; besides
7


this convenience, tie public fountains, and horse troughs, we also
have the streets well watered, to lay the dust in windy weather.
Since those works have been finished there are bath houses
erected, for the accommodation of ladies and gentlemen, which
in summer time numbers embrace the opportunity of cleansing
themselves from the perspiration of the day; it also is very
reviving, as the water comes from the hills and supplies the river
Torrens.
There is a fine Gas House, built about twelve months, situated
about one mile from the city. Many houses have it laid in, and
some few lamps in the streets; also the churches and chapels are
getting it laid on, and shortly nothing else will be used.
We have a fine Botanical Garden, which is open every day for
the public gratis, from ten o’clock until four: it contains hot-
houses, fountains, shrubberies, flowers, large ponds with waterfowls
of all kinds; also eagles, lammas, kangaroos, oppossums, birds of
all nations, so placed as they are in their natural state as near as
possible; emus, monkeys, and many others too numerous to be
mentioned.
We have soap and candle factories, many good schools both for
females and boys, with plenty of good teachers.
There are number of cabs, carriages, and omnibuses, which
Stand and ply to and from different places for accommodation, and
moderately cheap, much the same as you find in England, and
quite as many according to the population. But travelling by
railway is much more expensive, much slower, and more stoppages :
at present fifty miles north and seven south-west is the extent of
the line, although it is in contemplation of extending it fifty miles
further, which will be an excellent thing for all the farmers in that
direction. Ultimately it may also extend tO the river Murray; but
the country is very hilly, which would cause it to be very expensive,
and might be the means of putting the colony in debt; that, of
course, is a consideration-of the Government. But in Victoria
they have gone a-head, and made many improvements, but placed
themselves much in debt. South Australia is not the same. We
have .to thank the good sense of the superior Members of the
8


Government; and for the time I have been in the colony, I never
knew any money to be laid out extravagantly. The two Governors
have proved themselves most sensible men; they have travelled
much in the country, to learn the wants and manners of the people;
of course those men represent the Queen, and I must say the
public shows as much loyalty as is shown in England. Her
Majesty is never forgotten at any of the public meetings, for both
her health and wishing her a happy reign are often drunk with -as
much gusto as has ever been done by any in England.
In conclusion, I must inform you, that there is a nice retreat in
going to what is called the “ Bay,” where numbers of families
spend a few months of the hottest weather, where they have a
splendid opportunity of sea bathing, which is so beneficial to health.
The fare by the omnibus is a shilling each way; the distance is
about seven miles from the city. For sleeping the charge is Is. 6d.
Meals the same. Many go with their families for the day to
bathe and have a little recreation on the beach with the sea
breeze, coming home in the evening quite refreshed. It is in
contemplation to have a railway or tramroad to the Bay. I think
many things of this sort would suit English capitalists, for it often
gives good interest for their money, from six to ten per cent. I
often wonder that English capitalists do no employ agents to invest
in this way, or in building, in order to receive ten per cent, for
their money. The rents would be lower than they are at present.
ON EMIGRANTS ARRIVING.
When an emigrant ship arrives in the stream, at Port Adelaide,
she is first boarded by the health officer, who inspects the ship and
every passenger, to ascertain that they are all in perfect health,
which he reports. Then they are allowed to come on shore, seek
for work, and return at night to the ship, if they wish, for twelve
days, with their provisions provided as on the passage. When
the health officer makes his report all in perfect health, their names
are published in the newspapers, giving the public, who may be in
9


want of servants, an opportunity to go on board and select their
servants, when many of them are taken by their employers from the
ship to their new homes.
If the whole of the single females are not engaged, the Govern-
ment sends conveyances, and brings them to a place selected for
them, called “ The Females’ Home,” where they are allowed to
remain until they get employment. People go to this home, and
select from those that are there, chiefly from the country, who
oftentimes escape snares that young females fall into in the city,
and it is considered a good thing, for many get deceived and ruined
for life.
When mistresses or masters come on board to hire their servants,
it is best to take the first opportunity, and take what wages is
offered, so you might leave at any time, or with a month’s warning.
Do not enter into any engagement for any length of time, for
during short services you will gain colonial experience, when you
will be better able to judge for yourselves, whether it would be
best to stop in the place you have, or take any other, as the case
may be, and learn the value of your services in the labour market.
I have known many who stood out for much higher wages than was
offered; by doing so they exhausted their little money before
obtaining a situation, and become displeased with the colony at
once. Others have taken the first opportunity, learnt experience,
saved a little money, kept their spirits up, made a change for more
wages, and became quite pleased with themselves, and glad of their
coming to the colony.
Sometimes some of those will go to Sydney or Melbourne,
thinking of improving their position after saving a little money in
the first year; but generally they spend all they have, and return,
saying, “ Adelaide is the best place, the most quiet, and the most
friendly.” I have myself always found it the most quiet and most
friendly of all the towns that ever I lived in.
The emigrant ships generally bring from three to four hundred
each, and often two or three of these arrive together: in a very
short time there are none to be seen, some going to the country,
some in the city, all soon disappear, and hands soon wanted as.


before, and many cannot get hands without paying very high
wages. When any buildings are going on in or near the city, every
person that is willing to work can obtain it.
When I first arrived in the colony, I found there the best friends
I ever did in life, and among perfect strangers. Fresh comers,
called “New Chums,” generally find great kindness both from
friends and their masters, and often get employment first before
older chums; but not quite so high wages is given them until their
employers have tried them.
Those that have families, and those that are fit for service, will
be sure to get a place at small wages, and their food (which is an
assistance to their fathers and mothers) at first; but after a few
months, when they get settled a little, those can be sent to school,
for there are plenty of good schools. In this manner I proceeded,
which I found to be a good plan. Husbands, prevail on your
wives not to purchase much furniture for the first twelve months, or
until you find that it is likely you might be permanently situated.
I bought no furniture for the first two years, but had a great deal
of trouble with my wife on account of it; for she was continually
wanting me to purchase some.
It is a very common thing for new chums to live in a house
without any furniture, making in the day tables and chairs of their
boxes, and at night the same for bedsteads with their beds used on
board the ship, bringing also from the ship what kitchen utensils
they can ; if not sufficient, borrow from your neighbour until you
have the same, and do not think yourselves different from any other
persons, as great numbers have done likewise.
ON DRESS AND HABITS IN THE CITY.
The dress generally worn in winter is much the same as in the
mother country; bjit in summer, which is much hotter than in
England, it is more suitable in lightness, and many different styles
for comfort and to guard against the sun. Gentlemen wear what
is termed “Panamah,” and shell-drab hats, with a long piece of


white muslin round the head, and a long end of it hanging down
the back, which would make a person unacquainted with the style
think they are going to a funeral. Many travel with white
umbrellas, and some wear very thin clothes ; but some say, “ What
keeps the cold out, will also keep the heat out.” I often think
there is money wasted in dress, amongst the ladies especially, as
they all seem to appear very stylish; for my wife, like the rest,
is very fond of a gold watch and chain.
I have been in the habit of selling much fancy goods to the
same, and have taken the money that the baker and butcher should
have had, and that is not the way to get rich; for that money
ought to be saved. I have some pleasure in saying I did not spend
my little money in such a way. If a poor agricultural labourer
knew what I do, he would come or go to Adelaide the first chance he
could get, if he could not obtain a living at home; but he must not
think to go to live in idleness, because he will have to work hard,
and turn his hand to anything, which I am well aware of from my
own experience, and did it for the first six months. I worked hard,
lived hard, and laid hard. My wife often felt vexed, and cried for
the want of some nice furniture and clothes, so as to be in the
fashion with other people ; but I would not listen, nor allow her to
have all she wanted, to spend the money as fast as my hard labour
could get it, for the first year in the colony—and I did it during
the hottest months in the year, and was very glad to get something
to do to support a wife and six children, with only one capable of
doing anything in the shape of work. I remained at labour and in
service for six months, during which time I saved a few pounds;
then I purchased a little furniture, and found I was likely to remain
in Adelaide. Many, through the persuasions of their wives, make
use of what money they possess in purchasing furniture, and other
things that could be dispensed with, on their first landing, and in a
few weeks get a situation in the country, which compels them to sell
all they have bought at a great loss; and, frrtn my experience, it
would be much better to rough it out, and ought to make up your
jninds. to do so; then, if anything turns, out better than you
expect, you will not be disappointed. My case was a very bad one,'


myself and wife both ill in bed at the same time, and obliged to be
relieved by Government, as all do in such cases. I often noticed a
rough beginning teaches economy to many, when they get money,
as they know the best way to lay it out; and it also teaches them
the prices of the different shopkeepers, as they vary considerably:
so they gain judgment and carefulness. There is no particular
standard of prices in Adelaide, as in the old country.
Money is gained quickly, and, without care or judgment, it goes
quickly; so make shift the first year, and save every shilling and
pound you can, during which time you will be gaining experience
and judgment, saving a few pounds, and be the cause of becoming a
master of a small trade or business. There are many small places
to be obtained at times to open in, and, if industrious and honest,
many will give you credit and assistance. Should luck be on your
side, you will be able to save money. Mind to keep from bad
company, from drinking and following public houses—not to drink
With any one, as the drink is very dear, except colonial wine.
Sometimes the weather is very hot, and the strong drink might
cause you to do many things in business you might be sorry for; so
drink with none, but take a little colonial wine and water home by
yourself if needed; people using strong drink in hot climates get
more excited than in colder countries.
.1 must say, if you want to save money, you must not keep any
company, although some say it is a sin to save money; but when a
man has a wife and thirteen children to support, they would like to
have a little saved to do so, and especially in case of sickness
oi death. You may in this colony, without money, get more friends
than in England; but if you have money, you will have more
friends. I do not speak against drinking as if I was a pledged
teetotaller, for lam not; but like a little at times, especially the
pure juice of the grape : but if a man keeps drinking company, he
never will save much money.
In the hot weather, when we cannot eat much, I have found wine
and water to be the best drink a man can use; in a few years I
think the colonial wine will be the best drink for a person, of all
drinks, and the cheapest., I have already stated what myself and


family use, and what good drink we find it in warm weather. A
gallon is the smallest quantity the makers can retail without a
licence; hut at the hotels it can be purchased by the bottle or
glass. Many are getting much wiser, and use it more in lieu of
the English ales and spirits, which are quicker stimulants, and not
so nourishing to the body as the wine; and the drink at some of
the hotels are very strong, so much so, that persons after using
it for some time have been obliged to be taken to the Asylum.
ON THE RACES.
The race-ground is situated about two miles from the city, in a large
field, or so-called paddock, in Australia. It has wooden railings
round it, which mark the course the horses run. It is also nearly
round, which gives the spectators an excellent opportunity of
seeing the riders all the way. The grand stand is a permanent
building made of wood, capable of holding about 800 persons, with
a commodious refreshment-room underneath. The day I went the
people numbered about four thousand, with numbers of carriages
driven by the servants in their white gloves, and many pairs, both
private and on hire. Irish jaunting-cars, cabs, omnibusses, brakes
and dog-carts displaying their figures in great numbers. The fare
from the city is one shilling each way. The weather during this is
generally very dusty, and the foremost horses make so much dust
that the hinder onces scarcely can see; but on the whole I think it
a very good race-cource for such a young country as this, and the
races are every year increasing, as there are many sporting gentle-
men in Australia. I also observed the Governor, his two daughters,
son-in-law, and many leading men of the colony, as this year has
been one of the finest ever witnessed, on account of seven of the
Melbourne horses with a number of sporting gentlemen. Some
of those horses were also brought from England, which tended to
great expense. I saw twelve horses start, the seven Melbourne
horses ran, and one of them won the thousand pound stakes. The
jockeys are dressed like those in England,


The charge to the grand stand is 55.; and there is a brass band
for amusement, and nine or ten drinking booths, with many games,
such as skittles, quoits, and a stand with flying horses; and an
Organ, the first I ever saw in the colony, which did a good trade
among the young men; but many are come since from different
parts of the colony. There were also many fruit and cake stalls,
•with other amusements; but not so much gambling as in Old
England. The ladies shine quite as much if not more; and many
had their gay silks and dresses spoilt by the dust, which is far more
here than in England. There are two races during the year, each
lasting about four days, but many private races are run, and cricket
matches played on the same ground. Cricket is beginning to be
mnoh played. A person coming to Australia can find plenty of
amusement if wished for, or might expect to find in so young a
donntry. They also keep more holidays than in England, also
plenty of balls, with a theatre, and they are all well attended with
some very fine buildings for the same purpose, and by many of the
working classes, who can afford it better than the same can in the
old country. I find many quite as foolish in the colony as they
are in England, to work hard for their money, and spend it in
amusement, keeping themselves always poor; and those are the
very people who find fault with the colony, and say they wish they
had never come. Those persons never have money to purchase
any article that might offer cheap; and many use much of their
money in gambling, keeping themselves also poor, not a pound
saved to meet any thing of a bargain, which many times is offered
from the country.
I knew one single young man who came in the same ship with
me, that saved £3OO in four years. He was a journeyman
carpenter. Another carpenter, also, that turned his hand to
wheelwrighting, saved £4OO in seven years, and bought property
to that amount. He was a married man when he landed, but
no family; and during the time had four children. Now he is in
business himself, employing three men, and often gets more work
than he can accomplish, not being able to obtain hands to do that
sort of work.'
15


I have mentioned these two men, because they landed with me
as mechanics, with little or no money, to show what industry and
Care will do, and knowing them both.
, I speak from what I have seen ; and these are the sort of men
that are sure to get on, especially when landing without money, as
I have before stated, oftentimes become the best and wealthiest of
men, more so than those that have money, as those will not turn
their hands, to any kind of work that may offer. But new comers
9Ught not to be too particular as to what they do, as the money
yarned hy handiwork makes them rather more careful in spending
it, and ’so learn experience for a future day. I must also inform
all that might go to Australia, that Adelaide is the quietest colony
to go to. The people are more staple and friendly, more ready to
assist a new chum (as a new comer is termed) ; but in Melbourne,
I am told, they are always ready to take your teeth out of your
head if you do not shut your mouth. I was myself in Melbourne
about five years since, and it is my opinion of the people also. So
if any person wishes for a quiet life, go to Adelaide.
If you cannot procure work immediately you arrive, you will
soon meet friends, especially when they know you are a new chum,
and not a drunkard; and I hope all that go will never make a
common practice of following beer-shops to waste their money,
but save it and become their own masters. I think persons that
drink in the colony injure themselves and families much more than
they would in England. If a man cannot get work at first at his
own trade, there are plenty of opportunities if he only looks out;
and any person humbling himself, even to breaking stones, is never
thought anything the worse for it, but rises and makes a fortune
afterwards.
When you first land, should you be fortunate to obtain a situa-
tion, you may be enticed or persuaded by your wife to purchase fine,
furniture, dress, and comforts. When all is got and you are not
much richer, you may, by some means, have to leave that situation,
perhaps, for a better, to go into the country; then all the fine
furniture has to be sold at a great sacrifice ; whereas, if the same,
money had been saved, you would bo better prepared to meet such
16


things. Persons should not think themselves settled too soon, for
fear that something better might offer, perhaps to go up the
country some fifty or a hundred miles; then the home must be
broken up. But as I have stated from my own experience,
purchase but little or nothing more than is actually necessary
feu: a year or two, and save your money; you will find it much
the safest plan, which was mine, but not my wife’s. I was obliged
to be much displeased, but did that which I know now was best;
but she always found fault, and wanted plenty of furniture, and buy
her things to look smart; but I had a large family of thirteen
children, and it was very expensive to keep them in the city. The
country is much cheaper and far the best for a labouring man, as
rent, firing, and clothes are much cheaper.
I went myself into the country soon after I came, and it was
much the cheapest, especially when a person’s mind is made up to
save money. I have seen many tradesmen become insolvents in
the colony, and it is often caused by their wives’ pride; for some
of them will have such expensive dresses, and everything in the
fashion, not caring how or where the money is to come from, so as
they can make themselves smart. Many of our richest ladies come
from the lower classes; their husbands have been to Victoria
diggings, been fortunate, and made their fortunes; many of them
were badly off in their own country. There are many chances of
making money, if only looked for, and easy.
I have known many persons who have been here a few years,
left the colony, gone home, remained a short time, and soon became
discontented and returned again. lam not saying this to tempt
any person from their comfortable homes; for if you are comfort-
able, by all means stop where you are; for common sense will tell
you that trouble and trials will be sure to follow you if you go.
Still, should your mind be fixed on going, I would advise those not
to lumber themselves with more boxes or things than they actually
want for the voyage, as things can be purchased, at times, cheaper
than in England, saving the trouble and expense of bringing them.

ON IRISH EMIGRANTS.
There are great numbers of Irish who have left Ireland for South
Australia, by means of assisted passages, which is done by haying
a friend or relative to pay £5 in Adelaide for each adult, giving
the person’s name and address, so they will have sent to them their
pass or passage papers, which will bring them out free of any other
charge. Many hundred have come in this way, and, with care
numbers are doing well. The west-end of the city is occupied
chiefly by Irish, many of their wives keep cows, milk them, and
carry round the milk. The husbands go to different sorts of
labour; those that are saving and careful are the persons who are
soon able to purchase cows, and get a small shop with green
groceries, &o. Those persons also, with their savings, do show
their kindness by sending home for their remaining relatives, in
the way I have mentioned, through the Emigration Office in
London. Many of those people • seem very hard working and
industrious people; many of their daughters make very good
servants, and they show great kindness to their parents, by assist-
ing them from their wages. Many other country girls do not show
that kindness as these do in general. _ Many of those families are
living in their own houses, which they have purchased by their
handiwork and industry. They all seem to stick together, and the
chief part of them attend the Catholic Church. They have about
six clergymen in Adelaide, and a very fine Catholic Cathedral.
I think, also, that South Australia has turned out an excellent
country for many, of the poor Irish, numbers of them have become
good farmers, and only been in the colony a few years, have made
a great deal of money.
The Governor is an Irishman, and so was his predecessor; and a
great number of the policemen are Irish.


ON TRADES.
There are in the colony a few Chinese, and most of them are
cabinet-makers, and very good workmen.
Also a great number of Germans, many of them in b usiness in
the city; they are very quiet and civil people, and good workmen,
and those in the country have proved excellent gardeners. I have
done much business with many of them, and like them much ; there
are numbers of trades amongst them, and most of them are very
clever as tradesmen.
Coaches and carriages were formerly imported; but now there
are several coach factories. They are much more expensive than
those imported from England.
I think furniture is getting cheaper than in England, and the
workmen can turn out some excellent work, for there are some very
clever ; and the wood generally used is the Sydney cedar, which is
brought in very large logs, and it is very handsome. Some of it is
cut by sawyers, and some, or most, is cut by steam saw mills. Most
of the trades are doing well, and progressing every year ; and still
there is a great want of mechanics, and I think it will be the case
for some time to come, or many years yet, as the colony is more
thickly populated, and many with plenty of money, who do not know
in what way to spend it for the best; but many will invest in build-
ing, as emigration is still increasing and money also increasing by
them. Houses in Adelaide are very scarce, and much so in the
country. I know, from what I have seen and heard, that South
Australia will be the best colony of the whale, as it is progressing
so steady and substantial, not so much in debt as other colonies. It
shows that the ministry have always acted very judiciously, and com-
posed always of very clever members. For the time I have been in
the colony, I have known them to act always very wisely. Also I
know there have been two excellent governors. I must point out a
few things which have been done, which also the public have been
most thankful for, and received so much benefit from, namely, the
19


groat improvements in the roads and footpaths, for both foot-
passengers and carriages; also fine waterworks, which are situated
about seven miles from the city. They supply every house with a
tap, so the occupants can use what water they wish and at a very low
rate. Previous to this the water had to be brought from the river
in carts, at Is. 6d. for a wine-pipe full, and that at times very unfit
for drinking, on account of the river being filled with cattle and
many other causes; but now we can always, even in the hottest
seasons, have a beautiful glass of cold and clear water from the tap.
I had to pay Is. per week for a house of five rooms, and everyone
thinks highly of it.
FARMING PRODUCE.
It is my humble opinion this colony, South Australia, will be one of
the finest and most productive in the British dominions. I know
myself several vessels to be laden for Melbourne, Queensland, Sydney,
and New South Wales this year with flour and wheat. Also when
the grapes are in season, hundreds of boxes are sent to other parts of
Australia, with bacon, eggs, and poultry, showing the superiority of
the south; and year after year shows its increasing supplies, not only
in any one particular item, but in all, chiefly in agricultural produce.
After every harvest, the farmers find such immediate demand, causes
them to extend their plough to the extent of their power. Moreover,
this land can boast of producing the finest wheat and best flour in
the world, and would do well if the farmers would have some sent
to England to mix with theirs. This also shows that when a country
possesses such rich and good land, it is the foundation of that
country to grow rich. Even at the present we receive no goods in
return for what we send, Melbourne is often anxiously waiting for
the Adelaide supplies.
Tens of thousands of acres yet lay idle for want of farmers to
drive the plough over them. Hay, barley, and oats are not so much
grown as in England. Potatoes are grown in large quantities in
some parts, which are generally very fine and very good, some of
20


the finest I ever saw. The prices vary from ss. to 10s. per cwt.,
and many grow two crops a year. Onions, also in some places, are
grown in large quantities, and they run oftentimes very large and
good, are sold this year at 6s. the cwt. Carrots also are grown in
many places, and run a good size. Parsnips do not grow so fine,
nor turnips, as in England. Cabbages, in general, run a very large
size, which must prove a good land for them. I have seen them
very large. Cherries are increasing every year, and becoming very
plentiful, and are sold from 3d. to 6d. per pound in the middle of
the season.
Pruit and vegetables, in general, run very good and large, but
much dearer than in England. Some of the gardens have the water
running through them, which adds to the growth, especially the fruit
trees.
Almonds are already plentiful, and all kinds of fruits will be soon.
Apples and pears are sold by the pound, from 2d. to 4d. per pound.
Apricots and peaches also are very plentiful, and are grown in
large quantities, and are very fine. Germans are the greatest
gardeners here; and some of them have commenced growing
oranges, and have produced some very fine ones.
Gooseberries and currants do not seem to grow so plentiful or so
large ; the soil does not suit them.
Grapes are both good and plentiful; they are grown both in
gardens and large vineyards, which extend some acres, and are as
common as fields of turnins in England; the rows are about four
feet apart.
In some of the vineyards are gathered from forty to fifty tons per
year; many are sold at Id. per pound, the best sort for 2d. per
pound, at the retail shops. A great many of the grapes are made
into wine, and sold at 4s. per gallon, which I have given myself, for
three or four years, to one man who makes the wine himself; it is
kept in casks from two hundred to three hundred gallons each.
The cellars are spacious and generally underground. What myself
and family used has been about one gallon per week, and that one
year old. It is drunk in tumblers, as ale in England; in the
summer, it quenches the thirst very much with a little water.
21


After the wine is taken from the grapes, the refuse is boiled and
distilled into brandy, which produces some of the strongest I ever
tasted, The wine is getting more plentiful and will be cheaper,
unless they export it further than Victoria. When it is brought to
more perfection, it will reach England and other countries.
The bacon brought from the country is very fine, and sold from
Bd. to lOd. per pound. Eggs from Bd. to Is. per dozen. Turkeys
and geese are fine, from ss. to 6s. 6d. each.
Pigs are not so plentiful; they are not allowed to be kept in or
near the city of Adelaide.
Beef and mutton are not so fat as in England ; the average prices
are from 2d. to sd. per pound.
Horses are plentiful, generally well-bred, and will stand more
work, fatigue, or hardships than English horses. Many of them are
ridden fifty miles per day, and nothing but the grass to eat at night,
while the rider sleeps under his woollen rug ; off again in the morn-
ing, and they will stand this several days. They also stand the hot
weather quite well, travelling all day in it, and seem to do it quite
easy, with good food and water. -They are a great trouble to break in.
The bullocks are much used, and they take heavy loads; from
two to eight are used in a dray, the driver often swearing, whipping,
and shouting to them; but they travel well in hot weather.
! The feeding of the cattle is done with very nutritious food ; it is
generally with wheat and oats ; when green, cut and made into hay,
and stacked as com stacks. When for sale, it is cut into trusses, and
sold from £3 to £4 per ton delivered. Many small farmers grow
much of it.
The wheat very soon ripens, and a great portion ripens together,
and cannot be got in for want of bands; a great quantity is cut with
the reaping machine, which is drawn by four horses or bullocks;
the same is thrashed and dressed in the field, after being gathered,
then sent to the mill. Often ground the next day, and the follow-
ing day sent out as flour. The gathering of the wheat in such good
order is the cause of such facility. The southern parts of the
Colony do not commence harvest so soon, by one month, as other
parts, as it is colder, but healthier.


It is not the manure that causes such fine wheat to be grown
here (for none or little is used) year after year without it; but the
soil produces such fine crops naturally.
Our farmers are working men themselves, who came out as free
emigrants, and hired themselves to masters. If they meet with a
good one, they remain with him three or four years, until they are
capable of hiring a section of eighty acres each for himself. He
generally pays part of the money at the commencement, and
instalments every year until the whole is paid; when it becomes
his own property, which is generally completed, being fortunate, in
two or three years, which I consider is a first-rate chance and
system for any labouring man to adopt, and wish I could see more
of my countrymen doing the same thing. I am sorry that, during
my stay in the colony, I have not had much experience in the
country, so as to enable me to give a more lengthened description
of it; but for an agricultural labouring man, who is willing to work,
this is the place for him. Also, there is plenty of encouragement
offered, both by good payment and opportunities, as I have already
stated. Victoria, as a farming district, is not anything near so far
advanced as South Australia, which I made known to you before, —
that we supply that colony with many commodities, the produce of
the south.
When the farmer has not sufficient work for his men, he cuts
wood, and sends the same to the city for sale. This is often sold
at 18s. and £1 per ton; it is sent sometimes ten, twelve, and
fourteen miles, and done with two bullocks. The wood is much
different to that in England, as some of it resembles the hardness
of stone, but will burn very well. These are as follow, —stringy
bark, shee oak, peppermint, white gum, blue gum, red gum, wottle
wood. These are the principal sorts that are burnt; but there are
other sorts. Much stringy bark is used for fencing, and some hard
wood in making wheels of carriages, carts, and drays, which is
much better to stand the heat than English wood. America has
sent great quantities of deals and pines; also New South Wales
and Sydney. Van Diemen’s Land sends shingles, which are used,
already split, for roofing.
23


Bullocks are muck cheaper here than in England. Donkeys are
very scarce. I have never seen but one, and that appeared very
small, and moved but slowly. It did my heart good to see him.
Soon after the summer commences, the grass round the city has
no bush to shade ; it is burnt up by the heat of the sun, the cattle
are deprived of the enjoyment of their green food, and the appear-
ance of vegetation vanishes from our sight; one would think it is
dead for ever.
In the bush, also, as the summer advances, the grass dries up,
and, taking fire by the heat of the sun, burns for days; destroying
large trees and bushes for miles. Some parts of the bushes are
often cleared by setting them on fire, so as to clear the land. My
experience of the bushes is but scanty; but I have gleaned from
information what I have stated. '
In the month of April, farmers are often anxious for rain, which
is the commencement of winter; but May is often dry, June
generally wet, and July plenty of rain. Ploughing begins in
April, and sowing the wheat from six to twelve weeks; rain is
more or less expected, sometimes scarcely a dry day during the
whole time; and as I have already observed, the state the rain
makes the back streets of the city and roads in, cause the people to
live a few miles from the city, to bring all their produce to market,
and purchase the whole of their necessary articles for their use
during the winter or rainy season, as travelling is so bad. Farming
implements are nearly all imported from Grantham, in England.
Many farms and stations keep a blacksmith, for the purpose of
repairing, making, and shoeing their horses; also a carpenter or
wheelwright. They also make their own drays and carriages.
Farmers generally work with their men, also board together, and
live more on an equality, which has caused many of the men who
came with me from England to be glad that they came here here to
work, without that slave-driving manner from their masters. By
industry many became their own masters; and with diligence,
until they become old, their farms will realize sufficient to enable
them to rest from work. Young men coming to the colony first
must work, and that rather hard, which is nothing more than they


Lave been doing in England with very small wages; but here the
wages are more, and board in addition.
According to my opinion, men in England desirous of increasing
their little capital, or laying it out to a good advantage, could not
do better than come out here, enter into a system of farming, and
they will with care and diligence be sure of doing well. I offer
this opinion to those who find their own farming business not
improving, and rather remain to lose what little capital they have
year after year in England.
I have also a suggestion to make with respect to small farmery
who can afford to pay £ls for their passage, for the same to receive
a grant of Crown land, adequate to that sum. That same land will
become cultivated, the produce will be more, and the colony will be
peopled with substantial and useful men. I am well aware that
numbers of free emigrants who have been brought by Government
have saved a few pounds, then left for other colonies; whereas a
man possessing land, and finds it so productive as it is, would never
leave ; but, be anxious to purchase more, to extend his plough.
If this plan be approved of by Government, and farmers there
would be persons of other business with little capital, be induced, to
come, bringing agricultural labourers with them, so that they might
have the land which the money pays for them, and have them to
work the land also, I think many would be enticed to avail them-
selves of the opportunity. By this system it would cost less
expense to Government, the emigrants would be better satisfied,
and the colony so much more benefited with the increase of
produce.
The farmer has an opportunity at times of engaging the natives
(blacks) to cut his wheat. The manner in which they make the
agreement is, by giving them £1 each, and plenty of “tucker ” (a
word for food), and to their “lubrows ” (wives) and “picaninnies
(childrren), to sleep in the stables or barns. By this agreement
they soon go to work, with the whole of their clothes off; working
causes them to perspire, which runs from them freely. The smell
which arises from them is so offensive that it prevents anyone to
work with them. A certain quantity of wheat is allotted to be cut*


and no payment until the work is finished; for many would walk off
if they had the money beforehand. Some have been engaged to
split so much wood for burning, and received the payment at once;
and the first opportunity they were missing. They are generally
lazy; in the mornings, when they have to go to work, the farmers
are obliged to wake them up; but when at work in the sun, they
can do more than white men.
The natives, also, like short jobs. They would rather have them
with less pay. It has been proved they will work well when their
employers treat them with kindness. They are also particular with
respect to payment and promises, and do not like to be deceived ; if
so, they are a long time before they forgive.
By these people farmers get plenty of work done; but they
prefer white men if they could be obtained.
SHEEP FARMING
Is one of the greatest money-making affairs in the colony. Many
persons who were fortunate in the commencement of the colony
have taken to sheep farming, others who came with capital from
England; and it is astonishing the money that is made by it. Most
of the proprietors have overseers and managers, themselves living
in the city, or a few miles from it. Those people transact all
business on the run or runs, as the case may be, looking after the
shepherds and stores by the aid of a store-keeper, who issues all
provisions, and sells all kinds of wearing apparel, tobacco, and all
necessary articles, which are deducted from their wages. Shepherds
have huts, and are allowed to have their wives and families with
them, who are allowed a portion of the victualling, which is drawn
from the store every week; mutton as much as they can use. It
does not require such great experience to become a shepherd, for I
know many gents who have spent foolishly all their money, and
were compelled to go shepherding four or five hundred miles up the
country. One instance, while a man was driving the sheep, a letter
was placed in his hand, which informed him of the death of his


father, by which he became heir to his property and his title of
Lord. This took place about fifty miles from Adelaide. Many
other such cases have occurred. The reason I speak of such occur-
rences is, to show that not much experience is required in shepherd-
ing. A great number of persons who came to the colony with
nothing, have generally done the best, and become the most wealthy.
Should a shepherd leave England with a little money, he should
first get employment, save what little money he has, and when he
has gained a little experience, purchase sheep to the extent of his
money, and permission will be granted him to have his sheep along
with his master’s ; and after a few years, by adding to their number,
he would be capable of hiring a small run. This some have
done ; but many also after being some time employed in this way
come to Adelaide, and spend the whole they have saved in perfect
foolishness. Young men who are tradesmen have been shepherding,
and the life being a lazy one, oftentimes has been the occasion of
their not becoming much of business men again.
HORSES.
As I have mentioned what horses in the colony will stand, I may also
add that they are bred by many, and a great number of broken and
unbroken kind are sent to the city and sold by auction, which causes
them to be somewhat cheaper. Many females ride on horseback,
and are recommended to do so by the doctors. Many of the breeds
have been crossed, and some turned out very good; they are very
wild, and it requires great trouble to break them in. Kace-horses
have been brought from England; those in the colony are not so
heavy, and their stabling not so warm as in England.
Many horses are used for cabs, omnibusses and mails; all letters,
—except on one line of railway, for fifty miles—are conveyed by
coaches over South Australia, for some hundreds of miles; the
country in some parts is very hilly, so much so, that the passengers
often have to walk.


ON FRUIT AND GARDENING.
As I have already stated the principal fruits and vegetables grown
in the colony, I wish to explain more fully some particulars
of them. Since I first wrote on this subject, I have had some
conversation, for information, with one of the largest gardeners in
the colony, from which I can state that every year brings its
increase both in size and quantity. At the agricultural shows it
has been demonstrated to what perfection the fruit is coming ; and
without any prejudice, I must say that the apples and pears are
the largest I ever saw in my life. Most other fruits are equally
large. It gladdened my heart to see them. People in England
must not run away with the idea that Australia is nothing but a
land of bushes; quite the reverse, gardens, wheatfields, cornfields,
and vineyards have taken their places. The grapes that are grown
in them would astonish a person that never witnessed anything of
the kind.
This will show you that the soil is good, and Australia possesses
different sorts of soil, which prove to be of such a nature as to suit
the different fruits and vegetables. The above-mentioned person
also told me that the soil is fit to produce any fruit that grew on
trees, and that to perfection; and where it is possible to convey
through the gardens the water that runs from the hills, they often
produce two crops of grapes a-year.
The oranges are finer this year than before. A person had on one
tree a cluster of fourteen pounds. Lemons also are increasing
both in number and size. All fruits have been cheaper this year,
1864, than some years past.
I have myself visited some gardens, which are situated from
four to ten miles from Adelaide, and was astonished at the sight
of such fine crops.
I have a great reason for repeating this fruit history, for it does
credit to those that have cultivated their gardens, and brought
them to such perfection.


This colony has been supplied with oranges from New South Wales
in great quantities. Apples from Tasmania, Yan Dieman’s Land.
But now the colony will soon be capable of producing sufficient
for its consumption, or more, unless emigration increases in its
numbers.
The pine apple is also very fine, and I think the finest in the
world.
With respect to the different soils, they are as follows :—Marie,
white and blue clay, some mixed, sandy, white and black moors,
much greasy, like butter when cut, or mud when a pond is cleared
and black, that will grow cabbages to an immense size.
I have before mentioned what the colony possesses in stone,
slate, marble, iron, lead, silver, copper, and gold. Copper, slate,
and marble are in large quantities, especially copper, which has
many mines open in full work, yielding an abundance; a great
quantity has been sent to England, and also to other parts of the
world, which is done by nearly every ship that leaves.
The slate is much used for grave stones and paving, in lieu of
flagstones.
The iron has not been worked yet, but many say it would pay
well to do so.
Silver has been raised in large quantities, and sent to England.
The shareholders seem quite satisfied with its produce.
There is also a very large stone quarry, a few miles from
Adelaide, which has two colours, white and red. The same is
chiefly used for building purposes, and many carters are employed
in bringing it to the city. Several young men have saved sufficient
money to purchase a cart and horse, and entered into this employ-
ment, and are getting a good living in carting this stone to where
the buildings are going on. Many of those who began with one
cart, through their diligence, are possessors of several, and employ
men themselves.


HEALTH.
I have often got up with the sun, done my business, and laid
myself down in the middle of the day. Many work all the day,
and it seems to take but little effect upon them. Some of the lower
classes drink a great quantity of ale and porter, and get drunk;
in the morning they find themselves locked up, and have to pay
five shillings. Some say they like the hot weather, but I cannot
say so myself. There are not so many catching diseases here as in
England. I have known families troubled with a very bad one,
that comes in the throat, who died very soon of the same.
Colds are often and sooner caught here than in England ; and the
sick do not lay so long before they die; they also only keep the
dead a day or two before they are buried. Many take cold on
account of not being more careful in changing their clothes in the
evening, as it generally comes colder when the sun goes down.
Constitutions here require more taking care of than in England.
Children are often taken ill, and it is with great trouble that parents,
with the assistance of medical advice, can keep them alive.
There are many doctors here, but they are very expensive in
their attendance; they charge £2 2s. for a confinement to visit
three times, and ss. every visit afterwards, besides medicine, and
so much per mile when required out of town. Should you be a
stranger, they want their money before leaving your house ; if you
are known to them, it is not so, they will wait. Persons in the
colony ought to be very abstemious from strong drinks and animal
food. Many use much ripe fruit, which is better for the health.
Wearing apparel must be considered here to prevent illness, and
woollen clothing is, by far, the best: when perspiration is in the
cotton clothing, it always feels damp and cold, but the woollen does
not, and persons are not so liable to take cold. At times, when
the hot winds blow, persons cannot sleep; but when the changes
take place is when there ought to be most care taken, as the hot
winds are very oppressive ; also the whirlwinds, which are preva-
30


lent, take volumes of dust and many other things up a great
height in the air ; parts of houses have known to be taken up with
them. During winter months we have much rain, and require the
same or warmer clothing than when in England, as the summer is
so hot, which causes the people to feel the cold more; but new
comers do not feel the cold so much, and are more healthy in
general than old colonists. Those that are born in the country say
they prefer the summer, and, I doubt not, the next generation will
like the climate better.
I generally find, in all persons, a great inclination to return to
their native land after they have made their fortunes, or saved suf-
ficient money to return home.
Many tradesmen, after having been in business in the city, take
sheep stations up the country, and come to town every three or
four months. They say their health is much better in the country
than in town, and seldom or ever hear of any of them failing, but
make plenty of money; for the wool fetches a good price.
We often have much thunder and lightning in the summer time
without rain.
By the telegrams, Adelaide has not so much rain as many other
parts of the colony, and is longer without; although, in winter,
I have known it to rain two and three days without ceasing, and
causing great floods: the water coming from hills and high lands
in large bodies and with great force, oftentimes doing much
destruction, carrying sheds and many other things that come in its
way before it, and swelling the river Torrens to a large size : yet,
during the warm weather, it is only a small stream; but always
supplies a sufficiency of water to the city.
I think the inhabitants of South Australia have much to thank
God for in having been placed ip such a plentiful country, after
Laving been slave-driven by some masters.
I must say, from what I have witnessed, that many do feel them-
soves thankful to live in such a country of tranquillity, which is
caused by a general good feeling and love towards each other, more
SO than that which exists in the mother country.
31


ON THE CITY OF ADELAIDE.
Adelaide is becoming a fine city, and excellently laid out; the
streets all run from north to south, and from east to west. Those
who have not seen it would be surprised to find such fine buildings,
and so many at the present time in erection. I have not seen such
such progress during the eight years I have been in the colony.
The buildings which were erected in the earlier days of the colony
are far different to what they are at present; the material used then
was lime stone, which was taken from about six inches beneath the
surface ; since which, the quarry I have already spoken of has been
found about four miles from the city. Also good brick-earth only
two miles distant. Of late years, the buildings have been com-
posed of those materials, brick and stone, which are more sub-
stantial than the limestone, but, at present, most parts of the fronts
are composed of freestone, which is brought about four miles and
a half from the city.
The governor’s house, in which he lives, is a fine building; his
salary is £4,000 a year.
The Parliament house is a good building, not overlarge; it has
been sufficiently large for the colonial ministry to transact their
political business.
Other Government buildings, for offices, are also very fine and
substantial.
The General Post Office is close to these; it is in contempla-
tion of rebuilding it, when, I cannot say.
There is also a noble building, the Mechanics’ Institute.
The railway station is a brick building, with large and spacious
goods shed, with a neat terminus, close to the principal streets, very
convenient.
Also, in the course of building, the Town Hall, which will be a fine,
noble, and substantial building, and will cost upwards of £20,000.
It is to have a marble front, which is brought twenty miles dis-
tance, also a high tower, to which is to be added a peal of bells, to
32


be called “ The Albert Peal,” the first and only peal in Adelaide.
These are supplied by voluntary contributions and subscriptions.
This is supposed to be one of the finest buildings in the colony.
There are several very fine banks, with freestone fronts, viz., the
Union Bank of South Australia, Bank of Australasia, the National
and Scotch Bank ; all these are situated near the centre and prin-
cipal part of the city.
Places of worship are numerous, as follows;—Church of England,
three; Scotch, three ; Wesleyan, two; Baptist chapels, four, one very
fine ; Independent, or congregational, ‘two, one of them very fine;
Roman Catholic, two, one of them a very large building; Bible
Christian, one, very fine and good building; Christian Disciples,
one, small, but neat; German chapels, two ; Primitive chapel, one,
fine building; New Society of Methodists, one. This will show that
here is no lack of religious instruction ; and I can assert that the
Sabbaths are more honoured with quietness than any town in
England; also the Houses of God are well attended with good
listeners, and the different sects show a kind feeling towards each
other. When there is a new chapel or church to be built, the
money is soon raised by subscription, and it is speedily released
from debt. Some person will give £SOO or £I,OOO. Some of the
churches and chapels have very good organs; but most have very
large harmoniums, and great attention is paid by the numerous
hearers ; also the choirs in most are very good, and deserve much
praise. The Sunday schools are numerous, and well filled with
children and good instructors; many enticements are offered to
them in the shape of innocent amusements, as tea parties, picnics in
the country, conveyances by omnibusses and cars, yearly presents,
&c. When any member of a church dies, it is pleasing to see the
respect shown by the attendance from the different churches and
sects; the union between them is much more than in England.
The cemetery is about half a mile from the city, with its different
burial grounds marked and nicely laid out. The dead are generally
conveyed in hearses, with mourning coaches following.
I neglected to state, there is one synagogue for the Jews, but
33


thinly attended, owing to not having a large number of Jewish
inhabitants.
As I have stated, the streets ran from north to south, and from
east to west; and those streets and terraces are one mile in length
each way, which makes the city stand at present on one square mile.
The streets are straight, and of good width; but some have only a
few buildings in them yet, and those are where no business is
transacted.
When the land is sold for building purposes, it fetches a good
price, especially near the business part of the city. I have known
some to be sold for £8 per foot. Many who purchased land in the
early times of the colony, have made large fortunes.
Household property pay a good interest, more than anything I
know. I also think it would be a good speculation for English
capitalists to have agents to purchase for them. Property often-
times pays from 10 to 20 per cent.
The Church of England Society bought a large piece of land at
the time of first forming the city, and built upon it; now they are
pulling them down and rebuilding much finer houses for shops in the
principal streets, which are some of the finest in the city; it both
adds to the appearance, and gives them a better profit, and more
credit is due to them (the Society); also they are let cheaper than
others, at 10 per cent., for their outlay, which is all they ask. The
Church of England Bishop superintends the business for the Society.
He is a very fine preacher, according to my idea, and a very useful
gentleman among the black natives. I must state he has laboured
more among them than any other religious body. The ministers of
the city have not much labour, no more than their church or chapel
to preach in, and a large house provided also for them; but the
bishop travels up the country a long distance among the black
natives, and teaches them to be civilized, and the Gospel news;
and, thank God, many of them, through his teaching, are becoming
very useful.
The city is becoming thickly inhabited at present, about twenty-
five thousand this year; the buildings are great many more than
last year, but the rent keeps high. I have lived myself in a two


story house of five rooms this last six years, at 13s. 6d. per week
Small houses of two rooms are let at 4s. to Gs. per week. Such
houses as mechanics would live in are let from Bs. to 10s. per week.
If buildings do not increase with the new emigrants, rents will
become very high; but lam thankful to see business so progressing
this year. The farmers’ productions are realizing good prices. In
fact, every business seems better this year than I have seen.it for
the last four years. The Americans have been supplying other
colonies with wheat and flour, which has been the means of keeping
the price of that commodity a little lower here, and prevented the
farmers in getting so good a price.
Last year, the price of wheat was from £lO to £l4 the ton all the
year round. This year, since harvest, when a rise took place, it rose
to £2O and £27 per ton, which made numbers of farmers look quite
smiling.
In Adelaide there are four steam-mills, one windmill, some steam
saw mills, and several large builders’ and carpenters’ shops. The
working hours are from six to six, one hour at each meal, and leave
off at four o’clock on Saturdays.
You will understand, by what I have said, that the colony is con-
siderably advanced in so few years. There are also four large squares
at different parts of the city; they are about two hundred yards
square, with shrubs and trees planted therein, with several seats for
the accommodation of the public, also about eight drinking fountains,
with many troughs always full with water, which is very convenient
both for man and beast.
ON THE NATIVE BLACKS.
There are a few of them in the city, their chief work is horse-break •
ing, in which they are very good, excellent riders, and very active.
In the month of April, many of them come down from different parts
of the north country. During their stay, they make “ worleys,” or
tents, with branches and leaves, much after the plan of the gipsies
in England, about two miles from the city. During the day they
35


are about the town; at night, none is seen but at their tents.
When the moon rises early they make a diversion among themselves
called “ corrobbery,” and to get money from the white people. It
consists of dancing together, singing, and shouting in their un-
civilized way; the noise can be heard for miles on a still night; they
oftentimes take all their clothes off, and paint their bodies, make
wreaths, with green leaves, for their heads and waists; some play on
two sticks, some sing, and others whistle. They seem to enjoy
themselves very much ; they also invite the inhabitants of the town
to come and see them, get money from them, and it is quite a farce.
Before they begin, their suppers are generally partaken of, which
consist chiefly of dead dogs, cats, and anything they pick up about
the town; the same is cooked with the hair and feathers on.
Persons who have visited them have often been asked to partake of
their meal; they also ask for pence, which are given to them plen-
ledusly; they would spend this money in strong drinks, but it is pro-
hibited to sell them any under a penalty of £lO. They are all very
fond of tobacco, both men and women. They all seem very loving
and kind to their children. They have a system of marrying by a
sort of pledge or bond made between them; they also exhibit great
attachment to their wives, but force upon them all the hard work, if
they can. When any man has cause of jealously, they will fight and
kill each other. This does not occur so much at present, for they
are becoming more civilized than they were, for a hundred miles in
the country; but more in the interior they are wilder, and, at times,
they will fall upon a shepherd and kill him. If caught, the law
puts them to death by hanging. During eight years, I have known
seven blacks condemned to be hung, which is a death they dislike
very much. I have been present and heard their trials; they have
an interpreter to explain every question put to them, and a
counsellor also for them; sometimes they are taken to the spot
where the murder was committed, to be executed in the presence of
their tribe.
Up the country, in the bush, the women wash for many families,
on account of not being able to obtain servants; and I believe they
wash very well, especially where they get good usage ; and if they


take a fancy to any person, they will do anything for them. Many
of their children go to school, and are taught by a Mr. and Mrs.
Taplin. Pew of them will remain some time, others will run away
when they see other blacks passing, and join with them.
The governor jhas taken some as servants ; but, after stopping a
short time, they will run away and return to their old habits again;
they are not very clever, but very cunning, and always thinking of
some scheme. Many of them will do anything for 6d. or a stick of
tobacco, particularly the women, and their husbands will allow them
to do it. They will not steal, being afraid of the gaol and confine-
ment, for it hurts them more so than the shortness of food. During
their stay, they are all clothed, but it is said, during summer time >
in the country, they all go about naked, except in winter. When
they are down from the country, many of them get sick by eating
so much fresh food. The reason of their coming every year, the
Government gave them a blanket each; in some instances, those
blankets are given them up the country to prevent them coming to
the city.
There are bush missionaries, who travel up the country for the
purpose of preaching to the different shepherds, and distribute to
them bibles, testaments, and religious tracts. They have often
come across the blacks, and have used all their means to convert
and civilize them; I think there is much to be done among them
if treated with kindness.
During their stay in the city, they come round the streets
asking for clothing, and anything they can get. Many give them
old cloaks, sometimes they get a crinoline, which they put on
outside of their clothes. Their manner and talk cause plenty of
fun. The women carry all their “ swag,” the men are too lazy.
Among them also are found some mulattoes; since the white men
are gone so far into the interior; they are very fond of being in the
company of white men. If the men are employed to cut wood,
and pay them first, they will cut a part, and say it makes their
arms ache.
I think the women are the ugliest females ever witnessed; but
the half-cast are much better looking, some very nice.
37


The race entirely are becoming very scarce ; they are dying
very fast of late years. Some of the men are very fine looking
fellows, with good strength. I think the food they get when in
town does not suit them so well as when they are in the country.
Soon after the Queen’s birthday, the 24th May, when they received
their blankets, they all left, as the governor will not allow them to
stop long.
During their stay'this year, 1864, on April 16th, I paid them a
visit to see their corrobbery. They had then just arrived from the
country (near the river Murray), which is situated about seventy
miles from Adelaide; the cause of their coming I have already
explained.
• About nine o’clock, I was at the “worley,” and asked them
“ What, corrobbery for Jack ? ” “ Yes, for a pit of fun, the same
when you got fiddle.” They commence when the moon is up and
bright; they take off nearly all their clothes, and dress themselves
in wreathes, &c., as I explained, turning to each other, dancing,
and shouting all the time, trying to keep time as a choir of singers.
One black boy had a fife ; I said to him, “ What for you got that
fife ? ” He told me, “ Mrs. Taplin gave me dat.” I asked him
also, “ Who taught you to play ‘ God save the Queen ’? ” He told
me “ Mrs. Taplin.” This lady, I explained, was the person who
had a school up the country, and taught them all to read, write,
and speak English. The boy surprised me in the manner he played
the fife ; some of the girls began to talk to me ; I said, “ Mary,
who taught you to speak English so well ? ” She told me, “ Mrs.
Taplin,” who keeps the native school supported by Government,
which is very beneficial and kind; also much credit is due to
Mrs. Taplin, for the manner in which she conducts it, and the good
done to the natives.
I felt delighted to find the older boys and girls so much advanced
in their learning, and to see the mothers so fond of their children.
1 said to one mother, Give me your pickaninny boy ? She said,
“ No.” I said, Little Jack, will you go with me ? He said, “ No.”
I stopped there until they nearly went to bed in their worley, which
is composed of bows and sticks, &c., to break off the wind. They


lay four and five together, and cover themselves with a few old rags
and blankets. This was on Saturday night. They told me to
come on Monday evening to see corrobbery. I said, I think I’ll
come to-morrow. They told me that it would be Sunday, and that
they never corrobberied on Sundays. I then asked, What for, Jim,
you do not on Sundays ? He told me, “ White fellow do not, and
we were taught at school not to do so.” I think the blacks are
much advanced in cultivation, and those that live near where many
inhabitants are, soon learn. I also think, if other religious bodies,
as dissenters, had laboured more among them, they would have
been benefited more. I must say, they have not done their duty
to them as the Bishop and the Church of England people have ; but
are more fond of staying at home in their large houses, and fine
churches and chapels to preach in, and a horse, which nearly all the
ministers have. I often think their life is much easier here than in
England.
I am persuaded in my own mind, that if a young man would
come out, learn their language, go among them, 'and preach to
them, many might be converted. This might be done with very
little expense, if all the places of worship would contribute to the
same ; and by selecting a suitable person for the work, much good
would be the result.
I always was of an opinion, that the Wesleyans, and other
bodies, sent missionaries to teach the way and plan of salvation to
these blacks, also to read them their Bibles and Gospel tidings;
but I am sorry to say, this is not done here. - My opinion of
the preachers here is, that they are above their work, except
one, Mr. John Wright, a travelling preacher. He offered
himself, but he is a married man, with a family; a single man
would be better, although, I think, he would be an excellent man
for it.
I hope the churches in England will soon take this into considera-
tion, and, with a few coHeotions, send one or two young men eut
with Mr. Wright, to labour among these poor natives, when a great
work could be done in a short tune.
Mr. Wright has been there many yeara, and is acquainted With


many of their ways, which would be of great assistance to them,
also to facilitate the work.
If the churches of England would make a collection once a year,
it would be sufficient to keep three men, and build a large school-
room.
I have stated, there is one Missionary Society that sends to the
shepherds, distributing Bibles and Testaments there; they are
allowed horse, cart, and a man with food.
If three men were to be sent, they ought to be provided with a
spring 'van, with a covering, to be drawn by two or three horses;
and the men could sleep in it at night: this, being provided and
made strong for the purpose in England, would not cost so much as
in South Australia. If such a thing should be made during my
stay in England, I could show and explain the size required.
I have written this at intervals, as it occupies most of my time
to work for a large family. My reason for writing this short
account of the country, and my experience, is, that many are
coming; and with the experience I have shown, I might be a little
guide to them.
VOYAGE FROM ADELAIDE TO ENGLAND.
I left Adelaide in a steamboat, called “ The Penola,” August 17,
but stayed in Melbourne six days; then I went on board the steam-
ship, called “ The Great Britain,” a fine large vessel. We had a
pleasant passage to Liverpool in sixty-one days. Captain Gray
was the commander, a very goqd captain, and exceedingly obliging
to passengers, four hundred and fifty in number; sailors and
officers about one hundred.
The climate was the extreme of heat and cold.
I saw very large icebergs for a week, supposed to be from two
hundred to three hundred feet out of the water.
During that time the passengers suffered much from cold. Many
had chilblains on their feet.
40


About fourteen days after that we crossed the line, which was
extremely hot, so much so that we could not sleep much in bed.
The ship brought a German band from Melbourne.
In fine weather we had a ball on deck, in the evenings, from
seven to ten o’clock.
Many of the passengers came from the gold diggings; some have
done well, and some just made a living; several of them proved to
be a very rough lot.
The captain posted up each day how many miles we travelled
in twenty-four hours, and the latitude and longitude.
All the passengers were quite glad to see land and to leave the
ship.
QUESTIONS BY FARMERS.
It so many of us, farmers, go to South Australia, what shall we do
with the produce of our farms ? or into what market shall we take
the same; for, since you have been in Adelaide, you have known
the price to have been very small ? The reason for its being much
dearer now, we presume, is, because the American ships have
brought but very little wheat and flour this year ?
ANSWERS TO FARMERS.
As the population in the colony keeps increasing, and emigration
does the same, that will take much more for them.
Emigration is still going on in other colonies; and they have
never grown sufficient of com for themselves, but have been
supplied by other countries.
I will give another answer. Much new country has been found
out, which is North Australia. A new settlement is forming near
the Indian Ocean, which will not be far from that country. There
will be a chance to supply that territory with many articles besides
horses and cattle.
41


If the north will be populated from different countries, which is
very probable, they will take away much of the farmers’ produce, as
that part is near the sun. The produce of the north will be
different to that of the south.
I am informed that it is good for growing sugar, rice, cotton,
coffee, tea, and such articles as the eastern parts of the world grow.
I doubt not but that the time will come when a railroad will cross
from south to north; and then I think South Australia will be the
best country for farmers in the world.
Several thousand pounds’ worth of land in the north was sold in
Adelaide in the former part of 1864; and much will be sold in
England when the plans will be made and known how to get it
populated in the quickest and best way.
At first, then, like all other new countries, it will be requisite to
build and make roads before farming; not only that I think that
will not suit for farming purposes, but I think the time will come
when steamers will run from England, yea, many of them, and the
passage will be only two months, which will induce many to send
wheat to England, if we have not a market here. I have known
many tons that have already been sent there. The passage will be
short, not much longer than from America ; and the two, south and
north combined, will be able to send much new produce to England
in exchange for merchandise.
I am confident that it will answer English capitalists to form
companies, for in due time it will pay.
Buy much land, make a railroad, sell that land in England (to
those that have a little capital and want to emigrate) in small
allotments. I doubt not but that those plans will be adopted soon, —
that the farmers need not despair of selling their produce, if
Englishmen (capitalists) would strive in these matters, that have
money lying idle. It would do the mother country good, as Well
as the southern part of Australia; and, likewise, do much good to
many that are waiting for a chance to emigrate here—those frugal
and useful men.
42


ADVICE TO LABOURERS NOT WANTED IN
ENGLAND.
The farmer there gets his work done very cheap, so that he makes
plenty of money; and the poor labourers have to suffer and end
their days in the Union. The farmer has them at his call, and
makes tools of them; by not employing these men, the rates fall on
the tradesmen.
Labourers, that are sick of the price you get for your labour, come
to South Australia; for you have as much right to sell your labour
here, as your masters have to sell their corn at the best market.
Be in earnest about it. No venture, no gain, you know. Now,
that you have been slave-driven for many years, and had not
sufficient to pay your bills, I promise you it is not so in South
Australia. It does not matter what you have been, if you try here,
you will, if you like, save money soon.
