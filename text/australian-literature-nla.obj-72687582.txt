MANNERS OF THE AGE.
AUSTRALIAN LITERATURE.
We have frequently been struck by remarking the rapid growth of our
colonial possessions, not only in a political, but in an intellectual and moral
point of view. To trace the progressive advancement of a colony, from its
first settlement in a rude and barbarous country, dependent on its parent
stem for all the comforts and for most of the necessaries of life, to the
period when it becomes a nation, guided by its own laws, and supplying
not only the necessities of its own people, but contributing, by its industry
and commerce, to the necessities and luxuries of other kingdoms, is full of
interest to the politician, the philosopher, and the moralist. Who that looks
on the northern portion of the great continent of America, and remembers
that scarcely two centuries have elapsed since its cities were mere loghouses
?its fertile and highly-cultivated plains covered with forests, ?and its now
populous states thinly scattered with the wigw r ams of the savage Aborigines,
but must perceive what a field for inquiry and observationsuch a country
displays.
Our attention was called to thissubject by perusing a file of the Australian,
a newspaper published at Sydney, in that rapidly improving colony, New
South Wales. It is now.scarcely thirty-eight years since the first settle-
ment was commenced by Governor Philip, and yet such has been the
march of improvement, that the colony contains a population of 50,000
white persons. It will be remembered, that it was long a reproach to the
Americans, by persons whose only merit consists in their being of gentle
birth, and in affluent circumstances, that they were a race of convicts. We
presume there will not be wanting persons who will speedily throw this
taunt at our Australasian brethren, who, we perceive, by these papers, are
anxious to have the free institutions of their native country introduced
among them. For ourselves, we regard this immense island as the future
queen of the Pacific, and we rejoice that so many persons of talent and of
commercial enterprize have been attracted to its shores as free settlers.
These persons carrying with them all their intelligence and activity, enter
on their various pursuits with all the advantages of a favourable climate,
and a fertile country; and the success which has attended their efforts has
been proportionate. Nothing satisfies us so much, that this rising colony
is in a highly prosperous condition, as the simple fact that its numerous
population are beginning to indulge in the pursuits of literature. While the
spirit of its agriculturists and commercial men is adding to its wealth,
there are not wanting philanthropists who are anxious to lay the best
foundation for its future security and permanent happiness, by cultivating
an intellectual taste, and encouraging the establishment of institutions,
which tend to advance knowledge and piety. We rejoice to observe
that its population, without our being compelled to make allowances
for the very defective materials of which the earlier proportion of it was
chiefly composed, has a high tone of moral and religious feeling. In con-
firmation of these remarks, we may add, that there are two newspapers
now published weekly, which have each a considerable circulation: and
we perceive in one of these, to which we have before referred, the best
proofs of the progress which we have noticed. Several advertisements ap-
pear which satisfy us that our Colonists are not inattentive to themoraland
religious w r ants of their fellow-subjects, nor to those of other countries ; we
select the following as examples, convinced that they will highly interest
our readers : �
66 The Archdeacon having caused the c Manual of Family Prayers,?
by the Right Rev. C. J. Blomfield, D.D. Bishop of Chester, to be re-printed
in this Colony for distribution, notifies that copies are to be had gratis on
application at the residence of the respective Chaplains.?


?AUXILIARY CHURCH MISSIONARY SOCIETY FOR
AUSTRALASIA.
The Quarterly Meeting of the Committee will be held at the House of
the Secretary, on Friday, October 28, at seven o?clock in the evening.
The Collector?s cards are requested to be transmitted with the amount
received.

?PUBLIC FREE GRAMMAR SCHOOL, IN THE TOWN OF
SYDNEY.
The Subscribers, in furtherance of the proposed plan for the establish-
ment of a Public Free Grammar School, in the town of Sydney, are
respectfully invited to meet at the house of Doctor Halloran, in Phillip-
street, to morrow, the 28th instant, at noon, for the purpose of adopting
the necessary arrangements for the carrying that desirable object into
effect.?
But there is one advertisement which appears to us to mark another
stage of improvement in this interesting part of the British dominions:?
? To be published the Ist of March, 1826.
?THE AUSTRALIAN QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.
By T. Parmeter, M.D. and a select number of Literary Gentlemen.
Fungar vice cotis, acutum
?Reddere quce ferrum valet , exsors ipsa secandi.
? I shall perform the office of a whetstone, which can make other things
sharp, though it is itself incapable of cutting.?
Most appeals made to the public are of solemn complexion, compounded
of pledges right pompous and drafts on the bank of wit and sense, that
never fail to be dishonored. Without making such brilliant promise?the
Editors in plain good terms beg leave to assure the community at large
that their capital is but small, and they do not mean to venture beyond it,
their stock in hand comprising a few sober hints and speculations on pota-
toes, bags of rice, cobs of corn, and bandicoots. Don?t be alarmed gentle
readers at this homely way of including commerce, agriculture, botany,
and natural history.
The time will come, about the year of our Lord, 1910, when your de-
scendants will have their evening and morning newspapers, and their
magazines in as multiplied a form and fashion as the mother country. But
hark, good folks, do not refuse to drink from earthenware ?the vessel will
be clean, and your thirst of knowledge shall be quenched, if not from the
Piserian stream, from the waters of your native mount, tipped with a
cerulean sky.
A good jockey looks forward ?the rider that keeps looking back will be.
distanced ?we are therefore determined to start fair, keep the course clear,
and win the race by pocketing your dollars for the trouble, ?pleasure we
meant to say, we shall take in amusing you all, with original intelligence
of your domestic concerns, your improvements in agriculture, your com-
mercial successes, your architectural taste, and your rise and progress
from an impervious wood to an open cultivated soil.
It is delightful to contemplate the progress of cultivation in this remote
part of the world ?to behold the handy works of man ?how the choicest
gifts of Providence have been discovered in this once trackless land! To
see the early march of a little band through barren woods and lofty mountains,
intersected by deep, broad, and serpentine rivers: to learn how rapidly
the loftiest trees were felled, roads cut open, and every species of grain
thrown into the ground, yielding abundant crops, and gratifying the first


tillers of this Australian land with prospects of peaceful homes, again
crowned with golden harvests.
Can any of us but with rapture view the wondrous change!
To behold in so short a space of time a little city, for in good truth many
there are of less magnitude in England, covering that spot were nought but
rocks and clustering trees of enormous height had before appeared?beau-
tiful buildings, both public and private, here and there intermingled with
the ? neatly cultivated garden;? and the surrounding scenery, the busy
hum of commerce, exhibited in every variety that can be serviceable to
the wants of man! Callous indeed must be that breast that does not glow
with ardour at the sight of such a metamorphosis, and base indeed must
be the soul that will not assist in the furtherance of an administration that
has already teemed with so many benefits to the residents of this rapidly
rising country. We have already entered the vestibule of civilization, let
us not retreat, but advance, step by step, till we shall have arrived at the
summit of man?s utmost ambition, of virtue, genius, and power. By adopt-
ing a periodical inquiry, registering every remarkable occurrence connected
with our political phenomenons, and publishing every moral improvement,
we shall ultimately attain a respectable rank among the nations of the
world.
This humble work will pourtray all that is interesting to the mother
country, for it shall be our boast that we are a British Colony : we shall
be like Carthage without its memorable decline, or more properly speaking,
we shall possess the vigour of regenerated Rome.
Whoever lives to see this Colony reach her fiftieth year may say she
bears a strong resemblance to her mother country.
? Son extreme resemblence avec sa mere le ltd fit reconnoitre,?
To our Australian fair we shall endeavour to make this work interesting:
we shall not blush to delineate all their gentler passions?or the sigh,
? A gentle girl breathes, when she tries to hide
The love, her eyes betray to all the world beside,?
And when all the ephemeral vanities of this troubled life shall close, we
hope then to seek that
? Retirement, rural quiet, friendship, books,
Ease and alternate labour, useful life,
Progressive virtue, and approving Heaven??
which nothing can equal, nothing can aggrandize.
The Author begs leave to inform the Public that he has appointed for
his agent Mr. Forster, at James Norton?s, Esq., but should not the sub-
scription amount to 200 he is requested to reserve and return the money
to the several owners, and the author must succumb to public opinion. If
the present attempt fails, the author does not despair that three or four
years growth may induce him to make a second essay.
The subscription of 1/. per annum to be given the agent, in order to en-
sure the security of a prompt publication.?
After perusing this announcement rte are persuaded that our readers will
augur favourably of the present condition of our Australasian Colonists.
We regard it as a pleasing instance of the state of Society among them,
that a work of this nature is proposed, and we believe that the expressed
opinion of its projector as to the state of the Colony in 1919, will be more
than realized.
We are not insensible to the influence of periodical literature?our own
efforts will corroborate this opinion, and we believe that this attempt to
establish a literary journal, will materially tend to advance the projector?s
anticipations.
To the Christian so rapid a progress in civilization and knowledge cannot
fail to offer important subjects for reflection. Situated in the centre of the


Pacific, surrounded by innumerable islands, the inhabitants of some of which
are just emerging from a savage stal�, and have abolished their idolatry, and
received the light of the Gospel?Australia may be regarded as the nucleus
of civilization and Christianity in the Pacific. When we contemplate her
present advance, in conjunction with the wonderful change effected in the
Society and the Sandwich Islands, by the efforts of Christian Missionaries,
we look forward at no distant period to the w hole of Australasia and Poly-
nesia, becoming as enlightened as the western world.
THE CHRISTIAN ADVOCATE.
THE PRESENT STATE OF COLONIAL REFORM.
iC Hope deferred maketh the heart sick; 1 ? and he who feels for the de-
gradation and misery of his fellow-creatures under the galling yoke of West
Indian slavery, must endure this sensation with peculiar aggravations. A
faintness comes over the spirit, as he reflects upon the melancholy fact that
800,000 beings of his own blood, subjects of the same sceptre, possessing all
the qualifications w T hich would render them happy in a state of civilization
and freedom, are retained by men calling themselves Christians, by men
bearing the name of Britons, and therefore lovers of liberty, in a state of
the most grievous and intolerable bondage. How distressing to humanity
is the consideration that another year has passed without any national act to
wipe away this reproach. It is but too evident that there is something in the
very nature of slavery which hardens the heart, and renders it callous to
the finer feelings of humanity. Individuals, when they enter the atmos-
phere wffiere this pestilence spreads its influence, seem speedily affected by
it, and cease to regard it as an evil of any great magnitude. The white
man considers his sable brother as a being of inferior rank, and imbibing the
prejudices and opinions of the privileged class among whom he associates,
ceases to view slavery as a crime, for familiarity with any evil, soon lessens
our sense of its enormity. This, we think, sufficiently accounts for the dis-
tressing fact, that Europeans, on going to the West Indies, frequently
change their opinions on the subject of slavery, and become imbued with
the sentiments of the planters, on the necessity for its existence. The ques-
tion is however, simply, a moral one, ?all expediency and necessity and
human authority is nugatory. By what right but that of force, and that
too, force of the most brutal character, does the West Indian slave-holder
claim a property in the blood of his fellow-creatures. We assert, then,
that if the original tenure by which he holds possession of them be founded
on injustice, fraud, and oppression, that the sooner the chains by which
they are encircled be broken, the better. Every year suffered by the peo-
ple of this country to elapse without removing this mill stain upon our
honour, as men and Christians, accumulates an additional mass of responsi-
bility of a fearful character. We are willing to believe that the efforts of
the abolitionists of Great Britain have aroused the natural sensibilities of
the heart, and have not appealed in vain to those principles of benevolence
and religion which animate a large proportion of our fellow countrymen.
We believe that the attention of the most influential sex has been awakened
to the consideration of this subject, and that many of those publications
which have circulated so widely have been written by females, who are
keenly alive to the wrongs, the unredressed wrongs of the natives of Africa.
This we regard as a cheering state of things, our children will, at least, be
imbued by their mothers with an abhorrence of this thraldom, and it may
be reserved for them to accomplish that, for which we may perhaps, toil
and labour in vain, ?the total abolition of the slave trade and the anni-
hilation of slavery.
Notwithstanding the unequivocal expression of public opinion, we find
that the slave colonies in general are unwilling to adopt any means, even
for the gradual abolition of such an evil as that of slavery. From
