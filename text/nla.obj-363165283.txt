SIR ROBERT WILLIAM DUFF, G.C.M.G.,
LATE GOVERNOR OF NEW SOUTH WALES.
JOOTSTEPS OF i^NGELS,”
Composed by Miss ELSIE GERRARD (Mrs. David Steele),
Words by LONGFELLOW,
Dedicated by special permission to LADY DUFF,
Will be sung by Miss ALICE ESTY, in the SYDNEY TOWN HALL,
ON TUESDAY, 30th APRIL, 1895,
With Grand Organ Obligato by M. WIEGAND
When the hours of Day are numbered,
And the voices of the Night
Wake the better soul, that slumbered,
To a holy, calm delight.
Ere the evening lamps are lighted,
And, like phantoms grim and tall
Shadows from the fitful fire-light
Dance upon the parlour wall.
Then the forms of the departed
Enter at the open door;
The beloved, the true-hearted,
Come to visit me once more.
He, the brave and strong, who cherished
Noble longings for the strife,
By the roadside fell and perished,
Weary with the march of Life.
Uttered not, yet comprehended
Is the spirit’s voiceless prayer,
Soft rebukes, in blessings ended,
Breathing from those lips of air.
Oh, though oft depressed and lonely,
All my fears are laid aside,
If I but remember only
Such as these have lived and died.
PENFOLD &. CO., SYDNEY,
