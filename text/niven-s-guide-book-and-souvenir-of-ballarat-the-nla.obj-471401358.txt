SOUVENIR OF BALLARAT;
THE “GARDEN CITY OF VICTORIA.”
Scarcely any one would imagine that thirty years ago a
dense forest of heavy timber covered the site now occupied
by the good city of Ballarat—or Ballaarat—a name given by
the aboriginal natives, signifying a “resting place” or
camping ground. At that time, a clear and limpid stream of
water, the Y arrowee Creek, fed by the perennial springs of
Mount Warrenheip, found its devious way through the level
p-assy flat, dotted here and there with the picturesque
ightwood tree and the fragrant wattle, giving shelter and
refreshment, not only to the blackfellow but also to the
>ame upon which he lived. In consequence of these natural
it was selected by the early settlers as a choice
•ite for a squatting homestead, and might have so
emained but for the discovery of gold in 1851, which at
mce attracted a large population of hardy pioneers, who
peedily set about forming a township, at first of canvas
ents, but which has long since developed into brick and
tone, and ranks as the Second City of Victoria, having a
lopulation of about 40,000, divided into three municipalities
-Ballarat East, Sebastopol, and the “City” proper the
fourth estate” being represented by three daily newss.
apers and a weekly.


The visitor who may arrive at the Western Railway
Station, in Lydiard Street, will find no difficulty in locating
himself, as the various hotels have a world-wide reputation,
both for comfort and economy. Amongst these may be
mentioned Craig’s Royal Hotel, Lydiard Street, patronised
by Royalty in the person of the Governor —Mr. G. Thompson,
Proprietor ; Lester’s Hotel, Sturt Street; The George Hotel,
Lydiard Street ; Brophy’s Hotel, Sturt Street ; Buck’s Head
Hotel, Bridge Street; Royal George Hotel, Lydiard Street;
Stork Hotel, Armstrong Street; Irwin’s Commercial Hotel,
opposite Railway Station; Sayle’s Edinburgh Castle Hotel,
Armstrong Street ; Adelphi Hotel, Sturt Street; Kirk s
Unicorn Hotel, Sturt Street; Bussell’s Hotel, Sturt and
Albert Streets; Antcliffe’s Club Hotel, Lydiard Street ;
Town Hall Hotel, Armstrong Street; Earl of Zetland Hotel,
Bridge Street, &c., &c., whose tariffs range from about
2s. 6d. per meal or bed down to 6d. per meal and Is. bed,
for further particulars regarding which we refer our readers
to the accompanying advertisements.
Sturt Street is the main artery, running east and west,
and is intersected at right angles by Lydiard Street, the
Post Office being at the north-east corner, with the Bank ol
Australasia and London Chartered Bank to the right and
left of the intersection, and the Burke and Wills Fountain
intervening, at the back of which is the Cab Stand, where
comfortable carryalls and ’buses may be had to all parts o.
the town and suburbs, at very reasonable fares, threepence
being the tariff for a three-mile ride by Wellington’s ’Buses
starting every half-hour, the journey extending from the
Orphan Asylum, in the Melbourne Road, Ballarat East, t(
Lake Wendouree, or in another direction round the Lake b
the Botanic Gardens.
By a reference to the accompanying map, it will be seei
that the gold deposits traverse almost the whole of Ballarat
These are shown in yellow color, and were formerly watei
courses or “gutters,” some of which lie at a depth of 400 o
500 feet from the present surface, and are covered wit
3r four layers of solid basaltic rock, each from 20 t
at thick, so that there is not much risk of subsidenc<
Street may be easily distinguished by its extra widt


of 198 feet, the centre being planted with oak and eucalyptus,
together with hardy shrubs, judiciously interspersed with
seats, the whole forming a refreshing shade, and a pleasant
relief to the eye, and giving rise to the well-earned title of
the “Garden City of Victoria,” bestowed by a celebrated
traveller who was by no means a green-hom.
The accompanying illustrations will perhaps give a better
idea of our street architecture than any written description,
suffice it to say that such palatial “shops” as Crawford’s,
Buick’s, Rogers’, or Smith’s, in the drapery line, are not to
be excelled any where. The City Hall, erected at a cost of
£25,980, occupies a frontage to Sturt Street of 153 feet; height
of tower, 135 feet, containing the Alfred Bells, whose praises
need not here be sounded, as they are well able to speak for
themselves when properly handled ; they cost over £IOOO.
Perhaps a visit to the balcony of the Clock Tower will give
the very best idea of the position and extent of our rising
town. From this height a good view is obtained in every
direction, and the engraved map will be more easily
understood.
The first thing which strikes the observer will be the
prim cleanliness of the city and the busy bustle of its
streets. Looking up Sturt Street to the right is Lester’s
Hotel, the ne plus ultra of commercial and other travellers,
and close at hand are Gibbings’ Livery Stables, in Doveton
Street; then comes a gap of plantations, caused by the
Church Reserves, St. Patrick’s Cathedral on the left, and
the Presbyterian Church on the right. The next building
which catches the eye is the Western Fire Brigade
Station, with its castellated tower, and two blocks furthea
on is the famous Ballarat District Hospital, founded in
1856, one of the most extensive and useful institutions in
ictoria, giving accommodation, gratis, to 150 in-patients,
tid medical advice and medicine to 600 out-patients per
r eek. It is justly considered a model of cleanliness and good
lanagement, and is peculiarly beneficial in a district where,
i addition to all the ills that flesh is heir to, mining accidents
re of necessity so frequent. This building, like most of the
ther public institutions, is surrounded by a splendid garden
E five acres, and is in every way worthy of inspection.


While on this subject it may be stated that, notwithstanding
the large accumulation in this Institution, of sickness and
suffering, from all parts of the country, Ballarat stands A I
as a healthy locality ; even seaside Geelong has a mortality of
IS'oO per 1000; Melbourne, 18'74 per 1000; and Sandhurst,
22'85 per 1000 ; while Ballarat, with its hospital, its asylums,
and its dangerous mines, is only 17 "08 per 1000; and in
Ballarat East, where the Hospital returns are not included,
the death rate is only 16 - 06 per 1000, being less than any
other part of the colony ; indeed, its elevation of 1437 feet
above the sea, its central position, and easy communication
by rail with the metropolis in four hours, and the seaside in
two hours, its invigorating climate, good drainage, and cheap
living render it a most desirable place of permanent residence
—an uncontrovertible fact which people of means are fast
finding out; and it may be mentioned that hundreds of
citizens who went home to the old country for the purpose
of settling down, after roaming over England, America, and
the Continent, have returned to take up their permanent
abode here, where all the advantages and comforts of
modern civilization are to be found—the universal verdict
being that ‘ * there is no place like Ballarat after all. ” A
little to the left of the Hospital, but further west, is visible
a large brick edifice, in the Elizabethian style ; this is the
Benevolent Asylum, with its surrounding gardens and
orchards. It is a most useful Institution, giving shelter to
240 inmates, mostly aged persons, incapacitated from work.
A little distance north of Sturt Street may be distinguished
the clear and glistening waters of Lake Wendouree, covering
an area of about 600 acres, the margin being tastefully laid
out and planted all round, a distance of nearly four miles.
Here may be seen flour mills, distilleries, tanneries, &c. together
with handsome villa residences, the Anglican Bishop’s Palace
to the north, and the Roman Catholic Palace and Nunnery to
the south. At the eastern end is a handsome Fountain and
Jetty, together with a number of private Boat Houses,
im which are kept a fleet of racing yachts, second to none in
,nies, regatta matches being sailed each Saturda;
non during the season. A selection may here be madi
Several hundred rowing and sailing boats, for fishing o:






pleasure. The Lake contains an unlimited supply of trout,
bream, carp, and perch, the latter sometimes reaching a length
of 17 or 18 inches, and weighing four or five pounds ; a fine
trout caught the other day measuring over two feet long,
and weighing 10 lbs. The Evening Post, of 15th November,
1880, says—“ Not by any means a bad day’s sport was ex-
perienced by an angler at Lake Wendouree yesterday, who
captured no less than five dozen trout, carp, and perch of
assorted sizes, and weighing in the aggregate 41 lbs. The
heaviest fish of the lot was a trout, which turned 1J lb. and
the time occupied in making this truly magnificent haul was
from 3.30 a.m. till 7,30 a.m. The bait used was crayfish
before daylight, and live minnow after sunrise.”
Entering one of the numerous and tastefully-fitted up
steam boats the voyage across is soon made (the distance
being a good mile) to the Botanic Gardens, 80 acres
in extent, where a pleasant hour or more may be spent
among gay parterres, shady grottos, and cool fountains.
The gardens also contain a small but choice collection of
zoological specimens, a magnificent avenue of Wellingtonia
Gigantia, a succession of ponds, devoted to pisciculture, where
some fine young trout may be seen, and last, but not least, an
acacia walk or “lover’s avenue,” a mile long, the whole
under the able supervision of Mr. Longley, the curator.
A reference to one of our illustrations may perhaps help
to convey some idea, where the description falls short, of the
really picturesque appearance of our beautiful Lake and its
surroundings.
A little beyond the Gardens may be seen the mining works and
powerful pumping plant of the City of Ballarat Company,
whose chequered career forms a good example of the costly
and difficult nature of mining, and illustrates the energy and
perseverance of Ballarat miners. This Company has been
working ten years in the present shaft, which has cost
£BO,OOO, during which time the three large pumps, measuring
respectively 18 in., 12 in., and 18 in. in diameter have lifted
night and day about 3000 gallons of water per minute, equal
to 135,000 tons per week, by means of steam engines of
500 h.p., supplied by five boilers, consuming 300 tons of
firewood per week, and are at length beginning to get gold.


which it is hoped will prove remunerative. It may here he
mentioned that the continuation of Sturt Street leads almost
due west, a distance of thirteen miles, to the shores of
Lake Burrumbeet, twenty miles in circumference, where
codfish, 40 lbs. weight, have been taken from its com-
paratively deep waters. A little to the north lies Lake
Learmonth, with its pleasant township, both Lakes being
favorite resorts for picnic parties, fishing, &c.
Having now travelled as far west as the eye can reach, let
us turn in another direction ; to the east lies Bridge Street
and the Main Road to Geelong. This part of the town
!s in the flat or hollow basin of the old alluvial mining,
where the Welcome Nugget, 2217 ozs., “Lady Hotham,”
1177 ozs., and numerous other lumps of gold were obtained.
The main street is narrow and more irregular, but a good
business is done in Bridge Street, especially on Saturday
night, when the crowds of people shopping make the
thoroughfare almost impassable, and is undoubtedly one of
the “ sights ” of Ballarat.
In Grenville Street, at the boundary line between th
East and West, is a large wooden structure, capable o
seating 3300 people, called the Alfred Hall, built conjoint!
by the two councils, in an incredibly short space of time
across the creek—one-half in each municipality, as a receptioi
hall on the occasion when H.R.H. the Duke of Edinburg]
honored Ballarat with his presence, and remains as a mementi
of that august but expensive visit. It is used for politica
meetings, balls, flower shows, lectures, &c., &c.
From Bridge Street up Bakery Hill opens out the broad
expanse of Victoria Street or Melbourne Road, three chaim
wide, planted with a double row of trees on either side, lined bj
pleasant gardens and tasteful private residences (broken her*
and there by quartz mining companies in full work), amongsl
which are some more pretentious edifices—the Roman Catholic
Church, Jewish Synagogue, and Orphan Asylum, in which
orphan children are clothed, fed,and educated, being also taughl
various trades, so as to render them fit to send out into the
world to earn their own living at the age of about fourteen years.
This admirable Institution is managed by a committee oi
gentlemen, Mr. Sadlier being the superintendent in charge.


On a commanding site in Barkly Street will be found the hand-
omeTown Hall, Offices,andwell-kept Gardensofthe Town
f Ballarat East, and close at hand stands the conspicuous brick
ower of the Ballarat Fire Brigade, which for twenty years
r more has given timely warning in cases of fire. Opposite
a this is the Ballarat East Free Library, a most useful
nstitution, containing 10,000 volumes of books, besides all
be current literature—open to the public free.
A short distance east of this will be found a historical
icality, the site of the Eureka Stockade, where, on the
lorning of the 3rd December, 1854, the insurgent diggers,
i arms against the oppression of the Victorian Government
f that day, were defeated by the Queen’s troops and police,
fter a short but determined resistance, a full account of
finch and of many other interesting early reminiscences
f the town may be obtained in Mr. Withers’ “History
f Ballarat.”
One of our views shows the old Black Hill, so called on
account of its sombre appearance, having been originally covered
with dense tall timber, about which the rain clouds were wont
) gather, but which is now a veritable white hill, from its being
lid open and almost carried away bodily for mining purposes,
.t its foot is the large crushing plant of the Black Hill
Company, with its 60 stamp heads. Here very extensive
and payable mining operations are carried on, both in the
hill and from deep shafts at its base, from one of which a
nugget of pure gold, weighing 308 ozs., was lately unearthed,
iides a regular weekly yield of some hundreds of ounces.
A very pleasant drive may be had out to Bungaree and the
Water Reserves, the denizens of which locality have been called
‘savages,” but will be found tobeverymild ones, unless whisky
s mentioned, and hereby hangs a tale. A certain ready-witted
dor, addressing a large audience in Ballarat East, when
ruling for Legislative honors, found even his stentorian voice
3wned by the yells of his opponents from the forest. It
ly well be imagined that the climax was reached when, in a
imcntary pause, he apostrophised his hearers as “Gentlemen
Ballarat ” and “Savages of Bungaree.” It is, perhaps, un-
cessary to add that he was not returned by the aforesaid
vages —and the name will certainly stick. But to resume,


the drive out to Brown Hill may be accomplished for three
pence, and then a walk of a mile and a half brings yoi
to the Gong Gong Reservoir, a miniature sea, high u
amongst the ranges, and having a succession of other wate
lodgments higher still—Kirk’s Dam, Pincott’s, Beale’s, &c.
containing 633,000,000 gallons, connected by a perennia
stream, as clear as crystal, coming down from Moun
Warrenheip ; this forms the water supply of Ballarat, and i
conducted into the town by 12 and 18-inch mains. Th
whole of the reserves are planted with a large variety c
shrubs and trees, and in the summer months their shady walk
are the resort of picnic parties innumerable, fern gatherers
&c. The soil of Bungaree is perhaps the most fertile in tb
whole of Australia; a farm of 80 acres is considered
fortune, and is eagerly sought after. At the foot of Moui
Warrenheip, which is 2,463 feet above sea level, will 1
found an extensive distillery (where excellent whisky
made), and several breweries, &c.
About seven miles further on are situated the Lai L<
Falls, whose picturesque cascades may be easily reached b
rail, and a half-hour’s walk through a sandy country aboum
ing with game. Not far from this is the Moorabool hall
the Lignite Mines, and the Lai Lai Iron Smelting Works.
Amongst the many parks, recreation and cricket reserve
sprinkled through the town, the Eastern Oval stands firs
being the oldest and best kept. Here will be found a wick
pronounced by the All-England Eleven as perfection ; also,
bowling green, like a velvet pile carpet; fish ponds, shac
trees ; and a “pub,” where a cool glass of Leggo and Sor
sparkling ale may be imbibed, the same being judicious
taxed by Mr. Berry, the whilom friend of the working man
Turning again to Lydiard Street, in which stands tl
Railway Station (before alluded to) the Bank of Victori
the Bank of Australasia, the Bank of New South Wales, tl
Commercial Bank, the Union Bank, the London Charter*
Bank, the National Bank, the Colonial Bank, Savings’ Ban
also the Ballarat Banking Company and the Land Mortgai
Bank, the General Post Office, Telegraph, and Treasur
Craig’s Hotel, and the Academy of Music, built by W.
Clarke, Esq., at a cost of £15,000, one of the handsome


leatres in Victoria, capable of seating 1700 persons ; the
School of Mines, under the superintendence of Mr. W. H.
Barnard, F.G.S., where will be found an extensive laboratory
and assay works, under the management of Mr. Flude,
together with a small but very choice mineralogical museum,
open free, and where scientific lecturers hold classes and
examinations in practical mining, engineering, surveying,
telegraphy, chemistry, &c. Hard by is the Wesleyan Church
and School House, Christ Church (the Anglican Pro-Cathedral)
under Bishop Thornton, D.D. Passing by the substantial Jail
[the interior of which for obvious reasons we are unable to
describe), brings us into Skipton Street, or the road to
Sebastopol, where hundreds of poppet heads and the constant
din of quartz crushing stampers makes us aware that mining
is being actively carried on, and thousands of ounces of
gold obtained per week. To select one as a very good
sample, let us turn off and visit the oldest, the far-famed
Band and Albion Consols. Here on the banks of the
farrowee Creek will be found their No. 7 shaft, 380 feet
leep, at which is erected one of the most substantial and
ift'ective crushing plants in the colony, consisting of sixty
tamp heads, driven by seven large steam engines, together
dth all the latest improvements in gold-saving apparatus,
melting furnaces, &c., costing upwards of £lO,OOO. The
ield of gold during twenty years has been 589,000 ozs.,
forth £2,358,000, and dividends paid, £965,726 15s. An
xcellent photograph of these works and of the machinery
louse, suitable for framing, may be had at a moderate price
rom F. W. Niven, Lithographer, 34 Sturt Street. Although
ioth quartz and alluvial mining are extensively carried on
n this neighbourhood, it is not the only industry here repre-
ented, for at a bend of the creek, called “Sunny Corner,”
re situated the extensive Ballarat Woollen Mills, cele-
>rated for the manufacture of shawls, tweeds, blankets, &c.,
tving employment to 100 hands. An inspection of their
lowerful machinery and appliances will form an agreeable
ontrast to the deafening noise of the quartz stampers, with
diich the road to Sebastopol is lined.
The Borough of Sebastopol was almost deserted a few
irs ago, but is now fast resuming its former busy aspect,


on account of the revival of mining industry, which
apparent all along the road as far as the “ Ancient Village
of Buninyong, so called because it was a village befor
Ballarat could boast of a hut. The scenery about here :
very beautiful, and the gardens are simply magnificent, c
account of the richness of the volcanic soil. Mount Bunii
yong is 2,448 feet above the sea level; and from the summii
which may be reached in an hour or so, a grand panorama (
the southern and western district almost down to the se
may be enjoyed. A very curious volcanic crater is also to b
seen on its eastern slope. The drive back to Ballarat,
distance of seven miles, will be found both agreeable an
cheap—fare, one shilling.
About a mile and a half up Lydiard Street north will 1;
found the New Cemetery, a quiet shady place adapted b
nature to the purpose for which it is used; the Old Cemeter
being more to the west near the Lake, where also is situate,
the Agricultural Society’s Show Yards, in which ar
displayed, on show days, some of the very finest samples o
pure merino sheep, &c. to be found in the world, prizes t
the value of over £lOOO being competed for, and as man;
as 10,000 people being assembled to view them. One of th
peculiarities of the landscape, as seen from the City Tower, i
the numerous Bald Hills to the north-west of the town
These, as their generic name implies, are rounded hill
of volcanic origin without any trees, and covered with ri«
chocolate soil, highly prized by the farmers. At the fo.
of one of the largest, Mount Pisgah, is the Ballar;
Racecourse, on the outskirts of Dowling Forest, tl
favorite resort of racing men and picnickers.
The extensive gold mines of Ores wick, twelve miles In
rail, are well worth a visit, a large amount of gold beiiq
here obtained. A smart walk of four miles from the
Creswick Railway Station brings you to the top of Spring
Hill, the view from which is truly magnificent—on the righf
lies one of the finest stretches of agricultural country the
eye could wish to gaze upon, and to the left is mapped ouf
the long line of alluvial gutters or leads, dotted here and
there with mining plants, representing an outlay of £40,000
or £50,000 each ; this goldfielel is only in its infancy.


Perhaps one of the most important and novel sights of
the town is the “ Corner,” in Sturt Street, where mining
shares are bought or sold, but seldom exchanged ; the Mining
Exchange is hard by, and the brokers, to the number of several
lundreds, push their business out into the street, so that if
r ou deal there you can scarcely be said to be taken in. Vast
ums of money change hands daily, £50,000 in “a single line”
teing looked upon as an ordinary transaction. A little below
his will be found the Mechanics’ Institute, Mr. W. H.
•atten, Secretary. It is a model of good order and usefulness,
'hose extensive book shelves arc loaded with literary
■ensures, to the study of which many a Ballarat man owes
i advancement in life, and many a young lady a husband,
we may judge by the assiduity with which bundles of
oks are carried backwards and forwards in neat little
Hither straps, for no one supposes for a moment that they
euil all they carry, or else it must materially interfere with
lusting and darning at home.
In connection with the Mechanics’ Institute there is a
arge Lecture Hall, where all kinds of theatrical, operatic,
ind terpsichorcan performances take place, and are largely
ittended, mostly by people who would not enter a theatre,
mro and simple, for the world ! Opposite this is the City
i'ree Library, at present located in a temporary bluestone
milding, where the working man, or the bank clerk, may
in joy a read gratis.
Speaking of the working man reminds us that we have
sft some of the most important manufacturing institutions
a the last, for in addition to the woollen mills before
xentioned, there is the extensive cordial factory of E.
Lowlands, in Dana Street, celebrated all over the colony for
lie purity of its ajrated waters ; the biscuit and lolly factory
James Long, in Victoria Street, where honied sweetness
s the air; the gasworks, in Grenville Street, whose tall
limney forms a striking object, and where the perfection
order and good management may be seen—W. H. Figgis,
icrctary, and S. E. Figgis, Engineer ; there are also several
:tensive boot factories, tanneries, potteries, flock mills, soap
id candle works, ham and bacon curers, &c., &c. ; also,
ilf-a-dozen foundries, fitted with every modern appliance in


machinery, where locomotive engines, tenders, and carriage
are manufactured for the Victorian Railways, &c.; singl
contracts, to the tune of £IOO,OOO in value, being by n
means uncommon ; and the huge steam lorry of the Phoeni
Company, vomiting fire and smoke as it conveys th
ponderous engines to the railway station, is a familiar sigh
in our streets.
And now to epitomise. This up-country town is les
than thirty years old, and extends north and south abot
five miles in a direct line, east and west about four-anc
a-half miles, being one continuous line of buildings, coverin
9500 acres, containing 90 miles of made streets, 10,00
residences, 56 churches, 500 hotels, and 20 state school!
with from 300 to 1000 scholars in each, besides college
and private educational establishments of a high ordei
Underground are 90 miles of water pipes and 60 miles e
gas pipes, to say nothing of gold mines, where horses ar
kept who never see the light of day, and where the preciou
metal is still being obtained to increase the world’s treasure
and add to the well-established prosperity of Ballarat, th
“ Golden Centre of the Sunny South.”
