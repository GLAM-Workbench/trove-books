NORTH

SOUTH
1945:


FOREWORD
Very infrequently, in the Royal Navy, does a ship
cross the line with only 69 of a ship's company of
over 600 who were Freemen, but this actually did
occur in “Deer Sound," and the opportunity of
initiating these landlubbers into the mysteries of the
sea, although a formidable enterprise, seemed too
tempting to be ignored. Admittedly it was War time,
and the Service demands that constant Watch be kept,
but for one day who could disapprove if the daily
routine Was relaxed and the time-honoured custom
performed? That this decision was justified and that
the ceremony Was a complete success is undoubted.
It is therefore at the request of many officers and
men that this small brochure has been compiled, to
serve as a permanent account of an enjoyable and
certainly a most interesting experience.
Under the existing conditions, it Was at first doubtful
if any ceremony could take place and arrangements
could only be made at the last moment. Notwith-
standing, the organisation was noted for its complete-
ness, originality and smoothness of execution.
It would be impossible to name all those who, by
their energies and co-operation, contributed to the
success of the ceremony, but of these Mr. Walts,
W. 5.0., R.N., must surely take precedence. Many
others, especially the A.E.O.'s and Shipwrights'
Departments, ably assisted, for without their help the
ceremony must have fallen far short of the high level
attained.
So, in spile of all restrictions, and trusting in her
famous motto, “Virluti non armis fido," “Deer
Sound" carried out the ancient laws of the sea.
L.R.R.


THE CEREMONY OF CROSSING THE LINE AS CARRIED OUT ON BOARD
H.M.S. "DEER SOUND” ON THE 7th FEBRUARY, 1945.
THE origin of the Crossing of the Line Ceremony
is somewhat obscure—but it has been the prac-
tice of Seamen, and especially British Seamen, to
observe these rites for some hundreds of years. The
ceremony probably dates back to the Vikings, who
carried out some form of ritual before arriving at
Gibraltar and always before crossing the 30 deg. of
latitude. In that time the Equator as such was
hardly known, and it was a legend that the Earth
was encircled by a serpent. In order to propitiate
this reptile certain rites had to be observed. The
combination of these rites and those of the old Vikings
appear to have resulted in the present and modern
form of “Crossing the Line.”
The ceremony has now become recognised, and is
one of the many functions all of which go to make
the numerous laws of the sea. To the professional
sailor these laws are very real, and their non-observ-
ance or treatment in an offhand manner may bing
bad luck to his ship.
It was, with full regard to these superstitions, and
with a real sense of their responsibilities that the Free-
men of “DEER SOUND” carried out their very


difficult and onerous duties in initiating some 300
Novices in the Mysteries of the Sea.
To the great gratification of the Freemen the
following signal from His Majesty was received at
0900 on 6th February:—
To : The Commanding Officer,
His Britannic Majesty’s Ship of War
"DEER SOUND."
From: The Equator W/T Station.
It is reported by my amphibian scouts that
H.M.S. "DEER SOUND" intends to enter His
Maritime Majesty King Neptune’s domain. Please
confirm this, in order that my chamberlains may
prepare to receive you. His Maritime Majesty
The King commands that all his loyal subjects in
"DEER SOUND" will take the necessary steps
to receive him. Our bears are plentiful and
hungry.
Clerk of the Rolls.
The following reply was immediately sent:
Please convey to their Majesties humble duty
of all friends on board. "DEER SOUND"
expects to enter Royal domain on sixth day of
February. Bear food rich and plentiful.
9999 Johnson.
Later that day, equatorial seagulls hovering over-
head dropped the following on the Officer of the
Watch (the bridge awning stations having col-
lapsed) :


Their Majestys.


Whereas we have been informed of the projected
visit of His Majesty’s Ship “DEER SOUND’’ to
our domain, and whereas, after diligent search, the
superscriptions of divers members of the crew of that
ship have not been found within our archives. You
are hereby summoned to furnish me, upon arrival in
our domain, with a full and complete list of the afore-
said superscriptions in order that we may confer upon
them the Freedom of the Seas’’ and our permission
to enter the other hemisphere.
Dated this forty-fourth day of Octopus, at the
hour of 0000 F.F.T. (Flying Fish Time) 774943
Anno Piscis.
(Signed) Barnacle Bill,
Lord Chief Justice.
Great consternation was caused in the Master-At-
Arms mess when a Flying Fish touched down bearing
die following:
A SUMMONS TO ALL LANDLUBBERS
43th Day of Octopus,
0001 F.F.T. (Flying Fish Time),
774945 Anno Piscis,
Neptune, by Grace of Mythology, Lord of all
the Waters, Sovereign of all the Oceans, Governor
and Lord High Admiral of the Bath etc., etc., etc.
Whereas it has pleased us to convene a court to
be holden on board His Britannic Majesty’s Ship
DEER SOUND ’ on the after well deck thereof


at the hour of 0930 on the 7th day of February,
One Thousand Nine Hundred and Forty-five.
By these Presents we summon you to appear at
the said court to tender us the usual homage, and to
be initiated into the mystic rites according to the
ancient usages of our Kingdom.
Herefore nor you, nor any of you may fail, as
you will answer at your peril and to the delight of
our trusty bodyguard.
Given at our Court on the Equator this 6th day
of February in the year One Thousand Nine Hundred
and Forty-five of our Watery Reign.
NEPTUNUS REX MARIS.
And orders of investiture which he was charged to
deliver (specimen below) :
NOTICE OF INVESTITURE
WHEREAS by your good sea records and hon-
ourable calling you are hereby summoned to attend
the Ancient and Honourable Ceremony of Investiture
that will raise you to the high degree of ORDER
OF GRAMPUS.
The holding of such Royal and Ancient Charter
will render you inviolate from attacks of Swordfish,
Walrus and Barracuda, or even adamant against the
more deadly and potent wiles of Mermaids, Nymphs,
or other alluring immortals.
Be it known to all mortals you are possessed of
this degree.


The greatest honour conferred upon a follower of
the Sea.
DAVY JONES, NEPTUNE,
Clerk of the Rolls. Rex Maris.
The summons, having been perused by the Cap-
tain, was then placed in the Recreation Space,
afterwards being exhibited in the Wardroom to the
noticeable discomfiture of certain landlubbers in our
midst. The Line was actually crossed at 0400 in
longitude . . . (censored), but, being pitch dark at
the time, it was quite invisible. His Majesty, accom-
panied by Queen Amphitrite and the Court having
the comfort and well-being of his subjects always at
heart, boarded “DEER SOUND” at 0930 on the
7th February, 1943, and, fortified by a hearty break-
fast addressed the Captain thus;
NEPTUNE ;
"Ship ahoy! What ship— at least if ship it be.
What strange projections o’er the side I see?
Can it be you are now on pleasure bound?
This lack of guns to me seems damned unsound.
Ship ahoy! What ship—where from and wither for ?
Ye are now in rny domain and far from Britain’s
shore.
Captain, you have candidates who cannot heave the
lead;
Do not know the Deep Sea lore or how a Mermaid’s
fed."


A Loyal Subject


CAPTAIN :
“His Britannic Majesty’s Ship “DEER SOUND”
From Colombo to Sydney.”
NEPTUNE :
“Avast there! a strange ship I see,
It’s quite a brand new class to me.
I think that from its rotund line
It may have pups at almost any time.
Her Captain I have met before,
Some years ago, I think, a score.
He then appeared before me as a callow boy.
Fo see him with four rings gives me pride and joy.
My Court and Bears will now proceed and carry
through
The initiation of all and sundry of your crew.
Of those who go down to the sea in ships,
Not the novice who takes short sea trips.
So that, when duly initiated in the mystery as seamen,
They may become our loyal, great and worthy
Freemen.
I he homage that to me is my just due
Must be paid by all except the few.
Fo those to whom this honour is conferred
I give the bond of Neptune and my word.
CAPTAIN :
“Your Majesty’s distinguished speech
Has charmed the ears of all and each.
So while, not wishing to complain


Expectation


Of anything in your domain
Or spoiling the Atlantic’s jest
By asking for a moment’s rest.
A lot of us would like to sec
How really flat the sea can be.
So earn our lasting gratitude
By smoothing the South Latitude.
And now, sir, pray proceed aright.
My compliments to Amphitrite.”
NEPTUNE :
“Very Good. Very Good.”
Neptune now received a statement from the Clerk
of Rolls showing list of Freemen and Landlubbers.
The Clerk of Rolls addressed the Captain thus:
“By inspection of the records of your crew
I find there arc some several hundreds who
Have never earned the Freedom of the Sea,
A most distressing state you must agree.
Reports have reached us that the slightest swell
Have caused these landlubbers to feel unwell.
Such ill behaviour we shall shortly try
And do our very best to rectify.”
The Captain and all available hands assembled on
the afterwell deck, which had been suitably prepared
for His Majesty’s reception, and the full Court with
all its pomp and dignity moved aft in procession in
the following order:
Heralds (bearing orders).
Chief of Police and Policemen.


Keeper of the Purse and Slave,
Chief Bear and Official Taster.
Neptune and Amphitrite (in chariot drawn by
8 bears).
Ladies in Waiting.
Lord Chief Justice and Lord Chamberlain.
Clerk of Rolls and Assistant Clerk of Rolls.
Court Physicians.
Barbers.
The magnificent Royal Chariots were halted and
greeted by a fanfare of trumpets. Their Majesties
mounted the tastefully decorated dais and were duly
enthroned.
(A description of the structure on which the pro-
ceedings of the Court were carried out will not be
out of place here. On the right was the Operating
Fable in charge of the Court Physicians, suitably
attired and prepared to carry out any major operation
—a supply of pills, spare hearts, ribs, etc., being
readily at hand. At the rear was Their Majesties
seated on two simple but regal thrones. Their per-
sonal retinue was in attendance including, in addition
to the Maids of Honour, the Keeper of the Purse and
his Slave. The Maids of Honour with their golden
curls and fresh complexions were typical of the inno-
cent beauty of His Majesty’s domain. The right of
the dais was occupied by the Clerk of the Rolls and
his Assistant, all in their appropriate robes. Order


was maintained on the platform by the Chief of
Police, looking like a tea planter out of season.
King Neptune was arrayed in a pale blue robe
with the red sash of the Bath, and the Order of
Octopus, surmounted by the State Crown and carry-
ing a Trident. By his side, a vision of breathtaking
loveliness, was Queen Amphitrite in a scanty chiffon
neglige which revealed to the full her beautifully
moulded figure, the cynosure of all eyes; a delicate
blush showed that she was pregnant with excitement
at the stirring scene.)
Neptune then expressed a desire to hold an inves-
titure, and the ceremony was carried out forthwith.
The procedure for presentation was the same in
each case. The Clerk of the Rolls announced the
name of the order to be presented together with that
of the recipient. King Neptune repeated the follow-
ing words at each investitute:—
“ I his order wear whenever you
1 o my domain do come in view,
Or else with all due state and unction
I must perforce repeat this function.”
The privileged subjects received their respective
dignities on bended knee and duly made obeisance to
the throne. Some consternation was caused by the
ab sence of Lieutenant Ford, R.N.R., our worthy
navigator, who failed to appear, and offered as an
excuse that he was endeavouring to ascertain the posi-


A delicate operation.


tion of the ship— a quite unnecessary proceeding as
this is promulgated every night by the C. in C.
The investiture concluded, King Neptune made
this speech prior to the initiation ceremony:—
“We hereby declare this Royal Court be open
To try to evade us is strictly ‘verboten,’
Our old laws are sacred and so must remain
To everyone entering our domain.’’
Followed by the LORD CHIEF JUSTICE:—
“As Lord Chief Justice of this Court
Both novice and freeman will get support.
My sentences will all be fair
Everything just, above-board and square,
But should landlubber stoop so low
To evade his sentence or go
To measure base, then I shall show
The justice that shall fit his crime,
A sudden plunge into the brine.
So now give heed to our good King
And business will go with a swing.’’
Then His Majesty, rising from the throne and
pointing to the bath, addressed the Official Taster,
“Has the brine of these deeps been tasted today?”
OFFICIAL TASTER: “No, Your Majesty.”
NEPTUNE : “Then have it done immediately.”
(All the Bears took to the Water).
OFFICIAL TASTER: “Before I taste of these
brines, Your Majesty, may I crave the use of
the Royal Vinolia?”
NEPTUNE: “With pleasure.”


A member of an underground movement.


The Official Taster took his seat and was lathered,
shaved and tipped into the bath, to be courteously
received by the Bears, who saw to it that he had
plenty of opportunity to taste the waters.
When at last he broke surface he addressed the
Royal Personage: Your Majesty’s orders have
been obeyed. I have tasted the Waters.”
NEPTUNE: “And what do you find?”
OFFICIAL TASTER: ‘‘l find them as they
should be.”
NEPTUNE: ‘Then I declare this Court open,
and let the ceremony commence.”
1 he initiation opened with a warrant being issued
against Captain R. H. Johnson, D.S.C., R.N., which
was read by the Lord Chamberlain in the following
words:—
YOU ARE BROUGHT BEFORE THIS
COURT AND CHARGED WITH IN-
DECENT HASTE. THEREBY DEPRIVING
LOYAL SUBJECTS OF THE FRUITS OF
THEIR LIQUORS, THAT IS, ENJOYING
THE PLEASURE OF AMOROUS MER-
MAIDS; ALSO WHILE RISING TO YOUR
EXALTED POSITION FAILING TO VISIT
US.”
DAVY JONES, NEPTUNE,
Clerk of the Rolls. Rex Maris.
The Lord Chief Justice pronounced the following
punishment:—Two pills, hair-cut and shave and to


be ducked twice, this being considered by all a very
light sentence for such peculiar behaviour. The Court
Photographer, during the carrying out of the sentence,
took numeous photographs as a permanent record of
(he just punishment meted out to this malefactor.
Facing the Royal Personages, but at a discreet
distance away at the edge of the platform, the novices
were in turn placed on two pivoted chairs. Here the
Court Barbers lathered and shaved their victims be-
foe tilting the unsuspecting minions into the bath for
the fondling caresses of the awaiting Bears. The
speed and efficiency of this proceeding was most com-
mendable. Sometime resistance was offered, but the
well organised police were always at hand to proffer
their assistance, and needless to say the unruly merited
the severe punishment that was immediatly adminis-
tered.
On mounting the platform, the novices first passed
the Court Scribes, who registered their names. Next
they were entrusted to the Court Physicians to test
their fitness to undergo the somewhat strenuous ordeal
before them. Elaborate thermometers of a most sen-
sitive order were in use, and with the careful adminis-
tration of pills, the novices—if still surviving—were
handed over to the Barbers. Seated in the chairs, a
lather of delightful messes followed by a shave with
a magnificent Court Razor demanded the novice’s
full attention, after which, the very unsuspecting be-
ings were, without warning tipped over backwards to
suffer the tender embraces of the hungry bears.


On his arrival on board and subsequently at frequent
intervals His Majesty expressed his pleasure and delight
at meeting once again that small but select band of free-
men in “DEER SOUND.” It was obvious, how-
ever, that His Majesty was displeased and somewhat
suspicious at his Consorts scintillating eyes and the coy
winsome glances she bestowed on both Freemen and
Novices alike. This may have led to the remarks
passed by some Rabelaisian-minded individual, who
said:—“Amphitrite, she should be called Anthracite,
she looks hot stuff to me.”
This miscreant was duly traced by the Royal
Sleuth Hounds, and heavily punished.
Here a word to the skill and proficiency of the
Court Physicians be mentioned, as, throughout
the whole proceedings, only one liny untoward inci-
dent occurred; this being when an offender was almost
decapitated. Since “Up Spirits” had been sounded
this near miss was readily understandable.
At eleven thirsty, Queen Amphitrite was heard to
remark, in clear bell-like tones, that she was checker
with watching novices imbibe quantities of salt water,
so how about His Majesty escorting her to the Bar.
His Majesty announced that he was entirely in agree-
ment, and also wished to set tooth to garbage (as
provided by Commander (S). He thereupon ad-
journed the count until 1 330.
The Court duly re-assembled and much to the re-


A general view of the proceedings.


maining novices’ chagrin and consternation it was
noticed that a number of lean and hungry bears had
appeared, some of their predecessors having become
slothful and lethargic through over-indulgence. Re-
sistance of a sustained character was offered by various
novices, but the efficiency and long experience of the
Deep Sea Police in dealing with malcontents was
equal to each and every occasion. In a few cases the
strait-jacket was necessary to coax the victim to the
top of the platform. The Chief of Police and his
Force was highly commended by His Majesty for
executing his orders so proficiently.
A deep growl came from the bears and His
Majesty rose m wrath when one offender was charged
that he did, among other heinous offences, refer to our
Solemn Court as “entertainment,” and to the heavy
sentences pronounced by the Lord Chief Justice His
Majesty ordered the culprit to have his brains removed
and a more suitable set inserted. It was observed that
large quantities of blood were shed during this delicate
operation, and to the stupefaction of the Court Physi-
cians, the criminal surfaced with ultramarine-coloured
ears, a most unlocked for result.
Anothci unspeakable scoundrel of the gigolo type
was charged with casting licencious glances at Amphi-
trile. His Majesty immediately demanded certain
measures, and it was only after remonstrations from
the Queen that the Judge tempered justice with mercy.


A very long list of novices still remained to be dealt
with and no time was lost in appeasing His Maritime
Majesty’s righteous anger at the presence of so many
—never before has so much been done to so many by
so few. It was with a sigh of relief from the Bears
that the Clerk of Rolls reported, “Your Majesty, no
novices remain.”
His Majesty then expressed a desire to taste the
waters personally, and having been ceremoniously
lathered and shaved by his own personal barbers, shot
into the Bath as though jet-propelled, and clasping
Amphitrite to his bosom disappeared beneath the
surface of the waters, followed by his whole court.
To end a perfect day, the only known recording of
His Majesty’s voice broadcast over the S.R.E. in
which King Neptune bade adieu to his new subjects
in “DEER SOUND” in the following words:—
“Hark: all ye infants enrolled as my Freemen,
Before I return to my wreck-covered shores,
See you stand by the kinship of all worthy seamen.
And hold fast to the faith of the sea and its laws.”
The following messages were received that night
and bear testimony to Their Majesties’ visit, and to
our having crossed the Line in Longitude . . . .
(Censored).
FROM :—Equatorial Headquarters,
“On behalf of Queen Amphitrite, Myself and
Court, I desire to thank you, Captain Johnson


Royal Navy, for the general facilities you gave us,
and the detailed efforts made on our behalf to
make our visit such a memorably happy and en-
joyable one.
“I also congratulate you on being in command of
such a very fine ship, manned by an equally fine
crew.”
FROM :— Equatorial Headquarters,
“In connection with my visit on the 7th February,
1943, I desire on behalf of Queen Amphitritc.
myself and the Court, to thank the Officers and
Ship's Company of His Britannic Majesty’s ship
“DEER SOUND" for being such perfect hosts,
and in turn becoming equally charming and sports-
manlike guests during the initiation ceremony, when
over 500 of their long shoremen were made Noble
and Worthy Sons of the Sea."
