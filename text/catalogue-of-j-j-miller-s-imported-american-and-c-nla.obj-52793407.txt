AUCTIONEERS’ NOTICE.
The Auctioneers have much pleasure in calling special
attention to Mr. Miller’s Sale, as they can, from their own
knowledge, state that no better Trotting Stud has ever been
offered for Public Sale in Australia.
The Proprietor, at a very heavy expense, travelled all
through America to secure the best trotting blood to be obtained
for money. In securing Contractor which Sire he pur-
chased in Kentucky, he procured one of the best horses ever
bred in the States; a reference to his pedigree will prove
this.
When Honesty came to Victoria and gained the Cham-
pion Trotting Prize of £,500, Mr. Miller could not rest satisfied
until he, at a large price , secured him to assist Contractor.
The Mares to be submitted, as will be seen by the Catalogue,
are the progeny of the very best Sires ever used in Australia,
notably Snovjden, Yattendon, Smuggler , Panic, Daniel Boone
(Imported American Trotter.) Merry Hawk (Colonial-bred
Trotter,) Alarm (Sire of Leithamstead,) S(c., <f*c. They were
selected by Mr. Miller regardless of expense.
The whole Stud is now being sold in consequence of
Mr. Miller’s early departure for England.

A FEW WORDS FOR THE TROTTING HORSE.
I accept this chance to make a few observations in favor
of the Trotting Horses in Australia to date, feeling that
they have not received the encouragement they deserve, or
that justice has been done to the enterprise of those gentle-
men who have risked large capital to import such first-class
stallions as are now at the service of the public of Australia.
The general complaint is a want of useful horses either for
Indian remounts, carriage, or buggy purposes, and that
horse stock is degenerating into a majority of useless
weeds. The remedy is now at hand, if breeders will at
least try to get a class of stock having the substance and
quality as must spring from the loins of the imported
Trotting Stallion in union with the well-bred mares of Aus-
tralia ; a large number of mares mated with such horses
must in the first generation get foals that will ensure a
certain profit, because they are all useful either for track,
carriage, or buggy purposes. To the gentleman, grazier,
or farmer, with his one or two fairly-bred hackney or buggy
mares, from what other stallions can ho get such certain
results of improved reproduction as from the beautiful
American horses, with the substance, courage, gentleness,
and docility so thoroughly characteristic of them, and
whose services are to be had for half the price of the racing
stallion ? There is no doubt but owners of thorough-breds
feel it is a great intrusion, and it may possibly upset some
of their pet theories—the introduction of the American
horse—hence we account for a considerable amount of the
opposition against him, but ho is here and can hold his
own, and must make his mark if the breeders and public
will judge for themselves.
The Victorian Trotting Club has done, and is still doing,
a great deal to encourage and foster the sport it has intro-
duced, and helped to develope such Colonial-bred trotters
as Leithamstead, Wanderer, Brown Hawk, g g Dick, Fright,
and others, and it is certain when the youngsters by the
American Stallions are old enough to show on the track the
success of trotting stock and Elsternwick Park is assured,
as I hoar some of the yearlings can now show a three
minutes’ gait, such is the prepotency of their sires to
impart.


CONTRACTOR.


Thus it is shewn that CONTRACTOR is intensely trotting-bred, having no less than 15 lines of the celebrated
Messenger, from whose loins sprang all the wonderful stock now performing on Track and Koad in America and
that CONTRACTOR does nick with thoroughbred mares is an established fact both in America and here


HO NESTY.


Priam, is also the Sire of Upright, a winner at two years old, and lias shown very fast trials.
The Yearling Sister to Honesty won the race for colts and fillies, of her age, at Stockton, in 3-2, the
fastest time ever made by a yearling in a race.
Chieftain is the Sire of Defiance, 2.17?; Cairo, 2.25.
Honesty is a grand upstanding stylish horse, 16 hands high ; of a beautiful dark chestnut color, (the
true chestnut) ; temper gentle and docile; sound constitution ; magnificently developed form ; a certain foal*
getter, and surely stamps his stock. Thus, as a sire, stands unrivalled in the Australias, and from his breeding
should get both Melbourne Cup and Grand National winners.
Ilis performances—
AMERICAN RECORD, 2.25*.
Won the Australian Trotting Championship, (March, 1883), £5OO, three straight heats, making the
BEST COLONIAL RECORD, 2.301.

The above stamp him for speed and bottom one of the best horses ever bred.
