Australian Army Reserve.
THE Australian Army Reserve has
been brought into existence by the
Australian Government to utilize, as a
National Insurance for the future peace
of Australia, the splendid experience
gained by men of the Australian Imperial
Force.
In th& Australian Army Reserve en-
rolment will be voluntary, and the period
of training per annum will not exceed four
(4) whole days, during which period the
men will be paid at Militia Force rates.
For the purpose of preserving the
traditions and honours won by the mem-
bers of the Australian Imperial Force on
active service, the Militia Units of the
Australian Military Forces will be re-
numbered and given, as far as practicable,
the numbers at present borne by the
Units of the Australian Imperial Force.
To each of the existing Militia Units
so renumbered will be linked a Reserve
Unit consisting of the men who have


served at the front in a Unit bearing the
same number as the renumbered Militia
Unit of which they will form the Reserve.
This w will insure that the numerical desig-
nation of the Australian Imperial Force
Units who have made history for Australia
will be carried on for all time in the
Military Forces of Australia, into whose
keeping a great tradition will be given,
and who, for many years, will have the
actual men who created the traditions as
the Reserve of many of their Units.
Members of the Reserve who have
served in the present war will Ipe allowed
to retain their Battalion arm patches, so
that no matter where in Australia an
Australian Imperial Force member of the
Reserve may be trained he will retain
the outward and visible sign of the Unit
with which he fought.
Officers and Non-commissioned
Officers will be appointed to the various
Reserve Units as prescribed by the
Regulations.
The Head-Quarters of a Reserve
Unit shall be that of its parent Unit.
It is reasonable to assume that, apart
from the Militia Forces and other sec-
tions of the Reserves, this scheme will


within twelve months of the termination
of the war, give Australia a force of from
150,000 to 200,000 men trained in the
latest methods of modern warfare who
can, in the event of the invasion of
Australia, be quickly and effectively
mobilized for home defence.
The Government, feeling that any
man, who through no fault of his own
has become incapacitated in the service
of his country, should not be forgotten
in this scheme, has also made provision
for an Honorary Reserve. No training
will be required from «these men, but
belonging to the Reserve will enable
them to keep in touch with their com-
rades and the Units with which they
were associated.
With the object of giving the people
an opportunity of, helping in all matters
affecting the contentment and well-being
of the men who have fought for them,
and also those who are being trained for
the future defence of Australia, and hold-
ing that it is the duty of all Australians
to, in every legitimate way, encourage
and help the men who have won for them
the right to remain a free people, the
Government has constituted the 75
Federal Electorates of the Common-


wealth into Territorial Associations. In
drawing up the duties and functions of
these Associations, the Territorial scheme
of Great Britain has been followed
wherever practicable.
The Government hopes by means of
this scheme to keep up the spirit of com-
radeship among the veterans, and to
set before the young Citizen Trainees a
standard of self-sacrifice and soldierly
conduct, and further to preserve for all
time the glorious traditions won at
Gallipoli, Egypt, and on the Western
and oth-er front*?. % • '
