SlUd o apr -is
A VERY very long while ago, a slug
named Dahlia lived in Mexico and was
called Dahlia because she was very fond
of dahlias, which lived in Mexico too.
The Snails were her cousins, .and, like
them, she came out of
and had a house on her

back,
which she carried everywhere she went.
As she moved along, carrying her
house, she looked stately and proud,
as Snails do, and was respected by
all who knew, her. All other Slugs
were respected too, and the name o
Slug was as honoured as the name o
Snail, and there was no such word as

“sluggish,” which, as you know, means
slow and lazy.
As time went on, Dahlia Slug began
to grow lazy: so did all the** other
Slugs. She grumbled about hav-
ing to carry a heavy house V wher-
ever she went, though it was a very
handy place to pop into at any moment
when anybody who liked the taste of
her came along. She wished that she
could sell her house, or let it. or give
it away, or lose it. or get rid of it
how. but she couldn't

grumbled too and wished that they
could get rid of their houses somehow.

Dahlia's cousin, Mrs. Flora Snail,
who lived next door, had a house of her
own and a husband called- Horace, and
he. of course, had. a house of his own
and a wife called. Flora. One day Flora
said to Horace, “Horace, my love, isn t
it a pity that Dahlia Slug grumbles so
much about her house?
“Yes, my love, it is.” Horace said
gravely. “Cousin Dahlia does not
deserve to have a house.

and a little old-
fashioned. Dame Nature who, of course,
had given Dahlia Slug her house, agreed
with what Mr. Horace Snail said. As

to do. She was very patient with Dahlia
and all the other Slugs, but at last she
felt that she must take away their
houses. M- One evening Dahlia

to get up. snuggled down, and

Oh, dear, I DO wish I could undo the

once she remembered that dahlia petals
were getting scarce, and that, if she
didn’t hurry, the Snails, who, she told
herself crossly, got up so absurdly early,
would have eaten all the tender petals
and left her the tough ones (which she
was too lazy to chew). The thought

HER SCREAMS BROUGHT HORACE SNAIL
RUSHING TO THE SCENE


When she saw what had happened,
she screamed. Her screams brought
Horace Snail rushing to the scene, for,
being a courtly person, he was always
ready to rush to the assistance of ladies
in distress, even though he considered
rushing undignified. After a great deal
of back-pedalling by Dahlia —she had
to go into her house backwards, of
course —and a great deal of pushing by
Horace, Dahlia was in her house again,
but, when she came out, she
came right
out, because
Dame Nature had undone the fastenings
that used to keep it on her back and
nobody else could do them up again.

Over and over again. Dahlia back-
pedalled and Horace pushed, and she
was in her house, but over and over
again she came right out, until at last
she and Horace knew that she was right
out of her house for ever. All the
other Slugs were right out of their
houses for ever too.
Because Dahlia had grumbled so
much about having to carry the house
on her back, you might think that she
was glad to get rid of it. But she wasn’t.
“Whatever will I do, whatever will
1 do?’ she wailed, Horace, who
was wise as well as Tf* courtly,
advised her to <crawl under

calmer.
So she crawled under a dewy leaf and
told herself that people would “say
things about her now that she had no
house and looked so awful. The
thought of the things they would say
made her make up her mind that she
would hide under the dewy leaf for ever
and ever. But before long she
began to feel hungry- she hadn t
had any breakfast, you know.
Hungrier and hungrier she grew, so
hungry that even the thought of tough
dahlia petals made her mouth water.
It watered so much that she decided to
crawl to the dahlias through the longest
grass she could find, so that nobody

would know her. How the grass
tickled and pricked the part of her back
where her house used to be! It tickled
and pricked so much that she almost
crawled back to the dewy leaf. But
hunger and the thought of dahlia petals
drove her on. and soon she was climbing
the stalk of a dahlia. After she had
eaten the most
could find, she
tender petals she
began to crawl
back to the dewy leaf through the
longest grass. But by now the sun was
up, so were the Caterpillars, who had
climbed the stems of the grass and had
a good view of Dahlia as she crawled
along below them.
They all “said things” about her.

“Look at Dahlia Slug, look at er! ” they
shouted. “Look at Dahlia Slug with-

And now you know that the Cater-
pillars were not very well educated 01
well-mannered and that they used slang.
Shame made Dahlia draw in her horns,
crawl away as quickly as she could, and
weep after she reached the dewy leaf.
The Caterpillars were not the only
people who V sa^
things about her, and soon she knew
that everybody was saying things about
her and all the other Slugs. This would
have made some people try very hard to
be better, but Dahlia and all the other

Slugs didn’t try at all. and got worse
and worse —lazier and lazier and slower
and slower, until they were so lazy and
so slow that, when somebody wanted
to say how very lazy and slow some-
body else was, they said, “She's almost
as lazy and slow as Dahlia Slug.”
And that is why there is an adjective
called “sluggish," which, as you know,
means very lazy and very slow.
From being stately and dignified like
the Snails, the Slugs became
and looked very humble.
You must have noticed that they look
very humble to this day. You may also
have noticed that they hide under dewy
leaves and are very fond of dahlias.


THEY ARE VERY FOND OF DAHLIAS.
