Lloyd George?s Message
to Australia.
(t On taking up the high office
with which his Majesty has
charged me, I send to you, on
behalf of the people of the old
country, a message to our brothers
beyond the seas.
There is no faltering in our
determination that the sacrifices
which we and you have made
and have still to make shall not
be in vain, and that the fight,
which we are waging together
for humanity and civilisation,
shall be fought to a triumphant
issue.
We shall need every man that
we can put in the field, every
pound that rigid public and
private economy can provide, and
every effort to help in the heavy
task of our soldiers and sailors.
The splendid contributions to
the common cause already made
by the Dominions give us sure
confidence that their determina-
tion is no less high than ours,
and that however long the path
to final victory we shall tread it
side by side.?
20th December , 1916.
SHOULD GERMANY WIN.
? Should Germany win, God help
Labor. The victory of Germany will
be the victory of the worst form of
autocracy that this world has seen for
many a century. There is no section of
the community that has anything like
the interest in overthrowing the military
caste that Labour has, and the more
they recognise that, difficulties will
vanish, and bickerings and sulkiness
will disappear.?
Lloyd George.
THE EMPIRE HAS NOT REALISED.
?o ??
? Russia is to be broken and France
too, and if there is any other nation
that will stand up to this mighty
power, that must go. Russia, a tooth-
less bear, chained in its pit; France
with neither wings to soar nor spurs to
defend herself; Britain a harmless whale
in the German Ocean, fit only for
blubber for Germany. A pretty picture !
But do not imagine that Prussia docs
not mean it all. The Empire has to
realise that, and it has not quite done
so yet.?
Lloyd George.
WE MUST FIGHT ON.
?o ?
? For us, we must fight on or for ever
sink as a people into impotent obscurity.
Britain has another task. It is becoming
clearer, and our share of it is becoming
greater as the months roll by. It is to
see that the suffering and the loss shall
not be in vain. The fields of Europe
are being rent by the ploughshares of
war. Let us see to it that wheat and
not tares are sown in the bleeding soil,
and in due season we shall reap if we
faint not.?
Lloyd George.
DEFEND HONOUR AND EXISTENCE.
?o ?
?If the nation hesitates when the
need is clear to take the necessary
steps to call forth its manhood to defend
honour and existence; if vital decisions
are postponed till too late; if, in fact,
we give ground for the accusation that
we are slouching into disaster as if we
were walking along the ordinary paths
of peace, without an enemy in sight;
then I can see no hope. But if we
sacrifice all we own, all we like for our
native land; if our preparations are
characterised by grip, resolution, and
a readiness in every sphere ; then
victory is sure.?
Lloyd George.
THE YOUNG AND VIGOROUS.
?As to the young and vigorous, I
have a word to say to them. A few of
them are asking why they should be
called upon to place their services upon
the altar of their country. Are there
not plenty of young men available, who
are eager to do so without dragging
their precious lives into the zone of
danger. Yes, there are, thank God.
It is only a minority of people who are
cowards. All the same unless the men
and women of this country are prepared
to render all that they possess and all
that they can command to help their
land in this most fateful era of its
destiny, Britian is indeed doomed, for
she will stand alone in the world?alone
as the only land whose children are
not prepared to sacrifice themselves
for her honour.?
Lloyd George.
FUTURE OP HUMAN RACE DEFENDS
UPON RESULT.
?o ?
? '"P HERE are three things I want you
A to bear in mind. The first is
that we are at war ; the. second that
it is the greatest war that has ever
been fought by this or any other
country; and the other that the des-
tinies of your country and the future
of the human race, for generations to
come, depend upon the outcome of this
war,?
Lloyd George,
NO PRICE TOO GREAT. -
?o ?
?We have but one question to ask
ourselves ?we of all ranks, of all grades,
of all trades. Victory means life for
our country. Are we doing enough to
secure it ? It means the fate of freedom
for ages to come. There is no price
that is within our power that is too
great for us to pay.?
Lloyd George.
ENTIRE ACTION NECESSARY.
??o~ ?
? The situation is sufficiently serious
to call for the united, concentrated,
and entire action and strength of every
man and woman throughout the whole
of the Empire. We have sent men to
the front. Support them. See that
we are behind them, and if we do so,
we shall win a victory for European
liberty which shall resound throughout
the ages of the world.?
Lloyd George.

'?War is a time of sacrifice and
service. Some can render one
service and some another; some
here and some there. Some can
render great service, others but
little. There is not one who can-
not help in some measure."
Lloyd George.

EVERY CITIZEN SHOULD DO HIS BEST
?In this war, every country is
demanding as a matter of right ?-not
as a matter of appeal?from every one
of its citizens that he should do his
best.
?It should be established as one of
the essential duties of citizenship, that
every man should put his whole strength
into helping the country through.?
Lloyd George.
EVERYBODY A VOLUNTEER.
?O ?

3rd Work heartily to obtain

MORE MEN WILL HASTEN PEACE.
?? o ?
? Those who are declining to place
their services at the disposal of their
country are prolonging their country's
agony. The more men that come in,
the more it ensures victory and hastens
peace. Those who approve of the war,
and think it is the duty of others to
make all the necessary sacrifices to
bring it to a triumphant end ?these
men I must crave leave to despise.
?Let others give up their sons of
whom they are proud and fond. Why
should they surrender the children of
their heart to perish for their country's
sake ?
"The parents who present such a
standard of duty to their children, and
teach them at the start of life the
lesson of duty shirked, are traitors to
their most sacred trust ?traitors to
their county, and traitors to their
children."
Lloyd George.
SHADOW UPON TWO GENERATIONS.
?o ?
?The sacrifice comes to you to-day,
and it comes to-day to us all in the form
of the glow and thrill of a great move-
ment for liberty, that impels millions
throughout Europe to the same noble
end. It is a great war for the eman-
cipation of Europe from the thraldom
of a military caste, which has thrown
its shadow upon two generations of
men, and is now plunging the world
into a welter of bloodshed and death.
Some have already given their lives.
There are some who have given more
than their lives; the lives of those who
are dear to them, I honour their
courage, and may God be their comfort
and strength. But their reward is at
hand. Those who have died have died
sacred deaths. They have taken their
part in the making of a new Europe?
a new world."
Lloyd George.
