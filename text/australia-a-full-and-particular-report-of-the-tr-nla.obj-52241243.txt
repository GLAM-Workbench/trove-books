SUPREME COURT.—CRIMINAL SIDE.
Sydney , Thursday , November 15, 1838.
(before his honour the chief justice and a civil jury.)
Charles Kilmaister, William Hawkins, John Blake, John Johnston,
Charles Toulouse, Charles Lamh, Edward Foley, James Oates, James
Parry, George Palliser, and John Russell, were indicted for the w ilful
murder of one Daddy, an Aboriginal black native, on the 9th of June,
11538. There were 9 counts in the indictment, charging the prisoners
in different forms with committing the murder, and aiding and abetting
each other in the murder of Daddy, or of an Aboriginal black to the
Attorney General unknown.
For the prosecution—The Attorney General and Mr 11. Therry.
For the defence—Messrs Foster, a’Beckett, and Windever.
List of the Jury—Thomas Holmes, Foreman; David Hill, George
Humphries, John Harris, Joseph Hanson, Matthias Hooper, Charles
Hensley, Thos. Harper, Henry Hough, William Howard, Andrew
Higgins, and John Hall.
The indictment was read to the Jury.
Mr Attorney General enquired whether the opposite side would re-
quire the Police Magistrate to leave the Court ? The Judge decided
that he must.
The Attorney General then proceeded with his case. The case,
gentlemen, which you are called upon to try is one of no ordinary
importance to this colony ; I am sure the case will receive all the at-
tention which it. demands. When eleven men are placed at the bar for a
capital crime, it is itself sufficient evidence of the importance of the
case. Before going into the case, 1 must entreat you, gentlemen, to
dismiss from your minds all impressions which may have been produced
by what you may have heard or read on the present subject. As the
information is so long, gentlemen, I may as well state its foundation ;
—lt is stated in various ways in order to meet the evidence which we
shall produce. When you hear the evidence you will know the reason
why we were obliged to have bo many counts. The last count, gen-
tlemen, charges the whole of the prisoners with casting the deceased
Daddy into the fire and thereby causing his death. Gentlemen, murder
is regarded as the greatest crime in all nations, but here is a case which
shows that there are gradations even in murder. The information only
shows at the utmost the death of two men, whereas, in fact, on the same
day and in the same hour the lives of 20 individuals, men, women, and
children, were sacrificed without.any probable cause orprovocation topal-
liate the most atrocious crime in the sight of any laws human or divine.
Gentlemen, the prisoners at the bar were all living beyond the boun-
daries of the colony. Kilmaister is a prisoner for life assigned to Mr
Dangar, Hawkins is a ticket-of-lcave man, Johnston free by servitude,
loulouse assigned to Mr Glennie, Lamb a tickot-of-leave man, Foley
assigned to Mr Flemming, Oates assigned to Mr George Hall, Parry


assigned to Mr Eaton, Palliscr and Russel free by servitude, and
Blake assigned to Mr Glennie, You see, by this description, that
they were all assigned, for one cause or other, to their respective
situations, and you will perceive by the evidence that they were
confederate in the slaughter of the native blacks. On the Bth or 9th
of June they met at Russel’s, they were all armed and mounted,
and proceeded to scour the country in pursuit of the blacks. They
went from station to station until they arrived at Mr Dangar’s.
The overseer was not at home, but Kilmaister was there, also
another assigned servant; they gallopped up. The blacks on seeing
them escaped into the house ; this was the object of their perse-
cutors ; they wanted to get the whole of them into the house and
thus get them into their power. Two women and two “ piccaninnies’’
alone remained outside ; the two little ones escaped by crossing
a brook. The prisoners on being asked what they were about to do
with their captives, said, and I believe it was Russel who was spokes-
man, that they were going to take them to the mountains to frighten
them ; however, they had not proceeded far when several shots were
heard. The whole party then returned, and three of them took fire-
sticks and again proceeded to the spot where the shots had been heard.
Kilmaister produced a'bloody sword which he had in his hand when
he left before the shots were heard, but which was not then bloody.
The prisoner (Kilmaister) charged the men that took the fire-sticks to
take care that the blacks were close together in order that they might
all be consumed. This expression could only apply to the bodies.
When Mr Hobbs, overseer at Mr Danger’s, came home lie went to the
spot and discovered a great number of bodies which had been burned
on logs. He counted 10 or 12 sculls of children, and as many of
women ; he also saw the remains of a body which he is convinced was
that of Daddy, a large powerful man. Mr Foster, overseer to Dr
Newton, also witnessed the dreadful sight. When Mr Hobbs returned
he had great difficulty in discovering anything about the matter;
Anderson, the hut-keeper, was afraid to say anything knowing that so
many men on the different stations were leagued together for the
destruction of the natives. When Mr Hobbs announced his intention
of making the matter public, Kilmaister went on his knees to his mas-
ter and begged him to say nothing about it. He also stated that, when
reprimanded for the share he had in the affair, that he could not resist
eleven men. I am sincerely glad to see the prisoners defended by
counsel; lam gald to see the present prisoners in that situation, but
a rumour has gone abroad that this defence is made at the instance of
an association illegally formed, for the purpose of defending all who
may be charged with crimes resulting from any collision with the
natives. I say that if such an association exist, that, if there be men
who have joined together for the purpose of defending sucli men as
these, the object of that society is to encourage bloodshed and crime of
every description. Gentlemen, I have too high an opinion of you,
and of the discrimination of the public at large, to think for a moment
that any bloody article appearing in any paper or papers will at all
influence you in the verdict which you are to give this day. Gentle-
men, it has been promulgated from the bench, by the judges of the
land, that the black is as amenable for his evil acts as the white men,
and therefore as much entitled to protection by the laws. These


crimes were committed in cold blood, and arose from no dispute; it
was malicious and not caused by momentary irritation and excite-
ment. I have endeavoured to do part of my duty, and I will now
conclude by calling the witnesses.
Thomas Foster, superintendent of Dr Newton’s establishment on the
Big River. 1 have been at the Big River three years; I was therein
June last; it is almost fifteen miles from Mr Dangar’s; it was, I think,
on the Saturday before the 9th of June 1 went to Mr Dangar’s; Mace,
Mr Dight’s overseer was with me; I stopped there that night; I saw
Anderson the hut-keeper, and about thirty or forty blacks; there were
men, women, and children; I was accompanied by ten blacks, and Mr
Dight’s overseer, when I went home; when I arrived, I received infor-
mation from John Merton, a boy on the station, in consequence of which
I sent the ten blacks back to Mr Dangar’s; I never saw them again; I
saw them about half a mile off going to Mr Dangar’s; it was about four
in the afternoon, when I sent the blacks away ; on Monday, at about
half an hour after sunrise, I saw a party of mounted men, some of them
armed; there wore about ten or twelve, all mounted, nearly all armed,
I believe, with pistols; they came to the men’s hut, in which were Dr
Newton’s servants; two of them came near enough to speak to me;
Oates and Kilmaister were the two ; Oates is commonly known by the
name of 1 [ale’s Jemmy; I asked him “ what’s the matter ?” he made
no answer, but asked for the blacks ; I said, “ God know’s where they
are now.” This was all I heard or said ; they all galloped up together;
they were all near enough to hear, but I can’t say that they did, some
of them got off their horses and went into the hut ; I saw Johnstone
afterwards pass the door of my own hut; all appeared to be going to-
wards the stock-yard ; I can only recognize Kilmaister, Johnstone,
Hawkins, and Oates; I know that Kilmaister and Oates were armed;
Russell was with them; I do not know any other prisoner at the bar,
1 said to Kilmaister, “ are you after the blacks ?’’ he said, “ they rush-
ed my cattle yesterday;” he came in €or his horse which had gone into
the garden; I believe Kilmaister is an assigned servant to Mr Dangar,
I had been over to Mr Dangar’s the day before, but I did not hear any-
thing about the cattle; I dare say they stopped about a quarter of an
hour; I know Sexton, who lives on the farm; I did not see any black
women ; when they left our place they went to Mr Dangar’s; I did not
fall in with the party again ; Dight’s station was two miles off in ano-
ther direction ; 1 saw a party again about three miles off; I could not
recognize them at that distance ; two or three days afterwards I went
to Mr Dangar’s and saw Mr Hobbs; I accompanied him to a sheep sta-
tion within two or three miles of the principal station ; I parted with
him at the sheep station, but proceeded to Mr Dangar’s, and remained
there that night; in the morning Mr Hobbs took me about half a mile
from his house to see the remains of some blacks; Anderson’s house is
almost a djoining Mr Dangar’s; I believe he is a hut-keeper; I saw the
body of a black man with the head on ; the limbs had apparently been
burnt off; I saw another head without any body; and several other
skulls so destroyed by fire as to render it impossible to say whether
they were men or women ; there appeared to have been a large fire
recently; there were two men’s heads that were not burned, and lam
positive they were black men’s heads; I did not examine whether there
were any wounds on the body or not; I did notsee any arms of a body;


I did not see any smaller limbs; I tracked some horses from Mr Dan-
gar's to that place; I cannot say how many; but there must have been
several; I did not see any other heads but those I have spoken of; I
saw four or five heads altogether; I did not go close enough to examine
how the head was separated; I only stopped ten minutes at the farthest;
I was overcome by the smell; the place where these remains were, was
the side of a ridge about half a mile from MrDangar’s; the fire ap-
peared to have occupied a large space; I went direct home from the
spot; I told the circumstance to several persons; I did not communi-
cate with the magistrate; Mr Hobbs was with me when I saw the skulls,
but he went home; Mr Hobbs told me he had been there before; we
went together and left together when I saw them ; Mr Hobbs was ob-
liged to keep further away than I did on account of the smell; on the
Sunday I was at Mr Dangar’s, I saw Kilmaister; he did not say any-
thing about the battle ; it was the next morning.
Cross-examined by Mr a’Beckett. What Kilmaister said to me was
in answer to a question put by me; Mr Hobbs was very much affected;
the tracks were in the road from Mr Dangar’s to my place ; I do not
think 1 tracked the horses all the way to the spot where the fire
had been; it had been wet, I should think it very easy to track any
horses; I would only swear to two being armed with pistols; it is cus-
tomary to carry pistols in the bush; they are always mounted, it is in
consequence of the danger ensured by meeting the blacks; I have been
very fortunate; my station is a central station, and I believe that is the
reason that I have not been annoyed; my neighbours have not been
so fortunate; I cannot say whether the blacks are generally armed,
that was the first party I had seen ; I have not seen any children’s
skulls, I have told you all I saw; Hobbs did not state that there was
any difference from the night before : I suppose Mr Hobbs to be affect-
ed by the effluvia; Mr Hobbs did not then say he wished the blacks
had all been killed.
Re-examined—The tracks were on a road which we term public; it
is very little used. It is not usual to meet several men mounted look-
ing for blacks ; the ten blacks who accompanied me were quiet; they
were not armed; I certainly think if there had been any skulls I
should have seen them; I have seen Daddy.
By Mr a’Beckett—l have seen Daddy; he is called Daddy.
By the chief Justice—He was an old man.
By Mr a’Beckett—The blacks were unarmed with the exception of
a tomahawk or two; there might be three ; I did not see any sticks;
Daddy was a short man.
Mr Hobbs—l have been superintendeut'to Mr Dangar for two years;
I am his principal superintendent; I recollect the beginning of June
last; I left my station on the 7th June for the Big River; it was
Thursday; I had a station sixty or seventy miles lower down; I left
Kilmaister and Anderson in charge. There were about forty or fifty
blacks on the station when I left; there were men, women, and children
there were ten or twelve women, and as many children; the remainder
■were men young and old; as far as I saw they were quiet; they had
been ten or twelve days on the station when I left; I returned to the
station on the 15th June; I am certain it was the 16th,but I cannot
recollect the day of the week; Anderson was at home when I returned
and a black servant (Davy) whom I had left at the station ; I saw Kil


maUtov in a few minutes after; I received some
made me question, Anderson; when Kilmaister came home,
.and asked him what had become of the blacks I had left at the station ?
he said he did not know; I told him that I knew they were murdered
and all about it; he declared that he knew nothing about it; I told
him that he had been to Dr Kevyton’s and Mr Dight’s stations with other
men ;he said he was looking for his cattle; from what Davy said to me,
I asked him to go with me and he took me about half a mile from my
house in a westerly direction; there had been a shower of rain and the
tracks of horses and of naked feet were quite discernable; it was a re-
gular track; there were children’s footsteps; the horse tracks were on
either side and the track of the naked feet were in the middle; they
were in the same direction of the horse tracks; I arrived at a spot where
there were a great number of dead bodies; but the stench was so great
that I was not able to be accurate in counting them; I endeavoured to
count them and made more of them sometimes than others, the most I
made was 28; the skulls which had been burnt were easily discernible;
the last number I counted was 20: I will undertake to swear that there
were the remains of above 20: I saw some of the bodies; they were
very much disfigured; 1 cannot say how many, I did know Daddy, he
was an old man; he was the largest man ever I saw, either white or
black; I saw a large body there, but the head was gone; from the size
of the bodv I think it was his; 1 left Daddy on the station; I saw the
children’s lieads quite distinctly; there were 10 or 12 small heads, also
some children’s bodies; I could not swear that it was Daddy’s body; I
am perfectly satisfied within my own mind that it was the body of
Daddy; it was lying on its back; there was no head, and the fire had
destroyed nearly the whole of the flesh; I believe it to be the body of
a man—fhe body of Daddy; I saw several heads; I endeavoured to re-
cognize them but could not at all; I saw both male and female heads;
there were several which had altogether escaped from the fire ; I should
think they were cutoff, I cannot say positively; Davy was with me that
evening ; the following morning Mr Foster went with me; I tracked
the horses up to the spot where the bodies were lying; at the corner of
a paddock behind Anderson’s hut I came upon this track, about 50 or
GO yards from my house ; the fire occupied a space about half as large
.as this Court house; there were the remains of a large log; I saw several
blood-stains on the gravel all around; the extent of the ground pre-
vented my counting the numbers correctly; the next day Mr Foster
went with me; I did not gq close to the spot, I was unwell from the
effects of the sight the day before; Mr Foster was not there more than
a minute and a half altogether; I had remained at least a quarter of an
hour the day before; the only difference I perceived was that the native
dogs had destroyed portions of the remains ; there were a great many
birds of prey, eagle hawks, &c.: I spoke to Kilmaister on the evening
of the second day; I told him I thought it a very cruel thing to sanc-
tion the murder of these people as they were on such friendly terms, and
also it was altogether through him that the blacks werepermitted to be on.
the station at all; 1 said I considered it my duty to report it; he said he
hoped I would not, not that he had any thing to do with it,but the blacks
having been with us for some time it would cause his removal ; he ap-
peared excessively uneasy and begged me not to report it; I wrote to Mr
Danger; when 1 had written the letter, I sent for the men to come


down and hear it; they came; Kalmaister and Anderson came down ;
I read the letter ; Kilmaister was very much agitated ; he entreated
me not to report the matter; he said the blacks had been spearing his
cattle while I was away ; he did not tell me that when I first told him
of the murder; I requested him to show me the cattle which he said
had been speared ; I was on the “ run’’ four or five days, but I saw no
signs that the cattle had been disturbed; I felt satisfied that he had
told me an untruth in order to prevent my relating the circumstance ;
there were no cattle speared at this time; the blacks I left on the
station were brought there by Kilmaister; they behaved well; they
were not offensive in the least degree; I had several conversations with
Kilmaister; 1 pointed out the indecency with which the remains had
been treated; he offered to go and bury them, but I told him that if
his protestations of innocence were true, it would do him an injury to
interfere in any such way, when the matter was investigated ; he
always denied knowing any thing of the crime, and I always believed
him innocent until the depositions were taken ; he was daily dancing
and singing with the blacks after his return from the run; I asked
Kilmaister how the blacks were taken away, and he told me that the
men took them; he did not say that he was present, but I understood
that he was; I asked him what he was doing at Mr Dight’s station
with the men; he said he was looking after his cattle, that he did not
go with them, and that Davy would prove it; Kilmaister had a brace
of pistols at his command, and he rarely went without them; I never
went out without a brace; some few days after I was at Mr Eaton’s
station I saw Perry; I thought he was the hut-keeper; I said to him
“Jemmy, this is a bad job, and I am vexy sorry you are one of the
number.” He answered, “it is, six*, but I hope there will be nothing
more about it;” Mr Day the P. M. went to the stations either at the
latter end of July or the beginning of August; I had forwarded my
communication to Mr Day; Mr Dangar has not yet settled with me,
but I believe that I shall leave his employ on account of this affair; I
was at the statioix when Mr Day came there ; I pointed out the place
where the fire had been; the bodies had disappeared; there were
some remains ; ribs and children’s jaw bones; I helped to pick them
up; the heads had all been removed ; Ido not know by whom, I never
heard; I never went to the place between the day that Mr Foster was
with me and the time I went with Mr Day.
Cross-examined by Mr Foster.—l had been at Myall Creek 15
months; I had been there nearly all the time; Kilmaister always
denied having any thing to do with it; Kilmaister has always been a
good servant, and he was afraid if this case were investigated he should
be returned into governmexxt service; the fire-araxs wex*e there for
personal safety; I would not go out without fire-arms myself; 1 do
think it dangerous for any one to go into the bush fiir from the set-
tlexnents without fire-arms; I very much doubt whether there is in
New South Wales a better servant than Kilmaister; I should not
have thought he would wantonly attack another; I returned on the
15th June; Davy the black took me to the place where the fire had
been; I was there on the evening of the 15th, and on the morning of
the 16th ; it was near sundown in the evening, and about 8 or 9 in
the morning; the general appearance of the x'emains was the same;
some of the bodies appeared to have been dragged away by the native


dogs; I did not go near it the second time, but he (Mr Foster) had not
so good an opportunity of examining the place as well as I had; I saw
the large body ; there was no head, but the body was pretty whole;
the legs and arms were gone; I could not swear that it was a male; it
was a large frame; I could not swear that the black called Daddy is
not now in existence.
By the Attorney-General.—l could not swear that Daddy is dead;
I have not seen him since; I never saw a female so large as that
frame; I never saw any of those persons who were on the station
since; I have made enquiries for them.
Mr Day, P. M., Mussel Brook.—l received information at the latter
end of June, which induced me to report the circumstances to the Col-
onial Secretary; sometime after I was directed to proceed with a party
of police to that part of the country to investigate the matter; I went
to Mr Dangar’s; on the evening I arrived at Mr Hobbs, and one of the
officers of the mounted police accompanied me to the spot, there ap-
peared to have been afire about 15 yards in circumference ; there were
a great quantity of fragments of bones; the place had the appearance of
having been swept, and all large portions had been removed, 1 found a
bone which I supposed to be the rib of a young child, the jawbone of a
human being, and a few teeth; I examined into the case and committed
the prisoners; the prisoner Parry, I was informed, had expressed great
regret for having been concerned in the affair; I accordingly had a
communication with him, thinking perhaps that he had some com-
munication to make; I found much difficulty in obtaining information
on the subject.
George Anderson examined.—l am hut keeper, and assigned ser-
vant to Mr Dangar; I was at Myall Creek five months; Mr Hobbs is
superintendent; I recollect his going to the Big River in the beginning
of June ; I cannot say exactly how many native blacks were on the
station; I know there were twenty and upwards; I could not say there
were not forty; on a Saturday about ten men came on horseback, armed
with muskets, swords, and pistols ; they were all armed; I was at
home when they came; I was sitting in the hut with Kilmaister the
stockman; they came up galloping, with guns and pistols pointed
towards the hut; they were talking to Kilmaister ; they all came up
together; Russell, Toulouse, Foley, black Johnston, Hawkins, Palli-
ser, Lamb, and Oates, were there; Blake and Parry I cannot swear to;
there were about ten on horseback; I will not say Parry was not
there, but I cannot say I saw him ; I cannot say who came out first;
they were spread out into a line about to surround the blacks; the
blacks were all camped, ready for the night; it wanted about half an
hour of sun down ; there were women and children with them; the
blacks on seeing them ran into the hut; the men then got off their
horses; the prisoner Russell took a rope from his horse’s neck, and
commenced undoing it; while he was preparing his rope, I asked what
they were going to do with the blacks, he answered me that they were
going to take them to the back of the range, and frighten them; Russell
went into the hut, and the blacks were brought out tied ; I heard the
blacks crying out for assistance; the mothers and children were crying,
and the little ones that could not walk; Russell brought out the end of
the rope that they were tied with, and gave it to one of the men on
horseback ; they then started, taking the blacks with them; the man


who took the rope from Russell, went in front; they were tied ; one
black was handcuffed; their hands were all tied, with the palms to
each other; the rope was a very long one; they took all the blacks
away, except two boys that jumped into the creek as the men were
coming up ; they left one black gin with me in the hut; they said she
was good looking ; I do not know who said so; they left another black
gin with Davy; a little child was at the back of the hut while they
were tying the blacks; instead of allowing her to go with the party, I
pulled her into the hut, and kept her there ; the oldest of the lot was
called old Daddy; he was a very old, big, tali man; they were all tied;
they all complained of being obliged to go; the biggest boys were tied,
and those who could not walk were carried by the gins; the women
who carried the children were tied ; they went towards the west from
the hut; Kilmaister got his horse while they were tying the blacks;
he went with them, and took the pistol with him; he had been talking
with them five or ten minutes; I did not pay any attention to what
they were talking about; I was frightened ; Oates was aimed he had a
brace of pistols; they had a great many amongst them; I saw Foley
standing at the door with a pistol in his hand; I did not notice his
sword; I saw the swords in the distance; Kilmaister went with them ;
I did not keep them in sight more than a minute or two; about a
quarter of an hour afterwards I hear the reports of two pieces, one
after the other, in the same direction as they had gone ; the sound was
quite plain; I did not notice more than two ; I should have heard if
moi’e had been fired ; I did not hear any other sounds; I forget what
sort of a night; I saw the same men the night after; they came back
to my hut whence they had taken the blacks ; they all came except
Kilmaister; one of the party gave me Kilmaister’s saddle; I asked
where he was; he came in about twenty minutes afterwards; they
stopped there all night; I did not know any thing myself, but I heard
something about the blacks; on the next morning they went out on
the same road as they took the night before; Kilmaister slept with me,
the other men were in the hut all the night, hut I do not remember what
they talked about; after breakfast, Russell, Kilmaister, and Flemings,
took out fire sticks, and when they were going, Fleming told Kilmais-
ter to bring the leg rope ; they all went off in the same direction as
they went the night before, excepting Foley, who remained with me;
Foley and I were in the hut, and during the time they were away, I
asked Foley if all the blacks had made their escape; he said none that
he saw; they were all killed but one; u short time before the party
came home, Foley drew a sword belonging to one of the party; it was
covered with blood; in about an hour they came home; I saw the smoke
a short time after; they got up their horses, and Fleming told Kil-
inaister to go up by and by and put the logs together, and to be sure
that all was consumed; Ido not recollect whether Kilmaister answered;
Kilmaister did go in that direction almost immediately, and remained
nearly the whole day; he said he was going for his horse; I never went
to the spot; Davy went; Kilmaister was away nearly the whole day;
his horse might have been easily caught; there was a great smoke; I
was at the station when Mr Dangar came;' Kilmaister was at home; a
piece of a sword was found in the hut; I picked it up, and gave it to
Mr Hobbs, when the police left the station; it did not belong to the
station; it was a piece of the handle; I gave it to Mr Hobbs; he re


turned it to me, and I put it in the hut, where it after the police went
away; Kihuaistev said to mo, for God’s sake mind what you say; do
not say I went with them; it was not true, he did go with them, and
at the same time; the women and children who were left Avith me, 1
sent away with the ten blacks who had left our station with Mr Fos-
ter; it was a moonlight night; I turned them all away the same night,
because I did not want them to be killed by those men whom 1 knew
to be out after the blacks.
Cross-examined by Mr Windever.—l do not know exactly the hour
the ten blacks came ; I did send them away all together; I did think
they might be killed; they did not leave the boys; they might not
have killed the two gins; I do not remember asking for that gin;
after they untied one for Davy, I asked for one for myself ; I do not
know their reason for not taking Davy; the only thing 1 know is, that
Davy was more naturalized; Ido not recollect their giving any reason
for not taking Davy; 1 wish they had left them all; I did not wish
any blacks to remain there ; 1 wanted a gin that I had had before, not
the one they left me; 1 will swear that I staid in the hut all night;
Davy did not go with them ; I never went to the place where the bodies
were found; I did not see any bush fires on that day, or the day before;
I heard the two shots quite plainly; I do not know whether I told all
this to Mr Hobbs ; I told him that I could not help the blacks ; I did
tell Mr Hobbs I did not know who they were; 1 never said that I was
sorry I had not made a stronger case against Kilmaister ; I do not re-
collect I ever said any thing of the sort to Burrows; I did not recognize
more than one at the time of my first examination; Ido not recollect
how Jong after it was that the Magistrate called at the station ; I re-
membered Russel and Fleming by name as well as his race; I did say
to Mr Hobbs that I did not know' them; I had a second examination,
because I wanted to tell more which I had recollected; I have been in
the colony about five years; I am here for life; I never said that my
evidence would get me my liberty; I would take any thing I could get;
I only ask for protection; I do not know what made my evidence more
against them the second time Ido not know; the Magistrate said he
would commit me for perjury; he said I might be committed for not
thinking; it was after this that I began to recollect every thing that
was said and done; I have been punished twice, once for neglect of
duty and being absent from the station; I was not punished at that
station; he took me to Court once; I was at New England; I do not
think I deserved that punishment; I was eight days coming; I had
a hundred lashes; 1 came here for robbing my master; I was ignorant,
and misled by others; lam no thief; I told another to do it; 1 was
apprentice; they said let Foley stop to take care of the ai'ms; 1 thought
it was meant to make me believe that there was danger ; I have been
frightened by the blacks; I saw a black fellow one night run away
directly he saw me, and I was very much frightened ; I knew Old
Joey; he was at the station with the others; King Sandy, his wife, and
little Charley, were also taken away; the gin I wanted was Heppita,
she, Sandy, and Joey, were taken away, and another black fellow called
Tommy ; I could name nearly the whole if they w r ere before me ; I
did not know all their names; Sandy, his wife, Charley, and the others
I have mentioned were tied and taken away.
Re-examined.—Davy never belonged to that tribe; he belonged to


Peel River; he came down to that station with cattle; the blacks were
there when lie came; I meant that I did not know them before; I was
examined at my own place the first night that Mr Day came; Kilmais-
ter was taken into custody and I was examined ; I was in bed when I
was called before Mr Day; I was frightened and confused; I knew them
all by sight immediately when they were in custody, and I said at
once that there were two with men who did not come to the hut; they
left muskets, pistols, and two swords; I counted fifteen pistols myself;
there were two Sandys, one was with Mr Foster, and the other was
taken away; it was King Sandy who went with Mr Foster.
John Bates, hut-keeper, assigned to Mr Bight’s station at the Big
River, about two miles from Dr Newton’s.—l was at Dr Newton’s
in June; I saw a party of men, apparently stock-keepers, at Dr New-
ton’s, about ten or twelve; they stopped a few minutes; they asked if
there were any blacks there; 1 knew some of the men; I knew Hall’s
Jemmy (Oates); Lamb was at Dr Newton’s; Oates was at Dr Newton’s,
he was at our place on Saturday. Mr Eaton’s man Parry was there,
Hawkin’s was there; black Johnstone was there also; one of them asked
if there were any blacks cutting bark there; they all rode up together;
some were armed; I saw two or three pistols, some small muskets, and a
sword; I cannot positively saywdietheranyofthosel have mentioned had
arms; I called the hut-keeper, and after speaking to him they rode away;
on Monday, about 9 o’clock in the morning, the same party came to Mr
Bight’s; when I came home I found the party in the hut ; they had
dismounted; I had been about the place; the woman was not in the
hut a few minutes before; when I came back I found the men and a
woman there; there might be ten or twelve men altogether; I do not
know whether they were all armed; Hall’s, Jemmy, and Kilmaister,
were at our place on Monday morning; one of them, I do not know
which, said they would call for the black woman ; they remained about
an hour and a half; Mr Eaton’s man Parry told me they had settled
the blacks, they were all at the hut when Parry said this; I cannot say
whether they heard the observation; no one denied it; I am sure
Parry said it; I did not say any thing about Mr Foster ; I cannot tell
why he talked to me about the blacks; it was the day after the murder,
the Monday, I do not know Toulouse ; I do not know any more than
those I have pointed out; I was sent for to know if 1 could identify
Russel, but I could not.
Andrew Burrows assigned to Mr Dangar.—l was at the lower station
with cattle when Mr Hobbs went to the Big River, I know there were
a great many blacks, men, women, and children, about the house;
I know that there was an old man called Daddy; he was a large man ;
I was away about ten days; Ido not know exactly what day I arrived
at the station; I spoke to Kilmaister about what I had heard; I said
that I had heard the blacks had been taken away, that it was a shame,
and that Mr Hobbs would be angry; he said that he knew nothing
about it, and told me to mind my own business, that there were some
men came and took them away, he did not know where; I was living
with Kilmaister before; I was at Russel’s before that; I saw some
men there, I do not know their names; Hawkins was there, Russel,
Foley, Palliseer was there also, and I think Johnston ; I know there
was a man of colour, but I did not speak to him; I arrived at the
lower station before Mr Hobbs; J started before him; it was the third


night we stopped at Russel’s; they were talking about the blacks and
other things; they asked mo if the blacks were at our station, I said
yes, that they had been there four or five weeks; they then said those
could not have been the blacks who committed the depredations down
the river; 1 saw some fire-arms, and one man was putting a leather
strap to his sword; they said they were going to look after some blacks,
one man was making a leathern pouch; it might be used for ammuni-
tion; I think they said they wished Jem Lamb was at home; I do not
remember the number; I do not swear what number, and if I did
swear it I cannot now remember; 1 met Fleming a short distance
from Russel’s hut; I cannot say how far; he had a musket or a lowi-
ng peace ; I called at Russel’s on my way back; he was not at home;
1 only went into the milking-yard; I never knew Fleming before, but
I was told it was him; Toulouse was at Russel’s.
Cross-examined by Mr a’Beckett.—lt was not strange to meet a man
armed ; stockmen always go armed; I cannot say whether there was
a larger.man than old Daddy; 1 know Anderson; Kilmaister and he
used to quarrel very often; 1 know one night when we were in bed
lie said he was sorry for one thing he had done; he was sorry he had
not told the whole affair, and that it would have been worse for
Kilmaister,
By the Attorney General.—l do not know what he meant; I was
afraid of Mr Dangar’s asking me questions; I can’t say that it was in
spite to Kilmaister; it was after Kilmaister had been taken away by
the police that he saw this.
Warren Mace, a ticket-of-leave man living at Mr Bight’s.—A party
of horsemen came to our place; some of them were armed; 1 saw
them when they arrived; they left a black gin at our station; there
was one person desired her to be taken care of; there were ten or
twelve; they stopped to breakfast; Kilmaister, Hawkins, Johnstone,
Toulouse, Toby, Blake, and Oates were amongst them ; some of them
were armed; there was nothing said about blacks; I have seen five
or six men armed and on horseback before ; I knew some of the men
to be employed in the neighbourhood, and did not ask any questions.
Cross-examined by Mr Foster.—l saw king Sandy the day before—
Sunday ; I am not positive to the day of the week, but it was on the
loth; our place is about sixteen miles from Mr Dangar’s house.
Charles Reid.— lam servant to Mr Dangar; 1 joined the station at
the Big River; I took some cattle down to the lower station; it is
about sixty miles; we stopped at Russel’s I think on Thursday, three
days after we left Mr Dangar’s; I saw Palliser, Hawkins, Foiey, and
1 oulouse ; Burrows was with me ; 1 do no recollect anything particu-
lar ; they asked if we had any blacks up our way; they said those
could not be the blacks who had committed the depredations down
the river; I saw a musket and a sword; 1 think they said they had
been down the river; that the blacks had been rushing the cattle ; I
knew the men; I did not ask them what brought them all together ;
the pouch was just such a one as is used for ammunition; I stopped at
the lower station; I met Fleming, he was alone.
Mr Hobbs recalled.—l sent Burrows and Reid to the lower station
with cattle on Tuesday the sth; Russel’s is about forty miles from
our upper station; it was the evening of the 15th; I first saw the
remains then.


Cross-examined.—l did not watch them the whole of the way; i saw
them start.
Mr Foss, dentist.—l saw a jaw-bone; there were two teeth in it;
this was a part of a human jaw, and there were human teeth in it •
they appeared to have been burned.
This was the ease against the prisoner’s,
Mr a’Beckett submitted that there was nothing in all the nine counts
to go the jury. He said the whole charge is about Daddy, or a black
native, name unknown, and the evidence is perfectly circumstantial.
Mr Hobbs is the only one who speaks to the identity of Daddy, and he
could not swear whether the mass of putridity which he saw, was a
man or a woman, thus four counts fall to the ground. In the fifth
count, the case is set forth differently; it is said that some person,
name unknown, lost his life by a shot from a pistol; there is no proof
that this party lost his life in such a way. The sixth count charges
Oates with the firing of the pistol, he having been seen with a weapon
of the hut, but there is no evidence that Oates did fire it; and therefore,
the simple circumstance of his carrying a pistol or pistols, was not
enough for a case to go to the jury. The seventh count relates the
same circumstances, except that a sword is the weapon, and Foley is
the man charged. The same remarks which were made as to the pis-
tol were applicable in this case. Mr a’Beckett quoted a rule about
criminal informations, which related an instance of two persons who
were executed for the murder of two persons who were then alive,
although missing.
Mr Foster supported the objections on the samegrounds, adding that
those countswhich set forth the black male to have been unknown could
not stand, inasmuch as it was proved that he might have been known,
had he been one of the blacks who left Mr Dangar’s. The point which
I submitted most strongly was, that no proof had been adduced that
Daddy was not alive, or that a dead male black had been found.
His honour said, that the case must go to the jury.
Mr Dangar, St Patrick’s Plains.—Kilmaister is my scxwant; he has
been in my service since 1834 ; he has always been a good and obedi-
ent servant; Anderson is also my servant; I would not believe him on
his oath; he has been very troublesome, and on the most trifling
occasion he is addicted to lying.
Cross-examined. —Anderson has been in my service since 1833, and
for the first two years he was under my immediate superintendence;
he has been two years under Mr Hobbs; I have had him punished more
than once ; at a very recent occasion, at the last sheep shearing, he left
his station to the mercy of chance for two or three days ; I visited the
station on two occasions during his absence; I would not believe him
on his oath; if I discovered Kilmaister away from his station I would
have him punished ; I heard he was taken up; I have only heard what
has been deposed; Kilmaister was not in my power; Mr Hobbs is not
under my displeasure on account of this case; I swear it; he is about
to leave my "service; his term is up ; I have been at the station since
the fire was there; Mr Hobbs was with them ; I understood from the
evidence against Kilmaister, that he had joined a party ; I did not see
a part of a sword ; Anderson has been troublesome, and has often told
me he was at one place at one time, when I have discovered he was
at another; on the very occasion for which he was punished, he told


me a lie; he said he had been to look for lost sheep, when I knew that
they were safe at the station; at another time he was sent to a station
at some distance, and he came home with a story of having lost hi a
beasts, and I discovered he had been loitering at a station on the road;
lam a subscriber for the defence of these men; I have a servant
amongst them; I believe an honest one and perfectly innocent; as to
how much I decline answering.
Mr Cobb.—l know Lamb; lie has been in my employ two years; he
has conducted himself with every propriety, 1 always thought him a
quiet, peaceable man.
Mr T. Simpson Hall.—Oates is under my superintendence ; I have
known him for three years; he is a steady, correct man.
Cross-examined. —rsuperintend a large stock; some of it is my own;
I have the superintendence of two stations on the Hunter, and three
beyond the boundaries; he was without an overseer on the occasion of
the present trial.
George Bowman, farmer and grazier.—Johnston has been in my
service five years and a half; for the last four years and a half I have
found him a good man; I always sent him in charge of cattle and goods;
I preferred him, and he has always behaved well; he is free about two
years; 1 only knew him while in my service; it is now two years since
he left my employ; Mr Cox offered him higher wages than I did, and
he left me, or 1 should have employed him to this day.
Mr Jolliffe, superintendent to Messrs Bell.—Palliseer and Russel
have been under my charge two years; Russel has been a very active
man, a good servant, and a quiet well-disposed man; Palliseer was the
same; 1 always found them at home and quiet attentive servants,
v Cross-examined.— I know nothing of this affair I was in Sydney at
the time it happened-
This was the case for the defence.
His honour in addressing the jury said, we have now been engaged
many hours in one of the most important cases which has ever come
under our notice since there has been a supreme court in New South
Wales ; the case has excited considerable interest, and you were warned
at the outset to throw aside any impression which might have been
made by hearing or reading descriptions on this affair. I hope you
will not be offended when I recall to your minds, that each of you
when entering that box invoked God to witness that he would be
determined by the evidence, and return a verdict according to the
substance of that evidence ; if that were not so; if it were possible a
jury could be biassed by out-door impressions and return a verdict not
according to the evidence, our dearest rights were at stake, and public
justice was a farce. It was clear that a most grievous offence has
been committed ; that the lives of near 30 of our fellow creatures have
been sacrificed, and in order to fulfil my duty, I must tell you that
the life of a black is as precious and valuable in the eye of the law, as
that of the highest noble in the land. The black is answerable for
his crimes, and some short time since, before I had the honour of
occupying my present scat on this bench, a man, a native was executed
for the murder of a white man. Having made these observations for
the benefit of the public as well as the prisoners, I will call your
attention to the evidence, and leave you to discharge your duty
by considering whether the prisoners at the bar were the parties


who comipitted the crime ■which has hccn proved. • I agree, said
his honour with the learned counsel for the defence, that a man
cannot be committed for manslaughter or murder before a body is
found ; therefore the point you have just to determine is, whether Daddy
was the unfortunate man who lost his life as set forth in the indictment,*
or whether a man, whose name is unknown to the Attorney-General,'
came to his death by violent means from the prisoners hands. He'
added, that in some of the counts the prisoners were charged as ac-
cessaries only, but ho observed that although they were charged as
accomplices only, yet accomplices were by the law held to be principals,
and if found guilty, subject to the same punishment. He mentioned
and anecdote on this subject, which occurred while he was in England
practising at the bar.—A young man named Lewston, went out with
some companions for the purpose of committing a burglary, at the time
they determined upon the robbery they contemplated no violence. On
arriving at the house in question, the noise they made attracted the at-
tention of the owner, who arose, opened a window, and put out his
head, and was immediately shot dead by one of the party. They were
all apprehended, and although charged only as accessaries, were found
guilty and hanged for the murder as principals.
His Honour summed up at great length, minutely recapitulating the
whole of the evidence, and the jury returned a verdi3t of—Not Guilty,
after having retired about a quarter of an hour.
The prisoners were all remanded for trial on the same charges, the
Crown Officers being dissatisfied with the verdict, it is their intention
to indict the prisoners for the murder of an aboriginal woman, and to
call the same evidence in support of the case. The trial is to take
place on Monday next.
