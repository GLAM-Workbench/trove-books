THE GREY KIMONA.
[Scene — An open space, at back centre a raised stone dais, on which is seated
the Damio , an aged roui of sinister aspect. By him guards, etc. To
the right the women of Kissikissi, to the left the men. The men and
women are throughout the first part of the act desirous of embracing
each other, but are prevented by the soldiers , who threaten them with
their spears. ]
Chorus (appealing to the Damio, who sits unmoved).
We haven’t been kissed since yesterday—
A state of things preposterous—
What will our husbands and sweethearts say?
Their feelings must really be boisterous.
Oh, Damio ! alter thy dread decree ;
Or, Damio, else thy people will be
O’erstepping the bonds of morality
Oh, Darai
(with a profound salaam) Oh, Damio !
Damio ( stolidly ) —
I’ve said it once, and, though my voice be broken,
I’ll sing to you the dread decree I have already spoken.
( The people bow resignedly.)
(The Damio sings with some animation, closely watching the effect of his
points on the people, who display keen interest in his statement, and
evidently satisfy themselves that the Damio has made out a very good
case for himself.)
Solo (Damio)—
When a personage is cousin to the sun,
' And connected with the moon and all the stars ;
When a sprig of Royalty hasn’t any family,
Oh, his finer sensibilities it jars.
Damio— t , ~
So I have said
That, until she be wed,
The person who kisses
Maid, Master, or Missus,
Will certainly lose his head.
(At ‘ ‘ his head ” the people indicate, with a quick motion of the hand, the
act of decapitation.)
When a personage has lots of things to leave
Such as diamonds and diadems and pearls^
And he hasn’t got a son fit to take the business on,
Well! he’s got to go and marry off his girls !
(Cho. and Damio as before .)
And when he’s got one daughter just like me,
Who refuses to get married when she’s told —
Who insists the man who woos her for herself alone must
choose her —
Do you wonder if a doting father scold ?
(Clio, and Damio as before.)


Dam io ( suavely ) —
Not such a very hard decree, after all, for when people get to
kisses they generally do lose their heads; but— {grimly) —on this
occasion it will be with a— (draws his sword quickly and whirls it over his
head, while the people shrink in terror, and the women shriek timidly and,
turning away their heads, cover their eyes with their fans. After a short
pause, he continues quite pleasantly, and lowering the point of his sword).
—That’s all, my loving subjects ; in matters like this I consider that
sharp— (tries the edge of the sword with his left thumb) —measures are
best.— f Sheathes sword, and fairly beams with geniality.)
What is life without kisses ? Like somebody’s soap—once used
always used—and no home can be happy without them. — (Rising and
settling the folds of his dress) —So —(descending from the dais and taking
a position among his guards, who face O.P.) —set your wits to work and
get my daughter married.— [Exit, with attendants. ]
(The people look fearfully after him, and approach each other stealthily
and timidly, as the music of the Damio's march fades in the distance.
One woman approaches the centre of the stage, and with a pretty
grimace.)
0 My—
Here’s a nice state of affairs ! Who is Kissime that her romantic
sentiments should interfere with our —(she is stuck for a word: every-
body looks at each other).
Kitm So—
Our private arrangements ?
0 My—
Thank you, Kura So ! —our private arrangements ? What will our
friends say ?—what can we say ?
Ickle Sing—
We can’t be always saying “ don’t,” 0 My.
Kum So
I was getting married just wdien the decree was published, and
of course —(with a deprecatory wave of the hands —everybody nods
sympathetically ).
O My—
I was (hesitatingly) was getting engaged when the decree was
published, and of course —(bursts into tears and led aside by women who
seek to console her—everybody shows great sympathy).
Omnes—
Oh ! of course.
Kum So (with some warmth ) —
Of course we’ll have to do something.
Ickle Sing—
Oh we’re sure to —I hope it won’t get any of us into trouble—but
we can’t stand this sort of thing very long— (weeps, the women are
inclined to weep in sympathy, and the men who much moved are consoling
them as much as they may. They throw each other kisses, and kissing
their fans convey thet?i to each otheds mouths. Kum So kisses the sleeve
of Ickle Sing’s kimona and lays it on her lips. She kisses zvit.h a
disappointed eagerness).
Kum So—
Not very satisfying, but strictly within the law.
Ickle Sing—
There is no harm in kissing people’s clothes.


in my time :
O.M. -
TILL THE SHADOWS FLEE AWAY.
“Just listen, — ”
When ababv—well, I was’nt quite not too bad,
You will really not believe me when I say —
Cho. —“Leon!” .
When quite a little chap upon m3' nurse’s lap,
I woulddift my chubby hands to her and say :
Oh you—
Giddy little thing, . •
Tuck your little sugar-baby underneath your wing,
Kiss his pretty rosy lips fondle him and sing
Till the shadows flee away.
“ And again— ”
When I grew a little chap of ten or twelve
I was popular with all the little girls—
Cho. —“ That’s so !”
I’d worship them for weeks and kiss their pinky cheeks,
’ And toy with their black Japanny curls.
Oh you —
Naughty little thing,
Tuck me like a sugar-bab}' underneath your wing,
Let me kiss your rosy lips, cuddle you and sing
Till the shadows flee away.
“ One minute, ”
When I got a little wifey of my own,
I was really quite a model married man.
Cho. —“ You were !”
Though my wife was very fair, I had always love to spare,
It’s the way we manage matters in Japan,
Always,—
One upon the string,
One to tuck her underneath her wing,
4 One to kiss his rosy lips, hug him tight and sing
Till the shadows flee away.
I believe I have kissed all your grandmothers, etc.


Kum So lays the sleeve of her kimono, across her lips and kisses her.
ICK.EE SING — .
Wait a minute, dear, I have a lace handkerchief—f lays it on Ins
Ups , selecting the most open part of the design , and kisses him).
Kum So—
That was better !
0l Very nearly the real thing. Now, to put a stop to these contra-
band practices, I would suggest —
Omnbs— Yes ! yes !! yes !!! —(hurriedly, and bending forward to hear him).
° TjD M That some disinterested person gets Kissime to fall in love with
him !
Omnbs (clapping their hands jubilantly)
Yes, yes ! that’s the idea.
O.M.—
And if I were a few years younger—
Ickle Sing ( jeeringly)
You'would still be old enough to be her grandfather.
Q
Y«rv likely and even then not have wit enough to be her
husband-there ’is no need for me to interfere 1 . hav ®
had my share of kisses in my time—l believe I have hissed
all your grandmothers—quite a number of times— {The people
wax' indignant, but the old man , smilingly , goes on)— and have no
desire to deprive younger men, of whom the —( bowing to both sides
ironically)—there are several her e—(quickly and dramatically with
upraised hand and voice)- and the one who captures Kissime becomes
the successor to the Damio !
rEnter the Boss, manager of the World-famed galaxy of Stars. He is dressed in a
white linen suit, white soft hat, blue puggaree with white stars, white boots, stars
and stripes necktie, and carries an American flag handkerchief, distinctly American
in speech and manner.]
The Boss (taking off his hat and bowing to the ladies) —
Oh ! I beg your pardon, but can you —
O.M. ( interrupting and dropping on his knees)—
Oh cousin of the moon, and lover of all the stars —
T.B. (aside) —
Now how did this chap know I’m running a variety show— [to
0.M.) but—say can you?
Ickle Sing (running up to him and coquettishly over her fan)
Oh, wonderful among men, we can do everything but kiss.
rp g
Now that’s wonderful among women —but (quickly and pointing off)
p ve gome friends out here who have graduated in every boarding
school church choir, and theatrical company from Kalamzoo to
• Michigan—they will undertake your instruction on the most reason-
able terms and give you a written guarantee for five years— (the
temptation is too great for him — he attempts to kiss her). You see its
this way !
(Ickle Sing avoids him while everybody covers their eyes and sin icks ! T. B.
looks surprised).


I.S.—
Oh, miserable man ! —whoever kisses or is kissed until the
daughter of the Damio be married ( loudly and dramatically) —loses his
head !
T.B. {with joyful acquiescence) —
Just me—every time I see a pretty girl I lose my head.
{Ominous silence).
( The old man takes him aside and in expressive pantomime explains how
the head gets lost).
T.B.—
Eh ! — (not quite understanding).
(Pantomime repeated. T.B. looks enquiringly at the people, who also
pantomime and nod their heads affirmatively.)
T.B. {quite sobered) —
Urn !
O.M. (insinuatingly and tapping the Boss with his forefinger) —
Among these friends of yours —are there any who can make love ?
T.B.—
I should smile — (looks at the people, who wink reassuringly, and the
women blow kisses, he recovers his sprightliness, and slapping the old man
on the back, laughs loudly). —I see! why we are professionals —Here!
hi— {whistles).
[Enter from right troupe of men and women, bright costumes, exclamation of
admiration ; the Japs cry, and the Americans openly expressing their preference
for this or that man or woman. The Japs have withdrawn to a long line, extend-
ing ooncavely from the left front to the back right of the stage ; the old man and
the Boss are middle-centre.]
T.B. ( warningly ) —
Here, now, none of that; there’s been somebody passing ridi-
culous by-laws against kissing.
Allan Love —
Against kissing ?
T.B.—
Yes ! if you are caught kissing, you lose your head.
Miss Comet Bright (with a little cake walk and a high kick ) —
Oh, that’s nothing —everybody loses their head over me.
T.B. (with pantomime, while the Japs look on with wonderment ) —
But this time it will be with an axe.
Comet (horrified, and picking up her skirts to run) —
Oh, I say, boys, where does the next boat start from ?
(As she runs off a man seizes the tail of her frock, a woman catches his jacket,
a man her skirts, and the old man addressing the Comet, she abandons
her flight, and crosses to centre to listen to him.)
O.M. —
0 Queen of all the Stars, it is this way ! Our Damio is an elderly
man, with only one daughter, and he is desirous of seeing her married,
and the Damioship settled on her husband before he dies. She has
imbibed some ridiculous Western ideas, and refuses to marry anyone
unless he marries her for herself alone. - ( The American women and
men pity his ignorance, the old man misunder standing their nods and
winks—apologetically. ) —It is difficult to make love to the daughter of
a Damio without thinking of the right of succession.
Americans—Oh, of course.


T.B. (caressing his chin meditatively, and looking round at his friends) —
Um ! Boys, what do you say ?
A Man —
If it were made worth our while.
O.M.—
You will be successors to the Damio !
Allan Love
And the lady were really lovable ?
0 M.—
She is lovelier than a Christmas card !
T.B.—
And reasonably young ?
O.M.
That also has been attended to, and if either of you gentlemen
have a way with the ladies—
T.B.—
A way with the ladies !
Song — T.B. and Allan Love, “ALWAYS MY WAY.”
T.B.—
I’ve a most irresistible manner,
Which the ladies declare is O.K. ;
They tootle upon the pianner,
And I stand behind them and say—
Let’s do it again both together,
The room is so frightfully warm ;
Supposing we wandah out on the verandah
For a breath of fresh air—take my arm.
(The Company act the business in pantomime, and repeat the chorus. )
Ah, really now, do,
De-lighted, I’m sure;
Lovely night—stars as bright
As your eyes, but not quite so pure.
No —no one can see.
Ah ! don’t run away.
What ! Certainly, every time —that’s always my way.
Allan Love —
I’ve an excellent eye for beauty ;
You should see me giving them thrills
Through their chiffon corsages and flounces,
Their open-work socks and their frills.
If you saw me got up for the evening
You’d think me the King of Siam ;
You have no idea of how I can be —ah—
The heart-desolator I am.
Ah ! how do you do ?
Beg pardon, I’m sure ;
Lovely day : what do you say
To a strawberry-ice or liqueur ?
Don’t crowd you like that !
What name did you say ?
White—certainly ! mine’s Brown—that’s always my way.


T.B.—
I’m great in demand where a dance is,
The darlings declare I’m divine ;
At waltzes, mazurka and lancers
Their step goes so nicely with mine ;
And at supper try some mayonaise—do,
And ( whistle) waiter ! one gold top —no, two ;
So the dear chaperone gets one on her own,
Which just gives her something to do.
Ah ! aw’fly hot—
Much nicer out here ;
Lovely ball - wear this shawl—
Yes ! the best dance of the year —
You leave her to me,
I know what to say
One, two, three, four, five, six—that’s always my way.
Dance and General Exit.
[Enter Kissimk in a pettish humour. She is wearing a Grey Kimona and carries a fan
in her left hand and a samisen slung over her shoulder. The women of Kissikissi
—in bright costumes—follow her. She fidgets considerably while they sing.]
Cho.—
0 Kiss-i-me San, 0 Kiss-i-me San,
Although you may look with distaste on man,
Remember we’re built on a different plan,
0 Kiss-i-me, Kiss-i-me San.
0 Kiss-i-me San your name should show
The absolute way your tastes should go,
We’ve hearts to let and that you know
Means kisses, 0 Kiss-i-me San.
She remains obdurate and they exit singing. Kissime looks after them ,
and after assuring herself that she is unobserved, approaches the centre.
Kiss. —
I also have a heart to let —
Solo— A HEART TO LET.
A heart, a heart to let;
Delightfully situate
In a charming neighbourhood—
In the sweetest neighbourhood—
Not far from two rosy lips,
Not far from a dimpled chin,
Not far from two roguish eyes where ships
Of love go sailing out and in,
A heart, a heart to let.
A heart, a heart to let, to let,
A chance like this is seldom met,
The owner, most unfortunate,
Now offers this heart to let ;
The sort of heart to suit a man
Who seeks to try connubial life,
A love to let for all my life, a heart to let from now.


A heart, a heart to let,
In the sweet enclosure set
Of a young and innocent breast—
Decidedly innocent breast—
It has never been occupied,
There are beautiful views all round,
A well of love that has never been tried,
A source of happiness most profound,
A heart, a heart to let.
A heart, etc.
A heart, a heart to let,
The tenant of which will get
The most convenient terms —
Almost nominal terms—
Though the property won’t be sold ;
The tenant may sit rent free,
So long as he’ll promise to have and hold
No one in his heart of hearts but me,
A heart, my heart to let.
A heart, etc.
[Enter Allan Love peering about the ground—Kissime peeps at him through her fan.]
A.L.—
Idr opt my cigarette case hereabout— ( noticing Kissime) —Ah—h !
—one of those delightful little singing girls— (raising his hat and
advancing). Beg pardon—but—-a—did you—
K. f coquettishly ) —
No— not yet !
A.L. ( embarrassed ) —
Well ! —are you going to ?
K. ( demurely ) —
What?
A.L. (aside) —
Isn’t she pretty —( coming closer ) —well the fact is I’m—( looks round
to see if he is unobseiwed) I’m looking—-for—-
K. (calmly)—
What are you looking for ?
A.L.—
A kiss— (bending towards her) —
K. (seriously) —
Don’t you know that kissing is prohibited until—until the
daughter of the Damio be married ?
A.L. (quite close to her) —
Yes; isn’t it ridiculous *>.—(takes her hand) —They shouldn’t let a
pretty girl like you walk about loose while such a preposterous
regulation is in force —( puts his arm round her waist; they lean towards
each other quite lovingly) —l shouldn’t wonder if, in the event of a
conviction, the Government would not be held criminally liable as an
accessory before the fact—and I believe I’d get thumping damages,
too !
K. (slyly)
But you haven’t broken the law yet !


A.L. ( laughingly ) —
No ; but — [kisses her) —I have now !
[Enter the old man. Kissime runs off before he recognises her, but Allan Love stands
as the old man advances, pointing an incriminating forefinger at him.]
O.M. -
Young man, you are in danger of losing your head.
A. L. —
Old man, I am in danger of losing my heart.
O.M.—
A mere bagatelle compared with the other possibility. A man
may lose his heart that way a hundred times a day, but he loses his
head—( business ) —this way —only once.
(Damio's March heard off.)
The Damio approaches—Pray to all your gods, young man, that
you or your friends may render his decree obsolete—( turns to the
approaching procession, while A.L. walks nonchalantly off).
Music— Enter the Damio and suite, with Kissime borne in a kago—all ga}’ costumes—
executioner with a huge sword and dressed in black, With red ornaments. Damio
and daughter ascend dais, the rest group themselves, also the populace. The
O.M. centre, salaaming.
Damio —
Well, have you done anything ?
Old Man—
O Effulgence, we have done everything but kiss.
Damio —
Um —for your own sakes, I trust you speak the truth, and we are
here to learn what you have done towards averting what is almost a
national calamity —( all affected almost to tears , except Kissime).
O.M.—
Oh, great Damio \—[soh) —as your admirable daughter has not—
(sob)—not looked favorably on any of her subjects— (cheerfully) —we
have brought the stars of all the skies to display their excellencies
before her.
Damio —
Now, that’s business—let them twinkle !
[Enter the troupe, carrying the situation with assurance ; they look admiringly at the
people and make eyes at each other. The Damio cranes his neck to get a good
look at Miss Comet Bright. T.B. whispers A.L., who is looking for the grey
kimona.]
T.B. —
Say ! isn’t she a beauty ?
Comet —
Some of these Jappy chappies are too sweet for anything.
T.B. (to the Damio — bowing) —
Sar !
O.M. (prompting) —
Say 1 ‘ Brother of the Sun. ”
T.B. (to O.M.) — x
Why he’s a member of my own lodge (he rattles off the rhst of his
speech with some familiarity). Brother of the Sun, for the past five
years I’ve been Grand Majisterial Walking Delegate of the Sun Lodge
Benefit and Assurance Society of Porktown, N.J., and am now touring
the world with a galaxy of stars able to eclipse anything in your
planisphere ; and if your beautiful and accomplished daughter will
overlook the eonsanguinuity that must exist between a neice of the
Sun and the other members of the planetary system —


Damio —
Don’t talk so much—do something— {pointing)— is this a star ?
T.B.—
Yes ! a fixed star—she’s the manager’s wife !
Damio —
Dear me !—and this? (pointing to Comet, who tosses her head and
turns away from him).
T.B. —
Is—something in the comet line.
Damio —
How very interesting. (To T.B.)— When I was a young man I
had a very fine collection of—comets. But I found I was losing my
grip —I mean, my head; so I gave them up some time ago. (To
Comet ) Come and sit by me, my dear !
(Comet shakes her head , advances to centre for song.)
Song , Comet —
WHEN THE FISH DON’T BITE.
When a man gets out his hooks and line ,
And procures a pocketful of prawns,
Kisses his dear wife good-bye,
Says “ Expect me by-and-bye ;
You get out the fryingpan—
I’m a proper fisherman —
Ta-ta, it’s right! ”
He baits his hook, so carefully,
And drops his line, so gentilly,
And sits up all night,
But the fish don’t bite.
They’ve had that sort of thing before —
They’re not having any more ;
They’re all right;
It’s most absurd—
It is, upon my word.
The hook’s all bright and right, and the bait’s quite
fresh and nice,
But hooks and baits won’t cut any ice
When the fish don’t bite.
When a man gets up a syndicate
To float a gold mine at Albert Park,
Tells his friends, “ This is O.K. ;
Things I touch will always pay ;
Here’s the assay, here’s the plan
If you’d le a monied man,
Take shares—it’s right.”
Prospectus reads, so smoothily,
Leases coloured, so pinkily,
But his gills go white
When the fish don’t bite.


They’ve been at the game before—
They’re not having any more.
Mine’s all right,
It’s sure to pay—
Fortune in’t, they say.
But a man may talk and talk till his lips rub his teeth
quite clean; •
But he can’t float mines when it’s plainly seen
That the fish won’t bite.
Now, Smith believed he'd like a holiday—
He’d fixed it with a little tart he knew ;
Told his wife —“ You’re looking sick ;
Say, You’d better take a week
Up the Mountains with the kids ;
I’d go too, but where’s the quids ?
The money’s tight.
You have a good time, dear—you’ll see
I’ll rub along all right.” said he.
But he didn’t—not quite—-
For the fish wouldn t bite.
She’d had tales like that before,
And wouldn’t have them any more.
Dog wouldn’t fight—
It seemed a shame—
Smith was not to blame —
Now his wife has got her eye on him most suspiciously,
And he meets the tart surreptitiously.
Cause the fish wouldn’t bite.
Damio—
If that is your idea of an alluring picture of connubial content,
I’m afraid you’re out of it—try something else.
Ballet —stiggestive of suppi'essed kisses — Comet pas de seul. Damio
throws kisses to her , and is with difficulty restrained from joining her.
He rises and throws kisses after her as she exits. Kissimi pulls him down
on his seat. He if annoyed.
Damio—
It is quite ridiculous, Kissime ; you are causing me—l mean my
people—great inconvenience—making everybody feel most uncom-
fortable ; you heartless girl; it is easily seen that you have not got
your father’s affectionate nature— [still looking where the Cotnet went
off). —You must get married. I can’t go back on my decree—and
I’m feeling quite uncomfortable—l feel I’m losing my head —(holds
his head with his hands ; all much affected).
[Ester a Soldier, dragging in Miss Comet and a Jap. Noble.]
T. B. ( shewing his American handkerchief —
Hands up !
{All fallflat on the stage with hands up except Damio and Kissime,
and Soldier and Noble.)
Damio —
Unhand her, villain ! —lt’s all right, Boss. Come and sit by me,
Comet. Soldier, what was the matter ?—{the people rise). )
Soldier—
0, Damio !
Heedless of thy dread decree, I found these people


Damio—
Not! Ah not —ah not each other kissing.
Oli, soldier, tell me anything but that.
People ( appealingly ) —
Oh, soldier, tell him anything but that.
Solo, Damio—
Observe my hair untimely grey,
—Believe me, soldier, when I sing—
That fondly to the hope 1 cling
It is not that you mean to say.
Believe me, soldier, love has been
My sweet familiar many years,
And levied toll of smiles and tears
With cash instalments in between.
But never have I faltered in
—Believe me, soldier, when I sing—
The cherished hope to which I cling
That woman’s lips are hard to win.
Soldiek—
Mine eyes with sympathy are dim,
-—Believe me, Damio, when I sing—
The very words my heart doth wring,
I saw the lady kissing him.
Damio ( to Comet) —
Say he lies,
Oh, Comet Bright, deny it.
Solo, Comet—
Ah no ! it is true,
What could I do.
I’d never kissed in kimonas before,
And if my head
Goes off I’m afraid
I'll never kiss anyone anymore.
Never, no never,
Forever and ever
The roots of the rose on my cold lips may lie
But the scent and the bloom
Shall be shut from the tomb
That contains the remains of my kisses and I.
Damio—
lamin a most awkward position—l’m afraid the law will have to
take its course Executioner!— [he comes forward)— that man is too
tall; make him a head shorter !—( The American women shriek as the
Executioner advances baring his arm).
T.B. [stepping before him)
Not this time.
Damio—
Unless my daughter marries.
Kiss. ( rising ) —
Then I will marry to-day [pointing to A.L.) —I will marry him.
[Executioner retires .) •
A.L. [with deference) —
Pardon me, fair lady ; I already am in love, and unless 1 may
wed the maid in the GREY KIMONA [dramatically)— 1 will lose
my head.


THE GREY KIMONA.
She wore a grey kimona
The only time we met,
Her sloe-black eyes were gleaming
Beneath their brows of jet.
I saw her but a moment, ,
But I loved her there and then,
In her simple grey kimona
And her tinkling samist-n.
She was only a poor little singing girl,
Nor rank, nor wealth had she,
But her eyes were bright with the light of love,
And her lips were swmet to me.
So I will marry no princesses ;
Oh, give me the girl again
In the simple grey kimona
And the tinkling samisen.
Cho. :
K. (in assumed anger) —
And thus you spurn my^beauty.
( To the Damio, but keeping her gaze on A.L.)
Oh, Damio ! bid the headsman do his duty.
Damio ( nervously ) —
But, ray dear—The Comet will have to go to, and I want to start
collecting again—l don’t think she would be any good without a head.
Comet (to A.L.) —•
Why don’t you marry the girl—you’d look lovely in her dad’s
clothes —and just look at her lovely eyes !
A.L. & Kissime, duet—
A.L.— Kiss.—
Her lovely eyes, oh lady, But were her eyes, oh stranger,
Were black as thine; More black than mine,
Her lips, as sweet as rosebud leaves, I think my lips, as rosebud leaves,
Rrt-ssed close to mine. Would taste as fine.
She wore no broi iered robe of state, I’ll cast aside my robe of state,
No pride of birth had she, And once again I’ll be
But the girl in the grey kimona The girl in the grey kimona
Is the one girl for me. And the one girl for thee.
She throws off her robe and appears in the grey kimona of her first
entrance. Chorus and dance as they rush to each other's arms , and The
Damio and The Comet, A.L. and Kissime, T. 8., 0 My, Kum So, and
Ickle Sing advance to front of stage.
Now, here’s how a thing like this should end,
With everyone happy and kisses in plenty ;
For each kiss I refused you, I’ll give you, my friend,
A hundred-and-twenty, a hundred-and-twenty.
Kiss ! Kiss ! Kiss ! Kiss !
There’s nothing in life so delightful as this—
There’s nothing one misses like kisses, kiss, kiss us,
The wide world over it’s kiss ! kiss! ! kiss ! ! !
CURTAIN.


The Centenary.
A JUBILANT RHYME.
BY HENRY HALLORAN, C.M.G.
1.
Let a voice go forth
And a song be heard.
Like the song of a bird.
To the lands of the north ;
To the lands of the east and the lands of the west.
The voice of a people the Lord hath blessed.
2,
Darkness has fled in a hundred years—
A hundred years of toil and hope ;
And now may we cope
With whatever appears.
And carry, in honor, beneath the sun.
The mighty Present our hands have won.
3.
Fling out the banner.
Let the trumpet be heard
Of a nation that stirr’d.
In a marvellous manner,
From darkness and silence, long years a r o.
Until now it is ready for friend or for foe.
4.
Whence came ye, my brothers.
Brave sons of to-day P
From lands far away
Came your fathers and mothers ;
Great lands thro’ long centuries holding their
own, °
The workers of works, and the strength of the
Throne.
5.
And where go ye, I say ?
Stand by the right;
Look to the light.
As forward ye march in the face of day.
To build up a nation, a mighty one,
A Southern Britain with brighter sun
6.
Hold ye together.
True to each other
As brother to brother.
In every weather—
Australian, Victorian, Queenslander, I cry •
And your banded strength shall the world defy.




7.
A hundred years for us, one and all.
Who, with heart and hand.
Made this bounteous land
A refuge for all, both great and small.
With plenty for all who will toil and be
True to themselves and true to the free.
8.
The tramp of armies comes not near;
But the flags of the world
May here be unfurl’d ;
With their commerce and trade may gather here.
And we welcome them all
As friends, great and small.
9.
A hundred years have pass’d away;
Look back, if you can.
And speak like a man,
Altho’ you be stricken with age and grey.
Have we not raised, as men should do,
A home for the many, and not for the few ?
10.
Fling out the banner again and again.
With the trumpet’s tongue
Stirring old and young
To toil for this goodly land amain ;
Faint hearts we need not, weak hands may go,
For we’ll fight for our land with every foe!
11.
Sons of hope, and sons of toil.
Sons of toil and sons of hope.
Be ready to cope.
And to win for your country the victor’s spoil.
If seasons famish, if droughts should drain.
Take your cross on your shoulders and strive
again.
12.
O, Lord of Light, may the advancing years.
The coming century’s auspicious birth—
The present passed away as earth to earth.
With smiles of joy as well as sorrow’s tears—
Us, thy glad people in thy keeping see.
Faithful and just, united, brave and free.
January, 1888.
