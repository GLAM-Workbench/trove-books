張良和 黃石公
DIANG LIANG AND WHANG HSI GUNG
Djang Liang, a student, was walking along one day
when he came to a bridge and saw an old man sitting there
with his shoe on the ground in front of him. With unusual
courtesy Djang Liang stooped and put the shoe on the foot
of the old man, who was really one of the Sages in disguise.
The sage was so pleased with this act of courtesy that he told
the boy to come to the bridge very early the next morning and
he would tell him what would affect his whole life. The boy
went to the bridge very early, but the sage was there ahead of
him, and all he received that morning was a lecture on his lazy
habits. He was told to go again, and the next morning went
at dawn, but still the Sage was ahead of him and he was
reprimanded very severely this time and told to come again
on the third morning. This time the boy went to the bridge
right after his supper, and spent the night there! When the
Sage came at dawn he was greatly pleased to find Djang Liang
there ahead of him, and gave him instruction of such value
that when he grew up he became a great general.








韓信 和少年
HAN HSIN AND HSIAO NIEN
Han Hsin was a mighty man of valor. No one could beat
him in a fight, but Hsiao Nien, a young and boastful fellow
came to Han Hsin and challenged him to a fight. He told
Han Hsm that if he were defeated he would not object in
the least if his head were cut off, but that if he won then
Han Hsm would have to get down and crawl between his
knees! Han Hsm looked at the young fellow and thought
what a pity to kill so fine a young man, and knew that
he could easily defeat him, yet did not care to do so. So,
he got down and crawled between the legs of the young
man! Han Hsm lost face so he had to retire,
but not for long, as an enemy lord soon attack-
ed his overlord and he was summoned to help. He soon
led the army to victory and was raised to a very high posi-
tion. Then, saying that he would rather be the friend than
the enemy of Hsiao Nien, he sent for him and made him
ruler over a small section of the country.








王阑 龐涓 孫 臏
OUTWITTING OF WANG SHEN
The Sage Wang Shen had two disciples, —Sen Bin and
Pan Djuen. One day they came along and found him sitt-
ing in a cave. Wishing to test their ingenuity, he told them
that neither of them could make him leave this cave. They
tried every way they could, but to no avail. One said, O
come out and see those two dragons fighting on the hills!
But the sage did not believe him. The other said. “Now you
will have to come out, for here comes the neighboring lord
and his retinue. You will have to come and receive him.”
“Not I," said Wang Shen “for that lord has just gone past
here within the hour.” “Well,” said one in despair, “If only I
could get you out once, 1 could make you go back in again.”
At once the sage came out of the cave. “Now, make me go
back in again.” “Ah, no,” said the disciple, “All I really
wanted was to get you out! ”

棍 瓜
HOW THE FROGS GOT THEIR CROAK
An old man and his wife were walking over a bridge.
Stooping to look over the railing, the woman drooped her
melon (gwa) and in trying to get it back the man lost his
staff (“Gwer” in N. China). Then in attempting the rescue
of his staff the man fell into the water. The woman tried
to save him and also fell m and both were drowned. The
gods in pity changed them into frogs, and now the old woman
cries “Gwa ; gwa, I want my gwa,!’ while her husband hoarsely
shouts, “Gwer, gwer, gwer.” The combined sounds come to
be “Gwa-gwer, gwa-gwer, gwa-gwer-r-r” to
the end of time.

The water rushed out and the child’s life was saved. Clever
Si Mah Gwang later became a ruler.
