COMPANY, LIMITED.
DEED OF SETTLEMENT, AND RESOLUTIONS PASSED

AND 22nd FEBRUARY, 1866.




DEED OF SETTLEMENT.
The alterations and words in italics, in Clauses 1,5, 6, 17, 18, 19, 45, and 66, were
made and inserted in accordance with Resolutions passed 12 th August, 1857,
and 22nd February, 1866.
CijiS EiiU fixture, made the 13th day of
December, A.D. 1851, between the several persons
whose names are hereunto subscribed and seals affixed :
except George Coppard, of No. 7, Enfield Road North,
Kingsland, Middlesex, gentleman ; and Francis Vickery,
of Rodney Cottage, Stockwell Park Road, Surrey, ac-
countant, of the first part; —Sir William Foster, of the
city of Norwich, Baronet; Henry William Schneider,
of New Broad Street Mews, in the City of London,
merchant; John Diston Powles, of Austin Friars, in
the City of London, merchant; and Henry Ewbank, of
Idol Lane, in the City of London, merchant, of the
second part; —the said Greorge Coppard, of the third
part; and the said Francis Vickery, of the fourth part.
the said several parties hereto of
the second part, have at and up to the date of these
presents been engaged in carrying on the business of
copper smelters and refiners, in partnership, in or upon
certain works and premises situate at Spitty Bank, near
Llanelly, in the county of Carmarthen, and at Loughor,
near Swansea, in the county of Glamorgan, in the
principality of Wales, called the Spitty Copper Works;
and at and upon divers other works and premises, situate
respectively at Port Adelaide, near the city of Ade-
laide, in the colony of South Australia; at Port Wake-


field, in the same colony; at Kooringa, near the said
city of Adelaide, in the same colony, and elsewhere in
the same colony.
the aforesaid business, and in par-
ticular the branch thereof carried on in South Aus-
tralia, hath of late considerably increased, and is still
increasing; and it is anticipated that in consequence
of the discovery of other metal ores in Australia the
business of smelting and refining minerals in that
colony will increase still further; and in order to meet
such anticipated increase, and to enable the investment
of new and additional capital in the said business to
the extent that such increase would probably require,
it has been considered expedient by the said respective
persons parties hereto of the second part, that the
aforesaid business should in future be carried on by a
Joint-Stock Company, constituted as hereinafter men-
tioned ; and for the purposes aforesaid, and for carry-
ing on the said business on a more extensive and
efficient scale, and for smelting, extracting, refining
and reducing not only copper, but also, at the
option of the Company, lead and other kinds of ore,
mineral, or metal (including the precious metals), or
such of the same branches of business as should from
time to time be judged expedient, and generally for
carrying on and conducting such business as is herein-
after mentioned and defined, it hath been resolved by
the said several persons parties hereto to form a Joint-
Stock Company, within the meaning of the Act of
Parliament passed in the 7th and Bth years of the
reign of her present Majesty, entituled “An Act for
the Registration, Incorporation, and Regulation of
Joint-Stock Companies;” and of another Act passed
in the 10th and 11th years of her said present Majesty,
entituled “An Act to amend an Act for the Registra-


tion, Incorporation, and Eegulation of Joint-Stock
Companies;” to be called “The English and Aus-
tralian Copper Company and on the 25th day of
November last, such Company was accordingly provi-
sionally registered under the said Acts, or one of them,
by the aforesaid name; and it is intended that such
Company shall be completely registered under the
same Acts as soon as conveniently may be; and that
eventually, and as soon as may be, an Act of Parlia-
ment, or Charter of Incorporation, shall be applied for,
for the more effectually constituting the said Company,
and enabling the purposes thereof to be effected and
obtained.
&II& totyrrra*, f° r further effectuating the aforesaid
purpose, it was agreed by and between the said persons
parties hereto of the second part, as such partners as
aforesaid on the one hand, and the registered promoter
of the said Company on the other part, that the good-
will of the aforesaid partnership business so carried on
as aforesaid by the said persons parties hereto of the
second part, and for the future carrying on of which
(among other things) the said Company is intended to
be formed as aforesaid, and the whole and entire part-
nership property and effects, including as well the

stock-in-trade, plant, and book and other debts, credits,
and liabilities of the said partnership, and all other the
estate and effects of the partnership whatsoever and
wheresoever, and of what nature or kind soever, should
be taken to and purchased by the said Company, and
for such purpose the same were estimated as between
the same parties (inclusively of the good-will of the
said business) at the sum of £306,108 3s. 1 IcZ.; and it
was agreed by the said parties respectively that the
capital of the said Company should be £350,000,

follows, that is to say, the sum of £2 10s. on each such
share at the time of allotment, or the complete registra-
tion of the Company, whichever should last happen, and
the further sum of £2 10s. on each such share (being
the entire residue thereof), on or before the expiration
of three calendar months from the time of allotment,
or such complete registration as aforesaid, whichever
should last happen; and that provision to the above
effect should be made by the Deed of Settlement of the
Company, and that such capital of £350,000 should be
subject to a provision enabling addition to be made
thereto, under the restrictions and conditions to be
contained in the said Deed of Settlement. And it was
further agreed, by and between the said parties, that
the aforesaid purchase should be concluded on the terms
that the said persons parties hereto of the second part,
or some or one of them, should, on or before the com-
plete registration of the Company, take and subscribe
for (in the same manner and on the same footing as
other Shareholders) shares in the Company to the
extent in value of £200,000 at the least, and as the
consideration money for the aforesaid partnership busi-
ness and good-will, property, and effects, the sum of
£306,108 3s. 11 d. should be paid, or secured to be paid,

out of such net profits, in each and every such year as

of them, his executors, administrators, or assigns.

11th day of December instant, and made between the
said persons parties hereto of the second part of the
one part, and the registered promoter of the said Com-

Deed of Settlement thereof, that the net profits of the
Company’s business, during the last preceding year,
had to any extent exceeded the rate of £l5 per cent,
per annum on the said capital stock of £350,000 (the
whole of which capital was for that purpose to be con-
sidered as paid up at the complete registration of the
Company), then one equal half-part of the surplus
profits of any and every such year, over and above
a dividend after the aforesaid rate, should be paid
to the said persons parties hereto of the second part,
or the survivors or survivor of them, his executors,
administrators, or assigns, as and for their and his
own monies and property, in addition to any dividends
or dividend payable to the said persons respectively,
or any of them, as Shareholders or a Shareholder in
the Company; and that provision for that purpose
should be made by the Deed of Settlement of the
Company. And it was declared, that in case of the
decease of any or either of them the said persons parties
thereto of the first part before the whole of the monies
payable to them by virtue of that agreement should be
paid, the same should (notwithstanding the said part-
nership) be payable and paid to the survivors or sur-
