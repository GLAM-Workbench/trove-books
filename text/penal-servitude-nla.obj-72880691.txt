PENAL
SBRTITUPE!
I have just arrived from Australia,
Where I have been for change of air;
And, chaps, I have just come to tell you,
That there is a lot of jolly living over there.
CHORUS.
Where they feed you, and they clothe you.
Better than a working man or soldier-
Penal servitude is the sort of life for me ;
Then we do a bit of work just a portion of
the day,
And then we go to church upon a Sunday,ï¿½.
Man O, my yar, yar, yar, yar!
Give me penal servitude before the Union.
Four years ago at the Old Bailey,
The Jury found me guilty, I believe;
For ten years across the sea they sent me,
But I soon gets the ticket of leave.
As on my little game you?ve put a stopper.
For a time they?ve collar?d all in vain.
If I cannot earn an honest copper,
I?m in for penal servitude again.
Here?s to be a deal of reformation,
About reform you?ve often head a fuss.
And while you keep your paupers instarvation
You?re sure to be surrounded with coves
like us.
The Bobbies sometimes are very useful,
He can be either absent, deaf, or blind;
And if you?re collar?d by the handful,
A comfortable home you?re sure to find.
There is one little dodge I am thinking,
That would put your profession all to smash,
It would put on the kibosh like winking,
That is if they was to introduce the lash.
But still I can?t help laughing,
When I see your paupers look so pale;
There?s thousands in the workhouse
wane we live like lords in the jail.
It was cracking of a crib that they nailed me,
The swag was worth a thousand to me;
From business I thought of retiring, when
they collared me,
And sent me across the sea.
If when home you are returning,
If a Bobby sees you be is on your track,
He prevents you getting an honest living.
So to your to old trade you must go ba k.
