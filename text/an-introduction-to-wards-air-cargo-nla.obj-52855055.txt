This is how
it works.
Air cargo forwarding in its basic form is a
relatively simple operation. Customer in A-
town rings Wards branch, which directs
over radio the nearest van to collect the
consignment.
The van takes it to the airport where it is
put on the first available flight. Upon landing
in B-town, the plane is met by another
Wards van which takes the consignment to
the receiver’s door.
It sounds fairly simple, but it must be
remembered that a successful air
forwarding operation can not be restricted
to certain prime routes only. It must have
fully staffed and equipped operations in
almost every city and town in the country in
order to give its clients a complete service.
Wards Air Cargo is now by far the largest
air cargo forwarder in Australia, both in
terms of tonnage and in terms of branches
and personnel.
Although the basic movement is straight
forward as illustrated, the sheer size of the
operation requires a highly sophisticated
and efficient organisation. Not to mention
people who are fully versed with all aspects
of cargo handling.
The whole point of the business is to get a
consignment from one customer’s door to
someone clse’s door, perhaps 2000
kilometres away, in the shortest possible
time.
That requires alert telephone and radio
operators, drivers who know their cities or
towns well, operations people who know
every airline schedule by heart and
administrators who can keep the whole
thing moving without a hitch.
Wards Air Cargo is not aligned with any
one airline, so that all consignments are
despatched on the first available flights. In
many areas where scheduled flights arc
infrequent or lack cargo capacity, Wards
charter aircraft on a permanent basis, to
provide the fastest possible flow of air
cargo.
Because of the large fleet of chartered
aircraft and standby aircraft, the Wards
people have shown that they can keep the
normal flow of cargo moving at a normal rate
on all routes, even during lengthy
disruptions to commercial airline
schedules.


Gone are the days when people only considered
sending goods by air in cases of emergency or if no other
alternative existed. These days around 100 thousand
tonnes of cargo is sent by air in Australia each year,
some as express cargo and some on a regular overnight
basis. Wards express cargo can be delivered to almost
any location in the country on a “same day” basis. It is,
however, normal for goods picked up in the afternoon to
be delivered during the morning hours the following
day.
Time is indeed money in all areas of business. That is
where Wards can play a very important role in your
business and save you money, by getting a spare part
there sooner, or by getting samples to your sales
personnel on time, or vital documents to clients quickly,
or simply getting your goods to your clients, fast and
efficiently.
Anything from bulldozer tracks, to Siamese cats or
documents are handled by Wards every day. The size of
your consignment is only limited to the extent that it can
fit through an aircraft door. Larger consignments can
be airlifted by special arrangement.
Regular services such as company mail bags or E.D.P.
document handling is a speciality. Wards can provide
tailor made services with chartered aircraft for
collection and distribution of documents between a
company’s computer centre and its branches, in any
area of the country. A service which is of great
importance to government agencies, banks, building
societies, and large trading companies.
Booked Cargo and Booked Courier arc express
services where your consignment is picked up at your
door, booked over radio for first flight out and specially
transferred to other aircraft if applicable and met at
destination airport by special vehicle for immediate
delivery to receiver’s door. These services are available
for one simple charge, there are no extras or hidden
costs.
The door-to-door air cargo express
Wards guarantee delivery of goods on time,
everytime. They can do this, even when regular airline
services are not operating, because a large standby fleet
of chartered aircraft can be made operational on short
notice. This is why Wards guarantee delivery of your
goods once they have accepted your consignment.
NO PERFORMANCE - NO CHARGE!

A highly specialized service which plays a very
important role in the Wards International
division. Regular despatches of documents
through conventional channels are often
subject to delays and misplacements.
Wards World Couriers have developed
various methods of ensuring that documents
can be delivered to the door in many world
centres, unaffected by causes which would
halt or delay conventional despatches.
PROGRAMMED SERVICE
This is a door-to-door world wide document
delivery service between all major Australian
cities and towns and over 200 cities overseas.
A complete list of those cities and the
applicable courier rates, is available from your
Wards branch.
STANDARD SERVICE
This is designed as a relatively low cost but
fast and efficient service. Documents are
picked-up by our courier in Australia and go
right through the same courier system as for
the Programmed Service, including customs
and airport clearance, to our office in the
destination city. Here it is either hand-
delivered or forwarded to the Addressee
through Ist class local mail.
THE MULTIPAK SYSTEM
When you may wish to send several lots of
documents to different addresses, Multipak
offers an inexpensive but fast and reliable way
of despatch.
A minimum of ten separate envelopes,
addressed to an overseas area, will be picked
up by the Wards courier service and sent in
bulk through the normal courier system,
including customs clearance and delivered to
our office at the destination. From there the
individual envelopes will be sent Ist class local
mail to the addressees.
HAND HELD ALL THE WAY
There are times when documents or small
items are sufficiently urgent, and of such great
value, that it is advisable to have an
experienced staff courier carry it as personal
luggage to the destination city and deliver it
personally to the addressee. In the case of
destinations such as Singapore, Hong Kong
and London, to which there is a fairly large
courier traffic from Australia, the cost may not
be as high as expected because the staff
courier is often able to carry out multiple
assignments on the one trip. Contact our sales
department in any Australian capital city for
full details of this service and the others
described above.
Wards World Couriers


For the regular user of Wards World
Couriers, here are three document satchels
which will make life easier for you.
ONE WAY SATCHELS
These are pre-paid specially designed,
international courier satchels. Measuring 16"
x 12" and made from tough, water-resistant
Tyvak plastic material, they are ideal for
commercial documents.
The one-way satchels can be bought in any
quantity, and used as required. The price
includes the cost of the satchel itself, pick-up
at your door and transmission through our
“Standard Service” courier system. Prices for
this service to various parts of the world are on
the enclosed rate list.
The satchel once purchased is valid for
indefinite time, and a bulk purchase is
therefore a safeguard against future price
increases. There is no weight restriction, so
savings can be made over the Standard
Service rate.
MULTI-USE SATCHELS
These are tough and durable zip-up plastic
documents satchels with handles and a
protected label pocket. They are specially
designed to carry documents between head
office and branches, or between supplier and
client, on a regular basis. The label used may
have an address on each side so it can be
reversed as required. The courier service is
not pre-paid, but the customer pays for the
satchel itself. Two sizes are available.
5 kg capacity, cost $ 6.50
10 kg capacity, cost $lO.OO
FREE SATCHELS
Would you like something for nothing? Well,
here you are! Large envelopes, 40cm x 30cm
(16" x 12") made from tough Tyvak plastic and
attractively printed are yours for the asking.
They are ideal for consolidation of packets,
envelopes, plans, print-outs, tenders, legal
documents and reports for fast and
economical despatch locally and
internationally.
The free satchels can save you money
because you can include a number of different
items for the one address and save freight or
courier cost for each item. They save you time.
As separate items become ready for despatch
in your file, they can be inserted into the
satchel. At the end of the day, it is sealed and
you have a strong, secure consolidation bag.
One phone call and Wards will pick it up and
ensure its fast and safe delivery at the other
end. The satchels can be sent through both
‘Programmed’ and ‘Standard Service’just tick
the service required in the appropriate square.

The Wards company logo is
rapidly becoming one of the best
known in Australia. This is not due to
heavy exposure through media
advertising, but to the large fleet of
Wards vehicles which carries the
logo in every major town and city in
Australia. It is also appearing on
aircraft and buildings throughout the
country. Wards’ clients have
received a happy December greeting
for the last three years, in the form of
large posters featuring the logo
character.
