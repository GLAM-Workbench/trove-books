NOTES
The following lists include, as far as possible, all ships in service between
the years of the Peace of Munster (1648) and the death of the King-
Stadhouder William 111 (1702). Names are given in modern spelling.
Where a ship was known by two or more names, these have been mentioned.
For instance, the Wapen van Edam was sometimes called the Bui, because
the Arms of Edam, which were painted on the stern, showed a black bull
on a green meadow.
The Republic had five separate Admiralties—Amsterdam, the Maas
(Rotterdam), Zeeland, the Noorderkwartier (the part of the Province of
Holland to the north of Amsterdam) and Friesland. This accounts for the
fact that there were often several ships of one name in service at the same
time. The various Admiralties have been indicated by the appropriate
letters in the 4th column. Where the letter is followed by the abbreviation
“Dir.”, the ship belonged to one of the Directories, which were bodies
appointed by the sea-ports to provide ships for purposes of convoy.
The ships of Amsterdam were almost always built there, those of the
Maas at Rotterdam; while ships of Zeeland were usually built at Flushing,
but sometimes at Zierikzee and other places. Ships of the Noorderkwartier
might be built at Monnikendam, Hoorn, Enkhuizen or Medemblik; the
exact place is not often recorded. Friesland built its ships at Harlingen,
but may have used other ports in the earlier part of the century.
When the date is followed by an asterisk, it represents the first recorded
appearance of the ship. Otherwise, it is, as far as possible, the date of
launching. In a few instances some years elapsed between the launching
of a ship and her first commissioning.
The Dimensions given are the Length from the fore side of the stem to
the after side of the sternpost, the Beam inside the planking and the Depth
from the rabbet of the keel to the upper side of the beam amidships. They
are in Amsterdam feet of 283 mm. In a few cases, where Dimensions are
known only from English sources, they represent Keel-Length and Beam
taken in the English method and have been left in English feet of 305 mm.
Such cases have been indicated by the addition of the letter “E”.
