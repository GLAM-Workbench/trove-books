INTRODUCTION
TO ADDENDA 1784-1850
John Alexander Ferguson’s Bibliography of Australia was first pub-
lished in four chronological and three alphabetical volumes as
follows:
Volume I 1784-1830 (1941)
II 1831-1838 (1945)
111 1839-1845 (1951)
IV 1846-1850 (1955)
V 1851-1900 A-G (1963)
VI 1851-1900 H-P (1965)
VII 1851-1900 Q-Z (1969)
The introduction to each volume of the Bibliography gives a des-
cription of the material covered. In the introduction to Volume I,
Ferguson noted, as he did on other occasions later, that while he
had made every effort to list every published item falling within his
scope, he realised that titles would be found to have been omitted.
Volumes II and IV of the Bibliography contained, as addenda,
entries omitted from earlier volumes. Work on the collection of
addenda to the Bibliography was continued, after Ferguson’s death
in 1969, by Mr Eric Russell (an editor on the staff of the original
publishers, Angus and Robertson) together with the staff of the
National Library of Australia and the State Library of New South
Wales.
In 1975 the National Library acquired the copyright in the Bib-
liography. It also acquired the addenda compiled and the revision
work done. The Library considered incorporating this work in a
new edition of the Bibliography. A substantial amount of work would
have been involved, and the Library decided that it was preferable
to republish the existing volumes in facsimile than to delay the
reappearance of the Bibliography. The publication of a number of
addenda volumes incorporating all known addenda and corrigenda
was planned and foreshadowed in the introduction to the facsimile
edition.
The assistance of many institutions and individual people in the
collection of information for the addenda was sought and received


by the National Library. The endeavour has taken ten years. Fol-
lowing Sir John Ferguson’s philosophy that it is better to proceed
with publication than to await indefinitely a greater approximation
to ideal completeness, the National Library has imposed an arbi-
trary cut-off for material to be included and published in the present
volume of addenda.
The publication contains titles omitted from volumes I to IV of
the Bibliography , including the addenda printed in volumes 11, 111
and IV. It is now possible to search in one place for addenda for
the period to 1850. Some entries which appeared in the original
bibliography have been revised and some have been assigned new
numbers. A great many additional locations for items have been
added. The Library has relied entirely on information from con-
tributors in compiling lists of locations, and gives the same caveat
as Ferguson: it should not be assumed that omission of holdings
implies that there are no other locations where the title described
might be held. No attempt has been made to follow up and amend
location entries for items held in private collections which have been
dispersed since the original publication of the Bibliography.
The scope of the Addenda is that established by Ferguson for the
period 1784 to 1850, as described in volume I.
The arrangement of the Addenda follows that of the first four
volumes of the Bibliography. Entries are arranged chronologically
and then within each chronological sequence entries are arranged
alphabetically by author, or title where there is no author. The
index contains entries for authors, titles and subjects. Reference
from the index to the main part of the list is by Ferguson number.
Locations are interspersed numerically with the entries. Access to
the entries to which these locations apply is not provided in the
index to the Addenda.
Work on the compilation of the Addenda was carried out by many
members of the National Library staff, among whom special
acknowledgment is made to Helen Blackall, Donna Reid and Mary
Witsenhuysen. The volume was prepared for publication by Carmel
Mclnerny with the assistance of Mary Witsenhuysen.
The National Library accepts a continuing role in the mainten-
ance of the Bibliography. New information is collected and arranged
for use within the Library. Contributions and comments are wel-
comed.
New records are constantly being added by the Library to the
Australian Bibliographic Network (ABN) database. Amongst these
are Ferguson records, each of which includes a numeric project code
intended as an aid to discrete selection for future Ferguson biblio-
graphic projects.


The Retrospective National Bibliography (RNB) (1901-1950),
which is perceived as filling the gap between Ferguson’s Bibliography
of Australia and the current Australian National Bibliography , is in the
process of being compiled at the National Library. The three
bibliographies are contemplated as forming a dynamic, continuous
theme of Australian bibliography in print, spanning the years 1784
to the present and beyond.

Solander. [ c . 1784],
Sir Joseph Banks, President of the Royal Society, was very friendly with
Dr Daniel Solander, favourite pupil of Linnaeus and later Assistant
Librarian at the British Museum. He subsequently travelled with Banks
round the world and became his librarian.
This satire on Banks is dated 1663 but this is evidently a fictitious date
or a misprint. The copy in the Ferguson Collection has the name Charles
Hutton written in a contemporary hand below Simon Snip, F.R.S. This
suggests or asserts Charles Hutton as the author.
Charles Hutton, LL.D. (1737-1823) was born at Newcastle on Tyne, the
son of a colliery labourer. He became a distinguished Mathematician and
was Foreign Secretary of the Royal Society from 1779 until Sir Joseph
Banks became President, when he resigned.
Sir Joseph Banks was chosen President November 30, 1778. In 1783-4
there were very stormy meetings and it was found necessary to pass a


resolution of support for the President. It may reasonably be presumed that
this skit was published about that time.
Dobell’s Antiquarian Book Store offered two copies of this rare booklet
in Cat. 43 (1938), Nos 25 and 25A. The first copy is now in the Mitchell
Library, Sydney, the second, in the Ferguson Collection.

The matter relating to Botany Bay is taken from Captain Cook’s First
Voyage and is at pp. 64-71. The author refers to the fact that the Govern-
ment “are now forming a settlement for the reception of male and female
convicts. ”
A very rare chap-book. An earlier edition consisting of 65 pages only was
published at Greenock in 1780.

A Voyage to the River Sierra-Leone, on the Coast of Africa;
containing an Account of the Trade and Productions of the
Country, and of the Civil and Religious Customs and Manners


of the People; in a Series of Letters to a friend in England. By
John Matthews, Lieutenant in the Royal Navy; during his Resi-
dence in that Country in the Years 1785, 1786, 1787. With an
Additional Letter on the Subject of the African Slave Trade.
London; B. White & Son, 1788.
Bvo. Large folding chart of the Coast and folding view of the Island of
Bananas, and 8 engraved plates.
Lieutenant Matthews favours the African Slave Trade, pointing out that
the fate of these people captured in African Wars would have been certain
death and the fact of their being saleable to white traders saved their lives.
“A pretty close parallel may be observed between the African condemned
for some offence against the laws of his country, to be sold to a white man,
and the English felon transported to a wild uncultivated country, for such
Botany Bay is represented, and whose distance for ever excludes the hope
of returning.”
An interesting contemporary comment upon the expedition to Botany
Bay to found a penal settlement.

in his book I rue Patriots All, or News from Early Australia, as told in A

note in Sladen’s A Century of Australian Song (1888) the poem was printed in

Wales Dog (Dingo); Kanguroo; Kanguroo-Rat; Spotted Opossum; Vul-
pine Opossum; Flying Opossum; Van Diemen’s Land Opossum, all of New
Flolland, are described and delineated.
The engravings have been described as follows:
The following is a copy of the cut of the Two Boys and the Ass, previously
mentioned as occurring at page 375. This cut, beyond any other of the tail-
pieces in the first edition of the Quadrupeds, perhaps affords the best speci-
men of Bewick’s peculiar talent of depicting such subjects; he faithfullly
represents Nature, and at the same time conveys a moral, which gives
additional interest to the sketch. Though the ass remains immoveable, in
spite of the application of a branch of furze to his hind quarters, the young
graceless who is mounted evidently enjoys his seat. The pleasure of the
Twain consists as much in having caught an ass as in the prospect of a ride.
To such characters the stubborn ass frequently affords more amusement than
a willing goer; they like to flog and thump a thing well, though it be but
a gate-post. The gallows in the distance a favourite in terrorem object with
Bewick suggests their ultimate destiny; and the cut, in the first edition,
derives additional point from its situation among the animals found in New
South Wales the first shipment of convicts to Botany Bay having taken
place about two years previous to the publication of the work.” From A

G.M. Mathews in his The Birds of Australia: bibliography of the birds of
Australia gives the following description of The Naturalist’s Miscellany: “This
very important work was issued in parts consisting of 3 or 4 plates monthly,
and these were bound up into volumes, and it is now very difficult to trace


the exact date of the parts. Sherborn in the Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., Ser. 6,
Vol. XV, pp. 375-376, April 1895, furnished the first account in which the
first part was stated to be published on August Ist, 1789, and was succeeded
by 286 parts which was to the date of Shaw’s death, when 4 plates were
ready but no text to them, the number of plates being altogether 1,068, the
number of parts 287, the dates 1789-1813, bound into twenty-four vol-
umes. In the Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist., Vol. XXXI, March 4th, 1912,
J.A. Allen, in an article entitled ‘Historical and Nomenclatorial Notes on
North American Sheep,’ included a revised ‘Collation of Shaw and
Nodder’s Naturalists’ Miscellany.’ This was revised and confirmed from
other copies by Osgood, Proc. Biol. Soc. Wash., Vol. XXVII, pp. 1-4,
Feb. 2nd, 1914. The plates were prepared by F.P. Nodder and the text
provided by G. Shaw, the director of the British Museum. This work has
been depreciated by such writers as Swainson and more recently Newton,
but, notwithstanding their remarks, there is much of novelty and value in
the work.
No fewer than 284 birds are figured in this work, and the following names
are quoted from it in Australian literature alone: Motacilla superba (Vol. I),
Psittacus magnijicus (Vol. II), Psittacus gloriosus (Vol. II), Psittacus concinnus
(Vol. Ill), Psittacus eximius (Vol. Ill), Psittacus pulchellus (Vol. Ill), Anas
plutoma (Vol. Ill), Motacilla hirundinacea (Vol. IV), Pipora punctata (Vol. IV),
Psittacus Junereus (Vol. VI), Anas lobata (Vol. VIII), Paradisea parkinsoniana
(Vol. XIV), Alcedo tnbrachys (Vol. XVI), Psittacus zonarius (Vol. XVI),
Psittacus undulatus (Vol. XVI), Psittacus melanotus (Vol. XVI), Anas fasciata
(Vol. XVII), Motacilla dubia (Vol. XXII), and the name Casuarius australis

Delattre, Monsieur.
Rapport sur la recherche a faire de M. de la Perouse, fait, a
I’Assemblee Nationale, au nom de ses deux Comites
d’Agriculture, Commerce et de la Marine, precede de la petition
de la Societe d’Histoire Naturelle de Paris, sur le meme sujet.
Par M. Delattre, Depute d’Abbeville. Paris.
Imprime par ordre de FAssemblee Nationale. 9 Fevrier, 1791.
A copy offered by Maggs Bros Ltd Cat. 795, (1950), No. 878,
with the following note:
“In the preface the writer points out that two years had passed
without news of La Perouse and speculates as to his possible fate.
He mentions that the King of France had given orders for every-
one to respect the flag of Captain Cook, and if France could so
honour Cook the country should be no less generous now.
He calls on the National Assembly to circulate the instructions
given to La Perouse so that his intended route might be known.
To send out ships equipped with naturalists and astronomers. To
call upon all nations using the Pacific to give their assistance.
In his report Delattre points out the objectives which La
Perouse had in view. In July 1788 he was supposed to be in
Torres Strait and then to explore the Gulf of Carpentaria and to
navigate the West Coast of Australia before reporting at
Mauritius, in December, 1788. They should not give up the hope
that La Perouse and his companions still lived. If the English
could send out a special expedition to search for the “Bounty”
mutineers, France should certainly do the same for her unfortu-
nate countrymen.
It was of course later in that year that France sent out the
“Boussole” and the “Astrolabe” under d’ Entrecasteaux and
Kermadec for the search, which unfortunately was unsuccessful.
It was not until 1825, that Captain Dillon discovered the remains
of La Perouse’s vessels on the reefs of Vanikoro, to the north of
the New Hebrides. More recent information seems to indicate
that the majority of those who escaped the wrecks were massacred
but that several French sailors may have lived for a few years
before dying.”

This volume contains (at p. 45) the Sonnet: “On the Ships sailing for
Botany Bay”:
“Fresh o’er the wave the winds that favoring blow
Fill the swoln sails. Genius of Albion, say
Why yon swift vessel cleaves the watery way?
Is it to hurl thy vengeance on the foe;
To plunge ‘mid untried seas the adventurous prow;
Or to new isles, where nature’s children stray,
Arts yet untaught, and fruits unknown convey?
Alas, for Britain! fraught with guilt and woe
Groans the o’er burdened ship. The farewell sound
Rings mournfully. Father of mercy, hear!
Chastised by labour, when the exiles earn
By their brows sweat their bread, oh! may the tear
Of penitence drop on the soil, and turn
To blessing thy dread curse that smote the ground.”
The reference is to the departure of the First Fleet for Botany Bay in
1787.

The Lady Shore left Falmouth in June, 1797, for Port Jackson with a
detachment of soldiers and a few convicts, including the famous Major
Semple-Lisle, transported for defrauding tradesmen. When the ship
reached the latitude of Cape Frio the soldiers seized the ship. Semple had
warned the captain of the plot to seize the vessel. The ship was taken by
the mutineers into Montevideo, where she was seized and sold. Black him-
self went to the Cape of Good Hope and thence to Sydney, which he
reached in 1798.

Squirrel Opossum (p. 438, with figure); Kanguroo (p. 439, with figure);
Kanguroo-rat of New South Wales (p. 441, with figure).
In this edition first appears the Addenda, as follows: “We are favoured,
by the Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle upon Tyne, with the
figures and descriptions of Two very rare animals, sent to them from New
South Wales, by James Hunter, Esq. Governor of that settlement.
The one appears to be of the Opossum genus, of which the most unques-
tionable proof is, that it has a false belly or pouch, for the reception of its
young after their protrusion from the uterus; common to every animal of
that kind.
The other seems to be an animal sui generis-, it appears to possess a three-
fold nature, that of a fish, a bird, and a quadruped, and is related to nothing
that we have hitherto seen: We shall not attempt to arrange it in any of the
usual modes of classification, but content ourselves with giving the descrip-
tion of both these curious animals as they have been transmitted to us.”
Descriptions of the ‘Wombach’ (Wombat) and ‘An Amphibious Animal’
(Duck-bill Platypus) follow, with figures (pp. 522-525). Other editions at

Communications on Different Subjects, addressed to the Bahama Agricul-
tural Society, 63 pages, sm. 4to, calf, rebacked, Nassau, New Providence
[Bahama Islands]: Printed by Joseph Eve, 1802.
EXTREMELY RARE AND ONE OF THE EARLIEST PUBLI-
CATIONS TO HAVE THE NASSAU IMPRINT. WE HAVE NEVER
BEFORE SEEN A COPY and so far cannot trace another. Not listed in
Halkett and Laing s “Dictionary of Anonymous and Pseudonymous
English Literature . Unknown to Sabin’s “Dictionary of Books relating to
America’’ and Cundall’s “Bibliography of the West Indies”. Pages 41 and
42 contain an article by the Rev. J. Richards “On the culture of the
Otaheite or Asparagus Bean, read before the Society, by the Secretary”,
July 31, 1801. In 1799 Dr. Alexander Anderson of the Botanical Gardens,'
St. Vincent, on the instructions of Sir Joseph Banks, sent a collection of
plants to Governor Dowdeswell likely to be of use in the Bahamas.
Anderson s letter and the list of plants occupy pages 45-49, while the notes
on the plants and the account of how they progressed in the Bahamas pages
50-63. Of these, pages 50, 51 and half of 53 deal with the bread fruit and
the different kinds thereof. According to the notes they progressed quite well
in the Bahamas and bore fruit each year since planting
THIS PART OF THE PAMPHLET IS OF CONSIDERABLE
INTEREST.
Bligh on his second voyage (1791-93) was successful in conveying plants of
the bread fruit from Tahiti to St. Vincent in the West Indies, anchoring in


Kingstown Harbour on the 23rd January, 1793. On his return to England
he informed the Royal Society of Arts of his success, and as promised was
awarded their Gold Medal. In 1801 he was elected F.R.S. in consideration
of his distinguished services to navigation and botany.
It is interesting to note that as early as 1783 in the “Transactions of the
Society ... for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce”
[Royal Society of Arts], for the year 1783, under the heading of “Premiums
offered for the advantage of the British Colonies”, sections 171-72 read
“BREAD FRUIT TREE. To the person or persons, who between the first
of June, and the fifteenth of August, 1784, shall bring into the port of
London the greatest number of plants of one or both species of the Bread
Fruit Tree, in a growing state, not less than three of either species; the gold
medal”.
Sections 173-74 extended the period to 1785. 341 a
Barrallier, Francis Luis (1773-1853).

Broadside. 12 3/4 x 7 3/8 inches. No imprint. N.D. [c. 1802].
In March 1801 Barrallier was sent with Grant in the Lady Nelson to help
him in survey work. The charts then made of Jervis Bay, Western Port, and
Bass Strait (from Cape Northumberland to Cape Howe) were mainly or
entirely Barrallier’s work.
Some of Ensign Barrallier s Charts are bound up in the same volume
with this broadside, in the Mitchell Library, Sydney.

The Australian reference is small. In dealing with the Spanish Merino
sheep there is an interesting New South Wales reference at p. 89:
“When the stock has been preserved pure from the native blood, the
lambs have been distinguished for the beauty of their fleece, and the
descendants of a pair, which has been carried even to the distant shores of
New South Wales, produce a fleece so correctly beautiful as to raise the best
produce of the Leonean mountains.”
A new edition was published in London in 1809, the only differences
being a new preliminary title-page, dated 1809, a Table of Contents, and
a Catalogue of Harding’s books; the preface and the body of the work
remain the same. This is obviously a remainder edition with new title-page
dated 1809. See No. 483aaa.

The charge was that Macarthur did unlawfully import into New South
Wales in a vessel called the Dart of which Macarthur was the owner, two


stills; that he dealt with the same contrary to the directions of Governor
Bligh that they be placed upon a ship sailing for England; that he made
false, malicious and libellous statements against the Governor in respect of
his dealing with the matter, and sought to bring Bligh and his government
into hatred and contempt with the people. Another information was laid in
respect of the schooner Parramatta, and the gravamen of the charge was that
Macarthur by his actions and utterances had sought to bring Bligh and his
government into hatred and contempt with the people.

Great Britain and Ireland-Army-General Orders.-Lieutenant

No. 210 / General Orders. / = = = Horse-Guards, / 2nd. July,
1811. / At a General Court-Martial , held at the Royal Hospital,
Chelsea, on / the 7th May, 1811, and continued by Adjournments
to the sth of June fol- / lowing, Lieutenant- Colonel George
Johnston, Major of the 102 d Great Britain and Ireland-Army-
General Orders. Lieutenant Colonel George Johnston.
Regiment, / was arraigned upon the under-mentioned Charge,
viz. / “ That Lieutenant-Colonel George Johnston, Major as
aforesaid, did, / on, or about the 26th day of January, 1808, at Sydney,
in the / Colony of New South Wales, begin, excite, cause, and join in,
a / Mutiny, by putting himself at the Head of the New South Wales /
Corps, then under his Command, and doing Duty in the Colony, / and
seizing and causing to be seized, and arrested, and imprisoning, / and
causing to be imprisoned, by means of the above-mentioned / Military
Force, the Person of William Bligh, Esq. then Captain / General and
Governor in Chief, in and over the Territory of / New South Wales." /
Upon which Charge the Court came to the following decision:
“The Court, having duly and maturely weighed and considered
the whole / of the Evidence adduced on the Prosecution, as well
as what has been / offered in Defence, are of opinion that
Lieutenant-Colonel Johnston is / Guilty of the Act of Mutiny as
described in the Charge, and do therefore / sentence him to be
Cashiered . ” /
His Royal Highness the Prince Regent, in the Name and on the
Behalf / of his Majesty, was pleased, under all the circumstances
of this Case, to / acquiesce in the Sentence of the Court. /
The Court, in passing a Sentence so inadequate to the enormity
of the / Crime of which the Prisoner has been found Guilty, have
apparently been / actuated by a consideration of the novel and
extraodinary circumstances, / which, by the Evidence on the face
of the proceedings, may have appeared to / them to have existed
during the Administration of Governor Bligh, both as / affecting the
Tranquillity of the Colony, and calling For some immediate /
decision: — But although the Prince Regent admits the principle
under which / the Court have allowed this consideration to act
in mitigation of the punish- / ment which the Crime of Mutiny
would otherwise have suggested, yet no cir / cumstances what-
ever can be received by His Royal Highness is full extenua / tion
of an assumption of power, so subversive of every principle of
good / Order and Discipline, / as that under which Lieutenant-
Colonel Johnston has / been convicted. / The Commander in
Chief directs that the Charge preferred against / Lieutenant-


Colonel Johnston, together with the Sentence of the Court, and
/ His Royal Highness the Prince Regent’s pleasure thereon shall
be read at / the Head of every Regiment, and entered in the
Regimental Orderly Book. / By Command of His Royal High-
ness / The Commander in Chief, / Harry Calvert, / Adjutant-
General.

Referred to in a letter from Bligh to F.G. Bond, dated Durham Place,
Lambeth, July 22nd 1811. The relevant extract is as follows;
“The Court Martial on Johnston ended on the sth June from which time
we continued in state of uncertainty about the Sentence until the 11th
Instant when the Papers announced a surreptitious account to which they
presumed to add the Duke of York’s Name-Surprised at such an iniquitous
publication,-! wrote to the Duke of York, who replied to me he did not
know how such a thing got into the Papers.-On the 10th I found the real
General Order was printed which you will see is very different, and I was
assured the Prince Regent had no intentions whatever of casting any
reflections on me, at what time since it has been communicated to the Army
I don’t know; but I have got a number of Copies Printed which I think
necessary to spread as much as Possible, and having procured a Frank
which takes overweight, take the liberty to send you some for that purpose
and should it be convenient to you and [you] can with propriety get the
Exeter N. Paper Editor to print one of them, I will most chearfully pay him
any expense, at least you for what he require for so doing. ...’’

“The History of Highwaymen, Pirates, and Robbers, by Captain
Johnson , has become very Scarce and valuable:— At the sale of the late Duke
of Roxburgh’s books, a copy sold for fifteen guineas, besides duty.
The Publishers have therefore been induced to offer the Public a New
Edition of a book long esteemed the only authentic history of men, (many
of them of first-rate abilities,) who, spurning the restraints necessary to
uphold the fabric of civilized life, threw the scaffolding at their feet, and
carried on their depredations for a time, until the law doomed them, as
victims of example, to support its dominion by its Justice.”
This edition contains an Appendix with an account of {inter alios) George
Barrington, see pp. 498-517. Some information is given with respect to
Barrington’s circumstances and career in New South Wales but the state-
ments made should be carefully checked with the notes regarding George
Barrington in Bibliography I, pp. 13-17.

Murray, Robert Lathrop.
An Appeal / to / the British Nation, / by / Robert Lathrop

documents / the ecclesiastical and legal opinions, and the whole
of / the proceedings relative to his late / extraordinary trial. /
Second Edition. / / Summum jus, summa injuria! / /

Bvo. Pp. [ii] (half-title, verso blank), 38, 22 (Postscript to the Second
Edition, last page blank). For a note upon the date of issue of this edition,
see below.
Robert Lathrop Murray, a prominent figure in early Tasmanian news-
paper history, having lost his appeal to the House of Commons and the
Prince Regent’s Ministers having decided against him, submitted the whole
legal proceedings, of which he claimed to have been the victim, to his
country in this pamphlet.
It appeared that in the year 1797, Murray, being then about seventeen
years of age, had been quartered with a regiment, in which he was then an
officer, at Londonderry, in Ireland. He there became acquainted with a
Miss Marshall, a person of nearly double his age, between whom and the
prisoner, a presbyterian preacher, calling himself Dr. Black, performed a
marriage ceremony, in a back parlour of the lady’s house, without banns
or licence, no individual being present but the members of the lady’s
family. ’
The Prisoner, who was charged with bigamy, was said to have been
married a second time in the parish of Mary-le- bonne, England in 1801.
The Recorder pronounced the Irish marriage legal, and the Jury found
the prisoner guilty. Murray was sentenced to transportation for seven years.


In the pamphlet Murray complains bitterly of the inadequacy of the evi-
dence of both alleged marriages, and of the severity of his punishment, so
long after his second alleged marriage. “But my country will hardly believe
that this (the sentence of transportation) is only part of my punishment; a
most heavy pecuniary fine has also been levied upon me. My personal
property, to a large amount, has been seized upon and confiscated, and I
have been removed from the British army, in which, by my length of service
and by purchase, I had become the Senior Captain of my Regiment. Thus
have thousands of pounds been taken from me: to say nothing of the loss
of my services in various parts of the world; of having been twice wounded,
and having only returned with the British cavalry from France on the 25th
July last, after a long absence, and after having undergone every difficulty
and privation during the Peninsular War, and having exhausted my best
energies in the service of my country. And yet, every application for
investigation, all I ask, is refused!”
The first edition of this rare pamphlet, published in London in 1815, has
not been seen. There is no copy in the British Museum or in any Australian
Library.
It is not known whether a second edition was issued in London in 1815,
for the only copy known is the composite pamphlet in the Dixson Collection
and the Mitchell Library, Sydney, described above.
This comprises the original sheets of the first edition, together with
additional pages separately paginated (l-[22]), printed apparently in
Hobart, Van Diemen’s Land, in or after 1835, and headed “Postscript to
the Second Edition.” These pages were bound up with what appear to be
remaining sheets of the first edition, London, 1815. The words “Second
Edition” were impressed on the title-page of the first edition, with a slight
variation of fount but without any alteration of the imprint. The additional
matters, comprising the “Postscript”, refer to trials and events that
occurred from 1823 to 1834. This pamphlet may have been circulated by
Murray at the time of the publication of his “Petition to the Queen”
(1842).

The author “will obtain the satisfaction of having accomplished the object
he has in view if [what he has to say] teaches Englishmen to regard
Americans in the same point of view in which they themselves are con-
sidered, that is, not in the light of kinsmen, but of foreigners, aliens, enemies,
natural-born foes” (p. 7).
Unless care is taken by Britain to guard against the evil (of American
competition) by widening her foreign possessions, and providing a resource
for her subjects, will not all the persons thus thrown out of employ flock to
the states, and thereby increase the disaster? “Can the landed interest object
to colonization, when they reflect on the reduced value of their estates, which
would be necessarily consequent on a decline of the empire? On the con-
trary, they ought to embark extensively in the measure, by the formation
of societies, or otherwise, for the purpose of sending settlers abroad; and
no fear of draining the country should be apprehended, for two hundred
thousand souls might emigrate without inconvenience. The idle, dissipated,
or dishonest, might be sent to New Holland; the more respectable should
be planted in Trinidad, or the North American provinces. And what would
Great Britain lose by the removal of all her sturdy-beggars, ballad-singers,
mountebanks, pick-pockets, prostitutes, &c. or rather how great would be
her gain? These people may frequently yield to fair representations of the
advantages of emigration, and not only emigrate but reform, and become
useful members of Society. A very slight acquaintance with human motives
will convince us, that despair of ever attaining opulence often produces in
the poor habits of indolence which generate dishonesty; and that those who
have been long abandoned to evil courses may rouse at the prospect of
interest, and shake them off altogether. But in planting a colony of these
wretched characters care must be taken to select a spot distant from any
town, where spirits might be easily procured; because the more remote and
wild the settlement, the greater the prospect of ultimate success. And con-
sidered in one point of view, a colony of such loose persons, who had never
applied themselves to any manufacturing or mechanical occupation, would
be of more service to the mother country than one composed of industrious
characters; since the former being unable to provide apparel, &c. would be
better customers to the merchant than the latter, whose women could spin
and manufacture cloths at home” (pp. 224-6). These quotations will serve
to show the extra-ordinary opinions held with reference to colonization, and
especially Australian colonization at this time. The author states (at p. 131)
that the Battle of Waterloo intervened between the writing and the printing
of his work.

The date is suggested as shortly after the Napoleonic Wars by the
following two verses:
“My love fought boldly for the King,
To guard him on his throne,
And this is the recompence he got
When that he did come home,
For no employment could he find,
When that he come from sea,
And for a shilling then was cast,
And sent to Botany Bay.
“O cursed be that cruel day,
That robb’d me of my dear,
Confusion to the fatal laws,
For they are too severe;
And should another war arise,
What will old England do,
I wish I had my sons back again,
That’s sent to Botany Bay’’.

The following note in manuscript appears in the copy in the Ferguson
Collection: Presented by Colonel Sir Augustus Simon Frazer, for the
Hartwell Library on the Bth of September, 1833. “This work is by Lieuten-
ant General Sir Thomas Brisbane and is doubly interesting both as afford-
ing useful reductions of English Weights and Measures into those of France,
and as recording the date of the City of Paris being in the Military pos-
session of the British and Allied Armies or, more strictly, of the British
Head Quarters being in Paris.” (Extract of a letter from Sir A.S. Frazer,
dated Woolwich, 6th September, 1833, to his son).
This copy also bears the bookplate of Sir Augustus S. Frazer, and the
signature of John Lee Hartwell, dated September, 1833.
Sir Thomas Makdougall Brisbane was Governor of New South Wales,
1821-1825. See The Australian Encyclopaedia (1958 ed.), Vol. 2, pp. 126-7

A copy of this extremely rare booklet was acquired by the National
Library in 1945. It has been rebound in red levant morocco. It was pur-
chased from Maggs Bros Ltd, London, and was entered in their Cat. 747
(1945), No. 2009, £l5O. It came from the Harmsworth Library. There is
no indication of authorship, the initials “H.E.W.” appearing in the print
of the Ms. made in 1926 not appearing in the original booklet.
On page 8 of the original booklet the following passage not contained in
reprint of Ms. appears: Mr. M’Carty’s party, consisting of himself, Mr.
Jemott, Mr. James O’Birne, Master of the Geordy, Keith Hacking, mate,
Messrs, Carlisle, Murphy, James Triffit, John Brown, and Tooms,
armed with fowling-pieces and pistols, soon came up with the robbers and
commanded them to surrender their arms; the gang instantly commenced
firing under cover of, and through a large hollow tree, and wounded five
of the party, who had the disadvantage of being fully exposed to the fire of
the former on every attempt to get a shot at them. Carlisle received a ball
in the groin and three slugs in the breast, of which wounds he died within
an hour; Mr. Jemott was badly wounded by a ball passing through the thick
part of the thigh, in which part Triffit was also wounded, and Murphy in
the abdomen.” At p. 15 of booklet are the words ‘‘John Yorke.” In the
reprint of the Ms. the words are “John Fooke” (first line of p. 22 of
reprint). P. 24 of reprint of Ms. line 16 has “Howe”; in original booklet
p. 18 the name is “Jones.” P. 27 reprint line 17 has “Tall”; in original
booklet it is “Tull” (p. 22). There is no place of publication or date at end
of the original booklet.

Angus and Robertson Limited, Sydney, in 1926 see Bibliography 1/716.

Extract from the Examiner Sunday paper, of 13th September, 1818:
Old Bailey.—On Wednesday, Laurence Halloran, otherwise Gregory,
Doctor in Divinity, of King’s College, Aberdeen, a gentleman of most
respectable appearance and demeanour, and apparently about fifty years of
age, was indicted, for having, in the month of January, 1817, counterfeited
a frank in the name of Sir Wm. Garrow, Knt., then a member of Parlia-
ment, and having thereby defrauded the Post-office of “ ten-pence. ” On being
called upon to plead to the indictment, the prisoner, in a firm voice,
addressed the Court to the following effect: — “In the long interval of time,
that has elapsed since the date of the letter in question (upwards of twenty
months), the death of the only person, who could have established my
innocence, having unfortunately precluded all possibility of exculpation,
and the total exhaustion of my pecuniary resources, and ruin of my circum-
stances, by the long confinement I have undergone, having equally
deprived me of all power to engage legal advice and assistance, I feel, that


I have no alternative, but to plead “Guilty” to the charge, and to throw
myself on the clemency of the Court.”
Mr Baron Graham admonished the prisoner, to reflect on the conduct,
he was about to adopt, before he decided on pleading. To which Dr.
Halloran replied,— “I am most grateful for your Lordship’s counsel and
consideration; but standing, as I do, single, unarmed, and defenceless,
against armed and powerful opponents, I am advised, that it will be most
prudent to decline the contest, from the hopelessness of success. I beg leave,
therefore, to persist in the plea of “Guilty,” and to implore the
commiseration of the Court.”
A Solicitor, of the name of Hyatt, here offered, though not personally
known to Dr. Halloran, to undertake his defence, and to engage Counsel
on his behalf; but the offer was declined, and the plea recorded.
[A Correspondent gives us the following account of Dr. Halloran:
“The name of this unfortunate gentleman is now known in the Literary
World. His publications, poetical and theological, amount to seventeen. He
conducted a School Establishment near Exeter, upwards of twelve years,
which was in the highest repute; and from which he turned out many
excellent scholars, who now fill respectable situations in life. Among these
may be reckoned the present Solicitor-General, Sir Robert Gifford, who was
nine years his pupil, and received from him the whole of his school edu-
cation. It was at Dr. Halloran’s recommendation, that Sir Robert’s talents
were devoted to the law. Dr. Halloran has also been employed many years
as a Naval and Military Chaplain, in which engagements he was highly
respected. He was three years and a half Chaplain and Secretary to the Earl
of Northesk, with whom he was present in the Britannia at the Battle of
Trafalgar, on which he published a poem. He was also on terms of friend-
ship with Lords Nelson, and Collingwood, to the former of whom he had
been long known. He was upwards of three years Chaplain to the Naval
and Military Forces, and Rector of the public Grammar School, at the Cape
of Good Hope. His last engagement, as Curate and Lecturer of Brosely in
Shropshire, has been a most unfortunate one; for though highly valued by
the inhabitants, he was unfortunately on unfriendly terms with the Rector,
Dr. Townsend Forester, to whom the counterfeited frank was addressed,
and who has been the promoter of this novel prosecution, the first, that has
ever taken place under the statute, and which subjects the prisoner, after
an active and useful life, now in the wane, to seven years’ transportation.
Dr. H. has a large family, at present in extreme distress from this afflicting
reverse. He is confined in the Infirmary in Newgate.”]
Transported to Australia for seven years, he reached Port Jackson in the
transport Baring on 26 June 1819. Receiving a ticket of leave he was
allowed to open a school and became in Macquarie’s words “the best and
most admired Instructor of Youth in this Colony.” He died on 7 March
1831.

references to New Holland only occupy part of page 9 and attempt to
dissuade folk from going there. T must confess there is little to encourage
the adventurer to seek for prosperity or comfort in that Colony. The

A detailed study of the causes of crime, conditions of prisons in the
United Kingdom and on the Continent of Europe, juvenile delinquency
and related subjects are dealt with.
These subjects have a close connection with transportation to and the
treatment of Convicts in New South Wales, Tasmania and Norfolk Island.
At pp. 159-160 a letter from the Rev. Samuel Marsden to a Member of
the Ladies’ Association, Newgate, is quoted. It is dated Parramatta,
February 5, 1820, and reads as follows:
“I had the honour to receive your letter, dated the 12th May, sent by
the Wellington,-When this ship arrived I went on Board and was highly
gratified with the order which appeared to have been maintained in that
vessel; I could not have conceived that any ship could have been fitted up,
to have afforded such accommodation to the unfortunate female exiles, as
the Wellington was. All the women looked clean, healthy, and well. They
had not that low, vicious, squalid, dirty look, which the women at former
periods have had, when they first arrived. I believe there has been very
great attention paid by the master and surgeon to their morals and comfort,
in every possible way. The very sight of the arrangements of the vessel
showed that the humane and benevolent wishes of the Christian world had
been carried into effect, and proved beyond all contradiction that order and
morality can be maintained upon so long a voyage in a female convict ship.
I trust, now they are landed, that many of them will behave well in the
colony. A barrack is now building for the reception of the female convicts,
which, when completed, will I hope, prevent many of those public evils
which have from the beginning disgraced this colony. .. .The present
inquiry into the state of this Colony, before the Committee of the House
of Commons, will greatly benefit this country. I can speak from painful
experience, that for the last twenty-six years, it has been the most immoral
and wretched society in all the Christian world. Those who are intimate
with the miseries and vices of large gaols, alone can form any idea of the
colony of New South Wales. I know what Newgate was when I was in
London in the years 1808 and 1809. I was then in the habit of seeing that
miserable abode of vice and woe. What has since been done in Newgate
may be done elsewhere, if suitable means are adopted by those in authority,
seconded by individual exertions; much might be done in these colonies
towards restoring the poor exiles to society, with the countenance and sup-
port of the government. Great evils are not removed without great
difficulties. When I visited the Wellington, I saw much had been done in
England, and more than I could have credited had I not been an eye-witness
of the situation of the females. I hope the system will be followed up till it
be fully established in the transportation of female convicts.”
The report for 1819 has not been seen.

The severity and gruesome brutality of a sentence for high treason in that
iron time is well illustrated by the following passage from the Trials. On a
sentence for High Treason for their part in the Cato Street Conspiracy “On
Monday, the Ist of May (1820), Arthur Thistlewood, William Davidson,
James Ings, John Thomas Brunt, and Richard Tidd, were brought out to
a platform erected in front of the debtors door, Newgate, where they were
hanged until they were dead, when they were cut down, and their heads
were severed from their bodies. His Majesty having been graciously pleased
by Warrant, to remit that part of the sentence, which directed that their
bodies should be divided into four quarters, and to direct that the bodies
and heads should be forthwith privately buried.
James William Wilson, John Harrison, Richard Bradburn, John Shaw
Strange, James Gilchrist, and Charles Cooper, received His Majesty’s par-
don, on condition of being transported to such place beyond the seas as His
Majesty, with the advice of His Privy Council, should be pleased to direct,
for life.”
Transportation would be to New South Wales or Van Diemen’s Land.

Reproduced in Narrative of the Wreck of the Whale-ship Essex .. . with an
Introduction by Robert Gibbings. (London: Golden Cockerel Press, 1935).
Chappell’s Narrative is also reproduced by Gibbings, see No. 1330 a. He
includes, too, the narrative of the Captain of the Essex , George Pollard,
taken from Journal of Voyages and Travels , by Rev. D. Tyerman and G.
Rennet ( Bibliography 11/1487).
Herman Melville’s famous story Moby Dick or The Whale is based on these
accounts.
Gibbings states: “In the following narratives we have an account of the
loss of the Essex described in detail by the first mate and corroborated in
all essentials by the Captain and second mate. There can be no doubt that
their tragic story supplied not only the original idea for Melville’s master-
piece, but in addition was drawn upon, in places almost word for word, for
much of the local colour in that tremendous final chapter of his classic ...”

An earlier issue than Bibliography 1/854 which was issued August 5, 1822.
In the earlier issue a paragraph relating to William Wentworth is found (pp.
148-9). This was omitted from the later issue. The paragraph is as fol-
lows: .. but I think it necessary to add, that although they (i.e. disputes
between Lieutenant-colonel Molle and his officers and Governor
Macquarie) did not originate in, they were much exasperated by, the
appearance of an anonymous and scurrilous poem, reflecting upon
Lieutenant-colonel Molle, that was circulated through the town of Sydney,
and thrown into the military barracks.
“This poem was afterwards acknowledged by Mr. D’Arcy Wentworth to
be the composition of his son, Mr. William Wentworth, after the departure
of this gentleman from the colony, a fact which Mr. Wentworth declared
he was not acquainted with at the time that Lieutenant-colonel Molle was
endeavouring to discover the author, and was suffering the greatest anxiety
of mind from a report that had been most wickedly and industriously propa-
gated, that the author of the poem was an officer of his own regiment.
“A reproof, for the part that Lieutenant-colonel Molle and his officers
had taken against Mr. D. Wentworth, having been transmitted to them by
your Lordship, I do not consider it necessary to enter further into the merits
of the discussion that gave rise to it. That which took place between
Governor Macquarie and certain officers of the 46th regiment, who had, in
the warmth of an address to their commanding officer, cast some strong
reflections upon the conduct of Governor Macquarie in calling to his society
certain individuals of the class of emancipated convicts, grew out of the
circumstances disclosed by Mr. D. Wentworth on the occasion just alluded
to. ”
In Bigge’s Report on the Judical Establishments of New South Wales , and Van
Diemen’s Land , ordered to be printed 21 February, 1823, at p. 90 he


states; — “I likewise that this opportunity of expressing my concern, that
in the course of my first Report, I should have attributed to Mr. W.
Wentworth the composition of an anonymous and scurrilous poem, since,
whether he was the author of that poem or not, (and it is distinctly under-
stood that on this point he makes neither avowal nor denial,) I feel that I
was not justified in introducing his name into my Report; first, because in
my capacity of commissioner of inquiry into the state of New South Wales,
it was not competent to me to investigate any part of his conduct; and
secondly, because his name was coupled with an admission to his prejudice
that was made by another person in his absence, and without his authority,
and by which therefore he cannot be concluded.”

[With reference to the footnote to Bibliography 1/954, stating that Joseph
Hunt was killed in the quelling of an insurrection among the convicts on
the Marquis of Huntly, Mr Frank B. Maggs contributes the following com-
ment: “This statement is, I believe, quite incorrect, although a report
was circulated that Hunt had been killed in such a way. The Dublin Warder,
April 19, 1823, reported his death on the way to New South Wales, which
report may have been copied elsewhere. Was he actually on the Marquis of
Huntly ? The Courier Newspaper for April 29, 1823, denied the report that
Hunt had been shot on the Countess of Harcourt, convict ship, in a mutiny,
as this vessel had returned to England and the captain had stated that the
whole of the report was untrue and that all the convicts, including Hunt,
had been landed safely. In the Brighton Gazette, 1823, was a report that Hunt
had become a reformed character and had been appointed to the post of
Constable. In another newspaper of date September 14, 1825, under a little
paragraph containing sundry news from New South Wales, is a report that
Hunt had become a reformed character and had been appointed Constable
and Overseer at Bathurst. Incidentally, all the other parties concerned in
the murder of William Weare came to untimely ends. Thurtell was of
course executed. Probert was convicted of horse-stealing the next year,
when the authorities made use of that pretext to have him executed. Horse-
stealing at the time was a capital crime, although any convicted of it
invariably had their sentence commuted to penal servitude, Probert’s case
being the exception. Mrs Probert changed her name to Martha Heath and
went to live at Cheltenham. In September, 1847, at the age of 83, she
committed suicide in the river Chelt.
“Gill’s Hill Lane, the scene of the murder, is now entirely in the village
of Radlett, Hertfordshire. Until a few years ago it was in its original con-
dition, a very narrow and exceedingly winding lane with only room for one
vehicle to pass. It is known locally as Murder Lane. In the last few years
most of the lane has been opened up into a roadway and only a small section
of the central portion remains in anything like its old state.”]

John Thurtell was found guilty of the murder, and Joseph Hunt of being
an accessory thereto. Both were sentenced to death. Thurtell was executed
but Hunt’s sentence was commuted to transportation to New South Wales
for life.
Sir Robert Therry in his Reminiscences of Thirty Years’ Residence in New South
Wales and Victoria (Second Edition, pp. 99-100) wrote: “Hunt the
accomplice of Thurtell. . .was also a favourable specimen of a reformed
character. I was present at his trial at Hertford and heard sentence of death
passed upon him... Eight years after his trial I fell in with Hunt at the
Antipodes. He was then a trusted storekeeper assigned to the service of a
Government contractor on the Blue Mountains Road. I recognised him at
once, as the mail coach stopped at the contractor’s store. . .His conduct in
the Colony was correct and even meritorious. . .For the last 20 years he held
the petty office of Court-Keeper of the Assize Court at Bathurst.. .He was
living in 1859 at the date of my departure from New South Wales.’’

Allport, Mary Morton, nee Chapman, Mrs Joseph.
On Mr. Allports’ [Vc] Birthday, / 1825. / [a poem, by Mary
Morton Chapman.]
Bvo. One sheet (verso blank).
On verso in her granddaugher Eva Mary Allport’s hand “Written at
school by Grannie then Mary Morton Chapman.’’ Mary Morton Chap-
man (1806-95) was educated at the school conducted by the Allport family
at Cedar Court, Aldridge, Staffordshire. In 1826 she married Joseph
Allport, the youngest son of the house, and in 1831 they emigrated to Van
Diemen’s Land. This poem, probably addressed to her future father-in-law,
William Allport, was doubtless printed in England.

He arrived in Sydney Harbour, February 24, 1817, and departed Feb-
ruary 4, 1824. Although he gained the affection of several warm friends
including Charles Lamb, whose references have immortalized him, he
made an unfavourable impression on others. Thus the young Disraeli
describes him as “a noisy, obtrusive, jargonic judge, ever illustrating the
obvious, explaining the evident, and expatiating on the common place”
{Home Letters of Lord Beaconsfield [p. 27]).
His career cannot be described as a successful one either at the bar or
on the bench, and in his literary efforts he was noted for his assiduity and
careful research rather than for any gifts of genius.
The Mitchell Library, Sydney, has copies of both issues, uncoloured and
coloured.

At pp. 15-16 the following lines occur with reference to the Directors of
the Bank of England:
“What possible objection can they shew
“To issuing such a one pound note as this?
“(The specimen what you will see below)
“Say in which one particular ’tis amiss?
“The forger thus himself would strike the blow,
“Would sign his own death warrant; as it is,
“His task so easily is gone about,
“There is great danger of a grand puff out.
“Thou shall not dare to forge this one pound note,
“Nor make a graven image of the same;
“Nor pass it, in whatever manner got,
“Nor take the name of Henry Hase in vain;
“Who does so once, he shall be sent to Bot
“Any Bay; if he ever sin again,
“His doom is sealed, his neck shall have a stretch,
“I promise to perform. His mark, x Jack Ketch.
Now this I call a plain straight forward thing,
A bargain ’twixt all parties mutual made;
The forger owns he well deserves to swing,
Jack Ketch shews ropes are quite his stock in trade,
The Bank procures the warrant of the King,
And guarantees expenses to be paid;
The world at large would easily discern
The whole was just a partnership concern.


An illustration of the comic Bank of England One Pound Note referred
to in the verse is given, facing p. 16.

This circular, bound with related correspondence dated 1825 in the
Archives Office of Tasmania’s files, was printed probably in India. The
Indiana Institution prosposed the establishment of a college in Van
Diemen’s Land for the Eurasian offspring of officers of the H.E.I.C.S. The
officers were to take a £lOOO share for each child. It was hoped that
£lOO,OOO would be raised thereby and that interest therefrom would support
the several schools. The boys it was hoped eventually would obtain grants
of land in the colony. The scheme came to naught. This copy contains
additional manuscript conditions about the scheme with a holograph note
by a Mr. Jefferys, its agent.

Museum. / / .../ / Mr. Seaman, / (As Manager for
a Society of Gentlemen, To whom this / Collection belongs) /
Begs to inform the Ladies and Gentlemen of this Town, that he

taining many Thousands of / Natural Curiosities, I ... I Part of
this Museum was formerly the property of Sir Ashton Lever,
exhibited / for many years in London, and visited by the prin-
cipal Nobility of England. The Manager takes the / liberty to
mention, that the Museum contains the most rare / Quadrupeds
/ Birds, Fishes, / Reptiles, Insects, / Minerals, Shells, Fossils and
Coins, / from every part of the World. / Also, the Heads of two
/ Chieftain Warriors / From the South Pacific Ocean, curiously
Tattooed according to the custom of their country, and
embalmed / with such admirable style, as to preserve the natural
character of those Islanders. The first is the Head of / an
Otaheitan Chief, where the benignity of the countenance peculiar
to the Tribe is finely expressed; the / silky black hair and olive
complexion, and the tattooing of the whole face, presents one of
the most / interesting objects ever beheld. The second is the Head
of a New Zealand Chieftain; the ferocity of his / countenance, the
short bristly hair on the front, contrasted with the long stiff curls
on the back part of the / head, the high cheek bones, and thick
lips of this Warrior, have an effect which no language can
describe. / = = = / ...

Article in London Magazine , N.S. Vol. 11, pp 49-67 (May, 1825).
The prefatory note is as follows:
The following very curious, and in some points of view, very instructive
account, is the genuine composition of one Mellish who had returned from
transportation; and, being again committed to the gaol of one of-the Mid-
land Counties, set himself about describing what he had seen for the amus-
ement of the gaoler’s wife. The manuscript has been faithfully adhered to
in all respects. On the back is inscribed Mellish’s Book of Botany Bay. The
manuscript terminates abruptly. It is written in a copy-book, which is filled
to the very covers; but the story breaks off in the middle of a sentence...

One Paper relates to Cloth from New South Wales wool.
“The Gold Isis Medal, the premium offered, was this session presented
to D. Maclean, Esq. of Basinghall-street, for Cloth manufactured entirely
from fine wool the growth of the colony of New South Wales.
The following communication was received from Mr. Maclean on the
subject, and a specimen of the cloth has been placed in the Society’s
repository.’’
The accompanying letter states that the piece of blue cloth was manufac-
tured by Messrs. Harris, Stephens and Co. of Stanley Mills in the county
of Gloucester. This was supported by various certificates. One by Thomas
Ebsworth, Wool Broker, stated under date February 23, 1824, that on 27th
June, 1823, he, Ebsworth, sold at public sale, at Garraway’s coffee-house,
eighty bales of wool, imported by John Macarthur, Esq. in the ship William
Shand, Captain Kenn, from New South Wales; and that from portion of
this wool the said blue cloth was made.
These documents occupy pp. 69-74 of that issue of Papers on Manufactures.

George Terry Howe, third son of George Howe, government printer,
Sydney, came to Launceston in 1821 when about seventeen years of age.
With the assistance of his brother, Robert Howe, printer of the Sydney
Gazette, he established the above-mentioned newspaper.
In May, 1825, George Terry Howe transferred his press and type to
Hobart, at the Instance of James Ross, who acted for Arthur. Ross and
Howe were then appointed as government printers, but this partnership was
dissolved in 1827.
The only file known of this rare newspaper was discovered in the vaults
of the Hobart Mercury by Professor E. Morris Miller. Each issue bears the
signature of Andrew Bent, who had acted as the Hobart agent of George
Terry Howe’s newspaper. For a full account of this newspaper and other
contemporaneous Tasmanian newspapers see “The Tasmanian (1825).

“I was the first established Printer in the Colony. The Hobart I own
Gazette , my property, (taken from me in 1825, by the Government), was the
first firmly-established Newspaper in the Colony-the first Vehicle of public
news-was the first to throw off the yoke of a Censorship-was the first in
combating in favour of the people-and has ever been the first in that course,
both under the title of the Hobart Town Gazette , and its subsequent one, the
Colonial Times. Before the Newspaper Acts were passed, the Colonial Times
never ceased to defend the People-never ceased to uphold and strengthen
good Government, and never ceased to disseminate instruction into the
dark and remote corners of the Colony. That Paper has been, after standing
12 years, suspended!-and for several weeks silent. The facts relative to that
suspension and silence, are detailed in the following pages. They are laid
before the Public, as they occurred; and my only motive is to show, that
in private, as well as in the capacity of a Journalist, I have never ceased
my labours for the Public, and to give the world an opportunity of judging
how my enterprise and deserts have been appreciated by the present
Government of Van Diemen’s Land.

The objects of this early Society were “to provide relief in sickness and
old age, for a considerable number of Females, and to promote among
them, particularly those educated in the School of Industry, a frugal and
industrious spirit.”
No copies of this pamphlet were known to exist until the discovery of one
in private possession in November, 1946. This copy is now in the Mitchell
Library.
The chief mover in this welfare work was Mrs Darling, wife of the

Roman Catholic Church-New South Wales-Intended Church
Hyde Park, Sydney.
Extract / (From The Gleaner New South Wales Newspaper
conducted by the Rev. L.H. Halloran, D.D.) / = = = / [Text
begins.] Our attention was recently attracted by the melancholy
aspect of that elegant, / but unfinished pile of buildings, in Hyde
Park, intended as a place of Divine Wor- / ship for our “Roman
Catholic Brethren.” We were present, when the first stone / was
laid by Governor Macquarie, and we then indulged the
anticipation, “that commenced under such favourable aus-
pices, the structure would speedily rear it’s / head, in awful gran-
deur, toward that Heaven, for the adoration of whose Almightly
/ Sovereign it was dedicated, ...” / Nearly six years have since
elapsed, and not only does it remain unfinished, but its walls
appear in a state of incipient dilapidation, and decay, / from long
exposure to the elements, without the protection of roof or
covering!. . .

from the Select Committee of the House of Commons, of which Horton was
Chairman. The argument relates itself generally to the United States and
Canada but there is a reference to New South Wales and Van Diemen’s

Threlkeld gives interesting particulars of his experiences in conducting
the Mission to aborigines at Lake Macquarie, New South Wales. Many
difficulties and discouragements had been encountered. The annual cost of
the mission is likely to be £5OO, including £lBO for the support of the
missionary, his family and servants. The aim of the Circular was to obtain
the support of the London Missionary Society in the work. The Circular
is signed by Threlkeld. This is the Circular referred to in Bibliography

These prayers were used by chaplains in their ministrations to prisoners
of the Crown in New South Wales (including Norfolk Island) and Van

Prayer at the Time of Execution are most impressive and affecting.

the probable future state of this second America, in which the British
name is to receive a farther accession of glory; but without, we hope,
a second diminution of empire by the arbitrary attempts of weak and
wicked ministers to keep it in a state of unnatural obedience.”

A Mr Wall and an officer belonging to Mary-la-bonne Workhouse,
appeared at the Mary-la-bonne Police Office with a boy about six years old.
Wall stated that he had formerly kept a boarding-school at Streatham, but
had sold the establishment with the pupils, to a Mr Rowcroft; that the child
then by his side had been returned on his hands by Mr Rowcroft, who, he
imagined, was apprehensive that as the child was illegitimate, and the
parent had gone to India, he would not be paid for him.
The magistrate ordered the return of the child to Rowcroft and, without
hearing his version, passed certain strictures upon his conduct. Rowcroft
defended himself by publishing this pamphlet. He purchased this school
after his return from Tasmania, where he had been a magistrate. For his
career in Australia, and his work as a writer of Australian fiction, see Aus-
tralian Literature, by E. Morris Miller, Melbourne, 1940, vol. I, pp.

Bvo. Pp. viii (last blank), 194, [ii] (book advertisements). Frontispiece
and 2 other plates. Red and also green “diaper” cloth boards, blind
stamped ornament on front and back covers; gilt lettering “Alfred Dudley”
and ornament on spine. Also navy blue cloth boards with eilt lettering:
“Alfred Dudley” on spine.
This is probably a secondary binding of the middle “thirties.”
A former owner of the copy in the National Library, Canberra, has
written m the name of William Howitt as the author. No authority has,
however, been found for this assertion. The author appears to have been
Mrs G.R. Porter (from a trade list of Charles Knight).
This tale for juveniles is founded on the circumstances of a gentleman,
with his highly-educated son, settling in Australia, and there for a long
period cheerfully submitting to all the hardships and privations attendant
on such a situation. The author s knowledge of Australian natural history
and ethnology is admittedly drawn from The Present State of Australia , by
Robert Dawson, late Chief Agent to the Australian Agricultural Company.
A second edition of Alfred Dudley was published in 1836, London: Harvey
and Darton, 12m0., pp. iv, 196, dark red cloth.

The crew of the wrecked vessel landed on Elizabeth’s Isle in 1820, and
after six days the captain and most of the crew put to sea again. Chappell,
who was second mate, and two companions remained on the island, and
were eventually rescued by Captain Raine in the Surry. They proceeded to
New South Wales. Chappell was for some months on board the Supply , and
afterwards in the Kent. He returned to London in 1823.

Creatures, who go to Swan River, Van Dieman s Land, Botany Bay,
Canada, Nova Scotia, or any English Colony, they merit neither my care nor
my pity. They have been duly warned; they are slaves by nature or by

“... Australia, a colony entirely of British growth, and possessing the
first natural advantages of the known world, seems of all others the best
adapted for emigration. The very distance is an advantage to our shipping;
and the incalculable extent of territory opens boundless sources of wealth,
employment, and investigation.
The first desideratum towards effecting a beneficial alteration in this col-
ony, would be to relieve it, as far as possible, from the imputation of a convict
Colony, especially of the most infamous class of offenders.
The transmission of Hunt, the notorious accomplice of Thurtell; of the
Coxes, for the Shrewsbury murder; and others of similar atrocity, produced
the greatest injury, by extending this prejudice ” (Pp. 32-3).
The author makes suggestions for the promotion of the emigration of free
settlers of a good class, such as half-pay pensioners, to New South Wales.
At p. 47 he quotes “Mr. Gregory Blaxland of Paramatta, the largest
proprietor of vineyards in the Colony,’’ as declaring “his conviction, that
wine will shortly become a staple article of export.’’

Penal / Servitude! / / [Poem begins:
“I have just arrived from Australia,
Where I have been for change of air;
And, chaps, I have just come to tell you,
That there is a lot of jolly living over there.
Chorus
Where they feed you, and they clothe you,
Better than a working man or soldier
Penal servitude is the sort of life for me;
Then we do a bit of work just a portion of the day,
And then we go to church upon a Sunday, O.
Man O, my yar, yar, yar yar!
Give me penal servitude before the Union.”

Intended for the information of those contemplating settling in Van
Diemen’s Land. Some of the statements are quite unalluring to an immi-
grant, e.g. “Water is scarce and bad, being brought in carts from a filthy
and generally muddy rivulet, it is sold at Is. per hogshead.’’
“Domestic Servants, Male and Female, are as bad as possible, whether
Free or Convict; their Wages very high, and mode of living extravagant.’’
Other items have value in tracing the economic history of Van Diemen s
Land, e.g. “Carpenters and Bricklayers Wages, from Bs. to 12s. per day,
but they frequently earn from 15s. to 20s. when working piece work.’’
“Day Labourer’s Wages are from 4s. 4d. to 6s. per day, but they
generally earn more when working by the piece.”

The narrator sailed on board the Ocean on a voyage with convicts to New
South Wales in 1815. A quarrel arising with the Captain, Rutherford
shipped himself on board the Agnes of Boston, for the purpose of trading for
pearl, tortoise-shell, and sandal wood, among the islands of the Southern
Pacific Ocean.
On the first day of February, 1816, the Agnes left Rio de Janeiro, arriving
at Otaheite on the Ist of May. Thence she proceeded for the purpose of
trade amongst the pearl islands; and after touching at many others, arrived
off New Zealand. The Captain intended to water at the Bay of lslands,
where the missionaries were located, but a strong gale of wind arising pre-
vented the vessel making the Bay of Islands and drove her into a bay
(‘Tocomardo’) where no vessel had previously called. The natives attacked
the ship’s company, who were killed and eaten by the Maoris, Rutherford
alone surviving. Eventually he took the two daughters of the Chief in mar-
nage and himself became a Chief of power. stay,’’ he writes, “among
these inhuman savages was ten years, during which mournful period my
eyes were never blessed with the sight of a European. I escaped in the
American discovery bri g Avenger, being sent by the natives to decoy her into
their power, on the 18th of January, 1827; she was commanded by Captain
Jackson, who carried me to the Brazils, from whence I returned to England
in his Majesty’s ship La Blanche . ”

The writer tries to dissuade emigrants from going to British America or
Australia. “Much has been said of late, of the advantages to be derived
from emigrating to New South Wales, Van Diemen’s Land, and the Swan
River, and many have ventured voluntarily to transport themselves even to
those distant and less civilised regions.”

Published monthly, sold at 12s. a hundred, and for 300, taken at once,
11s.” The references to Australia in the two volumes are as follows;
(a) In Vol. I, at p. 209 (March, 1831) a terrifying account of Australia
and the voyage thither:


But, alas! they [the Government] appear to have far other intentions;
they appear to have Australia (as they call it); or, Nova Scotia, New
Brunswick, or Canada, in their minds [as spheres for Emigration], Now,
mark me, this Australia is part of a great wild country in the South Seas,
to get to which requires nine months or twelve months of sea passage; to
survive such a voyage is quite enough for a young and stout man; and, as
to women and children, how are they to survive it, crowded together in the
hold of a ship, that ship knocked about by storms and tempests, the ears
dinned with the rattling of the thunder, and the soul terrified by the dreadful
flashes of lightning. Besides, have you not read of the dismal fate of the poor
creatures who have gone to that country; is not that enough to make you
cling even to your beggarly hovels and your potatoes, rather than expose
wives and children that you love to sufferings like those? Australia, or Swan
River as it is sometimes called, or Botany Bay, or Van Diemen’s Land, which
are all different parts of the same horrid country. To none of those will any
man go who is plainly told what they are, and who has common sense left
in his mind.”
(b) In Vol. 11, at p. 17 (July, 1831) a very dismal description of Botany
Bay:
“I have given you a fair specimen of the sort of liberty enjoyed in the
British colonies. I knew it well before; I could give you a description of all
the wretchedness of living in those colonies; but I have chosen to content
myself with this one authentic undeniable proof; and, with that proof, I am
sure that you will be satisfied. It is not, however, of this species of liberty
that you would most feel the want: it is of the real bodily sufferings of which
I think most, and against encountering which I wish to guard you. To go
to Botany Bay, to which they now give the pretty name of Swan River, Sidney
Settlement, Van Diemen’s Land, and the like, is to go a nine months’ voyage,
to begin with; and then, if you outlive that voyage, to encounter every
hardship that tongue or pen can describe.”
(c) In Vol. 11, at p. 219 (May, 1832) there is another gloomy reference:
“As to New South Wales, as it is called, and Van Diemen’s Land, the
distance, in the first place, makes the voyage a terrible undertaking. When
arrived, you depend on the public authorities for a grant of land. If you
have money to purchase pieces of ground already cleared and cultivated,
your servants are convicts, and you are at the joint mercy of them and the
murdering natives. Even for the services of the convicts, your sole depen-
dence is on the pleasure of the public authorities; and, in short, you are
infinitely more dependent than any rack-renter under the most greedy and
tyrannical Borough-monger in England. If you find yoursell miserable and
wish to return, preferring the wretched state that you have left to that which
you find, your means of return are gone, and you have to undergo another
voyage of seven or eight months, and to return to England a dejected and
broken-hearted beggar.”
In this fashion Cobbett condemned emigration to the Australian Colonies
as proposed by the Government.

Dobie on the Crawfurd Peerage.
“When Mr. Crawfurd made his appearance as the Claimant of the estate
of Kilburnie, it is not to be disguised, that there was a considerable degree
of feeling in his favour. His statement might be true, and sympathy is easily
excited in favour of one who is believed to be the representative of an
ancient family, but who is without the means of establishing what are con-
sidered to be his just right. After Mr. Crawfurd was tried, and found guilty
of using forged documents in support of his claim to the honours and estates
of Crawfurd and Lindsay, much of the interest in his favour ceased. Some
delay, however, took place in sending him to New South Wales, in terms
of his sentence, and, in the meantime, strong exertions were made by his
friends to get the execution of this sentence still further delayed. Of this,


hopes were entertained in various quarters, but these proved fallacious. I
did not know Mr. Crawfurd until after his return from Botany Bay, and
was not consulted in any way whatever by or for him at any stage of his
proceedings prior to his trial and transportation. ... While Mr. Crawfurd
was in New South Wales, his wife came repeatedly to me, stating the great
hardships and difficulties of her situation, and the many privations under
which she and her children were struggling. She then put into my hands
the papers which she had collected in relation to her husband s claims . . .
The author was, on perusal of these documents, induced to think “there
was something in the case which seemed not to have been fairly
investigated, and which still called for enquiry ...” “After Mr. Crawfurd’s
return from transportation”, he continues, “he called on me, and showed
me the pardon he had procured from Governor MacQuarrie; and expressed
a wish that I should do anything I could for him .. . The author, after
further investigation, repudiated Crawfurd s claims.

This curious work has some minor Australian references, serving to illus-
trate the growing interest in the colonies there.
Thus, as a proof that the practice of athletic exercises is not confined to
the United Kingdom, or, even to Europe, the account of an entertainment
(wrestling and boxing) given in the island of Tongatabu to Captain Cook
m his third voyage to the Pacific Ocean is quoted (see pp. 31-2).
At p. 91 there is an article on the Extirpation of Beasts and Birds Ref-
erence is there made to the fact that the Kangaroo and Emu are retreating
rapidly before the progress of colonization in Australia, which must lead to
the extirpation of both.
At p 173 a fight between a terrier and an opossum brought to England
from New South Wales is minutely described.

Extracts from Letters, written by a Gentleman lately established
on the Swan River, in Western Australia. Dublin; William
Underwood, 1832.
See No. 1574 b for full bibliographical details. A copy was offered by
Maggs Bros Ltd in Voyages and Travels in all Parts of the World. A Descriptive
Catalogue, Vol I (1942) Part X, Cat. 719, item 945, with the following
note:-A very rare little work by one of the earliest settlers in Western Aus-
tralia. The first eight pages give an introductory account of the colony as
far as was then known, and the remainder of the pamphlet an extremely
interesting account of the writer’s experiences. The first letter is dated from
Perth 12 Nov., 1830. “On Sunday came to the mainland, where the
embryo town of Freemantle is situated on the beach.” He went up the Swan
River with a party of soldiers and captured some natives who were
plundering a house.
In his next letter he mentions the kindness he had received from Captain
Irwin, and describes his search up the Canning River for a place to settle.
He takes up a grant near the head of the navigable part of the Swan River,


and speaks of three town sites being laid out, namely Northam, York, and
Beverly. An account is given of the birds and animals he found in the
country and the prices of various supplies. During his first two months the
population of his part of the country had risen from ten to ninety-seven.
In Vol. 11, Part V (Cat. no. 732, item 946) of the same collection, p. 260,
a copy of Extracts from the Letters and Journals of George Fletcher Moore Esq., now

New South Wales-Governor and Council-Proclamations, Govern-
ment Orders and Notices
Proclamations, Government Orders and Notices (NSW')
1825-1832. " v ’
1 vol. 31.5 x 21 x 5 cm. Bound in half calf with marbled paper sides.
This is a collection of Proclamations, Government and General Orders
and Government Notices commencing from 20 December 1825 and con-
cluding January 1832 (the official Government Gazette commenced publication
m March 1832). It was presumably made for the Supreme Court. This
volume does not contain the acts which are in the Public General Statutes
of NSW. The proclamation, acts, orders and notices were bound in annual
volumes (see below) and were also published in the newspapers but this
volume makes them readily accessible for this period. The annual volumes
are listed as follows: 1825-26: Bibliography 1/1088; 1827- 1/1140- 1828-
1/1287; 1829; 1/1387; 1830: 1/1388; 1831 not listed.
Glued to the back is a petition from Sir John Jamison and others to the
House of Commons seeking trial by jury and a House of Assembly.

Hobart Town Chronicle (1833).
The / Hobart Town / Chronicle / [Volume I. Tuesday 26th
February, 1833. Number L]
A single sheet made up into four pages each 17 x 11 inches and each
divided into four columns. At the foot of the last column on the fourth page
is the announcement;— Hobart Town: / Printed and published at the Hobart-
Town / Chronicle Office in Collins-street, by /James Ross, of Liverpool and Collins
/ streets, aforesaid.
The first note of this rare newspaper seen is contained in an advertise-
ment printed on page 1 of the Hobart Town Courier of January 18, 1833, as
follows: The Hobart Town Chronicle.—The patrons of this periodical are
respectfully informed that owing to peculiar circumstances connected with
the mechanical arrangements, the publication of the first number is
mavoidably postponed till Tuesday the sth of February, on the morning of
which it will be published at the new office in Collins-street, and forwarded
to the country subscibers by the afternoon’s post.”
As mentioned above publication was further delayed until February 26,
1833.
A Short leading article in the first issue expresses the opinion that ‘ “The
Hobart Town Chronicle”, which now for the first time sees the light, may
live as time revolves to be perused by many eyes,’ but gives no reason for
its publication. An advertisement, however, printed on March 12 calls the
attention of the public to ‘this Journal, which upon principle, it is hoped,
deserves more than any that has yet appeared in the Colony, to be called
the Journal of the People.” Its price is so moderate, that it comes within
the compass of almost every individual in the island, while the leading
features that characterise its management render it a desirable acquisition
in the Cottage even of the most humble. Every number contains one or two
articles on subjects of the most pressing moment that affect the general
welfare of the colony; handled with the same independent spirit that has so
long distinguished the columns of the Courier...’
By this time the first page carries, to the left of‘Chronicle’, the announce-
ment: “This Journal contains every Official Notice in the Hobart Town
Gazette.” To the right is found: “Price 255, per Annum, 6s, 6d. per Quar-
ter, or 6d per Number.” The last number appeared on Tuesday, July 2,
1833, as Number 18, but it is a curious fact that the issues for March 12
and 19 are both quoted as “Number 3”, that of March 26 as “Number
4 , and so on consecutively, so that the total number of issues appears to
have been nineteen. A leading article in the last number explained that,


although public patronage had been beyond expectation, yet mechanical
difficulties, a shortage of compositors, and the over-riding claims of govern-
ment printing compelled suspension of publication “for the present”.
Subscribers were promised copies of the Courier instead.
The unique file in the possession of Mr. Philip L. Brown, Geelong,
Victoria, belonged originally to George Augustus Robinson, Protector of
Aborigines.

This is a second impression of this tract (first published in November
1833) with a slightly different setting of the title-page, the world “Quakers”
being italicized. It is also undated, but in a volume of Friends’ Tracts
bound up for George Washington Walker in 1837, now in the National
Library, Canberra, the arrangement of which appears to be chronological,
it follows the tracts printed in 1834. It seems probable, therefore, that the
second impression was issued in 1834.

Great Britain and Ireland-Colonial Office-Circulars on land and
emigration.
Downing Street / 12th July 1834. / Sir, / In reference to the
correspondence .. . relative / to the granting of lands in the Col-
onies to discharged Soldiers . . . [Text proceeds]
Fcap folio. Pp. 199-205. Lithographed copies of four handwritten circu-
lars, the first from the Colonial Secretary, Spring-Rice, to the Secretary at
War, stating that owing to the increased value of land in the colonies, no
further land grants were to be made to discharged soldiers; the second dated
12th August 1834, from the Colonial Secretary to the Military Secretary to
the General Commanding in Chief, stating that not all officers in the army
should receive land grants in the .Colonies chaplains, commissariat
officers, officers of any of the civil departments connected with the army,
and ex-officers were not to receive grants of land, and those who did receive
grants in a colony must reside in the colony; the third circular is “Extract


of a Report from the / Commissioners of Emigration to the / Secretary of
State for the Colonies, / dated 15th March 1832”, and gives the Commis-
sioners’ opinion that Crown lands in the colonies should no longer be given
away to emigrants, but that working people should start in the colonies by
earning their living at the occupation they followed at home, and purchas-
ing land out of their savings; this was possible because of the high wages
paid in Canada and Australia. The fourth circular is “Extract of a Notice
published by the / Commissioners of Emigration respecting / the British
Colonies in North America” and states that land is no longer given away
there, but sold, the price being reasonable (4/- to 15/- an acre), so that poor
emigrants could save enough by working for wages to buy land.

The definitive edition of the English Master Surgeon, who “raised sur-

The editor, James Frederick Palmer (1804-1871), came to Melbourne in
1840. Here he undertook only limited medical practice, and engaged in
political and business activities. He became one of the most influential
citizens of the colony, and was associated with the main social, educational
and legislative advances of his time. Palmer’s numerous public positions
included Mayor of Melbourne (1845), Member for Port Phillip of the
N.S.W. Legislative Council (1847), and M.L.C. and Speaker of the first
Victorian Parliament (1851). He was one of the founders, and later Presi-
dent, of the Melbourne Hospital, and laid its foundation stone in 1846. He
was knighted in 1857.

see the Australian, March 8, 1836, p. 2, column (e).
The fact of Australian Tracts, No. I being a reissue of No. iv of the New
South Wales Literary, Political and Commercial Advertiser would account for the
identity of pagination (38-50) and of printer (H. Bull) in each case.

In a letter from Bowen to the Rev. Samuel Marsden he states that he
intends to offer himself for Holy Orders (see Marsden Papers, Vol.l. Let-
ters to Rev. S. Marsden 1794-1837. [A 1992].) He asks Marsden to add
his signature to his (Bowen’s) Testimonials. He forwards a copy of his book
“now on the point of publication, which contains an exposition of my views
on the subject of religion.”
There is also a letter from Bishop Broughton to Marsden asking his
opinion as to whether the doctrines avowed in the book agree with the tenets
of the Church of England, dated August 10, 1837. (Marsden Papers [C.
244] pp. 185-8).
Both these letters are preserved in the Mitchell Library, Sydney.
Because of the theological views expressed in “The Language of The-
ology Interpreted”, the Rev. H.T. Styles of St. Matthew’s Church,
Windsor, refused to administer the Holy Communion to the author. For
an account of the ensuing controversy, see the Colonist, voI.III, No. 126
(May 25, 1837). The estate of the author was located near Mount Tomah
between Bilpin and Bell, New South Wales.

A copy of this pamphlet was enclosed in a letter of 28 December 1835
from Henry Melville to Sir George Grey, Under Secretary of State for the
Colonies. Both the pamphlet and the letter deal with the Bryan case,
Melville’s reporting of it and his subsequent imprisonment. It reprints his
petititon to the House of Commons dated 21 December 1835. The petition
was received by the House of Commons on 28 June 1836 (see Commons
Journals, 1836, p. 576). The work was apparently only published in London,
possibly being circulated amongst Members. In a despatch of 1 June 1836
Lord Glenelg writes to Lieutenant-Governor Arthur 4< lt would be unnecess-
ary to pursue any further the discussion of Mr. Melville’s case, but for the
very singular statement made in ... his pamphlet;” therefore the
implication is that Melville wrote it.

[Text begins: In Presbytery, / November, 1836.
/ Dear Brethren, / Having met together, in an official capacity,
for the first time, recognised by the British and Colonial / Gov-
ernments, as a Church Court, in full connection with the Church
of Scotland, one of the Established / Churches of the British
Empire, to which will henceforth be entrusted, by these high
authorities, the / direction and superintendence of the
Presbyterian Churches in the Colony, and the Spiritual interests
/ of Ministers and people, the Presbytery of New South Wales
feel desirous to exercise with commend- / able zeal and Christian
affection... .]


Fcap folio. Pp. iv. N.P., N.D. [Sydney, 1836.]
The address, which refers to the negotiations resulting in the recognition
by the British and Colonial Governments of the Presbytery as a Church
Court in full connection with the Church of Scotland, and the general grant
of State aid to religion, is signed by Rev. Kirkpatrick D. Smythe, Moder-
ator, and Rev. John M’Garvie, Presbytery Clerk. The fact that
Presbyterian schools are debarred from State endowments is deplored.

Anonymous. Thomas Greenwood in his Edward Edwards: the chief pion-
eer of municipal libraries (London, 1902) states (pp. 144-5) that this book
is more the work of Edward Edwards than of James Macarthur. The his-
torical part was written mainly by Edwards. “The intimate knowledge of
the colonist Macarthur was supplemented by the youthful freshness of mind
which Edwards brought to the preparation of the book’’ (p. 145). In the list
of the writings of Edwards in the appendix to Greenwood’s biography (p.
223) appears this item:
1837. New South Wales: its State and prospects (written in conjunction
with the late James Macarthur, of Camden, N.S.W., 1837.)
For a close examination of the question of authorship see Edward
Edwards. His Association with “New South Wales: its Present State and
Future Prospects,’’ by John Metcalfe (Sydney: The Public Library of New
South Wales, 1952).
Contains ( inter alia) articles by the Rev. John Dunmore Lang, D.D., and
the Right Rev. J.B. Polding, D.D., on the present state and prospects of
the Presbyterian Church and Roman Catholic Church respectively in Aus-
tralia, emigration, education, etc. Many important documents are printed.
A copy in the National Library, Canberra, has interesting annotations
by Archdeacon Scott.

Known from a reference in an article entitled “The History of the Press
in Western Australia”, in the Swan River News, London, Jan. Ist, 1847, No.
37, and from advertisements in the Perth Gazette. The Report was first pub-
lished serially in the Perth Gazette, in the issues dated Oct. 13, 1838; Oct.
20, 1838; Oct. 27, 1838; (Vol. VI, Nos 302-304); the first advertisement,
which was in the following terms, of the forthcoming publications appeared
in the Perth Gazette, Oct. 20, 1838, Vol. VI, No. 303: “Shortly will be
Published / A Pamphlet / on the present state and condition / of the Colony
of / WESTERN AUSTRALIA. / COMPRISING His Excellency / Sir
James Stirling’s Statistical / Report, addressed to the Secretary for / the
Colonies, and / The Report of the Committee appoint- / ed by the Agri-
cultural Society. / As only a limited number of copies of / this Pamphlet
will be struck off, parties / desirous of obtaining one or more copies / are
requested to attach their names to / the subscription list, now open at the
/ office of this paper, as early as possible. /”


This advertisement was repeated in all the following issues of the Perth
Gazette, until Nov. 24th, 1838, Vol. VI No. 308, when the advertisement
appeared as follows:
“Just Published / A PAMPHLET / on the present state and condition
/ of the colony of / WESTERN AUSTRALIA, / COMPRISING His
Excellency / Sir James Stirling’s Statistical / Report, / addressed to the
Secretary for / the Colonies; and / The Report of the Committee appoint-
/ ed by the Agricultural Society. / As only a limited number of copies of
/ this Pamphlet are struck off, parties / desirous of obtaining one or more
copies / are requested to make an early applica- / tion, to prevent disap-
pointment. / Gazette Office, Perth, Nov. 23. /”
The advertisement was not repeated.
There is no copy of this very rare publication in the Public Library of
Western Australia.

“James Backhouse and G.W. Walker, from England, who were engaged
in a religious visit to some of the South Sea Islands, published an address
to the prisoners, which having been submitted to the Governor, was exten-
sively circulated. Phis address had been read to the assembled prisoners on
Goat Island, by a Catechist, who a few days after found the above letter
folded up and placed in his Bible by the writer.” (P. [s]).
Ihe letter, dated from Goat Island, February 4, 1837, expresses the
grateful acknowledgements of the Convict to Backhouse and Walker for
their address, and recounts his life story. “The prisoners on Goat Island,”
he writes, “are principally employed in quarrying stone and in building a
Powder Magazine, &c.”

The “Coquille”, under the command of Captain Duperrey, visited
Sydney in 1824, remaining there from 17th January to 20th March. King
Bungaree, a very quaint figure, who spoke a little English, waited upon the
Frenchman, with his retainers. The aborigines are fully described, and the
excursions and observations of the visitors recorded. The official history of
the voyage was not published, and the only contributions to it are in these
volumes and in the “Observations personelles” of M. D’Urville, then an
officer of the vessel, published in Vol. 111, p. 673, of the “Voyage of the
Astrolabe”. M. Lesson was naturalist of the “Coquille”. Vocabularies of
some of the places visited, including New South Wales and New Zealand,
are given. See also Bibliography 11/2533 and 111/2788 for other editions.

An argument for the comparative security of steam vessels.
During a period of twenty-three years, since 1817, 33 British steamers
have been wrecked; during the same period, the same calamity has prob-
ably occurred to more than 15,000 sailing vessels belonging to the British
mercantile marine.
As instances of ship-wreck of a much more awful character than any that
have ever occurred to steamers, the author cites ( inter aha)'.
The Amphitrite, convict ship, on her passage to New South Wales,
wrecked off Boulogne, (1833), when 136 lives were lost; and the George
111., from London to Hobart Town, lost near the Derwent in 1835, when
134 lives were lost (p. 3).


A schedule of accidents to steamers is given, see pp. 41-52.

Bvo. Pp. x, 192. Colophon: J. Cunningham, Printer, Crown-court,

Published under the name “Publicola” but by D.J. Williams. A bitter
attack on Tory Ministers. Letter 1 (pp. [IIJ-12) is entitled “Robbery by
wholesale-the Parsons in New South Wales.”
“At the period when all men, without any distinction whatever, are
vehement for an abolition of tithes, and for a reform of the Church, our
Government has had the unparalleled audacity to establish the Colony of
New South Wales on the principle of giving not one-tenth of the produce,


but one-seventh of the whole of the land itself, to the established clevgy !!! However
Tory Ministers may be checked in iniquities at home by the dread of the
press, they take their revenge by trampling all things under their cloven feet
when they can show their power in a colony. The clergy of New South
Wales, not content with possessing one-seventh of the superficies, by
admeasurement, of their immense territory-nor content that this seventh
shall be the best in the land, they actually take from the colonial revenues
18,000 1. per annum. Notwithstanding this, they totally neglect, as they
have done in Europe, the academic instruction of the people, and when a
Dissenter [ i.e. Dr Lang] to his infinite honour, exerts himself to establish
a college in the colony, the clergy are full of ecclesiastical fury against both
the man and his excellent plan for benefitting his fellow-creatures. Was it
Lord Bathurst that decreed the reserves of one-seventh of the land of a
whole colony, and one-seventh of the customs levied on a whole population,
for the support of the clergy of a single sect? Whoever it was, what does
he deserve at the hands of public justice?.. .”

is to be found, in almost every part of the kingdom, and

A plea that the American and Canadian prisoners still in captivity for
their participation in the Canadian Rebellion may be set at liberty. “There
are now about 150 citizens of the United States, who were captured by the
military forces of Great Britian in the Canadas during the late revolutionary
movements, still held by that government as prisoners of State. They have
been sent to Van Diemen’s Land, one of the British penal colonies, where
they have been reduced to the condition of common felons; and thrust into
a convict station with thieves, robbers, burglars and others of the vilest of
the overflowings of the prisons of the British empire-without sufficient food
or necessary clothing they are being compelled to labour for unreasonable
hours at the most servile employment; and made subject to the lash and
other severities, unusual to be inflicted by civilized people ...’’
A list of “captive patriots now imprisoned at Van Dieman’s Land’’ is
given at pp. 166-7.
A type-script note inserted in the copy of this work in the Mitchell
Library, Sydney, states; “The author, Thomas Jefferson Sutherland, died
at lowa Mission, Nebraska Territory. He printed a paper in this city . . .
subsequently published an anti-masonic paper in Schenectady, then a paper
in Troy, and one in Westchester County. He was an officer under General
Bolivar in South America ... having been one of the leading spirits in the
Canadian Rebellion, where he received the title of General.”
A very rare Canadian Rebellion item.

“ The Company was established and incorporated (and is now in full
operation) to carry out in Australia a principle which has been acted on with
great success elsewhere, namely, that of taking up money in this country,
at a moderate rate of interest, on the credit of a large invested capital, and
laying it out on undoubted freehold security at a higher rate. The Company
is now prepared to grant transferable notes under the Corporation Seal, to
persons desirous of advancing Money to the Company on loan. The notes
will be for £lOO each, or any larger sum desired by the lender, and will be
made payable at any period which may be agreed upon, not being shorter
than two years ...”
“The Colonial Board has been established in Sydney, and the operations
of the Company are at present confined to New South Wales.”
The Chairman of the Colonial Board in Sydney was Hastings Elwin, and
the other members were Alexander Macleay, Thomas Barker, Richard
Jones and John Lamb, to be joined by Thomas Icely, who was a Director
in London and was then on his way to Sydney. The Solicitor was James
Norton.

The Bank opened its doors on November 1, 1834. It was conducted until
1848 by a number of persons on a co-partnership basis. In 1848 the Bank
was reconstituted, every proprietor of the old Company having the right to
an equivalent number of shares in the new Company then established. The
Act to incorporate the new Bank was assented to on June 17, 1848.
The first half-yearly meeting of the shareholders of the original Bank was
held on January 16, 1835. This Report has not been seen but it is printed

The assizes they are over now, the Judge is gone way,
But many aching hearts are left within the town today;
Tho crime is bad, yet poverty’s made many one to be
A transport from his native land, and cross the raging sea.]
Another verse runs:
Oh would our Rulers make a law for man to earn his bread,
And Make sufficient wage to keep his wife and children fed.
The Judge’s would have less to do, and half their pay might
be
Devoted to this public good, and bless society.

Fcap folio. Pp. 4 (last 2 blank). No imprint. N.D. [1842]. Signed at foot:
Abercrombie & Co.
The object of this Company was expressed to be to raise a moderate
capital for the purpose of prosecuting researches for Copper, and other
Mineral ores, on the Great Barrier Island, in New Zealand, where they had
been found to exist in considerable quantities. The prosperity of New South
Wales was to be greatly increased by the success of the venture. The capital
was to be subscribed in Sydney.
“The Great Barrier Island is situated at the mouth of the Thames, in
New Zealand, and was purchased in 1837 for a valuable consideration from
the Native Chiefs by Messrs. W. Webster, Jeremiah Nagle, and W.
Abercrombie, whose title thereto, or a great portion thereof, it is believed
will be forthwith confirmed and ratified by the New Zealand Government,
in accordance with the regulations adopted for the adjustment of land
claims....” The Prospectus is printed on paper water-marked: “1842”,
and the copy in the Ferguson Collection is accompanied by a printed receipt
for the sum of £lO, deposit on ten shares, “in terms of the Prospectus issued
on the Ist September, 1842.” This receipt is dated 12th September, 1842.

The following description of the book has been supplied by Professor
F.W. Robinson, Chairman of the Oxley Memorial Library Advisory
Committee: “Robinson in Australia:
A reading book and a book of instruction for good children by Amalia
(Amelia) Schoppe (nee Weise). Heidelberg, Joseph Engelrnann’s. Publish-
ing House, 1843. A German example of “Die Robinsonaden” -books con-
cerning adventures and experiences of voyages, sailors, etc, inspired by
Defoe’s “Robinson Crusoe’’, which had a tremendous vogue in Germany,
France, and Europe generally. Especially used for the moral edification and
education of children as in “The Swiss Family Robinson’’. The purpose
of this book is clearly given by Amelia Schoppe, who had already written
many popular but instructive books for children. She writes “My purpose
was, as I wrote this new “Robinson” and pictured in it the adventures of
a poor, but intelligent and sturdy boy, to acquaint you at the same time
with a continent of which even many adults still have very little knowledge.
I propose to let you get to know Australia, the last continent to be dis-
covered and still only partly explored, in its climate, geography, botany and
zoology (fauna and flora)”. The hero is William Robinson, son of a
widowed English ship captain, living in poor circumstances in Hamburg.
The father, Captain of the “Fortune”, owned by a Hamburg firm, had
disappeared without a trace. The son set out to find him and had many
adventures in Australia with his Aboriginal friend, Kolbi.”

The following item appears in the Port Phillip Herald, Ist, November,
1844: — ’We have just had presented to us a copy of the Australian Sketch
Book, part 1, No. 1, being a series of progressive studies, in drawing, drawn
on stone, by the Secretary of the Mechanics’ Institute, Mr. Gilbert, and
lithographed by Mr. Ham. The ability displayed by the parties engaged
upon this petite production, combined with its cheapness, induce us to hope
that it will supercede all those of a similar character hitherto imported from
Britain. ’

“To My Young Readers.
My dear little friends:
For this volume of Teller’s Tales I have selected the “Shipwrecked
Orphans, a True Narrative of the Sufferings of John Ireland’’ and a little
child, named William Doyley who were unfortunately wrecked in the ship


Charles Eaton, of London, and lived for several years with the natives of the
South Sea Islands. The remainder of the passengers and crew of this ill-
fated ship were most inhumanly murdered by the savages soon after they
landed from the wreck. The Narrative was written by one of the Orphans,
John Ireland, and I give it to you in nearly his own words, having made
but few alterations in the style in which he tells the story of their sufferings.
This address is signed by Thomas Teller and is dated from Roseville
Hall, 1845.
For the Wreck of the Charles Eaton see Bibliography 11/2905, 2239, 2287

An article in The Australasian, November 28, 1931, “First Days at
Trawalla. A Scottish Invasion,” by Bulgana (A.S. Kenyon) states that
James McGregor Hamilton, with his wife and baby girl and his wife’s two
brothers, Robert and James Kirkland arrived at Hobart in 1838 and soon
after took up land at Trawalla (Vic.). As a result of trying conditions and
failing health the station was let and the Hamiltons (with another child) left
for Melbourne. Hamilton acquired a government billet, and his wife
“broken in health, returned to her mother in Scotland”. [1841.]
The author is presumed to be Mrs. James McGregor Hamilton, nee
Kirkland.
The pamphlet itself states that “the name “ [Mrs Thomson] “is, for
obvious reasons, fictitious”, and gives the same dates of arrival at Trawalla
(1839) and return to Scotland (1841).

Office, No. 16, Hunter-street,-Jan. 1, 1845. No. 39, July 5, 1845 was the
last number issued.
From the Introductory Address” in No. I, the paper appears to have
been a general one, although the subtitle “Newspaper for the City and the
Bush and the Chronicle of the National Church” indicates its views. The
National Church is the Church of England, and according to a leader
in the Australian, July 3, 1845, pp. 2-3, the paper was a High Church one,
directed against Roman Catholicism. The Australian says the editor was Mr.
C. Lowe, one of the solicitors of the Supreme Court of New South Wales,
and founder of the Lay Association, the doctrines of which the Australian
states are allied to Puseyism.

lack pastoral care. They range from suburbs of Sydney such as
Chippendale, Redfern and Pyrmont, North Shore districts such as Castle
Hill and Dooral [uV] to Queanbeyan-Yass, Murrurundi, Clarence Town

Folio. Pp. 4. Printed in four columns. Weekly. Printed and Published by
the Proprietor, Arthur Sidney Lyon, at the General Printing Office, Albert-
street, North Brisbane, in the Colony of New South Wales. Supplements
(of one page) were occasionally issued.
The first Queensland newspaper. A reduced facsimile of the first number
was issued in The Brisbane Courier , June 20, 1896; and a full-size facsimile
of the same in The Brisbane Courier , June 22, 1926.
Arthur Sidney Lyon, described as “a gentleman of good education,
indomitable energy and respectable connections” and of some journalistic
experience, entered into an arrangement with James Swan, a printer then
employed on Dr. Lang’s paper The Colonist in Sydney, for the printing and
publication of the journal. Later Swan disagreed with Lyon, who resigned,
Swan taking over full control in December, 1847. See “Queensland Pioneer
Journals and Journalists, ” by A.G. Davies, in Hist. Soc. of Queensland-News
Bulletin, March, 1944, pp. 1-2; and “Half-a-Century of newspaper work,
1846-1896 .. . genesis of a daily paper ... a history of the Courier,” in The
Brisbane Courier, June 20, 1896, pp. 7-8.


The paper became The Courier from May 14, 1861 and in 1896, The
Brisbane Courier. In 1933 it combined with The Daily Mail to form The Courier
Mail.

“The partial concession, by the Imperial Government, of those principles

not give effect to these principles The Squatter will become the organ of the
great pastoral interests.”

Diemen’s Land.
Sir Wm. Denison, / &c. &c. &c. / No. 114. / Sir, Downing
Street, July 25, 1850. / [The first paragraph reads] I have had
the honour of receiving your Despatch, / No. 142, of the 27th of
September last, transmit- / ting the half yearly report of the
Comptroller / General of Convicts for the first six months of
1849, / and also your Despatches, noted in the margin, / [No.
116. 13 Aug. 1849. (Par- / liamentary Paper, Jan. 1850, / page
78.) / No. 135. 10 Sept. 1849. / No. 142. 27 Sept. 1849. / No.
147. 2 Oct. 1849. / No. 9. 8 Jan. 1850. /] relating to various
questions connected with the / management and discipline of
convicts. The important information supplied by these com- /
munications on the working of the system of / transportation as
it is at present carried on, has / received the deliberate consider-
ation of Her Ma- / jesty’s Government, and I now proceed to
explain / to you the views we have adopted on the different /
points to which you have called my attention, and / to convey to
you the instructions which seem to be / required for introducing
those improvements in the / existing regulations which additional
experience / of their results has suggested.

Bibliography
of Australia
John Alexander Ferguson was born in New Zealand in
1881, and studied law at the University of Sydney,
graduating with the university medal in logic and mental
philosophy. He was called to the New South Wales Bar
in 1905 and practised mainly in the jurisdictions of equity
and industrial arbitration. He became a judge of the New
South Wales Industrial Commission in 1936, and held
that appointment until his retirement in 1953. He was for
many years a Trustee (and, later, President of Trustees)
of the Public Library of New South Wales, and was also
a Fellow and sometime President of the Royal Australian
Historical Society. He was knighted in 1961.
Ferguson was interested throughout his life in book
collecting and bibliography. By the 1930 s his attention
was concentrated on the preparation of his Bibliography of
Australia , the first volume of which appeared in 1941 and
the last in 1969, just after his death. The original pub-
lishers were Angus and Robertson, a firm with which he
was closely identified; his first wife was a daughter of
George Robertson, its co-founder.
From 1909 Ferguson had a warm and unbroken associ-
ation with the National Library of Australia. Its officers
corresponded with him over many details of his work,
and checked all the entries in his Bibliography. He was a
champion of the development of the National Library,
and decided in 1937 that it should become the home of
his own great collection, which was transferred to
Canberra during a period of more than thirty years,
partly by gift and partly by purchase. The Ferguson
Room in the National Library building commemorates
the Library’s long association with this distinguished
scholar, collector and bibliographer.

Volumes 1 to IV
The Bibliography of Australia of John Alexander Ferguson
(1881-1969) is the standard reference source for printed
matter relating to Australia that appeared between 1784
and 1900. It was first published in seven volumes over a
period of twenty-eight years 1941-1969 and was the
product of fifty years’ work by its compiler, whose life
also combined a distinguished career in law with an
interest in book collecting that resulted in one of the finest
private collections of Australiana ever formed.
Most of the volumes of the Bibliography had been long
out of print when in 1975 the National Library of Aus-
tralia purchased the copyright from Sir John Ferguson’s
estate. The Library issued a facsimile edition between
1975 and 1977, and at the same time foreshadowed the
publication of an expected several volumes of addenda.
The preparation of addenda had begun during
Ferguson’s lifetime, and was carried on, first by his orig-
inal publishers, Angus and Robertson, and later by the
National Library.
This volume contains addenda to volumes I to IV,
covering the years 1784 to 1850. It incorporates all
known titles omitted from those volumes, and includes
the addenda printed in volumes 11, 111, and IV. It is now
possible to search in one place for all addenda up to 1850.
Some entries that appeared in the original Bibliography
have been revised, and some have been assigned new
numbers. A great many additional locations for items
have been added. Many institutions and individuals have
contributed information to the work.
The National Library is engaged (1986) in compiling
the Retrospective National Bibliography, covering the
years 1901 to 1950. This large project is perceived as
filling the gap between Ferguson’s Bibliography of Australia
and the current Australian National Bibliography. Together
the three bibliographies will express a dynamic, continu-
ous theme of Australian bibliography in print, spanning
the years from 1784 to the present and beyond.
