And Its Products.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA is the CENTRAL
STATE of the Australian Commonwealth,
and comprises an area —inclusive of the
Northern Territory —of 578,361,600 acres,
and has a POPULATION ol 380,000.


GOVERNMENT PRODUCE EXPORT DEPARTMENT’S EXHIBIT AT ADELAIDE SHOW.


South Australia
is a Producing Country,
and owing to its IDEAL CLIMATE and its FERTILE SOIL every branch of
Agriculture is carried on with success; the Vine, the Fig, the Olive, and almost
every known Fruit grow luxuriantly; the Pastoral Industry thrives, and
Dairying, Poultry Farming, &c., are important industries.
The Yearly EXPORTS OF PRODUCE from SOUTH AUSTRALIA
exceed in value £9,()()(),000, and the total yearly TRADE is £25,()()(),000 —equal
to £66 per Head of the population.


OF the vast area of SOUTH AUSTRALIA, 120,()()() Square Miles are
Held under PASTORAL LEASES.
There are in the State over 6,000,000 Sheep, and the annual output of WOOL
exceeds 42,000,000 lbs.
Flock of Sheep.


LAND UNDER CULTIVATION is 3,246.835 Acres.
About half of the cultivated area is devoted to WHEAT growing, and in 1907-8
over 20,000,000 bushels of Wheat were reaped, of which more than 17,000,000
bushels were available for EXPORT.
Production of WINE in South Australia
exceeds the total of the other States of the Commonwealth and is yearly
increasing in extent and importance. In 1906 there were 24,000 Acres planted
with 13,000,000 VINES; and 2,845,853 GALLONS of WINE were produced.
So suitable are the soil and climate for Wine Growing that every known type
of wine is produced of excellent quality, and BRANDY is distilled equal to the
best Cognac. In numerous interstate competitions SOUTH AUSTRALIAN
WINES have been awarded the HIGHEST PRIZES, and its BRANDY
has invariably received the CHAMPION AWARD.


Harvesting Wheat.


During recent years the Exportation of FROZEN MEAT
has yearly grown in importance ; the annual Exports having increased in ten
years from 4,000 to 265,000 carcases. Notwithstanding this wonderful expansion,
the Industry is yet in its infancy. The farmers thoroughly recognise the
possibilities of the trade in frozen meat, and they are introducing as quickly as
possible into their flocks the breeds of sheep most likely to produce the
“ ideal freezing carcase.” This industry will continue to expand and in a few
years it is not unlikely that the annual Exports will be ten times as great as those
for the last year.

A Typical Orchard.
FRUIT GROWING is RAPIDLY EXTENDING
and already some 21,000 Acres are utilised for ORCHARDS. The number of
trees of the principal fruits grown are: —755,000 APPLES, 200.000 ALMOND,
161,000 ORANGE, 65,000 LEMON, while the FIG, APRICOT, PEACH,
PLUM, QUINCE, CHERRY, NECTARINE, &c., are largely cultivated, and


over 400,000 CASHS OF APPLES, 130,000 CASHS OF ORANGES, 49,000
CASES OF LEMONS, 9,000 Cwts. OF ALMONDS, as well as enormous
quantities of other fruits, are gathered annually. The OLIVE grows luxuriantly
and from 85,000 trees nearly 20,000 GALLONS of the finest quality of OLIVE
OIL were made last year.
Trade in EXPORTING APPLES and PEARS
to Europe has assumed great importance, and with the improving facilities
offered by Steamship Companies for the effective transport of the fruit, the
growers are enabled to obtain highly remunerative returns in the English and
Continental Markets. SOUTH AUSTRALIAN APPLES and PEARS are justly
considered to be THE BEST, and have realised the highest prices ever obtained.
Exhibits of these fruits at the Shows in London of The Royal Horticultural
Society and The Royal Botanic Society were awarded GOLD MEDALS.


Sultana Vine


Raisin Drying Ground.
Great Quantities of CURRANTS and RAISINS
are produced yearly, and large numbers of APRICOTS, PEACHES, APPLES,
PEARS and PLUMS are dried and placed on the markets of Australia. In 1906
2,225,440 lbs. of CURRANTS and 1,334,928 lbs. of RAISINS were prepared, and
two-and-a-quarter million pounds weight of APRICOTS, PEACHES and other


Fruits were dried. As is the case with other Products, the production of Dried
Fruits has for some time exceeded the local demand. Consignments are now being
shipped to Europe, and there is no doubt that the superior quality of the Fruit
will ensure them a ready and remunerative market. This Industry also is only
waiting a market for its production to rapidly expand.
DAIRY FARMER
is alive to the importance of the EXPORT BUTTER TRADE, and the production
of Butter is annually increasing at an extraordinary rate, as is shown by the fact
that in 1897 the quantity produced was 3,900,000 lbs., and in 1907—8,873,632 lbs.
Every advantage is taken of the improvements made in the methods of production,
manufacture and packing, to obtain the highest possible grade of Butter. In Great
Britain SOUTH AUSTRALIAN BUTTER is considered to be EQUAL IN
QUALITY to the finest grades of Australian Butter, and was awarded the FIRST
PRIZE GOLD MEDAL at the 1906 Dairy Show at the Agricultural Hall,
Islington.


POULTRY FARMING.
The raising of POULTRY and the production of EGGS has so increased
as to now exceed the local demand, and the Export Trade has reached the annual
value of £llB,OOO. Experimental SHIPMENTS to England of DRESSED
POULTRY and of EGGS have proved very satisfactory, and have demonstrated
that SOUTH AUSTRALIA CAN SUCCESSFULLY COMPETE IN THE
BRITISH MARKETS. In consequence of this success, the INDUSTRY IN
SOUTH AUSTRALIA, where both climate and soil are specially suitable, has
UNLIMITED POSSIBILITIES.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA is the BEEKEEPERS’ PARADISE
and it produces the very finest HONEY. This Honey, which is now retailed at
a very reasonable price by several of the largest distributors in Great Britain,
and has been awarded a GOLD MEDAL at the 1907 Show of The Royal Botanic
Society, can,be produced at a low cost and be exported to Europe at remunerative
prices. The output at present does not exceed Id million pounds annually, but is
capable of enormous expansion now that a market has been found for the Honey.


Government Butter Factory.


The Government of South Australia
Helps the Producer to
Help Himself.
It has a DEPARTMENT of AGRICULTURE
which concerns itself with everything likely to aid the DEVELOPMENT OF

many EXPERIMENTAL ORCHARDS and numerous POULTRY FARMS
for the training of Agriculturists, &c., and for the selection, improvement and
development of the types of Cereals, Fruit Trees, Stock of all kinds, and of
Poultry most suitable for profitable cultivation.
It has provided a MODEL AND UP-TO-DATE DAIRY for the reception
from Producers of Cream, to be manufactured into Butter and to be sold in the
local markets, or exported to Europe.


Irrigating Apricot Orchard.
