PREFACE.
Ix this work we have endeavoured to expose the unconstitutional and
despotic powers conferred upon the High Commissioner under the
? Western Pacific Orders in Council ? of 1877-9, powers of a nature
and character utterly abhorrent to Englishmen?s ideas.
We have also given a brief account of the persecutions which Mr.
W. J. Hunt has experienced at the hands of Sir Arthur Gordon as
High Commissioner, and Sir John Gorrie, Judicial Commissioner and
Chief Justice of Fiji, which we hope will tend to shew the danger of
placing such extraordinary powers in the hands of such men, and the
illegal and unjust way in which those powers have been exercised by
them. We have further given an account of the various actions
which Mr. Hunt has brought in the Supreme Courts of Fiji and New
Zealand, in vindication of his rights, and the result of those actions.
We have touched upon the bad effect which the High Commis-
sioner?s policy has had on Australian and New Zealand trade, with
the view of the colonies taking some united action to protect their
trade with the South Seas against the arbitrary and restric-
tive regulations which have been issued, and which are imperilling
such trade, to the advantage of foreign nations. We trust that this
pamphlet may have the effect of calling the attention of the
British and Colonial Public to the necessity of having the Western
Pacific Order in Council repealed or modified, so that properly-con-
stituted Courts may be established, and that British subjects may be
tried for offences on constitutional principles, and not by High Com-
missioners? Courts, which dispense with the palladium of their civil
rights, viz., Trial by Jury.

THE RULERS OF THE PACIFIC.
� For if Gordon and Gome find a grateful day,
Tis in the shade of arbitrary sway.??lbid.
� The first ruler is Sir Arthur Gordon, K.C.M.G., High Commissioner
?of the Western Pacific. He has been Governor of Fiji for nearly
� six years, but has just been removed from that sphere of his m
? management to New Zealand. He is very aristocratic, being the
� son ol an Earl, and afterwards a Court page, whom the Queen
? delighted to honor. He has had several nice sinecures in Colonial
? Governorships. These have always been in Crown Colonies, where
?he has ruled autocratically. In appearance, however, he does not
? show many signs of his noble blood-middle size, thin, lantern ]aws
? sardonic expression, beard, eyeglass, that is the of Sir Ait
? Gordon. Although from others he exacts the strict etiquette usua y
? given to Royalty, he sets a free-and-easy fashion in his own person
? It is not usual to see Her Majesty?s representative m shirt sleeves
? received on board a man-of-war with a guard of honor presen g
?Sms; yet such things have been in Fiji! Sir Arthur is all
� powerful in the Pacific : being afflicted with the colour-blindness of
- Exeter Hall, he believes, or pretends to believe that all_white men
� in the South Seas are murderers and rogues, and that every Native
� is an innocent, peaceful child of nature, whom it is his businessto
? ? protect? and pamper. Sir Arthur is never decently civil or courteous
�to the European residents of Fiji. ? This is not a white man s coun-
?� try,? hesaid recently, addressing the citizens of Levuka, ana he has
? tried his best to make it unbearable for them
?Ruler Number Two is John Gome, Chief Justice of Frp.
? was office-boy to a lawyer in Scotland, and by following the tactics
? of Sirs Joseph Porter and Pertinax Macsycophant, and ? creepm
� and * crawling,? and ? booin? and boom he became at last a limb of
? the law himself. He was ever of the unco? guid, and joined him-
? self to Exeter Hall and the Aborigines? Protection Society. He was
? specially admitted to the Bar before going out to Jamaica to perse-
? cute Governor Eyre. After that piece of work, he obtained a Judge-
? � s hip in the Mauritius, and followed his patron, Gordon to the Fijis,
? where he is the only Judge, and trial by jury being denied there
?he has the power of life and death over all. He is a fine-looking
4. man, with short whiskers and moustache. He wears a scarlet gown


? in o�urfc, and insists upon being called ?my Lord.? His delight is.
t�w�rk himself into an apparent fury of virtuous indignation anent
? the mh uman manner in which the poor Natives are treated.? He
gets these absurdities printed in the Fiji papers, and sends copies home
|to his friends of the Aborigines Protection Society. Then Exeter
� n crs > * t)h, what a good man is Gorrie.? He is the biggest
in the Pacific, and the most dangerous, as he invariably
? takes the part of the Natives against the white settlers. Yet ho
? hears the truth sometimes. I recently gave lectures in Levuka,
<c j? � 4 Never, since the days of Jefferys, had such infamous
<. been g iven from an English Bench, as those of Judge
J Gorrie. I was loudly cheered for this utterance. An inspector
<{ a j? sergeant of police were taking notes of what I said, but I
? should have claimed the privilege of my American citizenship, had
ct an y attempt been made to ? deport ? me, as was threatened. For it
? is not safe to open one?s mouth to criticise the Imperial authorities
?in the South Seas. Sir Arthur Gordon was appointed High Com-
? missioner and Consul-General of the Western Pacific, by an Order
? ? CCoi n dated August, _ 1877. Under this, he and the Judicial
Commissioner, Judge Gorrie, possess absolute power over the liber-
? ties of British subjects in the South Seas, who may be ? deported ?
? at pleasure, and against this there is no appeal. The power of
? deportation has been recently used in a case of which more will yet
urf - Hunt, a gentleman well known in the Western
? Pacific, was Chief Secretary and Prime Minister of the late King
? Malietoa of Samoa. He became obnoxious to Sir Arthur Gordon?
? who served him with an order to leave Samoa within ten days, '
? otherwise he would be conveyed away in a man-of-war, taken to
* L ?vtika, and criminally tried. Mr. Hunt accordingly left, went to
? an d issued a writ against the High Commissioner for �2,000
?? for the enforced loss of the lucrative salary attached to his
? post. The case was tried before Judge Gorrie, and, of course
? dismissed. Mr. Hunt then proceeded to New Zealand, but has
? recently returned to the Islands. He cannot, however escape Sir
? Arthur Gordon?s attentions. Anent this, the Fiji Times of January
? 19th has the following : ?? The ex-Premier of his defunct Samoan
it Majesty is fast becoming a man of mark. On Sunday last, H.M.S.
Cormorant ? Unexpectedly appeared in port, and general curiosity
? was aroused to know the nature of her errand. During the next
? da / transpired that when His Excellency Sir Arthur Gordon,
High Commissioner for the Western Pacific, became aware that Mr.
W. J. Hunt had left Auckland in the s.s. ? Clyde,? with the avowed
? Mention of proceeding to Samoa, in defiance of his order of prohi-
? bit ion, he telegraphed to the Commodore on the Australian Station,
requesting him to despatch a vessel for the purpose of removino >
? him thence, and deporting him to Sydney. This the Commodore-


11 declined to do, and the High Commissioner then telegraphed to the
? Home authorities, with the result that the ? Cormorant ? was directed
�to proceed upon the important and hazardous service. Upon arrival
� in Levuka, it was found that Mr. Hunt was resident in this town,
� and Her Majesty?s cruiser started on her return voyage from her
? wild goose chase yesterday morning. This is a truly dignified
? record for all parties concerned. While the active interposition of
? English men-of-war is required for the protection of British lives in
? the�Western Pacific, their anchors remain down in Sydney Harbour,
? but when a British subject presumes even to threaten to disregard
? the injunction of the High Commissioner relative to his residence
? in one island or another, all the springs of High Commission and
� Admiralty machinery are at once set in motion. Sir Arthur Gordon
? is certainly to be congratulated upon the dignified position in which
�he has placed himself. He has hurled a thunderbolt, and has not
� even crushed a butterfly, and by his injudicious action he has made
? himself and Captain Bruce the laughing-stock of the Southern
� Hemisphere.? This trip would cost the English Government at
? least �1,000.? (Extract from South Sea Massacres, 1881.)
THE WESTERN PACIFIC ORDERS IN COUNCIL OP 1877-9,.
AMD THE DESPOTIC POWERS OF THE HIGH COMMIS-
SIONER UNDER THEM.
The law ! what impertinence to tell us of the law,
Why sir, we are the head and front of all laws here, .
Without our sanction what can presume to be legal.?Gordon & Gome.
Ik the Western Pacific, forbearance has ceased to be a virtue, and the-
time is anxiously looked for, when it will cease to be a necessity. It
has ever been the case, that, in the natural course of national events,
injustice and oppression, wherever their exercise has been attempted,
have roused from its normal lethargy that spirit of liberty which ani-
mates every British breast, which, when it flamed forth, secured for us
the Magna Charta from the hands of an aspiring despot; by reason of
which we have the Bill of Rights, and whereby we now possess that


Constitution which has made England a nation, but which has at the
same time lulled us into a sense of false security. As a people we
have ever been ready to maintain the principles of the Constitution,
hut it has been left to the tinkering politicians of the 19th century to
violate these principles and not to know it. In our fathers? time the
liberties of a British subject were respected and protected, but in our
time these liberties have become a matter for ridicule by those who
were fortunate enough to be outside their vortex, and this has been
done by the men who were elected to protect them. As to the extent
of their success in this direction we call the Western Pacific Order in
Council to bear witness.
The late Government (Beaconsfield) were at some hands accused of
legislating in a manner which was not law-giving, but leave-giving;
but in this Order in Council we have brought to light the concen-
trated reverse of the leave-giving, for in this there is neither leave nor
liberty.
Were we to base a reply to the question 11 what is an Order in
Council ? ? from a knowledge of only the Order in question, we should
say that an Order in Council is a piece of make-shift legislation
promulgated by the Privy Council, concocted by an interested
outsider, and intended to benefit the concocter, and to form his ideas
into instruments for the furtherance of an experimental policy and his
own interests in the face of all others.
Some time after the passing of the ? Pacific Islanders Protection
Acts 1872 and 1875,? the eyes of our country-men who hold the out.
posts of civilization in the Western Pacific were directed towards the
Government in the hope that in them also something in the form of
protection might be undertaken; they expected bread and have
received a stone.
The Legislation was expected to be of such a nature as to meet the
requirements of the peculiar circumstances in which our countrymen
are placed, but either owing to these peculiar circumstances, or from
some other reason, which has not been explained, the action of the
House of Commons was to authorize the promulgation of an Order by
the Privy Council. It seems to have been thought that among Her
Majesty?s Ministers, none were qualified to deal with the matter, hence
the evident irregularity of the Order in question, for although the re-
sponsibility of this Order lies with Her Majesty?s Privy Council, we
yet do them the justice to suppose that none of their number would
have incurred the responsibility wittingly.
Parliament never could have intended giving to the ? Queen in
Council? powers to authorize the High Commissioner to do that,
which, under English law, is perfectly subversive of the rights of every
free-born Briton, and against the common law and the Bill of Rights,
yiz., Suspension of trial by jury, in Capital and other offences, and
in prohibition and deportation? from the Western Pacific.


The framer of the ?Order? had to deal as between the British
Legislature, and a section of British Subjects, and though the
somnolence of a careless Ministry, he has dealt out impartial treac e y
to �der to facilitate a general understanding of the provisions of
the order we detail the leading points, which are as follows:
Ist The order is to he administered from Fiji and is to extend to
all islands of the Western Pacific not under the oi
a civilized power, these include the Friendly Islands, W on o )�
The Navigator?s Islands (Samoa), The Solomon
about twelve other groups The order is to.apply�ntah
subjects and British vessels for the time being within this
jurisdiction, and under certain given conditions to
2nd By this order is established the position of Hi ?
signer for the Western Pacific,? a Judicial Commissioner and
Deputies, together with the High Commissioner s Court which
is to professedly hear and try all offences and cases, both civil
and criminal, within their jurisdiction, and is to be
of those members with assessors who are substitutes tor jury
men as established by the law of England. _
The section regarding assessors is worth quoting in full, and
? � 14. An assessor under this order shall be a competent and
?? impartial British subject of good repute, ?
? summoned by the High Commissioner s Court to act as an
? assessor therein, . . ? , . . e
(2). An assessor shall not have any voice in the decision of the
? Court, in any case criminal or civil. _
(S') But an assessor dissenting in a criminal case, from any
1 i decision of the Court, or from the sentence, or dissenting in
? a civil case, from any decision of the Court, may record m
� the minutes of the proceedings, his dissent and the grounds
ii (4) An assessor dissenting shall be entitled to receive, with-
? out payment, a certificated copy of ? the minutes.
This completes the enactment as regards assessors, except the
further general provision that all cases except murder and felony of a
maior nature may be tried summarily and without assessors, t u
establishing Star Chambers in the shape of High Commissioner s Court
in the Western Pacific. We say this not of an not of
a Spanish Inquisition, but of a High Commissioner s Court, of a fetar
Chamber. In the land of Magna Charta, where, we presume* the code
of Alfred is not forgotten or extinct, an Order in Council is issued y
Her Majesty establishing Courts in the Western Pacific depriving
men of their liberties and imprisoning in defiance of the lawsand con-
stitution of Great Britain.


In this body is vested all Her Majesty?s jurisdiction within the
bounds mentioned and the authority is further concentrated by the
enactment that the whole authority of the High Commissioner?s Court
is to be exercised either by the High Commissioner or by the Judicial
Commissioner while either is in the Western Pacific, and that in any
district all the said authority is to be exercised by any one who for
this purpose is appointed to act as a deputy Judicial Commissioner.
By Section 20 it is enacted that each member of the High Com-
missioner s Court exercising for the time being the jurisdiction and
authority thereof in conformity with this order, shall, for the purposes
of this Order, be deemed to form the High Commissioner?s Court. This
Court is to supersede and take the place of the Admiralty Court.
It is further enacted that the jurisdiction of this order shall be, as.
far as possible, exercised on the principles of, and in conformity with,
the statute and other laws for the time being in force in England, and
that the criminal law as to ? what constitutes an offence ? is to be the
same as by the laws of England, plus offences under this Order.
Now, how is it possible for the Queen, by Order in Council, to.
declare that what is not an offence against the criminal law of England,
is an offence against the Order in Council. Sir E. Coke (3 Instil 62)?
says : that Royal Proclamations cannot create any new offence ami
have only binding force when grounded upon and enforced by the
laws of the realm ?.
The most striking, and most un-English-feature of the Order is
that relating to (1) Prohibition and Removal, and (2) Deportation.
The first enacts that where it is shewn to the satisfaction of
the High Commissioner, by evidence on oath, that any British sub-
ject is dissaffected to Her Majesty?s Government or is othewise dan-
gerous, to the peace and good order of the Western Pacific Islands,
the High Commissioner may if he think fit (summarily and without
hearing) prohibit that person from being within the Western Pacific
Islands for the space of two years, under a penalty of two years im-
prisonment for disobedience of the order of prohibition ; and it is further
enacted that an appeal shall not lie under this order against an order
of ? Prohibition or Removal.?
(2) Further it is enacted that, where there is reasonable ground to
apprehend that a British subject is disaffected as aforesaid or dan-
gerous to the peace, he may be called before the court and required
to give security for his good behaviour, failing the forthcoming of
which he may be deported from the Western Pacific Islands to�any
place named in the warrant of deportation; this place to be either
Fiji or some other part of her Majesty?s dominions outside the United
Kingdom?the Government of consents thereto. The obvious
reason of the latter clause of their enactment is to prevent the person
deported reaching a foreign country, where he might obtain naturaliza*
tion, or reach the United Kingdom where he might at least seek justice.


If Her Majesty can legally prohibit and deport British subjects from
the Western Pacific, why was it necessary to submit the ? Coercion
Act ? for Ireland to the Houses of Parliament ?
If the Western Pacific Order in question is legal, then Her Majesty
could, by Order in Council, coerce her subjects in Ireland, and the
submitting of the Coercion Act to Parliament was unnecessary. It
required a special Act of Parliament (which was much questioned and
opposed) even to arrest a man on suspicion of sedition in Ireland.
Perhaps it was thought when the Order was passed, that the right
of appeal in some cases therein sanctioned was sufficient to warrant a
just consideration of the case ; but it must be borne in mind that the
only appeal from the High Commissioner?s Court is to the Supreme
Court of Fiji, and that the Judicial Commissioner under this Order is
at present the Chief Justice of Fiji, so that one Judge decides the
case, and afterwards hears the appeal.
Another point which, to a great extent, affects the vitality of the
Court as an Arbiter of Justice is � 56 (2.) ? The Court may, in any
? case, if it thinks fit, refuse to allow a civil action or proceeding to be
? brought or taken in the Court, unless security to the satisfaction of
? the Court, is first given by deposit or otherwise for the fees and
? expenses of the Court.?
A section worthy of study is the following,?� 31. ?At the trial of
? an accused person, either by summary trial or otherwise, on a
? charge for an offence committed within the Western Pacific Islands,
? and not within the jurisdiction of the Admiralty, the Court may, if
? it thinks fit, from time to time at any stage of the proceedings,
? without previously warning the accused , put such questions to him
? as the Court thinks necessary or proper for arriving at the truth
? respecting the charge, and his answers shall be evidence on the
** charge.?
Again, ?� 31 (7.) ?If the accused refuses to answer or answers
? falsely, any question put to him by the Court, he shall not be liable
? criminally for so doing, but the Court may draw therefrom such
? inference as it thinks fit.?
The interrogation of a prisoner under the Order in question is against
the practice of the Criminal Laws of England, and is only worthy of a
Star Chamber or a French Court. Fonbanque, in ? The Crown, the
Senate, and the Bench,? page 162, says, ?? Therefore, as the first
? object of the law is to protect the weak against the strong, it throws
? every possible shield around the accused, against the abuse of
? power, he is not bound to criminate himself, it is for the prosecution
?to prove his guilt, not for him to prove his innocence. Poor and
? ignorant as the great majority of those accused of crime in all
? countries are, it is an easy task for a practised mind to wring from
? the most guiltless person; by this process of mental torture, some
** contradiction or equivocation that may condemn him.?


The fact that a prisoner may have his refusal to answer an in-
formal question construed according to the Court?s opinion, seems to
be a straining of the law and circumstantial evidence beyond justice.
These are a few of the leading points in the Order. Some of them
are certainly antagonistic to the principles of justice, and against the
British Constitution, but it would be a difficult matter to find anything
to say in favor of this document.
Little could be said in favor of a document which is responsible for
the establishment of the dignity and dignitary of High Commissioner
for the Western Pacific.
It has created a political Ishmael, whose hand is against every man,
and against whom is every man s hand, for we will vow that there are not
in the South Pacific at this moment, apart from the officials under the
Order, three British subjects who will conscientiously give their voices
in favor of the Order.
One clause of the remit from the House of Commons authorizing its
preparation, was to the effect that the Court to be established was
to . be of such a nature as to act in conjunction with the civil and
criminal Courts of the neighbouring Australian Colonies, but the
framers of the Order have rendered this impossible.
.The Court of the High Commissioner is unfit to act in conjunction
with any properly-constituted Court of Justice in the world ; it would
have formed a fit adjunct to the Spanish Inquisition, and ought to be
where that once powerful body now is.
. T^ e Courts of the neighbouring Colonies are for the administration of
justice, according to English law and constitution, and therefore could
not expected to act in conjunction with a Court consisting of a
Commissioner with or without assessors,, the extent of whose power is
to obtain, free of charge, a copy of the minutes of the Court, recording
protest should any have been lodged, for the performance of which
duty the Order calls for u competent and impartial British subjects of
good repute,? as if this class of subjects was so scarce in the Western
Pacific that it were impossible to form a jury.
We have, however, the testimony of Sir Arthur Gordon himself, the
present High Commissioner, in a speech delivered at Levuka, Fiji,
that he expected to find a population of low characters, but had found
instead a peaceable and law-abiding people.
r^^ie . ma Lispring of English liberty is the right of trial by jury, but
that right is denied to the British subjects in the Western Pacific;
the right _of appeal from judgment is also a mockery. In every
instance within this Order, and on the face of its every clause it bears
that its law is for the ?ruler ? and not for the people.
There has been no attempt to govern Englishmen in accordance with
their convicitions and predilections, there has no attempt to govern in
accordance with anything save unmeasured despotism.
But the question will be asked, ? Has there been any complaint or


any undoubted miscarriage of justice, notwithstanding the difficulty
in the way of complaint ?? There has been such.
The most prominent complaint and most flagrant miscarriage of
justice, is that in the case of Mr W, J. Hunt, of Samoa, the chief
features of whose case have come before the public. Mr. Hunt was a
merchant in Samoa in 1877, and in that year a diabolical murder
took place in Apia. An American citizen stabbed another man, in cold
blood, at a public bar in the York Hotel. The murderer was tried
before the United States Consul and four associate judges, and on his
own confession, supported by the evidence, he was found guilty, and
sentenced to be sent to the United States for punishment.
The foreign residents of Samoa, comprising citizen representatives
of all nations, held a meeting to consider the question of the sentence,
and the advisability of hanging Corcoran, the murderer, in Samoa,
not only that this might act as a deterrent, but also from the fact that on
a former occasion, when an Englishman had been murdered by an
American, the murderer, on being sent to the United States for punish-
ment, was released on the plea that the United States Courts had
no jurisdiction over crimes committed by American citizens in foreign
parts, except under treaty relations.
The meeting, by a show of hands and a vote by ballot, recorded 43
votes against 3 to hang the murderer in Samoa, which decision was
duly carried out. This occurred on the 7th November, 1877. In
February, 1878, Sir Arthur Gordon, the High Commissioner under the
Order, arrived in Samoa, and for political reasons, allowed the United
States Consul to prosecute the British Consul (Mr. Cornwall), George
Pritchard, planter, and W. J. Hunt, merchant, for conspiring to
murder the murderer Corcoran. On the 21st February, the charge
against these gentlemen was heard, the evidence being (1) against
Mr. Cornwall, that he stood at the door of the meeting and asked
people to go in, and never warned British subjects ; (2) against Mr.
Pritchard, that he was chairman of the meeting, and that he proposed
all the resolutions, and (3) against Mr. Hunt, that he attended the
meeting, and after the resolution to hang the man had been passed by
a show of hands, he proposed as an amendment, to vote by ballot, the
result of the vote being the same as before, 43 in favor to 3 against
the execution.
The man was accordingly brought out for execution, and cn seeing
Mr. Hunt (who had employed him as a boatman), he appealed to him
to send for a clergyman to give him spiritual consolation, and to pro-
tect him till a clergyman arrived. Mr Hunt sent for a clergyman
(the Rev. Geo. Turner, now in Glasgow), and remained with him until
he received the spiritual consolation which he desired. Corcoran then
gave Mr. Hunt his father?s address, and requested to be blindfolded,
which Mr. Hunt did, and then went out to the place of execution with
the doomed man ; but, as declared by witnesses at the trial, taking no
part in the hanging.


On the face of evidence to the foregoing effect, the Judicial Com-
missioner, Judge Gorrie, better known perhaps as the persecutor of
Governor Eyre, and the friend of Sir Arthur Gordon, discharged Mr
Cornwall (the British Consul) and Mr Pritchard, and against afl spirit
. British law (which establishes that where three persons are in-
dicted for a conspiracy to murder, and two of these are acquitted the
third must necessarily be acquitted) re-indicted Mr. Hunt for murder
and for conspiring to murder Corcoran with persons unknown ! ! ! !
1 his second trial was held on the 23rd February, and the evidence
adduced was the same as in the former trial, viz., that Mr. Hunt had
been at the meeting, and had sent for a clergyman, but had taken no
part in the execution.
The Judicial Commissioner acquitted him of the charge of murder
but found him guilty of conspiring with persons unknown, and sen-
tenced him to 12 months imprisonment.
From this decision Mr, Hunt appealed to the Supreme Court of Fill
the Appellant Court under the Order in Council, and on the excep-
tions which he had taken against the jurisdiction of the Court, which
were as follows :?(1). That as an Englishman he was entitled to a
trial by jury; (2) That the Order in Council only came into force on
the 4th February, 1878, and therefore could not be retrospective to
the 7th November, 1877, and for other reasons.
The appeal was heard in Levuka, Fiji, in April or May, before
Chief Judge Gorrie?the same who had acted as Judicial Commissioner
in Samoa?who gave his decision as an Apellant Judge, upholding the
decision which he had given in Samoa, for Mr Hunt?s action, was�only
an appeal from Peter to Peter, and he was incarcerated in the Lovnka
Gaol.
Mr. Hunt then petitioned Sir A. H. Gordon, High Commissioner, for
-a pardon, on the grounds that the hanging of the murderer, Corcoran,
was not done by him, but was the act of the foreign residents of Samoa,
in the interests of law and order, and as a deterrent to a number of
bad characters who were then in Samoa. (See Appendix A).
Sir Arthur Gordon replied to Mr, Hunt?s solicitor, Mr. Trescott, that
he saw no reason to alter or amend the sentence, and in the face also
of a petition sent him by the foreign residents of Samoa, praying for
Mr. Hunt?s release ;to which petition he did not deign to reply. (See
Appendix B).
After Mr. Hunt had been imprisoned eight months, the papers on his
case having been brought before the Secretary of State, and having no
doubt been reviewed by the Crown Law Officers, the result was that
the Queen?s pardon was sent out io Mr. Hunt. (See Appendix, C
Queen?s Pardon; D?Letter of sympathy of Foreign Residents)/
Sir Arthur Gordon was in England at the time the Queen?s pardon
was issued, and in order to save himself from Mr. Hunt?s bringing an
action against him for false imprisonment, he obtained an indemnity


?clause in the Supplementary Order in Council, dated August, 1879
(Section 14) viz : indemnifying himself, Judge Gorrie, Captain
Murray, and Lieut. Burt, against any action which might be brought
against them by Mr. Hunt for false imprisonment, so that that gentle-
man was left without a chance of obtaining either justice or satisfac-
tion.
?The great question in the above case is this: if Mr. Hunt did not
conspire with the chairman, Pritchard, at the meeting, how could he
on being acquitted of conspiracy -with him, be convicted of conspiring
with persons unknown. We have asked hoxv ? but have not yet
been answered why it was so! !
The whole prosecution was, as subsequent events have shewn, a matter
of diplomacy, and was carried on because Mr. Hunt was a political
opponent of Sir Arthur Gordon, and had the entire confidence of the
Samoan Government.
Sir Arthur wished to have Samoa annexed to England, and Mr. Hunt
knew that this was an impossibility in the face of the conflicting
interests of the German and United States Governments, who were
opposed to the annexation of Samoa by England, together with the
indisposition of the Samoan Natives, who love independence and their
?own country, and distrust foreigners.
It will serve to shew the influence which Mr. Hunt had acquired in
Samoa, when we say that the Revolutionary Samoan Government of
1875-6-7-8-9 waited for six months during Mr. Hunt?s imprisonment, in
order to give him the position of Chief Secretary of the Samoan Govern-
ment, which position he has since enjoyed under the King of Samoa in
1880. His influence with the King, however, found no favor in the eyes
of the resident Bifltish, American, and German Consuls, all of whom were
working for the influence which Mr. Hunt possessed, each being solici-
tous for the prominence of his own Government, and especially the
British Consul, in his desire for annexation, and together with the
German and American Consuls, in their desire to make the King a
mere puppet in their hands, projects which Mr. Hunt was understood
to resolutely oppose.
On the receipt of the Queen?s Pardon, Mr. Hunt returned to Samoa
in 1879, and after remaining there in business as an English merchant
until May, 1880, he was appointed by His Majesty Malietoa Talavou,
King of Samoa, Chief Secretary and Minister of Lands, which appoint-
ment he held on the arrival of Sir A. Gordon in August, 1880. Previous
to this, however, on the 21st June, 1880, Mr. Hunt had in self-
defence, renounced allegiance to England, and had become a Samoan
citizen, which naturalization had been recognized by the Consuls. The
Consuls out of spite towards Mr. Hunt, enforced against him the
municipal laws of Apia, whereby it is forbidden to supply wine or
spirits to a Samoan. But, notwithstanding this naturalization, the
?German, United States, and British Consuls on the arrival of Sir


Arthur Gordon, swore that the presence of Mr. Hunt was dangerous
to the peace and good order of Samoa.
Sir Arthur repudiated Mr. Hunt?s naturalization by the King of
Samoa, and in furtherance of his own desire to ruin Mr. Hunt, and in
defiance of a letter, shewn by Mr. Hunt to Sir A. Gordon, from His
Majesty stating that Mr. Hunt was not dangerous to the peace and
good order of Samoa, (See Appendix E.), and a personal conversa-
tion, in which the King informed Sir Arthur that England had nothing
to do with Mr. Hunt, as he was a citizen of Samoa, and an adopted
son of His Majesty, he issued an order of prohibition on the 28th
August, 1880 against Mr. Hunt, prohibiting him from being in
Samoa for two years. Now, all this had been done under cover of the
Western Pacific Order in Council, against a man who was legally an
alien in terms of the ? British Naturalization Act ? of 1870, and a
citizen of Samoa, a friendly State under treaty relations with England.
Without hearing Mr. Hunt in his defence, or citing him to make such,
on no definite charge, but on the simple affidavits (unsupported by
facts) of the German, American, and British Consuls, and ex-
ministers of the late King of Samoa, all being political opponents
of Mr. Hunt, he was prohibited from residing there for two years.
(See Appendix F., Prohibition Order).
In September, 1880, Mr. Hunt left Samoa for Fiji, with the
permission of his sovereign, Malietoa, to test the legality of Sir Arthur
Gordon?s acts in issuing an order of prohibition against him, he being
a citizen of Samoa, and to establish his naturalization, and arrived
that month in Fiji.
In October, 1880, Mr. Hunt entered an action for �2,000 against
Sir Arthur Gordon in the Supreme Court of Fiji, for loss and damage
sustained by him through the illegal acts of the High Commissioner,
in issuing an order of prohibition against him, and threatening him
with men-of-war to remove him from Samoa. The case came on for
trial on the 21st October, 1880, before Judge Gorrie, in the Supreme
Court of Fiji, the late Attorney General, Mr. Garrick, and Mr. Winter,
appearing for Mr. Hunt, and Mr. Soloman, Attorney General for Fiji,
appearing for Sir Arthur Gordon, High Commissioner.
The Judge declined to hear evidence, or allow the case to be opened
up, until he decided whether Sir Arthur Gordon acted as a judicial
officer, the real reason being that he feared the naturalization ques-
tion of Mr, Hunt, Sir Arthur Gordon having recognised King Malietoa
I. as an independent sovereign, and that England, America, and
Germany, had recognised Samoa as a Foreign State.
To shew the truth of this, it may be well to quote the words of the
Judge, who, taking exception to the argument of Mr. Soloman, that
Sir Arthur was higher than a judicial officer, said, ?? Mr. Soloman
? do you contend that the Act was a judicial one, and that being a
? judicial one performed under lawful authority, even though he (the


defendant) had made the gross mistake of not taking evidence, he
u was not liable for an error committed in a judicial capacity.?
Mr. Soloman still contended, when Judge Gorrie said, ? You are
throwing away your best line of defence, although I am putting it
? into your mouth.?
His Honor further directed attention to the case of Kemp
Nevil, reported in Proouis? u Constitutional Law, and explained that
the case, being in his knowledge, he could not exclude it from his
judgment, and would therefore give judgment at 10 o?clock on the
following morning as to whether the defence was a sufficient answer to
the action, as, if so, there was no case. Next day Judge Gorrie gave his
decision, thus depriving Mr. Hunt of his right to test his naturaliza-
tion, and mulcted him in heavy costs, and further to shew the animus
of the Judge, in order to insult Mr. Hunt, he made Mr, Winter, as
solicitor, responsible for the costs.
Where, in the history of the world, except before such a tyrannical
judge as Judge Jeffreys, have we heard of a Judge deciding a case on
a judical point, without allowing the plaintiff to produce witnesses,
suggesting pleas himself, and deciding on the very points therein
raised. > ... ,
Yet this is but one of the many cases of injustice that have been
done by Judge Gorrie and Sir Arthur Gordon, as Commissioner s
under the Western Pacific Order in Council, none of which would be
tolerated anywhere save in a Crown Colony, where there is no appeal
against oppression in any form, and where even the Members of the
Legislative Council are but the nominees of the Governor.
The whole machinery of the High Commissioner?s Court has been
set in motion in order to obtain convictions, with the view of shewing
that British subjects living in the Western Pacific Islands are a law-
less body of men.
But with all this machinery, backed up, as we have said before, with
British Men-of-War, the High Commissioner, or his Deputies, have
not been able to obtain more than six convictions from 1878 to 1883,
the principal cases being: Mr W. J. Hunt for a conspiracy to murder
in Samoa in 1877 ; for which he afterwards received the Queen?s pardon.
Captain Waite of the schooner ? Marion Benny? for instructing his
boat-steerer (Sam), when recruiting for natives, to fire over the heads
of the natives, to shew them that he was armed, had a charge preferred
against him that he ? did feloniously incite, procure and command one
Sam, a Polynesian native, to shoot with intent to do grievous hodily
harm to a certain person unknown ! ! !!
On this charge, with no proof that any person had been wounded,
but on the evidence of the native, Sam, and others, Captain Waite
was convicted, fined �25 and imprisoned for nine months.
Captain Daly was convicted for attempting to detain a native on
board the ? Heatherbell,? br as it was put, for attempting to kidnap


him, when in fact the native was never attempted to be kidnapped, as
?? tiav � told Jud � e Grorrie, had he been brought before the
High Commissioner s Court to give evidence, and which he denies now
Capt. Daly was fined �l5O, and imprisoned for six months.
. Captain Kilgour was convicted of making war on the natives, when
in fact he only fired in self defence, in his desire to recover the boat
belonging to the ?Mystery?, which boat had been taken by the natives
on the previous trip after they had murdered the mate, labor agent
and others, and was fined �IOO.
All of the above cases would not stand the test of a British -jury or
an appeal to an impartial judge.
This is a of the order and its working from its judicial side,
and in that there is nothing to recommend it save unqualified audacity
and high-handed despotism.
NEW ZEALAND TRADE, HOW IT HAS BEEN JEOPARDIZED
ABSXJRD anb arbitrary REGULATIONS
ISSUED BY SIR ARTHUR H. GORDON AS HIGH COM-
MISSIONER FOR THE WESTERN PACIFIC
Let trade and commerce fade and die,
But give us back our old nobility.?Gordon.
On the other hand, considered apart from its position as an arbiter
of justice, the effect of the Western Pacific Order in Council has
led to such unfortunate results to the commercial interests of the
Australian and New Zealand Colonies, throughout the Pacific, that
we being intimately connected with the commercial interest of New
Zealand, in the Pacific, feel it to be a duty we owe to our fellow
Colonists to give, in brief, what we have gleaned in our travels, from
authorities not to be disputed, how far our New Zealand commercial
interests have been interfered with and jeopardized. The extending
of England?s commerce is the one great aim of England?s Ministry on
this point there is, we take it for granted, no dispute.
In order to pash forward her commerce, her sons have had to force
their way as pioneers among savage and semi-savage races. Until the
establishing of the High Commissioner?s office?we speak as English-
men?pressed on commerce paving the way for missionary enterprise;


extending England?s rule, by rough means, perhaps, but rough work
had to be done, and men were needed to do it, and men stepped for-
ward, holding their lives in their hands, zealous and fearless in their
acts, gained Fiji for England, and were extending her sway and
influence daily, but the gentlemen of Exeter Hall and the Aborigines?
Protection Society, who know nothing about the South Seas and the
dangers and difficulties encountered by those living there, who are
extending England?s trade, thought that their younger sons were too
hard on the noble savage, hence the Order in Council alluded to?
Powers were given under this Order in Council, without the knowledge
and consent of England?s people, as represented by the House of Com-
mons, to an appointee of the Crown, viz., Sir A. H. Gordon, High
Commissioner, powers of a nature and character utterly abhorrent
to Englishmen?s ideas and these powers are supported by England?s
ships of war. These powers have been used absolutely against Eng-
land?s sons, not for their protection ; they have been hounded and
hunted, imprisoned, and fined, for trying to defend their lives and
property, while the noble savage has, without exception, been allowed
to slaughter and plunder England?s pioneers, and has been patted on
the back by the decision of the Judicial Commissioner, Sir John
Gorrie, to this effect, ? Good boy, I can?t flog you, you?re only a child.??
Take the case of the murder of the boat?s crew of the ?Mystery, ?
in the New Hebrides. When Aratuga, one of the murderers, was
brought before Judge Gorrie, that judge said he had no jurisdiction,
that the man was but acting as a soldier under the command of his
chief : ? I can, therefore, find no grounds, for jurisdiction against this
? man, in his individual capacity, or to hold him responsible for any
? offence against ? British Law ?. ?Fiji Times , April 14th 1880.
When Captain Kilgour recovered the ? Mystery?s ? boat from these
murderers, he was charged with ? making war against the natives,?
although he merely fired in self-defence, but Judge Gorrie fined him
�IOO.
In connection with this prelude, we now draw particularly your at-
tention to New Zealand and its commercial interests in the Pacific.
New Zealand, by position, should command the trade of Tonga and
Samoa and other groups, and did command this trade until the High
Commissioner stepped in. On the appointment of the first Deputy
Commissioner to Samoa, there were five vessels trading from New
Zealand, to these Islands, ? now there is bid one.? The first action
High Commissioner, was to stop by regulation, employment
of British vessels in the labor trade for Samoa, resulting, from the
the decision of the Deputy Commissioner, in the Mary Anderson
case, a decision endorsed by the assessors, and one that did justice to
all concerned, but one, that, in an indirect way, the High Commissioner
condemned, by prohibiting any British Vessel to be employed in the
labor trade for Samoa, thereby causing a serious loss to British


planters in Samoa and also to the owners of tlie schooner ? Gael,?*
"who had entered into a contract for the season, to get labor for the
firm of Godeffroy & Son, and debarring colonial shipping from com-
peting with vessels under other flags in this trade. Furthermore, the
High Commissioner has prohibited British subjects from selling fire-
arms of any description or ammunition, which includes powder, shot
and guns for pigeon-shooting, under a heavy penalty, vide regulation,
No 5, 31st December, 1879, while at the same time he, when Governor
of Fiji, did and the present Governor of Fiji now does, pay off the
time-expired Polynesian labourers with muskets, powder, and ball,
with which to shoot down the crews of labor vessels in the New
Hebrides and Solomon Islands. Meantime, traders of other nations
can sell shot guns and rifles, with the needful ammunition, at their
will.
It will probably be thought that much good had been done by
these regulations. There was, perhaps, an opportunity of doing good
had the co-operation of Germany, America and France rendered prac-
ticable the extension of similar prohibitions to their respective citizens ;
but, by the action of Sir Arthur, the trade has been forced into the
hands of foreigners, who now hold it, but not in a more worthy way
than did their English predecessors. Sir Arthur Gordon, High Com-
missioner, laid down as his dictum, in his memoranda of February 26,
1881, in reference to massacres of British subjects in the Western
Pacific : ?? That there appears to be nearly as much misapprehension
? as to the degree of protection which British subjects are entitled to
? anticipate in savage regions, as with regard to the functions of the
? High Commissioner. Strictly, none but those who are employed on
? public duty are entitled to protection. The doctrine that wherever
? a trader thrusts his way he is to be followed by a man-of-war for his
?*? protection, and if he loses his life in pursuit of his enterprise (i.e.,
British trade), the naval force of the country is to be employed to
? avenge his death on the countrymen of those who have killed him,
? is an altogether a novel one.?
Now, if the foregoing doctrine is a novel one, why are not British
traders allowed to protect their own lives, irrespective of the High
Commissioner, seeing that he will not grant them any protection.
The effect of the High Commissioner?s policy has been that our
people are murdered, our labour and other vessels are plundered, our
trade destroyed, and all this has been permitted unavenged , with the
of the exaction of a few pigs, and the destruction of a few
cocoanut trees by British men-of-war, for white men?s blood, and all
to gratify the High Commissioner?s notions of what should be.
Now we ask if this is a sufficient atonement for the blood of
England?s sons in the Pacific.
The High Commissioner?s policy has created among the Natives
auch contempt for England and England?s sons, that the noble and


unsophisticated savage does not scrnple to gratify his natural thirst
ior bloodshed and violence, well knowing that if ever he is brought to
account for it, he can get out of the difficulty by the payment of a
few pigs and yams, or the destruction of a few huts and cocoanut
trees. In what other light can this be regarded, but as a wholesale
hecatomb of human victims offered up on the altar of those pests of
colonization, the Aborigines? Protection Society, and Exeter Hall.
The blood of Englishmen has flowed like water in the Western
Pacific Islands, and calls loudly for vengeance at the hands of the
British Government. Even the personal liberty of a British subject
is not safe, for where the High Commissioner or his Deputy has
? reasonable ground to believe ? that any British subject is likely to
commit an infraction of High Commission Regulations, he can be
deported to Fiji, and against this decision there ?is no appeal
Thus, without jury or hearing, on the simple dictum of one man, his
fellow-man can be ruined, and there ?is no appeal.? How now will
this be viewed by the general public ? How will this affect the inte-
rests of commercial men in New Zealand P Who would stake capital
against a commercial rival in a contest for supremacy, his opponent
being a favorite of the High Commissioner, he himself being an out-
sider ? Who would venture on a speculation in the Islands while
known as a political opponent of the High Commissioner, and contest
the question with a known supporter of the High Commissioner. Why
the thing is absurd. So long as Sir A. H. Gordon holds the position
and power of High Commissioner under the Order in Council, so long
will he use his influence as High Commissioner for political purposes,
so long will he hold the Pacific Islands commerce of New Zealand in
his hands, and he will use that power ruthlessly, as he has already
done. He has caused our trade with the South Seas to dwindle to
zero, and men of other nations are reaping the advantage. Sir
Arthur Gordon had an idea that he could annex Tonga and Samoa to
flhji, as appendages of this wonderfully-governed colony ; but Samoan
chiefs have been there, Tongan chiefs have been there, and they have
distinctly asserted, ? Death before Slavery ; deal with the Fijian as
you please, but voluntarily we will not come under the High Commis-
sioner.? Not that this is a dissent to connection with a free Government
?not that this means dislike of our race?by no means. They can,
when the Upas tree of High Commissioner is removed, be brought into
the most intimate connection with our Colonies, more especially New
Zealand, with which Colony they have, until lately, held the most
constant and regular intercourse.
The fostering of British enterprise and trade in the Pacific was a
simple thing, and easy to be done, and this is how the High Commis-
sioner has managed it. It was hardly considered possible that British
traders would be displaced in this trade, but we knew not the versa-
tile powers of His Excellency Sir'A. H. Gordon, High Commissioner.


Let us hope that the day is fast approaching, when the place that has
known the High Commissioner?s mis-rule so well, shall know it, and him
no more for ever, but of this we may at least be sure, that the pernicious
influence he has exerted in the Western Pacific will be felt even when
the hundreds of his pioneer countrymen who have suffered at his hands,
do not remain to curse him. All this lies at the door of the Western
Pacific Order in Council and its framers. Who they were we cannot
say at present. The ?Power behind the Throne,? may remain un-
discovered, the power that moved Her Majesty?s Ministers may remain
unpunished, but nothing, save just censure, can fall on the heads of a
British Ministry who gave their blind consent to a course of despotism
which has led England into disfavor with her own sons, and has shed
the withering breath of tyranny over the patriotism of Englishmen in
the Western Pacific.
It may be known only to a few in the Australasian Colonies, besides
those immediately connected with the South Sea Islands trade, that a
very large amount of colonial capital is employed in the carrying on of
the trading ventures ashore and afloat, and this being the case, we
consider it most unjust that a British High Commissioner should have
it in his power to mar all these or any individual interests.
We would particularly draw the attention of our readers to the fact
that there is scarcely any English capital in the South Sea trade; then
why should colonial interest be interfered with and jeopardized by an
Order in Council from England, in which the various Colonial Govern-
ments have not even been consulted.
We now appeal to all right-thinking men, commercially and otherwise,
to urge on our Ministers, through our representatives, to communicate
with the various Australian Governments for an immediate intercolonial
conference to be held on this subject, in order that there may be a
repeal of the Western Pacific Order in Council, so that properly con-
stituted Courts (according to the British Constitution), may be estab-
lished, or that stringent measures shall be taken, to mitigate the abuses
of the Order.
We have lately observed that Sir Arthur Gordon has managed to
get himself appointed, along with Comodore Wilson and Sir Samuel
Wilson, on the Western Pacific Commission, which is, no doubt, for the
purpose of baulking enquiry into his many illegal acts in the Western
Pacific, and to color the report of the Commission in such a way as to
paint himself a heaven-born diplomatist and High Commissioner. As to
the utility of the Western Pacific Commission sitting in London at a
distance of over 15,000 miles from the Western Pacific Islands, where
it is impossible for the people living in those islands to attend (on ac-
count of the expense), shews the absurdity of having such a Commission
all.
Sir Arthur, no doubt, suggested that this Commission should be held
in London, as he was too astute to have it in the Western Pacific, where


the people he has inj ured, and others, could expose his miserable, narrow-
minded, despotic policy, and further, that his philo-nigger proclivities
and color-blindness are not of such a character, as he wishes Exeter Hall
and the Aborigines? Protectional Society, and the people of England
generally to believe, but that he and his policy are a sham of shams.
THE HOUNDING AND HUNTING OF MR. W. J. HUNT
BY SIR ARTHUR GORDON, HIGH COMMISSIONER.
? To have a giant?s strength and to use it as a giant, were cowardly.?
After Judge Goi?rie had dismissed Mr. Hunt s action against Sir Arthur
Gordon for illegally issuing an order of prohibition against him already
mentioned, Mr. Hunt left Fiji in November, 1880 for Auckland, to
transact certain business for the late King of Samoa, Malietoa Talavou,
and returned to Levuka, en route for Samoa, and owing to the want of
communication, he was detained for some time.
In January, 1881, H.M.S. Cormorant, (Captain Bruce), arrived from
Sydney, on her voyage to Samoa, and to the astonishment of Mr. Hunt
and every person in Levuka, her mission was to arrest Mr. Hunt if he
had been at Samoa, and have deported him'out of the country.
Captain Bruce returned to Sydney, feeling as he said, disgusted at
having gone over 2,000 miles on a wild-goose chase after Mr. Hunt.
The facts are these : Sir Arthur Gordon, High Commissioner, was
under the impression that Mr. Hunt had returned to Samoa in the b.s,
Clyde, which vessel he was in treaty for the purchase of, for the King
of Samoa. Sir Arthur, in order to further carry out his high-handed
proceedings against Mr. Hunt, immediately applied to Commodore
Wilson, at Sydney, for a war-vessel to proceed to Samoa (to arrest Mr.
Hunt),"but his application was refused by the Commodore. Sir Arthur
then applied to the Home authorities, and his request was and
the Commodore was instructed to place a ship at his disposal. The fiasco
of sending a man-of-war nearly three thousand miles to arrest a man
who was not a British subject, but a citizen of Samoa, is in keeping with
the other persecutions which Mr. Hunt has experienced at the hands
of Sir Arthur. Mr. Hunt wrote to Sir Arthur, protesting against men-
of-war being sent after him, as he was a naturalized Samoan. On the
21st of February, Mr. Hunt took passage in the ketch Patience, bound


for Samoa via Wallace Island, which island is distant about two hun-
dred and eighty miles from Samoa, on the autherities at Levuka hearing
that Mr. Hunt had taken his passage, the Inspector of Police, Mr.
Fowler, went to Stammerjohn, master of the ketch, and cautioned him
against taking Mr. Hunt as a passenger. Captain Stammerjohn
immediately saw Mr. Hunt and informed him that he had been cau-
tioned against taking him to Samoa, Mr. Hunt declined to be intimi-
dated, and requested Captain Stammerjohn to inform Mr, Fowler that
if the authorities had anything against him, they had better produce
their warrant and remove him from the vessel. Captain Stammerjohn
then waited on the Inspector of Police, and informed him of what Mr.
Hunt had stated. When Mr. Fowler found out that Mr. Hunt could not
be intimidated, the authorities instructed the Collector of Customs at
Loma Loma, the last port at which the vessel was to touch in the Fijian
Group, that the vessel was not to be cleared out at the Customs, or any
vessel with Mr. Hunt on board. When this was intimated to the captain,
he informed Mr. Hunt, who again declined to be intimidated, and
refused to leave the vessel, saying that the detention of the vessel was a
matter between the Captain and the Fijian authorities. Next day, the
22nd February, Mr. Waring, from Levuka, arrived, bringing fresh in-
structions in re Mr, Hunt, When he found that Mr. Hunt would not
leave the vessel, he agreed to clear the vessel out the next day, which
he did, but before doing so he frightened the Captain so, that he
marooned Mr. Hunt on Wallis Island for nearly one month, until his
return from Samoa, when Mr. Hunt was compelled to return to Fiji, at
which place he arrived in March, 1881.
From March until August, Mr. Hunt was compelled to remain in
Fiji, owing to the action of the authorities cautioning the various ship-
ping agents not to grant him a passage to Samoa.
In the month of August, Mr. Hunt induced a friend to grant him a
passage in a steamer which cleared for Guam, which steamer called at
Saanoa, and landed him. When the British Consul and Deputy Com-
missioner (Mr. Graves) found out that Mr. Hunt had returned, he im-
mediately had him arrested and imprisoned, which was on the night of
the 6th September, on a warrant dated 3rd March, 1881, issued at Wel-
lington by the High Commissioner. Mr. Hunt was next day brought
before the High Commissioner?s Court, charged with disobeying the
order of prohibition issued against him by the High Commissioner on
the 28th August, 1880, Mr. Hunt objected to the jurisdiction of the
Court, on the grounds (1) that he was a naturalized Samoan, having
been naturalized on the 21st June, 1880, two months before the order
was made against him, and that the High Commissioner was well aware
of such naturalization, as the King of Samoa had informed the High
Commissioner; (2) that by the British Naturalization Act of 1870, he
had a perfect right to throw off his allegiance to the Queen, and become
a citizen of a Foreign State, Samoa being in treaty relations with England,


Germany, and the United States, (fee. The Deputy Commissioner oyer*
ruled Mr. Hunt?s objections, refusing to allow him to call witnesses?
members of the Samoan Government and others, to prove his naturaliza-
tion?and sentenced Mr. Hunt to three months imprisonment, or until
such time as he could be removed to Fiji, not exceeding three months.
Mr. Hunt then appealed to the Supreme Court of Fiji (the Appeal Court
from the High Commissioner?s Court against the decisions of the Deputy
Commissioner) and applied to be allowed bail, but this was refused, and
he was incarcerated in gaol for nineteen days (being allowed only six
biscuits a day for the first two days, and one meal afterwards, until
he was placed a prisoner on board the schooner ? Fetu Dele, bound to
Fiji. On the arrival of the vessel at Levuka, the master, Carmichael,
sent on shore to the authorities to know what he was to do with Mr.
Hunt, and at 9 o?clock the Inspector of Police came on board, and
informed the master there was nothing against Mr. Hunt, and that the
High Commissioner only wanted him removed from Samoa, and that he
was to be released. The appeal case, Hunt v. Graves, Deputy Commis-
sioner for Samoa, came on for hearing before Judge Gorrie in October,
1881, Mr. Hunt, by his counsel, Mr. Hobday, contended that Mr. Hunk
was a naturalized citizen of Samoa, in terms of the British Naturaliza-
tion Act of 1870, Samoa being recognized as a State by Englaud, Ger-
many, and the United States, and, consequently, the High Commissioner
had no jurisdiction over him, (fee. After hearing the arguments of the
Attorney-General (Mr Solomon) for the Deputy Commissioner, and Mr.
Hobday, for Mr. Hunt, Judge Gorrie said that he would reserve judg-
ment, but instead of giving judgment next day (as he did in Mr. Hunt?s
action against Sir A. Gordon in October, 1880) he kept Mr. Hunt wait-
ing from October until January, 1881, nearly five months, before he
gave judgment.
The Chief Justice gave judgment on the 21st January, 1882, in the
appeal case Hunt v. Graves, Deputy-Commissioner at Samoa, and dis-
allowed Mr. Hunt?s claim to be a naturalized citizen of Samoa, as he said
there was no law to naturalize in Samoa, although Mr. Hobday, solicitor,
handed to him the Koyal Gazette of Samoa, which contained the notifica-
tion of a number of laws, amongst which was the Naturalization Act.
After the judgment in the appeal case, Hunt v. Graves, H.B.M. Deputy
Commissioner for Samoa, was heard in January, Mr Hunt left Fiji for
Wellington, New Zealand, to bring his action in the Supreme Court
there.
In March, 1882, Mr Hunt commenced an action in the Supreme Court
at Wellington against Sir A. H. Gordon, for �BOOO damages for loss
sustained by reason of his being prohibited from living in Samoa, thereby
depriving him of his position as Chief Secretary and Minister of Lands
to the King of Samoa, wrongfully deporting him as a naturalized citizen
of Samoa, for false imprisonment, and general bad treatment.
When Sir Arthur received notice from Mr. Hunt?s solicitors, Messrs.


Brandon, Shaw, & Brandon, that they had been instructed to issue a writ
and asking him to name his solicitors who would accept service of the
same, Sir Arthur replied asking to be supplied with a statement of Mr.
Hunt?s losses, and he would submit them to the Secretary of State for
the colonies; but Mr Hunt?s solicitors replied that as a naturalized
Samoan, Mr Hunt had nothing to do with the Secretary of State.
This was merely a ruse, as subsequent events have shewn, to delay the
case until Sir Arthur could get out of the country, in all probability
thinking that Mr Hunt would not have funds to follow him to England.
Sir Axthurs next move was to apply, through his solicitors, Messrs.
Izard & Bell, to the Supreme Court for two months to plead, on the
grounds that he required information from Fiji to shew that Mr Hunt?s
action, in October, 1880, for �2OOO damages, was similar to his present
action, although he knew full well that, at the time that case was tried,
Mr Hunt had not been arrested, imprisoned, and finally, deported from
Samoa.
In May, 1882, Sir Arthur?s solicitors pleaded, and gave almost a
general denial to Mr Hunt?s declaration.
In order to shew how anxious Sir Arthur was to gain time, with the
hope, as we have already stated, to tire out Mr Hunt, on account of the
expenses, and also to avoid a personal appearance in the witness box,
Sir Arthur left Wellington in June, 1882, for Levuka, and never re?
turned to the colony ; but some time in September his solicitors applied
for a Commission to be sent to England to take the evidence of Mr
Graves (although he was in Samoa at the time, as British Consul), one of
the persons who swore the information against Mr Hunt, that he believed
that he (Mr Hunt), was dangerous to Samoa.
In October, 1882, c>ir Arthur?s solicitors applied for a Commission to
take the evidence of Sir Arthur Gordon in London.* The above Com-
missions were dated September and October respectively, and there
would have been ample time to have had them returned, so that the
action could have been tried in January, 1883 ; but more time was ap-
parently wanted by Sir Arthur, for, in December, 1882, another Com-
mission was applied for to take evidence in Samoa, and the Commission
was made returnable on the 15th April, 1883, thus putting off the case
for months and months, or in other words, Mr Hunt had to wait
?eighteen months before this action could be tried, and this, through the
desire which we have already stated.
Why were not all these Commissions applied for at once 1 Why also
was Sir Arthur allowed to leave the colony, where he could have been
personally examined in the presence cf the jury 1 ? M?Ey, because he
wished to avoid any such occurrence, as he could not possibly justify his
action against Mr. Hunt in any Court in the world.
During the time that the case was hung up, Mr. Hunt applied to Sir
Arthur, through his solicitors, to suspend the order of prohibition, pend-
ing its expiration of three months, and also made a later application him-


self in June, 1882, but merely received one of Sir Arthur?s evasive
answers that he would communicate with the Foreign Consuls at Samoa
to see if he was still dangerous to that country, and send him a reply,
which he never made, and which he never intended to make.
Fancy a man in Sir Arthur Gordon?s position, as a High Officer of the
Crown descending to such despicable meanness, as to break his promise,
and further prevent Mr. Hunt from returning to Samoa, when in any
.case the order of prohibition had only three months to run, but
perhaps he thought that, at the end of that time, he could get some
other myrmidons of his, to swear that Mr. Hunt was still dangerous to
the peace and good order of Samoa, in order to further his political
views Mr. Hunt arrived at Samoa in February, 1883, to attend the
commission, but what was the result of his visit, why he was met face
to face, by Consul General Gordon?s Acting British Consul, Mr Church-
ward who was Commissioner to take evidence, and who informed Mr
Hunt that he had received a letter from Sir Arthur telling him that a
Commission would be sent to Samoa, and he was to do the best for him,
and that he intended to do so. Mr. Churchward kept his promise, for
we never saw a more one-sided Commissionin ourhves, Mr. Churchward
refused to send summonses or requests for Mr. Hunt?s witnesses to at-
tend the Commission, and also admitted that he had told them that they
need not come unless they liked. .
In spite of the opposition of both the British Consul (Churchward),
Consul General for Germany (Zembsch), and other hangers on, Mr Hunt
established beyond question that the naturalization and other laws
had been passed by both He uses of Parliament, and that such laws had
been promulgated, and the Royal Gazette of August 5, 1880 was signed by
the present King (Malietoa Laupepa), who was vice-King at the time,
although he the King, denied such laws before the Commission; but
as we are aware, he had been intimidated by the Foreign Consuls into
making such denial. The very fact that the King imprisoned Mr.
Hunt?s witnesses, was on account of such intimidation.
The German Consul and Ex-Ministers of the King of Samoa were
unable to prove that Mr Hunt was dangerous to the peace and good
order of Samoa, but said that they only believed that he was dangerous,
but that they had no proof. It was on evidence of this class that Sir
Arthur issued the order of prohibition against Mr. Hunt. Evidence, no
doubt, to his satisfaction, but not what would be accepted ase vidence in
any British Court. , ...
One can hardly realise such a state of things as the above, in these en-
lightened days. Mr Hunt was virtually fighting the Governments ot
England and Germany (through their Consuls) in his attempt to prove
bis�naturalisation by the late King of Saoma, Malietoa Talavou 1., but
be succeeded, despite their tremendous opposition.


THE ACTION OF HUNT v. GORDON.
Speak, 0 ye judges of the earth,
f just jour sentence be ;
Or must not innocence appeal
To heaven from your decree?soth Psalm.
The cause celebre, Hunt v. Gordon, was heard on the 16th July,
1883, and continued until the 20th, with the result of Mr Hunt?s obtaining
�lOO damages for virtually nineteen days? imprisonment in Samoa, and
six days? imprisonment on board the schooner Fit* Lele, when he was
deported from Samoa to Fiji.
The following is an extract of the report of the judgment, from the
?New Zealand Times,? of the 21st July, and the rider attached to such,
judgment speaks volumes for itself: ?
SUPREME COURT.
CIVIL SITTINGS.
Friday , July 20.
(Before His Honor Mr. Justice Richmond.)
Hunt v. Gordon.
The Court resumed at 10 a.m.
His Honor said he had considered the arguments on joints of law
addressed to him by counsel on both sides since the previous day?s
adjournment. On the part of the defendant, he had been asked to with-
draw the case altogether from the jury, and although he was unable to
assent to that course, he felt bound to give him the benefit of the opinion
which he had formed in his favor on many points. As to the question
of naturalisation, in his opinion the term ? foreign state? in section 6 of
the Naturalisation Act, 1870, must be understood to mean a civilised
State. It would be out of place, and a matter of some difficulty, to give
an exact definition for the purpose; but it was enough to say that, in
his opinion, the nature of the case implies that the British citizen who
has to take advantage of the statutory provision, and to renounce his-
natural allegiance, shall come under some social and national restraint
equivalent to that from which he is freeing himself. There must be a
transfer of allegiance, and therefore seme sufficiently organised body-
politic capable of accepting the transfer?a body able to control its
individual members in their intercoux-se with citizens of other States.
Otherwise the Act would certainly he made use of as the means of escaping
the restraint , not only of British law, hut of civilised society. It was plain
on the terms of the Order in Council of 1877 that Samoa was not to be
regarded as a civilised State or power. He had been asked to decide on
the evidence, or to leave it to the jury to decide, whether Samoa was not de


facto civilized. He need not stop to inquire whether the evidence con
possibly justify such a conclusion. It was enough to say that the Crown
did not recognise Samoa as a civilised State ; but, on the contrary, treated
the Navigator Group as not within the jurisdiction of any civilised power.
The Crown represented the nation in its foreign relations, and their
municipal Courts must take their directions from the Crown. Saving the
Imperial Legislature, the Crown, through its recognised diplomatic organs,
was the highest authority upon the subject. The argumentfor the plaintiff,
grounded upon the so-called treaties, was, he held, effectually disposed of
by Mr Harper and Mr Bell. If it could be held that the British treaty
operated as a recognition of Samoa as a civilised power, the islanders
would be removed from the protection of the Acts of 1872 and 18/ 5, and
the jurisdiction of the High Commissioner in the Navigator Group
would be put an end to. The treaty was far from having any such pur-
pose, for it actually provided for the issue of regulations by the High
Commissioner, and for the obedience of the Samoans themselves to his
summons. Two entirely distinct matters were confounded in the argu-
ment by plaintiff?s counsel ?the recognition of Samoa as independent,
and as a civilised power. The statute of 1875, section 7, established a
plain distinction between the two things, for while the whole proceeded
on the assumption that the islands of the Pacific in general are not within
the jurisdiction of any civilised Power, the particular section expressly
provided that nothing in the Act shall derogate from the rights of the
inhabitants ; so that in the view of the Legislature the independence of
the islands was one thing and their status with regard to civilisation
another. Any doubt on this point was thoroughly set at rest by the
terms of Article 24 of the Order of 1877. The interpretation clause may
also be referred to as showing that the conventions contemplated by
article 24 are not in the strict sense to be called treaties, and by no
means import the recognition of these island Governments as fully con-
stituted States. He thus reached the conclusion that Samoa was not at
the time competent to grant naturalisation, not being a body politic to
accept a transfer of allegiance. Independent of this, there was in his
mind a strong doubt even of the existence in Samoa of anything e\ en
purporting to be a naturalisation law at the date of plaintiff?s supposed
naturalisation, and as to the authenticity of some of the documents pro-
duced. That point settled, it appeared that the High Commissioner had
power to make the order of prohibition against the plaintiff. From that
it further followed that the grounds upon which the order was made are
not examinable in any Court of Judicature. The circumstance that
the High Commissioner is required by article 24 to act upon evi-
dence given under oath, might not alone be sufficient to entitle him to
the full degree of immunity allowed to a Judge of Record, but the pre-
dominant character of defendant?s office was judicial, and it foimed part
of a complete code of procedure. The terms of subsection 3, article 24,
imply that the particular power was of a judicial character. The judicial


capacity in which the defendant was acting distinguished the case from
Mostyn v. Fabrigas, Musgrave v. Pulido, and others, in which the acts
of mere executive officers had been called into question, and brought it
within the range of such authorities as Cave v. Mountain, and Kemp v..
Neville. The question whether the plaintiff was dangerous to the peace-
and good order of Samoa has been adjudicated upon by the defendant.
No doubt it was a matter of opinion whether he was actuallv dangerous.
The defendant was the person duly authorised to determine the question,
and did determine it adversely to the plaintiff. That conclusion, whether
well or ill founded, could not be taken into question by them now. It
was, therefore, not competent for the plaintiff to question the sufficiency
of the evidence on which the High Commissioner proceeded, or to deny
that he himself was a dangerous person. There was an averment that
the Order of prohibition was made wrongfully, maliciously, and without
probable cause, but he might not have refused to amend the first count
in that particular, could it have been of any use to the plaintiff. It
was, however, plain that the defendant, having acted judiciously within
the scope of his jurisdiction, no action will lie against him for what he
has so done, though it should be laid /'also malitiose et scienter. As to
the particular objections?lst, that the term exceeded two years, the
Order-in-Council enabled the High Commissioner to prohibit the party
from being within specified limits for any period not exceeding two
years. He thought that it was no objection that the order from the
plaintiff gave a reasonable time to quit the specified limits. Next, as to
the objection that the Order was made and issued on a Sunday. The
answer was, that it was not of the nature of civil process, but concerned
the public peace and security. An arrest may be made on Sunday for
a breach of the peace, otherwise the Sabbath repose of the day itself
could not be secured. The very Order in Council provided for the
issue of warrants in cases of urgency. Though the order of prohibition did
not come within tbc letter of that rule, it was within the spirit of
it. As to the urgency, the High Commissioner could be judge of that.
He would not say that the order was exactly of the nature of a criminal
process, though the power to issue it was under the head of criminal
jurisdiction in the Order of Council. The person prohibited was not to
be regarded as an offender, but only as one who, on grounds of public
policy, is required to withdraw from a foreign territory. It was
part of the Hoyal prerogative to prevent a subject from leaving the king-
dom or to recall him from abroad, though it was at present disused. The
power given by Article 25 may be regarded as a modification of that
common law prerogative, and its exercise by an appointee of the Crown
partook of the nature of an act of state without ceasing to be a judicial
act. He thought that parol evidence could not be received to prove that
the order was not made on the day of its apparent date, the order being
on record. It was also doubtful whether the point was open to plaintiff.
The fact that the plaintiff was dangerous to the peace and good order-


of Samoa must be considered to be established for the purposes of the-
action. That left nothing but the third count, alleging false imprison-
ment under the order of the 3rd March, 1881, and the sixth count, which
appeared to refer to the same matter. It was conceded that in directing
personal removal to Levuka the order was erroneous. Then arose the
question whether that was not merely an erroneous exercise of the juris-
diction vested in the defendant, or a case in which a special and limited
authority, founded upon a statute, has not been duly pin sued, and in
which, therefore, the defendant had acted altogether without jurisdiction.
Without saying that the latter was the true view of the question, he
thought that he ought to leave to the jury the issues framed upon the
two counts. It was a further question upon the evidence whether Mr.
Hunt?s detention after leaving the gaol at Apia, and his deportation to
Levuka actually took place under the authority of that order. That he
should also leave to the jury.
Mr Harper addressed the jury for the defendant, and Mr Shaw for the
plaintiff. .
His Honor, in summing up, expressed regret that the jury should have
been kept there such a long time, away from their business engagements,
and that their time should have been taken up with a mass of matter
which had to be withdrawn from them. That, no doubt, would have a
tendency to confuse them as to what was really before them and what
Under such circumstances, juries were occasionally known to take the
bitin their teeth, and return a verdict as they liked upon all the points
that had been before them. They should guard themselves against this.
They must clearly understand the nature of the causes from which the
action had arisen. It was provided by Order in Council that the
Hi<di Commissioner of the Western Pacific should have powder to deport
any person to any portion of the Western Pacific, provided it was to a
place within the Western Pacific ; but it so happened that the portion
of the clause under which the defendant acted in deporting plaintiff did
not include Fiji, as it was a British Colony. Fiji was, geographically
speaking, within the Western Pacific, but it was not so for the purpose
sf the Order. The question in the first issue, whether the defendant
had made such an order, was admitted by the defendant. On the second
issue, ? Did defendant make such order wrongfully, maliciously, and
without proper cause F They might find that it was made wrongfully,
as the place named ivas Levuka. If it had been made maliciously, that
should, perhaps, have formed a separate cause of action. As to the cause
of making the order, that was contained in the Order itself, which set
forth that plaintiff was dangerous to the peace and good order of Samoa,
It was true that the defendant was not at Samoa at the time set forth,
but they all knew that he was attempting to get there, that he left
Auckland for the purpose, and afterwards did enter the prohibited dis-
trict. That knowledge was the probable cause of the issue of the order,
and, if that was so, indisposed of the issue as to malice, for if there was


cause for any act, it could not be one of malice. They must find that
the deportation of the plaintiff was wrongful, but not malicious. The
next point to consider was : Was the plaintiff on the 6th September
arrested at Samoa on defendant?s order] He read to the jury the evi-
dence of plaintiff on the subject of his arrival at Samoa. They would
find that Consul Graves was not the arresting person at all, but Inspec-
tor Scanlon, who acted upon the authority of the High Commissioner.
That also applied to the detention at Apia. The action of Graves was
quite a separate thing. An order of prohibition did not describe a man as
an offender, but, being issued, and the man against whom it was directed
remained, then he became an offender. Mr. Shaw had called evidence to
show that the warrant was irregular, as the information upon which it
was based should have been given upon oath. That was so, for it appeared
that the clerk who prepared it had struck out the word ? oath ? and
inserted ? reported to me.? They would bear it in mind that the order
of commitment only followed the previous warrant. It was not the
object of the authorities to subject the plaintiff to more imprisonment
than was necessary. He was, no doubt, in custody until the departure
of the German schooner which took him to Levuka, as he was put aboard
by Inspector Scanlon. All that, they would have to bear in mind, was
under the warrant of Graves, not Gordon; also that Hunt was under
arrest from the time he left Apia till he was liberated at Levuka. The
question was, then, what damages did plaintiff suffer by reason of the
third count ] Damages could not properly be given for expulsion from
Samoa, for during the period of two years he had no business to be there.
When he returned to Samoa, plaintiff said he did not know that the ex-
pulsion was legal. They would, however, bear in mind that ignorance of
law was no justification of any wrong act. With regard to issues 17, 18,
and 19, charging defendant with assault in September, 1881, they would
have to find for defendant if they found that plaintiff was arrested
under Graves? warrant.
The jury retired at 2.45 p.m. and after the expiration of three hours,
came into Court by direction of His Honor, when the foreman stated that
they had been unable to agree. On again retiring, they brought in a
verdict for plaintiff for �lOO, damages on the 14th issue, adding a rider
that the jury regretted that so many issues had been withdrawn from
them, under which they would have awarded more substantial damages to
plaintiff for the injuries he had sustained through the powers exercised
by defendant.


REVIEW OF JUDGMENT ON HUNT v. GORDON.
His Honor Mr. Justice Richmond, in the case Hunt v. Gordon said,
? he had considered the arguments on points of law addressed to him by
? counsel on both sides since the previous day?s adjournment. On the
? P art the defendant, he had been asked to withdraw the case altogether
? fr� m fhe jury, and, although he was unable to assent to that course,
? lie felt bound to give him (Sir A. Gordon), the benefit of opinion,
? which he had formed in his favor on many points.
? As to the question of naturalisation, in his opinion the term
? ? Foreign State? in section six of the Naturalization Act, 1870, must
?be understood to mean a civilized State. It would be out of place, and
a matter of some difficulty, to give an exact definition for the purpose,
? Jmf if was enough to say that, in his opinion, the nature of the case
? implies that the British citizen who has to take advantage of the
? statutory provisions, and to renounce his natural allegiance, shall come
? under some social and natural restraint, equivalent to that from which
? he is freeing himself, &c., &c.?
In reply to His Honor?s remarks, it may be well to shew how erroneous
are the ideas enunciated by him. The King and Government of Samoa
are recognized by treaties with England, Germany, and the United
States. Samoa has a constitution and laws, and the King exercises
sovereign powers.
The very fact of the United States Consul being instructed to hand
over a Chinaman (who had murdered a half-caste in 1882), to the Samoan
Government, and his trial (by a mixed jury of whites and Samoans),
sentence, and death, shews that the King holds the highest prerogative of
the Crown, viz. : life or death, and yet it is contended that Samoa is
not a civilized State.
Ihe Imperial Naturalization Act, of 1870, clause six, is as follows :
? Any British subject who has at any time before, or may at any time
after, the passing of this Act, when in ? any Foreign State,? and not under
disability, voluntarily become naturalized in such State, shall, from and
after the time of his so having become naturalized in such Foreign State,
be deemed to have ceased to be a British subject, and be regarded as an
alien.?
In the above-cited clause are the words ?any Foreign State,? and His
Honor Mr. Justice Richmond gives it as his opinion that the term Foreign
State must be understood to mean a civilized State, although the very
Act does not define what kind of a Foreign State, but distinctly says
? any ? Foreign State.
Now, the question is, What is a Foreign State? A Foreign State is a
State recognised under treaties with Foreign States.
3


But His Honor Mr Justice Richmond contends that the treaties by-
no means import the recognition of these Island Governments as fully-
constituted states, and from which contention we, with the greatest
respect for His Honor, must entirely differ, and would ask where is the
proof that Samoa is not recognised as a Foreign State.
We consider it is not within the power of any person to put his own
construction on the term Foreign State in the Imperial Naturalization
Act of 1870. The treaties made between Germany, England and United
States, shew that Samoa was recognized as a Foreign State, and there is
nothing in the treaties or convention which take from Samoa her
independence as a Foreign State. The very fact of the treaty between
England and Samoa having a clause inserted in it in reference to the
establishment of the High Commissioner?s Court, shews that in terms of
the preamble of the Western Pacific Order in Council of 1877, Samoa
was included in the words (re jurisdiction) ? the same not being within
? Her Majesty?s dominions, and not being within the jurisdiction of any
? civilized power,?? otherwise it would have been unnecessary to have
had such a clause inserted. The favors granted by Samoa to establish a
High Commissioner?s Court to try British subjects, and to summon
Samoans as witnesses, is not any more peculiar than similar treaties
made with China, Turkey, Japan, and Barbary ; but we respectfully
opine that no power or judge can or has disputed their being Foreign
States, or their right to admit any person into the body politic, which is
naturalization.
With reference to another opinion of Mr. Justice Richmond that a
Foreign State must be understood to mean a civilized State, we would
ask what is meant by a civilized State, could it be contended because
China, Turkey, and Japan are not civilized in the European acceptation
of the term, that they are not civilized as far as they themselves are con-
cerned, although not according to European ideas. As it is disputed
that Samoa is not a civilized State, it may be well to remark, that out
of a population of 45,000 Samoans, it would be impossible to find 200
adults that cannot read and write in their own language, and they are
thoroughly christianized, being Protestants, Wesleyans, and Roman
Catholics, and their mode of government is superior to any other
government, comparing their early history.
Now the question arises, how far England can be said to be a civilized
nation, for, to quote Sir E. Greasy on the ? English Constitution,? page
� 356, note at foot of page as follows : ?? Now, that 3,000,000 of our
? population, belonging to an ignorant, degraded, and miserable pauper
? dass, actually receive parish relief in the course of every year, and
? indicate the existence of a still larger class to which they belong, and
? which is but little, if at all, less ignorant, degraded, and miserable
? than themselves, it becomes high time for Christian Philanthropists to
? turn their attention to the elevation and improvement of the great
? masses of the people.


The ignorance in which those masses are left may he seen in some
of Mr. Clay?s valuable reports on the Preston House of Correction,
The appalling ignorance of criminals is a proof, if proof be needed, of
the total want of education of the whole class from which criminals
are supplied. Mr. Clay, says, ?With reference to 1631 male prisoners,
? it is a fact that 674 were unable to read in the slightest degree, 646
? were ignorant of the Saviour?s name, and unable to repeat a word of
? intellegible prayer, and 1,111 were unable to name the months of the
? year in their proper order, while 713 were well acquainted with the
? exciting villainies and adventures of Turpin and Jack Sheppard, and
? admired them as friends and favorers of the poor, inasmuch as if they
? did rob, they robbed the rich for the poor.?
In the face of the above facts, how far can England be called civilized,
and with Bret Harte, one can truly say, ? Is civilization a failure!? and
the answer comes back, ?It is,? and that European civilization is a
failure, and sham. In conclusion, with all due respect to His Honor,
Mr. Justice Richmond, we contend that Samoa is a Foreign State within
the meaning of the Imperial Naturalization Act, 1870, that her civiliza-
tion will compare favorably with other States. That she has power to
naturalize, and that Mr. Hunt?s naturalization will be found good in law,
and further, that the prohibition and deportation of him by Sir Arthur
Gordon, High Commissioner, was a gross assumption of power, and the
interference with the King of Samoa, as to who should be their Chief
Secretary and confidential adviser, was a scandalous abuse of power.

To His Excellency Sir Arthur Hamilton Gordon, K C.M.G., High
Commissioner qf Polynesia , Governor of the Colony of Fiji , (be., (be.
May it please Your Excellency?
The Petition of Walter James Hunt, late of Samoa in the Navi-
gator?s Island, Merchant, and now a prisoner in Her Majesty?s
Gaol at Levuka, in the Island of Ovalau, in the Colony of Fiji,
humbly sheweth:
1. That your Excellency?s Petitioner has, for some time, been resident
in the Navigator?s Islands, carrying on business there as a merchant and
trader.
2. That your Excellency?s Petitioner was sentenced, before the Judicial
Commissioner?s Court, bolden at Apia, in Samoa, on the 23rd day of
February, A.D. 1878, to twelve month?s imprisonment for having un-
lawfully conspired to kill and murder one Edward Charles Corcoran,
which said sentence has since been confirmed by His Lordship the Chief
Justice of the Supreme Court of the Colony of Fiji on appeal.


3. That your Excellency?s Petitioner would respectfully represent to
your Excellency that in consequence of a most diabolical murder having
taken place and perpetrated by the said Edward Charles Corcoran at
Samoa, aforesaid, wherein no law existed at that period, it was a
matter of almost absolute necessity for the protection of the community,
that it should be demonstrated to ruffianly characters that an effective
check would await their actions, and that the proceedings in respect to
the unfortunate man, Corcoran, was not the result of any wish to violate
the law, but arose from the simple fact that there was no laws by which
crime could be prevented or punished ; in fact that the dread penalty
exacted was not for punishment, but for a deterrent, and that, however,
unjustifiable under ordinary circumstances, its infliction was attended
with many palliating circumstances.
4. That your Excellency?s Petitioner would beg most respectfully to
point out to your Excellency that the meeting which was held at Samoa,
aforesaid, to take into consideration the enormity of the crime committed
by the said Edward Charles Corcoran, was called by the foreign residents
of that country, at which meeting your Excellency's Petitioner took a
minor share only.
5. That your Excellency?s Petitioner was charged, together with one
Cornwall and one Pritchard, who, it was proved at the trial at Samoa,
aforesaid, took a very active part and measure in the proceedings, he
(Pritchard) being nominated and accepting the position of chairman at
the meeting and by whom all resolutions were put. Yet your Petitioner
would beg most respectfully to point out that the said Pritchard and
Cornwall were discharged.
6. That the evidence adduced at the trial was that your Petitioner
had proposed one or two resolutions at the meeting, the effect of which
was not clearly proved at the trial, through your Petitioner being totally
ignorant of law, and not having any legal assistance afforded him (the
only qualified Barrister or Attorney being engaged for the prosecution),
and your petitioner being so ignorant as aforesaid, and without such legal
assistance, omitted to call evidence to disprove what the witnesses for the
prosecution had stated pending the trial, and His Lordship, the Chief
Justice observed during the hearing of the appeal that it was unfortu-
nate your Petitioner had not legal assistance at the trial at Samoa, and
your Petitioner would beg also to state that, owing to the short time
which elapsed from his committal for trial, and the trial taking place,
he had no opportunity of getting up his defence.
7. That your Excellency?s Petitioner would also most respectfully point
out that the majority of the witnesses for the prosecution attended the
public meeting, and were consequently accomplices, and that one witness,
a man named Farrell, was loudest in supporting the execution of Cor-
coran, and proposed that the vote should be taken by a show of hands,
and not by ballot, and even stated that ? If any man was ashamed to


hold up his hand he had better leave the meeting.? This man was the
principal evidence against your Petitioner.
8. That your petitioner begs most respectfully to submit to your Ex-
cellency that Corcoran called upon, and implored your petitioner to pro-
tect him from the fury of the populace, which your petitioner did for the
time being, it being out of the power of your petitioner to save his life, inas-
much as your petitioner had not the control of an infuriated mob, but
your petitioner, at the request of the said Corcoran, obtained the assist-
ance of a minister of religion, and attended him in his last moments in
the capacity of a friend and adviser.
9. That your Excellency?s petitioner would respectfully solicit your Ex-
cellency?s attention to the fact that the unfortunate man Corcoran had
been guilty of taking life, and that previously to his having done so, he
had loudly proclaimed his blood-thirsty intention.
10. That your Excellency?s petitioner begs further most respectfully to
represent that, through the unfortunate position in which he has been
placed, is entirely ruined in both his social and commercial prospects and
has already incurred heavy punishment both through the expense he has
undergone in being detained in Levuka, and prosecuting his appeal in the
Supreme Court of Fiji.
Your Excellency?s Petititioner therefore most humbly prays that in
the exercise of your Excellency?s prerogative, your Excellency may see
fit to order such mitigation of the penalty inflicted as to your Excellency
may seem meet. And your Excellency?s Petitioner will ever pray.
Dated at Her Majesty?s Gaol, Totago, Levuka, in the Island of Ooalau,
in the Colony of Fiji, this thirtieth day of May in the year of our Lord
one thousand eight hundred and seventy-eight.
W. J. HUNT, Petitioner.

Letter of Sympathy from Foreign Residents of Samoa.

by the European residents at Apia; Apia, Samoa, 14th August,
1879. W. J. Hunt, Esq., Apia.?Dear Sir, We, the undersigned
residents in Apia, feel it to be our duty to state the undermentioned
facts with relation to your trial and sentence in Her Britannic Majesty?s
High Commissioner?s Court at Apia, in February, 1878, upon a charge
laid against you by United States Consul Griffin for conspiracy, with
others, to murder Charles Corcoran, a citizen of the United States. The
act with which you were charged was the act of the foreign residents in
Apia, and was carried out under the firm coviction that it was
absolutely necessary for the protection of life and property against a
number of lawless and desperate persons, who, living in Apia, believed
themselves to be beyond the range of lawful authority competent to
punish crime, that the punishment for the crime of which Corcoran had
been found guilty by the United States Court should be rigidly enforced
by the public. We hereby place on record that the act for which you
suffered was one of public necessity, and, although stringent, had a most
beneficial effect uopn the interests of law and order, and we express our
sympathy with you in that the punishment for the act of the community
fell upon you alone. ?We remain dear sir, yours sincerely, Ad. V olkman,
merchant; Richard Hethrington, barrister and solicitor; and 26 other
principal foreign residents at Apia.???l hereby certify that those whose
signatures are attached to this document are men personally known to


me, and who describe their business and occupation correctly, and whose
respectability in their several positions no one can dispute. Robert
S. Swanston, Deputy-Gommissoner. ?Apia, Samoa, 20th August, 1879.
Appendix E.
King Malietoa to W. J. Himt, Esq.
g IEj Capital Mulinim, 27th August, 1880.
Ah I understand that a complaint has been made to the Hon. Sir
Arthur Gordon, High Commissioner, that you have been causing trouble,
and trying to bring aboxit war in my kingdom, in justice to you, I
must say that it is entirely untrue, and that, on the contrary, you have
endeavoured to bring about peace in this kingdom, and have used your
influence with the chiefs of Atua, Ana, &c., with that object. I have
further to say that you have always advised a peace policy, and that it
was on your advice that I requested Captain Bruce, of H.M.S Cormo-
rant, to proceed to Safotu and Atua, and that, during the time I was at
these places, that you did all the negotiations to bring about a peace. _
I may state that I am perfectly satisfied with the manner in which
you have performed the duties assigned to you in my Government, an I
that you have the entire confidence of myself and Government.
I am,
O Au Malietoa,
King of Samoa.
W. J. Hunt, Esq.,
Chief Secretary and Minister of Lands, Mulimui.
I hereby certify this letter was fully interpreted to His Majesty,
Malietoa.
Selu,
Interpreter for the Government of Samoa.
