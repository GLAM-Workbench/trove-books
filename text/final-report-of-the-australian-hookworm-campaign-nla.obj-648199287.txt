PART I.
I. AUSTRALIA AND ITS DEPENDENCIES.
1. Ares.
■The Commonwealth of Australia is made up of six States
and two Territories, hew South Vales, Victoria, Queensland,
South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania, with the
Northern Territory and the Federal Territory. The area of
the continent is estimated at 2,974,561 sauare miles, an
area just 807 square miles larger than the United States,
exclusive of Alaska.
The dependencies of Australia are British New
Guinea (Papua), former German New Guinea, and the islands
of Norfolk and Nauru. Papua and New Guinea are estimated
at approximately 90,000 square miles each, so the entire
area covered "by the Australian Hookworm Campaign, which did
no work in Norfolk and Nauru Islands, was just over 3,150,000
square miles.
The continent of Australia lies between latitudes
10° 41' S and 43° 39' S and between longitudes 113° 9' B and
153° 39' B. It is crossed by the Tropic of Capricorn and
has 1,149,320 square miles of its territory within the tropics,
approximately 38 percent of its area. The continent in
general has a narrow coastal belt bordered by mountains and
a flat interior. The greatest altitude is slightly over
7,300 feet. .
The dependencies of Papua and Hew Guinea are part of
the island of New Guinea, stated to be the largest island
in the world, which lies directly north of Queensland, The
island is entirely within the tropics. It has considerable
unexplored territory as the interior is mainly very rugged
and difficult of access.
2. Climate and Rainfall.
The climate of Australia varies with the physical
conformation, a moist, coastal belt and a dry interior.
The 70° isotherm passes across Australia at latitude 30°
south, while it crosses South America and South Africa at
latitude 33° south. The extreme range of temperature is
81 degrees. The dependencies of Papua and New Guinea, have
a typical tropical climate, moi3t and hot.


The rainfall of the continent of Australia also
conforms to the physical characteristics. It is almost
universally highest near the coast and shades off rapidly
towards the interior. The highest rainfalls are along ;
the coast of Queensland fron Cardwell to Port Douglas, wjrere
the average annual rainfall is fran 148 to 166 inches; (the
record is 204.62 inches during 1910 at Goondi in this belt.
Tho driest part of the continent is arcunc Lake in
South Australia, where the annual average is five inches and
10 inches per annum is exceeded. This area is below
sea .level. Only 190,489 square miles of the Commonwealth
have over 40 inches of annual rainfall, about six percent
of the total area. In the northern part of the continent
the rainfall is mainly during the summer months. This
distribution slowly changes to a winter distribution in
the southern States.
The dapendenoiea of Papua and New Guinea have high
annual rainfalls over most of the known territory, with
oertain exceptions. Along most of the coast of Papua
the average annual rainfall varies from ICO to 150 inohes.
5. Population.
The white population of the Commonwealth of Australia
by the 1921 census was 5,436,794. Estimates made during
1924 indioate that this has risen to just over six million,
not as yet equal to the population of Greater London.
The increase of population fran all sources between 1916 and
"1921 was approximately two percent. The 1911 oeneua showed
that 83 percent of the population were Australian torn; a
total of 97 percent of the population were born in Australia
and the United Kingdom; only 0.8 percent were of Asiatic
birth and only two percent were torn in European oountries
other than the United Kingdom.
Tho distribution of this population in regard to
urban and rural residence is of interest. /r cording to
the 1921 oensus, approximatefy 43 percent of the population
lived in the capital cities, an additional 19 percent lived
in provincial towns, and 38 percent only could he classed
as rural residents. In Hew South T’alos 43 percent of the
State's population lived in Sydney: in Queensland, 20 per
cent in Brisbane, 24 percent in provincial cities and towns
and 40 percent in rural areas.


The aborigines of Australia have never been
adequately censused and estimates vary widely. The
estimated number of full blooded aborigines in 1921 was
56,771. In 1911 it was estimated that the number of full-
blood aborigines in direct contact with whites or employed
by whites was only 19,939. Most of the aborigines have
retreated to as yet unsettled parts of the dry interior or-
the extreme northern coast, and are not in direct contgoil
with ary centers of white population.
Ko adequate census of the natives of Papua and former
German New Guinea has been made. In 1921 the estimates
were 250,000 for Papua and 230,000 for hew Guinea. The
non-indigenous population of Papua by the same census was
2,078, of whom 1343 were whites, the remainder being
Asiatics and Pacific Islp.nders from other groups of islands.
New Guinea had a non-indigenous population of 3,173, of
whom 1288 were whites.
4. Summary.
Certain points of interest should be specially
mentioned.
1. A practically entirely white population, about 97
percent of whi ch is of Anglo-saxon stock, lives in a
country part of which is tropical.
2. This population is resident mainly in urban areas,
as something less than half can be classed as rural residents.
3. The whites have full control of the situation, with
practically no native population to complicate the sanitary
problem—probably the only completely white settlements to
be found in the tropics. The aborigines in contact with
whites are so few in number as to be negligible frcm a public
health vi ewpoint.
4. Coastal areas exist in which there is a high annual
rainfall and in which the population is largely concentrated;
the interior is dry and sparsely settled.
5. A native population, with the usual sanitary habits of
such populations, exists in Papua and New Guinea and in
certain of the more inaccessible parts of the continent.
Mary of the aborigines of Australia live in the dry interior,
a fact which may have considerable effect on their hookworm
problem.


II. HISTORY OF HOOKWORM INFECTION IN AUSTRALIA
AND ITS DEPENDENCIES.
l. Early History.
The first authoritative diagnosis of hookworm infection
in Australia was made by Dr. J.B. Hogg who reported finding
worm 6 of tte species Ancylostcma duodenale during an autopsy
on a patient of the V/oogaroo Insane A.sylum, now the Goodna
Mental Hospital. It is interesting to note that the
Australian Hookworm Canpaign found that patients at this
hospital were infected by v/orns of the same species. Two
years after this report Drs. Jefferis Turner and Lockhart
Gibson of Brisbanema.de diagnoses of infection vuth hookworms
t>y finding the eggs in the faeces. Subsequent to this,
infections were reported more or less frequenter and repeated
efforts were made to induce Government to take up control work
Drs. Breinl, A.S. Salter and. Turner were particularly active
in this respect. Beports of the Australian Institute of
Tropical Medicine also drew attention to the desirability of
survey an? control work.
The first record of hookworm infection in Papua seems
to have been made by Dr. '7. Giblin, who reported, in 1911,
the finding of hookworm ova in the stools'of eight natives
out often examined on the Lakekanu goldfieids. He obtained
woims from four natives, vhi ch were later identified as
Necator americanus by the Australian Institute of Tropical
TJediciae. In 1914 Dr. '.7.1!. Strong examined the faeces of
215 natives from various groups and reported rates of
hookworm infection varyirg between 11 and 72 percent. He
also stated that village natives appeared to be more free
of the infeotion than plantation laborers.
The report of the German Governpent for 1903-1904
on sickness in its colonies stated that 44 percent of all
natives admitted to German hew Guinea hospitals during the
previous year had shown hookworm ova in their faeces. Post
mortem findings were also reported which established an
infeotion rate of 92 percent. A general order of 1912-1913
made treatment of infected natives compulsory and for a time
all laborers showing gross symptoms of the disease were given
thymol. Occasional reports of hookworm infection were made
after the Australian occupation of German Hew Guinea in 1914.

2. First Co-operative Survey.
In 1916 the Commonwealth of Australia requested the
International Health Beard of the Rockefeller Foundation to
undertake a hookworm survey of Papua. The survey, which was
the first of three co-operative activities in Australia and
its depaidencies, began on June 1, 1917, and was completed*
on September 17 of the same year. Dr. J.H. V’aite of the
International Health Board, vdio conducted the survey, was
considerably handicapped by difficulty in securing staff and
by tte non-arrival of supplies but accomplished valuable work*
His report was publidied by the International Health Board as
'•Report Fo. 7326 - "Report on Hookworm Infection Survey of
Papua". •'
The following table sunmarizes the results of Dr»
Faite's examinations for hookworm ova in faeces. The
method of faecal examination used was the plain smear and
three smears were examined before the patient was declared
not infected. In the table the "village natives" group
includes only natives who gave a definite history of never
having v/orked on or visited plantations; the miscellaneous
group includes wharf, boat and factory boys and hospital
patients who had been in contact with plantations; the
plantation laborers included boys actually engaged on
plantations. All but 22 of the striotly village native group
came from the dry belt that extends for seme distance east
and west of Port Moresby.
Table 1. Results of 1917 Hookworm Survey of Papua.


The following extracts fran his report give Dr.
Waite’s summary of his findings.
"(1) Ko hookworm infection was found i n tie 16 whites
or in the 60 native -.vomen and children examined.
Of 1130 native men, 596, or 52 per cent, showed
infection. Cf 323 village natives, including
208 strictV village natives and 115 new planta-
tion recruits who had not had sufficient time tq
show infection acquired on the plantation, 10
per cent were infected, while of 535 old planta-
tion laborers 74 per cent shewed hookworm ova in
the stools.
"(2) Of the hookworms recovered from autopsies and
other treatment, all proved to be hecator
americanus except 1, which was a female
Ancylostona duodenale. Other parasites found
were Ascaris lumbricoides 7.3 per cent,
Trichuris trichiura 6.8 per cent, and Strongy-
loides intestinalis 0.5 per cent of the total
examinations. There was no evidence of the
presence of either cestodes or trematodes,
which are completely lacking fran the history
Of the Papuan Iledical Service.
"(3) The present effects of hookworm d isease on the
mortality, morbidity, and working efficiency
Of natives are of moderate degree. They can be
accurately measured by the removal of hookworm
parasites and by noting the subsequent improve-
ment. If constant reinfections are not pre-
vented, massive hookworm infection will multiply
the present moderate ill effects of the disease.
"(4) Soil pollution, favoring the spread of dysentery
and hookworm, is a canmon practice throughout
the native v illages and on the developing plan-
tations.
'(5) Dissemination of hookworms is taking place from
the heavily infected plantations to the lightly
infected villages ty the return of hookworm cases
and carriers frem the plantation "seed beds" of
the disease to the home villages."

5. First Survey of Queensland.
After investigations were completed in ?apu-- , plans
were made to attack the hookworm problem in Queens-and.
show its interest in the work, the Queensland Government
contributed £1,552 for twelve months work. The Queensland
Hookworm Campaign, an organic function of the State Depart-
ment of Public Health and conducted also under the advice of,
and in close affiliation with, the Australian Institute of
Tropical Medicine, began work on April 17, 1919 aid continued
operations until the beginning of the work of the Australian
Hookworm Campaign on October 1, 1919, Dr. J.H. 7/aite was in
charge until January, 1919, when Dr. S.l*. Lambert took over
the direction of the campaign.
The Queensland Hookwoim Campaign conducted intensive
operations in the wet coastal belt between Cooktorn -and
Townsville, North Queens laid. Table 2 gives a concise
summary of the work accompli died. More detailed reference
to this work will be found in the d iscussion of the Queensland
endemic areas.
Table 2. Work of the Queensland Hookworm Campaign,
April 17, 1918 - September 30, 1919.


Points of interest in this work were as follows: -
1, Approximately 21 percent of the total population of
the'coastal belt of Forth Queensland was infected with
hookworms. The rates varied from 2.9 percent of 1017
Charters Towers school children and 9.9 percent of 797
residents of Ross Island, Townsville, though 11 percent
in Cooktown and 17 percent in Cairns to 29 percent in the
Kinchinbrook Shire and 46 percent of 221 residents of
Cardwell. The aborigines were fcund to have a hookworm
infection rate of 6-rl percent.
»i •&
2. The amount of hookworm infection ran parallel with
the amount of rainfall in the several districts and it also
reflected the amount of soil pollution prevailing in the
different communities. For example, the sugar-growing
areas, the Cairns, Johnston, and Hinchinbrook Shires,
having a poor standard of sanitary conveniaice and no
night-soil service, had infection rates of 23 to 29 percent,
while the township areas, Cooktown and Cairns, with safer
Closets and nightsoil services, had only 11 and 17 percent
infection rates. The insanitary aborigines, through their .
habit of soil pollution, showed an infection rate of 81
percent.
3. The work showed that approximately 30 percent of all
children examined fron six to eighteen years of age were
infected and that about half of all the infection in the
..white communities was in children of the school age.
Dr. Waite thought this largely due to the prevalent habit
of going barefooted and so ''llowirg the hookworm larvae in
polluted soil every opportunity for entering the body through
penetration of the skin.
4, A classification of infections by race showed
massive Infections in the Italians and 'in Australian
aborigines, resultirg from and reflecting their carelessness
in sanitary matters and their habit of going barefooted.

4. Organization of the Australian Hookworm Campaign.
The ope rations of the Queensland Hookworm Campaign
demonstrated the presence of a hookwoim problem in Queensland
an? aroused public interest in the question. The Federal
Government announced in the House of Representatives on
December 13, 1918, that it was ready to find a substantial
sum for hookworm work to cover a period of five years,
provided the States surveyed would make available a correspord-
amount. The International Health Board signified its •
willingness to furni trained msi for such work and to bear
a fair share of the expense. Arrangements were finally mc-de
along these lines and the Australian Hookworm Campaign was
ready to begin operations on October 1, 1919, when the staff
and work of the Queensland Hookworm Campaign were taken over
(see Part 3 of this Report for details of financial organization).
Dr. Vv’.A. Sawyer of the Internationa 1 Health Board was made
Director of thiswodc, a position which he held until relieved,
for more important v. ! ork ir. Melbourne, on November 25, 1922,
by Dr. \7.C. Sweet, also of the International Health Board.
(a complete list of staff will be found at the erd of Part 3
of thi s Rep rt).
The objects of the Australian Hookworm Campaign were
to map Australia and its dependencies with regard to the
prevalence of hookworm infection, to carry out control measures
wherever infections were found and to devise effective and
economical permanent methods to control the infection. A
secondary object of great importance was to stimulate interest
and activity in public health work in general, and to demonstrate
methods bywhichdisea.se prevention could be carried on
economically on a large scale.
As the support of the Australian Hookworm Campaign,
and the authorization to carry on it s operations, came fran
several sources, it -.vas necessary to devise a. system of
committees to determine policies and give general direction
to the work. For this purpose a Qentral Committee, represent-
ing the Commonwealth, was created. Major policies affecting
the work in general were determined by this committee. With
the creation of the Commonwealth Department of Health on
March 7, 1921, the Federal Director-General of Health, Dr.
J.H.L. Cumpstcn, became the representative of the Commonwealth
in matters pertaining to the Hookworm Campaign ard the Central
Committee ceased to function.
An executive committee was created in each State or
Territoty to determine policies of a local nature. These
executive committees consisted of a representative of each
participating body, the Commonwealth, the State or Territory
and the International Health Board, usually the local
representative of the Commonwealth Department of Health,
the chief public health officer and the Director of the
Hookworm Campaign. The Director carried out the policies
determined by the committees and was entrusted wi th all the
practical details of control.


A central office wa3 established in Brisbane in a
building loaned for use by the QureJiS land Government, and
from this office the field units were controlled. Field
units were in charge of Medical Officers and were engaged in
surveys or intensive control work in definite areas; each
unit had frcm five to seven microscopists and field inspectors.
?he management of the work as a whole, the supervision of all
financial transactions and the issuance of supplies not
purchased locally, were the functions of Central Office, where
a Secretary, Mr. S.G. Palmer, had direct responsibility for
the book-keeping and handle! raitine matters.
On October 1, 1922, the administrative organization
was altered somewhat to allow for the inclusion of the
malaria-filaria survey and the more efficient direction of
the permanent ccntrol programme. By this reorgani nation
the general direct ion and all financial responsibility wore
left in the hands of the Director at the Central Office,
Brisbane. The endemic areas of Queensland *rd New South
Vales were divided into northern and southern di via ions with
the boundary at the northern limit of the I'ackay District.
The northern division was under the immediate control of
Dr. K.vV. Cilento, Director, Australian Institute of Tropical
Medicine of the Divis ion of Tr opi cal Hygiene, Corrmonwealth
Department of Health, and the southern division under the
Director, Hookworm Campaign.
To aid in maintaining close relations between the
local and Ccmmonwealth Governments and the staff engaged
in hookworm control, as well as to give the latter staff
additional standing and authority, the Director ard Medical
Officers in charge of field units were appointed Quarantine
Officers of the Commonwealth and Modi or 1 Officers of Health
of the State of Queensland.
5. Future Hookworm Control Work.
The agreement between the Commonwealth of Australia,
the States and Territories and the International Health
Board, under which the Australian Hookworm Campaign is
worked, comes to an end on September 30, 1924. Certain
steps taken during 1923 led to the consummation of plans for
the continuation of hookworm control work in Australia after
that date. Suggestions for such work were made to the
Governments of Queensland and New South Wales by Dr. W.A.
Sawyer, International Health Board Adviser in Public Health,
Commonwealth Department of Health, and Dr. V/.C. Sweet.


These States notified their acceptance of the suggestions
which were then presented to the Commonwealth Government,
who also agreed to them. The plan suggested contonplates
the dontinuation of hookworm control work for a period of
three years fron October 1, 1924. The expenses of this
work are to be borne by an annual budget of £BOOO, of which
£4OOO will be contributed by the Commonwealth, £3500 by
Queensland and £5OO by Hew South V/ales. The expenditure of
this money will be in the hands of a Director, appointed by
the Commonwealth under State Committees made up of represent-
atives of the Commonwealth and State Governments. £7,000
will be spent in Queensland and £lOOO in New South Wales.
All plans for work are to be approved in advance by the
Commonwealth. The suggested staff mentioned two medical
officers, one sanitary engineer and twelve field inspectors.


III. ORIGINAL SURVEYS OF THE AUSTRALIA
HOOKWORM CAMPAIGN.
1. Method s.
The hookworm work of the Australian Hookr/orm Canpaign
falls into two periods; first, the original survey of Australia
and its dependencies from October 1, 1919, to December 31,
1922; second, permanent control operations whsi attention was
concentrated on endemic areas of hookworm infection, frer
January 1, 1923, to September 30, 1924. There was seme
overlapping of work in both directions but, in the main, those
divisions were distinct.
The original of Australia aid its dependencies
for the purpose of f where hookworm infection existed
was done by three methods. In the survey method certain
representative occupations and ago groups were examined and
those found infected with hookworms were treated. This
method was used in parts of Queensland and for all the other
states and territories. It was early found that the school
children were the most available group and that they were
representative of the hookworm conditions in the area. In
the intensive method, used in parts of Queens land, certain,
definite areas received a thorough house-to-house canvass and
everyone in the area who was willing was examined and treated
if found infected. Some occupations and institutions
required particular attention and this was usually given by
the intensive methodised for the group in ouostion. This
method was used in some of the mining fields and in orphanages,
inbane hospitals and other institutions. By these three
methods the original survey of Australia and its dependencies
was completed about December 31, 1922.
A great deal of the intensive v'ork was in areas not
thickly populated and not well supplied with road 3. Problems
of transportation for the staff were at all times difficult
and considerably increased the cost of the work. In sugar
producing areas, narrow gauge railways could sometimes be
used; in one coastal area a launch was the best means of
transport. In the north where railway comnunication vras
poor, infrequent steamers were the only means of conmunic at ion
between districts. The bulk of the local travelling was
done on horseback. A Ford truck was used in northern I'ew
V/ales, where the roads were suitable. The members
of/ sanitary unit, between October 1, 1922 and July 1, 1924,
travelled an estimated total distance of 30,812 miles, of
which about 14,000 was by train, 10,250 by steamer, 6,000
on horseback and 500 by bicycle and automobile.


Laboratory Methods.
Up to the year 1921 the standard technique of the
Hookworm Campaign for examining faecal specimens was to
make plan snears of the material nibbed up in water end to
examine them under the one-third inch objective of tha
microscope. If this examination was negative, a. suspension
of the faeces in water was centtifuged and the sediment was
similarly examined.
A few of the Medical Officers were beginning to use
the more efficient Hofoii-Barber salt-flotation-loop method
during 1920. At about the beginning of the year 1921
Dy, H.H. Willis, Medical Officer in Charge of Field Unit
No. 4, reported great success with the following simple
salt-flo tat ion method which he had devised: Enough of
the faecal specimen was removed from the quarter-ounce tin,
in which it had been received, to leave the tin about one-
sixth full. A saturated solution of common table salt was
then added slowly frai a drop bottle and the mixture was
thoroughly stirred with a toothpick. The tin was filled
brimming full with the salt solution, and a cle-*n polished
slide measuring two by three inches was la id on the surface
of the liquid. In a couple of minutes the slide was raised
from the tin, turned quickly over, and placed under the
microscope. Hookworm ova, if present, wer9 seen floating
on the surface of the liquid. If the first examination
revealed no ova, another slide was applied to the liquid and
a second preparation was examined.
The advantages of the V/illie metnod were described
by Dr • H.H. V/illis as follows:-
*
"The advantages of this method are:
(I) It allows the general practitioner to make an
accurate diagnosis in his surgery in ten minuteß, no special
apparatus other than a microscope being required. It
likewise allows him to determine easily, and accurately
whether his patients are cured.
(ii) It i s s imple and calls for no special skill or
experience beyond ability to recognize the ova under the
microscope.
(iii) It is rapid. One microscopist can examine 120
specimens in an ordinary working day, a? compared with
50 triien the plain smear-centrifuge metnod is employed.
Y/ith the assistance of a boy, 20C specimens can be
examined in the same time.
(iv) There i s no ri ak of ova being carried over from
one specimen to another, as each specimen is dealt with
in the container in which it is collected.


(v) A snail specimen is adequate. The method Is
therefore suitable for use in canpaign work in country
districts where specimens have to be carried on horseback
for many miles.
(vi) It is more accurate than the combined or plain sirear-.
centrifuge method, as the following records show:
(a) In 71 specimais from patients three weeks after treat-
ment examined by the ordinary method no ancylost ana wer. ■■ I’ound.
They were examined by the levitation method described above
and hookworms were found in 25.
(b) Twenty-three specimens were collected frar persons in
whom infection was suspected from the family history. In
three, hookworms were found on plain snear examination and
four more by the centrifuge method. The remaining sixteen
specimens were then dealt with by the levitation method and
in three of them hookworms were found.
(c) No hookworms were detected in twenty-sis: specimens
collected from patients five weeks after treatment and examined
by the ordinary method. By the levitation method nine ?/ere
found to contain hookvorms.
(d) Forty-five specimens were collected frcm aborigines
v/ho had not been cured by three treatments with oil of
chenopodium, six weeks after ’heir fourth treatment. Ir
sight hookworms were found on plain smear examination, arc
another two by the centrifuge method . All the forty-five
were then examined by the levitation method: hookworms were
found in nineteen specimens, including these found to contain
them by the ordinary method.
(o) In a district where previous examination of school
children had proved the disease to be present, 510 specimens
were collected frem the general population, including persons
of all ages. In twenty-eight specimens hookworms were
detected by the ordinary method, of which twenty were examined
as plain smears and eight by the centrifuge method. The same
510 specimens were then submitted to the levitation method bv~
the sane microscopi sts, but without reference to the results*"
previously obtained. Hookworms wore found by this method in
thirty-eight; this means that the infection rate was not
5.5 %, but 7.5%."

In the course of the investigations at the Hospital
for the Insane at Sandy Gallop some work was done on the
efficiency of the Willis salt-flotation technique of stool
examination in diagnosing cures of hookworm infection.
Workers in other countries came to the conclusion that
microscopic results as an index of cure of Bookworm disease
were of little value. This previous work, however, was
not d cue with the Willis technique and it seemed wise to
test this method against the worm count method. A series
of 119 patients received tria 1 treatments . Three weeks
after the trial treatment all patients were given a
microscopic faecal examination by a strict Willis technique
and were then all given a test treatment of 2 c.c. of oil of
chenopodiura in two doses one hour apart, and followed in two
hours by one and one-half ounces of sulphate. All
patients were re-examined by microscope three weeks later and
those fcund to be still infected were treated to a microscopic
cure. Table 3 gives the results of this test of the Willis
method.
Table 3. Summary of Results of a Test of the V/illla
Method used in diagnosing Cures, p.s against
the Uorm Count Method (Sed Survey Report Mo. 30,
Hookworm Campaign).


Those results show clearly that the V/illis salt-f lotation
technique for the diagnosing of cures of hookworm infection is
fully as efficient as the worm count method, when 2 c.c. doses
of oil of chenopodium are used, if not more so. The microscopii
and worm count methods were in agreement in 84,9 per cent of
the patients and the microscope discovered 96.5 psr cent of
the persons to be infected as against 71.9 per cent discovered
by the worm count method. It would seen fair to conclude
that the use of microscopic results as an index of the cure of
hookworm infection, if the Willis technique is carefully follows*,
Je of value and is correct in most cases.
The V/illis method is a diagnostic method and has not
been adopted for ova counting purposes. Decently Stoll and
Clayton lane have published methods which are intended for
ttje in counting ova. The Clayton Lane method, considered
purely frcm the standpoint of diagnosis of hookwoxn infection
vf/th no reference to number of eggs counted, is slightly rrore
accurate than the V/illis method, but loses this advantage as
the time necessary for the test is considerably greater. In
}JJO faecal examinations recently made hookworm ova were
found by both the V/illis and Clayton Lane methods in 17.3
instances, and by neither in 19 instances; ova were fox id
Vy the Clayton Lane method alone in six instances and only
iy the V/illis method in two cases. The time necessary to
Complete the Clayton Lane examinations wa.s over four times
that necessary for the V/illis method.
*
When the Stoll method J s similarly considered
solely as a diagnostic method, it is found to be less
aocurate than the V/illis method. In 134 faecal examinations
both Stoll and Willis methods found* hookworm ova in 153
instances and failed to find then in*" Seven instance’s; ova
Were found only by the Willis method 23 times and by the
Stoll method alone only once. Should the Stoll method
be used for d iagnosis, this inaccuracy should be
remembered.
2. Results of Original Survey.
Table 4 give's the results of the original survey
by States and Territories. During the three years and
three months, (October 1, 1919 - December 31, 1922), of
this first survey there were 248,721 persons examined, of
whom 48,256 were found to be infected with hookworms.
This is an incidence rate of 19.4 percent.

Table 4. Hookworm Infection in Australia anJ its
Dependencies, as found by the Original
Surrey of the Australian Hookworm Campaign,
The States of Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania
were not endenic hookworm regions. In Victoria 2497 persons
were examined, in South Australia 3201, and 2209 in Tasmania,
but none were fbund infected with hookworms, except two
children in Tasmania, These too children were recent arrivals
fron Fiji and, therefore, could not be regarded as having
locally contracted infections. The survey in these states
cohered representative group a. of people and included a
considerable number of miners. It seemed safe to conclude
fron these results that there was no hookworm problem in the
three southern states. Their climate is such that it is
highly improbable that a hookworm problem will ever exist.

EookTOgn Infection in T/estern Australia and Northern Territory.
In Western Australia, 2846 persons were examined and
308, 10.8 percent, were found to be infected. The
distribution of this infection throughout the State is
in Table 5.
Table 5. Distribution of Hookworm Infection in
Western Australia.
-» Of the three persons infect eel with hookw<rms.in the
isB3 examined in the southern area, two were aborigines and
one a white person. -' One of the two aborigines had recently
come from the Broome area, bit the other two possibly had
locally acquired infections. The incidence of hookworm
infections in this southern area was so small that active
control measures did not appear to be necessary and the area
was classed as non-endemic.
There were 810 persons examined in the Broome area
and 303, 37.4- percent, were infected with hookworms. Only
eight of the infected persons were whites, the remainder
being aborigines. Practically all of the infections in
this area could be traced, directly or indirectly, to Beagle
Bay, a mission station 84 miles north of Broome. Conditions
there were favorable to the spread of the infection and most
of the coastal aborigines spent considerable tine there.


The two infected aborigines in the Derby Aroa, out of
142 examined, were recent arrivals from Beagle Bay. Done
of the eleven persons examined in the \7yndham Area were ,
infected. The hookworm problem in Western Australia is
practically confined to the coastal aborigines in and around
Beagle Bay and to such whites as are in intimate contact
with then. The renainder of the State is free from endemic
hookworm disease. The amount and sources of infection are
not so great but that the State itself can cope with them.
Control measures were undertaken by the State Health Depart-
ment after the Hookworm Campaign’s survey arid it is not
likely that further outside assistance will be necessary
unless conditions change markedly.
There were 886 persons examined in the Northern
Territory and 148, or 16.7 percent, were found to be
infected with hookworms. Nine of the 148 were whites,
131 were aborigines, seven were of the yellow race, and one
of the brown race. An analysis of these infections showed
that a 11 but a few were acquired in the extrone northern
part of the Territorv where the rainfall is over 50 inches,
and on islands off the coast. The endemic hookworm area
of Northern Territory is in and around Darwin, Melville,
Bathurst and Goulbourn Islands and a coastal strip 80 miles
wide from Cape Arnheim to just south of Anson Bay.
Hookworm Infections in New South Wales.
In New SouthT/ales 23,573 persons were examined and
774 were fcundl to be infected with hookworms. This is
an incidence rate of 3.3 percent. The'distribution of
these infections is given in Table 6.

Table 6. Hookworm Infections ir Hew South V/ales.
There were no hookworm infections among 4008 persona
examined at Broken Hill, nor in 3066 school children of the
Newcastle Area, nor among 572 persons on the Kurrumbidgee
Irrigation Project. Four coal miners among the 1603 men
examined from the Bulli and Lithgow fields were infected hut
these fcur were recent arrivals fron Queensland and were not
infected locally. Five miners at Newcastle out of 1224
examined were infected. Three of the five were probably
locally infected so it is possible to acquire hookworms in
the Newcastle coal mines, hut this occurs only rarely.
In the Northern Rivers District, a coastal strip
about 60 miles wide extending from the Tweed River to the
Myall Lakes north of Newcastle, 0602 school children v/ere
examined with 379, 4.4 percent, found to have hookworm
disease. This infection was heaviest in the Tweed River
Area and in the Bellirger-iTambucca Area. The time at the
disposal of the Hookworm Carpalgn never allowed an intensive
survey of these areas, but such a survey should undoubtedly
be made. The aborigines of this district v/ere found to be
heavily t info.cted and an attempt was made to establish periodical
mass treatments. The endemic hookworm area of New South Wales,
then, is the narrow coastal strip referred to as the Northern
Rivers District.

Hookworm Infections in Queensland.
There were 167,290 persons examined during the
first survey, by the Australian Hookwozn Campaign, of
Queensland. Of this number 15,472, or 9.2 percent, were
found to be infected with hookworms. .Most of the coastal
portion of Queensland was surveyed by the intensive method,
while the part west of the Main Coastal Range was covered
by rapid surveys. An analysis of the persons found infected
showed that Queensland had an endemic hookworm area which
comprised all of the Cape York Peninsula and a coastal strip,
averaging about 60 miles wide from Cooktown to the Tweed
River. Certain portions of this strip are lightly infected
and two "islands" of non-endemic area, around Brisbane and
Rockharrpton, were found. The bulk of the non-endemic area
was found to lie between the Gilbert River and the southern
border and the Main Coastal Range and the western.border.
Table 7 gives the distribution of hookworm infections in
Queens land.
Table 7, Hookworci Infections in Queensland.
In the endemic hookworm areas, which were outlined above,
130,833 persons were examined and 14,067 were found to he infected
with hookworms, an incidence rate of 10.7 percent. The more
heavily infected parts of this area were the Nambour, Mackay,
Ingham, Cardwell, Innisfail, Cairns and Cooktown Districts.
The population of the Cape York Peninsula is mainly aboriginal
and is very scattered so that definite control measures there
are out of the question for the present. The northern mission
stations have been supplied with drugs from Thursday Island and
many of them are giving mass treatments at six months intervals.
The coastal endemic area received one intensive house-to-house
canvass during the first survey.


In the non-endemic areas outlined previously, 32,116
persons were examined and 369 were found to carry hookworms,
an incidence rate of 1.2 percent. The greater part of
those found infeoted had previously lived in endemic coastal
areas and did not have locally acquired hookworm infection.
Most of the survey of this area was made by examining the
school children. Unless present coiditions change markedly
this area will not need any further control measures.
There were 1341 miners of endemic coal fields examined
and 517 men were found to be infected with hookworms, a rate
of 38.5 percent. The endemic coal miners are on the Ipswich,
Burrum and Mount Mulligan coal fields. The Ipswich coal
field is in a non-endemic area; the other two are in endemic
areas. New interpretations of the Mines Regulations Acts
of Queensland enforced a high standard of underground sanitation
and it is probable that yearly examination ard treatment of
the miners, wi th enforcement of the sanitation regulations,
will rapidly reduce the incidence rate of hookworm infections.
Certain State institutions inxcn-endenic areas were
found to be endemic foci. Cf 3000 persons examined 499, or
16«6 percent, were found to be infected with hookworms. These
institutions constituted a purely local problem and frequent
examination and treatment, with the introduction of better
sanitation, is reducing the hookworm percentage.
Hookworm Infection in Papua and New Guinea.
The Australian Hookworm Campaign's eurveys of Papua
and New Guinea were made in 1920 and 1921 respectively by
Dr. S.M. Lambert. In Papua 17,905 natives were examined
and 10*601, 59.2 percent, were found infected with hookworms.
Of the 28,234 persons examined in New Guinea 20,951, 74.2 percent,
were found infected. These surveys covered representative parts
of the island. Dr. Lambert found that in Papua the hookworm
infection rate of plantation laborers was elightly higher than
in village natives and heaviest in the Delta Division.


Hookworm infections were uniform in rate and heavy all over
the Territory with the exception of a dry belt in the Central
Division. New Guinea had a senewhat higher rate of
infection than Papua, and had this high rate of infection
throughout, as it had no dry belt. Here again, the rate
for plantation laborers V7as s light fy higher than for village
natives. Dr. Lambert conolnded that intensive methods
were out cf the question in these territories, due to
economic and other reasons, and recommended a system of
mass treatment administered periodically and with no
preliminary microscopic examination. I'ethods along these
lines were adopted and continued with the co-operation of
the Australian Hookwom Campaign in Papua until January 1,
1924, and in Nov/ Guinea until the close of the Hookworm
Campaign activities. Tie Territory Administration of P~oue
took over the matter of treatments on the date mentioned
and arrangements were made to continue the policy in New
Guinea.
5. Endemic Hookworm Areas of Australia and it 3 Dependencies.
1. Papua and New Guinea in toto are endemic hookwoim
areas.
2. A small erdemio area exists around Beagle Bay,
near Broome in T/estern Australia.
3. The northern part of Northern Territory and the
islands off the coast are endemic hookworm areas.
4. The Cape York Peninsula and a Pacific coastal strip
averaging about 60 miles wide fron Cooktown to Coolangatta
constitute the endemic areas of Queensland. An area around
Rockhampton and one around Brisbane must be excluded from
this area, but the Ipswich coalmines must be added.
5. The endemic area of New South Wales is aiong a
coastal strip from the Queensland border to the Myall
Lakes north of Newcastle.
Pig. 1 shows this endemic area v/ith the percentages
of infection found during the original survey by the
Austra li an Hookwo in Campaign.




4« Intestinal Parasites Diagnosed durinr Original Survey.
The faecal examinations done by the Australian
Hookworm Campaigi were made with the primary purpose of
diagnosing hookworm infection but the ova of other
intestinal parasites were always recorded where found.
In countries where the hookworm infection rate is high,
a thorough searoh for ova is not necessary and the
resulting infeotion rates for parasites other than
hookworcis are not likely to be truly representative.
In the examinations made by the Australian Hookworm
Canpaign only 19.4 percent showed hookworm ova; at least
80.6 percent of all examinations were thorough searches
of the whole preparation. It i s probable, therefore,
that the infection rates given in this report for parasites
other than hookvoims are close to ttie true rates for the
population of Australia aid its dependencies.
The results of the examinations made during the
original surveys are classified in Table 0 by States and
Territories and by parasites. There were 202,582 persons
examined in Australia and 46,139 in Papua and Kew Guinea,
a total of 240,721 persons. The greater part of these
people were residents of Queensland but enough v/ere
residents of other States and Territories so that all
results were significant.

Table 8. Intestinal Parasites of Man in Australia and its Pq>endencies as
found by the Australian Hoolwoim Campaign curing its original survqp .


Of the 248721 persons examined, 40256 or 19.4
percent were found to be infected with hookwoims. The
distribution and relations of these hookworm infections have
been discussed elsewhere and need not be considered here.
Infections with Trichuris trichiura, the whip worm,
were found in 9924 people, a rate of 4.0 percent. The
infection rate in the southern third of Australia was very
low, under one percent in South Australia, Victoria and
Tasmania. The rate increased with the approach to tropical
Australia and was highest in Papua and New Guinea. The •
highest State rate found was in New South Y/ales, where
most of the people examined were either children of the
Northern Rivers District or coalminers of the various coal
fields. The hipest local infection ratee in Australia
were found in aboriginal camps of the tropics and subtropics
and in Queensland hospitals for the insane. In these places
the rate approached that fcund in Papua and New Guinea.
Infections with Trichuris would seem to depend, as do
infections with hookworms, on the moisture and temperature
of the area and on the sanitary habits of the population.
Trichuris infections, however, were found muoh farther into
the dry interior, so the spread of this infection does not
respond to low rainfall as ouickly as i s the case with
hookworm infections. The percentage rate of .Trichuris
infections is a fairly sure index of the sanitary standing
of any tropioal or sub-trcpical community in Australia,
exoept in the very dry interior where parasitic infections
of ary kind are very rare.
The infection rate of Oxyuris vermacularis, the pin
worm, was about the same throughout Australia and its
dependencies. The microscopic examination of faeces is
not an adequate method for diagnosing infections with this
parasite, since its ova are not evenly distributed throughout
the stool. In a Queensland institution microscopic methods
established an infection rate for this worm of 2.7 percent t
whils worm counts showed that the true rate was about 71.0
percent. Apparently, however, climatic and sanitary
conditions do not play any very important part in the spread
of this infection, and the aborigines of Northern Queensland
probably have much the same infection rate as the citizens
of Melbourne. Rates were usually somewhat higher where the
people examined were mainly children.


There were only 376 persons out of 202582 examined in
Australia who were infected with Ascaris lumbricoides, the
round worm. This was a rate of 0.2 percent as against
12.3 and 11.3 percents in Papua and Hew Guinea respectively.
The highest rate, two percent, found in Australia was in
the Cape York Peninsula where most of the persons examined
were aborigines and where • conditions were more like they are
in the islands. There would seem to be a tendency to a
higher general rate of infection in whites in the southern
half of the continent than in the northern. In Papua the
infection rate was very irregular, reaching a maximum of
54 percent in one area and in sane places almost disappearing.
A series off 32 post-mortem examinations at Rabaul gave an
Ascaris rate of 18,6 percent. These rates are not as high
as those in other countries with a similar native population.
The infection rates for Oxyuris incognita are not
reliable as the early methods of faecal diagnosis were not
suited to showing the very lijit ova of this undiscovered
parasite. The absence of infection in the southern part of
Australia and in Papua was probably due to this fact. Its
true rate in Queens larfl is probably between one and two
percent, the most usual rate in that State when adequate
methods of d iagrosis are used. Dr. Burnell, formerly
Assistant Director of the Hookworm Campaign, found that the
maximum number of infections were found during the sunmer
months. Recent woik has shown that this ova is a purely
inci dental "Yind ing and that the parasite responsible is a
nematode found on green vegetables and the like.
There were 616 persons found infected with the snail
tape-worm, Hymenolepis nana. The highest rate for this
parasite was in New Guinea, 0.4 percent, and the lowest,
no infections, in Tasmania. This would seen to-be an
infection favored by tropical climates. The rates on the
continent were highest amongst the aborigines, where the
infection was found in groups of children who were more or
less intimately associated.


Strongyloides stercoralis occurs in the faeces in
the larval stage so the Willis salt-f lotation method of faecal
examination is not very efficient in disgnosing infections
with this parasite. Infections were found in every State
and Territory with the exception of Tasmania and were apparent-
ly not more common in tropical Australia. The infection
rate was sometimes found to he very high in small communities
with a low sanitary standard.
Infections with Taenia saginata and Taenia solium
were very rare in Australia and were absent in Papua and
New Guinea. The rarity of Taenia saginata infections in
a country where so much beef is raised and consumed is
remarkable. Of the 42 infeotions with these two parasites
25 were not classified in reports, six were with Taenia
solium and eleven with Taenia saginata. The rates were
higher in Hew South Wales and South Australia than in
Queensland but no infections were found in the other States.
There are twelve infections listed in Table 8 under
"other parasites"; these were, five infections with
Hymenolepis diminuta, two with Dibothriocephalus latus, two
with Clonorchis sinensis and three with Haemonchus oontortus.
Four of the infections with Hymenolepis diminuta were in
residents of Queensland and one in a resident of Northern
New South Wales. The two infections with Dibothriocephalus
latus were found in persons resident in Queensland who had
come frcm Finland . Two Chinese residents of Queensland were
found infected with Clonorchis sinensis. The three infeotions
with Haemonchus contortus were found in aborigines of the
Moore River Settlement in Western Australia; the faeces
examined were probably contaminated with soil previously
polluted by sheep.
There were 55 examinations which yielded unknown ova.
These were probably unusual foms of Ascaris eggs in many
instances, while others were possibly not ova at all.


In addition to the ova reported above, an
unidentified trematode ova was found in a native of New
Guinea. Ova which were probably those of Trichostrongylus
orient alls were found in a few instances; the adult worm
was never recovered in spite of repeated efforts with various
drigs.
Dr. H.H. V/illis, while engaged on a survey of
Townsville and vicinity, examined 440 faecal specimens
for cysts with the following results: -
Cysts found 208 specimens
No cysts found 232 "
440
The cysts fcund were as follows:-
Lamblia intestinalis 84 —l9 percent
E. coli 70 16 percent
E. histolytioa 5 1 percent
lodine cysts (Wenyon) 7 2 percent
Blastocystis hominis 109 25 percent
5. Number and Species of Hookwoims Found during Original
Survey.
The obtaining of worms following treatment is a
difficult process unless the patient is under proper control,
so that no stools are lost. To acconplish adequate worm
counts under field conditions is almost impossible and
results are usually only partial. The field staff of the
Australian Hookworm Campaign was requested to obtain such
counts as frequently as possible but reported results were
not sufficient to be very valuable. There are, however,
sane points of interest in Table 9, which gives the results
of all worm counts reported during the original survey.

Table 9. Number of Worm Counts Reported and Number
and Species of Hookworms Found during the
Original Survey of Australia and its
Depend encies.
Worm counts were made on 637 person v/ho yielded 41838
hookworms of which number 3381 were of the species Ancylosterna
duodenale, 31833 Necator americanus, ahd 6624 we re not classified
as t o species. Most of the ancylo stem es were recovered from
patients in two Hospitals for the Insane near Brisbane. These
hospitals were found to be strictfy limited foci of endenicity,
both were in non-endemic areas, ard to be distinct from the
usual Queensland hookworm infections in the preponderance of
ancylostomes found. Practically all of the ancylostomes recover-
ed from aborigines in Queensland were recovered from residents
of Mornington Island in the Gulf of Carpentaria.


The very few counts on aborigines in V/estern Australia and
Northern Territoiy yielded ancylostomes only. This species
was in a decided minority in counts made on natives of
Papua and New Guinea. The ancylostcme di strihut ion in
Australia would seem to be in the extreme north-western
part of Queensland and in the endemic areas of Western Australia
and Northern Territory. With the exception of the two hospitals
previously maitioned the preponderant infection in Australian
endemic areas, and in Papua and New Guinea, is with Necator
americanus.
Conclusions as to the average number of hookworms
per person tested must be drawn with caution. Maty .of the
counts on vhite persons were made on patients selected
because of obvious symptoms of hookworm disease; many counts
on whites, most counts on aborigines and many of the Papuan
counts were only partial due to the loss of stools o r to
stools being collected for an insufficient number of days
following treatment. The average number of hookworms per
person of the 165 vhite persons whose worms were counted was
about 49. The partial counts made may have balanced the
number of worms recovered in full counts on specially selected
heavy infections; from all the evidence it seems probable
that this figure is near the true average for infected persons
although probably s lightly too high. The average of 12 worms
per person in the 112 aborigines reported is obviously too low;
most of these counts were only partial ones, as stated before.
The average of 31 worms per person ir. the Papuan counts is
als o low* a carefully controlled series of 20 forty-eight hour
counts gave an average of 67.3 worms per person. In New
Guinea the average of 104 v/orms per perscr. was apparently
nearly correct, as 187 controlled counts gave an average of
95.5 worms per person.
6. Hookworm Infection by Age Groups.
The hookworm infections by age groups as found
during the original surveys are given in Table 10. . The
figures are divided into age groups for Australia, both
whites aid aborigines beirg in luded; the ages of aborigines
are difficult to obtain and most of the examinations of this
racial group are included under the "not classified" part of
this table. Ages were also difficult to obtain in Papua and
New Guinea and examinations there were divided into children
and adults only, with a large not classified git ap. The
totcl number of persons examined during tie original survey,
as has been previous ty stated, was 248,721, of whom 48,256
were found to be infected with hookworms.

•Table 10. Hookworm Infection by Age Groups as Found
by Criminal Survey.
Tl}e highest hookworm infection rate in Austral!a was
found in the 6 to IS years age group, if the 21.7 percent
infection of the "not classified" group is not considered.
This was not true in Papua and Few Guinea where the adult age
group had a higher infection rate than the children's group.
Some of the lowered percentage in the latter group was probably
due to the fact that large numbers of children resident in
the "dry belt" of Papua, where infection rates were lower than
in other parts of the islands, were included. native races
who go barefooted throughout life usually show a d istribution
of infection which has its highest point during the active years
of life; that is, they acquire their infections slowly during
their childhood and the highest rate, and heaviest infection, •
is found during the time when they are most active, after which
they slowly lose their infection. In Australia, this should be
true of the aborigines, who go through life barefooted to a
large extent, tut should not apply to the white race. The
whites of Australia do not go barefooted as a. rule except when
they are children; they should, then, have the most infection
in the groups up to 18 years, after v/hi ch they put on shoes
and slowly lose the infection acquired during a barefooted childhood.

That this is true is shown in Table 11, the figures for
vvhich were taken frcm certain of the Queensland districts
covered during the original survey. '’’he age distribution
of infection in the white race is here contrasted with the
distribution amongst the e.borigines, living la.rgely in the
same, or nearby, communities.
Table 11» Distribution of Hookworm Infection by
Age-groups in V/lii tes and aborigines in
Queens land.
In Table 11, the hookworm infection rate amongst the
aborigines is found to be highest in the 19 to 40 and 41 to
60 years age groups, with the lowest rate in the oldest, least
active group, as was to have been expected. In the v/hites,
the highest rates are in the children's groups, with over half
of the total infection in the-6 to 18 year age group. It is
quite apparent that Australians acouire the bulk of their
hookworm infection during a barefooted youth and in plaoes
frequented by children; as a rule, they slowly lose this
infection during their adult years, with only enou{£i new

infections acquired to make a oanparatively moderate
incidence rate. Either the wearing of shoes by ohildren or
the "cleaning up" of places frequented by chi ldren would go
a long wgy in reducing the infection incidence amongst whites
in Australia.
7. Hookworm Infection by Race.
The incidence of hookworm infection by race as found
by the original survey is shown in Table 12. In this table
all examinations of natives of Papua and Ilew Guinea are given
under the brovai race, which is not strictly correct as some
should be listed under the black race. The aborigines, as
well as the scattering Bast Indians and Kanakas of Australia,
are listed under the black race; the numbers of the last
two mentioned races were very small and probably did not
influence the incidence rate amongst the aborigines.
Table 12. Hookworm Infection by Race as Found by
Original Survey of the Australian
Ho ok worn Campaign.
The hookworm infection rate amongst 189,265 whites of
Australia examined was 6.3 percent, the lovvest rate for ary
racial group. The black race, mostly aborigines, show a low
rate of infection in this table due to the inclusion of
members of that race resident in the dry interior. The
infection rates for aborigines resident in the high rainfall
areas were around 60 to 70 percent, while the inland camps
with lighter rainfalls gave rates around 10 to 20 percent;

the aborigines from the dry interior who were available for
examination were not infected. The yellow race, mostly
Chinese resident in coastal towns, had the comparatively low
infection rate of S.C percent in spite of the fact that many
of them probably came originally frcm heavily infected parts
of China; they would seem to have lost infection rather
than to have gained any in Australia unless a fair proportion
of them were born in Australia, a factor which was not reported.
The distribution of infection by nationalities in
certain Queensland endemic areas was of interest* Data in
regard to this were collected in three North Queensland areas.
The distribution by nationality for these three districts is
given in Table 13. In this table the "British" include a
snail number of naturalized Germans, Danes, Russians, etc.
The "Other European" group was largely made up of Greeks;
a few Haltese were included with them. The "Asiatics" were
Chinese and Japanese, mainly the former, and the "Pacific
Islanders" were mainly Kanakas.
Table 13. Hookworm Infection by Nationality in
Three North Queensland Districts.


The highest rate was in the aboriginal group, of
which 62.1 percent were infected with hookworms. As only
three Hindus were examined no conclusions could be drawn.
The cooperatively high rates of infection amongst the
Italians and Spanish were of interest. These two
nationalities possibly bring considerable hookworm infection
with them when they arrive in Australia and as most of them
work in sugar cane areas their lax sanitary habits help to
spread infection. Members of these nationalities in
Australia are largely concentrated in these North Queensland
districts and they.there constitute a menace to public health
as they live in intimate contact with other menbers of the
white race. The menbers of the'bther European" group were
mainly shop helpers and their occupation apparently prevented,
to a large extent, the acquiring of hookworm infection. The
higher rates in these racial groups, with the possible
exception of the eto riginal group, are of interest since
the menbers mix freely with the British group and lower the
general sanitary standard of their coranuni ties.
8. Effects of Hookworm Infection in Australia.
The average number of hookvorms per inf ected white
Australian is small and obvious clinical synptoms of
infection are comparatively rare. TJ:is applies also to the
aborigines living in areas of lower rainfall but is not so
true of members of this race resident in the north; in the
northern higher rainfall areas clinical signs of hookworm
disease are fairly frequent. No well organized effort w? 3
made by the Australian Hookworm Campaign to collect statistics
as to the effects of hookworm infection or.the results of
treatment. Certain data collected along this line are,
however, of sane value.
Dr. J.H. V/aite, during the operations of the Queensland
Hookwoim Campaign in 1918, stated that, "the m easurement by
Tallqvist scale of 1,322 infected cases showed an average
haemoglobin of 72.9 percent and a minimum of 20 percent in
badly infected cases. A haemoglobin of 70 percent or less
was found in three-fifths of 892 infected school children
who were tested."
"2. Arrested physical growth and arrested sexual development,
the outcane of prolonged anaemia in growing children, is
conspicuous in the Cairns and Innisfail districts. Prolonged
severe hookwoirn infection gives the hookworm dwarf the immature
body of a child, with infantile genitalia, absence of secondary
sexual characteristics, and the relief of the disease in these
cases gives the most remarkable results in the immediate growth
of body and maturation of sex."

"3. Mental retardation to the extent of two years*
was demonstrated by the results of applying the Binet-Simon
and the Porters mental tests to 159 heavily infected school
children and comparing such results with those obtained
similarly fran 116 hookworm-free children coming fron the
same homes and attending the same schools as the hookworm
infected children.”
The mental tests mentioned above also showed a
relation between the degree of hookworm infection and the
amount of mental retardat ion, light fy infected children being
only a few months behind their hookworm free comrades, while
heavier infected children were farther behind. A relation
was also found to exist between the lergth of time the
infection had been carried and the degree of mental dullness.
The age of onset of the infection was also .important as the
most backward children invariably gave a history of an early
infect ion.
Estimations of the haemoglobin of persons infected
and not infected with hookworms were msde during the work of
the Australian Hookworm Campaign. These estimations were
made by the Tallqvist scale. All of the persons tested
in Australia were residents of areas in which malaria was
not endemic and the greater share of the reduction of
haemoglobin shown by Table 14 can .be ascribed to hookworm
infection. This was not true in Papua and Hew Guinea,
where malaria is endemic.
Table 14. Haemoglobin Estimations by the Tallavist Scale
as Reported by the Australian Hookworm Campaign.
Waite, J.H. and Meilson I.L. - "A Study of the Effects of
Hookworm Infection upon the Mental Development of North
Queensland School Children” - Medical Journal of Australia,
Vol. 1, 6th Year, Ko. 1, January 4, 1919.


The average haemoglobin percentage, by the Tallovist
method, of 592 whites r.ot infected v/ith hookworms was 62.0,
whereas 666 infected whites had 75.9 percent of haemoglobin,
a reduction of approximately seven points. The estimations
were made on people of all age groups, but results were not
classified by ages; the reduction in children only would
probably be greater then is suggested by this table. The
number of aborigines examined was small but the reduction
shown i s not as great as in the white race. Aborigines,
in coirmon with other native races, probabfy do not react to
hookworm infection as quickly or strongly as do members of
the white race, in spite of what is probably a heavier average
infection. The presence of malaria in the dependencies makes
the use of haemoglobin percentages somewhat problematical.
The visible effects of hookworm infection in whites
in Australia are undeniably small and occur in only a small
percentage of the infected persons of any districts. The
occult effects are, however, much more wide-spread and even
the snail degree of infection in Australia is producing an
appreciable lowering of the health of the nation. The most
Ber ious aspect of the question is that concerned with the
children. Slightly over half of all the infection in
Australia is in children of the growing age and is exerting
a considerable effect on this group. The frequently
unnoticed general retardation consequent upon the infection
must have a considerable influence on the children, especially
of Queensland. Such effects may to a large extent be removed
by treatment but long continued infection undoubtedly produces
damage which is permanent. The oontrol of this source of
lowered standards, in tbe children particularly, will undoubted-
ly have considerable effect on the general health of the nation
and, more particularly, on the production of a virile, healthy
white race in the tropical port ions of Australia.
9, Rainfall and Hookworm Infection in Australia.
The endemic hookworm areas of Australia correspond very
closely to the high rainfall areas of the tropical and sub-
tropical portions of the continent. The hookworm egg needs
warmth as well as moisture to complete its development and
high rainfall areas in the southern parts of the continent do
not have endemic hookworm infection since sufficiently high
temperatures do not endure long enough to allow hatching of
hookworm eggs and development of larvae. llorth of approximate-
ly the 32° of south latitude, the warmth necessary is found
for at least part of the year and in that part of the continent
the endemicity of hookworm infection depends to a great exteit
on the rainfall during the months of the year sufficiently warm
to favour development of the ova. Many other factors are,

of course,concerned in the question of endemicity, notably
soil pollution and the habits of the people, but these other
factors being eoual rainfall is apparently the deciding
point. This was well demonstrated during the original
survey of the state of Queensland, as is seen in Table 15,
which gives the original rate of infection and the approximate
average annual rainfall in representative Queensland districts.
Table 15. Relation of Rate of Hookworm Infection to
Rainfall in Representative Queens tend Districts.
The average hookwom infection rate of six districts
with an average annual rainfall of 95.5 inches was 21.65,
as against 0.9 for an equal number of districts with an
average rainfall of 30.3 inches. Not only do the wide
variations in rainfall have a controlling influence tut
smaller variations in each grcup seem also to have an effect.
In the first grcup the fcur districts with an annual rainfall
below 100 inches have an average infection rate of 20.2
against 25.1 for the two districts with a rainfall above 100
inches. The difference between infection rates in districts
with rainfalls below 40 inches and those in districts above
40 inches annua 1 rainfs 11 is noticeable. It seems fair to
conclude that at least 40 inches of rainfall per annum are


necessary to allow hookworm infection to be endemic;
variations in rainfall above 40 inches per annum have
considerable influence on the infection rate,'but other
factors play a more noticeable part and the percentage rates
do not alvays correspond to rainfall rates in areas of high
rainfall.
10. Hookworm Infection in Urban and Rural Areas.
Heokworm infection is more cannon in the rural parts
of endemic areas than in the correspond ing urban oenters.
In eight principal cities and towns of six Oueensh.nd. endemic
districts, the Australian Hookworm Cannaign examined 20,G62
persons and found 1764 to be infected with hookworms, a rate
of 0.4 percent. In the rural areas of these districts,
33523 persons were examined, with 4903 found infected, 14.6
percent. Certain points of urban residence are of interest
in this eonnection. All of these communities bad organized
sanitary services with more or less efficient disposal of
nightsoil; thi 3 was not true of the rural areas. Host of
the urban communities had full or part time sanitaiy inspector s
and earth closets were undoubtedly more efficient in preventing’
soil-pollution than correspond iig conveniences in rural areas
where there was no adequate supervision. Going barefooted
by adults would be more common in rural areas than in urban
communities; barefooted children would be about equal in
number, possibly to a somewhat greater age in the rural areas.
Incidental soil pollution would be more common in rural areas.
Occupations would , of course, be widely different in residents
of the two areas. A combination of these causes explains
the difference in the incidence of hookworm infection, with
the sanitary services and better standard closets probably
playing a very important part.
11. Hookworm Infection and Occupation.
As has already been demonstrated, hookworm infection
in Australia is most frequent amongst children of the school
age. This relation holds true in general for various
occupations throughout the endemic areas of Australia; that is,
the children of the adults engaged in any occupation have a
higher rate of infection than the adults themselves. This
relation may not exist in special circuastances, notably in
the case of miners, but is usually true. In the Burrum Shire,
where endemic hookworm infection existed in the mines and on
the surface, 224 underground miners had an infection rate of
03.0 percent, while their 242 children of the school age had a
rate of only 54.1 percent. Forty surface mine employees,
who occasionally went underground, had a hookworm infection
rate of 55.0 percent, and their 47 children, one of 46.0.

V/hen the special mine conditions were not operative, the
children had the rate; 140 adult townspeople had a
rate of 23.6 percent vliile 46 of their children had 34. 8
percent infected. This was also true of the farming people
of this Shire where 29 farmers had a rate of 40.3 percent,
42 adult members of their households had a rate of 19.0 percent
and 56.8 percent of their 37 children of school age were infect'
ed with hookworms. That is, when special circisnstances, such
as the infected mines, were not operative children of school
age were more heavily infected than the adults engaged in ary
occupation.
The persons examined in four endemic districts were
classified by occupations. The results are given in Table 16.
The four districts which were thus classified were lightly
infected ones but the results are typical of all the endemic
areas of Australia.
Table 16, Hookworm Infections by Occupations in Four
Rural Districts of Australia.
From this table the conclusion can he drawn that
hookworm infection in the white population of Australia is
about 50 percent more prevalent among children of school age
than amorg agricultural workers, and that the infection cannot
in general be classed as an industrial one related to tilling
of the soil. As has been pointed out the infection is more
a rural one than an urban one but the higher rural rate is
not necessarily related to farming as an occupation.


The adults as a rule lose more woims than they acquire,
regardless of their occupation, partly because they wear
boots much of the tine and partly because the places in which
they work do not have as heavy a soil pollution as the places
in which the children p£iny—around the homes and possibly
the schools.
12. Hookworm Infection in Australian Hines.
Special investigations of hookworm infections in
mines were undertaken by the Australian Hookworm Canpaign.
The metalliferous mines examined were on the Kalgoorlie
field of Western Australia, the Kadina, Wallaroo and Moonta
fields of South Australia, the Bendigo field of Victoria,
the Broken Hill field of Hew South V/ales, the Mount Morgan
and Chillagoe fields of Queensland, the Queenstown, Branxholme,
Zeehan and Waratah fields of Tasmania, a few tin mines in
Northern Territory and three mines in Papua. In Papua 579
miners were examined and 380, or 65.6 percent, were found
infected with hookworms, a rate only very little higher than
that for natives not engaged in mining. Out of 5165
metalliferous miners of Australia only two were found to be
infected. Both of these men w ere engaged on the Mount
Morgan mining field and both gave such histories of previous
residence as to make it seem highly probable that their infection
had no connection with their occupation as miners. The
metalliferous mines of Australia were free of endemic hookworm
infect ions.
The coal mines investigated were on the Collie field
of V/estem Australia, V/onthaggi field of Victoria, Newcastle-
Maitland, Bulli and Lithgow fields of Hew South Wales, the
Mount Nicholas-Cornwall field of Tasmania and the Ipswich,
Burrum, Darling Downs, Blair Athol and Mount Mulligan fields
of Queenslairi. There were 5063 coal miners examined with
644 found infected with hookworms. Hone of the coal miners
of V/estern Australia, Victoria or Tasmania were found irfected.
Nine out of 2827 coal miners on New South wales fields were
infected, five on the Newcastle Maitland, field, three on the
Bulli field and one on the Li thgow field. Two of the five
infected Newcastle miners and all of the infected men on the
Bulli and Lithgow fields had probably acquired their infection
elsewhere. The N ewe as 11 e -M? i t land coal miners are probably
lightly infectedand it is possible, rarely, to acquire hookworm
infection in them.


In Queensland 1C29 coal miners were examined and 635,
or 34.7 percent were found infected with hookworms. It was
found that the Ipswich and Burrum fields were hea.vy endemic
foci and that the mines were responsible for all of the
infection in the Ipswich area and a considerable part of-it
in the Burrum area. The Darling Downs collieries and the
Mount Mulligan mine were lightly infected and, although not
a serious problem with conditions as they were at the time of
survey, might become so with an increase in number of men
enployed . The Blair Athol field was found to be non-endemic.
On the recommendation of the Hookworm Campaign, the
Queensland Department of Mines issued new interpretations
of the mines regulations act and sanitary measures were
greatly improved. Other steps were taken by the Department
to ccnbat the pollution of mines and to induce miners to
wear boots to work. These steps should result in the gradual
elimination of hookworm infection frcm the Queensland coal
mines.


IV. PERMANENT CONTROL OPERATION OF THE
AUSTRALIA HOOKWORM CAMPAIGN.
The original survejsby the Australian Hookworm
Campaign were practically conpleted "by the end of 1922.
During the last months of that year and for the next two years,
a scheme for permanent control of hookworm infections was put
into operation in the endemic hookworm areas of Australia and
its dependencies. The plan under which the permanent control
of hookwo xa infection was to be attenpted was outlined by
Dr. V, 7 .A. Sawyer of the Internationa. 1 Health Board as follows.
1. Permanent control pro^ranme.
"To secure the maximum public benefit from hookworm
control it will be necessary to adapt the methods to local
conditions, the most important of which are the prevalence
and severity of the infection. These are, in general,
proportional to the percentage of infected persons in
the pdpulation. To determine this percentage at intervals
sufficiently frequent for the purposes of systematic control
would involve the continuous employment of a considerable
staff. It is believed that sufficient information could
be obtained -"at much less expense by the determination of a
hookworm index for each canmunity by computing it from the
results of the periodic examination of the most accessible
and most heavily infected part of the population, the school
children. It has been decided, therefore, to determine the
kind and amount of hookworm work whi ch is to be done under
the plan in each community in which hookworm infection has
previously been found, in the general survey, on the basis
of a hookworm index ascertained as follows:
"At regular into, als, usually annually, the majority,
of the school children from six to years of age
will be examined for hookworm infection by the microscopic
search for hookworm ova in specimens of their faeces.
Frcm the percentage of children found to have hookworm
infection will be computed the hookworm index (or percentage
infection rate) of the genera 1 population of the area in
v/hich the children reside.

"The percentage of infection in school children will
tend among the white population to be distinctly higher
than the percentage of infected persons in the district
(the hookworm index), as the barefooted children are much
more exposed to infection than the shoe-wearing adults. In
fact, the percentage of infection amoJ%- Australian Bchool
children has been f;und in a number of areas to be almost
double that of the general population. The estimation of the
infection rate of the general population, frcm the results of
the examinations of school children, can be readily made by
use of the table shown below. This table is based on the
examination of a. series cf 9,392 white persons in Queensland
in the Eowen and Nanbcur districts of the Hookworm Campaign.
Table 17. Table for Use in Estimating the Hookworm
Index of Australian White Communities.
"To illustrate the use of the table, consider a group of
white school children of the approximate age of eight years,
in which 20 per cent are found to be infected with hookworms.
The hookworm index, or estimated infection rate for all ages
in the same conrrunity, would be 0.72 times 20, or 14.4. On
the other hand, if the group ranged fairly evenly between the
ages of eight and twelve years and the infection rate v>as 20
per cent, the estimated infection rate for the whole community
would be 0.57 times 20, or 11.4. The table would apply only to
white cannunities where conditions are comparable with those in
Queens land.


"The benefit of the examination and the treatment of
school children in ccnnection with the determination of the
index woild be considerable, as they are the part of the
population most exposed to infection, most injured by hookworm
disease and most helped by its discovery and treatment.
"Where the infection rate is very low it will be necessary
to correct the rate by excluding fran the computation persons
obviously infected away fron the area under investigation.
This will be important in areas almost free from endemic
hookworm disease, but situated near areas having a. high
infection rate.
Classification of Territory.
"On the basis of the hookworm index all territoiy in
Australia would be classified under the plan as follows:
Class 1. Index, oto 0.9. No endemic hookworm disease.
Class 2. Index, Ito 4.9. Very light infection.
Class 3. Index, sto 9.9. Light infection.
Class 4. Index, 10 to 19.9 Moderate infection.
Class 5. Index, 20 to 49.9. *Heavy infection.
Class 6. Index, 50 to. 100. Very heavy infection.
Class 7. Groups requiring special measures,
Territories of Papua ard laU German New
Guinea and settlements of Australian
aborigines having a high infection rate.
"The ambulatory field unit, which determines the annual
hookworm index, should also carry out the lb llowing control
wprk in co-operation with the local Medical Officers of
Health and school authorities.
"A 11 persons found infected should be treated.. The
mer.bers of the households of children found infected should
be examined and their latrines inspected. A temporary
dispensary should be opened where any person could be examined
for hookwoim disease and treated if infected. In co-operation
with the local Medical Officer of Health a latrine survey
should be made. School talks ard public lectures, illustrated
with charts, lantern slides or moving pictures, should be given
and an effort should be made to create a community ambition to
rise to a better classification under the hookworm index.
Through personal interviews or group conferences the co-operation
of local practitioners and public health workers should be
specially sought after, so that the greatest possible improvement
will be brought about before the next index is taken.


"The frequent instruction of school children residing
in infected areas concerning the dangers of soil pollution
and the methods by which hookworm disease can be avoided,
is a most important part of the programme and requires the
co-operation of the State Department of Public Instruction,
The plan includes instruction in schools in infected areas,
in addition to that in connection with the talcing of the
index and the intensive operations of the Hookworm Canpaign.
The "Health Week Lessons" published by the Queensland Depart-
ment of Public Instruction as a supplement to the Education
Office Gazette of October, 1922, and the pamphlet "The Fight
Against Hookvrorm Di sease" furnish adequate information for the
use of teachers and can be obtained from the Central Office
of the Hookworm Canpaign.

The Special Problem of the Native»
"In working amorg natives of Papua and Australian
aborigines, included in Class 7, special methods are necessary.
These special methods consist usually of an initial survey by
the Hookworm Campaign of representative groups of people in
communities in all the major subdivisions of the area under
investigation. Such a survey has been made in Papua, New
Guinea, and the northern part of Australian It permits the
mapping of the country according to the*d istritution of the
several grades of infection. During this kind of survey
illustrated talks are given to the natives by white or native
lecturers and treatment is administered. An attempt is made
to prevent soil pollution and to start the demand for seme
suitable form of latrine, even in the villages. On plantations,
mission stations, government settlements and in other places
where the natives are under the influence and control of competent
white persons the installation of latrines is brought about
through persuasion and Goverrment regulation. In such places,
if the infection rate is high, arrargonerts are often made, and
in sone instances are required by Goverrment regulation, that
the natives should be given a routine treatment once every six
or twelve months to minimize the physical injury from infection
with hookworms and other intestinal parasi tea until control
measures become effective. Under these caiditione arrangements
can usually be made by which the Hookworm Campaign furnishes
the drugs and printed directions on condition that regular
reports shall be made with regard to the treatment and that the
control work shall be under the supervision of the chief Govern-
ment Medical Officer. Areas would be allotted to Class 7
only when intensive control operations are clearly not practicable.
"The team which determine the hookworm index would be the
beginning of the permanent organization under the Division of
Tropical Hygiene of the Commonwealth Department of Health,
wo iking in co-operation with the States, which would prevent
hookworm disease from again becoming prevalent in any part
of the Commonwea Ith, The present Hookworm Campaign is the
larger, temporary organization created for the purpose of
determining conditions.with regard to hookworm infection and
making a rapid fight to bring the incidence of the disease
down to a point at which it will cease to produce noticeable
deleterious effects on health and at which it can be kept by
continuous control measures of moderate cost.
"The plan as presented will furnish a simple basis for the
more exact measurement of the successes and failures of the
Hookworm Campaign in Australia ard will also establish a
procedure for the control of the residual infection after
the greatest possible benefit has been derived from intensive
methods.

'•lnherent in the plan outlined above is the systemof
mapping the State into zones having common problems and then
concentrating the principal attack on the most serious menace
in each zone. Endemic hookworm disease is limited sharply
to certain areas and malaria appears to involve a distinctly
smaller region. It wculd be wasteful to preach hookworm and
malaria caitrol in the dry interior to the neglect of the
health problems peculiar to that region, as for example, eye
infections associated with the f nuisance. Differences of
temperature, rainfall, aid dens ity of population determine
to a large extent the predominant preventable diseases and the
practicability of effective control measures."
2. Work Done under Permanent Control Programme.
Permanent control work was carried on during 1923 and
1924, and to some extent during 1922, under the schane outlined
above. Table 19 gives a summary of the work accomplished
under this plan. There were 124,013 persons examined of whom
9190 were found infected with hookworms, 7.4 percent. The
table gives these examinations and infections and treatments
by States and Territories and they will be considered in that
way.
Table 19. Permanent Control Operations of the Australian
Hookworm Campaign.
3» Weetern Australia.
The results of the original survey of Western Australia
were given in Table 5, Since the endemic hookworm area of
this State was so small, the State Health Department undertook
all permanent control operations and results are not recorded
in Table 19. The work of the State Hes Ith Department is
summarized in a letter written to Dr. Cumpston, Federal
Director General of Health; a copy follows:-


"I am in receipt of ycursof the 27th May asking
for certain particulars regard ing the steps taken
in connection wit h hookw<r m disease in the endemic area*
The few cases found in Broome originated at Beagle
Bay Mission so that Broome is not regarded as an endemic
centre and no action has been taken there.
With regard to the Beagle Bay Mission, however, after
the departure of Dr. Baldwin a further treatment was
given, by the Nurses attached to the Mission, to all
cases discovered by him and this is re-instituted
whenever a departure fron health is noted which suggests
hookworm d isease.
The Local Police Constable was appointed an honorary
Health Inspector of this Department and saw to the
carrying out of certain sanitary measures recommended
by Dr. Baldwin, including the provision of extra
privies, etc., and the drainage of wet areas. He
further makes periodical inspections and sees to the
maintenance of sanitary conditions.
ito endeavour has also been made to treat all
natives in the district who come into contact with
the Mission natives occasionally, and maiy of these,
probably 75 percent, have been treated over a period
of three weeks, receiving in all three treatments.
We have no medical officer nearer than Broome or
Derby and none has visited since Dr. Baldwin's visit,
so that further microscopical tests have not been
carried out.
There are several well-trained nursing sisters at
the Mission and these ladies have Allowed Doctor
Baldwin's instructions carefully and are supplied
with the necessary oil, etc., on requisition, by the
Department."
4« Papua and New Guinea.
Following the survey of the Territories of Papua and New
Guinea by Dr. S.M. lambert for the Australian Hookworm Campaign
in 1920 and 1921 (see Table 4), the policy of giving mass
treatments was instituted, Under this plan treatmsits for
hookworm infection, at first with oil of chenopodium and later
with carbon tetrachloride, were administered to natives during
the periodical tax patrols. The Australian Hookworm Campaign
bore a proportion of the expenses of this schere and supplied
the drugs, the treatments being given by the Administration.
The agreement continued until January 1924 v/ith Papua, when
the Territory continued the schgne under its own auspices;
in New Guinea the Administration and the Australian Hoolcc rm
Campaign worked together until September 20, 1924.


Between January 1, 1922, and the terminating dates
given above, 99213 natives were treated in Papua and 177,285
in New Guinea. These treatments are not strict V first
treatments as many natives were probably re-treated during
successive patrols; it was not found practicable to
differentiate between first and subsequent treatments under
this plan. No faecal examinations were made prior to
treatment and examinations following treatment were not
advocated . The 1651 examinations in New Guinea, with 794,
48.1 percent, hookworm infections, were made duringtests of
treatment methods and are of no significance as far as
general infection rate is concerned.
The policy of mass treatments has been in force in
these two territories for three years and so far no information
as to results is available. It would seem wise to urge that
re-surveys of representative groups of natives be attenpted
short fy. The mass treatment plan, without proper regulation
by means of periodical resurveys, becanes a shot-gun method
with no adequate scientific foundation and, if the plan is
to have its maximum effect with a minimum of needless expense,
resurveys are essential. Since the original surveys of
these territories, egg-count ing methods have been elaborated
for estimating the intensity of hookwoim infection. The
application of these methods would probably allow of
considerable change in the present mass treatment schane,
so that treatments amongst d ifferent groups could be
regulated by the intensity of their infection. The inform-
ation attainable by resurveys, especially when egg-counting
methods are enployed, is well worth the effort and expense
necessary.
5. Northern Territory.
Following the original survey of Northern Territory
(see page 19), permanent control work was carried on for
the Australian Hookworm Campaign by the local representative
of the Commonwealth Department of Health, the Quarantine
Officer. He examined 129 persons and found 57 to.be
infected; 77 treatments were given. This was inadequate
for control operations. The hookwoim infection of Northern
Territoiy is mostly smongst the aborigines resident in or
visitors to the northern coastal portion and the adjacent •
islands. A policy of mass treatments could be instituted
in this area with benefit. Many aborigines spend part of
the year near Darwin and others are in intermittent contact
with stations or police. A supply of drugs maintained at
central points and used by responsible persons for the
treatment of all aborigines with whom they are in contact
would be probably the most efficient way to meet the situation
as it exists at present. The infection rate is high enough
to justify treatment without previous examination and results
in the health of the aborigines would undoubtedly be worth
the effort.

6» Mew South Vales.
The results of the original surveys of New South Valee
W6re given in Table 6. These surveys demonstrated that
the endemic hookwom area of this State was confined to a
coastal strip, approximately 60 miles wide, extending from
the Tweed River in the north to the level of Taree and tbe
Manning River in the south. It was over this Northern
Rivers District that control operations by t,».e school survey
method were undertaken during the first six months of 1923.
The budget available for work in this district was never
sufficient to allow as complete control operations to be
undertaten as were required by the nature of the problem.
Table 20 gives the results of the 1923 resurvey of the
Northern Rivers District of New South Vales.
Table 20» Results of 1923 Permanent Control Operations
in the Ibidemic Hookworm Area of New South
Vales.
The resurvey examined 15,330 children in schools of
this district and found 551 infected with hookworms, an
incidence rate of 3.6 percent. The use of Dr. Sawyer's
factor, 0,5‘1, to multiply the infection rate of the school
children gives a hookwonr. index of 2.0 for the entire
population of the district. The highest rate for the
district was found in the Bellinger-Hambucca area with the
Twoed-Byron Bay Area, next to the Queensland "border, second.


These two areas, if the time ard money are available,
would profit by intensive control operations but they could
probably be controlled, less rapidly it is true, by a
continuance of school survey methods. Since something
over half of the hookworm infection in any district is in the
school children, the examination and treatment of this group
will have a great effect on the total infection. If the
school surveys also cover the families of infected children
the control attained will te even greater. The 1175
persons in the miscellaneous group of Table 10 were members
of families of infected children; the high rate of infect-
ion in this selected group demonstrates how much of the
hookworm infection of ary area is included in the school
children and their immediate families. Control measures
which reach this group will almost surely result in adequate
control of the infection in the district.
The 1923 resurvey examined 579 aborigines and f cund
334 infected, an inciderce rate of 59.4 percent. These
aborigines were resident in the Tweed-Byron Bay Area or
else in organized camps in other parts of tbe district.
At the close of the survey carbon tetrachloride for mass
treatment of this group was supplied to the Director-
General of Health for hew South Wales. He undertook,
through the Aboriginal Protection Board, to treat all
available aborigines at least once a year. Such mass
treatments are fully justifiable ard should be carried
out. The matter of improved sanitation is a thorny one
when dealing with aborigines and the quick reduction of
their infection, with consequent reduction of soil
infection, is the most rapid and economical method of
attaining any degree of control over their hookworm infection.
7. Queensland.
The endemic hookworm areas of Queensland were outlined
on page 21 of this report. During the original survey
of Queensland these areas were divided into districts with
similar conditions and usually centering on a town or city.
The results of the permanent control operations will be
considered by these districts; aborigina 1 settlements,
institutions and the likewill be considered separately
after the discussion of the districts.
Cooktown District.
The most northerly of the definite districts of
Queensland, in which intensive survey operat ions were
carried on, was the Cooktown District. This district
comprises the town of Cooktown and the surrounding settlemaits
as far south as the Daintree River and as far west as laura.

Some work was reported from this district by the Queensland
Hookwoim Canpaign, 1910 to 1919, but the original survey
by the Australian Hookworm Canpaign was not completed until
1922. The original work was done by the intensive method
and the resurvey in 1923, July 25 to August 29, used the same
method. The data for the district are given in Table 21.
The survey of the Queensland Hookworm Campaign used the
centrifpge method of diagnosis while the two later surveys
used the more delicate Willis method.
Table 21. Results of Origins 1 Surveys and Intensive
Control Operations in the Cooktown District.
The original work of the Queensland Hookworm Canpaign
was probably confined to Cooktown where the infection rate
ie the lowest of the district. The variations in the
percentages of infection between the two last sarvays are
probably of no great significance; slight changes area
boundaries which allowed the inclusion of one or more heavily
infected families in one area at the expense of another would
make considerable variations in percentage when the numbers
examined are as small as they are The important point
is that the hookworm index fell fron 'SS.? in 1922 to 23.9 in
1923, a reduction of 29.0 percent. The district'is one
which is losing population as it is in the midst of a mining
slump and a change to agricultural pursuits. Further control
work should be attenpted throughout the district end by the
intensive method. Sanitation in the district is primitive
and should receive much attention frcm control units.
The Cape Bedford Mission Station, for aborigines, is
in this district. In 1910-19, 75 aborigines out of 115
examined were infected with hookworms, 65.2 percent; in 1922,
142 aborigines were examined and 66 found infected, 46.5 percent.
In 1923, 197 received mass treatment and arrangements we re made
to give such treatments at six months intervals; drugs were
sent from Central Office for this purpose. The next control
operations in this district should show a materially reduced
percentage of infection amorgst these aborigines.

Port-Douglas-Mossman District.
This district centers on the toms of Port Douglas
and Moseman and has the same boundaries as the Douglas
Shire. V/ork in this district during 1910 and 1919 was
reported by the Queensland Hookworm Campaign; the original
survey by the Australian Hookworm Campaign was completed
in 1922 (See Completed Area Report Ho. 13, Australian Hookworm
Campaign). Both this survey and the castrol operations
of 1923 used the intensive method. The results of all
surveys are given in Table 22.
Table 22. Results of Original Surveys and Intensive
Control Operations in the Port Douglas-
Mossman District.
Th© hookworm index of the Port Douglas-Mossmen District
came down frcm 18.4 in 1922 to 14.6 in 1923, in spite of a
considerable increase in infection in Port Douglas itself and
in the Mowbray Area. This district has a high rainfall and
is largely an agricultural district with consequent poor
sanitation. Successive intensive surveys will be necessary
to establish better and more permanent control of the hodkworm
index.

Cairns District.
The Cairns District centers on the city of Cairns
and extends along the railway to Kareeba and the adjacent
country. Considerable work was done in Cairns itself
by the Queensland Hookworm Campaign. . The Australian Hookworm
Campaign completed its original survey in 1922 and conducted
intensive control operations towards the end of 1923 (see
Completed Area Report No. IG, Australian Hookworm Canpaign).
Table 23 gives the rdsults of the various surveys of the
district.
Table 23. Results of Original Surveys and Intensive
Control Operations in the Cairns District
of North Queensland.
The Cairns District had a hootovorm index of 6.1 in 1923,
a considerable reduction frcm the 12.7 index established by
the original survey by the Australian Hookworm Campaign. The
lowest index was in the Jlareeba area an? it seems probable that
this area can be adequateV controlled in the future by school
survey methods’. The city of Cairns has shown considerable
sanitary improvement and it might be possible to institute
school survey methods there, tut it seemt. wisest to recommend
at least one more intensive survey of tho d ty and the
adjoining rural areas. The years covered by these surveys
wore drought years and the coming of wetter years may cause
an increase in the hookworm index. One more intensive survey
of Cairns city should reduce the index there enough so that
school surveys would give adequate control thereafter.


There are two - aboriginal missions in this district,
the Yarrabah Mission and the Mona Mona Mission. In 1917-1910
the Queensland Hookworm Canpaign found that 89.5 percent of
391 aborigines in these two missions were infected with
hookworms. In 1921 a survey found 394 aborigines infected out
of 465 examined, 04.7 percent. After treatment the rate of
the Yarrabah Mission was found to be 50.0 percent in 1922.
During 1923 mass treatments were given at these two missions
and thereafter drtgs were sent frcm Central Office to give
such treatments at six months intervals. These treatments
should undoubtedly be continued until another opportunity
arises fortesting their effect in reducing the hookworm index.
Athertcn and Evelyn Tablelands.
The Atherton and E«elyn Tablelands are here considered
as one d istrict. They are west from Caims and have Atherton
and Herberton as their largest twais. The population is
increasing, most of the increase caning frcm endemic hookworm
areas on the coast, and is carrying infection into a fertile
agricultural district which is likely to assume considerable
importance in North Queens land . The Queensland Hookworm
Campaign examined 194 persons frcm the tablelands and found
32, 16.5 percent, infected with hookworms. The original
survey by the Australian Hookworm Campaign was made in two
periods, one in 1921 and one in 1922. During these two
periods 5532 people were examined and 269 were found infected,
4»9 percent. This original survey was not done on a straight
out intensive basis so the percentage given can not be taken
as the hookworm index (see Completed Area Report No. 17,
Australian Hookworm Campaign). This survey established the
district as an endemic one and demonstrated that Herberton was
not included in the erdemic area. This town has many boarding
schools and all the infection found there was imported from
coastal areas.
When control operations were attenpted in 1923, the
district was divided according to the results of the original
survey and part was done and part by school survey,
with unfortunate results as far as definite information was
concerned. In both the intensive and school survey areas,
the resurvey examined 3166 persons and found 252 infected ’
with hookworms, a rate of 7.9 percent which, again, cannot be
taken as the hookworm index of the district.
No definite conclusions as to the hookworm history
of this district can be drawn fran these surveys. It seems
probable that there was sane increase in the hookworm infection
rate between the two surveys, possibly due to the arrival of
heavily infected families fron coastal areas. It would seem
wise to make an intensive survey of the whole district when
the next control operations are undertaken.

A small amount of indigenous hookworm infection war
demonstrated in the Herberton-Chillagoe district and in the
towns along the railway as far west as Georgetown, by th-j
original survey of 1922 (See Survey Report Eos. 22 and 2t,
Australian Hookworm Campaign). No resuiveys of these
dj stricts were made previous, to September, 1924, as tim? aid
Staff were not available aid as the hookworm index was low,
Sapid school surveys at intervals of two or three years should
be sufficient for control purposes. During these surveys
the miners of the lit. Mulligan mine should receive inten-.ive
Attention. A great deal of the ho ok wo rm infection amongst
these miners was imported, tut some was locally acquired#
ftablnda-Gordonvale District.
The Babinda-Gordonvale District is made up of the
Cairns Shire; the municipality of Calms is not included
in this district. T/ork in S his shire was reported by tl»
Queensland Hookwotm Campaign: the Australian Hookvo m Ca.tpaign
made a survey in 1921 and carried on intensive control operatiora
during 1923 (see Completed Area Report Ho. 12, Australian
Hookworm Campaign). Table 24 gives the results of the
successive intensive surveys of this district.

The Cairns Shire is a cone growing district end its
population is largefy engaged in agriculture. During the
interval between the last two visits to the shire, it suffered from
a comparative drought which possibly had something to do with
the reduction in hookworm index. The sanitary conditions of
the shire are poor and their improvement needs a great deal of
emphasis in future work. Intensive control operations should
be continued in this shire until the hookwom index is consider-
ably lower.
Innisfail District.
The Innisfail District is made up by the Johnstone
Shire, with the town of Innisfail as the center. Th e Queens land
Hookworm Campaign reported work from this district end the
original survey by the Australian Hookworm Canpaign was made
during 1921 and 1922 (see Completed Area Report Ko. 14, Australian
Hookworm Canpe Ign). Intensive control operations were carried
out during 1923. The results of this work are given in Table
25.
Table 25. Results of Original Surveys and Intensive Control
Operations in the Innisfail District.
In the Johnston Shire, again, a large reduction in
hookworm index was demonstrated by the intensive control operations.
The drought of 1921 and onwards was much felt in this district and
may have accounted for some of the reduction by making conditions
for development of hookworm larvae more unfavorable than usual.
It is probable, however, that future surveys will still show a
marked reduction froi the indices of the original surveys.
This Shire has a considerable foreign population, mainly Italian,
and the ouestion of improvement in sanitation is a difficult one*

Gains in control of the hookworm index will be lost unless
proper anphasis can be placed on the prevention of soil
pollution, and the population in general can be made to realize
the importance of this phase of the problem of hookworm control.
Intensive control operations should be continued in this district,
Cardwell District.
The inhabited part of Cardwell Shire between the
Main Coastal Range and the sea is included in the Cardwell
District; Cardwell is the principal settlement. The
population of this district is small and scattered along the
coastal portions. The Queens laid Hookworm Campaign reported
the highest infection rate of the north coast from this district,
a rate which the original survey by the Australian Hookworm
Campaign in 1920 showed to have been considerably reduced
(see Completed Area Report to. 8, Australian Hookworm Campaign).
Intensive control operations were carried out during May, 1923.
Table 26 lists the results of the work in this district.
Table 26. Results of Original Surveys and Intensive
Control Operations in the Cardwell District.
The reduction in hookworm index between the last two
suu-'eys was not as great as in some of the districts previously
discussed. In this connection it should he noted that the
interval between these two surveys was about two and one half
years whereas the districts previously discussed had intervals
between surveys of approximately one year. The time between
control operations in aity district is undoubtedly a factor in
the reduction of hookworm indices. Such operations, if possible,
should be undertaken at least once yearly. Future work should
be along intensive lines.

Ingham District.
The Inghan District practically coincides with the
Hinchiribrook Shire, with Ingham as the main center of
population. This district is also a cane growing area and
has a considerable foreign element, mainly Italian. The
Queensland Hookworm Campaign worked here in 1916 and 1919 and
the original survey of the Australian Hookworm Campaign was
made in 1920 and 1921. (See Completed Area Report ITo. 7,
Australian Hookworm Campaign). Intensive control operations
were conducted during the second quarter of 1923. Table 27
gives a suamary of the results of these surveys.
Table 27. Results of Original Surveys and Intensive
Control Operations in the Irgham District
(See June, 1923, Monthly Report).
The greatest reduction in hookworm index in this
district was-»between the 1916-1919 end 1920 surveys; the
Indices for the last two surveys were practically identical.
*he interval between these surveys was similar to that in the
Cardwell District and undoubtedly had sar.e effect in preventing
reduction of the hookworm index. There would seem to have
been, also, a considerable increase in population. In other
districts intensive contrclooperations found it impossible to
equal the number of examinations made during original survey;
this was due to increasing lack of interest in the work of the
Canpaign on the part of people previously found not infected
and also to the fact that the time spent in the district was
kept to a minimum. In the Ingham District the 1923 work *
examined a few more people than the 1920 survey; this increase
probably represented s fairly large increase in total population,
an increase ccmirg from other endemic districts, non-endemic
parts of Australia and from overseas. These people almost
surely brought hookwoim infection with them and also lived in
primitive conditions favouring the acquiring of infection.
Future intensive control operations will need to lay great
emphasis on sanitation and the prevention of soil pollution.
Intervals between operations should be made as short as possible.

Townsville. Bov.en. Ayr aid Dirtri cte.
The Townsville, Bowen, Ayr and Ratenewood Districts
are made.up by the Thuringowa, Ayr, and Raver swood Shires,
the coastal portion of the V/angaratta Shire, -he city of
Townsville and the towns of Bowen, Ayr and Charters Towers.
The Proserpine Shire, south of Bowen, was originally in the
Bowen District but was later put in the Macksy District,
with which its hookworm conditions classified it. The
Palm Islands Aboriginal Settlement is considered in the
Townsville District. These districts lie in a belt of low
rainfall and were consequently never heavily endemio. Some
work was reported fron Townsville and Charters Towers by
the Queensland Hookworm Campaign tut the original surveys of
the remaining places were made by the Australian Hookworm .
Campaign in 1919, 1920 end 1921 (See Completed Area Reports
Nos. 1,5, 6 and 9 and Survey Reports Nos. 13 (for Charters
Towers), end 10, Australian Hookworm Campaign). The results
of surveys and school control operations made by the Australian
Hookwonn Canpaigi are given in Table 20.
Table 28. Results of Original Survey and School and
Intensive Surveys made by the Australian Hookworm
Canpaign in Districts around Towrsville.f
L
All resurveys were made by school survey methods with
the exception of Pain Islands and the 1923 resurvey of
Thuringowa Shire. Townsville and Charters Towers
were originally surveyed by school survey methods;


Dr. Lanbert, in his report on hookworm work done
during 1918 aid 1919 before the formation of the Australian
Hookwo im Campaign, stated that 2267 school children of
Townsville had been examined and 154 found infected with
hookworms. Thi s was an incidence for school children of 6.8
percent and a hookworm index of 3.9. During 1923, 2623
children were exanined and 86, 3.3 percent, found infected,
a hookworm index of 1.9. The last survey here reported
established an index of 1.5. . The majority of the hookworm
infection in Townsville is in residents of Ross Island,
where the index would undoubtedly be considerably higher than
in residents of the city as a whole, A further intensive
survey should be undertaken on Ross Island. School resurveys
of the remainder of the city at two or three year intervals
should be sufficient to maintain adequate control.
The hookwo rn infection at the Townsville Orphanage
was considered in the October 1923, Monthly Report, where
attention was called to the necessity of sanitary improvement
if hookworm percentages were to be decreased. Dr. Cilento
made certain recommendations for such improvement after his
survey of the Institution in 1923. Some of these recommend-
ations were carried out and the result is shown in the reduced
percentage found at the last survey. The number of children
in the Orphanage has been considerably reduced as more are
being boarded out. In the recent survey of Charters Towers,
seven out of the 31 children found infected had come from the
Townsville Orphanage. The policy of not sending out children
fran this Orphanage until they have been cured of any existing
infection, should undoubtedly be established.
The Ravenswcod Area was intensively surveyed by Dr.
H.H. V/illis in 1920-21 when 972 people were examined and 19
found infected, an index of 2.0. During the present school
resurvey 129 children were examined, with only one infection
fcund, 0.0 percent. This gave a hookworm index of 0.4.
It is not probable that Ravenswood will need any further
control work for seme years.
Charters Towers was surveyed by Dr. Lambert previous
to October 1, 1919. At that time 1017 children were examined
and 53 found infected. All but 26 of these infected children
come fran endemic areas and probably had not acquired their
infection in Charters Of the 31 children found
infected by the survey reported .here, all tut one had come
from endemic areas. School surveys of Charters Towers,
a school center for many endemic areas, would be useful in
finding infections in non-resident children but are not
necessary for residents.

The school surveys of the Boren ar.d Ayr Districts and
the Ihuringova Shire show that conditions remain about the
same as were found by the previous surveys. These areas are
only lightly endemic and can be adequate controlled by school
surveys at two or three year intervals.
the iefrt-s urv ey of thePolm Islands the
system of mass treatments was introduced. One such course
of treatment has been given since the 1923 survey and one was
giv en fc 1 low ing the proceWt survey. The survey found an
infection rate of 24.3 percent, a gratifying reduction from
the 66.2 percent of the previous survey. An examination of
429 persons following a course of mass treatment given during
this- lii'r’ey showed that the 24.3 percent had been further,
reduced to 16.0 percent, as only 72 persons were found infected.
Hack ay District.
The Hack ay District includes the Shires of Proserpine,
Pioneer, Mirani, Sarina, the extreme northern ccastal port ion
of Broodscund S.'ire, (the C-rnila Area), and the city of H-ckay.
The district is a cane-growing area with a moderately high
rainfall. It was originally surveyed by the Australian Hookworm
Campaign in 1919, 1920 and 1921 (See Completed Area Report Fo. 3,
No. 1 for Fro serpine Shire and l’o. 4 for theCarmila Area).
Intensive control operations were carried out in 1922-1923 and
again in 1924; in addition to these operations the Proserpine
Shire had school control operations early in 1923. The results
of the successive operations in this district are listed in Table 29.
f
Table 29. Results of Original Surveys and Intensive
Control Operations in the Kackay District.


The last resurvey of the Mackay District took from
January 21 to May 12, 1924. The Proserpine Shire was
intensively resurveyed during July, 1923. The ether parts
of this district were resurveyed fran November 4, 1922, to
April 4, 1923, and were originally surveyed fron October 10,
1919, to January 31, 1921. The last resurvey was made
during a season when the cane-cutters were not in the district,
while the railway construction gangs had completed their
operations; these two factors explfein sane of the discrepancy
between the various surveys in the figures given for examinations.
Considerable difficulty was experienced also in persuading
people to subnit faecal specimens for examinations and refusals
were frequent. In the Mackay municipality, 55 percent of the
people listed by the census were examined, 49 percent in the
Carmilaarea, 70 percent in the Sarina Shire, 69 percent in
Mirani Shire, 76 percent in Pioneer Shire and 74 percent in
Proserpine Shire. Considerable wet weather retarded the
progress of the survey and made many places very difficult to
reach*
The 1924 resurvey of the Carmila Area gave the highest
hookworm index yet recorded for that area and the last index
for the Sarina Shire was appreciably higher than the 1922-1923
one, although not as high as the original index. It seemed
probable that the small number of examinations in the Carmila
Area were not representative and that the resulting index of
16.8 was a spurious one. This may also have been the case
in the 1922-23 survey'of the Sarina Shire and it seems likely
that the 7»9 index of this survey is more or less correct,
while the 3,7 index was a false one.
The other shires and Mackay City showed a continued
reduction of the hookworm index, most noticeable in the
Proserpine Shire and Mackay City. Considering that Proserpine
Shire has had three intensive surveys and one school survey,
and that the 1923 survey was completed only eisit months
before the last survey, it seemed probable that the 4.3 index
of this survey was correct. The numbers of examinations in
Mackay City were smaller than ever before and the 2.1 index
may not be entirely correct.
There was a reduction in the hookworm index of the
whole district between the last two surveys from 7.0 to 7.2,
an eigfrit percent reduction. This snail reduction was largely
due to the change in findings of the two surveys in the two
areas mentioned first. It seemed probable from these results
that the City of Mackay and the Proserpine Shire might be
controlled by school survey methods; the other shires should
be again intensively resurveyed.

Rockhampton District.
The district around the city of Rockhampton is mostly
in a low rainfall belt and original surveys found no endemic
hookworm areas in the greater part of the district. Certain
parts of the district were, however, mildly endemic and were
resurveyed during 1924 by school and intensive control methods.
(For results of original surveys see Survey Reports Nos. 10,11,
12 and 23, Australian Hookwoim Campaign) Table 30 gives the
results of the resurveys conducted during 1924.
Table 30. Results of Original Surveys and School and
Intensive Control Operations in Parts of the
Rockhampton District.
All of the resurveys of these areas showed an impr,ovem«it
in hookworm index except in 2su Park, where the difference is
so slight, based on one infected person only in each instance,
as to he of no significance. T/ith the exception of the
Sandhills, no further work will need to he dene in thisdistrict
for sone years.


The Sandhills has a large coloured population and
was faind to be a heavy endemic area by the first survey.
On that ai rrey 42,0 percent of the South-Sea Islanders
examined were faind infected, and 4.7 percent of the other
races, mainly whites. During the last survey, 7.6 percent
of 65 whites were infected and only 13.5 percent of 74 coloured.
There has apparently been seme increase of infection amongst
the white residents. The Sandhills should have further
intensive control work. The peninsula to the north of
Rockhampton was not resurveyed,but should receive a school
survey if tte population increases to such an extent as to
warrant it. This area has a higher rainfal 1 than the
remainder of the district.
In the Rockhampton District are certain coal mines,
at Blair Athol the' Styx and Baralaba. On original survey these
mines were not found to have endemic hookworm infection. The
possibility of thei r becoming infected through the importation
of miners fran er.dar.ic areas should be kept in mind.
liar ybor ough Pi stri ct.
The Ilaryborcugh District of the Hookworm Campaign's
work was a lerge one and was originally surveyed frcm three
centers, Bundaberg, I'aryborough and Gympie. The coastal
portion of the di strict, with a moderately high rainfall,
was found to be an endemic hookvo rm area, (see Completed
Resurvey Reports kos. 15 and 16, Australian Hookworm Campaign).
The district includes the Burrun coal mines where the
miners had the highest hookworm infection rate recorded for
any white graip. The Barambah Aboriginal Settlenent was to
the west of this district, in a non-endemic area, but is
included here (see Survey Report Ho. 17, Australian Hookworm
Campaign). Original surveys of the district were made
during 1920, 1921 ani 1922 and school and intensive control
measures were applied during 1924. Table 31 gives the
results of a 11 operations in the Hary , 'orough District*

Table 51. Results of Original Survey ard School and
Intensive Control Operations in the Maryborough
District.


In the areas of the Maryborough District in whi ch
intensive control operations were carried out in 1924, the
original hookworm index of 11*3 was f cund to have teen
reduced to 3.6. Reductions in index in these areas were
such that school control methods will be adequate for future
work in all of them with the exception of Miriam Vale, Y'oocoo
and Rurrum Shires.
A considerable part of the hookworm infection rate
of the Burrun Shire was f curd to be‘in the coal miners of the
area; during the original survey 264 miners were examined and
200 found infected, an incidence of 70. G percent, as against
a rate of 22,0 percent in 3602 persons engaged in other
occupations. The intensive control operations of 1924 .
examined 203 miners ard fcund 20, 13.0 percent, to be infected,
as against 7.4 percent of 2955 persons in other occupations.
The original survey included that part only of the
Calliope Shire which is south of the Boyne River and adjacent
to the Miriam Vale Shire. This part was found to have an
infection rate similar to that of the adjacent shire. The
1924 operations included all of Calliope Shire and found an
index of 1.2. This index may apply to the northern part of
the Shire but probably does not apply to the originally heavily
infected part of Calliope Shire south of the 3oyne River.
This part should have intensive control operations with the
Miriam Vale Shire.
The areas in which school control operations were
carried on a*leo showed considerable reductions in hookworm
index, with the exception of the Perry Shire. The 1924 rate
for this shire was made by three infected children two of than
in one family which had recently moved to the district. All
of these areas can be adequately controlled by school survey
methods and liaryborcugh ard Gympie cities with the Gayndah,
Degilbo and Kilkivan Shires will not need attention for some
two or three years to cane.
The Barambah Aborigine. 1 Settlement had an original
hookworm infection rate of 25.0 percent which had been rpduced
to 4.7 percent by 1923 when intensive control operations were
carried cut. The settlenent is in a low rainfall area and
hookworm infections were probably acquired with difficulty.
The installation of a good nightsoil disposal system added
the requisite touch to the treatment campaign and brought
about this large reduction. One more intensive control
campaign should put the settlement in such a position that
future work would be practically unnecessary, provided sanitary
standards are maintained.

Nambour District.
The Nambour District is made up of the Maroochy,
Landsborough and Caboolture Shires with a snail area to the
west of the first two shires, centering on Maleny. The
district was originally surveyed during 1920 and 1921 by the
Australian Hookworm Canpaign (see Completed Area Report No. 2).
It had intensive control operations in 1923 and school control
operations in 1924. Both the 1923 and 1924 operations in
the Caboolture Area were by school control methods. Table 32
gives the results of original surveys and control operations
in the Nambour District.

Operations in the Kanbour District.
t
T School caitrol method, hookworm index, 0.7.
The 1924 school survey showed a considerable reduction
in hookworm index in the Kambour District. Future control
can be adequateV maintained by school control methods. The
Ilarooehy and landsborough Areas will need more frequavt
attention than the Caboolture Area. In the survey of the
Brisbane District (see Survey Report No. 27, Australian Hookworm
Canpaigi), an extension of the Caboolture Area was suggested.
This extension was made up of the Samford-Petrie Area, of the
Brisbane District. Future surveys of the Caboolture Area
should include the Samford-Petrie Area.

Southport District.
The Southport District originally included the area
between the Logan River in the north and the Hew South bales
border in the 3cuth. To this the Deaudese'rt Area was added—
an area around Beaudesert, south to the border and north to
within a short distance of Brisbane, including the coastal
parts to the north of the Logan River (see Completed Area
Report Ho. 10 and Survey Report Ho. 27, Australian Hookworm
Carrpaign). The original survey of the old Southport District
was made in 1920-1921 and school control operations were
carried on during 1922 and 1924; the Beaudesert Area was
originally surveyed in 1922 and school control operations were
conducted in 1924. Table 33 given the results of all
operations in the whole district.
Table 23. [Results of Original Survey and School
Control Operations in the Southport District.
The hookwonn index of the Southport District was found to
have teen reduced to 0.0 in 1924. The indices of the areas
of the district were all lower or the same as this, with the
exception of the Coolangatta Area vdiere the index was 2.2.
This area should have another school control survey within a
year if possible; the other areas can be adenuately controlled
by school control methods at intervals of tv?o years or more.
Special Control Operations.
The Brisbane District had local endemic foci of
hookworm infection which had special control operations.
These foci were in the Ipswich coal mines, in the Hospitals
for the Insane, and on Stradbroke Island.


The Ip&vich coalminers were originally surveyed in
1921-1922 when 1030 miners were examined ond 524 ?/ere found
to he infected, an incidence rate of 31.5 percent. At that
time (see Completed Area Report Ho. 11), it was shown that
miners acquired their infection in the mines and that the
surface was free of endemic infection. In 1923 another
survey of miners wae undertaken and 53G were examined with
33 found infected, 6.1 percent. Just before the close of the
work o f the Australian Hookworm Campaign it was found possible
to devote a week to a rapid survey; during this time 172
miners we re examined and 4, 2.3 percent, were found infected.
Sanitary improvement has takai place in the mines and the
reduction in hookworm infection is probably largo, although
the figures for the control operations are too small for
definite conclusions. At least one more intensive survey
of the miners should be undertaken. Miners as a class are
difficult to deal with and considerable time an? effort .
will be necessary to make results thoroughly representative.
The Hospitalsfor the Insane at Goodna, Sandy Gallop
and V/illowburn we re first surveyed in 1922. At that time
all three institutions were found to be endemic hookworm
foci in a non-endemic region; the infection at Goodna and
Sandy Gallop was found to be large iy with Ancylo stoma
duodenale in distinction to the predominant I%'ecator americanus
infection of the rest o f Queens land. Control operations were
carried on at Goodna and Sandy Gallop but not at V/illowburn.
Infection rates at both the former institutions were found to
be considerably reduced and all measures taken gave premise of
rapid control of the infection. Recommendations were made
that all incoming and outgoirg patients, and those transferred,
should be examined and treated if necessary; that all patients
should be kept in boots as much as possible and that soil
pollution should be reduced to a minimum by strict watchfulness.
It would seem that the problem of control of infection in these
institutions should be assumed by the staff. The appointment
of one or two attendants whose sole work would be in examination
of patients would make thorough yearly control operations in
all three institutions possible. Such methods would prpbably
not need to be continued for more than two years when reduction
in effort would be justifiable. Failing such a solution of
the problem, assistance in such yearly control plans should
be rendered by the new Hookworm Campaign or by the Commonwealth
or State health laboratories. The more satisfactory method
would be the first suggested.


Stradbroke Island has two hookworm problems, one
at the Benevolent Asylum at Dunwich and one amongst the
aborigines resident on the island. There has been some
reduction in the infection rate of the institution at Dunwich
and future work there will be necessary only at intervals;
another intensive survey of the institution in 1925 should
be attempted. The aborigines of the island were heavily
infected originally and the index, at successive surveys hae
shown a tendency to return to or exceed the original rate*
The institution of mass treatments would undoubtedly be-the
most effective way of controlling the infection in this group.
The control of hookworm infection amongst the aborigines
resident in settlements in the districts listed hae been
discussed. Certain other aboriginal groups need sene attention.
The original survey of the Taroom Aboriginal Settlement in
dry s cutbwestern Queens land demonstrated a small amount of
locally acquired infection. The low rainfall v/i 11 probably
prevent the problem beconing serious but an effort should&e
made to verify the findings of the original survey. This
might be done by the sending of faecal specimens, during the
winter season, to the Toowoomba Health laboratory and the
treatment frem there of the few who might be found infected.
The. Cape York Peninsula has a considerable population
of migratory aborigines. Certain stations in the area and
missions along the coast line serve as concentration points
for these blacks. The Australian Hookworm Campaign, after
original surveys.had demonstrated high infection rates, kept
the mission stations supplied with drugs for mass treatments
at six month intervals; these drugs were sent through the
Thursday Island office. The most important missions were the
ones at Weipa, Aurukun, Maroon, Xowan Yama and Mornington
Island. Several stations on islands in the Torres Straits
should also be supplied with drugs. An effort should be
made to reach the migratory blacks through the Aborigines
Protection Board, the Police or aagency in some contact
with them. Mass treatments should be administered to all
aborigines resident in the Peninsula and cculd be given to
the sparse white population with advantage (see Survey Report
Eo. 29, Australian Hookworm Campaign).




V. THE REDUCTION OF WOODWORK INFECTION
IN QUEENSLAND.
I. General Reduction in Kookwoim Infection in Queensland.
The hookworm infection in Queensland establidied by the
original surveys of the Australian Hookworm Campaign was 10.7
percent of all persons examined when certain patients in
endemic institutions and ooal miners were not included, and
11. percent when these endemic sources of infection were
included (see Table 7). The U3e of varying methods of control
in the endemic areas made it difficult to draw definite
conclusions as to the reduction in infection following the
work accomplished. The results of school control methods
could not be included with the results cf intensive methods
to arrive at an infection rate and it was necessary to draw
conclusions by averaging the pa - cent age of reduction of hookworm
indices. From all the figures available, it seemed probable
that the work of the Australian Hookworm Campaign resulted in
a reduction of approximately 64 percent in the hookworm infection
rate. That is, where there were 100 persons infected with
hookworms in 1919 there were only 36 infected on September 30,
1924, and the rate of infection for endemic areas was reduced
from 10.7 to 3.9 and the rate for all endemic sources from 11.1
to 4.0. The reduction was greater in the institutions and in
the coal miners than it was amongst the general population of
the endemic areas and so many other factors affected the reduction
rates that the estimate of a general reduction of 64 percent
could net be definitely verified; it wculd seem probable,
however, that, it was tco low an estimate rather than an error
in the other direction.
The general reduction of 64 percent in the hookworm
infection rate in Queensland was the result of various
methods cf work and various other factors. All of the
endemic areas had two surveys, some had three and one had
four; some had intensive control work an? seme had school
control. In the endemic hookworm infection districts as
established by the Australian Hookworm Campaign, the original
survey was responsible for a reduction, on the average, of
40 percent in the infection rate; the first control v'ork»in
the di strict was responsible for a further reduction of
approximately 31 percent. On the basis of these average
reductions in iidex, the third survey should show a further
reduction of approx inatety 24 percent and the fourth survey
about 19 percent. These are general averages for all
districts, all conditions in the district and all methods of
work and will not apply very closely to any specific district

with a specific method of work. The only distriot from
which the results of throe successive campaigns are known,
is the Proserpine Area of the Ilackay District. It was
originally intensively surveyed, then had school control work
early in 1923, intensive cort rol work later in 1923 end
another intensive campaigi in 1924. The figures for this
area, are given in Table 34.
Table 54. Results of Successive Control Campaigns
in the Proserpine 3hire of Queensland.
The original intensive survey reduced the hookv©rm
index from 13.-? to C. 6, a reduction of 37 percent or about
the average reduction for first surveys mentioned in the
preceding paragraph. The second survey, by school control,
found an index of G. 6 and was responsible for a
reduction in index to 6.9, a reduction of 20 percent.
According to the estimates given above, the second survey
should reduce the percentage incidence by 31 percent. V/hen
it i s remembered that this second survey was by sohool control
methods which do not reduce indices as much as intensive methods,
the 20 percent reduction of this second survey is what could be
expected. The third survey established the 6.9 index and was
responsible, as shown by the fourth survey, for a reductioh in
hookworm index to 4.3, a reduction of 3t> percent. This is a
high reduction rate when the index is as low to begin with as
6.9, as is shown by other districts resurveyed, and it seemß
probable that the 24 percent estimated above will be nearer the
average reduction produced by.third surveys.


The following estimates are what may be expected of
future work. The estimates are averages for dl districts
and all methods and variations will be considerable.
The original survey - 40 percent reduction in index
First ccntrol survey - 31 percent reduction in index
Seoond control survey- 24 percent reduction in index
Third control survey - 17 percent reduction in index
The original ard first control surveys made a total
reduction in hookwoim index of 60 percent; the second control
survey should leave the index 70 percent be lev/ its original
mark and the fourth survey, 73 percent belGw. It will not be
possible to entirely eradicate hookworm infection by the present
control methods as the estimated reductions given above indicate*
It is, however, aitirely possible to reduce the rate, by ■
repeated surveys, to a point at which the harmful effects are
reduced to a minimum.
2. Certain Factors Influencing Reduction Rates.
Reduction in hookworm indices was greater in the larger
towns of the endemic districts than in the rural areas. The
towns had a reduction of 66 percent as against a reduction of
45 percent for the rural areas. This would seem to be a
direct effect of the better sanitation of the towns acting by
reducing the infection rate.
The reduction rate was also higher in areas of comparatively
low rainfall; the reduction rate in the endemic areas of the
north with annual rainfall was about 44 percent on an
average, while the reduction rate of the southern endemic
districts where the annual rainfall vvas somewhat lower averaged
about 50 percent. The State of Queensland suffered from a
drought for the years during which the Hookworm Campaign worked,
with the exception of the first and the last. This drought
reduced the rainfalls of the northern endemic areas considerably
but in no instance was the reduction large enough to stop the
possibility of re-infection and new infection. However, if
variations even in high rainfalls are reflected in the hookworm
index, as has been previously suggested, and if reduction rates
also reflect rainfall conditions as was just described, it would
seem that tha comparative drought must have had considerable
effect in maintaining the lowered indices produced by treatment
campaigns. In seven of the northern districts in which the
figures for annual rainfall were available, the drought reduced
the rainfall during 1921 and 1922 by 37.8 percent, varying from
52.0 percent to 21.0 percent; during this same time the hookworm
indices of these same districts were reduced an average of
36.6 percent, with variations fran 57.1 percent to 1.5 percent.

Gslton's coefficient of correlation for the two set 3 of
reduction percentages was 0.76 + 0.11 (see '.Vhipmle'e Vital
Statistics for method U9eo). There would seem to have Veen
an appreciable effect of the drought on the hookworm index,
and the return to the übubl rainfall may bo responsible for
an increase in infection and reinfection and a consequent
decrease in reduction of hookworm indices.
The prevention of soil pollution is of supreme importance
in reducing hockworm indices and in maintaining the reduction
attained. This phase of the question of control will be
considered in the next section of this report.
3. Reduction of Ho ok wo wn Infection in A-,e Groura.
The following table, Do. 35, shows the percentage
incidence of hookworm infection by ago groups found in 1919-1921
and in 1924 and gives the percentage reductions in these
percentages between the tv.o surveys in the lirckay District.
Only the three shireß of Sarira, Jlirani and Pioneer and the City
of Ilackay are included in this table, as they constituted the
’iacka y Di stri ct during the first survey.
Table 35« Age Incidence of Hookworm Infection in. the
1919-1921 and 1924 Surveys of the Packny
District, (exclusive of Proserpine Shi re
and the Csrmila Area.)


The v.ork of the Hookworm Campaign has repeatedly
demonstrated that the children of Australia are the age group
with the highest infection rate. This table demonstrates
that this age group is the one rith the lowest percentage of
improvement, as was to be expected. The children of the bare-
foot age are the most likely group to acquire infection and so
have the highest infection rate. They are consequently the
grcup most likely to be re-infected and would have the lowest
improvsnent rate. In this area the rate for the 19-40 year
grcup improved by 68.0 percent, the 41-60 year group by 64.0
percent, and the grcup over 60 by 91.0 percent—an improvement
rate for the combined adult groups of 69.0 percent. The rates
for the two children's groups improved by 54.0 percent and 40.0
percent. The ors year group, seme of the members of which
would be infants and not easily re-infected, would be expected
to have a higher improvement rate than the 6-18 year group, as
i 3 found to be the case. The hookworm rate for all ages
improved by 51.0 percent as a result of the two intensive
surveys, made in 1919-1921 and 1922-1923.
The Proserpine Shire had an intensive survey in 1919,
a school survey early in 1923, an intensive survey late in 1923
and another intensive survey in 1924. During the school
survey, school children only were examined aid treated. This
shire, then, should show, (1) a higher general improvement rate
than the Haokay Area; (2) a relatively higher improvement rate
in the school ages, 6-18 years, than occurred in the Mackay
Area and (3) the lowest improvement rate in the 0-5 year group
which includes few school children and yet enough active
children to make the re-infection rate higher than it would be
in the adult groups. The Proserpine Shire figures are given
in Table 36.

Table 36. Age Incidence of Hookworm Infection
in the 1919 and 1924 Surveys of the
Proserpine Shire.
The rate for all ages improved by 69.0 percent as
against 51.0 percent for the Mackay Area. The improvements
for the three adult groups were 70.0 percent, 72.0 percent,
and 67.0 percent—an improvement of 71.0 percent-for the
combined adult grcups. The 6-18 year group had the same
improvement rate as the ccmbined adult groups, 71.0 percent,
and the 0-5 year group had the lowest improvement rate, 64.0
percent. The school survey in this shire not only served to
give information as to the hookworm conditions of the Shire,
but also acted as a control factor by greatly increasing the
improvement rate of the 6-18 year age group, the group with
the heaviest infection rate and consequently the one most
likely to spread infection and to acquire re-infection.


4. Reinfection with Hookworms.
The question as to how much re-infection with hookworms
occurs between surveys is of interest. It was not found
possible to classify ary of the results of resurveys in
endenic districts to obtain figures indicative of the re-
infection rate. This was dene, however, with the results
of resurveys of two hospitals for the insane near Brisbane.
In the 1923 survey of these two institutions 1807 patients
were examined and 223 were found infected with hookworms,
a rate of 12,3 percent; in 1924 only 103 out of IGIO
patients examined were feund infected, a rate of 5»7 percent.
The reduction in hookworm infection rate achieved by the
first survey was about 54 percent. Of the 103 persons found
infected in 1924, 76 were new infections, that is were not
found infected in 1923; eleven of the 76 were not examined at
all during 1923 and 65 were found not infected in 1923. The
eleven patients not examined in 1923 may have entered the
institution with an infection or may have acquired it after
their admission, this point could not be settled. Twenty-
seven of the 103 hookworm infected patients of 1924 had been
found infected in 1923 also. The infected patients of 1923
were all treated to a microscopic cure, so it is probable that
the majority of the 27 patients found infected by both surveys
had been reinfected during the interval b etween surveys. The
hookworm infection rate, then, of 1924, 5.7 percent, was due
to new infections, 73.0 percent, and to reinfections, 26.2
percent. It is interesting to note that 196 of the 223 persons
found infected in 1923 were examined again in 1924 and that
169, G 6.2 percent, had remained cured of their infection during
the year.
The major part of the hookworm infection acquired
during the year, then, was in patients not previously
infected and only 26 percent of it was reinfection. It
must be remembered that these institutions have a considerable
degree of control over thei r patients and over the soil
pollution existing, also that they are in a rather low rainfall
area. The application of the figures here recorded to any
of the endemic districts would have to be made with caution*
Hookworm infected persons in the endemic districts are not
necessarily treated to a microscopic cure and there is little
control over soil pollution or personal habits; it would
seem probable that the reinfection rate in the endemic districts
would be considerably higher and the new infection rate correspon
ingly lower.

VI. SANITATION.
1. Total Sanitary Inspections.
The results of the sanitary inspections made by the
Australian Hookworm Canpaign are given in Table 37. The
number of inspections listed as made between October 1,
1919 and December 31, 1922 includes first inspections only;
as the surveys made in 1523 and 1924 covered practically the
same ground in Queen 9 lard as the original sanitary survey,
they may be regarded as second and third inspections.
Table 37. Results of Sanitary Inspections made by
the Australian Hookworm Campaicp.
The standard by which closets were classified varied
during the five years in which the Australian Hookworm Canpaign
made its inspections and was considerably higher for the
inspections of 1923 ard 1924, than for those of the original
survey. In August 1922 the State of Queensland published
regulations whi ch called fora ffy and rodent proof panstead
with the access door in the front inside the closet structure,
with such guides and stops that the pan was held directly
under and within one inch of the seat, and with a self-closing
lid. Thisv/as the standard used for the inspections of the
last two years. In spite of the higher standard, the
inspections showed an improvement in sanitary arrangements.


Uhereas the original survey showed only 15.6 percent of
closets as up to standard, the final inspection listed 25.5
percent as complying with the regulations, an improvement of
63 percent. That much remains to he done, however, is
evidenced hy the fact that only about one quarter of the
premises inspected had standard closets.
There was a decrease in percentage of closets below
standard from C 1.6 percent on original survey to 73.0 percent
in 1924, an improvement in this respect of 11 percent. Any
panstead not fully up to the State regulations was listed
in this category although the defects might not be important
fran the standpoint of the prevention of soil pollution.
The fact that only 2.0 percent of the number of
inspections made revealed that there was no closet
differentiates the sanitation problem in Australia from that existing
In most countries with endemic hookworm disease. There was not,
in Australia, a necessity to introduce latrines and a knowledge
of their use; the problem was rather one of making more rigid
the existing customs and standards. Publicity needed to be
directed to the dangers of existing structures .jnd the necessity
of obviating these dangers and to fostering a sentiment which
would prevent soil pollution outside of closets. The rates
for premises with no closets were practically identical for
the years 1923 and 1924 but there was a total reduction of 39
percent from’the original 2.6 percent rate.
The original sanitary inspections were made by members
of the staffs of the field units of the Hookworm Campaigi
under the direction of Medical Officers. All of the efforts
to improve sanitation were left to the Medical Officers.
Some of thOT did excellent work in this line but the sanitary
part of their work'was more or less a side issue and, from
pressure of their other duties, was relegated to a secondary
position. It was felt that this state of affairs was un-
satisfactory and that a special unit concerned only with sanitary
inspections and efforts to improve sanitation, would be able to
accomplish more. Towards the end of 1922 such a unit was
organized and placed under the control of an engineer, Mr. 17.
Seaborn-Jones. All the sanitary side of the work was attended
to by this unit after it was organised. The experience gained
by this procedure was sufficient to enphasise the fact that
the policy was risit. The whole sanitary side of the work
of a Hookworm Campaign should be in the hands of a competent
authority on the subject whose entire time, with such help as
may be necessary, should be devoted to sanitary inspections,
publicity to improve sanitation and efforts to popularize the
provision of safe closets and the prevention of soil pollution
in the local authority areas. The prevention of soil pollution
is of major importance in the control Of hookworm infection and
all efforts to accomplish this end will be amply justified by
the results.


2. An Enidemiological Classification of Closets.
During 1523 a new oltself icetion of closets was
adopted and used fcr about half of the sanitary inspections
ms.de during that year and for all inspections during 1924.
The original suggestion for a change in classification came
fran F*F. Longley, Internationa 1 Health Beard Adviser in
Sanitary Engineering, Commonwealth Department of Health,
who draw attention to the fact that classifying closets as up
to standard, he low standard, and ahaent gave very little inform-
ation as to the soil-pollution actually existing in any area*
Reosrt research into the problems of hookworm<saeaae and its
control has stressed the importance of eoil-pollutlon as an
epidemiological factor and the collection of information as
to the amount of pollution should he of value in efforts to
oontrol the spread of hookworm infeotion. Such considerations
as these led to the amplification of the three old olasses ■
into five as follows: -
Claes D - as before - premises with closets which
entirely conform to the State regulations as far as the
panstead is concerned.
Class B - premises with closets which are he low the
State regulations and are so defective as to probably
allow soil-pollution.
Class P - premises with no closet accommodation.
Class Q - premises with closets below the State
regulations but which are so constructed as to prevent
soil-pollution.
Class H - premises on which soil-pollution was found at
the time of inspection.
The information obtained by listing the class D premises
world be useful to the State Department of Health for estimating
the activity of the Iccal Authorities in enforcing £he regulations.
Class G would usually indicate that that-the closet was below
standard in seme detail which would not interfere with its
efficiency in preventing soil-pollution, not fly-proof for
example. Classes D, F and H would be the ones of special •
interest to the Hookworm Canpaign, Class H would be used as
an extra class, that is a closet might be in Class D and still
be listed in Claes H if seme member of the family persistently
defaecated outside the closet, The information obtained frem
the last three classes mentioned, 13, F and E, gives a rough
approximation of the amount of eoil-pollution around the housoe
of ary area and should bear seme relation to the hookworm index
of the area. Table 30 gives the results of surveys conducted
under thi s new class! ficat ion.

Table 30. Results of All Sanitary Inspections Hade
under the Epidemiological Classification
of the Australian Hookvorm Canpaign.


By the epidemiological classification 22.0 percent of
all c losets were listed as entirely up to state standard,
20.5 percent of home closets, 34.4 percent of school closets
and 25.8 percent of closets at other buildings. The
classification listed 76.2 percent of all closets as below
standard but only 47.4 percent as below standard to such a
degree as to be probable sources of soil pollution. The
problem represented by the 79.3 percent below standard closets
of Table 37 was reduced considerably by this new classification,
which showed that approximately one third of these closets
were not dangerous as far as hookworm infection was concerned.
The percentage of premi sos with no closet was lowest in the
case of schools and highest in "other buildings" as was to be
expected; the latter class of premises includes business •
buildings, public of f ices and halls , churches end the like;
just under one percent of the homes had no closet of any
kind. The extra classification, soil pollution found at time
of survey, gave the highest percentage among the homes inspected
and the lowest at schools.
The inspections under this new classification made no
attenpt to find incidental soil pollution away from certain
usual places around the closet; the "H" class, then, lists
only obvious pollution in places near the closet which a
quick inspection would find and does not profess to list all
pollution. Soil pollution around a farm or in unf requited
spots would not be classified under these inspections. The
time available for inspections did not peanit of extended
investigations and the classification is weak in this respect.
3. Sanitary Indices.
Certain indices of value were obtained frcm the
results of inspect ions maie under the epideniological
classification. These were aa ibllows.-
1. Privy Index. This index was the percentage of home
closets up to state standard, the percentage of D class
closets ibund at homes. This index wae not of value from an
epidemiological standpoint tut did furnish a rough estimate
of the activity of the local Authority in enforcing the
sanitary regulations.
2, The Fotentia 1 Pollution Index. This index was
made up by the percentage of all closets inspected which
were probably responsible for soil pollution and those
premises v r ith no closet where soil pollution could be
presumed to exist, occasionally at least; that is, the
percentage of all classes and F closets.


3* The Actual Pollution Index. This index was the
percentage of all premises on which soil pollution waa
found during the inspection, the percentage of all class
H premi ses.
4. Combined Pollution Index, The last two indices
mentioned gave a roqgh estimate of the probable and actual
soil pollution around the houses in ary area aid were of
value in relation to the possibilities of acquiring hookworm
infection in that area. To obtain a general index for the
area for comparative purposes, the two indices were combined
to form a Combined Follution Index for the area, the percent-
age of ell of classes 2, F and H premises for the area.
Sanitary inspections were made on the basis of local Authority
areas and the indices applied to shires and municipalities.
Certain of the north Queensland Local Authority areas
had two sanitary inspections under the epidemiological
classification. The sanitary indices for the two surveys
are given in Table 39. The Proserpine Shire is omitted
from this table because of the obvious error in the first
survey. The first Bsnitary inspections were made shortly
after the new classification was adopted and by members of
a medical field unit who had not been trained in the new
methods; when the second inspection was made by the sanitary
•unit the indices ware all much worse than they had been by
-,be first inspection and, as the Proserpine Shire has always
been one of the most active in their efforts to improve
sanitation, the conclusion tl.at the first indices were
erroneous was the best explanation of the discrepancy. It
is hardly fair to an interested and active Local Authority
to publish figures which would be a reflection on their
?anitsry standards when the fault is obviously due to
inexperience of the staff making the inspections.
Hinchinbrook Shire was not resurveyed during 1924.

Table 39. Sanitary Indices of-.theKorth
Queensland Local Authority Areas
where Two Sanitary Surveys were made.
The average privy index of the areas listed in this
table was &»3 in 1923; this had been raised to 23.9 by the
1924 survey, an improvement in index of 180 percent. This
was the highest improvemait rate of the three indices, as
the potential pollution index showed a 15.0 percent improve-
ment and the actual pollution index, 30.0 percent. The
improvemait in the standard of home closets was gratifying,
but much remained to be done as only 24 out of 100 homes
could show a standard closet.
The two pollution indices had low improvement rates
and it was evident, since these two indices express to a
considerable extent the possibility of acouiring hookworm
infection in any area, that more effort is needed to improve
sanitary standards. Most of the emphasis in future work
should undoubtedly be placed on improving the defective
closets and in teaching the people to stop indiscriminate
soil pollution. It is true that the actual pollution
index represents the soil pollution around the houses only,
but it is probable that it also represents the habits of the
people in regard to soil pollution elsewhere. The members
of a household, on the grounds of which actual soil pollution


is found, are the ones most likely to pollute the soil
elsewhere an? methods which will train people to stop soil
pollution around the home will result in diminished soil
pollution away from the home. Future efforts will need to
he aimed at educating the people of the area, as v'e 11 as at

4. Pollution Indices and Hookworm Infection.
If the pollution indices are cf any value in
indicating the amount of soil pollution in an area, they
should hear seme relation to the hookworm index of the area.
As has been previously mentioned, the pollution indices
estimate the probable and actual pollution around the houses
only and do not represent the entire soil pollution of the
area. They also take account of one factor only in the
production of hookwoim infection and variations in rainfall,
barefooted people, occupation and errors in inspection
results would all tend to lower the correlation between
hookworm and pollution indices. The sanitary inspections
were always made on the basis of Local Authority Areas,
while hookworm indices we re not always based on such areas,
so i t was in some instances impossible to obtain indices
representing the same areas. Table 40 gives the hookworm
index and actual, potential and combined pollution indices
for all Loq£ 1 Authority areas where these indices covered
the same areas and in which the hookwoim index was based
on intensive control operations. The indices used are
based on surveys which were obtained at practically the
same time in each area. The areas are divided into three
groups, the first two containing areas as nearly alike as
possible in rainfall and other conditions; all areas in
which sane error in index was probable or in which local
conditi on s m ade it impossible to compare the area with
others, are included in Group 3,

Table 40. Hookworm Indices and Pollution Indices
of Certain Local Authority Areas.


Group 1 contains nine Local Authority Areas of Uorth
Queensland in which intensive control operations were under-
taken at approximately the same time as the pollution indices
were established, during 1923. These areas have a fairly
high annual rainfall with other conditions somewhat similar.
Two shires that belong in this group, Sarina and Proserpine,
have been put in Group 3. Sarina Shire had a hookworm index
of 3.7 in 1923 and 7.4 in 1924; there would seem to have
been an error in the hookworm index of 1923 which makes it
impossible to compare this area with the others. The error
in the original sanitary inspection of Proserpine Shire has
already been mentioned.
Group 2 contains five Local Authority areas of south
Queensland in which intensive control operations were carried
out. These areas have a lower annual rainfall than the ones
in Group 1 and somewhat different conditions 6f occupation, etc.
They had all had one previous intensive survey whereas the
areas of Group 1 had had two such surveys previous to the one
which established the hookwolrm index used. The last four
areas of Group 3 belong with those in Group 2. In the
V/oongarra, Gooburrum and Miriam Vale shires so few sanitary
inspections were made that the pollution indices were not
representative and they were consequently not included in
Group 2. The hookworm index of the Burrum Shire, 7. 4,
includes heavily infected coalminers resident in the shire;
11.3 percent of the persons infected with hookworms at the last
survey were miners and it i s probable that this fact explains
most of the discrepancy between the pollution indices and
hookworm index in this shire as compared with the areas in
Group 2. The low pollution rate of this shire i s not reflect-
ed in a low hookworm rate because of the presence of members
of an occupation who acquire most of their hookworm infection
in the mines, the pollution of which is not represented in the
pollution index of the shire.
The relation between the pollution indi ces and the
hookworm index maybe shown by Galton's coefficient of
correlation, (see V/hipple's Vital Statistics). Perfect
correlation gives s coefficient of 1.0 and the coefficient should
be at least six times the error. The coefficients of correlation
for Groups 1 and 2of Table 40 are as follows; the coefficient
for the two groups combined show no correlation to exist.

Hookworm Index and Potential Pollution Index- 0.97 ± 0.02
Hookworm Index and Combined Pollution Index - 0.07 4- 0.07
There is a definite correlation between the hookworm index
and the potential pollution index in both groups, considerably
greater in Group 2 than in Group 1. Correlation between the
combined pollution index and the hookwom index is found in
Grcup 2 but is problematic a. 1 in Group 1; the correlation in
Group 1 may be classed as slight. There is no correlation in
either group between the hookworm index and the actual pollution
index. Considering all the sources of error and the variations
in other conditions, the correlation between the potential
pollution and the hookworm infection i s pronounced, and constitutes
a clear demonstration of the necessity of sanitary improvement
if the acquiring of hookworm infection is to be controlled. The
pollution index is one of the important variables in the production
of the hookworm index which it i s entirely possible for a community
to control and its control will have a very considerable effect
on the reduction of the amount of hookworm infection in the
community.
The fact that the potential pollution index shows a
correlation with the hookworm index while the actual pollution
index does nbt, may be of sane significance. There are many
more factors to render the actual pollution index less
representative than the potentie 1 index and, as has been stated
before, the actual index does not pretend to measure any
pollution except that existing in certain usual places around
the closet and yard. Certainly on the basis cf the figures
here reported the most fruitful source of hookworm infection
would seon to be the defective closet and the elimination of
such closets would seem to be of greatest importance an the
sanitary problem. bo method of estimating the incidental soil
pollution awry from the home and closet was devised by the
Hookworm Campaign; to arrive at such an estimate v/puld be a
matter of considerable time and expense but might be well worth
while in still more clearly showing the-source of the hookworm
infection. Some work on the effects of such incidental
pollution in producing infection should certainly be undertaken.
This investigation would probably have to be made on certain
small areas, well defined, which should be as representative as
possible of all conditions of rainfall, temperature, habits of
the people, occupation? etc- The work here reported emphasizes
the importance of the eanitary aspect of the problem and
particularly the question of the standard of the closet;


further work would probably not decrease the importance of
this aspect of the question of control end would undoubtedly
give greater prominence to the incidental pollution than it has
at present, although it seems likely that the most fertile source
of infection in Australia is the defective closet.
There are many variations in relations between the
pollution and hookworm indices of the areas in both groups.
These variation? are probably duo to variations in the other
factors determining the hookvo rm index of any area such as
rainfall, barefootodness, occupation and possibly as yet
unrecognised factors. An instance of this is seen in thy
Eurrum Shire already mentioned. Another instance is found
in the shire? with a rainfall in the neighborhood of 45
inchee where hookwom infection is maintained with difficulty
only; these shires had usually very high pollution indices
which could not result in high hookworm indices because of the
lack of adequate moisture.
A factor which seems likely to have affected the
correlations between indices is preceding treatment campaigns.
A treatment campaign which resulted in any considerable
percentage of euros but did not result in much improvement in
sanitation would cause a lack of correlation in the indices
for sane time or until the pollution existing had been given
time to produce again its maximum hookworm infection. It
seems probably that the greater correlation in Group 2 of
Table 40 is due to this fact; the areas of this group had had
only one previous treatment carrpaign while those of Group 1
had two. If this is true, the correlation between pollution
and hookworm infection in untreated districts would be very
high and successive treatment campaigns would tend to lower the
correlation, since the ir.d ices would probably not improve equally
The correlation could be maintained, and consequently the
reduction in hookworm index produced by treatment would be
maintained, by making special efforts either before or with the
treatment carrpaign to eliminate the defective closet and to stop
the incidental soil pollution.

VII. CREATION OF HOOKWORM INFECTION.
1. Tota 1 Treatmente.
Treatments were administered to all possible persons
found infected with hookworms and in parts of Australia and in
Papua and Hew Guinea to all persons available, with no previous
examination. In the case of mass treatments it was not found
possible to keep a record as to previous treatments so that the
number listed does not necessarily mean fi ret treatments; the
number of treatments following examination gives first treatments
only and corresponds to the number of persons treated. Table 41
lists all treatments given ly hookworm carrpai gas in Australia
and its dependencies with the exception of Dr. Y/aite’s original
survey of Papua in 1917 for which no record of treatments given
was found. The table is divided on a time basis which does
not strictly correspond to the division of work into original
surveys and centre 1 surveys.
Table 41. All Treatments Given for Hookworm Infection
in Australia and its Dependencies.
The Queensland Hookworm Carrpaign (1916-1919) found 4605
persons infected wi th hookworms and gave at least one treatment
to 4569, that is 99.6 percent of those found infected. As far
as the records show the additional 664 treatments were mass
treatments and not retreatments . The total treatments given
during this period were 5273.


Turing the first three years n:‘C three months of the
work of the Australian Hookv/orm Campaign, mainly occupied by
original surveys, 4C965 persons were found to be infected with
hookwoms. As accurately as can be determined from the records
existing, 36046 of these persons received at least one treatment,
75.2 percent, and 61351 mass treatnaits were given, in addition,
to natives of Papua, and New Guinea. The persons not treated
were either m edi cally unfit, or lost track of, died, or else
refused treatment; records do not clearly differentiate the
various causes operative and the largest class not treated
are listed as "not classified". During the original intensive
surveys at least two treatments were given to practically all
infected persons treated and many had subsequent treatments
as the policy of treatment to cure was largely operative;-
approximately 27,345 treatments subsequent to the first were
given.
During 1923 and the first nine months of 1924 a high
percentage of persons fcurd infected were given first treatment,
96.4 and 96.9 respectively. There were 196,711 mass treatments
given of which 1564 -were in Australia and the remainder in
Papua and Few Guinea. In reality a considerably larger number
of mass treatments were given during these years as this report
does not include such treatments given by the staffs of missions,
and by the Governments, to aborigines in Australia; these
figures were not reported to the Hookworm Campaign unless the
treatments were actually given ty a member of the staff of the
campaign. The policy of treatment to cure was abandoned towards
the end of 1922 and only 621 retreatments were reported during
the last 21 months of work.
The Australian Hookworm Campaign diagnosed hookworm
infection in 57446 persons and treated 45,035 of these persons,
76.4 percent; it gave 27G.062 mass treatments and 27,966 re-
treatments, a total of 351,063 treatments for hookworm infection,
2. Cures of Hookworm Infection.
Microscopic reexaminations of faecal specimens to
determine cure were not carried out following most treatments
although during the original surveys attempts 'were made to
reexamine all treated persons; during control surveys re-
examinations were not requested and very few were made. Table 42
gives the numbers of reexaminations made following ary treatment
and the number and percent of resulting cures. It was not found
possible to obtain the actual number of persons re-examined.

Re-ex?m i m tion.
Approximately half of the re-examinations resulted in
cures as judged by the microscope. luring the work of the
Queensland Hookworm Carpai :n and up to the end of 1922 in the
work of the Australian Hookworm Campaign, practically all
treatments were with oil of chenopodium; during 1923 one field
unit used carbon tetrachlorido for treatments aid the resulting
percentage of cures was scmovhat higher than it had been.
Dur irg 1924 all treatments we re with carbon tetrachloride and
the rate of cures in the few reexaminations made was 78.8
percent, a high rate for field treatments. During the earlier
years reexaminations were made after the secord treatment with
oil of dienopodiun and after every second subsequent tre-atfnent.
When carbon tetrachloride was used only one treatment was given
before re-examination was made a.nd such examinations after
subsequent treatments were very rare. The rate of cure in
1924 represents to a large degree the field results of one dose
of carton tetrachloride while the rates of cures in earlier
years represent the results of at least two doses of oil of
chenopodium and frequently more than two doses.

3, Value of Retreatmentsf.
As has been previously stated, the policy of giving
retreatments and endeavouring to effect a complete cure of
persons found infected with hookworms was definitely abandoned
with the beginning of the control Purveys, although it had
been less and less applied previous to that time. The
reasons for this definite abandonment were found in the
reported results of retreatments given in Australia and in
other countries. Table 43 gives the results of successive
treatments with oil of chenopodiura in eight Queensland
districts where intensive surveys were made. Reexaminations
to determine cure were made after every other treatment with
oil of chenopOdium.
Table 45. Results in Cures Following Successive
Treatmaits with Oil of Chenopod ium in Eight
Queensland Districts.


There were 5305 persons treated in these eight
districts and 29 92 found cured, a percentage of cures of
55.6. Of the 2992 persons ultimately cured, 2070 were cured
hy the first two treatments with oil of chenopodium; that
is, 69.2 percent were cured hy the first round of treatments
and only 30.7 percent hy the remaining treatments. When
the extra time and expense necessary to do the second and
subsequent rounds of treatments are considered, and the fact
that two weeks must he allowed between treatment and re-
examination when oil of chenopodium is used must be remembered, the
results obtained by continued treatment are not justified on
an economic basis. . For snail areas and for demonstration
purposes an effort to cure all infections might be justifiable
but for routine control work in all fields the results of
the first round of treatments are such a large part of the total
results that subsequent treatments are not economical.
Since carbon tetrachloride will percentage
of infections with one dose then oil of chenopodium does with
two, it is probable that the results of further treatments
with this drug will be an even smaller part of the total
results. For routine field work the policy of giving one
treatment with carbon tetrachloride, with no subsequent
efforts to obtain re-examinations or to give further treatment,
seems amply justified.
It seems wise to mention here that experience in
this an? other hookworm control work has demonstrated, that
oil of chenopodium will inhibit the egg laying powers of the
female hookworm for approximately two weeks and consequently
re-examinations cannot be made, if accuracy is desired,
before that interval after treatment. Work done at the
Hospital for the Insane at Sandy Gallop during a survey there
indicated that carbon tetrachloride does not greatly inhibit
the egg laying powers of the female ancylostome and that
re-examinations to determine cure following treatment with
2 c.c. of this drug can be made with entire safety ene week
after treatment and with considerable assurance of correct
results four or five days after treatment.
4. Treatment Methods.
Several comparative tests of treatment methods have
been made during the v/ork of the Australian Hookworm
Canpaign, the results of which have been reported at length
in articles published in various journals and reprinted, and
in the monthly and amual reports of the Australian Hookworm
Canpaign. Summaries only of these tests will be given here.


The field teats of carbon tetrachloride have shown
a higher efficiency of this drug than was ever fcund for oil
of chenopodium; reference to this fact was made in the
discussion of cures recorded. The use of carbon tetrachloride
is considerably cheaper than is the use of oil of chenopodium
since one dose only is necessary as against a routine of two
doses for chenopodium. Other factors also enter into the
comparative cheapness of carbon tetrachloride, such as the fact
that it does not have to be given in capsules but can be given
in a glass of water . The field tests all demonstrated the
desirability of car>on tetrachloride on the grounds of .
efficiency in action, conservation of time and saving of money.
Dr. Heydvi, Medical Officer of the Commonwea Ith
Department of Health in Rabaul, made several tests of carbon
tetrachloride in treatment. He found that 3.4 c.c. of carbon
tetrachloride removed approximately 90.7 percent of the total
hockwcims of a group of 10 persons, while 1.5 c.c. of oil of
chenopodium removed only 77.4 percent of the v/oims of 16
persons. In a later test of 27 persons he recovered 95.6
percent of nil isome found by giving 2% c.c. of carbon tetra-
chloride and found that 05.2 percent of the persons were
microscopically cured following this treatment. The same dcse
in another group of 52 persons cured C 6.5 percent. All of
the wens recovered by Dr. Heydcn were of the species Necatcr
americanus.
Y/crk done at the Hospitals for the Insane at Gocdna
and S''ndy Gallop showed that carbon tetrachloride was not
as efficient as oil of chenopodium in removing hookworms of
the species Ancylostoma duodenale. In tests on 119 patients
at Sandy Gallop the most efficient drug and dose was found to
be oil of chenopodium given in two 0.75 c.c. doses one hour
apart. A large dose of carbon tetrachloride, 10 c.c, was very
Blightly less efficient. Since this large dose could net
be used in field work, oil of chenopodium in a divided dose
would seem to remain supreme for the cure of infections with
Ancylostcma duodenale. This species is conparati vely uncommon
in Australia and its dependencies and the rel c tive inefficiency
of carbon tetrachloride in removing it is not of practical
importance to Australian control work. The comparative
inefficiency of carbon tetrachloride in-v?c?3f-rerneving Ascaris
is also net of importance in Australia where infection with
this parasite is rare.


As a. result of these and ether tests in Australia
and other ccur.trios the following routine treatment instruct-
ions were adopted and *re reccnsnendeci f-..r future use.
1. ITo preliminary fasting or purging is necessary.
The person to he treated should, however, take his
dose before breakfast cn an empty stomach aai, should
refrain from taking food until his bowels acted.
All patients should be warned to ovcid alcohol before
and after treatment.
2. The dose of carbon tetrachloride is 2 c.c. for
a.n adult a.nd 2 minims per year f 'pporert age up to
17 years when tho adult d~se is given. The dose can
be increased to 3 or 4 c.c. without much danger tut
2 c.c. is a safer routine dose. Tho drug should be
taken in about half a. glass of voter.
3. An efficient dose of salts should be taken. This
should be given with the dose .of carbon tetrachloride
tut may be taken a.n hour or tv? after it. Carbon
tetrachloride in small doses is not an efficient
laxative end salts should be t.akai.


VIII. PUBLICITY.
1* General.
A large part of the success of any scheme for disease
control must depend on popular interest in and knowledge of
its aims and a large measure of this publicity may be gained
through the newspapers. The newspapers of Australia have
been of great assistance to the Australian Hookworm Campaign
in freeopening their columns to interviews and articles
explaining in popular terms the objects of the campaign.
Local newspapers and ones with a more general circulation
have oarriGd much material of this kind, the value and extent
of which it ie impossible to estimate. It can be said safely
that the number of people, in the parts of Australia which
needed epeoial attention, who do not know whst the Hookworm
Campaign is and what it is trying to dc is very small.
In addition to newspaper publicity the Hookworm
Campaign has distributed approximately 500,000 leaflets*
The principal ones were,"The Fight Against Hookworm Di sease",
"The Story of a Boy", "Malaria and Filaria" and a sanitary
wall-poster. The latter roster explained the essentials
of a safe closet, warned of the dangers of s>il pollution and
urged proper nightsoil disposal methods. It was districted
to the Local Authorities and was posted by them in all the
closets of thei r areas . The other leaflets wore distributed
by the field inspectors ergaged in collecting faecal and
blood specimens.
Lectures cn hook’.voim infection were given by Medical
Officers and _Qther members of the staff. During the work
completed before December 31, 1922, 1417 lectures were given
with a total attendance of 109,050 persons; public lectures
numbered 696 with an attendance of 65,760, school lectures,
504 with an attendance of 39,730 and special lectures, 137
with an attendance of 3,552. During 1923 and 1924 the
lectures given were not reported since they were given in
places where work had been dene previously. Practically
all schools visited during these years were given talks on
hookworm infection and its prevention and mapy lectures cn
malaria and filaria were given to moving picture audiences and
to other groups, and the Sanitary Engineer addressed practically
all of the Local Authorities of the endemic hookwom areas of
Queensland on the subject of the prevent ion of soil pollit ion;
it is probable that the number of lectures given would not be
as great as in the first three years but that the attendance
at lectures would be slightly greater. None of the reports
made included the numerous personal interview's and talks to
small groups made by medical officers and field inspectors
during the collection of specimens and the giving of treatments.


The Australian Hookworm Campaign had three moving
picture films, two on "Unhooking the Hookworm" and one on
mosquito breeding and its prevention. These films were shown
in Sydney, Melbourne* Adelaide and Brisbane and throughout
the endemic hookworm areas of Queensland and hew South Wales.
It is impossible to estimate the number of people reached by
this means but the advantages of this method of publicity
were very great. Paramount Pictures Limited took over the films
free of charge and routed then through the coastal parts of
Queensland and northern Hew South Wales.

IX. ACKNOWLEDGMENT.
The Australian Hookworm Campaign has received a
very large measure of cooperation from Government and from
individuals during its five years of work. Maiy of these
acts have been mentioned in annual and other reports but
many cculd only be considered in the most general way. It
is impossible in a final report cf this nature to review all
the courtesies and acts of co-operation which the Campaign has
received, but the appreciation is nevertheless most sincere.
It is impossible to value at their true worth the services
rendered.
The Commonwealth Department of Health had a very close
relation to the Hookworm Campaign as one of the participants
and made early work possible in Northern Territory, in the
vicinity of Thursday Island and in New Guinea by peimitting
their officers to serve as Medical Officers of the Hookworm
Campaign. Dr. J.H.L. Cumpstor., Director General of Health
for the did every thing in his power, in both
hi s public capacity and privately, to forward the work and
his advice and cooperation were invaluable. Dr. J.S.C.
Slkington and Dr. H.T. Holmes, Director and Acting Director
of the Division of Tropical Hygiene, were uniformly helpful
in their advice and interest. Dr. A. Breinl and Dr. R.W.
Cilento, successive Directors of the Australian Institute of
Tropical Medicine did all in their power to aid the work;
practically all of the resurvey work in north Queensland
was done under Dr. Cilento's immediate supervision.
>
The members of the foiner Central Executive Committee
and members of the State and Territoiy Executive Committees
formulated policies and made many helpful suggestions which
were much appreciated.
The State Departments of Health rendered every
assistance to the units of the Hookworm Campaign-and to this
fact a large share of the success of the campaign is due.
Dr. J.I. yore, Corrmissloner of Public Health for Queensland,
the State in which the most work was done, had very close
relations with the work and backed up all the efforts of'the
campaign to improve local sanitation. The New South Wales
Department'of Health was also of great assistance. The
Departments of Public Instruction in both Queensland and
New South Wales were heartily interested in the work and
cooperated in mary ways. Both departments lent the
services of a school nurse for varying periods and the
New South Wale 3 department had its school medical officers
arrarge for the collection of faecal specimens fran schools.


Rooms and buildings for offices and laboratories
were loaned free of charge to the Hookworm Campaign by
state and local authorities. The building in which the
central office was maintained for five years was loaned by
Queensland in this way. Individuals ard private corporations
have furnished means of transport and entertainment to medical
officers md inspectors engaged in field woik.
The press throughout Australia opened its columns
to a large amount of publicity and so made work much easier.
Without the very large measure of loyalty and enthusiasm
with which the plans and policies of the Hookworm Campaign
were put into effect by the members of the staff, the work
here reported would not have been possible. Almost without
exception the members of the staff of the Eookworn Campaign
were entitled to the highest credit for their faithful work,
often accomplished under conditions of great difficulty.
Special mention should be made of the particularly valuable
services of Mr. S.G. Palmer, who served with the campaign as
Secretary for the entire five yearß of its existence and who
was responsible to a large extent for the financial ard
practical success of the wo?k.
As has been stated, these acknowledgments do not
cover the whole ground by aiy means, but they do express
to a slight §xtent the appreciation of the Hookworm Campaign
for all tho cooperation it received.

X. SUMMARY.
Table 44 gives a summary of all the hookworm and
sanitary control work mentioned in this report.
Table 44. Summary of all Hookworm ard Sanitary
Control Work in Australia and its
Dependencies.
The Australian Hookworm Campaign in the fivd years of
its work has determined the endemic hookworm areas of
Australia and its dependencies and the varying infection
rates for those areas# It has devised and put into
operation a scheme for the control of this infection which
is both rapid and economical and which has resulted in a
considerable reduction in the amount and severity of the
hookworm infection in the areas found to be endemic. It
has also aroused considerable popular interest in, and
support for, hookworm control v/ork and, through this channel,
public health measures in general ard has demonstrated what
can be accomplished in disease control and prevention by
organized cooperative efforts.


The main factors in the control of hookworm infection
are largely local ones and the cooperation of Local
Authorities is essential. It would seem that the goal of
any hookworm control work should be the ultimate establishment
of local health services in rural and urban areas which could
efficiently control, not only hookworm disea6e, but also all
other local health problems. For a thorough success along
•all lines, the establishment of local health services with
capable full-time health officers should be the result of the
effort which has been and 7/ill be made.
Fo disease is subject to control by sporadic or
intermittent measures. The control of hookworm infection
in Australia and its dependencies has been well begun and
it is nov/ essential that no opportunity for loss of control
be given. Continued effort will greatly reduce the
incidence of hookworm infection, the most important of the
tropical diseases of Australia, and will afford a shining
example of what can be accomplished by intelligent, well-
organized cooperation in making tropical countries healthy
places in which to' live*
