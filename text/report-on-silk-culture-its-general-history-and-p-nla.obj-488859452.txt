P REFACE.
Considerable interest has lately been aroused respecting the culture of
Silk in New South Whales, due, in a great measure, to the industry having
been taken up practically by some of the Italian survivors of the Marquis
de Ray’s ill-fated expedition to New Britain at “New Italy,” near the
Richmond River, in the north-easternmost district of New South Wales.
The result of the Italians’ experiment, so far as it has been carried out,
has been extremely encouraging, as will be seen in the following pages of the
Report laid on the Table of the Legislative .Assembly.
So many inquiries have been made from persons in various parts of this
as well as the adjoining Colonies, respecting the work carried on at New
Italy, and many applications for copies of the Report having been received
it has been deemed advisable to publish it in pamphlet form.
The information given in this Report on Silk Culture, apart from the
reference to New Italy, will, no doubt, be of considerable value to many
who take an interest in the subject but who have not access to reliable works
and documents.
It seems not improbable that Silk culture will, in the not very distant
future, be found sufficiently profitable to induce many of those settlers to
take it up, who at present find but little, if any, profit in the one or two farm
crops they produce.
It seems not unlikely, also, that this industry may prove of considerable
assistance to many of the present producers of wool wffio find the raising of
this commodity not quite so profitable as it used to be, and that it may be
advisable to add to their bow 7 a silken—in addition to their present somewhat
weakening woollen—string.




REPORT ON SERICULTURE:
BY
W. S. CAMPBELL F.L.S.
W. S. Campbell, Esq., E.L.S., to The Under Secretary for Mines
and Agriculture.
Sir ’ ' . Department of Mines, 23 December, 1892.
In accordance with jour instructions, dated 2nd November, 1892, “ to inquire
»t° the question of sericulture, and furnish a report thereon, as soon as possible, which
should bear upon the present state of the industry, its possibilities, the result of past
expenditure of public money, present work, and procedure of officers in charge.”
I have now the honor, most respectfully, to submit my report, which has taken
me longer to complete than I expected, for it involved a great deal of research and inquiry
far more than can be apparent.
I have made as exhaustive an investigation, as was possible for me to do within a
reasonable time, into the history of the introduction of sericulture, or rather attempts
to introduce it, into New South Wales, in order to ascertain why such attempts did not
succeed, I have also traced out the causes of failure of similar attempts in other
countries.
The possibilities of the industry I have carefully considered, and I feel confident
that my deductions, from the immense mass of evidence I have been able to obtain and
sift, are correct.
It is necessary for me to refer to action that has been taken with respect to
sericulture in other countries, from time to time, and also to refer to its general history •
but this I have done as concisely as is consistent with its importance, and as beino-, to
some extent, a guide in determining any future action that may be considered necessary
towards assisting, fostering, or encouraging the industry in this Colony.
Bince the foundation of New South Wales various attempts have been made from
tune to time spasmodically, as it were, by private persons to establish the sericulture
industry. Some of these attempts were feeble and half hearted, but others, more
vigorous, were made by well-intentioned but over-sanguine individuals who were either
as far as I can gather, entirely ignorant of the subject, or who had insufficient means to
carry out their projects. Attempts were also made by well-informed persons who might
have succeeded if their efforts had been supported by the State. As far as I can ascer-
tain from any records procurable, no assistance towards the establishment of the industry
was ever directly afforded, nor was any money expended by the State until assistance in
the form of a loan bearing interest at 5 per cent, per annum was made to the Italians
at Aew Italy, and the appointment of Mr. Eeginald Champ to initiate the industry.
History shows that in nearly every country, if not in all countries in which seri-
culture has been established, and become a most important and valuable industry, the
State has been the means of its very birth, development, and ultimate success, by assist-
ance and wise encouragement.


It may not be out of place to relate here a remarkable fact in connection with the
development of sericulture in Japan. “ The date of the introduction of the silkworm
into Japan seems somewhat obscure. But commencing with the fifth century ot the
Christian era, the industry has spread rapidly. In fact, the people addicted themselves
to the pursuit with such ardour that, in fear lest other branches of agriculture should be
altogether abandoned, the Japanese Government has, at times, forbidden the extension of
mulberry cultivation, or attempted by sumptuary laws to restrict the use of silk
garments to certain classes.” _ . .
The silk industry originated in China in most remote times, and it is mentioned
even so far back as B.C. 2700 in the old Chinese traditions. “When it was a
Royal occupation to rear the silkworm and to weave the silk into robes of gorgeous
attire; and to the Consort of one of the Emperors is ascribed the honour
discovering the habits of this valuable insect and the nature of the thread it spun. X
find in a translation, by Jennings, of the Shi King or old “ poetry classic ” of the Chinese,
(a very remarkable work) references are made, in many of the odes, written upwards of
1,000 years 8.C., to the silkworms and the mulberry.
Erom China, sericulture gradually spread probably through Northern India, to
Persia, and finally to Europe about the year A.D. 530. It may not be generally known
that silk weaving was a recognised industry in England before the year A.D. 1363, and
is referred to by Act of Parliament, 37 Edward 111., Cap. 5 and 6. The silk-yarn used
was, I believe, obtained from Syria, and it is said that this was unravelled from silk
fabrics obtained from China. The practice of unravelling silk fabrics is mentioned
by Aristotle, and these fabrics also were obtained from China, and were unravelled and
rewoven into much finer goods at the Island of Kos, near Asia-Minor, about the year
B.C. 400. The Romans afterwards did the same sort of work. The early history ot the
spread of silk production and manufacture is extremely interesting, but it is unnecessary
to touch upon it further at present; however, its modern history is of considerable
importance.
In France the silk industry is said to have begun, or, rather, an attempt was
made to introduce it, sometime daring the thirteenth century, in much the same
manner, apparently, as attempts have been made to introduce it into New South Wales.
But it made no progress until the year A.D. 1521, “ during which Milanese artisans were
invited and went to Nismes to teach the French peasantry how to manage the white
mulberry-tree, to take care of the silkworms, and to harvest their silk. The infant
industry thus initiated was enthusiastically encouraged by King Henry Quatre, and of
such good quality were the mulberries, and so carefully tendered, then and since, that
the first bush planted on that occasion is still said to survive.”
After about a century, the industry was greatly assisted and encouraged by Louis
XIV, and continued to improve both in the production of raw silk and local manufacture,
until’the Revolution, towards the close of the eighteenth century, greatly interfered with
and nearly destroyed it. However,- “ one of the very few good things Napoleon Bona-
parte did for France was to foster sericulture so that under Ids encouragement the crop
once more began to increase ” until the year 1850, when the terrible contagious silk-
worm diseases began in France, rapidly extended throughout Europe, and eventually
through the rest of the silk-producing world, and almost annihilated the whole silk
industry. Again the State came to the rescue, by the appointment of M. Pasteur
who devised the means by applying science to avoid the use of deceased worms, but
unfortunately the silkworm diseases have by no means been stamped out or eradicated in
the present silk-producing countries, and probably never will be ; and it is, therefore,
absolutely necessary to take great precautions, involving considerable expense, to keep
them in sufficient check to enable the silk industry to be carried on.
In a minute written by me to the Honorable the Minister for Mines, on 29th
March, 18S9, respecting Mr. Brady’s silkworms, I invited the attention to the expense
in connection with keeping the diseases in check, as follows : ; I understand that Mr.


Brady claims that his silkworms are entirely free from the terrible silkworm disease
vvhich some years ago almost rained silk production in Europe, Asia, and China, until
, * Pasteur discovered u method for combating it; but to keep silkworms free from tbe
disease must be very expensive, judging from the following report, made to the United
states Department of Agriculture. After Pasteur made his discoveries which resulted
m the establishment of his system of microscopical selection in the production of silk-
worm eggs, Signor Susani, of Milan, was one of the first to put the process into operation
on a commercial scale. He has now the largest establishment of this sort in the world,
employing 3,000 hands during the coupling season, and 750 for microscopical
examinations. therefore, if Mr. Brady s worms were used, being perfectly healthy, the
expense of /oO hands could be saved. “During the year 1870, the Austrian Govern-
ment opened an experimental station at Goutz, with a view of studying ‘ the malady of
the silkworm.” ’ j & j
Italy,.where silk culture is one of the principal sources of wealth, was not long in
following this example, and in the month of April, 1871, a Royal decree, established at
Padua, an institution called the Experimental Sericultural Station. The Italian
Grovei nment and the City and Chamber of Commerce, Padua, pay the expenses of the
institution. Its objects are, —
1. To study the raising of silkworms under the best conditions, and experiment
with the products thereof.
2. To study the feeding of silkworms by means of physiological and chemical
experiments.
3. To study the diseases of the silkworm and of the mulberry.
1. To produce and distribute healthy silkworm eggs for silk-growers.
5. To experiment with new varieties of eggs as°well as with other articles which
concern the Magnanerie.
6. To undertake all such studies and experiments as might be useful to sericulture.
/. To distribute circulars, and to deliver lectures so as to make generally known
the best means of succeeding in silk culture.
8. To give the greatest possible publicity to all matters connected with the seri-
cultural industry in the kingdom of Italy.
“The station has done inestimable service for sericulture, it having granted
diplomas to 250 pupils, who now occupy places in the sericultural observatories and
spread their knowledge among silk-grow'ers.” .
.My researches into the history of the introduction of sericulture into 'many
countries lead me to believe that, in the same manner in which the industry has been
fostered, aided, or encouraged in Prance by the State, so it has been in all other silk-
producing countries, in various ways ; and so it must be in New South Wales from the
very necessities of the peculiarities of the industry.
In some countries it wms even forced on the population; for I find, for instance,
Elorence early became a centre of the silk trade, and in order to ensure entire success,
each peasant in Tuscany w r as compelled to plant at least five mulberrv-trees on the land
he cultivated.”
It will be as well to take a glance at the attempts made to introduce sericulture
into Great Britain and Ireland, and, incidentally, America, being important as well as
interesting, before proceeding to consider the efforts made to introduce it into New
South Wales.
Erom the time of King Edward the Third, until about the year 1821, English
Governments, from time to time, endeavoured to foster the silk-weaving industry by Acts
of Parliament, and the imposition of duties on manufactured silk articles; but these
actions do not seem to have resulted in any benefits to the manufacturers, but rather the
reverse. However it is unnecessary to enter into this matter in detail as it bears only
slightly on my subject, which is the production of raw silk to feed the manufactories.
The attempts to produce raw silk have failed owing chiefly to the severe and changeable


climate. The most notable endeavour was that made by King James the First.
Burbidge says, “ Mulberry-trees were introduced into England early in his reign by
James the First, who spent £935 in planting them near his palace ; and by Royal
edict about the year 1605, offered packets of mulberry seeds to all who would sow them
for the purpose of encouraging the cultivation of silkworms for the promotion of silk
manufacture in this country. The Eoyal patronage rendered the tree so popular that
there is scarcely an old garden of gentleman’s seat which existed in the seventeenth century
in which a mulberry-tree is not to be found. In 1609 Sieur de la Foret, who had in
France a nursery of 500,000 plants, travelled over the midland and eastern counties of
England for the sale of mulberry-trees, and he distributed not less than 100,000.
This species of mulberry was the morus nigra. It is frequently to be met with in
gardens in New South Wales and other colonies, and is generally known as the
“ English mulberry.”
John Evelyn in his “ Sylva,” published 1669, strongly advocated sericulture for
England. “ About this time,” he says, “or a little after it was that King James did with
extraordinary care recommend it to this nation by a book of directions, Acts of Council,
and all other princely assistance. But this did not take no more than that of Henry
the Fourth’s proposal about the environs of Paris who tilled the highways and gardens
of France with the trees, beginning in his own gardens for encouragement. Yet
I say this would not be brought into example till ,the present great Monarch by
theind efatigable diligence of Monsieur Colbert (superintendent of His Majesty’s
manufactories) who has so successfully revived it that it is prodigious to consider what
an happy progress they have made in it, to our shame be it spoken; who have no other
discouragements from any insuperable difficulty whatever, but our sloth and want of
industry, since wherever these trees will grow and prosper, the silkworms will do also ;
and they were alike averse, and from the very same suggestions where now that manu-
facture flourishes in our nighbour countries. It is demonstrable that mulberries in four
or five years may be made to spread all over this land, and when the indigent and young
daughters in proud families are as willing to gain 3s. or 4s. a day for gathering silk and
busying themselves in this sweet and easy employment, as some do get 4d. a day for hard
work at hemp, flax, and wool; the reputation of mulberries would spread in England
and other plantations.” Writing of James’ failure Butler remarks, “ but though this
first attempt fell through, others since carried out at different places, as Slough,
Nottingham, Yatley, &c., have been more successful and have demonstrated that it is
quite possible for good silk to be produced in this country. The climate is too changeable
to permit of the permanent establishment of silk-production, and the expenses attending
the process have always been found to be heavy for it to be financially a success; it has
been found cheaper to import the raw material than to produce it on the spot. The
rearing of silkworms in our own country, therefore, is still merely a pastime, and an
‘ education’ as the French call them are carried out on an extremely insignificant scale,
smaller than anyone would dream of undertaking if it were done to utilising the silk.”
Referring to James’ action in England an American writer says, “ the same
Monarch ordered the planting of trees in the American colonies, and he then essayed to
enforce the silk industry by fine and premium” * * # “ The Huguenots brought
the culture to South Carolina and even there manufactured silk. Law (of South Sea
Bubble fame) brought it to Mississippi, and in 1734-5 Oglethorpe planted it in Georgia
and it is historical that he presented Queen Caroline of England with 8 pounds of
raw silk,from which Charles II wore robe and hose at his coronation ; and still later (in
1755) the Princess Dowager and Lord Chesterfield boasted of wearing American silk.”
* * * “ Premiums werebestowed and penalties enforced to fixjhe industry in the colonies,
for the Treasury of England complained that no foreign commodity more exhausted her
exchequer than the importation of raw silk to feed her 40,000 silk manufactories. But
neither Royal favour, hope of reward, or fear of punishment availed, for England paralysed
one hand by the arbitrary use of the other in sanctioning a charter to a joint stock


company of London, privileged to take African negroes to the colonies, which caused all
other enterprise to be abandoned for that of cultivating tobacco. There was a struggle,
however, here and there still to sustain silk-culture, for in 1741 a filature had been
established in Savannah, and silk from this quarter was quoted at 2s. above that imported
from any other country, and this convenience of reducing the cocoon to silk thread
encouraged its raising ; but, most unfortunately, the filature was burned, consuming a
large stock of raw material. Then followed the Revolution, which made breadstuff s the
first consideration; yet, many women of the land continued to raise silk for their own
use, mixing with it wool for homespun garments ; but with peace came cotton, then the
gin, whereupon followed the monarchy of slavery.”
In the year 1825, a great effort was made by a large and influential company,
having a capital of £1,000,000, in shares of £SO each, designated “The British, Irish,
and Colonial Silk C 0.,” to introduce silk-culture into Ireland, tinder the directions of this
company, the celebrated Italian work on the art of rearing silkworms, written by Count
Dandolo, was translated and published in England. I was anxious to ascertain for cer-
tain why this company did not succeed, for it has been stated that it was due to want of
labour, but I was very doubtful on this point, and I am glad to say I found the proper
reason given in the following extract, which gives also some useful information as to the
spread of the mulberry :
“ Mulberries are mentioned by the early Greek writers, Theophrastus, Dioscorides,
and Galen, and among the Romans by Virgil, Horace, Pliny, &c. All these writers are
supposed to refer to the black mulberry (AT. nigra), which must have been the species
first employed for feeding the silkworm after its introduction to Western Asia and the
South of Europe. Dr. Tozetti states that the introduction of the white mulberry into-
Italy is of a date long posterior to that of the silkworm. These were imported into Sicilyr
in 1148 by King Ruggieri after he had conquered Thebes, Athens, and Corinth. The
Lucchese are said to have learned the art of rearing them from the Sicilians, and intro-
duced it into Florence, when in 1315 they took refuge therefrom the sack of their own
city, Pognini has, however, proved that silk was produced in Florence in, and previous,
to the year 1225, and from Italian histories and chronicles it appears that there were
silk factories there before 126 G. From Sicily, mulberry-trees were brought to France
about 1494. The black mulberry is mentioned by Tusser in 1557, and it is stated that
the first trees were planted at Syon house in 1548, but the first Duke of Northumber-
land said, previous to 1824, that he could trace these trees back three centuries. Indeed,
there is every reason to suppose that, as very old mulberry-trees were found near
Monasteries they had been introduced by the Monks whilst they were in possession of
these establishments. Bacon enjoyed in London the shade of a mulberry-tree, and
Shakespeare, as is well known, had a favourite one at Stratford on Avon. We have seen
twoothersthat were raised from this celebrated tree and planted by Garrick at his villa near
Hampton Court, where they are, or were, very lately, still alive. They had been planted
in line with hollies apparently of the same age, and were the common black mulberry,”
** * “ Morns alba, the white mulberry is a native of China and of the north of
India according to some authors; but in the latter Dr. Royle states (Botany of
Himalayan Mountains) that it is not found wild. It is said to have been unknown to
the ancients, although some allusion is made to its fruit in their writings. In the
Journal of the Horticultural Society (IX, 170) it is mentioned that a variety of the
white mulberry said to be delicious eating, but unknown in Europe, is now abundant in
Beloochistan, Afghanistan, and probably in Persia, and apparently of a very ancient
cultivation there. It is by no means impossible that some knowledge of it may have
reached such of the ancient writers as may have been in the East or had communication
with it. It is commonly supposed that cuttings of the white mulberry were first
brought into Tuscany from the Levant by Francisco Buonvinici in 1434. In the fol-
lowing year a law for encouraging its cultivation was made in Italy, and in the course
of the fifteenth century the white mulberry had gradually, but entirely, superseded the


black as far as regards its cultivation for tlie feeding of silkworms, which produces
the silk spun in Europe. The tree grows to the height of 20 or 30 feet, and has a
heart-shaped, or ovate undivided or lohed serrated and rather glossy leaf. The fruit is
white or pale red. The tree is of more rapid growth than M. nigra, and its leaves
contain more of the glutinous milky substance resembling caoutchouc which gives
tenacity to silk produced by the worms which feed on them, and is found in all plants
on which they exist. The white mulberry and its varieties are more tender than the
black which, as above stated, has withstood for more than 300 years our severest
winters ; but not so the white, for in most winters its shoots are killed back, more or
less, and in less than thirty years the tree becomes very stunted. Hence, without due
precautions, it could not be grown in this climate (England), to supply food for
silkworms. If cut down, however, like raspberry canes, the white mulberry pushes
again very rapidly, and if not constantly nipped almost in the bud, a profusion of leaves
■would soon be produced.
Herein, we suppose, must have lain the error by which a British, Irish, and
Colonial Silk Company formed in 1825, must have failed independent of other adverse
causes which may have existed. This company imported 26,000 white mulberry-trees
from the south of France into Ireland, and soon after 200,000 more. The speculation,
however, proved unsuccessful, though we know from experience that fine silk has been
produced abundantly in Britain, the silkworms being fed on the leaves of the black
mulberry, those of the white mulberry and of the Osage orange being used as occasional
substitutes. The deaths of the worms under such conditions have not been above
3 per cent. In such a company the question of success would resolve itself into two
heads—lst, the proper management of the mulberry plantation, which would be very
easy ; and secondly, the price of labour. The labour might be performed by otherwise
unemployed persons, at a rate, we suppose, remunerative to both employers and
employed.”
Seeicultuee in New South Wales.
It seems very probable that the introduction of sericulture into New South
Wales may have been contemplated in the early days of the Colony from the fact that
the mulberry was found to thrive admirably.
In the year 1825 the Australian Agricultural Company was formed in England,
and its original prospectus showed that it was the intention of the company to plant,
amongst other things, the mulberry for silk production. However, “ the grand idea of
vineyards, olive oil, opium, silkworm cultivation, and orange groves, which found
applauded passages in speeches in the House of Commons and Court-room of the company
were never extended beyond the resident managers gardens.”
Sir Thomas Mitchell writing in 1831, and referring to Mr. John Macarthur’s garden
at Parramatta, said :—“ Here I saw * * * magnificent mulberries of thirty-five
years growth, umbrageous and green.”
I find in Mr. Surgeon E. Gr. Jameson’s work, llecent travels in New South Wales,
&c., published in 1842, the following very interesting and significant remarks: —“ The
wool of New South Wales connects her with the rest of the world and bringing to her
shores the wealth and the products of other lands, but there remain other resources, the
development of which presents a yet unopened field for the industry of the colonists and
a wider range of commercial intercourse. Of these prospective resources the culture of
silk is especially deserving of attention. The mulberry-tree grows to great perfection
and the silkworms already introduced have shown by their instinctive industry, that a
great trade in raw silk might be carried on from the shores of Australia as easily as from
those of China or Italy! The scarcity and high price of labour, must, for many years, con -
stitute a feature in the Australian Colonies and in all communities widely dispersed will
militate against the employment of adults in this climate. But where the work to be
performed demands no hardships, no exertion of physical strength and but an hour or


two of occupation which does not merit the name of labour, it seems reasonable to
conclude that the employment of young persons of either sex in the management of silk-
worms might be rendered conducive to very serviceable objects.
In reducing this proposition to a practical shape it will be adopted by a funda-
mental principle that the labours of those employed is worth a certain sum per day
to be given to them in the shape of maintenance and in the shape of education. Such
an arrangement it may be presumed would diminish the burden of the parent with-
out injuring the health or moral interests of the child. The strong and well founded
objections that present themselves for the employment of juvenile labour for many
hours of the day in manufactories would not apply to its employment in which I
have vaguely attempted to advert to. Like all untried systems this would appear at first
sight to be surrounded with difficulty, but we may ask, what great or useful undertaking
was ever yet accomplished without difficulty F ”
Braim, in his History of New South Wales, 1815, says, “the olive is peculiarly
fitted for our soil, and so also is the mulberry, which would enable us to manufacture silk
even in large quantities. This has we know been tried on a small scale, and been
attended with complete success.”
In the year 1815, a very able article “on the rearing of the silkworm, and the
cultivation of the mulberry in Australia, by Phalsema, a Mr. Campbell, appeared in the
Oddfellows Magazine , published in Sydney ; and attention was directed to this article
by very favourable criticisms which appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald , in November
and December, 1815. “We may as well now pronounce our opinion,” said the writer
in the Herald, “ that it is a clear and well written paper, calculated to be useful both in
directing public attention to a new and great source of employment and wealth for this
Colony, and in affording valuable hints to those who have already studied the subject,
and who can best appreciate the results of those patient and minute, yet pleasing cares,
so peculiarly necessary in this branch of industry as a source of gain.” * * * “Itis
remarkable, but quite consistent with everyday experience, that all companies formed for
the cultivation of silk, have, so far as we know, failed in their object. Companies
formed for its culture in England and Ireland have thus been unsuccessful, but this we
do not attribute to their being companies alone, for we know an experienced individual,
an Italian, who came from Italy purposely to try the rearing of the silkworm in
England, and also was obliged to give it up. A company tried it in the Sandwich
Islands, and we do not say that their experiments were not judicious and careful. The
fact is, a severe drought destroyed the plants, moreover they could not hatch the eggs
of the same season, in short they also abandoned the attempt. A similar association
was formed in Jamaica, and worked during two seasons. Its success for the first season
was by no means encouraging. During the second it was better. Butin that colony, as
in all countries of the Northern Hemisphere, especially the intertropical, great casualties
to the worms arise from the heavy rains. We shall not be surprised to learn that this
undertaking's also relinquished.” This was followed, in the Herald, by a series of
articles on sericulture by another writer. Apparently a good deal of attention must
have been given to the subject at that time.
About the year 1818, a gentleman named Buezeville, made an effort to establish
a sericultural farm at Eastwood, near Eyde, but he did not succeed in carrying out his
project, simply from want of means. His failure was talked about for years in the
neighbourhood, as I perfectly well remember. This gentleman, who had acquired a
practical knowledge of sericulture in Europe, evidently foresaw great potentialities in
the industry if it once became established in New South Wales, but he was looked
upon as “ a visionary,” and even as a “ humbug,” by the neighbours, in consequence of
his want of success, but no consideration seemed to have been allowed for his crippled
means, which was the true cause of failure. I have heard it said that an endeavour was
made by the late T. S. Mort and others to obtain assistance from the Government, to
enable Ivlr. Buezeville to carry on his experiment, but without success. I cannot


discover any official documents bearing on the subject. This attempt to establish
sericulture is probably that referred to by Elannigan in his History of New South
Wales, thus, “ The experiment which had been made to grow silk, on an extensive scale
in the Colony, proved a failure, chiefly in consequence of the want of the proper species
of mulberry.”
No attention appears to have been given to sericulture in the Colony for some
years after this. In a speech made at a meeting of the Silk Supply Association of
London, held on the 18th May, 1869, Sir Daniel Cooper threw some light on the reasons
for this neglect. He said, “He had passed many years on the east coast of Australia,
and more than twenty years ago this subject of cultivating silk was started in Sydney in
the hope that a company might be formed and silk become a permanent production in
New South Wales. He did not think the thing was properly managed or properly
started, and then the gold discovery came, and .the silkworms and things of that sort
were forgotten.”
In the year 1862, or about that time, Mr. Charles Brady took the matter in hand
and spent many years at his own expense, and carried through many very important and
valuable experiments of an entirely new character ; and that gentleman, in a letter to
the Colonial Secretary, dated 17th March, 1870, invited attention “to a subject which,
under present circumstances, may become of large and immediate importance to the
interests of the Colony.” As this letter contains a great deal of information of much
value, I append a copy [Appmdix, No. 1] ; but I beg to quote one or two passages, to
which I wish to invite particular attention: “ It is manifest that silk-growing in these
colonies, once established or fairly set going, would give lucrative employment to large
numbers of persons of both sexes, and tend greatly to elevate as well as to enrich them ;
time was when the peasants of Europe were, at least, as unimpressionable and as difficult
to receive new ideas as our own wide and thinly-spread population is now supposed to
be. Such as our colonists are, we may, at least, consider that, if worthy of being entrusted
with political power, they are not unworthy, by reason of their want of intelligence, of
having suchattention bestowed on their welfare as may,in some degree,make up to themfor
the disadvantages under which people who live in the bush necessarily labour. In truth,
our distant settlers have yet few benefits conferred upon them, and any new export raised
in any part of the Colony enriches not only the producers, but is capital gained to the
community ;” and “my operations have all been carried out by myself, unsupported by
any extraneous aid; what I have effected alone and single handed is work that, in every
other country where any parallel success has been accomplished, has been done by
Governments with the resources and at the cost of the State. I take no reproach to
myself for not having before communicated with you on this subject; and I think that
the very fact of my having effected what I have done without assistance is valid argument
why Governments should be very reticent in taking up every likely scheme for pro-
moting new industries ; but now that success is a demonstrated fact, and the opportunity
so good, I venture to suggest to you that it may be sound policy not to ignore the experi-
ence and knowledge gained.” * * * “I, therefore, shall be happy, should you determine
to pursue the matter, to afford you without reserve any information you may be in
need of and any personal assistance I can render. The Government already possesses
several useful varieties of mulberry, and other silk-producing plants at the Botanic
Gardens, and I would willingly supply other varieties in my possession in which they
are deficient. In regard to the silkworms themselves the case is difficult; besides myself
there is no one in the Colony, as far as I am aware, qualified to judge of their value.
It by no means follows that what succeeds with me will do equally well with inexperi-
enced and perhaps careless or clumsy hands ; hence I am not disposed to risk the
liability to reproach or to be held responsible for the possible failures of others. Should
you, therefore, approve of my suggestion, and accept as a free gift from me such stock
as may be required, I will, on timely notice, furnish any quantity of acclimatised silkworms
or silkworms eggs of any varieties, races, or species I possess that may be needful to


spread the culture throughout the Colony, I say as a free gift, as this will relieve me
to some extent from discomfort in case of an unsatisfactory result. If the worms perished
or did not turn out well the loss would be mine, and if, as I think we may reasonably
hope, they take a fair hold on the country, I entertain no doubt a liberal Legislature, in
due time would mark its sense of service.”
In the year 1869, a despatch was received by the Colonial Secretary from Earl
Granville enclosing a copy of the proceedings and resolutions to establish the Silk Supply
Association of London. A meeting of gentlemen connected with the silk trade, manu-
facturers and persons interested in the English colonies, was held on 18th February,
1869, and an association was formed for several purposes, one of the most important
being to “ stimulate the production of silk by cottage cultivation and otherwise, in every
country where the mulberry is capable of growing food for silkworms.” The reason
for this was “ for fully seventeen years the silk trade of Europe had been suffering
from the spread of infectious silkworm diseases, and the crisis had now become so acute
that on 18th February, 1869, the Silk Supply Association was formed in London to
take measures for the arrest of the fcvil and to promote silk farming in every (English)
country devoted to the growth of the mulberrj'.” The silk manufacturers in England
became greatly alarmed lest the supply of silk to feed their extensive mills should cease
altogether. “The effect of these diseases was gradually to curtail the annual crop
of silk available for international commerce until a point was reached when the silk
industry of the world was threatened with extinction. Previously to the disaster
reaching such a point of acuteness, Italian savants had endeavoured by researches and
suggestions to save the trade from collapse, but with little practical result. Pasteur
afterwards took the difficult matter in hand, and to the discoveries and recommendations
of that eminent physiologist and chemist, all sericulturists owe the great change for the
better which has lately occurred.”
It is a remarkable fact which does not seem to have been properly appreciated
(owing possibly to the glory which surrounded Pasteur’s subsequent Avonderful
researches and discoveries), that during the time such a miserable state of affairs, as
abovementioned, existed in all silk-producing countries, Ave had in this Colony pure
bred races of the old original stock of silkAVorms perfectly free from diseases of any
kind, owing to the careful experiments and exertions of Mr. Charles Brady, wdro had
succeeded in eliminating all traces of disease. Dr. George Bennett, M.D., Hon.
Secretary, Acclimatisation Society of New South AUales, Avriting to Her Majesty’s
Minister at Florence, 18th May, 1870, referring to this matter said “It is well for me
to explain that the subject (the raising of silk and silkw'orm graine in the Colony) is
not quite a new one to us, and under the immediate observations of this Society some
remarkable experiments have been carried on here continuously for several years last,
past. Diseased and Aveak Avorms have been introduced by Mr. Charles Brady from
Europe, and from elseAvhere others sound but more or less inferior in quality. Some of
this diseased and feeble stock after treatment by him for several generations in
this climate, haA r e, under the influence of fresh food groAvn in the neAV soils of this
Colony, gradually improved in constitution, and some breeds even appear to afford
reasonable hope of becoming perfectly sound and ultimately restored to the original
vigour of the parent stock before the disease appeared.
Dr. Wallace, a well-kown authority in England on silkAvorms, in a series of articles
on silk-culture published in “ Cassell’s Technical Educator,” says, “ The Cape, California,
New' Zealand, and Australia are also specially favoured districts. In fact, the disease is
eliminated and quite disappears under proper treatment in the latter country. Mr.
Chas. Brady, of Sydney, Ncav South Wales, Avrites, ‘ The mulberry of all varieties thrives
here remarkably w r ell; and I have every reason to believe that the silk\Amrms may, even
if severely diseased on introduction, become quite sound by proper treatment under our
invigorating atmosphere. My experiments haA'e been uniformly successful in regard
to eliminating disease.’ I have myself received from Mr. Brady, eggs of a celebrated


European race (Milanaise), now very subject in Europe to disease, which have been
pronounced, after microscopic examination by skilled experts, to be perfectly free from
all signs of disease. It is specially desirable to renovate the old races of Bomhyx mori
which have been ennobled in former generations for the quality of their produce but
which are now nearly exterminated from the prevalance of disease—by importing graine
into new localities where disease is unknown. Settlers in Australia, New Zealand, and
similiar localities should specially consider what great pecuniary advantages are offered
to them from this branch of sericulture.”
It is hardly possible to realise, at the present day, the immense importance that
the results of Mr. Brady's experiments would have been to the silk industry of the
world, had Pasteur’s investigations either not been made, or had failed altogether, for
then the silk producers would not have been enabled to combat, more or less suc-
cessfully, the diseases which at one time threatened to annihilate the silk industry.
The industry would have been saved and New South Wales would now, most certainly,
be one of the most important silk-producing countries in the world.
Healthy silkworm graine or eggs became extremely scarce and costly, so much
so that as much as £3 3s. per ounce was obtained for eggs from this Colony. Such
being the case prospects seemed most favourable for the establishment here of an
important and profitable industry, namely, that of graining or the breeding of silkworms
for the production of eggs cr graine for export. Several persons about this time made
mulberry plantations, and some did this, I believe, with a view to produce eggs only.
One of the best known of these persons was the late Mrs. Bladen Neill, of Corowa,
who took a most active interest in sericulture, her object being “ to aid in the enlarge-
ment of the silk-growing industry in Australia and New Zealand, not only for the
advantages of the colonies themselves, but with a view of adding to the sources from
which the English manufacturers draw their supplies of silk, and also to provide such
means of new employment for women, and particularly for poor educated women, as
may be properly connected with silk-growing.” Her motives Avere greatly inspired by
philanthropic reasons, but her admirable intentions and over-sanguine expectations were
never realised. The Government of Victoria either granted to, or reserved for, the
Victorian Ladies’ Silk Association, presided over by Mrs. Neill, 1,000 acres of land
at Mount Alexander, near Castlemaine, said to be an unsuitable locality, where a
number of mulberry cuttings were planted. Mrs. Bladen Neill made a plantation of
mulberries at her farm at Corowa, Ncav South Wales, another unsuitable locality, where
the dust from a wide dusty road caused the mulberry leaves to become dirty and unsuit-
able for food for the silkworms ; but I believe this plantation was more successful than
that at Mount Alexander. Sir Samuel Davenport, of South Australia, when examined
before the Vegetable Products Commission of Victoria, referring to Mrs. Bladen Neill’s
attempts and failure, said, “ I know that in your country, some years ago, a celebrated
lady, Mrs. Neill, with a great deal of enthusiasm went into the subject, and studied in
Italy, and so on. I used to correspond with her, and knew something of Avhat she was
doing, but in that case, unfortunately, it seemed to me, they went into the production of
a large quantity of silkworms long before they had food for them. Now a star\ r ed
animal of any class, a sheep, a bullock, or a silkworm can never do any good without
food, and the first thing to grow is the mulberry in large quantities.” A very cele-
brated authority on the silkworm, Captain Thomas Hutton, E.G.S., &c., in a pamphlet
published at Calcutta in 1870, “ Bemarks on the cultivation of silk in the Australian
colonies,” wrote, “ The sericulturist who begins to tremble at the probable outlay before
anything is done, had better not begin the speculation at all ; for I feel fully convinced
that many of the failures recorded have been due rather to the stinginess of the specu-
lator than to anything else. It is as well, therefore, at the very outset, to lay it down
as a rule that experiments of this nature carried on in a ‘ shilly-shally, fiddle faddle ’
scale can never succeed, and that it is the most wretched economy imaginable to stint
the worms in anything that is conducive to their welfare. It is, in fact, precisely this
very stinginess on the part of the ryots that causes the silkAvorms of Bengal to produce
such poor cocoons.”


A writer in the Sydney Morning Herald , 1869, said, “ Silkworms were introduced
here some years ago ; but the venture failed, in the first place because no market was
open for the cocoons and silk ; in the second because the persons who undertook the
business were imperfectly informed of what was to be done to insure success.
The market now appears to be accessible through the agency of the Association,
and all we now require is the knowledge of which I speak. If this can be imparted in
the way suggested all will be plain sailing, or rather plain winding, for the mulberry will
grow anywhere in New South Wales.”
In Queensland, about 1874-5, great results were expected from a large private
sericultural venture; but in consequence of a want of practical knowledge in the
management of silkworms, failure resulted.
A most disastrous failure in New South Wales, was that of a well-designed,
private, and energetic attempt, at Lavington, near Albury, by Messrs. Affleck and
Howard. In 1880 the newspapers reported that great loss had occurred with the silk-
worms. In the season of 1882 another loss occurred, and this was attributed to a sudden
climatic change ; but at last, in 1883, the truth became known. In May, 1883, the
Town and Country Journal reported : —“ Mentioned with regret. Tor the past eight
years the mulberry farms at Lavington have been one of the lions of the district, to all
interested in the development of the sericultural industry. Mr. Thomas Affleck, of
Glenmorns, was the first to commence the industry, and he has now a large area under
mulberry-trees. Mr. John Howard followed soon after, and both of these gentlemen
have devoted a great deal of time and money to a purpose which, after all, is not likely
to be accomplished. Year after year they met with different obstacles, but persevered
in the hope that the succeeding season would bring them a reward for their labours.
This year they confidently reckoned upon a successful rearing, but once more the whole
of the worms were carried off by Pebrine, and I understand the experiments will be
discontinued. This is a cause for regret, but not for surprise, as both gentlemen have
been heavy losers by the enterprise. The cause of the failure is said to be the difficulty
in procuring good graine. If this could be overcome, Sericulture might become a
profitable industry on the Border.”
The disease mentioned, “ Pebrine,” is most dangerous and contagious, and one
of the worst of the diseases which spread through the silk-producing countries, as before
mentioned. In an experiment in Asia Minor, made with dust from nurseries in which
silkworms had died the previous year. “ After sifting and mixing a few particles -with
distilled water, a microscopical examination revealed hundreds of corpuscles upon each
disc. Some of the same dust was then sifted over mulberry leaves, and given to silkworms
in different ages, when, after two or three days, the mortality in every instance was found
to be very great.” The report as to the difficulty in obtaining good graine seems
remarkable, in view of the fact that we possessed in the Colony, at the time, some of the
best and most healthy graine in the world. The fact was, I believe, that diseased graine
had been imported from Europe. A lady, who had seen these mulberry plantations at
their best, informed me that the variety of mulberry planted was the Morus multicaulis.
This is by no means one of the best kinds for general feeding.
In the year 1864, a Mr. Jno. M. Bate, of Sydney, published a small pamphlet on
silk-cultivation, and dedicated it to his Excellency Sir John Young. In this little work
Mr. Bate says, “I have mentioned in my letters, published in the Sydney papers, that in
one season, many years ago, that with a very limited supply of food, my two brothers
and myself reared silkworms that produced upwards of 10 lb. weight of wound silk —all
the operation, from the hatching to the winding having been done by ourselves under
many difficulties, from want of food, suitable accommodation, &c., &c., with the sole
assistance of a man to cull the leaves (who had to go all over Sydney to get them) ; and
this was done without interfering with our ordinary studies or employments. The
cocoons were as large, firm, and as heavy as I believe are produced in the most favoured
parts of Europe, and the yeild of silk was equally good.”


Dr. George Bennett, M.D., interested himself considerably in the establishment
of sericulture in this Colony. Writingto the Colonial Secretary on the 7th June, 1870,
he said, “ To direct attention and impart a knowledge of facts about the rearing of silk-
worms the present time seems very appropriate. First, the extremely critical condition
of all European breeds gives the gravest reason to fear that if they experience adverse
weather another year the whole may become utterly extinct, or for all practical purposes
so unavailable for stock to breed from that all the European silk-producing countries
will, of necessity, have recourse to importations of eggs from other countries where the
disease affecting the silkworms does not exist or is less severe.” Dr. Bennett then
refers to a very remarkable discovery made by Mr. Charles Brady, one of such import-
ance that if it can be made use of in this Colony in the event of sericulture becoming
established it will make an immense difference in favour of profits. Secondly “ writes
Dr. Bennett” the well-known operations of Mr. Brady in the Colony have already caused
considerable attention to be directed to Australia, and the very remarkable system
originated by that gentleman and carried on from time to time during several years
under the observations of this society, of producing a succession of daily broods and
crops of silk during a great part of our long season is highly encouraging. This very
important fact, so honorable, and, if rightly understood, so calculated to do good to the
Colony, was thus commented on by Mr. Dickens, President of the Silk Supply Associa-
tion, of London, at a public meeting held at Coventry. “ The fact of producing silk
day by day was most wonderful, and was what was not done in any other part of the
world, and Mr. Chadwick, M.P., at the same meeting took occasion to say in reference
to this Australian plan ‘that the daily production of silk which would be as important a
fact as ever occurred in the silk trade.’ Thirdly, there are now most excellent varieties
of silkworms in the colony from which beginners could be supplied wherewith to commence
the creation of a new export.” In a paper read before the Society of Arts in London,
26 April, 1876, Mrs. Bladen Neill referred to the same subject thus, “No account of
silk culture in Australia would be complete without a tribute of praise to the unwearied
and scientific labours of Mr. Charles Brady, of Antony, Tweed Eiver, New South Wales,
who has devoted his life to the study and improvement of silk culture. We owe to him
the means of producing successive and daily hatchings at pleasure, as well as the
introduction into Australia of the best races of silkworms known ; these will doubtless
produce in time. Ho probably knows more about silkworms than any man living.”
Many attempts have been made to effect this artificial hybernation, but no one has
succeeded but Mr. Brady, and to him only the art is known.
Dr. Bennett referred to the “best races of silkworms,” so that I take the
opportunity, here, to invite attention to the great importance of breeding and rearing
silkworms of only the very best kinds ; and I will also invite attention, presently,
to the extraordinary increase that has been effected in the production of silk, when
proper intelligence and skill are brought to bear on the breeding, the selecting, and the
improving of silkworms.
Mr. Brady resided for many years near the Tweed Eiver, where, on his farm, he
planted and tested a great many varieties of the mulberry, in order to determine the
best and most suitable kinds for the locality, because different climates affect the value
of varieties ; and, at the same time, he perfected his “Australian races” of silkworms,
and kept them up to the highest standard, prepared at any time to undertake the
supervision of the sericultural industry, which he was led to expect would be carried on,
or initiated by the Government. He long since proved the extraordinary suitableness
of the north-eastern coastal districts of the Colony for sericulture ; and this has lately
been substantiated by recent developments at “ New Italy,” near the Eichmond
to which I shall refer more particularly later on,
The establishment of hardy races of silkworms which are absolutely free from
disease, and which produce a uniformity of cocoons, and consequently silk, is, I may
mention, of the utmost consequence for commercial purposes. The same amount of


labour is required to produce cocoons of poor quality, as is needed for the production of
the very best; in fact an experienced sericulturist informed me that “it costs more
to produce a bad cocoon than it does a good one.” In order to make this matter
perfectly clear, I must refer to a circumstance which took place in another country.
At one lime a very large silk industry was carried on near Smyrna, in Asia Minor,
but it became well nigh if not totally ruined by the effects of the silkworm diseases
which had spread through the district, and nearly all the mulberry plantations were
cut down and destroyed. But, “ through the almost herculean and untiring exertions of
an English gentleman, Mr. John Griffith during long and anxious years, the silkworm
diseases had been combated and throttled one by one, by the aid of science, the
dissecting knife, the mortar, and the microscope, and latterly by following up the
brilliant discoveries of M. Pasteur of the Institute of Erance.”
“Some years ago,” said Mr, Griffitt, “I obtained aquantity of indigenous graine of a
very fine race, but unfortunately it was much diseased. I raised the worms the moment
they were hatched in separate cells in order that those contaminated might not infect the
healthy, and from the few sound specimens I acquired my present robust race which I have
since continued to improve. It is in everyway superior to all the other varieties I have raised,
not only in vigour but likewise in the weight of the cocoon and quality of silk it yields.
Erom 1 oz. (of 30 grains of eggs) I obtain regularly from 150 to 155 lb. of fresh cocoons,l2
lb. of which, taken from the bushes where they have spun, produce over 1 lb. of silk of
the finest quality, while the loss in double cocoons is only from 4 to G per cent., whereas
that connected with other races has proved to be from 15 to 30 per cent.” This
improved race seems to have been still further improved, judging from the following,
according to Mr. Cochran: —“Thesilk harvest at Bournabat, and wherever Mr. Griffitt’s
graine was distributed last spring was of the most satisfactory character. That gentle-
man’s privately conducted ‘education’ of oz. yielded 60,000 worms, all of which arrived
at maturity without exhibiting a trace of disease and spun the extraordinary weight of
93 okes of" cocoons or 255 lb., equal to the unprecedented return of 170 lb. per ounce
of eggs set to hatch. The average crop of the adjoining farmers and peasants, although
not so great, having been 42 okes or 115 lb. is still far ahead of recent returns from
Europe. These figures according to M. Maillot, Director of Sericulture at Montpellier,
for the French Government are,—from Italy 23 kilogrammes (62 lb.) and from Erance
28 kilogrammes (77 lb.) per ounce of eggs. If such returns are good from the two
great silk farming countries of Europe, in what category are the magnificent crops of
Mr. Griffitt and his friends to be placed ?” It will be seen that Mr. Griffiths improved
races yield almost three times the weight of cocoons from an ounce of eggs or graine as
is produced from the same weight of eggs of the unimproved races of silkworms in
Italy and considerably more than twice as much as is produced in France. This is an
excellent illustration of what can be accomplished by great skill and knowledge applied
to the breeding and selecting of silkworms, but it can hardly he understood in New
South Wales where the silkworm, unfortunately, is considered nothing hut a toy.
However, when a similar system is applied to the breeding of cattle, sheep, or pigs its
importance can be appreciated. “When we as a people” wrote a contributor to the
Town and Country Journal “cease to regard the industry as infra dir/, or child’s play, and
acknowledge to ourselves that we are not a sufficiently intelligent people to be good
silk growers we shall be on the right tack towards taking it up successfully. The tool
will come to the hand that can use it, and this great staple of production with all its
wonderful power of attaching small proprietors to the soil, dotting Hie land with happy
homes and thus helping to form a substantial yeomanry, will open its mine of wealth to
us when we have shown ourselves capable of working it.”
The French Government has been taking active measures lately to encourage
silk-production as well as of silk-reeling as will be seen from the following “Edict of
4th April, 1892, containing instructions relative to carrying into effect the law of 13th
January, 1892, to give special encouragement to sericulture, which is as follows : —For


six years to come silk growers or raisers of silkworms shall be given a bonus of sd.
per kilogramme of cocoons and the manufacturers a bonus on a graduated scale per
filature in proportion to the work done annually, which will also be on a sliding scale, &c.”
It seems very evident from this and other articles published officially, that the
silkworm diseases have by no means been overcome. In some of the silk-producing
districts the returns of silk are decreasing, and the yield is so small as barely|to give a profit.
In New South Wales, several prominent and well-known citizens "have from time
to time taken a great interest in sericulture, and have exerted themselves to encourage
the industry. Amongst them were the late Mr. Thos. S. Mort, the late Mr. Henry
Prince, the late Mr. George Thorne, the late Mr. James Manning [see Appendix, No. 3.],
Dr. Gleorge Bennett, and Messrs. Eobt. D. Adams and J. K. Fry. I heard Mr. Mort on
several occasions publicly express his views with respect to sericulture, and he seemed to
be very much impressed with the feeling that it would become a great industry in the
colony, and that it was worthy of every encouragement. The visitors’ book at the
Eaudwick Destitute Children’s Asylum bears the following remark by that gentleman dated
13 August, 1861, written with reference to experiments in sericulture made by the late
Mr. May then Superintendent. “My ramble over this admirable home has given me the
greatest pleasure. I strongly commend to its promoters the extensive planting of the
silkworm mulberry, believing as I do that the Institution may be made the ‘ nucleus ’ of a
silk growing population, an occupation that would render the Institution self supporting,
besides being the means of adding immensely to our national wealth.”
The Agricultural Society of New South Wales took up the matter of sericulture
warmly during the years 1869 to 1874, and published considerable useful information in
its Journal and offered prizes for silk at its exhibitions. However, after 1874, interest
in the subject appears to have declined and eventually ceased. A useful diagram of
instructions, showing silkworms in their various stages, published at the Government
Printing Office, was distributed by the Society in 1871. I obtained a copy at the time
and still have it.
A collection of cocoons was either lent or given to the Society by Mr. Brady in
1871, who wrote, “I have sent to the Agricultural Society for inspection a collection of
cocoons. lam doubtful whether lam not going too far in advance of public intelligence.
There has been so little earnestness showm, and so general a smallness of mind as to the
nature of the silk industry, I am indisposed to trouble myself any more about the
public. It is, therefore, out of regard to yourselves and the few who do take an
intelligent interest in what has been done, and who comprehend the good it must do to
the Colony, that I have taken the trouble to put the cocoons together. They show above
view about half a hundred diffierent kinds. Each cocoon represents a separate variety,
and being in juxtaposition, the diffierent characters of each are very apparent. All have
been reared at this place during the season j ust concluded, and you must remember what a
season we had for bad weather, and other disadvantages, you may in some degree
understand the amount of labour and constant attention it has required to rear them.
Each kind and breed has been reared separate and on its appropriate food. Here you
see in results part of what we have been able to accomplish, and in these results the
absolute demonstration of all the capabilities of the country for this the most
lucrative of all pursuits. People can also see we are long past the time of experiment,
that not only is the foundation completed but the superstructure well forward. You
will observe in the cocoons themselves signs which indicate in some perfect health and
in others weakness. You must understand that I have always confined my attention
to improving the health and the constitution of the worms (for every one of the
European varieties, without exception, was severely diseased when imported) and
naturalising them to the Colony. No attention was or could be given to rear for silk,
indeed, the two are to a great degree incompatible, for in rearing for graine, that is
healthy stock, you must avoid the processes most advantageous in rearing for silk.
The cocoons show the particular characteristics of the respective types. I write this
letter entirely in the interests of the Society and intending silk growers.”


Cochran writing sixteen years after Mr. Brady in 1887 says, “ but a large educa-
tion and a considerable production of eggs are clearly incompatible with a copious
harvest of silk. In other words, the farmer should make up his mind at an early point
in his technical career whether he will devote his energies to the first branch or the last.”
Of the gentlemen mentioned who took a great interest in sericulture, the late
Mr. George Thorne and Mr. J, K. Pry, practically tested its suitability for the Colony
and encouraged its establishment as much as possible.
Mr. George Thorne, devoted a great deal of time and labour to the matter, and,
up to his death, which occurred about eighteen months ago, took a very keen interest in
the subject and aided as much as he could its initiation at “New Italy,” and his
daughter, Miss Thorne, has continued his work, but not to the same extent. This work
was begun and carried on for some years at Hose Bay, near Sydney, and at first
Mr. Thorne had considerable difficulty in procuring a sufficiency of food for his silk-
worms. He afterwards removed to Castle Hill, and carried on his work more
extensively as soon as his mulberry-trees had attained sufficient size. Several varieties
were planted, but the Morus alba was the kind chiefly dependent on for a supply of
food. A most careful record of experiments and results was kept, and this must be
of considerable value. Silkworm graine (or eggs) was obtained from Europe and America,
and Mr. Thorne was very successful with it; but on one or two occasions “ Pebrine” broke
out amongst the worms, and all those affected were destroyed at once. Mr. Thorne
exhibited on many occasions, both cocoons and reeled silk at exhibitions in the colonies
and elsewhere and gained several medals for his excellent exhibits ; notably a gold
medal at Amsterdam in 1883, and bronze medals at the Indian and Colonial Exhibition
in 1886; the United States Centennial in 1876 ; Melbourne International in 1888 ;
Agricultural Society in 1876 and 1877.
Mr. Thorne took considerable trouble to disseminate useful information respecting
sericulture wherever he could do so. He strongly urged the settlers, fruitgrowers, and
others in his immediate neighbourhood to plant a few mulberries and make a little
addition to their incomes by silk-culture, but either from apathy or a fear that there would
be a difficulty in finding a market for any silk produced, no one seems to have entered into
the industry. There are a few trees here and there and a few silkworms are kept for
amusement or curiosity. But latterly some little interest appears to have been aroused,
and Miss Thorne receives many inquiries about the rearing of silkworms. Last year she
distributed directions and young silkworms, just hatched, to about twenty persons in
various parts of the Colony, and during the present season nearly as many. Many
inquiries have also been made respecting a market for cocoons. The public schools are
taking some interest in the matter and apply for information. At the Baulkham Hills
School the children have been keeping the worms for some time.
Mr. J. K. Ery made many most useful experiments extending over many years,
and as these were done with a view to determine whether silk-culture could be made a
profitable industry in the Colony, the results of his experience must necessarily be of
very considerable Value. I may "say that Mr. Ery thinks highly of sericulture and that
if it were but once started on a proper foundation it would be profitable and ultimately
become an immense industry. He insists, particularly, on persons having a knowledge
of the subject before trying to rear silkworms.
In my many inquiries into the possibilites of sericulture becoming an industry in
New South Wales, I have met many other intelligent and far seeing persons who have
a thorough belief in its suitableness for the Colony, and who are of opinion that it will
be profitable if it once becomes well established and, as it w T ere, “ catches on.”
There are others, however, well intentioned, no doubt, but who have really never
thoroughly understood or mastered the subject, who insist persistently that the want of
suitable cheap labour in the Colony is a sufficient preventive to the industry ever becoming
profitable. This bugbear is invariably, and too often, dangled as a deterrent before the
eyes of those who are willing to enter upon, or assist in promoting, the industry. This


bugbear or delusion can, I believe, be disposed of and cleared away without difficulty.
I have been exceedingly careful to look into this question fully, and one result is, that
so far as I can possibly ascertain, none of the failures which have occurred in any efforts
to establish silk-culture have been caused by a want of labour. Mrs. Bladen A T eill, in
her lecture delivered before the Society of Arts in London (which I previously referred
to) said, “ The very important question of labour remains only to be mentioned, and it
may perhaps surprise you all to hear that an education” (the rearing of silkworms)
■‘upon the rapid Cavalloni system can be made at considerably less cost in Australia
than in Italy, and I say this from practical experience, having resided on a large estate
near A erona last season, when 1 studied the cost of everything connected with silk-
growing. I could not have had a better master than Signor Ferrari, upon whose estate
silk is so largely cultivated; his reputation for what is considered high farming indeed
is widespread, his vineyards are perfect pictures of beauty.”
Mr. J. Grriffitt, of Smyrna, before referred to, wrote “ The loss suffered by Turkey
since 1857 is incalculable. I remember the time when the wife of every gardener in the
vicinity of Smyrna obtained, from her crop of cocoons; a sufficient return to enable her
to pay for the clothing of her family for the entire year, but disease swept away our
beautiful indigenous races, and this branch of industry was almost wholly abandoned.”
It seems to me that it would be quite practical for the wives of many struggling settlers
in this Colony to earn the same results if sericulture were but established here, and
proper instruction afforded to all who wish to learn. A few pounds sterling, 10 or
even 5 per annum indeed be welcome to many a poor wife, especially when it
could be gained, without interfering to a great extent with household duties, in about
six weeks, for during the greater part of that time the labour of attending to the silk-
worms is but light.
. . Mr. C. A . Eiley, M.A., Ph. D., entomologist to the American Government,
writing on the subject of sericulture, wrote “ The greater value of labour here as com-
pared with labour in the older silk-growing countries has been in the past a most
serious obstacle to silk-culture in the United States, but conditions exist to-day that
rendei this obstacle by no means insuperable. In the first place comparative prices, as
so often quoted, are misleading. The girl who makes only 20 or 30 cents a day in
Trance or Italy does as well, because of the relatively lower prices of all commodities
there, as she who earns three or four fold as much here. Again, the conditions of life
are such that every woman among the agricultural classes, not absolutely necessary in
the household, a profitable avenue for her labour in field or factory, so that’the
time given to silk raising must be deducted from other profitable work in which she may
be employed. A\ r ith us, on the contrary, there are thousands—aye hundreds of
thousands of women who, from our very condition of life, are unable to labour in the
field or factory, and have, in short, no means, outside of household duties, of converting
labour into capital. The time that such might give to silk-culture would therefore be a
pure gain, and in this sense the cheap labour argument loses nearly all its force.” I might
mention here that the Americans aim at producing “raw silk” to use in their silk
manufactories instead of importing it from other countries, but I shall refer to this more
particularly later on.
M**- J- K. Fry tested very carefully the cost of producing cocoons, and in his
evidence before a Select Committee, on Mr. Brady’s claims, said, “To my mind, the
labour difficulty is no difficulty. One season I resolved that I should do everything
myself and have no assistance. From the getting up in the morning until the last feed
at night 1 did everything. I collected the leaves from my ground, I fed the worms, I
cleaned them, and did everything. Then it simply became a matter of arithmetic. If
one man can attend to so many thousand silkworms, ten men can attend to ten times
le number or more, because division of labour would materially help. I know it
jccame perfectly clear to my mind that the labour difficulty was no difficulty.”


E. C. Haldane in “ Subtropical climates and industries,” says, referring to silk
culture, “ The industry is one which is very well adapted for families who wish to
increase their incomes by a few weeks of light and interesting work which may easily be
performed by women and children. As it is the general custom for the daughters of
small settlers to stay at home rather than go to service, sericulture offers employment
for girls of this class, which would enable them to add a considerable sum to the family
income.”
It is worthy of mention here that when about three years ago I visited
Mr. Brady at the Tweed Eiver, in connection with my report on his claims, he informed
me that the education or rearing of silkworms took considerably less time than it does
in Europe —a difference of several days, and this was confirmed lately by the Italians
at “New Italy,” who expressed to me their great surprise and pleasure to find that the
work of rearing their silkworms took considerably less time than was the case in Italy.
This is of much importance when considering the labour question. There are many other
and natural advantages which we enjoy, which should also be taken into consideration.
As bearing greatly upon the supposed labour difficulty, it is now necessary for
me to explain, that the most profitable kinds of silkworms are those known as the
“ Annuals,” which produce only once a year a crop of cocoons. They then become
moths, lay their eggs and die. There are other races known as Bi-voltines, Tri-voltines,
&c., which produce, some two, others three crops, and so on, during a year; but the
silk produced by them is of inferior quality to that produced by the Annuals, and the
cocoons yield a much less quantity of silk. The Annuals, therefore, are the silkworms
depended on and reared to produce the largest proportion of silk by far in the world.
By the process of artificial hybernation, discovered by Mr. Brady, and previously referred
to by me, a crop of Annuals can be produced at any time during the year at pleasure, so
that a periodica] or continuous “ education” of silkworms may be carried on whenever
there is available food, or as long as food may be available. Mr. Brady exhibited at the
Colonial and Indian Exhibition, London, 1886, silkworm cocoons, partially sun dried.
Ordinary growth of the country for the production of silkworm graine only, and in
connection with this exhibit was appended the following information, which is of value,
as it explains the matter very clearly: —“The labour difficulty (a purely supposititious
difficulty) has until now forbidden production of cocoons for silk —the production of
first-class graine is incompatible in the same rearing with the production of first-class
cocoons for silk. "With proper attention, together with appropriate food, treatment,
<fec., the same silkworms yield more silk for filature than if * educated ’ for graine.
Hitherto, the production of graine has been so profitable as to preclude attention to the
raising of cocoons at Antony.
“ The great inducement to enterprise, the culture of the mulberry silkworm in
New South Wales, is the long proved power of the climate and country, as exemplified
by the practice of the exhibitor for many consecutive years to provide and hatch out,
day by day, or week by week, month by month, or at any rate, predeterminal intervals as
desiderated, continuous successions of strictly annual worms of any approved breeds for
about 200 days in each year, and also, to provide proper food-leaf in proper condition at
the proper time throughout, thereby greatly extending, in fact, creating a factory
system of production. Thus a number of rearings can be arranged beforehand according
to the strength of the working staff, and with the available supply of mulberry leaf
for food.
“Then after a certain number of days or periods corresponding to arrangements,
and assuming that the management of the graine has been duly attended to the proper
time, it necessarily follows that after the necessary time from commencement for
the growth to maturity of the worms and at prescribed intervals, be these intervals days
or weeks, continuous hatchings out presents the strange and unparalleled phenomena
peculiar to New South Wales of mulberry silkworms in every daily or periodical stage
of progression. Those of one day’s hatching and each succeeding day’s hatchings (every
B


day’s must be kept severely separate) up to the moment of cocooning—that is worms o£
every age and daily growth during and through every moult —the cocooning and all the
several changes of form (metamorphosis) simultaneously in like daily and contem-
poraneous succession, and so on in like manner and equal steps, the emerging and
coupling of the moths and deposit of eggs (the graine again) until operations are finally
closed for the season, when the staff employed can respite for a winter spell and
themselves recruit, while refit and preparations are made for another season. So on
each and every day, at its due date —a crop of silk —immediately convertible into cash.”
“ Thus the whole course of the natural life history of the domesticated mulberry
silkworm is here seen at one and the same moment—worms of every age and size from
one day old to full grown ones mature and making their cocoons —also are seen at
the same time the moths emerging, and the eggs again, daily, during the whole period
foreshadowed and arranged beforehand. In the hands of a skilled person the process is
as much under control as the machinery of a factory, kept alive, going and maintained
by nature’s own action by means of this silkworm’s only natural food —the mulberry leaf.”
“ This food from mulberries of many varieties is in this climate produced in great
abundance, and under judicious management is easily made to furnish daily, from end of
July until April following, food-leaf in all stages of growth appropriate in condition for
worms in all stages of their growth. A very fertile soil—a temperature of mild frosts
(a deal too mild) in our short winter. Summer heats from about 75 degrees to 95 degrees
U. and upwards (occasionally) in shade, and a rainfall, not very unevenly (though there is
generally a sort of monsoon or ‘ wet’ season from January to April, a mostly dry winder
following) distributed throughout the year, ordinarily equal to from 1 inch to l\ inch
weekly. A bright elastic atmosphere at all times, even at night. The summer heats
ever tempered by cool breezes. These several items (of great importance in rearing
mulberry silkworms), together with the pervading influence of the abounding eucalypt,
account largely for the health, vigour, and comfort of the inhabitants as well as of the
silkworms raised in the district.” . *
“It must, however, be clearly stated that few men are capable alone of the
prolonged strain of exertion and attention necessitated by the abovenamed high-class
culture of the best or profitable kinds of the mulberry silkworm. Men of experience
and energy, or women with adequate knowledge, &c., and not stinted in the matter of
food, could every year realise very considerable sums of money if well supported by a
small, yet efficient staff to rely on, with needful labour including male and female.
Such men and women would soon find and demonstrate that the actual silk-producing
powers of Australia can be made to yield, at no distant date, results in no way inferior
to the raw production of wool.”
“ Wool is produced in this country (New South Wales) mainly from natural
grasses without care or cultivation, under conditions subject to many and severe vicissi-
tudes ; it gives constant employment to a comparatively small amount of labour for one
annual crop. Silk by the process roughly outlined above would afford constant occupa-
tion for large numbers of people, old and young, from the pick and shovel man up to
the trained and skilled agriculturist. Cocoons in vast quantities would be carried to
market—the fruit of intelligent management and control of the powers of vegetation
and insect life such as we actually have them. Simply told, we can produce at conveni-
ence as many crops of silk as we can utilise all the food provided without waste.
Mulberry plantations (mulberries sustain a deal of drought, and of heat, and of cold)
are immensely more profitable than land under grass —are permanent —yearly increase
in yield and in value of the yield as they grow for a very long while—this cultivated food
is reliable, besides being cheaper than indigenous or natural herbage, and will supply under
proper management without injury, repeated demands for the insects.”
“ The methods here sketched of the routine of daily practice of the exhibitor,
illustrates the ‘ marvellous power of little things.’ This art of multiplying small results
might, if encouraged and developed, yield fiscal returns of immense material importance.


The mere fact of a faculty which may he termed merely brain power, with a slight extra
outlay of capital, or of the farmer’s own labour only, of multiplying results large or
small at his own will, would, at the very least, greatly encourage and turn to profitable
account much mental and bodily labour, besides material, now and up to now absolutely
neglected and wasted, or extravagantly and unthriftily used. This Australian invention
of raising silk so much cheaper than can be grown elsewhere, would necessarily soon
outstrip the yields by the ancient mode current in other countries, and place this Colony
in a commanding position in the markets of the Avorld; which, adding considerably to
the present productive resources of the Colony, the prosperity of a silk industry once
established, would encourage, by a newly-created diffusion of wealth, all other existing
occupations, trades and handicrafts, and also probably cause the introduction of many
others yet unknown or strange.”
Dr. Cleland, of South Australia, has given considerable attention to sericulture
for some years. In a paper read before the members of the Central Agricultural Bureau,
6th March, 1890, he said; “Much of the profit of rearing silkworms will depend on the
possibilities of rearing more than one crop of cocoons in the same house, in the same
season. As yet I have not succeeded completely in doing so.”
It seems quite clear, that if a system of successive hatchings at will could be made
available for those who may enter upon the industry, sericulture should be very profitable,
for then the production of silk would be limited only by the supplies of food available.
In many parts of the Colony the mulberry grows with great luxuriance, parti-
cularly the northern coast districts, where some varieties become almost evergreen,
owing to the mildness and salubrity of the climate, and it yields larger supplies of food
than elsewhere, even in its own native habitat. But for sericultural purposes considerable
care and management would be necessary to produce the best results, in providing
different varieties for different purposes, in judicious pruning, and in many other matters
which I cannot venture to enter upon here.
If any settler or farmer wished to carry on sericulture as an adjunct to his other
crops, a few acres from the farm might easily be spared for mulberries, more especially
so as they would thrive and become productive in places where it would be unprofitable,
perhaps, to grow ordinary farm crops. On squattages the mulberry would be a profitable
food on occasions of the failure of natural pasture, for all kinds of stock. Cows fed on them
yield excellent milk. John Evelyn, in his “Sylva,” 1669, says, respecting the mulberry :
“The timber (amongst other properties) will last in the water as well as the most solid
oak, and the bark makes good and tough bast ropes. It suffers no kind of vermin to
breed on it, whether standing or fell’d, nor does any caterpillar attaque it save the silk-
worm only. The loppings are excellent fuel; but that for which this tree is in greatest
and most worthy esteem is for the leaves, which (besides the silkworm) nourishes cows,
sheep, and other cattell, especially young porkers, being boiled with a little bran; and
the fruit excellent to feed poultry. In summe whatever eats of them will, with
difficulty, be reduc’d to eat anything else as long as they can come by them ; to say
nothing of their other soveraign qualities, as relaxing of the belly, being eaten in the
morning, and curing inflamations and ulcers of the mouth and throat, mixed with Mel,
Hosarum, in which receipt they do best being taken before they are over-ripe.”
There would be no difficulty for any one who intends to plant mulberries to ascer-
tain near enough for practical purposes the minimum area to be planted to produce
sufficient food for the number of silkworms his available labour could attend to propexdy.
“ The average quantity of eggs in those countries (Italy and France) is now about 2
ounces for each family. Under such circumstances the European farmer is not called
upon to employ extra labour, nor are the services of the men of the family required
except during the last few days of the rearing. It will be understood that the con-
fining of this work to the women and children necessitates the planting of the mulberry-
trees in a convenient place near the house, their periodical pruning in such a shape that
their leaves can be gathered economically and quickly, and a further condition, perhaps


axiomatic, that the persons in charge of the work shall possess such experience as will
enable them to perform their labours without serious mistakes or useless friction. It
would be an imputation, which I should be far from placing upon the women of our
farming classes, to suggest that they are not as able as their sisters in Europe to become
expert silk-raisers in a short time.”
If it be determined by the Government that sericulture shall be aided, fostered,
and encouraged, it will be advisable to start the industry in two or three localities or
centres where it is most likely to take root. At each centre there must be a small
establishment where information of the very best possible sort may be available for every-
one, where instruction can be given, and the work open to view. “To raise cocoons
successfully demands very little physical strength, nor does it demand talent or skill of
a high order, but it does demand intelligence, patience, perseAmrance, and system, from
which there shall not be the slightest relaxation.” The industry would spread fast
enough from the “ Centres” as soon as the neighbouring farmers and others would be
able to recognise that there is profit in it. The more it spread, and the larger the areas
planted with mulberries, the better it would become, and the better the chances for all
connected with it of obtaining increased profits. But whilst this is being encouraged
the greatest care must be taken to avoid, and prevent the spread of exaggerated state-
ments as to the probabilities of immense profits being obtained in a very easy way, as
well as misleading calculations, for such things can only lead to disgust, and will
certainly and effectually prevent healthy progress.
In the United States report of the Secretary of Agriculture, 1890, appears the
following statement:—“ An examination of the lots received from these small raisers
shows also the difficulty of teaching them the work by the distribution of printed
matter. Our pamphlets have been prepared in accordance with the methods adopted
by the best silk-raisers of Europe, and wherever our experience has shown them to be
deficient in certain points, we have, upon the printing of a new edition, endeavoured to
bring them more into accord with the needs of our people. One of the points we have
called attention to with especial emphasis is the necessity of feeding the worms liberally
and regularly, and still of the lots which we have received, many show unmistakable
evidence of underfeeding and neglect. This is most distinctly emphasised when we
receive a lot of cocoons from one raiser which will average as large as figure A annexed,
while another raiser, with no more experience, and with eggs from the same lot, sends
an others of the size indicated in Eig. B.”
“ To the more successful one we pay about 35 cents per lb. of fresh cocoons, but
the failure is well compensated at 20 cents per lb. It is scarcely necessary to point out the
fact that poor quality and consequent low price are almost always the companions of
light weight in the crop, so that side by side we have a person who realises 10 dollars
from the cocoons produced from a quarter ounce of eggs, and another who realises less
than 1 dollar. In fact, w r e have on several occasions paid less than 10 cents for the
cocoons raised from such a grower. All of this emphasises the fact that, if silk-culture
is to be established in the United States, it is absolutely necessary that means should be
taken to come into actual contact with our people in order to teach them to raise silk-
worms successfully. There seems to be no better way than by the establishment of a
few model rearing rooms, where silkworms can be properly raised every season in the
full view of everybody who chooses to examine into the industry. There might be
created several centres from which the industry could be spread over such portions of


the country as are climatically adopted for it. At present far more harm is being
accomplished by assisting would-be silk-raisers to make inevitable failures, and thus
augmenting the number of persons who believe, beyond all power of persuasion, that
silk-culture is a delusion and a snare to the unwary agriculturist.”
In many parts of New South Wales the settlers are sadly in need of some crop
to take the places of those which do not pay, or which yield such small profits as hardly
to be worth the growing; for instance, maize is a crop which, in many localities, barely
pays the grower, but it is persevered with, simply from the fact that the farmers know
of nothing better to take its place. I find, on referring to the Statistical Register for
1891, that the average yield for the northern coast districts w r as as follows : —•
Richmond River 3445 bushels per acre.
Clarence „ ... ... ... ... 3048 ~ ~
Grafton ... ... ... ... ... 3G'BS „ ~
Macleay ... ... .. ... ... 37G9 „ ~
Hastings and Manning ... ... ... 3632 „ „
General average for the above districts, 3G'SL ; and I find that the average yield
for the whole Colony is but 32 - 77 bushels.
The yield of sugar-cane also averages very low :
Richmond River ... ... ... ... 23'G4 tons per acre.
Clarence „ ... ... ... ... 1766 „ „
Grafton ... ... ... ... ... 28T2 „ „
Macleay River ... ... ... 33 02 „ „
The general average being 2L'sl tons per acre, which, at the highest price paid
the producers of sugar-cane at the sugar mills, means only about £lO 18s. gross per
acre per annum, being for the most part a two-year crop. This is without deducting
the cost of production, and I doubt whether very many of the farmers clear more than
£5 per acre per annum from this crop. These are the two most important crops raised
in the districts named; but dairying is likely to spread largely, and is in some places
profitable, and is likely to become more so ; and I see no reason why sericulture may
not become an adjunct, likely to bring additional profit.
At the central establishments, a great deal, if not all, for a lime, of the
“ graining” or the general management of silkworm eggs, which is the most important
work in connection with sericulture, wnuld have to be done; and this work should only
be entrusted to very skilful and intelligent persons. This “ graining” is a matter, or
art, altogether apart from the raising of cocoons for silk ; because the silkworms sek
apart for the production of eggs need different treatment and different foods to those
which are reared for silk alone ; the objects being to breed silkworms which produce
uniformity of cocoons and silk, “ the most valuable reeled silk is from homogeneous
cocoons” ; to obtain as much improvement in yield as possible ; the preservation of a
high standard; and the prevention of any inroad of disease. Good graine (or good
eggs) is the foundation stone, as it were, of the whole business of sericulture. As an
example of the importance of vigour of race, I may mention that a Frenchman in 1845,
got 1 lb. of cocoons from 7| lb. of leaves, the largest proportion known, Handolo
thought it good to get 1 lb. from 14 lb. leaves; and during the bad time 1 lb. from 33,
or even 50 of leaves Avas the general ratio.
The following valuable information having reference to the subject of “graining,”
was kindly given to me by Mr. J. K. Fry :
“ Previous to the silkworm disease w r hich devastated Europe, it had come to be
seen in Italy and France that it was best to have the rearing of graine in_ skilful
hands specially devoted to this part of the business. The methods of rearing for
silk and for graine are in some respects directly opposed. Hence, certain distinctive
fine races of silkworms came to the front, each having its own repute, and the
ordinary rearers bought their eggs from the special rearers instead of saving some of


their own worms for reproduction ; but the disease maimed all the tine races, and
exterminated many, and threw the whole business of scientific egg-rearing into utter
confusion. It was from such diseased races that Mr. Brady had from careful breeding
and severe and continuous selection, through a course of years, to get, and succeeded in
getting, a new, pure-bred, and healthy race, as the first fruits of the new Australian
climate. Beginning at the highest point attained by the European rearer, namely, that
skill in breeding meant permanent improvement in product, it was for the Australian
skilled rearer to make that highest point his starting point towards a systematic
improvement in the breeding of silkworms ; and there no estimating the extent
to which improvement could go. Mr. Brady produced several races, each with its
distinctive excellence, and each probably distinctly best for a distinctive locality. But
beyond this there is a peculiar feature to be mentioned. Mr. Griffitt, a famous silk-
grower in Smyrna states, that out of 60,000 moths of mixed breeds he could select as
perfect only seventy-six, about half male and half female, which seventy-six showed
such an abnormally vigorous development as almost required them to be called ‘ a freak
of nature.’ These few units treated separately, gave him an exceptionally fine race;
and now he has no reason to allow any percentage of loss in his annual roarings. So
with Mr. Brady, from whose writings “he probably learned the method. For, some
fifteen or more years earlier, Mr. Brady led the way into this region of science, and
sometimes out of many hundred moths, discovered a single pair, one male and one
female, particularly adapted to be the progenitors of a race finer than any yet possessed,
suggesting vast possibilities for the future. More than this, out of 40,000 or 50,000
eggs he has mentioned in a letter from him to Dr. G-eorge Bennett, through careful
examination with the naked eye, a single pair of eggs superior to all the rest (which
eventually through all the transmutations turned out to be one male and one female)
a superiority of which the microscope confirmed, and which the subsequent rearing
demonstrated. But in order to these possibilities it is obvious that as a sine qua non
the real ing of graiue should be exclusively in skilled hands ; and it is a grave question
whether for this country’s permanent welfare in silk-growing, the rearing of graine
should not bo a Government function, in other words, whether all export of silkworm
graine by traders should not be required to be under Government stamp or guarantee.
For, as regards these eggs, they might be worth in Europe their weight in gold, or, on
the other band not worth their cost of transmission; besides doing irreparable damage
to the reputation of the country, wdiich ought to be an object of supreme importance
m the interest of silk-growing, as the late Mr. T. S. Mort used pointedly to remark in his
public speeches.”
Yield op Mitlbeeey Leaf.
There is considerable difficulty, X may say it nigh impossible, in arnvin° r
at a proper estimate of the yield or likely yield of an acre of mulberries in this Colony ;
however, I respectfully submit information that will, no doubt, prove useful.
I found when I questioned practical men, who were well informed and familiar
with the subject by experience and study, as to the results in value, Ac., in silkworm
rearing, that they are very careful, and shy even, in giving any answer whatever. And
when replies to inquiries can be elicited their opinions vary considerably and appear
contradictory. There are many reasons for this ; different points of view are taken,
then natural conditions vary so greatly, such as soil and climate, and climate especially
accounts for a great deal of diversity of opinion, or rather statement of opinion. Besides
this each one has his own peculiar ideas, or appropriate method of work and treatment.
As for instance, one person, wdio has perhaps been successful, prepared his mulberry
plantation in the first place, by deep trenching, very careful working of the ground, and
by planting his trees well and properly. But in quite a different manner, another has
cleared his land in a very rough way, and planted his mulberries after very little or very
shallow cultivation of the soil, or perhaps there has been no cultivation at all. Some
men look forward to permanent and yearly increasing results, year after year, later on


after a more or less protracted delay. Therefore as the methods vary so greatly, it is
useless to state an average outturn which shall not be misleading. Most persons whose
ideas are worth having, generally confine their estimates to what may be obtained in any
named locality or district, the data supplied concerning which their own knowledge and
experience elsewhere of actual and measured and weighed returns may warrant. All
careful and judicious writers, particularly the best informed and qualified to instruct,
and of the greatest experience, have been very careful and guarded in their statements,
John M. Bate (in the pamphlet before referred to) page 12, says, “an acre
of mulberry ‘ shrubs ’ full growth in France is expected to yield nearly 8,000 lb. of leaves.
Sufficient to produce 40 lb. raw silk, which at only 275. per lb. = £54 an acre.”
“ Observer,” Town and Country Journal , 15th July, 1882, says, “At end of ten years
(in New South Wales but not stating where) 20 acres mulberry leaf=fifty bales cocoons.”
Mr. Cobb, Secretary to Silk Supply Association, London, gave at a meeting of the
Society of Arts, 26th January, 1877, as his estimate from an acre of land carrying 500 to
COO trees in the colonies, when three years old, would yield (each tree F) 20 lb. of leaves,
which 20 lb. would produce 1 lb. of cocoons; and basing his estimate for 1 ounce
of graine at 16 lb. of leaves for food at 10s. per cwt. £B, and allowing £2 for cost of
eggs (seed graine), labour £B, and petty expenses £2. Result, £2O per acre.
Now, at the present time, 1892, we know for certain that the cost of grain
may be considerably less, and the yield of leaf, by reason of superior conditions, cultiva-
tion and mangement, very considerably more per acre.
When visiting Antony, on the Tweed River, Mr. Brady informed me that owing to
the soil and splendid climate at his place, he found that 100 trees, of proper sorts, are
sufficient per acre, and more profitable than a greater number. Of course thorough cultiva-
tion and management was an important factor in Mr. Brady’s results. I may mention that
he strongly condemns the idea of stripping the trees (although they might appear most
vigorous to anyone) more than once a year, except in cases of great necessity, his practice
and advice is, particularly to beginners, to extend the plantation rather than treat the
trees with undue severity, especially when they are young. I have heard it stated, that
among the better classes in Italy, it is considered to be the most wise and profitable
course to adopt, to strip, even mature mulberry-trees, three times only in four years,
thus allowing one whole year’s spell after three years cropping.
Mr. Ramos, in 1839, found, by trial under the careful superintendence of the
Government of India, that the consumption of mulberry leaf (locality, Island of
Bombay) was under 25 lb. (Cape Mulberry?) per thousand worms from egg to cocoon.
Gardner, 1831. Origin of silk manufacture by E. R. Porter (Board of Trade),
Cyclopedia, page 103. At six years of age, an average tree should give 12 lb. leaf. A
well cultivated tree (age not stated) should yield every season about 30 lb. “good
leaves,” and that it was not uncommon in the south of Prance to see “ large trees ” able
to furnish five times the quantity.
Boullenois, edition 1851, page 30 —besides stating in a note that rarely at the
test did 100 eggs yield so many as fifty cocoons; says that with 2,200 lb. of the best
leaf a rearer might get 45,000 to 50,000 cocoons, weighing up to about 154 to 1/6 lb.
English. Allowing the trees to be robbed of their leaves only every other year to avoid
deterioration as much as possible; thus treated they should give, at seven or eight years
after planting, 33 to 44 lb. each tree ; and at nine to ten years old, 88 to 100 lb.; one
crop in the two years.
In Prance the yield per English acre may be estimated as equal to 7,500 or
8,000 lb. in good seasons from well-grown trees on fair land, in times before the panic
caused by the silkworm disease prompted the owners to root up and destroy old and
most productive mulberries. The value of a crop of leaves from the same trees may
vary from year to year as between 2s. 6d. and 10s. or 11s. per cwt. English, or (say) £lO
to £4O per acre, for sale to the people who actually reared the silkworms but who did
not grow the food for them.


In Italy it was much the same thing, though the destruction of the mulberries in
consequence of the panic was not so severe as in France. I may mention that in New
South Wales Mr. Brady’s experience for many years has shown a considerably larger
crop in weight, as well as more uniform and reliable than in the two European countries
named. The appearance and vigour of these trees struck me directly 1 saw them. As
Mr. Brady used the leaf grown, for his own purposes, I could not obtain a quotation of
a sale price.
_Dr. Cleland, of South Australia, expressed his opinion “ that if the cultivator of
the white mulberry-tree can find a sale for his leaves at one-eighth of a penny per pound,
his returns per acre should be as good as those of the growers of grapes for wine.” If
this can be so profitable in a dry climate like South Australia, what would not the profit
be in such a favourable climate, for the mulberry, as that of the north-eastern coast
districts of New South Wales?

and most important industries, which will at the same time be a practical and useful aid
to the ordinary occupation of our farmers.”

Silk Lstdustet in the United States.
There is evidently a strong desire in the United States of America that the
government of that country should provide knowledge and adequate means to enable
its own agriculturists to profit by the local demand by its own manufacturers for raw silk.
The supply of raw silk is at present wholly from foreign sources, as the domestic
output even of cocoons of local produce “is too small to have any influence whatever.”
Italy, France, China, and Japan are yet the principal and, indeed, only sources of supply
The following statistics from the English Board of Trade" Journal, Yol. XT*
September, 1891, will give an idea of the magnitude of the imports of raw silk :

active and sustained efforts by the Department of State, and also by the Governments

of cocoons in their country. The large outlay, authorised by the National Government

as well as the Governments of several States, separately, and annually expended not
merely to manufacture the material known as raw silk, but more particularly to establish
at home, the production of cocoons, or the raw material from wdaich raw silk is manu-
factured. The manipulation and reeling (not winding) of cocoons by machinery
transforms them into the raw silk of commerce. The actual demands for this so-called
“ Raw Silk,” of late years, for local working up in the United States factories into
various textile fabrics, have caused payment to foreign countries of the large amounts
shown in the table I have given.
The United States Government fully alive to the importance of the facts have
adopted a policy evidently designed to have a double effect ; that is to cause the distri-
bution at home of the ready money, hitherto sent out of the country, now about four
millions sterling, by encouraging or promoting the growth of cocoons, and thus
supporting agriculture in their own territory by a revenue from a new source to a very
considerable extent. And also the manufacturing interests both in town and country by
the employment of a considerable amount of skilled labour and machinery for the con-
version of home-produced cocoons into home-produced raw silk by the reeling and
throwstering processes, &c., for the supply of their home factories wherein various
fabrics are now manufactured (chiefly in the Eastern States) and are already superseding
the imported articles. If well carried out this policy would, so far as silk is concerned,
render the United States independent of the foreigner.
I am unable to show by detailed statistics what is done with cocoons or raw silk
“ imported” and noticed under the general term “ silk,” imported silk manufactures not
included. As roughly illustrative, how a provision of material to work upon affects a
community, I respectfully beg to add the following statements, which I take as regards
the United States from the last edition of Mulhall, 1892, and the United States Census
returns for previous to 1880. The latest, those of the decennial period ending 1890, are
not yet published or procurable.

The Balance-sheet was approximately as follows :
This shows that, given a quantity of material of the sorts in question, for every
of cost or value, at least an equal amount is produced (if that is the proper term
to use) by and to the workers up of it, and a profit left besides which may be said to
be capital added to the good.
The above general statements are from Mulhall; I now beg to submit an extract
from the United States official report itself, as given in Tenth Census.
Manufactures of silk, Ist June, 1880:
The number of factories reported, 288 ; capital, real and personal, invested in
business, 815,371,575, at 4s. 2d. = £3,202,411 ; number of looms, 6,452; gross value of
manufactured products, $32,966,090, at 4s. 2d. = £0,867,935 ; net value of manufactured,
that is, finished goods, 827,688,170, at 4s. 2d. = £5,768,368; total amount paid in the
year for wages, 87,531,505 (?) (this must probably be for the year ending 30th June,
1880) = £1,569,063.
The number of workpeople (silk mill operatives):— 8,800 males, 9,211 females, total
persons, 18,071. Hate of wages per week, female, 83 to 83'37, this lowest to raw silk
cleaner = 12s. 6d. to 14s. Hate of wages per week, male, £5 65., highest to designer.
Asa useful illustration I add a comparative statement of the annual average
consumption of articles of silk, chiefly of clothing and luxury, in some countries per
individual of their populations, and thus, incidentally, their probable relative wealth and
comfort as indicated by the use of silk.
Instruction gained from these figures points to the importance, and clearly
shows the interest all classes have in the employments of labour other than their
own. The farmer or tiller of the soil, who, producing other commodities besides
substances for food, provides also material obtained from the soil by cultivation, and
thereby creates means which yet greater numbers of other persons, including unskilled
as well as skilled labourers, use to work upon and gain a constant employment, or, in
short, obtain subsistence and all necessaries, whilst these new fresh workers again help
the farmer by consuming the rest of his farm produce. “A thriving agriculture is the
beginning and foundation of national progress and prosperity.” The people of the
United States, including the rulers and the ruled, being alive to the facts appear to be
also alive to the truth of the old saying, “ the farmer feedeth all.”


There is now a Bill (Mr. Mitchell’s), of which I have seen a copy,before the Senate
of the United States which has been read twice, and referred to the committee on
Agriculture and Forestry, “ For the development and encouragement of silk-culture in
the United States under the supervision of the Secretary of Agriculture.”
The Secretary of Agriculture is directed to establish a number of silk experiment
stations, not exceeding five in number, in different parts of the United States. The said
silk-culture stations shall be a part of the present experiment stations in the States in which
they are located and now established and receiving appropiations from the Treasury of
the United States. The work at each station to he under the supervision of the director
of such station, who is to carry on work under rules and regulations prescribed by the
Secretary of Agriculture. A sum of $5,000 (about £1,000) is appropriated to each station
established, to be drawn from the Treasury of the United States.
The Secretary of Agriculture to have power to diminish, at his discretion, the
appropriation to be used at any station and to discontinue payments if the work in relation
to silk-culture, performed at the station, is not in accordance with his rules, &c.
Wool and Silk-Cocoons.
I have already referred to several public meetings which were held in Sydney,
sometime between the years 1870-1876, to consider the advisability of establishiug the silk-
rearing industry. At one of the meetings, at which a number of prominent citizens were
present, including Mr. T. S. Mort, Mr. Henry Prince, Mr. R. I). Adams, the Revd. Father
Pacilio, Mr. James Manning, and several others, Mr. Mort, who took a great interest
in the subject and had given it a great deal of consideration, in referring to an exhibit of
cocoons raised by Mr. Brady, remarked that if that gentleman “ were given a start of
ten years with such cocoons he will produce silk in quantities which will surpass, in value,
our present crop of wool,” and also that “the production of silk would, in value as an
export, soon rival and exceed the value of the wool export”; but the majority of those
present seemed to be rather amused at these remarks, and evidently considered them to
be bordering on the ridiculous, and were not inclined to treat them seriously, although
one gentleman gave it as his conviction that a pound weight of silk-cocoons could, in this
country (Australia), be produced at a less cost than a pound weight of wool. As I took
a great deal of interest in the question of silk production I thought over this carefully,
and have done so frequently since that time, and I now consider it my duty, while
preparing this report, to investigate this question in order to determine, if possible, whether
there may be any good grounds for such a belief, as it seems to be a matter of
considerable importance.
In regard to the production of wool the case seems clear enough from the fact
that the food of the wool-producing sheep, consisting, as it does, of natural grasses or
pasture and needing no labour to produce, may be considered as being “ cheap food”
almost unlimited in quantity and, as it were, ready made ; and that sheep can feed
themselves, and require comparatively little nursing; and as official statistics abound it
may seem easy enough to get at the cost of producing a pound of wool, but I submit
that to obtain a statement of net results was an exceedingly difficult matter.
The great difficulty is in regard to silk-cocoons. To a pastoralist the idea of
having to employ labour extensively, the necessity of having to cultivate, to plant the
mulberry, and tend to it for years whilst growing leaf, the only food for the silkworms,
would forbid him to entertain a notion that there could be any possibility in such a slow
and expensive proceeding being profitable, and that it could yield more valuable and
reliable results than the natural provision of ready made grass at less cost, especially
taking into consideration the labour in connection with the daily, almost hourly, feeding
of silkworms by hand, and the gathering of artificial food.
I have taken great pains to obtain and authenticate, as well as possible, any facts
or information I could gather. With regard to wool the statistics are very difficult to
deal with, as there is a complete absence of certain details necessary to show net results.


I have been obliged to have recourse to private friends for assistance and information,
without which my conclusions would be worthy of but little confidence. The figures
given me by various persons, and from different quarters, have been supplied me on the
understanding I do not reveal the sources which are, of necessity, private concerns of the
persons. I believe them to be reliable in a general way, although I should have been
glad had my information been wider in extent. lam very thankful for the confidence
and friendly feeling which assisted me immensely in my investigation.
Prom the reports of the Stock Branch of this Department, with valuable assistance
from the Government Statistician, I can gather that at the end of 1891 the stock
depastured in the Colony of New South Wales was 61,831,416 sheep and 1,702,870
cattle (horses and dairy cattle not included). There appear to be no data on which
to compute the actual amount of capital invested in pastoral pursuits, but the approximate
value of land estimated for pastoral purposes, together with the value of improvements
on all pastoral land (both Crown and alienated), together with the value of sheep and
cattle, is about £139,520,000.
There now comes a difficulty which it is hard to deal with satisfactorily, and that
is how to rank and apportion, fairly, between cattle and sheep, because both together
are often kept on the same run or station. I believe an old method of reckoning was
six sheep as being equal to one head of large stock:. The Stock Branch, I believe,
reckons eight, while the Statistical Department considers ten sheep equivalent to one
cattle. Therefore on each of these bases the figures would be:—
At 6 sheep = 1 cattle ... 10,217,220 sheep for the 1,702,870 cattle.
8 ~ ~ ... 13,622,960 „ „
10 „ „ ... 17,028,700 „
Taking these as a start, 10,217,200 added to 61,831,416 = 72,048,616 sheep.
„ „ „ 13,622,960 „ 61,831,416 = 75,454,376 „
„ > „ 17,028,700 „ 61,831,416 = 78,860,116 „
therefore, if 78,860,116 stand charged in a rough way at £139,520,000, the portion of
the capital deduction made for the part of the cattle, about £109,418,291, will remain
for a sort of first charge on the 61,831,416 sheep in the case of 10 sheep being equal to
1 cattle. If 8 sheep to 1 cattle, the 61,831,416 share of the approximate value of
alienated land for pastoral purposes, together with the value of improvements on all
pastoral land, Crowm as well as alienated, together with the value of sheep and cattle,
will be £114,330,269; and at 6 sheep to 1 cattle, £119,734,663, or—

72,048,616 = £139,520,000
The yield of wool at end of 1890 was estimated equal to about 269,686,034 lb.
Value of clip estimated at £8,991,396, for number of sheep, 55,986,431, being at the rate
of rather over 4f lb. of wool per sheep, worth a little over Bd. per lb., or about 3s. 6d.
per sheep.
The yield at the end of 1891 was 357,096,954 lb. Estimated export value
£11,036,018. Eor number of sheep, 61,831,416, being at the rate of over 5f lb, of
avool per sheep, worth about 7|d. per lb., or over 3s. 6fd. per sheep.


To both years the value of increase of stock must be added, and, also, the value of
the sheep slaughtered, which was estimated in the year 1891 at £859,300 for the car-
casses, to which may be added the value of the skins, &c., is in all about £2,000,000,
perhaps rather more than less.
As near an estimate as I can make from different data, which I can obtain, that
is the return from sheep, and taking into account all value obtained besides the wool
(but not including the increase of stock, which may probably be about 10 per cent., nor
the rise and fall of the market, nor other matters which are doubtful and difficult to deal
with), would be Bd. per sheep added to the 3s. 6|d. or 4s. 2fd., cash, for the yearly crop,
from such information as 1 hafre been able to get, in the gross. From this 4s. 2fd.
deduction has to be made for wages, station expenses, rents, &c.
The 61,831,416 sheep and 1,702,870 cattle together depasture on 165,133,000
acres of land, of which about 132,136,000 acres are Crown lands, rented for pastoral
purposes at an average annual rent of l|d., and 32,997,000 acres of land, private
property, which, probably, cost its owners from 355. to upwards of 40s. per acre (say)
more than £60,000,000.
Each acre produces about lb. of wool at 7|d. per lb. means a yield of Is. sd.
per acre.
I will now consider the yield per acre, assuming that the 1,702,870 head of cattle
are reckoned as being equal to the following numbers of sheep, at the rates of six sheep
equal to one head of cattle ; eight sheep equal to one head; and ten sheep equal to one
head: —

72,048,616 sheep = 414,279,542 lb.; value, £12,833,659

78,860,116 „ = 453,445,667 „ „ 14,046,958
The sheep are depastured on 165,133,000 acres of land, therefore the number of
acres required to maintain each sheep would be (and the value or yield per acre) :

In regard to silk-cocoons, I am at a loss for sufficient data upon which to estimate
the cost of a mulberry plantation in any country, nor do I know of any other than
statements, mostly very loose, as to the yield of mulberry leaf, or as to the yield of
cocoons to the acre. " I give in the appendices sufficient reliable facts to enable a
judgment to be made of the profit to be derived without entering the domains of
speculation or romance.
Eeferring to the only statistics I can find about the number of mulberry-trees,
viz., the figures in Mulhall [. Appendix , No. s], which are very incomplete for my purpose,
nor do I find it easy to fit a known produce of cocoons to any stated number of mulberry-
trees in more than one single instance. That authority says : “In 1835 the number of
mulberry-trees in France in that year was 14,880,000.” In another appendix (No. 5)
will be found the average annual produce of cocoons in France during the decade, 1831-
1840, was 11,527,000 kilos, value, francs, 42,840,000. English, 25,381,400 lb., value,
£1,785,000, an average per lb. of 16|d.
I can find no reliable statement of the actual acreage in any country under
mulberry, such as can be found with regard to vineyards, orchards, &c., for the mere
guesses of the number of mulberry-trees occupying any actual defined area are not
worthy of serious attention. The best authorities in this Colony consider 100 mulberry-
trees quite sufficient for one acre of the best and most productive land, and from 120 to
200 trees for generally good land. Having some knowledge on agricultural and
horticultural matters, and having carefully observed the growth of various species of
mulberries growing under various circumstances, I consider that the above numbers


on one acre of land should not be exceeded. From what I can learn from others and
from the general tenor of any information I obtained from a vast number of books (all
the most valuable of which in French, Italian, and English I have carefully studied) I
am satisfied that the number of mulberry-trees, per acre, should not anywhere exceed
200 trees. At this rate (200 per acre) Mulhall’s 14,800,000 would occupy only 74 000
acres, a very small area indeed on which to raise a return of £1,785,000, cash worth of
fresh cocoons, equal to only 2s. sd. a tree, per annum, and £24 10s. an acre yield to the
grower. I his is by no means extravagant, though it seems probable that a yet smaller
area than the 74,000 acres and its products were, and still is, the foundation, and
maintained most largely the great city of Lyons as well as other large cities. [Appendix,
. } “ ow most respectfully beg to invite attention to extracts in the appendices
particularly to the statements in No. 3, Lyons and Smyrna ; No. 3, France ■ No 6 Italy’
in whmh authentic and undeniable facts are given of the gains from raising cocoons of
£l2 Is. 9d,, £lO 35., £29 15s. to each rearer of silkworms. In the case of France no

cleanliness I might remark that the carriage of 40,000 tons of cocoons would add a
considerable amount to the railway revenue of the Colony.
When looking at the facts concerning the production of wool, it may be seen
that to raise £11,000,000 or £12,000,000 worth of wool for export nearly 62,000 000
.it sheep must be raised and cared for during a whole year ; that the capital for their
cost must have amounted to more than £109,000,000; that the wool by last returns the
crop, was 357,000,000 lb.; that its average value was about 7|d. per lb. • that’ the
area actually used to pasture these 62,000,000 of sheep is not less than 165,000 000
of acres, an average of about 2'66, or slightly more than 24 acres for one sheep • that
the capital invested for purchased land is about £60,000,000, the salaries or expenses of
owners or managers actually conducting the business, the wages of constant or per-
manent hands and temporary services, shearing, &c., cost of rations, &c., together with
a year s share of cost of improvements and “ dead plant,” cost of carriage from station
to port. There is no need to endeavour to ascertain, which is impossible to do, the
additions to stud stock nor the value of increase, which could only be guessed at to
know for almost certain that out of the 7-fd. gross return for the wool per lb and 8d
an equivalent for cash of the 62,000,000 of sheep for the known value of the c’arcasses
skins, &c deduction must be made for ascertainable expenses amounting to at least
im lb -. the I wei^llt o£ fleece at is equal to 2s. l|d., or a little more than
halt ot the 45., leaving the balance to meet unknown expenses and risks of droughts
fires, and floods. 6 f
On the other hand, compared with this is the cost of cocoons and the net return
on a comparatively small outlay of capital.
In respectfully submitting this portion of my report, which must be, necessarily
crude and incomplete (but, I think, at the same time of value) I beg to remark that the
subject is worthy of much better investigation.
Cost of peoducikg lib. weight of Silk-cocooks.
. The cost of producing a pound weight of cocoons in this Colony must of neces-
sity depend on a great many circumstances, as the tenor of previous portions of mv
report will indicate. r J
These silkworms which are well bred, and wisely and properly selected, such as
those reared by Mr. Griffitt, of Smyrna, produce double, and indeed, sometimes, treble
as much silk, as indifferently bred, poor kinds of worms ; and, in the opinion of a skilled
senculturist, it costs more to produce a bad cocoon than it does to produce a good one.


In cases where sericulture may he carried out rather extensively, the necessary
appliances, buildings, utensils, &c., &c., must remain idle for at least ten months of the
year, if only one crop of cocoons can be reared ; hut if a succession of crops can be
reared, these buildings, &c., &c., can be kept in almost constant use, and this must add
considerable to cash returns.
A rearing may be done on a small scale by an individual rearer, or by a family
in any rank of society (for in this manner nearly all the cocoons of the world are
produced), whoso time during the seven or eiglU weeks could not, perhaps, have been
employed at all usefully, or, at any rate, not in any sense productive of money gain.
Even if the cost of sheds, buildings, or utensils, can be reckoned an expense, which is
but seldom, the amount per lb. of cocoons would be extremely trifling.
The chief expense would be in cases where the mulberry-leaf has to be purchased
for the silkworms’ food, just as hay, corn, or other food, is bought for working horses
or dairy cattle.
Whether the rearer of silkworms uses his or her own grown leaf or purchased
food, and his or her own families or hired assistance, it is certain that in silk-producing
countries a good profit is obtained with healthy worms.
It is difficult to estimate the value of mulberry-leaf in this Colony, or at what
price it can be produced. I have already given Dr. Cleland’s opinion that one-eight of
a penny per lb. would pay growers well in South Australia. Of course some kinds of
leaves are much superior to others, and it is possible, according to Count Dandolo, to
raise H lb. of cocoons on 20 or 21 lb. of leaf,
in a general way it may be considered that 20 lb. of leaves, which may be bought
for or 3d., will produce 1 lb. of cocoons, and, allowing Id. per lb. for other expenses,
the balance -would be the reward for the rearer for his or her time, thus profitably
employed. I think that in this country, with any good management, the net profit
should be at least Bd., for 1 lb. of fresh cocoons would be worth at least Is. In fact, in
many cases, the net profits should very nearly be the shilling.
New Italy.
On the 7th November I visited the settlement known as New Italy, where a
number of the Marquis du Eay’s New Ireland emigrants had taken up selections under
the Crown Lands Act, and settled down soon after they arrived in this Colony, I was
accompanied by Mr. Reginald Champ, who had been appointed, nearly two years ago, to
initiate the sericultural industry.
It was in consequence of the experience and knowledge gained by the Italians
in sericulture at their native country Yenetia, in Italy, and the fact that the
mulberry flourished in the district, that the late Government decided to aid and
encourage the industry here. This, then, is the first attempt that has ever been made by
the State, to introduce in a practical manner the sericultural industry in New South
Wales.
“ New Italy” is situated in the county of Richmond, about 8 miles south of
the township of South Woodburn. I visited the farms where plantations of mulberries
had been made by sixteen Italians who had obtained loans of money from the
Government; and also the farms of others wdio now desire to obtain the loans they
asked for but which they had not taken. I found that the men, with a few exceptions,
were absent, some cutting sugar-cane under contract with the Colonial Sugar Refining-
Co., and others were engaged at the sugar-mill on the Richmond. The sugar season
extends over a period of about six months, and the money earned during that time is
the main support of the families. I was able to obtain the information I required from
the women, who were busy at work on the farms.


I found everyone much excited about the unexpected results of the late, and
first, reariugs of silkworms. They were all greatly pleased, as well as surprised,
at the successful result of their experiment which had not been anticipated, considering
the age of the majority of the mulberries, and the poor and rough conveniences which
were available to enable them to rear the silkworms. They informed me that they can
hardly understand how easy it is to manage silkworms at New Italy, compared with the
difficulties they used to meet with at home. They were greatly surprised at the health
and vigour of the worms, for, notwithstanding the rough manner in which they had to be
reared here, there were no deaths and no losses whatever. In Italy they were certain
to lose at least 20 per cent, of the silkworms, and the labour of rearing, in spite of all
conveniences, is very considerable, owing to severity of climate.
At New Italy the silkworms were reared in all sorts of places—kitchens, bed-rooms,
sheds, anywhere under some sort of cover; the little houses were crowded with silk-
worms in all sorts of contrivances for trays. Three-bushel bags stretched on rough
sapling frames seemed to be much in favour. The food used was chiefly obtained from
one-year old plants raised from the cuttings distributed by Mr. Champ, and also from
the plantations of seedling mulberries. There were a few matured trees in the
settlement, chiefly the Morus multicaulis species, and the leaves of these trees
were used for the first feedings of the silkworms, but during the final and most important
stage in the life of the worm the leaves were obtained from the young trees. It is
during the last stage that the silkworm secretes the matter which forms the silk, and
nearly the whole effort of the worm is directed to gather as much silky matter from the
leaves as possible, within the time after the last moult, it remains a caterpillar.
It has generally been considered by the best authorities on sericulture, that the
mulberry needs age, from four to eight years, before the leaves secrete the best gummy
matter for silk, so that it seems rather remarkable that the silk produced at New Italy
has turned out to be as good as it has done, and some of it equal, perhaps, to the best.
The silk is a very fair sample indeed, and the cocoons, although not so regular in quality
as could be desired, are on the whole good, and some amongst them very good.
The Italians are very satisfied with the results of their work, so far, as it gives an
Indication of what they will be able to produce when they shall be able to grow a suffi-
ciency of food for the number of silkworms they may be able to attend to. It is in
consequence of this success that those Italians who hesitated to accept the loans offered,
and which were applied for under encouragement, now desire to set to work and plant
mulberries as largely as circumstances will permit.
The greater part of the rearing had been completed before my arrival, and most
of the silk had been reeled from the cocoons, but I was able to see a number of worms
being fed, and others spinning their cocoons. Anyone could see at a glance that the
women were very expert in managing the worms. They seemed to be delighted to get to
the business to which they had been brought up to again; and they took the keenestinterest
in the silkworms, which they treated quite as pets. As the worms showed signs of
spinning they were placed on brushes made from branches of shrubs or trees, and long
tufts of dried grass. Some of the brushes were very large, others small, the branches
and twigs being tied up together into the shape of brush brooms, and these were put in
corners and out of the way places, until the cocoons were completed by the silkworms.
I was fortunate in being in time to see the work of reeling the silk from the
cocoons, for it was most interesting to me to watch the skill with which it was managed.
The woman who was reeling, Mme. Pazzutti, had been brought up to this particular
branch of the silk industry from childhood, and, although, she had passed through several
years of very hard and different sorts of work since she last reeled silk, she had by no
means forgotten her art, and her expertness was surprising.
I ascertained that there are six of the Italian women who are experts at reeling
silk, and that they could easily give instructions to children and others if, or whenever,
it might be desirable.


As soon as Mr. Champ knew that there was a probability of a considerable number
of cocoons being produced, he made application to the Principal Under Secretary for
the purchase of a small reeling machine which had been obtained from Europe by the
late Mr. George Thorne, of Castle Hill, and which could be bought for the sum of £l2
(I saw this machine within the last few days, and the price seems to me to be most
reasonable) ; but Mr. Champ’s application does not appear to have been considered.
How ever, two Italians, Antonio Murandi and Antonio Pazzutti, made a singularly
ingenious machine, but necessarily a rough one, by which a woman can wind off
tw T o skeins of silk at a time, and more than a pound a day. This photograph [See-
Appendix — Photo., Jig. 2], taken by me, whilst the machine was at work, will give a
rough idea of it; I was not able, with the small hand camera and from the position of
surrounding buildings to take a better view. The two skeins of silk can be seen on the
wheel which is being turned by the little girl who is standing just behind it.
It cannot be expected that the silk reeled by such a rough machine could be of the
best quality, and it is surprising that it has turned out so well as it has done, for the threads
of silk, or filaments, were passed through holes made in hoop-iron, instead of through
glass-beads or agates, and these threads were again passed through wire-eyelets om
a little movable frame worked backwards and forwards by the action of the large wheel*
in order that the silk should be properly spread and not bunched up.
Very considerable interest has been aroused in the immediate neighbourhood of
New Italy, at Woodburn, and in the Eichmond Eiver district, at the results of the Italians’
work, and several residents who have large interests in the district, and with whom I had'
conversations on the subject, consider the prospects of a new industry to be excellent,
and one which will eventually be of immense importance to the district, but that it will’
first need some encouragement and assistance by the State.
I made very careful inquiries as to the general opinion about the labour required,
and whether the want of labour would prevent sericulture making progress, but no
difficulty whatever on this point is anticipated. Most of the setllers in the district have
large families, and there seems to be a growing anxiety as to what is to become of the
children. This is the opinion of many men who have thought well on the subject, and
given it much consideration.
I may mention that being obliged to travel to several parts of the district, to
carry out other instructions, far distant from New Italy, I took the opportunity to
obtain the opinions of all whose opinions were worth asking, and there is a general
agreement that there would be no difficulty about labour if sericulture were once
established. I was much surprised to find that considerable interest was being taken in
the subject of silk growing in places where I least expected that it would be thought
about.
I made many inquiries about the Italians, and found that they are considered to
be a most honorable, trustworthy, hardworking, and thrifty people.
When sericulture was initiated at New Italy, it was considered by the residents
of the surrounding district (with one or two notable exceptions) to be a very paltry affair,
and Mr. Champ’s appointment was looked upon with great distrust, and the whole thing
was ridiculed; but since the Italians have shown what can actually be produced the
greatest interest is generally being taken in sericulture, and the feeling now respecting
it and Mr. Champ is the very antithesis of what it used to be, and the greatest desire
has been expressed that the Government should continue to assist the Italians to the
extent promised, and that the experiment be continued.
The few persons who, besides the Italians, obtained some mulberry cuttings and
seeds from Mr. Champ, by the permission of the Grovernment, planted and sowed them,
more, I think, from curiosity than from a genuine desire to enter upon the sericulture
industry; however, from what some of them informed me, I believe, they are now quite
alive to its importance.


The country about the settlement of New Italy is undulating, bearing a hardwood
forest, the chief timber being ironbark,* blackbutt, tallow-wood, peppermint, stringy -
bark, sheoak, &c. The soil, which is considered to be extremely poor and worthless in
comparison with the rich alluvial brush land on the banks of the Richmond and Clarence
Rivers, or the soil of the “ Big Scrub” in the Richmond River district, is better than
it seems to be at first sight, or when it is in a state of nature, and this is apparent where
it has been well cleared and cultivated. The timber is very heavy and difficult to clear.
The country and soil have very much the appearance of many of the heavily timbered por-
tions of the county of Cumberland —both districts overlying coal-measures. When the
Italians first settled at New Italy they had great difficulties to contend against, being
strangers, almost unable to speak a word of English, and being extremely poor, they had
great difficulty to live. When I visited the place a few years ago the women were
working like men, clearing timber, digging out stumps, cutting and squaring timber for
railway sleepers, and so on. The women still work hard, and so do the children ; but
the general appearance of the farms has very much changed for the better, many of the
original huts have given place to substantial cottages built of well squared solid slabs,
and there is a look of comfort and neatness about the dwellings, too often absent from
those of the settlers generally in the district. They seem to have an abundance of good
vegetables for home use and some for sale ; and all the gardens have some well cared
for flowers, of which they seem to be very fond and proud. The grape vine succeeds
very well, and grapes are produced abundantly. Some wine is made for home use, and
most of the grapes are sold in the district. This is the chief crop they have to depend on.
I think that most of them now own a few cattle and a horse or two. They save
and collect every scrap of manure they can for their gardens. The farms and gardens
are all well fenced, and,considering the difficulties they had to contend against,and their
up hill struggle, they have done wonderfully well, and are an example of energy and
perseverance.
The mulberry succeeds admirably here, in fact its growth is surprising. The
cuttings planted a little more than one year ago have grown into trees, many of them to
a height of 10 or 12 feet, having stems with a diameter of from inches to 2 inches.
This photograph [See Appendix — Photo. Jig. 2], taken at random, shows one of these
young mulberry-trees which was planted as a cutting about one year ago. It is planted
with a number of others in a vineyard, and shows how advantageous it is to plant in soil
that has been well prepared. The two Italians standing near this tree are each about 80
years old. The old woman is extremely active and sprightly. I found her hoeing away
amongst her sweet potatoes with wonderful vigour. This old couple take the greatest
interest in sericulture, and the man had just finished making several trays of different
sizes for his silkworms next season. These trays were made of vine cuttings tied neatly
together with strands of stringy-bark. On the alluvial banks of the Richmond River a
variety of mulberry may be seen growing near many houses, between Woodburn and
Lismore, and there are many trees lower down the river. This variety is, lam almost
sure, the Morus Indica, wrongly named by the settlers the “ Cape mulberry.” The
foliage of this variety grows very thick and dense, so that it forms an admirable shade
tree. Eloods do not affect it in the least. I found the same variety, here and there,
throughout the district between the Richmond and the Tweed Rivers, and also on the
Clarence River, growing everywhere with great luxuriance. I also noticed the “ Cape ”
mulberry growing near the Clarence. The Morns multicaulis is also common in the
district. When visiting Mr. Brady, on the Tweed, about three years ago, I spoke to him
about the Morus indicus and its luxuriant growth. He told me that he thought this
had spread from plants originally distributed by him.
The Italians consider the climate of New Italy to be very healthy, and they
suffer but little, if any, sickness. The children look very strong and healthy, and the
climate seems to suit them admirably. The climate also seems to be admirably adapted
for the silkworms, which thrive splendidly. I was informed that the time from hatching


to spinning here occupies about eight days less than it does in Italy, and the Italians
consider that the worms require less feed here. They say that in Italy the worms
require 25 lb. of leaves to produce 1 lb. of cocoons, but that here 20 lb. of leaves will
produce 1 lb. of cocoons, and that a tree two years old here will yield 12 lb. of leaves,
whilst only from 2to 4 lb. can be obtained from one three years old in Europe. How-
ever, it is only from very exact experiments that perfectly correct estimates can be
formed.*
I was informed by one of the Italians that a gentleman named Oscar Meyer came
to New Italy some time before Mr. Champ’s first visit, with a view to induce the Italians
to enter into the sericultural industry, but he was not successful. He left his card
which was shown to me.
I visited a reserve, No. 14,836, 19| acres, which has been reserved from sale for
sericulture. Eive acres have been well cleared ready for the plough.
This photograph [See Appendix — Photo. Jig. 3] shows a portion of the cleared
land, a part of the fence, and it shows the sort of timber that has been cleared atvay.
It will also give a good idea of the general character of the timber at New Italy, although
in some places the timber is much heavier than this. The 5 acres were cleared by Mr.
Champ in order to make a mulberry plantation, and to sow a large quantity of mulberry
seed which had not been distributed. The work of planting and sowing was not carried
out owing to the suspension of operations by the Government. The mulberry seed is
in charge of a gentleman at South Woodburn, but unless it is sowed before very long
it will probably perish. Its value is, or rather its cost was, about £45. One bag of
seed was sent to the Eorest Department, and 71,000 plants were obtained, of which about
11,000 are now available.
The work of clearing the 5 acres of the reserve has, apparently, been well done?
and the land is quite ready for the plough. The situation of the reserve is good, well
elevated, and about the centre of the settlement; so that if it be determined to carry
on the work already begun, of aiding, fostering, and encouraging sericulture, great use
might be made of this portion of land.
The mulberry seedlings raised by the Italians, from seed distributed by Mr.
Champ, number about 25,000 or 30,000. They have grown very well indeed, although
standing only an inch or two apart in the seed beds, for numbers of them are upwards
of 5 feet in height. Great use was made of the leaves from these young plants for food
for the silkworms that w r ere reared. The Italians told me that in Italy, seedlings three
years old would not be so fine as these one year old seedlings.
As far as I was able to ascertain, I think that about 180 lb. weight of cocoons
were raised at New Italy, but numbers had been given away and distributed about the
district, and no accurate account of the w'eight had been kept.
The Italians had saved a number of cocoons for “graine,” and the moths were
laying their eggs when I visited New Italy. I think that, considering the conditions
under which the silkworms were reared, the worms obtained from the eggs are likely to
deteriorate. This may not be apparent at the next rearing, but it will become evident
in course of time if the silkworms are reared under similar conditions to which they were
at first. “ Graining,” or rearing, silkworms for their eggs requires the special attention
of very skilled persons, and is a separate branch (or should be) of sericulture.
* Note. —I find, curious enough, on consulting Count Dandolo’s excellent work on “ The Art of
rearing Silkworms,” published in 1825, the following remark, which leads me to think that the Italians
may be quite correct in their opinion as to the silkworms requiring less food at “New Italy ” than is the
case in the colder climate of Italy : —“The results of my experiments,” says Dandolo, “ tends to show
that in warmer climates than ours the silkworms consume rather less leaf than I have stated, because
the quality of the leaf is more nutritive. In the favourable regions of Dalmatia I obtained, in 1807,
1J lb. of cocoons from 15 lb. of leaves, and 15 lb. of cocoons yielded lb. of silk, although it was not
so fine and delicate as ours.” *


I was informed that the Italians had some eggs sent out to them from Italy by
friends there, but they -were (I think, fortunately) destroyed in transmission. The
greatest care should be taken in importing eggs from Europe, where the very worst of
the silkworm diseases have not been eradicated.
Dr. Cleland, of South Australia, in his report previously referred to by me, says:
“I would like to draw' attention to the possible danger of importing disease with silk-
worm eggs from Europe. It seems to me that these should be quarantined as well as
any other live stock. There might be some isolated Government farm in time where a
cultivation of the imported eggs could be made, and where, if found diseased, they could
be destroyed.”
The Italians are quite satisfied that sericulture, when once firmly established, will
be sufficiently profitable to enable them to remain at home altogether, instead of, as at
present, being obliged to absent themselves for, at least, half the year. They will be
satisfied to obtain small profits. The women are exceedingly anxious for their husbands
to remain at home. It is evident, therefore, that the establishment of sericulture will
be a very important matter to these settlers.
I carefully examined all papers relating to sericulture at New Italy, and it appears
that, in accordance with instructions from the Colonial Secretary, Sir Henry Parkes, the
Inspector-General of Eorests, Mr. J. E. Brown (accompanied by Mr. Reginald Champ),
visited New Italy and made a very favourable report as to the suitability of the settle-
ment for silk-culture. Mr. Browm, on the 28th October, 1890, wrote ; “ According to
your instructions, I entered carefully into the subject of the probability of establishing
the industry of sericulture in the settlement, and have much pleasure in reporting that,
in my opinion, it is one of the most important that could be undertaken in connection
with it.” * * * “ Taking all these matters into consideration, then, I have respectfully
to recommend that every encouragement should be given by the Government to the
settlers of New Italy to establish a thorough system of reproductive sericulture in their
midst.” Mr. Champ also made a report addressed to the Director-General of Eorests.
Immediately after these reports w r ere made (on 31st October, 1890), a petition
was sent to the Colonial Secretary from the Italian residents of New r Italy, through the
Italian Consul, Dr. Marano, asking for assistance to enable them to make a start in the
sericultural industry.
In the beginning of December, 1890, Mr. Champ was instructed by the Colonial
Secretary to visit Adelaide ; and on the 19th December, Mr. Champ reported: “ Referring
to your instructions of the 3rd instant, I have the honor to report that I returned
yesterday from my visit to Adelaide, and to Dr. Cleland, of that city, and in accordance
with the said instructions, have made satisfactory arrangements with this gentleman for
the supply of the New South Wales Government of the necessary quantity of silkworm
graine from his present small stock of Japanese silkworms.” Mr. Champ further
reported that the quantity of graine, or eggs, which he estimated would be required by
the Italians in tw r o or three years would be between 300 and 400 ounces, and lie
“ arranged with Dr. Cleland to supply a maximum of about half that quantity to be
delivered as may be desired by the Government at the expiration of two or three years.”
The other portion of the graine, Mr. Champ proposed should be obtained from Mr.
George Thorne, of Castle Hill. Mr. Champ said, “In the absence of any authority for
a supply being obtained from this gentleman, and his worms being very considerably
more forward than those of South Australia, he was kind enough at my request to
multiply his stock to the needful extent this year on his own account, so that they can
be still more largely increased next season if desired.” He adds, “ Should you see fit to
appoint me to see that the project is properly carried out, either with the Italians or
otherwise, I shall be pleased to do my utmost to ensure its success, and am confident
the ultimate results will w r ell repay whatever expenditure it is intended to incur.” In a
letter to the Principal Under Secretary, dated 11th March, 1892, respecting his qualifica-
tions, Mr. Champ w ? rote, “As regards my knowledge of sericulture, I have had about


ten years experience, gained as follows: —In the year 1881 I entered the firm of Henry
Zweifel & Co,, raw silk merchants, who did the principal trade of the port with Italy
and France, and I there gained considerable experience of the European methods of silk
production. In the year 1886 I was dispatched to China (Canton) to buy and inspect
silk, and it was during my residence here amongst the Chinese producers that I gained
my principal knowledge.”
On the 10th December, 1890, Mr. Champ was instructed to proceed to Hew Italy,
on the Fichmond Fiver, and “ make inquiries with a view to ascertain the number of
inhabitants who are willing and able to undertake sericulture in that district, and also
to what extent they will require assistance, and fully report on your visit.” Mr. Champ
informed me personally that after his report had been received by the Colonial Secretary,
Sir Henry Parkes informed him that the sum of £1,500 was, or would be, granted for the
loans to be made to the Italians, &c., and that he was verbally instructed to return to
New Italy, and that the money would follow.
On the Gth March, 1891, Mr. Champ reported that he had arrived at South
Woodburn, on the Fichmond Fiver, on the 26th February, and stated that he had in-
formed the Italians of New Italy “ that the Government is willing to give them the
help asked for to start sericulture,” and he urged the necessity for affording the
promised assistance. No reply was received to this letter, and Mr. Champ was sub-
sequently informed that the delay was due to preparation of bonds. On the 18th April,
he telegraphed to the effect that if he did not receive instructions to the contrary he
would come to Sydney. During this visit to Sydney, Mr. Champ went to Liverpool to
see a few Italians w T ho had settled there (and who had belonged to the same expedition
as their fellow countrymen at New Italy), to ascertain ■whether they were willing to
take up sericulture, and he reported the result of his visit on the 30th April, 1891.
Whilst in Sydney Mr. Champ, referring to the work he had done, applied for
remuneration at the rate of £SOO per annum, and said, “ I am willing to continue my
duties in regard to the introduction of the industry into the Fichmond Fiver district, or
other parts of the Colony, on payment to me by the Government of this same salary
(£500) per annum plus the usual travelling expenses,” and on the Gth May, 1891, the
Colonial Secretary approved of the appointment of Mr. Feginald Champ with salary at
the rate of £SOO per annum and the usual travelling allowances, “ to take effect from
the 30th January last.”
On the 30th April, 1891, Mr. Champ submitted the names of the Italians who
required assistance, the number in family, number of selection, number of acres in each
selection, number of acres to be plantedVith mulberries, number of cuttings required,
and the amount of money asked for on loan for the first twelve months ; and he also
submitted a schedule of the Italians at Liverpool and their requirements. With respect
to these schedules, Sir Henry Parkes wrote, the following minute : —“ I have consulted
with the Treasurer on the proposal to turn to practical advantage the experience and
special training of the Italian residents of ‘ New Italy’ in the production of silk as a
permanent industry. Hitherto all attempts at silk cultivation have been futile from
the want of practical knowledge. These Italians, with their wives and children, appear
to be the very persons to prosecute the project to a success and to permanently establish
the industry as a profitable undertaking. They have been visited both by the Director-
General of Forests and by Mr. Champ (a gentleman having an intimate knowledge of
the silk trade, as well as of the latest methods of silk cultivation), and every means
has been adopted to ascertain the trustworthiness and general character of the persons
it is proposed to assist in following this industry. The Attorney-General has prepared
a draft bond (A.F.) for the persons who receive assistance to execute for the payment
of the advances. Hnder these conditions, and directing that the utmost care and pre-
caution be exercised for the protection of the Government, I approve of the schedule of
'advances submitted by Mr. Champ, exclusive of the residents near Liverpool,” dated
sth May, 1891.


Mr. Champ visited Adelaide again in the beginning of May, 1891, “to make
arrangements for transport of a large quantity of mulberry trees and cuttings,” and
on the 21st May reported that these arrangements had been completed. He then
visited Mr. George Thorne, at Castle Hill, who promised to supply a number of trees
and cuttings gratis. On the 18th November, 1891, Mr. Champ submitted that it would
be very desirable that a house should be erected for him at Hew Italy, to cost about
£IOO or £450. Then, on the 30th November, he wrote respecting accommodation at
South Woodburn.
When Mr. Champ first went to the district after his appointment, he was unable
to obtain a house at South Woodburn, which is the nearest township to New Italy; he
therefore resided at Lismore with his family, until he could obtain a house at
Woodburn.
On the 30th November Mr. Champ applied for the sum of £l9O for further
advance to the Italians, and on the 9th February, 1892, he received £135, but was not
informed why the full amount asked for was not sent. On the 10th February he sent
a letter to the Principal Under Secretary, explaining his reasons for applying for £l9O.
Thinking it desirable that a cheap house for rearing silkworms (a magnauerie)
should be erected on a reserve in a central part of the Italian settlement, Mr. Champ
wrote to the Principal T nder Secretary, recommending the erection of one; but no
reply to his letter having been received, he telegraphed, saying that if he did not receive
instructions to the contrary he would come to Sydney. Not receiving a reply to this
he came to Sydney, and had his recommendation for a silkworm house apnroved on the
17th August. The cost of this house was not to exceed £BO.
On the 3rd August Mr. Champ submitted a statement as to the distribution of
mulberry-trees and cuttiugs to the Italians, and a few of the neighbouring farmers. It
appears that 13,000 cuttings were sent from Adelaide on 11th July, 1891, addressed to
Mi. Champ, care of the Forest Department, Sydney ; but for some reason, which is not
known, the cuttings, and some young trees, were delayed in Sydney for twelve days,
consequently most of the cuttings perished, not more than 5 per cent, struck root!
The 300 }mung trees, however, grew. It is possible that the loss may not be so great
as it might seem, for after seeing the plants, which are growing, I am disposed to think
that most of them were from a variety of mulberry # (supposed to be of M. alba),
known about Sydney as the ‘ Cape mulberry,” which is by no means a desirable or useful
kind to plant largely. It is useful as a change of food, or as a “ medicine” for the silk-
worms, but it yields inferior silk. Mr. Champ does not appear to be very well
acquainted with the various species and varieties of mulberry. From Mr. George
Thorne, of Castle Hill, 100 young mulberry-trees were received, and about 75 per cent,
grew. Also about 1,800 cuttings, of which about 25 per cent, rooted ; they were in a
very dry condition when received.
In i iew r of the erection of a magnanerie or silkworm rearing-house, and wishing
to make a mulberry plantation, and to sow a large quantity of the white mulberry seed
which, on his recommendation, had been obtained from Europe at a cost of £B6 5s Mr
Champ recommended, on Die 28th August, 1891, that an area of 5 acres of Preserve
(since notified, on 28th November, 1891, as 14,836, “ Eeserve from Sale for Sericulture,
2 ‘ ) should be cleared, grubbed, ploughed, and fenced, the work to cost about
£2OO. This recommendation was approved on 29th August. Tenders wmre then
accepted and the work was completed. On the sth October Mr. Champ wrote to the
Principal E nder Secretary, requesting that the first instalment for payment of work
done might be paid, and on the 4tli November a reply was received enclosing a receipt
to be signed before payment could be made. The receipt was returned signed on the
Note. Ido not think this mulberry is a species of Alba. I believe it is a native of Japan,
and plants or cuttings were taken thence to the Cape of Good Hope, about 200 years ago, by the
Hutch. It was also taken to St. Helena, and from both those places it was brought to Sydney The
leaves produce good silk, but in small quantities


30th November, and in the letter transmitting this Mr. Champ sent interim receipts for
balance of payment, £52, and for fencing, £3O 3s. 6d. The money for the first instal-
ment, £25, was received by Mr. Champ on the 17th May, 1892. The other moneys
were received on 16th June, 1892. Mr. Champ wrote several letters urging that the
contractor should be paid.
The silkworm graine, or eggs, which had kindly been presented, through Mr.
Champ, to the Italians, by Miss Thorne, of Castle Hill (which had been reared by her
late father, Mr. George Thorne), amounting to about four ounces, or about 160,000 eggs,
and some graine presented by Dr. Cleland, of Adelaide, was distributed by Mr. Champ,
about the beginning of October. This was reported to the Principal T nder Secretary
by Mr. Champ, who inquired, at the same time, whether his recommendation to pur-
chase the reeling machine, made in July last, was approved.
On the 10th October, 1892, a petition was sent to the Colonial Secretary by the
Italians at New Italy, praying that the Government will continue operations that have
already been started, until they are in a position to make the industry profitable ; they
said, “ So far as we have been able to proceed, every circumstance points to a favourable
conclusion of such experiments,” and “ In all our experience in Italy, whence emanates
the great bulk of high-class silks in the ■world’s markets, we have never seen such
favourable indications of production as are now before us, although we have at command
at present only the most rude means of obtaining a crop of silk ; the successful roarings
are taking place in sheds which in our native country would probably only result in an
entire loss of the crop.”
I respectfully submit that Mr. Champ’s work has, from all I can gather in the
district, been performed under very discouraging circumstances. Public opinion was
altogether against him, and the idea that sericulture would ever bo established in the
district was ridiculed, although one or two of the residents had great faith in the
industry. _ . .
Amongst the Italians, he was met, at first, with a good deal of suspicion and
discouragement, and had many difficulties to overcome. I believe, as far as I could
judge, that Mr. Champ performed his work to the best of his ability, and as well as
adverse circumstances would permit.
Heeling.
[ See also Appendix No. 10.]
There is an important matter to be considered, if it be determined by the Govern-
ment to take action with respect to sericulture, namely, the advisability of making
careful experiments to determine whether the reeling of silk from the cocoons, and
producing “ raw silk,” can be made a commercial success, or whether it would not be
more profitable to simply dessicate the cocoons, and press them for shipment to Europe.
Silk-reeling is a branch of sericulture (or, in fact, is an industry by itself) which
depends on the raising of cocoons for supplies, but has, otherwise, really nothing to do
with that part of the business.
Although I am doubtful as to the probability of silk-reeling becoming a commercial
success, at the same time I think it would be highly desirable to have the matter settled
as soon as a sufficient supply of cocoons would be forthcoming; and I respectfully
suggest that a “ Pilature ” be established at New Italy, and that experiments be made
sufficiently large and business-like scale to determine this matter beyond all doubt.
The expense need not be very great, and amongst the Italian women, as I previously
mentioned, there are six expert reelers. This I consider a most fortunate circumstance,
which should be taken advantage of. The woman I saw at work reeling informed me
that the girls, with a little teaching and practice, would very soon acquire the art, and
there would be no difficulty about it.


I have thought over this matter very carefully, and, taking everything into con-
sideration, I think that the extraordinary opportunity which presents itself of testing
the possibilities of a very large industry (connected with, but apart from, sericulture)
becoming established should not be lost.
I find that the American Government is extremely anxious to establish a silk-
reeling industry in the United States to save the immense import of raw silk from
foreign countries which is required to supply the silk manufactories. G-reat attention
is being given to the improvement of silk-reeling machines, whereby saving in cost of
reeling may be effected.
In a circular, published sth October, 1891, by the Ladies Silk Cultivation Society,
of St. Diego County, California, it is stated, “in the fourth year one acre 'well cared for
will support the worms hatched from oz. of eggs (40,000 to the oz.), and yield a net
profit ot 226 dollars 25 cents, if the cocoons are sold. If they are converted into silk
the acre will net 857 dollars 50 cents, allowing 1 dollar 50 cents per day to each
labourer except the reeler. In this State the regular waiges paid for reeling is 40 dollars
'per month. An expert can reel 1 lb. of 16 oz. per day.”
Dr. Cleland says, “We come now to the third stage, or the reeling of the
cocoons into raw silk. This portion of the industry is considered a very profitable one.
The more reason on this account that our original leaf-growers should still continue
and manage to share this profit as well as the others. The young women previously
engaged in rearing cocoons would be available for reeling purposes. The w r ork is not
pleasant, but is essentially fitted for female labour. In Italy I was charged at the rate
of 2s. per lb. for reeling the raw silk from the cocoons. Even if it would cost 3s. in this
Colony (South Australia) it would still pay well. It would be necesary to have skilful
instructors, and the most improved machinery. In a former communication to the
Central Agricultural Bureau, I gave it as my opinion that 1 lb. of raw silk would cost,
from first to last to produce, Bs. Suppose that it w r as to cost 10s. per lb., the
.-Co-operative Company would still make a profit of ss. per lb., for I received 15s. per lb.
in Italy for some that w r as reeled there. When the quantity turned out amounted to
tons in weight it would be difficult to see why the industry might not be made a
financial success. I think I might say that the man or men who ever do this will
deserve well of their country.”
In a report to the Governor of the State of Kansas, U.S., for 1889-90, the Silk
'Commissioner remarks —“I visited the filatures at Washington and Philadelphia to
investigate and inform myself with regard to the best methods of reeling, but found
nothing practically better than our own. However, Mr. Phillip Walker, in charge of
the silk section at Washington, was engaged in perfecting the Terrell Automatic Eeel,
which, when completed, will greatly lessen the expense of reeling, and the filatures will
then become self-sustaining.” He further remarks, respecting sericulture generally in
the State—“ With the same encouragement and fostering care, I see no reason why
the silk industry should not succeed as well, and be of as much real value and profit to
the people of our State as the production of sugar.” He also states that fifty-four
families received for the cocooons they produced 1,254 dollars, or an average of 28
dollars 22 cents per household. The time occupied was but six weeks, and the money
received at a time when there is little income from the farm, and every dollar is
acceptable. The work can be done by the aged and young members of the household,
who are unable to go to the field and perform hard-labour, and it is especially adapted
to the girls of the family.”
I think these opinions will show that the question of reeling is worthy of con-
sideration. The work must be done with great care, and no faulty raw silk submitted
to market, for it will be of the most vital importance to the trade that a good name bo
established to be afterwards maintained with the strictest care.


There need be no difficulty, on the other hand, in finding a market for dried
cocoons when they can he produced in sufficient quantity ; but they must be properly
desiccated, and the expense of doing this will, I think, be trifling in comparison with
reeling.
In tendering advice to the stewards of the silk section of the New South Wales
Agricultural Society’s Exhibition for 1871, Mr. Brady wrote “The term 1 staved' should
be expunged as implying a necessity for a particular mode of treatment. The proper
term is desiccated, the precise meaning of which is that the whole cocoon, just completed
by the worm, is subjected to some drying process (the mode of which should be left to
the option and skill of the exhibitor) by which the drying is carried to that extent by
which all moisture and unctious matter are removed so perfectly, that upon pressure
even under an hydraulic press, the grub contained in the cocoon is reduced to mere
dust and no amount of pressure will soil or tarnish the silk of the cocoon.”
Mr. Thomas Dickens, President of the Silk Supply Association of London, in his
guide to sericulture says “ Cocoons thoroughly desiccated, may be pressed and packed
for transport, and will yield as good silk as if reeled at once in the localities where they
are produced. ” He also remarks about reeling “ This operation, although simple not
costly, and conveniently performed by women and children, requires careful, special
training and much experience, so that the operators may become accustomed to the touch
and manipulation of the fine filaments. It is therefore strongly urged that silk-growers
do not attempt this process until they shall have successfully carried out the plan
recommended for producing and exporting cocoons. Good cocoons will realise far more
than silk defectively reeled from them.
It may be gathered from this report that sericulture in its widest meaning may
be said to embrace four very distinct sorts of work, viz., the cultivation of the mulberry ;
the rearing of silkworms expressly for graine or eggs ; the rearing of silkworms for
cocoons only; and the reeling of silk from the cocoons, and each of these branches
requires special knowledge and skill; and, in fact, the more this is applied the better chance
of success. This is either not generally understood or else is overlooked by those who
have not studied the subject, and who consider the whole thing to be merely child’s work,
because nearly every boy or girl who can obtain a few mulberry leaves, generally
manages to rear a few poor worms, and wind off a few pretty little skeins of worthless
silk. Juvenile labour can, when properly directed, be made great use of ; and it is
absolutely necessary, where silk is being raised for commercial purposes, that the work be
guided by well trained and skilful persons, who have a thorough acquaintance with the
business. I respectfully invite particular attention to this matter, as I so fully believe
that the ultimate success of the sex-icultural industry iu this Colony will depend in a
great measure on a proper training of those who may engage in it. But, I may add, I
foresee no difficulty iu spreading proper information from central establishments as I
have suggested.
I observed, when at Netv Italy, that the Italian children seemed to pick up the
sericultural work, almost by a sort of intuition, even in the short space of time they could
obtain any experience. I was surprised at the knowledge shown by the little girl who
was turning the reeling machine for her mother. She explained to me how the filaments
of silk had to be crossed and passed over the wheel, and many other things, evincing the
greatest possible interest in the silk-reeling. The greatest interest, too, was being taken
in the matter by young English or Australian residents at South Woodburn for some
graine, or eggs, had been obtained from the Italians, and silkworms were being reared by
several, and the occupation of attending to the worms seemed to give unbounded interest
and pleasure. I noticed many indications amongst the residents which convinces me
sericulture would gain ground rapidly after it once becomes fairly well established. If
this industry should be taken to by young members of the community, from feelings of
interest and pleasure, as well as profit, they would very soon become experts if they had
the advantages of proper guidance and instruction.

The expenditure of money made by the Government in connection with the
initiation of sericulture at New Italy has been as follows:
Some expenses were incurred by the Forest Department in obtaining cuttings of
mulberries from Castle Hill, in planting them, and also in sowing mulberry seed. I
cannot obtain particulars as to cost, but I think it might be estimated at about £25.
As no plants have been yet supplied to New Italy by that Department I do not think
this can be charged to sericulture at New Italy.
No other expenditure of public money has ever been made by the Government,
that I can discover, for sericulture, and no scheme has ever yet been formulated to
introduce the industry into the Colony ; nor, in fact, does much, or any, interest appear
to have been taken in the subject beyond the setting apart 1,280 acres for a sericultural
reserve on the Tweed River, selected by Mr. Brady as being a suitable spot to begin
operations. This was proclaimed by Mr. Secretary Farnell on sth December, 1872.
One or two small special leases were granted for sericultural purposes, but I cannot
ascertain that any use was made of them for the purpose applied for. The reserve of
1,280 acres was leased at a nominal rent to Mr. Brady, but as he did not receive the
assistance from the Government, which he affirms he was led to expect, and which he
and others are convinced was intended to be afforded him to carry out his project of
establishing the sericultural industry, he w r as unable to make any use whatever of the
land. He lived near this reserve for many years fully believing that steps would be
taken towards the establishing of the industry, and that his services, experience, and
remarkable discoveries would be availed of; but nothing was ever done.
In the report published by the Commissioners on the International Exhibition held
at the Garden Palace, Sydney, in 1879, on sections 242 to 249, silk and silk fabrics, &c.,
of wffiich I append a copy, marked [ Appendix , No. 2], there appear indications that the
Government at that time wished to take some action with respect to sericulture, for
Mr. Josiah Smale, of Macclesfield, who was a judge in the sections referred to, mentioned
in his report that “ just before leaving Sydney I had an interview with both the Ministers
of Lands and Mines of New South Wales who told me they would do all in their power
to assist sericulture in the Colony. They will lease, say, up to 500 acres at a nominal
rental for this object, but the use of this land must be wholly confined to silk-culture.”
I beg to invite attention to other important matters contained in this report, but I
entirely disagree with his views on the necessity for Chinese labour or any other labour
than will be found available here.


Suggestions and Conclusion.
In submitting my report I feel the greatest difficulty in suggesting a method by
which the Government might effectively aid, foster, or encourage sericulture, without
obtruding on, or interfering with private enterprise.
The real difficulty of establishing sericulture is the fact, remarkable as it is, that
in no part of the British dominions are the English people, or ever have been, in any
place, acquainted with the occupation of silk raising as a productive pursuit. Nowhere
is there to be found that traditional training by father to son and mother to daughter,
which ensures the b«st of all knowledge in a craft which comes and grows, from childhood
upwards, with the practical experience of everyday life. The very difficulty which now
presents itself has been the very difficulty in, former times, which it was necessary to meet
in every European country where sericulture now flourishes.
There is no doubt of the existence of a very general desire, by some persons, to
obtain assistance, and who are confident that success cannot be attained without help,
and I have no doubt that I may be expected to offer a favourable opinion thereon.
Others again probably think the proper course for the Government to take would be to
start Government farms, plantations, and making sericulture a Government enterprise
and paying concern, such as the Eailways, Telegaphs, &c., &c. I feel that I may be
expected to refer to, if not to deal with, these or similar projects as my instructions
intend me to make my report as perfect as I am able.
I believe it will be found that all those whose practical experience justifies them
in speaking with some degree of authority, that they are opposed to the idea of any
interference by the State, in any way, in what should be private enterprise.
Being very much interested in sericulture, some years ago, I attended several
meetings presided over by the late T. S. Mort, and it was there that I first heard Mr.
Charles Brady, give his views with respect to the industry, answering questions, and
giving information, &c. That gentleman expressed himself as being very much opposed
to Government interference with private enterprise, and that Government action should be
confined to providing sound or useful information to be as practical as possible, or some-
thing very much to this effect. At one meeting it was proposed that a joint stock company
should be formed to grow silk and appoint Mr. Brady as manager, but he refused to
become a servant to a number of gentlemen, not one of whom was sufficiently qualified to
give proper instructions, but who were to control everything.
As Mr. Brady is probably one of the best authorities on sericultural matters to
be found anywhere, his opinions on the subject must be of considerable value, and they
deserve great consideration. When visiting him officially, at Antony, on the Tweed
Elver, on more than one occasion, I took the opportunity to question him as to his opinion,
or propose the best way for the Government to assist him to establish a silk industry
suitable to the country, and the peculiar condition of the people to be served. Whilst
disdaining any idea of Government aid to himself individually, or any favour to him
in preference of any other person “ beyond fulfilment of promises volunteered to him
personally,” he strongly approved of the Government causing mulberry plantations being
made on Government land either at public or private cost, getting a number of these
plantations established, and kept in good order, with suitable mulberry-trees properly
trained and cared for, until fit for silk purposes, in as many different localities as possible
in the Colony, to be let or leased, the same as other Government properties improved or
not, and their appurtenances, such as sheep or cattle runs, wharfs, &c., &c. Mr. Brady
also sketched out a more definite plan which has not, so far as I am aware, been touched
upon publicly, and this as well as his ideas previously mentioned, he requested me, at
the time he explained them to me, to treat as confidential, but Mr. Brady has now given
me permission to use them if I think proper, for he says Times have changed. Want in
many quarters presses, and the public mind is more open, or less indifferent and less
callous than it has been, to the necessity for the better use of the territorial recourses of
the Colony natural and accidental.”


Mr. Brady thinks that action by the Government might necessitate legislation,
but he considered “ that it might be quite practicable as a matter of business with private
persons of fortune, who, having land available for, and not jealously indisposed, even
if they had eventually to part with some of it, would be willing to do so on the proba-
bility that any amount of success and presence of additional population on the portion
alienated would necessarily advance the value of the remainder, and that an understanding
should be arrived at between two parties.
In faith of an understanding, a binding agreement should be made on capitalists
side to conditionally sell, a defined portion of land, say, not less than 320 acres, or more
than 640 acres. The seller to securely fence the whole on every side, put up a fairly
good family dwelling besides other necessary buildings, improvements, &c., and from
time to time, say from three to five years, furnish funds to cultivate, plant with mulberry-
trees in paddocks specially prepared and so on. The buyer to become at start an
inchoate purchaser bound to residence, to care for continuously, to faithfully carry out
by his own labour, knoivledge, and experience of himself, family, and servants with the
assistance of others if needed and desirable. During the progress of these operations,
while the mulberries are growing the buyer should, if not already acquainted with
proper methods of rearing silkworms, learn and extend his and his family’s experience
by managing such small quantities of worms as from time to time could be easily
attempted by means of food actually at hand on the spot. As soon as production made
payments or reimbursement practicable, the buyer should begin to pay off the whole
cost by instalments agreeably to understanding. The amount and cost of land, improve-
ments, and all outlay provided by seller with interest, &c., to be computed actuarially
and capitalised on the basis of a moderate rate, say, 4|- or 5 per cent., and not exceeding
5| per cent, for the whole time stipulated. The amounts and periods of payments
adjusted according to agreement. Calculations to be founded on accounts submitted to
a competent recognised actuary. The whole of the payments being accomplished the
place and all its belongings would become the absolute property of the quasi-tenant or
buyer and unencumbered.
I do not venture to either criticise or recommend Mr. Brady’s proposals, but I
respectfully submit them for information and consideration. They Avould seem somewhat
to have been suggested by Messrs. Chaffey Brothers’ Mildura irrigation scheme in
Victoria ; but to my certain knowledge they had been formulated long prior to the
origination of that scheme.
Mr. Brady’s advice was that Government action should mainly be to afford much-
needed and desired knowledge and education, and, to some extent, assist to make the
knowledge and experience practical. His plan requires that suitable land be chosen, in
extent, not merely to allow considerable acreage of mulberry plantation for family,
rather than what might be understood by village settlement. Land enough to permit of
general farming, dairying, &c., besides silkworm rearing, so that independent of silk-
raising, each holding might be permanent and self-sustaining. This he considered an
important feature.
At first sight, Mr. Brady thinks, his project will very probably appear extravagant
and impracticable, for many reasons, “ a narrow-minded land-grabber,” as he expressed
himself, would demur. No security to the seller, and “ undoubtedly a very great diffi-
culty would be the demands on a seller’s powers of trust as to the good faith, the
reliability of continuous power on part of the buyer and his family to perform his
or their share, and these would largely depend on the stamp and disposition of the
parties.” This difficulty, he considered, would thin out a good deal upon careful
consideration, and would not be in any way, and certainly not in every case, very serious.
Nor would the practical risks of loss be very great if discreetly dealt with. “ Indeed, as
a matter of fact, men of the world, level, hard-headed men of business, daily incur much
greater real risks, without loss and without inconvenience, more than is easilv remedied


"by either party.” Mr. Brady is of opinion that “ there may be practical ways or methods
by which common-sense persons, exercising their own will and pleasure, public-spirited
persons with means, if so disposed, could, without any very serious risk, do a very good
and valuable service, whether Government should decide to make, or not to make,
Government plantations of mulberries, with intention to let them to approved tenants.”
His great thought and desire is to enlist, at the very first, in the very beginning, the
class which he regards as the most desirable and useful. He informed me that there
were, to his own knowledge, quite a large number of well, and often highly-educated
and accomplished persons, both male and female, many in the prime of life, without
occupation to do, profitable to themselves or to the country, A large proportion of
these, with some preliminary information and training, would certainly prove successful
silk-growers. At first, and for some time, there would be only small supplies of
mulberry leaf available, and consequently but few could be employed. “ The time and
active energies of these most valuable members of the community produce nothing at
present. But little is known of them, so entirely unobtrusive are they, but their
desires are known to some who would wish to serve them and serve the country.
Employment, something to do they would have, but cannot find.” Mr. Brady is warmly
in favour of an earnest effort to enlist as many as possible of these into the ranks
of learners and beginners.
One important feature in the scheme would be that, “ the active parties (the
buyer and his family) owing to the uncertainties of health and life, it would be a great
safeguard, to assist as far as possible, a risk of rupture or halt, at any rate until the farm
or plantation had had time to grow into a condition of profit, that other members of
the family interested, being in a position take up the enterprise. Apart from all
philanthropic motives, which as a matter of business seldom trouble an investor—the
presence of a superior class of persons working on only a single farm in his neighbourhood,
with but moderate success, would bring settlement of the best kind, and put a value on
all the surrounding properties especially in remote, or not tempting localities. To some
minds it would seem ridiculous to think of taking trouble laying out their money and so
on, for the benefit of someone else, most probably a stranger, and the whole thing to
pass away from them. Undoubtedly my notion would appear chimerical, at any rate to
those of shallow or merely superficial reflection, but, even in a country like this, I believe
there are many, a good many, who do not regard their fellows in an absolutely selfish
view as mere animals to make money by ; but who would willingly adopt, or further by
their influence and their money, be instrumental in creating practically a practical means
to improve the condition of many persons not so happily circumstanced as themselves,
whose presence, in a field at present unoccupied, is most desirable to cultivate.”
It seems to me to be evident that it will be necessary for the State to take some
action and afford some preliminary support to sericulture, before it can become an
established industry, and I feel convinced that any efforts and expenditure that may be
made by the State will be quite justified by the probability of this industry becoming of
very great importance to the Colony, if initiatory steps be well and carefully directed.
But, I respectfully submit, that I believe the attempt, will most certainly fail, if matters
in connection with it are permitted to drift about without any guidance or proper
supervision, in the same manner as the work alrealy begun, with the best possible
intentions, has gradually, perhaps accidentally, but undoubtedly, drifted until it has
become, pretty well, no one’s care and no one’s business, and in a fair way to become a
failure.
I believe that it will be in the best interests of the Colony that the work of
introducing the industry generally bo taken up by the Government, and I do not_ think
it will need a very large expenditure of money; and I believe the present time is
opportune. Considering that very large sums of money are expended annually for
the encouragement of various branches of industry, such as prospecting, dairying, the
distribution of seeds and plants to farmers and others, inspection of agriculture, large-


prizes to agricultural shows, prizes for farms, &c., subsidies to agricultural and kindred
societies, schools of arts, on agricultural education, technical education, and so on; I think
that sericultural education and encouragement might fairly claim a share.
The evidence I have given in this report, will, I believe, remove all anxiety of a
deficiency of suitable labour being likely to occur. Argument to the contrary can
only be founded on supposition, because so far as I can possibly ascertain, sericulture
in this Colony has never reached a stage where its progress has been stopped or even
impeded by a want of suitable labour. I may mention as having a bearing on this
matter, that it has been found quite possible to produce butter in the Colonies at a
sufficiently low cost to enable vendors to enter into successful competition with it on
the London market, against that produced by the cheap European labour of France,
Denmark, Holland, &c., notwithstanding the high cost of carriage. And so, too, will
our sericultural products be successful in consequence, as with the butter of our most
favourable and magnificent climate.
If it be decided that steps shall be taken to aid, foster, or encourage sericulture,
I respectfully suggest that it would be advisable as an important factor towards success,
that if it is possible the services of Mr. Charles Brady be secured to advise, supervise in
the field, and instruct on sericultural matters ; and it will be of the very greatest
importance that arrangements be made with that gentleman for him to give instruction
to intelligent persons in his method of artificial hybernation, &c. Or arrangements
might be made whereby he could supply graine, or eggs, at periods, as required.
Mr. Brady’s local experience and his knowledge of sericulture in all its branches
being remarkable and in fact unique, I am convinced that, it would not be possible to
find anyone else whose advice and assistance in establishing such an important industry
as sericulture may become, could approximate his in any degree. I believe that
although he may be opposed to what he may consider “ Grovernment interference in the
industry,” he may be induced to give his services and co-operation in any reasonable
plan likely to promote and popularise the industry.
I respectfully suggest also that Mr. Eeginald Champ’s services be retained to
carry on the work at New Italy, and that the Italians should receive the expected
assistance they need to complete the work they have begun. That Mr. Champ be paid
at the rate of £250 per annum and a house be provided for him at New Italy, on the
reserve for sericulture, and also that he be allowed forage for one horse. He should be
required to have the 5 acres, already cleared, to be prepared immediately for sowing
mulberry seeds, and planting cuttings at the proper time. This work could be done by
contract, and arrangements might afterwards be made to keep the plantation in proper
order by contract.
I also beg to suggest that it would be most desirable that the large reserve on the
Tweed, which was originally set apart for sericulture be retained for the purpose
intended and that as soon as possible, plantations of mulberry be made there. And
that other reserves in two or three parts of the Colony be secured for the same purpose
as this will be necessary to carry out a proper scheme.
The most important work to begin will be the planting, and the encourage-
ment of planting, varieties of the mulberry for food for silkworms, and this should be
done as speedily as possible. I believe it will be possible to obtain a large and perhaps
sufficient supply of mulberry cuttings of proper sorts, in this Colony, for planting next
season. It would be advisable to supply public schools with plants or cuttings of
varieties, and when the trees attain a sufficient size, cuttings can be distributed and
pupils and persons in the neighbourhood, can become acquainted with the proper
varieties, for the several localities, to plant. Cuttings might also be distributed, to any
gardens, parks, or other grounds subsidised or under the immediate control of the
Grovernment, or public bodies. Many varieties of the mulberry are ornamental and
would become useful for shade trees, even if they may not be required for other
purposes.


I respectfully submit that if the sericultural work be taken in band by the
Grovernment, it must be done cautiously, but at the same time with spirit and vigour.
In conclusion, I beg to invite particular attention to the various appendices to
this report, for these will show more than anything else, being statements of actual
facts, how gigantic the silk industry really is in other countries. The more I reflect on
the matter of sericulture the more and more I am surprised that some branches of it have
never yet become established in Australia, but I really believe this is due in a great
measure to a general ignorance of its importance and potentialities, and also a general
ignorance of the wonderful suitability of the country for the production of the very
best raw silk, which we might arid should produce in New South AVales alone to the
value of millions of £ sterling annually with comparatively little labour, or labour at
present lying dormant, and this may yet be done by a little judicious management and
encouragement, and I respectfully submit that New South Wales being the mother
colony might well take the lead with advantage and no doubt other colonies would
speedily follow.
I have lately been shown some admirable small samples of silk, produced by
pupils attending public and private schools in various parts of the Colony, and some of
them are really excellent, and serve as an indication of what may be done if proper
means are taken to spread proper knowledge on the subject. lam sure the children
would become intensely interested, more particularly so if a little profit crowned their
exertions. It needs but a qualified head, and a few trained assistants to teach and,
direct matters for these youngsters to become an important factor in building up an
immense industry.
I respectfully invite attention to the appendix showing the expenditure, in
shillings and pence, of various countries per head of the population on manufactured
silk goods which have been consumed by those countries ; and particularly to the table
showing Victoria and New South Wales, and the extraordinary difference between the
consumption of silk in the two colonies.
I have taken great' pains to make everything clear, and as concise as is consistent
with the importance of the subject. lam not aware that any report has ever yet been
prepared officially in any of the colonies, or one which contains such information
respecting the whole silk industry by which a thorough grasp of the whole thing can be
obtained.
Although the work of preparing my report has been laborious, it has given me
the greatest pleasure to perform, especially as it may possibly assist in establishing an
immense industry in, and bring wealth to New South AVales.
I have, &c.,

REPORT ON SERICULTURE.
APPENDIX No. 1.
C. Brady, Esq., to the Colonial Secretary.
Sir, Curl Curl, Manly, 17 March, 1870.
I desire to call your attention to a subject which, under present circumstances, may become
of large and immediate importance to the interests of the Colony.
I believe that some time last year a despatch from Lord Granville made this Government
acquainted with the representations of the Silk Supply Association of London, and thereby, both with
the urgent necessity in England for a larger import of silk to make up the actual deficiency of raw
material for manufacture, and also with the excellent opportunity for colonial producers to enter the
market at the present time when not only England, but every continental country, suffers from the
extreme scarcity and high price of this article. The scarcity, owing to the continued devastations by
disease of silkworms all over Europe, in all probability may last for years, and it appears opportune
for me to request your particular consideration of Lord Granville’s despatch, and the contents of this
present letter, which may largely conduce to the future welfare of the Colony.
My own personal knowledge and experience in the treatment of silkworms in New South Wales
and Queensland for several years justify me in expressing my conviction that this part of Australia at
any rate is peculiarly well adapted for the production of cocoons. I began the study of the subject
in 1862, and have since devoted myself exclusively to this pursuit in all its relations, particularly to
experiments and efforts to take advantage of our brilliant atmosphere, and of various food grown in
this climate, to introduce and breed superior races of silkworms, and especially to free them from the
dire disease which now for so many years has all but destroyed an industry yielding annually more
than thirty millions of pounds sterling to the present cultivators of Southern Europe.
My experiences have been most conclusive and satisfactory, and it is proved that the importance
of our proceedings here is not unappreciated in England by persons capable of forming an estimate of
their value.
I am well aware that the public mind is prepossessed with the idea that the growth of silk in
Australia must prove unremunerative on account of the high relative price of labour in the colonies,
but I have never met with even one person who had investigated the subject, or qualified himself in
any way to form an opinion, who held this idea ; in fact, there not only is nothing to prevent silk
being raised as cheaply in Australia as in France or Italy, but there is very good reason to believe
that, favoured as we are by climate and cheap land, we may be in a position to undersell any country
in Europe.
When I first engaged in this enterprise I own I myself entertained some misgiving about the
cost of labour. It was this very circumstance which set me to work to contrive means to obviate what
might prove a serious obstacle to a commercial success in silk-growing in these colonies, and I devised
the plan of multiplying the number of crops obtainable in a single season. In every country besides
this the most valuable worms (being annual only) give but one bi’ood or crop a year, and this occurring
at the most unsettled and precarious period is attended with great risk, and frequently with serious
expenses and casualties, it occurred to me to profit by our long season of clear weather, repeatedly to
take advantage of our opportunities for providing sustenance during many months continuously fcr the
worms, and by managing to have worms to consume the food at such times as the many different
varieties of mulberry are severally in perfection. This is done by employing cold and moisture as well
as warmth in the preservation of the graine, and also by having many varieties of mulberry silkworms
adapted by their nature to thrive on the different varieties of food plant.
To thoroughly carry out my plan I imported at great expense mulberry plants of every country,
the quality of which at all gave hopes of obtaining useful sorts, and I also, at even much greater cost,
and after many and repeated failures, succeeded in introducing and rearing in this Colony and in
Queensland all the most celebrated and choicest breeds of silkworms from every silk-growing country.
A large number of these have, after years of severe labour and close attention, become thoroughly
acclimatised, and many important races, under the influence of careful as well as special treatment,
prolonged through several generations, have become freed from the taint of disease and are now healthy.
I believe the Government has long entertained a wish to afford our settlers in the interior—and
more particularly the younger portion—instruction, and the means to profit by the same wonderful
source of wealth which renders the rural population in silk-growing countries so prosperous ; but there
have been available neither the special knowledge nor the food plants, and not even one single species or
variety of profitable silkworm had been established in the Colony until I had the good fortune to succeed
in introducing and naturalising them. Now the case is different to what it was some years ago, and I
submit for your consideration the expediency of the Government at once adopting measures to impart
information and spread the industry in such districts of the Colony as may offer a fair prospect of
doing well.


I would urge upon your attention the financial importance of silk. First, the eggs (graine) small
as they are, and prolific as is the animal, it is a well-known fact that Europe in one year paid to Japan
alone cash to the amount of £1,250,000, the next year nearly one million and a half. The last season
in Japan was a failure, and, notwithstanding the money was there to pay. enough eggs are only found
to take the foreigners’ money to the extent of half the quantity demanded. In Europe this sprint
'X 1 " 1 Ma y)> iS estimated that to supply the demand in France and Italy alone not less thaw
7,000,000 ounces of eggs are required, the present money value (an exorbitant one) is nearly £B,OOO 000
and of these 7,000,000 ounces required but 6,000,000 are forthcoming, so that in this one item there
would be a very large opening for a new export from Australia. I ought, however, to say that it would
be preposterous for anyone to entertain the idea of supplying such a market without adequate knowledge
sort of stock. I may add, as a matter of information, that in every country the pro-
duction of eggs is distinct from the production of silk, and that the producers of silk, as a rule, do not
use eggs from their own stock, but purchase every season graine grown by others than themselves. The
production of good seed is a special craft.
Cocoons are silk, and in this primitive condition should form a new staple in our exports. It is
usually thought necessary to wind or reel the cocoons to render the produce marketable, but such is
not the case ; the cocoons thoroughly dried (or, more correctly speaking desiccated) in a proper manner
may lie packed and pressed wdth hydraulic pressure. If properly desiccated (the grub inside being
pressed into dust), upon unpacking and immersion in water the cocoons resume their original shape
| uninjured. Cocoons thus treated may be sold to the merchants or to the mills in bulk for proper
reeling according to the purpose for which the raw silk is required, but wound or reeled silk, unless
. so handled or prepared to meet the requirements of the throwster, is merely of value as “ w'aste” and
of no value as “ raw silk.” The markets of Europe are open for illimitable quantities, and the nature
of silk being unlike that of any other material there is no danger of a substitute coming into competition,,
but rather that as civilisation and trade extend so will the demand for silk increase. It is to the pro-
■ ductiou of cocoons that the attention of growers in this Colony should be directed.
There are many districts in the Colony suited to the rearing of out-door silkworms. Among
others not yet satisfactorily established I have introduced three different species, the most valuable of
their class, now domesticated in the Colony, producing severally one brood, two broods, and three
broods in one season—first the “ Yama” feeding on common English oak (quercus, of several varieties)
furnishes light-green silk of the most superior kind ; it is the most valuable of all, but the most
difficult to rear ; the two latter the “ Ferny,” also feeding on the same kind of oak as the Yama and
{the “ Ailant,” feeding on ailantus glandulom, find the climate and food singularly congenial and thrive
;to perfection. The natural increase of such prolific creatures, multiplying two and three times in one
Australian season, must necessarily yield, under proper conditions and intelligent management, a
prodigious amount of cocoons.
It is manifest that silk-growing in these colonies, once established or fairly set going, would give
lucrative employment to large numbers of persons of both sexes, and tend greatly to elevate as well
as to enrich them ; time was when the peasants of Europe were at least as unimpressionable and as
difficult to receive new ideas as our own wide and thinly spread population is now supposed to be.
Such as our colonists are, we may at least consider that if worthy of being entrusted Math political
power they are not unworthy, by reason of their want of intelligence, of having such attention bestowed
on their welfare as may in some degree make up to them for the disadvantages under which people
who live in the bush necessarily labour ; in truth, our distant settlers have but few benefits conferred
upon them, and any new export raised in any part of the Colony enriches not only the producers but
is capital gained to the community.
Nor is the production of silk in these colonies without interest in regard to immigration. I have-
stated in another quarter my conviction that the exhibition of colonial grown silk and healthy silkworm
graine of good quality by authority of our Government at some of the chief seats of this industry in
Europe, would have a powerful effect in directing the thoughts of enterprising and energetic people
towards these shores. I am sure that authentic information as to our capabilities and reasonable
facilities would induce families skilled in many arts and employments, which have yet found no footing
here, to come amongst us ; not a few would come at their own expense, or at any rate pay part,
bringing with them (for silk-growers are generally well to do), besides their experience and labour,
their tools and appliances, and some capital. We should implant at very small cost amongst us new
industries suited to our soil and climate, while the immigrants, from whatever country they might come,
would enjoy the advantages of our liberal institutions and laud policy. The first step is to let people
know that they may find here fair scope for the particular occupations in which they have been brought
up. Silk-growers in all countries are generally the most temperate and intelligent of their class.
Manufacturers and capitalists are eager for new sources of supply, and would require no other induce-
ment to turn their attention to this country than the demonstration that certain results are obtained.
That we can do as well in a general sense as any country cannot be doubted, and in what has actually
been done in eradicating disease and in multiplying the power of production, it is plain we are in
advance of every other ; the reputation of Australia is already such as to favourably prepossess
inquiring minds.
D


My operations and experiments have all been carried on by myself, unsupported by any
extraneous aid ; what I have effected alone and single-handed is work that, in every other country
where any parallel success has been accomplished, has been done by Governments, with the resources
and at the cost of the State. I take no reproach to myself for not having before communicated with
you on this subject; and, I think, that the very fact of my having effected what I have done without
assistance is valid argument whyGovernmcnts should be very reticent in taking up every likely scheme
for promoting new industries ; but now that success is a demonstrated fact, and the opportunity so
good, I venture to suggest to you that it may be sound policy not to ignore the experience and know-
ledge gained. There is no secret or patent in my proceedings or methods. I have been ever ready,
and always have shown living stock in every stage of growth at whatever period of the year informa-
tion has been sought of me ; and I have made the mode of operation clear to every inquirer ; what I
have found out with much labour and difficulty, and by suffering many failures, is plain now, and the
way is easy for anyone to follow. It is true I have special qualities, education, training, and oppor-
tunities peculiar to myself for the work, but is it social or political wisdom to wait until the masses of
untutored minds become spontaneously imbued with craving for knowledge and instruction, and
undertake the toil, and incur the anxiety of doing over and over again, each one for himself, that which
now once done is done for all ?
I, therefore, shall be happy, should you determine to pursue the matter, to afford you, without
reserve, any information you may be in need of, and any personal assistance I can render. The
Government already possesses several useful varieties of mulberry and other silk-producing plants at the
Botanic Gardens, and I would willingly supply other varieties in my possession in which they are
deficient. In regard to the silkworms themselves, the case is difficult; besides myself, there is no one
in the Colony, as far as lam aware, qualified to judge of their value. It by no means follows that
what succeeds with me will do equally well with inexperienced, and perhaps careless or clumsy hands;
hence, I am not disposed to risk the liability to reproach, or to be held responsible for the possible
failures of others. Should you, therefore, approve of my suggestion, and accept as a free gift from me
such stock as may be required, I will on timely notice, furnish any quantity of acclimatised silkworms
or silkworm’s eggs of any varieties, race, or species I possess, that may be needful to spread the culture
throughout the Colony. I say as a free gift, as this would relieve me to some extent from discomfort
in case of an unsatisfactory result. If the worms perished or did not turn out well, the loss would be
mine ; and if, as I think we may reasonably hope, they take [a fair hold of the country, I entertain
no doubt that a liberal legislature in due time would mark its sense of service rendered by a private
individual, and requite my endownment by a grant of land, or in such way as it may deem appropriate.
I have, &c.,
CHARLES BRADY.

Extract from the Official Record of the Sydney International Exhibition of 1879, pages 169 1/0.
Coming to classes 242 to 249, “ silk and silk fabrics, &c.,” France and Great Britain proved,
apart from a few manufactured silks shown by Japan, to be the chief exhibitors of the completed
fabric; but, irrespective of the exhibits of cocoons and raw silks in the Japanese Court, New South Wales
showed herself well forward in the production of cocoons, and also of raw and reeled silks. Sericulture
has so far been experimented upon in New South Wales as to show the Colony is eminently suited for
the cultivation of the mulberry and the successful rearing of the silkworm, these being, it is generally
understood, two of the necessary conditions for successful silk-culture. The experiments of the largest
kind within the Colony of New South Wales, have been conducted, we beleive, at the Tweed River, in the
northern extremity, and close to the Queensland border, by Mr. Brady; at Corowa, in the south of the
Colony, near the border of the Colony of Victoria, the leading proprietrix of the latter place being Mrs.
Bladen-Neill (of the Ladies Silk Association of Corowa), who will be found an exhibitor of the products of
the enterprise of the Association ; and at Albury, in the same district, by Mr. Thomas Affleck, who have
all devoted much attention to this enterprise. With the exception of Mr. Brady, who did not show,
the results of the silk industry were shown by exhibits. We have mentioned two conditions as
being necessary to successful silk-culture. A third and all important condition is pointed out by Mr.
Josiah Smale, of Macclesfield, a judge of this class at the Sydney International Exhibition, who, m
reply to queries put to him by letter after his return to England, when the Garden Palace had been
officially closed (and to which country he had taken with him samples of raw Australian silks of which
samples he had been a judge), as to the commercial prospects of sericulture within the Australian
Colonies, suggested that cheap labour was one of the essentials to the success of this particular
industry. Mr. Smale, whose letter at all events, in its Australian application and as pointing to a
more than probable future source of supply of the raw material to the English market, is of considerable
value, says: —“Just before leaving Sydney, I had an interview with the Ministers for Lands and
Mines of New South Wales, and they told me they would do all in their power to assist sericulture in
the Colony. They will lease (say) up to 500 acres at a nominal rental for this object, but the use of
this land must be almost wholly confined to silk-culture. The labour will be the difficulty. If you
could import Chinese who have been used to the work, it might be done. There is a Chinese resident


! Greol ’g e - street > Sydney, who is anxious to go into the matter ; he wants me to return to the
Colony and get the land, and he says that if I do so he will find the labour, &c. ; but I cannot well
ea\ e here. In reply to your first question as to the reeling of your samples, it is altogether imperfect
Mnc h cG?tSn g s si 086 Sampl< l° f what we are buying to-day at 21s. per lb. (of 16 of), laid down at
Macclesfield. Silks are very cheap now-they have not been cheaper for the last twenty-five years.
Good silk is spoilt, and its quality is lost unless properly reeled. Your samples ’’—(those of Mr. J 0
Johannsen, of Aorth Shore, near Sydney, an exhibitor at the Garden Palace, at whose request the
mqmnes were preferred from the offices of the Sydney International Exhibition to Mr. Smale—“ lam
glad to mtorm you, have the quality, and, if produced in quantity and properly reeled, they would
be appreciated by us manufacturers. I enclose you also a sample of Bengal silk which is produced in
India. The quality of this is not so good as that of yours ;we pay 16s. to 17s. per lb. for it made up
into long skeins, and put into bales, each containing from 130 to 160 lb. in weight. Of Chinese silks
i also enclose you a sample. This silk is also inferior to Italian or Bengalese : it is always reeled
more closely and more unevenly-it is also badly reeled. The price of this silk (China) ranges from
s. to 16s. per lb. m bales of about 108 or 110 Ib. each. The samples you produce will compare
nearest to the -Is. quality. The Japanese at the Sydney Exhibition, and the Chinese merchants to
w iave referred, told me that New South Wales was the best place in the world for silk-growing,
and if you could get labour it would pay well.” s>
It may here be stated that, apart from the three establishments which we have referred to at the
I weed River, Corowa, and Albury, sericulture is elsewhere undertaken throughout the Colony, but
only to a small extent, and rather for purposes of experiments and finding therein an elegant employ-
ment for ladies and children of families than for any hope or wish for profit.

Silk Industry.—An adjourned meeting of the Silk Committee, held at the rooms of the Agricultural
oociety, on Saturday morning. Present : The Rev. L. B. Pacilis, Mr. James Manning, Mr. Brady,
and others. Mr. Howard Reed, in the Chair. After some observations from the Chairman relative to
the desire of the Government for more precise information to guide them when placing the proposal
for assistance before Parliament, the Rev. L. B. Pacilis moved, “ That a sub-committee be appointed
tor the purpose—lst, of preparing all the information required by the Hon. Colonial Secretary, at
tne last interview with the deputation ; 2nd, of devising a practical scheme in accordance with the
ideas expressed by the said Colonial Secretary, such scheme to be submitted to the Government at the
next interview; 3rd, of assisting Mr. Brady in the compilation of a pamphlet, to contain full and
detailed information about silk culture. That this Committee be formed of Messrs. Mort, Dangar
Reed, Prince, Manning, and the mover.”
This resolution being seconded by Mr. Manning, it was carried. The work of the sub-committee
appointed will be submitted to all members at a general meeting. Mr. Brady undertook to compile the
information required in readiness for the sub-committee by Thursday morning. The following suggestion
was received from Mr. James Manning, and favourably entertained. The Chairman considered that
in the furtherance of this work the co-operation of the ladies on the committee was desirable.
Mr. Manning said : I feel I should be neglecting the opportunity of giving expression to reflections in
connection with this very interesting subject of sericulture, should I fail in giving utterance to
suggestions that might be considered worthy of adoption. Not only for the sake of the grand com-
mercial results that would accrue to the Australian Colonies generally, by the extensive culture of the
silkworm, but also from a social point, I believe that much good might follow. My ideas on the
subject are of a practical and social nature, and are based on a very long experience of a life in the
bush of Australia. I know intimately what are the capabilities of a bush life, and what are the
•deficiencies and wants of the same, and I therefore think it can be easily shown how the interests of
the silkworm growth might go hand in hand with the furtherance of the social position of our lives in
the bush. By way of introduction to the important facilities afforded to the connected Australian
Colonies for the production of silkworm graine for Europe, I wish to remark that nature has done
more for us here than most gentlemen who are present may probably be aware of ; our Australian
Alps, and in the vicinity of Kiandra, offer the best possible position for the artificial hybernation of
that silkworm graine which could come from the summer production of every part of New South
Wales, Victoria, and Queensland. At a high region beyond Kiandra, the great receiving-house
could be built, and the graine be stored there that would be intended for exportation, and for
our Colonial distribution for reproduction. There in the region of heavy constant snows, the manager
of such central receiving establishment could receive eggs from the various so-called “ grainers” from the
interior, and, by the adoption of a proper method, the controlling of the maturing of the graine could
be insured to any required and given time.
The origination of this idea of artificial hybernation for the purpose of controlling the hatching
of the silkworm eggs, is claimed by Mr. Brady since 1864, but Monsieur Duclaux and Monsieur
Pasteur speak of it as their own discovery in 1868-69, and Monsieur Roland, in Switzerland, owes his
success in silkworm breeding to a rigid system of natural or open-air rearing and hybernation adopted


by him on the Jura mountains, near Neufchatel. This all important retardation could with certainty
be obtained by having a suitable building that should be so constructed as to protect its interior in the
spring months against the infiltration of heat from the sun, and the temperature could be lowered to
any required degree, in perfectly light rooms, by utilising the snows at hand, by converting them into
ice in some approved form. Such ice could then be stored inside the building, where the graine could
be kept, and both the graine and ice could go away together to Goulburn and Sydney, and to Albury and
Melbourne for exportation anywhere under fresh refrigerating arrangements from those places, or be
distributed anywhere over the inland parts of the contiguous colonies ; and the removal of the graine
from Kiandra could be so arranged that it would arrive at all destinations (whether to France or
Italy or to our own colonies) exactly in proper time to suit requirements, with such natural facilities
for the prolonged and healthy hybernation of the eggs or graine, it would seem to be palpable that all
these colonies should avail themselves (confederately or separately) of the advantages afforded them
of supplying Europe with healthy graine to any extent that may be required, and of our extending the
operation to the production of raAV silk ; and thus we could successfully compete with Japan, which
wonderful country already exports to Europe annually £1,250,000 worth of silkworm eggs only, for
reproduction in Italy and in France, where they have ceased to use their own graine for silkworm
rearing, because of established diseases in all graine reared in Europe. One mail steamer alone took
last year from Japan silkworm eggs to the value of half a million. So far, perhaps, so good, but you may
say, how’ are we to set to work to grow mulberry-trees, have the suitable buildings, and adopt proper
labour, under skilled instructors, all over the interior of our respective colonies to avail ourselves of
such a promising industry ? My answer is this : Let every sheep proprietor grow mulberry-trees
enough, and close to his woolshed, and in quantity proportioned to the size of such shed. After a few
years growth and the annual shearing of the sheep being over, let the battened floors and the yards of
the sheds be cleansed and free from ammoniacal effluvia, and the further and light arrangements for
feeding silkworms and for cocooning the grown worms, being done under instructions, the graine from
Kiandra, should arrive on the station, ready to burst into life there when the mulberry-trees there w’ould
be in their fullest vigour. But here again you will ask who is to attend to the industry and work out
its details from the hatching of the eggs to the cocooning season, two months later ? My reply
to this is Let every sheep proprietor, where the mulberry trees are developed, hand over the
use of the empty station shed to his wife, sisters, and lady friends, for the purposes of sericulture to be
carried on in the same form as Mrs. Colonel Keil has done in I ictoria. Then I would propose that the
ladies should keep the profits of their own labour. This arrangement being conceded, I have little
hesitation in saying that this plan, if judiciously carried out, would meet with general favour ; and if
such views were carried into effect, I would warrant that the silkworm season would be looked forward
to in the bush with much more interest than the shearing time. It would become the season for friends
from Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane to congregate at the cheerful and busy homes of their lady
friends in the bush. For the two months all would be life and activity among the ladies and their
servants, with the daily occupation at the silk-shed ; and even the gentlemen of the station and of
the neighbourhood would, I doubt not, render assistance to the busy work. If the sheep proprietors
would adopt this idea, and begin to plant mulberry trees, their example would soon be followed by
free selectors, boundary-riders, and hut-keepers, throughout all the accessible parts of the interior, and
thus, I think, that by the adoption of such a plan, the important silkworm interest w’ould receive the
greatest possible stimulus at the least possible expense, at the same time that the social condition of
the interior of the country would become enhanced in a high degree.
Sydney Mail, Saturday, 11 July, 1874, p. 37.
We are glad to perceive that the interest in the silk industry is not narrowed down to the question of
providing Mr. Brady with £1,500. That object seems to be dropped, and the attention of the Silk
Committee —if that body continues to exist —is to be given to spreading information, and promoting
the growth of the mulberry. Inasmuch as this committee is without funds, and no proposition is yet
made to raise any, we expect that these two objects are likely to be carried out rather by the Agri-
cultural Society. It will be seen by the letter addressed by Mr. Brady to Mr. Mort, as chairman of
the committee, that he is quite content to go on quietly by himself, continuing to give information to
any persons who may desire to associate themselves with him in sericulture. Obviously the first thing
to be done is to show people that there is money to be made, and then how they are to proceed to
make it. We hoped that Mr. Brady, acting on the invitation of the committee, would have done the
first, and the second also, but apparently he prefers addressing himself separately to individuals than
to the public generally. The following is a letter addressed to the chairman of the Silk Committee
by Mr. Brady, and omitted from our late report: —-“I wish you wifl be good enough to explain
to the meeting that on no terms whatever will I accept any money contributions from the
public. An idea seems to prevail that I cannot get on without the public, and that the industry
about which my name is so unfortunately identified, must languish for want of means to
maintain it in its infancy. The idea is fallacious, our days of infancy are over, it is true we are young,
and have not yet gained a full growth , but young as we are, we are productive, and every season


does and must see us not only increasing in strength and stature, but in a geometrically increasing ratio in
beneficial results from the growth already established. We want to expand, and although you seem
to think that this expansion or success, as you phrase it, may be most economically supported or
provided for by friends assisting me individually to extend my own operations, I yet venture to
express my difference of opinion. To provide an export of consideration it is manifest numbers are
required—numbers of workers, and numbers of plantations—though I and my friends, the owners now
of other young plantations, are able to provide for our small beginnings, to be content (and with
reason very content) with the small returns past and present, the uttermost we could do for a long
time, will not make a produce of a magnitude to induce or divert a trade like that, which in so short a
time has sprung up in Japan. Japan had, when the demand for graine began, plenty of mulberries ;
her people had the wit to see their opportunity and bled the Europeans for ‘ graine’ above a few good
millions of pounds sterling in hard coin, a large amount indeed, for their import of money annually looks
respectable alongside our New South Wales export of gold. Now our New South Wales mulberry
plantations are very few and very far between, and I think it would be a very good exercise of the functions
of the Silk Committee to stimulate the formation of mulberry plantations in all suitable localities.
The cost of production and net returns for silk culture have been so often stated in print, I am
surprised the subject has not gained more attention. I can but reiterate what I have repeatedly
pointed out, namely, that it is not so much indifference to the advantages as diffidence in the people
who are prompted to engage in an entirely new occupation—people who have no knowledge about
silkworms are naturally and rightly reluctant to venture without proper and reliable counsel and
assistance. Herein again I say there is scope for the influence of a Silk Committee. It is idle to
point to the success of a few individuals who have sacrificed heavily to gain the experience
which has caused their success. To make the knowledge and experience of the few beneficial to the
many is a special matter in which I would invoke the action of the committee.” The plan of operation
proposed by Mr. James Manning is novel, and perhaps for that reason is likely to take. We should
scarcely have ventured to suppose that men given to sheep and bullocks would have condescended
to silkworms, but he speaks from the raised platform, and with knowledge of the feelings of squatters.
If he thinks the silk industry would find favour with them, perhaps it would, and could they only be
brought to see a good deal of profit with little trouble attended it, probably prejudices would be
overcome. Besides he attacks the squatters on the weak side—he makes it a wife’s question.
We accord, however, with the opinion expressed in the following information respecting
silk culture in China, which has been forwarded to us by Mr. George Peell, namely, that the chief
dependence must be on the small farmers and horticulturists. To secure the growth of the mulberry
by them is the great point to be looked to. Having resided in Ningpo and Shanghai for some years,
and having occasionally to make journeys into the interior on business of a mercantile nature, I had
opportunities of seeing a little of both of the cultivation of the mulberry and also of the production of
silk, but not being peculiarly interested in that branch of business I did not devote to it the attention
I otherwise might have done. I was several times on the borders of the great silk district, and stayed
for a time with the Imperial forces then investing Hanchow which was held by the Taiping rebels.
One thing that struck me much was the evidence of former wealth and prosperity that were everywhere
visible in strong contrast to the then present ruin, devastation, and misery, andwhich was nothing to what
was to follow. Hanchow was one of the great centres of the silk trade, and was a place of enormous wealth.
This, however, cannot be laid to the account of the silk industry alone, though that undoubtedly
contributed more than anything else to it. The population had evidently been very great, and was
so still, where the contending armies had not passed. The country seemed to be subdivided into very
small plots, and nearly all the houses or clusters of habitations contained several families—commonly,
the old grandfather, and all his descendants. The soil where the mulberry seemed to flourish best was
a strong loam of yellow or red colour, and trees were almost invariably planted along the sides of the
canals or on small rises, the intervening spaces being devoted to crops apparently requiring more
moisture. The kind of mulberry was a strong vigorous tree with broad, glossy, dark leaves. It is
no doubt peculiarly suited to the soil, position, and climate. The climate is different to anything we
experience in this Colony, it being very cold in winter and excessively hot and moist in summer. The
country is a dead level plain, but a few feet above high-water mark, broken and occasionally very
high, rough hills of rough granite mingled with quartz.
I have travelled for as many as 20 miles at once, seeing almost nothing but mulberry trees ; I
say almost, because although the population depended on the silk as their chief production and main-
stay, yet being all small proprietors or tenants, they have to cultivate many other things to give them
occupation at other seasons, besides which the Chinese peasants, like some of our farmers, grow every-
thing they can for their own consumption, and a little more. The selling or interchange of leaves and
grain seemed to be prevalent, those having too much of either for their own use easily finding
purchasers for their surplus. It is interesting and amusing to see the people, mostly women and old
men, bringing their silk for sale, some with but a very few ounces, others far more. I witnessed it for
some days in a small village where the European agent of a large firm had taken up his quarters, he
had a staff of Chinese, some to value the silk according to quality, theschroffs or cashiers to pay for it,
and the compradores, or head clerks, to manage affairs generally. There were portions of this district
soon afterwards entirely depopulated, no human being to be seen for spaces of 40 or 50 miles, except


some small parties of soldiers, and not a tree of any description remaining. The rebels threatened to
cut down the mulberry trees if the Europeans assisted the Imperialists, but it remained for the latter
to do it, cutting down and destroying everything for fuel, or in mere wantonness. The authorities after-
wards commenced bringing people from other parts of the Empire to resettle the country, the original
population having vanished off the face of the earth. It seems to me that silk-producing can be made
a success in this country in time, but it must be in or near centres of population, and be looked to as
an auxiliary, and not as a primary means of support. We must look to the farmers, fruit-growers,
market gardeners, and others in a small way, for the principal producers, and the first thing will be to
show them that it will pay, and then show them how to go to work. From what I have seen, the
mulberry could be planted in any good garden ground, like peach or plum trees, and the intervening
spaces cultivated. The value of sericulture can hardly, I think, be overestimated.
Nothing could exceed the opulence and luxury formerly enjoyed by the better classes in the silk
districts of China ; while, for a purely peasant class, the labourers were, I believe, in their own way,
better off than any others in the world. No other product but silk could, I think, have produced similar
results, and I see no reason why, in course of time, it should not be the means of giving healthy employ-
ment and large returns to numbers of our growing population.

SERICULTURE AT LYONS AND SMYRNA.
The following particulars are obtained from three official Consular Reports to the American Govern-
ment on continental silk culture, which appear in the Washington Blue-book for August, 1882. Consul
Peixotto, of Lyons, on the 29th June, last, says that febrine, which for twenty years has sterilised the
French silk crop, has almost completely disappeared. Recent experience shows that the worms are
now as healthy as at any previous epoch, although the supply of food has proved inadequate. This has
been owing to the fact that some years ago when sericulture was plunged in gloom on account of disease
thousands of mulberry trees were uprooted, and other shrubs, notably the vine, planted in their place.
Phylloxera has in turn so materially interfered with viticulture that, encouraged by the decrease in the
virulence and prevalence of the various silkworm maladies, the peasantry are once more turning their
attention to the mulberry, and a revival in sericulture on a large scale in France is confidently anticipated
soon. “ There are few industries,” Mr. Peixotto continues, “that present so much attraction to those
engaged in it as that of .silk. Youth is scarcely ever too young, old age too feeble, but what work, and
pleasant work, may be found in this branch of agriculture and commerce.”
Again writing to his Government on the sth July, the same gentleman, after a survey of the
mutations of the French silk industry up to a recent date, alludes to the success achieved by M. Pasteur
in combatting the various silkworm diseases by the aid of the microscope. It appears that Pasteur’s
method of examination made way but slowly among the silk farmers of France and elsewhere. During
the silk season of 1880 and 1881, however, his system has been thoroughly tested with the result that
the appetites of the immense mob of hungry, healthy, ravenous silkworms produced could scarcely be
satisfied by the diminished harvest of mulberry leaves available. Since then the lessons taught by the
distinguished savant have been still further acquired to such purpose that in 1882, with a purposely
limited, but entirely healthy brood of worms, enough food was forthcoming, and the hitherto dreaded
pebrine and flacherie are quickly subsiding into phantoms of the past; but the reeling difficulty remains,
and is likely to prove a source of anxiety for some time to come, unless some marked improvements
in the mechanical treatment of cocoons be affected. Whilst sericulture continued moderate!}' prosperous
before the rapid spread of the various silkworm maladies unhinged the industry, the filature resources
of France were ample. Latterly, however, many of the silk mills were diverted to other purposes, so
that the present reeling and spinning plant is said to be short by at least 30 per cent. Nor is this the
worst; the mere augmentation of machinery and buildings might easily be accomplished, but as the
former workers are scattered or have attached themselves to other employments, skilled labour, which
require several years to train, is scarcely to be obtained. Hence, as Mr. Peixotto justly argues, the
necessity for automatic machinery, the invention and perfecting of which he presses on the notice of
American engineers.
On the same date Vice-Consul Griffitt, of Smyrna, contributes a report, in which he relates the
results of his own experiments and experiences in his struggles with silkworm disease in Asia Minor.
The loss sustained by Turkey, he says, since 1857, is incalculable. I remember the time when the wife
of every gardener in the vicinity of Smyrna obtained from her crop of cocoons a sufficient return to
enable her to pay for the clothing of her family for the entire year. This fatal disease (pebrine) swept
away our beautiful indigenous races, and this branch of industry was almost abandoned. Mr. Griffitt
then refers to the mediocrity of the Japanese silkworms, which were subsequently introduced to fill the
gap, and informs us that “it requires 250 fresh cocoons of the indigenous race to weigh 1 lb., but 500
of the Japanese, and the quality of the silk is much inferior. I obtained, some years ago, a quantity
of indigenous graine of a very fine race, but very much diseased. I raised the worms from the moment
of hatching in separate cells, in order that the diseased ones might not infect the healthy, and from the
few healthy ones I obtained my present race. From 1 ounce of thirty graiues I obtain invariably from


150 to 155 of fresh cocoons, twelve of which yield over 1 lb. of silk of the best and finest quality.
Another great advantage of this improved race is that it yields only from 4 to 6 per cent, of double
cocoons, while other races have from 15 to 30 per cent.”
After paying a high compliment to M. Pasteur, whose system of egg examination he follows,
Mr. Griffitt describes the process of microscopic inspection and the silk-rearing industry generally,
concluding by assuring his readers that, by hatching silkworms from healthy eggs, and feeding under
proper precautions, a good crop of cocoons must be obtained. Upon the particulars of this department
of the subject it may be unnecessary to dwell, as it is understood that a manual for sericulturists will
soon be published by that gentleman.
Journal, Society of Arts, London, 7th September, 1883, p. 933.
Turkish Silk Farming.
A late number of the British Trade Journal contains an article entitled 1 ‘ A Glance at a Turkish
Industry,” from which the following particulars are extracted :—Mr. Griffitt has for many years
been more or less engaged in the double task of combating the various diseases to which the silkworm
is liable, and in trying to teach the peasantry how to regain something of the remunerative silk
harvests which preceded the unfortunate year 1837. The loss suffered by Turkey when the various
silkworm maladies spread so violently is, he says, incalculable. He remembers the time when the
wife of every gardener in the vicinity of Smyrna obtained from her crop of cocoons a sufficient return
to enable her to pay for the clothing of her family for the whole year. In those days there were in
the neighbourhood of Smyrna three large steam silk reeling factories, where hundreds of women were
employed ; but when disease became general this industry had to be abandoned from lack of cocoons.
Flacherie and pebrine swept away the valuable indigenous races, large areas of mulberry trees were
uprooted as being no longer required, and silk-farming came to be almost entirely relinquished. It is
true that attempts were made to stem the tide of misfortune by the introduction of foreign eggs; but
the peasantry, accustomed to handle their own large and beautiful cocoons, numbering 250 to the pound
weight, became disheartened when they had to deal with the far inferior Japanese product of only
half the size and weight. About this juncture Mr. Griffitt obtained possession of a quantity of native
graine representing a peculiarly fine race of silkworms, but which were very much diseased. Being
aware from experience, that no batch of eggs is ever entirely contaminated by disease, and being a
firm believer in the system of regeneration by isolation introduced some time before by the French
physicist, M. Pasteur, Mr. Griffitt carried it into practice, hatching his worms in separate cells and
jealously following with the microscope every subsequent stage of their development. With an
expenditure of infinite patience and trouble, he at length succeeded in rearing his present entirely
healthy and vigorous brood, the eggs from which yield about 150 of cocoons for every ounce hatched;
12 lb. of the cocoons, as taken fresh from the brushes, yielding 1 lb. of silk of the finest quality.
Having thus accomplished his first and principal self-imposed task, Mr. Griffitt set himself with equal
ardour and determination to grapple with the second. It was not enough to be able to show the
peasantry of Bournabat, near Smyrna, where his chief magnaneries are situated, of Nympio, and of
the island of Mytelene, that he had mastered the dreaded pebrine and flacherie; but determined to
leave no opening for misunderstanding or carelessness, he went among the people personally with
supplies of healthy eggs. In this manner he taught the farmers and peasantry the precautions they
should observe and secured their self-interested co-operation by making them partners in the season’s
venture. Even then he was constantly baffled to some extent by the appearance of diseased moths
bred from absolutely healthy graine, the result of infection caught from diseased worms still in the
neighbourhood. Frustrated for the moment only, he still persevered, and now, after years of unre-
mitting struggles with the enemy, he has restored to that district of Turkey some of the prosperity in
silk-raising which it enjoyed thirty years ago. During the past season, Mr. Griffitt has scarcely lost
a single worm through disease, and his peasant friends have been almost equally fortunate, though
others in the same localities using French eggs, but without the advantage of a paternal director,
have again lost heavily through the ravages of pebrine. Accordingly, the most convincing proof that
could be offered of the happy effects of Mr. Griffitt’s labours among the Turkish peasantry in the
place alluded to appears in the following specimen cases of this year. A few instances out of many
where educations of silkworms on the Pasteur cellular system have been attained without loss from
eggs previously passed under the microscope ; Elleni raised 21/4 lb. of cocoons, which sold at Is. 2d.
per lb., £l4 Bs. 9d. ; she expended for mulberry leaves and a girl’s help, £2 75., leaving a net profit of
£l2 Is. 9d. This peasant woman attended to the worms without aid during the first three ages, and
was assisted by a girl throughout the last two. Adriana s crop consisted of 151 lb. of cocoons, from
which she reeled 15 lb. of raw silk, selling the same at 15s. per lb., £ll 55., the cost of reeling, &c.,
was £1 25., leaving a net profit of £lO 3s. Possessing her own mulberry bushes, and having two young
daughters, who assisted her during the last age, her outlay was small. Dhepinon and Costoula had
a crop of 418 of cocoons, which produced 44 of raw silk, and sold at 15s. per lb., £33. The cost of
reeling, &c., was £3 55., leaving a net profit of £29 15s. These two sisters were also the owners of a
small mulberry garden, and w T ere assisted during the last age by two daughters and a son. Here, as
Mr. Griffitt points out, “are poor Turkish peasant women who have acquired by” a few days labour
what would have taken their husbands three months to earn.

From Encyclopedia Britannica, Vol. 9, page 520, edition 1876. (G. Saintsbnry, writer.)
Produce of Eearings of Silkworms in France.
Cocoons.—A century of average annual quantities and values during the periods named.
* These 9,871,116 kilos of cocoons are said to have given 636,800 kilos (= 12,547 cwt. English)
of raw silk, or a yield in that year in France from French growth of 1 lb. raw silk to 15| lb. of cocoons.
This home production = 21,716,000 lb. English, was good to the French agriculturist, farmer, or
rearer, at the then (1872) price, 2s. 4d., for £2,530,000.
This native agricultural product, together with foreign grown imported, was substantially the
foundation of the great silk manufacturing industry for which France has been and is so famous—
it has added greatly to the well-doing of an immense number of artizans and other labourers, and to
employment of capital. A chief portion of both native and imported material was used at Lyons,
where it was woven by 120,000 looms belonging to about 400 firms, who gave employment to nearly
800,000 workers, who every year produce silk goods to a value of about 460,000,000 francs (four
hundred and sixty millions of francs), say about £18,400,000 sterling.
An important portion of this was taken by demands for export, much to the relief and support
of the home market and ease to manufacturers by the high values affected by foreigners.

Mulhall. —Dictionary of Statistics. Edition 1892, page 538.
The Balance-sheet (France) of the silk industry since 1830 was approximately as follows :
In the 18th century, Lyons counted 15,000 silk factories, but the industry suffered so much
during the Revolution that in 1800 there were only 3,500 left. It revived in later years, Lyons con-
suming one-sixth of the silk crop of the world, or 50,000 tons of cocoons, one-half of which was imported
from Italy until the recent rupture of commercial relations. In 1840 the silk factories had 1,790 steam
engines of 36,000 aggregate horse-power. In 1866 France had 1,172 mills, with 110,000 operatives,
1,080,000 spindles, and 50,000 power looms, turning out silks to the value of £29,000,000 sterling.
Memo. : —The decline of the millions in the seventies and eighties was because of the competi-
tion which after 1873 sprung up in Russia, Germany, and other countries formerly supplied from
France.
Annual world production of cocoons estimated at 303,000 tons.
France.
About the year 1620 the mulberry tree was first cultivated for the rearing of silkworms.
In 1780 the cocoons weighed 6,600 tons, valued at £660,000 sterling. The farmers have recently
been cutting down the mulberry trees for fuel. In 1820 the number of mulberry trees was 9,632,000 ;
in 1835 the number of mulberry trees was 14,880,000 ; in 1884 the number of mulberry trees was
6,100,000.

The price of cocoons was Is. per lb. in the 18th century, and rose to 2s. about 1850. A few
years later a disease carried off two-thirds of the silkworms, which were badly housed and overcrowded,
causing the cocoons to rise to 45., but the price fell owing to large importations, and is now hardly
remunerative.
In 1884 the total yield of cocoons sold for £1,500,000, and was divided among 141,400 cultivators,
giving a little of £lO each.

Italy. — Mulhall, Dictionary of Statistics. Edition, 1892.
There are factories for throwing silk at Milan, and Turin, and some of the fibre is consumed at home
tor velvets and damasks, but the greatest part is usually exported to France for the Lyons factories,
ine production and export of silk approximated yearly as follows :
The consumption of silk manufacturers was as follows :
The value of the silk industry to Italy may be summed up thus, in £1 sterling millions ;
In 1878, Italy had 230 silk factories with 2,100,000 spindles giving employment to 16,000 men,
there were also 120,000 women, and 76,000 children engaged in attending to the silkworms.
In 1840, the Kingdom of Sardinia had several silk factories with an aggregate of 14,900
operatives. The cocoon crop of Italy for the years 1881-88 averaged 86 million pounds.

The produce of cocoons in 1880 was 41,500,000 kilos ; in 1888, 44,000,000; and in 1889, 34,000,000 ;
and was just superior to the poor yields of 1882 and 1885.
Page 17. —The average value of cocoons, 1879-1883, was 151,000,000 lb. = £6,040,000.
Page 24.—Whilst Italy holds a commanding place in Europe for the production of cocoons and
raw silk, the same cannot be said of its position as a manufacturer of silk goods.
In 1888, the breeding of silkworms was carried on in 5,195 communes by 559,155 breeders, w T ho
each placed for incubation an average of 2 - 39 ounces of seed (27 grammes to the ounce.)
They obtained 43,899,443 kilos of cocoons, equal to 96,578,774 lb. English, a figure never reached
since 1875. The raw silk obtained in that year was equivalent to 3,566,000 kilos, equal to 7,853,200 lb.
English, a figure never attained since 1862. The export of silk goods from Italy exceeded in 1888 the
import by 93,200,000 lb., equal to £384,000, and in 1889 by 96,000,000 lb. equal to £400,000.
The persons employed in the silk factories number 150,000, nine-tenths of whom are women and
girls. Note.— The yield in 1888, 96,578,774 lb., about 43,115 ton, at the average of the period, net

indispensable mulberry leaf. In this good year, 1888, about 11 lb. cocoons gave 1 lb. raw silk, the
best yield since 1875.

Silk. —This is the most valuable of Italian products, the annual exportation of silk averaging
£10,000,000 sterling. Lombardy is the chief seat of this industry, the silk grown being almost wholly
96 per cent, of Japanese seed. The eggs or seed are imported from Japan on cards, at a cost of
£12,000 sterling per ton (say 7s. per oz.), the average importation being from 70 to 80 tons per annum.
The eggs were formerly more prolific (gave more silk in cocoon, but not more eggs for succession)
and yielded 50 lb. of cocoons per oz., but at present an oz. of eggs gives only 35 lb., worth about 505.,
or seven times the cost of the eggs (?) (about 17d. per lb. green cocoons).
The single province of Lombardy raises an annual crop of 11,000 tons cocoons, worth £2OO per
ton (£2,200,000). For a period of thirteen years, down to 1878, the silk trade of Italy may be summed
up thus ;
Paid for Japanese eggs £13,200,000
Exported Raw silk (for the whole thirteen years) 127,600,000
Profit £114,400,000
the production at present averages 50 per cent, more than it did ten years ago.

France and the Silkworm Disease,
This table shows what happened during “ the disease” up to the beginning of partial recovery, about
1872, from the panic caused by it, and progress towards again obtaining supplies for manufacture, the
recovery being largely due to the investigations of M. Pasteur during 1865 to 1870.
I will take the opportunity of inviting attention to the essential difference between the French
and Australian ideas of dealing with, or “ combating the disease,” and also to the peculiarity, or what
seems something more than peculiarity, in the language of Monsieur Pasteur, and also, strangely
enough, of Professor Tyndall. M. Pasteur styles his invaluable book “ Etudes sur laMaladie des vers k
soie,” while his whole work and descriptions show that his investigations comprised several distinctly
different diseases, or as he terms them, developments, of each one of which, that remarkable and
accomplished scientist found a material difference, attributable, he pronounced, whether it existed in


the form known as pcbrine, muscadine, glacherie, or any other, to one and the same spore or
corpuscle, the effect of which is contagious or not contagious, or hereditary or not hereditary,
&c., or otherwise, as the accident of other circumstances in the physical condition of the indi-
vidual subject might cause it to develop or naturally evolve. Professor Tyndall uses the term
“ IMbrine” for the whole, much as anyone might use the word “fever,” for any sort of fever. So it
will be found that M. Pasteur’s remedy or “cure” (which both employ) to “combat the disease”
resolves itself into first), —a very careful selection from apparently healthy worms, moths, and eggs,
and a most careful examination and search by aid of the microscope in each and every one, for germ
or sign of disease in it. This rigorous and most laborious method of obtaining healthy graine, which
may be most properly termed the destruction of all infected subjects that can be discovered, as well
as a quarantining of the rest, was attended by excellent results. French rearers, as well as those of
other countries, took fresh heart and accomplished a great deal more, than, but a short time before,
was thought possible. It is objected that if the French process, admirable as it unquestionably is,
or its salutary effects undeniable, has not “cured,” nor has it yet saved a single pure race from
absolute destruction. It is true that some excellent breeds do now exist, but almost all, if not quite
every one of the fine old races are nowhere to be found. In Europe the expensive scrutiny and the
quarantining are still necessary, but this is not the case in Australia. M. Pasteur began his labours
on Bth June, 1865, and from the beginning his method was to find by extremely rigorous selection, if
possible, original healthy sources or parents reproducing healthy eggs. In the same month Cornalia,
a no less famous expert, said to him, “Your efforts will be in vain, your selected eggs will produce
healthy worms, but these worms will become sickly through the influence of the epidemic demon
which reigns everywhere.” I would here most respectfully invite reference to my remarks and
extracts from the United States authorities in my report, dated 29th March, 1889, to the Honorable
The Minister for Mines, and also to what I have stated elsewhere in my report to which this is an
appendix.
The disease made its appearance in France in 1849. It became fully developed in 1850, 1851,
and 1852, and it spread devastation also in every other silkworm-growing country.
The French Minister for Agriculture agreed to pay F. 500,000 or £20,000, English, for an efficient
remedy.
The well known Dumas, about 1865, proposed a committee of investigation. M. Pasteur was
appointed to make inquiry and was allowed unlimited means, and authority to use any resources of the
state or assistance he might require in following up his investigations.
A perusal of the tables will show the condition of this important industry before the disease,
during that malady, while M. Pasteur was studying it, and subsequently.
In contrast with the French method I beg to invite attention to what was being carried out in
Australia. Mr. Brady in 1862 began to look seriously into the matter and make preparation by
importing mulberry trees, and many varieties of silkworms, no good kind having been previously
known in the Colony (see his Petition to Legislative Assembly of New South Wales, 18 May, 1876) and
set to work in 1863 with already diseased silkworms he had imported. So very much diseased, in
fact, that frequently in whole lots of eggs of not less than an ounce of eggs, which really did hatch
nearly 40,000 worms, he seldom got more than a few or less than ten cocoons in any lot, and frequently
not even one cocoon to produce a moth 5 and this is what he had to start with. His object was to
cure and save. Some results or progress in improvement was seen by a number of gentlemen who
watched with great interest the strange doings and experiments of Mr. Brady, in his efforts to master
the difficult problem, till in 1869 or 1870, after seven or eight years of persistent effort, he was able to
show results so satisfactory as to challenge admiration, that so much had been accomplished in the
Colony from such a beginning, and with none but private resources.
Notwithstanding the great success achieved by M. Pasteur and his followers, from what I can
gather every pure race of silkworms seems to have died out. The chief bulk of cocoons produced in
France’ and in Italy, was from foreign eggs imported. Here, in New South Wales, though I believe
Mr Brady failed to save all lie endeavoured to save, a considerable number of tbe identical races lost
in Europe were restored to their original health and vigour, and were available had there been any
encouragement to use them.
From the very first of his experience he appears to have recognised the probability, or rather
regarded it as a certainty, and dealt with it accordingly, that the disease, whatever it was, was communi-
cable not only by contact but by floating spores or germs, whether by falling within the rearing place on
the worms themselves, or on their food, or very possibly floating in the open air, and settling on the
mulberry leaf, while growing on the tree. His theory, as he explained it, “ the curative agency, was
in any case attributable to an atmosphere in many places where there is a, perceptible presence m the
air of essential odours, peculiar to the eucalyptus, but yet more to the fumigation of the living silk-
worms in all stages, particularly while feeding, by means of a dense smoke by burning in the apait-
ment fresh branches of eucalyptus in full growth, with all possible leaf.
This use of eucalyptus, together with the best food grown on virgin soil, our splendid climate,,
with extreme cleanliness and personal attention, Mr. Brady regards as the causes of his success.


, , . 1 1 ™ ders , tand 11 Y as t° isolate alike plantations of different kinds of mulberry, and the nurseries
for his different races of silkworms, sufficiently apart, that Mr. Brady selected the 1,300 acres at the
1 weed (1 have referred to before in my report), which was set apart for sericulture, and which he
states he was led to believe would be granted to him ; but as this has not been done, it has, it appears,
determined Mr. Brady to abandon his enterprise in this Colony.
The effect of the silkworm (or rather the special) disease which began in France 1849-1850 and
the chance it offered to Australia may be easily understood by the'following table

By way of illustration, it might be imagined, in view of these figures what would be the condition
of capital labour, and of trade, the probable state of all the Australian colonies if the ordinary yield
of wool, their one great staple, should suddenly be reduced by disease in the sheep or by any other
unforseen and unavoidable calamity to a one-twentieth, or a one-twenty-fifth, or even less of the usual
crop say from an aggregate value of about £20,449,351 (in 1890, quantity of wool in grease, Coghlan’s

worth only or even less, for all Australia; then even the lowest or the humblest intelligence could
hardly fail to feel and know by practical experience what such facts, as given above, really mean.
The extraordinary calamity in regard to silk which fell upon the silk producing countries was
le opportunity which Mr. Brady affirmed in his petition, 1876, he endeavoured to seize for some years
previous to that period not only for the benefit of the Colony but of Europe, and to this he seems to
have devoted and applied his mind and his resources, his life, his skill, experience, and enterprise
{vide Mr Brady s letter to the Colonial Secretary, 17th March, 1870, page Iff Parliamentary piper,
18/0 ; also a letter in same papers from Dr. George Bennett, dated 7th June, 1870, copies of which I
have appended to my report.) ’ 1
As Mr. Brady was thoroughly well acquainted with the gradual ruin caused by the spread of the
diseases in Europe from his private correspondence, he became convinced that a splendid opportunity
presented itself to create a silkworm graine production in Australia” in fact, to take up from Europe
and improve and perfect in Australia the growth of the remarkable substance which furnishes the real
foundation of great manufacturing industries, employing vast populations in many of the most
prosperous cities of Europe. J
This peculiar substance by its simple growth from mulberry leaves had already yielded at first
hand to agriculture, not less, in the aggregate than £30,000,000 (thirty millions sterling).
The great gain to agriculture in Europe by the growth of cocoons, and the entire failure of
home supplies of the necessary “graine,” or seed, or eggs, gave rise to an extraordinary trade in foreign
silkworms eggs which sprang up, a direct consequence of the disease. Nothing in ordinary commerce
is so surprising as the enormous sum in value made up of the minute silkworm egg. Even in bulk this
apparently insignificant article acquired wonderful proportions, for the demand became enormous.

APPENDIX No. 9.
Extract from the Sydney Mail, 23 July, 1870.
Dr. Bexnett has obliged us with a letter written to him in his capacity of President of The
Acclimatization Society, by Mr. Brady, from which we make a few extracts. Mr. Brady gives an
account of his twelve months transactions at Curl Curl, where he is nursing what he supposes to be the
germ from which the silk industry of New South Wales is to spring. He says “ I have now closed up
active operations for the season with all living silkworms (except the moths, a few of which remain), and
as you desire to know the result, as far as concerns the importations of the Acclimatization Society, I
have the pleasure of confirming my first report, and informing you that the mulberry worms from
India continued to the last to do well. Of course the yield of silk is much inferior in quantity to
that from the principal European races, but the quality and lustre are excellent. For my own part, I
think the out-turn of these small yielding worms, double, treble, or many brooded in the season-taking
into account the cost of labour, food, and management, &c., as well as the safety of a profitable result
if worked in a proper manner—bears a very favourable comparison with the out-turn from the more
valuable but much more difficult to rear and precarious—lived single-brooded worms (annuals) of
Europe or Japan. In the first case, operations continue for months at anytime—spring, summer, or
autumn, or for as long, or for as short a time as mulberry leaf is available ; in the latter only fora
few weeks in spring, subject to all the vicissitudes and chances of the most uncertain period of the
year, unless indeed the grower adopts my system of bringing the annuals into period by cold and
moisture as well as warmth whenever they are wanted. If there was any attention given to this subject
in the Colony or it could be made worth while, I could easily manage to supply not eggs unhatched or
uncertain, but young living silkworms, of fine kinds, which other persons growing or possessing the
food could at any time procure from me, and rear through the rest of their natural course, and thus
avoiding expensive preparations, requiring a good deal of skill and management, reap a certain profit
from a very small oiitlay.”
Private letters contain information relative to the reception of a packet of silkworm eggs, by
the highest silk authorities in Europe, from Mr. Brady’s stock, raised at Manly. In Italy they° were
received with great favour, “ They were everywhere pronounced to be splendid fertile eggs, which is
a point of great importance in France and Italy, as their own native races are so diseased as to be
useless for mercantile purposes,” says one correspondent. Cocoons of the same race (Milanese) possessed
by Mr, Brady, pleased them exceedingly, and the writer informs his correspondent that “ eggs of that
species -would find a good market in France and Italy.” One of the best authorities in France on silk-
worms pronounced the samples in fine condition, and greatly admired the system in transporting them.
Other distinguished and practical men expressed the same opinion, and stated that “ You may at once
calculate on my being able to place for you a large amount of eggs.” Another letter says :—“ The eggs
were found in excellent order—not a single egg was hatched, and not one was crushed.” This, then,
is the information we get concerning Australian “graine” (the technical term by which eggs are now
known). Mr. Brady’s observations on these facts, in the letter alluded to, is this:—“The result of
the first shipment also bears out what I have so often told you and others of the practicability of
supplying from here the markets of Europe with better and more reliable graine than can be obtained
in any other part of the world.”
It thus appears that Mr. Brady’s experiments have put us in possession of knowledge with
relation to our advantages over the rest of the world as silkworm egg producers, for which we have
reason to be very thankful. Our advantages are twofold. In the first place, in our climate the Italian,
French, and Japan worms have been produced without any trace of the disease which ravages them at
home ; and in the second, we are in a position to supply newer seed to the European sericulturalists
than can be done from any other part, seeing that the “graine” season here is December, January, and
February, which allows of the seed or graine arriving in the cold season, and having no tendency to
hatch before the food is ready for it. In Japan and California the graine season is the same as in
Europe, and consequently time is lost, and the seed is comparatively old when hatched.
Something should be done in this matter. We can produce cocoons with the assurance of
obtaining an active market for them, which never has been the case before ; and should Mr. Brady’s
expectations be confirmed, the climate of New South Wales will enable several crops to be produced in
the year. And then, further, for the more skilful we have accorded to us, apparently by geographical
position, the specialty of producing eggs for exportation of great superiority.
APPENDIX No. 10.
REELING.
Referring to the questions as to whether it would be preferable to sell cocoons while fresh, or dried,
or to reel the silk, I took an opportunity to obtain Mr. Brady’s opinion, as I know he is opposed to
the rearing and reeling to be done by the same person.
He said that “as you know something about reeling, you are aware that the word is not
synonymous nor equivalent to ‘ winding off,’ and that the silk of every cocoon tapers finer and finer
continuously from the first trailled out by the caterpillar, even then doable though the twins unite


immediately before the liquid stuff has time to set or harden, becomes one fibre. This first trailled out
silk is best and strongest, and the tapering continues until the fibre at last becomes so small aud weak
as to be practically of little or no use. You also already know that in reeling a number (varying from
four to five and more up to fifteen or twenty and upwards, according to size and so on in requisition by
tra.de or manufacture) are brought together in such a way that the thicker and stronger portions of
individual fibres shall not be all at one part of the united threads,,but the bulk so managed that as the
machine turns and uses up the stouter and proceeds with the continuously lessening, the attendant
adds, at the right moment, fresh ends as necessary to maintain the best possible even-sized uniform
thread or ‘ single ’ without discoverable burrs or joints, breaks, or inequalities anywhere, all along.”
“ I think I sometime told you that the silk itself of cocoons varies in size and in length in
different races and breeds, and in other qualities besides, and consequently in taper, from 200 to 300
yards to fully an English mile (in the best, formally grown) without a flaw or break, or more or less
serious weakness in parts caused by irregular feeding or by change of food leaf. The qualities, lustre,
strength, elasticity, and so on, are due principally to breed and proper feeding, regular nourishment’
with suitable food, in wholesome condition.”
“Now,
the fibres of any number of cocoons, they should be joined, connected together, at the first wetting or
softening of the gum or glue which exists naturally, more or less, on each fibre. On attempting a
second wetting, before making a ‘ single,’ joining is imperfect and faulty. Secondly, I believe it is not
generally known or suspected, the straighter and more evenly (with as little twist as possible), the
individual fibres are laid alongside and together, the brighter the lustre of each one aud more brilliant
the united sheen of the whole.
“ Among many delicate machines devised by knowing fellows, experts, for use in their several
functions or offices, co-ordinating towards production of a perfected article, silk, in whatever form it
may eventually arrive at, for trade, manufacture, or whatever the requirement may be, there is a
machine, the invention of a clever Frenchman, I believe, modestly but very appropriately called a
‘ Serrell.’ A few words what this elegant contrivance is, will at once explain and illustrate what I
have endeavoured to present to your minds eye. Not to go into details, the Serrell consists essentially
of two small drums placed at a moderate distance apart but held together firmly, moved simultaneously
and equally by the same movement that puts both in action. The silk is first wound with care
round one drum, and then taking up the slack not too tightly, an equal number of turns round the
other drum. I must tell you the second drum is a little larger than the other, so as the machine
moves the larger drum exercises a strain as it winds off'from the smaller. This tests the elasticity,
and does something more, it records. To complete—-an essential portion of the machine, which is
automatic, you must imagine a delicate, free swinging pendulum suspended over the silk, with a fine
point reaching to a drum, over which a tape travels—this fine point swayed hither or thither, one
way or other, according as the inequalities of the thread in touch with the pendulum causes it to make
corresponding irregular marks on the tape. The result seen is a revelation, so enlarged as to make
plainly visible every fault or irregularity, and when, if a break occurs, the machine stops of its own
accord, and the why, or what, the flaw or weakness, was exposed to view. The Serrell is one of many
methods of scrutiny and precision practically employed to test, determine, and classify the sizes,
qualities, &c., of raw silks used in the manufacture of endless varieties of fabrics. ”
“Even granted that a competent ‘reeler’ (and there are many such) may realise something
more than the value of the fresh cocoon, where a coarse material of unknown and uncertain quality
or where nothing better is known, may find a market, or some use for it when reeled by the grower.
It is however self evident this profit cannot be but on a very limited scale. Surely to others than already
competent reelers who probably have spent years in learning and practice in acquiring this expertness,
our Australian plan for raising continuous crops of cocoons should be more attractive, as it certainly
would be more profitable to inexperts, than abortive efforts at ‘ reeling.’ My intercourse with people
has not yet introduced me to acquaintance with one single individual would-be reeler who knew
what raw silk is.”
“The first thing to be done is to grow the food—there are millions of acresof land here as admirable
as any that can be found in the world for plantations of mulberry—then to rear the silkworms, produce
and sell the cocoons. We know, by long neglected experience, for certain there is no better, perhaps
not so good a climate for both food and worms anywhere. Afterwards, will be time enough to talk
about ‘reeling.’ Do not encourage people to toy with living creatures—all too often do grown
people permit, even encourage, what is most frequently cruel pastime. Let it be money-making
business not play—keeping silkworms.”

Yield of Cocoons in Italy.
The yield of cocoons in Italy in 1871, is considered to be superior in quantity, as it was in quality,
to that of the previous year. The greater portion was formed of the imported eggs of the Japanese
breeds, both green and white, the green sorts predominating. The total quantity of silkworms’ eggs
imported into Italy for the season, deducting the exports, amounted to 92,155 kilog. (equal to 3,240,856


ounces English, about), of an estimated value of 22,117,200 Italian lire (equal to £921,500, or about
os. Bd. per oz.) This estimate, however, is helow the selling value of the eggs, which, in Lombardy
and Piedmont, is stated to have averaged 28 lire (equal to £1 3s. 4d.) per card of 28 grammes for
Japanese eggs, of good quality. The high price, if maintained, cannot but be a serious obstacle to
the further development of the silk industry of Italy, so long as the bulk of crops is based on the
Japanese eggs.
Mr. Consul Colaaghi remarks upon the discrepancies contained in the estimates of the yields of
cocoons for the whole of Italy, but attaches importance to the more positive facts obtainable with
reference to the yield of cocoons in Piedmont and Lombardy alone, which regions, with Venetia form
the most important silk-growing districts of Italy. The yield in Piedmont in 1871 was above
mediocrity, and showed signs of considerable progress over the results of previous years.
From the returns published by the Chamber of Commerce of Turin some idea of the present
condition of the silk husbandry may be obtained.
In 1871, in Piedmont, including that portion of the province of Pavia, which formed part of
the Kingdom of Sardinia, public markets for the sale of cocoons were held in thirty towns between
30 May and 11 July. The total number of market days was 712, and the number of markets held at
each town varied from eleven to thirty, according to the importance of the locality. The total
quantity of cocoons sold and weighed in these markets amounted to 602,156 myriagrammes, of a value
of 23,820,831 lire, to which must be added 211,958 myriagrammes brought to the markets, but not
publicly weighed, and sold by private contract.
The registered sale of cocoons in the public markets during the last ten years, give an average
of 329,818 myriagrammes, being 872,338 less than in the year 1871, which also surpassed the most
abundant yield of any of the series. The results have been obtained most entirely, however,
by means of importations of Japanese eggs. The persevering and intelligent attempts to*
overcome the silkworm disease and rear healthy worms in Italy, though giving fair hopes of
ultimate success, have not yet made this country independent of foreign supplies. In Lom-
bardy, the yield of cocoons in 1871, was somewhat greater than in 1870, and amounted to
1,820,000 myriagrammes. The quality was decidedly better, 14 kilog. of cocoons giving 1
kilog. of silk, whereas, in 1870, 15 kilog. were required to produce the same quantity. The
production of cocoons in Lombardy may be calculated at about one-half the entire crop of the
whole of Italy. Hopes are, however, entertained based on the more healthy condition observed to
exist in the reproductiveness of the Japanese breed that the silkworm disease is on the decrease.
During the first years of the disease, which deprived that region of nearly one-half the usual
dealers imported large quantities of Asiatic raw silk to enable them to work. The importations of raw
silk into Italy, in 1864, was about 1,000,000 kilog., the greater part of which came from French ports,
England importing direct only 13,717 kilog. As the production of silk gradually increased in Italy
there was a corresponding decrease in the imports of raw silk, which, in 1870, had fallen to 844,429
kilog., of which 12,676 kilog, were received from England. This increase of the production of Italian
silk will, in all probability, continue until the produce of the country reaches the original state. Such
at least is the hope generally entertained, and there seems no reason to doubt its fulfilment.

1 myriagramme (10,000) = 22-0485 lb., English.
1,820,000 myriagrammes x 22-0485 lb., English, = 40,128,270 lb., English, for half Italy,

At Is. 6d. per lb. about £6,000,000, probably more, as usually when the crop is large the quality
is good, hence the bigger the quantity in equal ratio or even more the selling price is bigger. Quality
in almost every commodity always fetches a superior price. Silk not being a perishable article is easily
kept in store. A high quality of silk, if put upon the market, is always seized whenever obtainable for
the best use and purposes where mere prices is quite a secondary consideration.
APPENDIX No. 12.
When cotton was introduced from India “ at the beginning of the Yuan dynasty, a.d. 1260,” it appears
to have, owing to its cheapness, usurped the place of silk, which industry had been in a flourishing
condition for more than 4,000 years. The production of silk consequently decreased until from the
date mentioned above until the present dynasty (a.d, 1644), it was nearly abandoned, only sufficient
looms being left to supply the Government requirements, and those of local consumption, which, after
what has already been said, it can easily be surmised could not have been great.
However much the narrow-minded pure native may despise western assistance, and however
much the self-sufficient Chinese, who has received a slight veneer of western civilisation, may sneer
at the advantages and blessings brought in the train of European intercourse with China, it is an
indubitable fact, but probably ignored by Chinese and little known by foreigners, that the arrival
of the latter, and their continued intercourse, created a demand for silk goods and spurred on the
E


natives to resuscitate their dying industry of silk culture, and, with “the ever-increasing demand for
silk for exportation abroad,” the industry has revived, and not only has the demand for exportation
been met, but its increased manufacture has brought more wealth to the people, and, with the foreign
silver, they themselves have been able once more to provide themselves with their own costly silks
and satins.
“Silk is now produced in every province in China, particularly in Che-kiang, Kwang-tung,
Sz-chuen, Ho-nan, Kiang-su, and Kwai-chaw. The best silk comes from the province of Che-kiang,
especially its north-west corner, though this does not equal Italian or Ceveunes silk.”
The Chinese name for silk is sz (pronounced by placing the tip of the tongue on the gum, a little
above the front teeth, and hissing s—z quickly), and our word silk, as well as the other words in the
different languages of Europe, are derived from it, through the Greek name cr-qp. The word satin is
even supposed to be derived from the Chinese word sz-tiin.
As the mulberry-leaf is the chief food of the silkworm, much labour and the"’greatest care is
expended on the cultivation of the mulberry-tree for the purpose. In the neighbourhood of Chin-
kiang there are two kinds of mulberries— a wild and a domestic—the domestic is grafted on the wild.
The young mulberry-trees are transplated in December, and are placed at regular distances of 5 or 6
feet from one another; they are then cut down to 1 foot 6 inches in height, and two shoots are allowed
to grow ; with the systematic pruning carried on each year, after five or six years there are only six-
teen branches left; the continual cutting off of all but two fresh twigs on each branch produces a knobbed
appearance of the tree ; and finally, from these knobbed-like fists, about fifty to eighty branches are
preserved. The trees live more than fifty years, but are not allowed to grow higher than sor 6 feet.
The wild mulberry, which grows to a height of 50 or 60 feet, is also used, and there smaller kind
as well.
There are ten rules laid down for breeding silkworms ; “the eggs when on paper must be kept
cool ; after having been hatched they require to be kept warm ; during their period of moulting they
must be kept hungry ; the intervals between their sleeps they must be well supplied with food ; they
should not be placed too close together, nor too far apart; during their sleeps they should be kept
dark and warm ; after they have cast their skins, cool, and allowed plenty of light ; for a little time
after moulting they should be sparsely fed ; and when they are full grown ought never to be without
food ; their eggs should be laid close together, but not heaped upon each other.” Wet, withered, or
dusty leaves are not given to them. Rather less than 2 oz. in weight of young worms will eat 1 ton
and 420 lb. weight of leaves.
Silk from wild worms of different.species is also used in some of the provinces.
“ From two catties of good cocoons nine catties of silk are reeled off. A quick hand with a double
reeling-machine, reels about catties of silk per day ; thus, 100 catties of cocoons are about six days’
work.” A certain number of cocoons are kept for breeding purposes. The female moths die in five
days after laying their eggs, which they do within a day or so of coming out.
In the Canton province, the two principal qualities of silk are Tai-tsam and Lum-yut; the eggs
of the former are hatched once or twice a year, the latter seven times.
Wild silkworms in the north of China are fed on different kinds of oak, and they supply two
crops of cocoons annually. The natives hatch them, and after feeding them themselves, place them on
the branches when the leaves of the trees are fully out, and transfer them to other trees as they eat the
leaves of one. They spin their cocoons on the trees from whence they are gathered. After the female
moths have come out and are ready to lay their eggs, the natives tie them by one leg with fine threads
to the branches of the tree, when they lay their eggs on the leaves. These wild silkworms are “smaller
than the domestic ones, and of a grayish black colour.” The silk filaments of the domestic silkworm
cocoons are wound into thread by the aid of a primitive reeling-machine.
For reeling the silk filament off the cocoons they are placed in hot water to loosen the ends of
the silk, the rough parts are cleared away, and the clean filament taken with the hand, and then
passed over or through the different parts of the reeling-machine. As soon as the cocoon gets thin and
the chrysalis is visible, a new filament is taken in its place. The best threads are made with six or
seven cocoons, ranging from this number to twenty or more for the coarsest. “ A quick hand can reel
in one day about 20 taels weight fine, or 30 taels coarse silk.” The wild worm cocoons are treated in a
different manner.
The space of our article will not allow us to go into a detailed statement of the numbers of looms
and their output, nor are statistics available for a full statement; but, as an example of what is done,
we may say that in 1880 there were in Chin-kiang 1,000 looms, employing 4,000 labourers, three men
being at one loom ; in one day three men can turn out about 12 feet to 16 feet of silk ; for plain goods,
two men only are required at each loom ; and only one man for weaving gauze, there being 200 looms
for this with 300 men at work, of which 14,000 to 15,000 pieces are annually produced for local con-
sumption within the province, that of Kiang-su. Besides this there are fifty or sixty looms engaged
in weaving silk ribbons, each attended to by one man; a second is required only in weaving the broader
kinds. On an average, one man can weave about 40 feet per day. There are about 100 men engaged
in this branch of the business, and there are about thirty or forty looms for weaving red plain satin.
For making sewing silk, “two filaments are twisted together into threads.” For crape manu-
facture there are about 200 looms and 800 men employed.
