1885-1935
FOREWORD
being the Jubilee Year of The South
VTY' ) Brisbane Gas and Light Company Limited,
it was decided to mark the event by the
issue of this small Brochure, briefly setting out the
History of the Company since its inception.
Usually a record of fifty (50) years’ progress is
interesting and instructive, but it is hoped that the
History of this, your own Undertaking, will have
a special appeal.
It is rather a happy augury that the event
coincides with the Jubilee Celebrations of twenty-five
years reign of His Majesty King George V., and it
is to be fervently hoped that the same loyal feeling
prevailing between FT is Majesty and his subjects
will ever exist between the Shareholders, the Directors
and the Staff of the Company.

AM HISTORICAL SKETCH OF THE
INCEPTION AND DEVELOPMENT
OF THE COMPANY
TILE BIRTH OF AN ENTERPRISE,
Unfortunately, no record can be traced as to where or by whom the idea of forming
a Gas Company in South Brisbane originated, due probably to the fact that some of the
important earlier records were destroyed in the 1893 Flood.
The earliest record available is of a Provisional Directors’ Meeting, held at the
Exchange, on Monday, 17th November, 1884, which was attended by Messrs. Edwards,
Hardgrave, Wilde, Adam and the Brokers. The only resolution passed was to the effect
that “ A General .Meeting of the Shareholders be held at the Mechanics’ Institute, South
Brisbane, on 25th inst., at 7.30 p.m,, to decide the course of action to be taken by the
Company.”
It Is known that The Brisbane Gas Company was, at that time, supplying Gas to the
more settled areas of both North and South Brisbane, and, as Brisbane was relatively small
then, it 1s rather difficult to imagine what prospects the originators of the proposal had in
view. At any rate, the courage of the founders can be admired, as the outlook could not
have appeared especially enticing.
FIRST ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION.
At a Meeting of Provisional Directors, held on 12th February, 1885, Messrs.
Macdonald, Patterson & Fitzgerald were appointed Solicitors to the Company, and authorised
to draw up the Articles of Association, to be submitted to a General Meeting of Shareholders
on 23rd March, 1885, for approval. Air. Francis R. Davis was appointed Secretary pro tern.,
with the temporary office of the Company in the offices of Messrs, Davis & Rees, Creek
Street.
At the Meeting on 23rd March, the Articles of Association were adopted, and, a week
later, the following gentlemen were elected from eleven candidates, as the first Directors —
Robert Porter, E. Thorne, M. Adam, P. Perkins and R, Morrison. The Directors, in turn,
appointed Mr. Robert Porter as their Chairman. Mr. Robert Forrest and Mr. E. Parr Smith
were elected the Auditors for the ensuing year at a remuneration of 10 guineas each.
Towards the end of 1885 a section of the land cm which the present Works stand,
was purchased, the remaining portion being acquired in 1891. Mr. John Davies, of Wollon-
gong, New South Wales, was" appointed the first Engineer and Manager on 16th June, 1885,
and was instructed to immediately prepare Plans and Specifications for the Works.
COMPANY REGISTERED AND FRANCHISE GRANTED.
The Company was registered at Brisbane on 30th June, 1885, the original Capital
as set out in the Memorandum and Articles of Association being £50,000. On toth
November following, an Act of Parliament granting a Franchise to The South Brisbane
Gas and Light Company Limited received Royal Assent.
It is interesting to note, in connection with the purchase of the Plant for the Works,
that the Directors, in endeavouring to arrange an overdraft with the Company’s Bankers,
were notified that this would be granted, on their undertaking to become ” Severally and
individually responsible for same.” These conditions were eventually accepted.
The first Balance Sheet was published on 31st March, 1886; the Director's’ Report,
issued therewith, contained the following statement—“ In laying before you their first
Report, the Directors have to congratulate yon on the prospects of the Company. So far




the Directors have been compelled to restrict their operations to South Brisbane, but steps
have been taken to ascertain the best and easiest method of conveying the Gas to North
Brisbane.”
ARRIVAL OF FIRST WORKS PLANT.
In May, 1886, the first shipment of Plant arrived on the Barque “ Soliile” but some
delay took place in unloading the material on account of a difference of interpretation of the
Bill of Lading. This document apparently set out that the cargo was to be unloaded at the
South Brisbane Gas Company’s Wharf, or as near thereto as possible. The Company requested
that it be unloaded at Messrs. Parbury, Lamb’s Wharf, adjacent to the Victoria Bridge.
After some negotiations, the captain, who desired to unload the cargo at The Mercantile
Wharf, some miles down the river, eventually agreed to the Company’s proposal.
About this time, Debentures, to the amount 0f£25,000, were raised in England. The
second Half-Yearly Balance Sheet was dated 30th September, 1886. The Directors’ Report
informed the Shareholders that the Works were practically completed and that the mains
were rapidly being laid in the principal thoroughfares. Also that a contract had been entered
into for the supply of 10 inch Wrought Iron Pipes to be laid across Victoria Bridge, and that
the pipes had arrived for the 14 inch main it had been decided to lay in Queen Street. Should
no unforeseen delay occur, the Directors expected to be in a position to supply Gas not later
than the first week in the coming December.
They further advised that negotiations had been entered into with The Brisbane
Company for their interests on the south side of the river, but as the terms offered were
deemed to be too high, the negotiations had fallen through.
GAS FIRST SUPPLIED.
Following the completion of the Works, Gas was first supplied to consumers in South
Brisbane on 22nd December, 1886, or just two years later than the first meeting of Share-
holders.
At an Extraordinary Meeting of the Shareholders, held 22nd March, 1887, it was
decided to increase the Capital of the Company to £IOO,OOO,
The Balance Sheet for the Half Year ending 31st March, 1887, revealed that the
Company’s first profit amounted to £77/15/10, The Directors’ Report intimated that the
laving of the main across Victoria Bridge was just about completed, but as soon as the work
was commenced the Brisbane Company instituted a system of differential rates, charging
•i/- per thousand cubic feet to consumers in South Brisbane, Queen Street, and adjoining
streets, and 7/6 per thousand cubic feet in other parts of North Brisbane, concluding with
the remark : “ Your Directors cannot but regret that such an unfair system of competition
should be resorted to,” The Report also advised that it had been decided to extend the
mains to the Valley.
The result of this competition is found reflected in the next few years’ accounts of
this Company, and, to make matters more difficult still, in September, 1888, further price
cutting occurred, whereby the price was reduced to 4/- per thousand cubic feet.
As a result of further negotiations entered into between the two Companies in regard
to limitation of areas of supply, agreement was arrived at and an Indenture was signed on
19th September, 1889, by which each Company agreed to supply Gas to consumers on their
respective sides of the river only, This agreement has worked satisfactorily ever since,
FIRST GAS STOVES.
It is interesting to note that the first Gas Stoves were purchased by the Company
from Messrs. Gallaird & Klacrr, of Melbourne, in October, 1888. They were sold for cash,
extended terms, or rented out according to the desire of the consumer,


OFFICES AND SHOWROOMS
305 Stanley St., 5th, Brisbane


At the beginning of October, 1889, the Company’s Offices were moved from Creek
Street to Hardgravc’s new buildings in Stanley Street, about where the present South
Brisbane Post Office now stands.
in the Balance Sheet issued for the Half Year ending 31st December, 1889, the nett
profit showed such a considerable increase that the Directors recommended the payment of
the first dividend.
In March, 1890, the first flood since the erection of the Works was experienced, it
was only a minor one and no great damage was caused.
1893 FLOOD.
The next event of importance was in February, 1893, when the disastrous flood
submerged the whole of the Works to a depth of over 10 feet, causing considerable damage
to the Plant, the original Gasholder being entirely destroyed. (See photograph printed
herein). Stanley Street. South Brisbane, in which the Company’s Offices were then situated,
was also flooded to a considerable depth and, as a result, many valuable Office records -were
destroyed.
in the early part of 1891 a very pronounced business depression began to be felt. It
lasted for about five years and was aggravated by the flood ; Banks temporarily suspended
payment and the Company experienced considerable difficulty in obtaining funds to pay
the interest on the Debentures held in England.
in the year 1893 some difference of opinion cropped up between the Directors and the
Auditor, Mr Forrest. As a result, the latter gentleman did not seek re-election as an Auditor,
but in February, 1895, the Shareholders elected him a Director in the place of Mr. Robert
Potter, the then Chairman. Mr. R, R, Smellie was then appointed Chairman of Directors.
The registered offices of the Company were again moved in October, 1897, on this
occasion from Hardgrave’s Building to the present site at 305 Stanley Street.
INCANDESCENT MANTLES INTRODUCED.
During 1898, the first Incandescent Gas Mantles were introduced into South Brisbane,
and, on account of the very much improved illumination obtained from their use, the Company
was successful in securing a latger contract for street lighting from the Municipality.
In the same year, Mr. R, R. Smellie, who had occupied the position of Chairman of
Directors for the preceding three years, died, and Mr. Robert Forrest was appointed
Chairman in his stead.
In 1899, the Debentures held Overseas again became due and the Directors were
successful in refloating these locally at a reduction in the interest rate from 6% to 4% and
for a currency of fifteen years.
FIRST REARRANGEMENT OF CAPITAL.
In 1902 the first rearrangement of the Company’s Share Capital took place. Up
to that date the Share Capital of £lOO,OOO was in Ordinary Shares and although they were
£1 Shares they were only called up to io/- each, leaving a liability of 10/- per share. The
£20,000 Debentures were secured by mortgage over the whole assets including the Uncalled
Capital. The Directors, with the sanction of the Debenture Holders, proposed the following
scheme which was considered and accepted by the Shareholders—“ The Company to pay
£5,000 off the Debentures and the Debenture Holders thereupon to release the Uncalled
Capital of the Company from mortgage. The Company’s Shares to be then subdivided and
the Capital of the Company to be represented by 70,000 10/- Ordinary Shares, fully paid up,
and 50,000 10/- 6% Preference Shares paid to 7/- per share. This left Bc,ooo 10/- Shares
Unissued,

GAS WORKS MARKED
CHAIRMAN OF DIRECTORS.
Mr, Robert Porter was the first Chairman of Directors, and he held that office from 1885 to 1895. Mr. K. R.
Smellie was then elected Chairman and continued in office until his death in 1898, Mr. Robert Forrest was next
appointed, and he also remained in the Chair until his death in 1923. Mr. D, B. McCullough followed, and held office
until 1924, when Mr. W. B. Darker was elected, and still holds that office.
ENGINEERS.
Ihe first Engineer oi the Company was Mr, John Davies. He was appointed in 1885, and remained in the
position until his death in 1891. The same year, his son, Mr, George A. Davies, who had previously been associated with
his father during the erection of the Works, but was then Engineer of the Townsville Gas Co,, was appointed to the
position, and remained until 1897. Mr. W. S. Moore, also of Townsville, was next appointed, and he served in this
position until 1915. Mr. F. H. Wedd, who was at that time Assistant Engineer, was elevated to the position, and
remained until 1923. Soon after, Mr. W. S. Moore was re-appointed, and he continued until his death in 1925. Mr.
W. FI. Shcdden, Engineer of Rockhampton Gas Co,, was then appointed Engineer and, some time later, Engineer and
Manager, which position he now holds.
SECRETARIES.
When the Company was first formed, Mr, Francis R. Davis was appointed Secretary, and he continued in that
position until 1895. He was followed by Mr. Frederick Nicolls, who resigned in 1913, Mr. W, B. Hill was next
appointed, and ho carried on until his death in 1927, Mr. A. Harkin was then appointed, and still holds that position.


Another small flood occurred in 1908, but, happily, no damage was caused to the Plant
on this occasion.
In July, 1910, a strike of employees of both Brisbane and South Brisbane Gas Companies
occurred. Following this, the Directors brought into operation a scheme, the purpose of
which was to try to prevent a repetition of the trouble. The employees at the Works were
presented with £lO and £5O Bonds. The former were due for payment four yeais after issue,
conditional upon the employees remaining in continuous employment during this time.
Thereaftet, similar bonds were to be issued annually, but due for payment at the end of
twelve months’ service. The/go Bond was to he paid to relatives in the case of death, but
not otherwise. Apparently the scheme was not completely successful as, in the following
year (June, 1911), a more serious strike occurred.
The next interesting occurrence was that, in 1911, the Directors decided to send the
Company’s Engineer to England and the Continent “ in order to keep in touch with the most-
up-to-date appliances for the manufacture of Gas and the most economical working of Gas
Plants and Distribution of Gas.”
GENERAL STRIKE.
In February, 1912, the lug General Strike occurred in Brisbane and, although the
Company’s employees remained loyal, it was found necessary to quarter them at the Gas
Works to prevent outside interference.
During 1912, another issue of Preference Shares was made; portion were issued at
a discount: and the remainder at a premium. The nett result was that the discounts exceeded
the premiums by/, 14,662, and, after due consideration, it was decided to write up the value
of the Plant by this amount.
About the same time, the Company erected the first installation of High Pressure
Gas Lighting in Queensland, possibly in Australia. One lamp was erected in Victoria Place
and the other in front of the South Brisbane Station. They were a source of great interest
at the time.
In the year 19T4, the Directors decided to take advantage of the favourable state
of the money market and arrange for a fresh Debenture Loan of/go, 000, out of which existing
Debentures of/,T 5,000 were paid off as also were certain other Debentures given to Mr. W. R.
Black in payment for Coal Supplies,
m
ISSUE OF /goo.ooo 5% DEBENTURE STOCK.
Towards the end of 1914 another momentous step was taken in the History of the
Company. On 27th November, two schemes were submitted to the Shareholders, the object
of which was to determine “ the best method of giving to the Shareholders the full benefits
of the extra profits which the Company will undoubtedly make.” At an Extraordinary
Meeting of the Shareholders, on the Directors’ recommendation it was decided to issue to
the Shareholders, free of cost, 5% Debenture Stock to the amount of/Too,ooo.
Early in the following year the Directors had a Valuation made of the Plant, and with
this as a basis they decided to write up the value of the Assets by/too,ooo. No record of
this proposal having been referred to the Shareholders can be traced ; the only intimation
regarding it seems to be in the Directors’ Report accompanying the Balance Sheet for the
Half Year ending 31st December, T 914, wherein the following statement occurs ; “ Seeing
that we have now practically a new Works, it was deemed advisable to have a valuation
made of the whole of the Company’s Works and Property. A copy of this valuation is
appended.” Reference to the accounts shows that the writing up had already been carded ou t.
Apparently round about 1915, some of the Shareholders commenced to voice dis-
satisfaction, and one of them intimated his intention of presenting his holding of Debenture
Stock (recently issued) for payment. Fie maintained that the Stock was payable on demand,
but the Directors took Counsel’s opinion on the matter, and this was to the effect that it was
not payable on demand.


ORIGINAL GAS WORKS DURING 1890 FLOOD


INT RODUCTJ.ON_O F QUEENSLAND GAS_ACT.
In April, 1917. the Queensland Gas Act came Into force and one of its functions was to
fix the price of gas. Accordingly, in January of the following year, a Reference was held
for the purpose of fixing the price chargeable by this Company.
The method adopted was by allowing the Cost of Production and a Return of 8.',%
on the value of the Assets. The Company endeavoured to establish the book valuation of its
Assets for this purpose, but wore unsuccessful. The Referee decided that the value of the
Plant was its cost, less depreciation, so, on the face of this, the futility of the earlier writing
up of the assets was apparent. The Company claimed £318,555, but the Referee, after
hearing Mr. J, C. Alexander, who the Company had brought from Sydney to give expert
evidence on their behalf, determined the valuation at only£l6o,0 5 1, or about half the amount.
The Return for Price Fixing purposes was therefore only allowed on this lower valuation,
whilst the Company’s Issued Share Capital and the Debentures were in the neighbourhood
of the larger amount.
Following this Reference, an investigation was made of the Company’s affairs by
Inspector Austin, of the Auditor-Generars Department.
ISSUE OF 8% DEBENTURES.
In July, 1918, the Directors arranged for a further issue of £zo,ooo 8% Debentures,
repayable in 1934. These were issued to Shareholders and their friends.
About the middle of 1919 the influenza epidemic was raging in Brisbane, and it was
only with extreme difficulty that the Undertaking was kept sufficiently manned to maintain
a continuous supply of gas.
Early in 1922 the Directors had it in mind to try and convert the Debenture Stock
into Share Capital, and to clear the way for this they recommended increasing the nominal
Capital of the Company by £200,000 to £300,000, The Shareholders passed the resolution
authorising the increase in March, 1922.
DEATH OF MR. ROBERT FORREST.
Mr. Robert Forrest, who had been a Director for 28 years and Chairman for the past
25 years, died in January, 1923, and Mr. D, B, McCullough was appointed Chairman in his
stead. The Directors appointed Mr. Atthow to fill the vacancy on the Board,
At an Extraordinary Meeting of the Shareholders on 17th May, 1923, it was
unanimously decided to increase the number of Directors to five ; the Hon. T, M. Hall and
Mr. W. B. Darker being appointed by the Directors.
CONVERSION OF 5% DEBENTURE STOCK TO PREFERENCE SHARES, ETC.
At this time it became increasingly evident that the financial position of the Company
was in a very serious state and the Board found themselves unable to recommend the pay-
ment of a dividend at the next Half Yearly Meeting. It was also realised that some
rearrangement must be made with regard to the £lOO,OOO Interminable Debenture Stock.
As a result, several propositions were submitted to the Debenture Holders, and a Report
was obtained from Mr, J. P, Macfarlanc. This Report was submitted to a Joint Meeting of
Interminable Debenture Holders and Shareholders, held on 13th June, 1924, when a
Committee, consisting of Messrs. J. P. Macfarlane, J. S, Mclnnes, A. Come, M, S. Herring,
W. B. Darker, W. E. Savage and W. S. Moore, were appointed to investigate and report,
within four weeks, on Mr. Maefariane’s Report as well as on the desirability of altering the
Articles of Association. This Committee’s Report was submitted to a Joint Meeting of Share
and Debenture Holders on 3rd October, 1924. The main points set out in this Report were
(1) The Book Valuation of the Assets should be written down by an amount of
£127,473, this to be accomplished in the following manner : The Interminable
Debenture Holders convert their Holdings into a special class of 6% Cumulative

Participating Preference Shares, The existing Preference Shares to he reduced
from io/- to 5/- and converted into Ordinary Shares (2/6). The existing
Ordinary Shares to he reduced from 10/- to 2/6,
(2) A complete new set of Articles of Association be substituted for those in force,
in which provision he made for the retirement of the whole of the Directors at
the next Annual Meeting ; the Share qualification of a Director to he increased
from £25 to£2oo and every Shareholder to have one vote for every £1 face value
of Shares held, ' ' °
The scheme, as submitted, was approved and the Directors were instructed to give effect
to it. All formalities having been complied with, the scheme came into operation on mil
June, 192'i,
F.LECTION OF NEW" DIRECTORATE.
In the interim, at the Annual Meeting of the Company on 28th November, 192,1, in
conformity with the new Articles of Association, all the Directors retired and, with the
exception of Mr. A. S. Lang, sought re-election. However, at the ballot, only one retiring
member, Mr. W. IL Darker, was re-elected, the other appointees being Messrs, W. Bulcoek,
11, J, Darragb, J. Dowrie and W. li. Savage.
At about the same time, a proposal was received from the Colonial Gas Association
for the acquisition of certain interests of the Company, but, after full consideration, this was
declined.
Immediately following the reorganisation scheme, the affairs of the Company took on
a brighter aspect, and, when the first Balance Sheet was presented, the Directors found
themselves in the position to revert to the payment of dividends to Shareholders.
just about this time it was decided to take immediate steps to ascertain whether it
would he advisable to obtain a more satisfactory site for a Works, but, as this was not found
possible, it was decided to concentrate on the present site.
NEW CARBONIZING PLANT.
Following the death of the Engineer, Mr. W. S. .Moore, in July, 1925, Mr, W. 11.
Sheddcn was appointed Engineer, and, some little time later, as Engineer and Manager.
In May, 1927, he was instructed to prepare Plans and Specifications for an entirely new
Carbonizing Plant, and in June, 1930, this Plant was first brought into operation,
With a fairly comprehensive programme of works in view, the Directors, in August,
1927, resolved to issue to the Shareholders the remaining Unissued Capital of /goo,ooo in
Ordinary Shares. This Issue was oversubscribed by the existing Shareholders,
In 1927 it was decided to establish a Debenture Redemption Fund for the purpose
of meeting the repayment of the 8% Debentures, maturing in 1934, and£2,soo was set apart
out of the year’s profits for this purpose.
OFFER FOR WYNNUM UNDERTAKING.
In April, 1929, Mr. W. R. Black, owner of the Wynnum and Manly Gas Company,
approached the Directors with the suggestion that they make an offer for the purchase of
his Undertaking, A very thorough investigation was made of the proposal and, following
this, an offer was made, but it was not accepted.
Lip to this time the Company had been supplying Gas to the district by means of the
Low Pressure method of supply, hut in the early part of 1930, on the recommendation of the
Engineer, it was decided to change over to a mote modern method, that of High Pressure
Supply. This proved so satisfactory that it was decided to adopt it for all future extensions
in new areas.


VIEW OF GAS WORKS FROM ACROSS THE RIVER


in April, 1930, an itemised valuation, of the Plant, acceptable to the Income Tax
Commissioner and the Company, was established. As a result, full depreciation was allowed
in accordance with the Taxation Commissioner’s schedule of Depreciation Rates for Gas
Companies. Subsequent Assessments were thereby able to be made on a more equitable
basis and considerable refunds of taxation were received for the preceding three years.
About the year 1928, another financial depression was making its presence felt, but,
by means of a judicious plan of extensions of mains and schemes to encourage new consumers,
the reduction in output was very greatly minimised as will be seen on reference to graph on
[rage 19 of this brochure.
CONSOLIDATION OF 2/6 SHARKS.
At an Extraordinary Meeting of the Shareholders, held on 27th August, 1930, it was
decided to consolidate the' 2/6 Ordinary Shares into 10/- Ordinary Shares on the basis of
issuing one new Share for each four 2/6 Shares then held. At the same meeting it was decided
also to increase the Capital of the Company t0£500,000 by the creation of 530,000 new Shares
of 10/- each.
Following the introduction of the Financial Emergency Act of 1931, the Directors,
in August of that year, circularised the Holders 0f£20,000 8% Debenture Stock, suggesting
that; they surrender their Stock and take up Ordinary Shares of an equal amount in lieu
thereof. Most of the Debenture Holders agreed to this and the balance of the Debentures
were redeemed on 30th June, 1933, one year before they were due for redemption.
During 1932, the effects of the financial depression began to ease somewhat and, as
a result, the Company’s Sales of Gas commenced to increase once again. This improvement
has been well maintained to date and it is anticipated that, by 1936, Sales will be greater
than they have ever been in the History of the Company.
AMENDMENTS TO GAS ACT.
Towards the end of 1953, the Government of the day passed through Parliament
a Bill amending the Gas Act of 1916 in certain important particulars, the chief of which was
the right of Gas Companies, in future, to charge Differential Rates for Gas in accordance
with the quantity consumed, in place of the earlier provision of aflat rate, irrespective of
consumption.
In December, 1933, the Coal Production Regulation Act became law. This had the
effect of increasing the price of Coal, and of determining where the Company should obtain
its supplies from.
The£4o,ooo Debentures, carrying interest at the rate of 5% per annum, fell due for
repayment on Ist July, 1934. At that date arrangements were made to extend the date
of payment to Ist July, 1939, at the reduced rate of interest of 4% per annum, £5.000 was
paid off this Debenture in November, 1934.
RETROSPECT.
This brings the History of the Company through Fifty years from its inception up
to the present time, and reveals that it has passed through varying vicissitudes. The most
pleasing fact brought to light is that the stability of the Company has never been sounder
than at present, both in regard to its financial position and the condition of the Assets of
the Undertaking. Practically the whole of the Plant is of the most modern type, and the
Works for the production of our Products will compare most favourably with any of a similar
size in this country.
Further, the outlook for the future is equally bright, and, with the gradual amelior-
ation of the conditions brought about by the financial depression, it can be confidently
anticipated that rapid strides forward will be made.

HISTORY OF THK DISCOVERY OF GAS
AND ITS DEVELOPMENT
It was in the Seventeenth Century that Gas was first discovered, but it was not until
the end ot the eighteenth Century that it was turned to practical use. John Baptist van
1 lelmont, of Brussels, discovered, about 1609, in the course of his experiments, that a fuel
delivered up what he described “ a wild spirit.” Me found that this could be produced in
various ways such as by means of combustion, fermentation and the action of acids on lime-
stones. In writing of his experiments, he said ; “ This spirit, up to the present time unknown,
not susceptible of being confined to vessels, or capable ot being produced in a visible body,
1 CALL BY THE NAME OF GAS,”
Slime years later, natural Gas was found in various places in England. Thomas
Shirley, in a communication to the Royal Philosophical Society of London, in 1667, states
that his attention had been directed, about eight years previously, to what was considered
to he a spring “ where the water did burn like oyle and did hoyle and heave like water in a
pot.” On investigation he found this to “ arise from a strong breath, as it were, a wind which
ignited on the approach of a lighted candle, and it did burn bright and vigorous.”
About the same time, Dr. John Clayton, a Yorkshire Minister, robbed the "spirit”
of some of its elusive properties and brought it more within the realm of practical things.
Between 1660 and 1670 he conducted a series of experiments. At Wigan, he found what
he described as a “ Shelly Coal,” and, upon heating this in a dosed vessel, he found that
“ a spirit which issued out, caught fire at the flame of a candle,” lie greatly amused his
friends by collecting this “ spirit ” in bladders, pricking holes in them and lighting the Gas
from a candle,
Like van i lelmont, he also failed to turn the discovery to any practical use. The
first practical application was made in 1792, when William Murdoch, a construction and
erection Engineer for James Watt, of steam engine fame, distilled coal in an iron retort and
conducted the gas through 70 feet of tinned, copper tubes, and in this way succeeded in
lighting his home at Redruth, in Cornwall. He rapidly improved his process, and, in 1798,
he built an apparatus on a large scale and satisfactorily lit up the Works of Boulton, Watt
and Co., manufacturers of steam engines. He next, in 1804, built a Gas Works and lighted
a cotton mill, of Messrs. Phillips & Lee, at Manchester, with 900 burners. Murdoch’s
achievements were along such practical lines that he is recognised as the father of the
Gas Industry.
On 18th May, 1804, Frederick Albert Winsor, a German, obtained the first English
patent for Gas manufacturing purposes. He had a vision of the future of the Gas Industry,
as he foresaw most of the present uses for Gas, claiming that it would be used for heating
as well as lighting. He was confronted with the herculean task of fighting against old-
established customs and prejudices, but he persisted in trying to popularise his patent. The
ardent manner in which he pursued his subject excited great opposition and made him the
object of ridicule. Sir Walter Scott described him as a madman, whilst Napoleaa dismissed
his plan to light London’s streets with Gas as tine grande folie.
Despite opposition and ridicule, Winsor continued his task. He succeeded in obtaining
the support of a large and influential body of Shareholders in his Company, and the first
public street lighting by Gas took place in Pall Mall, London, on 28th January, 1807. This
demonstration did much to dispel many of the doubts existing as to the possibilities of the
discovery.
In April, iBiz, a charter was granted to the London and Westminster Gas & Light
Company Limited, and thus the first Gas Company in the world came into being 123 years
ago. Great Britain can therefore claim to have given the world a commodity which, under
our present civilisation, we cannot do without.
From that, date the technique of the Industry was consistently improved and, as time
went on, its use spread to the four corners of the world.


GENEALOGICAL TREE
Showing the more important compounds existing in. and derived from COAL TAR.


For very many years Gas was used as an illuinlaant only, but in 1855 an, invention
by a German Chemist, von Bunsen, opened up a very much larger field of use. He introduced
a burner which still bears his name. The purpose"ol: this Burner was to bum a mixture of
Gas and Air, resulting in a blue non-luminous, non-sooty, flame of intense heat.
This invention opened up a vast field in which the use of Gas as a fuel became an
established success —for cooking and heating of every conceivable nature. The principle
ot this burner is still used in all manner of appliances, from those used for domestic purposes
to the huge industrial heating furnaces.
Another equally interesting invention, this time in the sphere of lighting, was made
some 30 years later by von Welsbach, a pupil of von Bunsen. Boiling some rare earths one
day in a glass vessel placed on an asbestos sheet, they accidently boiled over on the asbestos,
a brilliant incandescence resulting. From this the Incandescent Gas Mantle was developed
and another great filip given to the Industry,
With the introduction of the Incandescent Gas Mantle it was no longer necessary
to manufacture Gas with high illuminating properties, for the brilliance of the mantle depends
solely on the temperature of a non-luminous flame. This gave the Engineer greater latitude
in the manufacture of his product, and in this respect marked a very important step in the
cheapening of the cost of the manufacture of Gas.
Another invention which was responsible for the opening up of a further vast field
for Gas was that of the Gas Engine. This discovery made use of still another very important
property of Gas, that of its explosive power. This completed the great triumvirate of uses
for Gas; namely, for LIGHT, MEAT and POWER.
The Gas Engine was of very great importance to civilisation generally, as a later
development ot the principle to the petrol engine made possible the bringing into being of
the motor car and the aeroplane.
Much could he said in regard tc the many inventions and improvemcr ts in the manu-
facture and distribution of Gas, but space forbids. From a very small beginning it lias
grown into a tremendous Industry and this expansion is still being maintained in practically
every country in the world.
It has grown to he of national importance, and this was never more fully realised
than during the Great War, its by-products form the basis from which practically all High
Explosives are made, and of the 750,000 tons of High Explosives manufactured in England
tin ring the War, the majority of it was made from raw materials supplied by the Gas Industry.
in peace time it is no less important. The process of the manufacture of Gas yields
something like boo by-products, and it is interesting to note that, when Coal is burned in
most other ways, all these valuable products are lost. Amongst the most important by-
products may be mentioned, Coke, Tar, Disinfectants, Antiseptics, Analine.Dycs, Oils, Motor
Fuels, Explosives and Ammonia for Refrigeration, and Fertilisers. The Genealogical Tree,
printed on page 22 of this Brochure, clearly indicates the important part played by
tire Gas industry in the needs of the community.
Some idea of the magnitude the Industry has attained may be gauged from the fact
til at, in Great Britain alone, over 300,000 million cubic feet is consumed annually by no less
than 101 million consumers. To make this enormous quantity of Gas it is necessary to
carbonise over 20 million tons of Coal each year.
The first authority to manufacture and supply Gas in Australia was The Australian
Gas Light Company, of Sydney, New South Wales. The date on which this Company com-
menced operations was 24th May, 1841, or nearly 100 years ago. Fifteen years later, on
3rd January, 1856, the first Gas Works in Melbourne, Victoria, came into operation, and,
subsequently. Works in other States were built.
Gas was first supplied in Brisbane in November, 1865, some twenty-one years prior
to the commencement of operations of The South Brisbane Gas and Light Company Limited.
