Header,
If you are one of that important class who
love their country, and would see her people
prosperous and happy, lend me your ear I I
ask it in the name of patriotism and comradeship.
I have written this book for you ! If it
sheds any light upon the subject with which it
deals, give me your help to diffuse that light

CHAPTER I.
In considering so important a subject as the
relations existing between Land and Wealth,
one is met by the great anomalies arising from
land ownership, in its present absolute form.
Economically considered land should only
possess two elements of value, one beneficial
the other detrimental to the welfare of the
community.
T 1 re beneficial element of value is the supply
of the means which minister to life and happi-
ness and which year by year it actually
develops, for the enrichment of those who use
it wisely and industriously, and which through
them is distributed to supply the needs of the
community.
The detrimental element of value results
from neglect to use the land productively.
The laws which govern Land Tenure are
those which most largely influence the condition
and welfare of the masses of the people, and it
is only by bringing these laws into harmony
with a code of justice and equity, that we can
as a nation enjoy the kindly fruits of the earth,
and stem the growth of poverty, destitution
and vice.


Economists universally agree that the
reduction in cost of a commodity, extends the
area of its consumption, and utility, and thereby
benefits the community, and any rise in the
cost of necessary commodities restricts the area
of their consumption.
It must be admitted by all that the prosperity
of a nation is more largely dependent upon the
development, and cultivation, of the products of
the soil than upon any external conditions of
trade or commerce, because from the soil must
come the commodities which torm the basis of
its commerce with other nations, and without
these it has little to offer in exchange.
The appreciation in the value of gold is dis-
turbing the minds of our economists, while they
overlook the fact that the appreciation in the-
rmit value of land, depreciates the value ot the
industry expended upon it. This is the main
source of our present national depression.
If we study the teachings of the great men
who have sought to influence others for their
good, we may divide them into two classes ;
those who appeal to the intellect, and those
who appeal to the sympathies.
The former seek for truth in the clear
dry light of intellectual research; the latter
endeavour to pour that light into the hearts ot
men. The Economists divide themselves into
these two classes, as all great men inevitably


must. Following the dictates of their forcible
natures they lean towards the side to which
this force impels them.
Now all the great Economists agree in this,
that land is the great source of wealth, and
that the only way to draw wealth from this
inexhaustible supply is by intelligent, hearty
industry.
Therefore, whatever edifice of security, pros-
perity, and happiness, we desire to build for
society to dwell in, we must first find a solid
foundation on the land ; then clear it of those
tangles and sharp briars of unjust law, and
those rank weeds of unconditioned personal
possession, which have so rapidly sprung up and
grown so rankly in this rich and glorious land
of New South Wales.
In order that we may realize with some
clearness the immensity of these obstructions,
we have set forth upon the diagrams a com-
parative table showing the proportionate distri-
bution of freehold land, and private wealth,
amongst our made adult population.
Now all political action should have a
purpose, a method, and an object. The purpose
we doubtless all have in our hearts ! It should
be the welfare of our country and the happiness
of its people.
The method may not be so clear, but it
should be justice to all, help to those who need,


and control of those who would exceed their
equitable rights, or their acquired privileges.
The object then, should be secure possession by
every man of the fruits of his energy, his
intelligence, and his sympathies. Some men
labour mainly with their hands, some principally
with their heads, some most cordially with their
hearts. We should all strive to bring our
heads, our hands, and our hearts into perfect
co-operative union ; so that whatever our hands
find to do, we may do it with the strength of
our hearts, and the guidance of our heads
then both pleasure and success are bound to
follow in due course.
We are now chained to the car of irresponsible
and unconditioned private ownership of Nature’s
great opportunity for producing wealth, namely,
the land. The ‘ ownership ’ of this gives all
Nature’s forces into the owners’ hands, both to
enrich himself and to impoverish others.
This should no longer be allowed, because
the first necessity of life is space in which to
live. All space (i.e., land) should be subject to
those conditions which minister to the general
welfare of the whole community.
Energy, and desire for work, may be abso-
lutely Avasted for lack of opportunity. Oppor-
tunity may be prodigally thrown aAvay, for lack
of anv stimulus to utilize it.


The great stimulus to energy is the desire
for satisfaction. The great paralyzer of effort
is of wealth, which breeds slavish
greed and enervating lust, rather than a healthy
desire for progress.
Let us try to realize what the great wealth
of Nature’s bounty is, and what the share of
every man should be ! Then strive manfully
to raise all those whose lot has given them less
than an average share; and place a just
restraint upon that over-vast and too abundant
increment of wealth, which does not minister to
the national welfare nor benefit its owner.
Reform the laws which govern all land
tenure ; work step by step up to that grand
ideal of each for each, and all for all, which is the
truest meaning of economics and of socialism ;
the capabilities of each encouraged, while he
strives for self-improvement and advancement;
the bounteous opportunities of Nature freely
placed within the reach of all who use them
wisely, and for the Nation’s welfare.
Take no man’s land or wealth away if lawfully
acquired and justly used. He cannot take that
land or wealth beyond the gateway of the world
to come. Only prevent him from misusing or
abusing either. By wise and equitable laws
compel the rightful use of both.
He should no longer have the poAver to bind
with senseless trust conditions, the Avealth which


he reluctantly relinquishes, and wills that his
dead hand shall still control. Establish National
Trustees to deal with all trust dispositions, to
use them for the national advantage and best
welfare. Then the nation’s happiness and
gratitude will be a guarantee to those who
having capability and opportunity to gather in
the surplus wealth for individual benefit, and
desire to leave it to their children or successors,
need have no fear that the return on their
investments will be insecure or insufficient.
Make it a law that all the wealth that is
henceforward left in trust, shall be invested in
New South Wales Consolidated Stock, and that
these same consols shall be a charge on all
remunerative works of public usefulness.
Require all freeholders of unimproved uncul-
tivated lands to value them, to form the basis
of an equitable land tax. Make the valuation
sum the price at which the nation may resume
at any time for beneficial use.
Pay for the land resumed not cash, but New
South Wales Consolidated Stock, bearino- an
o
interest at four per cent, per annum. Only
resume the land, most equitably valued, leaving
those who value their land too highly, to pay
the tax on their own valuation. Give them an
option to re-value, by giving twelve months’
notice of their intention so to do, but always


subject to the same conditions of taxation, and
resumption of the uncultivated lands.
Re-lease the lands resumed to those who
want to cultivate them, and charge a rent of
live per cent, upon the price at which they are
resumed. Then none need want for land, and
none complain that they are harshly or unjustly
treated. For no man can reasonably complain
when his own valuation shall declare the measure
of his duty to the State, and its responsibility
to him.
Then and soon New South Wales may
prosper. No workless willing men, no wasted
fruitful lands. The people and the land when
brought together should satisfy each other and
both be benefitted beyond all calculation.


CHAPTER 11.
If all the freehold land and all the private
wealth in New South Wales were equally
divided amongst all the men, each man’s portion
for many generations yet to come might be
something like the following, viz. :
125 Acres Freehold Land, worth ... £5OO
House and Improvements ... ... 300
Live Stock and Personal Effects ... 200
Say £lOOO
And in addition to this he would be entitled to
lease 400 acres of pastoral Crown lands for £4
per annum.
Why then should there be any poor and
homeless in New South Wales ? Why any
willing workers who are workless ? Why any
honest men without a shelter for their wives
and families ? Why any outcast girls who sell
their virtue for a bare existence ?
It stands to reason that any man in Sydney
who in this year of grace (so near the dawn of
another century) asks questions such as these,


may be prepared to hear from sundry super-
intellectual beings, who constitute the ruling
classes in this happy land, that he is crazy and
should live at Gladesville, where a quiet home
is purposely provided for those whose heads are
turned the wrong way round.
It may be very generous of the State thus to
extend its care to the half-witted, but before
soliciting such hospitality on our own behalf
let us explain.
Like those travellers who chanced to come
upon the Island, “ Atlantis,” in Francis Bacon’s
beautiful romance, we have come from a far
country, and we fain w ould learn the lessons
every land can teach us. We are Catholic and
Cosmopolitan in our heart and sympathies, and
desire to pick up information wherever it be
found, taking back to our island home across
the world a true and faithful story of fruitful,
sunny, happy New South Wales.
So first, like Bacon’s travellers, we seek out
the official whose duty is to inform enquiring
strangers upon all those points concerning
which they ask enlightenment, and with
that perfectly -urbane and candid truthful-
ness, which like a halo shines around the
head of every State department, he lays
before us the very heart and mind and soul
of this enticing land. He tells us all about its


land, its wealth, its morals and its progress, the
way its children are brought up to walk in
virtue’s paths, so bright and sunny, leading-
direct to peace and happiness.
We find the Statistician’s office is no sinecure,
for every year he publishes to enlighten an
enquiring world, six or seven hundred pages of
closely printed figures, telling us everything
that numbers can express about ourselves and
others, how we are born, live, learn, and work,
and gather wealth and die, and what we leave
to those who follow us.
Now lest these figures should perplex us by
their vast incomprehensibility in the Statistical
Register, he gently takes us by the hand and
shows us how we may interpret this and learn
the lessons which the figures teach. Thus we
find a royal road to knowledge in a charmino-
** O O
work, entitled “ The Wealth and Progress of
New South Wales.”
This book is most delightful reading, for in
the quiet study, or far away from contact with
the busy toiling w T orld of living human beings,
one may almost realize what a happy democratic
land this is; where everything that ministers
to man’s enjoyment is abundant, and all his
interests are cared for by the State even from
the cradle to the crave.
O


Unfortunately for this rich and happy country
one of those curious epidemics called a ‘financial
crisis ’ has recently occurred, and like the
measles its attack was incubating many days
before the spots appeared, and then, alas, it
spread and covered all the land with consterna-
tion and dismay. All the quack financial
doctors said that it was nothing but a trifling
sickness, the result of too much wealth, a
plethora of good things, which choked the
avenues of commerce and caused a temporary
check to progress.
Tis nothing more than just a panic in a
burning theatre ! If people would show self-
control and courtesy to others, and not push
quite so hard to reach the door before their
friends all would be well, and on the morrow
the little race for wealth would once again
proceed as swiftly as before ; then we can
quickly build another theatre over the ashes of
its predecessor. How terribly insane it is that
hundreds should be sacrificed because a few lose
confidence and thus create a panic I
And then they turn for comfort and assurance
to the pages of official records, and the dictum
of the ‘ Statistician ’ as set forth in the
“Wealth and Progress,” and herein they find the
soothing sweetness of an orthodox salvation
for the chosen few.


We propose to do the same, and offer our
salvation to the many,yet not in blind acceptance
of the “ Wealth and Progress ” as though it
were the veritable gospel of the present, past
and future.
We know, alas ! that David said in haste,
“all men are liars,” and though he must have
had the leisure to unsay it, be never used such
opportunity to correct or modify his very rude
remark.
Our own investigations lead us to conclude
that—all men are liable to error. Therefore,
draw no conclusions hastily, and when you work
a sum in figures, prove it by the homely rule of
checking your remainders.
If we want to know the ‘ living 1 wealth ’ of
O
New South Wales, we ask that knowledge from
the Dead, and, though it sounds a little para-
doxical, they answer us. Not viva voce, but in
the records of the Probate Court. For, as the
wise man said, ‘ all rich men die, and after that
the lawyers.’ So the outer world learns from
these records all about the wealth the million-
aire possessed before he joined the ranks of
those who have no longer need of purse or
cheque-book.
Now, to show how this is done, we quote the
following page (638), extracted from the 1891


Edition of the Wealth and Progress of New
South Wales, by T. A. Coghlan, Government
Statistician, &c., and, as an introduction to it,
we also give page 632 :
(P. 632.) Private Wealth.
“ Private property in the Colony is estimated at the
value of £407,405,000, comprised as follows :
Land ... ... ... ... £173,352,000
£173,352,000
Houses and Permanent Improvements 129,800,000
Livestock ... ... ... 35,187,000
35,187,000
Personal Property and Furniture ... 14,637,000
Machinery and Implements ... 9,723,000
•Coin and Bullion ... ... 9,726,000
Merchandise ... ... ... 14,730,000
Shipping Owned in Colony ... 1,910,000
Mines and Plant... ... ... 18,340,000
£407,405.000
“ The gross value of the land in the Colony is
£186,576,000, but allowance must be made for the
amount owing by selectors on conditional purchases to
the amount of £13,224,000, which has been included
in public wealth ; the net value is therefore estimated
to be £173,352,000, as shown above.
“ The private wealth, as shown in the foregoing
statement, is certainly very large, but it may be
roughly verified by taking the amount of money left
by persons dying during the past five years. Thus the
total amount sworn to of property claimed under
probate and letters of administration during this period
was £26,369,571. The number of deaths during the
same period was 71,489, so that the average value of


the property left by each person dying was about
£369. It is well known that property for probate
purposes is not estimated at its full value ;; assuming
the real value is ten per cent, above the probate, the
total wealth of the Colony as estimated by this means
on the population of 1890 would be £455,500,000.
c< It is well understood that the capital value of all
unimproved lands is generally greatly understated.
“ The permanent improvements effected in the
purchased lands of the Colony, and on the holdings of
pastoral tenants, have been valued by the Inspector of
Stock at £72,982,100. The Census Act provided for
a valuation of lands and improvements, and from the
returns obtained it wotdd appear that the value of
improvements effected, as returned by the landholders,
was £44,920,400, or 61 per cent, of Mr. Bruce’s
estimate, and the figures have been accepted.
[P. 638.]
“ Though the value of estates as declared for
probate purposes may not be taken as giving an
indication of the absolute wealth of New South Wales,
the number of estates gives some indication of the
distribution of that wealth. It will be seen that
during the year 1890 stamp duties were paid in 1646
estates to the value of £6,448,785, being an average
of £3,918 for each estate. The total number of persons
who died during the year was 14,217, or at the rate of
12 - 90 to every 1,000 of the mean population.
Presuming that wealth is distributed among the
living in the same proportion as it was among those on
whose estates stamp duties were paid, in relation to
the total number of the dead, there would have been,
at the end of 1890 :


* ( 118,217 persons with estates under £5,000.
4,574 persons with estates between £5,000 and
£12,500.
2,606 persons who were worth between £12,500
and £25,000.
853 persons whose wealth was between
£25,000 and £50,000; and
1,318 who enjoyed estates valued at over
£50,000.
This would leave about 994,300 people whose effects
were, so to speak, of little or no value, consisting
mainly of personal property, chiefly furniture, which
is rarely made the subject of formal bequest. Of
these unpropertied persons the great bulk consists of
women and children. Thus the number of male
persons below 21, and, therefore, incapable of making
a bequest, was 294,900, and of women and children
-578,200, or, together, 813,100; these deducted from
the number given above, 994,300, would leave 181,100,
being the adult males who do not possess property,
■compared with 137,600* who are so fortunate. In
determining these figures the fact that not a few
women hold property has not been taken into con-
sideration, but if every allowance had been made on
This score no appreciable difference would be made in
the conclusion just arrived at.f Though the property
■of the Colony may be said to have accumulated into
the hands of about one-ninth of the population, a more
correct idea of the distribution of wealth will be gained
from the statement that of every hundred male adults,
41 have property to the value of £lOO, which, restricted
* Note.— The details of these figures cast up but 127,598 —a

as it may be deemed, is a considerably wider distri-
bution than is found in older countries.”
This page should take the prize for trans-
cendental blundering, even if the whole official
literature of Australasia were competing for
this doubtful honour, for after the fatal word
“ presuming ” in the ninth line, there are 21
sets of figures placed in bold array to support
a previous estimate of the private wealth of
New South Wales.
A previous estimate of private wealth shows
(p. 632) £407,405,000 from valuation of all
the visible forms of wealth (in which the assets
are all included and no liabilities are even
hinted at).
Mr. Coghlan then adopts one of his peculiar
methods of drawing conclusions from the probate
records, and “ presumes ” therefrom that the
private wealth “ would he £455,500,000,”
because when trustees swear that a testator’s
wealth is under such and such a sum they mean
that at the very least this wealth exceeds their
oath by 10 per cent.
His sweet simplicity and utter disregard of
arithmetical conventionalities should qualify our
statistician for the more exalted and remunera-
tive post of Under-Secretary to the Treasury,
for he who can without a blush deduce the
statement that the male adult population of
New South Wales consists of 137,600 possessing


wealth, and 181,100 wealthless ones, from such
a record of the Probate Court, and such a fanciful
array of utterly irrelevant observations, about
“mean death ratios/’ “women and children,”
4 male persons under 21 incapable of making a
bequest,’ ’and, “ effects, so to speak, of no value,”
belonging by inference to babes in arms and
CJ O «y
others, he could undoubtedly with a flourish
of his magic pen balance the national accounts
on paper, to a decimal fraction, and prove
conclusively that consols and English funds are
so largely held in New South Wales that they
more than counterbalance our indebtedness to
the United Kingdom—he could likewise prove
that large taxation is the great source of
national wealth, that free exchange of produce
and commodities is detrimental to the moral
welfare of a people, and the entire exclusion of
the skilful handiwork of other nations will
educate our rising generations for a life of
happiness, prosperity and wealth.
We will take the few essential figures from
which to make our calculation and following the
simple rules of arithmetic we will adopt three
courses and see where these will take us.
First we will place Mr. Coghlan’s figures in the
from of an equation and show how inharmonious
they are to one another. Next we will use Mr.
Coghlan’s factors and deal with them consis-
tently, and, lastly, deduce from accurate factors


an estimate of the proportion of rich and
poor in New South Wales and the amount of
private wealth.
In order to accomplish this, we take the
statement that 16 46 estates paid stamp duty in
1890, for this informs us how many of the
wealth possessing class responded to the call of
death. Next we ascertain how many male
adults died in the year 1891, and how many male
adults were actually living on the Ist of April
when the census and the ages of all the people
were taken. By this we find the ratio between
the wealthy and the wealthless. Our final step
will be to ascertain the average amount of
wealth shown by the probates of the four years
1887 to 1891.
Mr. Coghlan starts right with probates which
show that 1646 estates were left in 1890 by
persons dying. Beyond this all appears error
and confusion. He takes a death ratio of 12-90,
which should be 16*51 per 1000. But even
with 12*90 he makes an error, for he <hves
7 O
137,600 as the product, and it should be
127,598. If he uses the 12*90 death ratio to
all his male adults and multiplies by 83*60 the
factor which erroneously produces 137,600, and
also uses the same ratio to bear upon the male
adults who do not leave a record in the Probate
Court in 1891, he not only makes the private
wealth (the legitimate outcome of his curious


method) 593 millions, which is 282 millions too
high but he requires 435,300 living male adults
to fulfil his equation, and this is 108,300 more
men than the census records. This is the
phantom fabric which forms the corner stone
and foundation of the “ Wealth and Progress
of New South Wales.”

Total Private Wealth of New South Wales, as shown by records
of the Probate Court, worked out by the rules of arithmetic, and
based on statistics of the Census Year, which gives no opp jrtunity
for ‘ presumption.’
We can see from the foregoing figures that
by no possible method known to arithmetic can
Mr. Coghlan’s figures in some cases be made to


harmonize with facts. He blunders through a
tortuous course of women and children to find out
the death rate of male adults, and how many are
living ; when all the while the census returns
give him these figures exactly, and from these
figures the death ratio is ascertainable with
absolute precision.
He gives, us a method by which he establishes
an estimate of private wealth, and then tells us
that a correct idea will be gained from the
statement that 41 out of every hundred male
adults possess wealth and 59 do not, when as a
matter of fact the proportion is only 30‘5 with
wealth to 69'5 without. The sum which he
sets us works out to show that the private
wealth of the colony is £593,028,480, while the
actual figures if taken from a fair basis show
only £310,695,671, or very little more than
half of Mr. Coghlan’s estimate.
Turning back to the estimate
of visible wealth (p. 632) £407,405,000
We deduct therefrom on
account of private in-
debtedness to the United
Kingdom in one form or
another, say ... ... 100,000,000
£307,405,000


Th Is long array of calculations appeared
necessary to establish a prima facie case against
the statistician’s figures. His position is so
strong, entrenched behind the bulwarks of
O '
officialism that an attack must be well directed
and forcibly delivered in order that we may
awake the people to the truth. Let them
shake oft the slumber of contentment, based on
their fictitious wealth, and face the dire con-
clusion of their poverty. Having struck a
hundred millions oft their assets they surely
cannot sit so foolishly content beneath their
load of liabilities.
Now just a word or two about the diagram
based on an average of several years. Its
purpose is to place before the eye in one broad
field of vision the relative proportions which
the wealthy few bear to the impecunious many,
and trace the inequalities step by step from
those who dying barely leave sufficient funds to
pay their funeral expenses, up to those who
average more than a hundred thousand pounds
a-piece. Or otherwise, starting from the top
we will work the process downwards. We
have not many words to waste upon the
‘ wealth,’ that tyrant god who makes so many
slaves, and tempts so many to enlist behind his
banner. Having joined his ranks they crave
with fierce eagerness all forms of pleasure and
excitement, but rarely find in wealth the


happiness and sweet contentment which they
might find in following a nobler leader.
The little variously shaded squares between
the tables of the land and wealth give the scale
to which the diagram is drawn. Each little
space of equal size on either hand expresses the
■equivalent of wealth, of land, or men. Thus
£1,300,000 of wealth is indicated by every inch
of surface coloured red upon the larger diagram
from which this one is copied by the truthful
sun, and in this book the colour red is indicated
by perpendicular shading. In heraldry this is
the acknowledged sign for red, the royal colour.
Blue is the people’s colour and is expressed
by horizontal shading. This best displays an
attitude of helplessness beneath the arbitrary rule
of plutocratic government. The dots are meant
to show the yellow barren land, untilled by
human industry and left in its primeval
desolation of unfruitfulness. These both are
true heraldic colours, and any one who takes
the trouble to get a paint box and a brush, may
soon fill in the spaces and make the diagram a
vivid picture of the truths we want to teach.
Many of our readers may have seen the far
away ‘ back country,’ endless miles of bush and
plain that only longs for men and moisture, and
in response for these would lavish such a wealth
■of gratitude upon stout hearted and clear headed


industry as would astonish those who think our
population is beyond our means.
Try irrigation ! From the bowels of the
saturated rocks,long hidden, till man’s knowledge
of his mother earth’s anatomy gave promise of
those priceless fountains whence to cool and
fertilize these thirsty lands.
Every acre bathed by such perennial springs
of gushing water, and stimulated by the
quickening rays of constant sunshine, is worth
a hundred, aye a thousand acres left uncared
for. For, as if to spite man for his wanton
disregard and ignorance, the pining, wasted
sheep and cattle die in thousands, aye in
millions during times of drought, when all the
while beneath the surface lies the means of then
salvation waiting for man to draw it forth, and
use it to his benefit.
Now, if the weary waste of spotted yellow
land were traversed by the lines of men, and
means, see how its face would change, the
undefined waste is broken into little squares,
each one of which will make a hundred farms,
and keep a hundred families in comfort and
sufficiency. And by the blending of the blue and
yellow T , lo ! the green, emblem of fertility, springs
to our view, and we are lost in wonder w'hence
it comes. Yes, Nature’s laws are like a magic
' O
wand to him who understands them, and can


execute her kind commands with patient and
unswerving industry.
The little spots diagonally shaded show all
that has yet been done to cultivate this glorious
land
Look at the huge unbroken area of the upper
space that represents the freehold land ; here
more than 20,000,000 acres are owned by
less men than there are minutes in a work-
ing winter’s day, and if one minute repre-
sents the area they cultivate, then the whole
remaining period from dawn to sunset just
represents the area they leave untouched.
And this is freehold tenure in New South
Wales ! They do not hold the land at all,
they simply fence it round with steel barbed
wire, then turn their backs upon it and
hate it for its barrenness, which man alone can
cure ; Nature without his aid is powerless.
The contrast may be seen in each succeeding
block, for as the holdings lessen so does the area
that feels the kindly hand of man in husbandry
increase, until at last we come to those who
only own ten acres each. These love their
land, and it requites their love with fruitfulness.
One in three they cultivate. Would that there
were twenty times as many thus employed,
instead of pacing Sydney’s weary streets in
search of work or bread, and finding none but
from the niggard hand of charity.


Would to God we say that these poor men»
who sleep beneath the starry sky at night (with
all its far-off splendour and magnificence),
homeless and shelterless, might find some friend
as champion of their long lost right to labour
on the land that gave them birth, and live upon,
its fruits.


CHAPTER 111.
Having touched generally on this vast and
important subject, and especially devoted our
•efforts to establishing the unfortunate truth
that we are not so rich as would appear by offi-
cial statements, we now propose to deal more
in detail with the distribution of that wealth
which, by its exaggeration, has dazzled the
many with its glittering show, and has blinded
the few to the real condition and needs of the
country.
It may come as a shock to our self-com-
placency, and as a revelation to those in the
outer world who take an interest in our welfare,
to find that our national accountants and
auditors are either careless or callous in their
manipulation of figures. But surely this is
better than that we should any longer dwell in
that domain of fictitious prosperity generally
known as the “ Fool’s Paradise.”
In order that the diagram should not lose in
force by any minuteness of detail, we have
divided the total male adult population into six
broad classes. Those who possess wealth in
any amount which brings them under the


notice of the Probate Court, we have classified
into five grades. These constitute per
cent, of the population, the remaining class
(comprising all those who, when they die, leave
nothing, ‘so to speak’), make up the 671 per
cent, required to form the total.
Now, in dealing specifically with the
32|r per cent. ; viz., the wealth-possessors, it is
necessary (if we would gain a thorough under-
standing of the real position of affairs) to
behind the statistician’s figures, and this we
have done by means of figures given in Parlia-
ment, and recorded in Hansard ,
This has enabled us to break up into smaller
sections the class of probates under £5,000 each.
No details are otherwise available of the 1,525
estates which go to make up 94 percent, of the
number and only represent 20 per cent, of the
wealth (in the year 1890) which passed through
the Probate Court.
The figures in this class are remarkably even
year by year, the average for the four years,
1887 to 1890, being 1,528 per annum, with an
average value of £1,150,044 each year.
These represent, according to our method of
calculation, say, 92,164 persons living in the
enjoyment of wealth to the amount of
£70,152,684, or 92’5 of the property-owning-
class, with 21-44 per cent, of the -wealth, taken
on the average of four years, 1887 to 1890.


Thus we see that while 32|- per cent, of the
male adults possess all the wealth in the
country, per cent, of this more or less
wealthy class possess per cent, of that
wealth.
This is very striking, and should demonstrate
to the per cent, of the possessors of small
wealth that in espousing the cause of the more
equitable distribution of wealth, they are
advocating their own cause as well as that of
the wealthless and the poor.
New, let us break up these 92,164 possessors
of moderate wealth into five classes, and we
find :

We will now place our sacrilegious hand upon
the wealthy few who own four-fifths of all the
wealth, and classify them so far as published
statistics give us any guide
They number 7,409 persons, and possess
£246,993,200, or an average of £33,300 for
each person—2*4 per cent, of the population
possessing 75‘4 per cent, of the wealth, or

wealth (but not create it) ; for in the class
owning less than £5,000 each, and averaging
£873 apiece, 12 percent, of the owners possess
nearly half the wealth ; and in this wealthier
class, owning an average of £33,300 each, we
find that 11 per cent, own more than half the
wealth belonging to their class.
It would be very interesting to ascertain the
absolute limit which wealth has reached during
the last six years, and what is the,very largest
estate of over £50,000, whose owner has suc-
cumbed to the relentless hand of death;
possibly we might find that 10 per cent, of these
inordinately wealthy men (for so poor a country
as New South Wales) own half of the
£138,000,000.
Thus we should see that the same ratio of
increase, dogs the footsteps of the wealthy in


their race for wealth. Riches are absolutely
unsatisfying; the bigger the pile its slaves
possess, the more they still desire to add to it.
Now what does wealth represent ? It should,,
in a well ordered and well governed community,
represent that measure of happiness and enjoy-
ment, which it is capable of procuring or afford-
ing to its fortunate possessors.
But at that rate the owners of £l,OOO should
be ten times as happy as those who have £lOO.
How many times more happy these should
be than those who have nothing the rules of
arithmetic cannot tell us.
Then those possessing £lO,OOO should be ten
times as happy as those with one. Those with
£lOO,OOO should be ten times happier than
those with ten ; and the millionaire ten times
as happy as he with only £lOO,OOO. What a
wide field of thought this opens up !
Starting with the possessor of £lOO who
cannot be in absolute want of bare necessities of
life, we find the millionaire should be ten
thousand times as happy in his wealth as the
man who owns £lOO ; because if all his wealth
were scattered evenly among ten thousand
wealthless ones it would raise them all to the
happy position of being the possessors of £lOO
apiece ; this would indeed be a paradise for
many of them.


But no, good friends and readers, we know
that this is not so. Sufficiency brings happi-
ness in all tilings else, and should be so in
wealth when rightly used; but monstrous
fortunes are a curse, and not a blessing, in very
many cases, if not in all.
The solid honest joys of life are but the fruits
of human effort, heartily conceived, wisely
directed and perseveringly effected. These
give pleasure in their inception, in their con-
sideration, and in their carrying out. These
are the solid rock foundation on which to build
the edifice of a happy life.
Why then should we make laws that take so
large account of property and so small account
of poverty !
Let us strive to bring about a change and
O O
see that those who stand the most in need of
care and thought, shall have the most protec-
tion from the law, and not its punishment
alone, with a bare modicum of protection or
encouragement. We think too much of gold
and not enough of human flesh and blood.
Now let us see what is the tree of wealth
which grows this load of golden fruit and gives
it to the few instead of scattering it among the
many.
It cannot be the tree of commerce or finance,
for these are powerless to create, and only


serve for distribution or collection of the wealth
which others make, linking together the pro-
ducer and consumer, and making each pay toll
for the accommodation.
The shops, the warehouses, the banks, the
lawyers and the doctors are only little branches
of the tree, and their clerks and servants only
leaves upon those branches. The steamships
and the railways are big branches it is true, but
not the tree itself. The civil servants and the
government are but the blossoms who catch the
sunshine and attract the butterflies and busy
bees to visit them and fertilize them with the
taxes which they pay.
Where then is the trunk and where the
roots of this great tree ?
Just think again ! Where do trees generally
grow ? Why surely in the fertile lands, whose
soil is nourished by the rain of heaven and the
warm sunshine.
Y es, verily, the roots are in the land itself,
and that erect and mighty trunk is nothing but
the laws which deal with private ownership of
those good gifts of God, the sunshine and the
rain, for he who owns the land owns these as
well.
How fervently a man would pray for rain,
after a period of fierce drought, with a hundred
thousand acres parched and bare, and fifty


thousand starving sheep. What is the money’s
worth of three days’ steady rain to him ?
How earnestly he prays that rain may cease,
and sunshine come again, who sees his sheep
and cattle drowning. Yes, we say again, and
challenge contradiction, the ownership of
land gives earth and sky into the hands of him
that owns, and some would even think it
gives a title to the home beyond the sky, but
that we cannot tell ; the many mansions there
are doubtless built for rich and poor, for all
indeed who love justice more than gold, and
show mercy to the ignorant and outcast, whose
grim surroundings have made them what they
are.
If then the land is the great source of wealth,
do our statistics at all corroborate this theory ?
Surely so ! for in the diagram the land and
wealth tell just the self-same tale, in just the self-
same words, except that land speaks louder, and
cries out its message so that none but the deaf
can fail to hear its teaching. We would faintly
echo that same cry with our poor imitation of
the clarion tones of Nature’s ringing voice.
Surely the 656 who own the half of all the
freehold lands (and these the fairest) in New
South Wales, are they who own the better part
of half its wealth ; the other 206 being probably
their next of kin. And with equal certainty


the two hundred and eight thousand wealthless
are those who own no land, and the fifty
thousand other Landless men are also next of
kin to these.
No reasonable man can doubt it, for statistics
come again with their corroborating voice, and
there is some underlying truth in the details of
the estimate of private wealth (p. 632, Wealth
and Progress, see ante.)
We see here that the land, the improvements,
the live stock, and the mines, together 370 mil-
lions, represent the land, and what it bears,
for the improvements, and the live stock, are
but the children of the land ; apart from it they
could not possibly exist.
Now we can see just where our poverty
comes in. Private ownership in New South
Wales holds property roughly valued at
£400,000,000, but on which it owes nearly
£100,000,000 to English and Scottish mort-
gagees, and in spite of this burden, which the
entire wool clip of New South Wales cannot
much more than pay the interest on, five
thousand of these private owners only cultivate
200,000 acres of land, out of over 33 million
acres held by them. Let them place 30,000
men to work, and spend three millions (out of
their 200 millions), £IOO for each man’s labour,
and thereby bring half a million acres into


cultivation every year, to swell the produce of
the land, and the happiness, and contentment,
of the people.
Let us compare ourselves with Canada, with
whom we are trying to become more intimate,
via Vancouver. By the Homestead Law of
1870 in Canada (similar to the United States)
in Manitoba, 200 acres of land is granted free
to a family, on condition of building a log hut
16 feet by 20 feet, and cultivating 15 acres out
of every hundred. Adjoining public lands may
be bought at 4s. per acre, upon the same
conditions of cultivation. The cost of felling
timber to clear the land is £3 per acre.
In 1834 there were 5,000,000 acres in culti-
vation, out of 13,000,000 acres of farm lands.
In 1874 there were in Canada proper, i.e.,
Ontario and Quebec, 368,400 farms, comprising
34,250,000 acres, averaging 90 acres each, made
up as follows :

And, in 1881, the total number of farms had
increased to 588,970, comprising 67,650,000
acres, or 115 acres apiece.
What a wealth of industry these figures
represent. Is it any wonder that Canada is
prospering through courageous development of
the country, under these wise conditions and
admirable land laws ?
Why cannot we do likewise ? Because of
our injurious land laws ! We are the same
stock as half the Canadian people, but the
French element in Canada knows the value of
small holdings and earnest industry, and acts
upon this knowledge.
Bring the people on the land which cries out
for them in its desolate condition.
Pass a law that every freeholder must culti-
vate fifteen acres out of every hundred, or
forfeit half the balance of his unimproved area ;
give free leases of Crown lands to every settler
on these conditions ; and New South Wales, in
ten short years, would owe few mortgages to
Eno-lish or Scottish Banks.
What did France do, when, after the disas-
trous war of 1870, she lay bleeding under the
sword of Germany ? She had lost hundreds of
thousands of men, and £200,000,000 had been
spent in this cruel senseless war; and then to
crown the punishment of her rash folly,


Germany exacted a bond of £200,000,000 as
war indemnity.
All the woild thought that France was
crushed, for a generation, at least. But the
world knew not what intelligent, thrifty
industry can do, when linked in close embrace
with Nature’s bounty. The farmers came to
the rescue. They own their land, and work it
with a will, and get that rich reward which
everywhere will follow such patient industry as
theirs.
Large loans were floated. They were eagerly
taken up by small landholders at home—not
big financiers abroad ; and taken up at par !
over-subscribed in every case as each fresh loan
came out, and with incredible rapidity the debt
was paid. Franee was once more free, and not
a German soldier left upon her soil.
All the world wondered ! Whence came this
fabulous wealth ? Had Aladdin come with his
wonderful lamp to call the genii with gold and
jewels from the fairy caves ?
No ! only the spade, and plough, and reaping
hook, the wine-press, the olive vats, and
Man !!
The world knew not the unfathomable and
inexhaustible wealth that springs from small
holdings, through the infinite fecundity of
earth’s responsiveness to deep and thorough
culture.


2,826,000 owners cultivate
42,530,000 acres.
(Averaging 15 acres each)
882,000 tenants cultivate
29,900,000 acres.
(Averaging 36 acres each)
319,000 metayers* cultivate ...
11,920,000 acres.
This is fairy tale ! Let us see how it is
done.
The total area of France is
131,000,000 acres.
She cultivates
90,000,000 acres.
The number of owners is
3,226,000.
(Who average 32 acres apiece.)
The land is worth
£1,544,000,000.
The rental value is ... ... £158,000,000.
Land Tax at 4 per cent, realises... £6,700,000.
The tax on holdings under £5 per
annum is remitted. (There
are not many of these.)
(Averaging 37 acres each)
* The latter class pay their rent in an equitable pro-
portion of the crops.
Here is an object lesson ; need we wonder !
The only marvel is that with this lesson
staring other countries in the face, they do
not learn it, and strive to follow the grand
example of earnest work, under sound and
sensible economic conditions.
Have our legislators ever heard of these
things ? If not, we advise that they make a
study of them before they muddle into another
abortive Land Act !
Let them study similar lessons to be learnt
from Germany, Holland, Belgium, Hungary,


and Greece. Had they done so before they
stabbed the heart of New South Wales, and
bound her hands with their senseless land laws,
we should have had no calamitous financial panic,
and disastrous crisis, no national debt, no
mortgaged lands, drained to pay all their
produce to the Foreign holders of their bonds.

We have seen that the land constitutes the
principal factor in the wealth of this Colony ;
it should, therefore, be the source of its strength
and greatness
owners should come to the rescue when
the nation wants money for railways, roads and
bridges, irrigation, tanks and wells, schools
and public buildings.
Do the 862 owners of wealth to the extent
of £138,000,000 ; or the 656 owners of


21,000,000 acres, stand by the Government
with generous help in time of difficulty and
trouble ? Do they, with ready sympathy, find
work for willing, workless men, upon their
miles of wasted land, which yearns for culti-
vation ? When they do, then sound the praises
of large holdings—but not till then !
These men show little patriotism or sympathy
for their country when they leave it to live in
luxury and idleness in Paris or London, or any-
where but where their duty lies. National
greatness is not bred in this way; but rather
national beggary, bankruptcy and ruin.
Oh ! cursed land laws, that have helped to
bring this glorious country to such a state of
degradation : with its wealth almost untouched,
O } '
and unregarded, by those who might develop it,
and inaccessible to those who would.
Whilst our politicians go on resuming private
lands at twenty times their value; building
railways that lead nowhere, to enhance the
value of the rich man’s lands ; killing 25,000,000
rabbits in one year, at, heaven knows, what
cost, to save the rich man’s pasture ; while the
poor man starves for want of • bread, and is
driven to make the gaol his home.
Oh ! spurious Democratic Government
existing “By the People, For the People;”
well do you justify the name !


CHAPTER IV.
When the British Crown, by Act of Parlia-
ment, granted constitutional self-government to
the people of New South Wales, it gave them
also a common right in all the unalienated land
in the Colony. The government of that day
was, and every succeeding government has
been, and is, the executor, administrator, and
trustee of that grant.
In giving or selling private monopoly over
any portion of the National Estate, equity re-
quires that the grantor should in some way
receive an equivalent for the privileges vested
in the grantee.
The people were the grantors, and the
government of the day was supposed to be
their trustee. Let us therefore see in what
manner they have discharged their responsible
trust.
In 1856 the act which constituted New
South Wales a free, independent, and self-


governing community, under the crown of
Great Britain, became operative ; and at that
time no great area of land had been alienated,
for we find that in 1861, when the famous act
of Sir John Bobertson was passed, the total
area alienated during the previous 73 years of
the colony’s existence, amounted only to
7,338,539 acres, or one hundred thousand acres
per annum, out of a territory of 198,848,000
acres.
The country was ripening for development,
and a great opportunity was placed in the
hands of the Legislature of the day, for good
or ill. Fertile lands abounded on every hand;
population was gathering from the older coun-
tries of the world ; and the enterprising and
hardy sons and daughters of the mother country
looked with longing eyes to the vast island
continent in the Southern Ocean, which was
free to become a great and prosperous nation in
its own way, without the worry of that parental
restraint, which the great mother of Empires
exercises over the junior members of her large
and growing family.
Gold was to be picked up from the shining
sands, and crushed from the rugged rocks ;
minerals of all descriptions were coming to the
surface ; the earth was fruitful, and the sky was


blue and cloudless. The country thirsted for
people, and would repay their industry with no
niggard hand.
Here was the opportunity for the land
grabber and speculator. With every advance
of the tide of settlers so did the area of already
monopolized lands increase and confront them,
so that in an unknown land they had to start
for inaccessible regions in order to obtain the
land the London emigration agent offered, or
otherwise accept service at what appeared to
them (coming from the older countries) high
wages, or as a third alternative, risk their little
all in attempting to cultivate inferior lands.
Who can wonder that they chose the wage
alternative, and finding that every means oflife
was costly, saw no greater benefit in the higher
wages and the rougher living than in the life
they left behind them on the other side of the
world.
Thus it went on until from 1861 to 1884
32,819,023 acres had been taken up in various
methods which secure the freehold to the
holder (or 1,250,000 acres per annum). The
government then awoke to the fact that it was
not settling people on the land, but only fencing
them off from it, by this most sapient act of


theirs. They slumbered on while all the fairest
lands in New South Wales were passing into
the relentless hands of fortune hunting specu-
lators, land grabbers, or large holders; the
brothers, cousins, friends and kinsmen of the
generous trustees who gave away the people’s
lands without conditions, and gave the people
absolutely nothing in exchange, except a
national debt of £50,000,000, with a more or
less protective tariff on their sugar, tea, and
groceries, and such a heavy excise on their
drinks, that when you asked for whisky at a
country bar you got a grim decoction of potato
spirit, which should have been labelled poison !
Thus they sold the people’s heritage. Sold
did we say? No practically they gave away
the land and sold only the people.
The thirty millions paid into the Treasury,
as purchase money, was facetiously labelled
“ Revenue,” and while this bogus revenue
continued to flow in, was spent with lavish hand
among contractors and wage earners. The latter
little thought the wages that they drew for
killing rabbits, digging wells, buildings railways,
roads and bridges, was their own money, which
had bought their birthright from them, while
they prided their complacent selves upon the
splendid prospects of the country which was being
thus artificially developed. And lest this self-


complacency should cease too soon amongst the
masses these guardians of the public rights
borrowed large loans to keep the people busy
at this noble work of opening up a country,
no longer theirs, alas !
In this way more than fifty millions was soon
spent, and all the time the owners of these
private freehold lands did nothing towards
improving them by cultivation. They only
fenced them in, knowing that “ unearned
increment ” would pay them better bonuses
than crops, and they could trade upon the
people’s wants more profitably than upon their
labour.
So all this time the politicians told the
people how the country was prospering, and
they cheered them to the echo ! Thus successive
Premiers have been all but demi-gods amongst
them, whilst they robbed them of their birth-
right !
But, hush ! we must not write such words as
these ; we ought perhaps to say in more
respectful terms, while they made the fortunes
of their friends who knew the country, and
could pick the eyes out of it at £1 per acre,
and then ask £5O per acre, when to keep the
people still working at high wages they made
profitless railways to enhance the value of land.


So when the railways were made and roads and
oridges built, all at the “national” expense ; the
price of land went up enormously, so much so that
the private holdings are now said by Mr.
Coghlan to be valued by their owners (in view
of possible taxation) at about £180,000,000,
adding that “It is well understood, however,
that the capital value of unimproved land is
generally greatly understated so, allowing for
the patriarch David’s views of human truthful-
ness, perhaps we had better add another fifty-
millions.
Then we shall judge how good a bargain
these wise speculators made, who see the value
of their purchases multiplied by six, without an
effort at improvement, in the short space of not
much more than half a generation.
Oh, fortunate investors, what lucky men you
are ! and, oh, ye happy people ! what trusty,
men you sent to Parliament to govern you and
build up that prosperity which loomed so large
before you, when yourejoiced with suchexceeding
gladness (30 years ago), at the thought of being
Free ! and governing yourselves.
The sun of that fictitious day of false pros-
perity set years ago, and the gloom of night
inevitably followed, and now the chilly dawn
appears and you are poor and landless, wanting
work and finding none, wages are falling, and


the Daily Telegraph tells you in a leading
article (October 31st) that it is urgently
necessary to decide quickly upon throwing open
the Central Division of the colony for selection,
because these splendid lands south of the
Lachlan could grow wheat enough to supply
half the population of England !
God forbid that any more large areas of land
should be alienated until more equitable
conditions are imposed upon the buyers, than
those at present ruling.
Already, as we see upon the diagram, more
than twenty million acres of splendid lands are
in the hands of 656 freeholders, who cultivate
one acre in 650, and we have been importing
wheat from other lands for our own bread.
What a grim satire to talk of feeding England
O O
by more alienation of those fertile lands? Tn
order that the speculator may grab the lot and
cultivate one acre in 600 more likely !
Already the country groans beneath the
weight of freehold lands that have not even
seen the plough in the dim distance. If we
want land brought under tillage we must pass
an Act compelling every freeholder to cultivate
15 acres out of every hundred, as they do in
Canada, or forfeit his title. This would brino-
the wheat to Sydney market, and provide


work for all those unemployed who want it.
This would give an opportunity to settlers to
farm the lands within 200 miles of Sydney,
near the railways and struggling towns, which
are now paralyzed by the locking up of these
large and uncultivated holdings.
Look at Canada and see how Ontario is
prospering under these wise conditions. Seven
million acres under tillage out of 21 million
acres alienated, growing 118,000,000 bushels of
grain on 220,000 farms, which average 90 acres,
with 30 acres tilled on each, against our 10
million bushels, grown on 50,000 holdings,
which average over 800 acres each, with less
than 900,000 acres cultivated.
The agricultural produce of Ontario, in four
cereals, and potatoes, amounts to £16,000,000
per annum, while ours is only £1,800,000. We
have twice the area alienated, while they have
nearly ten times more than we in cultivation.
It is not the quality but the quantity of land
that makes this mighty difference ; yea, surely,
and the quality of the laws !
Let us see how our agricultural produce is
made up, and wdiat it realises, and then compare
ourselves with Canada, France, and the little
Channel Islands, those models of miniature self-
government in their sea-girt homes, which are

Can we any longer fail to learn the lessons
that these figures teach.
Other nations appraise their lands upon the
value of their actual production, we value ours
at what they might be worth if they were
cultivated, which they are not! ’Tis only thus
that we can show ourselves a wealthy people to
the world, but what a hollow show ! What a
bubble of financial fraud ! The point of our
poor pen may even prick it, and, lo ! there is
not soap and water left enough to wash the
stains of folly, fraud, and ignorance, from the
deep dyed hands of our political adventurers.
No, good friends and readers, these stains
will long remain indelible, until honest labour
can hide them with the honourable soil of our
good mother earth, her bosom bared of the wild
growth of savage ages, and made to smile with
waving corn, with clustering vines, whose
promise of the ruddy grape shall gladden all our
hearts, when our gardens shall blossom with
sweet fruits, and spices, olives, and orangeries,
pomegranates (emblem of fecundity), and last,
when duly cultivated, the humble market garden
shall give us in abundance herbs and table
vegetables to sweeten every meal throughout
the day, and keep our bodies in that joyous
restful health which simple diet brings, lessening
the ravenous desire for flesh, which (in excess)
makes wolves of us rather than men.


While the people slumbered the paramount
desire of more than one reforming legislator was
to educate them, so that in early life they
might with eager and insatiable avidity store
their young minds with the learning of the
present and past ages, and Free Libraries were
extravagantly provided for their use. They
quite forgot that education, to be worthy the
name, must be a preparation for the future life
of these young people ; and that the lot of
mankind is to labour for the bread that
satisfieth.
Unfortunately, these reforming legislators
were educated in the school which teaches that
when this fair world was in its infancy, ‘and it
was very good ’ [Genesis 1., 31, et sequeter), God
cursed the land, for Adam’s sake ; and made it
bring forth thorns and thistles and His special
curse on man (made in His own bright image),
was that in sorrow he should eat herbs of the
field ; and, in sweat of his sorrowful face, eat
bread till he return to that same ground from
whence he was but lately taken. And woman,
whom God made a helpmeet for him ; wdiat
was her sad lot to be ? ‘I will greatly multiply
thy sorrow and thy conception ; and in sorrow-
shalt thou bring forth children.’
Oh, bitter woe ! that we should in our child-
hood see the face of God distorted in this
hideous picture ; would that it were henceforth


blotted out for ever, and we only learn that
heaven declares God’s glory, and earth His
constant and unfailing goodness.
Then might we see that labour under rational
conditions is the very well-spring of all happi-
ness, of health, of vigor, and of plenty.
The whole world lives upon its labours, and
Nature’s surplus bounty to the labourer alone
affords the wealth and splendour enjoyed by the
rich and mighty
The fruits of labour should belong to him
who calleth forth these fruits by his untiring
industry—but to go one better than the oracle
on which their false ideas of the Almighty
Sovereign Ruler of the Universe are based—
these reforming legislators not only make the
masses eat their bread mixed with the sweat of
toil, but even take half of the loaf away, which
should be theirs and their dear little ones, to
give to that vile wanton thing called “luxury,”
so falsely labelled civilization.
All this is done by the private ownership of
land, unguarded by restrictions and conditions
for beneficial use.
Now, the sunshine and the rain, the earth
and sky extending over fifty or one hundred
miles of territory, may be the absolute possession
of one man (even though he be an imbecile),


without whose sanction none may dare to turn
a sod or sow a grain of corn ; though all the
land is yearning to bring forth her increase.
This the owners’ clenched fist and wire-barbed
fence, backed by unjust laws, forbids.
And what has our system of education done
for these children of the masses up to now ?
Go to the Free Libraries, and enquire what
books are chiefly read ; and you will find that
for one book of natural science, economic
culture, history or philosophy, taken out, there
are, at least, a score of novels.
These fire the young imagination, and burn
the energy to ashes; wild adventure, thrilling
passion, lust and crime, wrapped up in gloss of
lying words and false ideals of life. The
sovereign and almighty factor of the world they
read about may be described as ‘ Gilded
Pleasure ! ’
How far better had it been that we taught
the children’s fingers usefulness, dexterity and
skill in anything, no matter what; for capable
hands ne’er yet have made a sorrowing heart,
unless by some rare accident or crime ; while
helpless, idle hands have ever been the foster
mothers of want, and all the great brood of sin,
and shame, and crime, and misery; whose
tyrant father is inequitable Law, and corrupt
administration.


Within the last few months, an Australian
Minister for Education, when he gave away the
prizes at a Public National School, offered to
present a Bracelet! (mark you) to the girl who
would write an essay on higher education; or
some such subject fitter for the teacher than the
taught. And, alas ! he gave the bracelet later
on. Would not he have done a wiser, nobler
act if he had promised every girl a gridiron, or
a frying-pan, if she could cook a tender, juicy
chop or steak, without destroying its nutri-
tious quality ; or three flat-irons to any who
could iron a shirt or collar so that her father-
might not be disgraced in wearing it. These
latter gifts and capabilities make girls real
treasures in a house and home, and fit them to
control one, when in the course of nature they
may fulfil their destiny, and become ‘ happy ’
wives and mothers. But, higher education !
Are all our budding maidens of thirteen years
old aspiring to be pupil-teachers ? Is this the
goal of life that they look forward to ? We
trust not, for if this is so, then, while false laws
make poor men’s lives a burden to them out of
doors, false wives will make that burden terrible
to bear within the home. For higher education,
as our legislators seem to understand it, brings
with it false pride, intense dissatisfaction with,
and unfitness for, a humble life of simple industry.
Aye ! but the only really higher education is


that which may exalt a boy’s or girl's ability,
to do right well and thoroughly whatever his
or her deft hand may find to do. This can
alone conduct a nation along that path of life
which leads to sound prosperity and beneficial
wealth ; the path of wise and earnest industry,
sheltered from the chilling wind of poverty,
and nourished by the sunshine of contentment.


CHAPTER V.
In the last chapter we made some com-
parisons between New South Wales and
Ontario, France, and the Channel Islands.
These three subjects of comparison are each
unique in their own characteristics. Ontario is
a province of a great dominion with responsible
self-government under the Imperial crown of
Great Britain, and occupies a position of sister-
hood to New South Wales; her progress has
been both rapid and substantial, she has escaped
the recent financial panic and banking disaster
which has visited the United States and Europe,
and her welfare and stability are in large measure
due to her excellent land laws, and the agricultural
spirit which finds its encouragement thereunder.
The land grabber and speculator has no voca-
tion in that country ; the laws do not provide
shelter and maintenance for him and all his
abominations.
Railway enterprise has been developed upon
profitable lines, not to boom the value of the
land, but to bring its ‘ produce ’ into the
markets of the world. They have been
economically built by private enterprise under
state patronage. They reward the enterprising


and courageous pioneers who pressed them
forward with such bold determination, and are
a source of wealth to the people who use them
for their produce and merchandise. The
freights are low and hence the traffic large and
fairly remunerative.
There were in 1886,11,523 miles of railway in
Canada, of which the greater portion has been
built during recent years. Now the grand trunk
line links Quebec with Vancouver, passing
through and affording views of the most varied
and picturesque character, comprising some of
the grandest and sublimest mountain and lake
scenery in the world. This will become one of
the highways of the world’s traffic, and many a
citizen of New South Wales in journeying to
the mother country, for profit or pleasure, may
thus have an opportunity of studying the
natural and economic conditions of a country
which will play no unimportant part in the
world’s drama of the future.
France occupies the proud position of being
the best cultivated country in the world. This
position she has achieved during the present
century, in a measure the result of the upheaval
with which the last century closed—inrevolution,
fire and blood. It was a bitter struggle through
which she fought her way to freedom, and
wrung from her hands the shackles of her
slavery. Although in her wild passion against


the class that had so long tyrannized over her,
many a deed of wrong was done, which makes
the history of her great release a bloody record.
Now the oppressor and his slaughterers are
buried beneath the shade of a hundred years
of steadily increasing progress ; intermitted, it
is true, with stormy episodes and occasional
confusion. The economic policy of France has
set an object lesson to the world which other
nations that are wise will pay attention to and
study carefully for their own benefit.
Politically France is still unsettled, and
adventurers rise on the gust of some momentary
party cry only to lose themselves again in their
legitimate obscurity. While Frenchmen prac-
tice in their life and work the laws of economic
truth, the fleeting thunder showers of political
disturbance will do but little harm to the solid
backbone of their great prosperity, the strength
and elasticity of which is founded on land
tenure in small holdings, with deep and
thorough culture of the fruitful soil.
The little Channel Islands are unique in this:
that the population is a happy blend of France
and England, with many of the virtues apper-
taining to each race—these very virtues
through their great dissimilarity have kept
their parent nations constantly at strife with
one another all through the centuries of the
past. But on these tiny islands there is not


room for strife and industry to dwell together,
so the people give a home and welcome to the
latter while they turn their backs upon the
former. This is how these little spots of earth
(which the storms of the Atlantic are inch by
inch destroying, so that in the long distant
future they will be washed away entirely)
support in comfort and contentment the densest
population that any country in the world can
show, for none are very rich and none are very
poor. Here peasant, priest and tradesman,
governor and labourer, extend the quality of
courtesy to one another, and live in harmony,
because each does his duty and finds both
pleasure and good profit in it.
The customary land tenure in the Channel
Islands is worthy of consideration. At the
death of each land-owner the law provides for
the division of his land between his children.
But many of the holdings are already so
diminutive, that further sub-division is not
advisable. Under these circumstances one
member of the family buys out the interest of
the others ; and, having fixed upon the price,
in money, the sum is then converted into an
equivalent of wheat, and any balance of the
purchase money which remains unpaid becomes
a charge upon the land, and the interest, at five
per cent., is payable in a stated quantity of
wheat, or its equivalent in market value. Thus


with the fluctuations in the value of the land’s
products so does the charge upon it vary. And
every year when the House of Jurors ( i.e .,
Parliament) assemble, they fix the price at
which these wheat rents shall be payable
throughout the islands. The tenant has
absolute and undisturbed possession, so long as
the wheat charge is paid each year, within a
certain time from gathering in the harvest.
This is a truly economic form of rent, because
the land pays for itself in its own constant coin
of natural productiveness; or its varying
equivalent in money. Thus, when the people’s
bread is cheap, the farmer need sell no more
wheat to pay his rent than when the bread is
dear. This links the people and the land
together in a bond of common welfare and joint
interest. It is mainly through these equitable
economic conditions, and the industry prevailing
in these islands, that they support so large a
population. The total area of the group is only
73 square miles, of which a third is barren rock,
incapable of any kind of culture, yet out of
32,000 acres of intensive agriculture, a popula-
tion of 93,000 find a living, in as prosperous a
condition as any community in the whole wide
world, mainly out of fruits, cereals, roots,
dairy produce, and poultry. The exports to
the United Kingdom exceed £1,200,000 per
annum, including 70,000 tons of new potatoes


and an enormous quantity of fruit, vegetables,
butter, eggs, and poultry.
There are no Customs duties here, and no
excise. Beer, wine, spirits, and tobacco are
cheap and pure. The public revenue is £56,000
per annum, which covers all the cost of admin-
istration ; and the public debt is only £345,000,
all subscribed and held within the islands; the
harbours, quays, markets, schools, and public
buildings are all efficiently maintained. Justice
is easily obtainable, because in open court each
citizen may plead his cause in person, without
the aid of much attention from the lawyer.
There are very few police, and the duties of
these few are light because there is so little
crime ; all the boys are trained to carry arms,
and w*ould defend their independence with their
blood, in case of need, which God forbid there
ever should be while the flag of Britain floats
upon their castle towers, in sign of her right
brotherly protection. For these tiny islands do
not admit that they ‘ belong ’ to England ; they
rather claim that England belongs to them;
for they were part of Normandy before the
Conquest, and the Norman conquered England;
so that they were joined to England by peace-
ful federation. The wonderful fertility of these
little Islands is Nature’s generous response to
those who waste no opportunity, but cultivate
every acre that is suitable for tillage. Upon


the small farm or garden holding, crop follows
crop in rapid succession, through a year which
knows no winter. No sooner is one crop off
the ground than the young plants of another
crop are speedily transplanted into it, so that
the land is never idle and the husbandman is
constantly employed.

Now leaving Jersey, let us take a trip to
Turkey. In Bessarabia, formerly one of the
most fertile provinces of the Ottoman Empire,
there are good land laws. Think of that! even
the much-reviled unspeakable Turk is ahead of
New South Wales in the natural economics of
the land.
The rent of agricultural land averages five
shillings per acre. Thousands of acres of fruit-
ful vineyards at this moderate rental yield 300
gallons of wine per acre ; maize yields sixty
bushels to the acre, with other fruits and cereals
in like productiveness. Is this another miracle ?
Yes, reader, it is the miracle of small land-
holding; for in this province there are 350,000
small land-holders who average thirty acres
each. Bemember that in New South Wales
we have only 50,000 land holdings, which
average 823 acres each.
In Turkey proper the economic laws of
great Mohammed are based upon the law laid
down by Moses (and even many Christians,


when they are at church, believe that Moses
taught the law of God). This law knows no
such thing as private ownership of ‘ land; ’
any man may farm any uncultivated land,
paying certain fees or a proportion of the crop
to the ‘ pasha ’ or governor who rules the
district and represents the state. The grant is
forfeited if the land remains uncultivated for
three years. If honestly administered, which
frequently it is not, the Moslem law might
stand beside the laws of many a Christian land.
Some pashas are corrupt and grind the poor,
but we doubt if any Moslem since the birth of
Islam ever spoke words of such burning shame
to his own country as one of our ex-ministers
spoke at Narrabri not many weeks ago (a
barrister and would-be premier); said he : “the
“ statute laws of New South Wales are the
“ worst laws in the world, and if a man
“ wants justice in New South Wales he goes
“ into one court for law and another court for
“ equity, and when he comes out of both he
“ has obtained neither j” If this be true, surely
some of the shame of this is his, for he did not add
(and probably could not truthfully do so), that
during his 12 years’ of membership in the Legis-
lative Assembly the object of his life had been
to purify the statute book, and arrest the
passage of unjust law !

Morocco is an empire which the western
mind regards as ‘ very backward in the arts of
civilization.’ In travelling there, one almost
fancies that the world’s great clock has not
been wound up for a thousand years or more ;
the peasant life reminds one of the childhood of
the world. There under Moslem law the land
is free for he who wills to cultivate ; paying a
tribute of its produce to the Sultan or his
delegates. The soil is rich and the climate very
much like New South Wales. Every kind of
simple food is plentiful, so that a family can
live in comfort on 6d. per day of our money ;
one luxury is all the people know of, the luxury
of plenty and simplicity, with gratitude to
Allah for his bounty. A hundred generations
free from the taint of alcohol has left the race
with all the vigour of the ancient world ; pure
Arab men are lithe and stalwart and the
maidens graceful. To be an Arab is to be a man
with some few faults and many noble virtues,
not the least of which are dignity, courtesy and
fidelity. The writer travelled many days
across the plains and tablelands away from
Tangiers, and gathered much useful information
from his friend and host, the Belgian minister
to Morocco, and under his kind escort and
protection received the greatest courtesy and
friendship from the people, who, as a rule, do
not welcome strange visitors.


From Morocco it is not many hours voyage'
to Spain, the land that once was very fruitful,,
and may be so again under wise administration.
Eight hundred years ago its southern cities
were the fairest, most eminent, and highly
civilized in the world. Seville now contains
under 150,000 souls, it then maintained
nearly two millions. All the land around
was highly cultivated ; now it lies waste, and
breeds a few half wild and savage cattle for
the bull ring. Cordova had a population of
a million, it now has 56,000. Its universities
were then frequented by learned men from
all the east; all the arts and sciences
had reached a high perfection—because the
Moslem land law gave the land to any who would
cultivate it, paying tribute of its produce to the
state.
This healthy law alone can make a nation
prosperous and happy, and, if not counter-
balanced by another Moslem law, would
certainly secure stability to every state adopting
it. Polygamy destroyed the Moorish Empire ;
for when each sultan died, who in his lifetime
had been great and powerful, at least a hundred
sons had equal title to the throne, and each
had followers who would support his claim with
their bright scimitars. Thus party strife let


in the common enemy, and overthrew the
brightest empire of the early middle ages.
Eight hundred years ago the valley of
Grenada was the fairest and best cultivated land
in all the world —a very garden of sweet fruits
and flowers. It supported a population of about
3,000,000 by skilful agriculture and systematic-
irrigation, where now less than 500,000 find
scanty employment. Oranges, olives, figs and
pomegranates were introduced to Spain under
the Moorish rule, and the hollow trunks of noble
ancient trees may now be seen still bearing
fruit, whose early youth had seen the crescent
flag flying above the towers of the Alhambra
400 years ago.
The land of Spain passed then by Feudal
law into the hands of large landholders whose
decendents hold it now. Out of 121 million
acres 99 are lying waste. 596,000 holders
average 95 acres each ; only 22 million acres
are cultivated, while tier neighbour France has
90 millions, in holdings averaging 32 acres
each, cultivated by 3,226,000 owners.
Under the varying conditions of progress,,
civilization and economic culture, the European
nations have each some very potent lessons to
teach us, through the study of their material
statistics, taken in conjunction with some


knowledge gathered from observance ot the
condition of the people. The aggregate or
average wealth of a community may be large,
and yet composed of great extremes of poverty
and wealth, the poverty belonging to the many,
the wealth accumulated amongst the few, so
that the result may be a superabundant luxury
for the very few, a bare competence to the
middle classes, with indigence, incessant toil,
and hardship for the laborious wealth pro-
ducers.
Holland and Belgium are two kindred states
that history has associated together for many
centuries. Alike in their prosperity and
industry, in natural conditions they are most
unlike. Holland is the lowland country with
deep rich fruitful soil, the finest dairy grounds
in Europe ; everywhere canals occupy the place
of roads and carry produce cheaply to the
markets. In the winter skating is the common
mode of locomotion. Belgium, on the other
hand, is plain or upland country, gravelly and
sterile (by nature), only made fruitful by man’s
hearty and hardworking industry ; yet see how
this poor barren land (just like the land round
Paris) has gone ahead of its most fertile
neighbour, all through ‘ small holdings ’
Note these statistics and mark the difference!
—all in favour of the ‘ sterile ’ country made
fertile by small holders.

Although there is the widest difference in
the natural characteristics of the peoples, in
industry they run each other neck and neck.
J'he Dutch are kindred to the Danes and
Germans. The Belgians are more kindred
with the French. Both have Teutonic per-
severance well developed in their blood. The
system of government in Belgium gives great
political freedom, and, at the same time, pays
constant attention to economic questions and
the development of industry and the national
resources. Technical education in regard to
agriculture, mining, and manufactures is
thoroughly organized and systematically carried


out; while in the principal cities and towns
chambers of commerce and manufactures, work-
ing under State direction, gather statistics, and
seek in every possible way to promote the
welfare and prosperity of the nation and the
people.
The mineral wealth of Belgium is great, her
coalfields put out more than 20,000,000 tons
per annum, and her iron is famous throughout
the world. Her marble, and slate quarries give
employment to many thousands, and her
mechanical industries are as varied as those of
any country. Thus we may say that wdiile
Nature gave Belgium a sterile and unproduc-
tive soil, man, by his arts and industry, has
made it rank amongst the most fruitful and
productive countries in the world. Manure,
and labour have enabled it to support a popu-
lation (1890) of over 540 to the square mile,
(while the average population of Europe is.
only 90 to the square mile, and that of New
South Wales is less than 4, and Great Britain
360. Moreover, it supports them in full
sufficiency of all the means of life, while the
surplus wealth which it is able to spare for
export to less favoured countries, amounts to
over £3 per head of its entire population.
Belgium is divided into nine provinces, and
in each province there is an agricultural com-


mission appointed by the King ; delegates from
each, with specialists, form a Supreme Council
of Agriculture. There are six special services
connected with the Department of Agriculture
dealing with Forestry, Clearing and Planting,
Irrigation, Veterinary Affairs, Cultivation
Agricultural Laboratories.
The tendency in Belgium is to a great
subdivision of holdings ; these increased from
572,550 in 1846 to 910,396 in 1880 (the date of
the latest statistics). At that date the holdings
were as follows :

latter year 1,761,157 acres were worked by
owners, and 3,138,164 by farmers (tenants.)

Denmark is another country whose agricul-

The religion is' Lutheran, the people are
frugal and hardy, hospitable and amiable;
education is highly advanced. The climate is
by no means genial, the winters are long, cold
and dreary, and agricultural work is carried on
against unfavourable conditions. In spite of
this, however, the crops of cereals and cattle
reared are greater in proportion to the popula-
tion than those of any other country in Europe.
Cereals and dairy produce are the leading-
exports, and form the mainstay of the country.

with climate in accordance.
The soil of Denmark is now being greatly
subdivided, owing partly to the action of recent
laws which interdict the union of small farms
into larger estates, and encourage, in various
ways, the parcelling out of landed property,
leaving the tenant entire control of his land so
long as he cultivates it and pays his rent.
Of the total area of Denmark, 80 per cent, is
productive—of the unproductive area, one-sixth
is peat bogs ; of the productive area, 6 per cent.
is forest; 45 per cent, is arable; and 49 per
cent, pasture and meadows.

Both the natural and economic conditions of
Hungary are so peculiar, that it is worthy of
more than passing notice. Hungary has no
line except a length of less than 100 miles
bordering on the north-east of the Adriatic,
O 9
which is part of the Hungarian division of the
empire of Austro-Hungary. This coast is
mountainous and barren, as well as riverless ; it
therefore is of little value to the country, except
that it maintains a few hardy fishermen, who
get their scanty living upon its boisterous
waters, and qualify themselves to man the navy
of the empire, if they survive the many tempests
which they incessantly encounter, in this stormy
sea.
The River Danube is the great highway of
•commerce and communication with the outer
world. For more than 500 miles this noble
stream flows through thecountry, and foranother
150 miles forms part of its most southern
boundary. All the other rivers in the province
.are tributaries to this the second largest in
Europe.
The central part of Hungary is one vast
plain, which extends south-east from Buda
Pesth (the capital), with Szegedin as its centre,
>upon the River Theiss. This river in 1879
broke down its artificial banks, and covered
many thousand miles of country with its devas-
tating flood. The sluggish flow of this great


tributary of the Danube silts up the river bed
continually with alluvial and instead
of compensating this by frequent dredging, the
people built the banks higher and higher, until
at last the river bed was above the surface of
the country surrounding it on either bank.
Then after years of false security, came great
calamity ; many thousands lost their homes,
their flocks and herds, their crops, and though
fewer lost their lives, the death roll was a sad
and terrible one, causing the greatest consterna-
tion throughout Europe. This plain covering
36,000 square miles includes large areas of wild
waste lands. In winter a succession of morasses,
or storm-swept snow fields. In spring a
paradise qf most seductive verdure and wild
flowers. In summer a scorched and withered
desert. This is the pastoral country, and the
life is one of hardship, poverty, and danger for
the shepherds and the herdsmen, whose watch
fires, seen at night, are the only indication
which passing travellers see of human life or
habitation.
Alternating with these dangerous morasses
are splendid stretches of most fertile agricultural
country. Here grows the finest wheat in
Europe. This is ground to flour in frequent
floating mills upon the Danube, anchored in
the stream. Its current drives their whole
machinery, in constant work by day and night,


drawing power from the moving water by
means of countless paddle wheels. Each
floating mill is thus a wharf, a corn store, and a
factory, and every year abundant wealth of
food, passing a thousand miles down the Danube
and through the Mediterranean, is found upon
the markets of almost every European seaport
city. Probably the ‘ Lily of the Danube ’
brand of finest pastry flour is not unknown in
Australasia. It is the choicest flour in the
world. Milling on the Danube by means of
polished steel rollers instead of mill stones was
for several years far in advance of that of any
other country. The system is being rapidly
adopted now by all progressive countries. The
south-east portion of Hungary from Szegedin,
including a large part of Transylvania, is almost
an unbroken stretch of this splendid agricultural
land, growing the most abundant crops of wheat
and maize, as well as cotton, rice, and other
products of more southerly climes. In all this
wide stretched plain there are practically no
cities of importance. The largest towns are
only huge agricultural villages, with few public
buildings, and ill-paved streets. Even those
with from 20 to 50 thousand inhabitants have
no other industries but those which minister to
the simple wants of an agricultural community.
The country all around is very ill-supplied with
roads, so that the possibilities of communication


are largely dependent upon the weather ; in
summer the hard-baked level surface makes-
traffic easy along- the beaten tracks, but in the
winter the saturated earth, until it freezes,
would swallow up any load that may be placed,
on wheels.
The progress of the country, away from
navigable waters, dates from the introduction
O '
of railways connecting these huge villages and
carrying their produce to more distant markets.
There were in 1891 7,480 miles of railway
open for traffic at a cost of nearly £40,000,000,
and recently a new departure has been made
for the development of traffic, equalising the
charges for the same, by adopting what is called
the zone system. Under this system each kind
of traffic between all stations in an extended
district is carried at an uniform rate of freight
with satisfactory results to all concerned.
Prior to 1876 the record was as follows :
“ Hungary has great natural wealth, but the
f land laws prevent development. Large
“ estates, equal to ‘ small states,’ are entailed,
“ and heavy taxes are a burden on the people
“to maintain the nobility. Only 31 per cent, of
“ the population can read and write. - Ten
“ families own one-sixth of the soil, and
“ 1,086 holders own 4,342,484 acres. The


“crops average 121 million bushels, value
“ £78,000,000.”
* * * * *
Since this date, however, great constitutional
changes have been made in the system of
government and land tenure, through the
determination of the people to throw olf the
yoke of tyranny that so long oppressed them
with crushing exactions, to maintain an idle,
luxurious, and unproductive class, who robbed
the poor and lived on their necessities. This
spirit was unmistakably shown in the constant
revolutionary disturbances which occurred
between 1848 and 1867, when the present
king (and emperor) swore to maintain the
Constitution (granted in 1222), which had been
repeatedly suspended and practically disregarded
by his predecessors. Upon taking this oath lie
was crowned King of Hungary, and many have
been the reforms introduced since then. The
latest statistics available (1889) will presently
show with what result upon the productiveness
of the land and the welfare of the people.
In 1889 (according to an official report) the
land in Hungary is divided as follows :

The crop of wine varies greatly through careless

and the crop has produced as much as 374,000,000
gallons of wine in one year.

In practical education an important move-
ment has been made in the right direction,
which New South Wales might wisely imitate.
There are in Hungary 449 special technical
institutes, training in agriculture, industries of
all kinds, art, music, mining, commerce, &c.,
with 40,000 students.


In Hungary by the Trade Law, 1884, every
Commune where there are 50 apprentices or
more is bound to provide special instruction.
The first schools were established in Buda
Pesth in 1887, and numbered 12, with 125
teachers and 5173 pupils; in 1888 the numbers
in Buda Pesth were 16 schools, 151 teachers,
6,459 pupils.
In the other towns of Hungary there were
(1888) 229 schools for apprentices, with 1237
teachers and 38,081 pupils.
In 1889 in Hungary proper there were 81'49
per cent, of the children at elementary schools.
Full liberty of faith and conscience is secured,
and the enjoyment of civil and political rights
is independent of religious profession.
Those who are wholly or partially unfit for
work may be provided for in such manner as
the commune judges propose. Besides poor-
houses and money relief, there exists in many
provinces by custom or by constitutional rule,
the practice of assigning the poor, in respect of
board and lodging, to each of the resident
householders in fixed succession, and every step
is taken towards the suppression of vagrancy
and begging.
These blessed rights and privileges were not
secured without a long and bitter struggle, and
it required much patriotic blood to fertilize the
soil which now is bearing such a healthy crop


of wise reform and beneficial legislation. In
the ranks of those whose laurel crowns will live
for ever the great Kossuth will hold high place
in every heart in Hungary that beats with
steady pulse, in earnest hope of great and pros-
perous future for his country and her people.
ITALY.
Italy has made great progress since Garibaldi
and Gavazzi took the people’s cause in hand
and fought for it, the one with sword the other
with his head and pen, and then Cavour stepped
in and joined the cause for just so much as it
would answer his subtle diplomatic purpose
to secure. Under his crafty guidance the
people were united, and shed their blood to
bring about this union, but they lost the prize
for which they chiefly fought—freedom to live
upon the land which gave them birth. Italy,
however, will yet achieve her purpose, if she be
true to those great principles which made her
ancestors of long ago, the great Roman nation.
In spite of the fact that 87 per cent, of all
the land is made productive by human industry
in one form or another, the people yet are poor,
and leave their sunny fertile country (which
they love with all their hearts) in vast increasing
multitudes every year. The official record for
1891 shows that 293,631 emigrants left the


shores of Italy, or nearly a thousand every day
throughout the year, to find a home in other
countries. She can ill afford to lose her blood
like this, for her births only exceeded the
deaths by 336,835 in the same year. Such
losses cannot bring prosperity to any nation,
the land would carry twice its present popula-
tion if he Avho tills the land might eat the fruit
thereof.
In Italy the system of land tenure, which has
prevailed for centuries throughout the greater
part of the peninsula, may be described as
‘ share and share alike.’ It has a very equitable
sound until we know who are the sharers, and
what they each contribute to the bargain.
The noble, or landowner, lends the land
(which only should be his conditionally on his
using it) to his poor tenant, who has to do the
cultivation without receiving any wages for his
labour, and then at harvest time the half of all
the profit of the land, which Nature’s generous
bounty gives as the fair wages for the labourer’s
toil and care, must go to him who claims that
this fair earth with all its opportunities, is his
by right of title deeds. The other half
will barely keep the family of the man who
by his blood and sweat has made the face of
Nature smile with fruitfulness, upon the spot
the noble lord so generously lends him, and
so he throws it up and leaves the sunny


glorious land that gave him birth (and has
bred a noble race of men for more than 30
centuries).
We will show you the balance-sheet of Italy’s
productiveness in 1890, and the value of it, and
then we may realize what New South Wales
may come to, unless we tear up unjust land
monopoly by the roots, and free our country
from it for ever !

The production of all this wealth employed
nearly nine million pairs of human hands, and
half this went to the landowners.
Thou shalt not covet, and thou shalt not
steal ! These are the two Mosaic laws on which
half of our jurisprudence is built up, and on the
* lawful ’ breach of both these laws are founded
all the title deeds giving ownership to land
throughout the world which bears the honoured
name of ‘ civilized.’
’Twas covetousness that prompted war and
conquest; ’twas conquest first gave ‘ ownership ’
and from this conquest every land title
springs. The title is polluted at the fountain
head ; it is a law of ‘ wrongs ’ not right, and all
its cruel offsprings of lazy luxury in purple, and
poverty and want in rags, and grasping greed
in ever} 7 kind of garb, are not the children of
true civilization.
Thus we have seen that throughout the
world, in all progressive countries, great changes
are taking place in the system of Land Tenure.
The Feudal Tenure of the middle ages was
more a responsible trust, which entailed military
and other service to the State rather than
ownership. These services have become obso-
lete during the last few centuries, and the
descendants of the Feudal Lords have long
exercised rights of absolute ownership for which
there is no foundation in natural law or justice.


and they have become an intolerable burden to-
the industrial classes.
Education, better means of communication,
and the application of a higher intelligence to
their industries, have brought about a corres-
ponding advance in economic science, and the
necessity for improved social conditions has
become so urgent that everywhere we see signs
that irresponsible land ownership must give
place to more equitable conditions, suited to an
entirely different age and an intelligent indus-
trial class.


CHAPTER VI.
The purpose of all law should be to bind com-
munities together in a common union which
must be beneficial to each and all, so that in
pursuing his own advantage each may do so
concurrently with the welfare of the State.
The laws ot a civilized state are economically
divided into ‘ Common Law ’ and ‘ Statute
Law.’ The former is supposed to protect the
* rights ’ of all, the latter to guard the privileges
of those to whom special advantages have been
granted and which must not be inconsistent
with the common good, but which promote
individual effort and reward it with the security
of its own fruits.
The law of land monopoly is a law of privilege
and should aim at linking responsibility and
privilege securely together, so that both may
minister to the commonweal.
The ‘ Fence ’ is the first step in civilization,
for no man will cultivate land until he has
security that he may reap his own harvest,
therefore the secure tenure of land from seed-
time to harvest is the first essential in pro-


moting natural productiveness under artificial
conditions.
The tenure may be extended indefinitely, and
so long as the privilege of holding land is linked
with the responsibility of using it productively,
it is beneficial to the whole community ; so soon,
however, as the responsibility is severed from
the privilege, the severance is certain to lead to
abuse and monopoly of the most disastrous
character, destructive to the welfare of the
State, and oppressive to the People.
Bearing in mind this inevitable and immutable
law, we have endeavoured to sketch out a basis
for the land holding of the future, which may
promote the welfare of all who do justice to
their land, and who in doing this advance the
prosperity of the State, while they enrich
themselves with the fruits of their own industry
and effort.
At the same time our endeavour should
be to destroy, or greatly check, the evils
of land grabbing and speculation which have
been the source of so much misery, ruin and
poverty in the past, enriching the greedy and
unscrupulous few at the cost of the industrious
many.
Our creed should be, justice to all, help to
those who need, and control of those who would
exceed their equitable rights or their acquired
privileges.


The Basis of Land Legislation.
1. In framing a new Land Act it is first
necessary to declare that according to the
fundamental basis of Common Law privilege is
linked with responsibility. Therefore the
privilege of land monopoly cannot lawfully be
severed from the responsibility to use it bene-
ficially in the interests of the State as well as
to enrich the individual.
Any non-use or abuse therefore which is
detrimental to the State is in direct opposition
to the spirit in which all grants of land
monopoly are (or should be) made under the
common law.
2. Where such responsibility has not been
defined or expressed in granting a title to the
land it is implied, together with all other
common and universal State obligations.
3. In order that henceforth all doubt and
difficulty shall be removed as to the conditions
of land tenure ruling in New South Wales, all
those who claim the privilege of land monopoly
shall state their claim clearly and explicitly
and the basis upon which such claim rests.
They shall submit a map or plan of the land
they claim, giving the date and conditions
under which it came into their possession, and
where the title of the present holder is not
direct from the State he shall explain the con-


ditions upon which he purchased, inherited, or
acquired the holding, and support such ex-
planation with a declaration that to the best of
his knowledge and belief such information as to
the origin of the title is true and reliable.
4. The claimant shall then set torth the
nature of any or all improvements which have
been carried out upon the land by direct human
agency, in which he or his predecessors in title
have been the controlling or motive power. He
shall also give an estimate of the cost of such
improvements and their unexhausted present
value.
He may discriminate between any several
portions of the land in his holding, clearly
marking such divisions, their area and extent,
describing the purpose for which each is used,
and placing a value upon the land (apart from
any improvements) in each several portion, such
as in in his judgment he considers fair and
equitable. He shall also state the nature and
present value of the improvements (if any) upon
each portion.
5. Full particulars of all claims and valua-
tions shall be published monthly as they are
received in a special edition ot the Government
Gazette upon the first day of every month. All
claims shall be open to challenge by any citizen
who makes affidavit that in his certain
knowledge such information as is given in


support of any claim is not in accordance with
the facts of the case.
Within one month from the date of such
affidavit the challenger shall submit a statement
of his evidence, documentary or otherwise,
against the title which he challenges, and
support such statement with his affidavit and,
or, the affidavit of his witnesses who must each
be supported by the testimony o± some citizen
of repute, who will declare that to the best of
his knowledge and belief such witness is actings
S? O'
in good faith and is worthy of credence.
Free and undisturbed holding of any area
of land under 200 acres in extent for a
continuous period of not less than seven years,
during which period substantial improvements
have been carried out upon the holding, shall
be deemed to be prima facie ground for claim-
ing a title to the land.
6. Upon the foregoing conditions being com-
plied with, the Court of Petty Sessions for the
district in which any land in dispute is situated,
shall at its next sitting enquire into the case
and send in its report (with or without a
decisive opinion) to the Minister for Lands and
the Minister for Justice.
A copy of the same shall in due course be
laid upon the table of the House and published
in the Government Gazette.


7. Immediately after the expiration of the
first year from the date of passing the foregoing
resolutions, the first volumes of a book to be
called the Doomsday Book of the Land
Tenure of New South Wales,” shall be printed
and published. Each volume shall contain all
the claims made in one Land District up to the
latest possible date, with notes referring to any
challenge of the title, and giving dates and
reference to the pages in the Gazette in which
particulars of such challenge, the hearing of it,
and the decision or report of the Court of
Petty Sessions, may be found. All estates,
the claim to which is sub judice, shall be noted
as such.
8. After the expiration of twelve months
from the date of publication and issue of each
volume, the claim to any unchallenged estate
shall be confirmed, subject only to any action
which may thereafter arise and be prosecuted
in the High Court of Justice. No challenge
shall be admissible through the Court of Petty
Sessions unless instituted within the twelve
months.
9. Copies of each and all volumes of the
Doomsday Book, and all numbers of the special
Gazette , shall be sent to the local Land Board
Court, or office of every district, to every Court
of Petty Sessions, to every Police Magistrate,


and every School of Arts and Public Library
in New South Wales. Access shall be given
to every citizen who is compos mentis and
orderly, so that he may search the books for
any records which he may desire to see, and
make extracts from the same in writing, pro-
vided always that he shall not in any way
misuse, injure, mutilate, or otherwise interfere
with its safe custody.
10. Each volume shall be indexed under the
initials of the surnames of the grantees and
present holders, and also under the names of
the parish or district in which the grant is
situated, each county being kept distinct.
Reference shall also be given against each grant
or claim, to every other grant or claim preferred
by the same individual, or corporate, or incor-
porated holder.
11. An index of areas shall also be given
showing as follows :
[a] Every estate, or holding, or combination
of estates, or holdings, held by one
individual, or corporate, or incorporated
body, which separately, or together shall
be more than 50,000 acres, and the
several and joint area of the same and
the purpose for which it is used.
(5) The same of estates from 50,000 to
20,000 acres in extent as aforesaid.


(c*) The same of 20,000 to 10,000 acres.
(d) „ 10,000 to 5,000 „
(e) „ 5,000 to 1,000 „
(/) „ 1,000 to 500 „
(g) ~ 500 to 200 ~
(h) „ 200 to 50 „
( i ) ~ under 50 acres, of which
less than one-third is under cultivation.
The publication shall commence with the largest
class of estates, (a), and proceed in order of
size down to the smallest estate (i), of which
less than one-third of the area is cultivated.
12. The lands having been thus claimed,
described, and valued by the holders of title or
presumptive title, the holders shall thenceforth
be liable to pay a land tax upon the value of
the land (apart from any improvements which
are due to the holder, or his predecessors in
title).
13. The State shall also have the power to
resume any portion of any grant, or claim, upon
which there are no such improvements (as
named in clause 12), upon compensating the
title holder for fencing at its fair value, and
inscribing his name in the roll of the Consoli-
dated Stockholders of New South Wales, to
the amount of his own valuation of the land,
such consolidated stock to bear interest at such
a rate as may enable it to maintain a mean


value from year to year at not less than an
average of 5 per cent, below par.
14. Resumption may take place under the
following: conditions ;
O
(a) Any area not exceeding 200 acres for
individual holding, upon the applicant
giving substantial testimony as to his
capacity to fulfil the following conditions,
and entering into a bond so to do.
(1.) To cultivate a certain specified area
not less than one-third of the holding,
in one or several modes of cultivation
to be specified, such cultivation to be
in force within a specified time, and to
be maintained to the satisfaction of
the Minister for Lands.
(2.) To erect and carry out certain perma-
nent improvements, the nature and
estimated value of which must be
specified, and the locality indicated,
and in which the applicant, or lessee
will have an absolute and indefeasible
tenant right, until it can be shown
that he has alienated his tenant right
by a legal instrument, duly executed,
and registered in the proper court.
(b) Any area larger than 200 acres which
may be applied for by a corporate, or
incorporated body of citizens, joining
together for mutual and co-operative


land-holding and cultivation, so long ns
the area of land shah not exceed 100
acres to every male adult member of
such body. Every such body shall be
duly registered, with
secretary and manager, or managing
director, who shall be jointly and sever-
ally responsible for carryingout the terms
and conditions upon which the grant is
made ; and who shall be legally respon-
sible for the due performance of every
condition contained in the articles of
their association, or charter of incor-
poration.
<c) Any area which may be required for
national, or municipal purposes, the pur-
pose of which has been approved by
Parliament, or has received the sanction
of the Governor-in-Council.
The valuation ol every area to be resumed
shall be subject to the approval of the
Government valuer.
15. The terms of payment for every grant of
land resumed shall be one pound (£1) per cent,
per annum above the rate of interest at which
the Consolidated Stock of .New South Wales is
or can be issued at, or within 5 per cent, of par.
Thus, while Consolidated Stock bears interest
at 4 per cent, per annum, the rent of any area
resumed and leased for cultivation, or other


beneficial use, under the provisions of this Act,
shall be £5 per cent, per annum upon the
resumption sum; with the addition of such
moderate stamp duties as may be fixed by the
Court to cover the cost of hearing and dealing
with applications in the Court of Petty
Sessions. No charge shall be payable to the
Land Court other than survey fees, which shall
be borne by the title owner in the event of the
resumption being carried out, or by the
applicant in the event of his failure to obtain
the approval of the Court of Petty Sessions
to his application.
.16 The term or period of tenancy shall in
no case exceed 99 years upon the same basis,
but it may be made for any less period, and with
any optional periods of variation, or modification
of any of the conditions which may be set
torth in the application and which the Court of
Petty Sessions may approve and sanction.
17. The certificate of approval and sanction
by the Court of Petty Sessions, endorsed by
the Central Land Court, or its branches and
registered in the National Record Book, shall
be conclusive evidence of title to carry out any
and all of the conditions of the agreement, by
and on behalf of any of the parties to the
agreement or decrees of the Court, and all rent
shall be payable to or at the Court of Petty
Sessions, or other duly constituted official who


may be appointed by the administration, or the
Governor in Council.
18. Absolute and indefeasible tenant right
in all improvements which are the product of
human energy, foresight, or intelligence, shall
be vested in the tenant, as against any who
would outbid him for the tenancy of the land ;
but not against the state or any title owner
into whose hands the leased lands may fall
through the death, or other incapacity, or
default of the tenant to fulfil the obligations
attached to his tenancy.
In such case the state shall stand as trustee
of the late or defaulting tenant, and re-lease his
holding to the highest bidder, and after satisfy-
ing its own claims shall hand over the balance
{if any) of the purchase-money realized by the
sale of the improvements to the executor,
administrator, or assignee of the late tenant’s
estate and interest.
19. In the event of more than one notice of
application being received simultaneously by
the Court of Petty Sessions for the same
holding, such applications shall be decided upon
their merits, and the most beneficial application
have precedence. Where all applications are for
a similar, or equally beneficial use of the land,
the priority shall be decided by ballot.
20. The duration of the tenancy shall always
and in every case be dependent upon the ful-


filment of the conditions of the title, or of such
modifications, or amendments of it as have been
approved, and are endorsed upon it by the
Court of Petty Sessions and registered in the
liecord Books of the National Land Office.
21. No cultivated land of which a beneficial
use is made by the title-owner, or any tenant
holding under him shall in any case be resumed
by the State without the consent of the holder,
unless such resumption be for a National, or
Municipal purpose, or the land tax shall have
been in arrears for 12 months, and is unpaid.
In all such cases the valuation of improvements
shall be by arbitration.
22. The resumption of all, or any lands shall
be based upon the title-holder’s own valuation,
as recorded in the current issue ot Doomsday
Booh, and upon which all taxation has been
duly paid.
23. The State may from time to time declare
that the natural increment in the value of all
lands shall belong to the State, and to the title
owner in any equal, or unequal proportions,
according to the circumstances which may
surround the case, such as where the energy,
enterprise, and ability of the title owner may
have largely contributed lo the increased
prosperity of his district, and the enlargement
of the land value, and the area of cultivation
and improvement.


r 24. Every encouragement shall be given to
the title holders to develop the estates in their
holding to the greatest productive uses, by
obtaining from Parliament the sanction of a
differential land tax, which may not exact so
much from the cultivated lands as from the
uncultivated, and by fixing the difference at
such a proportion as will best promote the-
industry, the welfare, and the wealth of the-
State and the community.


CHAPTER YIL
It is authoritatively stated that at least 50
■million acres of land in New South Wales are
suitable for profitable agriculture, and under
the fertilizing influences of irrigation this area
may be indefinitely extended. All that is
needed is that agricultural development should
go hand in hand with some kindred industry,
by which the intermittent nature of agricultural
work may be supplemented, so that the labourer
may have two strings to his bow, two sources
from whence he may draw profitable employ-
ment, and an intelligent and hearty interest in
life ; then the dull monotony of existence, which
paralyzes the energy, and tempts the labourer
into idleness and intemperance, will give way
before the opportunities for varied industry,
and its consequent comfort and sufficiency.
With the varied conditions of climate, soil,
and natural opportunity which appertain to
the various districts of this country, there must
and should be a variety of industries established,
-each suited to the locality, the climate, and the
natural opportunities prevailing in the district.
We will now take several of the most
important districts of New South Wales giving


statistics of the present land tenure in each'
county, and the cultivation as now existing,
at the same time suggest some lines upon
which a more general prosperity, and a greater
degree of happiness and contentment may be
realized by the masses of the people. This-
more general prosperity would reflect its
sunshine upon the whole community, so that
want should be unknown except through wanton
idleness, and sufficiency should be within the
reach of all who, by intelligent and hearty
industry, seek their own welfare in pursuing the
path which leads to happiness.
The most important district in New South
Wales is the Hunter River Valley. This is
not second even to the metropolitan district
for while the latter is dependent upon the
commerce which results from marketing the
produce of the country districts brought to it
by the railway systems, and returning to those
country districts the supplies by which they
live, its office is mainly distributive, and only
to a very small extent productive. On the
other hand the Newcastle district is productive,
and could be self-sustaining, self-dependent, and
self-reliant; it traffics with the w r orld at large,
supplying the motive force of ocean-going
steamers, the life-blood of the commerce of the
world. The Hunter district has the natural
elements of abundant wealth and great pros-


perity, which might well be the envy of the
world, and which if wisely developed are capable
-of infinite extension. Hitherto under the short-
sighted and arbitrary rule of the monopolist,
and the equally short-sighted action of labour
agitators, who live upon the struggles and
-distress of the less intelligent workers, this
splendid district has been for years the battle-
field on which a civil war has been waged with
great and unnecessary bitterness, between two
sections of the community whose interests are
really identical, whose object should be a
common prosperity, and whose duty it is each
to study the other’s interest if it would realize
its own.
Where, then, does the cause of this calamity
lie ? Surely the root of it is in those unnatural
land laws which give privilege without respon-
sibility, and which the landholder treats as an
unconditioned and inalienable right to either
use, non-use, or abuse, the splendid opportunities
of Nature which are entrusted to him by the
title deeds of his holdings.
No more striking illustration of the inequit-
able system of our land tenure and its disastrous
results can be found anywhere in New South
Wales than in the four counties of North-
umberland, Durham, Hunter and Cook, for
here, if anywhere upon the earth, nature’s


bounty is displayed strewn around with lavish
hand. In spite of this a large proportion of
the real industrial class is idle and on the
borderland of destitution. Why then should
this be so ?
In the first place the surface of the land is
rich and fertile, the soil is deep ; the climate is
favourable to every kind of vegetation ; warm
sunshine and plenty of moisture lend their
inspiring influences to make the land bring
forth her increase, wherever the hand of man.
is busily employed in close embrace with
nature, who in responsive sympathy displays
her bounteous fecundity.
Every flower, fruit, and cereal crop which
Southern Europe can produce may here be
grown in full perfection, yet the cultivation is
so limited that only one acre in every hundred
is under crop. The remaining 99 are left
untilled, and the rich resources of the country
undeveloped.
Underneath the soil the coal deposits form
an inexhaustible mine of wealth, which, com-
bined with the productive surface capability,
should place this district well amongst the
richest and most prosperous in the world.
A fine harbour, a navigable river running
through many miles of rich and easily access-
ible country, affords communication with the
whole world across the seas, and every vessel


■coming to the port for coal, as ballast, fuel or
merchandise, would gladly take all kinds of
produce for consumption or exchange, in what-
ever quantities such produce cound be found
available for the purpose. In spite of this the
district does not grow enough to feed its native
population, and with all its rich resources
cannot find its people work or bread.
The hand of the monopolist has bound down
nature’s willingness and fenced her in behind
the steel barbed wire of irresponsible land
tenure. These fertile valleys and gently-
sloping hills are held by men whose title deeds
confer a privilege upon them which monarchs
well might envy, and for the abuse of less than
which monarchs have lost their thrones and
lives.
These lands their holders ruthlessly neglect,
and under this neglect the country languishes ;
while men and children all but starve in help-
less and unwilling idleness; outcasts from the land
whosebursting bosom wells with milk and honey,
fenced off, alas, from those who thirst and hunger
for the same, and who would gladly spend their
lives in drawing forth this bounty, were it not
that everywhere monopolist conditions oppress
each industry with rent and usury beyond
endurance and utterly intolerable.

There are about 140 miles of railway in theso

There thus remains 1,764,745 acres of free-
hold land uncultivated, while there are 28,240
landless male adults, thousands of whom are
seeking work without success. At the same
time the market gardens only cover 460 acres, and
produce £12,190 worth of small fruits and table
vegetables, to supply a population of 118,832
men, women and children, or less than one
halfpenny per week for each individual, or one
acre to every 280 souls. The supply of market
vegetables might easily be increased twentyfold
with great advantage to the health, vigour, and
happiness of the whole population, and to the
great reduction of intemperance and crime.
If only 5000 men had 10,000 acres between
them for spade culture in small garden allot-
ments or co-operative holding, they then could
each employ two or three days a week in
garden work, alternating it with three or four


days a week down in the mines. The benefit of
this upon their health, their happiness and
wealth, would soon display itself in a grand
object lesson which should bring many followers.
At present the average value of all the
produce of the uncultivated lands in New
South Wales is fifteen pence per acre every
year. Compare this value with the £2l per
acre for the five specified crops of fruits and
vegetables, and bear in mind that pastoral
occupation only employs one person to every
3900 acres of land, and cultivation employs one
person to every seven acres. Then we see
how vast the loss is to the community in
fencing these poor people off the land which
yearns for their attention, and would repay
them richly for their labour.
What then is the cure for these intolerable
evils of land monopoly and land neglect ?
Only to link again responsibility with
privilege as in the days when private holding
had its origin and birth. In ancient days the
right to all uncultivated land was held in
eommon by the people, and the people
through their rulers and the Councils granted
the use of land to any who would cultivate, so
that he who tills the land may rest secure that
when the harvest time arrives he may receive
the fruits of his own industry.


Every tenure of land should be dependent on
the rightful use of all such privileges as are
granted in the title, while all the land unculti-
vated or unimproved by those who own the title
should be available for any who desire to cultivate
it, at such a rental as the demand would j ustify,
when all uncultivated lands in every district
are unrestrictedly available for this purpose.
Then only may we see prosperity again in
New South Wales. Then will our markets
yield a plentiful supply of wholesome native
food for home consumption, and a handsome
surplus, which we may export to other countries
whose land is not so blessed by nature’s
bounteous hand as ours.
Then none need beg, or starve, or steal,
except the worthless and incorrigible, who soon
would be detected and made to work under
prison discipline. This would be equity,
prosperity, and justice joined in one. Then
might this fertile land again become the home
of happiness, contentment, and permanent
prosperity; then could we shout aloud with
one accord, “ Advance Australia ! ”
At present out of the 5,250,000 acres of uncul-
tivated land in the four counties of the Hunter
District, there are only* 3,762 acres available
for selection (with residential conditions.) i
* See ‘‘Measured Lands open to Conditional Purchase in New
South Wales,” published for the Department of Lands, 28 Aug.,
1893.


These 3,762 acres are worthless lands, des-
cribed as follows : “ steep ridges,” “ stony
ridges,” “ sandy flats,” “ gravel, no water,”
“reedy swamp,” &c., and the localities are thus
indicated : 30 miles from Singleton, 40 miles
from Clarence Town, and similar inaccessible
situations. Is it any wonder that the workless
people do not go on the land, when, for twenty-
eight thousand landless male adults, the whole
available area which their government offers
them out of the three and a half million acres
of Crown lands is less than half a rood apiece
of sterile land, at inaccessible distances from
their homes, and even then so poor and valueless
that it would either kill a man with swamp
malaria in a week, or of a broken heart in three
short months when he found out the hopelessness
of cultivating such a desert waste, out of the
reach of human fellowship, or any market for
his produce.
In the following tables the holdings of land
are classified as follows :
1. Holdings of more than 10,000 acres each.
2. Holdings of from 10,0C0 to 1,000 acres.
3. Holdings of from 1,000 to 300 acres.
4. Holdings of from 300 to 30 acres.
5. Holdings of 3u acres and under.
O
And in every case it will be seen that the hold-
ings under 300 acres are conspicuous for the
amount of cultivation.

In this county, also, there is plenty of scope
for agriculture and dairying, poultry and bee
farms, vineyards and orchards. Much of the
land is believed to be gold-bearing ; there is
iron in abundance, and traces of other minerals
are to be found upon the surface, while in some
parts silk could be profitably grown, as the
mulberry flourishes well.

Oh ! fortunate Clarence ; the largest holder
in your county owns less than 5,000 acres.
Here was no field for railway enterprise, and,
consequently, you had no charm for the political
adventurer ! You are well rid of him.
Maize, sugar, wine, and a great variety of
fruits can be profitably grown in this county,
while dairy produce could be largely increased.
This is a district which offers great opportunities
to the small cultivator, for much of the soil is
very rich, and the climate favorable to vegeta-
tion.

In this district the increase in the selling
price of freehold land, in consequence of the ex-
tension of the railway to Shoalhaven, clearly
indicates who gets the benefit of the national
expenditure upon railways. The application of
the betterment system here would bring a large
revenue to the State and more than cover the
cost of the railway.

the Murrumbidgee, and has the advantage of a
good railway running through it, no serious
attempt has been made in the way of cultiva-

excellent agricultural returns. This is hardly
surprising when we see that five holders own
nearly nine-tenths of the freehold land, only
cultivating one acre in 10,000.

that could be made profitable, if, by legislation,
it could be made available for cultivation upon
equitable terms.


CHAPTER VIII.
In the previous chapter we dealt with all the
leading centres of industrial and agricultural
O O
population, giving the authorized statistics for
each county, dividing the male adult popula-
tion into six classes, viz.,
Persons. Acres.

114,612 Total male adult population of the 32
counties
We will now make a summary of these
statistics in four classes in order more
prominently to bring out the leading features
of the truths which we desire to teach, namely,
that there is- no other means by which a nation
can be prosperous, except by giving all its
people equal facilities to go upon the fertile
lands, and cultivate them for their own benefit
and the welfare of the state.
We take the coastal district first, for here we
find the largest population and the greatest

natural facilities for cultivation and communi-
cation. The rainfall all along the coast is
frequent and abundant; the climate promotes
the rapid growth of all the fruits of earth’s full
bounty in rich luxuriance : so here, if anywhere
in New South Wales, there is a sphere of rich
reward for active energy, and wise intelligent
industry, and a population of many millions
could find a home and plentiful prosperity upon
these lands, if only they might eat the fruit of
their own labour, instead of giving more than
half to the monopolist owner of the land, or
sinking all their capital in its purchase.
In these 12 coastal counties, we find that 30
holders claim to ‘ own ’ 1,313,749 acres of land,
and show their gratitude to the generous people
who granted this monopoly, by cultivating one
acre in 800, leaving the remaining 799 in sterile
idleness, surrounded by a fence which marks
their absolute control, and makes it trespass for
any landless man to even pitch his tent thereon,
to pick a fern or wuld flower, or to shoot a
a wallaby or native bear. And having given
less than £1 per acre for the land they ask
—what do they ask for it ? In many cases
the land was sacrificed at auction for less than
it cost to survey and transfer, as we will now
proceed to show :
In 1876, 2,062,138 acres were sold uncon-
ditionally, and the total amount realized from


all sources of laud sale and revenue by the
Treasury during the year was £2,773,003. Of
this sum £664,216 was paid in deposit upon
conditional purchase other than the 2.062,138
acres now under consideration, while the rent
for pastoral occupation, mining occupation, and
miscellaneous land receipts, would probably
total another half million (in 1890 these items
amounted to £1,624,000), We find that the
auctions only realized £1,659,523 to pay for the
2,062,138 acres, or 16s. per acre all round, not-
withstanding the fact that there were large
sales of town and suburban lands, which realized
many pounds per acre, and which are included
in the total sum.
The price the owners ask from any who
desire to buy these wasted lands and use them
beneficially is known to those who take an
interest in the land of their own locality.
Suffice it therefore to say here that the official
estimated valuation of the 41 million acres of
freehold land is over £5 per acre as an average,
while the purchase money of the whole averaged
little more than 15s. per acre.
From a very valuable pamphlet on “ Our
Land Laws,” published in 1882, by W. B.
Christie, Licensed Surveyor, M. 8.5., M. 1.5.,
&c., (reprinted from the Newcastle Herald ) we
extract the following paragraphs :


Our total “ revenue ” from the lands since 1861 (to
1880) has been £20,802,845, and our expenditure
(which the Treasurer’s statement says is fairly charge-
able thereon) has been £22,204,022, or £1,401,176-
more than we have received, while we have contracted
a public debt of £17,000,000, besides authorising fur-
ther loans to the extent of £8,762,500.
Of our total land “ revenue ” under the present Act
we have received £3,385,299 as deposits on conditional
purchases, but the cost of survey and Lands Depart-
ment have amounted to £3,700,758.
The annual land “ revenue ” for 1880 was £469,049,
but the survey and Lands Department cost during-
that year £349,899, and the Mines Department a fur-
ther sum of £77,011, or a total of £426,910 for the-
collection of a “ revenue ” of £469,049, which includes
total land “ revenue ” and all “ revenue ” derived from
the mining industry of the colony.
What comment can we make upon these
damning evidences of corruption and incompe-
tence against past governments ? May we not
emphasize the words of an earlier chapter,
wherein, speaking of the alienation of land, and
what it realised, we said, “ Sold, did we say ?
no, they practically gave the land away and
only sold the people 1” If the country had
been ruled by an alien despot, it would have
been a strange policy thus to alienate the land
without conditions for beneficial use ; but this
is the result of that self-government which,
thirty years ago, the people thirsted for with
such impatience. The draught of legislation.


which quenched that thirst has had a poisonous
effect upon the masses, robbing them of their
birthright, and creating similar disastrous con-
ditions of land monopoly to those which are
the source of so much poverty and hardship to
the toilers in the older countries of the world.
We next consider the statistics of the Eastern
Table Land. Here are the “ wheat lands of
the colony, and here railway communication
affords the means of marketing the agricultural
produce. The men who voted for the railways
were doubtless those who own the land within
a 20 mile area an either side the track.
Here is a rule of three sum, or a puzzle, for
you reader, and all the “ people ” to work out.
If A = the administration who arranged for
the railways, and B = the big landowner who
benefitted by them, and C = the crowd who
spent their labour in creating them, and who
now have got to pay for them—Find the value
of X which equals the sum of that Xcellent
honesty and integrity which the administration
possessed individually and collectively, in those
days of the now historic past, which lie between
the years 1861 and 1893?
The reader having finished this sum, and
found a satisfactory answer, we will leave him
to go out into some clear space and ease his
mind of those bad words which naturally arise
in honest men’s hearts when they meet with

-deep-dyed villiany in high places ; and then per-
haps a draught of something cool and soothing
may enable him to follow on with our “lesson
in economics.”
We find the large landholder here is quite a
busy man, or rather quite a busy little crowd
of 110 men ; they positively cultivate one acre
in every 348, out of the more than million
acres held by them, so that practically they
only waste a trifle of 2,015,000 acres in sterile
unproductiveness; while they cultivate 7,548
.acres of these glorious wheat lands, with roads
and railways all provided at the “ national
expense.” Henceforward let true justice, (not
false law) control our dealings, and where
a privilege is granted, let us know the terms
and see them carried out, and where no sub-
stantial claim for privilege can be established,
let us destroy the fence and thus regain our
common rights.

Our next consideration will be the Central
Lands, where the Daily Telegraph is so im-
patient to achieve the alienation of further
-crown lands, because the sapient writer of its
leaders thinks that quite a little slice of these
rich lands could feed the half of England.
Certainly they could! But would they ? We
have already 40 million acres alienated in the
colony, and if the half of this were used for
growing wheat (and more than half is capable

Every one of the above counties is noted
for its splendid
agricultural land, and is pro’s

communication to the metropolis.


of doing it), we could grow 260,000,000 bushels,
without touching a single acre more of our less
fertile crown lands ; which might for generations
be devoted to pastoral pursuits. At present,
however, our crop of wheat (in 1891) is a trifle
under 4,000,000 bushels, so there is plenty of
scope to develop wheat growing, without
alienating any more land for this purpose.
Upon these centra] plains 114 big landholders
claim to own 4,878,582 acres, of which they
cultivate 12,230 ; leaving 4,866,350 acres in
practically the same condition as when Captain
Cook arrived upon these shores ; except that
then they supported a few more black men and
women, and a great many more kangaroos,
wallabies and emus. We have removed all these
encumbrances, and put a few sheep in then-
place. They pay the territorial holder a tribute
for their undisturbed possession of the soil,
which is placed at their absolute disposal; the
only element in the bargain which they have
the slightest cause for grumbling at is that he
sometimes distrains upon their furniture, for
rent, too early in the year, before they are
quite ready for him ; and then they are most
miserable for a week or two, when biting winds
blow cold across the plains ; and although there
is an abundant water supply, he does not save
it for their use, but lets it run to waste during
wet weather, and when the sun is hot, and all


the grass is dry and brittle, they have to jog
along as best they can without it, till starved
with thirst, they die of sheer exhaustion by the
thousand.
The oldest, truest book in all the world tells
us that one of the great patriarchs said (and
he believed it) : “ The heaven is the Lord’s,
and the earth hath He given to the children of
men,” This w T as not, surely, meant to apply to
New South Wales, or he would probably have
put it thus : “ The greater part of all the earth
hath He given to the children of 642 men, and
60,000,000 sheep,” leaving the rest to do the
best they can outside the fence. For wdiile
these same 60,000,000 sheep have just three
acres each, with undisturbed possession during
the intervals between the visits of the shearer
and the butcher, there are 257,000 men in New
South Wales, who, with their wives and children,
make up a population of about 900,000 souls,
who have not land enough to dig their graves
in so that when they die they may bury one
another decently.
Alas ! alas ! alas ! that this should be so.
Let not this cruel century close until the men
of New South Wales have altered all these
grasping land laws, that have so cursed the
country and the people ; and let us see kind
Justice placed upon the judgment seat, holding
the scales of equity in perfect equipoise; and

We have left the Metropolitan Area for our
last consideration, because the cruellest wrongs
of all are perpetrated here, within the sound of
those great bells which ring out hour by hour,
and chime the quarters, from tire tall tower of
Sydney’s Post Office, in the heart of New South
Wales’ capital.
Yes, here is the cruellest wrong of all ; for
thousands of the working classes have neither
work nor homes, and thousands more who toil
all day for wages which can barely feed and
clothe them, and their little ones are housed
worse than the stalled ox, and far worse fed.
The greed of land rapacity has left no breathing
space between the dens which take the place of
homes for these poor outcasts ; and a life of
crime and misery is the only outcome possible
for those unwelcomed and sad-visaged infants,
who draw their first breath poisoned and
polluted with the stain of vice and wretchedness,
so that even the bright beams of sunshine only
putrefy the festering sores, instead of healing
them. These wretched dens are so impure, it
is not meet the glorious sun should gaze upon
them, lest even he should blush with shame
and grief at the sad sight, and his lustre should
be dimmed hereafter.
These are the homes of night, and these the
sons of darkness who dwell in them, and make


even black night hideous with their ghastly
revels.
All this is done by private ownership of land
without conditions for beneficial use ; and all
this might be cured ; nay, must be cured ! ay,
shall be cured ! if God will help the right, as
He hath ever done, when brave men strive to
overcome the powers of evil, avarice and greed,
which have too long been rampant o’er the
land.
Take heart of hope, ye people ; and they who
hitherto have borne the cross shall live to wear
the crown which great Marcellus promised long
ago to those who faithfully fulfil their duty to
their fellow-men, and love their country.


CHAPTER IX.
How can we settle people on the land, so
that their lives may possess that happiness and
satisfaction which all have a right to look for-
ward to in a fertile and well-governed country?
This is a problem which our statesmen have
to solve; and they should be ashamed to let
hard-working and resolute men leaves our shores
in ship-loads to seek a home in foreign lands
because life has become intolerable here.
Let us build a new Australia upon the ashes
left by the fraudulent, political, and financial
adventurer of the past.
Behind the political doctrines of Protection
and Freetrade there are two underlying truths
apparently in opposition to one another, yet
both are in harmony with natural law when
rightly understood, and taken with this proviso
that they are each only applicable to a particular
stage in industrial progress and development —
just as Nature is protective of infant organisms
and of the forms of life which are capable of
the highest develojjrnent her period of protec-
tion is most extended, so in all cases the law
of free competition comes into play at maturity.


lii like manner must we watch over and
protect those industries which are suited to our
soil, our climate, and our people, and for which
a prosperous and independent future may be
reasonably expected when once they have taken
firm root in the country.
Providence has given us the richest natural
advantages that any country was ever yet
blessed with. For the development of our
resources there is settled already a race recruited
from a nation whose history fills the world with
wonder and admiration ; a race which has for
centuries been foremost in colonization, and
which is consolidating her empire even in these
seas, despite the incapacity of our political
leaders.
Need we fear that New South Wales will be
a laggard in the work. Let her shake off the
sloth of half a century, bred in her veins by
that great malaria—gold hunger—which makes
work impossible, and let us find an antidote
for the poison of insidious flattery which has
taught us to borrow, not to work, to spend,
not to save, and when the time comes to repay,
suggests a possible repudiation.
What is the industry which claims our first
attention ? Surely our wool will best repay
enquiry, so that we may find a method to make
its profit greater to the country and the people..


Why cannot we prepare the wool for manu-
facture, so that scoured of its native dirt and
grease, and sorted into its grades of varied
quality and fineness, it may on leaving us go
straight into the spinners’ hands fit for the
manufacture of useful fabrics. Why should
one ship in three take dirt and grease instead
of wool to Europe ? —cleansed of this dirt and
grease one-third of all the stowage would be
saved, and more than half the risk of fire
avoided. All the delay and labour which now
is necessary to prepare it for the spinners
might then be saved, giving our rising l genera-
070 O o O
tion a healthy and expanding industry, which
in time would fit them to manufacture textile
fabrics for the world at large, making a village
industry where the wool is grown, and making
fj O 7 O
this fit in with agriculture, so that the inter-
mittent character of each should balance one
another.
This is an industry in which there is a future,
so vast, widespread, and profitable, that it alone
could find employment for every idle pair of
hands within the colony; and withal so advan-
tageous that it would add at least another id.
per lb. to the value of the wool for him who
grows it, and give our working population the
profit now made by the European wool stapler,
whose occupation is so profitable that every
year he makes a journey round the world to


buy our greasy wool and hardly notices washed
fleeces and the scoured offal, which is our poor
attempt at “stapling.”
No ! if we would cultivate a trade in “wool,”
we must take the business seriously in hand —
not play at it. The game is worth the candle,
but the candle will not light itself; and,
moreover, we must protect it, so that the angry
gusts of interested windy opposition may not
blow it out before it settles down to burn a
steady flame and cast a shining light over all
the land.
Yes, protection of an industry like this would
profit any wise financier and administrator who
proposes it, but it will not do to fix a tariff and
then leave it! We must adopt a system and
carry it persistently until its full develop-
ment is safe and certain.
Our first step must be to fix an export duty
of one-eighth of a penny per lb, on greasy wool
of every kind that is shipped at any port in
New South Wales. The product of this duty
must be entirely devoted to the establishment
of experimental and practical wool stapling
works at half a dozen or more suitable localities
where wool arrives in large quantities for early
delivery,say Narrabri, Bourke, Nyngan, Young,
Cowra, Narrandera, Dubbo, and Wagga.


The receipts of wool at fifteen railway stations
were in 1892-1893 :

345,544
Taking these bales at, say, 4501b5. each, we
have, roughly speaking, about 155,000,0001b5.
of wool available at these fifteen centres of rail
loading. If we take power to intercept this
wool and treat it at about Id. per lb. for scour-
ing and grading, here is a wage fund of
£575,000, which should be largely recouped in
the reduction of railway and shipping freight,
for one-third of the weight and bulk would be
deducted and the risk of fire would be enor-
mously reduced.


At present the railway rate for scoured wool
is about 28 per cent.* higher than the rate for
greasy. This is a direct discouragement of
country industry, like many other of the traffic
rates, which, under a more intelligent adminis-
tration, might soon be rectified.
At these fifteen railway stations considerably
more than one-third of the entire wool produce
of the colony is loaded on rails, and, although
it may be argued that “washed” wool does not
realise a price commensurate with the cost of
washing, this is on account of the fact that
most of the washed wool is treated with cold
water, which does not remove the “ yolk,” and
consequently it requires to be scoured again
before it is suitable for manufacture into woollen
fabrics. It is in fact only half done, and, unless
the work is systematically organised and
efficiently carried out it is both unprofitable and
useless.
Tliis would not be the case if competent
experts were employed to carry out the work
in the same manner as it is done in the maim-
factoring countries, and graded into at least
O 7 O
twenty different qualities, each with its own
reliable brand, so that the manufacturing con-
sumers could with confidence buy the exact
grade required in their industry in fit condition
for spinning and weaving.


The yolk itself is one of the most valuable
natural products ; it is a grease of the very finest
quality, possessing a healing character in a
very high degree. It is in great demand as
the basis of all medicated ointments and skin
emolients. This alone would be a large source
of revenue to a perfectly equipped scouring
works.
Then the effluent water would make a perfect
fertilizer for irrigating purposes, and a farm of
several hundred acres could be carried on with
the most beneficial results in these back country
districts, where sunshine is abundant and
moisture only is deficient. Crops of highest
qualityand abundance could be raised without the
slightest upon small and carefully
tilled areas by the same hands that scour the
wool, giving variety to their occupation, and
these works would form a valuable agricultural
training for all who spend a year in such
employment. Every unemployed member of
the community could be made a useful citizen
in a short space of time ; the work would not
be arduous, and the reward would be so ample
that in the near future it would become a
staple industry of the country.
Peaches, apricots, plums, and other fruits
■ could be grown for drying, and grapes for
raisins, as well as garden produce to supply the


wants of the locality, where at present vegetable-
culture is in the hands of Chinamen. The
dearth of fresh vegetables is one of the greatest
privations in the arid districts of New South
Wales, and is undoubtedly a most prolific source
ot intemperance and disease.
Under the same control and organization,
sheep and cattle could be slaughtered and
chilled for home consumption and export trade.
The fat could be boiled down for soap and
tallow. Large quantities of soap are essential
to the wool-washing, and pure soap-washed
wool would, after drying in our brilliant sun-
shine, possess a lustre which cannot be obtained
by chemical and hot air processes in the scour-
ing works of Bermondsey or Bradford.
Then all the skins of animals slaughtered
should be immediately placed in tan pits and
dealt with upon the most approved and scientific
principles. We have abundant tan-producing
barks among the wattles and several other
trees, whose commercial tannic properties have
hitherto remained unrecognised.
The chief inferiority of colonial hides is due
to their partial decomposition before treatment;
the putrefactive gasses generate with great
rapidity in our hot climate, and, when putre-
factive has once arisen, the leather must
inevitably be inferior. Within an hour of


'skinning every beast, the hide should be placed
in the tan pit. If this were done our leather
would command the highest price upon the
European markets. The skins are of closer,
finer texture than the beasts reared in colder
climates and under more domesticated con-
ditions. Our beasts are grown with all the
full vitality of “wild” animals. Their skin is
sleek and tough and supple, and the leather
would undoubtedly take the highest rank of
any in the world if properly prepared.
All that is needed is an export duty on greasy
wool of -g-th of a penny per lb. for any leaving
the ports of New South Wales, and for any
passing into a neighbouring colony. Also
per lb. on all hides and skins shipped
untanned.
This would give employment to a vast army
of mechanics, who would soon equal in skill the
tanners and curriers of Bordeaux and Ber-
mondsey. And as our children leave the
national schools, any who cannot find employ-
ment in the ordinary avocations of life, which
now are so alarmingly overcrowded, could find
a sphere of useful work and profitable living at
any township where the wool, the leather, the
meat, and boiling down industries are carried
on, learning as well the mysteries of garden
and irrigation.


Few in Australia know the wonderful possi-
bilities of intense culture, when abundant
warmth and ample moisture is available.
Not many years ago the writer visited a
market garden not far from Paris (it was one of
many of similar productiveness); it consisted of
acres of land, which, not a century ago, was
regarded as amongst the poorest land in Europe.
The breaking up of large estates under the
French Revolution taught the people that every
land is poor where man is not, and every land
can be enriched immeasurably by his attention,
skill, and perseverance. Under the large land-
holder this was forest land, too poor to feed a
sheep upon two acres, so it was given up to
deer and wild partridges, now acres of this
self-same land produces annually garden crops
which realise over £l2OO per acre in the year.
The reader, doubtless, will exclaim this is a
fairy tale! Yes, doubtless, it is, and the fairy
who can conjure up such miracles of fruitful-
ness from cold and barren sterile land is
Industry, Intelligence, and Sympathy, that
trinity of perfect manhood which would make
this world a paradise and every man a noble-
man.
We are satisfied to obtain a crop of 15d. per
acre from 190,000,000 acres of pastoral lands!
We are satisfied that 750,000 acres of cereals
and grasses shall bring us in an average of


£4 ss. per acre, and 80,000 acres of fruits and
market garden produce shall realise £l7 per
acre!
The Frenchman gets £l2OO per acre out of
selling asparagus at 6d. per bundle in Paris
market ! #
More than twenty-one centuries ago Marcellus
ruled in Pome ; a second time the people had
with one accord proclaimed him Consul, and to
celebrate the honour thus conferred upon him,
he desired to build a temple to the “ principle ”
which underlies a nation’s welfare, so that all
could worship and appreciate the beneficial
influence of that principle and cultivate it in
their hearts and homes.
He built the temple and he kept the secret
of its dedication until all was finished ; and on
a public feast day the people all assemble to do
homage to the goddess whom he would that
day proclaim the patroness of Rome and of her
ruler.
The people came with much rejoicing, know-
ing well their consul was a wise and prudent
man, and hoping much the goddess would be
one whom they could worship without great
self denial ; for there men in those days also
who w T ould rather get a favour up the back
stairs than work diligently and honestly for it.
* See Appendix.


Now, when the trumpets sounded and the
temple doors were open, they found to their
surprise the goddess they had pledged them-
selves to worship was only “ Virtue.”
They did not care particularly for “ Virtue,”
and did not want to spend their lives in worship-
ing her! Some wanted “ War,” with all its
passion and excitement; some wanted “ Love,”
with its emotional abandonment; some wanted
“Wealth,” some “Honour,” and some
“ Pleasure.”
Marcellus thought again, and told them that,
to meet their wishes, he would build another
temple and dedicate the same to “Honour.”
This greatly pleased the people, who all desired
to be considered “ honourable men,” and most
men thought they were entitled to it (from
those who did not know their faults).
Then Marcellus fenced in a piece of ground
adjoining Virtue’s Temple, and kept the plans
a secret, so that none should know the beauty
or the value of the temple until all was finished.
So when the work was done the summer
solstice had come round again, and on the
longest day in all the year, when the almighty
and life-giving sun had reached his greatest
splendour, the trumpets sounded once again.
Then great Marcellus had the fence pulled down


and all the people flocked around to find the
entrance.
Not an opening or door of any kind was to
be seen, although they searched with diligence,
and tried the walls lest any secret entrance
should escape their notice. At last they gave
up searching, and came with downcast looks
and angry frowns to their great consul, and
asked him to explain the mystery.
Then he rose up in majesty and said—you
desired me to build a temple, and I built
one to the principle which makes a nation
honourable and great, and this I would that all
my people worship. You know I value honour
no less highly than I value virtue. In the
second temple I have placed the crown of
honour ; ’tis a crown of myrtle leaves, which
none may wear who do not worship “ Virtue.”
Thus Virtue’s Temple is the porch way to that
other court where I will crown her votaries.
All whose virtue is untarnished may enter in,
and there receive the crown and wear it till the
lustre of their virtue fades. There is no other
entrance to the Temple ; and while I live and
rule there never shall be !
He finished speaking, and a great calm fell
upon the people at his noble words; but some
were disappointed, and went away with down-
cast looks and envy in their hearts.


Let us erect a Temple, where the crown of
“ privilege ” may be bestowed right freely upon
all who enter by the porchway which alone
admits those who can give the countersign of
well-fulfilled responsibility—let none others
wear this crown, and we shall find the nation
prosperous and happy.


CHAPTER X.
One of the most desirable and pressing reforms
in relation to our national finances is the
establishment of a National Bank to direct and
control the issue of paper currency, and carry
out the details of National Revenue and
Expenditure outside the pale of political
influence, and upon non-party lines.
It alone should be entitled to issue bank
notes, and it should hold a store of the precious
metals to give stability to its note issue. It
should be under the direction of the most com-
petent actuaries and financiers that the country
can produce, and it should publish a weekly
statement of the national revenue and expendi-
ture. It should be responsible for seeing that
every payment made is in accordance with the
proper authorization, and that such authoriza-
tion bears the signature of the official whose
duty it is to pass orders for payments on behalf
of his department.
It should have the management of the Con-
solidated Fund, and arrange for placing any
loan upon the market. It should be competent
to carry out the ordinary duties and functions


ot a bank, but not including the discounting of
bills, or granting overdrafts.
It should receive cash on deposit, or for
investment in consols, and the rate of interest
for cash on fixed deposit should be one per cent,
below the rate of interest payable upon con-
solidated stock.
It should be authorized to make advances to
the occupiers of land upon their fixed and per-
manent improvements, to the extent of not
more than half their ascertained present value,
at ‘5 per cent, per annum ; and it should
conduct and transact all financial operations in
connection with the resumption of uncultivated
and unimproved land for the purposes of culti-
vation, improvement, or other beneficial use.
It should have power to hold funds in trust,
and invest them in the consolidated stock of the
country, on behalf of all estates left in tiust;
and an Act should be passed making all trustees
liable for any loss incurred by their wards
through the investment of any trust funds in
any securities other than the Consolidated
Fund of New South Wales.
The stability which would accrue to the
financial institutions of the country, through
the reliance which they could place upon the
security of a strong and well-regulated National
Treasury and bullion store, could not fail to
increase the prosperity of the private banks, so


Jong as they confine their operations to healthy
and legitimate banking. The Private Trust
Funds of the Colony are capable of being used
for the national benefit, and should be subject
to clearly defined conditions of investment. In
the United Kingdom any funds left in trust, for
which special provision has not been made by the
testator, must be invested in approved trust
securities, amongst which the Consolidated
Fund stands pre-eminent. It is this which
gives the stability to the National Stocks, and the
most absolute security to the wards, as well as
freedom from responsibility to the trustee who
thus invests his trust funds.
Why should not we establish the same bene-
ficial law which prevails in England in regard
to every trust deed executed in New South
Wales? Every nation has the right to dictate in
what manner the trust funds of its subjects
shall be held; and many a Trust Fraud, and
its consequent calamitous results, would be
avoided by such action on the part of the State
in the interests of its minors.
The National Bank should be empowered to
make advances for co-operative industrial works
and mining industries, to the extent of not
more than one-half of the visible value of the
plant and property of such co-operative associa-
tion, upon the condition that a definite and
approved percentage of its net earnings be


appropriated to a sinking fund for the cancella-
tion of such advance ; and in no case should the
interest upon such advances exceed one per
cent, beyond the rate of interest payable upon
the consolidated fund. By this means any
legitimate and well-organized industrial enter-
prise could gain the accommodation which its
sound and substantial position entitles it to ;
and a great check would be placed upon bogus
and unsubstantial speculations, which have
created the infamous fortunes of the adventurer,
to the loss and misfortune of the too-confiding
and unsuspecting members of the community.
The National Bank should be competent to
officially audit the accounts of any trustee, or
duly registered joint stock company or co-
operative association, and its certificate of
accuracy should be held as a discharge from
responsibility for the directors of any such
company, and except in the case of provable
fraud, it should exempt such directors from any
action which might arise from any error in such
accounts.
It should be entitled to issue consolidated
stock at par to every applicant in exchange for
gold, and its capital account should discriminate
between its consolidated stock funds and its
note issue funds.
Four entirely separate departments should
be maintained at the central bank, each hide-


pendent of the others in the details of its
working, but all under the control of its board
of governors.
1. The Consolidated Fund Branch.
2. The National Treasury Branch.
3. The Note Issue Branch,
4. The Banking Branch.
The office of Colonial Treasurer should be
abolished, and the appointment should be that
of Minister ot Finance, whose functions should
include the financial policy of the country, but
who would have no duties in connection with
the administrative details of the public purse.
The Finance Minister could then be really the
Prime Minister, directing the policy of the
country, without neglecting duties now apper-
taining to the office of Colonial Treasurer, and
without, on the other hand, being so over-
burdened with administrative work as to
overtax the energies of the most indomitable
and conscientious politician.
Every Ministerial department would also be
relieved of .much of its present financial duties
and anxieties ; and a greater attention could be
given to questions of pure policy and adminis-
trative control.
The Minister of Lands should also be Minister
for Agriculture, which is really the most
momentous branch of land administration.


At present the agricultural interests of the*
country are entrusted to a minister, whose-
under-secretary, in preparing the ministerial
report for 1892, has so utterly and entirely
ignored this branch of his chiefs responsible
duties, that no single allusion is made to agri-
culture in the whole of the 190 pages of his
report, which bears in the remotest possible
manner upon this industry, which, in every
civilized country in the world, overshadows
every other in its important bearing upon the
welfare of the country.
Well may agriculture languish in a country
where it is thus ignored by its responsible
ministry; and keenly should the agricultural
community resent such treatment at the hands
of its Government.
One hundred and ninety pages are devoted
to mining, while not a word to agriculture.
Mining is the field of gambling speculation,
and the grave of the dead hopes of those who<
haste after riches. Agriculture is the bread of
life to the community, without which the-
pursuit of every other form of industry becomes
imposible ; but since it affords no field for hasty
fortune-making, it has no interest for the-
political adventurer.
The Minister for Mines should rightly be a
Minister for Miners, to watch over and protect


their interest while in the bowels of the earth
they arduously pursue their difficult and dan-
gerous calling ; with these responsibilities he
might incorporate the interests of other arduous
and dangerous industries, and use a wise and
moderating hand to minimize the constantly
recurring strife between employers and em-
ployed, preventing foolish and disastrous strikes
►and calamitous lock-outs.
Surely capital and labour are each dependent
on the other, under the conditions at present
ruling in New South Wales ; and, although,
when difficulties arise each of the interested
parties forms a hostile camp, and then defies
the other, the Minister should seek to realize
the interests of both by acts of mediation, by
means of which, in times of trouble, each should
bear a fair proportion of the diminution of their
earnings, and each, when prosperity again arises,
should share the profit. The Minister might
even go beyond the ranks of miners and mine
owners to lighten the burdens which our great
coal industry has to bear in hard times like the
present. He should look into every burden
which bears too heavily upon the industry, and
see that the present monstrous harbour dues
►and charges at our most important coal port
are reduced within the bounds of common sense
and reason. No port dues should be more than
will suffice to maintain the services of the port


in competent efficiency ; and, least of all, a port
whose commerce can supply the motive force of
all the ocean carriers of the world. Why drive
the ships away to other countries for their coal; ’
or, why necessitate a less than living wage to
those who labour in the pits, when half the
harbour dues could be with prudence taken off
the traffic, and still maintain a revenue amply
sufficient to cover all expenses, and leave a fund
to deepen and improve the harbour and the
bar, so that it would rank amongst the finest in
the world ?
Let every interest in New South Wales be
self-dependent and self-reliant; no benefit can
ever come from unjust and unnecessary barriers
to commerce. Every thousand tons of coal
means living wages to many miners ; and every
ship that passes by the port, and will not enter
here to buy her coal, inevitably means a loss to
New South Wales, as well as to Newcastle ;
for what Newcastle earns in getting coal, it
spends on those who raise the crops, and manu-
facture boots and clothes, and all the various
necessities of life. Thus the interests of all the
industries in New South Wales are benefitted
by every ship that takes away her bunkers full
of coal, or a full cargo far away to other lands,
from our rich coalfields. All this may be
assisted by wise financial policy, or otherwise,.


retarded by grasping greed, that kills the goose
who lays the golden eggs.
% # * * *
Why should not every country public school
be made partially self-supporting, by making
experimental gardening and poultry-rearing a
subject of instruction to the boys and girls.
Every school should have sufficient area of
garden ground attached, and every child should
be thus early taught to- take an interest in it,
in growing flowers to make their homes and
schoolhouse beautiful; and table fruits and
vegetables, which certainly would find a ready
market amongst their parents. What grateful
prizes the garden would afford for those who
show a special aptitude and industry in the
work ; and what a blessing it would be if every
girl and boy who leaves the school had learnt
the love of nature, and how richly she rewards
the tender care which even a child can offer her.
If the Educational Department would distribute
garden seeds at wholesale price, suited to the
locality, with simply worded directions for
culture, and the season when to sow each seed,
and sell the same- in penny packets to the
children for their parents, how many a home
might thus be made more happy, and how many
a father might, be drawn to take an interest in
a garden through the love he bears his children,
and his desire to see them happy in an occupa-


tion in which not one child out of ten can fail
to take delight when once they have the
instinct planted in their little hearts. Then
village flower’ shows should form a monthly
holiday, and small prizes might be given to
every cultivator who realises a fair degree of
excellence in his exhibits. The clergyman and
squatter of the district would surely take an
interest in this method of making working men
lead purer, nobler lives than those who have no
other relaxation than the public-house. The
cost would be so trifling, and the benefit so
great and pleasing, that any Minister of Educa-
tion who would inaugurate a policy of this kind
would live immortally within the hearts of all
the rustic population. And many a man in
after life would bless the day when, as a child,
he used a little spade and water-pot, and learnt
how kindly nature blesses those who tend her
patiently and constantly.
If two days a week for every boy and girl
were taken from book lessens and spent in
garden culture, poultry rearing and bee culture,
and in cooking simple dinners from the garden
vegetables, with just a modicum of meat to add
a flavouring, would -not the little ones who
trudge a mile or more to school enjoy the mid-
day hour far more than when they bring their
lunch or dinner from their homes ? and what a
revolution it would make in poor men’s homes if


all the wives and mothers, all the boys and
girls, knew how to cook a savoury meal from
garden vegetables, picked before the dew was
off the ground at early sunrise, and all of their
own growing I Depend upon it, this learning
would do more to make lives happy than mathe-
matics or geography, or ancient history, and
the refreshing work would brace the minds of
all the children to grapple with the other
subjects; and always the pleasure of the garden
work might be the prize of other lessons well-
remembered. Then country life wmuld be an
enviable existence which intelligent beings
might enjoy, and those who are compelled to
spend their lives in cities w T ell might envy.
This would bring people on the land, and that
is all we need to make this country flourish and
her people happy, prosperous, and orderly.
This Avould cure the growing vice of larrikinisrn
—reduce the crime to less than half, and soon
make want and pauperism unknown in this fair
land.


CHAPTER XL
Now, what conclusions may we rightly draw
from the varied evidence that we have lightly
touched upon, and gathered from the experience
of ourselves and other nations ?
The truths that we shall ever strive to teach
are three which form the bed rock of stability
and healthy national growth, both for the
individual and for the state.
1. That all political action must be based
on economic law.
2. That economic law is built on our ex-
tending knowledge of the law of
nature.
3. That the law of nature is the source of
that great stream of knowledge and of
wisdom, at which the patriarchs and
ancient sages drank the living truth,
whose fountain head is God ; enabling
them to lead pure lives, and utter
noble words whose distant echo still
resounds throughout the world.
The strength of our investigating school of
modern teachers is, that they now take the
open book of nature, reading every page with


careful thought, and by experimental test seek
to obtain the proof that what they teach is
true.
Now, nothing can be plainer than that
industry is the source of wealth, of happiness,
and of virtue; while idleness is the source of
poverty, of misery, and of vice. Nothing can
be plainer than that all our wealth proceeds
from nature’s opportunities, which we define as
Land: because apart from land we cannot
possibly exist.
Nothing can be plainer than that all tenure
of land (until quite recent times) was a tenure
for service rendered to the State, which in the
person of the Sovereign granted all title to
occupy land, and could revoke it at his will, for
non-fulfilment of the conditions on which it was
granted, or otherwise.
o 7
We would commend the reader’s attention to
the extracts from ‘ Blackstone’s Commentaries ’
in the appendix for fuller light upon the subject
of law. Although these commentaries have
been an universally /accepted authority upon
English law and its development from early
custom and authority, the maxims there laid
down are constantly disregarded in our Statutes
and Acts of Parliament, and the principles of
justice so clearly stated are as constantly set at
naught by our lawyers and judges.


We must return to the bed rock of nature’s
laws, and nature’s truths, if we would have
right and justice again predominate in our social
organization ; and it would be well if we could
O 7
at one stroke cancel the mischief making
statutes of the past 30 years, and start afresh
with common sense, and the simple law of reason
and equity. This will not be possible while
lawyers make the laws ; their province is to
evade or to administer them ; if lawyers make
the laws it is inevitable that they will be so
intricate that no man can take one step without
legal advice ; herein lies their profit, and no
man will run counter to his own and his col-
leagues’ interests.
The people should determine what the laws
shall be. The Legislative body should carry their
will into law. The administration should carry
out the law in its entirety, and when in doubt,
the lawyers may quarrel over its interpretation.
But before any really useful laws can be made
in relation to such a great question as the land
tenure of the future, the people must first lay
down a living principle, which shall cancel all
the moribund and confused statutes and laws
about land tenure built up by varying and con-
tradictory decisions of the courts upon the
subject. And define, that the good old term of
‘ usufruct,’ or ‘ fruits of usage,’ shall be all that
any man can claim possession of, in any land ot


which he holds the title. This will include his
own or predecessor’s actual improvements and
those, good gifts of nature which are her response
to his attentive care and cultivation and nothing
else, unless he can show good and ample cause
to justify his claim. We must not overlook the
fact that the State has ever been, and ever
must remain the fountain of all law ; and
although this fountain has frequently been
polluted at its source, and consequently its
streams have spread corruption, instead of min-
istering to the health of the community, the
law has been accepted and acted on in perfect
faith by many individuals, to their benefit or
disaster ; therefore whatever rights or privileges
have been conferred by laws, however bad, these
must not be confiscated without a just equivalent
for that which is at any time withdrawn.
This we have provided for by clearly showing
that use and improvement of the land shall form
form the basis of all permanent title—and only
the unimproved lands shall be available for
resumption by the State, for others to improve
and use. We have also provided that not only
shall the individual be recompensed (whenever
his lands are resumed) by giving him an equiva-
lent ; but he shall have the option of fixing this
equivalent, at any sum upon which he is pre-
pared to pay the land tax.


This will stimulate actual and permanent
improvements on the land, and beneficial active
use, which in its turn must enrich the country,
for every effort will he made to increase pro-
duction. To produce the highest quality and
most marketable goods, and to put them
on the market in the form in which they are
required for consumption or manufacture, or for
export to the wider markets of the world.
There is a school of politicians who argue
that the State should not ‘ interfere ’ in com-
merce or production ; by the same rule the
individual head should not ‘ interfere ’ in any-
thing that the individual body desires to do !
What confusion and disaster would result to all
of us if this were so !
The Governmental system of administration
represents the head of the body politic and
economic, and it should wisely * interfere ’ in
every means of wealth and welfare, by which
the happiness and comfort of the community
may be increased, guiding and protecting each
infant effort at improvement of our productive
or distributive industries, so that they may
healthily survive the storms of opposition which
small monopolistic minorities so clamourously
raise, when any assault is made on their so-called
vested rights.
The way to get a healthy code of good and
workable laws would be to make it incumbent


on every judge, to carefully consider every point
of law that comes before him, in the cases which
he tries, in which the action of that point of
jaw is opposed to equity and the public welfare,
he should record his opinion as to what altera-
tion is needed, to bring the law into line and
harmony with the requirements of the time and
place, and indicate the most advisable means of
doing this, addressing a report to the Minister
for Justice, to be laid upon the table of the
House, and published in the Government Gazette ;
that all who like may see it. Then once a year
a council of the judges, with an equal number
of lay members of the Legislative House, should
form a grand committee for law revision ; and
their report should be a standing dish to deal
with when Parliament wants relief from party
strife, and the windy animosity of frivolous and
vexatious obstructive tactics.
A lengthy draught of this sweet cooling mix-
ture would keep "the House in temperate health,
with steady pulse, active digestion, and clear
headedness ; and then in time it might draw up a
code of law for New South Wales, within the com-
prehension of any citizen of moderate capacity.
What a boon this would be to all of us, many of
whom would rather suffer wrong repeatedly than
risk the law’s delays, the law’s uncertainty, anJ
the certain costliness of law suits and lawyers’
bills, in seeking redress at such alarming risk.


CHAPTER XII.
To the Reader—
If you have followed thus far with us we
cannot be wrong in classing you as one for
whom the book was written, and therefore we
ask your help in order that some of the sug-
gestions in its pages may be carried out, and
that right soon.
O
Are you satisfied that ten per cent, of the
people should unconditionally own ninety-nine
per cent, of the freehold lands, and these the
pick of New South Wales, while ninety per cent,
of the people only own one per cent of the
land ?
Are you satisfied that as the result of this
inequitable accumulation of the only means
which nature has provided by which man can
maintain himself and gather wealth, ninety-
five per cent, of all the private wealth should
remain in the hands of ten per cent, of the
people, and the other ninety per cent, of the
people should struggle on for another generation
with only five per cent, of the wealth ?
Is this fair ? Is this wise ? Is this beneficial
to the State and the community ? Es this fair
to you ?


If you think not, then there is one remedy in
your hands so simple, so harmless, so effectual,
that you can be the means of bringing about the
greatly needed change. Resolve with all your
heart to let no opportunity pass when you can
influence your fellow citizens to take an earnest
interest in political action, not as a partisan,
but as a patriot 1
Resolve that no candidate for Parliament
shall have your vote who has not honesty,
intelligence, and courage ; and make him bind
himself to support a wise and equitable measure
for the reform of all land tenure. When this is
done the field of useful legislation will be cleared
and stumped, and ready for the plough, but
until this is done no matter what measures you
obtain to benefit the people, the profit all in-
evitably gravitates into the pocket of the
monopolist almost as soon as it has been obtained
for your benefit.
Xow, what do you honestly think of our
proposals—are they equitable ? Are they
beneficial ? Are they feasible ? Already large
public meetings have unanimously declared they
are, and if carried out will benefit the whole
community, and that they should be made a
test question for every Parliamentary candidate
to deal with : but, reader, it is not the member
of Parliament who should make the laws ; that
is where our troubles in the past have all come


in. You should declare your will and it should
be law. This is the spirit of the referendum,
which works so healthily and smoothly in the
best governed democracy in the world, the little
State of Switzerland. This State has been
self-governing, peaceful and prosperous for
many centuries, each canton dealing with its
own immediate concerns and submitting to the
Federal Council all measures or proposals for
the general welfare, the advisability of which is
tested by the referendum, which as far back as
the year 1291 was adopted by three leading
cantons ; five more cantons adopted it in the
fourteenth century, two in the fifteenth, three
in the sixteenth, and the remainder in the very
early years of the present century.
The leading features of this legislative method
1. Every citizen shall have the right to
propose a measure of law to his fellow
citizens. This principle is known as
the ‘ Initiative.’
2. The majority shall actually enact the
law by voting the acceptance or the
rejection of the measures proposed.
This principle is known as the
‘ Referendum.’
Can anything be clearer or fairer than this ?
Let us put the system to an experimental
test. In the preceding pages we point out the


(already well known) lamentable conditions
which have made prosperity impossible, while
fertile land is idle and inaccessible.
We suggest a principle which if adopted
would wrong no man and benefit all.
We suggest a method to cany out this prin-
ciple without much cost and which would enable
every man to make himself acquainted with the
conditions upon which any area of uncultivated
land may be available for him to till and render
fruitful to his own benefit.
N owq we want the people to declare their will
by signing the resolution which has already
been approved at several public meetings after
exhaustive and careful consideration.
Any who wish to go more deeply into the

APPENDIX.
Probates and the Proportion of Wealth
Possessing to Wealthless Male Adults.
The 1893 edition of the “Wealth and Pro-
gress,” dated December 1, 1893, p. 701, states
that in 1891 the number of women’s estates
that paid probate duty was 410, out of a total
number of 1839 probates. This leaves the
number of male probates 1429. This informa-
tion will enable us to state with very reasonable
accuracy the proportion of wealthy to wealth-
less male adults, and show conclusively how
grossly erroneous is the statement that “ for
“every 100 male adults 41 have property to
“the value of £lOO, which, restricted as it; may
“ be deemed, is a considerably wider distribution
“ than is found in older countries.”— Wealth and
Progress, 1891 edition, p. 638.
The total number of deaths of male adults, 1891 5400
The number of male adults leaving probate, 1891 1429
The number of wealthless ... ... ... 3971
The proportion possessing wealth ... 26‘5 per cent.
The proportion wealthless ... ... 73'5 per cent.
If the distribution of wealth among the living
is in the same proportion as is shown in the


records of those who die, the percentage of
those who are living in the enjoyment of wealth
in any degree must be similar, viz.: 26-5 per
cent,; leaving the wealthless male adults, 7 3‘5
per cent.
On the Nature of Laws in General.
(Extracts from “ Blackstones Commentaries.”)
“ Man depends absolutely upon his Maker for
everything : it is necessary that he should, in
all points, conform to his Maker’s will. He
laid down certain immutable laws of human
nature whereby his freewill is in some degree
regulated and restrained, and gave him also the
faculty of reason to discover the purport of
those laws.” .
“ Such, among others, are these principles :
that we should live uprightly, should hurt
nobody, and should render to every one his
due ; to which three general precepts Justinian
has reduced the whole doctrine of law.” , . .
“ He has so intimately connected, so insepar-
ably interwoven, the laws of eternal justice with
the happiness of each individual, that the latter
cannot be attained but by observing the former ;
and, if the former be punctually obeyed, it cannot
but induce the latter. In consequence of which
mutual connection of justice and human felicity
he has not perplexed the law of nature with s


multitude of abstracted rules and precepts, but
has graciously reduced the rule of obedience to
this one paternal precept: “ That man should
pursue his own true and substantial happiness.”
“ This law of nature is, of course, superior in
obligation to any other. It is binding all over
the globe, in all countries, at all times. No
human laws are of any validity if contrary to
this; and such of them as are valid derive all
their force, all their authority, mediately or
immediately, from this original.” .
“ The necessity of union, therefore, is the solid
and necessary foundation, as well as the cement,
of civil society. In nature and reason it must
always be understood and implied that the whole
should protect all its parts, and that every part
should obey the will of the whole.”
“In a democracy where the right of making
laws resides in the people at large public virtue
is more likely to be found than in either of the
other qualities of government.”
“ In Aristocracies there is more wisdom to be
found, but there is less honesty than in a re-
public. Democracies are usually the best calcu-
lated to direct the end of a law, Aristocracies to
invent the means by which that end shall be
obtained, and monarchies to carry those means
into execution.”
“ Common law (Lex non scripta). With us at
present the monuments and evidences of our


legal customs are contained in the records of
the several courts of justice, &c., preserved and
handed down to us from times of the highest
antiquity. They receive their binding power
and the force of laws by long and immemorial
usage and by their universal reception.” . . .
“ And thus much for the first ground and chief
cornerstone of the laws of England, which is
general immemorial custom or common law.
For since (says Julianus) the written law binds
us for no other reason than that it is approved
by the people, therefore those laws which the
people have approved without writing ought
also to bind everybody. Thus did they reason
while Horne had some remains of her freedom,
but when Imperial tyranny came to be fully
established the civil laws speak a very different
language.”
Laws of Property and Land.
“ Accurately and strictly speaking, there is no
foundation in nature or in natural law why a
set of words on parchment should convey the
dominion of land; why the son should have a
right to exclude his fellow-creatures from a de-
terminate spot of land because his father had
done so before him ; or why the occupier of a
particular field or of a jewel, when lying on his
death-bed, and no longer able to maintain pos-
session, should be entitled to tell to the rest of


the world which of them should enjoy it after
him. When law is to be considered as a rational
science, it cannot be improper or useless to
examine the rudiments and grounds of these
positive constitutions of society.” .
“ In the beginning of the world the Creator
gave to man “ dominion over all the earth.”
This is the only true and solid foundation of
man’s dominion over external things. The
earth, therefore, and all things therein, are the
general property of all mankind.” .
“ By the law of nature and reason, he who first
began to use it acquired therein a kind of tran-
sient property that lasted so long as he was
using it, and no longer; or, to speak with
greater precision, the right of possession con-
tinued for the same time only that the act of
possession lasted.” . . .
“ Thus the ground was common, and no part
of it was the permanent property of any man in
particular,”
“ The soil and pasture of the earth remained
in common except where the necessity of a sole
and exclusive property in lands for the sake of
agriculture was felt, and therefore readily com-
plied with.* • .
“It was clear that the earth would not produce
her fruits in sufficient quantities without the
aid of tillage ; but who would be at the pains


of tilling it if another might watch an oppor-
tunity to seize upon and enjoy the produce of
his industry, art, and labour ?”
“ Naturally speaking, the instant a man ceases
to be, he ceases to have any dominion ; else, if
he had a right to dispose of his acquisitions one
moment beyond his life, he would also have a
right to direct their disposal for a million ages,
which would be highly absurd.” . . .
“ A man’s children or nearest relations are
usually about him on his death-bed, and are
the earliest witnesses of his decease. They be-
came, therefore, generally the next immediate
occupants, till at length in process of time this
frequent usage ripened into general law. While
property continued only for life, testaments were
useless and unknown.” .
“ In England, till modern times, a man could
only dispose of one-third of his movables from
his wife and children; and in general no will
was permitted of lands till the reign of Henry
VIII., and then only of a certain portion, for
it was not till after the restoration that the
power of devising real property became so uni-
versal as at present.” . . .
“ The law of nature suggests that on the death
of the possessor the estate should again become
common, and be open to the next occupant .. .
“ As disturbance would frequently arise among
individuals contending about the acquisition of


property by first occupancy, the law has there-
fore wisely cut up the root of discussion by
vesting the things themselves in the Sovereign
of the state, or his representatives, with the
object of assigning to everything capable of
ownership a legal and determinate owner. The
grand and fundamental maxim of all feudal
tenure is this, that all lands were originally
granted out by the Sovereign, and are therefore
holden mediately or immediately of the Crown.”
“At the first introduction of feuds, as they
were gratuitous, so also they were precarious,
and held at the will of the lord, who was then
the sole judge whether his vassals performed
his services faithfully. Among the ancient
Germans they continued only from year to
year, an annual distribution of their lands being
made by their leaders in their general councils
or assemblies.” .
“ All the real property is, by the policy of our
laws, supposed to be granted by, dependent
upon, and holden of some superior lord in con-
sideration of certain services to be rendered to
his lord by the tenant or possessor of the pro-
perty.” . .
“ Thus all the land in the kingdom is supposed
to be holden mediately or immediately of the
king, who is styled the lord paramount, or
above all, —Blackstones Commentaries, vols. I.
and II.” . . .

Agricultural Colleges in France.
There are a number of agricultural colleges
in France for training boys to practical farm-
ing. They are turning out about 700 boys
every year to spread the knowledge of agri-
culture in their homes and districts. The age
for entrance is 14 years.
Each boy spends five hours a day in practical
work and five hours in study, lectures, and
classes. There are 45 students in each college,
and they cultivate 300 acres of land under a
great variety of crops.
The classes consist of chemistry, geology,
physiology, veterinary law, and carpentry. The
boys spend one week on the farm, one week in
the garden, and one week in the kitchen and
laboratory in rotation.
The opinion of an English agricultural expert
who visited these colleges is thus expressed :
“The farming is extremely skilful, and the land
absolutely clean/’
In the Post-office Saving Banks there are
6,500,000 depositors, whose deposits amount to
£112,000,000. In France the rural population
is upwards of 75 per cent, of the whole popula-
tion, and they nearly all own land.

Questioning everywhere, the same unbroken
testimony is given to the prosperity, freedom,
and thrift of the labouring peasant throughout
France; and it is universally ascribed to the
facility of acquiring land at will, and cheaply,
consequent upon the extinction of the great
landowners at the Revolution, and the centri-
fugal distribution of the soil which followed it.

peasant culture of the grape for vin ordinaire

In Paris the markets are models for the
world. The grower brings his fruits, vege-
tables, and flowers to market himself, and sells
them to his customers. The rich and poor
alike make marketing a daily duty and a
pleasure. The early comer gets the pick, both
in quality and freshness, and before noon every-
thing is cleared away. The charitable houses
and the poor will always clear up, at a low
price, any remnants which have not fetched


their price during the early market hours. The
producer and the consumer both get satisfac-
tion, and stand on level terms with one another.
No middleman can rob them both or let their
produce rot. There are no railway freights to
pay, no brokerage and other charges—only a
small market toll for standing-room or larger
space in lofty buildings, which every house-
keeper in Paris visits every day, because its
fruits and flowers make the most beautiful show
of all the many pleasing sights in this fair city.
And not only is it free, but every visit is a source
of profit also. This cannot honestly be said of
all the shows in Paris! If the wasted land
around our cities and small towns were similarly
used, we might obtain a similar result. —A. F. H.
In England £175,000,000 worth of animal
produce is grown every year in milk, cheese,
butter, meat, and wool. Under the allotment
system (spade culture) 50 to 57 bushels of
wheat and other grain are grown to the acre.
In Jersey 100 acres ot pasture supports 60
milch cows, who give the richest and most
abundant milk of any cattle in the world ; and
every acre cultivated will give from 50 to 100
tons of root crops per annum to the cultivator.

The Land and Wealth op New South Wales.
Mr. A. Fraser Hill, who is lecturing throughout
N. S. Wales on matters little understood of the people,
and illustrating, by means of a speaking diagram, the
glaring inequalities of wealth distribution, has sub-
mitted several long and interesting manuscripts, from
one of which a few statements and deductions are
extracted and here presented.
According to Mr. Hill; If all the private wealth
and all the freehold land in New South Wales were
equally divided amongst all the men, each man’s por-
acres of pastoral land for £4 per annum.
Why, then, should there be any poor and homeless
in 1ST. S. Wales ? Yet, Mr. Hill finds, by carefully
checked processes of approved actuarial calculation,
estimating from the facts supplied by probate returns,
that the condition of the male adults of N. S. Wales
may be thus stated :—
And, in addition, he would be entitled to lease 400
* * * * *


Which means that 30'70 per cent, are in possession of
all the wealth of the province, while 69'30 per cent,
are absolutely penniless, or, at least, have no effects
worth speaking about.
The accompanying diagram is a reduced photograph
of one prepared by Mr. Hill, in colours, and will repay
study. Working men, possessing 207,749 votes, are
absolutely without possessions, but live from hand to
mouth; while 862 other persons own among them the un-
thinkable total of £138,200,000. Similarly, 20,000,000
acres of land are owned by fewer men than there are
minute’s in a working winter’s day; and if the area
that they cultivate; were to be represented by one
minute, the whole remaining period from dawn until
sunset would be insufficient to symbolise the vast areas
they leave untouched ! They do not occupy the land,
but merely fence it round with barbed wire, and pre-
vent others from occupying and using it.
In a democratic country, where the people’s votes
make the laws, there are 257,320 voters each without
as much land as would make him a grave, while a
handful of other voters own 20,000,000 acres.

Land and Wealth.
Mr. Fraser Hill’s lectures on “ Land and Wealth in
New South Wales,” delivered at Leigh House, and
pretty fully reported in the Australian Workman,
ought to be of great service to the State. Mr. Hill
points out with great clearness and cogency of argu-
ment and illustration that we are at present neglecting
and grossly mismanaging our magnificent estate.
* * *


Well may Mr. Fraser Hill compare New South
Wales to the prodigal son, and describe how this
waster has up to date squandered his estate. Mr.
Hill’s lecture will do good service, and we wish very
much that one who knows so much about all these
questions, who can speak so. intelligently, so calmly,
and so temperately, could be placed in a position
where his knowledge, practical ideas, and enthusiasm
for honest, fruitful labour would be of greater service
to the State. When we look at some of the “ repre-
sentatives of the people,” and compare them with this
man, we feel disposed to say —Look at this picture,
and on that.

A Lecture on the Land Question.
On Monday and Tuesday week Mr. A. Fraser Hill
delivered two very interesting and instructive lectures
in the hall of the Mechanics’ Institute, Plattsburg, the
subject being “The Land and Wealth of New South
Wales.” The Mayor of the borough, Mr. O. Gr. Steel,
presided on both occasions, and the attendances were
exceptionally good, particularly on the second evening,
the large hall being crowded, and possibly no greater
compliment could be paid to the lecturer than this.
The instructive and attractive character was fully
sustained throughout, and a more sympathetic and
enthusiastic audience has rarely, if ever, been brought
together to listen to the most continuous of aggres-
sive political harangues, while Mr. Hill did not make
use of any personalities or abuse which is so frequently
the weapon of political gladiators of to-day. His
weapons are the Sword of Truth and fact, with the
keen edge of charm and lucidity, the sharp point of
analogy and illustration. The lecture bubbled over


with good humour, and, at the same time, it was
brimful of earnestness, appropriate pathos in some of
the sad and dire results of the profligate nature of
past governmental misdeeds, for which the people
{i.e., the masses) are now suffering. By means of
large diagrams Mr. Hill is able to teach through the
eye and enable his audience to grasp the situation of
the land holding, and the proportion of cultivated and
uncultivated areas. This gentleman possesses the very
happy art of knowing how to impart and keep his
audience brimful of interest, and cannot fail to do
good. The cultivation of the land is what Mr. Hill is
endeavouring to educate the people up to, as from the
land all sources of wealth must come. Humanity and
land, as put by Mr. Hill, comprise all the wealth of
the world.
The lecturer left for a tour through the Northern
district, calling at Narrabri first, and then visiting all
the important centres of population, where we hope
that he will be favoured with large audiences, which
cannot fail to be profited by the utterances of one who
is able to discourse so intelligently and scientifically on
this all-important question of land, the nation’s wealth.
From the Newcastle Herald, November 23rd, 1893.
Lecture.
On Monday evening Mr. Fraser Hill delivered a
most instructive and interesting lecture on “Land and
Wealth,” in the hall of the Mechanics’ Institute. There
was a good attendance, and the Mayor of Plattsburg
(Mr. 0. Gr. Steel) occupied the chair.
Mr. Hill appears to be well qualified to educate the
people on the land question. His particularly happy


manner and quaint expressions very soon liad his
audience not only in good humour;, but so interested
tli at none of the salient points of the lecture were lost
sight of. By means of large diagrams the lecturer
placed the subject in such a form as by comparisons no
one could fail to understand.
Mr. Hill concluded a most instructive and interesting
lecture amidst applause, and a hearty vote of thanks
brought the proceedings to a close.
November 24th.
Plattsburg—Lecture .
Mr. Fraser Hill delivered his second lecture on
“ The Land and Wealth of New South Wales,” and
the interest aroused by his Monday night’s lecture
brought a crowded audience to hear him. The chief
point of the lecture was in the local statistics, which
had been compiled by Mr. Hill during his visit, and
exhibited on a large diagram 9ft. by sft. The diagram
dealt with the four counties of Northumberland, Dur-
ham, Hunter, and Cook, which possess an area of
5,810,000 acres, with a population of 118,661 persons,
of whom the male adults number 35,500.
Mr. Hill pointed out that unity among the demo-
cracy was absolutely essential to a reversal of the laws
which had opei’ated in causing such an unnatural state
of things, and exhorted the electors not to differ among
themselves among minor points, but to send represen-
tatives to the House who would bring about the in-
auguration of a better condition of affairs with regard
to the land. The address was attentively listened to
and applauded at intervals throughout.


From the Northern Advocate, Narrabri,
November 26th, 1898.
Mr. Fraser Hill, who has been lecturing on the
above subject in Sydney and Newcastle, came down
to Narrabri to deliver his lectures here, but unfortu-
nately he took cold waiting at Quirindi station, and
has temporarily lost his voice. The lecture which he
intended to give on Friday night was, therefore,
unavoidably postponed. We very much regret that
the opportunity is lost for the present, but hope that
before he leaves us his voice may be sufficiently re-
stored to enable him to show us his diagrams, and
point out to ns in his lucid manner the actual state of
the country under its present disastrous land laws.

The Progress of Economics.
We would call special attention to Mr. Fraser Hill’s
lecture, published in another column, on the land
question. His exposition is clear and plain, and his
diagrams throw a glare of light upon the somewhat
involved subject, which cannot fail to bring many a
waverer under the banner of “the people’s rights” in
the matter. No more startling expose of the evils of
land monopoly in the province has ever been published.
Land and Wealth in New South Wales.
In spite of the very inclement weather on Saturday
night, a good audience had assembled at Leigh House
by 8 o’clock to hear the third lecture by Mr. Fraser
Hill on the above subject. Mr. Sinclair occupied the
chair, and called attention to the educational value of
the lectures, which had been fully reported in the


Workman. He hoped they would read carefully and
endeavour to remember the very important statistics,
which were the embodiment of much research and
thought on the part of the lecturer.
December 9th, 1893.
Lecture at Narrabri.
Fraser Hill gave us a lecture on the Land and
Wealth of N.S.W., on Friday night. He had the
Town Hall, and the Mayor took the chair. The room
was full, and he had a good hearing. His lecture
appeared in the Northern Advocate in two and a half
columns, and it is good, readable stuff, with lots of in-
formation in it. His lecture was worth twenty of G-.
H. Reid’s. He does not abuse the Governments; he
tells the people straight that if they like to go on in
the same old way, they can, but if they want to im-
prove things they must all pull together, and get
honest, earnest men into Parliament who will go
straight and follow a good leader when they get one.
Mr. Fraser Hill’s lecture was full of straight and sound
sense, and he quite charmed his hearers.
Mr. Fraser Hill will be lecturing on the
Land Question in the principal centres of popu-
lation in New South Wales.

his lectures will kindly address their communi-

The following resolutions were proposed and

public meetings at Newcastle, Stockton, Platts-
burg and elsewhere, now submitted to every
reader of the book for his signature and com-
ments.
Resolved
That having heard Mr. Fraser Hill’s lectures
upon the Land and Wealth of New South
Wales (or read his book) we are of opinion
that—
1. The present condition of affairs is be-
coming intolerable to the masses of the
people through the accumulation of land
and wealth in the hands of the few and
the exclusion of the many from the
opportunities of nature, by which alone
all men can live.
2. That Mr. Fraser Hill’s propositions for
land reform are equitable, feasible, and
beneficial, and that if carried out they
will strike at the root of the evil, and
will benefit the whole community.
3 They desire that every facility may be
given to Mr. Fraser Hill to spread the
truths which he desires to teach,
wherever there are earnest working
men who love their country and desire
its welfare, and that the support of his
