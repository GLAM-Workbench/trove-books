KRON’S SOLE LEATHER—Keeps out Water
A. £l. Stoddart,
Andrew Ernest Stoddart, the captain
of the English team,is probably the most
popular cricketer that ever played in
Australia. It is very strange that in hi s
early days he had a penchant more for
football than cricket, and it was after he
had earned his spurs as an international
footballer that we hear of him taking to
cricket in all seriousness. With a very
neat style in batting, and having the
happy knack of either playing a forcing
game or a steady one, he is a fine model
for any young player to copy. He has
for many years been one of the foremost
cricketers of the world, and, apart from
his great deeds with the representative
teams, he has been one of the mainstays
of Middlesex county cricket. He has
played in the representative matches

(England v. Australia) both on English
and Australian soil. At the present time
he holds the record for the highest score
for England in the test matches, having
achieved that distinction in the second
Test Match in Melbourne in 1895, when
he scored an almost perfect innings of
173. Although not clas ed by the Eng-
lish critics as one of the greatest of the
world’s captains, he is, nevertheless, a
fine captain, and probably gets as much
out of his side as any one of them could.
He will always be remembered by Aus-
tralians for his manly actions on the
field, and those who witnessed his action
in giving his wicket away in the first
Test Match at Lord’s in 1896, after a bad
decision had been given in his favor by
th umpire, will never forget the episoc’e.
Such actions as these are of very rare
occurrence, and it would be ungrateful
on the part of the public if these were to
be forgotten. Born on March 11, 1863,
he is now over 34 years of age.

W. Storer.
W. Storer, the great wicket-keeper of
the new combination, is thought by
many good judges to be the very best
wicket-keeper in the old country.
Many there are who aver that Lilley is,
but it is only a matter of opinion, as
both are very fine stumpers. Perhaps
Storer is the better man against fast
bowling and Lilley against the medium
pace. As a stumper he differs greatly
from most others, as he has a peculiar
habit of sitting on his haunches when
waiting for a ball, but this in no way
detracts from the merits of his work, as
he is very much on the alert the instant

the ball is delivered. From taking par«
ticular notice of his style, you would
almost think this habit would be too
tiring to a man, especially when you ar e
obliged to sit through a blazing sum-
mer's day. Another peculiar habit is
the taking of the ball behind the wicket.
To s’ow or medium-pace bowing, he
takes the MU closer to the stumps than
most men. As a batsman, although,
unfortunately, not gifted with a very
graceful attitude at the wicket, he is
very effective, and an exceedingly
difficult wicket to get. For many years
he has been one of the mainstays of
Derbyshire cricket, getting, as a rule,
over the ICCO runs during the season.
At a pinch, too, he has often been
called upon to bowl, and he rarely fails
to effect a separation. Born on January
25, 1868, he is approaching his 30th
year.

J. H. Board
J. H. Board, the second wicket-keeper
of the team, is the stumper of Glouces-
tershire County, and a real good one to
boot. He is one of the pluckiest men
who ever donned the flannels. No mat-
ter whether he gets hit batting or wicket
keeping he goes on in his own merry
way, without any desire to knock off.
He owes his position in the cricket world
in rather a peculiar way. Some years
ago, playing for the colts of Gloucester
against the county eleven, he showed
such neatness that Dr. Grace asked him
to don the gloves for the eleven in the
second innings of the colts, which he

pays bowl rather fast, left-hand, sent
down some real swift balls, which
Board took as coolly as a veteran would*
So impressed was Grace with his neat-
ness and skill that henceforth he came
to be regarded as the county wicket-
keeper, and with one or two exceptions,
when J. H. Brain officiated for a time,
he has held the position ever since.
Without being in any way a scientific or
finished batsman, he generally manages
to get a lot of runs, and against the best
of bowlers. His innings of 80 odd, in
conjunction with Wrathall, against
Surrey last year, when the two put up
over a bundled for the first wicket for
Gloucester’s second innings, was a very
meritorious one, and shows the grit and
stamina which is in his constitution
Born on January 23, 1867, he is
approaching his 31st year.

J. T. Hearne.
Jack HeAunb, next to Ranjitsinhji, is
the most interesting personage in the
team. Everyone in Australia is anxious
to see the bowler who has done such
wonderful deeds for Middlesex for so
many years. It was not till the year
1890 that the Middlesex authorities dis-
covered that they had a bowler of such
considerable promise. After that year
Hearne has never looked back, and from
1891, when he got his 100 wickets in the
season, he has regularly kept his place
as one of the best bowlers of the day.

is Lord’s. With a row of spectators
heads behind him, and a gentle sloping
pitch which considerably hdlps his
break, he does some extraordinary thing 8
with the ball. On some occasions when
the (vicket helps him (as was the case in
the M. 0.0. match) he is almost unplay-
able. He is so accurate that on ordinary
good wickets he is very rarely, if ever,
punished. Notwithstanding his past
success, his head has never been turned,
and he still remains one of the most
popular of cricketers. His name, in
conjunction with A. D. Rougher, will
ever be remembered as the two bowlers
who bowled the last Australian Eleven
at Lord’s for 18 runs, the smallest score
ever obtained by an Australian Eleven
in England. The hard wickets of Aus-
tralia will, it is thought, militate against
his success as a bowler. Born on May
3, 1867, he is now over 30 years of age.

T. Hayward
Tom Hayward is, at the present time,
probably the best all-round cricketer in
the world. There are many good judges
in England who prefer F. S. Jackson
before him ; but, on performances, he is
clearly first. In Australia, of course,
we regard George Giffen as his superior.
He is a nephew of the famous Tom
Hayward, the famous Surrey batsman,
who flourished in the sixties. It would
be hard to find a more taking cricketer,
whether he is batting, bowling, or field-
ing. For four years he has been one of

the mainstays of Surrey cricket, and he
enjoys the distinction of being one of
the most popular professionals. He is
alike at home on the good or bad
wickets, and when thoroughly set he
scores rapidly. Strange that he should
so closely resemble his famous unc’e,
Thos. Hayward, both in bowling and
batting, having the same beautiful style.
He declared his highest ambition was
being chosen to represent England
against Australia at Lord’s in 1896 ; and
although he did nothing particularly
brilliant on that occasion, he was clearly
entitled to his position. An exceedingly
quiet, unassuming man, he is sure to be
popular. Born on March 19, 1870, he is
now 27 years of age.

N. F. Druce.
Norman Druce, the youngest gud cer-
tainly the most brilliant batsman in the
team, is one whose cricket is sure to be
popular in Australia. Unlike McLaren,
his first appearance for his county was
not attended with success. Many had
hoped that the brilliancy which he had
exhibited at Cambridge would be shown
when he appeared in the ranks of the
Surrey team. In this they were griev-
ously disappointed. It was not until
this year that he did anything approach-

ing his University form. When once set
he makes runs very rapidly and his
power of scoring on the leg side is re-
markable. Without doing anything
great against the last Australian Eleven
he, nevertheless, judging by his recent
successes, is a fine cricketer, and well
worthy of his place on the side. His
largest and certainly his best score this
year was with Cambridge against the
Liverpool Club and district, when he
made 227. As captain of Cambridge he
led his side to victory in the last match
at Lord’s this year, setting his side a
good example by scoring innings of 14
and 72. Born on January I, 1875, he
will probably be playing in the second
test match on his 23rd birthday.

T. Richardson
Tom Richardson, the lion-hearted,”
as he is usually called, and the pride of
the Surrey Eleven, neels, like good wine,
no bush to proclaim his prowess to the
world. Without a doubt he is the
fastest bowler of the day. Although,
perhaps, Kortwright or Jones are faster
for the first few overs, Richardson at the
end, say, of half-an-hour, would be
bowling faster than either of them. The
amount of work he goes through in a
season is astounding. How he keeps
up his form so well passes the compre-
hension of everyone. It is a question if
any fast bowler, bowling at the pace he
does, comes back so quickly off I the
pitch. Certainly there is no present day
bowler who can approach him in this
T. RICHARDSON.
respect. One of his grandest perform-
ances, and, and one which will live long,
est in the memory of his admirers, was
in the second innings of the Second Test
Match at Manchester in 1896. He bowled
for 3f hours without a break, and at
apparently the same pace all the time,
which is nothing short of marvellous.
Eveirwhen the scorers signalled from
the scoring box that the winning hit
had been made, he could scarcely be-
lieve his eyes, and it was long after-
wards before he could leave the field,
showing by his pluck the indomitable
will which knows no defeat was still
unconquered, and, though others may
have thrown up the sponge, he at least
would be found at his post. We, in
Australia, have only a faint conception
of what he is really capable of doing.
If you desire to see a prodigious feat
walk down to Kennington Oval any day,
and see him bowl against one of the
counties. Born on August li, 1870, he
is just 27 years of age.

sides having a break from leg with his
bowling, he has the happy knack of
making the ball curl in the air. Whether
he does it naturally or by cultivation it
is not known, but he ceriaiuly does it.
Some balls which appear to be going
straight towards the off slump swerve
right away on the batsmen’s legs, and
very often from there on to the wicket.
Our hard wickets are not likely to help
his bowling in any degree. He is a
member of the round, robust apd rustic
sort, and although he may get heaps of
runs with the bat he cannot be classed
as a finished batsman. Born September
7, 1871, he is 26 years of age.

Dear Sir, —About two months ago I was afflicted with severe pains between the shoulders, accompanied by headaches,

matter with me. I mentioned the symptoms to a friend, who said I had a severe attack of indigestion, and advised me to try

and he is always reckoned good
at a pinch. He achieved the highest
distinction that can befall a cricketer
nowadays by getting 120 for England v .
Australia in the last Test Match in
Melbourne, in 1895. There is no better
fellow playing cricket to-day. The

Australia to India. —fl Return Message to Ranjitsinhji.
The connection between the illustrious Cricketer (Ranjitsinhji) whose portrait adonis the opposite page, and Pasteurised Milk may
not appear very close, but there is a valuable object lesson in this advanced method of Milk supply which we venture to think will not be
lost on this clever young Prince should he ever assert his right to his uncle’s lands and hereditaments in Nawanagar. It is said of him that
he is a close observer of the manners and customs of the people with whom he sojourns, and a thoughtful writer in criticising his now famous
book remarks, “Born and bred a Ranjput Prince—a race that are sticklers in matters of caste—Ranjitsinhji has given the intellectual wheel
a full turn, as it were, and has thus brought the East and the West into closer proximity and deeper sympathy than they have ever been.”
His message to the boys of England, commencing with the words, “ Keep yourselves in good condition,” contains excellent advice, and is
full of significance, audit is fitting that we in Australia give him a return message to convey, not only to the boys of India, but to every
reigning Prince and Rajas, and it is this: —
Noule Ran,jit, —We, the boys of Australia, have read with deep concern and solicitude the words of Brigadier Surgeon Lieutenant
Colonel Clirao, in the pages of the United Service Gazette , that “ the graveyards of India are filled with young officers and young soldiers struck
down in the pride of their early manhood from the terrible scourge enteric fever, and that such fatality is looked upon with apathy, and as
beyond help.” And, whereas we believe that this and other dire diseases are absolutely preventable if your people will but take heed and
learn of the great French savant Pasteur, and follow in the line of progress marked out by this benefactor of the species; we earnestly entreat
of you to note that our two great laws are “Sanitation and Pasteurisation” —if indeed the two concepts be separable (one being the com-
plement of the other) and it is no idle boast to say that by our adherence to these great principles ours is the healthiest city of the great
Empire, of which India is part. Listen to what our great Raj-pandit (President of the Board of Health) says of the last: —“All milk sup-
plied to the public should be pasteurised, and then rapidly cooled, before being distributed. Many disease germs, and all those which cause
milk to change are thus destroyed, so that the milk remains sweet for a great many hours longer than it otherwise would. Thus those com-
mencing decompositions which are so harmful to young children are largely prevented, and, which is scarcely less important, the harmful
custom of adding preservatives to milk is made unnecessary.” By following the example thus set in Australia you strike at the very root of
all fevers, epidemics and plagues, and by one stroke free India from these scourges that are annually destroying the noble army of youth
and the best sous of your nation.—With compliments from the

K. S. Ranjitsinhji.
Pkince Ranjitsinhji, probably the most
talked about man of the present day, is
recognised as the greatest of the world’s
batsmen. There is no cricketer living
who has excited the admiration and
wonder as this youthful Indian batsman,
and it is a moot point, even in his early
days, if Dr. Grace ever excited the curi-
osity that he has. One thing is very
certain, and that is that as a cricketer he
stands alone, absolutely unique. It is not
enough to say that he is the greatest
batsman of to-day, but there is no
cricketer who can do the deeds that this
latest player can. There are some strokes
which he makes, particularly against fast
bowling, which would be madness on the
part of any other cricketer to attempt.
Some writers have stated there must be
something satanic about him to enable

him to execute the strokes he does.
Whether this be true or not, the fact
remains that some balls which seemingly
are about to hit him are suddenly
turned on one side by the mere flip of
his wrist. He is the bugbear of bowlers,
and his innings of 154 not out for Eng-
land, at Manchester, against the last
Australian Eleven was one of the finest
expositions of batting ever seen. If it
were not for the fact that the Austra-
lian bowlers were enabled to get rid of
the other batsmen in the team on that
occasion, it is verily believed the Prince
would be still batting. When at Cam-
bridge he did not impress the critics
with his batting, no less a personage
than F. S. Jackson openly stated that he
did not think the Prince would ever be-
come a good batsman. In after years
Jackson was generous enough to own he
had made a mistake. Born on the 15th
September, LS72, he is now 25 years of
age.

in a match. Since that time, when he
got his first show as a bowler, he has
never looked back, and until within the
Inst year or so he has enjoyed the dis-
tinction of being one of the three
greatest English bowlers. It is a ques-
tion if he and Peel’s places as left-hand
bowlers have ever been filled. Born on
October 3, 1862, he is 35 years of age.

KRON’S SOLE LEATHER—Is Superior to All Others
J. R. Mason
J. R. Mason, the brilliant young Kent
batsman, was one of the earliest choices
in the team. During the last visit of the
Australians it was said that if the
English team visited Australia in 1897 he
would in all probability accompany it.
is not too much to say that he has
thoroughly earned his place in the team
by a very fine season of batting. He is
the tallest man in the team, standing well
over six feet, but, notwithstanding his
great height, he is very graceful, and no
suggestion of awkwardness is mani-
fested when he is batting, but, on the
other hand, his batting is at all times
brilliant and safe. Without being a
rapid scorer, like Jessop or Lyons, he is,
'*■ -mm,*, j, -f n i * * x ***^**-«»-^ < H
J. K. MA«ON,
nevertheless, quite fast enough to please
the most fastidious. A magnificent slip,
and worthy to rank with-the great
Lohmann. Those who notice very keenly
the characteristics of a man will at once
mark in all things a strong resemblance
to George Lohmann, not in feature but
characteristics. He fields in the slips,
and is every bit as alert as Lohmann was,
and his action in bowling is the same as
the Surry man. He has done some fine
things for his county, and always goe B
in first, and very rarely, if ever, does he
fail to put up a good score. He is just
the sort of cricketer Australians deligh
to see. It was, indeed, a wise move on
the part of his captain to ask him to
come. Although a very fair bowler, it is
not likely, considering the number of
bowlers on the side, he will be called
upon to bowl much in Australia. Born
on March 26, 1874, he is just over 23
years of age.

«F, jr. Kelly
James J. Kelly, who bolds the position
of first wicket-keeper in Australia, is one
who has not quite reached the high
standard in that position that Blackham
did. In fact the standard which the
Victorian wicket-keeper created has not
been approached by any other man in the
same position, living or dead. Kelly for
many years has been one of the most
prominent of our wicket-keepers,but the
fact that Blackham filled the position in
Victoria kept him from taking a high
position behind the world stumpers.
‘Jim” for many years was associated
with the St. Kilda Club, and there were
many good judges on the other side who
averred that he was little if any inferior
to Blackham at that time (1891-2) See-
ing that there was very little prospect of
his getting on in Victoria, he was induced
J. J. KELLY.
Trade Mark: Paw Paw Tree
to come over here and ever since that
time he has been the colony’s stumper.
The crowning achievement of all was hi g
selection to fill the position of first
wicket-keeper to the last Australian
Eleven. At first his selection was passed
over in favor of Johns, but at a subse-
quent meeting of the newly-formed
team it was decided to invite him to
join the band, which for a past season
in England he did very well, having
anything but an easy time taking the
wickets to Jones, nevertheless he can e
out with the fine average of caught 37,
stumped 22, besides getting 493 runs
with the bat for an average of 16T rt ,
Without being a finished or scientific
baf, he is so determined that his true
worth at a batsman is only found out
when things are going against the tide.
His pluck is unquestionable, and his zeal
intense.

Greatest Aid to Digestion, Hunter’s Paw Paw Sauce-
M. A. Noble.
“ Alf” Noble belongs to the younger
generation of Australian cricketers, and
if the past season be any criterion, he
certainly bids fair to become one'of the
very best of batsmen, Picked last year,
as almost the last choice, he did so
famously that he easily came out head
of the averages. He played one superb
innings on the Sydney Ground against
Victoria, when he remained at the
wickets unconqucred for 153, He first
attracted notice during the visit of
Stoddart’s earlier team, when he played
a fine innings of over 150 for the Juniors
against the powerful English side. For
M. A. NOBLE.
some years he has been one of our very
best club cricketers, but he did nothing
extraordinary to warrant the belief that
N.B.W. possessed a batsman who was
likely to worthily follow in the footsteps
of C. Bannerman, Murdoch, &c. But
as was said before, he got his chance
last year, and worthily proved his selec-
tion by a series of long batting triumphs.
He has an exceedingly graceful style of
batting, his forward play being very
neat, and when thoroughly set, he scores
at a great rate. If in anything like the
form he displayed last year, he looks a
very likely candidate for the test
matches. Besides being a good crick-
eter, he possesses a fine baritone voice,
and is a singer of no mean renown.

F. A. Iredale
“ Noss” Iredale, as he is best known
by his intimates, made his dehut in first-
class cricket at the same time and in the
same year as Gregory did (in 1889).
Ever since then he has been one of the
mainstays of New South Wales cricket
and Australia generally. At the present
time he holds records for the most num-
ber of three-figure innings (four) hit by
an Australian in England, most number
of centuries (two) against an English
team touring the colonies, highest soore
(133H0r New South Wales v. England,
and the highest score (187) got by a New
South Wales player against South Aus-
tralia. There was some talk of his being

selected to join the 1893 Australian Ele-
ven, but at the lastrnoment Coningham
was selected in preference, and it was
not until last year that opportunity came
to him to test his prowess on the En-
glish soil That he was a success goes
without saying, and, as his average tes-
tifies, in conjunction with Darling and
Hill, he enjoys the distinction of having
the best average of Australian cricketers
playing on English soil for the first time,
with one exception, Harry Graham,
who, in 1893, headed the list of Austra-
lian Heven averages. I redale is a tall,
upstanding, graceful batsman, and, when
th' rougly set, he scores against all sorts
of bowling Many were of opinion that
the slow wickets of the English grounds
would not suit his style. At first this
seemed more than likely, but after a time
being accustomed to the different pitches
he very soon acquired the art of playing
on them. He enjoys the distinction of
being the safest outfield in Australia.

S. E. Gregory
“ Syd.” Gregory, the greatest of the
Gregory family, and the midget of
Australian cricket, is undoubtedly on
all wickets the greatest of Australi .n
batsmen. He holds the record for the
best average for an Australian during
the English part, having attained that
distinction last year. When you con-
sider his height, it is marvellous how
well he plays the bowling, especially the
fast bowlers’ balls which seem, as it
were, about to strike him, but are easily
turned away by the flick of his wrist.
He, in conjunction with Harry Trott,
gave the finest exhibition of batting
seen last season in England. His score
S E. GREGORY.
on that occasion, although only amount-
ing to 103, represented really more than
the runs convey. Besides being got at
a time when things were going against
the side, they were got against the very
best team England could put on the field,
aid on English ground too. There is
probably no man in the world (if we
alone except Ranjitsinhji) who has the
multiplicity of strokes that Gregory has ;
and his power of scoring on the leg side
is nothing short of marvellous. Ever
since he app-ared in first-class cricket
in 1889, he has excited wonder as a
fieldsman, and at the present time he is
probably the best fieldsman in Australia.
When on his first visit to England in
1890, he drew favorable comment from
the critics for his alertness at every
point. He is a very quiet, unassuming
cricketer, and popular with his fellows.

H. Donnan
Hauky Donnan is quite an old identity
at the game, and, with the sole excep-
tion of T. W. Garrett, is the oldest
number of the N,S.W. Eleven. As far
back as 1888 he was considered one of
Australia’s best batsmen, and it was
considered a very unwise move on the
part of the selectors of the Australian
Eleven that he was omitted from the
1888 team. At one time he was one of
the most brilliant batsmen in Australia,
having superb strokes on the off, which
generally reached the boundary with
lightning rapidity, but of late years he
has adopted a more defensive method.
It was only fitting that after the mag-
nificent season he went through in 1896
11. DONNAN.
he should have been offered a position
in the Australian Eleven, and right
worthily did he fulfil his mission in the
team, coming out with the respectable
average of 23'20, and scoring over 100)
runs. As a cricketer he is one of the
keenest players playing the game, and
consequently ov-r zealousuess causes him
to have friction with his opponents. He
is generous to a fault, a’ d ever ready tj
undo what he has unconsciously done in
hastiness. As a bowler he has a very
easy delivery, and comes very fast off
the pitch, and on some occasions he
goes away with his arm. Although not
reckoned a brilliant fieldsman he is very
energetic, and generally manages to
s ive a large number of runs in the field.
He is not what is called a safe catch,
but he is very persevering, and often
brings off very difficult chances.

“ Alick ” Mackenzie, as he is familiarly
called by his intimates, is one who, to a
certain extent, has not done what is
really expected of him Not that he has
failed in any way; but from his physique,
knowledge and execution, you always
expect something from him, which you
do not get. People are very easily de-

comrades, both in physique and power
of scoring. From the 2nd Juniors he
came right into senior ranks at one
bound. As a club batf man he has al-
ways been one of the most constant
sort, and he rarely fails to make heaps of
runs for his side. As an Intercolonial
representative he has always contributed
a useful quota, but it cannot be said he
ever plays up to the form expected of
him. His highest innings in Inter-
colonial matches is 97, made against
Victoria at Sydney, in January, 1896.
He is one of the very best of fieldsmen,
being very sure as a ground field, and
very rarely, if ever, misses a catch. He
g< nerally goes in first for New South

T. R. McKibbin
“ Tom” McKibbin, as he is usually ad-
dressed, belongs to quite a new gener-
ation of cricketers; and, like Charley
Turner, he was a country player, and
coming, too, from the same district
(Bathurst). Without being egotistical,
it is not too much to say that no bowler
of modern times has excited so much
comment as McKibbin. From the very
first time he made his appearance on the
Association Ground he has been an ob-
ject of curiosity. After a long struggle
nga'nst prejudice, during which time
various opinions were expressed as to
his ability to bowl well against good
batsmen, and especially on slow wickets,
he came out of the ordeal safely, and

last year, by winning the blue ribbon on
both Australian and English soil, he
earned the proud distinction of be-
ing the champion Au tralian trundler.
There is no bowler living who can com-
mand the same amount of break as he
can, and on wickets which help him his
power to turn the ball is nothing short
of marvellous. Even Dr. Grace, who
has seen many good bowlers in his time,
has asserted that he does not know of a
bowler in his experience who can make
the ball do as much as McKibbin. With
the last Australian Eleven, although
starting badly, he wound up the tour by
winning the average, some of his work
in England being very meritorious. A
right-handed medium pace bowler ; be

V. Trumper.
“Victor” Trumper, the dashing bats-
man of the Paddington team, is one who
plays tne game in a style which, to the
onlooker, is always pleasing. Of all
those young batsmen who, just now, are
beginning so prominently in New South
Wales cricket, Trumper presents the
most finished style. To look at him
batting yon could hardly pick a flaw in
it, and whether it be against fast, med-
ium pace, or slow bowling, and on any
kind of wicket he is equally at home,
and his strokes are all finished. People
who have seen him batting wonder how
it is he was not included in the repre-
sentative team. This is not to be won-
dered at, as his style, execution and
certainty are not of an aspirant for first-

class honors, but rather that of a veteran.
During the visit of Stoddart’s first term,
Trumper, playing forthe juniors against
that powerful organisation, scored an
almost perfect innings of over 50, and
although Noble, who played in that
match, made three times the number o
runs Trumper did, the English cricketers
were more surprised with Trumpet’s
batting than with Noble’s, and no less
a personage than than Stoddart himself
expressed the belief that Trumper would
some day develop into one of our very
best cricketers. Like Mackenzie, when
playing junior cricket, Trumper towered
well above all his comrades, and it was
thought that it was only a question of
time before he took his place amongst
the experienced cricketers of New South
Wales. He is an exceedingly unassum-
ing player, and consequently very popu-

“Lou” Poidevin belongs to the
younger generation of batsmen in New
South Wales, and, although one of our
very best club cricketers, he has not had,
so far, an opportunity of showing his
worth in good company. True that he
represented his colony against Queens,
land i i April last year, scoring on that
occasion a very fair innings of 36. It is
as a club cricketer that he is best known.
There is no cricketer playing in New
South Wales who scores so consistently
and well as he does, and it is astonish-
ing the number of runs he makes for his
club. Kno ving what a fine club

f >r New South Wales in a season when
the colony is rich in young blood, and

Of all our most prominent junior ciicket-

brilliant with club, he gave sufficient
token of his powers as a batsman, which

hear of him playing with the Hawkes-
bury district, but he was generally
recognised as a bowler more than as a
batsman. From the Hawkesbury he
joined the Paddington Club, but the
change from the matting wickets to the
turf apparently did not suit him, and he
did little or nothing with this Club.
Joining the Central Cumberland Club,
he had more opportunity of playing on
the turf, and in the first year of his
playing for this club he did very well.
From that time he has not looked back,
but has gone on developing the powers
which he possesses. It would be hard
to find a more energetic, enthusiastic
cricketer, and he is so fond of the game
that he hardly cares what trouble he
goes to, so long as he is enabled to play
the game. As a bowler he is fairly
good; bowls a fast ball, with a curl from
leg.

able after all. These batsmen have proved that the mastery
of the game is well nigh possible, but even with Grace, the
most reliable of players, we know that all heroes of the
willow sometimes collapse for the unappreciated “ duck.”
Cricketers and others cannot expect to always feel in the
necessary condition to do great feats, and that is where the
phenomenal scoring done by Or. Morse’s Indian
Root; Pills comes in. Whether taken as a pick-me-up
or to conquer disease they score in every case. Take the
case of Mr. H. Samuels of Newcastle, employed by the ship
chandler, Mr. James Clarke. When interviewed he said that
a few weeks ago he was unable to walk without the aid
of two canes, sometimes being so bad that he was driven to
business in a cab. His blood was out of order and he suf-
fered excruciating pains in his kidneys and from sciatica.
He tried many medicines and external applications but with
no beneficial results. He had heard of the remarkable virtues
of Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills and was
strongly recommended to use them. The marvellous result
was that a few doses took away all pain and left him in
sound health and strength. These cases speak to all, and
don’t forget this great score in the excitement of the scores
made by world-famed batsmen.

Cricket “ Chips. ”
Murdoch is the only Australian who has made over 300 in a first-
class match. He scored 321 for New South Wales v. Victoria, in 1882.
Against an Australian Eleven in England, Gloucestershire 17, at
Chiltenham, in August 1896.
About the same time another singular incident took place on the
Eling Cricket Ground, in a match between that club and the Totton
Tradesmen. A ball hit the wickets, and made one of the bails fly
up in the air. Strange to relate, it fell back again on the wickets,
and the bowler would certainly think it rather hard lines when the
batsman was given “ not out,”
A curious hit once resulted in 93 runs being made. This occurred
during a match on Peckham Rye, between the Peckham Pushers and
Camberwell Albion. The Albion went in first and totalled up 129
runs, and left only 55 minutes for play. Then the Pushers com-
menced. and the first ball fell in a tree and lodged in a rook's nest.
As it could be seen all the time it could not be regarded as a 4 lost
ball,” so while the fieldsmen were getting it the batsmen were busy
making runs, and totted up 98. They ultimately made the
remainder of the runs, and won with four wickets in hand.
The Australians, however, have beaten this under very similar
circumstances, in a match played at Bunbury, between a Victorian
team and a scratch eleven from the neighbourhood. The first ball
on this occasion lodged on a three-pronged branch of a tall tree, and
although “ lost ball ” was called in this case, the umpire ruled that
it could be seen, and was therefore, not lost. The difficulty then
was to get the ball. An axe was sent for to cut down the tree, but
one could not be obtained. Then a rifle was tiied, and after several
misses the ball was brought down. In the meantime the Victorians
had run up a score of 286 for the one hit!

A cricket writer, commenting on the ages of players, says it would
not be very difficult for a team of players under 30 to be got
together good enough to play against a team of men above that age.
The following statistics should prove interesting:—

Animals have frequently gone to the assistance of the cricketer.
In a match played on Peckham Rye, in 1894, a big hit was made to
leg, and a retriever, seeing the ball, made for it, and carried it off
in his mouth Three fieldsmen went hotly in pursuit, but the dog
had the lead for a quarter of a mile While this was being done
the batsmen were running, and when the ball was returned to the
field they had scored 54 runs.

The highest score ever got by a New South Wales batsman in the
England v. New South Wales matches is 133, by F. A. Iredale. in
1894.
Ihe world’s record for the first wicket score is held by W. Brock-
well and Robert Abel, of Surrey County, who scored 379 before
being parted. The match was Surrey v. Hampshire, at Kennington
Oval, and the time last season.
The previous best was put up by J. T. Brown audTunnicliffe, who,
for Yorkshire against Sussex, scored 378 runs, or one run less than
the present record. Strange that the record should have been
broken twice in the one season.
The highest total on record in any match is 922, by Carlton v.
University, at Melbourne, February 1896.
The smallest total on record in a first-class match is 12, by
Oxford University*). M. C. C. and Ground, May 1877.
In 13 matches at Lord’s, where he was one of the professional
bowlers, A. E. Trott scored 497 runs, and took 140 wickets at a
cost of 1313 runs, an average of 9 - 53 per wicket. In all matches
Trott captured 363 wickets. From SM. Herald , Sept 2, 1897.

Prince Ranjitsiuhji scored an aggregate of 1,940 runs last year.
H-id he been able to pay in one or two more matches of last
season’s English cricket, he would have, in all probability, ac-
hieved the uncommon distinction of getting over 2.000 runs for the
season in successive years.
Alfred Shaw, in the match Notts v. Gloucestershire, in 1884, per-
formed the “ hat trick ” in each innings.
Mead, the Essex bowler, always folds up his shirt-sleeves so that
they bulge. This affects the sight of the batsmen.
The slowest innings ever played by Kumar Shri Ranjitsinhji was
for Sussex against Essex, at Leyton. He scored 9in nearly an hour.
J. J. Lyons, of South Australia, ranks with the late Percy
McDonnell and Bonnor as one of the greatest hitters the world has
produced. The best innings of his life was against M.C.C at
Lords in 1893, when he scored 149, and was accorded a flattering
ovation. The innings which appealed most to Australians was
in Sydney against Lord Sheffield’s team, when he scored 134 by
magnificent batting, and with the assistance of the plodding Alec
Bannerman pulled the game out of the fire. He is a well-built
man and one of the most popular figures on Antipodean ovals. He
was selected for the test match against England.

By his performance this season of getting over 2,000 runs, being
the third season in succession, “Bobby” Abel has now the proud
distinction of being the only cricketer who ever achieved that feat.
Not even by W. G. Grace himself has it been accomplished.
The highest score ever made by an English player in a first-class
match in Australia is 232 by A. Shrewsbury, for Lillywhite’s team
v. Victoria, at Melbourne, in 1888.
A. E. Stoddart, 173 in the second test match in Melbourne, in
1894, is the highest score ever made by an English player in test
matches. The highest score made by an Australian is 211, by
W. L. Murdoch, at the Oval, in 1884.
For appointments, ground, and general arrangements, the
Sydney Cricket Ground is acknowledged to be the finest ground of
its kind in the world.
The finest team which has been banded together in Australia, and
played in England, was the 1882 team, the order of merit with suc-
cessive teams being —1896, 1884, 1888, 1890, 1886.
A. E. Stoddart’s 485 is the highest score on record—Hampstead
v. Stoics, August, 1886.
The highest score in a first-class match was made by A. 0.
McLaren, for Lancashire v. Somersetshire, 424, at Taunton, July,
1895.
W. Howell, for New South Wales against Stoddart’s English
Eleven, took 5 wickets for 44 runs, on a perfect wicket.
The smallest total ever got by an Australian Eleven in England
is 18, against M. C. 0, and Ground, at Lord’s, in 1896.

Surrey have won every match this year in which they have won
the toss.
F. G. J Ford is one of seven brothers who are all over six feet 1
He is known to his intimates as “ Stork.” He possesses great
strength, but is physically weak about the knees.
In a game played at Vincent Square, Westminster, in 1836, a
stump was hit, but the sun melted the varnish on the bail, and
caused it to adhere, and so the batsman pleasantly went on with
his innings.
In the match between Notts and Middlesex, at Lord’s this season,
all the Middlesex players, except the captain and wicket-keeper,
bowled. In the second innings nine Middlesex men bowled.
History repeats itself. In ) 896, at Derby, Storer, for Derbyshire
against Yorkshire, scored 100 not out in the second innings. Again,
in the second innings this season, Storer scored 104 not out.
An incident of the same kind once happened at the Oval when
Wood, the Surrey wicket-keeper, appealed for a stumping against
Mr Stoddart, of Middlesex, The umpire said “ Out,” but Mr.
out that the bails had not been knocked off. So
of course, he stayed, and he made a lot of runs afterwards.
Wood had another incident with Middlesex batsmen —this time
at Lord’s. He was behind Sir T. 0. O’Brien, who was playing to
the lobs of W. W. Read. O’Brien missed one of these, and the
wicket was found broken, but Sir Timothy protested that the
wicket-keeper must have put the wicket down with his boot.
And the umpire agreed with him.
An amusing incident occurred during this year’s Tonbridge
Week, when Kent were playing Middlesex, Mr. Webbe, the
Middlesex captain, was appealed against for a catch by the
wicket-keeper, who joyfully threw up the ball. But the umpire
said “Not out! ” and Mr. Webbe turned round and lectured the
offending player.
It is not likely that any batsman will this year succeed in beating
Kumar Shri Ranjitsinhji’s record number of runs for a season, made
last season, when he scored 2,780 tuns, the next best being W. G.
grace’s 2,739 in 1871.
There is a painful coincidence in matches between Lancashire and
Derbyshire, from the point of view of Storer, the famous Derbyshire
wicket-keeper. In season 1896, Storer was dismissed for a pair of
spectacles by Lancashire, on each occasion being clean bowled by
Mold for 0. This season Lancashire again dismissed Storer for a
pair, and he was this time twice clean bowled by Briggs. In 1896,
Storer made some atonement by scoring a century in the return
match. He cannot do this in 1897, for the two games have now
been played.
C. W. Alcock, the secretary of the Surrey County Cricket Club,
has seen every match at the Oval since his appointment except one,
and then he was ill in bed. On that occasion Mr. A. N. Hornby
came to see him in his flannels, and so Mr. Alcock felt that he was
in the little room at the pavilion as usual On one occasion, Mr.
Alcock was going to unlock a cupboard, when a ball, hit by Bonnor
off Ramsay, came soaring into the room, after striking the cornice
in front of the window. It knocked the keys out of his hand, and
smashed the old picture of Kent v Sussex match.
