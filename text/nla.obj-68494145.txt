possible to overrate the importance to this country of the great continent of
Australia. When the Eoyal Geographical Society was first instituted, forty
years ago, nothing was known of Australia except a few square miles in the
vicinity of the chief towns; hut at the present time scarcely any part of it
had not been visited. Of late the great object had been to discover fresh
pasture lands for sheep-feeding. It was a most important feat when Macdouall
Stuart crossed the continent from the south to the north along the line where
the telegraph now runs. This was in 1859, and since then the great desire
of explorers had been to traverse the intermediate country between Stuart?s
route and the West Coast.
In the course of the last thirty years, on no less than ten different occasions
the Society?s Gold Medal had been awarded to geographers for explorations in
Australia. Mr. Eyre received the medal in 1843; it was next awarded to
Count Strzelecki, who was the real discoverer of the gold deposits of Australia ;
next, to Captain Charles Sturt, to whom geographers were very greatly
indebted, and Dr. Leichhardt Mr. Augustus Gregory received the medal in
1857, and Mr. Macdouall Stuart in 1861, he having been presented with a gold
watch for his previous exploration in 1859. The medal was awarded to the
unfortunate O?Hara Burke, after his death, in 1862 ; and Mr. John King, who
was with him, received a gold watch. Mr. Frank Gregory received a medal
in 1863, and the list was closed with the name of Colonel Warburton, who
had been awarded the medal this year, and to whose indomitable energy,
perseverance, and capacity for personal endurance, it was mainly owing that
his expedition was finally successful.
Journey across the Western Interior of Australia.
Colonel P. Egertox Warburtox spoke as follows :?Mr. President
and gentlemen of the Eoyal Geographical Society : My first duty
is to return my sincere thanks to the Society for the honour
they have done me in presenting me with their gold medal. I need
not dwell upon the gratification which that presentation afforded
to me personally and to my numerous circle of friends; but I may
say that I think and I hope that it will act as an incentive to others
in Australia to do far more than has been already done. Though
last on the list of those who have been honoured with the Society?s
medal, I am, I think, the second from South Australia who has
received it, the only one previously being John Macdouall Stuart,
of whose name all South Australians are justly proud, for he ac-
complished a most wonderful feat. In what I have to say I hope
I shall not be accused of boasting, when I assure you that the
journey we went through was well nigh proving too hard for
us. It was by the merciful interposition of Providence alone that
our lives were saved ?but there was nothing whatever to spare.
We got off with our lives, and our lives only; and therefore all
boasting or vain-glory would be absurd. We had to start from ? Alice
Springs,? in very near the centre of Australia, and having once
started, we were not permitted, nor, I believe, did any of us wish,
to look back. We had no fresh horses, no fresh camels, no fresh


provisions, nothing at all to help us. Our first start was our last
start. I am very sorry to say I have not my journal here, and
am obliged to trust to a few heads of notes to help a bad memory,
and I scarcely know what subjects will be most acceptable to the
Meeting.
There are, no doubt, a great many misapprehensions entertained
in England with regard to Australian things. I gather this from the
fact that, in conversation with me, one gentleman, endeavouring to
obtain information, supposed I had not met with many navigable
rivers. I think that was pretty well. Another gentleman supposed
that, though our provisions failed, no doubt we had plenty of beer
and wine; but the deepest of all cuts was when a young gentleman
supposed that I had a guide to show me the way across, I need not
dwell upon these little matters, for no doubt you will readily see that
they were very great misapprehensions ; but, on the other hand, I
must remark that either the physical geography of Australia has
such very peculiar features that no language could be found to
describe them, or else that we Australians are particularly happy in
giving misnomers to everything. Eor instance, it is common for us
to talk of dry creeks. We have rivers without any water in them.
We have very large lakes, over the dry beds of which the dust is
blowing; and I see by the papers in Mr. Ross?s report, alluded to
by Sir Henry Eawlinson, that he fell in with a great many pools,
but they had no water: so that, of course, we have a great deal to
answer for with regard to the misapprehensions entertained in
England.
Perhaps you are aware that the distance from Adelaide to Alice
Springs is, in round numbers, about 1100 miles. We sent on our
camels and the bulk of our provisions ahead, while myself and
two companions?my eldest son and Mr. Lewis?followed on horse-
back, the horses carrying provisions for ourselves. We had a
very pleasant ride, and experienced no difficulties. We followed
the track of the Telegraph line and got to Alice Springs about the
end of December. On my arrival there, I was assured by everybody
who was acquainted with the country that it was utterly im-
possible for me to start then, because in the course of a fortnight, at
the furthest, the summer tropical rains would be sure to fall; and
that, as they lasted for three months with very little intermission,
the ground would become so very boggy that neither horse, camel,
nor anything at all, could traverse it; and that, if I did start, I
should only be able to go a very short distance, and then have to stop.
Not being acquainted with the country myself, I was obliged, of
course, to follow this advice; and therefore I had to send some


of my party back to Adelaide, to get a new supply of stores to
meet the expenditure at Alice Springs. It so happens that ex-
ploring expeditions in Australia are almost always started in
seasons of drought. Why such seasons are selected, I do not
know, yet so it is; and I waited there for nearly four months,
and no rain at all fell: but as I had detached some of my party, I
was compelled to wait until they returned. I had, therefore, the
pleasure of spending the tropical summer under a bit of calico,
with nothing to do, and the thermometer at 110�. On the 15th
April we were enabled to start, and so long as we continued to the
north of the McDonnell Ranges we had Very pleasant work. Water
was to be got without any great difficulty; there was grass and
bushes, and everything that we liked?in fact, it was what we call
a good country. By that expression I do not mean good, fat,
arable land, but country that would just carry stock, with some
water and some grass. The McDonnell Ranges extend to two
hundred miles, and as soon as we got clear of them our difficulties
began. The water failed, the grass turned into spinifex, and the
soil turned into sand; so that we were compelled to use all our
wits to get on at all. The first portion of our journey after we left
the McDonnell Range was not, however, so bad as the last portion.
There is water, but Europeans?or at any rate we ?could not
find it. It is met with in very small holes made by the natives
in the sand. There are but few natives there, and they get out
about a jug of water at a time; but, of course, as we ? started with
17 camels, to water them all required rather more than a black
fellow wants to drink. When we were fortunate enough to find one
of these holes, we therefore had to dig out the well. The natives
gave us very much trouble, because they did not like us; they
were afraid of us, and we never could succeed in catching one, which
we wanted to do, in order that by keeping him without water he
might be compelled to show us where it was to be got. They were,
however, too clever for us, and too quick for us. They saw us
before we could see them, and they escaped. We did, on one occa-
sion, manage to catch an urchin and put him on a camel; but he
either was so frightened as not to show his fright or he was
not frightened at all, for he did not appear to care much about it.
We found water without him, and therefore let him go, and he crept
away like a fox, thinking he had escaped from us and that we
wanted to keep him?when we did not. On another occasion we
caught a young gill about 17, and, barbarous as it may seem, 1
must tell you that we tied her by a good thick hair-rope to a tree;
but she gnawed the rope through with her teeth and escaped us.


liat was more, she ran away upon her toes, so that we could not
track her much; and though I immediately put as good trackers as
any in Australia on her trail, yet we failed to catch her again.
The only other native that wo succeeded in catching was a terrible
old witch?hideous beyond all conception, and noisy enough to do
anything. Having been cheated by the young girl, we thought
to make quite sure of the old woman, so we tied her thumbs
behind her back, and put a rope around her neck; but notwith-
standing this, we were obliged to keep watch over her by turns
during the whole night. I tell you this to show how excessively
cunning they are; and we did not get any good out of any of
them.
Perhaps the state of the natives might be a little interesting to
you. They are, I think, the very lowest in the scale of humanity,
and I cannot conceive how anjqhing could fall much lower. They
do not even take the trouble to put a few bushes up to shelter them-
selves from the sun or the rain?when it does rain, though I
don?t know' when, for I didn?t see it?but the sun is hot enough.
They get on the shady side of a bush when the sun is too hot for
them, and when it rains I suppose they go to the lee side. The
gentlemen take the shank bone, about 9 inches long, of the
wallabi?a kind of marsupial hare?and wdien it is lubricated
nicely in the mouth they pass it through the cartilage of the nose,
and it sticks out; and having done that, they are in full dress. I
do not know anything more that is wanted. Of the ladies? dress
I say nothing, and for this simple reason, that there is nothing
at all to say anything about!
Another subject that perhaps may interest you is to be found
in the camels. Most surely no other animal in creation could have
carried us across. For hundreds of miles there was not a blade of
grass, nothing that any animal, bullock, donkey, horse, could possi-
bly feed upon; nothing but the tops of the bushes which the camels
managed to browse. No animal but the camel could have served
our turn. I say this with confidence, because every other animal
which has been tried has failed, and this is the sixth expedition.
These camels are most patient and easily managed, but it is gene-
rally requisite to have a master amongst them. There is one
master, a bull-camel, who always establishes himself at the head of
the party; and so long as he is in good spirits and able to move about,
all the younger ones are kept in admirable order; but directly
he falls sick, they become exceedingly troublesome. Amongst
other misfortunes, we were unlucky enough to have our master-
bull eat something that disagreed with him, and we had no medicine


to give him except a chance bottle of mustard. It did not do him
any good ; but before we ourselves were aware that this master-bull
was at all sick, the young bulls were all acquainted with it and were
jumping about in most lively style. The necessity of having a comp-
troller, a President over the camels, will be apparent when I tell you
that the trick the young ones have is to cut off two or three female
camels and run them away as hard as they can ; so that we were
obliged to knee-halter them and tie them as tight as we could, or
else we should have left our bones in the sand, because all our camels
would have run away from us in little troops. However, they
certainly behaved well to us when we did not give them the oppor-
tunity of doing the reverse.
Perhaps you would like to learn, too, what sort of eating they
make. Unfortunately, we had to eat seven of them. I daresay
when the animal is fat and well fed on oilcake and other things, it
cannot be very bad ; but when he has been worked to that extent
that he is unable to stand, and is shot only because it would be a
pity to leave him to rot, his meat is not very good, and it is inter-
laced with large sheets of parchment. He looks a very large
animal, but there is very little meat on him. He is more bone
than anything else; and I can assure you that of all the buckets of
meat?for the bucket was our cooking-vessel?that we cooked when
a camel was killed, never, in any single instance that I can re-
member, was there one single bubble of grease on the surface.
The head is somewhat of a delicacy, and the feet are really very
good, for his condition does not affect his feet very much. In our
distress, however, we were obliged to eat him, inside and outside
too; and his hide is pretty good when you cannot get anything
else: but if anybody here has had the boldness to taste the contents
of a carpenter?s glue-pot, it comes to very much the same thing.
We were compelled, by absolute starvation, to eat our last camel all
but the hair?clean through from end to end ; and after the bones
had been lying in the sand some days, they were broken up to make
broth of, and, in the course of a short time, I don?t think any of
the animal was to be seen. The advantage of the camel is, that he
can work until he cannot work any longer, and then you can eat
him.
Perhaps one of our greatest misfortunes connected with the camels
was, that a good many of them were struck with the land-wind at
night in the loins, so that when we got up at three or four o?clock
in the morning it was reported that this camel or that camel could not
move. Of course every camel we lost was a reduction?and a very
considerable one?in the chance of our saving our lives; and, there-


fore, sucli an accident would be a thing to be guarded against in
future by covering the camels. When it was too late we took the
precaution ; but many of our camels were dead or ruined before we
knew anything at all about it. No Australian bushman ever
thinks himself badly off if he has a quart pot, a blanket for him-
self, a pair of hobbles for his horse, and a little flour, tea, sugar,
and tobacco for provisions. Our lives depended on the welfare of
the camels, and whenever a camel even looked sick our march was
delayed; for, though hunger pressed us on, we were compelled to sit
down until that camel got well?then our provisions were consumed
to a considerable extent in idleness on our part waiting to restore
the camels, because we dared not go on while the camel was ailing.
I took six months? provisions with me, but that turned out to be
too little, though I do not think I am much to blame for it, because
my calculations were based on a certain distance, and I allowed fox-
detentions and digressions; but the detentions were so frequent and
great that we ran short of provisions, and at the end we had no
flour, no tea, no sugar. The only thing we had was the miserable
meat scraped off the bones of a half-dead camel, and put on the
bushes and dried in the sun. We had that, and nothing whatever
with it. It will, therefore, be readily understood that we did not
grow fat or gain much strength. Whilst the camels were tolerably
good we were able to travel during the daytime, and therefore, of
course, had the use of our eyes and the chance of finding water by
running up native tracks ; but when the summer began, that is,
about September?when our provisions ran short and our camels
began to fail?the heat became so excessive that we dared not travel
through the day. The camels would have been knocked up in the
course of two days, and we would have been left in the desert. We
were therefore compelled to travel in the dark, when it was a little
cooler, and the consequence was, that we were cut off from our chance
of finding water during our march. When we came to our halt for
the day the camels were so tired that we were unable to go out and
look about us. Not only were we thus compelled to seek our rest in
the daytime, but the greatest annoyance perhaps of all was caused by
those little insignificant insects, the ants: they gave us no peace.
It was impossible to go on the shady side of the bush without
being immediately covered. We could not sit down or attempt to
write or make any calculations without being literally covered with
these creatures. We had to travel all night and we could not sleep
in the day, which was another thing that caused us to fall into such
a miserable state. When our hopes became x-ather depressed, the
best thing we thought we could do was to stay some time at one


place where there was water, recruit our camels as much as possible,
and then risk all upon a final rush to reach the Oakover River, where
we were sure of water. It was a subject of very much deliberation
with me, and of great anxiety. Of course, it was neck or nothing.
The distance was about 160 or 170 miles, and if the camels could
reach that distance, well and good ; if they could not, we should
fall. But there was no alternative. We could not sit down there
and starve, and we thought we might as well die in going as in
sitting still. But we were unable to do that; and but for the inter-
position of Providence in bringing us on two occasions to water, we
certainly never could have got through it. Water was found by
our companion, Charley?a black fellow, whom we took with us
from Alice Springs, and a very good boy he was. One morning he
left us without saying a word. None of us knew where he was. We
were greatly alarmed, for he was a favourite. I was in great per-
plexity at his non-return. There were six of us there. It was
death to stay, and it seemed a most cruel and inhuman thing to leave
the poor lad. We, therefore, did not know what to do, and, as a com-
promise, I stayed two or three hours, and at nine o?clock, whether
he came or not, I decided that we must go. He did not come,
and we started; we had bells on our camels? necks to make a little
noise, and in the middle of the night, about eleven or twelve o?clock,
we heard what in Australia is called a cooeey?a voice calling to us?
and we were inexpressibly delighted to find our black boy cheerily
turn up. He came at right angles upon us. It is evident that had
we started off an hour later he would have crossed our track and
missed us. Had we been at all earlier we should have passed the
point, and he would have gone behind us. It was too dark to see
our tracks, but it so happened under Providential dispensation that
we exactly cut each other. He had been to a native camp, and
had got information about water; so we immediately sat down and
drank all that we had with us, and then we went on to the new
supply, and that gave us a fresh start. On a subsequent occasion
the poor lad?as he was willing to go single-handed to a native
camp, we keeping the animals and the rest of the party out of
sight so that the natives might not be alarmed?was treated
very kindly, and they gave him water, he, no doubt, thinking that
the negotiation was amicably settled; but the instant they saw
the camels they were, I suppose, frightened, and imagined that
some treachery was intended against them, so they put one spear
through his back and another through his arm, and hit him a blow
on the head that would have split half-a-dozen European skulls,
and they nearly broke his jaw. Of course we rescued him, and the


natives were driven off as soon as the camels could come up. The
lad, I am happy to say, recovered, and he is now in my house in
Australia?or was there?doing exceedingly well, Ido not know
whether you are aware of it?it may seem a very trifling thing,?
hut a black fellow?s skull is about five times the thickness of a
European?s. It really is. Ido not mean as to his intelligence, for
there I dare say he is as sharp as any of us, but I mean in actual
thickness; and unless it were so, Ido not know how he could possiblv
sustain the blows with most massive clubs that are administered on
his head.
I never had the pleasure of seeing one of the women?s skulls;
but I imagine that they must be even thicker than the men?s, for
they have to endure even more blows.
I must not trespass longer upon your time, except to give you
a faint description of our miserable condition just at the last.
We had succeeded in our object; we had traversed the whole of
the unknown country, and were located on Frank Gregory?s furthest
point, on the Oakover. We had reached that water by a miserable
night march, in which I, being somewhat too old for the work,
was obliged to be strapped to the back of a camel, because I could
neither sit nor stand. We reached that point, but were not able
to go any further. We had eaten the greater part of our camels,
and had only three left. One could not work at all, and the question
with us was how we were to get from that point to a station
which we thought existed somewhere on the De Grey, though we
did not know where. It turned out that this station was 170
miles away from us. We had no beasts to carry us; we were
utterly unable to walk 100 yards; and therefore it was quite clear
we could not have got down in the ordinary way, I therefore
took the two camels that were tolerably capable of work, and sent
the two strongest of our party down the river to look for the
station, and to endeavour, as a last resource, to procure some pro-
visions, and beasts to carry us. During their absence we lay there
on the bank of the Oakover, which at that time had not a drop of
water in it. We had, however, a water-hole separate from the
river. We lay there for a great many days, not knowing when our
party would come back. Sometimes we caught a bird, and there
were plenty of fish in the water-hole close by our side. We had
hooks and lines, but they would not bite, and we had no net;
so we saw the fish, and knew they were there, whilst we were
starving. There were also plenty of ducks about, but they would
not settle on that water where we were, and we could not walk
after them, though we had powder and shot. Day by day we


went down for "bathing, but for nothing else; and we were being
cruelly starved to death. To show you what changes are met
with in Australia, I may mention that the bed of the Oakover at
that point was 300 or 400 yards in width; but there was not a
drop of water in it, and probably there had not been for a long
time. We went to bed one night, when the channel of the river
was quite empty, but at 3 o?clock in the morning it was full to the
bank, with plenty of ducks and large trees, borne along by the
current, floating on its surface. It was then a splendid river. The
party that I had sent down behaved admirably. They reached
Messrs. Grant, Harper, and Anderson?s station, where they were
received with the greatest kindness. Horses and provisions were
at once supplied, and to the liberality and promptitude of these
gentlemen we entirely owe our lives. Not only did we receive
such kindness from individuals, but we were treated in the same
manner by every community we passed through. We were re-
garded by the Government as guests of Western Australia from the
moment we set foot on the inhabited parts. We were franked back
to our own shores, close to the seaport of Adelaide; and I owe
the authorities a very great debt of gratitude, which I take this
opportunity of expressing. If there be any point upon which I
have failed to make myself understood, I shall be happy to give
explanations, if Sir Henry will kindly tell me what the Meeting
would most like to hear.
Sir Chaeles Nicholson asked Colonel Warburton to give some details as to
the vegetation and geology of the country through which he had passed. The
region traversed by Macdouall Stuart was of the most unpromising kind, and
he was frequently in danger of perishing for want of water, Burke and Wills
died of starvation in a country now occupied by sheep-runs, and which
possessed all the physical conditions necessary for supplying human wants.
He therefore wished to ask Colonel Warburton, if, notwithstanding the
barren character of the country which he had passed through, he thought it
possible that in time portions of it might not be made available for pasturage ?
Colonel Egeeton Waebueton replied : Unfortunately I am neither a
geologist nor a botanist, and therefore cannot give any scientific account of
the matter ; but certainly a great part of the country which Stuart went over,
so far as the south of Alice Springs is concerned, is most excellent pasturage
country, with plenty of water and good grass all along the Stephenson.
Around Alice Springs there are now cattle-stations, and to the north of the
McDonnell ranges the country is fit for stock. That celebrated explorer
Sturt had a theory that the centre of Australia was a depressed basin. Un-
fortunately my barometer?and I had only one ?went wrong; and as I did
not know when it w.ent wrong, I cannot tell up to what date its readings were
to be trusted, though they were taken carefully every day. The foot of the
McDonnell Range is about 2700 or 3000 feet above the level of the sea.
Neither I nor any of my party was sensible of any descent on the north side,
nnd I think the part I traversed is high sandy tableland, and certainly I
VOL. XIX. E


should say that none of that land is likely to be occupied for a great many
generations. Nothing but the direst necessity could ever induce a man to go
there ; for, in the first place, he would have to introduce some kind of grass, and
he would have to carry for an immense distance every single article of food that
he required, except meat. There are no animals there?not even a wild dog.
there is no water. I got the bones of a dog out of one well, but that only
showed what a silly dog he was to go there. There is no animal except the
wallaby, which can do without water. I can assure you that when we killed
a camel there was not a single kite or bird of any kind that had the curiosity
to come and see what we were doing. The natives live on this little wallaby.
They burn the spinifex grass, and the instant the wallaby comes out they
shoot it with a short stick. Besides the wallaby they may catch a snake or
lizard.
Mr. Bell asked whether there were any kangaroos ?
Colonel Egerton Warburton. ?Neither kangaroos nor emus, nor any single
animal of any utility. I have seen the wallabies in the hands of the natives,
but I never saw one on the ground.
Sir George Campbell asked what the natives fed on ?
Colonel Egerton Warburton.? There is a small acacia-seed, which is
very black and as hard as a little bit of granite, and on these the natives
feed also?it is their vegetable diet; and we ate them, roasting them
on a tin-plate, and then cracking them up, sometimes between two stones, and
sometimes with our teeth. There were plenty of casuarina-trees, and a tree
called the Leichhardt or walnut-tree; but its fruit is harder than stones, and
cannot be eaten.
Mr. Francis Galton asked Colonel Warburton if the natives had been
troublesome on many occasions ?
Colonel Egerton Warburton.? Only on one occasion: I was on foot, and
got out of the track. The camels were coming behind me, and hearing a little
noise I looked round, and found nine natives with spears close to me. Two of
them, young men, in order to show their zeal for the work, had their spears
poised to throw at me; but, as reports travel great distances out there, I
suppose they had heard of the wonderful effects of firearms, and when I
advanced on them with my pistol they lowered their spears. There were a
few old men amongst them, and by dint of passing our hands over each other?s-
grey beards, to see that they were not tied on, we got on amicably. That
was the only time I met them. They were afraid of us, and ran away from
us. We caught an urchin once ; but it was by chasing a mother, who had this
child and an infant on her back. The camel, not liking to be separated from
its fellows, bellowed frightfully, and this alarmed her so that she dropped the-
big child and ran off with the little one.
Mr. Woods asked what were the physical and geological features of the
country passed through, and if a sandy desert prevailed for the greater part ?
Colonel Egerton Warburton,?l think the last water we passed was
about Ethel Creek. There are no mountains, only high sand-ridges, varying
in height from 40 to 50 and even 100 feet, running in parallel lines, so that
when you are riding between them you can see nothing at all. When you
get to the top of them you can only see the next sand-ridge.
Mr. Eusden asked what was the height of the casuarina and other trees,
and, if they were so numerous that, when looked at from the distance, they
had the appearance of forests ? In looking from one hill to the trees on
another, for instance, did the hill looked at present the appearance of a wood
or forest ?
Colonel Warburton. ?We passed through several what I may call
casuarina forests, but they were all on the low ground. I should think the trees
must have been about 30 feet high, with straight stems without branches,


admirably adapted for telegraph-posts, if there were any means of getting at
them.
The President said that he had omitted any reference to Mr. Hamilton
Hume, whose services the Society greatly appreciated, because he was not a
gold medallist, and in the list he had given he only referred to those who
had received the Society?s medal. The Society ought also to take notice of
the liberality of the two gentlemen, the Hon. Mr. Elder and Mr. Hughes,
private citizens of Australia, who organised the expedition at their own ex-
pense. The cause of geography was very much indebted to them. It was
important, too, to remember that, wherever the central region had been tapped,
the same results had been obtained. Mr. Gosse, Mr. Giles, and the Forrests
had all arrived at just the same conclusion as Colonel Warburton, that the
country was absolutely uninhabitable. Colonel Warburton richly deserved
the medal which had been awarded him. He had displayed extraordinary
personal energy and endurance, and, in the name of the Society, he (the
President) thanked him for the pleasure he had afforded the Meeting by
his description of his journey, wishing him at the same time health and
happiness when he returned to Australia.
Mention was made by the President of the various other Expeditions to
the Interior of Western Australia, of which the following brief accounts have
been communicated to the Society.
Mr. W. C. Gosse?s Explorations, 1873.
Mr. Gosse gives the following summary of his Journey, in the
introduction to his Eeport and Diary addressed to the Surveyor-
General of South Australia; ?
? Sir, ? February Ist, 1874.
? I have the honour to enclose, for the information of the
Honourable the Commissioner of Crown Lands and Immigration, the
diary and map of my exploration; also to report that, leaving the
Alice Springs, April 21st, with a party consisting of four white men,
three Affghans, and a black boy, I travelled along the telegraph
line to latitude 22� 28's., about forty miles south of Central Mount
Stuart.
? From this point I followed the Eeynolds Eange about w.n.w.
for forty-five miles; I was then obliged to turn s.w., passing a
high bluff, piled by Major Warburton, and on to the western
extremity of the MacDonnell Eanges (Giles?s Mount Liebig).
? Here I was compelled to turn south, crossing Mr'. Giles?s track
several times, the eastern arm of his Lake Amadeus, and on to a
high hill, east of Mount Olga, which I named Ayers?s Eock (I have
given a full account of this wonderful feature, in my diary). The
country to this point is chiefly sandy soil, densely timbered with
mulga (a name given to small trees found numerous in the interior
of Australia, a species of genus acacia, belonging to the natural


order Leyuminosce), or stretches of spinifex sandhills. In the vicinity
of the lake the sandhills are higher, and very few small patches of
mulga, nothing fit for occupation. I found a spring at Ayers?s
Rock?the first permanent water seen since leaving Alice Springs,
but the good country very limited, not more than thirty square
miles.
? Proceeding west and south-west, I passed nothing worthy of
note, until I reached high ranges on the northern boundary of
South Australia (the Mann). The waters here, as far as I could
judge, had every appearance of being permanent, and the country
equal to anything in the nerth. This strip, about eight miles wide,
extends to the boundary of Western Australia, and is well adapted
for stock. From here to my furthest point, latitude 26� 32' s.,
longitude 126� 59' e., the country is poor, getting worse as I
advanced, until I got clear of all ranges, and into spinifex and sand-
hills, and dense mulga flats, destitute of water. I was reluctantly
obliged to commence my return on September 22nd, retracing my
track to where I first struck the Mann Ranges, then along the south
side, the same rich flats still continuing. From here, going east, I
made the high range seen from Ayers?s Rock, and named the
Musgrave. There is a greater extent of good country in these
ranges, averaging about twenty miles in width, and 100 long, but
the waters getting scarce towards the eastern end. In latitude
26� 9's., longitude 132� 50' K, I struck the head of a large creek,
which turned out to be the Alberga. This is very badly watered ;
indeed, from the east end of the Musgrave Ranges to the telegraph
line, there is scarcely a water to be depended upon. This must
always be a great drawback to the occupation of the good country.
I found, upon reaching the telegraph line, that this had been
an exceptionally dry season?waters that were considered per-
manent having been dry for months. It is impossible to say what
alteration a good fall of rain might make, but I do not think a
practicable route will ever be found between the lower part of
Western Australia and the telegraph line. I pushed my explora-
tion as far west as I could, and when I commenced my return had
barely sufficient stores left to carry party to the telegraph line.

? Forwarded to the Secretary, Crown Lands Office, for perusal of
the Hon. Commissioner, with diary, plans, and specimens of roots


and plants. From the specimens submitted, the country traversed
appears to be mostly granitic, and to partake of the character of one
desert, -with oasis between, and where decomposition of mica and
felspar has accompanied disintegration.
? Although the Expedition has not effected the passage to Perth, it
has placed in possession of the Department, detail of over 60,000
square miles of country, and enabled the places named by Mr. Giles
to be correctly laid down as to latitude and longitude. I can speak
highly of the way in which the records have been kept, and of the
admirably constructed plans accompanying Mr, Gosse?s journal.
?Feb. stb, 1874.? ? G. W. Goyder, Surveyor-General.
Mr. Giles's Second Expedition.
Letter from Dr. Ferdinand von Mueller.
? Melbourne, 10th August, 1874.
? By last month?s mail I forwarded to you a brief note concerning
the results of Mr. Giles?s second expedition ; but as I received the
first telegram only on the eve of the post departure from Lady
Charlotte?s Water, it is only now that I can give the Royal Geo-
graphical Society some more extended information on Mr. Giles?s
movements; and even these data will still be brief, inasmuch as
the brave explorer has not yet reached the settlements of the
south, although he will likely soon be in Adelaide. At my request,
his map was sent off two or three weeks ago to the Surveyor-
General of South Australia, Mr. Goyder; but you can be placed in
possession of a tracing or print only by next mail, when it is likely
the diary will also have found its way to publicity. Suffice it now
to say that Mr. Giles, though he was unprovided with camels,
advanced, while encountering a season of extreme drought, to the
125 th degree of E. longitude, and this on two points about 100 miles
apart, and in the latitude of Shark?s Bay. At the most northern
of these two positions he sighted in the far western distance a
range, which doubtless would have led him onward to the broken
tableland, in which the rivers Murchison, Gascoyne, Ashburton,
Fortescue, and Grey arise, had he not been forced, by a very sad
calamity, at this juncture to retreat, ?one of his faithful companions,
Mr. Gibson, losing his way and perishing in the desert, an event
which casts great gloom on an otherwise brilliant enterprise. The
danger of straying is always great, but particularly so in a desert
without landmarks, and with a uniform sameness for many miles
all around, while the view is shut out to any distance by sand-ridges.


It was only after all his horses had died of thirst, that Giles fell
back upon his camp at a distance of 100 miles, having to walk the
whole length through a sandy desert covered with pungent Triodia
(T. irritans, R. Br., Festuca irritans, F. v. M.), carrying some water
in a keg with him. Having then only two companions left, the
whole party having at starting consisted of four, he had to abandon
his attempts to penetrate further westward, although fully half-way
across from the central part of the overland telegraph line to the
west coast. Indeed, in all probability, his journey to the west shores
would have been less laborious than his return travel, as it is
reasonable to suppose that the tablelands and ranges east of Shark?s
Bay would send waters as drainage to the east on their inland
slopes, in the reach of which Mr. Giles must soon have come. He
discovered and traversed, however, four distinct systems of ranges,
irrespective of the mountains seen by him beyond the 125 th
meridian ; but one of these ranges was subsequently also discovered
by Mr. Gosse, who saw Mr. Giles?s track there, when the Adelaide
explorer, in his able exploit, diverged from his intended line in a
latitude north of McDonnell?s Range, to the latitudes chosen by
Mr. Giles for his operations. Mr, Gosse, leaving off in longitude
127� E,, came earlier back to the settlements than the Victorian
explorer, and thus enjoyed priority in recording the discovery.
On my request, one of the ranges will be named in honour of her
Imperial Highness the Princess Marie, as it was discovered about
the time of the celebration of the princess?s marriage, to which
auspicious event thus a geographic and lasting monument will be
raised in Her Majesty?s territory.
? In disclosing such a vast extent of territory in the central regions
of Australia, Mr. Giles has paved the way for overland communica-
tion from the remotest inland settlements of South Australia, New
South Wales, and Queensland, to the harbours of the west coast;
and for occupation of the extensive inland tracts of West Australia,
for pastoral, and doubtless, in many instances also, mineral purposes.
When once a few watering-places, although in the first instance
widely apart, are rendered known to steer for, then those who
follow the steps of the geographic pioneers can easily diverge to
promising places for further search of water, so as to shorten the
stages of moving stock from camp to camp. Mr. Giles was out
twelve months in the wilderness, short of a few days. Numerous
oases will yet be found in the deserts, if even that appellation
ought to be applied to the wide extent of the more central regions
of Australia as a whole. Other generations will see marvellous
changes in these supposed deserts by the dissemination of perennial


grasses, clovers, lucerne, and numerous other fodder herbs, and by
draining into permanent basins the moisture which now, after
occasional rainfalls, so rapidly evaporates. And this brings to my
mind that, several years ago, I have over and over advised (see
? Bulletin de la Societe d?Agriculture d?Alger,? &c., &c.) the desira-
bility of caravans taking seeds of Australian acacias and eucalypti,
together with seeds of perennial grasses and pastoral herbs, for
dissemination during the cool season into the deserts of Africa;
a splendid opportunity for the purpose, namely, when Gerhard
Eohlfs crossed the Lybian Desert, having apparently been lost.
? Mr. Giles?s expeditions were both supported by private means,
and were planned by myself; but the second enjoyed from the
South Australian Government a generous and disinterested support,
by a reward being given for the discoveries of the first enterprise.
I think it may also fairly be said in favour of the undaunted and
talented explorer Giles, that his first journey called forth those of
Colonel Warburton, who late in life so gallantly entered the arena
of exploration ; and also those of Mr. Gosse and Mr. Eoss, the latter
of whom has also just returned, finding it impossible, even with
dromedaries, to cope with the acacia scrubs of the western inland
regions of Australia. And, more, I can say of my Victorian
exploring friend, that the indication of the various permanent
waters on the map of his first expedition will greatly facilitate
Mr. Forrest?s movements from the sources of the Murchison Eiver
-eastward. But exploration should not cease here. We ought not
to rest until all the wide inland tracts of Her Majesty?s Australian
territory are mapped, and thus opened for settlements to her
subjects, with resources of prosperity as yet but imperfectly under-
stood or foreseen. Since the last quarter of a century I have left
no means at my command unemployed to help fostering enthusiasm
here for geographic progress; and it is to me a source of some
honest pride when I now cast a glance on the map of the Australian
continent, and compare it with that of the time when I made
Australia my permanent home. But still there remains yet much
to be done by men of endurance, skill, and courage. All the
country intervening between the tableland at the back of Shark?s
Bay, King?s Sound, Cambridge Gulf, and the rich and healthy
basaltic undulations of Sturt?s Creek (where I was with Gregory in
1856) still requires exploration; while other most gloriously
promising fields of research stretch from our overland telegraph
line eastward to M'Kinlay?s range, and other magnificent tracts of
country on the western limits of Queensland, to all of which the
establishment of the trans-continental telegraph stations give now


a comparatively safe and easy access. It is in these regions, also,
where the unburied bones of Dr, Leichhardt and his companions
probably lie bleaching in the wilderness.

?Postscript. I would add that Mr. Giles was nine times attached by
the natives, probably in the combat for water, and that, on one
occasion, he was dragged by the savages and severely wounded.
We have in Australia not yet the desert breed of camels ?
i.e., such wonderful creatures as Gerhard Rohlfs (in the cool season,?
it is true) could use for thirty-six days with only once a scanty
supply of water in all that time.?
Mr. John Boss?s Exploring Expedition.
(From the ? South Australian Register,? Aug. 5.)
1 HE expedition set out upon its long journey westward about the
20th March [1874]. At that time it consisted of Mr. Ross, as leader,
Mr. Ross?s son, one other European, three Arabs, fourteen horses, and
sixteen camels. Carte hlanche having been allowed with regard to
stores and equipments, it rested with the leader to decide what would
be a sufficient provision for his purposes.
? Accounts received from him were written at Emma Creek?a
watercourse considerably to the westward of his point of departure
near the Peake. The date of the communications is April 24th, and
extracts from those will best explain the state of affairs. In one
letter he says ? I have lost much time in trying for a westerly
course, and stock of provisions would not be sufficient to last the
whole party for the time contemplated to get over the distance to
Perth. I therefore sent back A. Smith and two Arabs, with twelve
camels and two horses; also sundries I don?t require. I take with
me my son and Kamran, ten horses, and four camels, with pro-
visions to last at least eight months. I started from this camp in
lat. 27 58' 18" and long. 133� 48' by account, keeping a more
southerly course, and west as much as the dense mulga-scrub of
boundless extent from east to west would permit. I tried to tap
the mulga-scrub in several places, but it was of no use. I saw no
direction through it which could be penetrated by the camels, and
I have tried it until I got too near to Mr. Gosses homeward track
making down the Alberga. Water is exceedingly scarce and very


difficult to find, and no rain has fallen of any consequence for a long
time.? This certainly seems disheartening enough ; but the letter
proceeds as follows ;? ? I have every hope in the success of the expe-
dition, and I send nothing and no one back to Beltana that I cannot
do better without. The Arabs have given me every satisfaction,
and I am certain they could not be replaced by a better class of men
of any country. Do not believe in my defeat. So long as I have a
horse or a camel, I will see my journey?s end before all is over.?
? Adelaide.
? Mr * Ross telegraphs to Mr. Elder, from Beltana, to the effect
that he has been obliged to return through want of water. No rain
had fallen for a long time, and the horses were several times without
water for four days together. A great extent of country was covered
with mulga-scrub, and the immense quantity of dead underwood pre-
vented him from using the camels for trying the country for water.
Mr. Ross states his furthest distance was lat. 30� 25', long. 131� 16',
Very few natives were seen, and on every occasion they were making
towards the sea-coast, and were very wild, so that he was unable to
get within speaking distance. The country traversed was high,
open undulating tableland, dense mulga-scrub, and open mulga-
forest, well grassed; also a great extent of open undulating plain,
magnificently grassed.?
Mr. John Forrest's Journey across, from Champion Bay, on the West
Coast, to Pealte Station, on the Telegraph Line.
Letter to the Governor of South Australia.
? Peake Station, October Ist, 1874.
? I thank His Excellency for his kind congratulation, and beg to
forward a short account of our journey.
? Wo left Champion Bay on the Ist April, and reached Mount Hale,
on the Murchison, the farthest point known, on the 4th May, and
followed a fresh-water bi-anch of the river, over well-grassed country,
to its source, in lat. 25� 50', and long. 119� e., where we turned to
the south-east, in order, if possible, to strike other branches of the
river; but, after going about 70 miles over grassy flats, with spini-
fex plains intervening, without seeing any, we turned to the north-
east and crossed the watershed of the Murchison in lat. 26� 18', and
long. 120�, which was only a low rise, with a few small gullies
running out of it, which flow into grassy flats, and finally find their
way into the main river. We still continued on north-east, in-
tending to do so until we reached the tropics, but entered a most


miserable undulating spinifex desert, which lasted, without any
interruption worth mentioning, for 600 miles.
? In lat. 25�, long. 122�, we found a most splendid spring, an oasis
in the desert, and were obliged to halt for three weeks for want of
water ahead; but eventually were enabled to move on slowly and
by long marches, our horses often suffering from want of water, and
travelling on very scanty and precarious supplies, reached a small
pool in a gully in the spinifex, in lat. 26� 2', and long. 125� 27'.
Here we were obliged to halt for three weeks, and made five dif
ferent attempts to get ahead, and travelled over 700 miles. At last,
by risking a good deal and abandoning everything we did not abso-
lutely require, we reached some hilly granite country in lat. 25� 55',
long. 126� 30', and found sufficient water in rock water-holes to last
two days, and were placed in perfect safety by finding a spring in
the Barrow Range, close to Mr. Giles?s track, which, however, he
was not fortunate enough to find.
?On the 17th August we reached the Cavanagh Ranges of Mr.
G osse, and found a camp of Mr. Giles?s, at a fine spring, in lat. 26� 11
long. 128�, where we had been camped for a long time. From this
point we followed along nearly Mr. Gosse?s route to the Tomkinson
Range, got into very serious difficulty by the water on his track
being dried up, and only saved ourselves and horses by finding a
beautiful spring to the north of his route, where we rested four days
to recruit our weary horses.
? We continued on through the Tomkinson and Mann ranges, and
on to the Musgrave ranges, and found water in several places on
Mr. Gosse?s track. After this we struck the Alberga, and traced it
down, getting water by digging, and going often without it. We
reached the telegraph line on the 27th September, and the Peake
on the 30th, where we are receiving every kindness and attention.
Altogether we have been very fortunate, as there has been a great
drought in the interior, and scarcely any rain has fallen for a long
time. We have not had any worth mentioning.
? Five horses were abandoned, and one dropped down dead after
reaching the telegraph line. Want of feed was chiefly the cause
of their giving in, all the grass being old and parched up.
? We have been living on damper and water for over a month, but
were fortunate in having enough flour, bringing in 60 lbs. with us,
besides abandoning over 200 cwt.- Our horses are in the very
weakest condition, and we have had to walk in turns the whole
way, nearly 2000 miles. The health of the party has been very
good, and they have all aided in an exemplary manner. Many
natives were met, and on three occasions attacked us; but each


time we were able to drive them off, and, although some were
wounded, as far as we know none were killed. They are very
numerous in the interior, and much game exists even in the most
wretched spinifex desert.
? I trust His Excellency will excuse this hurriedly written
account.
