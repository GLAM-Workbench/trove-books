FOREWORD
i have much pleasure in introducing this History of the Mauritius
Government Railways by Mr. Arthur Jessop, 0.8. E., M. Inst. T.,
Transport Consultant to the Government of Mauritius.
The introduction of the railway system in Mauritius, about one
hundred years ago, made a great contribution towards the develop-
ment of the economy of the Island, but as time passed cheaper and
more convenient means of conveyance had an unfavourable effect
upon the economics of our railway undertaking. The decision to
close the Railways became inevitable.
The Author has been associated for. a long time with Railways in
the United Kingdom and elsewhere. His knowledge in that field and
his study of the various aspects of our railway system have been of
great help to the Government.
I am sure that this account will be of great value to those interested
in the history of our Island.

Communications.

INTRODUCTION
before the great sea-way connecting the Red Sea with the Mediter-
ranean Sea was built, the island of Mauritius came by its proud
name of “ The Star and Key of the Indian Ocean
In the nineteenth century the capital of Port Louis was the con-
verging point of many ships from the days of sail to the coming of
the steam ships. The Port was busy with its trades of ship-repairing,
ships chandling and coaling. It was already the outlet for the staple
crop of sugar —raw sugar milled from the cane spreading its green
carpet all over the island.
In the year 1864 the first section of the Mauritius Government
Railways was opened.
One hundred years afterwards the scene is changed. The sailing
ships have gone and for many of the steamships the Suez Canal has
provided the shorter route between Europe and the East that by-
passes Mauritius. But sugar is still King and its Kingdom has grown
larger. From a production of 125,000 tons a year in the latter part
of the nineteenth century the export is now over 600,000 tons and
the Port is busier than ever in its function as an export outlet.
Rationalisation laid its finger upon the industry and now instead of
262 mills in 1864 there are 23. Mill chimneys and old buildings can
be seen in all parts of the island with grasses sprouting from them,
marking the sites of the many small estates that formerly existed.
They bear lovely names like Bonne Terre, Rosalie, Holyrood,
Clairfonds, Chamarel, Cluny.
The march of progress has changed the transport scene. The
passenger traffic from the railways disappeared with the advent of
the motor bus. The goods traffic, except the sugar and the heavy
goods which were reserved to the railways by law, disappeared
with the coming of the motor lorry.
The burden of carrying only the sugar told heavily against the
economics of railway transport. Severe financial losses on the rail-
ways combined with the economies to be obtained from the use of
road transport, killed the Railways.
They were finally closed on sth February, 1964, in their centenary
year.
They had been an important instrument in the social and economic
life of the country. They had done a good job. Year in and year out
the railway system straddling the country had taken its passengers
to and from work and pleasure and its goods to and from the Port,


Many of the older folk sighed with regret at the passing of the
railways and indulged in interesting memories of their experiences.
By 1964, however, no child of eight years or under could ever have
seen, much less have travelled, in a railway passenger train. Such
is the passing of time.
But a hundred years ago many children and their elders must have
looked on with amazement and interest at the preparations for the
railway—the embankments being raised, the cuttings being exca-
vated, the rivers and the culverts being bridged, the track formation
being built up, the laying of the rails and the building of the stations.
Mauritius was very much on the map of the world and it deserved
a railway.
When the locomotives came out of the ship holds and were put
in steam it was surely a nine days’ wonder and it must have been
some time before the sight of the trains running through the country-
side became familiar.
In later days other modern sights have aroused the same excite-
ment. The coming of the first double deck buses as late as 1962 drew
large crowds. But of those who watched these splendid monsters few
indeed knew that many years before the railways themselves had
run double deck coaches on their passenger trains. Those few recalled
nostalgically their journeys to school on these vehicles. Do they ever
go to renew their youth by looking at the fine model of the double
deck railway passenger coach in the Museum at Mahebourg?
My thanks are due to various friends for their interest and suggest-
ions and to Mr. S. Valadon for his help in research.

CHAPTER I
The Coming of the Railways
it was in the middle of the nineteenth century that men of Mauri-
tius turned their minds to the benefits of a railway system for the
country. There is no doubt that the primary motive inspiring invest-
igations into the possibilities of building a railway in Mauritius was
the vital necessity to improve the means of getting the sugar crop
down to Port Louis. At the time there were 262 sugar estates pro-
ducing annually a crop of 125,000 tons. These estates were widely
scattered and depended upon a laborious system of mule and horse
cart transport over roads that were certainly not first class.
On 13th September, 1845, the following notice appeared in The
Railway Times ”:
“ Mauritius Railway Company, from Port Louis to Mahebourg,
with branches in other parts of Mauritius or Isle of France,
provisionally registered. Capital £350,000 divided into
14.000 shares of £25. Deposit 1 sh. per share. No other call
until the report from a delegation which will visit Mauritius is
submitted to shareholders. An amount of not more than
2.000 shares will be reserved to the Colony ”,
These pioneers failed to obtain any support but there were not
lacking enthusiasts with fertile ideas for the construction of railway
lines. Indeed Mr. de Closets, an engineer, had already constructed
an Estate railway at Beau Vallon in Grand Port. The equipment in-
cluded steam locomotives and wagons of which it is a pity that
specimens are not left for us to see.
In 1856 Dr. Ulcoq, a member of the Chamber of Agriculture, sub-
mitted a scheme for a railway in Mauritius to the Secretary of State,
who forwarded it to Sir James Higginson, the Governor. The
Chamber having been asked for their views came out in strong
support for a railway installation. Through the next few years several
schemes were canvassed, some of them being quite ambitious,
especially one to drive a line from the North through the Pouce
Mountain to Mahebourg. All the original projects were, incidentally,
designed to avoid the Curepipe plateau, no doubt partly because of
the nature of the terrain and partly because it was very sparsely
inhabited.


These early plans to drive a railway tunnel through the Ponce
Mountain reflect the aspirations of many planners to break through
the mountain barrier encircling Port Louis. They include the present
writer who has surveyed a road alignment at Creve Coeur, passing
along the ridge at the side of Pieter Both Mountain and emerging
on the plateau to join the road from St. Pierre to Nouvelle Decou-
verte. This is quite feasible especially with modern road making
plant but the cost would be considerable.
The real birth pangs of the Mauritius Government Railways as
subsequent generations have known them, began with further strong
representations from the Chamber of Agriculture urging the Govern-
ment to construct a railway. Then followed the commissioning by
the Secretary of State for the Colonies, under the initiative of the
Governor Sir William Stevenson, of a British Engineer, Mr. J.Long-
ridge, whose survey was made between July 1858 and February 1850.
In the course of his survey, Mr. Longridge quoted the case of a
planter wishing to transport three boilers from the wharf at Port
Louis to his estate eighteen miles away. The boilers weighed six to
seven tons each and the lowest tender for conveyance by road was
£1,200. Small wonder that a railway system was earnestly sought
after.
On 23rd March, 1860, another Civil Engineer, Mr. Hawkshaw,
was appointed to verify the surveys of Mr. Longridge. The practical
possibilities of the proposed alignments were apparent. How was the
project to be financed ? The flotation of a Company with private
capital had been canvassed at various times but it was finally decided
to proceed with a State-owned system. Mr. Longridge had estimated
that the two lines —one from Port Louis to the North and the other,
the Central Line —would cost just over one million pounds sterling.
On 28th November 1860 a contribution of £200,000 was voted from
the Colony’s Reserve Fund and work was started by the Contractors,
Messrs Brassey, Peto & Co. in January, 1862.
At this time there were about 4,500 carriages and carts and
about 4,000 mules and 2,000 horses in Mauritius, engaged in the
transport of passengers and goods. The first Stage Coach in the
Colony had been put on between Port Louis and Pamplemousses in
1833. A glance around the streets of the capital will show that a few
of the carts still seem to exist to the impediment of busy modern
traffic.
The North Line was officially inaugurated on 23rd May, 1864,
Sir Henry Barkly being then Governor, At that time the construction


of the Central Station in Port Louis had not been commenced. The
Central Line was under construction.
Six weeks after the inauguration an accident occurred at Pam-
plemousses. A train from Flacq loaded with stone entered the station
at excessive speed and was diverted into a siding where it collided
with stationary wagons. The locomotive was derailed, a man was
killed and others were injured. This incident was not calculated to
allay the fears of those who regarded the railway project as a dan-
gerous innovation but it is interesting to recall that the first days of
railways in Britain some forty years earlier were not without
incidents of this kind which marred the inauguration of this form of
transport. As in Britain, the accident in Mauritius did not prevent
the progress of the railways.
During the year 1865 great interest was focussed upon the con-
struction of the Central Line, most of which was completed early in
the year. The opening was however delayed pending the building
of the Grand River North West railway bridge. The Line was even-
tually inaugurated on 19th October, 1865 with enthusiastic acclaim.
A report says: “A large number of passengers found accommodation
in the trains and there were even several ladies who did not appear
to have taken much notice of frightening rumours that had spread
around ”.
The “ Commercial Gazette ” commented: “ The departures
seemed to have been reasonably timed. It is observed that the
departure time for the first train from Mahebourg on Sundays fixed
at 2 p.m. is rather early. The maximum speed is of 15 miles per hour
down slopes and the drivers have no difficulty in arriving at the
stations in time owing to their compression. We should however wait
for a fully loaded train to climb up the hills of Beau Bassin before
giving any definite opinion as regards heights. It appears that every
precaution has been taken for the safety of passengers. So we can
do nothing but encourage the public to take full advantage of all
benefits derived from the Railways. In conclusion we express the
hope that this wide enterprise would bring about prosperity and
welfare to the population at large
During the construction of the line to Mahebourg Mr. George
Clark, a naturalist keenly interested in the history of the " Dodo ”,
watched with excitement the excavation of the trenches, hoping to
find bones ot this extinct bird. He was disappointed but in 1865 his
quest was rewarded with the finding of bones in a nearby marsh,
“ The Mare aux Songes
By 1868, so soon after the establishment of the railway system
the level of public expenditure had risen to such a height that

retrenchment was being sought. Amongst other suggestions was one
from the Chamber of Agriculture that the railways should be made
over to a private company " which would show a greater spirit of
initiative than the Government It was immediately indicated by
the Government that they would agree to transfer the railways to a
private company but the condition was that the debentures must be
repaid. This apparently was effective in putting an end to the
proposal.
Having established the “ trunk ” route from Port Louis to
Mahebourg the line was pushed out to the South from Rose Belle.
On 11th December, 1876, the section between Rose Belle and Riviere
Dragon was opened under the auspices of Governor Sir Arthur
Phayre, subsequently to be extended to Souillac in January, 1878.
The Line running West to East from Rose Hill to Bel Air was
inaugurated, again in style, by the Governor Sir John Bowen on
Ist November, 1880.
The three other sections came much later. The Bois Cheri Light
Railway was opened in September, 1903, the line from Port Louis to
Tamarin, called the “ Black River ” Line, in August, 1904 (inau-
gurated with a train of open carriages) and the Long Mountain
Branch from Terre Rouge in November, 1904.
On 11th June, 1905, a special train for hunters (of stags) was run
from Curepipe to Tamarin and back, a special wagon being reserved
for the dogs.
These three sections finally completed a railway net-work of
156 miles of track (including Stations and Sidings), which in a
country of 720 square miles was not inconsiderable.
The track mileage was divided as follows:
In addition, the Bois Cheri Light Railway of 75 cm. gauge was
18 miles long, later reduced to 13f miles and still later to 9 miles
before it was closed in 1951. This line was laid with 20 lbs rails partly
on steel and partly on standard wooden sleepers sawn in four. The
rolling stock comprised three 9-ton engines (0-4-0) and forty 2-ton
open wagons.
The North Line from Port Louis terminating at the estuary of
the Grand River South East ran at one point through a large path of


solidified lava. Flowing down to the sea from the volcanoes (now
extinct) this lava set hard and its ripples are clearly seen alongside
the railway track.
The Midland Line from Port Louis to Mahebourg passed
through the populous area of Plaines Wilhems and Curepipe (which
indeed it was instrumental in developing into urban townships) and
over the Central Plateau to the sea. The line to Tamarin served the
tobacco, aloe and sugar cane disrict of Black River whilst the
other lines penetrated the rural areas of the Centre.
In the year 1903 occurred an event that greatly influenced the
progress of the Railways. The animal disease “ Surra " destroyed
most of the horses, mules and bullocks in the Colony with the result
that those who formely found it cheaper to use carts had to turn to
the railways for transport. Those who lived in the country districts
where the Railways did not run, were naturally severely hit by this
calamity and the Government of the day were forced to consider
the construction of further branch lines and Light Railways, as well
as new sidings on existing lines. The construction of the Long Moun-
tain Branch, the Bois Cheri Light Railway and probably the "Black
River" Line stemmed from this emergency added to the continuous
expansion in sugar production.
Other projects considered at this critical time, but not carried
out, were a line from Poudre d'Or to Pamplemousses and one from
Mapou to Rich Fund to penetrate the Northern areas, together with
a Light Railway (60 cm.) from Mare d'Albert to Cent Gaulettes
Estate.
Ironically enough it was in the same year 1903 that another
milestone in the history of Mauritius was reached, but eventually
with disastrous effects upon the Railways. In this year the first motor
car was introduced into the country. Few could visualise at that
time what a revolution in transport this was to bring in the future.

CHAPTER II
The Railway Equipment
the rolling stock used in the early days was in wood,much of
it, teak. The passenger coaches in light brown livery were of
“ tropical ” construction with as much open work as possible to
give ventilation. They included double deck vehicles of curiously
top-heavy design, a model of which is exhibited in the Historical
Museum at Mahebourg. In this early period smoking was prohibited
in the trains and on the stations.
The Locomotives were British built by builders such as Kitson
of Leeds, R. W. Hawthorn, Leslie & Co. Ltd., Sharp. Stewart. They
were in black livery, some of them with brass name-plates including
“ Tamarin ", " Lady Bower ", “ Black River ". Some also bore
the crest of the Railways—the arms of Mauritius with an encircling
collar bearing the words “ Mauritius Government Railways ". Here
is a list of them as far as records have been kept:

Some of the early locomotives were in steam almost to the end,
notably Number 10 (1865), Number 12 (1865), Number 26 (1876)
and Number 41 (1903).
In 1927 three “ Garratt ” locomotives were purchased to
strengthen the resources for hauling sugar over the gradients from
the South. These were not unanimously popular and as early as the
following year (1928) the Railway Commission appointed to enquire
into the administrative and financial conditions of the Railways
considered that they were uneconomical and superfluous. The sug-
gestion of the Commission that they should be returned to U.K. and
re-sold, did not, however, apparently find favour and the loco-
motives were working in Mauritius almost to the end.
In 1954 as a final effort towards modernisation of the motive
power, two Diesel-Hydraulic locomotives of 600 H.P. built by the
North British Locomotive Company were purchased for Mauritius.
These were used for hauling sugar trains up the incline from Rose
Belle to Curepipe. On arrival at Plaine Lauzun Railway Works after
being unloaded from the ship it was found that they contained large
quantities of nylon stockings and ladies’ shoes which had presu-
mably been “ cached ” by smugglers on the ship and for some
reason had not been recovered.


The equipment included a “ funeral coach " existing to the very
end of the story. This was a black painted wooden vehicle with a
bier in the interior surrounded by heavy black leather upholstered
armchairs. Displayed below the roof of the coach were four angels
heads carved in wood and painted in aluminium paint. This coach
was usually used to take the deceased with mourners to various
burial places including the Cemetery at Bois Marchand, where a
platform and station building directly adjoined the burial ground.
The building was designed and used as a Chapel.
The original wooden wagons were almost completely superseded
during the early years of this century by steel open and covered
wagons. At the final count there were 575 steel wagons of capacity
varying from 12 to 23 tons. Many will remember these sleek tall
modern looking vehicles in aluminium paint.
The track was constructed and always maintained to a very
high standard with normal British gauge 4 ft. and the Rail-
ways operated in accordance with the best principles of operating
practice in U.K. The gradient on the Midland Line between Curepipe
and Rose Belle was unusually heavy for a railway—l in 26.
The bed of the track being almost entirely hard, was very
sound. Three weights of rail were latterly in use —74 lbs, 78 lbs and
80 lbs per yard. One or two miles of steel sleepers were laid down in
the North in 1937 and there were some concrete sleepers in Yards
and Sidings; otherwise teak and jarrah sleepers were mainly use.
Most of the Railways Stations in Mauritius were single-storey
wooden buildings—some of them incorporating the local Post Offices.
The most notable was the massive stone Central Station at Port Louis
used also as the Railway Headquarters. This station had one through
platform and a bay at each end, one for the North and one for the
South, all covered. It was indeed a piece of “ Victorian " archi-
tecture which brought evocative memories to many visitors from
Great Britain. An old brass faced clock made by John Walker of
London numbered 1978 and a shiny handbell were inevitable
features of its equipment.
This clock was famous for a story about a certain Colonial
Secretary. A train left Port Louis for the residential areas at ten
minutes to four in the afternoon and the next one at half past four.
The Government Offices closed at four o'clock. At twenty minutes
to four the Colonial Secretary was not infrequently to be seen
making his way to the station where he took up a position under the
clock and stared grimly at every Government Official who came for
the earlier train.


The Booking Hall, waiting rooms and other facilities were on
the ground floor of the Railway Headquarters building whose thick
walls effectively insulate against the subtropical heat of the capital.
This edifice now stands as an island between the busy streets and
squares of the town and the new arterial road running through to
Harbour Square on the site of the railway tracks.
At Reduit near the College of Agriculture, there stands a small
elegant wooden building with a stone platform. This is what is left
of the Railway Station of Reduit on the line from Riviere Seche to
Rose Hill. To this Station successive Governors drove from their
Residence at Le Reduit by horse carriage to entrain for Port Louis,
and a special Waiting Room was incorporated in the building for
the Governor’s comfort —though it was unlikely that the train would
ever be late enough to delay the Governor’s departure ! The railway
saloon in which they travelled is preserved—a handsome vehicle
built in the Plaine Lauzun Works with panelling of polished teak.
The last Governor to use it was Sir Robert Scott in 1955.
The Railways were naturally the chief carriers of mail and also
from the beginning, the Telegraph system was introduced for trans-
mitting train signals and railway messages, the instruments being
mostly of the single needle type. In a few years this service was
taken over by the Post Office and opened to the public, about fifteen
stations being equipped as Telegraph Offices. At other stations
messages were accepted for conveyance by train to the nearest
station where there was a Telegraph Office. No doubt these facilities
influenced the combination of Post Offices and railway stations so
often found in Mauritius.
The telegraph business was in its hey-day said to be one of the
most intensive in the world having regard to the size of the territory.
But after 1915 when the railway block signalling was introduced the
railway ceased to use the telegraph system which then rapidly
declined.


CHAPTER III
Early Days
from the opening of the Railways for many years the under-
taking was managed and staffed in its higher posts by British
Overseas Officers. Up to 1881 the engine drivers were drawn from
Britain. In due course however Mauritian personnel were trained to
take charge.
In the 1880’s most of the Artisans of the Railways received
Rs 1.75 (2/7|d.) per day. Labourers received Re 1 (l/6d.) per day.
" Common Porters ” received Rs 14 (£1.1.0) per month.
Amusing stories are not lacking about the advent of the railway.
Some travellers on a train for the first time exclaimed with astonish-
ment as they passed a sugar mill chimney at twenty miles an hour:
" Look, that Mill is running away ”.
A group of country folk watching a locomotive passing for the
first time said: "Look, a machine has escaped from the Mill”. These
stories, amongst others, became enshrined in " Sagas ” as words to
the famous Mauritian dance tunes —in much the same way as
" Calypsos ” are written in the West Indies.
Schoolboys had their fun in those days as in these. A favourite
sport was to creep behind two Chinese sitting in the train and tie
their pigtails together, preferably around a handy projection, with
disastrous and comical results when their victims got up to leave the
train.
In the hey-day of the passenger traffic the stations of Curepipe,
Vacoas, Phoenix, Quatre Bornes, Rose Hill and Beau Bassin must
have been busy indeed. In the morning the First Class passengers
made their way to the stations by car or carriage or on foot and their
servants carried to the train their tin " mall ” or their brief cases
containing the home-work they had taken home the previous night.
Seated in their compartments they were probably like travellers all
the world over. No doubt particular seats were sacrosanct by long
usage and anyone occupying them except for their regular "owners”
would receive glares of disapproval. A lady who travelled occasion-
ally in these First Class coaches relates that the passengers in their
immaculate white suits sat reading without exchanging a word and


looked just like " gentlemen dolls On the other hand there are
stories of much more lively happenings amongst the younger men
to whom the journey to and from the capital must have had an
atmosphere like a very friendly Club.
At Port Louis the scene must have been interesting. Messengers
met all the officials and business men, took from them their daily
luggage and walked behind them to their offices. Horse carriages
were available at the Station for casual travellers.
At the country terminals such as Mahebourg and Souillac, lines
of " carrioles ”, the four seater horse drawn vehicles with a high
wheel on each side, were waiting for the trains.
When the Railways were started it was the practice to require
staff working at Headquarters in Port Louis to live in that town.
About the year 1888 the incidence of sickness through fever became
so great that the men were given permission to live in the country
and issued with free railway passes to enable them to travel to and
from Head Office.
Whereas in the closing years of the Railways the traffic con-
sisted very largely of milled sugar from the Mills to the Port for ship-
ment, in earlier days and well into the period between the Wars
substantial quantities of sugar cane were carried from the fields to
the Mills —often over relatively long distances. The process of closing
factories and concentrating on fewer and larger centres of sugar
milling had brought more cane to the Railway but it was not entirely
welcome. The rates were very low and it was necessary to purchase
more wagons which were only used during the Crop season. Up to
100,000 tons in the season was the normal carrying at that time.
Certain Crown Lands at Vallijee near Port Louis formerly
belonged to a scrap metal merchant, Mr. Vallijee. It is on record
that the land was paid for by the Government in scrap rails instead
of money.
In 1911 the Annual Report of the Railways recorded that the
‘ ‘ ever increasing number of motor cars in the island ' ’ was reducing
first and second class traffic on the railways. The third class travel
was well maintained and even increasing. Indeed, by 1921 it was
noted that the habit of travelling by railway had extended to all
sections of the community and there was a phenomenal increase in
Third Class passenger traffic for which additional trains had to be
run. It is interesting to recall that this “ phenomenon ” was repeated
forty years later when the modernised bus services further developed
the habit of travel even in the remotest parts of the country.
Like every other section of Mauritius life, the Railways have
over the years, had to contend with the. effects of the periodic


cyclones. The serious visitation in April 1892 did a great deal of
damage to the Railway installations and, in more recent years,
Cyclones " Alix ” and “ Carol ” in 1960 caused much devastation.
In addition to the destruction of many railway buildings and staff
quarters the railway tracks were washed away in several places. As
part of the emergency measures, railway coaches and covered vans
were stationed at various points for the shelter of the homeless, who
also took refuge in railway warehouses.
A consequence of running steam locomotives through the sugar
cane fields was the hazard of fires amongst the dry cane, caused by
sparks from locomotives. Spark arresters were at one period used
on the smoke stacks of the locomotives but in later years their use
seems to have been discontinued, as witness claims paid for the
damage caused. In some years these amounted to over ten thousand
rupees (£750).
Before the Railways came there was a not inconsiderable
coasting trade between Port Louis and the sugar estates accessible
to the sea. This was a natural activity in view of the indifferent road
communications but it continued long after the opening of the rail-
way system. In the 80’s the Railways General Manager com-
plained that —
“ the strong competition between the Railways and the boats for
the traffic arising on or near the sea coast in most parts of the
island still continues. The former has to contend with the
important facts that the latter carry on the return trips the
provisions, manure and machinery free of charge in order to
save the cost of ballast, and that the boats in the greater
number of cases either belong wholly or in part to the
Estates
The schooners from Bel Ombre in the far South and Beau Champ
in the East were in fact tenaciously maintained in service for another
thirty or forty years, ploughing their way through sometimes rough
seas around the coast of Mauritius.
A note by Mr. N. Broome, Lieutenant-Governor, to the Council
of Government in 1881 conveys an interesting side-light upon the
early days—
“ The trains were occasionally delayed during the year. The loss
of time thus caused is very vexatious to passengers, and every
possible precaution to ensure punctuality should be taken,
faults of system being remedied as they become apparent.
When a train is likely to be delayed beyond half an hour,
notice of the fact should be posted up at all stations con-
cerned; arrangements should be made and maintained in


working order, whereby an engine breaking down on any
part of the line may as speedily as possible be replaced. In
criticising the administration of our Railways, fair allowance
should be made for the difficulty of working a single line,
with steep gradients and very heavy traffic and with a
heterogeneous and not always thoroughly efficient staff;
while full credit must be given for the conveyance of
nearly a million and a quarter of passengers without injury
or accident of any kind to a single person ”,
This early comment on the safety record of the Railways was not,
in the long run, over-optimistic. Throughout the century of the Rail-
ways existence their safety precautions were very satisfactory.
Apart from minor mishaps the accident rate involving loss of life
was very low. By far the most serious was on 23rd February 1894
when six coaches of a passenger train toppled over the bridge at
Failles into the St. Louis river. The accident was caused by the
driver of the leading engine putting on its brakes when he saw a
signal against him on the far side of the bridge but the driver of the
rear engine, failing to see the signal, maintained his speed. Thus
several coaches were telescoped on the bridge and as there was a
near-cyclonic wind blowing at the time, the derailed coaches were
blown over. Two officials came under criticism about this affair —
the General Manager of the Railways for allowing double-deck
coaches to be used in such rough weather and the Head of the
Meteorological Services for being absent from his office during the
approach of a cyclone. It is difficult to see, seventy years afterwards,
how either of these two personalities could be blamed for the
accident.
Soon after this accident a large number of railway passengers
sent a petition to Government asking for the Grand River North
West bridge (near the Failles bridge) to be rebuilt at a much lower
level so as to lessen the consequences of a similar calamity occur-
ring on this much longer bridge. The Consulting Engineers in
London to whom the matter was referred,, advised that the Grand
River North West bridge should be strengthened. The bases of the
two cylinders constituting each of the four piers were thereupon
encased in iron sheeting and the space inside filled with concrete.
Incidentally this bridge had been damaged by a cyclone in
1868. Two spans were blown away, to be replaced by a temporary
wooden bridge until the old bridge could be renewed.
But ten years or so later, owing to increase of traffic, it was found
necessary to increase the weight of the engines from fifty-six tons to
eighty-five tons and consequently most of the bridges had to be


renewed. To rebuild the Grand River North West bridge,the largest
bridge on the system, was impossible without stopping all traffic
on the single line and in 1911 work was commenced on an entirely
new bridge a few hundred yards nearer the sea. This naturally
required a deviation of the line. The new bridge was opened in
March, 1914.


CHAPTER IV
The Wars and in Between
in the early years of the 1914-18 War, railway traffic ran quite
smoothly except for delays due to inferior coal but the effects of the
conflict began to be felt by 1917. In that year considerable reduct-
ions of passenger train services had to be made, including the com-
plete suppression of Sunday trains. The daily business trains also had
to be cut down, resulting in some overcrowding which, however, was
stoically accepted as inevitable. Materials such as teak and boiler
tubes were becoming unobtainable . Eucalyptus trees were cut down
from the Government forests for use as sleepers.
At the close of the War, the suppressed train services were restored
but then came the calamity that struck Mauritius in common with
many parts of the World. The great influenza epidemic of 1918
raged severely in Mauritius and at one period up to 60 per cent of
the railway staff were sick. Ten stations were closed and the services
reduced to skeleton time-tables for the maintenance of food supplies.
There was a general dislocation of the commercial and social life of
the country. It is pleasing to record that the railway staff remaining
on duty received a gratuity from a grateful Government.
In the same year an event of another kind occurred on the
railways. All the workers at the Workshops at Plaine Lauzun went
on strike for eleven days and completely shut down the maintenance
and repair facilities of the Railways. Their action won them an
increase in wages of 60 per cent.
In the “ twenties ” the Railways continued to be busy, although
feeling increasingly the effects of the advancing number of private
cars (there were 1,600 in 1927 and 11,000 in 1963) and ever-
developing competition from motor buses and lorries. The first taxi
service in Mauritius had been introduced in 1910 and the first motor
bus service (between Curepipe and Port Louis) in 1927.
The passenger traffic had to be held to the railway by reductions
in fares to the level, or even below those of the buses. The utmost
economy had to be exercised resulting in the closure of the passenger
services in the Montagne Longue Line in 1928 and the Black River
and Montagne Blanche to Riviere S£che Lines in the following year.


In 1922 the “ Best Kept Station ” competition was revived alter
a long lapse and immediately had the result of improving the appear-
rance of the railway stations, especially in their floral displays.
New works on the track included the construction of a double line
between Petite Riviere and Beau Bassin and the commencement of a
deviation line between Vacoas and Curepipe Road. The latter was
however condemned as unnecessary and wasteful by a succeeding
General Manager and was abandoned. The earthworks and the
bridge across Alice Brillant can still be seen.
A Traffic Control system was inaugurated in 1927 with its centre
at the Railways Hearquarters at Port Louis. From a Traffic Control
Board at this point practically all the stations on the system were
directly connected with Central Control, partly by underground
cables and partly by aerial lines. A high standard of “ speech trans-
mission ” was achieved and in addition to helping to eliminate the
telegraph system it enabled the train movements to be greatly
expedited.
From the beginning the railway had been worked on the " train-
despatching ” system, that is to say, each train was scheduled to
pass another at a fixed place. When trains were running out of time,
telegraphed instructions were sent to adjust the passing places. This
rather cumbersome method was replaced in 1015 by a “ lock and
block ” system invented by Mr. R. H. Stockdale. The line was
divided into “ Block ” sections protected by locked signals which
could only be freed at the right time, thus providing a very safe and
effective means of train control. This device was used up to the end.
In 1926 the visit of Their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess
of York brought great crowds to the railway where the arrangements
were described as generally satisfactory to all concerned.
There were not lacking lively minds probing into ways and means
of improving the position of the Railways. Heavily increased ser-
vices on special occasions such as race meetings in Port Louis,
special trains for public occasions and accelerated services to deve-
lop the traffic to the beaches in the North, were all tried at one time
or another. Theatre trains in the evenings to Port Louis were run as
a joint enterprise, one a week being run by the Railways as a com-
mercial venture and others run as required on payment of a subsidy
by the Theatre. Incidentally in 1903 one of these theatre trains was
switched incorrectly at Port Louis and the passengers found them-
selves in the Good Yard alongside the New Mauritius Dock basin.
The possibilities of running diesel rail cars or “ Michelines ” as
they were popularly called in the neighbouring island of Reunion
were thoroughly investigated from time to time but were never con-
sidered to be viable.


liven the electrification of the Railways has occupied many minds.
As far back as 1929 a Commission of Enquiry considered and
rejected this idea because revenue would not justify the heavy capital
cost involved.
For many years the Electrical Department of Government under
the Government Electrical Engineer was combined with the Rail-
ways but in 1937 it was detached as a separate Department.
At the turn of the third decade of this century the clouds began to
gather ominously over the Railways. The decade started with a bad
year in 1931 when, owing to a disastrous cyclone there was reaped
one of the smallest sugar crops on record in modern times. Only
164,000 tons of sugar were carried by rail and in a period of trade
depression coupled with competition from the growing number of
busses and lorries, it was necessary to cut down the railway services
drastically. What was even more drastic was the necessity to dismiss
several hunderd railwaymen.
The railway staff in common with other Government employees
were also subjected to a levy on salaries but this was discontinued in
1935.
On the outbreak of hostilities in the Second World War it was
necessary, in order to conserve the railways resources for carrying
freight traffic and troops, to close down all the passenger services
except those on the Main Line between Port Louis and Curepipe.
By 1942 however the effects of war conditions on road transport
were crippling and back the Railways came to the rescue. Their
passenger trains were restored on all lines notwithstanding the fact
that the railways themselves were hard put to it to maintain their
facilities in proper condition. For several years the shortages taxed
the ingenuity of those responsible for maintaining the equipment.
Lack of rivets for bridges, steel for wagons, timber and linseed oil,
sleepers and all sorts of commodities made things very difficult.


CHAPTER V
Commissions of Enquiry
commissions of Enquiry into the state of the Railways have been
a familiar feature over the years. As early as 1888 a Commission
investigated the number of staff employed which it was thought was
excessive. Incidentally the staff at that time numbered 868. Between
1936 and 1958 it fluctuated between 1,600 and 1,400 but the pro-
gressive withdrawal of facilities had reduced this number to El 50
by 1960.
The Commission of 1923 investigated amongst others matters the
perrenial questions of the “ farebilkers ”, known all over the
world. Most of the stations were “ open ”, that is to say, there was
more than one means of exit without going through a ticket barrier.
The only ” closed ” station was Port Louis Central and the familiar
trick was practised of buying a ticket to the next station, Casis, and
travelling on to Mahebourg without paying any further fare. The
Commission also found that many passengers travelled second class
to Vacoas, alighted and then travelled first class to their destination
without paying the difference in the fare. After Vacoas there was
apparently no inspection of the tickets.
The Officer Administering Government, Mr. (later Sir) Allan
Grannum said that having held a First Class Season Ticket from
Reduit to Port Louis for three months he had only been able to get
into a First Class compartment on four occasions, shades of the
business traveller in other parts of the world !
The first class passenger from Port Louis used an officially recog-
nised system of sending a messenger on ahead to put his card on a
seat on the train. If he did not turn up for that particular train the
messenger had to whip the card off just before the train started and
put it on the next train, and so on until his master turned up.
The same Commission investigated an application by the General
Manager of the Railways for an official motor car to be used by
himself and his Officers on ” surprise ” inspections of outlying
stations. Evidence was given that when they set out by either special
train or ordinary train their presence was signalled from the start to
warn the stations of their coming. Code names were used, the


General Manager being signalled as “ Wolf on the Line ” and the
Traffic Superintendent as “ Shark en route
As early as 1931 the Financial Commissioners had recommended
the suppression of all the passenger train services except those on the
Main Line betwteen Port Louis and Curepipe and in 1940 the Rail-
way, Road, Harbour and Lighterage Commissioners urged the com-
plete transfer of all passenger traffic to road services, sugar and
other freight to continue by rail. The latter Commissioners said that
probably by the year 1914 the Railways had reached their peak but
thereafter the construction of good roads in the Colony had
facilitated the development of road competition.
This Commission found that passenger fares in 1940 were one third
of those in 1914, indicating the strenuous effort to remain in the
business. General merchandise rates were about one half but sugar
rates were rather higher than in 1914. The Commissioners sadly
added that whenever fares were reduced the bus operators cut theirs
even lower. .


CHAPTER VI
The Mauritius Railways in Literature
some few writers on Mauritius have touched more or less briefly
on the Railways.
Charles John Boyle, General Manager of the Railways in 1862,
wrote a book "Far Away ” (1867, Chapman and Hall) that con-
tains a most amusing " ghost ” story about the Grand River North
West bridge. It frequently happened—so the story goes —that whilst
the bridge was being built, the previous day’s work was torn down
in the night. Other mysterious and unexplained incidents occurred
on the site. One night a workman kept watch and at last a sound
was heard —
" A clock heavily tolls out the hour —midnight of course —the
only time, I imagine, the tones of a clock were ever heard
here and for the best reason, for, if any clock there be, it is
an imaginary one. At the man’s feet lies a small, dark but
tranquil pool of water. At the last stroke of the clock’s iron
tongue, this pool is suddenly and strangely troubled
Attracted by the noise the man turns towards it.
Straight from the very centre rises up a tall female form clad in
glistening robe . . . with bouquets of sea-weed. Long green
hair flows down —not to her heels, having none, but to her
tail —and glassy eyes of the same colour glare fixedly at the
columns of the bridge. Up to them she solemnly stalks —
there is a sound like a strong gust of wind. It is a single
breath of the siren and down tumbles ever} inch of the
work . . .”
The siren orders the man to tell the Engineer in charge of the
bridge that unless she receives her price the bridge will never pro-
ceed. The story goes on —
" I never heard how long it took the man to collect his senses but
with daylight he stood before Mr. O. M. (the Engineer).
Mr. O.M. with laudable but not unusual alacrity, rushed off
as soon as he had washed his face, to the Colonial Secretary.
The Colonial Secretary is in bed but jumps out of it, drinks
his cup of coffee hurriedly and away to the Governor. His


Excellency is also in bed but quits it on the instant, shaves,
dresses, drinks his cup of coffee too and gives his orders. A
Council is instantly summoned . ,
The story concludes ** It is whispered that the Government, with
its usual promptitude, has effectually appeased the siren. At any
rate the bridge at the time I write, is nearly finished, all but its pain-
ting and I have myself crossed it twice on a trolley ”.
Nicholas Pike was in Mauritius fairly soon after the opening of
the Railways and in his " Sub Tropical Rambles ” (1873, Sampson,
Low, Marston and Searle ) comments on their value in opening up
the countryside for communications.
Barnwell and Toussaint in their ” History of Mauritius ” (1949,
Longmans Green & Co.) mention the beginning of the Railways in
1864 and add that the coming of this form of transport provided an
escape from malaria for those who could live in the uplands and
travel daily to and from Mauritius.
Sir Frank Swettenham who came to Mauritius in 1908 as Chair-
man of a Royal Commission of Enquiry in his book " Also and
Perhaps ” (1912, John Lane) says:
“ A railway and an unusual number of excellent roads give
easy access to every part of the Island. The railway was built
forty years ago and its needs have been sacrified to other
exigencies, so that it is only by good management that it
keeps going as well as it does ”,
Macmillan, in his “ Mauritius Illustrated ” (1914, Collingridge)
includes a factual description of the Mauritius Government Railways
with some extremely interesting photographs of the ‘ ‘ Double Decker
Train ” and the accident at Pailles bridge with the coaches strewn
in the river below. The building of the new bridge at Grand River
North West is also illustrated with, for good measure, technical
details of the work.
Malim, in his book “ Island of the Swan ” (1952, Longmans
Green & Co.) describes vividly a journey from Curepipe to Port
Louis on the day of a Race Meeting —
" The train came in fussily, drawn by a little black engine with
the Island’s arms emblazoned hugely on each tank. There
was a frenzied rush for seats. The coaches were mere boxes,
khaki-coloured, each on four wheels, with a large 1, 2 or
3 painted on each door. One would not have been at all
surprised to see a sheep knitting at the window of any of
them. The class distinctions were marked: 1 meant a leather
seat, 2 a wicker one, 3 mere wood. Broad wooden sun-shades
jutted out over each window.


" An enchanting train. As we took it in, the assault swept past us.
The ladies, one noticed, got, and evidently expected, no
quarter. We missed our chance, and looked, I suppose, rather
helpless. But a splendid person came to our rescue, dressed
all in blue with a green-banded cap which had a bobble on
top of it worthy of a French admiral. He presented himself
with a smile, bowed, produced a great key, ' cleared all sea-
roads ’ as it were, and led us down the train till he came to a
door marked 1 which he opened with a fine flourish. He held
the crowd at bay with the majesty of a Mussolini. As soon as
we were inside, he locked the door again. The crowd gaped.
He dismissed them with a glance. ‘ Canaille !’ it said, plainly
enough. ' Have you no manners at all?’
" The gesture by itself was enough to endear the Mauritian
Government Railways to us. That carriage was fragrant with
the mustiness of an old berlin. We sat down in it gingerly,
rather awed. We were distinctly vulgar anachronisms. The
engine piped a frail ‘ toot ’ and tugged us impatiently out of
the station. We clacketed briskly along from stop to stop. They
had curiously assorted names —Floreal, Vacoas, Phoenix,
Quatre Bornes, Beau Bassin, Rose Hill, Richelieu and
Failles. As we ran down the hill towards the sea, the guard
came clambering along the running board and put his head
in through the window to ask for our tickets. And ghosts
came with us all the way, genteel ghosts but warm. There
hung still about that ancient coach something of the thrill its
first passengers must have known. The craftsmanship of its
eighty-year-old fittings made one suddenly homesick for the
standards of a prouder and more generous age ".
And describing the scene at the Harbour Square in Port Louis he
writes —
” That crooked notice saying “ Beware of the Trains ” like the
one forbidding bathing on account of sharks, could only be
make believe . . . And then, suddenly, an electric bell began
to shrill, high up on the pole which said ‘ Beware of the
Trains ’. In the quiet among the lengthening shadows it
sounded hysterical, puny and absurd. Next there came a wild
shriek from a steam whistle. Out of the shadows into the
* square ’ came a man walking, ringing a hand-bell and hold-
ing aloft a red flag. Behind him, slowly—infinitely slowly—
came a train; the last train down from Pamplemousses. A
very, very old train of little high, square coaches ”.


Ommaney, writing in " The Shoals of Capricorn ” (1952, Spottis-
woode, Ballantyne Co.) says:
“ On the little railway that descends steeply from Curepipe among
the villas surrounded by bougainvillea and jacaranda and
through the sugar fields, the first and second class on the early
trains are occupied by stout gentlemen in drill suits and sun
helmets
Pope Hennessy in his biography of his grandfather, Sir John Pope
Hennessy (Governor of Mauritius 1883 to 1886 and 1888 to 1899),
entitled “ Verandah ” (1964, George Allen & Unwin) has two or
three brief references to the Mauritius Railways—
“ The morning descent, the evening ascent of business men
between Port Louis and Curepipe soon became almost a
ritual, each gentleman having his own recognised seat in the
litttle double-decker railway carriages, the lower deck, com-
fortably upholstered, for the first class, the upper deck, with
wooden benches, for the hoi polloi. The Governor had his
own ornate small railway carriage which would take him from
his private station at Le Reduit to the terminal at Port Louis
or to Beau Bassin or some other station along the line. Free
travel by rail when on public business was a Governor’s per-
quisite; but Sir John Pope Hennessy seldom used the rail-
way, preferring a smart horsedrawn victoria, with lacquered
door panels and shining harness
Describing a ball at Le Reduit on Bth August, 1883, Pope Hennessy
says:
“ The ball had been organised with particular care. A special
shuttle train service to and from Le Reduit station operated
until half past two in the morning. The little station itself was
carefully decorated with Venetian lanterns; a fleet of carriages
waited to take the guests up to the house and both avenues
were gay with Venetian and Chinese lanterns dancing merrily
in a slight wind


CHAPTER VII
The Final Stages
improvements in wages and higher expenses for everything used
on the Railways caused a sharp rise in the expenditure during the
post-war years but the Railways were faced with a dilemma. If
charges were increased, the competition they were facing from road
transport would become fiercer and their revenue would suffer
further.
In 1942 an attempt was made to arrest the drift of freight traffic
away from the Railways by the strengthening of the Heavy Goods
Ordinance (first introduced as a war emergency in 1939) which
stipulated that heavy goods traffic (including sugar from the Mills
to the Port) should be carried only by Railway. This was in fact the
final constructive measure in favour of the Railways and it was
undoubtedly an important factor reprieving the Railways from
extinction for another twenty two years.
A strike of railwaymen on October 1949 was not calculated to help
matters. For several days the services were disrupted and there was
some sabotage to railway equipment including locomotives.
By this time the Permanent Way Engineer was worried about
sleepers. Supplies of teak and jarrah had dried up and trials were
made first with timber from Rhodesia, then Douglas fir from Canada
and finally “ Pin Maritime ” from France. Some “ G.K.N.” cast
iron sleepers were also imported from England.
In earlier days when passenger train services were withdrawn from
Branch Lines and before the country was covered with a network of
bus and goods haulage services, the Mauritius Railways, concerned
for the needs of the public, usually arranged with Contractors for
alternative bus and goods haulage services to be run. Examples of
these were services between Montague Blanche and Riviere Seche
from May, 1929 and on the Black River Sections from July, 1929. The
services were run by the Contractors for a payment on a mileage
basis, the Railways retaining the revenue.
As far back as 1927 the Railways had themselves put on one or
two lorries used mainly for the conveyance of Government traffic
and ten years later they had four G-ton lorries with trailers and


three 3-ton lorries working in various parts of the country on sugar
and general merchandise traffic.
There came a time when it seemed that a serious attempt was to
be made to strike further into the passenger carrying and haulage
fields —in other words to carry the war into the “ enemy’s ” camp.
In the year 1950 three 7-ton lorries were put on to haul sugar from
Medine to the Docks in replacement of the railway service and on
general haulage work.
In 1951 a bus service was started by the Railways between Port
Louis and the Medine and Pointe aux Sables area. By 1961 a fleet
of three buses and ten lorries had been built up. This was however
only a very small drop in the ocean of road competition and its
main effect was to demonstrate a standard of good and reliable
services.
Almost at the eleventh hour the Mauritius Government Railways
had a chance to rise to a special occasion in the service of the
country. Her Royal Highness Princess Margaret visited Mauritius in
September, 1956 and special trains were run to the Capital, carrying
about 24,000 people including 7,000 schoolchildren. The Central
Station at Port Louis was gaily decorated and no doubt for years
to come many folk will remember with pleasure their journey to see
the Royal Princess.
But one royal visit does not save a business and it became clear
that the public liked the more flexible bus services better than their
railway. The Black River Line had been closed for all traffic in
October, 1950 and the Bois Cheri Light Railway in December, 1951.
The final stage of the withdrawal of the passenger train services came
with the reorganisation of the individually operated bus services
into regional companies in 1954. The passenger train services on the
remaining sections opened for passenger traffic were discontinued—
Montagne Blanche to Rose Hill in February 1954; Rose Belle to
Souillac in June 1954; Curepipe to Mahebourg in February 1955;
Port Louis to the North in March 1955; Port Louis to Curepipe in
March 1956.
On each occasion the passing of the railway drew surprisingly
little interest except for the final closure of the Port Louis to Cure-
pipe Line when the last train was full of passengers, many of them
children who had been taken by their parents for their first and last
ride on the railway. At Quatrc Bornes Station there were speeches
and fire-crackers.
After the final suppression of the passenger train services in 1956
the railway’s functions consisted solely of the carriage of sugar from
the Mills to the Port and such other heavy freight traffic (fertilisers,


etc.), as were reserved to the railways under the Heavy Goods
Ordinance. The sugar traffic, which was substantial (the Railways
carried 404,000 tons in 1962) was unfortunately for the railways a
purely seasonal business lasting from about July to December in
each year. The maintenance of a railway system for effective use for
six months a year was understandably expensive and was naturally
an important element in the economic and financial considerations
relating to its future.
The remaining lines of the Mauritius Government Railways were
finally shut down in four stages. The far ends of the North and
Savanne Lines were pulled in to Argy and Union Siding respectively
in June, 1962; the St. Pierre to Rose Hill line was closed in 1961
(thus completing the closure of the West to East Line from Rose Hill
to Riviere Seche); the whole of the Midland and Savanne Lines from
Mahebourg and Union Siding to Port Louis were closed down in
1963 and finally the North Line from Port Louis to Argy was dis-
continued on sth February, 1964.
In the General Election of 1963 a ballot paper was handed in with
the words scrawled over it “ You have taken away the railway jobs
that Queen Victoria gave us ”.


CHAPTER VIII
The End and a Beginning
thus comes to an end the story of a century. The fluctuations of
fortune of the Mauritius Government Railways followed broadly the
same pattern as small railways all over the world. There was the
brave pioneering period when the railways were much needed and
very popular. Up to and during the Wars was the fruitful period
when railways really made money. They represented a tremendous
revolution converting the transport system from animals to steam
traction. Then came the era of modern transport ruthlessly eating
away at the passenger traffic, the cane traffic and the general
merchandise traffic.
Rising costs of operation occurred to both forms of transport but
the balance was always against the railways. Artificial methods of
keeping heavy goods, including the sugar, to railway by law staved
off the final surrender but did not prevent it.
For over forty years the writing was on the wall. The reluctance
of the Governments of the day to close down the railways earlier
was understandable.
It was in the end not an easy decision to take but it had to be
taken in the interest of good national housekeeping. The Manage-
ments and the staff made a tremendously good fight of it but the
facts of life were against them. The Railways were too small to
survive the rough and tumble of competition in a narrowly confined
island, and to some extent they were fighting against unfair com-
petition. Until very recent years the Railways were the only properly
organised public transport services. Being a Government under-
taking they paid recognised levels of wages and gave reasonable
conditions of service to their employees which did not apply to their
competitors. Their battle will long be remembered in this lovely
country in the Indian Ocean.
What has happened to the railway material ? Some has found good
use in the service of Government. Old wooden coaches containing
teak have been dismantled to make desks, chairs and cupboards of
solid utility. Some sleepers, rails and fencing have been useful in the


maintenance of Government buildings and some of the wayside
stations have been turned into offices or converted for the purposes
of road traffic centres. The rest of the material will be sold by Public
Tender.
But from the ashes is rising the " Phoenix ” of further road
improvements to ease the circulation of traffic. Already a new road
has been built on the railway track from Forest Side to Phoenix on
which the sugar from Grand Port and Savanne was carried in 1963.
