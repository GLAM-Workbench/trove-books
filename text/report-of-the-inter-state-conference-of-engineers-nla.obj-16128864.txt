INTER-STATE CONFERENCE OF ENGINEERS
ON
RIVER MURRAY AND TRIBUTARIES.
1. REPORT OE THE ENGINEERS.
To the Honorable the Premiers of New South Wales , Victoria , and South Australia .
We, the Engineers representing the States of New South Wales, Victoria, and
South Australia, appointed in accordance with the following resolution, which was passed
by the Premiers of New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia in conference at
Melbourne, on the 23rd January, 1911—
" 1. That the Engineers of the three States be instructed to inquire without
delay, and present to the Premiers by the Ist December, 1911, a
Report and recommendations based upon data now available, and
on such further data as they shall obtain by that date, which will,
in their opinion, be essential or conducive to a settlement by agreement
between the States of New South Wales, Victoria, and South Aus-
tralia, of the question of the River Murray and its Tributaries.
“ 2. That for the purpose of such inquiry and Report the Engineers may
jointly engage such professional assistance as may be necessary.
“ 3. That the cost of the inquiry and Report be shared equally by the three
States.”
have the honour to present our Report.
Prom the terms of the resolution it will be observed that the Engineers were
instructed to present their Report to the Premiers by the Ist December, 1911. This
was not possible, as the representative for South Australia was absent on official business
in England, Europe, and America, and was unable to attend any meeting until 17th
January, 1912 —the first meeting of the Conference. On this cause of delay in making
a commencement being explained to them, the Premiers of the three interested States
granted an extension of time until the Ist June, 1912. We considered it necessary to
state that even this extension might be found insufficient, chiefly on account of the
large amount of additional survey work required. This anticipation has proved correct.
For the collection and arrangement of data for the preparation of the Report
the following Staff was appointed :
Mr. E. Checchi, Engineer permanently in charge of all gauging work for the
State of Victoria, as Chief Engineering Officer for the investigation.
Mr. A. S. French, Engineering Surveyor attached to the River Gauging
Branch of the Public Works Department, New South Wales, to assist
generally, and especially in connexion with the preparation of the New
South Wales data.
Mr. H. Eaton, Engineering Surveyor on the staff of the Engineer-in-Chief’s
Department of South Australia, and who is conversant with the gaugings
of the River Murray in South Australia, to furnish information required
in this respect.
Mr. D. McLean, 8.C.E., as office assistant in making computations and the
preparation of diagrams.
Surveyors were from time to time appointed as required.
Mr. P. J. O’Malley, by arrangement with the State Rivers and Water Supply
Commission of Victoria, of which body he is an officer, was appointed Secretary to
the Conference,


2. SCOPE OF THE CONFERENCE.
At the first formal session of the Conference it was found that difference of
opinion existed as to the scope of the Inquiry, Mr. de Burgh and Mr. Dethridge holding
that the instructions called for recommendations on all matters, including navigation and
the apportionment of water between the States for irrigation, which are matters of
policy, while Mr. Graham Stewart explained that the instructions accompanying his
appointment empowered him to determine facts and to make recommendations only
on engineering matters —such as storage and locking as a means of conserving, control-
ling, and generally rendering to the greatest extent available, for the purposes of any
agreement, the waters of the River Murray and its Tributaries —and not on policy,
which was a matter for the Governments concerned on the Report being presented.
On Mr. Stewart verifying bis position and finding it to be as explained, it was decided to
proceed as far as possible in securing agreement as to the facts and then reconsider the
question of recommendations.
3. GENERAL INFORMATION AS TO THE RIVER MURRAY
PROBLEM.
The history of the river question, geography, and physical characteristics of the
River Murray basin, the methods of gauging the volumes of the main and contributing
streams, and the nature of the several interests involved having been sufficiently
described for present purposes in the Reports of former Commissions —notably the
Inter-State Royal Commission of 1902 —it is felt to be only necessary to refer to these
matters where a special purpose requires such a course.
4. ADDITIONAL GAUGINGS AVAILABLE.
The task of bringing up to date all information concerning gaugings, and arriving
at agreement as to what might be acccepted as the most reliable data available for the
purpose of the Inquiry, was one of the first taken in hand. This work took several
months, because in many cases, though observation work had been regularly attended
to, the computation and recording of results had been allowed to get into arrears. In
the case of the Morgan gaugings, a discharge curve compiled from recent observations
has been adopted and a new table prepared on this basis, which brings these in closer
agreement with the upper river gaugings. When all returns were available it was found
that the results obtained by the officers of each State, who had worked independently
of each other, were generally in such agreement that no discrepancy of any moment
required to be adjusted. The apparent discrepancy which is still shown in some years
between the yearly totals of the Morgan and up-river gaugings is due to these being
taken for each calendar year, and not for the year extending from one low river to
another, which may be taken as from the Ist May to 30th April. As the records of
gaugings must always be of prime importance in any consideration of the River Murray
question, complete statements of those for the principal stations are attached to this
Report. (See Appendix No. 1.)
5. PROPORTION OF CONTRIBUTIONS BY NEW SOUTH WALES,
VICTORIA, AND QUEENSLAND.
At the time of the 1902 Commission the information available respecting the
contribution by New South Wales above Jingellic was very meagre. Actual gaugings
of the principal tributaries in this locality, and observations of rainfall at stations under
the control of the Commonwealth Meteorologist on this catchment, are now available.
The gaugings of the Murrumbidgee at Hay and of the Darling at Menindie have also
been brought up co date. In view of all the data, which we regard as sufficiently

Of these streams only the Swampy Plains Creek, the Tooma, and the Indi Rivers are gauged.
The figures for the catchments of the Swampy Plains, Corryong, and Cudgewa
Creeks include
areas of 40, 22 and 21 square miles respectively, which discharge directly into the River Murray.
6. THE ACRE-FOOT UNIT.
Throughout this investigation the units used, where others are not specially
mentioned, are —
The acre foot for storages ;
The acre foot per month for stream flows.
The advantage of these units is that the statement of any volume in acre feet permits
of a quick perception of the area of land it will cover for irrigation.
The use of the acre foot per month facilitates computation of the use that can
be made of stream flows either in connexion with storage or the irrigation of land. The
equivalents in cubic feet are —
Acre feet. Cubic feet.
1 = 43,560
23 = 1,001,880 (approximately one million).
An acre foot per month is approximately equal to a cubic foot per minute.
7. LOSSES BY EVAPORATION AND PERCOLATION.
The varying conditions of the seasons, of the shape of cross section of the streams
and the geological formation of their beds preclude any estimate as to the losses by
evaporation and percolation being made that can be regarded as other than a mere
approximation. But after a study of the actual losses indicated by gaugings, on several
sections of the main stream and the principal tributaries, it was concluded that , for
present purposes an average of the losses by percolation and evaporation in the rivers
might be taken as *OOO3 per unit of volume per mile of river. Thus, in the case of a
volume of 1,000 units entering the section 1,040 miles in length between the proposed
Upper Murray Storage at Oumberoona anil Lake Victoria weir site (near Frenchman's
Creek), 732 might be expected at the lower end. The losses in the storages have been
roughly estimated)at 4 feet in depth per annum in the upper storages, 6 feet in Lake
Victoria, and |9 feet in the river from Lake Victoria to; the .mouth, disregarding the
expansion of the river into Lakes Alexandrina and Albert. These estimates of losses
may have to be varied in the light of further experience and gaugings.
8. RIVER AND TRIBUTARIES MUST BE CONSIDERED AS A WHOLE.
It has been suggested that each of the Upper States might have complete control
of the tributaries in its own territory, and that the control of the main stream might be
left to a separate authority. We desire to poiiit out that', without the effective-contri-
butions of its chief tributaries, the volume of the river would be a small proportion of
the total of the river and its tributaries, the area of catchment directly supplying the
main Stream being relatively small, We have, therefore, considered the nVer system
as a whole.


9. NEED FOR REGULATION TO EQUALIZE VARIATIONS OF FLOW.
The solution of the problem of making, to the extent possible, full use of the '
waters of the Murray system, largely depends upon regulation by storage, so that the
water which now runs to waste during the season or period of the year, when there is
little need for irrigation, and more than sufficient for navigation and other purposes,
may be reserved for the season or period when it is needed ; and also in order that
the surplus in years of high flow may, as far as possible, £>e carried forward to those of
y low flow. The diagrams of flow accompanying this Report show how great the variation
of flow is, not only between winter and summer, but also between different groups
of years.
10. EXTENT TO WHICH IT IS POSSIBLE TO REGULATE THE RIVER BY
STORAGE.
... . .
The ideal condition of regulation by storage would be that which would enable
all water discharged from the catchments of the system, less inevitable losses, to be com-
pletely controlled and made available in the volumes and at the times most suitable.
The attainment of complete control of the flow at all times may, however, be declared
impossible because of the inordinate cost of the storages that would be needed to impound
the floods of high years such as 1894 and 1906.
The question therefore becomes one of how near the ideal condition can be
approached with due regard to financial practicability^and with a view to determining
this, investigation has been made of a number of storage sites on the main stream and
tributaries, including a re-examination of the site at Cumberoona proposed by the
1902 Royal Commission, and surveys of sites on the Upper Murray, the Mitta, Kiewa,
and Ovens, and also of the shallow basins of the Murray near the affluence of the
Broken Creek at Barmah. As the Goulburn, Murrumbidgee. and Lake Victoria
storage possibilities are being dealt with by each of the States more directly concerned
in their construction, we considered ! it unnecessary to extend our surveys to them.
Particulars of the above surveys and available information on record are given in the
Report by Mr. Checchi, marked “ Appendix No. 2.”
No investigations have been made for regulating the waters of the River Dar-
ling ; the prospect of any regulation of its flow by storage that would materially assist
in the scheme of regulation of the main river being very small.
11. MEASURE OF VALUE OF A STORAGE WORK.
In determining the value of any storage work in making more water
for use, the actual capacity of the storage is not the true measure of benefit. In the case
of irrigation the requirements of a typical scheme may be taken as a supply at a fairly
uniform rate for the period of nine months, August to April inclusive. Examination
of a typical-diagram of flow such as that of the Murray at Albury (see Diagram J) will
show that the natural flow is in most years sufficient for any probable requirements
for irrigation in the months August to December inclusive. The shortages which
impose a rigid limit to any considerable development of irrigation from natural flow
alone occur in the months January to April. The benefits derivable from a storage
of sufficient capacity are not only the making good of the shortages in the latter period,
but also the use of a much greater quantity of the natural flow in the first part of the
period. The measure of benefit of any storage is therefore the increase in use of water
made possible by it.
12. VALUE OF STORAGES TO SAFEGUARD AGAINST DROUGHT.
In times of severe drought, such as that of 1902-3, it is usual to have strongly
expressed public opinion that the evil effects could be, to a large extent, prevented by
storage of river waters. While much might be done in the way of mitigation, it does
not seem that any works of sufficient magnitude to provide for the abnormal conditions
Occurring at intervals of many years are practicable.
Indeed it is questionable whether any scheme of storage is possible which, in
addition to providing for the irrigation development made possible by regulation of flows
Apt varying widely from those of normal seasons, would also provide for a drpught period


such as that of 1902-3. Even if suitable sites could be found for such storages, and it
was certain that the storages would be effective, the interest charges on their cost, which
would run on during the numerous seasons when there would be no need for such
reserve water, would go far to outweigh the benefits derivable when droughts occurred.
13. EXISTING STORAGE WORKS AND WORKS UNDER CONSTRUCTION IN
THE THREE STATES.
New South Wales.— The only storage work at present authorized that will
appreciably affect the flow of the River Murray is the Burrinjuck Reservoir, now under
construction, on the Murrumbidgee, above the junction of the Tumut. It has a capacity
of 766,000 acre feet, which, with the natural flow of the Tumut, will make 120,000 acre
feet per month available for diversion during the irrigation season, and provide a supply
for domestic and stock requirements along the Murrumbidgee to its junction with the
Murray, and on the Yanco Creek (see Diagram E.) Surveys for works for the regulation
of the Tumut River have been made, but no such works are contemplated in the
immediate future.
Victoria. —The following storages have been constructed :
Goulhurn River Weir. —Capacity, 20,000 acre feet.
Waranga Reservoir. —Capacity, 197,000 acre feet, filled by a channel from the
Goulburn Weir 23J miles long; bed width, 110 feet; depth, 7 feet;
gradient, 6 inches per mile; discharging capacity, 100,000 acre feet
per month. The water from this storage is used almost solely for
irrigation. t -
Kow Swamp Storage. —Capacity, 41,000 acre feet; filled by a channel
17 miles long, which leaves the River Murray at Torrumbarry, and has
a discharging capacity of 50,000 acre feet per month. The off-take
sill is 5 feet above summer level of the river.
Laanecoorie Storage. —Formed by a weir on the Loddon, capacity, 14,000
acre feet.
Kerang Lakes Storage. —Capacity, 92,000 acre feet. This storage comprises
the basins known as Reedy, Middle, and Third Lakes, Lake Charm,
Race-course, Cullen's, and Kangaroo Lakes, and Lake Tutchewop.
These are filled by improved natural water-courses and depend mainly
on floods from the Loddon River for their supply.
Colihan River. —Two storages above Malmsbury, with capacities of 12,250
and 15,000 acre feet respectively.
There are other storages of small capacity on the catchment
of the Murray, but none of these appreciably affect the behaviour of
the river.
South Australia. —Lake Bonney has a storage capacity of about 48,000 acre
feet with a depth of 15 feet of water, and operations are now in progress ‘for utilizing
this for irrigation purposes. It would be possible to increase the capacity of the
storage to 80,000 acre feet.
14. EXTENT OF IRRIGATION AT PRESENT PROM THE MURRAY AND ITS
TRIBUTARIES.
The extent to which irrigation is at present carried on in the three States is as
follows: —
New South Wales. —Apart from private schemes, the area under irrigated
culture from the Murray and its tributaries, is confined chiefly to the comparatively
small settlements at Wentworth and Hay, and to so much of the Murrumbidgee scheme
as is already developed. According to information supplied by the Management of
the Murrumbidgee area, and by the Agricultural Department, the area embraced totals
about 12,000 acres. ,
Assuming the private irrigation schemes from all tributaries of the. Murray in
New South Wales, to deal with 5,000 acres, a total of 17,000 acres would be reached.
In the absence of complete records, the quantity of water used upon these areas
is assumed to be 42,500 acre feet during the irrigating season, or about one-seventh that
used in Victoria.

Victoria. —The principal irrigated areas are those in the Goulburn Valley and
lands adjacent thereto, and Mildura. Particulars of these are given in the following
extract from the Annual Report of the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission for
1911-12, in which the total area is stated as 213,611 acres, and during the irrigation
season about 300,000 acre feet were used upon these areas.
It will be seen that a large proportion—about a third —of the irrigated area in
Victoria is for pasture. At certain seasons in dry years the diversions by Victoria
approximate to the flow of the tributaries in that State.
South Australia. —The principal irrigation settlement is at Renmark, where
about 5,500 acres are under irrigated culture, planted principally with citrus and other
fruit-trees and vines.
In addition to Renmark, there are settlements at Beri, Lyrup, Pyap, Moorook,
Kingston, Waikerie, Ramco, and a number of other places between Ramco and Welling-
ton. The total area under irrigation from the River Murray in South Australia is about
20,500 acres, and the quantity of water used during the irrigation season about 56,000
acre feet.
Ah area of about 15,000 acres near Lake Bonney is in course of being brought
Wider irrigation as the Cobdogla Irrigation Scheme.

15. PLACE OF DELIVERY OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA'S SHARE OF WATER.
In view of the Inter-State Agreement in accordance with which the Government
of South Australia proposes to construct works for diverting water to, and storing it
in Lake Victoria, for the purpose of this Report we have taken the site (at or near
Frenchman's Creek) of the weir to divert to the lake as the place where South Australia
will in future receive her share of water.
16. STATEMENT OF REQUIREMENTS FOR IRRIGATION AS SUPPLIED BY
THE STATE PREMIERS.
In order to obtain definite statements of requirements a letter in the following
form was sent to the Premiers of each of the three interested States on 21st February,
1912 :
Sir,
I am directed by the Conference of State Engineers to request that you
will be so good as to cause to be furnished for their use the following infor-
mation with regard to the State of (New South Wales, Victoria, or South Aus-
tralia, according to the destination of the letter) —
(а) Plans showing areas and situation of all land proposed to be
irrigated from the River Murray and its tributaries.
(б) A statement of classification of the land of such areas with
special regard to suitability for irrigation.
(c) The quantities of water required for such areas, the period of
the year during which the water would be used and method
of application—whether by pumping or gravitation.
(d) Particulars of all storage works proposed to be constructed
on the Murray and its tributaries.
In view of the expressed wish of the Premiers of the States interested,
that the Report of the Engineers on (Hie River Murray should be furnished
at the earliest possible date, I have to ask you to be good enough to cause
the information asked for above to be supplied not later than one month from
this date.
I have the honour to be, Sir,
Your obedient Servant,
(Sgd.) P. J. O'Malley, Secretary.
Statements received in reply are given with this Report as Appendix “ No. 3."
Summarized briefly, the areas of land stated to be irrigable and the volumes of
water required therefor, are as follows :
17. EXTENT OF REGULATION CONSIDERED PRACTICABLE IN PRESENT
CIRCUMSTANCES.
In general it may be said, that the object of storage is to conserve the flood
discharge to supplement the low discharge of the same year. Its economic limits are
determined by such periods of low flow as that from the year 1896 to the year 1899
inclusive,

The following is a statement of the regulated flows that would be made
available—subject to some diminution in such abnormally dry seasons as 1902-3 —as
the result of existing works, works under construction, and works suggested by
this Conference for construction: —
It may be found desirable and financially practicable to extend works for regu-
lation to other tributaries as development of settlement demands a greater water supply,
but the cost of these per unit regulated will be considerably higher than that of
any of the works now suggested.
18. EXTENT OF IRRIGATION POSSIBLE WITH PRACTICABLE REGULATION
AS DESCRIBED.
Under the heading “ Navigation with Unlocked River/" it is explained that the
regulated flows made available by storages cannot be regarded as sufficient for both
navigation and irrigation unless the river be locked. For the present purpose considera-
tion will be confined to the use of the regulated flows for domestic and stock supply, for
making good the inevitable losses from the river channels and storage basins, for lockage
in the portion of the river between Lake Victoria inlet and the mouth —being the main
portion of the length of river about to be dealt with by South Australia, under the
Murray Works Act of 1910 of that State, and the Inter-State Agreement thereunder,
respecting works at Lake Victoria, &c. (subject to ratification by the Parliaments of
the three States) —and for irrigation.
Taking domestic and stock supply first, the allowance is at the rate of 9,000 gallons
per mile per day, for the following mileages
Lake frontages .. New South Wales .. 560 miles.
„ „ .. Victoria .. .. 170 „

Approximately the amount of this allowance for

amount to .. .. .. .. 80,000-
Computed requirements for lockage in South Aus-
tralia .. .. .. .. .. 5,000
Total .. .. 95,000'


Of tliis total of 95,000 acre feet per month (most of which, as indicated
m Part 7, is a rough approximation as regards losses), it is assumed that an
average of 47,000 would be required for Lake Victoria and the portion of the
river from Lake Victoria inlet to the mouth ; but without any allowance for the
expansion of the river into Lakes Alexandria and Albert. The remainder would
be required on the main river and tributaries upstream from Lake Victoria inlet,
and the storages thereon. The total of the regulated flows (626,000 acre feet)
reduced by the total of the foregoing allowance of 95,000, leaves 531,000 acre
feet as the regulated monthly flow assumed to be available for irrigation. In New
South Wales the irrigation season is Stated as nine months'’.' in Victoria eight months
is usually allowed; in South Australia it is stated as from eight to twelve months.
If nine months be taken as the mean of the seasons throughout the States, the total
annual quantity for diversions for irrigation becomes 4,779,000 acre feet. The area of
land irrigable with this volume depends largely on proximity to the point of diversion,
character of soil, and the land of crops watered. Losses between the point of diversion
and the irrigable lands, which in New South Wales and Victoria, owing chiefly to the
greater length of the channels are greater than in South Australia, would almost cer-
tainly amount to from 30 to 50 per cent, of the diverted volumes. If 40 per cent, be
taken as the mean of such losses, averaged for the three States, the total volume delivered
at the irrigators* fields would be 2,867,400 acre feet. If the further assumption be made
that as an average each irrigable acre required 2 acre feet of water, the total area irri-
gable becomes 1,433,700, or in round figures, 1,400,000 acres. This area is so much
below the total of the areas for which the States, according to the statements furnished
by them in Part 16, require water, that no hope can be extended of such requirements
ever being satisfied. It may, however, be pointed out that although small in pro-
portion to such stated requirements, the area of 1,400,000 acres is nearly six times as
great as that at present under irrigation in the three States.
19. NEW STORAGES REQUIRED FOR THE SCHEME OF PEACTICABLE
EEGULATION.
The Jnter-State Eoyal Commission of 1902 proposed a storage on the Upper
Murray at Cumberoona to impound 582,000 acre feet of water, and with the aid of the
natural flows of the Mitta and Kiewa, to maintain a nearly continuous flow 61 180,000
acre feet per month at Albury.
We have carefully reviewed all the gaugings at Albury and Jingellic on the
Murray, at Tallangatta on the Mitta, and at Kiewa on the Kiewa, and have arrived
at the conclusion that it is desirable in order to take full advantage of the flows of these
rivers, that a storage with capacity of 1,000,000 acre feet be provided. Such a storage
with the aid of the natural flows of the Mitta and Kiewa Eivers would enable a regulated
flow of 240,000 acre feet a month for the nine months August to April inclusive to be
maintained at Albury. (See Diagram C.)
In comparison with such a site as that at Burrinjuck on the Murrumbidgee,
Cumberoona cannot be regarded as a very favorable place for a large reservoir. The
length of dam required—B,ooo feet—is very great; the foundation is, in parts, at
least 50 feet below the surface ; and considerable portions of the area of about 20,000
acres that would be submerged are flat lands which, though liable to occasional flooding,
are of high value for grazing, and to some extent for cultivation. These considerations
caused us to seek more favorable sites higher up the river. Two of these, one at Wagra,
and the other at Dora Dora, where in each case the river valley narrows to about 2,000
feet, on surface indications appeared very favorable for the construction of masonry
dams, and the preliminary testing by hand boring and pit sinking failed to disclose any
special difficulty in the construction of such works. When, however, a diamond drill
was brought into operation to fully test the foundations, it was found that depths to
solid rock were—l 44 feet at Dora Dora, and 205 feet at Wagra.
The great depth of foundation required at both Wagra and Dora Dora has decided
us to provisionally adopt the site at Cumberoona, as recommended by the Inter-State
Eoyal Commission of 1902, for the construction of a dam to impound 1,000,000 acre
feet, but it is possible that by a further expenditure of time and money a more suitable
one, both in the matter of foundations and length of dam, might be found above the sites
already tested. Though of opinion that such expenditure would be justified, in view of
the conclusion at which we have arrived —that a storage of a capacity of 1,000,000 acre
feet is desirable in order to give the regulated flow of 240,000 acre feet a month, for nine
months at Albury, and can be obtained at Cumberoona —we thought it unnecessary to
postpone the presentation of our Eeport until it was ascertained whether a better site
than Cumberoona was available for the purpose.

Tie gaugings of the Murray, at Jingellic, have been used in computing the quah-
tity of water available for the suggested storage, so that no alteration in these figures
would be necessary for any site between that place and the junction of the Mitta.
The type of dam proposed at the Cumberoona site, in the event of its final
adoption, is an earth dam, with reinforced concrete core wall carried down to the
granite rock underlying the site, and the estimated cost, inclusive of £200,000 for land
compensation, is £1,353,000.
*The River Goulburn is regarded most favorably for further storage in Victoria.
Several sites above the existing weir have been investigated and dams to impound
volumes ranging from 250,000 to 1,500,000 acre feet appear possible, but in every case
one or 'more of the difficulties arising from deep and uncertain foundations, great size
of dam in proportion to capacity, and interference with railways, towns, or valuable
river flats, are met with. At present a reservoir site at the junction of the Goulburn
and Delatite Rivers, with maximum capacity of 720,000 acre feet is being explored,
but for the purpose of this Report the extra storage of 500,000 acre feet on the Goulburn
mentioned in statement of Victorian requirements has been taken tentatively for the
scheme of practicable diversions ; this, with the aid of existing storages, would enable
the flow at Murchison to be regulated to 126,000 acre feet per month during an irrigation
season of eight months. (See Diagram F.)
In South Australia no natural economic storage sites of any magnitude are to be
found between Morgan and the South Australian boundary, and we are agreed that
Lake Victoria, improved by works for regulating the inflow and outflow, would be the
most effective storage for use on the lower river. (See Diagram D.)
The following particulars of this storage are published in the Report of the Inter-
State Royal Commission of 1902: —
Capacity, 514,000 acre feet. Area of water surface, 26,515 acres.
Reduced level when full, 95 * 00.
Estimates are being prepared by the South Australian Government of the cost
of the works necessary to convert the lake into a storage*
20. NAVIGATION WITH UNLOCKED RIVERS.
The volumes required at Morgan for navigation are —
Full draught, 6 feet, on Morgan gauge, 442,000 acre feet per month
Medium „ 5 „ „ 347,000 „ „
Light „ 3 „ „ 223,000 „ „
Diagrams A, G, H, and I show the extent to which navigation has been
reduced by existing diversions, and the effect, assuming diversions to be increased
as suggested under Parts 17 and 18. A study of these diagrams shows that while past
diversions have had comparatively little effect upon the duration of the navigable
period of the river, the proposed diversions would seriously reduce it, and when fully
developed, would practically destroy navigation. The following is a statement of the
number of months in each year for the last twenty-one years during which the flow in
South Australia was or would have been insufficient for full draught navigation under the
three following conditions:-—(!) “ Natural flow ” ; (2) “ Flow as reduced by actual
diversions ” ; (3) “ Flow as it would have been with diversions after construction of the
works suggested under Part 17.”

Column (3) shows the estimated effect in South Australia of the diversions,
after the construction of the suggested works. From the South Australian boundary to
Echuca, on the Murray, and Hay, on the Murrumbidgee, the effect in reducing the
number of months of navigation would be even greater.
Any volume released from the proposed storages towards maintaining the natural
duration of navigation as shown in column (l),in an unlocked river, must mean a corre-
sponding reduction in the volume available for irrigation. The period of release towards
restoring natural navigability or for irrigation would probably be the same. To attempt
to provide for constant navigation, or to substantially improve the present conditions
of navigation, in an unlocked river with stored water, would practically mean the use
of the storages for that purpose alone. There is no possibility of meeting the require-
ments of irrigation to the extent mentioned in Part 18 without rendering the river
practically useless for navigation unless locking be resorted to.
21. NAVIGATION WITH LOCKED RIVERS.
We understand —as mentioned in Part 18 —that South Australia is considering
the construction, at her own cost, of the Lake Victoria works, and the locks and weirs
necessary to maintain navigation throughout the year from the Murray mouth in South
Australia to Wentworth in New South Wales. The question of apportionment
of the cost of locks and weirs constructed in advance of, but which may afterwards
become effective for the purposes of, a general system of locking of the .Murray
and its tributaries, the Darling and the Murrumbidgee, would, doubtless, be
considered in connexion with any agreement between the States (see Clause 42 of the
Inter-State Agreement of 1907-8). Apart from volumes required for irrigation, and
for domestic and stock supply, the quantity of water required for a locked river below
Lake Victoria would be that for loss by evaporation and percolation estimated to be
28,800 acre feet per month (which would occur in any case), and 5,000 acre feet per month
for lockage. The total mean requirement for these purposes from the Murray mouth
to Lake Victoria is therefore 33,800 acre feet per month. This does not make any
provision for evaporation on the lakes near the mouth.
With regard to the cost of locking the rivers, on page 43 of the Inter-State Royal
Commission's Report of 1902, the following estimate is given for providing locks and
weirs for the navigation of the Murray, Murrumbidgee, and Darling :
The lengths of rivers referred to above are—Murray, 906 miles; Darling, 1,187
miles; and Murrumbidgee, 240 miles.
In the Report of the Victorian Royal Commission on the Murray Waters of 1910,
on page Ixi, reference is made to the cost of locking the rivers, and the opinion is
expressed that the estimates previously given would be found insufficient for the work.

Mr. Stuart Murray, in his Report to the South Australian Government, dated
February, 1910, estimates the cost of the six locks and weirs required in South Australia
at £482,428, and the two locks between the South Australian boundary and French-
man’s Creek at £160,000, the purpose of the locks being to make the river navigable
from the mouth to Wentworth and facilitate storage at Lake Victoria.
With a view to expert guidance as to the best methods to be adopted, the whole
system of locks required to provide permanent navigation between the Murray mouth
and Wentworth is being reported upon for the Government of South Australia by
Captain Johnston, of the Corps of Engineers, United States Army.
The Victorian Government recently carried out exploratory work and prepared
a design for a movable weir and lock in the Murray at Torrumbarry, and it is estimated
that the work will cost £130,000.
Until actual experience of the difficulties to be overcome has .been gained, the
question of cost of locking the Murray and its tributaries must remain, to some extent,
an open one.
While agreeing with the, statement on page 48 of the 1902 Report that weirs
and locks for navigation will provide no additional storage for irrigation, we would add
that in the case of any weirs and locks that may be constructed on the rivers above Lake
Victoria, no draw upon storage would be involved because the supply for irrigation
and other purposes that would have to be sent down the river in any case would be
more than sufficient for all lockage requirements.
In the portion of the river in South Australia, weirs and locks will, to some
extent, assist irrigation, because without them the river might fall to the level at which
it tends to become brackish through salt ooze from the banks. In the portions of the
river above Lake Victoria, excepting where large diversions are proposed, the need of
weirs and locks may be regarded as apart from use of the water for irrigation, but weirs
and locks would be required to maintain navigation as and when diversions for irrigation
(see Parts 17 to 19) take place.
22. EXTENT OF REDUCTION OF FLOW AT THE INLET TO LAKE
VICTORIA.
The following table shows in figures the estimated reduction in the annual volumes
of flow in the river at Lake Victoria, on the assumption that the diversions in the Upper
States stated under “ Extent of regulation practicable in present circumstances ”
(Part 17), and “ Extent of irrigation possible, &c. ” (Part 18), had been made, during
the period of twenty-one years covered by the table.
Table showing the Natural Flow of the River Murray above Lake Victoria, and the Equivalent of certain
assumed Diversions by the Upper States in thousand acre feet per annum.


The large percentage of natural flow remaining above the inlet to Lake Victoria,
as shown in the above table, might suggest that sufficient provision remains for South
Australian requirements after the diversions in the upper rivers consequent upon the
construction of the suggested storages and works for diversion of water have been made.
It must, however, be explained that such is not the case, for most of this water reaches
South Australia during flood periods in such large volumes that the greater portion of
it cannot be either stored or used. It might also be suggested that a greater quantity
could be diverted by the Upper States, but these diversions are limited by a succession
of low years such as 1896 to 1899, and as mentioned under Part 17 by the probably
excessive cost of storages other than those already suggested.
23. COST OF STORAGES AND WORKS FOR DISTRIBUTION OF REGULATED
FLOWS.
As stated in Part 19, the estimated cost of the storage at Cumberoona is £1,353,000.
No precise estimate can be given for the extra storage on the Goulburn, because
the site has not been finally selected. It is, however, known that the cost will be about
£2 per acre foot, so that about £1,000,000 would be required for the further storage of
500.000 acre feet.
In the case of the Burrinjuck Reservoir, it is understood that when completed
the cost will also approximate to £1,000,000.
The estimates given by the 1902 Royal Commission, for works to convert Lake
Victoria into a storage, including the diverting weir with lock, in the river, amount
to £84,800. It is probable, however, that when complete information has been
obtained, this estimate will be found to be too flow, and that at least another £BO,OOO
will be required, bringing the total up to say, £164,800.
Omitting Burrinjuck reservoir because it is practically in existence, the estimated
cost of the further storages required for the scheme of practicable regulation described
in Parts 17 to 19 amounts to £2,517,800, all of which would have to be provided in the
future.
Before the regulated water made available by the storages could be brought
into use, diverting weirs, pumping stations and distributary channels would have to be
provided. It ‘is elsewhere shown that, including areas already supplied, irrigation
would be extended to about 1,400,000 acres. It may be assumed that existing works —
including the Burrinjuck scheme when in full operation—provide for distribution over
600.000 acres, leaving 800,000 acres yet to be selected for irrigation throughout the
three States, for which works of distribution would be required. The cost per acre
of such works depends upon the character of the country, the size of the holdings
supplied, and many other considerations. In. the valley of the Goulburn it is about
£3 per acre, but at Mildura and Renmark, where the channels are mostly lined with
concrete, it is as high as £lO per acre.
Por an average throughout the 800,000 acres in question, with diverting weirs
and pumping stations included, £4 10s. per acre might be taken as a rough approximation
of cost, giving for distribution works a total of £3,600,000.
It thus appears that the total further expenditure required to extend irrigation
with the waters of the River Murray and its tributaries to cover an aggregate area of
about 1,400,000 acres, which is an increase of 800,000 acres, would be for storage
£2,517,800, for distribution £3,600,000, making a total of £6,117,800.
For reasons explained at the beginning of this Report, no attempt is made here
to apportion either the water or the expenditure between the three States.
24. CONCLUSIONS.
Briefly stated, our conclusions are as follows ;
1. That what is most needed to permit of further irrigation development
by any of the three interested States is regulation by storage.
2. That the flow from year to year and period to period is so erratic that no
scheme for securing complete control of all water is feasible.
3. That for the purpose of regulation, in addition to the Burrinjuck
Storage now being constructed by New South Wales, ajid to the
further storages proposed to be constructed by Victoria on the
Goulburn, the works that would be of greatest advantage are —
a storage of about 1,000,000 acre feet capacity on the Upper Murray,
and the conversion of Lake Victoria into a storage basin.


4. That, as development proceeds, further storages may be constructed on
the other tributaries ; but these will generally involve a much higher
cost per unit of volume regulated than works for storage on the
Upper Murray, Goulburn, and Lake Victoria.
5. That the period during which navigation is possible on an unlocked
river has been shortened by the existing diversions to some extent,
and will be further seriously shortened as indicated on Diagrams
A, G, H, and I, and in table, Part 20, as and when the further
diversions for irrigation made possible by the Cumberoona, Goulburn,
Burrinjuck, and Lake Victoria storages come into operation.
6. That the effect of the diversions for irrigation rendered possible by the
suggested storages, in reducing the period of navigability, will be
progressive, and when such diversions are made to the fall extent
indicated, navigation will be greatly restricted and practically
prevented unless locking be resorted to.
7. That the construction of movable weirs, and locks for navigation in the
Murray, from Wentworth to Echuca, in the Darling, from Went-
worth to Bourke or Walgett, and in the Murrumbidgee, from the
Murray Junction to Hay, could be carried out without affecting
the volume of water .capable of being used for other purposes, and is,
therefore, solely a question of cost and benefit to be derived from the
expenditure necessary, and of the interests in navigation already
established, and that may be established as population and develop-
ment increase.
The terms suggested by Mr. de Burgh and Mr. Dethridge as the basis of an
agreement, and facts and matters which Mr. Graham Stewart submits for con-
sideration in the preparation of an agreement, are hereinafter separately stated.
Before concluding we desire to express our appreciation of the courteous response
by the various Government Departments of the States interested, to our requests for
information, and of the efficient assistance rendered by the officers of the Conference.
We have the honour to be,

25. AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE THREE STATES SUGGESTED BY MR. DE
BURGH, NEW SOUTH WALES, AND MR. DETHRIDGE, VICTORIA.
Being satisfied that the use of the River Murray and its tributaries for irrigation
is of first importance, that the interests of navigation are secondary, that the heavy
expenditure necessary for the regulation of the river flow by means of storage for the
purpose of maintaining navigation is not warranted, and that any proposal for locking
the river above Wentworth must be considered on its own merits apart from irrigation,
we suggest the following agreement for apportionment of the cost of works and of water
between the three directly interested States.
Suggested Agreement.
The States of New South Wales and Victoria to bear in equal shares the cost of
the Cumberoona and any further storages on the streams above Albury, and, in propor-
tion to proposed diversions, the cost of any joint works in the River Murray to raise the
level for purposes of diversion.
South Australia to bear the cost of all works proposed to be constructed by her
in the Lake Victoria Agreement as ratified by the State Parliaments, together with all
works within her own territory.
The flow of the River Murray at Albury, including the natural or regulated flow
of the Mitta and Kiewa Rivers and as regulated by the Cumberoona storage, to be shared
equally by New South Wales and Victoria, subject to any quantity agreed to be sent
down the river for riparian use and for supply to South Australia.
New South Wales and Victoria to each have full use of her own tributaries below
Albury, and to have the right to divert the flows thereof, or alternatively, equivalent
volumes from the Murray below their affluences, subject to the provision from such
tributaries, or her share of the flow at Albury, or both, of contributions towards the
share allotted to South Australia, and the allowance for riparian use on the main stream
from the affluence of such tributary, or from Albury to Lake Victoria.
The proportion of the contribution by New South Wales and Victoria to the share
allotted to South Australia and for riparian use in the main stream to be that which the
mean natural flow of the tributaries of each State below Albury measured at the points
of affluence with the Murray, with half the actual mean flow at Albury added in each
case, bear to each other. In calculating the mean flow of the Darling for this purpose
a deduction is to be made to the extent of any water diverted by the State of Queensland.
The minimum quantity to be allowed to pass to South Australia in each year
to be sufficient to fill Lake Victoria storage once, and in addition to maintain,
with the aid of the water returned from Lake Victoria, a regulated supply at Lake Victoria
outlet of 114,000 acre feet per month during the months August to April inclusive, and
47,000 acre feet per month for the months May to July inclusive, these being the pro-
visions for , domestic and stock supply, losses by evaporation and percolation in Lake
Victoria, like losses and lockage in the river from Lake Victoria to the river mouth
(but not including Lakes Alexandrina and Albert) and for irrigation in the form of a
regulated supply of 67,000 acre feet per month for nine months. Provided that these
allowances and the allowance to the upstream States be reduced yyro rata in such abnormal
seasons as those of 1902 and 1903.
We recommend that for the purpose of giving effect to such of the recommenda-
tions herein as involve Inter-State interests, a Board of Control be appointed.
In the foregoing Report we have indicated the volumes of water which can be
made available by the construction of certain regulation works.
Before any works are undertaken it is a matter for each State to decide whether
the benefits resulting from its share of the regulated water warrant the expenditure
involved.

26. BASIS OF AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE STATES SUGGESTED BY
MR. GRAHAM STEWART, SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
As explained in the commencement of this Report, my instructions do not require
me to make recommendations as to apportionment between the States of either the costs
of works or the volume of water. Apart from these matters, however, the Report
shows that the following facts should be given full consideration in the preparation of
any agreement between the States interested.
(а) That the extent to which irrigation can be extended, even with storage,
in the three States, is limited by the quantity of water available in
a series of low years, such as 1896 to 1899; and that the total area
capable of being irrigated, by the water rendered available by existing
storages, those under construction, and those suggested for construc-
tion, in this Report, is approximately 1,400,000 acres. Of this, an
area of about 600,000 acres, including that to be irrigated by the
Burrinjuck scheme, is provided for by the works constructed or in
course of construction ; but only part of such area has already been
brought under irrigation. This estimate of 600,000 acres is approxi-
mate only, and does not distinguish between areas devoted to inten-
sive culture and those devoted to pasture, cereals, and hay. Of the
1,400,000 acres capable, as stated above, of being irrigated, an area
of about 800,000 acres remains, when provided for, to be selected
for irrigation throughout the three States, and the expenditure
necessary to bring this additional area under irrigation is estimated
roughly at about £6,200,000.
(б) That, as* shown by table under Part 20, navigation has been, to some
extent, injured by diversions, and, unless locking be resorted to,
will be further injured by any increase of such diversions, and ulti-
mately, owing to the short duration, and the irregularity of the periods
of navigability, be destroyed by the diversion of such volumes as are
required for the irrigation of the above area —1,400,000 acres. That,
for a system of weirs and locks to maintain and improve the
navigability of the rivers above the junction of the Darling and
Murray Rivers, no draw on the supply of water available for other
purposes would be required.
(c) That the diversions made by the upper States in the periods of extreme
low flow—March to June —in such years as 1900, 1901, 1902, 1903,
1905, and 1912, have caused the natural flow of the river in South
Australia to be reduced, generally to about half its volume.
(i d ) That such reduction in volume caused the water left in the river to become
more or less saline, due to the admixture of salt water seeping from
the river banks ; that the water in the river, when so rendered saline,
is unsuitable for irrigation purposes and domestic supply ; and that,
unless some agreement be arrived at which will insure an adequate
and regular supply of fresh water in the South Australian portion
of the river—which, in general, prior to the diversions existed
throughout the whole year, and which, as diversions extend will
exist in fewer years and for shorter periods—serious results may
be anticipated in the near future.
Assuming the objects in view to be co-operation between the three riparian
States directly interested in projects for making the best use of the River Murray and
its tributaries, for the purpose of navigation and irrigation ; and, as a means to the
attainment of that end, the apportionment, on an equitable basis between the States,
of the water made available through economic storage and of the unregulated flow ;
the following interdependent suggestions are submitted for consideration as to general
lines of an agreement between the States :
I. —Storages should be constructed above Albury, on the Murray, at Lake
Victoria, and the existing storage on the Goulbum increased.
11. —With a view to the construction of a complete system of locks and weirs—
already shown to be necessary (Part 20) to counteract the effect
of the diversions for irrigation rendered possible by the storages, and


to maintain navigation throughout the year (and which therefore
should be a condition of any agreement), a report, such as that being
prepared for the Government of South Australia by the American
Locking Expert, Captain Johnston, of the Corps of Engineers, United
States Army, should be obtained in respect of that portion of the
navigable river system to which the report for such Government
does not extend, that is to say, in respect of the River Murray, from
Wentworth to Echuca, the Murrurabidgee, from its junction with
the Murray to Hay, and the Darling, from Wentworth to Walgett,
giving the estimated cost, time from commencement required for
construction, the best system to be adopted, and the sites and order of
construction.
Hl.—An agreement to be arrived at as to the provisions upon the following
points to form part of any settlement:—
(a) The volumes required, and to be provided, before locking for
the maintenance of navigability, and after locking towards
keeping the locked rivers navigable throughout the lengths
mentioned in paragraph 11, for boats of not less than 5 feet
draught, with a clearance of 1 ft. 6 in., making a total depth
of 6 ft. 6 in.
(b) The monthly minimum volumes of water to be delivered to
South Australia at the inlet to Lake Victoria (at or near
Frenchman's Creek), subject in such abnormally low years
as 1902 and 1903, to a reduction fro rata with a similar
reduction in the volumes of the other States.
(c) The share of each of the three States in the unregulated flow,
as gauged at Lake Victoria, after the diversions mentioned
under* Part 17 have taken place. This would be necessary
to determine the limits of any future diversions beyond those
referred to under such Part.
IV. —The volumes, to be delivered to South Australia of the waters of the
River Murray and its tributaries ; the allowance for riparian use
on the main stream from Albury to Lake Victoria ; and the volumes
required, until locking for maintenance of navigability, and on
locking for keeping the locked system effective for navigation, to be
made up from the flow at Albury regulated by the Upper Murray
storage, from the tributaries below Albury, or from both, or both
and other sources. Subject to the right and obligation to the delivery
of such volumes, the proportions of the contributions by New South
Wales and Victoria to be those which the mean flows of the tributaries
flowing through each State with half the mean flow at Albury added
in each case, bear to each other.
V. —The national character and advantages of works to make the Murray,
the Murrumbidgee, and Darling Rivers permanently navigable, and
the relation of the Commonwealth to navigation, may be thought to
justify a contribution by the Commonwealth Government towards
the cost of construction of such works, approximately £3,000,000,
which would probably, if not necessarily, be spread over a number of
years.
VI. —No estimate has been made of the probable returns from expenditure
in irrigation and navigation ; but it seems clear that both lines of
development can be co-ordinated and that being undertaken as
interdependent or necessarily associated works, the success of one
conduces to the success of the other.

APPENDIX No. 2.
REPORT ON INVESTIGATION OF POSSIBILITIES OF STORAGE AND REGULATION
ELSEWHERE THAN AT CftMBEROONA, BURRINJUCK, GOULBURN RIVER, AND
LAKE VICTORIA, DEALT WITH IN THE MAIN REPORT.
E. Checchi, C.E.
With a view to arriving tentatively at the capacity of storage warranted by the natural flow of
oaoh stream, and the volume of regulated flow attainable with the aid of such storage, all the monthly
moan flows were collected from the records of gaugings and steps were taken to construct for each stream
a year of hypothetical flow which might be regarded as the most probable forecast of the flow in any
future year. Thus in the case of, say, the Kiewa River to obtain a forecast of the probable mean
natural flow in any future January an average of all mean flows recorded for January in past years was
taken. A like course was followed for all the other months of the year, and the averages thus obtained
were fombined as representing a year of typical flow. Having obtained the typical flow, the next step
was to ascertain the capacity of storage required to equalize it throughout the year. Neglecting for the
present any question of losses by evaporation and percolation this capacity is simply the amount by which
the flow in the wet months exceeds the average monthly flow for the whole year.
The following table shows the capacity of storage thus found to be warrantable, and the volume
of regulated flow of the hypothetical year for each of the principal streams of the Murray system.
The capacities thus obtained are not necessarily the ones to be adopted, because they make no
provision for carrying forward the surplus of years of high rainfall to those of deficient rainfall. It may bo
mentioned that some authorities, in evidence before the Royal Commissions on the Murray, have expressed
opinions adverse to the feasibility of carrying volumes forward from year to year on any large scale. Tt is
also the fact that the conditions assumed as corresponding to the typical year are much better than those
of the low years, behaviour during which must be the test applied to any proposed scheme.
The ratio between storage and volume of regulated flows shown in the table may be taken as an index
of the amount of storage required in proportion to the stream flow. For example, while during years of
typical flow a storage to hold barely a month’s supply appears sufficient for the Darling River, a much larger
storage comparatively would be required for the Campaspe River. Evidently the great length of the
Darling River, its flat grade, and the monsoonal summer rains arc efficient factors working in favour of a
natural regulation of the flow of this stream.
Storage Sites Examined.
Mitta River. —The Report of the Victorian Royal Commission of 1910 refers to a selected site
near Mooroonjong, but neither here, nor at any other point on the Mitta River below the junction of
the Snowy Creek, could any place be found where a storage of the kind required could be constructed at
practicable cost. A short distance above the Snowy Creek junction the valley of the Mitta becomes narrow,
silurian rock shows freely in the river bed and is found under the banks at depths below the surface ranging
from 4 feet on the right to 30 feet on the left side. It has been computed from survey that a dam at this
site with height to top water level of 145 feet would store 124,000 acre feet. Above the site the valley
widens into flats ; the area submerged by the dam would be 1,908 acres, of which 900 acres are alienated.
A minor dam about 40 feet high would be required at a saddle on the right flank. The capacity of the
storage could be increased to 175,000 acre feet by raising the height of both dams by about 24 feet.
Some 15 miles above the Snowy Creek Junction, near Dartmouth, the river is rock bound, and offers
a suitable foundation for a high masonry dam. The capacity of storage here would be about 50,000 aero
feet. As the cost per unit would certainly be higher than at the Junction site, no survey was made.
Snowy Creek. —For some 6 miles above the junction with the Mitta River the valley of the Snowy
Creek is narrow, but at a place known as Granite Flat it opens out into table land. Near the upper end
•of the gorge the creek, which is rock bound, divides into two branches. Near the fork two sites for dams
are available, one below, the other above the junction. Both sites and the basin which would be common
to both have been surveyed. It is computed that a depth of water of 215 feet at the lower site would
impound 125,000 acre feet of water, and a depth of 201 feet at the upper site would impound 104,000 acre
foot. The smaller storage is the more favorable because the gorge is narrower. The catchment area would
bo smaller, but still sufficient for the purpose. The areas of land that would be submerge dby these
storages are 1,500 and 1,700 acres respectively, of which 216 acres are alienated.

Kiewa River. —The valley below the point where Junction Creek joins the main river, at the foot of
Mount Towanga, offers no advantages for the construction of a reservoir. A few miles above this junction,
the main valley ends and the stream divides into three branches, but none of these is suitable for storage
because of the narrowness of the valley. Two possible sites exist near Junction Creek, one below, the other
above, separated by less than 2 miles. Surveys of both sites have been made.
A geological feature of interest appears for miles on both flanks of this valley in the shape of land-
slips. Portions of the sides of the valley have mofod some 20 or 30 feet, leaving here and there a bare
earthy face, steep and smooth. These faults occurring as they do below full-supply level call for remark.
At the lower of the two sites there is granite rock at a moderate depth, the deepest being 49 feet.
Similar rock shows in the bed of the river. The upper site is somewhat narrower, but no boring has been
carried out there. The choice of suitable sites on this river is small, being practically limited to the two
mentioned.
It is computed from survey that a depth of water of 114 feet at the lower site would give 78,000
acre feet of storage, while it is estimated that at a depth of 134 feet 124,000 acre feet would be impounded.
The area of land that would be submerged by the storage is 2,900 acres, all alienated.
Ovens River System, s
This system comprises four streams —the Ovens, King, Buffalo, and Buckland. The gaugings
available give the aggregate flow of these four rivers. These gaugings have been combined with the respec-
tive drainage areas and rainialls on the catchments of the individual streams and the contribution of each
estimated and applied to divide the total storage and output given in previous table. The result in similar
units is shown hereunder ;
The Ovens. —The main valley of this river to a point above the junction with the Buckland River is
miles wide, and the alluvial deposits hundreds of feet thick.' Above the Buckland junction the hill
sides approach the stream, and a survey of a storage between Porepunkah and Bright has been made. The
bed and banks of the river are rocky, and bare rocks are visible near the centre of the storage. One of a
number of bores and a shaft put down on the dam site, however, failed to reach bed-rock at 80 and 28 feet
respectively; others show that the bed-rock is within reach. The depth of water that could be stored
here would not exceed 82 feet; this would give 27,000 acre feet. A greater depth than 82 feet would,
in flood time, submerge portion of the township of Bright. The land that would be submerged is 880 acres,
300 acres of which is alienated. The construction of a storage at this site would be surrounded with diffi-
culties, other sites were therefore surveyed. Above Harrietville, where the stream divides into two branches,
known as the East and West Branch, solid rock is in sight all round. The grade of the stream, however,
is steep, and the valleys comparatively narrow, consequently, even storages 200 feet deep would in the
East and West Branches give only 14,000 and 21,000 acre feet respectively. Surveys were carried out to
a height of 150 feet above the bed of the streams, and the contents computed are 7,500 and 11,000 acre
feet for the East and West Branch respectively at that level; the land that would be submerged is Crown
land. No other favorable sites for storages on the Ovens are available, and the aggregate of those mentioned
falls short of the minimum capacity of storage assigned to this stream in the table above.
The BucJdand. —Only one site, near Brookside, has been surveyed; other possible sites exist higher
up stream at Rocky Point, at the junction of Murray Creek, and elsewhere.
At Brookside the result of the borings show that Silurian rock, which is bare in the bed and banks
of the stream, is elsewhere to be found within a few feet of the surface. Seeing that the flats here have been
rendered almost valueless by dredging, and bearing in mind that the aggregate storage to be found on the
Ovens proper is less than that commanded by the stream, this survey was carried out to a height of 200
feet above the river bed. The contents of a storage of that depth would be 170,000 acre feet, or nearly
three times as much as the minimum storage assigned to the stream. The maximum depth of water
corresponding to a storage of 66,000 acre feet, the assigned value, would be 140 feet. The area submerged
by this storage would be 1,300 acres, about 1,000 acres of which is alienated, and by the larger one,
2,246 acres. No instrumental surveys were made of other sites, this being considered the best available.
The Buffalo* River stretch of river between the junction with the Ovens, near Myrtleford,
and the junction with Long Corner Creek was surveyed years ago by the Victorian Water Supply Depart-
ment, and five sites for storages were suggested, the largest being 56,000 acre feet. With the assistance
of these surveys the site of a storage larger than any suggested has been selected, and the original survey
extended to a higher level at a place known as the “ Rocks.” The bed and left bank of the river are rocky*
and borings on the right bank show that silurian rock can be reached at moderate depths, the deepest bore
being 25 feet. The area of land submerged by this storage would be 2,650 acres, all alienated. It is
computed from the survey that a maximum depth of 130 feet of water would secure a storage of 135,000
acre feet capacity. Two miles below and 20 miles above this site other suitable sites for dams exist, but
no survey has been made of them.

King River. —From Wangaratta to Whitfield the valley of this river is too wide for the construction
of reservoirs. Some 5 miles above Whitfield, at a place known as Glenmore, a survey for a storage has been
made. It is computed that a dam holding up a depth of water of 144 feet would store 85,000 acre feet.
On the left bank of the river the Silurian rock lies within 27 feet of the surface. In the river bed
and on the right bank the bed rock is visible. It is believed that this is the only site on the King River
worth considering. The area of land that would be submerged would be 2,000 acres, all alienated.
Sketches of tranverse sections of the valleys at the sites described are given.
Moira Lakes. —Captain Westergaard, in giving evidence before the Royal Commission, 1910,
stated ; —“ If the Moira Lakes were locked enough water could be stored to provide a navigable river for
two months longer.” From surveys, it is computed that a maximum depth of 12 feet in the Moira Lakes,
New South Wales, would give 100,000 acre feet of storage, and in Victoria a similar depth would give 150,000
acre feet of storage. The Yalca portions of the Victorian Lakes are shallow and too small for cheap
storage. The areas submerged are wholly Crown lands. The cost per acre foot of capacity of these lake
storages would be much lower than that of any of the reservoirs formed by high dams, but they would have
the disadvantages of comparatively high loss by evaporation, and of not commanding some of the best
irrigable lands in New South Wales and Victoria, for which water is likely to be required at an early stage
in any comprehensive scheme of development.
General.
No other proposal for storage has been investigated for this Conference, but a summary of previous
investigations..with reference to the Darling, Swampy Plains, Tumut, Broken, Campaspe, and Loddon
Rivers, has been embodied in the following statement for reference.
..None of these storages could be recommended in preference to those at Cumberqona, Goulburn
River, and Lake Victoria, which, with the partly completed Burrinjuck Reservoir, have been selected by
the Conference for the scheme of practicable regulation.
Generally the only need for them would be a local demand for water for irrigation. Such demand
could not be met from any other source of supply ; each valley would have to depend on its own river for
the water; and in almost every case the provision of the storage that would be indispensable for irrigation
would involve heavy cost entailing comparatively high charges. *_
// During the progress of the Conference, a suggestion was received from Mr. J. S. Gregory, 8.C.E.,/
of Swan Hill, Victoria, to the effect that the flow of the River Murray might be augmented by bringing
water from the Snowy River by means of a tunnel through the intervening mountain range to the head
waters of the River Murray. Three lines were suggested for survey for the tunnel, their lengths being
16 miles, 21 miles, and 30 miles respectively.
According to gaugings of the Snowy River at Jindabyne, furnished by the State of New South Wales
the maximum, mean and minimum flows during the last ten years have been 15,360, 1,180, and 88 cubic feet
per second respectively. The discharge generally appears to be about equal to 83 per cent, of that of the
Mitta, or 43 per cent, of that of the Upper Murray. The smallness of the minimum flow of the
Snowy River indicates that in very dry years any proportion of the natural flow that could be spared would
be too small to be of much value, and there is no prospect of any scheme involving storage on the Snowy
River in addition to tunnelling being financially practicable. / /

A copy of tbl* plan la forwarded with the Report.


(d) Proposed Storages —
Murray River.—The State of Victoria has no proposals for storages on the Murray River apart
from those suggested in the Report of the Inter-State Royal Commission of 1902, and the
Victorian Royal Commission on Murray Waters of 1910 for construction on the Upper
Murray at the joint expense of the interested States. It does, however, desire to obtain
concurrence in the construction of a movable dam at Torrumbarry mainly for the purpose
of substituting gravitation supply for the pumping now necessary for the Cohuna and
Koondrook districts. A design for this structure accompanies this letter.
Mitta, Kiewa, and Ovens Rivers.—As yet there are no definite proposals-for the construction
of storages on these streams; but it is known that sites exist for such works, and it is
expected that construction will be proceeded with as irrigation development creates need
for more water than the natural flow furnishes.
Goulburn River.—The total capacity of existing storages is 218,000 acre feet. Proposals for
increasing the extent of storage by about 500,000 acre feet are under consideration. The
result of investigations as to sites available and cost of works are shown on the attached
statement.
Campaspe and Loddon Rivers.—The results of investigations on these tributaries show that at
Eppalock, on the' Campaspe, a reservoir of 107,000 acre feet capacity could be constructed
at an estimated cost of £123,000; and that on the Loddon, in addition to the existing
storage at Laanecoorie, which has a capacity of 14,000 acre feet, a storage of 30,000 acre
feet could be constructed at Baringhup at an estimated cost of £175,000. At present
these possibilities are only receiving general consideration.
South Australia,
Commissioner of Public Works Office,
Adelaide, 12th August, 1912.
Sir,
In reply to your letter of the 21st February last asking for information as follows :
(а) Plans showing areas and situation of all land ’ proposed to be irrigated from the Rivet
Murray and its tributaries;
(б) A statement of classification of the land of such areas with special regard to suitability for
irrigation;
(c) The quantities of water required for such areas, the period of the year during which the water
would be used, and method of application—whether by pumping or gravitation;
{d) Particulars of all storage works proposed to be constructed on the Murray and its tributaries;
I have the honour to inform you —
(o) Request for plans showing areas and situation of all land proposed to be irrigated from the
Murray River and its tributaries.
*The plan marked “A” forwarded to you with this letter shows, coloured pink, an area of 2,500,000
acres of land on and adjacent to the River Murray, in South Australia, within which it is estimated that
there is fully a million acres of land suitable for cultivation under irrigation with water from the River
Murray. This is the information given to the Royal Commission of 1902, and I am to say that it is impossible,
with any degree of accuracy, to define at present the specific areas of this land which will be irrigated from
the River Murray, All that can be said is that the policy of the State is to steadily extend from’ year to
year the irrigated area so that in time to command as large an area as possible.
*A second plan, marked “ B,” is also forwarded, showing, coloured dark-green, the swamp lands
reclaimed or in course of reclamation; margined red, the present irrigable areas with works constructed
or in course of construction. The acreage of irrigable and reclaimed areas is shown in red figures. The
plan also shows, coloured light-green, the lands liable to inundation and capable of being reclaimed—area,
about 288,000 acres; and shows coloured pink the lands above flood level to about 130 feet above low-water
level which are suitable for irrigation, the area being about 685,000 acres." The lands shown on this plan
are those which it is contemplated to first bring under cultivation by irrigation with water from the River
Murray.
(6) A statement of classification of the land of such areas with special regard to suitability
for irrigation.
For the reasons given in paragraph (a) it is impossible to give the information asked for, because no
such classification has been made.
(c) The quantities of water required for such areas, the period of the year during which the
water would be used, and method of application—whether by pumping or gravitation.
Reply. —From 2 to 3 acre feet during the irrigation season, with a reasonable margin for loss and other
contingencies, according to the nature of the soil and the irrigated crop.
Quite apart from the area to be commanded for irrigation there will be a considerable portion of the
area coloured red, and lands beyond it which will be supplied with water from the River Murray for domestic
purposes and for supply of stock. One such project has already been approved for the Hundred of Book-
purnong, Gordon, and Paringa, and other such schemes are being formulated for the Hundreds of Murtho,
Pyap, Moorook, Holder, and Waikerie. ■
As regards the question of the period of the year during which the water would be used. the reply
is that for a considerable portion the supply would be requited from January to December, 'and for the
remainder the water would be more particularly required from the month of August to the month of March
inclusive.
* A copy of this plan la lorvrarded with the Report


As to the method of application of the water it is impossible to say the proportion which will be by
gravitation and the proportion by pumping.
(d) Particulars of all storage works proposed to be constructed on the Murray and its tributaries.
The only storages definitely decided upon are Lake Bonney, in South Australia, 3,500 million cubic
feet; and Lake Victoria, in Now South Wales, about 22,400 million cubic feet. A site has been reported
on for a storage at Parcoola, near Overland Corner, but nothing definite decided on ; and further examination
of the Upper Valley of the Murray in South Australia is now being made to see if there are any very suitable
sites for storages.
I have the honour to be,
Sir,
Your obedient Servant,
(Sgd.) JAMES W. JONES,
Secretary.

APPENDIX No. 4.
POLLUTION.
A special question was referred by the State Premiers to the Conference respecting pollution of the
river and its tributaries by the towns situated on them. The following information has been collected for
the purpose of showing the extent of such pollution. It will be observed that out of a total of 62 towns,
with population of 67,906, on the catchments of the main stream and tributaries, the pan system obtains
m 37, with population of 52,715. As compared with the conditions of the more thickly populated parts
of Europe and America, where discharge into rivers, after more or less dilution or purification, is the
usual method of disposal of actual sewage from cities and towns, the present degree of pollution of the
waters of the Murray does not appear serious.
Nevertheless it is very desirable that all such pollution be as far as possible prevented. It cannot
be too strongly urged that the health authorities of the larger towns endeavour to keep pace with the rapid
progress of recent years in methods of purifying and dealing with drainage and sewage disposal.
The matter is one in which voluntary effort on the part of the local authorities would be preferable
to compulsion, but there appear to be extensive powers vested in the central authorities of the States to act
in the prevention of pollution when necessary.
A Circular Letter in the following terms was despatched to 21 places in Victoria, 28 in New South
Wales, 12 in South Australia; 20 replies in Victoria, 23 in New South Wales, and 11 in South Australia
were received. '
(1) What is the population of the Town of
(2) What is the present method of disposing of—
(а) Night-soil ?
(б) House and street drainage ?
(3) Are any new methods of disposing of night-soil or house drainage under consideration ?
If so, please furnish brief description of them, and state probable date of carrying them
into effect.
(4) Ate there any causes,of pollution of water in the Murray Rivet or tributaries within the
boundaries of your municipality by tanneries, wool-washing establishments, saw-millsl
placing sawdust in rivers, slaughter-yards, gold dredging, or other industrial operations
of any kind whatsoever ? If so, please furnish particulars of nature, extent, and localtiy
of such operations.
