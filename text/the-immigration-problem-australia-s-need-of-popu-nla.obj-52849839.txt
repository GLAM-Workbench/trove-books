PREFACE.
Melbourne, 6th September, 1920.
This pamphlet is issued under the auspices of the Australian
Speakers’ Association. The Association has been in existence tor
several years, and comprises a body of men who meet regularly
to study and discuss political, economic, and social questions.
Subjects of general importance are, dealt with by small sub-
committees, who draft reports and submit them to the full body
of members for discussion and, subject to alterations and addi-
tions, for final endorsement. The question of Immigration was
first dealt with by the Association in 1913, when a carefully com-
piled report was adopted. The post-War conditions so emphasised
the outstanding importance of this subject to Australia, that this
report was thoroughly revised in the light of later developments,
and the present pamphlet represents that revision. It is issued
in the sincere hope that it may be of use to those who are called
on to conceive and give effect to an Australian immigration policy
worthy of the potentialities of our great but sparsely populated
continent.

The Immigration Problem
Prior to the Great War the attraction of immigrants to
Australia had been earnestly undertaken by most of the State
Governments, but the outbreak of war caused a suspension, for
the time being, of this enterprise. Now that the war is happily
over, there are not wanting signs of a large exodus from Great
Britain and other European countries to newer lands. In Great
Britain especially, there are thousands of men who left city
occupations to fight in the trenches. The out-door-life on the
battlefield has given them a taste for out-door-life on the land.
They are ready to embrace the work of a primary producer if only
the opportunity is afforded them.
For many years before the war, there was a steady stream of
immigration from Great Britain and the Continent to countries
beyond Europe. It is worth while ascertaining where this
stream went, and the influences which have shaped its direction
and intensity.
The increase in population in Great Britain and Europe during
the fifty years preceding the Great War, through causes which it
is here unnecessary to examine, provided a large surplus popula-
tion which could be drawn on by new countries, offering attractions
for immigrants. The gold discoveries in California in 1849 and
in Australia two years afterwards, gave a great impulse in the
early fifties to immigration from Great Britain to the United States
and to Australia. Since that period the rapid expansion of the
means of transport and communication has opened the world to
Europe. New York and Canadian ports, for instance, can now
be reached in shorter time and at less cost from London than
it was possible to reach outlying portions of Great Britain sixty
years ago. Railways, the modern liner, cables and wireless tele-
graphy have brought all countries, even far-distant Australia,
closer together than they were fifty years ago. The industrial
expansion of the United States has enabled it to make room for
and to assimilate great numbers of the surplus population of
Europe,


EUROPEAN EMIGRATION.
For several decades the main stream of emigrants, not only
from Great Britain, but from Western Europe, went to the United
States. The more immigrants it received, the more rapidly its
industrial and commercial welfare improved. For the ten years
ending 1830 the average number of immigrants received by the
United States was only 12.464 per annum. For the decade ending
1840, it rose to 52.872 per annum. The ten year period ending 1850
paw the large yearly increase of 160,000. But even this large
increase is insignificant when compared with the increases in
the later decades. By 1880 the number of immigrants received
had risen to 281,000 per annum. Thus far, most of the immigrants
were drawn from Great Britain, and chiefly from Ireland. The
potato famine in the latter country in 1846 gave rise to emigration
on such a large scale that its population fell from 8,175,000 in;
1841, to 5,174,886 in 1881. It is still low'er to-day.
After 1883 a new factor in the extent and character of the
stream of immigrants to the United States became apparent. The
investigations of the Immigration Commission appointed by Con-
gress in 1908 show that prior to 1883, 95 per cent, of the immigrants
were drawn from Great Britain, Belgium, Denmark, Prance,
Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland.
Since 1883 other European countries have contributed to the
immigration movement, and to such an extent that between that
period and 1907, no less than 81 per cent, of the total number
of European immigrants came from Austria-1 lungary, Bulgaria,
Greece, Italy, Montenegro, Poland, Portugal, Roumania, Russia,
Servia, Spain, Syria, and Turkey, and only 19 per cent, from
Great Britain and the Western European countries which, prior
to 1883, provided all but 5 per cent, of the immigrants received.
The total number of immigrants for each decade since 1880 did
not fall off. It enormously increased. It was no longer composed
of the highly intelligent Western European nations, but of the
less intelligent and, for the most part, illiterate peoples of Eastern
Europe. Thus the total number of immigrants rose from 281,000
per annum in the decade ending 1880 to the enormous number
of 879,000 per annum for the ten years ending 1910.
Taking the ten year period 1902-11 inclusive, no less than
9,371,830 people emigrated from Europe to coutries beyond it —an
average of nearly one million per annum. Great Britain con-
tributed 1,670,932 to the total for the ten year period—a yearly
average of 167,000 persons, which, by the way, is less than one-
sixth of the total. Italy headed the list with 3,596,130 —a yearly
average of 359,000,
Where did this host of over 9,000,000 people—nearly double
the population of the Commonwealth —find an abiding place?
The following diagram shows the comparative yearly con-
tributions of the chief countries of Europe to the total for a five-
year period ending June, 1912, during which the annual out-going
of nearly a million emigrants -was maintained. Roughly speaking.


Italy provided one-third of the total emigrants during this period,
Austria-Hungary one-fourth. Great Britain a little over one-fifth,
and all other European countries about one-seventh.
AVERAGE YEARLY EMIGRATION
FROM
PRINCIPAL EURPOPERAN COUNTRIES
for 5 yeear eding june 1912
The destination of this annual migratory host is shown in
the following diagram, a glance at which indicates the enormous
proportion the United States received —63 per cent, of the total, or
573,793 per annum. Canada came next with 17 per cent., or 156,521
per annum. It may be noted that the total number of immigrants
Canada received annually in this period was, however, nearly
double this number, the balance being drawn from the United
States. South America (Brazil and Argentina) received 12 per


cent., or 105.012 per annum, and Australia and Xew Zealand 5.1
per cent, or 46.488 per annum. In the last two years of the
period Australia's proportion was higher, and in the first three
years lower, than the average.
It is interesting to note that during the last twelve years
of the period before the war, a great change took place in
respect to the destinations of British emigrants. From 1891
to 1900, more than 72 per cent, went to foreign countries
and only 28 per cent, to the outer Empire. When, however,
Canada, and subsequently Australia, entered on an active
campaign to attract immigrants, these figures were reversed.
In 1912 no less than 82 per cent, of the people leaving
Great Britain went to countries under the British flag, and
only 18 per cent, to foreign countries.

SLOW INCREASE OF POPULATION IN THE
COMMONWEALTH.
Notwithstanding the increased immigration to Australia during
the years immediately preceding the War, the slow increase in
the population was pointed out by Mr. G. H. Knibbs in the follow-
ing paragraph in the “Commonwealth Year Book” for 1911,
page, 134:
“The annual rate of increase in the Commonwealth popula-
tion for the quinquennium 1901-6 was practically identical
with the annual rate for Germany, the figures being respec-
tively 1.49 per cent, and 1.47 per cent. In view of the sparsity
of the population of Australia, and the recency of its settle-
ment, this rate of increase, equal only to that of such a
densely populated country as Germany, cannot be regarded
as satisfactory. When contrasted with the growth of popula-
tion in the United States, the comparison is even less favour-
able, since the annual rate of increase of that country for
the period 1901-6 was 1.62 per cent. Further, if the increase
in the population of the Commonwealth be compared with
that of the United States under comparable conditions as to
density of population, it will be seen that whilst during the
seventy years 1790-1860 the population of the United States
increased at a rate of slightly more than 3 per cent, per annum,
that of the Commonwealth, during the ten years 1900-1909,
increased at a little more than half that rate. The full
significance of the difference between these two rates of
increase will be seen on comparing the figures shown in
line (a) below with those appearing on line (b). The former
represent the population of the Commonwealth in the years
specified, on the assumption that the rate of increase ex-
perienced in the Commonwealth during the ten years 1900-1909,
viz., 1.64 per cent., remains permanently in force, while the
latter show what it would be in the same years if the rate
of increase experienced in the United States during the
seventy years 1790-1860 were in force.”
SIGNIFICANCE OF PRESENT RATE OF GROWTH OF
COMMONWEALTH POPULATION.
fal On basis of Commonwealth rate of increase 1900-1909.
(b) On basis of U.B.A. rates of increase 1790-1860.
These are not predictions as to the probable future
population in the Commonwealth, but computations show-
ing what the population will be if rate of increase for the
period specified is maintained, and what it would be if
the increase were as rapid as in the United States at a
comparable period.”


It is not reassuring to know that Australia, with her
present slow rate of increase in population, will take
thirty years to equal just about the present population
of Canada (8,593,000).
AN ACTIVE IMMIGRATION POLICY NOT INIMICAL
TO WORKERS.
Many workers honestly believe that an active immigration
policy is injurious to wage earners Every workman brought
here, they argue, is a prospective competitor for available jobs.
The more workers, the less work, they say, there will be for each.
Consequently, they contend that lower wages and greater unem-
ployment must be the result if immigration is encouraged. If
this were true, then the countries into which immigrants have
been pouring in tens of thousands annually for years must be
the countries where wages are low, unemployment general and
the condition of wage earners unsatisfactory. But the contrary
of this is the case. Take for instance, the present condition of
the United States and Canada. Wages were never higher nor
employment greater than they are to-day in the United States,
which for the five years ending 1912, received 63 per cent, of
all European emigrants —an annual increase nearly equal to the
present population of Greater Melbourne —and which for upwards
of a generation has gained more of the annual emigration from
Europe than all other countries together.
As for Canada, it is remarkable how enterprise has expanded,
production increased, wages risen, and employment become
more diversified and stable, since she embarked on a vigorous and
sustained policy of attracting immigrants. This policy has now
been in operation fifteen years. In that period her population rose
from 5,37i»000 to 8,593,000 —an increase of 60 per cent. The
value of production rose from £96,000,000 in 1901 to
£200,000,000 in 1912. The area under crop doubled. In 1917
her wheat crop was 254 million bushels —more than double that
of Australia.
In new countries, having such boundless possibilities of ex-
pansion as Canada and Australia, work makes work. The more
workers there are employed in re-productive work, the greater
the wages fund out of which all wage earners are paid. and. it
may be said also, the more stable is the remuneration of capital.
If all Australian enterprise, and all chance of expanding this
enterprise, were confined to the cities of Australia, there would
be some grounds for the apprehensions of workers that an
active immigration policy would be injurious to wage earners.
But there is a Continent to develop, and it is ridiculous to hope
that a population of only 5,000,000 —having more than a third of
this number grouped in six capital cities —can fully develop it.
The United States, with an area only a few hundred square miles
greater than Australia, has a population of over 100 million. Her
wage earners receive as high wages, and enjoy as high standard
of living, as any people in the world.


Every worker added to the population increases the home
demand for food and clothing, shelter and transport, and for
the hundred and one other wants of a civilised community,
and so adds to the demand for employment.
THE VALUE OF AN ADULT IMMIGRANT.
Every adult immigrant added to the population, according to
the generally accepted estimate of political economists, saves the
community £2O0 —the cost of maintenance from birth to earning
age. In addition to this must be added the value of cash and
effects immigrants bring with them to their adopted country. In
an official publication of the Canadian Immigration Department
an estimate of the cash and settlers’ effects brought to Canada
by immigrants in the ten-year period ending 1911 averaged £75
per head. In the United States, where a large proportion of the
immigrants for some years past have been drawn from poor,
illiterate populations of Southern and Eastern Europe, the esti-
mate of cash brought in by immigrants is much lower. An official
investigation showed that the British immigrants entering the
United States in 1899, and again in 1900, averaged £6 per head.
The higher estimate of the cash brought by Canadian immigrants
is doubtless accounted for by the fact that a large proportion of
the immigrants were British and United States farmers entering
Canada to settle on the land. Whether, however, the cash in
pocket, which immigrants bring with them, be high or low, they
do not, as a rule, eater the land of their adoption entirely destitute.
The intrinsic value of immigrants, when large numbers are
annually pouring into a country, quite apart from their potential
value as effective producers, is considerable.
Greatest of all the gains, of course, is the service of the
newcomers in developing production directly by their own
labor, and indirectly in stimulating it by the demand of
their daily needs. The result of adding 100,000, 200,000,
or 400,000 immigrants per annum to the Nation’s wage-
earners would not be to diminish, but to increase largely
the wages fund of Australia. In other words, each worker
would not only earn the cost of his maintenance, but a
surplus besides. This surplus, whether small or great,
remains to enrich the community.
REASONS WHY AUSTRALIA SHOULD FILL UP HER
EMPTY SPACES.
There are urgent reasons why the problem of filling up the
empty spaces of Australia transcends in importance all other
questions in practical politics, whether State or Federal. It was
Canada’s nearness to her powerful neighbor which helped to rouse
her from the lethargic condition into w T hioh, like Australia, she
had fallen in respect to her responsibility in holding an empty
territory, without making strenuous endeavors to fill it. But
Canada’s nearness to the peace-loving, English-speaking United
States contains no menace comparable to Australia’s nearness
to the teeming millions of Asia, awakening at last to the touch
of Western civilisation. How far or fast this awakening of the


East to the influence of the West will lead Asiatic nations like
China and Japan no one can predict, but it is obvious that they
are rapidly assuming the position of world powers capable of
challenging other world powers on questions of international law.
That is a new world-force which cannot he disregarded. All
history shows that it is a doctrine of international law, sooner
or later enforced by nations powerful enough to do so, that a
country must be effectively occupied to be exclusively held by
its possessors. China and Japan would not be independent
nations to-day, if they occupied countries as fertile as Australia,
with only 1.72 persons, instead of 82 and 300 persons to the square
mile, respectively.
The Commonwealth has decreed that Australia shall be
reserved for the white race. The obligation, therefore, is
still more insistent that while there is time, we shall set
about populating it with white people. Our present
leisurely methods will not accomplish much. The increase,
from birth rate and immigration combined, may enable the
present population to be doubled in 36 years. That is to
say, in 1956 the density of Australian population may be
3.44 persons to the square mile—not a very promising
outlook.
THE BURDEN OF TAXATION AND NATIONAL
INDEBTEDNESS.
There are immediate and pressing reasons, apart from the
national peril of an empty continent, why Australia should set
about getting immigrants in real earnest. The Commonwealth
rightly shouldered its share of Empire defence. This has in-
volved extra taxation and indebtedness which is already very
heavy. For instance, the total State indebtedness in 1919 was
£396,356,149, or £75 Is. 6d. per head. The Commonwealth indebted-
ness in the same year was £350,021,360, or £7O per head. The
combined debt of States and Commonwealth was £746,377,509, or
£145 Is. 6d. per head. The significance of these figures is apparent
when it is realised that this combined debt of States and Common-
wealth is greater than the national debt of Great Britain was
before the War (£716,000,000 in 1913). It must, of course, be
remembered that portion of the State debts is interest earning,
hut notwithstanding this the indebtedness of the Australian
people is very heavy. And so with taxation. The total taxation
levied by the State Governments in 1919 was £11,904,332, or
£2 7s. 4d. per head, and by Commonwealth Government £32,873,003.
or £6 10s. Bd. per head. The combined taxation, Federal and
State, amounted to £44,777,335, or £8 ISs. per head. The way
to reduce this burden of debt and taxation per head is to obtain
more people to help to bear it. Nearly all our State and Federal
services would serve a larger population without appreciably
increasing the cost per head. Certainly defence expenditure
would involve no more to protect 10,000,000 than it does to protect
5,000,000. And so with other Governmental services.


Unless, therefore, more people are induced to come to
Australia, the community will find that the obligations
which it courageously undertook in respect to Empire
defence will, in addition to its other burdens of taxation,
tell very heavily indeed on its enterprise. More people
are wanted, not only to share the burden of cost, but
to increase the number of her defenders and her available
resources should a great emergency ever again call Australia
to arms.
A LARGER HOME MARKET FOR MANUFACTURES.
Just as it is necessary to increase our population in order
to share the burden of taxation, so it is also necessary to the
healthy progressive life of a country committed to a policy of
protection as Australia is, to stimulate and widen the markets
for goods of home manufacture. The opportunities of the manu-
facturer in Australia are expanding. Owing to the increase in
wages overseas, as a result of the World War, Australia is able
to compete with foreign countries in many lines of manufactured
goods. But the manufacturing industry is only in its infancy
in Australia, and until great reserves of capital are built up, the
home market must be, and indeed always is, the best for local
manufactures. With a firm local demand it is comparatively easy
for promoters to establish new industries, and the only healthy
way to keep the home demand firm, and constantly increasing,
is to increase the population. This will provide the ideal con-
ditions of industry—that of guaranteeing the local factories against
pudden collapse, consequent on foreign crises, while the people
receive the best that their country produces, both in articles
•of produce and manufacture. The war has opened to Australia
the markets of Europe for many manufactured articles. If the
population were increased, it would help both producers and
manufacturers to dispose of their best locally, our own market
receiving priority and the surplus only going abroad.
The modern factory system, with its improved machinery and
specialised services, can rapidly increase its output, and is, as a
matter of fact, doing so in Australia more rapidly than enterprises
engaged in primary production. For instance, the estimated value
of production from the land industries and mining rose from
£134,485,000 in 1909 to £213,802,000 in 1917, an increase of 58 per
cent., while the output by processes of manufacture rose from
£39,713,000 in 1909 to £69,807,000 in 1917, an increase of 76 per
cent.
It needs no prophet to foretell that in a veiy few years the
city population of Australia will be race to face with the problem
of having overtaken the normal local demand for very many
lines of manufactured goods (some of which it undoubtedly would
not pay to export), unless side by side with the annually in-
creasing output more people are brought here to use them. The


opening of the markets of the Commonwealth on free and equal
terms to Australian manufacturers gave a great impetus to their
industry. Many enterprises which had no export demand were
languishing because they were shut out from competing in the
markets of neighboring States by the border duties, and had over-
taken the home requirements in their respective States. They
revived, and have since grown vigorously, under the influence of
the wider markets of the Commonwealth. If instead of rapidly
nearing a time when Australia's home consumption, in many
lines of goods, must be overtaken, the same number of
immigrants were pouring into Australia as Canada received
in 1913=13 (400,000), the present population of the Com-
monwealth would be doubled in less than 12 years, and
every factory in Australia could continue “full steam
ahead” for many years to come in meeting the local
demand and providing a large and ever growing surplus for
export, thus adding to the wealth of the community.
It is not necessary here to detail the list of manufactures
which Australia can produce for local and foreign markets, but
it appears that in the near future, as far as preserved foods,
woollen and leather manufactured goods are concerned, the
Commonwealth may not only be the main source of the raw
products, but also one of the chief countries of their manufacture.
The guarantee to Australia of this valuable national asset lies in
Increasing the population in due proportion to the vast poten-
tialities which the future holds.
ROOM FOR IMMIGRANTS IN THE LAND INDUSTRIES.
The land industries of Australia afford a splendid opportunity
for successful immigration enterprise. Here lies a field for
constructive statesmanship which is inspiring. It is time public
opinion fully realised that in order to hold this Continent for the
white race, we must effectively occupy it; that in order to ensure
the continued prosperity of the half-dozen populous cities on
the seaboard, we must largely increase the production of the
Soil. When these facts are fully realised, it will be found that
the immigration problem demands the earnest co-operation of
the best statesmen of all parties in the Federal and State Par-
liaments.
it is worth while giving attention to the present position of
production from the land, and the opportunities afforded by its
industries for indefinite expansion.


The following diagram illustrates the sources of the national
income from primary production:
COMMONWEALTH PRODUCTION. 1917
It will be seen from this diagram that in 1317 the land indus-
tries. forestry, fisheries, and mining, contributed £213,802,000 to
the total value of production, and manufactures £69,807,000.


MORE PEOPLE WANTED ON THE LAND.
The result of production from the land Industries is surprising,
considering the few people engaged in them, when compared with
the area of Australia. The reason why even greater progress is
not made in the development of wealth from the soil, is not now
so much due to faulty methods, as to lack of capital and labor
in dealing with such an immense territory. As a matter of fact,
great improvements have taken place during the last twenty-five
years in land settlement and production. Twenty-five years ago
the Mallee was a wilderness. People declared it was useless to
try and settle it. Riverina, too, was deemed unfit for the plough.
Now both these provinces are productive wheat fields. Improved
varieties of wheat, Improved methods of cultivation, now enable
profitable wheat crops to be grown over great areas where less
than a generation ago settlers were ruined in their attempts to
grow them by the faulty and unscientific methods which were
then in operation. The history of land settlement in Australia
bears eloquent testimony to the fact that the area of fertile
country, capable of sustaining prosperous farm settlements,
has indefinitely expanded, as correct methods of dealing
with the special problems of soil and climate which they
presented were mastered. Forty years ago, the line of
profitable settlement in Victoria was south of the Dividing
Range. The attempts to settle the Northern Plains, the
Qoulburn Valley, and the Wimmera. were looked upon as
experiments which would end in failure. Now railways
intersect the whole of these , areas and pay handsomely.
The line of profitable farm settlement has been moved
from the Dividing Range to the Murray, and there is l now
more wool, more fat stock, and a very large output of
wheat, and dairy produce and fruit, where little more than
a generation ago the whole area supported perhaps one
hundred station owners and their employes, and ruined as
many more.
What applies to the settlement of Northern Victoria
is applicable to the country back from the coastal fringe
in all the States. Each decade sees the extension of farm
settlement on land previously deemed only fit for pastoral
occupation. The extension of railways and more intelligent
methods of dealing with conditions of soil and climate, are
revolutionising the ideas once honestly but erroneously held
in respect to the suitability of great areas of the interior
for profitable farm settlement.
THE CONDITION OF THE PUBLIC ESTATE.
When a comprehensive view is taken of the position of land
settlement in the Commonwealth, the field which is available
for finding profitable occupation on the land for all the immigrants
of the right Class we: could attract to Australia, .is apparent.

tive figures and striking diagram:
The position of the Public Estate can be readily realised from

THE UNLIMITED MARKETS FOR FARM PRODUCTS.
The position in respect to markets for the staple products
of the land industries of Australia is so reassuring that the output
might be increased tenfold without; fear of reducing prices to
unremunerative rates. The higher standards of living increase


the demand for the staple commodities and necessaries of life
and comfort.
The markets of the world will take ail the wool, meat, wheat,
hides, tallow, dairy produce, and fruit Australia can raise.
Here, for instance, is a diagram representing Great .Britain’s
bill to her oversea dominions and foreign countries in 1913, for
portion of her annual requirements of food and raw material:
The year 1913 has been chosen for this diagram because it
was a year of normal trade. During the war and since the
cessation of hostilities the demand for raw material and food
products from abroad has been even greater, and the prices paid
for these much higher than before the war. This increased
demand may not be fully sustained, but portion of it, no doubt,
will remain, and to that extent ijdll increase the returns of 1913.
PART OF CIREAT BRITAIM'S BILL FOR FOREIGM
FOOD AND RAW MATERIAL 1913
Compared with the partion (shaded) from Australia.


As will be seen, the proportion of each item sent by Australia
(except in the case of wool), is small when compared with Great
Britain’s full purchases. All the nations of the world eagerly
compete for Australian wool, and buyers from many countries
visit Australia yearly and openly compete at the wool sales for
the product. The suitability of Australia for sheep husbandry,
in comparison with Canada, is shown by the fact that while the
total flocks of the Commonwealth in 1917 numbered 84,000,000.
Canada had less than 3,000,000 —one-fourth of the number in
Victoria. In cattle, the Commonwealth had 11,956,000, against
6,000,000 in Canada. Australia’s climate enables stock to roam
all the year in the open, and makes diversified agriculture possible
over wide areas. It is only a question of time when the Con-
tinental countries of Europe, as well as Great Britain, will look
to Australia for meat. Even the United States is finding that
she has no longer a surplus of beef for export, and will have to
look abroad in the near future for supplies for home consumption.
Her exports in bread stuffs, pig products, and other farm produc-
tions, in the years immediately before the war, were falling off
owing to the increase in heme requirements. So a wider oppor-
tunity is being given to Canada, Argentina, and Australia to
supply the European demand for these. The improvement in
cold storage and transport are yearly bringing' to such farm
products of Australia as butter, fruit, meat, pig and poultry pro-
ducts, a wider and more profitable market.
In due course, railways should bring the same facilities to the
Northern Territory and the unpeopled stretches of the West as
are now enjoyed by the Eastern seaboard. But if we delay dealing
with the immigration problem indefinitely, it may then be too
late to obtain settlers.
THE PRESENT TIME OPPORTUNE FOR OBTAINING
IMMIGRANTS.
Now that the work of the Repatriation Department in
settling returned Australian soldiers on the land is well
on the way to completion, it would seem an opportune
time to begin in real earnest to provide for the great
number of ex-service men and their relatives in Great
Britain who are ready to seek homes and occupations in
the British Dominions. As will be seen by the following
circular, which was sent out from the Overseas Settlement
Office, London, in May, 1919, the British Government is
prepared to provide free passages for ex-service men and
their dependants who wish to settle within the Empire
Overseas:—
OVERSEA SETTLEMENT WITHIN THE EMPIRE.
”His Majesty’s Government has decided that on and
after the Sth April, 1919, ex-service men, viz., officers and
men of the Royal Navy, the British Army (excluding Dominion
and Colonial Forces), or the Royal Air Force, who have served
in the present war and who wish to settle within the Empire


overseas, may obtain tree 3rd class passages at the lowest
Government rate for themselves and their dependants to the
nearest convenient port to their destination, provided that
they are approved under one of the agricultural settlement
schemes of the Oversea Governments or are going to assured
employment, and are otherwise acceptable to the Government
of the territory to which they desire to go. This privilege
will also be extended to the widows and dependants of ex-
service men as defined above, provided that they are entitled
to draw pension from Imperial Funds under the terms of the
Pensions Warrant.
“Free passages on the same conditions will ha granted to
ex-service women who enrolled for whole-time service for
not less than six months in a corps under the direction of a
British Government Department.
“The term ‘dependant’ includes, in the case of ex-service
men, legal wives and legitimate sons and step-sons under
16 years of age, and legitimate daughters and step-daughters
under 18 years of age; in the case of ex-service women and
widows of ex-service men legitimate children as defined above.
“The chief corps included in the definition of ex-service
women are the Women’s Royal Naval Service, Queen Mary’s
Army Auxiliary Corps, Women’s Royal Air Force. Women’s
Legion, Queen Alexandra’s Imperial Military Nursing Service
and Reserve, Queen Alexandra’s Royal Naval Nursing Service
and Reserve, Territorial Force Nursing Service, the V.A.D.
Naval and Military Nursing and General Service Members,
and members under contract to the British Red Cross and
Order of St. John of Jerusalem Joint War Committee, Women’s
Land Army, Scottish Women's Land Army. Women’s Forage
Corps, Women’s Forestry Corps.
“The grant of free passages will include the grant of a
3rd class railway warrant from the place of residence to the
port of embarkation.
“Although pensioners and reservists are eligible for a free
passage under the above conditions, their applications cannot
be granted until they have been referred to the Navy, Army,
or Air Force authorities for the grant of permission to proceed
abroad as required by the regulations. Pensioners and reser-
vists include, in the case of Naval ranks and ratings, officers
on the Reserved, Retired, or Emergency Lists R.N., officers
of the Reserve and Special Reserve of Officers Royal Marines,
and pensioners or reservists; in the case of the Army, officers
of the Reserve of Officers, Special Reserve of Officers and
Territorial Force, and soldiers belonging to any class of the
Reserve except class ‘Z ; and in the case of the Air Force,
officers on the unemployed list and airmen in class ‘B’ reserve.
Soldiers in ‘Z’ reserve and airmen in ‘G’ reserve do not require
permission to proceed overseas.
“It is not intended that the Government should provide
special shipping accommodation in connection with this
scheme, and passages can cnly be obtained as space becomes


available in the ordinary course. This, however, will not
Involve any delay in dealing with applications, and applicants,
as soon as they have been accepted, will be furnished with
a voucher which they can exchange for a passage ticket with-
out payment through the usual channels. Approved appli-
cants may avail themselves of any superior class on payment
of the difference to the shipping companies.
“It is, in any case, unlikely that the Governments of the
self-governing Dominions will be able to provide for ex-service
men and women from this country as settlers on the land
during the present year, owing to the need for settling their
own returning troops. It is therefore improbable that more
than a very limited number of free passages to those
Dominions can he granted before the beginning of 1920. Even
if the Dominions are willing to receive intending settlers
from this country earlier than that date, shipping accom-
modation will probably not be available for such settlers in
any number until the return of the Dominions’ troops has
been completed.
“(N.B. —This does not, of course, apply to those ordinarily
resident in other parts of the Empire, for whom repatriation
arrangements are already in force.)
“In these circumstances it has been arranged that applica-
tions may be sent in at any time up to the end of December,
1920, or within one year from the date of release from service,
whichever date is the latest,
“Ex-service men and women need, therefore, be in no
hurry to put in their application, and they should in their
own interests make sure, before making application, that
openings are not available at home. The largest number of
opportunities overseas is likely to be open to men with agri-
cultural experience, and to women who are prepared to take
up work as helps in the home or on a farm. In any case it
must be clearly understood that free passages will only be
granted to applicants who are ascertained to be acceptable to
the Oversea Governments.
“Applicants are warned that it is desirable not to take
any final steps towards breaking up their household arrange-
ments, etc., till the last possible moment. No liability can
be accepted by the Government on this account.
“Arrangements are being made to provide approved appli-
cants with a document which will take the place of a passport.
“Forms of application are obtainable from the Secretary,
Oversea Settlement Office, 59 Victoria Street, London, S.W. 1,
or from any Employment Exchange, or District Office of the
Appointments Department, or in the case of ex-service women,
from Corps Headquarters. The names of applicants will he
recorded at the Oversea Settlement Office.”
May, 1919.


JOINT ACTION BY COMMONWEALTH AND STATES
PROPOSED.
At the Conference of State Premiers held in Melbourne in
May, 1920, at which all the States and Commonwealth Govern-
ments were represented, the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) sub-
mitted the following proposals in regard to immigration:
1. The Commonwealth to have full control overseas.
2. The Agents-General of the several States to form a
consultative committee in Condon.
3. The Commonwealth to be responsible for, and have
control of, all overseas organisations and transport arrange-
ments for bringing immigrants to Australia,
4. The primary object of the scheme to be the settlement
of immigrants on the lands of Australia.
5. Preference to be given to British ex-service men. The
Commonwealth to seek the co-operation and assistance of the
British Government in obtaining the right type of immigrant
and finding passages.
6. The Commonwealth to assume financial responsibility
for the organisation for immigrants from overseas and their
transport to Australia.
7. The States to be responsible for immigrants on arrival
in Australia, and for their settlement on suitable land, or
employment on public works.
8. The States to enter into an agreement with the Com-
monwealth, setting out in definite terms what they bind
themselves to do in regard to providing (a) land, (b) other
forms of assistance, such as depots, sustenance, general care
of immigrants, employment on public works, particularly on
the unification of railways and on the Murray Waters Scheme
for (1) ex-service men, (2) other classes of immigrants.
The following clauses were added to these proposals;
1. That the Commonwealth will consult with the States
from time to time as to the number of immigrants required
by each State and the type.
2. That the Commonwealth undertake to assist the States
by way of loan for land settlement and public works schemes
approved by the Commonwealth.
On the motion of the Premier of Western Australia
(Mr, Mitchell) the Premiers agreed:
“That the scheme, as outlined by the Prime Minister, with
the additions agreed to, be approved by this Conference, and
that we undertake to submit the matter to our respective
Cabinets.’’
IMMIGRATION CONDITIONS BEFORE THE WAR.
Briefly reviewing the conditions during the yfears immediately
preceding the war in respect to immigration in the chief countries
receiving immigrants, the following facts may be noted:


UNITED STATES.
A policy of restriction rather than encouragement marked off
the Government of the United States from those of other countries
In its attitude to the subject of immigration.
No active control over immigration was assumed either by the
State or .Federal Governments till 1882, when Congress passed
its first important immigration law. From that time forward
various enactments were passed, controlling and restricting immi-
gration to the States. Persons suffering from certain bodily and
mental infirmities and others whose introduction was deemed
undesirable, were excluded from the country.
A head tax of 50 cents (2s. Id.) was imposed in 1891 on all
immigrants entering the United States. This tax was several
times increased, and under the Immigration Act of 1907 was fixed
at 4 dollars (16s. Bd.). .Legislation dealing with contract labor
prohibited the introduction of immigrants to the country under
engagement to perform manual labor (personal and domestic
(service excluded) unless the Secretary of Commerce and Labor
determined that labor of like kind, unemployed, could not be
found in the country.
Although Federal and State Governments took no active part
in obtaining immigrants, the work was accomplished by private
enterprise, and chiefly through the operation of shipping and
railway companies, though these provided no concessions to
immigrants, in the way of reduced fares, as was done by the
Australian Governments. The railroads in America are privately
owned, and the railway companies recognised that increased
population meant increased traffic, both in passengers and freight,
and accordingly it was to <he interests of private ownership to
encourage immigration to the country. In many cases the rail-
way companies had large land grants for building the lines, and
these had to be developed by settlement.
The work of these-railway companies, and also of the shipping
companies, in obtaining immigrants, was done mainly through
agents, who toured the country districts, chiefly those of Southern
Europe, and endeavored to induce the inhabitants to migrate to
America.
CANADA.
Between the years ISSO and 1900 Canada lost no less than
2,500,000 settlers through emigration to the United States. This
exodus took place in spite of the fertility of her Western prairies
and other advantages to the farmer which, under a wise and
progressive policy of immigration, have since been so amply
demonstrated.
The reason for the above loss is not far to seek. It was be-
cause, up to the year 1900, Canada had no properly organised
system to attract and recruit the land worker. In subsequent
years strenuous efforts were made in Great Britain, the Continent
,of Europe, and in the United States, to add to the population of
primary producers. These efforts were highly successful.


In the year 1900-1901, the total immigration into Canada was
under 50,000; each succeeding year there was a steady increase,
until in 1912-13 no less than 402,500 settlers arrived, Including
139,000 from the United States. Those from Great Britain num-
bered 150,500, or nearly forty per cent, of the total for that year.
The balance came, principally, from the Continent of Europe.
The Dominion Government of Canada spent about £300,000
per annum in the years immediately preceding the war in securing
settlers, but no monetary assistance nor rebates in fares were
provided. On the contrary, each arrival was required, according
to the season in which he landed, to posses? from 15 to £lO cash.
This was waived in the case of those going to assured employ-
ment or domestic service.
RECRUITING METHODS.
Only farmers, farm laborers, and female domestics were in-
vited. In the British Isles advertising was carried on by (1) the
establishment of regular agencies—there were eight in England
and Wales, two in Scotland, and two in Ireland; (2) newspaper
publicity; (3) free distribution of pamphlets; (4) exhibits of agri-
cultural produce in the Canadian offices and agencies, leading
steamship offices and agents, and exhibits at country fairs through-
out the United Kingdom; (5) exhibition waggons, which carried
samples of grain and grasses. These travelled throughout the
country and penetrated to out of the way places, and some carried
picture films for lectures at night; (6) illustrated lectures qn
Canada by regular agents and farmer delegates, a number of whom
were sent annually during the winter months to tell of their
personal and successful experience in Canada; (7) payment pf
bonuses to immigration agents, upon whom, however, check was
kept to weed out undesirables.
The methods pursued*by Canada in the United States were
confined largely to (1) newspaper advertisement; (2) distribution
pf literature; (3) exhibits at fairs in the Eastern, Central, and
Northern States.
On the Continent, Canada had two agencies—one in France and
one in Belgium, and recruiting agents were employed.
There was no assisted immigration into Canada, and bonuses
to immigration agents were paid only on some 17 per cent, of
the British settlers, and on about 3 per cent, of American in-
comers. The rest applied for their passages voluntarily, through
hearing about the country.
DISPOSAL AFTER ARRIVAL.
On arrival, the would-be settler was very strictly examined
with regard to health, and was then passed on into the country,
where there were immigration agencies at various points to
help him to find employment or otherwise make a start. If he
desired to take up land for homesteading, he could apply. for
160 acres on payment of a fee of £2, when a certificate of entry
w T as granted and he could lake up residence. To obtain his tit’e.


he had to reside for at least six months in each of three consecu-
tive years on the land, and cultivate it, when he could obtain full
possession of the freehold.
Much of the land was obtained by settlers from the railway
companies, which made provision for breaking up large areas of
land, sowing grain crops, and building houses, but the incomer
had to pay a substantial amount in cash down for these privileges.
It was found that the average farm settler was possessed of about
£250.
Under the Immigration Rules, the authorities kept in touch
with the immigrant, and provision was made for sending him back
if during three years he did not behave properly.
JUVENILE IMMIGRATION TO CANADA.
Juvenile immigration received a great deal of attention in
Canada. About 2,500 children per annum, between the ages of
11 and 13, were received. These children were drafted into foster
homes, where they were well housed, fed, schooled, and re-
munerated for that class of farm labor which a juvenile could
undertake. On attaining the age of 17 or 18 the boys went
harvesting, and eventually took to homesteading or became tenant
farmers. The applications received for these children far ex-
ceeded their number, being in the proportion of about 7 to 1.
AUSTRALIA.
In the years immediately preceding the war all the States,
with the exception of Tasmania, re-entered on an active immigra-
tion policy.
The earliest efforts of the States to secure immigrants go hack
to 1850, and for a number of years subsequently; such efforts were
responsible for a large number of State-aided immigrants. In
1854 no less than 1242,656 was spent on immigration by New South
Wales alone.
The principle of assisted immigration was gradually discon-
tinued by several of the States In consequence of objections raised
against the expense involved in such a scheme. In New South
Wales it was discontinued in 1887, hut revived again in 1905; in
South Australia discontinued in 1886, and revived in 1911; in
Victoria discontinued in 1873, and revived in 1910. Tasmania
discontinued in 1891 and not since revived. Queensland and
Western Australia did not discontinue the principle of State aid,
though for a number of years no activity was displayed in the
matter. The net gain to the Australian States from immigration
for the period 1906-12 was 224,046, and was distributed as fol-
lows: —New South Wales, 92,471; Victoria, 51,546; Queensland,
35,223; South Australia, 23,453; and Western Australia, 21,353.
For the nine months ending September, 1913, there was a net gain
to the States of 50,839. These figures applied to all immigrants,
and not to those only who came to the country under State aid.
Nearly all these immigrants came from Great Britain.


METHODS OF ATTRACTING IMMIGRANTS.
Each of the States made their own arrangements as far as
obtaining immigrants from abroad was concerned, and the
methods adopted were practically uniform. The resources and
attractions of the country were advertised—
1. By means of information published in pamphlets and
booklets prepared by each State for its own use and distributed
throughout Great Britain.
2. By articles published in newspapers and magazines in
circulation in Great Britain and elsewhere.
3. Exhibitions of natural products, etc., at agricultural
shows and other places attracting considerable numbers of
people, and
4. By employing the services of immigration agents.
The head office in Great Britain of the Immigration Department
of each of the States was at the headquarters of the Agents-
General of the respective States in London. The employment of
immigration agents was largely availed of by all the States, and
was found, with proper supervision, to be one of the most effective
means for obtaining the class of immigrants desired.
ASSISTED PASSAGE FARES.
Each of the five States named made concessions to all immi-
grants who were farmers, farm workers, skilled artisans, and all
nominated and indented male immigrants, in the way of reduced
steamship fares to Australia.
ASSISTED AND NOMINATED IMMIGRANTS.
Assisted immigrants were classed under two heads, selected
and nominated. “Selected” comprised those who were selected
by immigration officers in London as suitable immigrants, and
who complied with the conditions imposed by the several States.
“Nominated” included wives, children, and relatives of persons
resident in Australia or agricultural or other rural workers or
persons whose introduction to the States would not, in the opinion
of the authorities, cause congestion in the States in any occupation
or trade —such persons being nominated by persons resident in
Australia. The number of assisted immigrants who came to
Australia during the period 1908-12 was 120,070, made up as fol-
lows; —New South Wales, 37,140, Queensland, 31,731; Victoria,
25,180: South Australia, 3,877; and Western Australia, 22,142, For
the nine months ending September, ,1913, the number was 27,721,
distributed as follows: —New South Wales. 8,029; Victoria, 8,874;
Queensland, 3,221 ; South Australia, 2,043; Western Australia, 5,554.
COMMONWEALTH ASSISTANCE IN IMMIGRATION.
As far as the Commonwealth Government is concerned, power
is given to it under the Federal Constitution to make laws with
respect to emigration and immigration, but so far very little
administrative work has been accomplished. During the period
1908-1912, £72,017 was expended by the Commonwealth Govern-
ment in advertising the resources and attractions of Australia
abroad.


The Commonwealth officers have authority to put to any per-
sons seeking entrance to Australia, a dictation test in any
European language. Those failing to pass such a test are not
permitted to remain in the country. As a matter of practice, the
test is not put to British subjects or other persons whoso
nationality is not objected to, but is mainly, if not solely, for the
purpose of excluding Asiatic and other colored races. The Con-
tracts Immigrants Act of 1905 prohibits the immigration of persons
to Australia under contracts to perform manual labor except under
certain conditions. One of these conditions, which, however, does
not apply to British subjects either born in the United Kingdom
or descended from a British subject born here, is that there is a
difficulty in obtaining within the Commonwealth a workman of
at least equal skill and ability.
CONCLUSION.
In the foregoing pages, an attempt has been made to give a
brief outline of European immigration over a series of decades
before the war; to point out the slow increase in the population
of the Commonwealth which must necessarily result from de-
pendence on natural increase alone, and the urgent need of
adopting an active immigration policy to supplement this natural
increase, if Australia is to obtain a population sufficiently largo
to develop adequately her resources and safeguard her national
well being.
The steady stream of European emigrants during the last fifty
years to the United States enriched that country and helped
materially to make it one of the leading nations of the world.
Within the last fifteen years, portion of this stream has been
diverted to Canada and has Increased her progress and prosperity.
Both countries are still attracting European emigrants, and are
much nearer to Europe than Australia. The need, therefore, is all
the greater that Australia should wake up and resolutely deter-
mine to obtain a fair share of immigrants, and more especially
those from Great Britain, before it is too late.
The scheme for .joint action by Commonwealth and State
Governments to obtain immigrants, which was agreed to at the
Premiers’ Conference in Melbourne in June last, is an excellent
one. To achieve adequate results it must not only be put in
operation immediately, but must be effectively sustained over a
long period. There is little hope of this being done unless public
opinion, convinced of the paramount importance of securing a
more rapid Increase in the population of Australia, insists that it
shall be done. All that may be hoped for from dependence on
the birth rate alone is that Australia may double her population
in thirty-six years. That is a very discouraging outlook for
national growth. What Australia needs to-day is an insistent
call for more people—for tens of thousands of our own kin from
the Home-Land, freely invited to share our Empire heritage and
make a truly great Nation for ourselves and our posterity.
