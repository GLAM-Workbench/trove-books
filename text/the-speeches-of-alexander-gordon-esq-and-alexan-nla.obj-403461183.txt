Mr. Alexander G-ordon. —Mt Lord, —The third Resolution
which I now rise to move is in the following terms : —“ That it
“is desirable to apply to the Legislature for such sanction or
“ recognition of the Constitution so to he determined upon as
“ will secure its practical working, and in particular will make
“ subject to it all property devoted to the support of the Church
“ in this Colouy, and which is not affected by any express trust.’
I am aware, from the discussion which has already taken place,
that this Resolution is regarded as one of considerable import-
ance : it will therefore be necessary for me in introducing it to
trespass at greater length than I have before done on the time of
the Conference. The Resolution embraces three propositions,
the first, That it is desirable to apply to the Legislature for
sanction or recognition; the second, That this sanction or recog-
nition is to be of the Constitution to be determined on by this
Conference ; and the third, That the object of this sanction or
recognition is to secure the practical working of the Constitution,
and in particular to make subject to it all Church property not
affected by any express trust. I may state, in opening, that the
Resolution admits, or rather is based on, the assertion that the
Church of England is to be regarded as a voluntary association,
with the same power of making rules for the management of its
own affairs that any other such association possesses. Notv if


and then one diocese to break oft’ from the Synod, the General
Synod would have no control over the property to prevent the
diocese so breaking off from claiming to take its share of the pro-
perty ; and any attempt by the General Synod to retain it would
be met by the interference of the Court. Thus had the Diocese
of Christchurch persisted in its determination to withdraw from
the General Synod, it would probably have been able to claim its
share of the general Church property, or at least of some part of
it. There is in fact nothing to induce us to follow the course of
proceeding adopted in New Zealand.
The conclusion then at which I arrive is, first, that we require
legislative sanction of some kind, and secondly, that this sanction
is to be given to the Constitution which we are about to frame,
and not to some Compact to observe that Constitution. What
we really want is such legislative sanction as will make the Con-
stitution work practically, we want it in particular in reference
to property, so as to subject the temporalities of the Church to
the rules and principles laid down by the Constitution of the
Church. Such being the end to be attained, I venture, on the
grounds I have stated, to propose for the adoption of the Confe-
rence the Resolution which I have already read.
It is of course impossible for me to anticipate the arguments
which may be used against it, and I should only weary the Con-
ference by trying to do so. I have however, I believe, sufficiently
placed the matter before the Conference for discussion, and may
probably avail myself of the opportunity afforded by a reply to
deal, as far as may be necessary, with what may be specially urged
in opposition to the Resolution.
FRIDAY, APRIL 13th.
Mr. Alexander Stuart, — This Conference, it appears to me,
would not have met in vain were it now to separate without
coming to any other result than to have heard the address of the

reverend member from Newcastle, the only reverend member
from that diocese who has as yet favored us with his views on the
subject. That gentleman (theEev. W. E. White) has shewn to
what a thin attenuated form has grown the difference between
the party of whose views he must now be considered as one of
the chief exponents, and those of the party ranging themselves
under the leadership of the learned Chancellor of the Diocese of
Sydney. He has shewn that, after all the hard words and strong
blows that have been given and received, the matter has resolved
itself into a thin film over the eyes of the one party or of the
other. My object in now addressing you is to endeavour to
remove that film, and if the reverend gentleman will give me his
attention for a short time, I shall not despair of his yet joining
hand in hand with us in asking from the Parliament that legis-
lation which we desire to have, and which we ought to have had
long ere this. And here I would digress to answer a question
propounded at an earlier part of this debate by my reverend
and esteemed friend Mr. Stack, who asked how it came to
pass that when in almost every colony throughout the British
Empire the Church had some form or other of Synodical
action, in this, the oldest of all, she was yet without any?
The reverend member used a very homely illustration,
that while others have had their pudding and enjoyed
it, ours, after many years of manipulation was still in the
hands of the chief cook of the diocese; but I would
ask the reverend member whose fault is this P It is not that the
pudding has not been prepared, it is just simply because those
for whom it was prepared would not eat it; because having some
ingredient in it which was not equally palatable to all, many
cried out “ we wont eat this pudding, it is too rich for us, we are
afraid it may disagree with us,” overlooking the fact that the
ingredient objected to was the very one which gave coherence to
the whole. But, to drop the metaphor, the sole reason of our not
having a Synod or Synods in this colony, has been our internal
dissensions, our want of unity, —not opposition from without but
from within the Church. To return, however, to the reverend
member from Newcastle, he laid down four propositions, to three
of which I give the most unqualified assent.
