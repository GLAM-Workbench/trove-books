GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES
AND THE
POSTAL SERVICES
INDIA, CHINA, AND AUSTRALIA
Tub contract with the Peninsular and Oriental
Steam Navigation Company for the conveyance of
the India and China mails, dated 19th November,
1867 (modified in 1874), expires on Ist February,
1880, and there is now awaiting discussion by the
House of Commons a fresh contract, which, so far
from securing to the public the benefit accruing
from the opening up of the East by means of the
Suez Canal, is more disadvantageous to the public
than any of its predecessors.
So long as the Isthmus of Suez presented an
insuperable barrier to direct communication with
the East, it was necessary for postal purposes to
have two distinct fleets—one on this side of Egypt,
the other in the Indian Ocean. This involved the
maintenance of separate dockyards, engineering
shops, store depots, &c., in Eastern seas. These
are no longer necessary. Supplies can now be


sent from home as required, and steamers can be
periodically overhauled in England,
Before 1869, in which year the Canal was opened,
the P. and 0. Company was the only English com-
pany having regular communication with the East
by way of the Mediterranean, and was in con-
sequence practically without competitors for the
postal service.
There is now a large fleet of steamers engaged
in the trade. According to the latest Parlia-
mentary Report, 1494 vessels, representing
2,940,708 gross register tons, passed through the
Canal in 1875. The traffic has since increased,
and may now be estimated at nearly 3,500,000
tons per annum. Many of these ships are among
the finest afloat.
These changed economic conditions, and this
marvellous development of steam communication
with the East, constitute a new standpoint from
which the fresh postal arrangements now proposed
ought to be regarded.
It will be found instructive to trace the history
of our postal arrangements with the East.
I. —The India and China Mail Services,
1837-1880.
It is now nearly forty years since a Royal
Charter of Incorporation authorized the raising of
the capital of the P. and O. Company. The
original sum to be raised was one million sterling,


with power to increase to one and a half million
under Treasury sanction. The Company obtained
subsequently supplementary Charters, dated 23rd
December, 1845, 13th April, 1854, 7th February,
1867, and 17th March, 1876, under which the
share capital and borrowing powers of the Com-
pany were from time to time augmented to their
present amounts, viz. 3,500,000/. share capital,
and 800,000/. debenture loans. The Company’s
published balance sheet for 30th September, 1878,
represents the- paid-up capital as 2,900,000/., and
the debenture bonds as amounting to 284,000/.,
which latter were reduced to 147,000/. by May
1879.
From the modest beginnings of a service be-
tween Falmouth and Gibraltar (1837), the Company
gradually extended the field of its operations. In
1840 the Company’s vessels superseded the old
Admiralty packets, and conveyed the mails as far
as Alexandria. Two years later the steamship
‘ Hindostan ’ was despatched to open the new line
between Calcutta, Madras, Ceylon, and Suez. It
was reasonable, in view of the efforts made by the
P. and O. Company to establish a regular postal
service in the Indian seas, that a contract for five
years should have been given to them in 1844, with
a subsidy of 160,000/. per annum for the combined
India and China services. Under this contract
the mails were conveyed at a cost of twenty
shillings per mile to Madras and Calcutta, and of
twelve shillings per mile to Singapore and China,


as compared with forty shillings per mile, the cost
of the Admiralty packets. The Company paid to
its shareholders at this period a dividend of about
9 per cent, per annum.
In 1848 the contract, which was to expire in
the following year, was, after much delay and
hesitation, renewed for three years; but that there
was already some feeling of dissatisfaction either at
the cost of the mail service or at the manner in
which it was performed may be gathered from the
fact that in the Session of 1849 a Select Committee
was appointed to inquire into the contract packet
service.
The resolutions agreed to by the Committee
were as follows:—
“1. That so far as the Committee are able to
judge from the evidence they have taken, it appears
that the mails are conveyed at a less cost by hired
packets than by Her Majesty’s vessels.
“ 2. That some of the existing contracts have
been put up to public tender and some arranged
by private negotiation, and that a very large sum
beyond what is received from postage is paid on
some of the lines ; but considering that at the time
these contracts were arranged the success of these
large undertakings was uncertain, your Committee
see no reason to think better terms could have
been obtained for the public.
“ 3. Your Committee recommend great caution
either in renewing the existing or forming new


arrangements. They suggest that.... the most
strict and searching inquiry should be instituted
. . . . into the cost of the execution, into the
manner in which the service has been performed,
and into the profits resulting from the several
transactions to the companies by which they have
been respectively carried on; and if it should be
decided to put up the several contracts to public
tender, ample notice and full particulars of the
terms and conditions of the service required should
be given to the public, as being the means most
likely to secure a real competition by responsible
parties.”
In the Session of 1851 a second Parliamentary
Committee was appointed, “to inquire into the
existing steam communication with India and
China, and into the practicability of effecting any
improvement therein; and also into the best means
of establishing steam communications between
England, India, China, Australia, New Zealand,
or any of them.”
The Committee, whilst recognizing the services
rendered by the P. and 0. Company, considered
that “ a higher rate of speed should be insisted on
in the new contract, that penalties for failure in
speed should be fixed and rigidly enforced, and
that the only mode by which the public could be
benefited in the matter of freight and passage
charges was by the establishment of wholesome
competition .”


a. 1853 Contract.
In January, 1853, the P. and 0. Company ob-
tained the whole of the Peninsular and Eastern
service, at an average mileage rate of 6s. 2d. A
fortnightly communication with India and China
was then established, at a cost per mile about fifty
per cent, cheaper than had previously been paid
for a monthly one.
At this period the communications between
England and the East were as follows:
1. A bi-monthly service between Southampton
and Alexandria, with a branch from Malta to
Marseilles, for the conveyance of the mails coming
through France.
2. A bi-monthly service between Suez, Cal-
cutta, and Hong Kong—the separation of the
Madras and Calcutta from the China mails taking
place at Point de Gialle.
3. A service every two months between Singa-
pore and Sydney, touching at Batavia, Swan River,
Adelaide, and Port Philip.
On 7th July, 1854, a supplementary contract
provided for the conveyance of mails to Bombay,
the effect being the reduction of the mileage rate
under the combined contracts to 4a 2d. per mile.
The total amount of subsidy paid for these ser-
vices to the P. and 0. Company was 224,300/. per
annum, but in a few months the service between
Singapore and Sydney was given up, and the


annual payment consequently reduced by 17,475£. 2s.
The Australian mail service was revived in 1859,
with an increased subsidy.
The Admiralty required that the vessels em-
ployed should attain a speed of 12 knots on the
measured mile, in order to assure a contract speed
of 10 knots per hour. The contract of January,
1853, provided that (with the exception of the
Australian mail packets) the speed throughout
should be 10 knots per hour.
As regards the India and China services, the
1853 contract remained in force, with very few
modifications, down to 1865, in which year Govern-
ment consented to a system of premiums and
penalties on each voyage, in lieu of the trial for
speed of 12 knots on the measured mile.
During the period of the 1853 contract the
P. and 0. Company continued to pay high divi-
dends (averaging upwards of 9 per cent, per
annum) to its shareholders, and when the need
for increased transport service arose during the
Crimean war and Indian mutiny, was able to
furnish the Government with powerful and com-
modious ships on charter for the conveyance of
men and materiel.
The 1853 contract was, by mutual consent of
the Government and the P. and 0. Company, con-
tinued from 1865 until the contract of 19th
November, 1867, came into operation.


h. '1867 Contract.
In 1867 the construction of the Suez Canal was
far advanced, but neither the politicians nor the
masses of this country had learned to look upon
the scheme as a practical one. The fleets of steam-
ships which proved to be ready to use the canal
as soon as it was opened were not then available.
The P. and 0. Company continued therefore, in
1867, to be practically the only possible contractor.
Under these circumstances, the prudent course for
the Government to follow would have been to have
a contract for as short a period as possible,
with definite stipulations securing to the public
the advantages which would result if the Canal
scheme should prove a success during the continu-
ance of the contract.
What actually happened was this. The P. and
O. Comp'any offered to make a six years’ contract,
with an annual subsidy of 500,000/. The Govern-
ment preferred a twelve years’ contract, with an
annual minimum subsidy of 400,000/., and a
clause agreeing to increase the subsidy to 500,000/.,
if required to raise the available annual profits of
the P. and O. Company to 160,000/., equal to
6 per cent, on their capital. The Company was
not then paying any dividend. The contract was
closed on these terms. The prospective opening
of the Canal was not referred to. By an arrange-
ment made on 6th August, 1870, the partnership


clause was cancelled, and the annual subsidy raised
to a fixed sum of 450,000?. (equal to a mileage rate
of 65. 10c?.). This modification was made at the
instance of the Government, who had found by
experience that the clause involved the payment
of the full sum of 500,000?. per annum. The
service required by the 1807 contract was mainly
the same as by that of 1853. Among the changes
were the following: The intervals between
despatches of steamers were to be regulated by
weeks instead of by calendar months, and a service
from Hong Kong to Japan was added.
Whereas the 1853 contract stipulated for a
minimum of 10 knots throughout, the contract of
1867 reduced the minimum speed to 9i knots on
the routes east of Suez. • At least this is the
stipulation in the contract, but there are considera-
tions, unnecessary to be detailed here, which would
support the view that the speed required under
the 1853 and 1867 contracts was practically the
same.
The mileage rate under the 1867 contract was
raised to 6s. 10c?., as compared with 4s. 2 d. under
the 1853 contract.
As the Australian mail service was provided for
by a separate and distinct contract overlapping the
India and China contracts of 1853 and 1867, it
has been eliminated from consideration in the
present review of these contracts, and will be dealt
with further on.


Within two years of the signing of the contract
the Suez Canal was opened.
The advantages at once accruing to the Company
were immense. It appears from the Blue Book of
20th July, 1866, that the Company maintained
large dockyard establishments at Bombay, Cal-
cutta, and Hong Kong. These are now practically
discontinued. It further appears from the Blue
Book that coals at Suez cost the Company then
85s. 10</. per ton into bunkers. The present price
of coals at Suez is 41s. 6 d. per ton, but vessels
passing through the Canal coal at Port Said, where
the price of coals is 275. 6c/. per ton. From the
P. and 0, Company’s published reports, we learn
that in the year 1868, in which the contract of
1867 came into force, the value of stores, including
coals in the Company’s depots, chiefly in the East,
was while in the year 1878 the value
of such stores was only 87,428/. This reduction
of stores has enabled the Company to reduce its
debenture bonds, which in 1868 amounted to
800,000/., to 147,000/., according to the Directors’
Report dated 30th May, 1879., Before the Canal
was opened, the Company’s steamers had to be
sent round the Cape of Good Hope on their way
to or from the Indian stations. This cost from
5000/, to 10,000/. each vessel. The total amount
expended by the Company on this account up to
1866 was 320,000/. Since the Canal opened, ex-
penditure under this head has, of course, ceased.


The contract being for twelve years absolute,
Government was precluded from raising a claim to
a reduction in the subsidy. The Government bad
still, however, one hold upon the Company. The
contract, which in no way recognized the Canal,
stipulated that the mails from Southampton should
be sent across the Isthmus by land, and forwarded
from Suez by a fresh steamer. Government, on
being applied to by the Company to waive this
stipulation, and permit the Southampton steamers
to run through with the mails, asked a reduction
of 100,000/. a year off the subsidy as the price of
the concession. Government had only to remain
firm, and the Company must have given what
was asked, or submitted to a revision of the con-
tract in view of the altered conditions, it having
become necessary for the Company to run their
steamers through the Canal to enable them to
compete in the open freight market with their
unsubsidized rivals. But in 1874, Government,
for what reason does not appear, surrendered at
discretion, granted the favour asked, and accepted
a nominal concession of 20,000/. per annum.
During the term of the contract of 1867,
namely, from Ist February, 1868, to Ist February,
1880, the amount paid and payable by the Imperial
Government to the P. and O. Company in respect
of subsidy is 5,350,000/. This does not include
subsidies for the Australian service and from other
quarters, amounting to upwards of one million and


a half sterling. Notwithstanding these enormous
subsidies, and in spite of the improved economic
conditions of the service, the dividends, including
insurance bonus paid by the P. and 0. Company
to its shareholders since 1867 have averaged only
5 per cent, per annum, as compared with upwards
of 9 percent, during the preceding twenty-five years.
Nor has it been found during later years that
the fleet of the P. and 0. Company has been of the
same national importance on occasions of great
emergency as previously. Out of 200 vessels
hired by Government in connection with the
Abyssinian Expedition, only six were P. and 0.
ships. Out of about twenty-five vessels hired for
the transport of the Indian contingent to Malta,
only one, the ‘ Bangalore,’ belonged to the P. and
0. Company, and she was the first vessel to be
paid off, the reason being her high rate of hire.
And later still, we find that on the arrival of
the news of the Natal disaster, when there was
need of immediate reinforcements at the Cape, not
a single ship of the P. and 0. fleet was forth-
coming. It is thus revealed that from the time of
the Crimean war down to the time of the South
African war, the value of the P. and 0. Company
for transport purposes has gradually diminished,
until the service has quite ceased to be of special
public importance from this point of view.
The Suez Canal was opened in November, 1869,
and there passed through it—

•Of the vessels using the Canal in 1878, 1268
were under the British flag, with a gross register
tonnage of 2,630,285. There is no return avail-
able to show the amount of the tonnage belonging
to the P. and O. Company passing through the
Canal; but it is estimated at about one-tenth of
the whole. Of the remaining unsubsidized nine-
tenths, a considerable proportion is eminently fitted
for the carrying of mails. The despatch and
arrival of steamers belonging to many of the lines
are maintained with a regularity hardly surpassed
by the mail steamers. In some cases a higher rate
of speed is attained. It thus appears that the im-
portance of the P. and O. Company for mail pur-
poses also is very considerably reduced since 1867.
This shrinkage of the absolute prosperity of the
P. and O. Company, and of its relative national
importance, both for transport and for mail pur-
poses, which has been traced as accompanying
an increased subsidy and improved economic
conditions, suggests —
that the P. and 0. Company’s subsidy is
largely used for covering losses on mercantile


business, while competing steamers are run profit-
ably on mercantile revenue alone ;
that the time has arrived for the careful recon-
sideration of mail routes ; and
for the subdivision of the service, probably
resulting in its distribution among various com-
peting companies.
The present system is at once costly to the 'tax-
payer, unremunerative to the shareholders in the
favoured company, and unfair to the competing
companies.
[.Postage rates and estimated British loss on the
Eastern and Australian services are stated in Ap-
pendices V. and Vl.]
II. —The India and China Mail Service.
The Proposed Contract.
By the contract which has been laid upon the
table of the House of Commons, and is now await-
ing discussion, not only is the whole and un-
divided mail service with the East, proposed to be
awarded to the P. and 0. Company for a term of
eight years from February 1880, to be carried on by
routes, which, as will be shown, are antiquated and
expensive; but the price named, 370,000/., although
apparently cheaper, is actually 40 per cent, higher
than the previous contract —tested by the only
true test —the mileage rate. The price now pro-
posed is equal to 9s. 6 d. per mile, the mileage
being 776,724 miles per annum, as compared with


6s. B \d. per mile for 1,278,940 miles under the
contract now about to expire.
[N.B. — According to the Treasury Minute of
12 th February, 1879, the P. and 0. Company are
to run special steamers for the China Service, only
between Suez and Shanghai. According to the contract
and the P. and 0. Company's letter of 25th July,
1878, to the Post Office, giving a total mileage of
797,836 miles, it would seem as if it were meant to
run a special steamer for the China service between
Brindisi and Alexandria. It is assumed, however,
in this pamphlet that the India steamer will carry
the China mails between Brindisi and Alexandria.
This will explain the discrepancy between the mileage
and rate per mile given above and the figures given
by the P. and 0. Company. (See Appendix 111. D.f\
This reduction in mileage arises from the discon-
tinuance of the lines between China and Japan, and
Calcutta and Galle, and from the service between
Southampton and Alexandria being either aban-
doned or reserved as matter for separate contract.
The speed proposed is 91 to 11 knots an hour
for the Bombay service, and 9-j to 10- knots for
the China service, according to monsoon —a slight
increase in speed which falls short of representing
the advance in marine engineering.
The action of the Government in the negotiation
of this contract is even more inexplicable than the
course pursued in 1867. Then, although there
were no competitors in the field, the advertise-
ment calling for tenders was issued six months


before the date fixed for receiving them. In 1878,
when there were many possible competitors, to all
of whom time to make the necessary arrangements
for undertaking the service was indispensable,
only twenty-nine days’ notice was given by ad-
vertisement. (See Appendix IV.) In 1867 the
Government advertisement for tenders contem-
plated the breaking up of the service into sections.
In 1878, despite their having invited offers for
sectional service, the Government have rejected
such offers when made, assigning the reason that
they do not provide a complete service.
It is in connection with the proposal to break
up the service into sections that we touch the
kernel of the question.
By what route ought letters to be conveyed to
China and Australia ? Let us deal first with
China. Before the Indian Railway system was
developed, the route to Shanghai, as to Calcutta,
was via Galle. It is not so now. Railways con-
structed at great expense, and guaranteed by the
Indian Government, traverse the peninsula. Rail-
ways determine postal routes. Southampton long
ago yielded to Marseilles, which in turn has given
place to Brindisi. The same forces are at work
in the East. The most direct route to China is now
via Bombay, thence by rail to Calcutta (up to which
point the arrangement of steamers and railway
trains requisite for the Calcutta mails would serve
also for the China mails), thence per steamer to
Singapore, Hong Kong, and Shanghai.


Yet the Government insist upon complicating
the Eastern service by sending the mails for China
vid Gallo, an arrangement which involves the
absurdity of two highly-subsidized steamers carry-
ing mails running almost parallel to each other for
nearly 3000 miles each way every fortnight. If
the direct route were adopted, the delivery of mails
in China would be accelerated, and about 180,000
miles of sea voyage would be saved annually, as
is shown by the following calculation.
The whole distance covered by steamer carrying China mails now is:
From Suez to Galle 3442 miles
„ Galle to Shanghai .. 3901
Total .. 7343
Whereas
from Suez to Calcutta is pro-
vided for by the Indian service,
and the distance from Calcutta
to Shanghai is only .. .. 3887 „
miles.
Difference ..3456x52=179,712.
This difference gives at 9s. 6 d. per mile (the
mileage rate of the proposed contract) an amount of
85,000/. per annum, which it is proposed to pay
away unnecessarily. But the cost of the China
mail service ought, for reasons which will presently
appear, to be reduced by much more than the sum
just stated.
The adoption of the route vid Calcutta for the
China mails would involve a subdivision of the
service.
Ist. The service to Bombay, the sea-carriage for
which ought to be performed under two distinct
contracts, viz., one for the section between Italy


and Alexandria, and another for that between Suez
and Bombay.
With reference to this service, the Indian
Government wrote to the Secretary of State
for India, under date Ist November, 1877, as
follows:
“ It should also be stated that the Indian Post-
Office does not want the lines to Galle, the Straits,
or China, or, indeed, any line except that between
Bombay and Brindisi, and if such lines are included
in the contract, the Indian Post-Office is not dis-
posed to pay any share of their cost.”
Also as follows: —“ I would suggest that the
Alexandria-Brindisi section be made the subject of
separate tender.”
2nd. The service between Calcutta and China.
With reference to this, the Indian Government
wrote further under same date:—
“India has already other means of communica-
tion with Ceylon and the Straits, and even with
China. The steamers of Messrs. Jardine, Matheson
and Co., of Hong Kong, and Apcar, of Calcutta,
although not timed to start on fixed dates, form
by far the quickest, and consequently most ap-
preciated, means of conveyance.”
If therefore the testimony of the Indian Govern-
ment is to be accepted as to the sufficiency of
the unsubsidized opportunities already existing,
it would seem as if everything specially relating
to the China service, including the full proportion
thereto attaching of the munificent subsidy, might


be expunged from the proposed contract without
any detriment to the public interest.
The proportion of the subsidy under the pro-
posed contract attaching to the China service is
upwards of 180,000 Z. per annum, say:—
Total Mileage from Suez via Galle to Shanghai.
7,343 miles
52 voyages
381,836 miles
9s. 6 d. mileage rate
181,3727.
It must, however, be conceded, that in order to
secure the continuity of the mail service as a whole,
it might be necessary to subsidize a line whose
departures and arrivals from and at Calcutta would
fit in with the arrivals and departures of European
mails. With the commercial relations subsisting
between Calcutta and China this could easily be
arranged at a sum which would be a mere frac-
tional part of 180,000^.
There would remain to be considered the general
postal requirements of Ceylon, which could be
sufficiently met by local arrangements between the
Island and Tuticorin, the terminus of the railway
on the mainland. Besides, many of the steam lines
trading to the East call at Ceylon regularly.
In deciding to adopt the costly route to China vid
Galle, the Government seem to have been influ-
enced mainly by considerations connected with
the Australian Colonies, urged upon them by Sir
Michael Hicks Beach in a minute (hereinafter


referred to) in which the Secretary of State very
strongly recommended the acceptance of the P. and
0. Company’s offer. It is important to state that
Australia contributes nothing to the subsidy. (See
Appendix 111. C.)
If the principle of subdivision were frankly ac-
cepted, the number of possible competitors would be
vastly increased, inasmuch as there might be not
only sectional contracts, but the same sections might
be worked by two or more companies sailing alter-
nately. It is indeed difficult to see why this
principle, if unreservedly extended to the Eastern
services, should not produce in greater degree the
results which its partial application to the Atlantic
and Cape mail services has already yielded. These
are —smaller subsidies, reduction of postages, and
development of private enterprise. It is now un-
necessary to give subsidies in order to secure trans-
ports when required. Recent experience suggests
that the most efficient and economical transports are
not supplied from the fleets of subsidized companies.
111. — The Australian Mail Service.
This service, although hitherto intimately asso-
ciated with the Eastern services, can be more
satisfactorily dealt with as a separate question.
The development of independent steam com-
munication with Australia has, on account of the
great distance, and from other causes, been slow.
The unsubsidized steam tonnage which left London
for Australia in 1876 was 27,363 register tons;


in 1877, 34,366 register tons; and in 1878,46,553
register tons.
For many years the freight charged on goods
carried to Australia by the P. and 0. Company
was 18/. per ton. It was reduced in 1878 to 9/.
per ton, and as soon as the Company felt assured
of the continuance of the Eastern mail service in
February last, they announced their readiness to carry
goods to Australia vid Bombay at 3/. per ton , the
rate by unsubsidized steamers being at the time 90s.
per ton. This is an appropriate illustration of one
of the uses to which excessive subsidies are applied.
Regular mail communication has been main-
tained with the Australian colonies by means of
the P. and 0. Company’s steamers since February,
1859. The route followed has been vid Galle—
with the exception of a short period in 1859, when
the steamers went vid Mauritius, The subsidies
granted to this Company have been—

vices annually .. 120,000

vices annually 130,000
These complete the contracts for which the Impe-
rial Government is responsible. The share of
expense undertaken by the colonies varied, but
under the latest of the above arrangements the
* The mileage rate of this contract would be misleading, as there was
a subsidy from Mauritius also.


Colonial Governments paid towards the cost of the
conveyance of the mails between this country
and Point de Galle a sum varying from 25,000/.
to 35,000/., according to the amount of correspon-
dence carried, in addition to a moiety of the expense
of the service between Point de Gralle and Sydney.
The total amount thus contributed by the Australian
colonies fell but little short of 100,000/. per annum.
Since February, 1873, the Home Government
has only undertaken to deliver the mails for the
Australasian Colonies at Galle, Singapore, and San
Francisco, leaving the various colonies to make
their own arrangements for transmission beyond
these points. For this service, and for collection and
distribution in England, the English Government
has charged the colonies the British inland rate of
Id. per letter only on the correspondence sent from
the United Kingdom, and the foreign transit rates
actually paid on correspondence sent or received
vid Brindisi, charging nothing for inward inland
postage, and nothing for the sea carriage between
this country and Galle and Singapore respectively,
and nothing for the sea and land carriage between
this country and San Francisco. (See Appendix I.)
The arrangements made by the Colonial Govern-
ments were as follow :
a. Victoria (South Australia and Western Aus-
tralia co-operating) contracted, on 31st December,
1873, with the P. and O. Company for convey-
ance of mails from Galle to Melbourne (calling at
King George’s Sound and Adelaide), for a term


ending Ist February, 1880, with an annual sub-
sidy of 90,000/. (mileage rate 14s. 4 \d.).
b. New South Wales and New Zealand contracted
with an American Company for conveyance of
mails to and from San Francisco, paying an annual
subsidy finally fixed at 72,500/. (mileage rate,
7s. 9 d.) .
c. Queensland entered into a separate contract
with the Eastern and Australian Company to carry
their mails to and from Singapore, for an annual
subsidy of 20,000/. (mileage rate, 3s. sc/.). This
contract has nearly expired, and tenders are now
being invited for a continuance of the service.
Each of these services is four-weekly.
In view of the expiration of the existing con-
tract in February next, the Victoria Government
advertised for tenders for a fortnightly service,
returnable early in 1878, but owing no doubt to
the stringency of the conditions imposed, and to
the uncertainty as to the disposal of the Eastern
contract, no tenders were received. The same
Government advertised again in the end of 1878
for tenders returnable on 12th February, 1879, on
two forms:—
Form A being for a through service from
Southampton or Plymouth to Melbourne
and back, via Suez Canal. Melbourne to
be the terminus, and mail steamers not to
call at or proceed to any other Australian
port. Service to be four-weekly.
Form B being for a hookiug-on service from


Aden or Colombo to Melbourne, calling at
Western Australia and South Australia,
and with liberty to proceed to any other
Australian port after delivering mails at
Melbourne. Service to be fortnightly or
four-weekly, at tenderer’s option.
In response to this advertisement, it is under-
stood that three communications were received.
First—One, under Form A, being a letter from the
Orient Steam Navigation Company expressing
readiness to contract for the service on less strin-
gent conditions than those advertised, especially
with regard to ports of call in Australia. Second
—One, under Form B, being a tender from the P.
and 0. Company for a fortnightly service between
Galle and Australia for 80,000£. per annum.*
Also, a communication from a third party, particu-
lars of which have not become publicly known.
A comparison of dates is necessary to a right
understanding of the significance of these responses
to the Victorian advertisement. The tenders, as has
been said, were lodged on 12th February, 1879. The
contract with the Imperial Government for Eastern
mail services was signed by Lord John Manners
on 7th February. The P. and 0. Company were
therefore aware that the Eastern services would
be continued in their hands, and were consequently
placed in an advantageous position for contracting
with the Victorian Government. That they should
be so placed seems to have been designed by the
* MUeage rate, ss. 83 d,


Imperial Government, as it appears from a minute
(see Blue Book) sent to the Post-Office from the
Colonial Office that the route via Galle was pre-
ferred on purpose to further this arrangement in
favour of the Australian colonies and the P. and 0.
Company.
In the minute referred to, Sir Michael Hicks
Beach expressed himself in favour of the P. and 0.
offer, adding that the P. and 0. Company’s system
“ supplies communication not only with the East,
but also with the Australian colonies, and that
when their contract with the Australian colonies
terminates there will he no guarantee that either
Mr. Holt or any other firm would be ready or able
to take it up, in which case these colonies would
again be exposed to the great inconvenience of an
imperfect connection with Europe, as well as with
India, China, and the East.” These remarks of
the Secretary of State for the Colonies completely
ignore the existence of the communications with
Australia vid San Francisco and Singapore already
mentioned, as well as the existence of the Orient
line of steamers, which for eighteen months had
been regularly running between Plymouth and
Australia at a higher rate of speed than the steamers
of the P. and 0. Company, and had during all that
time been carrying H.M. mails both ways without
a subsidy. The sailings of the Orient line were
at intervals of about six weeks in 1877, of about
a month in 1878, and are now four-weekly.
Reference ought also to be made to the Circular


Letter of 17th January last from the Colonial
Secretary to the various Australian Governments,
copy of which is hereto appended ( see Appendix /.).
The purport of this circular (which was handed
to the Agents-General of the Colonies in London)
was transmitted by telegraph to the Colonies,
and was known in London prior to the 12th
February. There is no doubt that the knowledge
of the contents of this circular had an important
bearing on the action of the Colonial Governments,
and on the action of probable competitors for the
Australian mail service. In so far as the circular
foreshadowed a new basis of agreement between the
Home and Colonial Governments, to be settled at a
conference, to be held some three or four months
later, as suggested in the closing paragraph, it
was calculated to deter probable competitors from
making definite offers at the date named by the
Victorian Government.
[Copy of a correspondence between the managers
of the Orient Steam Navigation Company and the
Colonial Office on this subject will be found in
Appendix //.]
On the other hand, its effect was to deter separate
action on the part of Colonial Governments. In
the circular, reference is made to a contemplated
additional line under the auspices of the South
Australian Government. It was well known that
the South Australian Government was negotiating
with the Orient Company, and it is evident that
the circular was likely—indeed, it seems to have


been intended—to put an end to all such inde-
pendent negotiation. Nor does the matter end
here. When united action between the Victorian
and South Australian Governments was secured,
and the P. and 0. Company’s tender was placed
firmly in the hands of the colonial negotiators, the
Imperial Government departed from the terms of
the Colonial Office Circular of 17th January, in
which it was proposed to charge the Colonies 4 d.
per letter, and consented to the Post-Office collecting
and distributing Australian letters, charging only
the inland postage (say Id per letter), surrendering
to Victoria all the additional postage levied, and
conveying the letters to and from Galle, free of
further charge to the Colonies. Upon this under-
standing the contract was finally closed between the
Victorian and South Australian Governments and
the P. and 0. Company for a fortnightly service
between Galle and Australia at an annual subsidy
of 80,000?. When to this is added the cost of
diverting the China mail service to Galle (see
page 19), it becomes evident that under the pro-
posed contract less than half the gross cost of
the Australian mail service will be borne by
Australia, which will nevertheless receive five-
sixths of the whole amount of the postages. (As
to nett cost, see Appendix HI. C.) This statement
takes no account of the carriage of Australian
mails over seas which must necessarily be traversed
by. steamers carrying Indian mails, but deals only
with the cost of sending Australian mails via Galle,


an unnecessary detour. The point at which India
and Australia should connect for mail purposes is
not Galle, but Aden. (See map.)
The most important part of Australian corre-
spondence is with England, not -India, and the
adoption of Aden or preferably Suez as the port
at which the contractors for the Australian mail
service should receive the Anglo-Australian mails
from and deliver them over to the representative
of H.M. Postmaster-General, would expedite the
delivery of English letters by two days. The
following extract, from the ‘ Times ’ of 24th May
last, has a direct bearing on this point, as the
‘John Elder’ came direct from Adelaide to Suez
vid Aden, avoiding Galle :
Steam Communication with Australia. —A remarkable instance
of the development of steam communication was given yesterday
morning in the delivery of advices from Australia bearing date Adelaide,
April 19. These were brought by the Orient Line steamer ‘ John Elder,’
and forwarded overland from Suez vid Brindisi, thus making the time
of transit of letters 34 days. The acceleration thus effected will be
better illustrated by the fact that the regular Peninsular and Oriental
Company’s mail, which left Adelaide also on the 19th of last month, is
not due in London until the 2nd prox.,or a difference of ten days. The
latter company’s mails have, however, been delivered on some occasions
lately two days before the contract time.
Nor would the delay of Indian correspondence
be important. There is telegraphic communication
between India and Australia, the trade between the
two countries is not great, and financial arrange-
ments are chiefly made through the medium of
English correspondents. The trade with China
is more important, but direct steamers and mail


packets to Singapore supply sufficient facilities.
Sir Michael Hicks Beach was then mistaken in
thinking that Australian interests would be served
by the adoption of the costly route to China vid
Galle. These interests would be better promoted
by the adoption of the sectional arrangements
advocated in this pamphlet. These may be sum-
marized as follows:
(1). The Mediterranean service, viz. that be-
tween Brindisi or Naples and Alexandria. This
ought to be a section by itself.
(2). The service between Suez and Bombay.
(3). That between Calcutta and Shanghai.
(4). That between Suez and Australia.
It would be found that there would be great
competition for these sectional services, if tenders
for each section were called for separately, and if
the system of alternate sailings, as practised in the
Atlantic and Cape mail services, were adopted, as
it is recommended should be done.
The detachment of the Mediterranean service
from the services eastward of Suez would alone
cause a great increase of competition, as owners of
steamers running between England and the East
vid Suez could undertake conveyance of mails
without being compelled to embark in a new and
totally distinct trade, namely that between Italy
and Egypt.
Conclusion'.
In connection with India and Australia alike, it
has been shown that the policy of the Government


favours one particular Company out of many;
that by insisting upon the whole area being
covered by one contract it restricts the number of
possible competitors; that there have grown up
vigorous independent steamship companies, with
which the favoured Company can compete only by
receiving ever increasing—instead of gradually
decreasing—subsidies, the public money being
applied to the covering of commercial losses. The
time may or may not yet have arrived when sub-
sidies can be dispensed with. The cost of main-
taining a regular service, with the necessary over-
lapping of steamers and impossibility of deviations
on the voyage, may or may not warrant the con-
tinuation of subsidies for the carrying of mails.
This is a question which can be settled only by free
and open competition. Our contention is that the
opening of the Canal has wholly changed the
character of the trade with the East; that the con-
ditions for ample competition now exist; that the
Government have failed to recognise these facts;
that they cling to antiquated routes; allot the
contract on irrelevant and erroneous considera-
tions ; and grant a subsidy which presses heavily
on the taxpayer. The sacrifice of the public
interest involved in the 1867 contract, and left
unredressed in the 1874 modification, will be
again imposed on the country by the 1879 con-
tract, and that for another long period of years,
unless Parliament interfere.


Circular Despatch from E.M. Secretary of State for the
Colonies to the Governors of the Australian Colonies.
APPENDIX I.
Downing Street,
January nth, 1879.
Sie, —Referring to my Circular Despatch of the Ist July
last respecting the proportion to be retained by H.M.
Government in England of the postage receipts on cor-
respondence passing between this country and the Aus-
tralasian Colonies, I have now the honour to inform you
that the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury have, at
my suggestion, consented to allow the existing arrange-
ments to continue until the Ist February, 1880, when the
Imperial contract with the P. and 0. Company expires,
so that during the interval the whole question of the
mail service between this country and the Colonies may
be fully discussed, and arrangements made as to the terms
upon which it is to be conducted in future. The con-
cession which is thus made in the interest of the Colonies
will, I feel satisfied, be fully appreciated by your Govern-
ment, and I trust that they will readily co-operate with
H.M. Government in the endeavour to arrive at a
satisfactory and permanent settlement of the whole
question.
I should remind you that before 1873 the cost of the
Australian service was divided equally between the
Colonies and the mother country, the Colonies, in con-
junction with India, paying their share of the service as


far as Point de Galle, and half of the cost of the service
between Ceylon and Sydney, which port was the terminus
of the P. and 0. Company’s steamers conveying the mails.
The various Colonies being dissatisfied with the manner in
which the P. and 0. Company performed the service
between Point de Galle and Sydney, the Imperial Post
Office, in deference to their representations, gave notice to
the Company to terminate the contract for such service,
and the contract consequently expired at the end of the
year 1872.
By a letter from the Treasury, dated 14th August,
1872, an offer was made through this otfice on the part
of the Imperial Government to convey the Australian
mails between this country and Point de Galle free of all
cost to the Colonies, and to contribute one-half of the
expense of a service once every four weeks between Point
de Galle and any port in the Colonies they themselves
might select, such contribution, however, to be limited
to 40,0001. a year, the Colonies in combination providing
their own packet service between Point de Galle and
Australia. It was also represented that the Imperial
Government would be disposed to contribute towards a
second service, provided it was alternative with the other,
i.e. that there should be sufficient interval between the
arrival or departure of the steamers for the purpose of
correspondence, and as the Treasury had been informed
that it was the intention of Queensland to establish a
line of packets between Brisbane and Singapore, via
Torres Straits, the Treasury letters also contained an
offer to convey the Queensland mails between England
and Singapore free of all charge, but expressly declined
on the part of the Imperial Government to contribute
towards the expense of the service between Singapore


and Queensland. This offer was followed by a conference
held at Melbourne between delegates from the different
Colonies, and the result of such conference was that,
owing to the rivalry of Victoria and New South Wales,
particularly with reference to the question as to whether
Melbourne or Sydney should be the post for the arrival
and departure of the mails, the Colonies were unable to
come to any unanimous conclusion. The offer made by
the Treasury, on the part of the Imperial Government,
therefore fell to the ground. Victoria, therefore, made a
contract itself with the P. and 0. for the conveyance of
mails between Point de Galle and Melbourne; Queens-
land, a contract for a service between Brisbane and Sin-
gapore; New South Wales and New Zealand, for one
with San Francisco; and the Treasury, on behalf of the
Imperial Government, agreed to carry the mails which
might go by the Galle and Melbourne route free of charge
between this country and Galle, those that might be sent
by the Singapore and Brisbane route free of charge
between England and Singapore, and those mails which
might be sent by the New South Wales, New Zealand, and
San Francisco route, free of charge between England and
San Francisco. The Treasury likewise agreed that, besides
having these mails carried free of charge between this
country and Point de Galle, Singapore, and San Fran-
cisco, the Colonies should, in consideration of their pro-
viding their own packet service between those ports and
Australia, &c., receive the whole of the postage on the
mails conveyed, excepting only the British inland rate
on the correspondence sent from the United Kingdom,
and the foreign transit rates paid by the Imperial Post
Office on such portion of the correspondence as might be
sent or received in the mails via Brindisi. It was, how-

ever, distinctly stipulated that so far as the Imperial
Government was concerned the arrangement above ad-
verted to should only last for a period of five years, which
has now expired.
The Treasury, in 1873, decidedly refused to entertain
the question of the extension of such arrangements beyond
such period, and it was clearly the intention of H.M.
Government at that time that the question of the division
of postage between the Imperial and Colonial Post Offices
should be considered before any fresh arrangements were
come to at the end of such five years. The offer made by
H.M. Government in 1872 contemplated only a service to
the Australian Colonies via Point de Galle, towards’ which
the Imperial Post Office would contribute; but that offer
fell through, owing to the differences of opinion as to the
terminal port entertained by Victoria and New South
Wales; and H.M. Government, in again approaching the
subject, are compelled to look upon the postal services
with the Australian Colonies, &c., as a whole ; for I have
to draw your attention to the fact that the Colonies, by
adopting separate services, have entailed upon the Imperial
Government a cost greatly in excess of what it would
otherwise have been called upon to provide. It appears,
from calculations made by direction of the Postmaster-
General, that under the present arrangement the charge
to the Imperial Government is as follows, viz.:—
The Lords of the Treasury are unable to approve of so
large an expenditure in future, feeling that it is more


than is required for the conveyance of the mails in an
efficient and adequate manner, and that this multiplicity
of services, and the consequently enhanced cost, does in
fact result from the inability of the Colonies to agree
amongst themselves upon any one route for the carriage
of these mails, and the time being at hand when the
existing arrangements would expire, their lordships did
not find themselves in a position to prolong those arrange-
ments, as desired by the Colony of Victoria, except upon
terms which would tend to relieve the Imperial Exchequer;
and they resolved, as a simple and fair proposal, that the
General Post Office should receive 4 d. on each letter
instead of the present inland postage. The proposal will
not be insisted on during the current year; but in opening
fresh negotiations on the mail service I must point out to
you that it is the duty of H.M. Government to deal
with the subject with due regard to the interests of the
British public, who are not concerned in the maintenance
of separate services for the convenience or pleasure of the
several colonies; and if it be desired to continue the
three services now in existence, viz. Melbourne, Galle;
Brisbane, Singapore; and Sydney, San Francisco; or even
to start an additional line, as appears to be contemplated
in South Australia, it is only reasonable that the cost of
maintaining them should be borne by the colonies and
not by the mother country, which has no voice in the
selection of these routes or in the contracts under which
they are worked. I have, therefore, to request you to lay
this despatch without delay before your ministers, and to
inform me whether any negotiations are in progress or
any arrangements made for the carriage of mails after the
Ist February, 1880, from the colony under your Govern-
ment, to any place on the homeward route; and I shall


be glad if the Agent-General for your colony, or some
other person, can be instructed and fully empowered to
conduct the subsequent negotiations upon the subject
with H.M. Government, and to conclude whatever agree-
ment may be arrived at.
I have the honour to be, Sir,
Your most obedient servant,

Copy of Correspondence between the Orient Steam Navigation
Company, Limited, and II.M. Secretary of State for the
Colonies.
APPENDIX 11.
Fenchueoh Avenue, London,
11 th March, 1879.
Sie, —We beg to inform you that the Orient Steam
Navigation Company, Limited, was formed twelve months
ago,* specially to meet the demand which was believed to
exist for a through service of full-powered steamships, to
place Australia, relatively to this country, on the same
footing of advantage as regards means of conveyance for
passengers of all classes, and mails, as is enjoyed, for
instance, by the United States of America.
The Orient Company refrained from tendering in abso-
lute terms in reply to a recent advertisement of the
Government of Victoria for a through service to Mel-
bourne only, because they knew that the amount of
subsidy which would be necessary to maintain the service
advertised for would be more than there was any chance
of the colony agreeing to pay; and because they understood
that until certain questions pending between the Imperial
Government and the colonies of Australia generally were
adjusted, no mail contract would be entered into.
Disquieting rumours have, however, lately reached some
of our proprietary, to the effect that notwithstanding nil
their preparations and their sacrifices to maintain their
line in the face of much discouragement from depression of
trade, there is a likelihood of their being passed over in
favour of some other company which has made no such
preparations or sacrifices.
Under these circumstances we. shall feel obliged if you
* The steamers had been running regularly for eight months when the

as rests with H.M. Colonial Office, and the Postmaster-

Gentlemen, —With reference to previous correspon-
dence respecting the wish of the Orient Steam Navigation
Company to tender for the conveyance of the Australian
mails, I am directed by the Secretary of State for the
Colonies to inform you that since that correspondence
took place Sir Michael Hicks Beach has learnt that Mr,
Graham Berry, the Premier of Victoria, who has been
recently in this country, has come to an arrangement to
accept a tender from the Peninsular and Oriental Steam
Navigation Company for a service via Galle, or Colombo,
to Melbourne. H.M. Government are not parties to this
contract, which, however, they deem a satisfactory one.

Your obedient servant,
(Signed) EOBEET G. W. HERBERT.
The Managers of the Orient Steam
Navigation Company, Limited.
5, Fenchubch Avenue, London, E. 0.,
4th June , 1879.
Sir, —We duly received your letter of the 14th ultimo,
in which you say, with reference to the contract negotiated
between Mr. Graham Berry, on behalf of the Government
of Victoria, and the Peninsular and Oriental Company,
that “ H.M. Government are not parties to that contract,
but they deem it a satisfactory one,”
We do not know what the point of view is from which
H.M, Government regard Mr. Berry’s contract with satis-
faction.
It is to be remembered that under that contract barely
one half of the sea distance between Australia and this
country is bridged over for postal purposes, the other half
of the service being provided for under the India and
China contract.
Mr. Berry’s contract can therefore, we submit, be pro-


perly judged only as part of the whole provision for the
carriage of Australian mails, whether at the cost of the
colonies or of the mother country.
Since we received your letter of the 14th ultimo, we
have devoted some time and trouble to an investigation
of the subject as a whole, and have arrived at the con-
clusion that the arrangements for the Australian mail
service, and the price contemplated to be paid, are not,
when regarded in this way, such as H.M, Government
could possibly deem satisfactory if all the facts and con-
siderations bearing upon the matter were present to their
minds.
Seeing that the subject is one which the nature of our
daily business specially qualifies us, in some respects, for
considering, we venture to think that you might be willing
to receive from us a statement, in as concise a form as
possible, showing the result of our investigation. We
shall be obliged by your saying whether we may send
you this.
We have only to add now that, however it may have
come about, we have had no real opportunity of com-
peting, although anxious to do so, and ready and able to
undertake the Australian service if allotted to us.

Gentlemen, —I am directed by the Secretary of State
for the Colonies to acknowledge the receipt of your letter
of the 4th inst., replying to the one from this Department
of the 14th May, respecting the contract into which Mr.
Graham Berry has entered on behalf of the Government
of Victoria with the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navi-
gation Company for a mail service between Ceylon and
Melbourne.
In reply I am to inform you that the statement that
the contract was deemed to be a satisfactory one was
merely made with reference to the fact that it provides
fortnightly communication with Australia in connection
with the India and China mail routes.
Sir Michael Hicks Beach cannot, however, express any
opinion or enter into any discussion upon the general
merits of the contract, which are matters for the con-
sideration of the Government of Victoria, but he would
have no objection to receive any observations which the
Company may wish to make with respect to mail com-
munication with Australia generally, if it is clearly under-
stood that he cannot entertain any objections to the action
which has been taken by the Government of Victoria in
regard to the conclusion of a contract with the Peninsular
and Oriental Steam Navigation Company.

Your obedient servant,

30th June, 1879.
Sir, —We beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of
the 14th inst.
Since writing you on the 4th inst., we have published
the result of our investigations into the Eastern Postal
arrangements in the form of a pamphlet. We trust you
will not consider that in enclosing, as we do a few (six)
copies of that publication, we are availing ourselves unduly
of your permission to submit our views on the subject.
We have tried to secure that the pamphlet contains no
expression which would render it unsuitable for submission
to H.M. Government in this way, and trust we have been
successful.
We are, Sir,
Your most obedient servants,
(Signed) ANDERSON, ANDERSON, & Co.,
