6€ lT IT Ho, Ho," murmured Teddy
II ll as he sat up in his bed and rubbed his eyes.
It was a bright,
clear morning. The wild-flowers were unfolding their petals in the warmth
of a beautiful Spring morning, and the birds among the trees were calling
to one another, glad to be alive on such a lovely day.
Teddy lived in the hollow at the foot of an old gum-tree. He had
forgotten to wind his alarm clock, and had slept later than usual and
wondered what the time was. He had promised to meet his friend Pretty
Pat at nine o'clock to help her gather
mushrooms, and Teddy hoped it was just
Five to Nine so he would have an excuse
for not washing himself.
Just then Johnny Kookaburra flew
by laughing "Ha, Ha, Ha," and as he
always said "Ha, Ha, Ha," at exactly
Eight O'clock, Teddy sighed deeply, and
climbed out of bed. Picking up a bucket
he filled it with water at the billabong
for his morning's wash. He went to a
cupboard for some soap which was on a
shelf alongside several pots of jam that
Pat had made for him.

Teddy thought it would be a good
time to count the pots, just to know
exactly how many he had left. He
counted them quickly and said "FIVE,"
and just to be quite sure, he counted
them again, this time very slowly, and
said "FOUR."
"That's funny," he said. "I'm
one
short."
He scratched his head with a sticky
wee paw:
"I thought I had five but I've only
got FOUR!"
So he decided to count them again, *
but before doing so, he thought a taste
of jam would do him Very Nicely. When
rp he had tasted it about three times, the
STfJw was ne &rly empty, and as it was not
a bit of use keeping the little bit that
ToVtvoyM
# was left, he finished it all up. Teddy
sighed contentedly and counted the pots
again. "ONE—TWO—THREE—that's
very strange," he said. "I can't even
make it FOUR now. Most mysterious
I must certainly go into this."
By this time it was nearly Nine
O'clock, and forgetting that he had not
washed himself, he hurried off to meet
Pat.
Although he enjoyed himself and
helped Pat to gather two baskets of
mushrooms, he could not keep his mind
off what he called "The Mystery of the
Jam-Pots." He was afraid to ask Pat,


-—" _ V jJ' I «L I
as she would have scolded him for eating a whole pot of jam before his
breakfast. So telling her that he had to meet his friend Tony the
Tortoise, he said "Goodbye" and hurried off home. Teddy opened the
cupboard and was very upset when he could only count THREE Full Pots.
He sat down to think it out, but it was no use. "I'll go and ask
Johnny Kookaburra," he said at last.
On the way, he called on Tony the Tortoise, and told him all about the
Mystery, and asked Tony to help him carry the pots.
"Why trouble Johnny Kookaburra if you know you've got THREE
pots?" asked Tony. Tony was a really lazy fellow and didn't want to walk
such a long way.
"Well," said Teddy, "I get a Different Answer every time I add them up.
Johnny is very wise. He wears spectacles. Besides, he can count right
up to TEN without using his fingers. He wrote me a letter last week and
said he would help me with sums."
"Alright," said Tony, "but I don't think it matters how many pots you
have."
"You would" said Teddy crossly, "if
they were YOUR pots."
DEA£ TED^V
Teddy fixed the pots securely in a
little cart which Pat had helped him to
make. "Gee Up, Tony," he said, and off
they went. On the way they met Hoppy
the Hare.
IF YOU HAVE ANY
SL/MS To Do
I tViu. HELP SOU.
"Good morning," said Hoppy. "Where
do you journey so early?"

"We have a Problem for Johnny
Kookaburra," said Teddy.
Page 4


"All right," said Tony, and, putting his head
inside his shell, was soon sound asleep.
"A what?" asked Hoppy.
"A Problem," said Teddy
and Tony together.
"Does he like them?"
asked Hoppy.
"Like what?" asked
Teddy.
"Goblins," replied Hoppy.
"Not Goblins," said Teddy
crossly. "Problems."
"Are they good to eat?"
asked Hoppy.
"No," replied Teddy. "IPs
a Sum."
"Oh," said Hoppy. "I see.
I'll run on and tell him
you're coming."
After a while Teddy began to think that a little taste of jam would
be Very Nice, so he said: "Tony, it's getting very hot. Wouldn't you like a
little nap?"
"I'm not a bit tired," said Tony.
"Tony!" said Teddy severely, "I once knew a tortoise not YOU
but Another Tortoise, who got so tired he fell down and Broke his Crown!"
"That's only a fairy story about Jack and Jill," replied Tony.
"You take my advice and have a little nap," said Teddy. "It will Do
You Good."


Teddy, Ever So Quickly, opened a pot, and before very long it was
Half Empty. He had just tied it up again when Tony woke up. "You look
very pleased, Teddy," he said. "You must have been thinking of your
Jam."
Teddy hid his sticky paw behind his back. "Yes, Tony," he said, "you
are Quite Right."
"Well," said Tony, "I think we'd better get going."
"Yes," said Teddy, "and Ido hope Kooka is home." After a long walk
they arrived at the tall gum-tree where Kooka lived. He was reading to two
little birds from a book: "How to Catch Grubs." Teddy took out a whistle
and blew it loudly. Kooka, seeing his new visitors, flew down and said,
"Good morning! Why the
honour of this visit? Are you
in trouble?"
"Yes," said Teddy and Tony
together.
"Both of you?" asked
Johnny suspiciously.
"No," said Teddy, "Only ME.
It's like this! I've got some
po^s Jam > but I really can't
make out How Many. It's a
PROBLEM. Will you help?"
Page 6


"Very well," said Johnny, putting on his Spectacles and a Very Severe
Look. "We'll count the pots with sticks. For each pot I'll give you a little
stick. See?"
"Yes," said Teddy doubtfully. "But if I give you the sticks back, may
I have the pots?"
"Of course," said Johnny. "Now take this stick." Teddy took it and
Johnny moved a pot away. He gave Teddy another stick and moved
another pot away. Then he gave Teddy a third stick and moved away the
last pot.
"Now, Teddy," he said, "how many sticks have you got?"
Teddy looked hard, and counted them twice. "THREE," he said at
last.
"Well," said Johnny, "that's the answer to the PROBLEM."
"Oh!" said Teddy, in a disappointed way. "You've counted sticks. I
think I can count sticks myself, but somehow I cannot manage Pots.
Please count the Pots, Johnny."
"I've done so," said Johnny quite sharply.
"No," said Teddy. "You counted Sticks. I've come a long way to see
you, Johnny," he added tearfully. "Please count the Pots."
Johnny felt sorry for being cross. "All right," he said, "let's start
again. Now, Teddy, put a stick on each pot."


Along," said Teddy.
Teddy did so.
"Now," said Johnny, "count the
Sticks."
"But I'm not interested in Sticks,"
pleaded Teddy. "I want to count the
Pots."
"Well," said Johnny, "count the
Sticks for a start."
Poor Teddy started all over again
and Johnny and Tony waited patiently.
At last Teddy finished.
"Well," said Johnny, "how many?"
"SIX," said Teddy confidently.
"Six what?"
"Sticks and Pots," said Teddy.
"But you don't count the Sticks,"
said Johnny.
"But you told me to," said Teddy, almost in tears, "although I said I
didn't want to."
"Well well well," said Johnny kindly. "Try another way."
"How?" asked Teddy.
"How many of us are there here?" asked Johnny.
"NINE," replied Teddy.
Nine what!" asked Johnny.
"Me, You, and Tony and Sticks and Pots," said Teddy.
"Never mind the Sticks," said Johnny.
"That's what I've been saying All

"Well, now look," said Johnny still Very Patiently. "You and Tony
each take a Pot and I'll take one. Now how many Pots have you got?"
"ONE," said Teddy.
"But you've got THREE," said Johnny.
"How can I, when you and Tony have each got One?"
Johnny gave a loud screech, dropped his Spectacles and flew off in
disgust. Tony crawled away and began nosing for grubs. Poor Teddy
was puzzled and was Tired of Counting Pots. He thought a little taste
of jam would be nice. Opening another Pot he soon felt Very Much
Better and called to Tony.
"Come on, Tony. I think we'll go home. Pat is Very Clever she will
soon count the Pots. lam Really Disappointed with Johnny Kookaburra.
Sums are all right as far as they go. But what's the use of going to all the
trouble of learning them if you can only count Sticks? You see, it's like
this:
"Sums seem to get me all in a fix,
But I'd willingly learn Lots and Lots
If instead of using them just to count Sticks
I could use them to add up my Pots."
"Did you think that up all
by yourself, Teddy?" asked Tony in
surprise.
"Well," said Teddy very modestly,
"it's quite easy, but you've got to
Know How."
"I'll make one up about you some
day, Tony. Perhaps on your birthday.
How old are you?"
"One hundred and four," said
Tony proudly.
«xr <<Don,t be sill y> Tony," said Teddy.
Nobody could count up to One
Hundred. Let alone a hundred and
four."


"I'm not silly," said Tony. "You can tell how old a Tortoise is by the
marks on its shell."
"What marks?" asked Teddy suspiciously.
"I don't quite know," said Tony, "I can't get my head round to see
them, but it must be right. Pat read all about it in a big book, and Big
Books know all about these things."
"Oh, well," replied Teddy, "if Pat told you so we won't argue. It's
about time we started off, anyway." Teddy tied on the remaining Pots and
they started off home.
"Let's take a short cut," said Teddy. "There's a Big Log over the
Creek."
"It's all Wet and Slippery," said Tony. "I don't like the Idea."
Soon they came to the Big Log and Tony stopped.
"Over you go," said Teddy.
"It doesn't seem too safe in fact," said Tony, "it looks Very Risky."
"You will be all right," said Teddy. "You just have to walk. I've got
the hardest job; you see, I have to guide you straight."
Page 10


"That's the trouble," replied Tony, "you mightn't."
They were still squabbling about it when a little furry head popped up.
It was Benny Bunny. Benny's whiskers were very long, and his tail was
white and fluffy. Benny had a little warm nest in a burrow hidden by
the long grass. He was very proud of his fluffy white tail.
"Hello, Teddy and Tony," he said. "You are doing a lot of talking.
In fact," he said crossly, "you woke me up."
Just then Squeaker the Squirrel poked his head through a hole in a
hollow tree.
"What's going on?" he said. "I've just put my babies to bed, and if
you wake them up there will be Trouble. Please go away. Oh, it's You,
Teddy," he said. "I might have known!"
"Known what?" asked Teddy.
"Well," said Squeaker, "whenever there's an Argument on, You're
bound to be in it."
"You're not very polite," said Teddy. "Anyway, it's Tony that's doing
all the arguing."
"What about?" asked Squeaker.
"Well, you see, it's this way," said Teddy. "I want Tony to cross the
Log, but he says it's Very Risky. Is it?"
Benny Bunny wiggled his long whiskers and said: "Certainly Not."


"Oh!" said Tony, "do YOU ever cross the log?"
"Yes," replied Benny.
"How often?" asked Teddy.
Benny thought for a moment then said: "Three
times a day, before and after meals."
"Benny," said Teddy severely, "we are not asking
you how often you take your Medicine. What do you
mean by Three times a day, before and after meals'?"
"Well," explained Benny, "it's this way. I live
on my side of the creek, but the grass is Very Nice and
Green on the other side. So Igo over there for my
meals, then I come back."
"I see," said Teddy very thoughtfully, "but why
don't you live on the other side? It would save you
a lot of running about."
Benny twitched his little pink nose. "I never
thought of that," he said.
"Let's see you go over," said Teddy.
"Certainly," said Benny. He gave a few leaps and bounds and
scampered over the log. He looked across at his astonished friends.
Teddy clapped his hands with joy. "Well done, Benny," he cried.
Tony only grunted.
Hearing all this noise going on, Croaker the Frog, who was in the
creek just near the log, popped out of the water. "What's the trouble?"
he asked. Teddy explained all about how he wanted to get to the other
side of the creek, and how Tony did not want to cross over on the log.
Page 12


"Why not swim?" asked Croaker.
"I can't swim," replied Teddy; "and besides there are the Pots.
Nobody could swim over the creek with Three Pots of Jam. Besides,
there's the cart and Tony and everything."
"Well," said Croaker, "I'll have a look at the log."
He had a look, then with three big hops he was safely over on the
other side.
"There you are, Tony," said Teddy, "you see how EASY it is. Over
we go."
"I'll try," said Tony, "but don't blame me if Something Dreadful
Happens." He carefully crawled on to the end of the log. It looked Very
Slippery and Tony stopped.
"Gee Up," said Teddy shaking the reins, "I'll guide you."
Tony began to move along, but the
log was covered with Green moss. He
had just got about half-way across
when he began to slip. He tried very
hard to keep from falling.
"Be careful!" yelled Teddy.
"Keep going!" called Benny.
"Stay where you are!" said Squeaker.
"Come back!" cried Croaker.


Poor Tony tried to do all these
things at once, but it was harder and
harder to keep from falling. All of
a sudden he lost his balance, and
toppled over. Poor Tony, Teddy, Pots
and All fell with a PLOP into the
water.
Teddy spluttered and splashed
and Benny the Bunny hopped around
in despair.
"Hold on to my tail, Teddy,"
yelled Tony. "We'll soon get out of
this."
Tony quickly swam ashore and
they scrambled up the bank, both
Very Wet and Out of Breath.
Teddy was very upset in more
ways than one, as he had lost his
Precious Pots of Jam. He sat down
and said:
"I'm cold and I'm Wet and I'm
Ever So Sad,
I've lost the Two Pots of Jam
that I Had."
Page 14


"Never mind," said Tony, "we'll
gather some blackberries and Pat will
make you a Lot More."
This cheered Teddy up very much
until he began to Sneeze and Shiver
and could scarcely walk.
They arrived home at last and
Teddy sat All Huddled Up. He said
to Tony:
"I think that I've caught a most
terrible cold;
Do you think that Pat will come
over and scold?"
Tony Didn't Think So, but asked
Benny Bunny to hurry off and let
Pat know all about the Pots and the Creek and Everything. As
soon as she heard the news, Pat came hurrying over with All Sorts
of Things. She did not scold Teddy a bit, but made him put his feet
in Mustard and Water, sent him to bed, and gave him some Nasty
Medicine.


She kept him in bed for some days and made him learn his
A.B.C. and to count right up to TEN without using his fingers. Tony,
Hoppy the Hare, and Benny Bunny gathered blackberries and Pat
made quite a lot of Jam.
This news cheered Teddy Very Much. From his bed he could look
into his cupboard, and it seemed very bare with Not One pot
of Jam on the shelves. He was always wondering just how long it
would be before the cupboard would be Quite Full.
He thought to himself:
"IPs a Very Sad Thing and really not fair
To live in a room with a cupboard that's bare."
On the third day, Pat visited Teddy carrying a Big Basket, and
Teddy's eyes grew quite round
w : ln Surprise.
"Teddy," said Pat, "I've
made you quite a lot of jam.
If you can count the Pots
correctly, you may have them."
She put them out on to
the table and Tedly counted
them Quite Quickly.
"TEN," he said excitedly.
"Splendid," said Pat. "You
may put them in your cupboard.
It was really worth while falling
in the Creek if it has Taught
you to Count Properly."
Teddy looked very thought-
ful, and at last said:
"I'm not so sure I agree
with all THAT,
But it's certainly right if
YOU say so, Pat."
