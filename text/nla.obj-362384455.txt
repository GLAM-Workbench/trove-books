Office of Public Works,

13th Abril 1864.
Mr. Cecil Darley served his time for Three years as my Pupil in the Engineering
profession, during which time he was constantly engaged in laying out works, preparing working-
plans, and in superintending works in course of construction on lines of Railway under my
charge, &c., &c. He knows his business well, and I never have had a Pupil who gave me greater
satisfaction. He was always most attentive to his duties, steady and zealous in the discharge
of them, and ever active and intelligent, and whatever was given him to do he did well. Since
I retired from the profession he has been in the office of Messrs. Cotton & Elemyng, who
succeeded to most of my business here, and I know from them that they have the same high
opinion of him that I have. If I was still at the profession there is no assistant I would
more gladly employ, and I feel not the slightest doubt that wherever he may be engaged he
will give the same satisfaction that he has ever given to me.
