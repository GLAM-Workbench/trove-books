HANDS
OFF
GREECE
* A truce has been signed in
Greece, but at any moment British
reactionaries may resume their
attacks on the Greek patriots.
♦ It is therefore up to every Australian to
insist at once on the grant of Peace and Full
Democracy to this gallant Ally.


Here are the facts
Greece is our Ally, not our enemy, in this war.
Her soldiers fought gallantly against the Italian invasion in
1940 and, alongside Australians, against the German invasion
in 1941.
Her King (George II.) and her Allies evacuated her territory
in April, 1941.
BUT THE GREEK PEOPLE STAYED BEHIND. THEY
ORGANISED RESISTANCE TO THE GERMANS IN THE
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT CALLED BY THE
INITIALS E.A.M.
THIS LIBERATION FRONT, WHICH INCLUDES REPRE-
SENTATIVES OF ALL DEMOCRATIC PARTIES, FORMED A
GUERILLA ARMY KNOWN AS E.L.A.S.
This army of patriots liberated Greece from the Germans.
When the British returned to Greece, bringing with them the
emigre Greek Government formed in Cairo, less than 300
lives were lost fighting against the Germans.
This Government brought with it a hand-picked Royalist Greek
Army, determined to restore King George.
THE BRITISH COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, GENERAL SCOBIE,
INSISTED THAT THE DEMOCRATIC GUERILLA FORCES
SHOULD LAY DOWN THEIR ARMS, WHILE THE ROYAL-
IST ARMY AND THE QUISLING ATHENS POLICE KEPT
THEIRS.
When this was refused, Scobie and the Greek reactionaries
attacked ELAS with tanks, guns, planes, armored cars and
every other weapon at their disposal.


THEY TELL YOU
that E.A.M. is an "armed minority" trying to dictate to
Greece.
IN FACT
E.A.M., like all the other Resistance Movements in Europe,
unites all the democratic, anti-Fascist Parties. It includes
Communists, Socialists, Liberals, and even some Monarchists.
Its leaders include some Regular Army Generals and two
Bishops.
THEY TELL YOU
that "Prime Minister" Plastiras is a Liberal.
IN FACT
Plastiras was a Whiteguard interventionist in the Ukraine
after the last war. He was exiled from Greece for having
twice made himself a dictator.
He had lived in France since 1933. The British brought him
back to Athens without any Greek voice being raised for his
recall. He is charged with being a Nazi collaborator.
He represents nobody but himself.
THEY TELL YOU
that Greek "trade unionists" have thanked Scobie for
"liberating" Athens.
IN FACT
the only "trade unionist" mentioned by name so far was a
Fascist Labor Front Official. The Greek General Confedera-
tion of Labor is affiliated to E.A.M.
Professor Harold Laski, Chairman of the British Labor Party
says;
"1 say with emphasis, that the appearance of a number of
phoney trade union leaders thanking Mr. keeper (British
Ambassador in Athens) or a number of dubious parties,
produced like rabbits out of a hat, aren't going to win British
Labor's support." _


THE WORLD LABOR MOVEMENT
SUPPORTS GREECE
Resolutions condemning the suppression of democracy in
Greece have been passed by every section of the British Labor
Movement, including the Labor Party, National Executive,
and the Communist Party Central Committee.
Workers' protests have poured into London from the U.S.A.,
Canada, South Africa, New Zealand and Australia.
The N.S.W. Trades and Labor Council, several other Labor
Councils and a number of trades unions and factory meet-
ings in Australia have sent protests to Churchill.
SOLDIERS 1 PROTEST
In a letter to the Australian External Affairs Minister, Dr.
Evatt. 160 Ninth Division Diggers asked the Australian Gov-
ernment to urge Churchill to stop intervention in Greece, as
did many other Australian soldiers who fought alongside the
Greeks in 1941,
GREECE DEMANDS
♦ A plebiscite on the Monarchy.
♦ A free election.
♦ Disbanding of the Royalist and quisling police and
Army.
♦ Her right, under the Atlantic Charter, to settle her
own affairs without interference from Britain.
THESE DEMANDS ARE JUST! SUPPORT THEM BY WIR-
ING OR WRITING YOUR SUPPORT OF THEM TO
CHURCHILL AND CURTIN! DEMAND FAIR PLAY FOR
GREECE!
