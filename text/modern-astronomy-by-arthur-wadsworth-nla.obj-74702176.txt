REASONS Why You should Support the ::
Australian Catholic Truth Society.
1. Because it is started as a crusade for God against irre-
ligion, immorality, and ignorance.
2. Because it will supply bright, healthy reading matter
for all classes, Catholic or non-Catholic, at a price
within the reach of all.
3. Because nothing of real human interest in the wide
field of truth is beyond its scope, whether in
religion, science, history, philosophy, or fiction.
4. Because it will, from time to time, refute current
popular errors about the Faith or the Church, and
will defend religion from the attacks of its foes.

MODERN ASTRONOMY
UAMWj|ONG before mankind attempted any philosophy to
|MS explain the world around him, the motions of the
| jpl heavenly bodies impressed themselves upon him.
fed Night and day were the two fundamental facts of
his experience; the changes of the seasons were almost
as insistent in demanding his attention, and an adaptation
of his habits to them; while the silent, ceaseless motion of
the starry sphere, the wanderings and changes of the moon
and the strange advances and retrogressions of the planets
almost compelled him to frame some theory to account
for them. Sometimes the terrifying eclipse, or the awful
menace of a huge comet, would fill him with superstitious
terrors ; and so inevitably did all these phenomena inspne
him that the origin of almost all mythologies may be found
in them. How beautiful are the Greek fables of Aurora
arising with her team
? Who love her, yearning for her yoke,?
opening with her rosy fingers the gates of the east; or of
Persephone in the myth of spring, who gathering flowers on
the plains of Enna,
? Herself a fairer flower, by gloomy Dis,
Was gathered, which cost Ceres all that pain
To seek her through the world.?
But men lived on the earth for many thousands oi yeais
before they framed an adequate explanation of the motions
of the heavenly bodies. And the wonder is not that they


were so long, but that ever they did it at all. The earth
to us ah', accustomed as we are to the idea of its eternal
motion, seems the very embodiment of rest and stability.
We know that it is revolving at a rate which carries a
spot on the equator a thousand miles in an hour; we know
it is rushing round the sun 19 miles a second;- but still
it seems to us that it is the centre and the most stable of
all things. The Inquisition was quite wrong, we all know
now, in telling Galileo that he and Copernicus were teaching
error; but its argument that if we were moving round the
sun, at a very rapid rate, then the stars should, as the
result of perspective, open out in front of us, and close up
behind us, was quite unanswerable, except by the assertion
that, though the sun was certainty very far away, its dis-
tance was as nothing compared to the stars. This, we now
are aware, is the ease; but there was very little reason to
assume it then. But the complications of the Ptolemaic
system soon brought about its downfall, and modern astron-
omy owes very much to some of the spiritual descendants
of Galileo's judges.
To us, by far the most important of the heavenly bodies
is the sun, the dispenser of that light and heat without
which our earth Avould be but a dead cinder, lost in infinite
space. And as Ur. Wallace has recently impressed upon us,
the stores of his heat are poured out at a rate that has
been practically constant since the world began. This very
fact, so opposed to our general' experience, which is that
very hot bodies parting with their heat must rapidly grow
cold, is most striking. Like Moses? bush, the sun burns
and is not consumed. And the quantities of heat poured
out by him are inconceivably vast. The whole earth is
warmed and sustained by less than one two-thousand-mil-
lionth part of the energy which he is now, and for hundreds
of millions of years has been, lavishing into space. The
boundless prodigality of nature, which covers an oak with
acorns, of which, perhaps, not one will ever grow into a tree;
which causes the herring to lay 50,000 eggs, of which not
one in ten thousand survive, is nowhere more evident than
in astronomy. Only an infinitesimal portion of the radiant
energy of the stars can ever, to our perception, be anything
but wasted; the rest, if Divine wisdom so willed, could sus-


tain for ages of ages the systems which ever so slowly, but
even as surely, are running down, like a watch which indeed
is wound, but whose key is hopelessly lost. Nay, we have
strong reasons, as will be seen later, for believing that
many suns, once bright, and perhaps sustaining life on sys-
tems of planets, have at last spent all their stores, and
wander through space, dark and dead. But although we
know our sun is not in his first youth, he is by no means
near his old age, and the question of his ultimate extinction
need not trouble us very much.
What is the reason- that the sun?s light and heat are so
remarkably constant? It is generally supposed that,
according to the theory which bears the name of Laplace, the
great French mathematician, the solar system was once a
vast nebula, and that, on contracting, it shed off matter
which ultimately concentrated into smaller globes rotating
round the central mass, and so at last we have the sun,
surrounded by his family of wheeling planets. It is im-
possible to deny that there are facts, such as the motion of
the satellites of Uranus and Neptune, in a direction con-
trary to the other members of the system not accounted
for by this theory, and there are far graver mathematical
and dynamical objections to its very possibility. But how-
ever this may be, we may safely assume that the sun, at
the time when the earliest sedimentary rocks (the Lauren-
tian) were foi?ined, was much more diffuse than he is at
present; that with the same mass he filled a much greater
extent of space. Now an elementary acquaintance with
natural philosophy tells us that there is an energy of posi-
tion known as potential energy ; the water at the head of a
fall is no hotter than that at the bottom, but in falling wo
may make it do work, and, by suitable appliances, generate
light and heat. This is doubtless the main source of the
sun?s energy. His gravitative power is 31 times that of
the earth, and, therefore, the energy generated by a certain
mass falling a certain distance towards his centre is vastly
greater than in the case of the earth. It is a matter of
mathematical demonstration that a contraction of the sun's
bulk of 28(5 feet a year would be sufficient to maintain the
prodigious expenditure of light and heat he is constantly
emitting. And it is probable that there are other supplies


??meteoritic swarms must be dense in his vicinity, and as
we know, their rush through our air makes them incan-
descent. But near the sun their velocity would be anything
from ten to twenty times as great as those near us, and
the amount of energy liberated by their rush into his atmos-
phere from a hundred to four hundred times more. A
contraction of the sun?s body by less than a hundred yards
a year would have to go on for two or three centuries,
even if his edge or ? limb ? were a clearly defined line,
before it would be perceptible to us with our most sensitive
instruments, and they, in the hands of a skilled observer,
will readily measure an angle no larger than that subtended
by the opposite sides of a half-penny at a distance of 40
miles.
Of course, if the sun contracts he cannot be a rigid body,
as is the earth. And he is not. He is a vast mass.
850,000 miles in diameter, of glowing gas, forced by its own
immense gravitational power into a condition not liquid,
and yet not gaseous, as we understand it. It is a condition
Ave cannot reproduce on earth, and we need not be astonished
if many things happen on the sun which we cannot explain.
We know that he rotates on his axis in about 25 days,
though the absence of any fixed point in the inconceivable
inferno of his surface, together with the startling fact that
his equatorial regions rotate more quickly than his higher
latitudes, make it impossible to say there is an exact period.
Of course, any detailed description of the sun would require
a treatise, and it is enough to say here that, though on
account of the effects of refraction in the varying strata of
the sun?s atmosphere it is hard to say exactly what goes
on, we know that the visible surface of the sun, called the
photosphere, is the source of light and heat. This is torn
by the turmoil of the convection currents bringing up sup-
plies of more light and heat from the unimaginable furnace
below. Next to this dazzling surface is a shallow, veil-like
coverino', which, fortunately for our comfort, absorbs a gfeat
deal of^the solar radiation. Then is the reversing layer,
some hundreds of miles in thickness, ?omposed of the
vapours of many elements, which is the principal souice of
the dark lines in the spectrum. During a total eclipse,
when the sun?s whole disc is just covered, these lines, which


are only dark by contrast with their brilliant background,
Hash out for a few seconds into bright lines, Avhieh are the
characteristie mark of incandescent gases. This, in Miss
C'lerke?s words, is overlaid to a depth of four or five thous-
and miles by the chromosphere, a gaseous ocean, incarna-
dined by the crimson blaze of hydrogen. The irregulari-
ties of its outline develop, locally and temporarily, into pro-
minences, often of gigantic size, but belonging to the chro-
mosphere as essentially as mounting wave� and tossed spray
do to the ocean. Finally, we reach the far-spreading
corona, a mere lustrous phantom, approaching the absolute
zero of density, yet of astounding decorative effect during
total eclipses.??
Everyone knows in a vague way that the instrument by
which we are able to tell the composition of the vapours
surrounding the sun and stars is called the spectroscope,
but it is necessary, for a clear understanding of all the spec-
troscope teaches us, to know what it is and what it does.
Its essential part is a prism, or train of prisms, or often,
nowadays, a metal ? grating,? ruled with a machine which
is a marvel of mechanical skill, with lines of which there
may be 50,000 to the inch. We will here only consider the
prismatic spectroscope. In front of the prism, or the first
prism, in a train, is a slit, which may, by screws, be narrowed
or widened. A lens causes an image of the slit to fall on
the prism, which refracts whatever light comes through the
slit. White light, asi Newton discovered, is composed of all
the colours of the rainbow, from dull red to violet. The
rainbow itself, of course, is the white light of the sun, split)
up by refraction and reflection in drops of water. It
must always be borne in mind that colour in ? itself is a
subjective phenomenon, and ha,si no existence as such outside
our minds. If we allow the light of the sun to fall on
the slit, it passes through the lens, and thence to the prisms.
Passing through these, it is lengthened out into a multi-
coloured band, which is really an indefinite number of images
of the slit, that may be further magnified by a telescope.
But the visible radiations from such a body as the sun are
only a small part of the total. Just as there are waves
of sound too deep, vibrations are too slow, to affect
pur ears, and others of too high a pitch for us to hear,


so there are waves precisely like those of light both below
the red and above the violet, but to whose vibrations our
eyes do not respond. But the photographic plate, and a
wonderfully sensitive instrument, called the bolometer, have
lemedied this, and we now have maps of the spectrum many
times longer than the part visible to our eyes.
If Newton had allowed sunlight to fall through a slit,
instead of a circular hole, he would probably have made a
discovery that had to wait for a century and a half, and
that was that some of the tints in the long series of colours
in the spectrum were missing. Fraunhofer, early last cen-
tury, noticed dark lines across the spectrum, and with every
refinement of the spectroscope these lines became more nume-
rous. It was also discovered that certain elements, heated
till they became incandescent gases by the electric spark,
gave out, not a continuous spectrum, but bright lines, and
always the same bright lines. Sodium, for instance, the
base of common salt, gives out, among others, two very
conspicuous yellow lines. In a place l in the solar spectrum
in the yellow', exactly corresponding to these two bright
lines, were two dark lines, called the D lines. But when
the bright lines and the solar spectrum were brought into
the same spectroscope, the blackness of the D lines was not
softened, but intensified, and soon it was proved that everv
vapour absorbs the same rays that it emits. This explains
the phenomenon of the reversing layer just referred to.
The vapours of the chromosphere absorb certain of the tints
of the white light of the photosphere, but when this light is
cut off by the dark body of the moon, they flash out into
the corresponding bright lines, being only dark by contrast
with the dazzling light below'. We know of more than
three dozen elements in the sun, the most important being
hydrogen, iron, carbon, magnesium, sodium and calcium.
It is also fairly certain now that oxygen is a solar constitu-
ent. Helium is remarkable, because it was known as a solar
element from 1868, through a line in the yellow', which was
produced by no knowm element in the laboratory. But in
1895 helium was discovered in the Swedish mineral clevite,
and, since, has been found to be given off in the mysterious
emanations proceeding from radium. In the spectra of
nebulae is also an unknown line, attributed to a, hypothe-


tiuai element, called nebulium, which we probably shall
never hud on earth.
Sun spots, with their dark, central umbra, and the sur-
rounding penumbra, have been known since ? through optic
glass the Tuscan artist? viewed them. What they are,
we are not very sure to-day. They have a period attaining
a maximum about every 11 years, and we know they are
connected with vast disturbances reaching far into the body
of the sun. But we do not even know r whether they are
projections or depressions. They are of enormous size.
One, in 1858, had a diameter of 143,500 miles; another, in
1892, covered an area of nearly three thousand million square
miles. It isi probable that there is no darkening of the
sun?s surface where we see a spot, but that there is an
accumulation of absorbing material ?probably matter cooled
in some way?which cuts off the light that would otherwise
reach us. They are surrounded by faculae, which are pro-
jections from the photosphere, and are, indeed, scattered all
over the globe, while spots are rarely seen in higher solar
latitudes than 30deg., and never higher than 50deg., their
mean positions being about 15deg. of north and south lati-
tude. There is a well-ascertained, though unexplained,
connection between sun spots and terrestrial magnetism, and
in October, 1903, the presence of a huge spot was accom-
panied by vivid auroras, seen widely throughout both hemis-
pheres, and an intense magnetic storm, which for some hours
cut Paris off from electric communication with the rest of the
world.
The dimensions of the sun are easily expressed in figures,
but it is impossible to grasp them in the mind. If he were
hollow, and the earth placed in his centre, the moon could
still go round the earth without touching his surface, even
were she removed from us more than half as far again than
she is. It would take a million and a quarter globes like
the earth to form one as big as the sun, and 324,000 to
make one of equal mass. It takes us a mouth to travel
from Melbourne to London. A journey between corres-
ponding points on a globe the size of the sun would occupy
nine years. And his distance from us is stupendous, though
quite insignificant compared with the vast abysses which
divide us from the starry hosts. It, of course, varies a


little, as the earth?s orbit is an ellipse, not a perfect circle,
but the mean may be taken as about 92,800,000 miles. This
is the fundamental unit from which are calculated all
astronomical distances. There is, as Kepler discovered, a
definite relation between the distance of a planet from its
primary and its period of revolution, the cube of the dis-
tance equalling the square of its period. Thus, taking the
earth?s distance and period as unity, Jupiter?s period is
11.87 times that of the earth, and his distance 5.2 times,
and 11.87 squared equals 5.2 cubed. So we can always
draw a map of the solar system exactly to scale, and if we
know the distance between the sun and any one planet, or
between the orbits of any two planets, w r e can tell exactly
the dimensions of the whole system. This is why expedi-
tions have been sent all over the world to observe transits
of Venus, why so much attention was paid to Mars at his
favourable opposition of 1877, and why the strange little
asteroid, Eros, which also approaches us so closely, is
important. And the mightier problem of measuring the
distances of the stars depends on the accuracy of our mea-
surements of the solar distance, for it is the base line of
our celestial triangulation, and any error in it is multiplied
hundreds of thousands of times in working out the results
of those marvellously delicate operations.
In the orderly rotation of the sun?s family of planets
round him ; in the wondeful adjustments by which, in spite
of the incessant perturbations of each by other, an indefin-
itely permanent stability is attained, and in the complex
arrangements never clashing into discord, by which life is
made possible throughout long aeons on this world, we see,
surely, omnipotent design working in infinity and eternity,
ohne hast, ohne rast.?
? To rear it was the task of power divine,
Supremest wisdom, and primaeval love.?
The planets may be divided into two groups, the larger
and the smaller, separated by the belt of asteroids, of which
about 400 are now known to us. The smaller group com-
prises Mercury, Venus, the earth, and Mars, and is the
nearer to the sun, which, on the nebular hypothesis, may be
accounted for by assuming that the proximity of the sun s


great bulk prerented any such aggregations of matter as
would be likely to occur in regions where his attractive
energy was weaker. The earth is the largest of this group,
and the only one with a serviceable satellite. Mars has
two tiny moons, but they are little globes only a few miles
in diameter. Of Mercury and Venus, we know but little.
Being inside our path round the sun, they are not favourably
situated for observation. Mercury is never more than 28
degrees from the sun ; and Venus, though next to the moon,
our nearest neighbour in space, has a surface of such dazzling
brilliancy that we do not even know her period of rota-
tion. It is probable that her real .surface is covered with
clouds, and that the periods of rotation on their axis of
both Venus and Mercury is the same as that of their revolu-
tion round the sun; that is, that they for ever turn the
same face to him as does the moon to the earth. If this
be so, one hemisphere of these planets is perpetually exposed
to a radiation from the sun,' varying in the case of Mercury,
owing to his eccentricity, from five to nine times what we
receive, and in the case of Venus about twice the amount,
while the other is plunged in perpetual frost and night.
Mars is a globe of very great interest to us, because, while
its orbit is at an average distance of nearly 50 millions of
miles, it may occur, owdng to its marked eccentricity, that,
if he happens to be at his perihelion, or nearest approach to
the sun, while in opposition?i.e., so that a line from the sun
to the earth continued to his orbit passes near his position
?he will only be about 34 millions of miles from us, and
with the fine instruments of to-day, markings may be
observed on his surface which have been assumed to be
land and water. And when it is winter in either hemis-
phere, that pole will have a white cap, presumably snow,
though that supposition, it must be remembered, does not
exhaust the possibilities. It has been suggested, for
instance, that these polar caps are solidified carbon dioxide
- -carbonic acid gas. And as the presence of vapour of any
sort implies an atmosphere, and as we know Mars revolves
on his axis in a little more than 24 hours, many have sup-
posed he is inhabited. Certain mysterious straight lines
connecting the ? seas ? on his surface have been seen, and
the suggestion thrown out that they are canals for irrigation


purposes, made by beings whose engineering skill- vastly
transcends ours. For no work of man could be visible with
our best telescopes at a distance of 35. millions of miles.
He would be a bold man who declared that Mars could not
be inhabited. Before the cruise of the ? Challenger ?in
the early seventies, it would have seemed unlikely that
there could be living creatures in the cold and darkness, and
under the awful pressures of the great depths of the sea.
let we know now there is life there, and the conditions on
Mars? surface are not more dissimilar from those on the
earth?s than are the ocean abysses. Stilt, life on Mars
would be very different to life here. For the atmosphere,
owing to his smaller gravitative energy, would be much thin-
ner. Only one-half of the heat we receive from the sun
reaches him at his nearest, and if there are really seas on
his surface, their area is only about equal to that of the
land. So, with one-third the relative area of ocean, and
half the solar energy, the rainfall must be insignificant. In
addition, owing to the great eccentricity of his orbit, he
receives at aphelion only a little more than one-half the heat
that reaches him at perihelion, so the vicissitudes of tempera-
ture must be extreme. It is unlikely that the average tem-
perature on Mars is much above freezing point, and it is
hard to see how life, of which it seems to us water must
be a most essential constituent, can flourish there. The
marvellous canals, it is quite possible, are an optical delu-
sion, created by tired eyes. So we can only say Mars may
be inhabited, but neither its vegetable nor animal life can
be at all like that known to us.
Passing outwards from the sun past Mars, through
? The lucid interspace of world and world,
Where never creeps a cloud, or moves a wind,
Nor ever falls the least white star of snow,
Nor ever lowest roll of thunder moans,
Nor sound of human sorrow mounts to mar
The sacred everlasting calm.?
we come to the asteroids, tiny little planets, yet each ful-
filling its appointed path as truly as the great Jupiter behind
them. It has been supposed these hundreds of plane-
toids are but a larger ? planet spoiled in the making ?by
the mighty attraction of their huge neighbour. There is


little remarkable about them in themselves, except that
some of them have orbits very much inclined to the ecliptic,
and further discoveries excite but little attention.
Beyond these lie the four giant planets?Jupiter, whose
diameter is ten times that of the earth : Saturn, with his
unique ring system ; the dim and remote Uranus ; and the
stili more lonely Neptune, so far as we know, the outpost
of our system. Jupiter has five moons, four discovered by
the starry Galileo ? in January, 1610, after he had acquired
some skill in the making of telescopes, and a fifth, of very
small size, completing a revolution round Jupiter in a little
under 12 hours, first seen in 1892. It is? not at all
probable that we see Jupiter's real surface. His
enormous bulk whirls round on its axis in less than
ten hours, and a result of this is that vapour ejected from
the slower-moving regions nearer his centre fall behind
at his apparent surface, and form a series of belts. Spots
appear on, or, perhaps, under, these belts, which may per-
sist for years. Of Jupiter?s real conditions we know very
little, except that he is almost certainly very hot. Not
approaching solar temperature, but still so hot that water
cannot remain on his surface. Saturn, to the unaided eye
dull and heavy, is in the telescope one of the most beautiful
objects in the sky. His large family of moons, and his mar-
vellous system of rings, together with beautifully tinted
equatorial belts, like those of Jupiter, form a unique and un-
forgettable picture. Saturn himself is about 70,000 miles
in diameter, while the ring system has a diameter of 176,000
miles from outside edge to outside edge, through the planet?s
centre. It is about 37,600 miles from outside to inside
edge. Mathematical investigation has proved that for the
ring system to be stable, it must be neither solid nor liquid,
but must be composed of millions of millions of fragments,
meteorites in fact, each pursuing its own path. It may
be mentioned that Titan, one of Saturn?s moons, is the larg-
est secondary planet in our system, and is equal in bulk to
Mars.
Uranus and Neptune, the one 1800 and the other 2750
millions of miles from the sun, are too remote for us to
be able to learn much detail about them. But the wonder-
ful discovery of Neptune, by Leverrier and Adams, through


calculations based upon certain deviations of Uranus from
its calculated path, was, perhaps, the greatest triumph of
analytical astronomy.
Before we leave our system and sweep away " through
wildernesses of death that divide the worlds of life ? to
the realms of the so-called ? fixed ? stars, it would be well
if we understood how men, imprisoned in this little world,
have, with some approach to accuracy, measured the awful
distances that separate our sun from, his neighbours. An
elementary knowledge of trigonometry teaches us that,
given the length of a base line, and the two angles at each
end of it, the length of the two other sides of the triangle
can be calculated. Our base line is the earth?s path round
the sun. If a position of a star is observed in January,
then in July the earth will be 185,000,000 miles away at
the other side of the sun, and another observation may be
taken. We have now r our base line and. two angles. But
the difference in nearly all cases between these angles and
two right angles ?i.e., the departure of the two lines to
the star from absolute parallelism ?is imperceptible,
because the distance of the star so enormously exceeds the
diameter of the earth?s orbit, huge though that is. If
you gave a surveyor a base line of one foot, and asked him
to measure therefrom the distance of a mountain peak
visible about 50 miles away, he would tell you the request
was absurd. Yet an astronomer would be glad indeed to
get a base line as large in proportion as this to measure
star distances. The nearest star to the earth, Alpha C'en-
tauri, is about a quarter of a million times as far distant
from us as is the sun. Light travels at the rate of
186,000 miles a second. It would go round the world in
the seventh of a second. It takes eight minutes to reach us
from the sun, four hours from Neptune, but four years and
four months to come to us from the neaiest fixed stai.
We shall see that even this awful depth of space sinks into
insignificance compared with others we shall have to con-
sider, and the Psalmist?s words will strike us with a pro-
founder meaning than even he knew r * Quoniam videbo
caelos tuos, opera digitorum tuorum ; lunam et Stellas
quae tu fundasti. Quid est homo, quod memor es ejus?
aut filius hominis, quoniam visitas eum?


Comte, the founder of the positive philosophy, advised
the astronomers of his day only to study the solar system,
as the vast spaces which separate us from the stars made
it hopeless to learn anything about them. And had not
the spectroscope been invented we would know very little.
But that marvellous instrument tells us not only tlie com-
position of the stars, and a great deal about their physical
condition, it tells us at once what we could never know
otherwise ?their motion to or from us in the line of sight.
For as the position of a line in the spectrum represents a
certain wave-length of light, just as the pitch of a musical
note represents a certain number of vibrations in the air,
it is evident that if a star is moving rapidly to us, a larger
number of light waves will meet the eye than if it were at
rest, and if it is moving away from us there will be fewer.
And so the whole spectrum will be shifted in the first case
towards the blue, and in the latter towards the red.
Motion across the line of sight, if large enough, may be
detected by observations of the star at sufficiently long
intervals; and by combining the two, if we have an idea
of its distance, we may be able to' describe its path in space.
Probably no star in the universe is at rest. Our own sun
is rushing through infinity, with his wheeling planets in
attendance, at the rate of 12 miles a second towards a
point on the borders of the constellations Hercules and
Lyra. The variable star known as Mira Ceti is retreating
from our system with a velocity of miles a second, and
this is by no means a maximum velocity.
One star differeth from another in glory, and the spec-
troscope has made it possible to classify them. Father
Secchi, in the early days of spectroscopy, divided stars into
four divisions, and although knowledge has increased very
much, his classification is still essentially the foundation of
all theories of to-day. His first division consists of very
white stars, whose spectrum is marked by strong hydrogen
lines; the second by innumerable lines, mostly metallic, of
which our sun and Alpha Centauri are good examples ? the
third comprises reddish stars, whose spectra show bands,
often beautifully shaded, sharp towards the violet and
diffuse towards the red. The spectra of the fourth class


shows heavy bauds, shaded so as to give the impression
of fluting, diffuse towards the violet end. These bands are
due to carbon absorption, and all the stars showing them
are faint and heavily-tinted objects. But while these
main divisions still hold, it does not provide for every-
thing now known, and has had to be supplemented by
new classes, one of which is the helium stars. These,
which include nearly all the bright stars of Orion, the
Pleiades, and the Cross, show very prominently the lines
of the mysterious element, which was discovered in the
stars before it was found on earth. The wonderful dis-
covery that radium atoms break up, and in so doing give
out helium ?that is, one ? element ? changes into another
?gives additional interest to these stars. It has been
suggested that if radium were present in quantities in the
sun and stars, another source of heat and light would be
available, for we know that the dissociation of radium
gives out enough energy to keep its temperature some
degrees above that of its environment. There has long
been a dispute between astronomers and geologists, for
Lord Kelvin has declared that if the only supply of solar
heat is contraction, the earth cannot be more than twenty
million years old, while geologists demand at least five
times that period for the formation of the earth's crust.
But both may be right, and the difference reconciled by
the energy liberated in the breaking down of radium, or
perhaps some other form of matter like it. Father Secchi?s
division has to be further supplemented by the inclusion
of certain aberrant stars, whose spectra do not seem
inclined to conform to rule, such as those called from
their discoverers the Wolf-Rayet stars, having both bright
lines, showing glowing gases and dark lines, proving absorp-
tion by cooler gases. Then there are stars like Procyon,
the lesser dog stars, in whose spectrum calcium, the base
of lime, is most prominent.
The question suggested itself to Father Secchi, and to
many an astronomer since?Do all stars go through the
same stages of existence, first as a. nebula, then through
the stages of helium, calcium, and hydrogen, stars then
becoming like our sun, Avith many metallic vapours in the


atmosphere; then a red star, and so on to extinction ! It
may be so, and we are pretty sure, because we can see
intermediate instances that helium stars are the hottest on
their surface, hydrogen stars next, and then solar stars,
passing on to the red stars. But that is quite a different
thing from saying that every red star has gone through
these stages. Doubtless many have, and many will, but
there are so many considerations of mass, of composition,
and of the influence of neighbouring bodies, that we cannot
assert all do. Our sun is a solitary body, but this is
rather the exception than otherwise, and we often have
two masses as huge or huger than he rotating round each
other with stupendous velocity at a distance of only a few
millions of miles. The tides generated reciprocally in
these whirling masses of incandescent gas must be beyond
anything we can conceive, and how such disturbances may
affect the convection currents, which bring up the supplies
of heat from the centre to the surface, as heated water
rises from the bottom of a kettle to the top, we do not
know, nor how they may hasten or retard the stars develop-
ment. And there are no connecting links between Secchi?s
fourth class, the carbon stars, and any of the others. They
are all faint, and only about 200 are known, the great
majority of which are in the Milky May. Some astrono-
mers think that the condition of these stars succeeds the
solar stage, which may, according to circumstances, bifur-
cate into either the third or the fourth class. Dr.
Schuster, while arguing against a uniform life history for
all stars, says : ? If an evolutionary process has been going
on, which is similar for all stars, there is little doubt that
from the bright line stars down to the solar stars the order
has been (1) helium or Orion stars ; (2) hydrogen or Sirian
stars ; (3) calcium or Procyon stars : (4) solar or Capellan
stars.? Concerning Secchi?s third class of red stars, there
is no general agreement, some placing them earlier than
the solar stars and some later.
In 1889 a conference was held in Paris to form a plan
for the systematic photographing of the whole heavens.
Eighteen great observatories in all parts of the world
agreed to take part in the scheme. In Melbourne our


observatory is doing its share. The Vatican Observatory,
which in the latter part of the sixteenth century made the
observations which enabled Gregory XIII., in 1582, to pub-
lish Ins famous reform of the calendar, was reorganised in
1888 by the late Father Denza, with the enthusiastic
approval and support of Pope Leo XIII., and is takiim
part in this great work under the charge of Father
llodi iguez. Ihe astrograph, the instrument used for this
purpose, consists of a photographic telescope, with an aper-
ture of about 13 inches, and a focal length of about as
many feet, joined rigidly to a visual telescope-, not so
large, by means of which the photographic plate is kept in
position as the instrument follows the stars in their motion
round the sky. And so a record of the face of the
heavens, giving the position of about one hundred million
stars, will be available for all time, and future scientists
av ill have reason to bless the memory of the astronomers
of to-day for their important but monotonous labours.
Of not many stars do we know the distance, Sirius,
a hydiogen star, is removed from us about nine years?
journey of light, or double as far as Aljdia Centauri. It
is prominent in the evening from November to May, pass-
ing at his highest nearly overhead, south of Orion, It is
the most brilliant of the fixed stars, and is remarkable for
having a companion almost dark. If we know the dis-
tance of a pair of stars from each other, and their periods
of revolution, we can find the mass of the system as com-
pared with the sun. Sirius gives 36,000 times as much
light as its companion, but is only a little more than
twice as massive. They revolve round each other in 52
years, and although Sirius is 21 times as bright as our
sun, its mass is only 2.0 times greater. The reasons for
this are various. It has, the spectroscope shows us, no
? dusky veil ? like that which softens the sun?s radiation.
It is also probably much more diffused than the sun, which
would, of course, give a much greater radiating surface.
It is likely that its density is not more than one-sixth that
of water.
Procyon, the brightest star in Canis mines, is half-way
in development between the hydrogen and solar stars, and


is distant from us about ten years? journey of light ?that
is, about sixty millions of millions of miles. It also has
a faint companion, and from that we learn that the system
as a whole has a mass 2.7 times greater than the sun.
There is a little star in the Great Bear, of course not visible
in Australia, about as far from us as Procyon ; but, not
having a companion, we do not know its mass. However,
it only is about one-fiftieth as bright as the sun would be
were he as far from us. These stars are our neighbours.
Li<xht, flashing along a million miles in five seconds, takes
? only ? ten years or so to reach us. If you go outside now
and watch, while ? the fiery Sirius alters hue, and bickers
into emerald and red,?? as it will if you catch it low enough,
you can think that the light that strikes your eye left the
star nine years ago. And if a star as bright as Sirius
were plunged a thousand times deeper in space, our teles-
copes would still find it. To form an idea of what stellar
distances are, let us take the case of the star which blazed
out in Perseus in February, 1901 ?? the new star of the
new century,? as Father Sidgreaves called it. New stars
will be considered later; the point to be brought out here
is distance. Nova Persei came in 24 hours from less than
the twelfth magnitude to be for one night the brightest star
in the northern hemisphere ?brighter than Vega, as bright
as Sirius. It declined rapidly, as new stars do; but
months after its glory had departed a nebula was observed
surrounding it. .A fortnight after this nebula was
observed to be expanding. Now, a motion at stellar
distances appreciable to the telescope in a fortnight is
incredible if it is an actual transportation of matter.
And the ring of nebula kept on expanding. A clever sug-
gestion was made that there was a vast mass of nebulous
matter round the star, which was lit up by its sudden
blaze-up to 4000 times its former brilliancy. Then what
was seen was the flight of light through a dark cloud. In
that case, knowing the velocity of light, and measuring the
rate of increase, we could tell the distance of the star.
And it seemed that the catastrophe wdiich caused the blaze
we saw in February, 1901, about the time of the death of


Queen Victoria, occurred in 1603, the year of the death of
her predecessor, Elizabeth.
beggars die there are no comets seen :
Ihe heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes.?
For 298 years had the message of that conflagration in
space been rushing towards us, six million of millions of
miles in every year. Before the invention of the telescope,
before the birth of Newton, when Stuarts first sat on the
r r �rf? ie l� n g agony of the thirty years? war, of
the English great rebellion, were yet in the future, that
stai burst out. Stuarts fell, the House of Orange came,
the Hanoverians came and passed, the long reigns of Louis
XIV. and XV. came to an end, Louis XVI. fell on the scaf-
fold, Napoleon crushed Europe and was crushed himself,
Victoria, 61 years a Queen, was born, crowned, and buried?
and all that time the news was rushing to us at 180,000
miles a second, to be first seen at three o?clock on a winter's
morning by an Edinburgh doctor, just finishing a night?s
work with the stars. And the only objection I have seen
to this theory of the expansion of the shining ring round
the Nova is from Professor Newcomb, an American astron-
omer, who argues that the star is in the Milky Way, and,
therefore, is 3000 years of the flight of light from us, and
that we are surveying the operation of some form of energy
travelling greatly faster than light itself. This, even on
such an authority, seems to the writer improbable; but
there is good reason to believe that much of the faint light
we see in the Milky Way has sped through the abysses" of
space for this stupendous period, perhaps before Troy fell ;
amd that, notwithstanding Dr. Wallace?s recently pub-
lished views, we can be sure that we see a limit to the stel-
lar universe. ? End is there none to the universe of God ;
10, also there is no beginning.?
Although the stars are a type of constancy, very many
of them are variable. There are two main causes of varia-
tion. One is inherent in the star. W'e can imagine, for
instance, that if the spots on our sun were so very much
laiger than they are, that they caused a marked decrease
of his light at stellar distances, he would appear to be a


variable star, with a period of about 11 years. Another
cause is when a binary system has its plane of revolution
so exactly directed towards us that the stars pass each
other twice in every rotation. If one star is dark and
the other bright, we will see one variation in every com-
plete revolution. If both are equally bright and equally
large, and pass exactly before each other, the light would
be diminished by one-half twice a revolution. Again, the
system may not be exactly ? edge on ? to us?that is, its
plane may not be pointed directly towards us. So we
might expect everything from a total eclipse, when a dark
star passes in front of a bright companion of equal size, to
the faintest diminution of light, when a bright star just
grazes the limb of a bright neighbour, as sometimes we see
a partial eclipse when the moon in her orbit passes over
only the edge of the sun. The typical eclipsing star is
Algol, the second brightest star in Perseus. It varies from
magnitude 2.3 to 3.4. There is a period of 591, hours
constant at magnitude 2.3 ; then a decline sets in, which in
4 hours 40 minutes has reduced the star to magnitude 3.4;
then, without pause, it brightens to its original magnitude,
and so over again. An average star of one magnitude is
2.5 times as bright as an average star of the next. Good-
ricke, a deaf mute, suggested in 1 1 82 that a dark satellite
was revolving round Algol. But it was not till 1889 that
the spectroscope showed that his guess was right, and that
Algol and a dark body, not much inferior in size, were
rotating round their common centre of gravity in a little
under 69 hours. The spectroscope also shows the velocity
in its orbit of the visible member; it is 26 l-3rd miles a
second. Moving at this rate, and knowing the length of
the eclipse, we can calculate the actual size of the star,
which- is a little more than a million miles, and the dark
body is about - 830,000, one being a good deal larger, and
the other about the same size as our sun. Their surfaces
are only 2,250,000 miles apart, and from this we can
calculate their mass, which, combined, is only two-thirds
that of the sun. So we see dark stars need not be frozen
and condensed to a solid. Algol is very remote from us.
The smallness of the parallax of distant stars, and the enor-


megs degree to which errors of observation are magnified,
makes it difficult to say that the figures are exactly right,
but Dr. Chase, of Yale, thinks that Algol is distant from
us 93 years? journey of light. Though the most remark-
able, he is only one of a class. Kearly 30 similar stars
are known, and doubtless many more will be discovered.
There are many stars which appear single to the highest
power of the telescope, but which give a most remarkable
spectrum. The dark lines may be single, then open out
and become double, and then become single again. If
the remarks concerning the effect of motion in the line
of sight on spectrum lines are borne in mind, it will be
evident that we have here two bodies alternately approach-
ing to and receding from our system. This, of course,
means rotation. And as the spectroscope gives us the
particulars of velocity, period, and so on from which to
calculate the orbit, it actually happens that sometimes the
mass of a system, removed from us beyond all measure-
ment, can be known within not very wide limits, which
depend on the angle the plane of the system makes with
our earth. These most interesting stars are called spec-
troscopic binaries. It must be borne in mind that one
member of a binary system may be dark, in which case
the spectrum lines swing to and fro about their normal
positions without doubling. Professor Campbell, of the
Lick Observatory, thinks ? that one star in five or six
will be found to be a spectroscopic binary ? ?that is,
whilst utterly beyond the power of the telescope to detect
their double nature, the shifting of their light in the
spectroscope shows it. And the frequency of binaries
among stars sufficiently near to be detected by the telescope
bears his argument out. So we realise that, in Miss
Gierke?s words, our system is not of the prevailing type
of stellar systems.? And, when we look ?around us and
see the infinite variety of forms of life; when we under-
stand, to use Hurrell Fronde?s not irreverent words, ? what
an imagination God has,? we feel that there is no reason
at all why we should expect His grandest works to be less
diversified than His humblest. He who engraves the
most exquisite marking on the tiny shell of the diatom,


who paints the wayside flower, and lights the evening star,
loves beauty, and beauty is found not in monotony, but in
difference.
But stars are not only associated in binary systems;
there are triple, quadruple, and multiple arrangements,
some of the large clusters comprising many hundreds of
individual stars bunched together in a most wonderful
way. The mechanics of such systems must be inconceiv-
ably complex, if stability is maintained, and it must be
confessed that we know very little about them, except the
fact that the proximity of the stars to each other is real,
and not an effect of perspective. Very beautiful are some
of these clusters, seen through a great telescope. Alto-
gether about 500 multiple systems, sufficiently complex to
be called star clusters, are known. One beautiful object
in the constellation Antinous comprises about 1200 stars.
Of another cluster in Hercules, it has been said that no
one, seeing it for the first time through a powerful teles-
cope, has been able to refrain from a shout of wonder.
Priesepe, in Cancer, well visible in these latitudes, is a
fine object for a small telescope, and a lovely system near
the .star Kappa, Crucis, is remarkable for the lovely con-
trasts of colour shown by its members, and also for the
fact that there is evidence of internal movement, which,
with further study, may teach us something of the
mechanics of clusters and the mutual relations of theii
members. Another cluster, Omega Centauri, is composed
of more than 6000 separate stars. How strange ivould
life be on a planet plunged in one of these clusters!
? There shall be no night there,? might be said of it.
Always many suns, doubtless far smaller apparently to the
inhabitant of such a world than is ours to us, ivould be
visible in the sky at once. Sometimes the universe would
seem blue, then red, then yellow, and again pure white,
as coloured suns rose, and one predominated, or all blended
their light together. Wonderful, indeed, but not suited
to us denizens of earth.
Another form of star cluster has its members joined
together and surrounded by inconceivably vast masses of
nebulous matter. The Pleiades, now visible rather low in


the northern sky after sunset, are the most striking example
of this class. Tennyson prophetically wrote in Locksley
Hall?
?/?�'!" h n e 1 seen the P i?iads 3 rising thro? the mellow shade
Orlittei like a swarm ol fireflies tangled in a silver braid.?
And this is just what photographs have shown us. The
nebulosity is too faint to be seen by the eye, but pro-
longed exposures of the photographic plate show great
clouds of nebulous stuff enwrapping the Pleiades, and
extending beyond them to such an amazing distance that
it was not till the first observations had been repeatedly
verified that they were accepted as real. We find, then,
the startling fact that ? the Pleiades and their involved
nebulosities are but the central condensations of an enor-
mous nebula, intricate in details, and covering at least a
hundred square degrees of the sky.? ?As there is reason
for believing that the system is about 200 years? journey
of light from us, this would mean that the distance from
one side of this nebula to the other is about three times
the awful distance which separates us from Sirius. The
imagination sinks appalled when it is brought face to face
with this stupendous aggregation of matter, and we may
only reverently wonder what design the Creator is achiev-
ing through this vast region of space, and during uncounted
aeons of time.
And yet the Pleiades and their surrounding nebulosities
might be stowed away in a corner of the monstrous cloud
of nebulous matter that seems to enwrap the whole of the
mighty constellation of Orion. The centre star of the
dagger, which may be seen south of the splendid belt, is
the gieat nebula of Orion, and consists of a cluster of stars,
surrounded by brilliant nebulosity. But where the teles-
cope fails, the photographic plate takes up the work, and
more and more are we finding great sweeping clouds of
world-stuff in which the brilliants of Orion are plunged,
stretching out from the nebula. Truly, ?as thus we ride
fiom infinite to infinite, as thus we tilt over abysmal
woi Ids, a mighty cry arises that systems more mysterious,
woilds more billowy, other heights, other depths, arc com-
mg, are nearing, are at hand.?


Nebulae are faint, generally telescopic obects, giving in
the telescope an appearance similar to that of the Milky
Way seen by the unaided eye. There are different sorts,
the so-called ? white ? nebulae giving a continuous spectrum
intersected by dark lines similar to that of stars. So it
is probable, though not certain, that these are clusters of
stars so remote that they cannot be separated. A remark-
able feature about nebulae is that they are nearly all of
spiral formation. The great nebula in Andromeda is evi-
dently a spiral whose plane makes an acute angle with
the line of sight from us to it, and so is seen more or less
edgeways. The magnificent spiral in the constellation
of Canes Venatici has its plane almost at right angles to
the line of sight, and so we see it broadside on. It is - a
glorious object, and, photographed, it shows a central con-
densation from which, at opposite sides, issue two spirals,
one of which terminates in another condensation. Doubt-
less these spirals indicate lines of movement, and if the
masses are composed of gas, we perhaps are witnessing the
formation of a binary or triple system. The number of
these spiral nebulae is extraordinary. It is estimated that
there are at least 120,000 in the heavens visible to us.
In reality, owing to the fact that we have not possessed
the wonderful instruments of to-day for a sufficiently long-
time, we know very little about them, but, as Miss Gierke
says, ?we seem on the verge of knowing something
definite.? Another class of nebulae is formed by the
nebulous stars, which are stars surrounded by a definite
sphere of shining matter. Very few of these are bright
enough for spectroscopic examination, and we are quite
uncertain as to their nature. Planetary nebulae are
rounded balls of faint light, showing a disc like a planet.
These, the spectroscope tells us, are undoubtedly gaseous.
Their density must be almost zero, for we can see stars
shining through thousands of millions of miles of their sub-
stance. A Crookes? tube contains only one-millionth of
the quantity of air in it at ordinary atmospheric pres-
sure, and it has been estimated that these planetary
nebulae are ten thousand times less dense than a Crookes?
tube. And this confronts us with a paradox. How can


matter so unimaginably rare as this glow as these nebulae
undoubtedly do I It is probable that their glowing is
caused by electric discharges, while on the other hand, as
we exhaust a tube in the laboratory it becomes increasingly
difficult to send a discharge through it. Such anomalies
and apparent failure of the laws we know are frequently
met with in astronomy, and must be so long as we have
to deal with conditions far transcending anything we can
produce in the laboratory. The whole question of nebulae
is at present involved in mystery. But it is probable
that with the accumulation of observations, telescopic
photographic and spectroscopic, and with the changes in
their structure, which will doubtless be noticed by astron-
omers in future years, we may be able to frame some sort
of theory to explain the life-history of these remote bodies.
On a clear, moonless night the Milky Way is a beautiful
object in the sky, stretching from the southern horizon
past the Cross to Sirius and Orion, and reaching to the
northern horizon, where it passes underneath to make the
circuit of the sky. A little observation will show that
stars are much more plentiful in the galaxy than outside
it, and the farther we go from it the fewer are the stars.
Another feature noticeable to unaided vision is the diver-
sity of structure near the Cross, and not far from the
richest part of the galaxy is the ? Coal Sack,? a black spot
seemingly quite devoid of stars; and careful observation
will show similar dark places, not so well defined, but
very evident. Then sometimes the Way breaks into
streams, and becomes diffuse. Sometimes on a good seeing
night it appears in places to be almost vibrating with
intensity of light, whilst otherwhere it is faint and hard to
see. The camera shows it is composed of hundreds of
thousands of small stars going down to the limits of visi-
bility in the best of our appliances, whilst behind this again
is perhaps a faint diffused nebulosity hardly noticeable, if
a bull may be allowed, except where it is absent, as in
the Coal Sack and similar places. The Milky Way is for
us the limits of our sidereal systems. We know not, nor
ever can know, if beyond it God has built Himself other
systems. We can know of no limit to His universe, but
t'


we seem to see limits to the system of which our sun is
a part. Herschel, once stumbling through one ot the
rifts with his great reflector, exclaimed : ? There is truly a
hole in heaven,'? and indeed we appear to be looking here
and there into the mystery of space, black, untenanted,
infinite, which surrounds us on every side.
The Milky Way is vastly remote. It is certain that
it is not less than three hundred years? light journey from
us, that is 1800 millions of millions of miles, and it is
likely to be ten times that distance. If so, some of t e
stars" in it must be of stupendous bulk-greater than any-
thing we have hitherto conceived. In it, or near it, are
most of the stars of the sky, all the planetary nebulae, an
all the new stars which sometimes startle us by their su -
den appearance. Dr. Alfred R. Wallace, in his recent
book, ? Man?s Place in the Universe,? has given his reasons
for assuming that our sun is at the centre of the Milky
Way, and though it can hardly be said that he has proved
his case, it is impossible to deny that he has collected an
amount of evidence for his main position, that our earth
is the only inhabited body in the universe, which cannot
be dismissed with a sneer. It may be admitted that it
is about as fruitless to argue on a subject of which we
can never have any direct knowledge, as it would be to
discuss how many angels can dance at once on the point ot
a needle, a subject on which it is alleged that the School-
men exerted much subtlety. But the whirligig of time
brings in its revenges, and it is a little amusing to find a
prominent man of science maintaining a position the
uniqueness of this world of ours- ?for quite other reasons
than those of the Christian, and on the whole not making
out a very bad case.
New stars, of which mention was made above, are among
the most perplexing, and, therefore, the most fascinating,
of the problems of modern astronomy. The Chinese have
records of them going back many centuries before Christ,
and it was the appearance of one which led Hipparchus,
? the father of astronomy,? to make the first star catalogue.
In 1572 one appeared which was actually visible, as Venus
sometimes is, and as the writer has seen her, in daylight,


and many observations were made on it by Tycho Brahe.
Another brilliant outburst occurred in Galileo si time, but
it was not till our own day, when the heavens are syste-
matically photographed, that it was ascertained that new
stars are comparatively common, (although those which
are sufficiently bright to attract general attention are very
rare. A new star is generally a star which appears very
suddenly in a part of the sky where none was visible before.
It quickly attains its maximum brightness, but its decline
is slower, yet certain. None has survived as a star. Since
1893, seven ? novae have been discovered, all of which,
except Nova Persei No. 2, would probably have escape'd
observation had they not been accidentally photographed
in the ordinary routine of astronomical work. In fact,
four of them were invisible at their brightest to the naked
eye, and only one was of conspicuous brightness. One in
the constellation Gemini is now under observation (1901).
Nova Persei, at its brightest, must have given out 8000
times as much light as our sun?that is, accepting the cal-
culations as to its distance referred to previously. It
sprang from invisibility in sixty hours to be for one night
the brightest star in the Northern Hemisphere, but imme-
diately began to decline, till in three weeks it was barely
visible to the naked eye. Then it recovered a little, but
again sank, and has now become, as most of them do, a
planetary nebula; or, it would be more correct to say that
a planetary nebula is visible where it appeared. More
observations are needed to prove a sound theory to account
for these outbursts, but the idea most favoured is that they
are caused by dark stars wandering through the Milky
Way, plunging into one of the diffused masses of nebulosity,
which there is reason to believe abound in that region.
Even a slow-moving heavenly body is travelling at a pace
which makes a shot from a big gun seem sluggish by com-
parison, and it is conjectured that the heat and electrical
disturbances expended by the impact of star and nebula
cause the disturbance we see. All of them are certainly
at an immense distance from our system.
So, to exjilain the new' stars, we must assume that there
are dark stars ?that is, bodies as massive as suns, but


quite dark ?rushing through infinite spaee. We have
no means of detecting these dark stars, unless they are
companions of a bright star like Algol, or unless they
have remaining a trace of radiance, as in the case of the
companions of Sirius and Procyon, not far inferior to them
in bulk, but only giving a small fraction of their light.
But if they are sufficiently numerous to cause the flare-
ups we call new stars, they must be far more numerous than
the bright stars. They may be dead suns, which have had
their day, and ceased to be as suns, so far as we can see,
aimlessly ? running along the illimitable mane.? They
may be the raw material out of which Divine Wisdom,
in the fulness of time, will make a new heaven and a new
earth. We know our own sun, in a period not long com-
pared with the life of the universe, will fade and die, and
all life and motion will cease on the earth. This must
have happened to many suns in past ages, and although
it is not quite pleasant to think of them as dark or dead,
we know that to Infinite Resource there is no such thing as
waste, and that death is but the prelude to resurrection.
Miss Clerke suggests that by their gravitative energy they
supply the chief part of the motive power of the universe,
and this may well be so ; while those ?-and there are very
many?-which revolve around bright stars may perhaps be
fitted to sustain life.
Astronomy, except in comparatively elementary branches
of it relating to navigation and surveying, is not one of
the useful sciences. No one was ever cured of a tooth-
ache by it; no one can apply its discoveries to the purpose
of making money. But it is perhaps the most ennobling
of all the sciences. As its province is to take us froth this
earth to the consideration of the heavens, our thoughts and
conceptions are enlarged and purified. We are more evi-
dently in the presence of almighty power, infinite wisdom,
and eternal love than in almost any other science. Per-
haps this is the reason it has always seemed to have a
special attraction for the clergy, and why many of the
noblest names of humanity are foul'd in the list of its
students. The fear is sometimes expressed that its very
immensity will undermine faith ; that men, seeing what


an infinitesimal speck our world is among the surrounding
eternities, will deny that mankind should have had a
special revelation from the Creator of the Universe ; still
more will deny that the Word, by whom all things were
made, could take our flesh upon Him, and be born as a
little child upon this earth. But surely such overlook
the undeniable fact that the universe, however stupendous
it appear to our faculties, is, to the Infinite Being, infinitely
small. God has chosen to call it into being, and we know
that He sees His works; He sees that they are good, and
takes pleasure in them. But in themselves they are
nothing to Him. The most glorious of the many glorious
systems in His universe is, we may be sure, of less import-
ance to Him than is one man, on whom He has bestowed
the wonderful gift of free-will, that power visible nowhere
else in nature of acting contrary to His will, earnestly
striving to act in accordance with that will; and if astron-
omy?s marvellous discoveries can do no practical good, yet
it is the law of man?s being to discover the why and where-
fore of the things among which he lives. It is a curiosity
of divine origin that impels him. The secrets of nature,
Shakespeare tells us, have much gift in taciturnity, but
lately, under man?s strenuous endeavours, they almost
seem to be talkative. He must ? follow knowledge like
a sinking star beyond the utmost bound of human thought.?
And the knowledge gained in astronomy, and indeed in
all natural sciences not abused, is that which brings wis-
dom. As knowledge grows from more to more, so does
more of reverence in us dwell. The science of to-day,
as men like Professor Lodge and Lord Kelvin prove, is
far less materialistic, far less cocksure, than thirty years
ago l . Buchner, Haeckel, and Paul Bert are no longer con-
sidered leaders of thought. The sadness of Huxley reflect-
ing on the final extinction of his being, which he sorrowfully
believed inevitable, shows a finer type of mind, and to-day
we hear very little about the antagonism of religion and
science. This is certainly due to the widening of ideas
produced by the discoveries of recent years, and to the
irresistible evidence that there is Mind behind all phe-
nomena. No vague Pantheism, but living, energising,


fructifying Mind sustaining and directing all things. And
in this return to the ancient ways no science has helped
so much as has astronomy, for no man can contemplate the
amazing truths of which this pamphlet has striven to give
some perception without realising that here is no blind
reaction of force and matter, but that behind and in all is
nod Himself.

The Objects
The Australian Catholic Truth Society.
1. To set forth Catholic truth, as it is taught by the
Church, in a clear and simple way, and to remove
certain common misconceptions concerning it from
candid minds.
2. To use the printing press and the platform, as far as
practicable, as potent means for combating the pre-
vailing disbelief in revelation, for protecting the
Catholic people from the attacks of heresy and
infidelity, and for fostering an attitude of reverent
faith towards God's holy Word.
3. To carry on a crusade against the license of the age,
against luxury and self-indulgence, and those false
standards of life which undermine the moral teach-
-ing of the Church.
4. To provide and circulate (more especially among the
poor) bright, healthy, cheap literature, suitable for
Christian homes. The publications will embrace
subjects of current interest in the varied fields of
truth, and will include short stories of a wholesome
and elevating character.
