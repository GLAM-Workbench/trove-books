45, The Queen receiving the Sacrament (the concluding part of the
Ceremony of Her Majesty’s Coronation) on the 28th of
June, 1838. By C. R. Leslie, R.A.
The picture represents Her Majesty in the Dalmatic Mantle (the Coronation
Robe), having taken off the Crown in approaching the altar, and wearing no
jewels. The peers and peeresses, who had worn their coronets from the
moment in which the Queen was crowned, have now put them off. The
Sacrament is administered by the Archbishop of Canterbury (Dr. Howley),
assisted by the Rev. Lord John Thynne, in the absence of the Dean of
Westminster. On the farthest side of the altar is the Lord Chamberlain
(the Marquis of Conyngham) and the Bishop of London (Dr. Blomfield).
The Sword of State is borne by Yiscount Melbourne, near whom are the
Duke of Wellington and the Duke of Sutherland. The Crown is held by
the Lord Great Chamberlain (Lord Willoughby d’Eresby), next to whom is
the Earl Marshall (the Duke of Norfolk.) Under the lower canopy are
seated the Ladies of the Royal Family. Nearest Her Majesty are the late
Princess Augusta, attended by Lady Mary Pelham ; the Princess Augusta
of Cambridge, attended by the Hon. Miss Kerr ; the Princess Hohenlohe,
and the Duchess of Kent, attended by Lady Flora Hastings and Viscount
Morpeth. The other ladies and gentlemen in attendance under the canopy
are the Ladies Caroline Campbell and Caroline Legge, and Yiscount Yilliers
and Emlyn. Immediately behind the Queen are the Mistress of the Robes
(the Duchess of Sutherland), and Lady Barham, the lady in waiting. In
the foreground are five of the eight young ladies who bore the Queen’s
train, namely, the Ladies Caroline Lennox, Adelaide Paget, Fanny Cowper,
Wilhelmina Stanhope, and Mary Grimston. Beyond the Coronation Chair
are the Duke of Nemours and Prince George of Cambridge, and behind it
are the Dukes of Sussex and Cambridge, the Duke of Coburg, Prince
Ernest of Phillipsthal, and the Duke of Argyll; and two pages of honor
(the Marquis of Stafford and Lord Mount Charles).

“ There is a willow grows ascaunt the brook,
That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream,
Therewith fantastic garlands did she make
Of crowflowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,
That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
But our cold maids do dead men’s fingers call them ;
There, on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds
Clambering to hang, an envious sliver broke,
When down her weedy trophies, and herself,
Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide,
And, mermaid-like, a while they bore her up;
Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes
As one incapable of her own distress,
Or, like a creature native and indu’d
Unto that element: but long it could not be,
Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,
Pull’d the poor wretch from her melodious lay
To muddy death.”

GROUPEngravings and Lithography.
CLASSES 410-414. —Drawings, Engravings, &c.
ETCHINGS by JAMES BARRY, R.A.
(Born, 1741; Died, 1806.)
LENT TO THE ROYAL COMMISSION BY THE SOCIETY FOR THE
ENCOURAGEMENT OE ARTS, MANUFACTURES, AND COMMERCE
ADELPHI, LONDON.
These 29 Etchings, at the close of the Exhibition, will he presented to the Government
of New South Wales.
Etchings Nos. 427 to 432 represent the series of Paintings executed by
Barry for the Lecture Hall of the Society.
1. Orpheus.
The scenery of this picture exhibits a view of the mountainous and desert
country of Thrace; near the centre of the piece is Orpheus, singing his
poems, his right hand stretched towards heaven, and accompanying his
instructive song upon the lyre suspended from his shoulder.
2. A Grecian Harvest Home.
The season is, as the title expresses, that of harvest, and as most of the
persons represented are employed in rural sports, the evening is chosen as
the most proper time for such relaxation from the labours of the field.
In the foreground is a double terminal figure of Sylvanus and Pan, with
their proper attributes ; round which young men and women are dancing
to the music of a rural pipe and tabour. Behind them are oxen with a load
of corn, and other characteristic marks of the season of (he year.
The distant parts of the picture exhibit a view of a fertile cultivated
country, with a farm-house, near which are men wrestling and engaged in
other manly exercises ; aged men are sitting and lying along, discoursing
and enjoying a view of those athletic sports in which they can no longer
engage, and a marriage procession is advancing from a distant temple.
3. The Victors at Olympia.
In this picture the artist lias chosen that point of time when the victors in
the several games are passing in procession before the judges, where they
are crowned with olive in the presence of all the Grecians. At the right-
hand corner of the piece, the three judges are seated on a throne,
ornamented with medallions of Solon, Lycurgus, and other legislators, and
with trophies of the victories of Salamis, Marathon, and Thermopyl®.
Near the foot of the throne is a table, at which the scribe appears writing
in the Olympic records of noble deeds, the name, family, and country of
the conqueror ; near this table, a victor in the foot-race, having already
received a branch of palm, which he holds in his hand, is being crowned ;
next him is a foot-racer, wbo ran armed with a helmet, spear, and shield.
Close following is seen a manly group, formed of two athletic figures,
bearing on their shoulders their aged father; one of these represents a
pancratiast, the other the victor at the cestus. The old man is Diagoras of
Rhodes, who, having in his youth been celebrated for his victories in the
games, has, in his advanced age, the additional felicity of enjoying the
fruits of the virtuous education he had given his sons, amidst the acclama-
tions of the people of Greece, some of whom are strewing flowers around


CLASSES 410 414—continued.
4. The Thames.
the old man’s head, while one of his friends is grasping his right hand,
and supposed to be making the celebrated speech recorded on this occasion,
“ Now, Diagoras, die, for thou canst not be made a god.” Near this group
are seen a number of persons, the chief of whom represents Pericles
speaking to Cymon. Socrates, Euripides, and Sophocles, are earnestly
attending to what is said by Pericles, whilst the malignant buffoon Aristo-
phanes is ridiculing the deformity of the cranium of the speaker, which
was unusually long. The painter has in the person of Pericles introduced
the likeness of the late Earl of Chatham.
Sitting on the base of the statue of Hercules, the artist has introduced his
own portrait, in the character of Tiraanthes, holding in his hand a picture
of the Cyclops and Satyrs, as related by ancient writers.
The artist has in this picture represented the Thames of a venerable,
majestic, and gracious aspect, sitting on the waters in a triumphal car, steer-
ing himself with one hand, and holding in the other the mariner’s compass,
by the use of which modern navigation connects places the most remote, and
has arrived at a certainty, importance, and magnitude unknown to the
ancient world. The car is borne along by our gi’eat navigators, Sir Erancis
Drake, Sir Walter Raleigh, Sebastian Cabot, and Captain Cook; in the
front of the car, and apparently in the action of meeting it, are four figures
representing Europe, Asia, Africa, and America, ready to lay their several
productions in the lap of the Thames.
Overhead is Mercury, the emblem of Commerce, summoning the nations
together ; and following the car are Nereids carrying several articles of th«
principal manufactures of Great Britain.
5. The Society.
This picture represents the distribution of the rewards of the Society of
Arts, founded in 1754, for the purpose of introducing and perfecting the
useful arts in this country. Not far advanced from the left side of the
picture stands the late Lord Romney, then President of the Society ; near
the President stands His Royal Highness the then Prince of Wales ; and,
sitting in the corner of the picture, holding in his hand the plan of the
institution, is Mr. William Shipley, “ whose public spirit gave rise to this
Society.” In the back-ground appear part of the water-front of Somerset
House, St. Paul’s, and other objects in the vicinity and view of this
Society as instituted at London. As a very large number of the rewards
bestowed by the Society had in Barry’s day been distributed to promote the
arts of painting and sculpture, the artist has also most judiciously intro-
duced a picture and statue; the subject of the picture is the Fall of Lucifer,
designed by Mr. Barry when the Royal Academy had selected six of the
members to paint pictures for St. Paul’s Cathedral; the statue is that of
the Grecian Mother Dying, and in those moments attentive only to the
safety of her child. In the corners of the picture are represented many
articles which have been invented or improved by the encouragement of
this Society.
6. Elysium, or the State of Einal Eetribution.
In this picture the artist has brought together those great and good men,
of all ages and nations, who have acted as cultivators and benefactors to
mankind.
In the top of the picture the painter has glanced at what is called by
astronomers the system of systems, where the fixed stars, considered as so


CLASSES 410-414—continued.
many suns, each with his several planets, are revolving round the Great
Cause of all things; and, representing everything as affected by intelligence,
has shown each system carried along in its revolution by an angel.
In the centre of the picture are animated portraits of the good and great of
all ages; and in the other corner of the picture the artist has represented
Tartarus, where are seen War, Gluttony, Extravagance, Detraction, Par-
simony, Ambition, Tyranny, Hypocrisy, and Cruelty, with their proper
attributes.
7. Portrait of the late James Barry, E.A., born 1741, died 180 G.
In Barry’s original design the space at the end of the room, between the
pictures of “ Orpheus” and the “ Grecian Harvest Home,” was to have been
filled with a portrait of George the Third, and that between “ The Thames ”
and “ The Society,” with a group representing Queen Charlotte superin-
tending the education of her family at Windsor Castle. Barry did not
live to complete these pictures, but his intentions were accurately recorded
in this etching.
8-15. Groups taken from the original pictures represented by the
etchings Nos. 1,2, 3,4, 5, and 6.
16. The Temptation of Adam.
17. The Phoenix, or the Resurrection of Freedom.
A tablet in this picture is thus inscribed : —“ O Liberty, thou parent of
whatever is truly amiable and illustrious, associated with virtue, thou
hatest the luxurious and intemperate, and hast successively abandoned thy
loved residence of Greece, Italy, and thy more favoured England, when
they grew corrupt and worthless ; thou hast given them over to chains and
despondency, and taken thy flight to a new people, of manners simple and
untainted. Hallowed and venerable are thy footsteps. Time, that best
arbiter, shall distinguish, and strew thy track with honors.”
18. Testimonial to tbe memory of Charles James Fox,
19. Job reproved by his Friends, Dedicated to Edmund Burke.
20. Sacra Christi Familia.
21. The Conversion of Polemon.
Polemon, an Athenian youth, returning home in the morning from his
night’s entertainment, overcome with wine, saw the door of the philosopher
Zenocrates open. He entered the school, which was filled with learned
men, and endeavoured to disturb the company and the wisdom and elo-
quence of the speaker by his drunken jests. The countenance of Zenocrates
still continued the same, and, departing from the subject on which he was
speaking, he began to discourse on modesty and temperance, by the gravity
of which Polemon was so affected that from an infamous debauchee he
became an illustrious philosopher, remarkable for his sobriety, virtue, and
abilities, and succeeded Zenocrates in the school of Plato.
22. Philoctetes, in the Island of Lemnos.
This is an engraving of a picture in the Institute at Bologna, inscribed to
Sir George Saville, Bart.

23. The Fall of Satan.
