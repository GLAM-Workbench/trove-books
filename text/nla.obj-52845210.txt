Was there ever kindest shepherd
Half so gentle, half so sweet,
As the Saviour who would have us
Come and gather round His feet?
There’s a wideness in God’s mercy
Like the wideness of the sea;
There’s a kindness in His justice
Which is more than liberty.
There is no place where earth’s sorrows
Are more felt than up in heaven;
There is no place where earth’s failings
Have such kindly judgment given.
For the love of God is broader
Than the measures of man’s mind,
And the heart of the Eternal
Is most wonderfully kind.

For all the saints who from their labours rest,
Who Thee by faith before the world confessed,
Thy name, O Jesu, be for ever blessed.
Alleluia!
Thou wast their Eock, their Fortress, and their
Might;
Thou, Lord, their Captain in the well fought fight;
Thou in the darkness drear their one true Light.
Alleluia!
O may Thy soldiers, faithful, true, and bold.
Fight as the saints who nobly fought of old,
And win, with them, the victor’s crown of gold.
Alleluia!
O blest communion, fellowship divine!
We feebly struggle; they in glory shine!
Yet all are one in Thee, for all are Thine.
Alleluia!

The sands of time are sinking;
The dawn of heaven breaks;
The summer morn I’ve sighed for,
The fair, sweet morn, awakes.
Dark, dark hath been the midnight;
But day-spring is at hand,
And glory, glory dwelleth
In Immanuel’s land.
The King there, in His beauty,
Without a veil is seen;
It were a well spent journey,
Though seven deaths lay between:
The Lamb, with His fair army,
Doth on Mount Zion stand.
And glory, glory dwelleth
In Immanuel’s land.
O Christ! He is the fountain,
The deep, sweet well of love;
The streams on earth I’ve tasted
More deep I’ll drink above;
There to an ocean fulness
His mercy doth expand,
And glory, glory dwelleth
In Immanuel’s land.
With mercy and with judgment
My web of time He wove,
And aye the dews of sorrow
Were lustered by His love;
I’ll bless the hand that guided,
I’ll bless the heart that planned,
When throned where glory dwelleth
In Immanuel’s land.
I’ve wrestled on towards heaven,
’Gainst storm, and wind, and tide;
Now, like a weary traveller
That leaneth on his guide,
Amid the shades of evening,
While sinks life’s lingering sands,
I hail the glory dawning
In Immanuel’s land.

Eock of Ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee;
Let the water and the blood,
Prom Thy wounded side which flowed,
Be of sin the double ctm?.
Save from wrath and make me pure.
Could my tears for ever flow,
Could my zeal no languor know,
These for sin could not atone;
Thou must save and Thou alone;
In my hand no price 1 bring.
Simply to Thy cross I cling.
While I draw this fleeting breath,
When my eyes shall close in death,
When I rise to worlds unknown,
And behold Thee on Thy throne,
Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee.
