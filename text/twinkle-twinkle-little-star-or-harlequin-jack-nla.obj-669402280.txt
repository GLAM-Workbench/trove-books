THIS FfiOZEN KEGION.
Hurr I’ve scarcely room to blow here. Let me blaster.
When the wind’s southerly—
® | now . You blow a buster!
Hurr Silence in the coorc ! Subdue your noise,
There’s some one coming down the passage boys !
Snow Yah!
Aut Ha ! he comes, King Winter, he’s late !
Snow Where does he come from ?
Hurr Why the Underwood Estate.
Enter King Winter. They all bow.
King W Cease sycophantic fools, I’m sick of antic,
And your loud bawling drives me nearly frantic.
If you will shout, ’twere better and much quicker,
If at, Jim Punch’s you would shout—a liquor.
Snow Your Majesty, your Snowdrops meant no harm.
King W No, but snowbawling always makes me warm,
The cold I love, but in the sunshine’s beams,
Ice melts, I shrieks, I shudders, and ice creams !
And soon like fortune by a rake run through,
Melt and resolve myself myself into a Jew (dew).
1 run to waste as fast as I can do it,
I feel like Applett I could lick Frank Hewitt.
Hurr ’Tis far too warm already. This December ?
King W Ah, but we’re in New South Wales remember.
That undecided country where I’m told
The very winds blow sometimes hot and cold,
And little stars, instead of darkly sinking,
Keep peeping out and ogling one like winking.
Snow Winking! when they should patterns be of coldness.

SONG—“ 0.K.”
(Music at Nicholson and Ascherberg’s.)
Well, here I am, and you must know,
My name is Twinkle, Twinkle,
I m called the favourite of George-street,
In fashion know each wrinkle.
I ne’er do anything by halves,
Oh no, that’s not my way,
What e’er I take in hand to do,
I do it quite O.K.
Ciiobus— Quite 0.K., Quite 0.K.,
That’s my style in every way
Quite 0.K., Qnite 0.K.,
What e’er I do its quite O.K.
My style and dress, if you’ll observe,
Becomes me to a T ;
If they don’t suit my figure, well
Why then they don’t suit me.
Some fellows calls me “faddy,” but
I care not what they say :
I could not let myself be seen,
Unless I’m quite O.K.
Chokus— l’m Quite O.K.
Twin lam the evening star whom poets write of
And sonnets in my praise there are a sight of,
Th ey say my eyes are bright, my ringlets curly,
My teeth, like pearls, because I get (u )p early,
I drink Mort’s Frozen Milk, and when I eat,
I use a can of cold Australian Meat.
First after sundown I dance the skies,
And tell my sister stars ’tis time to rise.
(Badianta and Stars rise. Diana enters.)
Rad Diana ! Queen of Night!
Diana There’s nothing mars
Your welcome kind, for which I thank my stars
Stars that pay well, though stars we often see,
Who are only merry in a-merry-key I

Twin Well he might!
T would be no wonder, Queen ; for every night,
Upon this wicked world we see, I think,
So much at which we are compelled to wink.
An instance ’twere not difficult to seek,
There’s the swindle done at Yanko Creek
They took it from the squatters —all in vain—
They let the squatters have it all again,
And McElhone may stand for ever on his legs,
They’ll do such things again—as sure as he had eggs*
Diana He threatens to enveil us with his clouds,
That we no more may light the wand’ring crowds,
So Sirius shall be our starry watch-dog.
Twin He’s a sky tarrier, though scarce a Scotch dog!
"i ou may rely on him, we’re always finding
His bow is perfect, and his wow is binding.
He’s register’d , so the police have naught”to do,
They very near lost Vaughan, and Porter too,
But for Jim Oatley they’d have got away.
He did the job, no, matter what folks say,
He nail’d ’em tight! But, there, I’m in a fog,
We’ll leave what did oc cur— what of this dog?
Diana To earth he courses —
Rad Not in winter’s fog days !
Diana Oh, j es, these coursing times are truly dog days —
Each dog his day, so Sirius, beware,
This trip you’ll find a Sirius affair.
Twin Heigho!
Diana That sigh!
Twin Oh, let 'me go to earth !
Diana But should you there love one of mortal birth,
That moment his mortality you’d share.
Twin I never thought of that—nor do I care !
Diana Fulfil your destiny ! Tour wish is granted ;
But if you love, the boon can’t be recanted,
By what you do, you always must abide,
You can’t, like Bibbs, go to ihe other side ! .
Nor e’en like Davies, turn, and twist, and bend r
And, tho’ teetotaller, be the pub’s best friend.
Stick to your first love, right or wrong,
Like Angus Cameron, in allegiance strong.
And so farewell, beware avenging Nemesis !
You, Radianta, see her off the premises.
Rad Your wish is my command.
Diana And now, my dears,
Let’s treat her to the music of the spheres.

Song—“ALL THINGS LOVE THEE, SO DO I.”
(Music at Nicholson and Ascherberg’s.)
Gentle waves upon the deep,
Murmur soft when thou dost sleep,
Little birds upon the tree,
Sing their sweetest soDgs for thee—
Their sweetest songs for thee.
Cooling gales with voices low,
In the tree tops gently blow,
When thou dost in slumbers lie,
All things love thee, so do I.
All things love thoe, all things love thee,
All things love thee, so do I.
Twin In merry Sydney, once more I appear,
And, find the place quite altered, since last year.
The Abbatoirs have turned a shade more sweet,
And sent the fever from the city’s meat !
The Infirmary kills its pauper patients still,
They should remove it on to Barrack Hill !

Three monthly mails arrive the self same week.
Of its curator, the Museum’s bereft,
They treated like a dog poor Gerard Krefft,
They voted him a thousand, and think it, funny,
To laugh at him, when he demands his money.
The Press tried Walter Cooper’s plays to mar ;
But now I hear he is a “ legal star."
They lend books now to all the nation,
All who can get a parson's recommendation !
The Stockwhip’s dead, and Hidden Syrings are found,
Discordant waters everywhere abound :
And Allen, Beg, and even Tyerman too
< Once fast asleep, have found a lot to do.
New buildings rise in every business btreet
And faces strange on every hand I meet.
The Parliament House I’d quite forgot' about
Where men excited do their nightly spout,
Where McElhone and fierce Buchanan shout,
And Garrett puts the naughty boys to rout.
Where Nelson, spite of lack of sense or beauty
By his tirades, makes others do their duty.

Who tried to oust Joachim from his right.
Made by my family of sons and daughters,
To cut my stick into still larger quarters.
The shoe was too small by several inches—
Ah, folks soon find out now where the shoe pinches.
Fled are the days when sweets I used to cram,
And find some pumpkins in colonial jam.
Now everything is such an awful price,
Nice things are dear, and, what ain't dear, ain’t nice
To buying poison now they put a bar,
For twenty folks must prove you’re who you are.
Of every kind of meat we’ve had a cut on,
Wether, ewe liked, or no Australian mutton ;
The frozen meat of T. S. Mort—well there,

We’ve tried Glu-ene, Pepsine, Colonial porter,
We’ve bust our buttons off with Botany water.
The Fragrant Floriline is flagrant folly,
And Starkey’s ginger beer is awful jolly !
I own I like it better—much perhaps
If in it goes a thimbleful of schnapps.
We’ve eaten everything ! old coir rope,
Cod liver oil, sardines, carbolic soap,
Pain paint and Pottie’s oil, old boots, old hats,

GEORGE WOODS & Co.
The nearest approach to success that has been attained in the produc-
tion of an exact imitation of the soft quality of tone hitherto found only
in the Organ pipe, has been accomplished by
& Co.
These instruments are celebrated over all others for their remark-
ably fine and rich quality of tone; their great capacity for variety of
effect, which is owing to the use of their famous Combination Solo Stops
notable amongst which may he mentioned the “Vox Humana,” a bari-
tone solo stop of delightful quality—the “ iEoline,” a soft or breathing
stop of the most delicious kind.
The “Piano.”—This can he played alone, or in combination with
any stop or stops, and never requires tuning. This is an invention of
the greatest importance, as, in addition to its supplying a very beautiful
solo stop, it imparts to the instrument an element of life and brilliancy,
a sweet tone blending with the reed, changing its entire character and
adding greatly to its power.
These instruments are also noted for their Extraordinary Power >

I asked her to return with me,
She said, “ Now do you think
Thit I could leave this dear old earth,
Where I’m the Bella of the Rink.
Chorus.—Yes, I’m the Belle of the Rink,
The skating Rink is all the go,
It’s awfully jolly, don’t you know,
To be the Belle of a skating Rink.
♦
1 said 1 am the Prince Jack Frost,
And do my skating daily,
At which her pretty head she tossed,
And laughed at me so gaily ;
I could’nt make her understand'
That I could skate like she—
She would’nt let me shake her hand,
She was afraid of me.
(Spoken) She ran away, singing —Chorus.
At last when out of breath she stopped,
Again begau I pleading,
Again to this fair maid I “ popped ”
And still she was not heeding—
I seized her hand, and wildly cried,
“Oh ! darling, give me this.”
She ran away, and would not give
Me just one little kiss.
(Spoken) Singing gaily and saucily— Chorus.
Enter Tom.
Tom I cannot see her anywhere. I fear
I love a maiden in too high a sphere,
Ha! ha ! her ire severe, endure I won’t
I’ll do some desperate deed.
Jack Excuse me—don’t
Tom Why you must be Jack Frost.
Jack I’m Iceland from
But don’t let there be coolness ’twixt us Tom.
The usual story, eh ? You loved a star
Who twinkled and then vanished.
Tom Right you are !
And her attraction for me has such force
That up to skyland I would wing my course.
Jack {Laughs.) Excuse my laughing, ’tis no breach of
suavity,
Tom True, my remarks upsets the laws of gravity.

Jack I promise you my aid, where was she lost ?
Tom I really cannot tell you, Mr. Frost ?
For everywhere I’ve searched, at Balls and races,
At Picnics, Fetes, and fifty other places.
E’en the Museum, that best of places,
Where kissing’s often done behind the cases,
And in the Gardens, passed some anxious hours,
And my umbrella Jilted with stolen Jlowers !
I’ve done the block until my poor brain whirls,
Bewildered by the lovely Sydney girls.
Duet—Tom and Jack.
Enter Dame.
Dame Why all this noise, I pray ? ycu’ll wake my chickens
I thought so, now begins the usual lickings.

A while forget their woes,
By hill and meadow, fancy free,
She sings whene’er she goes.
Viva, la Bella—la Diana,
Viva, viva—la Diana.
Diana I oughtn’t to be here to-day and yet
I must keep watch o’er Twinkle, little pet,
By coming down I nothing risk—for lor
I as Diana can’t die any more.
My colour is, like Doctor Lang’s, true blue
Like him, to wear it I want paying too
Moreover on this earth this classic dame
Has scarce a habitation or a name,
Of me indeed it may be truly said— *
I shed my rays, but cannot raise a shed.
I would I were a man, my spirit tends
“Once more into the breach, dear friends!”
As Chaplin turned to Norma, South to Adelgita
So I wonld be a man, but can’t to please ye.
So lonely here from Diana’s home a far light,]

Receive your Emp’ror in a fitting manner.
Enter Emperor.
Emp Don’t look so happy, miserable creature !
You all presume upon my known good nature.
Baron Oh, pray, be reasonable, sire!
Emp I won’t!
Lord H Your highness knows—
Emp Well, no, my highness don’t.
You’re kept for that, so cease your useless frothing,
I’m proud to say I never do know nothing.
I don’t know where Frank Gardiner was sent to
Nor where the Dandenong Fund money went to.
I can’t find out tho' some no doubt could tell,
Why they sacked Morris, and did not sack Bell !

Emp Say, don’t you love me ?

[Music at Nicholson & Ascherberg’s.]
Twin I am an evening star, I’d have you know,
Though you think me a nice young girl,
’Tis not an hour since here below
I came down in a whirl.
Emp You mean to say you are, I guess,
An operatic star ?
You mustn’t say no—
Twin I cannot say yes—

For many folks believe they’re stars, and ain’t.
Stay, listen sweetest, I’ve a great idea,
You’ll be my gal at home —my Galatea.
Twin No, sir, to play a part like that I’d scoff,
Emp That’s how she thinks to Carey of it off.
Twin Your Majesty is pleased to be facetious—

But of this little one I think a lot.

Twin You horrid monster, let me go!
Emp I'll not.
We’ll cut your wizen if you do but squeal,
Twin I’m like John Davies—not afraid of steel!
Emp Wed me at once—l’m not in trifling humour,
Twin I’d sooner wed that horrid Prince Satzuma.
Emp You can't ; he’s in Japan.
Twin He’s in the Golden Barrel ,
Now hence away, or you and I will quarrell.
Song — Air, “ You ought to see my Sarah.”

Twin Yourself you can’t make scarcer,
Than I would have you be.
So linger if you dare, sir !
Baron Oh, isn’t tnis a spree !
Here’s his Majesty been order’d off!
Emp Allow me to remark—
You may laugh at me until you cough,
But I fail to see the lark !
Oh, although I may dissemble,
There’s bound to be a row!
In style of Kean or Kemble
I shall break out just now ;

King W But help relations, like a Bathurst Jury.

'Tis now twelve months ago, when Harry Parkes
Was told by Robertson he was playing larks,
So Jack put Harry out —but soon alack !

King W A backward glance now let us cast,
And see how much we’ve gained in Session past.
Our members, to the City’s grief and sorrow.
Refused a Railway down to Illawarra,
An Education Act they deftly tried to cook,
But Farnell quickly brought the powers to book .
They passed an Act, the’ some were rather loth,
To let a man take his own “ Colonial oath!
The Jury Bill amended was a boon indeed,
But on the Balmain Bridge they’re not agreed !
Tom Brown they ousted, for his games at Hartley.
Hugh Taylor was forgiven, he sinned but partly !
We found the Upper House was most defective,
And so it will be, till its made elective!
Knowing that the most cunning the most brave is
To the publican’s picnic we sent John Davies
Who promises made, so candidly spoken
He knew in his heart that all be broken.
Thus passed the Session, full of strife and wishes,
Not for the public good—no— loaves and fishes!
[Noise heard .]
That noise 1 What means that string of wedding

Enter Emperor and Suite.

Enter Dame with a market basket.
Dame Oh drat the boys ! with peg tops, tops for humming

I really don’t know what the boys are coming to,
When with such tops their trousers they do rend,
Their tops ain't what I whip you may depend,
They with those things with terror fill us,
Which Paling call their “ caterpillars ,”
He’s a J. P. who at the Central sits,
To understand him you must first see Fritz.
A weary way I've wandered from my home,
Compelled each week a marketing to roam,
For each commodity grows scarcer still,
John Davies wanted a Permissive Bill,
But McElhone showed John up mighty fine,
By finding out about that cask of wine !
But John declared—to ears obtuse,
He had no wine, “ so help his goose 1”
They’re cut off brandy, whisky, ale, and porter,
They’ve done their hardest to cut off the water.
For years they have been working in the dark,
To rectify their blunders we have sent for Clark.
For local songs this is the truly proper season,
For me to shirk the custom there’s no reason.
LOCAL SONG.
Air, “ I’m on the Teetotal.”
[Music at Nicholson & Ascherberg’s.J
I want to tell you how it is
That some folks prosper here ;
It’s not because they go to church,
Or keep away from heer.
If you’re in debt, soon you can get
Out of it very cheap,
For up in King-street, I am told,
A whitewash can they keep.
Spoken. —Yes, there’s no mistake about it—no amount of
gingerbeer or Good Templarity will keep a man away from
King-street if he finds it convenient to go there. Some folks
is allers preachin’ abstinence—it’s no use—l’ve tried it—but
it was an awful failure.

And the peppermint of gin.

Music at Nicholson and Ascherberg’s.
You may talk about your dashing blondes \
And lovely brunettes gay,
But there's none so fair, as can compare,
With my Belle of Double Bay.
She is only seventeen years old,
And has such modest grace,
‘Twould do you good, indeed it would,
To see her smiling face,
And hear her little prattling tongue,
She’d steal your heart away.
Her feet are small
And she’s not tall,
Is my Belle of Double Bay.
We first met ’twas in Summer (Dance)
And for life, I think I’ve won her (Dance)
You may talk about your dashing blondes,
And lovely brunettes gay,
But there’s none so rare as can compare
To my Belle of Double Bay.

At the Commandant’s Parade !
We scorn all pay, and march away,
Our Land Orders we give away;
Not one of us at home would stay
From the Commandant’s Parade.

In bran new helmets gorgeously arrayed,
We loudly shout, the girls turn out,
And throw a salutation,
We march, stiff as starch,

Diana.
Our winter's past, we deem it here no crime,
To have oub Christmas in the summer time.
Though Winter and Jack Frost are with us now,
I'll soon acclimatise them both, I vow.
We hope that in our nonsense ended,
We have no single soul offended.
Fun is our aim and our employment
Is to give' you a Christmas Night's enjoyment.
Say have we done so ? Yes ? I'll now proceed
To melt away Jack Feost in very deed.
For he must now our Pantomime enhance,
As Harlequin to show all Sydney how to dance.
Chance.
And you fair Twinkle, must now be made,
As Columbine to give our Harlequin aid!
Change
King Winter it’s no use you must do all you can,
As Pantaloon to be a nice old man.
Change.
And the Emperor must now resign his Crown,
For the cap of folly as our jolly Clown.
Change.
Now give full vent to fast and roaring fun,
Making all laugh, but mind, offending none.
Here take this bat—and keep these two,
Seeking for lots of mischief still to do.
I leave you to it, and wish you cheer,
A Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.
Exit Diana.
