THE EX-SLAVE?S DREAM.
For foul wrong done, for brand I bear.
I've vengeance vowed both wide and deep
Sag mem?rics dark, why should I spare
Those, who such shame did on me heap.
British Slate.
Dreaming, my peers ! of Scotia?s strand,
Mj dream, the lightnings sweep ;
As on Australian beach of sand,
I dreamed of her, my native land !
With giens, with mountains steep;
Whose rivers flow through fertile plains,
From lochs so clear and deep :
Where crag- o?er crag - , in rugged chains,
Erst echoed oft to warlike strains,
From the proud chieftain?s keep.
Dreaming the dream of my childhood?s home,
The dream of happy youth,
Ere my proud heart earth's guile had known,


Ere th? entailed tools of entailed throne,
Had banished dreams of truth.
Dreaming- of my loved mother?s smile,
My sisters dear, in sooth,
Loved sire?s proud look (between the while)
His feared rebuke?the prayer, but g-uile
Which guided boyhood?s ruth.
Dreaming of Stuart, from proudest place
Expelled?for treachery done?
Though more than false each mould be grace
Base scions of a Judas race,
Who raised? more treachlrous son-
Haaael?Sharezer?l?ve no name
Meet for that German gnome ;
For the Monteith?s I?ve no fit blame
Who did invite him? hordes and shame ?
And vampyre tastes to come.
Dreaming of the honour set at nought.
Of sires mho hept pledged words?
By truchsters mho then titles bought
With price, to foreign viper brought?
That price, their truth, their swords.
Of few ?scaped butch?ring on lost f eld,
Run down by hounds and lords;
Because e?en then they scorned to yield,
?Neath Foreign Thugs to he entailed,
To herd with traitor hordes.


Dark grew mj dream, childhood had flown
I roamed o?er raging waves,
And knew my sire?and mother lone, ?
And sisters wept for brothers gone
T? untimely unknown graves;
For dream was then of Britain's ships,
With collars, gags, and glaives,
Of the quick fiats of despot lips,
Of brave tars writhing ?neath their whips
Aroused, I wrote ? The Slaves."
Though to be Byron! I?ve no claim,
Yet, Critics, let me say,
Ere that ye mark me lawful game,
I with my claws, and barely tame.
Am Scot of modern day.
Then would ye ape ? Edina's digue ?
Then welcome scrat away.
Nay, never mind, your hides ! how thick,
For when ye?ve clawed me to the quick,
Moses I?ll repay.
I neither reck faint praise nor ban ;
Yet ere you either try,
Best, One-eye like, my work to damn
For, or but Gold, try silent plan
With base ?? So lists ? ?to vie.
Though true in that he does but lead
Time serving press so shy,


Of what great hase-raen would not read,
For?t wont Our Patrons suit indeed,
Each d d to me reply.
They?re wise ! for mould-tie or true Bard
Mute contempt best.floors?
With due respect I them regard.
Say could they, if they dared, bite hard.
They, barely Scotch Review?rs,
To risk best Patron?s Gold ne?er dared
Such worthy Editeurs;
For, how gained, gold does well reward
Such press for trouble, to retard
Their crimes from eyes like yours.
?Fore you ?my Peers'. ?Their crimes?now bare,
Despite?that Press ?how base
Indictments proced ??twere crime?to spare
Base crime?to made of Flaws ?not rare
? 'Scape Gate,"?J or such a chase ?
For! ?Gainst?That Sapping shame?l plead
The British Empire's ! case?
Then ! For Her?Selves and Children, ?read
Then! By Mould-law ! and /S'VcZ-penned deed?
Th? Entailed Curse?quick ! Erase.

MY CRITICS
THE SWIPE HOUSE MULE
CORROBOREY HOUSE ENTIRES,
THEIR ONE-EYED ORGAN, Ac.
? Say, mem?ries dark ? why should I spare?
Now Emblings all best take good note.
Attention I?d arouse,
To famous mule! by Griffin got,?
At Railway Swiping House.
As I?d be plain, let all concern'd,
Know that I?ve been a Tar;
And so?from Town, by rail return?d,
I steer?d for Griffin's bar.
Alongside but a bump did sheer,
Then to complete my plan,


I order?d quick a glass of beer,
From thing I thought was man.
li�I i� would he Author"?stand confest,
Who wrote? The British Slave!
And think it ought to interest,
So to him copies gave!
And lie, hut reading of a verse,
Came Critic?in a flash !
That thing ?in terms select and terse?
Pronounced it?? Thorough trash.?
I mark?d him quick, as trash he said,
Then hoofs ? then tail?-appears ;
I noted then his?how long?head !
And then his?how long?ears !
He?d brave as true, said ? All, base clip ! ?
For which?-my peers?l stand,
With the earn?d sneer?upon my lip !
Due scorn?-at my command.
All hail! to all such Critics bold !
Such obligations lay;
Such debt, with interest, four-times told,
Don?t doubt but I?ll repay.
For ere that Critic in full spoke,
I proved he was by rule,
One? short of corporation ?Moke !
So ? down?d him??Griffin?s Mule.


And he like such ?now high in short!
May rise both fast and far;
For would-be Knights! grace true knight?s court,
From Run, Stall, Stage, and Bar!
And though to us ?rank Traitors!
Yet nobbler-rais?d, d?ye see ;
Can such?rank adulterators !
Mouth Law ! to you and me !
And when for Queen ! next truths, they rule.
And Mokes?for freight aspire ;
?Stead Moke they, e?en may send that Mule,
T?out donkey ?last Entire !
And, dear Queen ! may but wrong (much do
As Fve been taught) by Crook !
Say ?? Rise, Sir Mule! to Caste !be true; ?
Or, ? Rise of Mules ! the Duke ! ?
And as he?d cap! th? ? Entires? ! at once
The proof! his Critique net;
He?s welcome to my influence,
With their? One-eye'd Gazette!
Yet were he Whole and she?d entail,
Again I?d front the Guelph!
And say?less cant?l?d rise Cromwell!
And pay for peers and self.
But if?from modesty?she?d bare?
? Such stretch of power ! try on??


I?d say?Just Queen !?of wisdom rare
Then Tell! or Washington !
But I?ve sheered from?The section'd ass
So patience peers ! I pray ;
Nor ?The how? baulk? true critics pass
I all?Moke genus pay.
For I?the how long years?a slave.
Now ?Thorough Despot! stand;
So A. I. Fractum I wise as brave,
Come, quick! at my command.
Ye monstrous segment of an ass,
I ? who did Byron rob !?
Trust, though I can?t yet wield his claws,
My own may do your job.
Ye?ve dared to ape Edina's clique,
And though it me degrade;
I?ll dare to ?to rip your hide?how thick,
Till ye?re, by Moses, paid.
Faugh ! though I must respect my claws.
Let no Mule dread arrears ;
So vanish ! ?ye all but an ass !?
u Quick! gallop!? for your ears.
And such Trucksters, and such Breeders,
Our curse?our deep disgrace ?
Ye, by now Press, nam?d their readers,
Had better join the Chase.


Hall! faster?if ye'd ?scape the stake,
Down hill be all yonr flights;
Your Jesuit organs with you take,
Who?ve mouthed wrong to reap Rights.
My peers, from patent curse I fled,
(From Britain?s entailed shame;)
Though mine was less a Lam-lord?s head.
Its brand on brain and name.
Its Hydra cub?now in this land,
Disguised braves light of day;
Such god?with priests?a specious band.
My peers, must we obey ?
Ye sons of many a warlike race,
Arouse for shame (ye strong,)
Unite and swamp, yet young, disgrace.
Fast growing monster wrong.
Gloss?d ! by' his Press?for nameless hire,
{lily houseless peers), he hands;
They, top, with silence, shield his sire.
For both can grant broad lands.
My landless peers ! could we not hush
That press, by' Arnolds led ; [crush
We?ve ?ways??we?ve ?means??then why not.
At once ?its one-eyed bead ?
Their gods laid hare, made the Mule, bold-
.Confront me but a mask !


More crafty press?for un-stain?d gold,
Quiet tries re-rob-ing task.
Guile past, unfit, in one foul name,
Guilt of now Press to show;
"Whose mouthing gilds TK entailed mad shame
Whose muteness foils th? earned blow.
Now! Critics, I?ve tried to toe Their Laws,
Their Schemes by rule ?to write.
Good, ye?ve pledged truth, yet mark my claws.
And Teeth?now bared?but spite
So Authors Brave?who?d brave The Gripes,
And brave revision true ?
Just! brave a glass of Hallway Swipes,
And writhe like Donald ? Dim.?
