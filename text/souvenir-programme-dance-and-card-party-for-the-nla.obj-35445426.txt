A Tribute to Captain shout, V.C., M.C.
ON behalf of Ist Battalion, A.1.F., I wish to relate
the heroic and glorious deeds and death of our
gallant Captain A. J. Shout, who was awarded the
Military Cross on that ever-to-be-remembered Red Sun-
day, 25th April, 1915, and who after nearly four
months of the awful hardships and cruelties of war
on the blood-stained and shell-shattered hills of
Gallipoli—won the much-coveted Victoria Cross for
conspicuous bravery at Lonesome Pine trenches.
On the morning of August 9th, he, with a very
small party, charged down a trench strongly occupied
by the enemy, throwing four bombs which killed eight
of the enemy, routing the rest. During the evening
he captured a further line of trench under similar
conditions, and continued personally to bomb the
enemy within close range under very heavy fire until
severely wounded, losing his right arm and left eye,
and sustaining other injuries to the body.
He succumbed from his injuries in the hospital,
and was buried in the blue waters of the .Egean Sea,
where sleeps many a brave and deeply mouurned
Australian hero.
Captain Shout was wounded in the side and had
a bullet through his arm on the first day, but would
keep with his men until he was ordered off the field.
But he only stayed on the hospital ship for a few
days, and joined us again.
Captain Shout said to me before we went out at
Lone Pine, “ We’ll make a name for ourselves to-night,
Mac.” I was outed in the early part of the night, but
he made a name for himself alright. He was a Lieu-
tenant when going into the charge, made Captain next
day, gained the V.C. the next, and the following day
eternity. Here ended a noble and valuable life which
was sacrificed for his King and Country, and may you
and me and he be forgiven and rewarded by Him who
presides at the Great Court Martial.

Verses for First Battalion, A.I.F.
AUSTRALIA’S SONS are we,
Bred ’neath blue, sunny skies;
We’ll face the foe ! To battle go !
The enemy to overthrow !
Coo-ee ! Coo-ee-e ! Coo-ee-e-e !
Come, boys, fall into line!
What odds who falls, when calls ?
A hero’s death be mine !

THE TOAST
For Anzac Day.
THE Toast is ANZAC, gentlemen !
To Anzac, by the sea !
And all the heroes there that fought
to keep our country free !
The colours on their shoulders tell
a thousand stories true
Of steadfast courage, knightly faith,
and deeds of derring-do ;
Of vigils in the bloody trench,
throughout the frozen night ;
Of wild encounters underground,
where men like tigers fight;
They tell of noble charges, too,
thro’ hail of shrapnel made,
That earned for them their Fighting Name
“ Australia’s Light Brigade.”
The Toast is ANZAC, gentlemen!
To Anzac by the sea !
And every gallant lad that died
on far Gallipoli !
-—Who died for Home and Country,
and to keep old England free :
Who died for dear Australia, yes —
who died for Yon and Me!
The Toast is ANZAC, gentlemen !
As long as Time 'shall last
We need no costly monument
to keep their memory fast!
To those who lived !
To those who died !
Now, give them Three Times 1 hree !
The Toast is ANZAC, gentlemen !
On far Gallipoli.
S. Australia.

A.I.F. MEMORIAL.
THIRTY DAYS.
”QN July 1 the Repatriation Board conceded to the
organisers of the A I.F. Memorial movement per-
mission to collect through the whole State.”
‘“Now we have a bare month,’ said Brigadier-
General Jobson,”-—Quoted from the History of the
Soldiers’ Day.
“In thirty days I promise to pay’’;
Australia’s Note is drawn that way:
In Thirty Days.
There were men dropped shovel and tool and
pen
And “On Demand” they were promising then;
Shall we raise a monument to the MEN,
In Thirty Days?
In thirty seconds from “Over the Top”
Full many a cobber was seen to drop.
In Thirty Days
Can we, who live by their gallant grace,
Raise up a stone in their homeland place.
To tell of the Pate they dared to face?
In Thirty Days!
For thirty months, and for months again,
They fought and suffered in pride and pain.
Now Thirty Days
Are only given their land to build
A monument to the blood they spilled.
A last sad gift to the brave men killed—
Just Thirty Days.
Through thirty years will a lone heart ache
For him who died for his country’s sake.
In Thirty Days
Let the little thing we are asked to do
lOh! Think of what he has done for you!)
Be done in a spirit of friendship true,
In Thirty Days!
There are thirty reasons and thirty more
Why the thousands tally should reach three-
score
In Thirty Days.
And you who cared how the dead men died
As wonderful comrades, side by side.
Will build their Temple of Deathless Pride
In Thirty Days.
July g, 1918, DEL A MORE UeCAY.
