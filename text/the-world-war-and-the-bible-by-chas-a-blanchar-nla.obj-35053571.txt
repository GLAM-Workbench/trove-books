THE WORLD-WAR
AND THE BIBLE
By PRESIDENT CHAS. A BLANCHARD,
of Wheaton College, 111., U.S.A.
I desire at this time to seek to set forth as clearly
as I am able the place which the present world-war
occupies in the word of God. It is quite remarkable
that even men of the world, who have no personal
interest in Christianity, are satisfied that the present
age is a crisis time and that vast changes are im-
pending. All students of prophecy have had the
same feeling, with the added interest that study of
the word of God naturally gives.
In the word of God men are praised who give at-
tention to the signs of the times and others are
criticized because they study the weather, but do not
study the great changes which are going forward in
the progress of God's kingdom, among men. I de-
sire, therefore, to spendtthe time lend me on this
question. What is the position that the present
world-war occupies in the word of God? First, I
desire to get the setting of the war as clearly as
possible before you, and after that to spend some
time on the war itself.
The Last Days.
In i John 2: 18 the Holy Spirit, through the writer,
says that the believers of that time understood that
Antichrist must come, that even at that time there
were many antichrists ?whereby,? he says, ?we know
that it is the last time.? Three elements are very
prominent here, first, the period called the last time;
second, the fact that there were a large number of
antichrists, and third, that some one individually
was to come who should be called the antichrist.


If it was true in the days of John, the writer of
the Epistle, that men were in the last days, it cer-
tainly is true at this time. We are yet in the age
of the church. Some would prefer to say, the age of
the Holy Spirit. No new period has intervened. If,
therefore, the world was in the last days in the times
of John, the world is still in the last days and some
eighteen hundred years farther along in the period
so designated than it was at that time.
I therefore adopt a statement made by some care-
ful Bible students who say that the latter days are
the period between the first and the second coming
of the Lord. His coming to suffer and to set an
example, begins this wonderful time; His coming to
take away His church and destroy His enemies
closes it.
The special interest that Christians have respect-
ing the end of the latter days is the fact that when
that end comes, they will be caught away to meet
the Lord in the air and thereafter will always be
with the Lord. If, then, the latter days are soon to
close, the Lord is soon to come. When He comes
His church will be removed from the difficulties and
labors of the present life into the glory of personal
association with Jesus Christ, and after the brief
period known as the tribulation (the seventieth
week of Daniel) our Lord will return with His saints
to destroy His enemies and set up His kingdom on
earth. #
The Many Antichrists.
All persons and institutions which ignore or
antagonize Jesus Christ are antichrist, that is, they
are opposed to Him. John said there were many
in his day. All thoughtful people know that there
are many at the present time. When I was a boy
Protestants generally taught that the Romish church
was antichrist. There is no doubt but that the
Romish church is an antichrist. That is, the organi-
zation puts the sacraments of the church and the
office of human priests in the place which is, in the
teaching of the Bible, reserved for Jesus Christ him-
self. The invocation of Mary and the saints is
another instance of the same kind. ?There is one
God, and one mediator between God and men, the


man Christ Jesus,? i Tim. 2: 5. There is nothing
said about other mediation than this. For any
church to say that we need mediators between man
and Jesus Christ is an addition to Scripture, against
which we are warned in Revelation 22: 18.
Christian Science is another of the great anti-
christs of our time. The Romish church has the
characteristics of cruelty and boastfulness which
are assigned to antichrist. Christian Science has the
characteristic of denying that Jesus Christ is come
in the flesh. It denies the existence of matter which,
of course, renders the bodily existence of Jesus
Christ an impossibility. Denying His physical exist-
ence necessarily carries with it a denial of His
crucifixion. If His body was ?an illusion of mortal
mind,? so must have been His crucifixion, and if
He was not crucified, He did not ?bare our sins in
His own body on the tree? (1 Pet. 2: 24). All the
Scriptures which teach that He suffered for our
sins, that He was made a curse for us, that we are
justified through His blood, all these Scriptures are
simply fictions, fables, falsehood. It is true that a
great many Christian Scientists would be horrified
if they knew that this was true, but their ignorance
does not change these essential facts.
All persons know that crazy individuals are claim-
ing deity in our day. In our own state we had, not
long since, a woman who declared herself to be a
reincarnation of Jesus Christ. She was the wife of
a minister, was herself a Bible teacher for many
years, yet when this demon took possession of her
she got up before an audience and declared her
relation to God and told the people that if they
desired to offer worship it would be accepted. Her
successor was a vile man, was finally driven out of
the state because of his vices. He made the same
claim that she did.
Even now there are many antichrists. Of course
the worship of the world, of money and of pleasure,
all these things are also antichrists.
The Antichrist.
The antichrist, however, is not an antichrist, but
a dark, powerful, desperate person who becomes
the head of all the anti-christian forces of the ages.


He is the one in whom are summed up the charac-
teristics of all the many antichrists which have been
in the world from the days of John to the present
hour. This antichrist is to be a ruler. He is to
make an agreement with the Jewish people by the
terms of which he is given authority and they are
given freedom to re-establish their religion. His
throne is to be in Jerusalem and from this center
he is to rule his wicked world.
The Word of God also teaches that after three
and a half years of this covenant the antichrist is
to break his agreement. Instead of allowing the
Jews to worship their God and practise their re-
ligion, he is to take his place in the temple of God,
show himself to be God (that is, declare himself to
be God) and forbid the Jews to worship as he had
agreed they might.
?Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming
of our Lord Jesus Christ and by our gathering
together unto Him, that ye be not soon shaken
in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor
by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the
day of Christ is at hand. Let no man deceive you
by any means: for that day shall not come, ex-
cept there come a falling away first, and that
man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;
who opposeth and exalteth himself above all
that is called God, or that is worshipped; so
that he, as God, sitteth in the temple of God,
showing himself that he is God. Remember ye
not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you
these things? And now ye know what with**
holdeth that he might be revealed in his time.
For the mystery of iniquity doth already work:
only he who now letteth, will let, until he be
taken out of the way. And then shall that
Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall con=ï¿½
sume with the spirit of His mouth, and shall
destroy with the brightness of His coming: Even
him whose coming is after the working of Satan,
with all power and signs of lying wonders. And
with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in
them that perish; because they received not the
love of the truth, that they might be saved.?
2 Thess. 2: i-io.


The whole period of seven years from the rap-
ture of the church to the destruction of antichrist
will be a time of tribulation. This evidently must
be for the church being removed, Satan being
yet at liberty, and all satanic force being stimu-
lated by their approaching destruction, there must
be a time of tribulation.
For the Jews, however, the last three and a half
years will be ?the time of Jacob?s trouble,? for when
antichrist sits in the temple of God and shows him-
self that he is God, requires them to cease from
their worship which he has permitted (Dan. 9: 20-27),
the Jews, who have always had martyr blood in
them, will refuse to worship him, will insist upon
the covenant which they had made with him and
will pass into a period of persecution such as the
world probably has never known. This time of
Jacob?s trouble will end when the Lord descends
with His saints and His angels to destroy His
enemies and take possession of the world, which is
His rightful heritage (2 Thess. 1: 7-10), which is His
by right of creation, by right of redemption, and
will then be His by right of conquest.
At this time the beast, that is antichrist, who sums
up in himself all the beastly characteristics of god-
less governments and the false prophet, who sums
up in himself all the lies, deceptions, pride and
cruelties of Christless religions, will be cast into
the lake of fire. Satan will be bound and shut up
in a pit for a thousand years and Jesus Christ will
reign on the earth with His saints (Dan. 7: 21-27).
The Millennium.
This thousand years is designated as the millen-
nium. The exact period is mentioned six times in
the twentieth chapter of Revelation alone. The
characteristics of this time are given by Isaiah in
the nth and 12th chapters and in the 35th chapter.
There are other intimations of this golden age which
is before us. Paganism puts its golden ages in the
past. Christianity puts its golden age in the future.
This golden age we call the millennium?the thou-
sand. years during which the beast and the false
prophet* that is godless governments and false re-
ligion, are, in the lake of fire while Satan is in the


bottomless pit, bound with chains and secured that
he may not deceive the nations of the earth.
I have tried thus far to give you the setting of
the present world-war, to show you where, accord-
ing to the Bible, it comes in and what are its pur-
poses. Let me now pass to the question more
directly. First, I remark that in connection with
the millennial age there are revealed one great sheaf
of wars and two tremendous battles. These con-
flicts occur before the tribulation, during the tribu-
lation and after the millennium.
Wars Before the Rapture.
The word ?rapture? is so familiar to all students
of the Bible that I need only remind you that by
that expression we designate the coming of the Lord
for His church. It refers to the teaching that when
He does come the church will be caught away to
meet Him in the air. These wars are described in
the 24th of Matthew, the 13th of Mark, the 21st of
Luke and incidentally in other places. The teach-
ing respecting them in Matthew is found in the
24th chapter, where the Disciples asked our Lord
what was to be the sign of His coming and of the
end of the age:
?And Jesus answered and said unto them,
take heed that no man deceive you. For many
shall come in My name, saying I am Christ; and
shall deceive many. And ye shall hear of wars,
and rumours of wars; see that ye be not
troubled: for all these things must come to pass,
but the end is not yet. For nation shall rise
against nation, and kingdom against kingdom:
and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and
earthquakes, in divers places. All these are the
beginning of sorrows.?
?Immediately after the tribulation of those
days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon
shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall
from heaven, and the powers of the heavens
shall be shaken. And then shall appear the sign
of the Son of man, in heaven: and then shall all
the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see
the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven,
with power and great glory. And He shall send


His angels with a great sound of a trumpet; and
they shall gather together His elect from the
four winds, from one end of heaven to the
other.?
These words indicate convulsions of nature, the
coming of the Lord Jesus Christ in the clouds of
heaven and the sending forth of His angels to gather
His elect from all quarters of the earth, and in the
33rd verse the Holy Spirit says, ?So likewise ye,
when ye shall see all these things, know that He
is near, even at the doors.? R.V.
Read the corresponding portions in Mark 13 and
in Luke 21, where there are many similarities and
a few striking additions.
Armageddon.
When these pre-tribulation wars began many
persons raised the question respecting Armageddon.
They wished to know whether or not this was the
beginning of Armageddon. The answer is unques-
tionably ?no.? The battle of Armageddon is dis-
cussed in the 16th of Revelation from verses 12 to
16. The account reads as follows:
?And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon
the great river Euphrates, and the water thereof
was dried up, that the way of the kings of the
east might be prepared. And I saw three un=
clean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth
of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast,
and out of the mouth of the false prophet. For
they are the spirits of devils, working miracles,
which go forth unto the kings of the earth and
of the whole world, to gather them to the battle
of that great day of God Almighty. Behold I
come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and
keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and
they see his shame. And he gathered them to*
gether into a place called in the Hebrew tongue
Armageddon.?
The question respecting the drying up of the
Euphrates is one of some difficulty. Numbers of
careful Bible students believe that by that name is
here signified the Turkish Empire, and that the
drying up of the river symbolizes the disintegration


of the Turkish power. All students of history are
familiar with the fact that the Turkish Empire has
been in process of disintegration for years. It has
lost Roumania, Bulgaria, Montenegro, Servia, and
is now the merest fragment of what it formerly
was. I may say that without possessing certain
knowledge, it is my judgment that the Bible students
who thus teach are correct.
Then God says, through His servant, that three
unclean spirits like frogs came out of the mouth of
the dragon, that is the devil, and out of the mouth
of the beast, that is beastly government, such as we
see in the world to-day, and out of the mouth of
the false prophet, that is out of the mouth of the
pagan religions which teach that men can be saved
by works without the blood and intercession of
Jesus Christ. The Holy Spirit goes forward to say
that these unclean spirits are the spirits of devils,
that they have power to work wonders, and that
they go forth to gather the kings of the earth to the
battle of the great day of God Almighty, and then he
says, in the 16th verse, that he gathered them to-
gether in the place called in the Hebrew tongue
Armageddon. This great event comes, as you ob-
serve, after the sixth angel poured out his vial upon
the great river Euphrates, that is the Turkish Em-
pire, and this is an intimation that the Turkish Em-
pire will not be totally destroyed in the present war,
which is not a war of the tribulation, but one of the
wars preceding the rapture of the church.
The third great struggle of the millennial period
is described in the 20th of Revelation. You find the
record in that chapter from verse 7 to verse 10. It
is an account of the destruction of Gog and Magog.
This ruin comes, as the word clearly says, a thou-
sand years after the battle of Armageddon, which is
described in the 16th chapter.
At the close of the thousand years of peace and
righteousness Satan is to be loosed out of his prison
house and permitted once more to deceive the sons
of men, the nations of the earth. He gathers them
to battle and God destroys them by fire from heaven.
The ruin of Gog and Magog is ascribed to God alone.
In the battle of Armageddon the kings of the earth


war and in the wars which precede the rapture of
the church titanic struggles go forward between vast
armies created by the nations, nation rising up
against nation and kingdom against kingdom.
One of the public men of Great Britain recently
said, apparently without any thought of the Scrip-
ture in his mind at all, ?This war is not like any
preceding wars. Other wars have been wars of
armies, this is a rising up of nation against nation,
kingdom against kingdom.? Thus apparently with-
out purpose he confirms the very word which God
has spoken respecting the world war which now
goes on.
If I have not been mistaken and the setting of
the present struggle is substantially as indicated,
we are now ready to examine briefly the character
of the present conflicts, and first.
The Judgments of the Nations.
This is beyond doubt a time when the nations are
being judged for their sins. Individuals who rebel
against God suffer in this world and in the world
to come, but nations have no souls and must receive
their punishment here. One who has studied the
history of mankind even a little knows how cruel
and miserable has been the history of nations. Kings
and princes have slaughtered individuals with-
out mercy or justice, and from time to time vast
armies have been called forth to take the lives of
one another. These armies have always been com-
posed of the poor. The officers and rulers have
usually been a handful of nobles who have lived
in luxury and vice on the labors of the common
people.
It is a general fact, also, that the powerful
nations have oppressed the weak ones and the un-
speakable cruelties which in dungeons, in harems,
and on battlefields have been inflicted upon the
miserable nations of the earth, cannot be described
or even imagined. That is why the Holy Spirit calls
kings beasts and why the nations are represented
by great ravenous animals who delight to live by
the destruction of those who are peaceable and de-
fenceless. The lion kills the antelope; the tiger kills


the donkey or the deer ; sheep have always been law-
ful plunder for beasts of prey and just so, kings
and princes from the beginning until now have
revelled in the ruin of those who were not able to
defend themselves.
Still further, the nations have forgotten God.
They not only have been inhuman, but they have
been impious. These two sins naturally go together.
They have gone together and they still do. It is
not true that all impious nations have been inhuman,
but it is necessarily true that all inhuman nations
are impious. Take the condition of the Jews for
the last eighteen hundred years and the outrages
which have been inflicted upon them by the strong
peoples of the earth. Take the history of the Congo
land; of the native races of Africa in general for
the last fifty years. Missionaries, at peril of their
lives, opened this dark continent and beastly kings
and traders rushed in to take advantage of the dis-
coveries which they had made.
Our own country has been graciously saved from
the cruelties which have been a common place
among the older nations of the world. Our sins
have been forgetfulness of God, the worship of
material good, loving pleasure more than we love
God, trampling His holy day under foot and adjust-
ing society so that the rich and strong have the
advantages of government, while the poor and ignor-
ant and friendless bear its burdens. I think no one
who has read the history of the nations of the
world can look upon this present war without feel-
ing absolutely certain that God is at this time
judging the nations of the earth.
Pay, Pay, Pay.
We often think of the word of the great Lincoln
respecting our own civil war. He said : ?Fondly do
we hope, fervently do we pray that this conflict may
soon cease, but if it must continue until every dollar
won by the bondsmen?s two hundred and fifty years
of unrequited toil is spent in the awful struggle,
and until every drop of blood, drawn by the lash, is
paid with a drop of blood drawn by the sword, still
we must say that the ways of the Lord are true and
righteous altogether.?


Men who have never given a penny to make the
world pure and clean are now giving thousands and
millions of dollars to wipe out the record of its sin
in human blood. Men who have had no interest in
the circulation of the Bible, no interest in missions,
no care for building churches or schools where
Christ is honored, these men are now pouring out
their money like rain to buy shells and cannon and
rifles and all the horrible paraphernalia of war. Men
who have ground the faces of the poor that their
own sons and daughters might live in luxury and
idleness are now seeing those sons and daughters
slain or dying of starvation or wandering fearfully,
outcasts, where a little while ago were mansions
and parks and all things that give delight. ?Still
we must sa,y that the judgments of the Lord are
true and righteous altogether.? If only people, our
people could learn this lesson that God is dealing
with the nations, that the blame for this state of
things is not to be settled upon one people alone,
but that God is judging men for sin, and if people
would repent and humble themselves before God,
then the judgment might be averted.
Nineveh was as cruel and base as any nation of
modern Europe or America. Nineveh was not so
much at fault, because she had not so much light
and when an honest prophet warned her of her
doom, she repented and was spared for one hundred
and fifty years. There is, however, so far as one
can judge, very little repentance in our own nation
or among the nations. Criminations and recrimina-
tions are the order of the day. ?You are a liar and
you are another. You are a murderer and you are
another.? ?You are a thief and you are another,?
is the common talk between the nations of the
world.
If we could have an hour of honest submission to
God and humility before Him, the course of history
might be changed, but there is little light along the
lines which are at present being pursued. God is
trying to teach the nations of the world that if they
sin, they must pay. If they go to Tarshish, when He
sends them to Nineveh, they will have to settle for
the fare.


If on.y God would give us a Jonah whose voice
could be heard, someone to walk up and down the
bloody streets of the nations, to cry out to them
about their sins, it seems that there might be hope,
but just at present the prophets who clamor seem
to be the false prophets who encourage men to sin,
and prophesy ?Peace? to those who are in rebellion
against God.
Who Will Win?
When the war opened I read General Bernhardi?s
?Germany and the Next War.? So far as I could
understand him, he taught that wars were not only
justifiable, but virtuous ; that peace was not only
foolish, but wicked; that the slaughter camps of the
world were the places where advances in Christian
life and civilization were to be expected. With this
as a broad, general principle, laid down, he discussed
his theme, ?Germany and the Next War,? and so far
as I was able to understand, taught that Germany
had a civilization which was superior to that of
other peoples, that she was confined within too nar-
row limits, and that she must make gains by wars
against her neighbors. I think this was clearly his
teaching. It seemed to me also that he intimated,
if he did not affirm, that Germany was the only
nation in the world which was fitted to rule all the
nations and that Germany would do so. I knew if
this was really the spirit of Germany, that Germany
must be defeated in the end, for the Bible teaches
clearly that there will never be another world em-
pire until Jesus Christ is here to reign.
In Daniel, chapters 2 and 7, the Holy Spirit clearly
declares that when Assyria, Medo-Persia, Greece
and Rome have finished their work, the kingdom of
Jesus Christ will be set up among men and that that
Kingdom will be the last of all the world empires
we shall ever see. All attempts which are made by
men to set up world empires must necessarily fail.
It is only a few years since the holy land was
destitute of Jews. For a number of years this sad
people rushed in, rebuilding the old places and tak-
ing possession of the valleys until it seemed that
the holy land was speedily to become a Jewish pos-
session. Then came the war and the famine, until


now' the Jewl; have- beeii very largely expelled by
one necessity 'or another from- the home of their
fathers. The unbelievers used to say the Jews never
can get possession of the holy land, and when they
saw them rushing in they said, maybe they can;
and now that they have been rushing out, they may
supposedly swing back to their first declaration, but
all the while the Word of God has said, clearly and
firmly, that the Jewish people are to return to the
holy land, that they are to occupy and control it,
so that this nation, which has for so many years
carried its sad faces and its weary feet from land
to land, will have again the heritage of Abraham,
Isaac and Jacob.
?Be Ye also Ready.?
We shall sadly fail of God?s purpose for us unless
we learn from this frightful struggle what we ought
to learn from all the providences of God, that His
w r ord is true, that those who obey it will be pros-
pered and those who disregard it will be destroyed.
It was not by accident that our Lord said so
solemnly to His disciples, when they were asking
Him about the end of the age and He was telling
them that these things that we see must come, that
He then said to them, ?Be ye also ready, for in such
an hour as ye think not, the Son of Man will come.?
The question for my hearers is, after all, a per=
sonal one, not so much who is to blame for this
world war, as ?Do I have in my heart and life the
sins which have brought about this struggle and
which must, on some scale, large or small, produce
for me the evils which are filling the world with
tears and blood?? It is to be hoped that a great
multitude will be led to self=examination, to repent=
ance, to faith and obedience by the fulfillings of
Scripture which go forward before the eyes of the
world.
If we are saved people we can lift up our heads
and rejoice, for we know on the testimony of the
Almighty that these things have been fore-ordained
and that when they are concluded, our King will
come and the church militant will become the church
triumphant.
