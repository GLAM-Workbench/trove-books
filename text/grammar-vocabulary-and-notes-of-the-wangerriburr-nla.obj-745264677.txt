Wangerriburra Tribe.
ORTHOGRAPHY.
The System of Orthography used in recording the language is, with very slight modifications, that adopted
by the Royal Geographical Society for use in connection with native names of places.
The chief points in this system are—
(l) The actual sound of the word is taken as the basis for spelling.
(2) For the few sounds not conveyable by this spelling, an approximation only is aimed at.
(3) The vowels are pronounced as in Italian, the consonants mainly as in English.
(4) Every letter is sounded.
Hereunder are the letters with the sounds for which they stand :
Letters.

Voivels :—a .
as “ a ” in “ father.”
e .
as “ e ” in “ fen,”
i .
as “ ee ” in “ beet.”
o .
as “ o ” in “ mote.”

as “ oo ” in “ boot.”
Short Vowels :
When the consonant following the vowel is doubled
the vowel sound is shortened.
Example —“ but ” is sounded as the word “ boot”,
“ butt ” as “ butt.”

Accent :—Words of two syllables when ending in a vowel are accented on the first syllable ; when ending
in a consonant the two syllables are equally sounded.
Words of three syllables generally have the accent on the first syllable, with a secondary accent on the last
syllable if the word ends in a consonant. In words with vowel endings the accent is often on the penultimate.
The acute accent is used to mark exceptions from these rules.
THE GRAMMAR AND VOCABULARY OF THE WANGERRIBURRAS.
The grammar and vocabulary of the Wangerriburra tribe —commonly known as the Albert tribe—of
Australian aboriginals, together with various particulars about them, have been compiled from information
supplied by John Allen, whose aboriginal name is Bullumm.
Bullumm is a highly intelligent half-blood aboriginal, and is almost the last of a once numerous tribe.
He is perhaps the best educated and mod intelligent of his class in Australia. He speaks excellent English,
reads fluently, writes well, and is conversant with all the common topics of the day. He is a thorough bushman
and a pioneer of Western Queensland. As showing his reliability and capacity, it may be mentioned that he
was at one time in receipt of £I,OOO a year for mail-carrying contracts with the Queensland Government. From
boyhood he has been almost constantly in the service of the Collins family, and now lives at Mundoolun Station,
in the midst of the country once hunted over by his ancestors.
The feat of memory which at the age of over 60 recalls the since unspoken language of boyhood is wonderful,
and, so far as I know, unprecedented. It has been hard and unaccustomed work for Bullumm, this searching
into”the recesses of the brain for the loved but long unused language. Personally, as compiler, lam absolutely
sure of Bullumm’s thorough honesty in giving the information. Many a word has been puzzled over for weeks ;
others for months ; some are still in the limbo of the elufive.
Bullumm left his tribe when about 12 years of age, hence it is not to be wondered at that the many
inflections of verbs used by his. then elders cannot now be all well remembered. A haziness surrounds the finer
shades of meaning in this class of word. We were careful, however, to rigorously shut out all doubtful memories,
and to give place to none but clearly remembered words. Therefore it should be borne in mind that the Wan-
gerriburra language as here given is not thoroughly complete either in grammar or vocabulary. It will be found,
however, much fuller in both particulars than the great majority of similar records.
The Wangerriburra tribe occupied the country in the ba in of the middle Albert River and the headwaters
of the Coomera River. Their territory stretched from Cedar Creek on the north to the Macpherson Range on the
south ; and from the Birnam Range on the west to the Upper Coomera and Nerang watershed on the east. It
contained the well-known Tamborine Mountain. Its greatest length from north to south was 33 miles, its greatest


breadth, 15 miles. This small district was, however, one of the most favoured portions of Australia. The ever-
running creeks and rivers, the mountain scrubs and forests, the river flats and rich plains were the haunts of
abounding animal life, and account for the fact that the Wangerriburra people were among the best developed,
both physically and mentally, of the Australian blacks.
The tribe had long out-grown cannibalism. They loathed the practice, and, in union with their immediate
neighbours on east, west, and south, who also abstained from human flesh, they kept up a simmering warfare
with the cannibalistic tribes of the Brisbane River and the country to the north thereof. The simmer at times
became a boil-over, and Bullumm has vivid recollections of graphic descriptions by the tribal storytellers to the
assembled tribes, of the great battle at Yerongpilly, where the allied forces of the “ Progressive ” tribes from
the Tweed to the Logan routed with great slaughter the Brisbane River blacks.
Bullumm has read carefully and with great interest the writings of the late Mr. Tom Petrie on the customs
and habits of the blacks, and con iders the descriptions true and realistic. They may be taken to apply equally
to the Albert blacks, excepting those parts relating to the cannibal and burial customs.
Mr. Petrie’s description of the Bora quite fits the doings of the Albert tribe, excepting that in the Albert
district fights very rarely took place at Bora time.
Bullumm has also witnessed the Bora among the Maranoa blacks, whose ceremony, called “ cumba,”
was much the same as that of his own people, only the enclosures.used were oval instead of round.
The Wangerriburra tribe is now almost extinct ; and the process of extinction was sad and harrowing to
the unhappy natives. Bullumm remembers many a mournful day when the cruel hand of civilisation pressed
harshly upon them ; when the black troopers raided their camps, murder and rapine being the fate of the victims,
and wretched hiding in swamps and scrub the luck of the survivors.
About his earliest impression of things was when a party of his tribe was surprised by troopers at Mount
Wetheren. The blacks —men, women, and children—were in a dell at the base of a cliff. Suddenly a body of
troopers appeared on the top of the cliff and without warning opened fire on the defenceless party below.
Bullumm remembers the horror of the time, of being seized by a gin and carried to cover, of cowering under the
cliff and hearing the shots ringing overhead, of the rush through the scrub to get away from the sound of the
death-dealing guns. In this affair only two were killed, an old man and a gin. Those sheltered under the cliff
could hear the talk of the black troopers, who really did not want to kill, but who tried to impress upon the
white officer in charge the big number they had slaughtered. This police raid—one of many—had the usual
excuse : the blacks had killed cattle and therefore had to be taught to let the cattle alone.
Bullumm refers very feelingly to the very tragic end of Nyajurn (= not see), a poor old fellow-tribesman,
blind from birth. The Wangerriburras treated such unfortunates with the utmost care' and kindness. A lad
was always told off to lead the blind man about. The hunters shared their best with him ; the yam-digger and
the honey-gatherer brought him their finest and sweetest. When camp was changed, his was the first hut
to be built ; when danger threatened he was the first to be guarded. He was sightless, but the whole tribe saw
for him, and loved him while they pitied him.
The accursed thing happened on the bank of Nerang Creek in or about the year 1857. A party of
“ Alberts,” among whom was old blind Nyajum, was there camped on a visit to their friends and neighbours of
the Nerang and Tweed. There had been a charge of cattle-killing brought against the local tribes, and someone
had to pay. The police heard of this camp, and, under command of Officer Wheeler, cut it off on the land side
with a body of troopers. The alarm was given. The male aboriginals plunged into the creek, swam to the other
side, and hid in the scrub. The black troopers again were bad marksmen —probably with intent—as the only
casualties were one man shot in the leg and one boy drowned. The old blind man had been hidden under a pile
of skins in a hut, but was found by the troopers and dragged out by the heels. The gins told the troopers he
was blind from birth. The troopers begged the officer not to order the poor fellow to be killed. The gins crowded
round Wheeler imploring mercy for the wretched victim ; some hung on to the troopers to prevent them firing.
But prayers were useless ; Wheeler was adamant. The gins were dragged off or knocked off with carbines, and
the blind man was then shot by order of the white officer.
Another story. About 1855. A German woman and her boy were killed at Sandy Creek, Jimboomba,
near where is now the McLean Bridge, by a blackfellow known as “ Nelson.” The murderer was coming back
from Brisbane on horseback and met the woman and boy on the road walking to Brisbane. The man was
caught soon after committing the crime, but escaped from custody. He was a Coomera black, but sometimes
lived with the Albert and Nerang tribes. The black troopers knew this, and were constantly on his tracks but
never caught him. They had no scruples in shooting any blacks in the hope that the victim might be the escaped
murderer. From 30 to 40 blacks were killed by troopers in this way, but “ Nelson ” died a natural death in spite
of it all, some years after in Beenleigh.
In those days of the early settlers, many of the whites treated the blacks with kindness, but harshness
predominated. Bullumm thinks that no good could result by recalling the many memories of cruelty, oppression,
and bloodshed of his early days. The few given will serve as samples. The station, the dairy farm, and the
sawmill now occupy the once happy hunting grounds of the dispossessed and all but extinct natives.
The Wangerriburra dialect belongs to the “ Yuggum ” division of Eastern Australian languages, the
language being usually named after its word for “ No.” The Yuggum language is, according to Dr. Lauterer,
spoken from the Albert River as far south as Grafton, and has many dialects. The Wangerriburra speech, though
referred to by philologists as a “ dialect,” differs so much from other Yuggum dialects that the ordinary man
would be forgiven if he called it a language. Comparatively few words are the same, and, though many can
be derived from the same stem, the great bulk of the words are different. They differ as French does from
Spanish, rather than as Somerset does from Yorkshire. An Albert blackfellow knowing only his own “ dialect ”
could not understand the speech of a Nerang man.
As a matter of fact, the blacks were clever linguists, and most were able to talk passably well in several
dialects. The rule of the tribe, however, was that children were not permitted to speak in any language other
than their own. Bullumm says that in spite of this rule he soon got to know his mother’s tongue, and also to
speak the dialects of the neighbouring tribes.
The collection of words of different languages given below will give an idea of' the resemblances and
differences of Australian speech. It will be noted that some words, such as “ two ” and “ eye,” are almost the
same ; while others, like “ one ” and “ water,” are very different.

Wangerriburra, in common with all Australian languages, having no written characters and no literature
except the songs and legends of their glee-men and storytellers, must needs have been in a very liquid condition —-
able to flow this way and that according to the ever-varying influences of time, place, and people.
Like our own Saxon tongue when “ Good King Alfred ruled the land,” Wangerriburra had full inflections
for its nouns and pronouns. It had lost the “ dual plural ” (the special word for two persons taken together),
but shows traces of the loss being recent by its use of a compound pronoun when two persons are referred to.’
It seems strange, though after all it is nothing but natural, that the Australian blackfellow should to-day u o a
word which the ancient Greeks, as well as our own Saxon ancestors, had equivalents for. The Saxon said “ wit,”
meaning thou and I.” We now say “ we.” Many Australian languages have an equivalent for our old “ wit.”
In Kamilaroi it is “ nulle.” Wangerriburra had lost it, but used the compound “ ngulli-wallo ” (we-thou),
reserving “ ngulli ” (we) for use when referring to more than two persons.
Wangerriburra nouns are very fully declined, having one form for nominative and accusative cases and
separate endings for genitive, dative in “ to,” dative in “ for,” ablative in “ with,” and ablative in “ from.
There is only one declension. The pronouns follow the plan of the nouns. The gender of nouns is shown some-
times by different words, but more often by the feminine suffix “ gunn.” Nouns are not declined for number.
The plural is formed by affixing numeral adjectives.
I regret that I was unable to obtain the full conjugation of the verb. Bullumm was not sure of the very
finely graded verb forms, though he remembers in a vague way that endings he could not bring to mind were in
use by the superior men of the tribe. There are distinct forms of the verb for the indicative present, past,
perfect, and future tenses. The future tense form is also used as a progressive or continuous form. The infinitive
present and the imperative present were identical with the indicative present. There was no change in the verb
for number or person. The tense endings are fairly regular, but the stem of the word is so often modified that
I have found it necessary to give the parts of each verb, that those changes may be preserved. The future tense
is rarely used without an adverb to more exactly show its actual time significance. (See also pp. 31-34.)
Adjectives are compared by adding comparative adverbs equivalent to “ much, more, most,” or “ little,
less, least.” There are no comparative affixes but these. Adjectives could be used before or after nouns, or could
be used as adverbs. Adverbs might be classed with adjectives, as they —if their meaning allow —may be
similarly compared and used.
The plan of building sentences is delightfully simple, and depends, like the initial spelling of Pickwick’s
“ Weller,” on the taste and fancy of the speaker. We can say with equal correctness :
“ Neule yangala dimunnba mobo.”
(He will go to the camp to-morrow.)
or,
“ Dimunnba mobo neule yangala.”
Any other order will do almost equally well, hence “ composition ” is an easy matter.
There is no verb ‘ to be.” Its use is supplied by its absence. “I am hungry ”is conveyed by “ Ngaio
gubberri (I hungry). To put a “ tense ’ into this sentence, an adverb would be used, as, “ Ngaio gubberri
mobobo ” (I hungry yesterday).
Many words can be used as verbs, nouns, or adjectives as desired. For instance, “ talngai ”is the adjective
*“ bright,” the noun “ flame,” or the verb “ light.” We are of course quite used to this kind of thing in English :
the word “ light ” for example.
Some of the words are obviously and interestingly derived :=Nyunga-i (day) = suntime ; inala (night)
= rest-time ; gumera-gubi (vein) = blood-pipe ; moro-garrara (beak) = long nose ; dugunn (west) = up ; djui
(east) = down. These last two words are obviously “ imported,” as the rivers of the district run north. (See
Map.) The word for “ kick ” means “ hit with foot,” “ Love ”is rendered by “ soften ” or “ bleeds,” which
latter may be poetical if taken to mean “ my heart bleeds for you,” or otherwise if it has to do with the love-
charm of a waddy.
The blacks were duffers at arithmetic, and did not regard it as of much importance. Wangerriburra
counting was very primitive. “ One ” was “ yabru ” ; “ two ” was “ bula ” ; “ three ” was “ bula-yabru ” :
“ four ” was “ bula-bula,” and so on. Some of the extra clever ones were able to count in “ fives ”or “ tens ”
by means of “ dunngunn ” the hand, which of course stood for “ five.” They easily got out of their depth
though, and then it was “ a big lot.”

NOUNS. ’
Number : —Plural number is shown by adding certain adjectives according to the degree of plurality
desired. The actual number is put when needed. The adjeotives u ually used are —
wallull = many
kurrull = more
kurrull-bungil = most of all
Example—
mibunn = an eagle
mibunn bula = two eagles
mibunn wallull eagles (or many eagles)
Gender : The feminine is generally formed by affixing “gunn” to the masculine.
Example—
mnynm = son ; muyumgunn = daughter,
neubung = husband ; neubungunn = wife,
kulum = orphan boy; kulumgunn = orphan girl.
In many cases the feminine is expressed by a different word.
Example—
cagohn = brother,
nanang = sister,
biung = father,
waijung = mother.
Case ; The nouns are fully inflected by means of affixes to show the relationships for which the following
prepositions are used in English : —“ Of, to, for, from, with.” The nominative and objective (direct) are, as in
English, the noun in its simplest form. The noun forms for the plural are the same as in the singular.
(see “ Number” above). There is only one declension, which is quite regular with the exception of a modification
of the genitive, hereafter explained. As the cases are very similar to those of Latin, the case names of that
language will be used.
Declension.
Mibunn = Eagle (animal).
Singular.
Norn. mibunn = eagle.
Acc. mibunn = eagle.
Gen. mibunnya = of an eagle.
Dot. mibunnba = to an eagle.
Dat. mibunngo = for an eagle.
Abl. mibunnbaia with an eagle.
Abl. mibunnbano = from an eagle.
Plural.
Nom. mibunn-wallull = eagles.
Gen. mibunnya-wallull = of eagles.
(And so on).
Note. — Plural is formul by ailing wallah, or otlicr suitable adjective, to the complete singular.
Tullei = tree (thing).
Note. — Neuter nouns take the affix “najil” to form the genitive, instead of the affix “ya,”
otherwise they are declined as other nouns.
Singular.
Nom. tullei = tree.
Gen. tulleinajil = of a tree.
(The rest is similar to “ mibunn” as above).
Molumm = boy (person).
Note.— Personal nouns take “ ya ” or “ najil ” for the genitive affix, the difference in their use being that “ ya ” sliov s
presvil genitive—something owned now ; while “ najil ” shows past genitive something ovned long ago.
Singular.
Nom. molumm = boy.
Gen. (pres.) molummya = of a boy.
Gen. (past) molummnajil = of a boy.
(The rest is similar to “ mibunn” as above.)
Example —
“ Gulli molummya konggong jungumm.”
(This boy’s skull (is) hard).
This refers to the skull of a living boy.
“ Gulli kong-gong molummnajil kobungil.”
(This skull of a boy (is) old.)
This refers to the skull of a boy long dead,


ADJECTIVES.
Adjectives may be used before or after the nouns they qualify. They may be used after verbs.
ADVERBS.
Adverbs are placed near the verbs they qualify.
Both adjectives and adverbs whose meanings admit of comparison are compared in the same way.
Positive.
Comparative.
Superlative.
gumai (= big)
gumai-guile
gumai-bungil
baugull (= good) . .
baugull-guile . .
baugull - bungil
thung (= badly) . .
thung-gulle
thung-bungil
bijung (— little)
bijungai
(probably a contraction
of bijung-gulle, which
bijung-bungil
is also used.)
The quality can be made stronger still by adding two “ bun gib.” The quality is lessened by using
“ bijung ”= “ little” and its parts after the word.
The affix “ jumm” is in very common use as a negative.
Example—
gubberrijumm = not hungry.
Verbs.
The verb is the most unsatisfactory part of this grammar and vocabulary The reasons have already
been given. There are four parts to each verb given in the vocabulary.
The simple form of the verb corresponds to our use of the verb as a present infinitive ; also to our use of
it as indicative mood, present tense, in all numbers and persons ; also to our use of it as imperative mood, present
tense.
Example—
(l.) Present Infinitive :
Ngaio goenbunnei yana bullungi.
(I invite to go you.)
(2.) Present Indicative :
Neule yana barang. Molumm-wallull yana.
(He goes now). (The boys go.)
(3.) Present Imperative :
Yana !
(Go !)
The past tense ends in “ en” or “ ni,” and is usually formed by affixing those syllables to the present.
Sometimes, however, the affix takes the place of the last syllable of the present tense.
The perfect tense is formed in “ iari” in almost all cases.
The future tense, which is also used as a progressive form, has a variety of endings chiefly terminating
with “ la.” The future tense usually has some adverb accompanying it to show clearly the degree of futurity.
Example :
Ngaio gaiala mobo = I shall hunt to-morrow.
