Messrs. HENRY S. KING & CO’S
BUSINESS CIRCULAR.
We invite special attention to the fact that our Houses
at London, Liverpool, Bombay, and Calcutta are identical
in interest and responsibility, although, for the sake of
convenience, the business is conducted at each place under
a slight modification of name. The Indian and Liverpool
Houses are subordinate to the London Firm, which ex'er-
cises a supervision over their affairs, and acknowledges a
direct responsibility for their transactions.
The services which we oiler to those entrusting their
business to us may be briefly detailed as follows.
BANKING DEPARTMENT.
We receive Money to the credit of Current or Deposit
Accounts, in the former case issuing Cheque Books and mak-
ing payments in accordance with instructions, occasionally
or at regular intervals, for payment of School Pees, Insur-
ance Premium, Club Subscriptions, &c. We allow interest
upon money placed on deposit for fixed periods, in sums of
not less than £lOO, at rates which can be ascertained upon
application.
We issue Circular Notes and Letters of Credit which can
be negotiated through Bankers in all the Chief Cities
throughout the World.
We issue Bills of Exchange, payable in India, Europe,
the United States, and Canada, and purchase approved
Bills at the best current rates. Foreign Notes and Coin
are exchanged at the rates of the day.
Telegraphic remittances are made through our Branch
Firms and Correspondents abroad.
We also undertake the Purchase and Sale of Government
Stock, East India, Colonial, and Foreign Bonds, Railway

payable abroad, purchased or collected at maturity.

AGENCY DEPARTMENT.
In this Department we undertake the receipt and
remittance of the Pay of Naval, Military, and Medical
Officers (whether under the Home or the Indian Govern-
ment), the allowances of Civilians and Members of Eccle-
siastical Establishments, the Pensions of Widows and
their families, and every other description of Pay, Pen-
sions, Eund Allowances, and receipts payable by the
Government in respect of the Services; the custody of

Office or on board the Steamers. (See page 9.)

London Bankers.

Wines, Provisions, Plate, Glass, China, Cutlery, &c., Arms,
Accoutrements, Band Instruments, and Clothing, and all
kinds of household and personal requisites, at the Co-opera-
tive Store prices for cash in hand.
The requirements of families from abroad about to set
up housekeeping in England, are carefully attended to, and
arrangements made for complete furnishing upon favorable
terms for cash, or upon the hire-purchase system for those
who desire credit.
Catalogues of various classes of Goods are issued at
frequent intervals, and will be forwarded on application.
All New English Books are supplied, for Cash, at a Dis-
count of 25 per cent., or Threepence in the Shilling off the

PASSAGE DEPARTMENT.
In this Department we engage passages by P. & 0. and
all other lines of Steamers; furnish intending Passengers
with complete information regarding the expense and
relative advantages of the various routes to different parts
of the World; supply Plans, carefully select Berths, and
secure passages on the most favourable terms, particularly
for families or Parties.
Special attention is paid to the grouping of Passengers
desiring to travel Second Saloon, in which good accommo-
dation is now provided by the P. & 0. Co., and by all the
best lines, at very low rates.
These arrangements are made without any charge for
trouble or correspondence, at the same rates as are charged
by the Companies direct.
A copy of our “ Travellers’ G-uide,” with full information
useful to Passengers to India, China, and the East, will be
forwarded free on application.
Passengers leaving the Ports of London and _ Liverpool
receive the personal attention of our representatives up to
the time of their departure.

application, to ensure more prompt and certain delivery of
Baggage forwarded by Railway or other Public Conveyance,
and Insurances are effected at the lowest rates possible.
The collection of Passengers’ luggage in London is under-
taken, and, subject to timely notice being given, arrange-
ments can be made for its collection from residences within
a reasonable distance of any Railway Goods Station in
Great Britain. The Heavy Baggage of Passengers proceed-
ing to the East across Europe, should be shipped by the
corresponding steamer from England, so as to await their
arrival in India or elsewhere, or to meet them at the
appointed place en route.
Passengers proceeding across the Continent, may be
furnished with Circular Notes, Railway Tickets and Hotel
Coupons, and all information as to the routes to Marseilles,
Trieste, Venice, Brindisi, Naples, Genoa, and other Ports.
65, Cornhill, and 45, Pall Mall, London.


FORWARDING DEPARTMENT.
Next in importance to purchasing goods on favourable
terms, is their conveyance to their destination at reasonable
rates. The organization which we have built up during
seventy years, enables us to accomplish this very advan-
tageously for our customers, and we make it a special
feature of our business to keep all shipping charges so low
as to compare favourably with those of other firms or of
any Association. Our ability to do this comes from the
fact that we transact our own shipping at the Ports of
London and Liverpool, so that we avoid intermediate
agency charges.
In connection with this Department, we receive Goods
and Parcels of every description for despatch to all parts of
the world, by the various lines of Steamers and by Sailing
Vessels.
The charges on packages for India may be prepaid to
destination, or collected on delivery as desired.
Our various Correspondents abroad arrange for the
further despatch, or for the shipment to England, of
packages entrusted to their care, but neither they nor we
undertake any responsibility as to packing or safe transit.
Forms of Declaration for Customs and Insurance are
furnished on application.
Marine Insurance is effected on moderate terms.
WAREHOUSING DEPARTMENT.
We have recently erected Premises with ample space
and facilities for Warelmusing Packed Goods and Baggage,
also Household Furniture and Effects. Estimates furnished.
Separate Lock-up Rooms are available when desired.
The Warehouses are furnished with a comfortable
Ladies’ Waiting Room, Lavatory, &c.
FIRE INSURANCE can he effected if desired; Uninsured
Goods are at the Owners risk.
65, Cornhili, and 45, Pall Mall, London.


IMPORT DEPARTMENT.
The Import Clearance and transmission of Goods and
Packages from abroad likewise receives our careful atten-
tion. Our Indian Branches make up despatches by frequent
steamers, consigned to our care for disposal in accordance
with the the senders.
We send our assistants to the various Docks in London,
and also to Portsmouth, Plymouth, and Gravesend, to meet
Passengers on arrival, deliver their letters, and attend to
their business generally, and special attention is paid to
Ladies, Children, and Invalids. Similar duties are dis-
charged by our Liverpool Branch for Passengers arriving
at that port. If desired, we recommend Hotels or private
apartments, and we keep for the reference of our Con-
stituents lists of Residences to be let, furnished or unfur-
nished, in various parts of the country, also Prospectuses of
Schools and Educational Homes.
Children travelling alone to England can be received on
arrival and conducted to the Home or School selected.
European and Native Servants will be placed in suitable
homes, and Engagements and Return Passages arranged.
Passengers Homeward from India are strongly recom-
mended to entrust to Messrs. KING, KING & Co., Bombay,
or Messrs. KING, Hamilton & CO., Calcutta, their keys,
together with a declaration as to Silver, Cigars, Tobacco,
Tea, or any articles liable to English import duty; also
instructions as to the destination of the packages. By this
arrangement the Passenger is saved time, anxiety, and
correspondence.
Our Indian Branches will forward to any applicant a copy
of our Handbook for Homeward-bound Passengers, and
full information respecting passages homeward.
At Port Said and Marseilles the Homeward-bound Steamers
will be boarded by a representative of the Pirm, who will
render to Passengers any assistance, information, or advice
which they may need. Passengers to or from the East
arriving at Brindisi will receive every assistance on appli-
cation to Mr. E. Dionisi, whose Office is on the Quay.

SI t fcilisil Hail
A Summary of News for India and the East.
Every Friday, 6d.; Annually, Post free, £1.10.4.
The Overland Mail is a copious and comprehensive
abstract of intelligence published weekly for despatch by
the Mail, and is carefully adapted to meet the require-
ments of residents in India, China, and the Eastern
Settlements. :0 ;
Under its present Editorship, the Paper has been re-
modelled and much improved; Social, Literary, and Political
topics are treated of in greater variety, and a carefully
prepared epitome of British Journalism renders THE
OVERLAND Mail a unique record of facts and opinions,
alike interesting, reliable, and useful.
In addition to the ordinary features of a Political,
Military, and Miscellaneous Journal, “ The Overland
MAIL ” is distinguished by the copiousness and accuracy
of its original intelligence affecting the Indian Services
and community, which does not find its way into the
English Journals, but is of first importance to the Anglo-
Indian reader. :o:
The Large Size of the Paper, with Two Supplements
(48 pages in all), allows space also for selected Leaders,
Extracts from the proceedings of the Houses of Parlia-
ment, especially those relating to Eastern affairs, Notices
of Public Entertainments, &c. One of the Supplements,
entitled “The Boudoir,” contains articles descriptive
of the London and Paris Fashions, with contributions
on subjects of interest to Ladies.
65, Cornhill, and 45, Pal! Mall, London.


81 \t |iail
Weekly, 6d., on arrival of Mails from the East,
Annual Subscription, with Home Postage, i 11.6.0.
The Homeward Mail is published within a few
hours of the arrival in London of the Indian Mail, and
contains a full reprint of the changes and appointments
under the Indian Government, with Lists of Passengers
by all lines of steamers arriving, or booked ahead.
It also gives a full abstract from Indian files of all the
latest Indian News, selection of the best Leaders on
current questions, and reports of leading events from
each of the Provinces.
Being carefully compiled from the press of India of
every shade of opinion, The Homeward Mail affords
the best abstract of Indian intelligence to Officers and
Civilians retired, or at home on furlough.
Under the head of “ Gup” are given the most interesting
social and personal items from the up-Oountry corres-
pondence of the principal Indian Journals. The Home-
ward Mail is also a valuable repertory of Indian opinion,
for British Statesmen, Members of Parliament, Editors
and Journalists, and all persons desirous of following
the course of Indian affairs.
The Homeward Mail is essential to Anglo-Indians
at home, being a compendium of intelligence arranged with
special reference to their requirements. It is the only
Paper of the kind now published in England.
65, Cornhill, and 45, Pail Mail, London.

NEWSPAPERS AND PERIODICALS.
NOTICE.
THE POSTMASTER GENERAL, BOMBAY, has
called attention to the fact that through the use
of “flimsy paper” for wrappers, or insufficient
care in fastening, “every week a number of
Newspapers and Book Packets are found with-
out wrapper or covering, and have to be
consigned to the Bombay Dead Letter Office.”
This is hardly possible under our system, which, though
highly costly to us, secures subscribers almost entirely
from any risk of not receiving their papers. No expense
has been spared in perfecting and carrying on this Depart-
ment of our business: the Addresses of Newspapers are
printed, and those of Magazines written on wrappers
specially prepared for our use, and made of a very tough
durable paper.
To those who pay in advance, discount at
the rate of 10 per cent, is allowed (the nett
amounts being shown in the second column of the
annexed List), thus enabling subscribers to enjoy the
special advantages of this costly system at prices which
will compare favourably with those charged by any other
respectable firm. No discount will, however,
under any circumstances he allowed, unless
the money due for the subscription is in
our hands prior to the date fixed for com-
mencing the supply.
Those who prefer the existing system can pay at any
time convenient to them during the current term for
which the subscription runs.
HENRY S. KING & 00.

INTRODUCTION.
Fox - many years past we have acted as Agents for the
principal Steamship Companies trading between England and
the East, and in that capacity we have made it our business
to afford to passengers information of the most varied character,
and have spared no pains to facilitate their arrangements.
The services which we render to outward passengers, in the
selection of Route and Steamer, Booking Passage, and Shipping
Baggage, are offered to homeward passengers by our Branches
abroad ; and at all the Ports of call en route our Correspondents
will be found ready to furnish to travellers any information
or assistance of which they may stand in need.
In the following pages we have endeavoured to furnish such
details of interest to passengers as can be comprised in so
small a compass, and for the guidance of those who have not
previously gone over the ground, we give particulars of the
principal ports of departure and arrival, and those usually
touched at by all or some of the Lines of Steamers. In order
to group the places mentioned in a consecutive manner, we
have connected them with the movements of the P. and O.
Steamers, but it will of course be understood that the local
information equally applies to passengers by all other Lines
of Steamers calling at the same ports.
In issuing this Pamphlet, we are influenced by the hope
that those passengers into whose hands it may come will entrust
to us any business in which they may find it necessary to
employ an Agent, and afford us the opportunity of supplying
their various wants during their stay in England, and upon
their return to the East.
6t>, Cornhill, and 45, Pall Mall, London.


For Homeward-bound Travellers. /
To prevent misunderstanding as to the nature of our connec-
tion with the various Firms named in this Hand Book as
our Correspondents abroad, other than our Branches, we desire
to state that, while recommending them as Agents, we can
accept no responsibility with regard to any engagements that
may be entered into by them.
To those who contemplate returning to India or other parts
of the East, we offer our services, reminding them that the flow of
passenger traffic to and fro being so much regulated by climatic
influences, it is necessary for those who intend to sail from
England during the months of September, October, November,
and December, to arrange with us to engage their passages as
far in advance as is possible. There are frequent occasions on
which Steamers sail with every available berth taken up ; and
in any case, those who prudently book in advance, have a choice
of berths of so wide a range as to make all the difference
between certain comfort and possible discomfort. Eor ladies
and families we consider this a most important point, and
one upon which it is impossible to lay too much stress.
At page 91 will be found the rates of passage money charged
by the various Lines of Steamers, conveniently arranged for
the purpose of comparison. It should be mentioned, however,
that the fares are always subject to alteration, and by some
lines occasionally susceptible of arrangement, and we would
therefore suggest early communication with us, in order
that we may obtain for intending passengers the benefit of
any possible reduction. No extra expense is incurred by
passengers engaging their berths through us or our Branches.
Henry s. King & Co.
In offering to intending passengers the accompanying Hand
Book of information, we beg to place at their disposal our
best services in all the arrangements rendered necessary by a
voyage to England, and to tender them the services of our
London Firm upon arrival.

The following' suggestions may be found
useful to Travellers.
Cholera. —A simple remedy for Cholera and Dysentery
used in Syria by the natives, is Powdered Charcoal (made from
burnt bread) ; a teaspoonful of which, in a cup of sugarless
coffee is a good daily dose. Mosquito Bites. —For Ant,
Insect, or Mosquito Bites, bathing the parts in milk and vinegar
is a good corrective. Or, dissolve carbonate of soda in a tea-
spoonful of water ; warm over a candle, and apply. Or, touch
the bite with strong spirits of ammonia ; a phial of which for
the waistcoat pocket may be had of most Chemists for a shilling.
Pastilles made of nitrate of potash are recommended against
Mosquitoes. Water. —To clear Water, use a little alum
powder, or a few peach stones. Where water is suspected, boil
it, or make toast and water, or drink common wine, tea, coffee,
soda-water, or some other mineral water.
Harper's Bazaar publishes a method to obviate suffering from
noise which appears to be so simple that it is worth a trial,
and may prove a boom to nervous travellers, or those who are
liable to be disturbed by the noise of machinery at sea. “ If,”
says the Bazaar, “ the sufferer will take a bit of Spermaceti
Ointment of about the size of a pea, tie it up in a small square
of fine linen, and place deep in the ear, working it around till
it takes the shape of the orifice, leaving the end to hang out,
not a murmur of sound can be heard ; the atmosphere is sweet
and serene, the nerves are quite at rest, all exasperation is
subdued, and when the noise is over, or the necessary season
of quiet has been had, the little plug can be removed, the
murmur of the world allowed to return, and no harm done.”

|lrdimitmr|) Jlrmiigements.
Passengers are strongly recommended to entrust to Messrs*
King, King & Co., Bombay, or Messrs. King, Hamilton & Co.,
Calcutta, the engagement of passages and selection of berths*
No extra expense is incurred by adopting this course, and
our representatives are frequently enabled to assist a passenger
in securing satisfactory accommodation.
The fullest particulars as to vessels, upon the berth, dates
of departure, and rates of passage money, will be furnished
by our representatives upon application.
Our Branch Pirms will at all times obtain for passengers,
the most advantageous terms, and secure for them the benefit
of any possible reduction upon return journeys.
These Firms will also be happy to undertake the shipment
of baggage (subject to the regulations of the Steamship Com-
panies, and the conditions of their passage tickets), and will
attend to the despatch as cargo of any portion which it is not
convenient for a passenger to take with him. In many cases a
considerable saving can be effected by the shipment of heavy
packages as freight. The keys of such packages »should be
handed to them, together with a declaration as to Silver, Cigars,
Tobacco, Tea, or any articles liable to English Import Duty;
also instructions as to the destination of the packages ; by this
arrangement the passenger is saved time, anxiety, and cor-
respondence. They will also arrange for the insurance of
baggage, whether taken by the passenger, or shipped as cargo.
They will also, if desired, notify to us, by an abbreviated
telegram, the departure of any passenger who may wish the
fact communicated to friends, and has previously instructed
us on the subject; and will arrange for the transmission of a
coded telegram through us, to announce safe arrival.
Telegrams from any part of the world can be forwarded to
us under the address “ King, London,” and messages for
constituents can be sent through us, by pre-arrangement, at
a considerable saving of expense.
65, Corn hill, and 45, Pall Mall, London.


Messages sent to our care should indicate clearly the intended
recipient, and the name should form the first part of the message,
not of the address, which must he simply “ King, London,” unless
the word “ care ” is used.
In our Business Circular will be found a few coded phrases
which may be found useful, and save expense in the transmission
of a message. We are always pleased to be of service to our
clients and shall be happy to undertake the despatch of Telegrams,
but messages should not be sent through us without pre-
arrangement, as this course is so likely to lead to confusion.
The distances by P. & O. routes to Port Said and places
beyond, as given under the respective ports are those by
Steamer to London, calling at Brindisi, and by Steamer to
Brindisi and overland thence. The Marseilles route by sea is
69 miles shorter, and overland 55 miles shorter than the
respective routes via Brindisi, and the Naples route by sea is
188 miles less, and overland 74 miles more than the Brindisi
routes.
The following Table shows approximately the number of
days from the time of departure of a steamer from the Eastern
Ports, within which letters may be despatched from London,
with the expectation that they will meet passengers en route
at the places indicated.

Letters for Aden or Port Said must leave London on the
Friday immediately preceding the time shewn, when it does
not actually fall upon that day
As none of the P. & O. Company’s steamers now call at Suez,
passengers by them should request their friends not to address
letters or telegrams to that port.
65, Cornhiil, and 45, Pall Mall, London.


Letters to be delivered to passengers at Malta should be
addressed to the care of Messrs. Turnbull Jr. & Somerville,
20, Strada Reale, Valletta ; at Port Said to Messrs. Henry S.
King & Co. ; at Marseilles to Messrs. Henry S. King & C 0.,.
26, Rue Noailles ; and for other ports to the care of the agent
of the steamer, indicating the port and date of departure of the
passenger, and it is recommended that the sender’s name and
address should be written on the back of the envelope, so as
to avoid the opening of the letter at the Post Office, in case of
non-delivery.
Letters for delivery to Homeward-bound Passengers on
arrival at Portsmouth, Plymouth or Gravesend, should be sent
to the care Messrs. Henry S. King & Co, 65, Cornhill, London.
For delivery at Liverpool they should be addressed to the
c/o Messrs. King, Baillie & Co. at that place.
We shall be glad to receive and record in our books the
Addresses which will find passengers after arrival at home.
Letters are constantly being sent to us for persons with whom
we have no account, and in many cases we are obliged to return
the letters to the Post Office, all endeavours to trace the
Addressees having proved fruitless. A Form for Registration
of Address will be supplied by our Clerk, who boards the
Steamer on arrival.
Our Indian branches will be happy to supply Circular Notes
for use at the various ports touched at en route, and at all the
principal cities of the world. They will also arrange, if desired,
for the transmission of funds through us by mail or telegraph.
“ The Homeward Mail ” (see page 108) contains the latest
Indian News and Official Gazettes, and lists of Passengers
booked by the various lines.
Members of the Indian Services arriving in England on
Privilege Leave can have “ The Homeward Mail ” regularly
posted to them each week, for any period desired, by forwarding
stamps or Postal Order, at the rate of 6cL per copy, with Name
and Address to Messrs. Henry S. King & Co., 65, Cornhill,
London. A post card, conveying timely notice of change of
address, will insure the correct despatch of the paper to sub-
scribers who are visiting or travelling from place to place.
65, Cornhill, and 45, Pall Mall, London.

The P. & O. Co. now have a weekly service to and
from Malta, via Brindisi, thus bringing this Island
within 90 hours of London.
For arrivals or departures by mail or other vessels,
the charges are as follows ;
In the Great Harbour, 6d, and 3d!, for luggage, per boat.
In the Marsamuscetto Harbour, Is., and 6 d. for luggage,
per boat.
Five passengers without baggage, or two passengers
with light baggage, is the legal boat capacity.
Boatmen attending P. & 0. steamers should be
instructed to land passengers at Marsamuscetto Steps,
or expense for carriage hire to Valletta will be
incurred, and passengers be otherwise imposed upon.
Passengers from steamers in the Grand Harbour
should direct boatmen to land them at the Custom
House, so as to obtain readily the protection of the
police in the event of imposition, which is not
infrequent.
Any disagreement as to boat hire should be referred
to the Marine Police Inspector on duty.
These can be engaged by pre-arrangement, and
are of service in enabling visitors to make the best use
of their time in sight-seeing. The plans of Valletta,


which are distributed free of charge by our Boarding
Clerk, will, however, enable passengers to dispense
with their assistance in most instances. When steamers
arrive at or after sunset they are, of course, quite un-
necessary. If engaged, they should be instructed to
escort passengers first to 20, Strada Reale, where
letters or telegrams may be awaiting the visitor,
Messrs. Turnbull, Junr. & Somerville issue
cards monthly to respectable guides, which are with-
drawn in case of complaint, and passengers are
cautioned against those guides who cannot produce
cards for the current month.
Carriages. These can be hired by the hour at the following
rates :
2-horse carriage, 2s. Brf. per hour during the day.
„ ~ 3s. bd. ~ from sunset to sunrise
1-horse ~ 1«. 6 d. „ during the day.
„ ~ 2s. 'Ad. ~ from sunset to sunrise
but an understanding should be arrived at before
hiring.
Shops. Visitors should see that the articles required are
marked plainly in English money. Respectable shop-
keepers adopt this plan. Others do not, for obvious
reasons.
Hotels. Great Britain, Imperial, Morrell’s, Grand,
D’Angleterre, Royal; all in Valletta. Imperial,
at Sliema.
Circular Notes. Our notes are cashed by Messrs. Turnbull Junr.
& Somerville, 20, Strada Reale, Valletta, but pas-
sengers wishing to draw on their respective Bankers
should provide themselves with letters of credit.
Messrs. Turnbull Junr. & Somerville forward
purchases, baggage, &c., to any part of the world at
moderate rates, and undertake the execution of com-
missions entrusted to them. (Telegraphic Address :

The Theatre Eoyal, situated near the Porta Eeale,
is a very fine building ; during the opera season, from
November Ist to May' 31st, operas are performed by
an Italian company nightly, except on Sundays,
commencing at 8.30 p.m. Boxes, 6 tickets, from 15s.
to 255. Stalls 3s. each.
The Manuel Theatre, situated in the centre of
Valetta, is also open during the season for operatic
performances.
There are so many objects of interest that the
difficulty encountered by a passenger landed for a
few hours is to choose the places he will endeavour to
see in the time. The principal buildings are, the
Governor’s Palace, formerly the palace of the grand
masters; the principal rooms are open to visitors at


all times. The Armoury is 253 feet long by 38 broad, and
contains a quantity of armour and weapons, some dating back to
a time previous to the removal of the knights from Rhodes to
Malta. The Church of St. John is a magnificent building,
recently restored at great cost; the first stone was laid in 1573,
and the Church was consecrated in 1578.
The Garrison Library, the Public Library of the Knights,
numerous Churches, &c. are well worth a visit. The large
hotels of the knights, called Auberge de Castille, Auberge de
France, &c. are now occupied as officers’ quarters.
Citta Yecchia, 7 % miles from Valletta, was the capital
of Malta up to the time of Grand Master La Yallette, and
there the Catacombs and Roman Yilla, lately discovered, can be
seen. The Cathedral is situated there, and the view from the
bastions is extensive. The Gardens of S. Antonio, containing
a large number of orange trees, can be seen on the way ; the
palace formerly belonged to the Grand Masters, but is now appro-
priated to the Governors.
A Railway from Valletta to Citta Yecchia, touching at
S. Antonio Gardens, is now open.
Malta is famous for its lace, and gold and silver filigree work.
Inferior qualities, the refuse of the shops and machine-made
imitations are brought on board the steamers by very persistent
salesmen, who give the passengers no peace, and will, after a
good deal of chaffering, accept much less for the articles offered
than the prices originally named. For the convenience of those
passengers who require really good lace, &c., and object to pay
extortionate prices, and do not care to go through the process
of beating them down, Messrs. Tdknbull Junr. & Sombkville
keep an assortment of the best Prize Medal Maltese lace, coral,
and filigree jewellery, &c., which they have manufactured at
the lowest possible prices. Everything is marked in plain figures,
but a discount is allowed according to importance of sales.
Here also supplies of cigarettes, Havannah cigars, and tobacco
can be obtained free of customs’ duty; the Kaisar-i-Hind
Cigarettes are the best procurable on the island, but as there
are so many inferior imitations of these excellent cigarettes,
passengers are informed that they can only be obtained at 20,
Strada Reale. Malta is used, to a great extent, as a depot
for Marsala, a wine which is very largely used by visitors,
owing to its purity and cheapness.

more than a stroll through the town and lower fortifications, a
few purchases being made at the shops as temptation falls in
the way. Gibraltar being a free port, there is no duty on
tobacco, a supply of which for the remainder of the voyage
can be procured at a reasonable rate.
At Gibraltar the latest newspapers are placed by us on board
the homeward steamers for the use of passengers.
Leaving this port, the steamer proceeds through the Straits,
passing on the starboard hand the Spanish Town and Fortress
of Tarifa, marked by a lighthouse ; on the left is seen the Moorish
Town of Tangier, and shortly afterwards the bold headland of
Cape Spartel, with its white lighthouse, indicating the north
western point of the great African Continent.
On the right is Cape Trafalgar, also marked by its Pharos,
while in front is the so-called Bay of Trafalgar, celebrated by
Nelson’s crowning victory.
Passing the Bay and City of Cadiz, a run of 16 hours brings
the ship to Cape St. Vincent, rounding which, her head is
pointed to the northward, up the coast of Portugal. Lisbon,
Oporto, and Vigo, are successively passed, and after a run of
100 miles, Cape Finisterre is reached, and the steamer heads to
the north-eastward across the Bay of Biscay. This is crossed
in an average time of 34 hours, bringing the vessel to Ushant,
and a further run of 100 miles places the expectant passenger
in sight of that marvel of modern engineering skill, the new
Eddystone lighthouse, near which the Plymouth Pilot comes
on board, and, under his guidance, the anchor is shortly dropped
in Plymouth Sound. Here those passengers who are tired of
their long sea voyage, or are desirous of avoiding the Channel
passage, will land, and the ship immediately proceeds to com-
plete her voyage to London.

PLYMOUTH,
Population, 84,464.
Distance from London, by sea, 29S miles;
by rail, 24 6 miles.
The P. & 0. and B. I. steamers call here on the homeward
voyage for the convenience of those who may wish to avoid the
Channel passage, the railway journey to London occupying 6|
hours only, but passengers have the option of going on in the
ship to London, where every facility will be afforded them
by our representatives in their arrangements for the journey
to their ultimate destination.
One of our Clerks will meet each steamer on arrival at
Plymouth, to afford to passengers such information and assist-
ance as they may require, and to arrange for the clearance
and delivery or storage of their baggage on arrival at the
docks. Packages which passengers do not desire to, or cannot
conveniently, take with them, can be left in charge of our
representative for despatch by goods train.
At page 86 will be found a list of articles liable to duty,
the possession of which must be declared before examination
of the baggage. All such articles should be packed together
as far as possible, so as to avoid unnecessary disturbance of
the contents of the packages.
Passengers requiring services performed at Plymouth will
receive every attention.
Cask Our circular notes are cashed by Messrs. Pox, Sons
and Co. Millbay Pier, who will also (subject to a
telegram to us) cash the cheques of our constituents
against funds in our hands.

Dungeness, Dover, the South and North Foreland, all present
points of observation and interest. The estuary of the Thames
is marked by numerous shallows and sands requiring skilful and
careful pilotage, and after a run of 72 miles from Dover, Graves-
end is reached, when, if the state of the tide is unfavourable to
further progress, the remaining passengers are landed and con-
veyed by rail from Tilbury to London. If, however, the tide
serves, the steamer proceeds direct to the Royal Albert Dock,

OVERLAND.
The P. & O. express train with the mails leaves Brindisi about
an hour after the arrival of the Steamer. The sleeping car
tickets are issued by the P. & 0. agent at Bombay according
to priority of application, and they are frequently secured, by
letter or telegram, months in advance of the passenger’s depar-
ture, so that early application is desirable. The charge for these
tickets is £4 12s. in addition to the ordinary first class railway
fare, as shown on page 93.
It includes sleeping cars (with seats for up to 60 passengers)
which run through to Calais, and a restaurant car fitted with all
necessary appliances for cooking, meals being served in the
dining saloon, the whole being of the most modern description.
No travellers, excepting P. & O. passengers holding Ist class
railway tickets from Brindisi to London and sleeping car tickets,
are under any circumstances allowed to proceed in the train.
If the arrival in Calais does not correspond with the departure
of one of the regular Steamers, a special one is generally ready
(chartered by the Postmaster General), on which passengers
are now allowed to cross, on payment on board of 18.?. extra.
Intending passengers are recommended to communicate their
desire for berth to Messrs. King, King & Co., at Bombay,
as soon as they have decided upon their departure.
Children occupying a berth pay full fare ; Servants, whether
European or Native, pay the same fare as other passengers.
No luggage will be admitted into the Sleeping Car itself
under any circumstances whatever, excepting a hand-bag (which
must not exceed 20 inches long by 12 inches wide by 10 inches
high) and a bundle of rugs (this regulation being in the interests
of travellers), so that these may go in a space provided under
the sleeping berth. The bag, dec., taken into the car is usually
subject to examination at Modane by the Customs authorities.
There will, however, be a luggage van attached to the train
to admit of the conveyance of an ordinary amount of baggage
for each passenger, and all such baggage by this service must be
registered in Brindisi through to London. Such registered
luggage by this train only will not be subjected to any Customs
examination at all.
There are separate lavatories in the cars for ladies and
gentlemen, and separate compartments will be reserved for
ladies if required.

The distance from Brindisi to London is 1,459 miles, and
the journey occupies about 50 hours. The trains are started
by Borne time, 50 minutes before Greenwich.
From Turin to London passengers have a choice of trains and
routes, but the P. &. 0. express service is via Paris and Calais.
A convenient and attractive route is now opened from Brindisi
to London, by which the homeward passenger is enabled to
visit Naples, Rome, Pisa, Genoa, Turin, and Modane, and
express trains are run in connection with the arrivals of
the mail packets at Brindisi, by which the through journey is
accomplished in from 63 to 59 hours.
This route, while it offers a rapid through service to the
passenger to whom time is of importance, permits of a visit
to the most interesting cities of Italy, and is moreover the
only service having second class carriages throughout.
For particulars of the S. Gothard route, see page 83.
An agreeable alternative route from Paris is that by Rouen,
Dieppe and Newhaven, which connects with the services of the
L. B. & S. C. Ry., and is convenient for all parts of the
South Coast.
On the Italian railways there is no free allowance of baggage,
and the charge from Brindisi to Modane is 4s. 4 d. per 20 lbs.
In order to prevent detention of their baggage, passengers must
be present and ready to open their packages (whether registered
or not), for Customs examination, at Modane. Between Modane
and London, passengers are allowed 56 lbs. free, and all excess
is charged for at the rate of 6s. per 20 lbs.
Passengers should take note that even the smallest quantity
of tobacco carried for personal use, is subject to a duty upon
entering Italian territory, and travellers are bound to declare
at the Custom House the 'possession of any quantity, however
small, whether about their person or in their luggage. In
the absence of such declaration, any tobacco found is con-
sidered smuggled, and the owner or carrier of it is subject to
fine or imprisonment.
The Registration of Baggage saves the passenger from all
trouble and expense of landing and shipping the baggage and
conveying it between the Train and Boat, Harbour Dues, and
other imposts hitherto made. This Registration may be made
to the place of destination, or from any Station to any other
Station on the Continent at which the Through Ticket allows
the traveller to stop; but where the traveller intends to stop
short of the final destination shown by his Through Ticket,
he should register only to the first point at which he desires
to break the journey.

The Duties upon Tobacco and Spirits vary somewhat , according to description
and strength , and there is an additional charge of 1/. or 2/6 per gallon
(according to value ) on Sparkling Wines.
The following are prohibited :—Ealse Money, Extracts of
Coffee, Chicory, Tea, Malt, or Tobacco, Tobacco Stalks stripped
of the leaf, and Tobacco Stalk Elour, Copyright Books reprinted
abroad, Articles with marks or names imitating those of British
Manuf ac turers.
New and stringent rules have lately been adopted by the
Customs’Authorities in relation to the examination of Passengers’
effects upon arrival in the United Kingdom. Hitherto, when
luggage has arrived unaccompanied, it has merely been detained
until the owner or his agent could attend with the keys of the
packages. Now however, the examination, instead of being
the matter of form to which travellers have become accustomed
in England, is now conducted in a rigorous and searching
manner ; every package, however insignificant, being thoroughly
overhauled.
Upon landing at Continental Ports, and in passing the various
frontiers, there is an examination of baggage, even although
registered through, and it is advisable always to declare any
article believed to be liable to duty; it should be remembered also
that every Custom House Officer abroad can search your person
if he chooses. On the Continent, dutiable goods, packed with
articles of apparel, or otherwise concealed, are, as well as the
articles in which they may be placed, liable to seizure; and
travellers are warned that the seizure is strictly enforced unless
the examining Officer is informed of the articles being in the
package, and the goods duly declared previously to its being
opened.

Great Western Railway.
information for Passengers landing at Plymouth, and proceeding
thence by the Great Western Railway.
Steam Tenders meet each Steamer on its arrival at Plymouth, and con-
vey passengers and their baggage to the Great Western Docks, situated about
600 yards from the Great Western Railway Station at Millbay, and contiguous
to the Telegraph Office and the principal Hotels.
Passengers whose passage money includes the railway fare to London,,
will have a coupon ticket attached to their Passage Ticket which, after being
stamped at the Ticket Office at the Docks, will be recognised by the Servants
of the Great Western Company without further trouble to the Passenger.
Passengers, whose passage money does not include the Railway fare, can obtain
tickets on payment of the fares at the ticket office at the Baggage Ware-
house in the Docks, in exchange for Vouchers, to be obtained of the Shipping
Companies’ Agents at Plymouth. The fares cover the Dock Toll and all
services rendered in connection with the conveyance of passengers’ baggage
to the Baggage Warehouse, its examination there, and its conveyance to the
Millbay Station. The Fares for Ocean Passengers to London are 82s. (id.,
Ist Class; 225. 6d. 2nd Class; and 17s. 6d. 3rd Class.
Whenever the vessels disembark their passengers (and a sufficient
number of passengers land), railway carriages and luggage vans will be placed
opposite the Custom House at the Docks, so that passengers for the Great
Western Line may, after their baggage is cleared, take their seats and
proceed without change of carriage, vid Millbay Station to London, or any-
other Station en route at which the train stops.
The baggage is landed from the Tenders by the Company’s servants,
who convey it to the Baggage Warehouse, perform the unpacking and
repacking required for the Customs’ examination, and convey the baggage
from the Custom House to the Great Western Railway Station.
After the examination of the baggage at the Custom House, the
Company’s servants will register and label it to its destination, if on the
Great Western Railway, thereby relieving the passengers of all trouble in
connection with it until the termination of their journey, when the baggage
will be given up in exchange for the registration tickets. In London, the
Company will, if required, deliver the baggage to any address at a
moderate rate of charge.
The Tickets from Plymouth to London are available for seven days from
the date of issue, or, in the case of through coupon tickets, from the date of
arrival at Plymouth, and passengers travelling to London by Great Western
Railway may break their journey at any Main Line Station en route, pro-
vided the journey is completed within that time. Application for the
necessary authority to break the journey must be made to the Ticket Clerk
at the Docks, or to the Station Master at the Millbay Station.
The fast express train leaving North Road Station (which is J of a mile
from Millbay Station) at 2.5 p.m., performs the journey to London in
5 hours 40 minutes.
The 2.15 p.m. and 3.50p.m. trains from Plymouth to London (Paddington)
perform the journey in 6 hours 10 minutes and 6 hours 18 minutes respective-
ly, and the 8.35 a.m. train from Plymouth to London performs the journey
in 6 hours and 18 minutes. Through carriages are run between Plymouth
and London on all through trains. Special trains will run whenever there
are a sufficient number of passengers, and will be timed to start from the
Millbay Station as soon as practicable after the arrival of the vessels.
