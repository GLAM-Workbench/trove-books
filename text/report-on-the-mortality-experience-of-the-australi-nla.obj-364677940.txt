To the Board of Directors
of the Australian Mutual Provident Society.
Gentlemen,
In the Sixth Quinquennial Report on the affairs of the Society issued in 1879,
I intimated that an investigation would be forthwith undertaken to ascertain the rates of
mortality prevailing in the Society throughout the period of its existence. I have now the
pleasure to report that such an investigation has been completed, and the results will be
found set forth in the following pages. The experience embraces a period of 30 years, or
to be exact, from 21st February, 1849, the date when the first risk was undertaken, to 31st
December, 1878. The description of the processes by which the results have been
elaborated and the explanations which accompany each table will no doubt appear super-
fluous to the professional reader, but as the Board decided that the chief results of the
investigation should be communicated to the members, it appeared to me proper to avoid
as far as possible all technicalities and to treat the subject in a manner which would render
intelligible to the general body of our members a question in which they can scarcely fail
to feel a deep interest. There are many points connected with the vital statistics of the
Society upon which I have not yet touched, but as they are more or less of a technical
character, they will form the subject of a separate publication for the benefit of those
engaged in the business of life assurance. The points alluded to comprise— w the effect
of the medical selection on the mortality; W the varying rates of mortality among the
holders of different descriptions of assurances; (3) the rate of mortality as affected by the
amount of the assurances; (4) the mortality among female lives; ( s) the rate of discon-
tinuance of the policies by lapse and surrender. I also propose to furnish in detail the
preliminary data from which the principal tables given herein have been constructed, so
that the means will be afforded of observing the progression of all persons who have
entered the Society, under each separate age, from the date of entry up to the death or
secession of each, or up to the close of the observations. With these data at hand the
professional actuary will have the means of constructing numerous subsidiary tables and of
pursuing independent investigations in avenues which the absence of reliable data has
hitherto kept closed against him.
I have given a table exhibiting the data from which the mortality experience of various
life assurance societies has been determined, in order that the value of the data on which


our own rests may be seen and compared. The Mutual Provident experience may be said to
be both ample and meagre; it is ample for determining and testing one of the most important
practical questions that concerns the future business we may accept, viz., the rate of
mortality as affected by the duration of the assurances ; or in other words the question of
the influence of the medical selection on the lives within a short period after admission.
Bearing on this subject I wish to direct your special attention to the table on page 41,
shewing the rate of mortality per cent, per annum, and especially to the figures relating to
the years of assurance o to 4, inasmuch as our experience is comparable with a similar
table deduced from the experience of British offices, viz., the H M - Table. A like comparison
can also be instituted with the experience of the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New
York. On the other hand our experience for another purpose must be admitted to be
meagre and as yet imperfect. The number of deaths above the age of 61 is only 13;
when, therefore, that fact is taken into account in connection with this other, that at the
close of the period only 4 per cent, of the lives assured had died, it must be acknowledged
that the data are insufficient for a conclusive inference to be drawn respecting the duration
of assured lives above 60 years of age.
I deem it unnecessary to refer to the well known very great labour involved in the
construction of the primary and subsidiary tables necessary for the production of this
report, because I have had at command a thoroughly competent actuarial staff. It would
I think detract from the value of this contribution to the vital statistics of the Society, or
rather of the Australian Colonies, if I omitted to mention how much is due to my assistants,
Mr. Richard Teece and Mr. David Garment, in the preparation of the abstracts and
construction of the tables. I wish also to tender to these gentlemen my hearty acknow-
ledgments for the valuable suggestions made to me by them, and which I have incorporated
in this report. Their names are favorably known to the profession at home, and to those
who may wish to make use of the experience this guarantee for the accuracy of detail will
be acceptable, for the whole of the results have been checked and verified by one or other
of the assistants I have named. It only remains for me now to say and certify that the
facts relating to this Mortality investigation have been set forth with truth and accuracy.
In publishing this report (the first of the kind which has been produced in Australia)
for the benefit of its members and the public generally, the Society may fairly claim to have
made some substantial return for the large measure of success with which its operations
have been attended; while the additional information yet to be made public will form a
contribution to vital statistics both interesting and valuable to those for whom it is more
especially intended.
I remain, Gentlemen,
Your obedient servant,
Australian Mutual Provident Society,
Sydney , 30 th December , 1881.

Report by the Actuary
TO THE
BOARD OF DIRECTORS
OF THE
Australian |tlutual |jnumlcut Jludctu,
ON THE
Mortality Experience of the Society
FOR THE SO YEARS
1849 TO 1878.
To investigate the mortality experience of a life assurance society, it is essential to have
information regarding each life as to (1) the office age at entry, or the date of birth; (2)
the date of admission; and (3) the date and age at exit; likewise the cause of exit,
whether by discontinuance or death. The special circumstances connected with the
business of this Society, hereafter referred to, being considered, and in view of a separate
investigation into the comparative mortality (1) of the lives assured in the different
colonies; (2) of the healthy as compared with the rated-up lives; (3) of lives assured
for large as compared with those for smaller amounts; and (4) of those whose lives had
been assured for a term of years only, it seemed to me advisable that the following
additional information should be abstracted from the registers concurrently with the
primary details :
No. of Policy and where issued.
Amount assured and table under which policy was effected.
Name, place of birth, occupation, and place of death of life assured.
Assumed age, premium charged, and premium corresponding to real age.

What is known as the card system was adopted to collect the facts above described
with respect to each policy, the form of the card being as follows ;
The first step was to write up the cards, filling in the particulars with respect to each
policy from the renewal indexes. These particulars having been obtained once for all
the cards had simply to be arranged so as to get at the facts which had to be successively
classified. The chief advantages of this plan are that errors incidental to repeated tran-
scription of the details from the registers are avoided, and the processes of analysing the
facts greatly facilitated. White cards were used for male lives and pink for female and
non-participating policies were distinguished by a line ruled diagonally through the card.
The cards having been all written, were called over against the indexes, and were then


sorted according to the surnames of the lives assured, alphabetically first and subsequently
by a vowel arrangement similar to the method adopted by the Institute of Actuaries in
classifying the facts on which their tables of mortality are founded. The object of this
first arrangement was for the purpose of bringing together all cards representing policies
on the same life, where there were more than one policy on the same life, the cards were
placed in an envelope on the outside of which were recorded the particulars relating to the
oldest policy; except where one policy had become void before a subsequent one was
issued, in which case the policies were assumed to represent distinct lives. The analysis of
policies and lives classified as shewn in Schedule A on page 10 was not accepted as complete
until it was found that the number of cards written corresponded with the number of policies
issued up to 31st December, 1878. At that date the Society had issued 46,314 policies,
but as the investigation was to be on the basis of one assurance for each life, that is to say,
persons and not policies were to be observed, the number became reduced 1041,827. This
shews that the number of policies on each life was on an average 1.107, or about 11
policies to 10 lives—-a small proportion, but one which will doubtless increase with the age
of the office and the requirements of the members for additional assurance. From this
point in the investigation policies are ignored and lives only are dealt with . The whole of
the cards above described were then distributed into three classes—(l) lives existing at the
termination of the period; (2) lives discontinued by other means than by death; and (3)
lives cancelled by death. The figures in Schedule Bon pages 11 and 12 were entered up as
the cards were counted and shew the total number entering at each age and the numbers out
of each of such totals which were existing (at various ages) at 31st December, 1878, as well as
the numbers which had died or been discontinued up to that date. It will be observed that
the total number of lives here brought under review is 41,710 and not 41,827, the number
referred to above; the difference of 117 is accounted for by the omission of annuity
policies. The lives left assured at the termination of the observations were found to be
30,576, the discontinued 9446, and the number dead 1688. It will be noticed that the
41,710 lives that the Society has had at risk from time to time during the 30 years under
review became reduced to 30,576. In explanation it may be observed that a table
of mortality deduced from the registered experience of a Life Assurance Society is based
on the number of lives exposed to risk in each and every year throughout the period of
observation, and not merely on the deaths and those existing at the date when the experi-
ence was taken. Such an investigation also includes all lives which have been at risk
although discontinued, and consequently the number to be operated on is as above stated,
41,710, of which 39,282 were male and 2428 female lives, being at the rate of 16 males
to 1 female. No attempt was made to deduce separate results for male and female lives,
the number of the latter being altogether too small to admit of any reliable deductions.
In all the tables which follow , therefore, the figures refer to male and female lives combined.
The largest number of entrants was at the age of 30, at which age 1692 joined the Society.

of a mortality table. In deducing the rate of mortality ex-
perienced during any given period of a Society’s existence,
three assumptions are made : —first, that the lives enter the
office on an average in the middle of the calendar year in
which they are assured—an assumption which is no doubt a
very close approximation to the actual truth where large num-
bers are concerned; second, that the lives which entered at
each year of age were on the average admitted at the middle
of such year, that is to say all who were in their thirtieth year
of age on entering tl\e Society were really on an average of
the age of and therefore attained the exact age 30 at the
end of the calendar year of entry; and this may, for all practical
purposes, be taken to be a sufficiently close approximation to
the truth; third, that the lives which passed from observation
otherwise than by death in each calendar year did so on the
average in the middle of such year.
These facts being premised, the next process to be gone
through was to have all the cards under each age at entry in
each of the groups already referred to in Schedule B arranged
according to the age at exit. The table in the margin for age
20 will exemplify what had to be done with each age at entry,

284 18 from oto 74* I*- ma 7 rea< 3 thus : —At age twenty 1291
members entered, and at the close of the observations, 31st
December, 1878, 989 of those were still in existence, of whom 316 were still of the current
age, 20; 216 of age 21 ; 146 of age 22, and so on. There had been discontinued 284, of
whom 104 were discontinued at age 20; 128 at age 21, and so on. Eighteen had died, of
whom 3 died at age 20 ; 4 at age 21 ; 2 at age 22, and so on.
What is usually designated “Summary of Table of Observations” is furnished in
Schedule Con pages 15 and 16. It shews in column 1 the number entering at each age as
13


exhibited in Schedule B, and in columns 2 and 3 the number who have died and been discon-
tinued at similar ages; while column 4 shews the number remaining in force at 31st
December, 1878, at each age. Referring to Schedule C for an example, it appears that at
age twenty-five 1307 lives entered at various periods during the existence of the office; 9 lives
died at age 25, and included entrants at all younger ages who died at age 25; 245 were dis-
continued at age 25 of entrants at that and all younger ages ; and 635 were existing at age
25 on 31st December, 1878. Column 6 shews the number who entered on each year of life
irrespective of age at entry. The formation of this column was as follows: Of the 631 who
entered at current age one, 70 had either died, been discontinued, or were existing at 31st
December, 1878, before completing that age ; the balance of 561 completed age 1 and passed
on towards age 2, where they were combined with the 432 entrants of age 2, making 993 lives
who were under observation at current age 2 ; similarly of these 993 there were left behind
from death and other causes, 140 who did not complete age 2 ; the balance of 853 passing
over age 2 were combined with the 335 entrants at current age 3, making 1188 under
observation at that age. It therefore follows that the number against any given age in the
column headed “ lived ” indicates the total number of lives who in the course of the whole
30 years were under observation either for the whole or a part of that particular year of
age ; and this independently of the length of time they had been assured, or of the parti-
cular year in the Society’s history in which they attained the age in question. Thus, the
number in the column “ lived ” opposite age 30 includes all who entered at age 30, besides
those who entered at age 29 and were on the books for one year, those who entered at 28 and
were on the books for two years, and so on. And further it is thus apparent that it includes
in the same category many lives who were not by any means contemporaneous, for some of
them may have entered the Society at age 25 in the year 1850, and therefore entered on
their 30th year of age in the year 1855 ; while others may have entered at age 25 in the
year iB6O, and others again at age 30 in the year 1878, and so on. It also follows that the
same individual may appear in the “ lived ” column at a number of consecutive ages ; for
instance a person who entered at age 25 and died at age 35 will appear in the “ lived ”
column at all ages from 25 to 35 inclusive, but not subsequently. Otherwise, it may be
stated thus : the number in the “ lived ” column at any age is equal to the sum of all the
entrants at that and all previous ages, less the sum of those who have passed from observa-
tion at all previous ages ; for instance, at age 30 the number in the “ lived ” column, 6x69
is equal to the sum of those who have entered at all ages, from 1 to 30 inclusive —viz.,
17,037 —less the sum of those who have passed from observation at all ages younger than
30 —viz., 10,868. If all these lives had entered the office on the Ist January in each year
and the deaths and discontinuances had taken place on the 31st December in each year,
the total of this column would represent the number of years of life enjoyed by all the
members of the Society. But, as has been explained, these conditions do not hold in
practice, and the years of life enjoyed were arrived at by the process detailed in Schedule
D on page 18. This schedule shews the number exposed to the risk of death during a

complete year at each age as well as the numbers who died during each year, and was
formed fiom the the figures in Schedule C, as follows :
The 631 who entered at current age 1 are assumed to enter at regular intervals during
the year, so that each one is at risk on the average for half a year, or which is the same
thing, half the number are at risk for a whole year. A similar assumption is made in
the case of (hose discontinued, except by death during the year; the deaths are assumed to
take place at the end of the year
631 entrants of age 1 = 315.5 at risk for a complete year.
19 discontinued do. = 9.5 do. do.
Difference... 306.0 at risk for a year at age I.
and of this number 12 died.
To obtain the number at risk for a year at current age 2, we proceed as follows :
Entrants of age I = 631
Less: —
Dead 12
Discontinued ... 19
Existing at age 1.. 39 = 7° S^ l
432 Entrants at age 2 = 216 at risk for a year
64 Discontinued do. = 32 do. 184
Whence number at risk for a complete year at age 2= 745
and of the number thus exposed to risk 22 died. Similarly for each succeeding age. It
will be observed that the numbers exposed to risk stand opposite the completed age, or
age last birthday, and not at current age, or age next birthday, as in Schedule C. The
sum of all these exposures, 210,413, gives the total number of years of life enjoyed by all
members of the Society brought under observation. The agreement of this number with
the total of the column “ lived/’ in Schedule C, is established as follows
Total of column “ lived” ... = 235,991
Less Half entered ... 41,710=20,855
And Half discontinued 9,446= 4.723 25,578
Total number exposed = 210,413
A life, or mortality table, has been called a biometcr, for it gives the exact measure of
the duration of life under given circumstances, and represents a generation of men passing
through time. The elementary mortality table consists of three columns. In column x
age is expressed in years, commencing at o (birth), and proceeding to the extreme limit of
observed life time. Against each age, in column 2, are the numbers surviving out of,
say, 10,000 children born. And column 3 contains the number dying in each year.
In deducing a mortality table from the deaths occurring among a body of assured
lives, it is necessary to ascertain the number of lives exposed to risk of death at each age,

and the number of deaths which occur among such exposed lives. Schedule D supplies
this information in respect of all the lives brought under observation in this investigation.
If we divide the number of deaths occurring at any age by the 'number of persons exposed
to the risk of death at that age, we obtain the probability of dying in a year. Thus, refer-
ring to Schedule D, age 30, we see that there were 5649 persons exposed to risk, of whom
28 died during the year; the probability, or chance, therefore, that a person aged 30
will die within the year is T |-| f =.00496, and this quantity is designated by the symbol
and will be found in column 1, in Schedule E on page 20, opposite the age of 30.
In column 2 of the same schedule, and against the same age, will be found .99504, the
probability of a person aged 30 surviving one year, and this quantity is designated by
the symbol / 3Q ; the two quantities when added together give unity or certainty, for it is self-
evident that a person at any age will either live through or die during the year. When the
symbols p and q are employed without reference to any specific age, the suffix x ( q x , p x ) is
used. Now if we know the number of persons entering on any year of life, we can find the
number who may be expected to survive to the next highest year, by multiplying by the
quantity p lf, therefore, we assume, as in Schedule E, that we have brought under obser-
vation 10,000 children just born, we ascertain the successive numbers who may be expected
to complete each year of life, by multiplying continuously by the successive quantities in
column p x . It is not necessary that the number assumed at the commencement of the
table should be 10,000. Any other number would have answered the purpose equally well,
and the number 10,000 has been chosen merely in order to facilitate some subsequent
comparisons. It must be borne in mind, too, that the number 10,000 has no connection
with the number 306 shewn in Schedule D, as the persons exposed to risk at age o. The
column p x is deduced from the actual experience of the office, and the figures in column A,
Schedule E, merely shew what would have been the state of the case if the office had started
with 10,000 lives under observation at age o, instead of a different number at various years
of life. The two columns headed logp x and JogI x) have been used to facilitate the forma-
tion of column l x , and may be ignored by the general reader. Having obtained the
numbers living at each age, we obtain the number of deaths by subtracting the living at any
age from the living at the next youngest age, thus d^-=p o —^3l=Bo95 —8055=40. The
columns l x and d x as they appear in Schedule E, exhibit the unadjusted mortality table.
It will be observed that below the age of 20 and above the age of 65 the Table
exhibits great irregularities ; these arise from the paucity of numbers under observation,
and it may be fairly assumed that they would not exist, at least to the same extent, had
the numbers of living and dying at these ages been as great as they are at intermediate
ages. But even where ihe numbers are sufficiently large to allow of reliable deductions
being drawn, there appear irregularities which require to be removed or softened down
before the Table can be made available for practical purposes. 1 hese irregularities are
due chiefly to errors in the data themselves, such as mis-statements of age by the members,
which had not been remedied when the observations closed. It is necessary, therefore,
to make a correction for these accidental disturbances, and present the Table as it would

appear if none of them had been operative. This is done by a process of graduation, the
result of which is seen in the adjusted l x and d x columns in Schedule F, pages 22 and 23.
The adjusted q x and p x columns were obtained from these l x and d x columns in a manner
exactly similar to that explained on page 19. The column °e x shows the expectation of life
or the average number of years which persons of a specified age, taken one with another,
enjoy according to the experience of the Society. The total existence enjoyed at the
expiration of a year by those alive at any given age' at the beginning of the year, is equal
in years to the number who survive the year, added to the existence enjoyed by those who
die within the year; and of those who die within the year, it is probable that as many die
at equal intervals during the first half-year as die at the same intervals during the last half
of the year; or, in other words, that of those who die in any one year, taking one life with
another, it may fairly be assumed that on an average they each enjoy one half-year’s
existence. This will be plain from a numerical example. For instance—required the
number of years that a person aged 90 may expect to live.
No. living at age 90=1571.
Of 1571 living at age 90
1132 survived 1 year.

In the above example the sum of all the halves of the number of deaths is manifestly
one-half of the number who were alive at the age of 90. The expectation of life at any
given age can therefore be more readily obtained by dividing the sum of the numbers
living at all higher ages by the number living at the given age, and adding .5 or to the
quotient. + -'^— iS f^ + -i^^- i? -4+}S« 4+1.857-2.357.

In a similar manner the whole column may be formed, although a more expeditious
process, giving the same result, is usually adopted in practice.
With the data recorded in the preceding tables, the task of determining the rate of
mortality which has prevailed in the Society has been accomplished. In the columns


shewing the numbers living and dying at each age out of 100,000, assumed to enter at age o,
the probabilities of living and dying have been determined, and with the aid of these
columns the present values of annuities and reversions can be computed, and all the
questions having reference to the duration of human life solved. Further explanation as to
how the theory of probabilities is applied in the solution of such questions is beyond the
scope of this investigation. Before, however, passing to a comparison of the results at
which we have arrived with those of other tables, it may be well to explain that the applica-
tion of the theory is founded on two assumptions. “Of these the first is that the experience
“of the future will accord with that of the past; that is to say, that what ratio soever may
“have been found to exist in times past between the number surviving and the number
“ dying in a given time, out of a specified number of individuals observed upon, the same
“ratio will be found to subsist in time to come between the number living and the number
“ dying in the same space of time out of any given number of individuals similarly circum-
“stanced with the others. And the second assumption is, that the individuals, the
“ possibility of whose living and dying in any specified time may be in question, have all
“the same prospect of longevity with each other.”* Now as regards the first of these
assumptions, we can scarcely be justified in asserting that it will hold in the case of this
Society. When this office commenced business, its operations were practically confined to
Sydney and one or two country towns; no effort was made to push business, and the
amount transacted was ridiculously small, more in keeping with the transactions of a local
Friendly Society (which in fact it originally was) than a progressive life assurance society,
such as it has become. The Society now issues in a single year more policies than it issued
during the first fifteen years of its existence. Nor is this to be wondered at; for when it
was started the population of the Australian colonies numbered only 358,000, against a
population at the present time of nearly three millions. There was not a line of railway
laid in the Australian colonies when the Society was founded, and now they possess a net-
work of railways aggregating 5,000 miles in length. The consequence of this extension of
railways is that thriving towns and villages now exist in places which 30 years ago were
mere wilds, uninhabited, and almost unexplored by the colonist. The field from which the
business was obtained for half the period over which the observations extend was practi-
cally restricted to the towns lying within 100 miles of the eastern seaboard of New South
Wales, and to the city of Melbourne; while for the last half of the period the business has
been gathered from a population scattered over a territory more than 26 times the size of
Great Britain and Ireland, embracing an extent of country stretching almost from the
Equator to the 46th parallel of south latitude, and from the 115th to the 178th degree of
east longitude. The Society’s revenue, at the end of its 30th year, exceeded the total
revenue derived by the colony of New South Wales from taxation in 1849 (the year in
which the Society was founded); while the sum assured under the policies now on the
books of the Society is largely in excess of the entire public debt of the colony. Not only
the extension of railways throughout the colony, but the establishment of rapid communica-

tion with almost every part of the civilized world, has rendered easy of attainment the
luxuries and comforts of life which were altogether inaccessible at the birth of this Society,
and hence the conditions of life in Australia have changed very much during the last
generation. It can scarcely be possible, therefore, that the future experience of the Society
will be a reflex of the past, and for this reason I think it would be highly undesirable to
make use of the present materials for the construction of monetary tables for use in the
general business of the Society.
The value of the mortality experience of the Society will be better appreciated, and
more interest will attach to it, if I furnish the data on which other tables, as well as the ex-
perience of particular companies have been based. The schedule on page 27 contains a list
of all the tables that have been compiled exhibiting the law of mortality which prevails among
assured lives. In comparing the results at which we have arrived with those of other
tables, both the average age at entry and the average duration of the assurances have to be
taken into account. It will be observed that so far as regards the English offices the total
number of lives assured by this Society during the period under observation, viz., 41,7x0,
exceeds the number of lives brought under review in the Society which had the largest
number of members by 20,312. That was the Equitable Society of London, and at the
date of the observations it had been in existence for 67 years. The number living at the
termination of the observations in this Society was 30,576, and exceeded the number in
the Society having the largest membership among English companies by 23,646, and the
number in the Society having the smallest by 28,349. The number of deaths on which
the experience is founded, viz., 1,688, is no doubt limited, especially when taken in con,
nection with the small average duration of the lives; it is, however, larger than that of any
other English office, except the Equitable and the Law Life. The number of years of life
enjoyed by the members of this Society was 210,413, and was in excess of the number
enjoyed by the members of any English office with the exception of the Equitable Society
and the Law Life.
In the Table on page 27 the figures in column 9, shewing the average number of years
for which the members have been under observation, are found by dividing the “Number of
years of life enjoyed” by the “Total number of Lives assured during the period.” Thus
for example in the case of the Equitable we have 2 -|f;-|if =:l2,2 s- The average age
at entry is found thus:—multiply the number of entrants at each age by the age itself;
divide the sum of all these products by the total number of entrants —the quotient will be
the average age at entry as shewn in column 10.
The figures in column 11 shewing the percentage of void lives from all causes on
the total number of lives assured are found by dividing the sum of the numbers in columns 6
and 7by the number in column 4, and multiplying the quotient by 100. The experience
of the Mutual Provident Society compares most favorably with that of other companies in
respect of the permanent nature of the business, for it will be observed that while the
percentages of void business in the Scottish Amicable and New York Mutual (in both of

The table on page 28 shews the number of deaths which occurred in the Society among
persons exposed to risk between the ages of
20 and
79 and the number which would have
been expected according to each of the several standards enumerated.
In this table the
which the number of years embraced in the observations and the average duration of the
membership agree tolerably well with the corresponding data for this Society) are 37.36 and
32.64 respectively, that of the Mutual Provident Society is only 26.69.
The “ Mortality per cent.” is found by dividing the “ Number Died ” by the “ Number
of years of life enjoyed,” and multiplying the quotient by 100. Thus, to take the case of
the Equitable again as an example, we have irleVrra x 100=1.96.

numbers exposed to risk and the actual deaths are arranged in quinquennial groups. As
the whole number of years of life exposed to mortality was 192,848, and the nunjber of
members who died 1,558, it follows that the average rate of mortality was x 100=.8
per cent, per annum. Comparisons of the actual number of deaths with the estimated
numbers which w r ould have been expected according to other tables of observations can be
instituted when the probability of dying in a year is furnished. Thus the numbers exposed
in this Society in the group between the ages 20 and 24, and the probability of dying in
a year for the corresponding ages by the mortality table of the Mutual Life Insurance
Company of New Yoik are as follows

That is to say the actual number of deaths in the Mutual Provident Society was 46 against
63, the expected number by the mortality table of the Mutual Life Insurance Company
(N.Y.). The table on page 28 in its final results may be read thus : —Of the number of
persons exposed to risk of death in this Society between the ages of 20 and 79, 1,558 died,
whereas had the same number of persons been brought under observation at corresponding
ages from the lives assured either in the Equitable, Law Life, Economic, Gotha, Eagle,
or Mutual Life (N.Y.), the number of deaths would have been according to their mortality
tables respectively 2,381, 2,177, 2,243, 2,147, 3,125, and 1,753. A similar comparison made
with the Institute of Actuaries’ H M Table, the Seventeen Offices, the Carlisle, the English
Life, and the Northampton shews the expected numbers of deaths to be 2,301, 2,377,
2,524, 2,857, and 4,327 respectively. It will be observed that not only is the total number
of deaths in the Australian Mutual Provident Society much below that expected to occur
by any of the standards compared, but that with one or two trifling exceptions the number
at each group of ages is also smaller throughout.
It follows from the figures above quoted that the actual number of deaths in this
Society during the thirty years over which the observations extend has been only 67.7 per
cent, of the number which might have been expected according to the Institute of
Actuaries’ H M - Table, upon which all the calculations are based, a result which must be
regarded as extremely favorable.


The table on page 31 exhibits the annual rate of mortality in this Society, compared
with that of a number of other standards. The table in this form will probably be more
intelligible to the ordinary reader than most of the preceding ones. The various Registrars
of Vital Statistics are in the habit of speaking of the deaths among a population as so many
per thousand, and the public has become familiar with this mode of expression. Care
must however be taken not to fall into error in comparing the rates in this table with those
usually given for a general population. For example, the last annual report of the
Registrar-General of New South Wales gives the mortality of the colony for the year 1880
as 14.96 per thousand. In this Society the rate has been 8.02 per thousand. It must be
borne in mind, however, that in a general population the deaths among young children
(which are always excessive) are included, while they are for all practical purposes excluded
from the experience of a life office. From the table on page 31 it will be seen that the
mortality experience of this Society has been in all cases more favorable, and in the
majority of cases very much more favorable, than that exhibited by any other table. For
example, while the annual rate of mortality in this Society has on the average been .802
per cent., the corresponding rates for other individual offices exhibit an increase, beginning
at .953 per cent, in the Mutual Life of New York, proceeding in the order of the Mutual
Benefit of New Jersey, the Economic, the Equitable, the Gotha, and the Law Life, and
concluding with the rate of 2.329 per cent, in the Eagle. It will be further observed that
the rate in this Society has been only about half tffi
about one-third that of the Northampton Table. Th
some care; the rate of mortality will necessarily be
under observation. The table in the margin gives

information was accessible, from which it will be seen
that the age of the members of this Society was less
than that of any other. There seems little reason to
doubt, however, that the mortality experienced by this
office has been much more favorable than that experi-
enced by any other standard in the table, except that of
the Mutual Life of New York, than which it has been
slightly better.

There will be observed a striking similarity between the experience of the Mutual Life
of New York and that of this Society all through these tables. The average ages at entry
were, for the Mutual of New York, 34.95 years, and for this Society, 34 60 years; the average
durations of the membership were 5.64 years and 5.04 years respectively, and the average
age at death 40.59 and 39.64, while the annual mortality per cent., as will be seen from
the table on page 31, has been .953 and .802 respectively. These figures point to the
conclusion that had the ages at entry and average duration of membership in both offices
been equal, the rate of mortality would also have been nearly equal. This agreement
between the experience of two offices operating among people somewhat similarly circum-
stanced, but living in opposite quarters of the globe, is not without interest.

On pages 33, 34 and 35 will be found Tables of the expectation of life, deduced from
the experience of this Society, compared with the expectation as shewn by the two tables
framed from the combined experience of assured lives, also by the English Life and Carlisle
Tables. The expectation of life deduced from the experience of various Offices is also
furnished and can be compared with that of this Society. Comparing the experience of
this Society with that shewn by the General Mortality Tables (H M -, 17 Offices, English
Life, and Carlisle) it will be seen that at all the usual assuring ages, that is below the age
of 60, the former is very much more favorable than either of the latter. Above the age
of 60 the Carlisle Table exhibits a slight advantage up to the end of the Table.
Comparing the expectation with those of the individual offices, it will be observed that
the experience of this Society has been much more favorable than those of the Equitable,
Gotha, Economic, and Eagle, almost throughout the Table; it is also more favorable than
that of the Law Life up to the age of 60, and about equal throughout with those of the
two American Offices included in the comparison. As a general statement, therefore, it
may be safely affirmed that there is no existing published table of any office, or body
of offices, which exhibits a more favorable view of the Expectation of Life than that shewn
by the experience of this Society.
I have used the phrase “expectation of life ” because it is a well understood technical
term among actuaries, but some writers have taken exception to it on the ground that it is
misleading to the uninitiated. The idea intended to be expressed by “ expectation of life ”
is the mean time which a number of persons at any instant of age will live after that
instant.* Ihe phrase “expectation of life ' practically expresses the average number
of premiums that a life office expects to receive from persons assuring at any given age.
The expectation of life at ages 30, 40, and 50, by the H M - Table is 34.681, 27.399, and
20.306, and therefore we expect to receive that number of premiums from men of those
ages respectively. If the experience of the A. M. P. Society in the future were to corres-
pond with what it has been, then according to its Table, we should expect to receive
37.724 premiums from men of 30, 29.552 from men of 40, and 21.702 from men of 50.
I must, however* repeat that it should be carefully borne in mind that this is on the
assumption that the experience of the future will coincide with that of the past, but I have
already shewn that we are not yet warranted in taking this for granted.
It may be added the “ expectation of life ” does not, as seems to be popularly supposed,
enter directly into any of the ordinary calculations of a Life Assurance Society, and is
chiefly valuable only as a convenient means of comparison between different Tables of
Mortality formed from observations made upon various bodies of individuals.
* Dr. Farr contends that “afterlifetime” would be a more correct expression, and observes, “The
afterlifetime of men at the age of 30 is 33 years by the English Life Table: 33 years is not the precise
time probably that any one of that age will live, but the average time that a number of men of that age will
live taken one with another. Age + afterlifetime=lifetime. At age 30 this is 30 + 33=63, the average age
which men now aged 30 will attain. At birth this is 0 + 40=40; when lifetime and afterlifetime are the
same thing. The lifetime simply, without the addition at a given age, will serve to express in one word
what is often improperly called the ‘expectation of life at birth.’” —Eighth Annual Report , p. 280.

The Table on pages 37, 38, and 39, shews in respect of all the mortality tables therein
enumerated the number at each age out of which one death will occur in the year. The
figures in this Table are obtained by dividing unity by the probability of dying in a year
at each age. Thus at age 30 we have .00 A 7 8= 2 39- The same result may be otherwise
arrived at by dividing the number living at each age by the number of deaths set opposite
that age. Thus taking the A. M. P. Society’s experience, it will be seen on reference to
Schedule F, page 22, that of 80,903 persons living at that age 338 die during the year.
The number therefore out of which one will die is B iHHP=239, which is the number
opposite A. M. P. Society column in the Table.
Contrasting this Society’s experience with that of individual offices also at age 30, it
will be seen that in the Equitable, Law Life, Gotha, Eagle, Mutual Benefit, and Mutual
Life (N.Y.), the corresponding numbers out of which one will die are 122, 138, 156, 84,
151, and 154. If the same comparison be instituted with the two Tables based upon the
experience of assured lives, namely the Institute of Actuaries’ H M> Table and the Seven-
teen Offices, the numbers will be respectively 129 and xi9;or taking the Tables framed
from the rates of mortality prevailing among the general population we find that by the
Carlisle and the English Life Table one death would occur out of every 99 persons living,
and by the Northampton one out of every 58.
Up to age 51 the A. M. P. Society’s experience is markedly more favorable than that
of any other office with which it is compared. From age 51 to the end of the table, with
the exception of a few ages, the experience of the Mutual Life (N.Y.) is slightly more
favorable. It is worthy of note that from age 69 to the end of the Table the experience of
the two American Offices is nearly identical. From age 64 there is a close agreement ■with
the experience of the Law Life, as well as with that of the Equitable. From age 67
onwards it will be noticed that the number out of which one will die is identical with that
derived from the Institute of Actuaries’ H M Table. This arises from the fact that, owing
to the want of sufficient data at the older ages, the H M - probabilities of death were used to
complete the Table derived from the experience of this Society.
The larger the number out of which one will die the more favorable of course is the
mortality experience. The Table affords a popular means of comparison and the most
cursory glance at it will shew the remarkably favorable mortality which has been experi-
enced by this Society.
On looking more closely at the column which represents the experience of this Society
some remarkable anomalies are apparent about the period of early manhood; for instance
it will be observed that the prospect of longevity at each age steadily improves from age
20 up to age 26, and that even at age 33 it is'greater than at age 20. It can hardly be
possible that this somewhat curious result is entirely due to paucity of data at these ages
or to accidental circumstances, for exactly similar anomalies have been observed at nearly
the same ages in various other sets of observations, and it has in fact been questioned
whether the rate of mortality during the period from 20 to 24 years of age is not greater

than in that from 25 to 29. It is therefore highly probable that whatever may be the true
explanation of the fact, the law of mortality among assured lives really does follow a course
somewhat analogous to that here brought out.
It has been clearly demonstrated by the experience of life assurance offices that the
rate of mortality among assured lives is largely influenced by the duration of the assurances.
All other things being equal, the death rate among a number of lives which have been
insured for five years and upwards is largely in excess of that among lives which have
been insured for less than five years. This excess is due to the fact that the special pro-
tection afforded to the office by the medical examination at the commencement of the
assurance gradually diminishes and after the lapse of five or six years practically disappears
entirely. The Table on page 41 exhibits for all ages combined the numbers exposed to risk
and the numbers who died arranged according to the years of assurance. For the purpose of
comparison, the number of expected deaths according to the H M - Table and the experience
of the New York Mutual have been added. The year of assurance o means the balance of
the year during which the lives enter and embraces a period of about six months only.
In comparing the figures for the A. M. P. Society and the New York Mutual with
those for the H M - Table, it must be remembered that in the 20 British Offices, from the
experience of which the H M - Table was constructed, the lives which had been assured for
long periods were a much larger proportion of the whole than they were either in this
Society or in the New York Mutual, and consequently, over the whole experience, the
mortality according to the H M - Table would be expected to be appreciably larger than by
either of the others. If the comparison be confined to the years of assurance o to 4
inclusive—where a perfect analogy exists—it will be observed that while the deaths in this
Society were 749, the numbers expected by the H M - and New York Mutual Tables were
respectively 1,122 and 890. It follows that the actual deaths according to the A. M. P.
Society’s experience among policies in their first five years of assurance were only 66 7 per
cent, of the number which might have been expected according to the H M - Table. This
result is equally favorable with that formerly obtained for policies of all durations. It is
also remarkable that the deaths in this Society have been only 84 per cent, of the expected
number according to the table formed from the experience of the New York Mutual for
policies of similar durations.
The extent of the advantage gained by the medical selection of lives when they are
first assured is strikingly brought out in the last two lines of the Table, from which it appears
that according to the experience of this Society the rate of mortality among lives assured
for less than five years is only .616 per cent, per annum against 1 057 per cent, among
those who have been assured for a longer period, the former rate being only 58 per cent,
of the latter. This fact leads to the conclusion that in this office the medical examinations
have, as a rule, been conducted with a high degree of care and attention, and have been
remarkably successful in eliminating as far as possible all bad lives from the category of
our members.

Considerable interest attaches to the subject of the assessment of the lives of proposers
whose prospects of longevity are somewhat less than the average. Complaints have
frequently reached the Society about the severity of its practice in this matter of “ loading
lives ”; it was therefore determined to separate the assurances into the two classes of
select and diseased or doubtful lives and to deduce the experience of each. The Table
below exhibits the numbers exposed to risk in each class, the actual deaths which have
occurred, and the expected number by the H M - Table. In the case of the lives accepted
at an advance the number of expected deaths is given on the assumption that all the lives
were accepted select as well as on the basis of their assumed ages.

From this table it will be seen that among select lives the actual mortality has been
66.6 per cent., or exactly two-thirds of what might have been expected according to the
H M * Table, while among the advanced lives, taking the assumed ages as the basis, the
actual deaths have been 68.7 per cent, of the expectation. Seeing that the object intended
to be attained by the rating-up of under-average lives, is, if possible, to put the Society, in
respect of them, on the same footing as if they had all been select, it follows that the
practical outcome of this Table is that in assessing lives the Society has scarcely added a
sufficient number of years to the ages of depreciated lives. The difference is so small,
however, that it may be fairly claimed that the delicate task of assessment has been
discharged with substantial justice to both classes of members. It is worthy of remark
that had the lives accepted at an advance been all taken at their true ages, the mortality
among them would have been only 79.8 per cent, of the expectation by the H M - Table.
In other words, the diseased lives of this Society have exhibited 20 per cent, more vitality
than the healthy lives in the Twenty English and Scotch Offices on whose experience the
H M - Tables are based. It may be of interest to know that the average true age of all
lives included in the above Table is 33.0 years and the average assumed age 34.6 years,
so that the average advance spread over all the assured lives has been 1.6 years. Dealing
only with the lives accepted at an advance, the average true age is 33.2 years and the

For the purpose of a
further comparison, the expected deaths according to the experience
among diseased lives in Twenty British Offices (D MF ) have been added.
It will be seen on examining the Table that not only have the total deaths at all ages
fallen considerably short of those expected according to the Institute Tables, but that this
is also the case for each quinquennial group of ages between 20 and 60. Above the latter
age, however, the actual deaths, in one or two instances
rise slightly above the expected
numbers.
The group of ages at which the A. M. P. Society’s experience shews to greatest
advantage
is that from 25 to 29, where it will be seen the rate of mortality experienced is
average assumed age 36.7 years, so that the number of years added to depreciated lives has
averaged 3| throughout.
The following Table exhibits the particulars referring to the actual and expected
deaths among these two classes of assurances arranged in quinquennial groups of ages.
only about half of that shewn by the Institute Tables.
The A. M. P. Society is unquestionably developing an experience peculiarly its own;
and a brief reference to some of the points of dissimilarity that distinguish it from other
offices will make this apparent.


To begin with the nationality of the members, the following Table shews the
nationality of the various members who have been admitted into the Society from its
inception up to 31st December, 1878. The 41,710 lives that the Society has assured have
been gathered from almost every quarter of the globe, for although all the members were
residing in Australia when their policies were taken out, only 3 x per cent, of the lives who
entered the Society were born in the Australasian colonies; while 66 per cent, were European
born, and 3 per cent, were natives of Asia, Africa, America, and the Islands. It further
appears from the table that 40 per cent, of the lives assured were natives of England and
Wales, 12.5 per cent. Scotchmen, and 9 per cent, of Irish origin. It is not surprising that
out of the Australian membership one-half should claim New South Wales as their birth-
place, the colony in which the Society was founded, and outside of which but little business
was transacted for fifteen years after its establishment.

From this Table we deduce the fact that among European lives the actual deaths
have been 67.8 per cent, of the expected number, while the corresponding percentage
among the Colonial lives has been 63.2. It does not necessarily follow from this that the
latter have exhibited greater vitality than the former, for it will be observed that while
among the European lives the number exposed to risk below the age of 45 is 64.3 per
cent, of the total, the corresponding exposures among the Colonial lives are 90.4 per cent.
of the total. The European lives have therefore been under observation at older ages
than the Colonial ones and hence care must be observed in drawing conclusions from the
figures in the Table.
Another reason why the mortality among European-born lives assured in the Society
might naturally be expected to be somewhat higher than among the Colonial-born lies in the
fact that the policies held by the former class have on an average been considerably longer
on the books. Thus it is found that, whereas the average duration of the policies on
European lives is 5.4 years, that of the Colonial-born is only 3.7 years; and, therefore,
other things being equal, we should expect to find a somewhat lower rate of mortality
among the latter class. The general result would appear to be that, so far as the experience
45


of this Society has hitherto shewn, there is very little indeed to choose between the two
classes of lives, in regard to their prospects of longevity.
It would have been interesting to have compared the numbers of the various national-
ities among the assured lives with the corresponding numbers in the general population,
but I have not been able to obtain the information necessary to permit of such a compari-
son being fairly made. The Census returns of the various colonies do not supply the
numbers representing the various nationalities arranged according to the age, and as the
number of young children (who are not assurable lives) would be a very much larger pro-
portion of the whole among the Colonial than among the Foreign born, any comparison
which omitted the element of age would necessarily be most misleading.
The Table on page 47 shews the occupations of all the members who have joined
the Society as at the date of assurance. The Table may be summarised as follows:—Out
of 41,710 entrants, 15,170, or 36.37 per cent., were storekeepers, mechanics, butchers,
and bakers; clerks, merchants, teachers, architects, and surveyors, numbered 9,254, or 22.18
per cent.; farmers and graziers, 4,990, or 12 per cent.; minors under 20, being chiefly for
endowments to children, represented 2,941, or 7.05 per cent, of the entrants; labourers,
miners, policemen, and railway employes, to the number of 2,860, or 6.86 per cent, took
out policies; while the clerical, medical, and legal professions numbered only 2,183, or
5.23 per cent.; domestic and miscellaneous occupations were in the ratio respectively of
2.30 and 3.99 per cent, of the total entrants; mariners and publicans were i| per cent,
each. Those who come under the designation of having no occupation —the leisured class
•—were under 1 per cent, of the total entrants. The above classification of the occupa-
tions is thoroughly characteristic of colonial life and in striking contrast with what I
believe would be exhibited by the combined experience of life assurance offices in England.
The condition of life of the persons whose lives have been assured will I think be
found to differ materially from that existing in almost any other Life Assurance Society.
In this connection it is to be regretted that assurance offices have not, with the exception
of the Gotha Life Assurance Bank, published any statistics bearing on the social con-
dition of their policy-holders, and that therefore no comparison can be instituted between
the experience of this Society and that of English and American offices. But I have
reason to believe that the proportions of persons following the various occupations
described in the following Table will be found to differ materially from those of any
English Assurance Society. It is my impression that the proportion of the professional,
mercantile, and educated classes assured with this Society is much smaller than it is in any
English office, while the proportion of the trading, farming, and labouring classes is on the
contrary much larger than is to be found in kindred institutions in the old country. The
reason of this is obvious. These colonies have not yet attracted as permanent residents
the moneyed, leisured, and propertied classes, to any appreciable extent, and an Australian
aristocracy has yet to be founded.
Owing to the absence of these classes, there is no necessity for those assurances in


Great Britain.

In the foregoing Table the numbers in column 7, headed “ Percentage of deaths on
Entrants of each class” have been found by dividing the
number of deaths
in each class,
as shewn in column 4, by the Number of Entrants, as per column 2, and multiplying the
result by 100. For example, among tradesmen and mechanics, we have -g^f-

connection with properties which arc found in such large numbers in British offices. Thq
preponderance of the labouring and agricultural classes is on the other hand owing to
the fact that the condition of such classes in these colonies, where high wages and ample
employment are always to be found, is very much better than that of similar classes in
Great Britain.

The following Statement, shewing the occupations of the lives assured, arranged in
the order of the average duration of the Assurances is somewhat instructive; it shews that
in the earlier years of the Society its constituency consisted largely of educated and
professional men, who were naturally alive to the benefits of assurance, and whose
residence generally in centres of population rendered them easily accessible. As time
rendered them easily accessible. As time
passed, competition arose, and the canvassing system was introduced; the Society then
drew its membership from classes further afield, such as farmers and those lower in
the social scale, such as labourers. The progression from the educated and comparatively
wealthy classes in the centres of population to those in the humbler walks of life, and to
the residents in the scattered districts is very marked,

should be omitted from any deductions which appear to be warranted by the Table.
In fixing the various heads under which to arrange the occupations of the members, a
classification was adopted somewhat similar to that exhibited in the returns of the census
of New South Wales for 1871. In arranging the cards under these heads, the following
principles have been adhered to: —Under the head of “Merchants and Bankers” are
included accountants, auctioneers, brokers, and agents; “ storekeepers ” includes all retail
shopkeepers of every description, as well as their employe's; under the head of “ Trades-
men and Mechanics” are placed all who are engaged in the manufacture or production of
any kind of goods, as distinguished from those in the last-mentioned class, who are merely
engaged in selling the productions of others; under the same head as “Architects and
Surveyors ” are included artists, authors, editors, civil engineers, and all persons belonging
to what may be called the educated professions, other than the clerical, legal, and medical;
“ Labourers ” comprise all unskilled workmen, such as bushmen, fencers, quarrymen, well-
sinkers, wood-cutters, &c.; while the class headed “ Domestic Occupations ” consists
entirely of females engaged solely in domestic duties. The other headings do not seem to
require any particular explanation, as they speak for themselves.


A fair comparison of the relative vitality of various classes of members may be drawn
from the following arrangement of the figures :

In this table the occupations are arranged in the order of the mortality per cent, per
annum, commencing with the highest. This percentage has been arrived at by dividing the
members, and the average duration of the assurances in each class, vary considerably,
ranging from age 40.47 —that of publicans—down to age 30 —that of clerks —and from a
duration of 8.534 years in the case of clergymen, to 3.316 in the case of labourers. There-
fore, for the comparison of the relative mortality of the members following different
occupations to be perfect, the average age at entry and the average duration of the assu-
rances should be the same. This explanation will in some degree account for the apparent
anomalies which the table presents. Thus it will be seen that the annual rates of mortality
per cent, among medical men and publicans are nearly identical, but the former entered at
age 35.94, while the age of the latter was 40.47. It will be observed, further, that the
assurances had run for 6.063 years in the case of medical men, and for only 4.210 years in
that of publicans, so that the former died at the age of 42.00 years, and the latter at the
age of 44.68 years. These figures indicate that in the past experience of the Society the
49


lives of publicans have been better than those of medical men. This fact would point
to the conclusion that the exacting character of the medical profession—the broken rest,
long hours of labour, and exposure to all sorts of weather —which fall to the lot of medical
men in good practice in these colonies, have not been without effect in impairing their
vitality. It must not however be forgotten that it has been the practice of the Society to
make an addition to the age of all publicans to cover the risk of occupation; had they
been accepted select lives, or only with such casual additions as have been made to the
ages of medical men, the two classes would have been under observation at ages more
nearly approximating to each other, and the expected number of deaths among publicans’
lives would have been smaller than is shewn in the Table. The relative mortality of the
different professions deserves particular notice. I believe all the inquiries that have been
instituted respecting the longevity of the clerical, legal, and medical professions confirm
the fact that clergymen are the best lives, medical men the worst, while the lawyers occupy
an intermediate position. From data derived from the census of 1861 and the twenty-fifth
annual report of the Registrar-General of England, it was found that the mortality for the
40 years of life intervening between 25 and 65 years of age was in the clerical profession,
1.04; in the legal, 1.5 1 ; and in the medical, 177 per cent, per annum. The experience
of this Society is in striking contrast with these results. The mortality per cent, among
clergymen has been rather less than half that experienced among medical men, and slightly
under 55 per cent, of the corresponding rate among lawyers. Comparing teachers with
tradesmen it will be seen that both classes entered at about the same ages and that the rate
of mortality has been practically identical; as however the duration of the assurances in
the case of the former exceeds that of the latter by upwards of a year, it may be safely
affirmed that teachers have proved better lives than tradesmen. The most startling fact
indicated by the table is that the butchers have proved to be among the very best lives
on the Society’s books. This result is entirely opposed to all previous experience, whether
of a general population or of life offices. Among the general population of Great Britain
at the census of 1861, the annual rate of mortality among butchers was 17.4 per thousand;
among such as were members of the Friendly Societies of England the rate was 17.9 per
thousand, while among the whole adult population between the ages of 25 and 65 it was
15 per thousand; the late Professor Pell shewed, from an investigation into the experience
of New South Wales, for the period 1860-75, that the rate of mortality among adult males
between the ages 25 and 65 was about 17 per thousand; among the butchers in this
Society, however, it has been but 5.8 per thousand. It appears to me impossible that
these figures can fairly indicate the relative vitality of butchers’ lives, and this result is
probably due to some accidental circumstances, the existence of which is owing to
the paucity of numbers under observation. Reliable results can only be arrived at
after a more extended investigation, and upon such I hope to enter subsequently.
There seems little reason to doubt, however, that the heaviest mortality has been
among mariners; they entered at the age of 36, their assurances were under observation
for years, and the mortality was at the rate of 21 per thousand per annum. It should

It will be observed that in the British offices the ordinary whole life policies constitute
about 94 per cent, of the total, while in this Society they are only 61 per cent. As
opposed to this, the Endowment Assurance policies issued by the A. M. P. Society
rnmnnco about one-third of the whole, while similar policies are found in very limited
however be explained that in cases where an extra premium has been charged, it has been
imposed in the form of a certain percentage on the sum assured (which is more convenient
in practice), instead of as an addition to the age at entry. Had the latter plan been
adopted, the age at entry would have been somewhat higher, and consequently the rate
of mortality less disproportionate. lam of opinion, however, that this correction would
not relieve mariners of the charge of being the worst lives in the Society.
Another point of dissimilarity which will be found to hold between this Society and
kindred institutions in Great Britain is the description of the assurances taken out by the
members. In its purest and most simple form a life assurance is understood to be a
contract by which a certain sum is secured at the death of a person, in consideration
for various payments during his life-time. This life policy, however, admits of many
modifications, and the nature and extent of these modifications indicate to a considerable
degree the character of the community among which an office transacts its business. The
following Table exhibits the weight of the various descriptions of assurances in this
Society, and in the Standard and Scotch Widows’ Fund —the largest British offices; —
It will be observed that in the British offices the ordinary whole life policies constitute
about 94 per cent, of the total, while in this Society they are only 61 per cent. As
opposed to this, the Endowment Assurance policies issued by the A. M. P. Society
comprise about one-third of the whole, while similar policies are found in very limited
numbers in the business of the Standard and Scottish Widows’ Funds. There are two
points in connection with an Endowment Assurance Policy worthy of notice; the
premium for the same amount of assurance is much higher than in the case of a whole life
policy, and the sum assured is payable at a specified age, or at death, should that occur
previously. The inference to be drawn, therefore, is that in these colonies the people
generally can afford to pay higher premiums and evince a greater desire to combine the
investment with the purely provident feature than do policy-holders in the old country.
The preponderance of single and limited premium policies in this Society is a further
proof of the easier circumstances of Australian policy-holders. Other descriptions of


assurances than those referred to, except non-participating policies, are not issued in any
considerable number by either of the offices. This office only commenced to grant
non-participating policies in 1874, and the comparison therefore has but little value.
One or two points of resemblance appear to me to be so remarkable that they are
worthy of mention. It has been already stated that the largest number of policy-holders
entered at age 30. I find that in the Law Life, Economic, Mutual of New York, and the
Twenty Offices from whose experience the H M - Table was constructed the same condition
holds. Again, the average age at entry in this Society has been 34.60; in the Mutual
Life of New York, 34.95 ; and in the Twenty Offices, 34.96.
In order to enable the reader to take in at a glance the general bearing of the com-
parisons which have been instituted in the preceding tables between the mortality experience
of this Society and those of the Mutual Life of New York and the H M- Tables, I have
inserted five diagrams. No. I exhibits the actual number of deaths which have occurred in the
Society in comparison with the number which would have been expected according to the
tables of the Mutual Life of New York. The continuous black line represents the former
and the dotted line the latter. The black line runs irregularly because the figures have not
been graduated, whereas the comparatively regular course of the dotted line is owing to the
fact that the expected number of deaths has been obtained by the use of the graduated
q x of the Mutual Life Tables. Roughly speaking, we may say that the excess of the portion
of surface coloured blue over that coloured red shews the advantage which this office has
enjoyed in its death record over the Mutual Life of New York. Diagram II exhibits the
result of a similar comparison instituted with the H M< Table, and shews the advantage on
the part of this Society in a very marked manner. Diagrams IV and V exhibit similar
comparisons when the rate of mortality is viewed as affected by the years of assurance
instead of by the ages of the persons assured. Diagram 111 gives the curves repre-
senting the expectation of life by the three standards. It may be read to mean that the
space between the red and black lines exhibits the advantage gained by this Society over
the H M - Table; the space between the dotted and black lines shews the advantage gained
by the Mutual Life of New York over the H M - Table. Comparing this Society and the
New York Mutual it may be said that where the red line is above the dotted line the
intervening space is in favor of this Society, while the contrary is the case where the red
line is below the dotted line. Beyond the age of 67 it will be observed the black and red
lines are merged into one. This is due to the fact that owing to the paucity of data at the
higher ages, the experience of this Society was assumed to coincide with the H M Table
at ages above 67.
It is not the intention to enter, in this treatise, into any discussion of the relative
intensity of the various diseases, as the whole question of the causes of death will be subse-
quently dealt with by the Society’s Chief Medical Officer, Dr. W, F. Mackenzie. Meanwhile,
however, several tables are inserted here containing the information relating to the causes of
death of the 1551 assured lives who have become claims during the 30 years of which this
investigation treats. The table on pages 55 to 58 shews the number dying from each cause,

deaths from violence in this Society, compared

the population of New South Wales the deaths

exactly with that adopted by the Mutual Life Ins. Coy. (N.Y.), and follows very closely
that of the Registrar-General of New South Wales. The most salient point in the table,
and that which will at once arrest the attention of the reader, is the extraordinary number
of violent deaths—accidents and suicides. The deaths from accidents alone number 198,
and are even in excess of the number from consumption, that most fatal of all diseases
among assured lives. A synopsis of this table, which will be found on page 59, will repay
occur chiefly among the young lives, fall also in the earlier years of assurance. Zymotic
diseases, as might have been expected, have >also committed their deadliest ravages
during the same period; no medical examination, however skilfully and conscientiously
conducted, can provide against the risk of early death from accident or typhoid fever.
As in the case of previous tables I have thought it advisable to illustrate those last
given by diagrams, two of which will be found inserted after page 64. For the design of
these diagrams I am indebted to the excellent Mortuary Report of the Mutual Life In-
surance Company of New York. The first exhibits the figures given in the table on pages
55 to 58, and shews in a graphic manner the gradual diminution in intensity, as the age
increases, of deaths from zymotic diseases, consumption and accidents, and a corresponding
increase in other constitutional diseases, in diseases of the heart, and diseases of the urinary
system. The points of reference (* alcoholism and ® other diseases of circulatory
system) in the line 19 to 29, indicate that there have been no deaths from the diseases to
which they are attached at these ages, and the position of the points in the second line—
-30 to 39 —indicates where the deaths from these diseases are introduced. The figures on the
diagram shew the percentage of the deaths from each cause on the total deaths at each group
of ages, thus:—of the deaths between the ages 19 and 29, typhoid fever contributed 14.58
per cent.; of those between 40 and 49, accidents were responsible for 15.32 per cent.
Diagram 11. exhibits in a condensed form the information given in the table on pages 61 to
64. It expresses in a most striking manner the effect which the duration of the assurance
exercises on the cause of death. The explanation concerning the points of reference—
* and ®—given in connection with the previous diagram, is also applicable to this one.

The one broad fact which will be found to stand out boldly throughout the whole of
these pages is that the mortality experience of this Society has been more favorable than
that of any other Life Assurance Office in any part of the world. This is a pleasing reflec-
tion for those colonists who have left, and an encouraging one to others about to leave, the
old country, presumably only to better their circumstances, to find that in their new home
their lease of life will be prolonged—that the average number of years which persons of a
specified age taken one with another enjoy is greater in sunny Australia than in the cold
and rainy climate of Great Britain. I think, however, it would be a mistake to attribute the
prolonged expectation of life in these colonies exclusively to climatic influences. Ad-
mitting that the fine climate is an important factor in the higher expectation of life, we have
had this further advantage, that the lives have been selected from a population earning good
wages, in easy circumstances, and with abundance of good nutritious food, and these, we
know, are conditions that greatly conduce to the health of a community. There is much
to be said both for and against the climate of Australia from a life assurance standpoint; to
persons in robust health there is no doubt the climate, taken as a whole, is conducive to
longevity, for those in that condition can bear the excessive heat of summer and the sudden
changes in the temperature without much inconvenience or injury to their health. It is,
however, very different with those whose health has become impaired, and who have con-
tracted some functional or organic disease. To a considerable number in that condition
the climate is anything but salubrious; it is, on the contrary, most depressing and ener-
vating The fact is we are not as yet in a position to speak authoritatively as to what effect
the climate, taken by itself, has on the prolongation of life ; but that there is a combination
of circumstances that conduces to the higher expectation has, I think, been proved. I
do not, however, see my way to draw conclusive inferences from the data to establish the
fact that the expectation of life will be permanently greater in Australia than in Great
Britain or America, solely on the ground of superiority of climate. I have therefore reluc-
tantly arrived at the conclusion that this experience must not be taken to “correctly express
the rate of mortality among assured lives in Australia/’ in the future; and although its
favorable character during the past has conferred upon the office an advantage which has
given impetus to its prosperity, I do not think it should, without confirmation, be employed
as the basis of the Society’s business transactions. Under imprudent management this
favorable mortality experience might have been productive of grave danger to the stability
of the institution. Had it been assumed that the rate of mortality experienced during the
past was to be relied on in the future; had the large sums saved by reason of the very small
death-rate which has been found to prevail been considered profit, and divided as such,
the position of this office would have been materially weakened. By adopting a contrary
course, however, and by valuing the liabilities on the most stringent principles known to
actuarial science, the Society has been placed in a position, the stability of which is, I am
confident, unsurpassed by that of any other Life Office in any country.
