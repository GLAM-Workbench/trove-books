To my Readers.
Like some poor mariner, that winds have tossed
Away from friends and home across the sea,
Who at the last, when almost hopeless lost,
Spies some lone island, far upon the lea.
Thoughtless of breakers that must still be crossed,
Fresh hopes arise and dark despair will flee.
Once more he trims his sail with feeble hand,
And shapes his course to reach the welcome land.
And when, at last, upon the rook-bound shore
By some huge wave his boat lies shattered there,
ilmost bereft of life, he still will pour
His grateful thanks to Heaven in silent prayer;
And as he prays he thinks of home once more,
And all the loving friends that still are there?
For thoughts of home, and friends that?s far away,
Will cheer our hearts, no matter where we stray.
Like that poor mariner, too, my fate hath oast
Me far away from loving friends at home,
And now I fear not fortune?s cruellest blast,
Since I have battled through misfortune?s foam,
But fond remembrance still of happy days that?s past
Steals o?er my soul, and cheers me as I roam.
So the poor wanderer trusts in Heaven above,
And sings for you at home these songs of love.
Newington Park Station.
A Song of Sadness.
Fain I?d sing to you of gladness,
But the words will die away,
And a mystic, gentle sadness
Falls upon my soul to-day.
From the mountains that surround me,
From the brook that murmurs near,
And e?en the world, and all around me,
Whispers sorrow in mine ear.
Telling of the sad and lonely,
Not of deeds of daring done;
Of the weak and fallen only,
Not of those who laurels won;
And my heart weighs down with sorrow,
__ As my song goes floating by,
For the many that to-morrow
Wake to weep, to watch and die.


In the city?s crowded highway,
In the busy throng of life,
Trampled down in every by-way,
Bruised and wounded in the strife.
I can hear sad voices crying
?Gainst the mighty and the strong;
And the wail of sick and dying
Drowns the blatant victor?s song.
Alas ! my song is not of gladness
When I think of those who fall,
And my heart swells, full of sadness,
?Sponsive to their gentle call.
Low yet, as from countless numbers,
Comes that cry of bitter wrong,
And the voice of gladness slumbers?
Gentle sorrow fills my song.
Si, Kilda.
The Land of Dreams.
A pleasant land is the land of dreams,
That lieth over there ?
It hath sunny skies and silver streams
And gardens that bloometh fair;
And oft when my heart feels weary and sad,
For awhile, I wander away
To a realm where all seem happy and glad,
?Neath the light of an endless day.
And I see the faces I knew of old,
The friends that were true and kind,
And we meet as we met, ere our hearts grew cold,
With the care that is left behind.
For there?s nothing of sorrow, or doubt or care
Where Hope?s star brightly beams,
And the shadows came not between us there,
When we meet in the land of dreams.
You may ask the road, but I cannot tell
Tho? oftentimes I stray,
And my spirit knoweth the way right well,
And fain, it longeth to stay;
But it lies away in the clouds somewhere,
And always nearer seems
When my soul would rest from trouble and care,
It flies to the land of dreams.


The Wattle Blossom.
There?s a sprig of wattle-blossom lying here before me now,
That I plucked ?twas but this morning, and I?m going to tell you how;
And though it looks so simple, yet a lesson it will be;
Then listen to my story?it may teach both you and me.
I had wandered forth downhearted?l was feeling low and sad,
For gold was very scarce to get, and times were very bad;
Another week was coming, many bad ones had gone past,
And yet this one was looking just as gloomy as the last.
So thus 1 wandered forward, just thinking to myself
How hard I had to struggle to get a little wealth?�
How bad the times had been, would they brighten any more 1
Whan I saw this blossom growing on the hill-side just before.
Though my heart was sad and weary, and the day was dark and drear,
Not a single ray of sunshine around me far or near;
Yet though it looked so darksome, the blossom told me plain
Of the happy spring-time coming, when the sun would shine again.
Ho thus I learnt the lesson, that however dark the day,
The merry, happy spring-time may not be far away?
Though the winter of adversity may keep away the sun,
It will only seem the brighter when these darksome days are done.
Maryborough.
Alone, yet Not Alone.
I love to be alone when the sun hath sunk to rest,
When the clouds of gold and crimson are lighting up the west;
I love to be alone, when the songsters on each tree
Are humming forth their evening song, so full of melody?
For then sweet thoughts of other days within my breast will spring,
And fancy bids me roam away upon her fairy wing;
Yet often as I?m seated upon some mossy stone,
There?s something seems to whisper ? 1 never am alone.?
I never am alone?the greenwood rings with glee,
For merry little songsters are singing on each tree;
I never am alone, whilst I roam beneath the sky,
Tho? perchance should others meet me, they?ll deem there?s no one
nigh,
Yet there?s many that I love, tho? perchance they?re far away,
Yet in my fairy vision to them I seem to stray,
And often as I view the moon in her star-bespangled throne,
Their voices Odme and whisper ? I never am alone.?


I can never be alone, whilst the merry birds are near,
Or whilst their merry songs are ringing in my ear;
I never am alone, there is One that?s always near,'
Though some may deem that solitude alone Is reigning here.
Yet wherever I may wander, through the town or greenwood free
Or through the dreary desert land, what matters it to me 1
Yet still whilst God is near me, Low could I ever own,
Though silence reigns around me, that I can be alone.
Ginchm Bay, Smith Australia.
The Storm.
Bdt a moment ago, and the Storm King had spread
His mantle of darkness high over my head;
But a moment ago, since yonder dark cloud
Had wrapt all the heavens, as if in a shroud.
And save for the lightning, that went flashing by,
All around me was darkness?no star in the sky,
The thunder roared round me, that came with the blast
But a moment ago?yet how soon has it past.
And away like a whirlwind the Storm King has fled,
.And the calm moon looks down from her throne overhead;
The stars that were hidden have come one by one,
And the night looks the brighter for the storm that is gone.
Just so, in this life, when the storm of despair
Hath hidden Hope?s star, that was beaming so fair,
Like yonder fierce whirlwind?but a moment ?twill last,
And all will seem brighter when the storm has gone past.
Sandhurst.
Welcome Spring.
Spring is come?a thousand bright flowers,
The gems of the forest, will soon be ours;
They bloom in the valley, they deck the hill
By the banks of the lake, by the side of the rill.
In the greenwood wild wherever I stray
Bach mountain side is a garden gay;
It hath given new life to everything,
And the earth looks gay to welcome Spring.


Spring is come?there?s a merry shout,
?Tis the forest birds, as they roam about;
They are glad the winter has passed away?
They are glad the sun shines bright to-day.
The parrot so green, with the golden breast,
The robin and swallow are gay as the rest,
And hark how gaily the magpies sing,
And the wattle-bird joins to welcome Spring.
Spring is come?then why am I sad,
When all around me the earth is glad;
What though it is winter now with me,
Though parted from all that is dear to me;
Yet He, who hath decked the earth so gay
With blossoms and flowers wherever I stray,
Who hath given new life to everything,
Bids me be glad and welcome Spring.

My Own Bosom Friend.
Oh 1 what shall I sing in this wide world of sadness,
Where trouble and sorrow seem reigning around;
Oh 1 how can I sing when my heart has no gladness?
I have struck on my harp, but it will not resound;
And yet there?s one string the world?s left unbroken,
One song that shall cheer me along to the end ?
A strain that is dearer than all I have spoken,
The words that shall tell of one true bosom friend.
Then strike up my harp, be silent no longer,
Though fame may have tried to arouse thee in vain;
Awake from thy sleep, for a voice that is stronger-?-
The friend of my childhood ?now calls for a strain.
Ah 1 well I remember how bright was the dawning
That looked on my youth in those fond days of yore
What heart dreads the storm on a clear summer morning,
Or thinks of the darkness, with sunshine before ?
Yet when all is brightness the storm may be nearer,
And summer and sunshine may soon have an end;
Ah 1 then is the time that our heart holds the dearer,
And clings for support to the one bosom friend.
How little we know, when prosperity smiling,
Of the butterfly friends that will hover around;
How fond seems their hearts, and their tongues how beguiling.
Till adversity comes, and then where are they found 1


We may search all in vain for the love we would cherish,
It came with the summer, and died with its end?
For the one heart alone, that will cling till we perish,
Is found in the breast of a true bosom friend.
Ho-v short seems the time since my fond heart delighted
To join with the throng, and to mix in their strife;
How bright were my hopes, yet how soon were they blighted,
Until I grew weary and sick of my life
When I thought on the years that had passed since my childhood,
The trouble and sorrow that seemed without end;
But I knew not the peace that still dwelt in the wild wood,
Or the love in the breast of one true bosom friend.
*
I
The soldier may boast of his honour and glory,
The wealthy take pride in their mansions so grand;
Let others delight to tell o?er the story
Of the mighty and great that have dwelt in the land;
For me far more humble the wild birds around me
Shall list to my lay wherever I may wend;
Though fame, wealth, or glory, may never surround me,
I have more than all these in one true bosom friend.
Then strike up my harp, be silent no longer,
Though fame may have tried to rouse thee in vain,
Awake from thy sleep, for a voice that is stronger,
The friend of my childhood, now calls for a strain.
Newington Park Station.
At Rest at Last.
The silver moon, the queen of night.
Is shining in the western sky,
Whilst in the east, the dawning light
Proclaims another day is nigh,
And I, whilst all around is still
In silent thought, alone will tread
Down at the foot of yonder hill
To contemplate among the dead.
Here all alike, the rich and poor,
The proud, the humble, slumber near,
The ones that wept shall weep no more,
The thoughtless ones, are silent here,
The haughty rioh, the high and proud
That turn?d from misery?s tear away,
Are slumbering here amidst the crowd
Where all alike, at last, must lay.


But set for these I?ll tune my lay,
Their kindred spirits haply mourn,
No ; rather let me turn and say
Where lies in peaoe the child of scorn,
Boor child ; no stone points out the spot
On earth thy last sad narrow bed,
In life betrayed, in death forgot,
Save for that green turf o?er thy head.
*
I
How oft, in childhood?s happy day,
Beside thy tender parent?s knee
Thou knelt, thy little prayer to say,
That God would shelter such as thee.
Poor child, they died, and thou wert left
A helpless orphan, here below ;
Of friends and kindred, all bereft,
Alone, to struggle 'with thy woe.
Without a guide to point the way,
There?s many a one, self fancied strong,
Would fall, like thee, who went astray,
Not deeming thou wert going wrong.
And at thy fall no helping hand
Was stretched to save thee from despair.
And oh ! amidst a Christian land,
Not one, could breathe for thee a prayer.
But thou, poor child, art now at rest,
?Tis vain to mark where thou doth lie.
For, in the mansions of the west,
Thy soul hath fled beyond the sky,
And thou shalt rise to weep no more,
Or turn with shame thy cheek away.
They who thy grief despised are poor,
For thou art richer now than they.
The Song of Spring.
I COME, I come, with a chosen band,
To reign once more in your sunny land.
The winter King, with his stormy blast,
I have driven away to his home at last.
My mantle of blue, I have spread above,
And decked the earth with the flowers you love,
See how gladly the children sport o?er the plain,
And shout as they welcome me back again.
I come, I come, the clouds from the sky
I have rolled away, as I floated by
And fanned with my wings the sunny breeze
That is dancing there, through the greenwood trees.


Away in the wilds, I have built my bowers,
And decked them out with blossoms and flowers,
Where the merry birds, with a joyous strain,
Welcome me back to their homes again.
I come, I come, not bought with gold
Are the gems I bring for the young and old,
For the cottage small, or the mansion grand,
Spreading them out with a lavish hand.
Not alone for the rich and gay,
Have I folded the clouds of winter away ;
But the heart that was weary with care and pain,
Shall gladly welcome me back again.

When I am Dead.
When I am dead lay me down to rest
In some shady dell where the wild flowers spring ;
Where the golden beams shall come from the west,
And smile through the trees where the wild birds sing.
And leave me there in my lonely grave
With nought but the green turf o?er my head,
For the flowers shall bloom and the blossoms wave
To show the place where I sleep when 1 am dead.
For these are the scenes I have loved in life,
And when death comes I would lay me here,
The busy town with its noise and strife
Would break my rest if you laid mo near,
And the want and woe would make me sad;
But away in the woods I have no dread ?
For there in my heart I was ever glad,
And shall sleep in peace when I am dead.
*
'I
And shed no tears when you lay me there,
But weep for those who are left behind,
For they shall wake to trouble and care
Whilst I shall sleep with a tranquil mind.
For who will speak of the evil I?ve done
When you lay me down in my narrow bed.
May the friends who have loved me, many a one,
Think of me kindly when I am dead.
Then let me rest, I have wandered long,
And striven in the world?s unequal fight.
Where the weak must ever give way to the strong,
And he who has wealth is always right.
Where the poor must stand up in the house of God,
Where the rich can sit without fear or dread.
Then lay me not ?neath the churchyard soil,
But away in the woods, when I am dead.


For why should I sleep in a pauper?s grave,'
When here is a tomb that is fit for a King.
Then lay me down where the blossoms wave,
?Neath the shady trees where the wilds birds sing.
For it seems to me as if God were near,
Nearer, here, where the wild woods spread.
In life I have felt His presence here,
And He will guard me when I am dead.
We have Help ever Near.
This life is an ocean
On which we all sail,
Each vessel in motion
Borne on by life?s gale
Though tempests may toss us
Let?s be of good cheer,
Whate?er may cross us,
Yet help will be near.
Though sands are around ns.
Though wrecks are in sight,
Though darkness surrounds us,
Yet still we have light.
With religion to guide us,
Hope?s star will appear,
And whatever betide us,
Yet help will be near.
Though tempest arise
And may darken the sky,
Let us raise up our cries,
For God watcheth nigh.
Those words he doth say,
Still be of good cheer,
If to me ye but pray,
To help I am near.
In danger?s dark hour,
When temptation is nigh,
He still hath the power,
If to Him we but fly.
And with his own hand,
Tho? unseen shall he steer,
Let us not fear the strand,
For there?s help ever near.
Then set every sail,
For the pilot?s aboard,
And fair is the gale,
If we trust in our God
Let our hearts still be light,
Let us be of good cheer,
For the darker the night,
The help is more near.
Long Desert, South Australia.


In Memoriam?John Thomas.
He is not dead, but gone before,
Standing now with the angel band,
Looking down from the golden shore,
Free from care in a better land.
Hour by hour, as the days go by,
We shall weep for our dear ones loss,
But the crown he wears shall never die,
Here he was burdened down with a cross.
I
1
Who would bring him back again,
Back to a world of trouble and care,
Here lie suffered from grief and pain;
Free from all he is resting there.
We shall wake with to-morrow?s light,
Wake to weep, to watch, and pray,
We may rest through the silent night;
He shall rest through an endless day.
Many the friends that loved him here,
But God shall love him ever more,
He shall watch for our cominsr near,
He is not dead, but gone before.
St, Kilda .
Beautiful Flowers.
Tune ?? Beautiful Star.?
Beautiful flowers that bloom so gay,
Decking the earth wherever I stray.
Making your homes in these sunny bowers,
Flowers of the wild woods, beautiful flowers,
Flowers of the wild woods, beautiful flowers.
i
I
Down in the valley the buttercups grow,
And the daisies lie spread like a sheet of snow.
The bluebells look down from the rooky towers,
Flowers of the wild woods, beautiful flowers,
Flowers of the wild woods, beautiful flowers.
Away in the heath the wild blossoms spring,
The wattles bloom there where the wild birds sing.
Ye gladden each spot in sunshine or showers,
Flowers of the wild woods, beautiful flowers.
Flowers of the wild woods, beautiful flowers.
Beautiful flowers by God?s own hand,
Scattered away through our sunny land,
The city can boast of no garden like ours.
Flowers of the wild woods, beautiful flowers,
Flowers of the wild woods, beautiful flowers.


The Wreck.
?Twas night upon the sea,
The land was on the lea,
The good ship gallantly,
Went bounding on her way ;
The old, the young, the brave,
She bears across the wave,
So soon to be their grave,
Before the dawn of day.
4
'I
Old age with looks of grey,
Children the young and gay,
In peaceful slumber lay,
Cradled upon the deep.
Manhood, the strong in health,
The careless sons of wealth,
The poor that by himself
Watcheth whilst others sleep.
Of absent friends they dream,
Of homes where they have been,
Of many a happy scene,
Within Australia?s land.
They hear the merry song,
And in the joyous throng
Of loved ones, parted long,
Again they seem to stand.
The sick one in his bed,
Lies listening to the tread
Of the watch above his head
Or the water?s murmuring sound,
No beacon points the way,
No star lights up the day,
But all in darkness lay.
The waste of waters round.
No sound of danger near
Breaks on the seaman?s ear.
Without a thought of fear,
He treads the vessel?s deck,
But danger lies before
Australia?s rooky shore,
?Tis but a moment more,
And the good ship was a wreck.
Then rose on high the wail,
The stoutest heart might quail
Or rosy cheek turn pale
That listened to that cry.
The shriek of wild despair,
The yell of madpess there,
The lowly muttered prayer
Borne upwards to the sky.


But a moment and ?tis past,
The dawn has come at last,
But not a spar or mast
Is left above their tomb, ,
But the hardy bushman found
Where the rooky cliffs abound.
The wreckage strewn around,
That told him of their doom.
And throughout Australia?s land,
Where her pleasant homesteads stand,
Cottage small or mansion grand,
There are some that weep to day,
For they miss them from each fold,
The loved ones, young and old,
The brave hearts true and bold
That the sea hath torn away.
Si. Kilda,
A Wish.
Mine be a home, a little cot,
Where far from man, and far from woe,
Ambitious dreams might be forgot,
And true contentment I might know.
Give me a purse to help a friend,
A shady bower, beside a brook,
Where when I am weary, I may wend,
Let my companion be a book.
Let nature?s dwelling be around
Far from the City I would be,
Where nature?s sweetest scenes are found,
Where birds are singing on each tree
The wanderer shall be welcome there,
And to his wants I will attend,
My crust, the robin oft shall share,
And he will greet me as a friend.
There with my Mary, I would dwell,
Contented shall we pass away,
And when death comes, in some sweet dell,
Our bodies, side by side, shall lay.


Gather it Up.
Gather it up, silver and gold,
Lay it by in your stronghold there.
Others may starve in the wet and cold,.
You shall dine on the daintiest fare.
Others may sleep by the side of the way,
You shall lie on a silken bed.
Gather it up and let it lay,
Reap the harvest when you are dead.
Shut your ear to the toiler?s cry,
The scum of the earth that God placed here.
Trample them down and let them die,
Take no heed of the widow?s tear.
Seize on their birthright, take the land,
Enough for each is the one small bed.
Drive them off and let it stand,
Reap the harvest when you are dead.
Gather it up, no matter ho
Men shall worship the calf of gold.
God?s own image shall cringe and bow
Day by day in the market sold.
God?s own temple, the house of prayer,
You may enter and feel no dread.
Gold shall soften the hard words there;
Reap the harvest when you are dead.
Take no heed of the want and woe,
Why should it trouble the like of you.
Undismayed to destruction go,
Pleasant the path that takes you through;
But as sure as one of God?s children here
Has been robbed by you of his dally bread,
God shall count each falling tear,
Reap the harvest when you are dead.
Then gather it up and lay it by,
You shall go to your grave in state.
Mother shall show where the paupers lie,
Letters of gold shall tell where you wait?
Wait for the doom that is surely in store,
Pamphered and fattened, flattered and fed,
God shall judge between you and the poor,
Reap the harvest when you are dead.
Melbourne.


Written in answer to the Wallaby Track.
?Tis true your old boots are all tattered and worn,
Your trousers are ragged, your jumper is torn,
Your billycock hat is an object forlorn,
Your hair is unkempt, your beard is unshorn,
But still you have health, and the country is wide ;
When things look black here you can go to?ther side.
And still carry health whatever betide,
Then sit you down here, just awhile for a crack,
For like you, I was once on the Wallaby track.
There are some in this town that are worse off than you,
That will still hang about when there?s nothing to do,
No bread in the cupboard, things looking quite blue,
And perhaps with a sick wife and youngster or two,
Yet they still keep on loafing, around day byjday,
Though things look the blacker the longer they stay,
Till old age comes on, and all hope dies away,
Then they?re carried out there, where the paupers all lay.
Far better for them had they shouldered their pack,
And looked for new fields on the Wallaby track.
Just take a stroll down through each by-lane and street,
Just take a good look at each chap that you meet.
There are some that?s scarce got any boots to their feet,
And perhaps all the day have had nothing to eat.
And as for their clothes they look ragged and queer,
You will find it the best just to keep a bit clear,
And well you may ask, what it is keeps them here,
Let me tell you, my friend, it is nothing but beer,
For full well they know, should they go away back,
There?s none to be got on the Wallaby track.
I remember the time, though it?s long* years ago,
When the gold was first struck, how we tramp?d to and fro,
And many?s the wealthy man here I could show,
That carried his swag into old Bendigo.
No sundowner then, you were welcome to stay,
And sit down to rest, for a week or a day,
In each cottage, or homestead, that stood by the way ;
Just bring them the news, there was nothing to pay ;
But things have got altered, for now they look black,
When they see you go by on the Wallaby track
There are some, when they see a poor weary worn tramp
Go by with his swag, will say?there?s a scamp,
But to my mind, the rogues are a far different stamp,
And don?t lie about in the cold and the damp.
Then cheer up old boy, every dog has his day,
There are homesteads, and cities, to build far away,
And many?s the pile of bright gold that may lay
In the mountains, where none but the sundowners stray,
And perhaps you may yet, with your friends at your back,
Lend a band to some chap on the Wallaby track.
Melbourne.


The City of Gold.
The following lines were written on the occasion of
an old man being turned out of an hospital in one
of the goldfields, taken to the lock-up, and died
there the same night.
Turn him out in the City of Gold,
Let him starve or die in the street ;
He has no shelter from wet or cold,
Never a rest for his weary feet.
Never a rest save the grave where he lies,
Sheltered there from the wet and cold.
Perhaps he has found a home in the skies,
None for him here in the City of Gold.
Turn him out, why give him relief,
Perhaps he is honest, and therefore poor.
Take him away, lock him up as a thief,
Let him lie on the prison floor.
Homeless, friendless, turn him away,
God shall take him into His fold.
Angals shall find him a home to-day,
None for him here in the City of Gold,
Look at the mansions on every hand,
See the temples of God around ;
Boast of our wealth throughout the land,
Christian charity where art thou found.
Carry him out to his lonely bed,
Sheltered there from the wet and cold,
No room for him living, but now he is dead,
We can find him a grave in the City of Gold.
On the Death of a Child.
When winter?s stormy time has fled,
And spring time comes again.
When all the flowers that now seem dead
Heck every hill and plain.
Just as these earthly flowers do rise,
Your child shall rise again.
Her home is in the sunny skies
Away from grief and pain.
Thus think of me my mother dear,
And weep for me no more.
My winter?s past, my spring is here,
I am but gone before.


Weary.
Well I am tired and fain .would be at rest,
Am sick and weary with this toil and strife ;
I gaze with longing eyes upon the west,
And think that then, perchance, another life
May dawn, and all the evils that infest
This earth shall cease, and troubles no more rife
All that hath helped to make this earth so sad
Shall only seem to make the heavens more glad.
Care.
See how yon gloomy cloud steals up apace
And hides the stars that were wont to twinkle them,
Draping with sable shroud the moon?s calm face
And making all look dark that was so fair ;
So is it in this life, but now the race
Seemed almost won till some curs?d care
Steals o?er my soul like yon dark cloud,
And wraps me in despair, as in a shroud.
Death.
I look on death as on some faithful friend
That will befriend me when all hope is past ;
There is no trouble but must have an end,
There is no care that can forever last.
All ills that flesh is heir to He will mend,
And from all evils He will keep us fast
Then why should He afright me with His breath
The rich are poor, the poor are rich in death.
