A service is being arranged by the minister of
Thornleigh (Rev. Frank Hanlin) to the memory of
the late Miss Margaret E. Friend who was suddenly
called Home on Saturday, 6th inst.

enthusiastic supporter of our work, particularly
in connection with the development of the Confer-
ence Grounds, it is hoped that every Association
in the Metropolitan area will be represented at
the Service which will be held in the Neil
Livingston Hall, Thornleigh, on Sunday, 14th inst«,

If your Association is not meeting before that
date, will you please make a special effort to
see that your Association is represented? A
