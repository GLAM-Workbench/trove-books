Albert Memorial Hospital, at Wollongong.
The Committee of the Hospital most respectfully solicit your subscription, to carry on the working expenses of the
Institution.
The House was opened to receive patients in October last, and the Committee have incurred considerable outlay
in purchasing medicines, furniture, bedding, tyc,, for the use and comfort of the sick. Several cases of sickness and
severe accidents have been relieved and satisfactorily attended to. As similar cases will always exist in our community,
the Committee earnestly appeal to your benevolent feelings for some assistance for the relief of the unfortunate poor in
our district who may require maintenance and medical or surgical aid during illness andâ€™ affliction.
The Institution is established under the Act of Council 11th Vic., No. 59, and the Government regularly grant
an equal sum to that subscribed by private benevolence. George Hewlett, Esq. {manager of the E. S. and A. C. Bank
at Wollongong'), the Treasurer of the Hospital, will, on receiving your subscription, immediately acknowledge the receipt
thereof.
By direction of Committee,
JOHN BIGG AR,
Honorary Secretary,
