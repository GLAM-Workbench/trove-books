STAINED GLASS OPUS MOSAIC


INTRODUCTION
IN PRESENTING this booklet of Stained Glass
Windows and Opus Sectile Mosaic, Brooks,
Robinson Pty. Ltd. would call your attention to
the fact that the reproductions are of pen
drawings, which give only a very limited idea
of the finished work. The beauty of a window
lies mainly in the harmonious blending of
colour in the glass—the artist in Stained Glass
"hangs his colour-music in the light."
It is the aim of Brooks, Robinson Pty. Ltd.,
who have been established for over 85 years,
to produce Stained Glass Windows and Mosaics
consistent with the best traditions of the art,
and to give practical help to those seeking to
beautify the Church.
There can be no more beautiful form of
memorial than the Stained Glass Window. The
grandeur of a Church interior—the lofty roofs
—call for the mellow light afforded by this
class of decoration, to give that calm beauty
looked for in a place of worship.
Opus Sectile Mosaic as a medium for wall
decoration is unsurpassed; its advantages over
other forms of decoration are its superb beauty,
reasonable cost, and permanence. The material
is of such a nature that it has an affinity with
the Stained Glass, thus giving harmonious
completeness to the interior of the Church.
Advice as to subjects, costs, and coloured
designs will be gladly submitted.
