Opening Hymn.
Tune — Wareham.
Wisdom, and might, and love are thine ;
Prostrate before Thy face we fall,
Confess thine attributes divine,
And hail the sovereign Lord of all.
■ATHEE. of all! whose powerful voice
Called forth this universal frame ;
Whose mercies over all rejoice,
Through endless ages still the same;
Thou by thy word upholdest all;
Thy bounteous love to all is showed,
Thou hear’st thy every creature’s call,
And fillest every mouth with good.
Thee, sovereign Lord, let all confess
That moves in earth, or air, or sky,
Revere thy power, Thy goodness bless
Tremble before Thy piercing eye ;
All ye who owe to Him your birth,
In praise your every hour employ;
Jehovah reigns ! be glad, 0 earth !
And shout, ye morning stars, for joy!
In heaven thou reign’st enthroned in light,
Nature’s expanse beneath thee spread,
Earth, air, and sea, before thy sight,
And hell’s deep gloom, are open laid;
Prayer.
Allen.

Turn — Leoni.
BHE God of Abraham praise,
Who reigns enthroned above,
Ancient of everlasting days,
And God of love :
The God of Abraham praise.
Whose all sufficient grace
Shall guide me all my happy days,
In all my ways.
He calls a worm his friend,
He calls himself my God;
And he shall save me to the end,
Through Jesu’s blood.
Jehovah, Great I AM,
By earth and heaven confcst;
I bow and bless the sacred name,
For ever blest.
The God of Abraham praise,
At whose supreme command
Prom eai-th I rise, and seek the joys
At his right hand ;
I all on earth forsake,
He by himself hath sworn,
I on his oath depend;
I shall, on eagles’ wings upborne,
To heaven ascend:
I shall behold his face,
I shall his power adore,
And sing the wonders of his grace
For evermore.
Its wisdom, fame, and power ;
And him my only Portion make.
My Shield and Tower.

Hymn. Tune — Grosvenor.
||iHOU God of glorious majesty,
Sy To Thee, against myself, to Thee,
A worm of earth, I cry;
A half-awakened child of man ;
An heir of endless bliss or pain ;
A sinner born to die !
Lo! on a narrow neck of land,
’Twixt two unbounded seas I stand,
Secure, insensible;
A point of time, a moment’s space,
Removes me to that heavenly place,
Or shuts me up in hell.
0 God, mine inmost sold convert!
And deeply on my thoughtful heart
Eternal things impress:
Give me to feel their solemn weight,
And tremble on the brink of fate,
And wake to righteousness.
Before me place, in dread array.
The pomp of that tremendous day.
When Thou with clouds shalt come
To judge the nations at thy bar;
And tell me, Lord, shall I be there
To meet a joyful doom ?
Be this my one great business here,
With serious industry and fear
Eternal bliss to ensure ;
Thine utmost counsel to fulfil,
And suffer all Thy righteous will,
And to the end endure.
Then, Saviour, then my sold receive,
Transported from this vale to live
And reign with thee above:
Where faith is sweetly lost in sight,
And hope in full supreme delight,
And everlasting love.
Address—“ Charles Wesley”.. .. .. .. Rev, J. G. MILLARD
Hymn.
Tune —Praise
Our conflicts here shall soon be past,
And you and I ascend at last,
Triumphant with our Head.
KOME on, my partners in distress,
My comrades through the wilderness,
Who still your bodies feel;
Awhile forget your griefs and fears,
And look beyond this vale of tears,
To that celestial hill.
That great mysterious Deity
We soon with open face shall see;
The beatific sight
Shall fill heaven’s sounding courts with praise.
And wide diffuse the golden blaze
Of everlasting light.
Beyond the bounds of time and space,
Look forward to that heavenly place,
The saints’ secure abode;
On faith’s strong eagle pinions rise,
And force your passage to the skies,
And scale the mount of God.
The Father shining on his throne,
The glorious co-eternal Son,
The Spirit, one and seven,
Conspire our rapture to complete;
And lo! we fall before his feet,
And silence heightens heaven.
Who suffer with our Master here,
We shall before His face appear,
And by His side sit down ;
To patient faith the prize is sure,
And all that to the end endure
In hope of that ecstatic pause,
Jesus, we now sustain the cross,
And at Thy footstool fall;
Till Thou our hidden life reveal,
Till Thou our ravished spirits fill.
And God is all in all!
The cross, shall wear the crown.
Thrice blessed, bliss-inspiring hope!
It lifts the fainting spirits up,
It brings to life the dead;

Hymn (composed expressly for Jubilee by Eev. J. Watsford).
For Tune see next page.
Glory in the highest!
lii Give we, blessed Lord, to Thee ;
Shout aloud our glad hosannas,
Sing our songs of Jubilee !
Help, 0 help us, gracious Saviour !
With Thy love our hearts inflame ;
By Thy Holy Spirit teach us
How to praise Thy glorious name!
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
In loud and glad hosannas ;
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
In songs of Jubilee.
Fifty years all crowned with blessing,
Fifty years of wondrous grace,
Call for all our heart’s devotion,
Call for songs of fervent praise.
Blessed Lord, we come before Thee,
Gather round thy mercy seat;
Here, in grateful adoration,
Pour our tribute at Thy feet!
For the Church we love we praise Thee,
For the light that shines so clear,
For the earnest, faithful workers,
For the truth we hold so dear;
For our blessed bond of union,
For our fellowship and love,
For our friends on earth who serve Thee :
For our sainted ones above.
For sustaining grace we praise Thee,
When oppressed with doubts and fears.
When in fierce and fiery conflicts,
When the seed we sowed in tears;
Thine alone be all the glory,
Now we sing the victor’s song,
Now the glad, rejoicing reapers
Bring the heavy sheaves along.
Poor and rich we come to bless Thee,
Young and old our voices raise,
Thousands, thousands all rejoicing,
Meet to-day to sing Thy praise;
Sainted friends from heavenly mansions
Join unseen our happy throng,
Strike their golden harps of glory,
Help to swell the joyful song.
Not with empty words we praise Thee,
In our hands our gifts we bring,
None too great and none to costly,
Offerings to our Saviour Bang.
Heavenly Father now accept us;
On the altar all we lay;
Let the holy fire, descending.
Sanctify us all to-day.
