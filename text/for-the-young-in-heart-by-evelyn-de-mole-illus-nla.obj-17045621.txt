What I shall do, when I’m a man.

Like a great big bird,
With the noisiest engine
You ever heard.

Or be a pirate, so fierce and bold,
With a big tall ship all full of gold.

Or else a knight,
On a big black horse,
Rescuing ladies from dragons, of course;
Or a cannibal chief
Of a fierce dark race;
Or a grand LORD MAYOR
Who carries a mace.


*£ *® ) N
P’raps I’ll join a circus,
And be chief clown
And ride in a caravan up and down.
Or commander brave, of a big submarine;
Or a driver of engines all painted green.
It’s dreadfully hard to know what to be,
For I want to be something BIG you see.


c ßuttercups
/Our skirts are golden petals,
Of sun-kissed yellow hue.
And in the morning early
We don the glist’ning dew.
Our stalks are tall and slender,
And we nod unto the breeze
That rustles through the blossoms
Of the golden wattle trees.
You will find us in the hollows,
Where the air is cool and chill,
And you’ll find us in the sunlight,
On a little sloping hill.


lights are out,
And prayers are said,
And we’ve been safely tucked in bed;
We wait until the moonlight falls,
Making bright patches on the walls.
And then —when all the house is still,
We tip-toe to the window sill.
There —standing in the moonlight bright,
We see the gum trees,
Tall and slight.
Then, in and out of the bracken fern,
Whirling and twirling
With many a turn,
The brownies dance beneath the trees,
And fairies flutter through the leaves.
While bats and owls
Flit here and there,
With glow-worm lights just everywhere.
Wee gnomes among the toadstools play,
And tiny elves on grasses sway.
We stand and watch —
We know they’re there!
Though Nursie says: —
"Just dreams, my dear!”


c Wattles
/Oh! for the joy of a tramp
In the dawning,
In the clear, crisp air
Of an August morning.
Where all among the green
Is the gorgeous golden sheen
Of the wattles —
Golden wattles of the morning.

here are all sorts of things in a pool that I know,
Lovely live things, that live deep down below.
There are gold fish, and brown fish —
I’ve seen two or three —
And I make little boats from the bark of a tree.

There are crayfish, and bull frogs,
And beetles and things—
And a bird in a bush, that warbles and sings.
There’s a bulrush and lilies that sway in the breeze—
And I make little boats from the bark of the trees.

And the things in the pool
Come and bow down to me.

And the pirates make boats from the bark of a tree

Or Indians creep through the trees as my foe,
And I watch, and I wait, with my arrows and bow;
Then I shoot —and they fall!
And I count —"One, two, three!”
And I scape in my boat, made from bark of a tree.

M tNative £Bear
CJ am a little native bear,
So very, very wee,
I ride upon my mother’s back
When climbing a gum tree.
I push my claws into her fur,
And there I simply cling,
As she gathers little juicy leaves
On slender boughs, that swing,
And when we’re very tired,
And want a little sleep,
My mother finds a forked bough,
And into it we creep.
Then off again we scamper,
In and out among the leaves.
It’s nice to be a native bear
A-living in the trees.
[i3l


SMy £Bunny
Cj was playing with my bunny
In the scrub to-day,
And the naughty little fellow
Hid himself away.
I searched in the bushes
Growing everywhere.
And I said to a magpie,
"You have a sharp eye,
Can you see my bunny anywhere here?”
I spoke to a robin, sitting on a bough;
"I have lost my bunny—
I don’t know how.
Oh! have you seen him, hidden in the grass?”
And he said, "Sorry, I didn’t see him pass.”
I’ve hunted in the bracken and all along the creek,
I think he must be playing a game of hide-and-seek!
But, sitting on a stump, that was standing near
Was an old laughing jack—
And he said, laughing back,
"I see your bunny in a hole —just there!”

c 5? SBush ‘tfire
Ciyflashing, flashing, through the windy night;
Burning, spurning, in its lurid light;
Smashing, crashing, all the forest through,
Whirling, twirling clouds of sullen hue.
Flaming, flaming, nearer, ever near,
Flying, dying creatures, mad with fear.
Stumbling, stumbling, hooves that race away,
Wond’ring, wond’ring, that night be turned to day
Fiercely, fiercely burning, gum trees tall,
Silhouetted grimly against the fiery wall.


Greek
CTXlowing down the hillside,
Through the scrub and trees,
Little rushes on the banks
Swaying in the breeze.
Sparkling over pebbles,
Gurgling everywhere,
Waving water-lily leaves,
And dainty maidenhair.
Splashing over rocks and stones
Making a cascade.
Slipping into silent pools
Deep ’neath willow shade.
Out again and onward,
Ever larger growing,
Bending, twisting, till at last
To the river flowing.

M Pessimist
bull-frog croaked in our pond all day,
He never had anything nice to say.
Daddy called him a "pessimis.”
Wonder what a "pessimis” is?


~ > 1 ' I ,**>?.-*••■
I asked the frog
If he understood,
But he only croaked,
"No good! No good!”


He croaked that little frogs were rude,
He croaked about his daily food,
He croaked that water in the pool
Was now too hot, and now too cool.
I asked him if
He really would
Say something else,
But he croaked —"No good!”

One day, no croaks came from the pool —
I went there on my way to school.
An old grey crane, on one leg stood;
He winked his eye, and then he said —
"Quite Good!”
Daddy says "That a pessimis,
If he croaks too much,
Always ends like this!”
[2l]


c White Sums
C£g}hen the moon is very bright,
And the earth so calm and still —
I watch the slender white gums,
A-dancing on the hill.
And I seem to see them gliding,
In and out, and to and fro,
To a melody, most lovely,
That all the woodlands know.
[22]


ohn S
CfaTw o small ’possums
Have come to live near John
Such soft fur,
And fluffy tails so long;
Such sharp claws,
And soft brown eyes so bright.
John says —
"They sleep all day
And play about at night.”
It’s very, very funny,
But I think that p’raps he’s right.
John says —
"You never know,
P’raps we’ll have a peep,
And see them play in dreamland,
When we are fast asleep.”


Gives
£7\ancing in the moonlight
I see a tiny elf!
Often, from my window
I watch him, by myself.
Here he twirls, there he whirls,
Dancing through the trees.
He looks so like a fallen leaf
Blowing in the breeze.
Sometimes, while I’m watching,
Another green elf comes —
A jolly little chap, who climbs
Right up the slim white gums.
When I see them playing,
I wish I was an elf,
Instead of just a lonely boy,
Playing by myself.
I look up to the full moon,
And ask the old man there,
Why I’m not a little elf
Dancing everywhere?
But he seems to wink his eye,
Then to shake his head.
"Sorry I can’t make you one,”
I think is what he said.

m e was such a happy lad,
Life gave him all it had
Of joy, and fun and laughter.
But the fairies came one day,
And he followed them away.
Yet, when the day is still,
You may hear across the hill
The echo,
echo,
echo,
Of his laughter.


[26]


c (s>he Q)oll
Cl shall I do
With my dear old doll?
She is awfully plain,
And her name is Poll.
Shall I put her in a box away
And take her out
On a sunny day?
Her face is all flat,
And her nose is snub
(I’ve washed her twice
In my own bath tub.)
And both her eyes are a lovely blue,
And she seems to look just right through you
I think I must keep her close to me here.
Because you see,
She is very dear.


c (s>he £yre £Bird
Cf wonder whether you have heard
That marvellous singer—the lyre-bird?
Its haunts are few and far between,
So shy a bird —’tis rarely seen.
He chooses his gully, deep and still,
Where far, far down, flows a little rill —
Where grow the gum trees, straight and tall
And graceful tree-ferns, large and small.
There, in this restful spot, you’ll hear
The lyre bird’s song —so sweet and clear.
He sings in rapture, with tail outspread
In feathery cascade over his head.
He builds a mound, on which he will sing
His liquid notes in songs of Spring.
He copies sounds, both far and near.
A raucous motor-horn we hear —
Then the gentle twitter of tiny things—
The whip-bird’s song to us he brings.
Now, far off, comes the parrot’s cry —
Black cockatoos call from the sky—
While on his mound, he leaps and dances,
Watching the nest, for his mate’s shy glances


£ost
re those my footprints
In the hot dry sand?
Coo-ee! Coo-ee! Coo-ee!
Will no one hear
In this desolate land?
COO-EE!
Coo-ee!
Coo-ee!
How many hours
Since I lost my way —
Staggering blindly
Through night and day?
Sometimes, far off is the glittering sea
With ships —just coming straight to me
And sometimes water —
Fresh water, clear!
I struggle on —
But it is not there!
"Coo-ee!” I cry
To the hard blue sky,
"Will no one hear me
Before I die”


Qossips
ff Cf hear,” said a robin,
While preening his wings,
"A number of really most interesting things.”
And all of the birds who were ready for bed,
Drew their heads from their wings
And listened instead.
"Mrs. Duck-bill Platypus,
Who is really most queer,
Is moving her house, to the creek over there.
Her new home, I am told, is exceedingly damp,
But she can do things, that would give me the cramp!”
"Do you know,” said the magpie, "the scandal I heard?
They say she lays eggs —
Yet she isn’t a bird!”
"It’s true,” said a parrot, as she nipped off a bud,
"I know she wears fur,
And she wallows in mud!”
The birds fluffed their feathers,
And quivered with shame,
Then they turned up their beaks
At the platypus dame!


( ~ Dingo’s lament
Cf n the days of long ago,
We were free to come and go,
When the black man trod the waste
Of sand and stone.
We could pass our time in ease,
—Or hunt, if it should please,
When we felt the strength
Of youth and blood and bone.
Oh! ’twas—Kill! Kill! Kill!
Be watchful there —and still!
While the black man threw his spear
And boomerang.
Those days are past and spent,
When we dingoes came and went
In the freedom of the land
That was our own.
Now the fight with man begins
With his traps and baits and things.
And the wild dog
Dies in agony —alone!
Oh! ’tis Kill! Kill! Kill!
Be watchful dogs —and still! —
While the white man baits his trap
With poisoned bone!
[3O


P arly in the morning,
You hear the magpies sing
In their lovely liquid notes so like a flute.
When all the scrub is murmuring
To the joyous call of Spring,
And Pan is playing softly on his lute.
And when the sun is mounting
In the warm, blue sky,
And touching every leaf and bud and shoot,
You will hear the chortle, chortle
Of the young magpie,
With Pan just playing softly on his lute.
Now as the sun is setting,
And the shadows growing long,
Afar off in the distance is the owl’s first hoot,
Then you hear the magic music
Of the magpies’ evensong,
And Pan just playing softly on his lute.

c 57 battle {Bird
wattle bird perched on an old wattle tree,
A terrible scolding bird was he!
He scolded his friends!
He scolded his foes!
He scolded just everyone —
Goodness knows.
Be quick! be quick!" and
Get up!'’ were his cries.
Most surprising remarks
For a bird of his size.
[34]


cKangaroos
/Cih! have you seen the Kangaroos
Go hopping through the scrub
In twos?
They’ve funny legs,
And great big tails,
And they Jump,
—Jump,
—Jump
Along the trails.
I am sure there’s one,
And there may be two,
A-hopping about in the London Zoo.
[3s]


Shall c We do?
C7 /Vyhere shall we go?
I think I know —
Over the hills where the soft winds blow
And the golden blossoms
Wave to and fro.
Shall we go to the stream
So softly flowing
And gather the fern
Just newly growing?
Shall we hunt beneath the leafy bowers
For orchids shy —
And other flowers?
Or be still on the grass,
Looking up thro’ the trees,
Just watching the birds,
And all the bees;
And follow the little clouds
Floating high
Like soft fluffy feathers,
Adrift in the sky?

“-(Ehe <Smu
ave 7 0U seen that strange bird in the Zoo?
It is called the Australian Emu.
Its body’s too big, its head is too small,
The neck far too long, and legs much too tall.
Its eggs are too large for one man to eat,
They are laid in the sand, and hatched in the heat
The wings are no help, so it uses its feet,
There never was race-horse with paces so fleet.
The legs, with no feathers, are bare as your hand,
It hasn’t a nest —just a hole in the sand.
I think you’ll agree that you never have heard
Of a creature more strange in the way of a bird.

got some jacks,
Real laughing jacks!
They’ve built in the hollow of an old gum tree
When the shadows grow long,
You will hear their merry song —
(Though it isn’t a song, just a cackle of glee!)
Ha! ha! HA! hee! he! HEE! ....
But it isn’t a song, just a cackle of glee!
Ha! ha! HA! hee! he! HEE! . . .


Scrub-land
/Cl ur scrub-land in the Spring-time
Is a gorgeous sight to see.
Where all about are flowers
On bush and plant and tree.
Wattles and mimosas
Are blooming everywhere,
And the scent of their sweet blossoms
Is filling all the air.
There, in the sunny hollows,
Are buttercups so gay,
While orchids, blue and white and pink,
Among the grasses sway.
About the stony hillsides
Are lilacs, white and blue,
With native heath, in red and white,
Of ever-varying hue.


On the c War-path
warriors creeping through
At night;
Sharp calls of startled birds, then —
Silence!
Swift scurrying of things
In fright.
Darkness covering all —
Most dense.
Mopoke’s cry, so weird and near,
Snap of twig, ’neath stealthy feet,
Women’s muffled wails of fear
Far off, in the murky heat.
Sudden rushing through the night!
Shouts and war-cries—
Fierce and shrill!
Sounds of struggling men
Who fight,
Instinct with the lust to kill!
