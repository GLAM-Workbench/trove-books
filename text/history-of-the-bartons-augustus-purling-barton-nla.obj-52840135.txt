CHARLES CUTTS BARTON.


PREFACE.
To my dear brothers Montagu and Geoffrey,
and my dear sisters Harriett and Augusta.
It is my intention to put in writing some of
my recollections ot early days, with feelings of
the most painful regret at having put this off
so long, and that there are now so few of us
left to commune on the past. Our dear brother,
Newton, so lately gone from us, and also our
sister Emily, would have loved to talk of the
old days, and to compare notes and recollections
of things that took place in the long, long
ago, say from about the time of my birth in
1834 forward. At that time all Europe was
at peace, recovering from the effects of the
destructive wars of Napoleon, who was still
a standard topic of conversation among all
classes of people. Steam was coming into
use, but there were few railways in 1834, and
the first one I saw was in 1840, at Dusseldorf,
on the Rhine. In order to introduce the subject
in such a way as to make it a record of any


value, it is necessary to set down hereysome
details, and particularly dates and figures
referring to our family, for which I am indebted
to the Barton pedigree, compiled at great
trouble, diligence, and some expense, by our
dear father and our cousin, the Revd. T. S.
Hill.
Trusting you will forgive all errors and
omissions, and receive this record in the kindly
spirit in which it is compiled. I remain my
dear Brothers and Sisters,
Your affectionate Brother,
Augustus Purling Barton.

History of the Bartons.
My father, Charles Cults Barton, was the
son of the Revd. Charles Barton, of Rownhams,
in the County of Southampton, rector of St.
Andrew’s, Holborn, and of Deane, in the County
of Northampton, and my mother was Emilia
Anne, eldest daughter of Nathaniel Hastings
Middleton, of Charles Street, St. James’, London.
My grandmother Barton was the third
daughter of Matthew Carrett, of Hatton Garden,
London. She was born at Lisbon in 1763, and
married the Revd. Charles Barton, of St.
Andrew’s, Holboin, in 1799, who died December,
1805, leaving behind him three children.
Harriett Elizabeth, born in 1801, afterwards
married to the Revd. Peter Cotes.
My father, Charles Cutts Barton, born in
1802, and Mary Anne born in 1804, who after-
wards married my mother’s brother, Hastings
Nathaniel Middleton, of Bradford Peverell, in
Dorsetshire.
My grandmother was thus left with three
children, Harriett Elizabeth, aged four years;


my father, Charles Cutts, three years; and
Mary Anne, one year.
At seven years of age my father was sent
to a private school, then to Eton, where he
remembered having a holiday foi the Battle
of Waterloo.
From Eton he went to Christ Church, Oxford,
where he took his B.A. degree in 1824, and
manied my mother in 1826.
My eldest brother, Charles Hastings, was
born at Vevey, on the Lake of Geneva, 11th
December, 1828, 82 years ago. Next came
Emilia Anne, born in London, 1830, probably
in Cadogan Square.
Newton, 1831, also in London, and Montagu,
1832, at Walton on Thames. After that the
whole family migrated to the continent. A
large travelling carriage of the old coaching
type was purchased, with imperials, seats up
in front and behind, luggage on top, provision
basket hung behind, a drag and chain under-
neath, and provided the possibility of travelling
from place to place by means of post horses
hired as required. In process of time Munich
was reached, and the family located in the
Hotel Golden Hirsch, and suddenly on the 26th
August, 1834, I made my appearance. I have


been told I was a white-faced baby, hardly
expected to live, but in those days of wetnurses
babies didn’t die. It was to the interest of
the nurse, usually a strong country girl, that
the baby should live.
Vienna. — The first thing I claim some
recollection of is Politi’s Menagery at Vienna,
where they took me to see the monkeys, which
drove me into violent shrieks of terror.
Our parents moved in the best society ;
Count Cescheny was frequently mentioned.
Vienna at that time was a great musical centre,
the Wienerlieder were celebrated, the elder
Strauss was in his glory composing and playing
his beautiful waltzes. A fragment of a comic
song to the tune of Weber’s last hymn, has
remained to me, and I give it as near as I can,
but two of the lines are not quite right.
In meim Sierop haefel
Da war e frauen kafer
Ich habs ausegnommen
Und schlecks ab.
Doch von derem yausen
Tuth mirs heut noch grausen
Denns war kei fraue kafer
Swar a schwob.


Kellner uni mir springe
Und e bier mir bringe
Nur kie saugeschlatter
Stellst mir vor.
Younker mit de done bocken
Und de lame locken
Dumm Kopf heist du
Des e bier ?
A Hungarian nobleman lent us his country
residence, Scholmar, for the summer, and we
were received with all the honours bestowed
on the nobles of Hungary. Pesth was the next
place reached, and Nathaniel Cox, my next
younger brother, was born there, March 1837.
Our father took a trip to Belgrade, and smoked
a pipe with the Turkish Pasha.
After a couple of years spent in Hungary and
Austria, including a visit to Saltzburg and
Bergdesgaden, where the bone carvings are
made, we journeyed towards Dresden, and
Tdplitz Schandow and Carlsbad were visited
on our way through Bohemia, and about here
my earliest reliable recollections may be said
to begin. We had a favourite spotted pointer,
Beak was his name, and he lived in a basket
slung under the carriage, going along one day


at a moderate pace, one of us children threw
some bread or biscuits out of the window;
Beak made a rush for it, the wheel of the carriage
went over his neck, and poor Beak was dead.
Another day we were going over a high mountain
range between Schandow and Carlsbad, there
was a fog, and snow lay in patches over the
country, we overtook a man driving a cart,
and hanging down its head and neck behind
there was a dead horse in the cart. I remember
it as well as if it was to-day. Of Carlsbad, I
can remember the people walking about the
Sprudle. We lived in a little house on a hill,
and must have been there some months. Aunt
Minna or Aunt Augusta, or both, were with
us that summer, and Aunt Minna gave me a
red tin pump that pumped water when the
bottom part was filled with water. Then at
Schandow there were some pigeons brought
in for us to make pets of, some one cut their
wings to keep them from flying away, and they
cut too close, and the birds were bleeding ;
how horrors fix themselves in a child’s mind.
There was also a very sad thing happened, a
thing I have repented of for seventy years,
and am sorry for still. Someone gave us a
beautiful snow-white rabbit, I am almost sure


it was the milk woman that brought it. It
was in an outhouse, a square room with close
walls, and I played with it, and swung it round
and round, holding it by its ears, and by-and-by
the labbit was dead, and I was sony and
frightened, and afraid to tell anyone I did it,
till many years after I told Emily. There
was a Kirchweihe, a festival of the consecration
of the church, and an immense number of cakes
were made, cakes and open tarts a foot across,
and there was not room for them on the tables,
so a large room was cleared of furniture and
the cakes were all arranged in dishes on the
floor, hundreds of them. I don’t know who
ate them, and whether they survived.
Dresden. — There was a bridge, I think a
new one, and that the previous one had been
blown up by Napoleon, and there was a house
with a cannon ball sticking in it close by the
bridge. Then there was a confectioner, where
we got coffee and cakes and ice creams, in a
large room with glass windows and glass all
round, on a terrace paved with stone alongside
the river Elbe, and Baldini was his name.
And then there was the skeleton of a whale in a
long building, and we all went to see it. There
was a pleasure garden some distance out of


the town, and they called it the Milchgarten,
where you got milk and other drinks, and there
was a band and music, and they had cows,
and one of the cows went mad, perhaps it was
because the music was bad, and they put
chains and ropes on the cow, and she was led
away to be killed we were told, and there was
a great crowd. There were English people
living at Dresden, there was a Mrs. Barton ;
I think she was the mother of Captain Barton,
that went to Sydney, got a grant of land,
introduced Saxon merino sheep, and left a
large family behind him. I remember being
taken to see old Mrs. Barton, and she said she
would show me a little monkey, she had a looking
glass with a curtain over it, and she pulled the
curtain to one side and made me see myself
in the glass—please remember this was about
1837, when I was three. I think we must
have had a house in the New-stadt, it was a
quiet place. We had a fine big playroom
with a great bow window, and to get into the
bow window on a higher level there was a step ;
so one of us originated the idea of making a
fountain by making a horizontal hole in the
step with a gimlet and a perpendicular hole
from the top, then by pouring in water we


could have a fountain. I, aged four, was
boring from the top, and Natty, aged three,
put his finger in to see if the hole was through,
the gimlet caught his finger and held it, and I
had not sense enough to reverse, and there was
a great to do, and the fountain was a failure,
but the marks on the step remained for many
a day and may be there yet. Robert Crofts
was bom in Dresden on the 6th October,
1838. Some time after he was very ill and the
doctor ordered him a bath of hot beer, which
he had, and I suppose it did him good. We
drove one day to a country place belonging
to Herr Schonberg, who had merino sheep,
which were largely exported to New South
Wales. I remember a long building, perhaps
a hundred yards long, with windows all round
near the roof, and a door extending from top
to bottom. The sheep lived in there all the
winter. The beginning of winter the shed is
cleared out to some feet below the surrounding
country, and the sheep descend into it. When
the spring comes and warm weather the sheep
are let out and they have then to come down,
such is the accumulation from the fodder and
manure. I can remember all this perfectly,
and there was a goat house, and a wicked old


billy with a long beard. There were some
English people, we did not like the Barnards,
we said they were mean and their children
kept too strict and half starved. I remember
father had a beautiful little ship made of bright
tin, about two feet long, and he took us out
in his boat, for, of course, he had a boat to sail
it in the middle of the river, it was just above
the bridge, and the beautiful ship got full of
water and went down, and we never got it
again. Then there was the Saxon Switzerland
we went to, how far away I don’t know, all
rugged sandstone mountains and cliffs like the
Blue Mountains in New South Wales, and there
was a big snake transfixed through the head
by father’s alpenstock. In winter the floating
ice came down in great masses, and blocked
up above the bridge, and we heard them filing
cannon to bleak up the blockades of ice to
save the bridge.
I next remember Dusseldorf. I don’t know
why we went theie or bow. was the
Breitenbacher Hof, the best hotel, and our
house in the Grabenstrasse. Then there was
the picture gallery, one of the best in the world,
for Dusseldorf is the home and centre of painting
in Germany. I remember the carnival, and


Charles and Newton went out in dominos and
masks before it had properly begun, and got
laughed at by all the small boys. We af terwa rds
moved into a house almost out in the country.
I foiget the name of the street, it was opposite
a big pond or lake, and adjoining the labora-
torium, a depot for arms or arsenal, and probably
arms were made or repaired there. There was
only one house beyond ours, where a major
Rbhl lived, and his boy was continually shooting
sparrows greatly to out indignation ; after that
there was a wide expanse of sandhills and hol-
lows, and in the distance of a mile or two stood
the powder magazine, a tall building with
sentries marching round it. Kitty was born
here in June, 1840, not in the powder magazine,
but in our house. I remember we had in our
nursery a long roll of pictures of all the Kings
and Queens of England, ending with Victoria,
lately crowned or married. Under one end of
the house were some big doors, and a wide place
leading to the stable yard, and theie oui big
travelling carriage stood all the time we wexe
at Dusseldorf. I think we must have been
good obedient children, foi I don’t remember
any of us ever clambering upon or getting
into that carriage. The doors were locked,


the windows and shutters were up, and it was
covered by a huge tarpaulin. We had a walled-
in garden behind the house where we played,
and had our little separate gardens, and father
had a beautiful garden in the ground adjoining
and behind the laboratorium, where he grew
peas and beans and all kinds of vegetables for
our use, and we only went there very seldom,
as some of us would run on the beds, especially
our youngest brother Robert. One day Bobby
tumbled head first into the tub for watering
the garden, it was full of water, and he would
certainly have been drowned had not Natty,
aged about five, pluckily pulled him out, while
I ran off crying for assistance. It was a very
hot summer, Papa had to go to England.
When he returned he was horrified to see the
grass and the garden dried up. He brought
a cask of English beer with him and a big tin
case of picnic biscuits made in the forms of
hares and rabbits. I have never seen any like
them since. The beer was sour, so papa put
several pounds ot raisins into it to correct it,
but it didn’t answer, so the beer was let go
down the drain that ran into the garden, and
we collected some of the raisins and ate them.
Under the roof of the house there was a large
B


garret with dormer windows. We used to play
up there sometimes, and papa killed wild cats
up there. We had such enormous giant
pumpkins in our garden. We scooped the
insides out, and Newton and Chailes put candles
inside, lit them, and stuck them in the gairet
windows. Presently, a ciowd assembled in
front of the house. They declared the house
was on fire, and ultimately became aggressive
and abusive, the police siding with them, as
they always did at Dusseldorf. There was a
Publick garden, with an artificial hill in the
middle, called Ananasberg, with a restaurant,
and some trees at the top, and a beautiful white
cockatoo, that flew about the garden perfectly
free.
Delitia, we called her Lilly, was born at
Dusseldorf, in September, 1841. There was
a cold winter, the ponds frozen hard, and we
all learnt to skate, and after the thaw there
came a wild duck, a pochard and swam about
in the middle of the pond. All the local
sportsmen tiled their guns on this bird but
could not reach it, they had no Ely’s green
cartridges, but father had, and he shot the
duck, and Bello, our setter, brought it to land
to the feet of a policeman, who walked off with


the duck, and sent a summons for trespass on
my lather, who had to answer the charge next
day. He demonstrated that others had shot
and got nothing, but he having shot the duck
was to be prosecuted. I don’t know how it
ended, but I believe papa did not get his duck
and had something to pay. Still, it was worth
it. Our faithful old English nurse, Nusan,
left us at Dusseldorf. Our governess was
Cecilia, a splendidly educated and amiable
woman. Charles and Newton had a German
tutor, Herr Yanke. Cecilia and Yanke did
not agiee, and Herr Yanke did not like our
climbing in at his bedroom window overlooking
the garden, and throwing his socks out. Yanke
was a splendid teacher and great at classics
and general knowledge, and he encouraged in
Charles a taste for both which lasted his lifetime.
I remember on the evening of father’s birthday,
Charles repeated to him from memory part or
the whole of the Iliad of Homer in Greek,
and I remember father stopping him and saying
he thought that was enough. What became
of Yanke I cannot say. He must have left
us at Dusseldorf when Charles went to Eton.
While we lived at Dusseldorf father rented a
manor to shoot over in partnership with an


Englishman, I think Mr. Langley, and the
Manor was somewhere on the Elberfeldt railway
then being completed either at Er kraut or
Vowinkle. On one occasion Langley stopped
all night in the forest to watch for a fox or wolf.
In the night he looked up and saw two eyes
red glaring at him ; he fired, and shot his own
dog. One day father was out on the manor
and he saw a large hawk flying over the trees ;
he fired, and the hawk dropped, a snipe all
ready plucked for cooking. During the time
that hot summer when fattier had to go to Eng-
land, took place that awful catastrophe, the burn-
ing of Hamburg. For several days there was a
dense smoke, and our house linen and clothes
put out to bleach on the grass, as is always done
in that part of Germany, were covered with
small pieces of charcoal. There was no through
railway then and no telegraph, and Hamburg
200 miles away. At last came the news
accounting for the smoke and charcoal carried
by the wind and the heated air 200 miles.
The Rhine looked a terrible river when in ice
and flood. Huge blocks of ice floating rapidly
past for days and days, and the lower parts
of the town were flooded. In hot summer
weather it was pleasant to be on the river.


There was a ferry boat taking horses, cows
and carts and passengers across the river.
I have always liked the smell of tar since crossing
by that ferry, and I am of opinion that the
beautiful song —
Es gingen drei burschen wohl über dem Rhine
Und bei der frau wirthin da kerten sie ein
originated there ; a small collection of houses,
and probably a Publick House on the other
side would lead one to think so. There was a
swimming school at Dusseldorf, and I daresay
is there yet, a narrow platform enclosing a
portion of the river about half an acre in extent,
a hand-rail ran all round the half-acre, and
steps at intervals led into the water. The
swimming master handed his pupils as a fisher-
man his fish, only the line was attached to a
belt round the pupil’s waist. No pupil was
allowed into the water by himself until he could
swim a sufficient distance, to the satisfaction
of the teacher, and the way the pupils were
handled along round that half-acre of water
they had to swim. Newton and Charles both
learnt to swim there, and I saw them doing it.
Poor little Delitia was born in 1841, and
this brings me to the time when we left
Dusseldorf on our way to Stuttgardt, where


Harriett was born in 1842. How we went I
cannot remember, but I think it was by
steamboat on the Rhine as far as Meinz, and
then by rail to Frankfort, and in our own
carriage all the way to Stuttgardt. When
the big travelling carriage, now on its last
journey, arrived at Frankfort, it was found
that one of the wheels was locked, and could
not revolve, nor could it be taken off. The
oil used in the patent axle, probably linseed,
had solidified. By means of fire it was got
off, and I can remember the wheel being
trundled across the big square at Frankfort.
The next place I remember is Bruckenau.
We lived in a house about half a mile from
the Kursaal, facing at right angles the avenue
leading to it, and on the side of a steep hill.
A double stone staircase led to the uppec
rooms, occupied by an English family named
Filders, an officer in the English Commis-
sariat, tnat afterwards distinguished himself
lamentably in the Crimea. He had a son
that had a hungei disease, and was continually
calling out to their English maid, Grace Bread !
Underneath this house there was also an
ice cellar full of game, venison and other eatables,
hares, etc. Supplies used to come in and go


out as wanted to the Hotel Kitchen. We
had our meals at the Kursaal, and dinner
lasted two hours, of which we got very weary.
The sweet, little stewed carrots were very
nice, and so was the apple Charlotte, which
we got once a week. Real apple Charlotte
made with pie crust and rusks and currants
and raisins and nice fresh apples. I remember
one evening we met Lord Arundel and his family,
and mother, who was very proud of us, intro-
duced us all. I remember his lordship patted
me on the head and asked my age, and I said
eight. The mad King Ludwig w-as staying
with all his court at the palace of Bruckenau.
He was having great fun with a stout lady
with whom he contracted a mock marriage
while we were there. There was a grand
procession to a celebrated oak tree, the branches
of which were supported by rods of iron from
the central stem, truly a historic tree, might
have been planted by Charlemagne. We were
all there, and every one was dressed in fancy
costume. Aftei the ceiemony everyone got
presents, and some very funny ones creating
roars of laughter. We then wandered all about
the palace grounds, terraces and gardens, and
there were some lovely black currants, the
first I had tasted, and have liked ever since.


Some little distance from our own house
theie was a beautiful open forest of large oak
trees, and in the midst a pool of clear water,
it was called the Sinn Brunnen. We were all
out there one day, and it was very hot, and
Cecilia and all of us boys and girls took off our
boots and stockings, and we sat round the
Sinn Brunnen with our legs in the water ;
there were no rushes or bushes, just beautiful
short grass to the water’s edge. Suddenly
appeared King Ludwig of Bavaria, his beautiful
bride on his arm, and all his court following
in a long train behind him. They were also
having a picnic. We could not escape, and
there was no cover, so we sat still where we
were. I can remember the way the court
ladies put up their eye glasses as they passed.
Bruckenau was the first place I saw charcoal
used for cooking. I think it was made from
birch or beach saplings, and came in long
sticks 3 or 4 inches thick. There was a little
stream near our house ran through the
ploughed fields, and the sun was very hot,
and the water dried up, and we caught thousands
of minnows. I have only a vague recollection
of our journey to Stuttgardt, great heat and
genera] weariness, horses being changed or


watered and fed on black bread. There was
a difficulty about beds one night, however, we
got to Stuttgardt, and to a house in the Char-
lotten Strasse, and a horrid house and neigh-
bourhood it was after the beautiful places we
had been in. We had the main building, but
a back wing was occupied by a family with an
objectionable infant boy, called Bercele, and
two ancient maidens, one of whom soon died,
and the other left hurriedly in a blue funk.
As this was in 1842, and she was then about
70, she is probably also dead now. Barcele
did not die then, but he would have died if
he had remained. He made himself ill eating
unripe green gages, and his family left and
took him away. Our green gage trees were
very fine, but over-loaded with fruit, and some
large branches broke off. Our garden was
fairly large, and surrounded by market gardens
and nurseries of trees, flowers, and all sorts
of gardener’s stuff. There was a circular mound
at the bottom of the garden planted with
trees, and a path winding to the top where
was some sort of arbour, but the view was not
good, being on the back slums of the worst
and oldest part of the town. Harriett Ann
was born here in October, 1842. It was in


that garden, and probably during the following
summer that I fell from the swing, and was
lame for months, and have felt it all my life.
I slipped from the seat while father was swinging
me, and fell on one knee. Of course, it was
my fault, but I did not wish my knee to look
like that, leeches were applied, it was a hot
day ; Monty came in and saw it and fell fiat
on the hard stones of the passage. Next to
us was a brewery, and the big casks used to
be rolled to an open space across the street,
and the coopers made a great din getting them
in oi der. There was a printing office somewhere
opposite, and sometimes they made a great
smoke and smell burning linseed oil into printer’s
ink, and there was a pastrycook’s down the
street named Lederhose, in English Leather-
breeches, who made Queen’s tart pastry with
jam and a thick coating of egg froth, and baked,
and very fine it was, and we used to buy slices,
and when Charles came home from Eton or
Oxford a whole tart would come across at a
time.
The chief industries of the place appear to
have been wine and getting stone for building.
The hills outside our part of the town were full
of quanies, and between the quarries, and all


over the hills round Stuttgardt were nothing
but vineyards, with small tool houses and
watchtowers a t intervals scattered all over them,
and the roads had stone walls in most cases
on both sides of them, with steps here and
there to give access to the vineyards. The
stone waggons rolled incessantly past our house.
Stuttgardt lies in a wide valley surrounded
by hills, the sides vineyards and the tops and
tablelands covered with w'oods of beech and
pine, in which we used to take long walks
with father, accompanied by our faithful dog,
Bello, and we used to see roedeer and hares.
An American gentleman bought our big English
carriage, for which we had no further use.
I don’t think he gave much for it, and he was
very wroth because there was not a cover for
it. Our years at Stuttgardt were enlivened
by excursions we made every summer to some
of the pleasure resorts and wateiing places
in the Black Forest. The hrst summer, 1843,
I think w r e were at Liebenzell, a charming
spot where we were duly happy, papa shooting
and fishing for trout, and grayling in the river
Nagold, and we all fished and took long walks.
Theie was the ruined Castle of Liebenzell
high up over the village, a cloth mill, and a


foundry with a huge hammer driven by water
power. And then there came a time of incessant
rain, when the river was in flood, and we could
not go out. There was a theatrical company
staying there, and we got up theatricals, and
there was great fun. There were two charming
young Miss Petit-jean. The following February
1844, Geoffrey was born, and when the summer
came, and we went off as usual to the country, we
went to Imnau, at the back of the Raue Alp, a
pretty little place with a mineral spring and a
good hotel, very quiet, and out of the way.
There was staying at Imnau an old French
gentleman. He had been an officer in the army
of Napoleon, had been in the expedition to
Russia, and the retreat from Moscow, had been
left in a dying condition in the village of Imnau,
where his life was saved through the kindness
of a peasant’s family, particularly that of their
young daughter Katharine. He came back
thirty-two years after, put his head in at the
door of the peasant’s cottage, and said is
Katharine there ? Yes, Katharine was there
with a child in her arms and a number round
her, some grown up as big as herself. History
does not say whether he gave her anything.
Perhaps he was too poor, or perhaps he thought


virtue was its own reward. Let us hope he did
give hei something. lam sure he did. Here,
at Imnau, Geoffrey developed a bad throat,
and mamma getting alarmed, a doctor was
sent for to the University town of Tubingen.
The doctor came. Dr. Rosas examined the
child, tried to force his mouth open, result
choking, and a sudden operation of tracheotomy
artificial respiration, and his life was saved.
For weeks he lived and breathed through
a silver pipe in his throat. Meanwhile, the
tonsilitis, the cause of the Rouble, disappeared,
and he recovered completely to become after-
wards a General in the British Army, and an
honour to his country. During this illness,
and in consequence thereof, mother moved
to Tubingen, to nurse her patient and to be
near the doctor. Dr. Rosas came every day,
he was engaged to be married to a young girl,
who was learning cooking and housekeeping
in the hotel, so you may be sure he did not fail
to appear every day, and some of us were
allowed to come to see mamma and Geoffrey.
We had settled in a little watering place,
Niedernau, not far from Rothenburg, and an
easy distance from Tubingen. Father had
some good shooting at Niedernau. There were


Roman remains near Rothenburg, and we
explored an ancient aqueduct that in the times
of the Romans had carried water to Rothenburg,
and we followed it for miles thiough hills to
the source of the stream that supplied the
water. Father had at that time with him an
English made boomerang of ash, artihcally
curved, which was a great source of pleasure
to us at Niedernau and the inhabitants thereof.
The next summer we were again at Liebenzell,
but before going there we had moved from the
Charlotten Strasse to the Alleen Strasse, a
better, cleaner, and more aristocratic part of
the city. The Charlotten Strasse house had
been taken by a firm of pianoforte makers
that have since become famous, und
Bladel, and they took possession of the back
wing while we were still there. Some huge
logs of mahogany arrived all ready cut in thin
layers for veneers, about an eighth of an inch
thick, but still hanging together at the butt
end. Then some carpenters arrived, and made
all kinds of tools out of beech timber, planes
of all kinds, chisel handles, malets, etc.
While we were at Liebenzell one or both of our
aunts and uncle Charles Middleton were
staying with us, and our first English


tutor arrived and our troubles began. We
were busy bathing a drove of pigs in the Nagold
when the tutor turned up. I did not get on
with tutors, and Lamb, one of three we had,
made my life a perfect misery to me. He had
been an usher in an English School, a narrow-
chested, weak mortal, that looked upon all
boys as his natural enemies and he treated me
shamefully. When he ultimately left us
Newton composed the following touching
verses thereon.
Wenn das Lammlein geht
Wenn Sein Hlithlein weht
Zu dem Abshied’s gruss
Dann hopf ich auf einem fuss.
In our new house in the Alleen Strasse we
occupied the two first storey flats, communicat-
ing with one another of two four-storey houses,
and we had room enough, but none to spare.
We spent many happy days there and some
sad ones too. I don’t think it was a desirable
residence for us, there were too many different
people living in those two houses, and many
of the arrangements would not come up to our
present ideas. There was an Englishman,
a Captain Speed, with a large family, lived on
a flat above us, and Professor Brutzer, with


a beautiful Irish wife, their children, and her
sister, a Miss Thomas, on another. Father had
a carpenter’s shop with a turning lathe at the
top of the house, and we learnt to turn tops
and malets of beech and sycamore Some of
us had fowls and rabbits in a fenced-in corner
of the yard, and at one time there was a she-
ass that supplied milk for the baby, and there
was always our good old setter dog, Bello,
who was a great joy to us all. We did an
immense amount of lessons, French and German,
Latin, geography, history and mathematics,
and music, and masters and mistresses came
for most of these, including dancing and singing.
On holidays we made excursions to the country
in an omnibus with four horses, to some of the
Royal country seats and hunting lodges, and
picnicking under the tiees at the Barenschloss-
chen, Solitude, and Mon Repos, to which places
we obtained cards of admission. Such of us
boys as were old enough were drilled by soldiers
of the Wurtemberg army, with the town boys
carrying wooden guns. We were great at
collecting butterflies. There was a beautiful
secluded valley behind the Vogelsee where I
caught several Trauer-mantel butterflies, a
large black one with a broad white border.


That Vogelsee was one of the heads of the
water supply of tne town. There was a big
dam and an iron door, underneath which we
could hear the water rushing away towards
the town through underground pipes. In winter
we used to skate, and father brought us all to
the Vogelsee one day, where we clea r ed the
snow away off part of the ice and had just
begun to enjoy ourselves when we weie warned
off by the police, Augusta was born at
Stuttgardt in January, 1846. The following
summer I think we all went to Rippoldsau, a
beautiful wild place right in the heart of the
Black Foiest among mountains, the highest
being the Knibis. There were wild cherry
trees growing on the sides of all the roads
covered with fruit, and scores of my old friends
the Trauer mantel butterflies settling on the
trunks sucking at the gum that exuded.
There were cock of the woods and father and
Newton went after them. There was a sawmill
and a large sheet of water above it. They
made a wonderful boat for us. Mrs. Eckford
and her two daughters Flora and Bessie came
from Stuttgardt, and stayed at the hotel for
the sake of our company in this wild place,
and Flora was out in that boat with me, and
c


the boat leaked and got full of water, and
Flora got wet, and it was a lark. We got
quantities of wild strawberries and raspberries,
and were sorry to leave Rippoldsau and back
to the hot and dirty town. There were a
number of English families living at Stuttgardt,
the Stiffs from Jersey, with a daughter and
two sons; Major and Mrs. Dawson, with a
daughter that whistled beautifully, and a son ;
then there were the Barber’s, father and mother,
a son, and three daughters ; Cusac Smith, an
officer in the Wurtemberg army, and hopelessly
in love with the youngest Miss Barber, a fine
gentlemanly fellow, and everyone liked him ;
then there was the English Ambassador, Sii
Alexander Malet, who lived in a grand house
close to us —we weie all at a juvenile ball at
his house ; also Lord Augustus Loftus, the
attachee, who afterwards became Governor
of New South Wales. When Emily was seven-
teen father and mother went to Court, and
Emily was presented to the King and Queen,
and went to several balls there. We had a
good large drawing room in one of the wings
of the house adjoining our dining room, and
in these rooms we entertained a great many
people with musical evenings, dances, and


private theatricals, at which Charles and Emily
were great. Many of the German counts and
other sprigs of nobility were our guests, among
which I xecall the names of Count Zepellin,
Count Piickler, and Count Dillen. About this
time the Humes arrived, the Revd. W. W.
Hume, Rector of Scaldwell in Northampton-
shire, Mrs. Hume, and six or seven daughters
and three sons. We discovered them one day
at the entrance to the palace grounds. Mrs.
Hume had with her a child’s carriage or
perambulator, and the police would not allow
her to pass. Neither she nor any of her
daughters could understand German, so we had
to interpret, and after that we soon got to
know them. It was a great treat to us to
associate with such nice beautiful English girls.
I remember we had a theatrical evening in
which Heathen gods and goddesses weie re-
presented, and three of the Humes represented
Juno, Diana and Venus. This was followed
soon after by a musical comic play in verse,,
composed by Charles, entitled, " Aladdin, or
the Wonderful Lamp Modernized.” There was
a song by Aladdin, a parody on the old German
song, ‘ Der Mantel.”


My ventilated tile farwell,
Farwell my ventilated tile,
Thou hast been as root to my noddle,
And never at home did'st thou toddle,
My ventilated tile, &c., &c. '
There was also a banqueting song to the
tune of the fine old English Gentleman ;
What lots of smoking dishes,
Fish, fowl, meat, game, and tarts,
And spinach rare,
Sheep heads and bullocks’ hearts.
His mother, it appears, was overcome by
the good things of the table, and so he goes on ;
She won’t get up, so I’ll fall too,
I’m dazzled by the view ;
And what shall I begin with first —
I think some Irish stew.
Then gammon, sweet cow’s heel and oyster
patties too,
And finish up with a wing of hare,
Which I’m half afraid said miew,
Like a fine young Turkish Gentleman,
All of the modern time.
The play finished up with “ Down, Down,
Deny Down ” to the tune of “ God Save the
Queen.” The following winter Mrs. Hume


died of typhoid fever. Our brother William
Henry was born in January, 1848, and Mi.
Hume was his godfather, and in March following
our dear little sister Delitia died. She could
only have been seven years of age, but I
remember how tall she was and how greatly I
felt her loss. She was buried in the same
enclosure where lay the remains of Mrs. Hume,
in the General Cemetery outside the town
near the Gas Works. We went to Wildbad that
summer, and from there to Baden Baden.
Mr. Bowden was our tutor at that time, a good
fellow. We lived in an ornamental Swiss
Chalet for some weeks, a short distance, one
or two miles from Baden Baden, and little
William Henry was taken ill and mother
moved into the town, where the poor little
fellow died, and was buried in the cemetery
there. There were a number of English people
there, the Castle of Baden on the hill, the hot
springs, numbers of large hotels, and the gaming
tables in full swing. It was here I taught
myself to swim, in a bathing house in the Enz,
a little stream that runs into the plains of Baden,
and joins the Rhine at a place called Oos,
where the garage for the great Zepplin airship
has lately been put up. It was at Baden that


I first heard of the Freishaaren, the revolution-
ary bands that marched about the country at
their sweet will. This was the year of i evolu-
tions all over the world, when the Chartists
kicked up a dust in England, and the French
hunted Louis Phillip and his family from France,
and he landed at Folkstone or Newhaven, I
forget which, in a fishing boat. I remember
the picture in the “ Illustrated London News,”
showing the landing. They killed the Aich-
bishop of Paris on the barricades, and there
was fighting in every State in Europe I
remember the cannon facing the principal street
in Stuttgardt, and troops of cavalry stationed
at different points about the city. That year
many liberties were granted to the people,
the last remains of feudalism disappeared, and
the royal forests all over the country were
thrown open to the public, and the game des-
troyed, which was a pity. However, much
that was given up to the people in 1848 has
been taken away again, and while the attention
of the people has been taken up with fighting
with Italy, Austria, Schleswig-Holstein, and
lastly with France, a military despotism more
or less pionounced, has supervened.
About the end of 1848 I think it was that
our brother Newton left us to go to India,


on a direct appointment in the East India
Company’s service, and after passing a mild
examination, chiefly medical, he set sail for
Calcutta in the East Indiaman Seringapatam
round the Cape, and joined the 52nd Bengal
Native Infantry, with which he remained until
they mutinied in the great mutiny of 1857,
and his regiment were the last to join. Dear
old Newton was the strongest of all of us boys.
He seemed to have an iron constitution. He
fought for England through the mutiny and
for many years after, and ultimately retired
to Onslow Square, Kensington, where he died
on the 20th of July of last year, 1910, a Major-
General in the British Army. An incident
worth recording took place in 1848, probably
about the last week in January. Charles was
home from Oxford for the vacation, and Newton
had not yet started for India, a meeting together
of the whole of our family in our dear mother’s
bedroom, soon after the birth of little William,
consisting of father and mother, and all of us
twelve children.
The discovery of gold in California, and
subsequently in Australia, gave an immense
impulse to commerce all over the world, and
more especially to Australia, which became


the Tom Tiddlers ground for the enterprising
members of the nations of the world. The
march of events during the years 1849 to 1850
are to me rather clouded. We continued to
live in the double flat of the houses in the
Alleen Strasse in Stuttgardt. Charles was at
Christ Church, Oxford, and came to us for his
vacations ; he brought a chum with him, David
Barnard, a right good fellow. There was an
outbreak of measles which went through the
family. Mother gave me on my recovery a
ring and a letter which I still have.
Montagu was preparing for his examination
for the English Army, and went to Lausanne to
study French, and Nathaniel got an appoint-
ment as midshipman in the English Navy,
and joined his ship the “ Superb ” at Malta,
under Admiral Dundas. I had a severe attack
of scarlatina, and the Revd. Mr. Hume and a
Mr. Ogle visited me in bed. Mr. Ogle was the
promoter of a copper mine in the valley of the
Kinzig, one of the rivers in the Black Forest.
The mine, however, was a failure. Our Aunt
Augusta, our mother’s next younger sister came
to visit us, and Mr. Hume fell in love with her,
and subsequently married her ; and on the 17th
September, 1850, we lost our beloved mother


who, on that day died under confinement of
a stillborn babe, and was buried beside our
sister Lilly and Mrs. Hume in the cemetery at
Stuttgardt.
Soon after the death of our mother, prepara-
tions were made for our departure from
Stuttgardt, where we had lived eight years,
and in October or November of 1850 we started
for England, where we were received with the
greatest hospitality, kindness and affection by
our uncle, Hastings Nathaniel Middleton and
aunt Mary Ann, our father’s sister, and their
family consisting of two sons and four daughters,
who were at that time, and for some yeais
after, living at Wollaston House, in the town
of Dorchester, which at that time was a very
desirable residence with good stables, kitchen,
and flower gardens, a large field with some
beautiful elm trees, and suited my uncle and
his family admirably, while alterations and a
new house were undertaken and carried out
at Bradford. Our father had been laid up
during our journey through Belgium by a
dangerous attack of pleurisy, and our sister
Emily stayed with him at Brussels, and they
rejoined us about a fortnight after at Dorchester.
1851 was the year of the Great Exhibition of


All Nations in Hyde Park, which was to bring
Peace on Earth and Goodwill towards Men, to
he followed in three or four years by the war
with Russia, and the horrors of the Crimea.
The Kohinoor diamond and Australian gold
were exhibited, and the cabmen struck work,
and the unfortunate visitors had to find their
way to their lodgings on foot, and many lost
their way, and the little boys ran up to them
and enquired, How are your poor feet ? Fiom
this point forward I can only follow the fortunes
of the Barton family in an abbreviated form,
and after giving a short account of what has
come to each member thereof, I shall bring
my history to an end. The Barton family
continued to live at Dorchester for about five
years, and with the greatest possible amount
of happiness to which our aunt Minna, who
came and settled in the High Stieet, contributed
in a veiy great degree, by giving us evening
parties and dances, and on one occasion she
accompanied us to Swanage during our summer
vacation, and acted like a mother to us all.
She used to give us our luncheon beer in a yellow
jug with hunting scenes depicted thereon, and
a greyhound for a handle, and this jug is before
me now and greatly prized. I continued to


live with the Middletons till I went to Taylor’s
School, on Woolwich Common, and after that
to the Agricultural College of Cirencester,
where at that time were also as students the
Honourable B. B. Moreton, now of Brisbane,
and George Mant, of Gigoomgan, in the district
of Wide Bay. I continued to receive the
greatest kindness and affection from my uncle
and aunt Middleton and all their family, who
treated me at all times as one of themselves,
until in 185« T I came out to Melbourne in
Money Wigram’s ship Kent, Captain Coleman.
Thence to our cousins the Jeffrey’s stations,
Birnewang on the Campaspe, and Boomenoo-
mena on the Murray River, then overland to
our brother Charles at Tanunda in South
Australia, and finally to Queensland in January,
1857, just about the time of separation from
New South Wales, to take up my quarters
with an old Cirencester friend, George Mant
of Gigoomgan in the district of Wide Bay. From
Melbourne I came with Captain Cottier in the
old London to Sydney at the time when the
Frazer massacre by the blacks on the Dawson
was the topic of conversation, and from Sydney
I came to Maryborough in the Waratah with
Captain Knight. The Waratah was a new


steamer belonging to the Australian Steam
Navigation Company, ran for many years on
the Australian coast, and, I think, was
ultimately lost in the South Sea Islands. Both
Captain Cottier and Captain Knight were great
favourites with the travelling public, and were
kind to me. I ultimately settled at Mool-
boolaman in 1860, which has been my home
ever since. Shortly before my leaving England
our Grandmother Barton died 30th May, 1855,
aged 92 years, and was buried at Bradford
Peverel. About the end of 1855 the Barton
family moved from Dorchester to Sway House,
near Brokenhurst, and afterwards to Rope
Hill, in the village of Boldre in Hampshire,
close to Lymington, where they lived many
years, probably about fourteen, and then they
came to Upton Lodge adjoining Rownhams,
the ancient home of the Barton’s, where they
continued until after the death of our father,
which took place on the 3rd October, 1894,
in his 93rd year. He lies in the churchyard
at Rownhams in the spot selected by himself.
Charles Hastings Barton, his eldest son,
was born at Vevey on the Lake of Geneva,
on the 11th December, 1828. He was educated

him with unspeakable devotion and love for
the last fifteen years of his life, and after seeing
him to his last resting place in Rownhams
Churchyard, she retired to a cottage near by,

“ Whitehall,
“Saturday, 21st May, 1 748.
“ Dear Sir,
“ To desire you to go with me to Goodwood,
and then to turn you out of my coach seems
to be rather a rude way of proceeding, but the
case is this ; I have room for six in my landau
and chaise, and the six are ;
“ Duke of Montagu ;
‘ Mr. Nicolini ;
“Sir Thos. Robinson ;
“ Mr. Ellis, who now is determined to go ;
“ Yourself ;
“ Myself ;
and now James Bundenell wa.nts of adl things
to be of the party, but never was master of
a horse in his life, so it comes to this, that
the Duke of Montagu must take his landau,
or you must ride, or Bundenell go on fcot,
or not at-all. Here, as McSweeney would say,
several alternatives of which I know your
complaisance will immediately decide, that of
riding yourself, but that hurts me, and yet I


don’t well see how it can be otherwise, unless
the Duke of Montagu takes a wheelbarrow
or something. But pray don’t let difficulties
discourage you, for rather than you should
not come, I will be of the wheelbarrow
party myself.”
“ Yours very sincerely,
“ Richmond.”

“ London House,
“ 10th January, 1799.
‘ It is indeed with great pleasure my dear
Miss Harriett, that I heard of the union likely
to take place between two persons whom I
so highly esteem, and whom I think in a very-
high degree qualified to make each other happy.
‘ In my letter to Mr. Barton I spoke my
real sentiments of you. and I am equally
sincere when I say (and it is saying a great
deal) that I think him a man in every way
worthy of vou. I see no reason why you should
not look forward to this alliance with courage


and resolution as well as with satisfaction and
comfort, and I hope for your own sake as well
as his, that you will not delay your mutual
felicity longer than is necessary. Whenever
you call upon me I shall be ready to obey your
commands in the meanwhile with compliments
to your family.
“ I remain,
“ Very sincerely yours,
“ B. London.”
Mrs. P. sends here best compliments and
kindest wishes.
