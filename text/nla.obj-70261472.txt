GUESE DISCOVERIES DURING THE FIRST
TWENTY YEARS OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY
ON THE THEORY OF AN ANTIPODAL SOUTHERN
CONTINENT.
JAMES R. M'CLYMONT, M.A,
The possibility of an antipodal continent follows from the
sphericity of the earth, which has been generally admitted
by geographers since the time of Aristotle. The older theory
of the Hellenic Greeks regarded the earth as a disc sur-
rounded by Ocean and floating in the midst of the heavens.
All the seas had outlets into the ocean. In the east the
river Phasis united the Euxine with the ocean, in the west
the strait of the Columns of Hercules similarly connected
the Mediterranean with it. The diameter of the earth was
of twenty days? journey. The true successors of this
Homeric school were the monastic illuminators of the middle
ages. Their Imagines Mundi represent the earth as a
wheel, the tire of which is the Homeric Ocean. It has three
spokes, one of which is placed perpendicularly to the other
two ; the horizontal spokes represent the waters which
were supposed to divide Europe and Africa from Asia,
namely, the Tanais or' River Don, the Black Sea, the
Hellespont, the easternmost portion of the Mediterranean,
and the Nile; the perpendicular spoke represents the
remaining portion of the Mediterranean dividing Europe
from Africa. The east, as the realm of Paradise, is placed
at the summit of the wheel; Jerusalem is the nave, for
? operatus es salutem in medio terrae ? (Ps. 74, 12). The
antipodal continent finds no place in the typical Imago
Mundi, or, if alluded to at all, it is only to dismiss it
as a fable : ? Extra tres autem partes orbis pars trans
oceanum ulterior est qui solis ardore incognita nobis est cuius
finibus antipodes fabuloso inhabitare produntur.? ( Orbis e
codice taurinensi. Mappemonde dans un MS. qui contient un
commentaire de I?Apocalypse.) Atlas de Santarem.
The first terrestrial globe, so far as we know, was con-
structed about 160 B.C. by Crates of Mallus. Crates


Jawah our modern Java, Polo describes one of the king-
doms of Javva la meneur under the name ? Samara,? but
the name Sumatra as applied to the entire island does not
appear on any European map with which I am acquainted
until the year 1459, when Fra Mauro so denominates it
on his Mappa Mundi, Fra Manro?s two Giavas, Giava
maggiore and Giava menore, lie to the east of Asia, and the
former seems to be identical with Cimpangu, or Japan.
In Polo?s and in Varthema?s times Java was regarded as
an island of much greater extent than it really is. Marco
Polo was informed that it was the largest island in the
world, and gives its circumference as five thousand miles
{Le Livre de Metre Pol, ed. Panthier, cap. clxii.), and that
of Javva la meneur as two thousand. The companions of
Varthema wished him to go and see ?the largest island in
the world, ? and having called at Bornei they took their way
to the island called Giava. (Varthema, ed. Hakl. Soc., pp.
247-8.) In later times Java Minor was regarded as an
island distinct both from Java and Sumatra. Thus Pigafetta
(1522) says that half a league from Java Major is the
island of Bali, called also Java Minor. Another writer,
Manoel Godinho de Heredia, who cites Polo, Varthema,
Battista Agnese (1550?) and Petrus Plaucius (1598), places
Java Minor in a new position altogether. Having described
Sumatra, and Java under the name of Java Maior, and pre-
viously to describing Borneo, he mentions a Java Menor,
and under that name describes the Javva la meneur of Polo.
But his Java Menor is not in the position of Polo?s Javva la
meneur, but is in the Mar Austral in 24� S. lat. Its people
possess many spices never seen in Europe, and are so
ferocious that the inhabitants of the neighbouring islands
hold no intercourse with them. ve.rdadeira da
aurea Chersoneso, Lisboa, 1807, p. 116.) The 163 rd chapter
of the Book of Marco Polo commences with the words
?Quant on se part de Javva et on nage vii. c. milles contre
midi treuve 1 en deux isles, I?une grant, et I?autre
meneur. L une a nom Sandur et I?autre Condur.? Com-
mentators until recently were unable to identify these islands,
as well as the countries of Locach and Maliur and the island
of Pontain and other places, the position of which depended
on the direction to be taken from Java to Sandur and
Condur. At last Marsden solved the difficulty by pointing
out that if ? Cyamba ? were read in place of ?Javva? and
the southerly course for 700 miles were followed from


Cyamba, Condur or Pulo Condor would fall into its right
position, Sandur would correspond with the Two Brothers,
Locach with Lo-Kok, an ancient name for the lower part of
the modern Siam, Pontain with Bintang, and Maliur with
the Land of the Malays?the Malay Peninsula. But this
emendation had not been thought of in the time of Mercator,
who, in his desire to record all known discoveries, placed
Sandur and Condur, Locach and Maliur where the MSS. of
Marco Polo?s travels indicated them, namely, to the south of
Java, on or near a northern extension of the Terra Australis.
Java Major on Mercator s map of the world of 1569 cor-
rectly represents the modern Java; Java Minor is an
imaginary island situated in a gulf of the Terra Australis.
The next influence on the development of the conception
of a Terra Australis was that exercised by the oceanic dis-
coveries of the Spanish and Portuguese in South America
in the end of the fifteenth and beginning of the sixteenth
centuries. The necessity of discovering ocean routes to the
east was the outcome'of the aggressive attitude of the
Turks and of the internecine rivalry of the maritime re-
publics of Italy. As early as 1285 Genoa had sent out an
expedition under the leadership of Tedisio Doria and
Ugolino di Yivaldo for the purpose of discovering a path to
the Indies by way of the south of Africa. The expedition
never returned.
For nearly two centuries the more enterprising amongst
the European nations of that period, by means of treaties
with the Turks or of alliances with the Mongols, attempted
to retain an interest in oriental trade. By former means
the Genoese retained their depots in the Crimea for mer-
chandise coming from the east by the overland route through
Turkestan, and the French and Venetians came to an
understanding with the Sultan of Egypt regarding the navi-
gation of the Red Sea. Syria, under the power of the
Crusaders, had become another mart for the oriental produc-
tions which came by the way of the Euphrates Valley, and
the Venetians occupied a quarter in Ptolemais, and the
Pisans one in Antioch, whilst the Genoese had counting-
houses in Jerusalem, Joppa, and C&sarea.
The inability of the European nations to support the
Crusaders in their conquest necessitated the withdrawal of
those merchants from Syria. The Genoese were compelled
to retire in 1474 from the Crimea, whilst the Venetians so
jealously conserved their rights in the route by the Red Sea


that other maritime nations had either to fall back upon the
Genoese attempt of 1285, or strike out some entirely new
enterprise in order to reach the east. The Portuguese did
the former, and reached the east by the Cape of Good Hope
in 149/, after a long series of fruitless efforts. The
fepaniards did the latter, and in the attempt chanced to fall
in with America on the way. The vast extension which
Marco Polo s travels had given to Asia towards the east
helped to implant in the mind of Columbus the idea of
reaching it by sailing to the west, and the new world of
Columbus was never more to him than the easternmost por-
tion of the old. The subsequent discoveries of the Spaniards
and Portuguese altered many of the Ptolemaean ideas about
the configuration of the southern hemisphere. It was now
seen that there was no eastward extension of the African
continent; the Indian Ocean was not a mare clausum ; Asia
did not unite with an extended Africa ; Ceylon was not of
equal extent with the Indian Peninsula; Taprobana was
removed from Ceylon to Sumatra; Catigara from the
imaginary Southern Asia to Cape Comorin, and thence to
unexplored Southerti America.
Columbus and Bartholomew Diaz were the precursors of
a host of Spanish and Portuguese discoverers. These nations
were strong enough to keep the other maritime powers in
check, and France in the early part of the sixteenth century
had to content herself with stealthy expeditions undertaken
by private individuals or syndicates, whilst England shortly
began to play the part of the bold buccaneer. All charts
and sailing directions were carefully conserved, and only
general descriptive narratives were allowed to circulate out-
side of Spain or Portugal. ? Manuel, King of Portugal,?
saysi Lelewel, ?in his letter of 29th July, 1501, informed
rerdmand of the discovery of Brazil by Cabral, but he
secreted all the nautical charts; they were deposited in the
record office of the Admiralty, and could not be removed
from the kingdom. AH publicity was given to the glory
and renown of the state and its navigators. Narratives of
the voyages were scattered abroad in brochures and fly-
leaves. People found in these the adventures of the
travellers and everything that could astonish their minds, but
they could find nothing there that would enable them to
determine geographical positions with certainty. Charts
were drawn which gave a picture of the discoveries, but they
were destitute of every indication which could instruct


mariners regarding the dangers or the direction of the
voyages.? ( Geographic du Moyen Age, ii., pp. 141-142.)
The same remarks hold good of the policy of Spain, and
only a few original records of her discoveries give details
which could assist the curious to folioiv in the tracks of the
discoverers.
Of such the best known instance is the account of the
voyages of Vespucci. Two of these performed in the service
of Spain and two in the service of Portugal were narrated
by that voyager in a letter written, as appears from internal
evidence, to Pier Soderini, the Gonfaloniere of Florence, and
printed without a date, but probably in Florence in 1505.
This epistle received widespread attention through being-
translated into Latin as an appendix to the popular Cosmo-
graphies Introductio, St. Die, 1507, Humboldt and Yarn-
hagen have done much to elucidate these voyages of
Vespucci, and to restore the honour justly due to his name,
but even they have been misled by their anxiety to identify
too closely the landfalls and terminal points of his voyages,
and have in several cases altered his plain statements of the
latitudes observed. It is not to be wondered at, then, that
the Spanish alguazil and author Enciso, writing in 1519
about a voyage performed in the service of Portugal, should
have misunderstood its scope. Enciso is not reliable in
matters beyond his personal cognisance, as Varnhagen has
pointed out. {Vespuce et son premier Voyage, Paris, 1858,
p. 25.) The former speaks thus vaguely of a discovery of
land in 42� S. : ? This Cape of Good Hope has to the west
the land called austral; from the Cape of Good Hope to the
? tierra austral ? the distance is 450 leagues ; it is in 42�; it
is 600 leagues from Cape St. Augustine ; it is S.E. � S.
from Cape St. Augustine. Nothing is known of this land
except what has been seen from ships, for no one has landed
on it.? ( Suma de Geographiu, Seville, 1519, fol. liv., verso.)
Mercator, quoting this passage of Enciso, places a Promon-
torium Terrce Australis on his Magna Orhis Descriptio,
1569, in 42� S. and about 15� of Boavista, and this cape
cape came to be regarded by some geographers as an un-
assailably correct position. Jean Paulmier thus spe.ik* of it
in his Memoires touchant I?Estahlissement d?une Mission
chrestienne, p, 9. I think there can be little doubt that
Enciso had heard but an imperfect account of Vespucci?s
third voyage performed in the service of Portugal, and that
he misplaced the land seen from the ships on the 7th pf


April, 1502, and generally identified with the island of South
Georgia. ( Lettera , p. 28.) The mistake might have arisen
through misunderstanding Vespucci?s statement that he
coasted 600 leagues from Cape St. Augustine, and in sup-
posing that that distance was to be taken in a direct line ;
which, adding 600 leagues to B'?the latitude of C. St,
Augustine?would have brought the ships to about 42� S.
Further, Enciso or his informant seems to have supposed
that at this point was the land which was sighted from the
ships. Desbrosses somewhat more accurately says : ? The
Austral coast discovered by Amerigo Vespucci is to be found
marked on the maps nearly at the intersection of the 52nd
parallel with the first meridian.? (Histoire, i,, p. 100.) The
map of Vaugondy, however, published in the work of
Desbrosses, adheres to the older indication of Enciso, and
places the Cap des Ter res Australes in 42� S. The error
of Enciso is of interest as the earliest transference of an
actual discovery from its proper position to the coast of the
legendary Terra Australis.
The next instance of a similar kind occurs in the Novus
Orbis, published in Basle in the year 1532. That work
contains a Latin translation of a letter from Lorenzo Cretico,
Ambassador of the Venetian Republic at the Court of
Portugal, beginning with the words ? Serenissime Princeps,?
and addressed probably to the Doge. It is dated June 27,
1501, but seems not to have been published until 1507, when
it appears in the Paesi novamertte retrouati. The letter gives
an account of the expedition of Cabral to Calicut, in which
Brazil was discovered on the 22nd of April 1500, and a
passage in it is to the effect that the ships discovered a new r
country on their way, and lying to the south-west, before reach-
ing the Cape of Good Hope,?? di sopra dal capo d Boh-
sperhza uerso garbi hano scopto una terra noua la chiamao d
li Papaga.? Further, that they called it the Land of
Parrots, because these birds there exceeded a cubit and a
half in length, and were of various colours; that the writer
had seen two of them ; the sailors believed that this coast
was that of a continent, because they sailed along it for two
thousand miles without reaching the end of it; it was
inhabited by naked and well-made men. The translator of
this letter for the Novus Orbis has rendered ?uerso garbi?
by ?lebegio vecti vento,? making it to appear that Cabral
was driven on this new coast by a south-west wind; and
Oronce Fine, whose map of the world of 1531 accompanies


the Basle edition of the Novus Orhis, 1532, places a Brasielie
Regio as part of the Terra Australis , reaching nearly to the
tropic of Capricorn, whilst more to the east is a Regio
Patalis, a word supposed by Santarern to be derived from the
Sanskrit, and to mean the nether region. The occurrence
of the inscription ? Mare magellanicum ? on Fine?s map
shows that he was in part influenced by the voyage of
Magellan in his delineation of the Terra Australis. Mercator
followed the incorrect indication given in the Novus Orhis ,
and charted the Psittacorum Regio in about 42 3 S., and
with a longitudinal extension from 30� to 70� E. of Bona-
vista. This tract bears the inscription ? Psittacorum Regio
sic a Lusitanis hue libegio vento appulsis cum Callicutum
peterent appellata propter earum avium multitudinem. Porro
cum hujus terrse littus ad 2000 miliarum prosequuti essent
necdum tamen finem invenorunt inde Australem continentem
attigisse indubitatum est.?
It was probably due in the main to the personal character
and ambition of Charles VIII. and Louis XII. that France
expended her energies so exclusively in feudal wars at the
period of the great oceanic discoveries. With the accession
of Francis I. and the regency of Louisa of Savoy com-
mences an awakening of interest in these discoveries, which
eventually resulted in active participation. In 1516 the
Paesi nouamente retrouati appeared in a French translation.
In 1523 or 1524 Pigafetta presented to the Regent a copy
of his book, that namely which described the voyage of
Magellan, and a French abridgment of the work by Jacques
Fabre appeared shortly afterwards at the Regent?s request.
In 1532 Peter Martyr?s first three decades were abridged
and published in French, with a dedication to Charles Due
d?Angouleme, a son of Francis I.; and abridgments of the
fourth decade and of the second and third letter of Cortes
were dedicated to another child of Francis 1., the Princess
Marguerite (the Colines Receuil.) At this time there existed
schools of hydrography at Dieppe and Arques, which were
patronised by the royal family. A member of the latter,
Pierre Desceliers, executed a map of the world in 1546 at
the order of Henry 11., which is reproduced in the Atlas
of Jomard, No. XXI. The same hydrographer produced
another mappemonde, bearing the arms of France and
Dauphiny, and supposed to be of earlier date than the last-
named. It is preserved in the British Museum, and cata-
logued Add. MS. 5413. This chart is sometimes called the


Dauphin Map, at other times, from its having belonged to
Edward Harley, Earl of Oxford, the Harleyan Map, and as
the map of 1546 is also known as the Dauphin Map, the
other designation is probably the better of the two.
Desceliers and his fellow-hydrographers appear to have
had access to some of the pictorial charts of the Spaniards
or Portuguese to which Lelewel alludes. An extensive
portion of their southern hemisphere is occupied by hydro-
graphic outlines of a continent which in some instances is
represented as united with the Terra Australis , in others is
made separate from it, and to which the name Jave la
Grande or Java Maior is applied. Its northern outlines are
in part co-terminous with those of Java, in part with those of
other islands of the Malayan Archipelago. This appears
from the names with which that portion of the coast is
studded. But on closer examination one finds that the
entire outlines of Java, of certain Malaysian islands, and of
Java Major, correspond with the outlines of Central and
South America from the Gulf of Honduras to about 23� S.
or, in some of the maps (Desceliers, 1550, Desliens, 1566)
to the vicinity of La Plata. In order to rectify the
bearing of the coast-lines it is necessary to invert them,
which can be simply done by placing the chart before a
mirror. The inverted outlines should be compared with an
early map of America, such as that of Juan de la Cosa.
There are indeed some striking points of resemblance
between these charts and the map of De la Cosa. De la
Cosa represents two large islands and some small ones
off Cape bt. Augustine ; the French charts have one
large island and some small ones in the same position.
These islands may represent the discovery of Cabral, who at
first regarded Monte Pascoal as part of an island. {Geo.
du Moyen Age, ii,,p. 110.) Another point of resemblance
is in the delineation of the mouths of the Tocantins and
Amazon and the island Marajo. In both cases that island is
represented as a peninsula between two gulfs, and the two
coast-lines at this point are strikingly similar. Again, in De
la Cosa?s map the river which disembogues a little to the
south of Cape bt. Roque is produced so as almost to cut off
the north-eastern corner of Brazil ; in the French maps it
cuts it off completely.
I will now point out some details which I think will be
held sufficient to establish the identity between Jave la
Grande and the American coasts I have mentioned. The


bay marked ? Baye Perdue? has to the N.W. of it a small
island marked ?Ye de S. Xtofer,? or Island of St. Chris-
topher (commonly known as St. Kitts), and the bay itself
corresponds with the description given by Vespucci of ? a
very fine port, which was formed by a large island that was
situated at the mouth, inside of which there was a bay, very
deeply indented ? ( Lettera, p. 18; in this bay he anchored in
his second voyage, in the summer of 1499. The description
applies either to the Gulf of Paria or to the mouth of the
Orinoco ; and that Baye Perdue is intended for one of these
places is evident from its position relatively to St, Kitts. If
? Perdue ? is a translation of the Spanish ? Perdita,? the
name may have been given it after the loss of two of the
ships of Vincente Pinzon in that neighbourhood in the year
1500. The islands off the coast to the west of Baye Perdue
represent very fairly the Leeward Islands, and one might
without difficulty pick out Margarita, Tortuga, and Curagoa;
whilst some of the headlands are probably represented as
islands. The Gulf of Venezuela is not drawn as such, but,
at the place where we should expect to find it, are several
islands representing the peninsulas of Paraguana and La
Guajira. We may conclude that the pilot who drew the
original chart (like the pilot who drew the original charts
from which the Hydrographia of 1513 was constructed)
sailed past the entrance of this gulf without detecting it.
Another West Indian island serves as an index to this part
of the coast, under the name ?Ye de Lucayos.? This name
appears on De la Cosa's map in the singular, ? Lucayo,?
apparently as the equivalent of Guanahani, and it is else-
where used in the plural of the Bahamas generally. The
coast then trends S.W. into the Gulf of Darien ; and on
this part appears on the chart of Desliens the word
? forillons,? an adaptation of the Spanish ? farallones,? or
reefs above water. The ? Farallones ?of the Gulf of Darien
are referred to by Galvano (Hakluyt Soc. Ed., p. 99), who
speaks of them as being sighted by Rodrigo Bastidas in his
voyage of the year 1503, but mentions them as if well known
prior to that time.
At the extremity of the Gulf of Darien the coast-line
of the MS. charts ceases to correspond with the actual coast.
The explanation, I think, is to be found in supposing that
the navigator who drew the chart left the coast at this point,
crossed the mouth of the Mosquito Gulf, and resumed his
hydrographical labours where he again sighted the coast ?


that of Nicaragua,?some distance to the south of C.
Gracias a Dios. At this point another of the West Indian
Islands assists our identification. N.N.E. from the promon-
tory which we have supposed to be C. Gracias a Dios?
? C. da fremosa? on the Harleyan Map?lies the island of
Jamaica, ? Ysla** ar Its true position would
be N.E., but it is accurately enough placed relatively to
? C. da fremosa ? to indicate that the cape is C. Gracias a Dios
and not P. Manzanilla nor C. Catoche, the only other capes
with which one might attempt to identify it. As for the
spelling of Jamaica, that varies much in old maps and
treatises. The Hydrographia has ? Jamaiqua,? Galvano
writes it ? Zamayca,? From this point the orientation is
entirely false, for the coast, instead of being produced nearly
due west, slopes off to the S.W. and produces the impression
of a coast-line accurately enough depicted as to hydro-
graphical features, but so depicted by a mariner without a
compass.
Let us now return to the point whence we started, and
proceed southwards. South of the N.E. corner of the map
is a river with the much-abbreviated legend, ? R. de St.
Po; ? perhaps San Pedro, for in the Mappemonde peinte par
ordre de Henri //., it is translated St. Pierre ; its position
accords with that of the Rio San Francisco. Then we have
an unnamed bay, and the outlet of a river marked ?R.
Grande,? answering to Bahia dos Todos Santos and the R.
Paraguay or ? great water,? of which Rio Grande might be
a translation. Desceliers delineates a channel from this bay
to the mouth of the Tocantins, and thus converts the N.E.
corner of South America into an island. No such separa-
tion, however, occurs on the Mappemonde of Desliens,
which is otherwise similar to the Harleyan Map ; perhaps
Desceliers has taken a liberty with his original, in order
to reconcile his idea of the identity of the north-western
portion of the chart with the island of Java, a circumstance
to which I shall again refer. The next bay, marked ? Baye
bresill,? is probably the ? porto seguro ? of Cabral. The
name Brazil, which is stated to have been bestowed by
French sailors, was very soon adopted by the Portuguese,
for we find a ? Rio Brazil ? in the Hydrographia in a posi-
tion coinciding with this ? Baye bresill.? The undue
extension given to the harbours of this coast is a noticeable
feature ; and although one might reasonably expect that the
ports in which ships anchored would be shown more in detail


than places which were merely sailed past, I think this
consideration alone is hardly .sufficient to account for the
exaggeration, but that this southern portion is the work of a
less skilled draughtsman than the northern?of one who had
not sufficient knowledge of cartography to reduce his plans
of the harbours to their proper relative proportions on a chart
of the entire coast.
The indications for the guidance of mariners which occur
at various points of the coast sufficiently attest the hydro-
graphic character of the original charts ; and the illustrations
are an evident addition of the copyist, and are as charac-
teristic of the systematic mediaeval map of the world as the
nautical information is characteristic of the pilot?s chart.
Amongst these nautical indications are ? terre unnegeade,?
submerged land (Desceliers, 1546) ; ?ap quieta,? perhaps, a
a calm place ( Idem ); ?Roches,? rocks, (1546, 1550);
? Arenes,? sands, (1550); ? Ansses,? cores, (1546). One can
only guess at the meaning of some of the inscriptions to the
south of ? Baye bresill.? ?B. de gao ? may be a corruption
of ? agoada,? watering-place ; ? C. de St. drao ? of ? Cabo
do sail padrao,? Cape of the Holy Cross, (Harleyan Map).
The last, if such be the interpretation of it, either marks the
spot where a Padrao was set up, or is the vulgarisation of the
? Caput Sancte Crucis ? of the Hydroyraphia and the map
of Huysch?a general rather than a specific appellation,
coinciding with the name of the country, Terra Sanctae Crucis.
The next noticeable name is that of the deep harbour marked
? Hame ? or ? Havre des Yles,? for so I conceive we must
read ? Hame de Sylla,? the copyist converting the words
?de las Ylhas? into ?de Sylla.? Probably the legend ?ye
de Saill ? is a corruption of the same sort. This harbour of
islands corresponds to Rio de Janeiro, a little to the south of
which the coast-line in the Harleyan Map ceases to present
any distinct geographical features. On a map of 1550, how-
ever, the features are still depicted, and the last to be observed
is the ? Baye des Rivieres,? in the position of Rio Grande or
Sao Piedro do Sul.
An acquaintance with these charts of America was not
confined to the French school of cartography, for the same
outlines are to be found in a map by Cornelis de Jode,
entitled Hemispheric ab aequinoctiali linea ad circulu poli
atarctici, published in his Speculum Orhis, Antwerp, 1593.
He Jode?s adaptation differs in several striking particulars
from that of the French. The adapted American outlines


of De Jode occupy a similar position in his scheme of the
globe to the same outlines in the scheme of the Dieppe
school. They bear the name Ter. australis incognita. There
is no dividing strait corresponding to that which divides
Jave la Grande from Java; Java maior is in its proper
place as the island of Java ; the other islands of the Archi-
pelago which the French school unites with Jave la Grande
are not so united by De Jode, but are located elsewhere;
and the eastern coast is produced further to the south than
in any of the French MS. charts, and terminates with the
inscription ? Estrecho de Magellanes.? The most remark-
able difference, however, is that De Jode?s outlines are not
inverted, but are turned round an angle of 45�, so that the
north coast of South America becomes the west coast of the
Ter. australis incognita. Moreover, the country is not
hydrographically outlined, but is delineated so as to har-
monise with the continental character of the atlas. Its
name and description are engraved on the so-called Ter.
australis incognita , as follows : ?? Maxima et admiranda
insula occidentalis America, nuuc quarta pars orbis nominata :
ditissima fertilissimaq; omniu reru ad vita necessariaru.
Veteribus philosophis, cosmographis, et potentissimis Monarchis
ignota et primu imperante Carolo V. perlustrata. In his
peninsulis et isthmo, sunt maxime teraporu et reru varia-
tiones : quonia subiacent incoli 4 zonis, una frigida est, altera
torrida, tertia et quarta temperata,? I think we find in this
inscription a confirmation of the opinion, tenable on other
grounds, that the original charts were Spanish, as the Por-
tuguese receive no share of the honour of the discovery of
America. The legend bears internal evidence of the in-
fluence of Johann Schoener, who, in his Luculentissima
(juaeda terrae totius descriptio (Norim bergae, 1515), describes
the New World under the name ? America,? and speaks of
it as ? quarta orbis pars,? and ? insula mirae magnitudinis ?
an opinion which he subsequently renounced in favour of the
theory that America was united to Asia, citing, strangely
enough, the discoveries of Magellan as a proof:??Modo
vero per novissimas navigationes factas anno 1619, per
Magellanum versus Moluccas insulas in supremo oriente
positas earn terram invenerunt continentem superioris Indiae
quae pars est Asiae.? ( Opusculum Geographicum , Norim-
bergae, 1533, ii., 1 and 20.)
The ? America ? of De Jode bears few inscriptions, but
some of them are significant; such as ?R, S. Augustin,?


nearly in the position of the cape of that name, and corre-
sponding to the Rio S. Augustino of the Hydrographia ; and
in the extreme south, ? Estrecho de Magellanes.? This
record of Magellan?s voyage proves that the original of
this map of De Jode was compiled not earlier than 1522,
and the facts just mentioned regarding the opinions of
Schoener seem to indicate a German, perhaps Schoener
himself, as its compositor. An account of Magellan?s voyage
reduced from Pigafetta?s relation to the Emperor was sent
by Maximilian of Transylvania to Cardinal Lang, Arch-
bishop of Salzburg, then attending the Reichstag in Niirnberg,
in November, 1522; and the map or maps from which the
one we are considering was derived may have accompanied
and illustrated Maximilian?s letter, and been handed over
to the learned Schoener for his inspection and use, accom-
panied by the necessary directions which would enable him
to rectify the bearings.
In his address, ? Inspector! ? (1569), Mercator tells us that
for the purpose of delineating with exactitude the various
countries, he compared the nautical charts of the Spaniards
and Portuguese one with another, and also with most of the
printed and manuscript accounts of the voyages. Ortelius
acted as collector of materials, Mercator as elaborator,
and the former in his travels through the Netherlands,
Germany, Italy, and Great Britain, probably procured the
charts to which Mercator refers, including those used in
his construction of the Terra Australis. Gerard de Jode,
the father of Cornelis, worked at one time in company with
Ortelius, and may have had access to his collection, for there
was an excellent understanding between the various members
of the Antwerp school. It is not so easy to conjecture how
the Spanish charts passed into the possession of French
cartographers : certainly in a different manner, since they
appear in so different a guise. When Pigafetta visited
France after his return from the circumnavigation of the
globe, Giovanni Vespucci, nephew of Amerigo, held the
position of Piloto-Maior, and as such would be custodian of
the original charts. He seems to have been lax in his duties,
for he is said to have published a map of America in 1524,
for which action he was dismissed from office. Further, he
inherited all his uncle?s charts and papers. From him
Pigafetta may have improperly obtained copies of American
charts, and conveyed them with him to France. Maximilianus
Transylvanus may have done the same, and sent copies to


the Cardinal Archbishop of Salzburg. The coasts delineated
in the Harleyan Map correspond very closely with the coasts
visited by Vespucci in his second and third voyages, but we
have adduced reasons for believing that the southern portion,
at least, was the work of a less skilled hydrographer than
Vespucci. Not a few pilots were employed, first by the
Portuguese, then by the Spaniards, or vice versa, and
some of them even returned from their second masters to
their first: this greatly complicates the problem of the
nationality of the original explorer.
I have noted one or two points of resemblance between
the French MS. charts and that of Juan de la Cosa ;
and that pilot may have been the author of the northern
portion of the chart, from the vicinity of Cape St.
Roque westwards. The West Indian Islands included in
the chart may have been touched at in the outward or home-
ward voyage of the hydrographer, and were well known to
Juan de la Cosa from his connection with Columbus. In
Alonzo d?Hojeda?s voyage with De la Cosa as his pilot, from
May, 1499 to June, 1500, the ship of the commander was
wrecked, and d?Hojeda reached San Domingo in a small
boat on the sth September, 1499. As the outward voyage
from Cadiz to the American coast only occupied 42 days, it
is possible that d?Hojeda may have reached the Bay of
Honduras, been there wrecked, and afterwards reached San
Domingo, all between 27th June and sth September. If
the portion of the chart in question does emanate from
De la Cosa the shipwreck (and probable loss of compass) might
account for the inaccuracy in the direction given to the coast
of Honduras.
The illustrations with which the Dauphin and the other
MS. maps are enriched are an addition of the colourist; for
such illustrations are never present in simple hydrographic
charts. Moreover the illustrations in some of them, as in
that of Desceliers of 1550, do not in all cases refer to the
countries where they occur, but to quite other parts of the
world. It is very doubtful whether the illustrations were
copied from original drawings at all ; those of Desceliers
(1650), for example, are mere figments of the artist?s brain
based upon the tales of travellers. Such are the group of
dog-headed beings representing the inhabitants of Angania
or the Andaman Islands, according with the account of
Marco Polo (ed. Panthier, cap. clxvii.); whilst the group of
sun and ox worshippers represents the cults ascribed to the


Javanese by Varthema (Travels, Hakluyt Soc., 1863, pp.
251-2). The illustrations of the Harleyan Map are suf-
ciently real to be based upon the descriptions by Vespucci
and Pigafetta of what they saw in Central and South
America. Vespucci mentions pigs and deer amongst the
animals he saw in his first voyage (Lettera delle isole,
p 14); the natives are said to be naked and to deprive their
bodies?of all hair except that on the head ; they carried bows
and arrows, clubs and spears, hardened in the fire (p. ),
they had their meat in earthen basins or in the halves of
pumpkins (p. 6), which are represented in two places on the
Save la Grande of the Harleyan Map ; their houses were
made like huts or cabins (capanne) of very large trees
covered with palm-leaves, and in some places of so great
length and breadth that in one single house dwelt six
hundred persons (p. 7). In the second voyage, Vespucci
observed on the island supposed to be Margarita, that the
inhabitants dwelt underneath arbours, which protected them
from the sun but not from the rain (p. 21) ?a rude shelter
such as is depicted on the Harleyan Map, which also
represents the palm-trees. In his description of the country
and inhabitants of Verzin or Brazil, Pigafetta accords with
Vespucci in certain particulars. They have (pigs which have
their navel on the back) (Voyage of Magellan, Hakluyt ooc.,
p. 46); the men wear no beard, because they pluck it out
(p. 45); their dwellings are long houses, in each ot which
there dwells a hundred persons (p. 44). The Patagonians
who were encountered in Port S. Julian had low huts or
tents made of the skins of the guanaco and removed their
huts from place to place. These huts may be intended by
the conical structures of Desceliers. The object most
characteristic of South America is the guanaco, for such
seems to be intended by the camel-like animal that appears
on some of these maps. As drawn by Desceliers in 1500
it is very much of a monster, and might well have been
conceived after the description of PigafettaThis beast
has the head and ears of the size of a mule, and the neck
and body of the fashion of a camel, the legs of a deer and the
tail like that of a horse, and it neighs like a horse. ( Voyage
of Magellan, p. 50.) And further on Piggafetta relates
that the natives tamed this animal and led it with a cord, as
we find represented by Desceliers. The juxtaposition of
these South American subjects with the outlines of South
America may be fortuitous. Jave ia Grande offered ample


scope for the purpose of illustrations, and may have been
merely selected as a convenient blank space in which to
place them, their appropriate position being more or less
conjectural. At the same time our suggestion about Piga-
fetta?s possible share in the dissemination of these charts is
upheld by the agreement between his written descriptions
and the illuminations on the Harleyan Map.
Ihe dates of the mappemondes of Desliens, 1566, and of
Jean Cossin, 1570, overlap that of Gerardus Mercator?s Nova
et aucta terrae descriptio, the engraving of which was finished
at Duisburg in August, 1569. The distinguishing feature in
this map was the new projection devised by the engraver,
which develops the degrees of latitude in a ratio pro-
portional with the increase in the degrees of longitude.
Mercator himself said that his projection lacked mathematical
justification, but that it was the only method by which the
sphere could be reduced to a plane projection, and that it
would be convenient for navigators. The navigators, how-
ever, were slow to avail themselves of new and untried
methods, and despised a map which displayed coasts that
were unknown to them, and which subordinated nautical
details to a theoretical tout ensemble. Mercator had very
clear and definite views on the subject of a southern con-
tinent. His biographer, Gualterus Gymniis, says that
he divided the world into three continents, one of which
consisted of Asia, Africa, and Europe, the other was
India Nova or Occidentalis, or America, and of the third,
although he was not ignorant of the fact that it was still
unknown, yet he affirmed that he could demonstrate the
existence by solid reasons, and that it was not inferior to the
other two in size and weight, for, if it were, the globe could
not remain stable with respect to its equilibrium. ( Gymniis ,
Vita Mercatoris .) If we turn to the map of 1569 for the
representation of this theory, (traceable also in his world-
map of 1538) we find the whole Southern Ocean awanting
and its place approximately occupied by a southern con-
tinent. Beginning from the Terra del Fuego, which is
made a part of it, the 7 erra Australis extends in a north-
westerly direction towards New Guinea, with which it forms
a strait, then trends S.W., W., and N,, so forming a gulf
in which lie the islands of Java Minor and Petan, followed
by a promontory inscribed with the names Maletur, Lucach,
and Beach, a corrupted form of Lucach. I have explained
how these names, occurring in the Book of Marco Polo, were


erroneously placed to the south of Java. But the promon-
tary on which they occur, the adjacent gulf to the east of it,
and the coast-line thence to the Straits of Magellan, show
another influence?the same influence that produced the Java
Maior of the Dieppe school of hydrography. To the west
of the northern promontory is another gulf. Then follows
the Terra Psittacorum, lying nearly due east and west in
about 44� S.; then the Promontorium Terra Australis of
Enciso in 42� S. and 15� E. from Boavista. From this
cape the coast-line trends southwards to rejoin the Terra del
Fuego.
An element unknown to the French cartographers occurs in
this conception, namely, Tierra del Fuego, and its conjunction
with the Terra Australis. There was an old theory that
a strait divided the continent of South America and con-
nected the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and when De Solis
discovered the mouth of La Plata it was believed that he had
discovered the entrance to this strait. (Pigafetta, Voyage
of Magellan, p. 48.) The same theory is upheld by
Schoener on his globe of 1520, in which the strait is placed
in about 45� S., and is made to divide the Terra Nova
from another continent named Brasilia Inferior. The
Genoese pilot who recounts the voyage tells us that Magellan
successively entered the Rio de ia Plata and the Bay of St.
Matthias, in the expectation of finding an entrance to the
strait. And when the strait was actually found, it was
assumed that the land which lay to the south of it was a part
of the Terra Australis. An inscription on a map entitled
Brasilia et Peruvia in the Speculum Orbis shows how
confused were the ideas of geographers on the subject
of the Terra Australis; it runs:?? Chaesdia seu Australis
Terra quam nautarum vulgus Tierra di Fuego vocant alii
Psittacorum Terrain.? This error was not removed until
Drake, in his voyage round the world, was driven to fully
57� S. in September, 1578, wdien he found that the two
oceans united, and that islands only lay to the south of
Magellan?s Strait. The assumed continuity of the Tierra del
Fuego with the Terra Australis would induce the ascription of
the discovery of the latter to Magellan. This was do.ic bv
Mercator, Ortelius, and others, for they inscribe on their
Terra Australis the words :?? Hanc continentem australem
nonulli Magellanicam regionem ab ejus inventore nuncupant.?
The Terra del Fuego of Mercator and Ortelius is perhaps
a misplaced portion of the mainland of America, \t least


there is a coincidence of nomenclature suggestive of some
such misplacement. A Cabo Deseado, correctly placed at
the western entrance of the straits, is also to be found on the
Hydrographic Portugaise near the Gulf of Paria ; Golfo di
San Sebastiano has a synonym in the Porto de San Sebastiano
applied to Rio de Janeiro by Diego Ribero (1527) and the
author of the Hydrograj)hie.
Let me recapitulate. The Terra Australis of Mercator
consists of the following elements :
(1.) The outline from about 130� E. of Boavista to
Cabo di bon Signale in 290� E. This portion includes
Nova Guinea, and corresponds with the Ter. australis
incognita of Cornells de Jode and the Jave la Grande of the
French MS. charts. It is based upon charts of America
from the Gulf of Honduras to the Straits of Magellan.
(2.) The outline from C. di bon Signale to Ysole do
Cressalina and Golfo di San Sebastiano; possibly another
misplaced portion of the American continent.
(3.) The outline from Golfo di San Sebastiano to the
Promontorium Terrse Australis ; in part purely conjectural,
in part representing Vespucci?s discovery of land beyond
52� S.
(4.) The outline from the Promontorium Terrae Australis
to the point of commencement; in part representing Cabral?s
discovery of Brazil under the name Terra Psittacorum, in
part purely conjectural.
The results of the whole investigation may be thus sum-
marised : ?The theory of an antipodal continent arose as a con-
sequence of a belief in the sphericity of the earth. It was
strengthened by the conceptions of Marinus and Ptolemy
regarding the configuration of the African continent, and in
this aspect held a place in the system of the Arabs. After a
long lapse of time, during which geography was not a science
but a body of dogmas,thf^heorywa^^
in consequence of the new discoveries of the
16th century ; and these were erroneously located in a
position analogous to that previously assigned to the anti-
podal continent. This is to be first observed on maps
ascribed to Leonardo da Vinci about 1514, on a mappe-
monde by La Salle, in La Salade nouvellement imprimte,
1522, and, with evident reference to American discovery,
in the Mappemonde of Fine, 1531. Mercator finally for-
mulates the theory in 1669, having previously indicated


his opinions in his map of the world of 1538 in the words
placed on the Antarctic continent to the south of Magel-
lan?s Straits : ?? Terras hue esse certum est, sed quantas
quibusq; limitibus finitas incertum.? The theory thus pro-
pounded receives sanction from many quarters, especially
from the Memorials of De Quiros and of Jean Paulmier.
Here I must close this investigation for the present. If
any proof were required of the complete absence of all con-
nection between the theory of a Terra Australis and the
geographical fact of the Australian continent, it would surely
be found herein?that the belief in the former persisted for a
hundred years after Australia was visited and mapped by
Dutch navigators. And yet to this day a confusion exists
between these distinct phenomena, which blurs the out-
lines of early Australian history. That history may be
compared to the history of three streams which have
their source in an unknown and half mythical country.
There is the stream of Portuguese ascendancy in the East.
That stream undergoes changes in the end of the sixteenth
century, and from being Portuguese becomes first Spanish
then Dutch. Then there is the stream of Spanish conquest
passing through Spanish America. A Cortes saw it flow,
unwitting whither it went, a De Quiros sailed over its waters,
but they bore him to no certain haven. Lastly, there was the
French stream, romantic in its origin and flow, its waters
liberated at the touch of a native of the mythical land, dis-
closed to the world?s view by his descendant after three genera-
tions of silence, and only disappearing, late in time, on the
borderland of EnglisJi enterprise and colonisation. To trace
the course of these parent streams, and to discriminate them
from their tributary waters is the task of the man who would
map out the various origins of the history of Australia.
