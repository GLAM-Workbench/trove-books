The Cover
The picture on the cover is a scene from the
’9o’s showing the stage line preparing to leave
Ukiah for its daily trip to Lakeport.
The driver, or the man who handles “the rib-
bons”, is Jim Miller, champion stage coach driver
of the country.
The line was advertised as the best equipped
line in the state, and the literature goes on to say:
“Grand scenery, fine road, easy riding coaches,
canopy tops, full upholstered high lazy backs.
Careful, accommodating and experienced drivers.”
The scene is taken in front of the Mendocino
County Court House

• In short, an historical record made possible through fine co-
operation by many Mendocinahs!
• Our readers will note with interest the variation in depth and
quality of the old photographs reproduced on these pages. This is
entirely due to the degree old pictures fade as the years go by. Many
of the pictures used are fifty and sixty years old. The engraving is
splendidly done throughout, thus making it possible to record and
share the old photographs in their true historical perspective.

_ Magnificent Mendocino! When
'our eyes light on this beautiful
if and grand 5 edunti* of California’s
mighty 58, they echo the feeling
of true magnificence that only
verdant mountains and peaceful
valleys can produce. To the
traveller viewing Mendocino for
the first time, he can but ex-
claim .in sheer delight at the nat-
ural beauty he sees here.
In size the county’s extreme
length north and south is 84
miles ahd ’its greatest width is
64 miles. It has,an area of 3,500
square mite's or about 2,000,000
acres of land. It has 100 miles
of coast line along the Pacific
Ocean broken by many beauti-
ful bays affording valuable har-
bors.


County Supervisors Met Here
Back in Civil War days, this was the Court
House for Mendocino County. Built in Ukiah for
$9,000 in 1859, it wasn’t large enough for a thriv-
ing countryside, was replaced in 1872 by a $40,000
structure. The latter building is giving way in
1949 to a new $8OO,OOO Court House.

The musical and historic name
of Mendocino which was bestow-
ed on the Cape by its discoverer
Cabrillo in 1542, in honor of his
patron, the viceroy of Mexico,
Antonio de Mendoza. 300 years
later it became the name of this
county.
The first legislature met at
San Jose and passed an act on
Feb. 18, 1850, which provided for
the subdivision of the state into
counties and the establishment
of seats of justice therein.
It also defined the boundaries
of Mendocino County and at-
tached it to Sonoma County for
judicial purposes. By an act of
the legislature dated April 25,
1857, Mendocino County was at-
tached to Sonoma County for
revenue purposes as well.

A Gay 90's Fourth of July Parade
The parade, led by a band, made a stirring
scene for the spectators, many of whom are taking
advantage of the view gained from the balconies
of the old Palace Hotel. The hotel was built in
1891, and though it has been completely remod-
eled since that day, it has witnessed many such
important events as this during its 58 year history.
Four grants of land were made
by Mexico to individuals in this
county before the territory was
acquired by the United States.
The Del Norte Grant was said
to have been given to Rafael
Garcia by Manuel Michaeltor-
ena in 1844.
The Albion Grant containing
11 square leagues of land and ex-
tending from Big River to the
Garcia River was given to Cap-
tain William Richardson by the
same authority in the same year.
Capt. Richardson was an Eng-
lishman and named his grant for
his native country. The bound-
aries of the Albion and Garcia
Grants overlapped but no trouble
arose over that fact as neither of
the coast grants were confirmed
by the department assembly at
Mexico City and the claims of the
grantees were rejected.

Wheat Ground Into Flour Here
This old view of the City Mills in Ukiah was
taken after the building was erected where the
Ukiah Theater now stands. Mr. L. J. Holzhauser
purchased the mill in 1902, and took in as part-
ners J. L. Brown, W. W. Porterfield, E. E. Nan-
kins and G. E. Jamison. The mill was sold by
Mr. Holzhauser’S firm in 1920.
The Sanel Grant of four square
leagues of land covering the en-
tire Sanel Valley was made to
Fernando Felez by Manuel Mich-
atorena, Nov. 9, 1844.
The Yokayo Grant of eight
square leagues of land covering
Ukiah and Redwood Valleys was
made to Cayetano Juarez by Pio
Pico May 24, 1845. The Yokayo
Grant was eighteen miles long
and one mile wide and contained
35,541.33 acres of land.
In the Indian language, there
has been some question as to the
exact meaning of the word Yo-
kayo. The most generally ac-
cepted version, which present In-
dians hold to, is “deep valley.”
The present day word “Ukiah” is
merely a corruption or popular
pronunciation of Yokayo

Prior to the white man’s ar-
rival, this great county of Men-
docino was populated by the
California Indian. His life was
a roving one, for there was no
fixed habitation then. For
clothes, the skins of wild animals
made them covering enough, but
the males generally wore abso-
lutely nothing except an arrow
passed through the hair! One of
the Indians thus clad visited
General Vallejo at Sonoma. As
the day was cold the General
asked his guest if he was not
cold. ’“No,” was the answer, “Is
your face cold?” “Not at all”,
replied Vallejo, “I never wear
anything on my face”. “Then”,
replied the Indian, triumphantly,
“I am all face!”

Mendocino Indians At Work
It has been said that the Pomo Indians of
Mendocino, Sonoma and Lake Counties excelled
all other peoples of the world in basket weaving.
The baskets were specialized in size, shape and
texture in accordance with the uses for which
they were intended. The pictures above show
the decorative, upper, and the utilitarian type
in the lower view.

3-R MARKET, next to 12th District Fair Grounds, Ukiah
In truth, when it came to
shearing sheep, the Indians sur-
passed the white men, for they
were more gentle with the ani-
mals. They were not excelled at
hop-picking; the women were
especially good pickers.
The Indians were capable of
remarkable endurance. Indians
carried several heavy government
wagons from Sherwood Valley to
Noyo, a distance of 20 miles, and
over a mountain trail. One man
would trudge along with a wheel;
two men would take an axle tree.
They delighted in the early days
to go with some rancher to the
coast and carry his freight and
provisions in to the ranch. It
was a holiday spree for them.

Fine Ranches Abound In Hopland
The upper view shows the old Foster home,
now owned by the Haas Ranch in Hopland. Mr.
Foster was a pioneer of much courage and vision;
he worked for greater developments in railroading
and lumber milling, at the turn of the century and
thereafter.
Lower scene show's the important weighing
operation in the hop picking business essential
to determining the hop picker’s pay. The pho-
tographer got many interesting spectators, too, in
this scene.

DUNCAN SPRINGS, Hopland
The town of Hopland, estab-
lished in 1859, with its hotel,
stores, bank and schools, is well
located on U. S. Highway 101.
Old Hopland, established in
1874, exists now on the East side
of the Russian River. It sprang
up when a toll road to Ukiah was
built on the East side of the
river. The coming of the rail-
road on the West side swung
most of the town back to the
present city of Hopland.
Duncan Springs incorporated
in 1895, has a long and success-
ful history as a relaxing summer
resort 1 % miles Southwest of
Hopland on a beautiful shoulder
of Sanel Peak. The Duncans, for
whom the mineral springs were
named, arrived in Sanel Valley in
1858.

Hop Vines Shade Fertile Fields
The Sanel Valley’s rich farmlands along the
upper reaches of the Russian River grow hop vines
at the rate of ten or twelve inches per day during
the season.
The first hops were planted in 1858 by Stephen
Warren Knowles, who sold his first crop, dried in
the loft of his barn, for 30c a pound.

There is a popular legend re-
garding Squaw Rock, or Lover’s
Leap, a huge majestic rock rising
several hundred feet from the
bank of the Russian River six
miles South of Hopland. Cachow
was a prince of the Indian tribe
living in Cloverdale; handsome,
and a mighty hunter. Sotuka
was a beautiful black haired
princess of the Hopland Indians;
graceful, and skilled in cooking
of venisons and grasshoppers and
making buckeye mush.
Cachow attended a harvest feast
at Sotuka’s father’s invitation,
fell in love with the beautiful So-
tuka, and became betrothed. He
promised to return soon with
gifts for the marriage .

Pears Become A Principle Crop
This view shows a small section of the rich
Ukiah valley’s acres planted to Bartlett pears.
Cue of the oldest orchards in the county is pic-
tured on the lower left of this view.
16,000 tons of Bartlett Pears were marketed in
this county in 1947. Irrigation, pest control, fer-
tilization, and maturity of young orchards have
led to increasing yields per acre in recent years.
Pears bring a yearly income of $2,000,000 to
Mendocino; 2000 workers are required, with an-
nual wages paid $750,000; supplies and equipment
purchased annually by this industry in Mendocino
County amounts to $750,000.

Before two moons were up, Ca-
chow was unfaithful to his prom-
ise and wedded another. During
his bridal tour he camped under
Squaw’s Rock, under the preci-
pice,
Sotuka, planning revenge, was
informed by a scout of the camp-
ing place. When night came, So-
tuka stole up the western slope
of the rock, saw the bridal pair
fast asleep by the embers of their
campfire. Stung by desperation,
she clasped a stone as large as
she could lift, and leaped from
this height upon her sleeping vic-
tims. The tragic end for all thus
marked the rock as “Lover’s
Leap”.
John Parker was the first white
man after Fernando Feliz to have
a house within the present limits
of the county.

Sunny Shies Aid Bartlett Grawth
The picture on the upper left shows Bartlett
pears on a thriving orchard North of Ukiah taken
in June 1924. The trees on the left in the picture
were ten years old then; those on the right six
years.
The scene on the upper right shows the same
orchard photographed in July 1949. 25 years
have added visibly to its stature and productivity.
The trees are now over 40 years old and no doubt
feel like humans—“Life begins at 40!”
Lower left is view of pears being picked on
the first day of picking in 1949, August 1st. Note
the apron the picker uses is supported by a strap
around the back of the neck for comfort.
Lower right, view of pears being transferred
from the apron to the boxes in the orchard, prior
to being trucked to the packing sheds. Mendocino
pears are noted for large size and sweet taste.

Others who came into Ukiah
Valley during 1857 were George
B. Mathers, Berry Wright, Thom-
as F. Beattie, John Barton, Wil-
liam Acton, Lewis M. Ruddick and
William J. Cleveland. During
1858, M. W. Howard and J. G.
Busch are known to have settled
in the valley. In 1859, J. F. Todd
and I. C. Reed came.
C. H. Veeder settled at Calpella
in 1857, and gave the place the
name of the chief of the Indian
tribe located there which accord-
ing to Dr. J. W. Hudson means
miser or money grabber.
The first courthouse was erect-
ed on the site of the present
building at a cost of about $9,000
in 1859. The second courthouse
was built in the spring of 1872 at
a cost of $40,000. The third
courthouse under construction in
1949 will cost $BOO,OOO.

were J. B. Moore, E. W. King,
M.D., T. L. Carothers, Samuel
Orr, R. N. Willing, Trustees;
Thomas Chalfant, Marshal, and
I. Isaacs, Treasurer.
The first hotel in the town was

southwest corner of Main and
Standley Streets in 1859.
The first store in Ukiah was
by A. T. Perkins and John Burton
on the corner of Main and Smith
Streets in the spring of 1858.
The first school in Ukiah was
erected by A. T. Perkins and John
R. Short south of Perkins Street
and west of State Street in 1858
and was donated to the public
by the builders.

County was built there. Note the Methodist
church on the left, the Baptist church steeple
(later remodeled) in the right center, and the
Christian church on the extreme right foreground.
The first church in town was
the Methodist Episcopal built
through the efforts of Rev. W. S.
Bryan in 1862.
The first issue of the Ukiah
City Press was published by E. J.
Handley, July 4, 1876. It is now
owned and published by W. G.
Shackleton.
The original purchase of 100
acres of land as a site for the
Mendocino State Hospital was
purchased for $30,000 in 1889.
The Carnegie Library was com-
pleted and formally opened Ap-
ril 17, 1914.
The Bank of Ukiah was organ-
ized in 1874 with A. F. Redemeyer
as president and Sam Wheeler as
cashier.
The Savings Bank of Mendo-
cino County was incorporated
on November 28, 1903 with J. H.
Barker as president. In 1914,

W. P. Thomas as president. The
bank was sold to the Bank of
Italy on March 29, 1926. It be-
came the Bank of America, N. T.
& S. A. in 1930, and has erected a
fine new building on School

Grapes Mendocino's Largest Truit Crop
Upper view shows a typical Ukiah Valley grape
vine in July, with grapes setting in profusion un-

Lower view shows one of the earliest grape
vineyard scenes, familiarly known as “Little
Italy”, above Calpella. Note the extensive hill
cultivation. 7,337 acres were devoted to grapes
in 1947 in Mendocino County, with a total produc-
tion of 17,000 tons.

Ukiah is now experiencing one
of the greatest periods of growth
and development in its history.
Pear growing and packing is
flourishing; vineyards and wine
making are important industries;
the Masonite Company is con-
structing a tremendous plant and
their own truck highway.
Before leaving Ukiah we must
recall one of the early day leg-
ends. It concerns the early day
bar and hotel which stood on the
northwest corner of Standley and
Main Streets in the ’so’s. In the
days of its glory it was no un-
common thing for men to ride
their horses up to the bar and
quaff their liquor while seated in
the saddle!
Legend had it that there were
enough bullets in the siding of
the building to sink it.

Seabiscuit And Hangman's Oah
In thinking of Mendocino County, one associ-
ates horse race breeding as a successful business.
Flare on the Howard Ranch Seabiscuit had his
home; the picture above is his stable. Seabiscuit
died in 1947, and a statue has been erected to
him, beside this barn, for the public to view.
The Oak in front of the stable has been re-
ferred to as Hangman’s Oak. The large oak on
highway 101, ½ mile South of the entrance to
the Howard ranch, shown in the inset, has also
been known as Hangman’s Oak. Note the large
branch which no doubt was used for hangings
has been cut off to make way for modern traffic
over Highway 101.
“Brigham” Young was the
name of the proprietor of the
lodging house upstairs. Old
timers told the story of how
“Brigham” used to furnish lodg-
ings for forty men with only
twenty-five pair of blankets! He
v/ould “borrow” them from 15
sleepers as needed for the new-
comers. His regular lodgers got
on to the dodge, and got around
him by always retiring last!
It always required two whole
days to travel from San Fran-
cisco to Ukiah in those days. The
stage left San Francisco at noon,
stayed at Petaluma the first
night; then it took all day to
drive to Cloverdale. After spend-
ing all night there, the next day
at noon the passengers alighted
at Ukiah.

Apples Typily Anderson Valley
Rich Anderson Valley has been noted for de-
licious apples since early days. The scene at the
top left taken in July shows apples during their
growing season. Top right view shows apples
during the beautiful blossom season. Some or-
chards in Anderson Valley were planted fifty years
ago and more, and are still bearing.
The views at the bottom show the old Hutsell
ranch, now known as the G. P. Bradford ranch,
with apples in bloom in the spring. Every year
Boonville has a county fair, along with an apple
show, in October, after the harvest is over.

Boonville
Walter Anderson, the pioneer
settler for whom Anderson Val-
ley was named, came up from
Sonoma County accompanied by
his family and settled about a
mile northwest of the present
town of Boonville in 1851. He
lived there seven years and then
sold the place to Joseph Rawles
and moved away. Many of the
descendants of Joseph Rawles
are prominent citizens of this
county.
William Prather and John
Gschwend came to the valley in
1855. For the past twenty-five
years, descendants of William
Prather have held an annual re-
union in Anderson Valley which
is usually attended by from 50
to 80 family members.

The first town in the valley was
started about a mile south of
Bconville at a place where three
ways met and was known as “The
Corners.” John Burgot built a
hotel there which he called the
Anderson House in 1862. Samuel
.elevens built a blacksmith shop
and Levi & Harrison a store.
Alonzo Kendall built a hotel on
the site of the present town of
Boonville and called the place
Kendall’s City. Charles Brad-
way opened a blacksmith shop
and Levi & Straus moved their
store there. They soon sold out
to W. W. Boone, who bequeathed
his name to the town, as Mr.
Kendall had moved to Manches-
ter.
Yorkville, in the southern part
of the township, was named for
R. H. York, its pioneer settler.
Other prominent families of the
neighborhood were those of E. M
Hiatt and J. S. Ornbaun.

John Gschwend built the first
sawmill in the township in 1856.
He added a grist mill in 1864,
which supplied the community
with flour until 1875, when the
mill was destroyed by fire.
The Gschwends, Guntleys and
Gossmans were Swiss and formed
a settlement at the lower end of
the valley long known as “Gunt-
leys” and later as Christine for
Mrs. J. Reilly, a daughter of John
Gschwend.
Philo, nine miles north of Boon-
ville, has a Methodist church,
postoffice, store and several
homes. When the postoffice was
established, Cornelius Prather,
postmaster, named it Philo after
a favorite friend of his. The
Prather and Brown families have
been the leading residents for
several generations.

Historians claim that the Gua-
lala River which forms a part of
the southern boundary of the
county was originally named
Valhalla, after the Paradise of
Norse mythology by the Germans
who at one time owned the
Rancho de Herman in Sonoma
County. The attractive name
was corrupted into Gualala by
the Spanish and was further
mispronounced by later settlers.
J. A. Hamilton, Joseph Shep-
pard and William Olive brought
a drove of cattle from Yolo coun-
ty and settled on claims in the
Garcia River bottoms in 1855.
Doubtless to them belongs the
honor of being the first white
settlers in that vicinity outside
of the owners of the Garcia
Grant.

The military post at the Men-

Lieutenant H. G. Gibson in 1857
was named Fort Bragg in honor
of Colonel Braxton Bragg of
Mexican War fame. The reser-
vation was abandoned in 1807,
but the lumber industry devel-
oped and the town grew and
flourished.
The moving of a mill from Ten
River to Fort Bragg in 1885 start-
ed the town, which flourished.
This mill is the Union Lumber
Company, a credit in every way
in policy, management and pro-

Willits in 1865. Hiram Willits
bought the store and continued
to operate it until 1883 when he
sold out to Cerf and Lobree, who
in turn sold it to the Irvine &
Muir Co.
The town was named for Hiram
Willits, who was the original
owner of the land on which it
stood. Willits is located on U. S.

sat around the campfire spinning

Mendocino County history in-

bers was the elusive road agent,
“Black Bart”. He was a lone high-
wayman, traveling on foot, who
robbed 2,1 coaches in the Sierra
and Coast Range mountain
mountain country between 1875
and 1883. Always, polite fastidi-
ously dressed in a linen duster
and mask, he used to leave be-
hind facetious rhymes signed
“Black Bart, Po-8”, in mail and
express boxes after he had fin-
ished rifling them.
A laundry mark on a handker-

one robbery eventually led pur-
suers to San Francisco, where
“Black Bart”: was discovered to
be the highly respectable Mr.

When Mendocino County was
first settled, game was plen-
tiful here, and a good thing
it was, too. The deer provided
plenty of good meat for the table,
and the h des were valuable. The
demand lor hides got so great
that around 1900 to 1910, there
were many men hunting for the
market; some killed as many as
5000 deer in their lives, we’re told.
To preserve the deer supply,
seasons and limits were set up,
and the number of deer increased
to about ten years ago, when the
peak was reached. The pressure
of hunters since has gradually
decreased the supply. Mendoci-
no County leads in the State for
number of deer killed, usually
running about 3400 each year.
