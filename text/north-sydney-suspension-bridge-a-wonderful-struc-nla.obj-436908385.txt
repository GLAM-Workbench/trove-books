North Sydney Suspension Bridge.
:a wonderful structure.
One of the lmposing Sights in South Wales—the second
Largest Suspension Bridge of the lsind in the morld.
p' f’>u 5-/
Very few people in Sydney, to say nothing of visitors from the cotfriiry,
are aware of the fact that they have at their very doors one of the Sights
of New South Wales that really is worth seeing, viz : —The second largest,
but in appearance handsomest, Cable Suspension Bridge in the woxdd—the
one that connects The Association of North Sydney Debenture Holders
Estate with North Sydney. Those who see this magnificent structure for
the first time are amazed, as in truth they may well be. It will fully and
amply repay the sight-seer the time spent upon a visit, not only on account
of the bold and imposing feature of this work, but because of the pic-
turesque position of the surroundings.
From the tux-ret “lookouts” upon the masonary pillars in
of the bridge a commanding and all entrancing view of the bays in the
Harbour is instantly before you, xxotably Middle Harbouxq Long Bay,
Willoughby, and the Crow’s Nest, etc., etc. The wild flowers growing in
px’ofusion upon the Association’s property, are much sought after, so that
the visitor will find pleasure in the flowers and surprise in the bridge.
Some idea of the size of the bxfidge and the importance of the woxflc
may be gained by a perusal of the followixxg figures :
The noble masonry turrets that face you at the entrance and claim
your attention at the centre, and then at the end of the bridge, are works
of art with castle battlements and towers, that x’epresent guns to the num-
ber of 112. From the tux’rets at the entx’ance to the turx’ets at the end of


the bridge it is exactly one thousand and ten feet —with a width all
through of thirty feet. The height of the bridge above high water level is
exactly one hundred and eighty-six feet ; and the height of the towers, or
centre turrets, at the look-out platform, one hundred and sixteen feet.
The base of the tower is twenty-five feet by twenty-five, tapering in kind
and effective proportion to sixteen feet by sixteen feet at the summit.
The stone used in connection with the towers and wherever else about the
bridge is of a very superior order, being a sandstone, obtained especially
at the lower end of Middle Harbour, and conveyed to the work by steamer
and punt.
The decking, or wood work of the bridge, is of selected iron bark,
each plank running the full width in one piece. The planks are five inches
wide by three and a half thick. Over one hundred and ten thousand
superficial feet of decking timber alone it is calculated must have been used
for the flooring, and was seasoned two years before being placed in position.
The idea of the importance of the Suspension Bridge under notice will
be found in the fact that of ixxxn and steel no less than two thousand four
hundred tons were used. The wire ropes have each one hundred and
-eighty-two wires to the cable, and there are seven stx’ands to each cable, the
length of each being twelve hundx-ed axxd forty-two feet; the weight of
each being four tons twelve hundx’ed weights ; its testing strain five hun-
dred and sixty tons each. There are forty-two cables.
There are four tunnels, and it took a day and xxight staff over two
yeax’s to cut them. The mouths are five feet six inches by fHe feet six
inches —terminating at one hundred and nine-feet —and at an angle of
fox'ty-five degi’ees, and terminating at thx’ee feet two inches by eleven feet
at tlxe anchor chamber. The anchor plates in the tunnels—axxd there ax’e
three in each tunnel—weigh two tons each, axxd are placed : the first twelve
inches from the base of the floor of the tunnel ; the second, two feet; the
third, three feet. The quantity of cement (all tested and proved best Port-
land) used for the concxete wox-k in each tunnel was one tlxousand and ten
casks—in itself a small fortune at the price cement then stood. The cables


are of tire very best steel, and in the tunnels are clipped together with steel
plates and screws at a temperature of seventy degrees in the shade for the
services of the theodolite and thermometer. Everything is steel wdth the
exception of the pallisadings. which are cast iron. The iron and steel was
imported from the Clyde, Scotland —and the cable from a fii’m in Warwick,
England. There are sixty-four cross-girders, the weight of each being two
tons seventeen hundred weight.
For the purpose of contraction and expansion—a most important
affair—there is three feet of camber in the centre of the bridge and four-
teen inches from the abatement to their pier. When at a tempex’ature of
one hundi’ed and ten degrees in the shade there is only four inches of the
camber left in the bridge, it thus dx-opping two feet eight inches. Keen
skill and wondx’ous cai'e is everywhere apparent.
The great expansion x’ollers are fox’ty-nine feet nine ixxches from centx’e
to centx’e, and are sitxxate in the turrets. Of latest and most appx’oved de-
sign, and made of the very best steel, these rollex’s px’ove very intei’esting
to those initiated in engineering.
The carrying capacity of the bxndge is ten thousaxid tons. The whole
of the bxddge is suspended by the cables. The bx’idge px’ovided work for
an army of mechanics and others for a pexnod of two years and nine
months. Its cost in x’ound numbers ran into one hundx’ed thousand
pounds, and it was put together without either scaffolding or staging of any
kind whatever. The work was commenced at each end, and completed in
the eentx’e. The electric trams from Milson’s Point quickly takes passengei’s
to it, and a trifling toll fee of thx’eepence return ticket is all that it costs to
inspect this tx-uly national work of ours.
A refreshment room has xxow been built at the bridge whex’e all kinds
of refreshments may be obtained at reasonable px’ices.
