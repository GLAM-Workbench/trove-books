aJgIURING the EXHIBITION SEASON a large
1 number of Visitors will arrive in Melbourne,
and as the great majority will be strangers,
we have hM the accompanying Plans prepared,
which we venture to think will prove useful to those
who are unacquainted with the City.
********* * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
The Plan of Melbourne shows the Railway
Stations, Tram Routes, Public Institutions, &c.; and
that of the Exhibition will enable Visitors to find
the different Courts.
***********************
On another page, we have enumerated the j
places worth visiting, which we trust will be of
service to all who receive a copy of this publi-
cation.
