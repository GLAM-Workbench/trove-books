HOMESTEAD SETTLEMENT,
There is one aspect of our colonisation, for the time out of
repute, and hardly mentioned but to be pooh-poohed, that
nevertheless must eventually involve the most vital and
essential of all questions in our national policy.
A flush of wealth has for some years past tinted colonial
life with rose colour. We have found out the secret of
money-making, and buoyed up on the full tide of prosperity,
we believe firmly that, whatever is, is right. The accidental
conditions which have attended the growth of our bank
balances, have naturally but illogically come to be looked
upon as creative causes and fundamental laws of wealth.
Consequently, with a practical but somewhat microscopic eye
we recognise heartily the outward and visible signs of pros-
perity, as shown in successful squatters and heavily-laden
wool-ships ; but we appreciate very slightly that far more
durable and fruitful growth which accompanies populous and
successful settlement.
If any well-to-do colonist, not a ? theorist? or a ? mono-
maniac,? but a good sound-headed business man, experienced
in mining speculations and well up in stock and station
matters, were asked whether he thought it more desirable for
the public interest that a certain territory producing 1000
bales of wool yearly should be in the hands of one proprietor
or of fifty, he would at once say that it were better in the shape
of one propert) T , better for the interest of the capitalist and
more favourable for the successful production of the wool.
If it were put to him further, supposing that the property
belonged to an English corporation, represented here by a
paid manager carrying on his work by yearly overseers and
weekly men, while under the alternative method each of the
fifty small stockowners represented a family living on and
working their farm by their own labour, the gross number so
supported being twenty times the staff on the large station,


his only remark would be that it would never pay them, and
that they would be much better earning wages, working on
the diggings, or doing anything else?unless our friend
happened to have a store or other business liable to experi-
ence the influences of these respective methods, in which
case facts palpable to his pocket might give a new direction
to his views.
If the contrast were further extended between a large
squatting company, occupying say one million of acres, or a
tract of about forty miles each way, and the same extent of
country laid out, as is to be seen in some favoured spots, by
mixed settlement, with sheep and cattle farms behind, and
lucerne-paddocks, corn-fields, vineyards, and gardens on the
frontages, in the hands of some hundreds of families, the
properties being of all sizes?big, middling, and small?our
friend would propably still feel a bias in favour of the large
concern, until he heard that, under this mixed settlement,
land was yearly rising in price, and that a good trade was to
be done among the settlers. Then, but not till then, he
would see the power of ? homestead settlement,? but to a
certainty he would assign a wrong reason for the success
shown. The reason he would give would be, that the pros-
perity of the district arose from property being in the hands
of people possessed of capital. In this he would be putting
the cart before the horse, for the ?capital ? so tangible to his
senses now, came into existence wholly from the interlacing
of traffic and the blending of interests produced by a favour-
able allotment of the land.
There is nothing very mysterious about this, and any one
free from prepossession may readily see that the production
of staples though undoubtedly an important source of pros-
perity is only a branch, and not the main stem of national
growth, while large accumulations of property, and fortunes
made by dealings in land and stock, are very delusive if
trusted to as proofs of general, national, and social well-
being. But our opinions on such topics are mainly formed,
like those of our friend the ? practical man,? from tangible
facts; an excellent rule, provided we do know all the facts,
but otherwise something like that culpable credulity which in
business would believe iraplicity in advertisements, sign-
boards and samples,


We have an edifying faith in success and in the columns
of figures which are believed to represent it, while everything
else is merely put down as mere theory and sentiment,
? leather and prunello.?
In the mother country, as well as in these colonies, the
wealth arising from association, spreading prosperity through
the population, is neither appreciated nor believed in. Our
kinsmen?s ideal of well-being, like our own, is confined prin-
cipally to the accumulations of great fortunes and the forming
of great estates. Papers and periodicals of the liberal school
have indeed argued against this tendency, and have
described communities elsewhere which contained neither
great proprietors nor a pauper class, where there were neither
millionaires nor vagabonds; but the English people generally
take little heed of what they look on as ? unpractical phan-
tasies.?
Here, after the stir there has been about selection, it may
seem absurd to say that the tendency is in the same direction ;
but if we listen to the views of nearly all men except actual
selectors, and if we observe the action of selection itself, we
shall see that the whole instinct and practical sense of the
people tends to large accumulations in few hands. In Vic-
toria it is notorious that the whole territory is rapidly falling
into large estates, and in this colony, if the failure of selection
has not been so complete, its success in the direction
prophesied and expected has been very trifling. In both
colonies, indeed, there have been powerful obstacles to the
success of settlement under selection, but after giving due
weight to these, there remains an unexplained barrenness of
results which we think can only be imputed to a popular
bias, or to a defect in the national character. Of these
obstacles, the first is,?that selection has not been based
on the industry natural to the country, and habitual to the
colonists, namely grazing. To found settlement on agricul-
ture, or the mere tillage of the soil, ?a pursuit here generally
disregarded as unprofitable and uncongenial, was to expect
?grapes from thorns and figs from thistles.? The second
reason for this failure was that the new tenure was an in-
vasion on the squatting leases, under which grazing, the
standard industry of the country, had been carried on for
more than a generation. Numbers of people had their means


of livelihood endangered by the new law, and moreover an
immense organization which involved our commercial and
banking systems was threatened. Many interests being thus
endangered, an active opposition was raised to selection, pro-
moted by all the propertied classes, and the result has been
what all men know. To take up a selection may be to fall
into a lawsuit and ruin ; at least, it often incurs the enmity of
a powerful and vigilant opponent, with all the business world
at his back.
These two causes might be considered sufficient to ac-
count for a blank result, but in reality from the immense
extent of country open, containing tracts as diverse as pos-
sible in value, position, and character, as well as from various
exceptional circumstances, there is always elbow-room, more
or less, to be got. The chief resistance to be encountered is
in the richest grazing country; but all the opposition that can
be brought to bear there or elsewhere though it may retard
and cripple selection in certain localities, cannot act
absolutely in stopping it.
In second-class districts, which are often best watered,
and best suited tor combined cultivation and grazing, the
opposition to be met with is much less, and in fact there is in
this kind of country so much opening favourable to successful
settlement that one is led to wonder why there is not more of
it, and why it is not better in kind. Perhaps the potent
reason may be found in the habits and character of our
population. From various causes, dating many generations
back, few of our people have either acquired or inherited the
inclination or capacity to succeed in rural life. The half-
waste homestead, the few half-starved cows and horses, the
absence of everything like regular work, or common comfort,
generally seen on selections, afford good proof that the
average British colonist makes a poor job of settling. Unlike
the men of many other European races, patient industry,
careful experiment, and wise improvement have no charm for
him. But there is a peculiar tendency, so universal among
all classes of us, that it must run in the blood. Though few
will improve, and a good many will hardly do any regular
work, still the craving for accumulation, and the scheming to
borrow and buy, are incessant. From the largest squatter to
the selector of one year?s standing, nearly every man would


like to buy up his neighbour, and a good many would pawn
their bedsteads to raise the means. The squatter wants to
sell out and go home, and he will run any risk to make a
fortune.
The selector wants to get the two or three selections
adjoining, and then he will call himself a ? squatter.?
The consequence of this craze is, that every district
shows hundreds clearing out yearly to repeat elsewhere the
same farce of debt, scheming, useless idleness, and comfort-
less waste.
In fact, we have little relish for daily work and the
profits that nature would give in due season, but we like a
scramble for property, with the prizes large and the blanks
many; and, instead of cultivating the public spirit and good
neighbourship that grow out of common interests and mutual
good will, every man necessarily becomes a Radical to those
above him, and a Tory to those below.
The leaders of thought elsewhere have by no means
overlooked the advantages of ? homestead settlement,? and
all over Europe and America the wide diffusion of property
in land is the common rule. In our mother country alone,
the half-feudal land tenure has been retained, while in Ger-
many, France, Belgium, Italy, and many other countries, the
soil has become both the popular savings-bank and the actual
home and possession of millions of families. Even in Russia,
the late emancipation of the serfs made every freed man a
landholder. The Muscovite peasant knelt down a slave, out-
lawed and disinherited, and when the Imperial Ukase was
read he arose free in blood, and owner in fee of a homestead
in the district where he was born, While the continental
Governments have thus been popularising the possession of
landed property, the tendency.in Great Britain has been in a
diametrically opposite direction. All over England and Scot-
land the large estates have been absorbing the others, small
farms have disappeared in large ones, and common and waste


lands have been acquired and added to round off the
enormous properties that now embrace whole countries.
Legislation has favoured this tendency by the laws of entail
and primogeniture, while the legal profession, biassed in
favour of the great proprietors, has managed to hamper
transfer, and befog titles in their interest, and has fairly lent
itself to obliterate all commonage and other popular rights
in the soil. At the same time, high-farming has often clubbed
three farms into one, and has substituted steam power for
human labour. So thoroughly, it is said, has the occupation
of land in England been revolutionised during the last two
hundred years, that the yeomen and peasant proprietors, who,
in the beginning of the last century greatly exceeded the
tenant farmers in number, have now disappeared, and most
of the land is in the hands of a few thousand people.
A late publication has given a different version of the
number of landowners in England. The ? Domesday Book,?
now published, it seems, makes out that there are ten times as
many proprietors of land as Mr. Stuart Mill and other writers
of the liberal school placed the number at. Statistics, of
course, must upset all estimates formed from surmise or
theory, but they require ample verification before they can
impugn a belief so widespread, and so much founded on
general observation, namely, the belief that the rural resident
proprietary of Great Britain has nearly disappeared. The
present writer can speak from personal knowledge, of one dis-
trict in the south of Scotland, and the facts there are almost
uniform, of the absorption of estates of all sizes by two or
three great houses, and of the displacement of numbers of
small tenants to make large farms. The change has been
going on for long, and is going on still. The relics and
traditions of past ages tell of the various stages of the pro-
cess. The whole of that country shows along the valleys, on
every point of strength, the remains of the old keeps and
towers of the small barons, and feu-tenants, and everywhere
through the moors and hills are the grass grown remains of
what were once farms and hamlets. In the fifteenth century
the Warden of the Marches could in a few hours, with his
beacon-lire, muster fifteen hundred horseman where now it
would be impossible to raise one-third of the number of
saddle-horses. Knight and laird in mail rode out of their


towers and keeps, and the moss-trooper got the galloway in
from the hill and took the long lance down from the chimney.
Any one may read in Scott or Froissart about this numerous
and formidable force thus raised from what we would call a
mere strip of country. (Practical common-sense people will
naturally be unable to see any connection between a question
of land tenure and what they will call fables taken from
romances and ballads ; but they may safely rest assured that
the above statements, however visionary they may appear,
actually contain a great deal more of authentic fact than most
of the reports of joint stock companies (limited), which they
read periodically, and often have cause to remember.)
The union of the Crowns brought with it days of com-
parative peace?jackmen and reivers were no longer in
demand, whole families sought new careers in the world of trade
and labour, and small estates were cut up to equip them. The
result was a change to larger estates, larger farms, and fewer
of them, and subsequently high farming and business manage-
ment led to further concentration. The reason of the change
is plain. The population is away from these Border districts
because it is not wanted. Tl\e land, like other property, is
entirely devoted to produce rental, and is necessarily managed
in the most advantageous manner for that end. Four hundred
years ago the same estates were held on condition of military
service, and for that reason they were stocked with a numerous
and able-bodied tenantry, all holding their lands on the same
tenure. Like causes have, it is said, produced analagous
results all over England and Scotland, and the statistics quoted
from the new Domesday Book, whatever new facts they may
bring to light, can hardly throw doubt on matters palpable to
the knowledge of all who care to look. The discrepancy may
perhaps be accounted for by the retention on the registers of
large numbers of fictitious and nominal tenures created to
secure votes, or of titular claims on church or mining lands.
If all such titles were made to appear as real estates, of course
the number of properties on the roll would be unduly in-
creased. But whatever the cause may be, the matter
evidently needs further explanation.
Meantime, the existing state of things in rural England
was described as follows by a writer in Fraser's Magazine not
long ago : ?? The connection between the unseating of our


peasantry, and their decline in numbers and prosperity, with a
forced and unnatural crowding of multitudes to the principal
towns, especially the metropolis, is forced daily upon our
attention. Paradoxical as it may appear, especially when the
progress in England of high-farming is considered, and form-
ing a marked contrast with the results of improved agricul-
ture in almost all other countries, it is still strictly true that the
English rural population of every grade below that of the
gentry has retrograded, not only by diminution in numbers,
but in every respect, social, political, and economic. The
labourers have rarely any connection with the soil, but a
pauper?s claim ; and they are at this moment not only the
fewest in number for the area, but absolutely the most
wretched and joyless peasantry in Europe, and the chief end
of their existence seems to form a nursery for over population
and misery crowding into our cities.?
It will, no doubt, surprise many to learn that under the
guidance of so-called ?conservative? principles, a revolution
in land tenure has thus been carried out in the mother-
country during the last two hundred years culminating in the
rapid extinction of the rural population, and the growth of
multitudes living in enforced degradation in the back slums of
the towns.
In vivid contrast to this state of things, we have
descriptions from France, Belgium, Switzerland, Lombardy,
and many other European States of the large accumulations
of national wealth and the comfortable results for the people
of a system based on the opposite policy ; and the following
remarks reported as made by Sir George Campbell in an
election address at Dysart testify to the increased political
strength and stability derived from such institutions: ?
? Many of those who feared Democracy, and who feared the
power of the people, were accustomed to hold out France
and say? ? What a terrible state of things you have got in
France. For God?s sake take care you don't come to that.?
The French had encountered great political storms, and
great political misfortunes and treason. Why they had
survived these was that they were ballasted with an immense
amount of small property widely distributed. Their whole
system had been arranged in favour of small properties and
small capital in land, and that gave the French an enormous


advantage. From the ballast and stability which they
derived from the possession of such an enormous amount of
small capital distributed among the people, they had been
able to survive political difficulty and storms which would
have overwhelmed any nation who had had less ballast of the
kind. He was inclined to believe that if in this country they
had great calamities and great misfortunes such as had
befallen the French, they should not sustain them so well.?
The readiness with which the Prussian indemnity was paid
from general contribution of the French people affords strong
proof of the wealth produced by their system, and also of the
public spirit and patriotism inherent in a people actually
living on their own soil.
Without going beyond British territory, however, we
have in the Channel Islands, with their half-French inhabitants
and institutions, a marked contrast to.the rest of the Empire
in the use of their lands, and the position of their rural
population. In the Fortnightly Review of January last an
article by Mr. F. Barham Zincke deals very fully with this
subject. A conversation in a steamer led the writer into
a comparison between the Channel Islands and the Isle of
Wight, to the following effect? The area of the Isle of
Wight is 86,810 acres, while the aggregate of the Channel
Islands is only 48,098 acres. The Census Returns of 1871
make the population of the Isle of Wight 66,219, and the
Channel Islands 89,504.
If the population of the Isle of Wight were as dense as
the Channel Islands, its population would be 161,676; while
they, if peopled at the same ratio as the Isle of Wight, would
have only 36,689 inhabitants.
? What causes this great difference, while soil, climate,
and position are so equally balanced ?
? Density of population* would be a very unsatisfactory
condition, if it resulted from contented habituation to an
insufficient or poor mode of life, in respect to food, clothing,


fuel, and housing. Of this there is no indication in the
Channel Islands. On the contrary, all that one sees in them
speaks of sufficiency, ease, and prosperity throughout all
classes. The number of substantial houses in theenvirms
of their two towns surprises one who calls to mind the
smallness of the islands of which they are the'capitals. In
the country parishes too, good houses abound. One
accustomed to the uninhabited look of so large a proportion
of the rural parishes in England wonders how the possessors
of so many good houses as he sees here can find the means to
live in them. So much for the better class of houses. The
same is observable with respect to the houses of the
peasantry and of the artisans. A month?s search for some-
thing of the mean and dilapidated kind not unknown among
ourselves was quite unsuccessful. I went into several
cottages, all of which I found well built, roomy enough, and
in good repair. This was very remarkable in the houses of
the peasantry. As to the clothing of the inmates, I nowhere
saw the dirt and rags which so frequently shock us in
England, as signs both of actual pressing want and of the
decay or extinction of self-respect. Bnt indications of tho
well-to-do condition of the people are presented on every
side. The churches I saw were large for the acreage of their
respective parishes?those of Jersey average about 2300
acres, and the buildings were kept so well that one could not
but remark their dimensions and condition. The church-
yards tell the same tale, and contain an unusual proportion of
solid tombs and massive tombstones. It is plain that there
are few or none in those islands obliged to bury their dead in
unnamed graves.
? In accord with the testimony of the churches, is that
offered by the village schools, and the roads in their excellent
condition, and the dressiness of the roadside margins. These
consist of stone walls, or well-trimmed hedges, or earth
banks upon, or beside which, are rows of trees, all of which,
whether fruit-bearing or timber trees, are carefully tended.
This conveys a more pleasing impression to the mind than
even to the eye, for it shows that every cultivator loves, and is
proud of his land.
?Another and most satisfactory indication of the well-
founded prosperity of these islands is, that notwithstanding


the density of their population, they are but very slightly
afflicted with the plague of pauperism, and as for crime, they
have not found it necessary to maintain a police force,
although their lower class of labour is largely provided by
immigration from Ireland, England, and France.
? I suppose this extraneous element, as they say in the
States ? works itself sweet ? when it comes into contact with
new conditions. Where all may hope, industry and thrift
will be general, and they go a long way towards preventing
pauperism and diminishing crime.
? The wealth that has been accumulated in these islands
would surprise those who are familiar only with the accumu-
lations of capital as in England. Guernsey, the whole area
being only 16.000 acres, is now spending �16,000 in building
a covered market for fruit and vegetables. It has also carried
a street across the town to St. Peter?s Port, at a cost of
�?lo,ooo. But its great glory is its noble harbour, upon which
has recently been expended �285,000. All these works were
carried out with island money only. Of the expenditure on
the harbour there has already been repaid �65,000, and the
remainder of the original outlay is being cleared off at the
rate of �l5OO a year. No one can see without surprise the
massiveness of the enclosing walls of this harbour and the
amplitude of space on the top of them for quays, carriage
roads, and foot ways. I cannot believe that such works would
have been attempted by an equal population in the United
Kingdom ; and to go back to our original comparison, the
Isle of Wight is not inhabited, as to find any need for, and if
it needed, would not find the means among its present
inhabitants for constructing one such harbour, but in the
islands we have two such, and a third in construction.
? The main cause of all this well-founded prosperity is
the wide diffusion of property in land. The land is in the
possession of thousands of families. Its produce either
goes in improving the condition of the residents, in permanent
improvement of the soil, or for some form of investment,
such as public works. Every few acres represents both a
factory for the creation of wealth and a reservoir for its
accumulation. On a great scale this is what we see in
France, and it is what accounts for the rapidly growing
wealth of Switzerland. The island of Alderney, an area of


only 1962 acres, regularly exports milking cows to England.
Six cows and heifers were exported in the steam-tug in which
I left the island. The population is over 2000, and large
numbers of cows are constantly exported at prices ranging
from �lO to �\ 2o. If all these 1962 acres had been in two or
three farms, we would have heard very little about Alderney
cows in England, In J873 Jersey sent to London
worth of early potatoes, and Guernsey 50 tons of grapes
grown under glass. Without the division of land obtaining
in these islands there would be neither vineries under glass
nor early potatoes. No tenant farmers, whether on a large
or small scale, could, through hired labour, produce such
astonishing results.?
Mr. Zincke further adduces the following attestation as
to the value of small proprietors.
? It was this class that saved France from the Commune,
as well as enabled her to bear the burdens and to recover so
rapidly from the appalling catastrophe of her late war. It is
the same class that is saving the cities of the United-States
from the rabble of Europe, and which lately produced the
mighty military force for her defence against the Slave
Confederacy. The foundations of the strength and patriotism
of Prussia are laid in Stein?s reform of her Land Laws,
acting towards the creation of a large class of small
proprietors. Had Great Britain been a Continental Power,
military considerations alone would have forced her policy in
the same direction.?
From such accounts we may see the wonderful results in
national wealth and power of ? homestead settlement? on
freeholds by an industrious and domesticated population,
these communities being as completely without the large
capitalist and great proprietor as they are free from the
loafer or tramp. A deal of this is so contrary to our ordinary
views on such subjects that it reads like a fable, or like a
description of life in another planet. The whole instincts of
experience and respectability here point towards large
individual accumulations. Most of us look upon property as
a sacred preserve, a close interest that should be kept for a
few persons qualified by divine right and the favour of the
bank, and we hardly ever realize the fact that wealth can
exist in any other form but in that of large fortunes. With our


population as they are, divorced for many generations from
the possession of land, and consequently without that
experience of rural life, which is the priceless heritage of a
peasant people, it is not to be expected that they should be
able to do what is daily done by the people of Jersey, France,
or Switzerland.
Moreover, in addition to this hereditary disadvantage,
our whole system is opposed to homestead settlement of a
good and permanent character taking root. Before we can
see its growth among us, we must learn first to reconcile our
feuds, to harmonize our standard industry with the interests
of population, and displace our present absurd and vicious
land-scramble by sensible administration. Whether designedly
or not, the goal of all our strivings seems to be towards the
two types of the millionaire squatter and the pauper selector.
Each surge and reflux of the pastoral tide leaves behind
bigger stations, fewer of them, absenteeism and monopoly
more strongly marked, while the selector, the only repre-
sentative of settlement that we cultivate becomes more
hemmed in a corner, and more than ever the object of con-
tempt to all well-to-do people.
Opinions among us no doubt differ as to the possibility
of entering upon a better policy, still until the important
principle to be seen practically exemplified in the countries
mentioned, has been in one shape or another realized here,
our colonisation must be, to a large extent, a failure. As
things are, we can hardly have a really national population,
and our prosperity will be like that of Jamaica or Hongkong,
hinging on the chances of commerce and speculation,
fluctuating and transitory, not of that kind which has founded
strong communities and evoked solid wealth on the fens of
Holland and the slopes of the Alps. A shrewd American,
lately visiting Melbourne, said that it was a fine city with
nothing behind it, and the description applies equally well to
Sydney.
The tendency of events at present is all in favour of the
growth of a system resulting in centralised wealth and
depopulation. When movements nowin progress in Riverina
have accomplished their end, these much-coveted pastures
will present the aspect of the huge depopulated estates of
Rome in her downfall, the Latifundia of her courtiers, ? over


which a hawk could hardly fly without resting his wing,? the
only exceptions appearing in odd selectors at intervals,
waiting only to be bought out.
This prospect, though it may appear a desirable consum-
mation to many from their one-sided view, must show to any
unbiassed onlooker, simply as a melancholy travesty. These
magnificent valleys and plains that might, differently dealt
with, support ten thousands of families, will probably, when
finally secured against selection, drop into the hands of
perhaps a couple of hundred proprietors, or likely fewer.
They, when all encumbrances have been got rid of, will
likely become absentees; every run will be improved so as to
be managed with the minimum of labour; population there
will be none ; each overseer will keep a couple of boundary
riders, and a few hundred hands on wages will be employed
making money for remittance abroad, on an area of country
that might rear a nation in strength and plenty.
Such is likely to be, to a large extent, the final result ot
our combined method of squatting and selection. The
pastures were first deliberately handed over to the squatters,
and law, custom, and vested interests intrenched them in
possession. The intrenchment was stormed, and the breach
was filled with the slain, both squatters and selectors, and the
money power stepped in and took possession with the results
now apparent. Unfortunately, we have as yet shown our-
selves unable to construct a better system. The parting with
the grazing title at first was a piece of incredible indiscretion
that could only have happened under a Government
impenetrably ignorant or fast asleep, while selection in its
senseless fury was little better than legalised destruction ! It
was the legislation that might be expected from escaped
galley-slaves, but appears now utterly incomprehensible if
considered as the work of free educated men dealing with the
national industry.
Notwithstanding this hardly-earned experience, it is
doubtful yet whether opinion in New South Wales has
advanced a step beyond the choice between the two opposing
creeds of monopoly and spoliation. Our politicians find
bread and easy living in throwing their votes into the balance
between the two interests, and Government has for long
abandoned its legitimate duty of regulating settlement. The


playing of one class against another has enlarged the prizes
of patronage and office, and the land-scramble, which has
been carefully nursed into life, is filling the public Treasury to
overflowing.
From all quarters the key-note of our orators sounds like
a variation of that old Roman cry that tickled the ears of the
populace on the Tiber, ? Panem et circenses.? Billets and con-
tracts are more prized than farms and homesteads, and the
approved use of our inland territory seems to be the promoting
of jobbery and lavish expenditure.
This kind of thing can never produce homestead settle-
ment like that of the Channel Islands, or a vigorous national
life and strong military system of defence, such as are to be
seen in Switzerland. The riches of our large towns, and the
ostentatious display of our ? wealthy classes,? will prove but
the outward varnish of a hollow shell, powerless to resist
pressure, whether of foreign hostility or of commercial
reaction. When one or the other approaches, then will be the
time, if not too late, to search and try our foundations.
Meantime few will acknowledge, what is nevertheless a fact,
that we are performing a farce in colonising that might well
provoke the derision of the old pioneers. Our squatting
enterprise has been largely metamorphosed into land-sharking
and stock-jobbing ; while our commercial acumen seems to
find its favorite field in kiteflying and in the trade of
insolvency.
Sham and shoddy are poor substitutes for brain and
muscle. Neither our absentee capitalists nor our well-peopled
slums and gutters will provide for the day of need the revenue
to carry on government after the land surplus has collapsed ;
nor will they provide for the day of danger the battalions that
should rise along our coasts, or the horsemen that should
swarm from every inland plain.


GRAZING i PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE.
No. 1.
For some time after the arrival of the First Fleet it does not
seem to have occurred to any one that the thin patchy grass
found growing under the turpentines, oaks, and banksias near
Botany Bay could be turned to any use, but by the year 1795,
when the settlement was seven years old, things had taken a
step forward. The Government had come into possession of
live stock, the original animals being chiefly chance cattle
brought from the Cape and India and left by the shipping.
These cattle were at first herded on the present site of
Newtown and Cook?s River by men wearing the Government
livery. These primitive stockmen had no horses. The writer
of this paper saw, over twenty years ago, a wiry old exile, who
it was said, at middle age, could give many a runner a distance
and beat him, and who for a half-pound of tobacco, in fair race,
had run clean out of sight of a mob of blacks and he got his
training and wind following the Government cows at Grose
Farm in his youth.
But the cross-bred offspring of Cape bulls and hump-
backed Bengal cows proved intractable, wild, and fleet-footed ;
and one fine morning, in spite of their keepers? best, they
broke camp, scattered, and were lost like a burst bag of peas.
The herdsmen came in nightly broken down and weary, even
their black allies could not make out a straight trail from a
stampede that seemed to go in every direction, and after
following perplexing tracks day by day till time was up, they
turned in to muster without having seen a tail. Discipline
was exacting, and at times proof against explanation or excuse,
and no man dared to stay out beyond hours.
But a month or two later, a youth who had the bushman
and hunter bred in him?most likely he was paying the
penalty for night-pouching in ? famous Soomersetsh.ere,? or
elsewhere ?got beyond bounds and dropped on a tea-tree


gully, now called Haslem?s Creek, and there he came on the
cattle tracks, all coming together till they trended in one
direction?straight south-west.
? A southerly wind, a cloudy sky, ? and a pack on a good
lying scent will put life and pluck at times even into a seedy
city man, and a good cattle-track leading to the gods know
where, through unknown grass and forest, is a bait for any
man, whether on horse or foot, who may have the blood of
Nimrod in his veins. Ahead no doubt there was the unknown
bush, no food, perhaps no water, as likely as not the wild
blacks prowling about, and our rambler on foot, unarmed.
?Bosh! Who?s afraid? Follow the track and chance-the
ducks.? And so our poacher did?through the Dog Trap
scrub?skirting George?s River?over many an undulation of
ironbark and grass, out of the sandstone and into red volcanic
soil, with open forest, and there at his feet was a broad stream
running fresh and silvery northward, mid hedges of emerald
casuarina ; and on the sloping banks were the lost cattle, if
not fat, sleek and contented, stretching along the river from
right to left, while from under many a myrtle bush a tottering
calf staggered up and ba?ad for his parent. A shocking lot
they were, ?colours magpie and tiger-streaked, with every
intermediate shade of rusty black and yello\y, narrow as
greyhounds, with hocks like deer and shoulders like giraffes.
Yet, though a dozen of them would hardly have filled a cask
with tallow, they were still the ancestors of the cattle we see
every year at Redfern, and they had what many of the last
have not ?they had foot andjiardihood.
So our poacher came back with his news, his absence was
condoned, and he was most likely ordered a pint of rum from
the Ordnance stores as a recompense for eminent services.
The rambling herd was kept on the new feeding ground,
but was by degrees broken up and distributed. Cows were
lent to the farmers at Seven Hills. The almanac tells of
names familiar to us yet, being charged in 1805 at the rate of
per head, to be paid in case of loss, for heifers of the
third cross, perhaps coming a little nearer the cow of to-day
in figure, but still with the hump on the shoulder and the lithe
legginess of the Eastern progenitors ; and very well pleased
all the good folks at Seven Hills were to get them.?And this
was the way grazing began in Australia.


Other ten years solved the sheep problem. The first
flock, the germ of our modern wealth, was kept at Camden,
near the slopes where the lost cattle were found. The merino
must have thriven much better during the early years than of
late, as that breed was without doubt kept with great profit
on coast country where sheep of the same class do no good
now. It may be that forty years of close shepherding, dogging,
and folding, which they had with little exception, has
weakened their constitution ; and there is another fact that
helps to explain the falling-off. It is unquestionable that the
primitive grasses in their freshness were more invigorating
than they have been since overstocking coarsened the pasture
and mixed it with weeds. From that and other favorable
circumstances, nearly all who had sheep at first did well.
Stocks were small, and were carefully looked after, and there
was elbow-room as yet for numberless small stations. At first,
land was allotted according to one uniform method, and that
was the freehold grant, varying in size from forty acres up to
thousands. One very common size was 640 acres, the same
as our maximum selection area, but no free selection was
allowed then l . A preliminary survey guided the distribution
of the soil, and, as is to be seen to-day, the grants dotted the
frontages to the rivers and creeks with short intervals between,
while the unoccupied space, with all the back country, remained
open on easy terms for grazing. The cottage or hut was in
the centre of the grant, with a cleared paddock, large or small,
under the plough on one side ; and on the other side appeared
the hurdles, where the flock of sheep, small in number, but
highly prized, was at night folded within sight of the door.
As immigrants of good repute arrived, and as others duly
approved gained the recognition of the authorities, these grants
spread in all directions, numerous and thriving?a wholesome
growth that produced both wealth and population,?and this
was the first pastoral age.
In many scores of instances the owners of these small
grants are now represented by descendants who own great runs
and large stocks; who now have wealth and social station,
not unworthily held ; but these small freeholds and cottage
homesteads held more than the fortunes of a few successful
families. In them the germ of a national life was planted,
and under these homely roofs were nurtured the solid virtues


of thrift, industry, and honesty, which produce and attend the
rise of races and of nations. During the last few years
hundreds of respectable families, so like these original settlers
that no person could see any difference, have
been trying to get, according to law, just such farms out of
the huge western and southern runs held by the representa-
tives of these same original selectors, but they have been
easily routed and beaten off by the use of Volunteer Land
Orders, camp-oven improvements, and other lawful defensive
measures.
At the same time, it is only the even-down truth to admit
that if our modern squatters had not defended their tenure by
every legal and pllegal wile, the land-sharks, hatched by the
Act of 1861, a very different sort of persons from those whose
cause we advocate, would have peeled and flayed them flesh
and fell.
There cannot be a more cogent proof, if any were wanted,
of the vice of our present land law ; and we leave these facts
without comment for the consideration of every man who has
either education or conscience.
.The main fact that accounts for the prosperity of this
valuable class of settlers was that they began on the firm
foundation of freehold homesteads that cost nothing, with fair
elbow room for their stock around.
From these starting points, they spread vigorous and
ever growing, west, south, and north, still in search of fresh
pastures ; and on seeing now the result of their work with its
wide-spread advantage to the community, we can only regret
that the system has not come down to the present day, for in
it were combined the benefits of a sound grazing system, with
the substantial and durable character of ? Homestead settle-
ment.?
But this primitive pastoral age did not last long. ? A king
arose who knew not Joseph,? or, in other words, land-policy
shifted, and finally was revolutionised.
The demon of discord probably saw with disgust that


things were going on in a wholesome way, and in the official
region there is always latent a perverse instinct, easily
prompted, which, though often blind to glaring and notorious
facts, will never when alive to the opportunity, leave well alone.
People were doing well, occupying sterile country that no
one would have looked at some years before.
? Then why should they not be made pay for the land ??
This seemed unanswerable; so the grants were issued no
more. Much better to kill the goose than let anybody get the
eggs without the customery red tape.
At this stage of transition there appeared on the scene
the celebrated Wakefield theory?a scheme of colonisation
much lauded by its admirers, and greatly run down by its
opponents. The reasons both for its laudation and for the
criticism it has met with, we think, may readily be explained
by our recent experience.
The following extract from * ? Bush Essays,? by this
writer, refers to the origin and character of the scheme :
Mr. Gibbon Wakefield had some years before visited this part of the
world, and on his return to England he published certain views which he had
formed, and gained the ear of the official circle. He advocated colonisation
< in mass,? plausibly arguing that the power of mutual support was lost by the
dispersion of the settlers. Tested solely by the moral of the bundle of sticks,
and ignoring all surrounding facts, no doubt he was right. The English
population was, according to this theory, to be moved to their new homes in
compact segments, each to be composed of the various classes in due propor-
tion, according to English ideas, and each individual was to fill the same rela-
tive position as in the old country. It was assumed that with the general
success of the scheme each person would benefit in his degree, and that before
their collective power all obstacles would speedily yield.
? Thus prosperous, because well regulated colonies would be founded
ready made and perfect from the first, and the security and comfort offered by
these well-balanced English communities would keep the members of all
grades in willing union, and save them from the evils of dispersion. These
views met with great favour, and had been carried into practical form in the
year 1834 by the foundation of the colony of South Australia.
? Strongly supported by Government, this new settlement attracted many
emigrants. Some took large sums of money with them, and there seemed
every prospect of a successful issue to the attempt.
? A town was to be built as the nucleus, and around it the settlers were to
cluster. The land was to be laid out in town, surburban, and country lots, and
each man was at once to step into his special occupation, agriculture being the

Black, Edinburgh.


main supporting industry. Grazing was not in the programme, as that occu-
pation led to dispersion. It is well to note the origin of this settlement, com-
pletely opposite as it was in constitution to anything yet tried in the colonies,
as the principles then put in shape have influenced the land legislation of all
the colonies up to a recent date, whether for good or otherwise.
? The key-stone of the plan was a high price for land, called by the pro-
moter a ?sufficient price,? and a ?hired labour price,? the lowest rate being �\
per acre. This price, it was supposed, would establish a distinct class of pro-
prietors, and the funds produced by the sale were to be used in importing labor.
Thus everything was provided for, and fixed by rule and square.
? What took place was this. As ship after ship reached the shores of
Adelaide, a scene of busy traffic ensued, which looked to the unthinking new-
comers like an established commerce, and seemed to confirm the soundness of
the ? concentration? theory. It appeared to them that the town, the heart of
the settlement, must certainly become the focus of wealth as well as of popu-
lation, therefore all strove to possess property near this coveted centre. Public
money was spent profusely, and private capitalists eagerly rushed into specula-
tion and thus a thriving settlement in appearance was established. But after
all, for what they were doing they need have gone no further than the banks
of the Thames. When the allotment of the town lands began, the knowing
ones fixed on the best sites for stores and public-houses ; high premiums were
readily paid for choice lots, and almost before a building was up, land-jobbing
began.
?Then ensued one of those gambling disorders which occur so often in
the Old World, but this time remarkable as breaking out, not in the crowded
streets of old commercial cities, but on the verge of a wilderness of grassy
plains and forests, and the men who had gone forth to subdue and reclaim
with axe and plough were turned into jobbers and thimble-riggers. All the
people of the settlement collected on the site of the future city, and did
nothing but deal in land and live by their wits. These doings did not escape
the notice of the speculators and sharpers of the neighboring colony, and the
manifest inclination of the ? new chums? (as the immigrants were called in
prisoner slang) for gambling and fast living gave these birds of prey a fine
opening, so they came and joined in the game, knowing that, whatever hap-
pened, something would stick to their fingers. The arrival of every new ship
added fuel to the flame, and each emigrant only feared that he might be too
late for the prizes. The soil gave proof on its surface of the wealth which had
been brought to light, but it was not the produce of husbandry ; on all sides
acres of empty bottles told of the Sydney brandy and champagne with which
the colonists had cheered their labours, and as far as the eye could reach
stood lines of surveyors? posts, like troops in open order, marking off the
allotments which were the staples of trade. The town was partly built, but
this was the only work done ; agricultural labor was indefinitely postponed in
favor of the speedier process of money-making which had been found out. He
who had an acre divided it into four, -and sold each lot for more than the whole
cost. He who had ten acres was a millionaire, and these capitalists hugged
themselves over their land-scrip, and blessed Mr. Wakefield for bringing them
to the promised land.


? But all bubbles must burst some time. At the end of two years Adelaide
was half empty. The money was all spent, and the land and buildings belonged
to the money-lenders and grog-sellers. Many returned to England without
having touched work of any kind, and the scheme had either vanished with the
mis-spent money, or had yet to be started. Those who could not get away
had to spread over the country and see how they could earn a living.
? One of the erroneous opinions current is, that the Wakefield system of
colonisation has been successful, and the growth of South Australia and several
of the New Zealand settlements is pointed to as proof of the fact. But by looking
at what actually transpired, it is evident that the only success which can be
shown is that numbers of people were brought to certain places where thriving
communities are found now.
? It will be seen invariably that the schemes under which the people
were to live have been found insufficient when tested by the rude necessities
of a new country, and that they have gone to pieces under the pressure ?two
stringent facts bearing heavily upon them, namely, the necessity for finding a
living at once for the emigrants, and the attractions of the unoccupied wilder-
? Thus, the era of gambling having passed in Adelaide, all left who had
the means to get away, to escape starvation, and those who were tied to the
place scattered over the country, and took to such pursuits as would enable
them to live. Many got employed in squatting in the back country with stock
which came from New South Wales, some took to farming in the rich lands on
the coast, and others were employed on the famous copper mines afterwards
found. In the same way in New Zealand people got on after a time, by
following such occupations as were practicable in that country, but it was by
the dispersion and not by the concentration of the colonists that the resources
now supporting them were found out.
? Therefore it is absurd to credit the Wakefield system with results which
have proceeded, not from the working of that system, but from its systematic
violation ; and, moreover, greater results have been attained at less cost in
colonies which grew entirely from a loose system of grazing and unrestricted
gold digging?namely, Victoria and Queensland.
? The legacy which all Australia has inherited from this gift of the Colo-
nial Office has been a high price for land, prohibitive of profitable occupation,
and a stinted and jealous spirit in its disposal. It is not unfair also to attri-
bute to this source the pernicious practice of land-jobbing, which has swept
like a disease over Australia, and has blighted many a promising settlement;
for the comedy or rather tragedy enacted at Adelaide has since been repeated,
ludicrous in appearance to an onlooker, but fraught with ruin to many a house-
hold.?
The reason why this theory has been so much approved
was that it professed to devote the proceeds of land sales to
bringing out immigrants. The price put on the land was high,
the minimum rate being �1 per acre, but it was said, plausibly
enough, that if the whole proceeds of sales were devoted to
introducing labor, and, more important still, that invaluable


accessory?a permanent population, the land could not be
considered dear.
The extract quoted above shows how the? system worked
on new ground. As proving after the lapse of forty years
how utterly unpractical the theory has turned out in settling
population, it may not be out of place to offer a comparison
between South Australia, the chosen field of the Wakefield
system, and Queensland, which has grown almost without
system at all.
South Australia was founded in 1834, and its population
by last returns was 206,000. Queensland became a colony
with some 20,000 inhabitants in 1859, and it numbers already
172,000. At this rate of increase, unless new elements put in
an appearance, in a few years will be a much
more powerful community than South Australia.
So much for the effect of the Wakefield scheme in leading
to the permanent settlement of population. So far as the con-
centration theory is concerned, that has uniformly been the
greatest failure of all. And as to the produce of land sales
being devoted to immigration, that is long out of date, both
here and elsewhere. Almost the only relic we retain of the
system is the price of one pound per acre ?the milestone in
our track which marks the commencement of land-sharking
and the end of wholesome settlement.
So far as New South Wales was concerned, the adoption
of the principle effectually stifled the colonisation which was
taking root. The homestead principle, the key of the original
method, was abandoned. No one now but speculators and
land-sharks bought land. But no blundering or perversity
could suppress the growth that had commenced ; if checked
on one side it broke out on another. It might be onesided or
irregular, but out it had to come.
Progress was thus perforce driven into one groove, and
every man who had any push in him put all he had into live-
stock and joined in a scramble for the grass, the weaker, of
course, going to the wall.
This was the beginning of the second grazing era. The
flocks and herds could now be counted by tens of thousands ;
pioneering was pushing out the frontier rapidly, but the stock-
owners were without recognition or tenure. They were true
Ishmaelites?every man did what seemed best in his own eyes,
and for the first time they called themselves ? Squatters.?


At this stage, from the increase of the sheep and cattle,
and the events arising therefrom, matters had got far beyond
the supervision or control of Government. Since the aban-
donment of the system of grants, about the year 1830, land
administration had been based upon theories that had no con-
nection whatever with the facts to be seen daily occurring in
the colony. While the first squatters were taking their stock
on to the Namoi and Murrumbidgee, the Government, ap-
parently heedless of these doings, was trying to adapt Mr.
Gibbon Wakefield?s theories to the settlement of the country,
with the only direct result of establishing land-sharking as an
institution. It is important to mark how the abandonment
of the first plan of settlement, followed by the obstructive
action of the Wakefield scheme, forced all the youth and
energy of the colony, both native and imported, into squatting,
a groove that had opened from the pressure of natural growth.
Even as the Atlantic disregarded both the sceptre of Canute
and the broom of Mrs. Partington, so the grass grew, the stock
increased, and their owners followed them from river to river
and from plain to plain, treating with equal derision Mr. Wake-
field?s theory of concentration and the Governor?s meddling
rules and regulations.
But there was a zeal and vigilance in the Government of
Sir George Gipps that would willingly leave no corner of the
territory to the wholesome action of official neglect. The last
attempt at homestead settlement had been stamped out and
extinguished by 20s. per acre and the land-sharks, and now
with perverse fidelity, executive wisdom roused itself to take
cognisance of this squatting growth, and to see whether its
incomings and outgoings could not be narrowed, or at least
its possessions assessed and mulcted.
The last alternative was by no means the choice of the
Governor and his school. According to them it would have
been far preferable to stop squatting by fiat ; but with the
open frontier around of some thousand miles in length, control
was physically impossible, and, to their grief, they had to
admit that squatting was one form of colonial growth that
could not be stifled by official meddling.
The only alternative that appeared open was to make


the squatters pay through the nose, [so the Governor gave
notice that he was going to charge them � 1 per acre for their
runs, so much land on each run to be paid for every year.
There is little doubt that his Excellency was as much
staggered at what followed as if a shell had dropped on his
breakfast-table at Government House. New South Wales
was not the same place in 1840 as it had been forty years
before. The free element was much stronger, and a large
proportion of that, with much of the youth and enterprise of
the colony, was to be found in the squatting ranks. More-
over, there were among the squatters, in dozens, men who,
by connection in the mother country, were not ? nobodies.?
They had interest among public men and in influential circles,
and they were neither slack nor obtuse in using the advantage.
They had something to say, and they knew well how to say
it. Their case was in reality a good one. If they had sub-
mitted to Sir George?s exactions, most likely he would never
have halted while they had wool or hides to sell. Every
levy extorted would have been considered proof that they
could stand a little more squeezing.
It was reasonable and just that their claims found favor
with the Imperial Government, and it was fpr the public in-
terest that they should get protection in their occupation.
They got that indeed, but they got a great deal more besides
that they never could have expected, and how or why the
advisers of the Crown on slight and one-sided evidence could
establish such a tenure as that comprised in the ? Orders in
Council? must remain an enigma.
All that the squatting body really needed was protection
against Sir George Gipps?a simple muzzle on his Excellency
?so that he could not, in one of his fits of executive energy,
hunt their stock off the grass or flay them with fines and
amercements. Instead of that they got leases of their runs
or any other runs they might apply for, the country to be
described by themselves, indefinitely renewable according to
their version, transferable, and unrestricted as to extent. In
fact, the ? Orders in Council? read as if the lands were abso-
lutely given away, and indeed this was believed at the time.
The great squatter of the day, Mr. Boyd, said, ? As long as I
choose to pay the annual fee, these lands are to me and mine
a freehold for ever.?


The consequence of this soon appeared, and we might
feel inclined to point to it as a specimen of Crown colony
government, if it were not that blunders quite as great and
injustices just as baneful have been deliberately passed into
law by the assembled wisdom of our popular Parliament.
No man being restricted as to the quantity of land he
could apply for, it was as easy to tender for twenty runs as
for one ; and, after a short experience of the law, it came to
be seen that the unstocked lands, the public pastures, were
turned into stock-jobbers? scrip, that could be bought and
sold, pawned and pledged, and huge tracks of fine country,
that under the first system of settlement might have sup-
ported hundreds of families, were now held against allcomers
by owners who, as likely as not had never seen them, by
young clerks in the Civil Service, tendering from the maps
sent in by commissioners, and by wine merchants and bill
discounters who had taken filled up tenders (cribbed from
official data) in liquidation of private debts.
Accepted tenders for runs were as saleable as leases, and
formed perfect titles to the buyers. He who bought, even
more than he who sold, was prepared to maintain his right
indefeasible and for ever to every inch of the two or three
hundred thousand acres for which he had given his �2OOO
cheque. Words are utterly wanting to show adequately the
vice and imbecility of such a system. If the modern squat-
ting interest has proved itself to be hostile to national growth,
how could it be otherwise, derived as it is from such a germ ?
Many excellent men, at the present day, claim on conserva-
tive grounds, that they are defending the solid interests of the
country when they stand up for the squatting tenure, as con-
stituted by law ; as if that were the only possible arrange-
ment for using our pastures. We think a very slight con-
sideration of the matter would show where the merits lie, at
least to any people whose thoughts can rise above the con-
tents of a shop-till.
Above all, we would like to put the problem in a certain
light before some of our friends who have benefited, perhaps
as much as any body of men, by the existing system ?we
mean the descendants of the original freehold settlers. Let
them answer the following question ;?? If the colony had
begun with the squatting system, how many of you, the re-


presentatives of the original colonists, would now have had
any property at all ?? Let us take two or three familiar corners
of the country for illustration in finding the answer. Assu-
ming the runs to have been of fair size, as is common in new
country, there would have been only one station above Cam-
den, covering the whole of the Nepean watershed. There
would have been another covering all Sutton Forest, extend-
ing to the Shoalhaven and going to Paddy?s River, and there
would have been a third between Paddy?s River and Mulwar-
ree Ponds. On the Macquarie, all the river on both sides
would have been one run from the head of Fish River to Mount
Pleasant, and there would have been five or six stations on
the Hunter, the Paterson forming one second-class one.
Moreover, if we assume that the same forces of finance and
concentration arose here that are working Victoria into the
names of a dozen or two of landholders?and that is by no
means a wild supposition?where then would have been the
openings for small men or beginners ? Properties on the
other hand under such pressure would always be getting larger
and fewer?and all would be working naturally into the hands
of the few merchants and capitalists of the day. This is no
vain fancy. Visit our Southern and Western districts, and
there you will see country richer by far than any that we have
named, held just in such large tracts?towards the north often
much larger?unpopulated, settlement barred, and the neces-
sities of the banks, when the periodical pinch comes, always
tending to club stations together, or to throw them into cer-
tain hands. The squatting system, if it had existed fifty years
ago certainly would have caused the same state of things in
the old districts.
If this system, then, had always been in vogue?if we had
begun with squatting-leases and run-jobbing, where would
have been our settled districts, the backbone of our permanent
wealth and population, the healthful scene of our family life,
and the growing germ of our national strength ? It would need
a hardy squatter to say that it would be better in a national
sense to have the country on the Hunter and Upper Mac-
quarie occupied in the same way as that about Urana and
Hay; to exchange the robust rural communities of Bathurst
and the Hunter for the slender, though money-making, popu-
lations consisting of three or four millionaires and two or three


scores of publicans, land-sharks, and others to be found about
these Southern townships.
There is a fact in this worth pointing out, and that can-
not be too often recurred to. The existence side by side at
the present day of two methods of colonisation, radically op-
posite in their tendency, suggests considerations the reverse
of those doctrines of finality maintained by sticklers for things
as they are. The more we consider the contrast thus pre-
sented, the more hopeful will appear the yet untapped possi-
bilities of Australian settlement, and the conviction will come
home to us that the future destinies of the colony are not to
be measured or interpreted either through half understood
theories of rain-fall, or by the hackneyed platitudes of the
money-market.
The progress from the early days of grazing up to to-day
is marked by two prominent events, with a well-defined inter-
val between. These events are the gold discovery in 1851
and the passing of the Alienation Law of 1861, commonly
called the Free Selection Act. Before 1851, prices, both of
wool and stock, were low, and the principle which ruled the
management of stations looked more for success to close
economy than to enterprise or experiment. A very common
stock of sheep then was 8000 to 10,000. 20,000 was unusually
large?it was thought more of then than 100,000 is now. The
flocks ranged in number from 800 to 1200, according to the
openness of the country. Two shepherds and a hutkeeper
looked after 2000 sheep. The shepherd kept his flock at a
sharp walk most of the day, sometimes with a dog on each
side ; towards mid-day they got to the water-hole, where they
drank and camped, and by evening they had trotted back to
the fold. The hutkeeper shifted the hurdles, cooked damper
of a hard conqrete character ?sometimes employed his leisure
in making stockwhips and cabbage-tree hats, and at times he
was supposed to watch the sheep at night. At sundown he
was always on the alert to see that the home-coming flocks


did not get boxed. The wages were about 7s. per week each,
with a certain ration. Those who did not occupy their solitary
hours by some work went mad from the inane dreariness of the
daily routine ; but the oasis to which they looked forward to
brighten existence, (for their animated condition could hardly
be called human life,) was the annual or biennial spree, when
all their earnings left their pockets in payment for a week?s
drunken delirium, produced by the very vilest of adulterated
liquor.
It was some years before the stimulus of better markets
and increasing population produced by the diggings affected
the value of stock. The change took place in 1854, and was
accompanied by a sudden rise in the value of wool in Europe.
This rise led to much speculation in stock and stations.
The Banks were full of the produce of the Goldfields, and the
Directors took advantage of the opening to lay out their money.
Squatting was no longer a dead-and-alive hand-to-mouth
game. Dry runs with cull sheep could be sold at 20s. per
head, and many of the old squatters who used at one time to
say seriously, that ?they kept their stations simply as stewards
for the working men,? sold out and left the colony with good
round sums. The new buyers at these prices seldom extri-
cated themselves from debt, except down in the rich Riverina
country. Labour was now scarce, and though prices of fat
stock and wool were good, it was, at times, impossible to get
shepherds. Some squatters fairly broke down, others struggled
hard to make work do where management failed, and a few,
whose heads were screwed on the right way, began to think
how shepherds could be done without. The hutkeeper had
disappeared already in the disorder of the times, and now his
mate was likely to follow. The shepherd, instead of getting
7s, per week for running after 800 sheep, now shepherded and
watched, single-handed, 2000, and got 30s. to 40s, Of course
he had to give them a spread, the trotting system was done
with. All he could do, without starving them, was to let them
go and keep round them, giving notice at once if a mob ap-
peared short. In reality, the squatter, or manager, was the
man who did most of the shepherding. His horse was up
at daybreak, and he was off with a bag of baits slung at his
croup and a colley after him. Both mind and body were all
the week on the strain. The only relief was in the change


from one form of disaster to another. The flock at Sandy
Creek was split up and one half lost; they had no sooner been
got back than it was discovered that the wether flock at Oakey
was half ewes. How they had got boxed no one knew ; not
only were they ewes, but they were lambing fast, revealing
thereby that this was not the first mess they had got into.
However, there was one compensating fact in all this dis-
order, thaj; appeared again and again so unexpectedly as fairly
to rout and set at nought all the old saws and dogmas of
colonial experience. It was this?the sheep were positively
doing better than ever they did. The loss and decrease were
of course greater than in the palmy days of shepherding, but
in condition and fleece, the more they were lost, the more
they were let alone, the more they were out of yards and
hurdles, the better they became.
There were some squatters who could see nothing in this
but that the world was coming to an end, and the country was
going to the devil. But there were others who had seen sheep
going leg-free, shifting for themselves on the skirts of the
Grampians and the heathery hills of Nithsdale, and there
seemed to them no obstacle to the sheep doing the same here,
provided the dingo could be persuaded to eat strychnine.
The MacLeods first turned out sheep in Gippsland, and
kept them like cattle. One experiment led to another. First
log fences were tried cautiously, then wire more largely.
Experienced settlers held up their hands in protest against
innovation. Practical common-sense people smiled pityingly
at the greenness and imbecility of the idea that sheep could
eat grass without a man and dog hunting them all day. For
such folks the routine of a few years bears the sanction of time
immemorial. The same men are now loudest in favour of
fencing, and declare they always thought so.
From this point, fencing quickly gained ground till it
quietly displaced the shepherding system over three-fourths
of the inland country, with great advantage both to the stock
and pasture at first, until of late years the theory has been
ridden to death, and we have already symptoms in hundreds
that overstocking has touched its possible limit even in
good fenced country. But the consequence at first was
marvellous.
It is no exaggeration that the change added 25 per cent.


to the fleece, reduced annual expenses 25 per cent., and added
to the capability of pasture 50 per cent.
This fact, the direct outcome of the gold discovery, pro-
vides a key to the future of our grazing system ; it will yet
act as a solvent to our land policy and tenure, and even now
it gives us a glimpse of the possibility of further improvements
under altered conditions of population.
Meanwhile it has been signalised by a growth that has
arisen of late years, a development completely dissimilar in
kind to squatting as originally constituted ; the growth of a
money interest absorbing squatting property through the
banks, its progress being accelerated by the expenditure in-
curred in fencing in the runs. The change of ownership
which marked this period was very general. Since the rise of
prices in 1854, the system of forming, buying, and working
stations with money advanced by the banks through agents
had greatly developed; and whether designedly or not, whether
from a natural law of finance, or from premeditated system,
as soon as stations had been thoroughly fenced and brought
into working order, foreclosure seemed to become the uniform
rule. There was, no doubt, to be found a certain amount of
explanation in the facts themselves, though the action of the
mortgagee appears in innumerable cases utterly inconsistent
with the facility with which the advances were at first tendered
by them.
It was quite common for a man with only a few thousand
pounds to buy a large station on credit, or buy some unstocked
country and go in debt for stock. With the high prices current
and the easy credit given, debt and speculation became the
fashion, and ideas got greatly inflated. It was com-
monly said about 1859 and iB6O that a man was only wasting
time working with less than 40,000 or 50,000 sheep. The
balance of an account made up of cost of station or stock at
compound interest and commission soon took large propor-
tions, and when fencing appeared and was hailed as the solu-
tion of all squatting difficulties, it merely showed, as the first
result, an additional 50 per cent, augmenting the debt already
incurred. Bank directors were more given to comment on
the sudden, and, as might appear to them, undue growth of a
balance, than to give heed to the explanation which pointed
out the added value of their security. ? That might or might


not be?to them it was unprovedand in most cases they
preferred realising,?or at least having a new man on the station.
Many first-rate stations, in excellent working order, thus
passed from the men who had made them, literally to pour
money into the pockets of men of straw put in by the banks
?these being, at least a large proportion of them, not practical
squatters at all, but relatives of bank directors, politicians,
dealers in scrip and shares, and hangers-on of mercantile
houses.
In some districts, Riverina especially, the consequence of
fencing has been a production so enormously increased as to
be perfectly astounding when compared with old squatting
estimates. Shepherded, a block of good country might carry
4000 sheep, shearing wool. A fenced block in Riverina
is reckoned to carry 8000 sheep, shearing 4 lbs. wool. At the
low price of 2od. per pound the result is against
This is the harvest that dropped into the mouths of the
men who acquired possession through foreclosure, often with-
out a farthing of capital, and this is what the men toiled for
who established a new system of grazing, in spite of prejudice
and discouragement. As their scheme was crowned with
success, the prize of their labours was wrenched from them.
The Free Selection Act, though it came into operation in
the settled and intermediate districts in 1861 took effect in the
inland country only after 1865. The forces set in motion by
this celebrated piece of legislation did not acquire full vigour
till several years after. Up to that time grazing was in the
position above described.
The professed aim of the Selection Act was to settle popu-
lation in the interior, but to tell what have been the fruits of
the law, or to define the free selector as he is, would be as
hopeless as to fix on canvas the hues of the chameleon.
One honorable member of our Assembly describes the
type as an honest and industrious farmer, struggling to grow
wheat even at a pecuniary loss, the victim at once of adverse
climate, social enmity, and legal oppression.


Another member pictures him as a shanty-keeper, select-
ting forty acres on the frontage of a cattle-station, and apply-
ing under the Brands Act for a brand as like as possible to
the brand of the station on which he has fixed his homestead.
The palpable misfortune which invariably follows and haunts
agriculture carried on in this way is that the selector?s calves
will always perversely insist on following the station cows.
The O?Donohue family again carry on agriculture in quite
another way. As their doings have become historical, and
are therefore public property, we quote a few facts of their
biography from the public Press :
List of selections made by Thomas O?Donohue on behalf of himself and
amily from 12th February, 1874, to 18th February, 1875, one year.
WILANGERIN, NEVER NEVER DISTRICT.
February 12. ?Thomas O?Donohue, 320 acres ; Henry J. O?Donohue,
minor, 320 acres ; Thomas M. O?Donohue, minor, 320 acres.
Total?96o acres.
WOODLANDS, NEVER NEVER DISTRICT.
June 4. ?Mary Anne O?Donohue, minor, 320 acres; Maude Margaret
O?Donohue, minor, 320 acres; Winifred O?Donohue, minor, 320 acres; Albert
Edward O?Donohue, minor, 320 acres.
November 5. ?Martha O?Donohue, minor, 320 acres.
December 10. ?Thomas O?Donohue, minor, 320 acres.
Total ?1920 acres.
GILIMBERAN, NEVER NEVER DISTRICT.
February 18, 1875. ?Henry J. O?Donohue, minor, 320 acres; Thomas
M. O?Donohue, minor, 320 acres.
Total?64o acres.
Altogether selected out of three runs by the O?Donohue family in one year,
3520 acres.
But, after all, we see no objection to a family like the
O?Donohues getting 3520 acres of land, or indeed, double that
area, under well defined and well administered conditions.
The objection we see to their doings is that these selections
have not been taken up according to such a plan of survey as
would give them one compact well-defined property, taking
equally the good and the bad ; but the method in which they
are taken proves clearly that the market they looked to for
their agricultural operations was neither more nor less than
the pressure they could bring to bear upon the lessees of the
lands ; and they have multiplied their chances by bringing
their forces to bear on three separate run owners.
The newspaper writer from whom we quote is, however,
too rough altogether on the ? O?Donohues.? He says :


? I trust you will point out the objects such selectors have in
taking up lands, namely, to sell out, and I hope you will expose
their rapacity.? This is too bad. Although the ?O?Donohues?
plan of selection is, ethically considered, as like as possible to
the action of native dogs, still, it must be remembered that it
is strictly lawful. Has not the Premier told us that he dis-
tinctly foresaw the present enormous increase to the land
revenue when he introduced the bill, and we should like to
know this ?unless a direct pressure were brought on the squat-
ters by such as the ? O?Donohues,? where would this surplus
be ? It therefore comes to this, that the O?Donohues are not
only quite justified and quite right, legally and morally, in
what they have done and are doing, but that they are carry-
ing on agriculture exactly as Mr. Robertson?s Act intended
they should.
We trust, then, that this successful family has not failed
to record its gratitude to the venerable author of the Act;
and also to that eminent statesman the Minister for Lands,
who sat at the feet of his senior and drew wisdom from his lips.
This, however, is only one side of selection ; indeed it
covers but one section of the wide circle influenced by the Act.
Still it contains this vital and essential fact, that without the
land-sharking element, the number of applications would be
greatly fewer and the revenue would be decreased enormously.
In addition and beyond this phase of operation, the variety
and ingenuity of legalised fraud and intimidation daily de-
veloped by the hostility of the two interests, are far beyond
what we can detail. One example occurs to us which may
serve as an instance. On a southern station 4000 ewes were
put to lamb in a 6000-acre paddock. Two selectors took up
1280 acres in the heart of the paddock, and turned 2500 ewes
among the sheep already there. The motive was obvious, and
the inevitable damage resulting has been equal to the loss of
all the lambs. The owner, if a beginner, might or probably
would have been ruined. The selectors calculated, of course,
on getting a good cheque to move off, and no doubt the advo-
cates of ? agriculture? think they have earned it fairly.
But, with all this, selection has a respectable side. In
the earlier days of the law, great numbers of honest people
settled all over the unoccupied country on the coast and in
the intermediate districts, some of them being laborers making


cheap homesteads for their families, and others investing their
savings with the proper and natural ambition to have places
of their own. Occasionally there were to be seen among them
men equal to any of us in respectability and education, possess-
ing too small means to face squatting with its risks of debt
and speculation, and they selected, as the only resource open
to them. Some few of these last have succeeded, in spite of
the niggardly encouragement which the law gives to honest
settlement, and some have aided in establishing new indus-
tries, as, for example, near Albury and elsewhere. Now, this
valuable class is beaten out of the field. It is only by pre-
liminary survey, with a graduated scale of areas, that we can
attract the best class of settlers, filling the gap between the
two extremes to which our system tends.
Much has been said of the success of the Act in Monaro.
This fact is qualified by one circumstance, namely, that it was
attended in that district with the utter ruin of the squatters.
It is easy to prove that through rational and honest legislation
all the results shown might have been produced without des-
truction to previous interests, and to any candid mind that
must appear a wretched success that is built on the downfall
of others. Many a family in Monaro'has lost their means of
living through the stations that they had spent their money
and labour upon being destroyed by the Selection Act.
But it is not to be supposed that to the framers of the Act
that would appear as any disadvantage. The lower elements
in human nature were pandered to in working up the popular
excitement which passed the law. To get a farm was an induce-
ment to many, but to many more there was an attraction in
the prospect of humiliating those whom they envied. The
better sort wanted farms, and would have been satisfied if they
could have got them by any other law, but to the baser ? all
this was nothing, so long as Mordecai the Jew sat by the king?s
gate,? and the cut-throat element in selection was that which
they chiefly prized.
As the combat thickened, the bona-fide respectable settler
came less to the front, and the conflict was mainly between the
squatter and the land-shark. It was war, and everything was
considered fair. When an honest selector does make an at-
tempt to get land now, the chances are greatly against him,
and indeed many of the best have withdrawn in disgust. The


gentlemen who thronged to the Yanko Reserve lately were
nearly all agriculturists of the same school?that of the O?Dono-
hues?. With the law as it is, manipulated by these contending
factions, every honest man, whether selector or squatter, is at
a great disadvantage. A law-abiding honorable man of either
class is handicapped by his principles far too heavily to cope
with his opponents, or even to have a chance with members of
his own faction. A squatter par excellence, ? a squatter of the
squatters,? is said to have bought land lately by auction along
his run boundary, and to have taken the corresponding pre-
lease of three times the area out of his neighbour's run* A
squatter of the old school might well exclaim, ? Credat fudceus /?
Nevertheless, it was quite legal?whether fair or honorable does
not matter. The Premier, no doubt, when with prophetic fore-
cast he reckoned up the working of his Act, foresaw this form
of pressure also, and calculated upon it as a source of revenue.
The principle thus legalised, and apparently underlying
every clause of the Act, is that the biggest rogue is the best
man, that revoking is fair so long as you win the game, and
that piracy is only a branch of legitimate trade, and may pro-
perly be used as a source of revenue.
Apart from these abuses, the general effect of selection is
to bring a pressure to bear on the squatter, forcing him to heavy
outlay and debt, thereby adding to the tendency to absorption
of stations by the banks.
The total outcome is astounding.
As the stations fall into stronger hands, the selectors are
either effectually obstructed or they are fought for every inch
of country.
No ingenuity could devise a system which could more
thoroughly thwart either settlement or production, which could
place greater obstacles in the way of our industry, or could limit
the enjoyment of the soil to so small a fraction of the people.
Instead of well-defined and protected rights of occupation,
our law keeps us at the mercy of the two opposing forces of
* A friend to whom the facts of this occurrence are known has pointed
out an error in our statement. The land purchased, as well as the pre-lease,
was taken on the neighbour?s side of the boundary. We fear that any amende
we could offer in the circumstances would partake somewhat of the character
of Midshipman Easy?s celebrated apology??l withdraw my statement, Sir.
The First Lieutenant is fit to carry guts to a bear.?


spoliation and monopoly. The prizes seldom fall into the hands
of the hardy pioneer, the energetic improver, or the industrious
farmer; but the money-lender and the land-shark fatten on the
strife, and become even as our princes and nobles.
If we might judge of the future from the present, we should
say that the chaos now existing contains elements that must
before long lead to the dissolution and reconstruction of our
land system.
The utterly negative absurdity of our present policy, which
equally repels population, hampers pastoral progress and
favours at times foreclosure and ruin, at times monopoly and
absenteeism, must ere long tell on thinking people.
The growing conviction that a better state of things is
possible, the better apprehension of that almost untapped source
of wealth and prosperity, ? Homestead Settlement,? and the
weariness of all honest intelligent men with a law which thrives
only on mutual wrong, can hardly fail to lead the public mind
in the direction of reform. When thought has reached this
point, then it will be plain that our prosperity, whether called
agricultural or pastoral, in no way depends either on ministerial
ingenuity or on the smiles of financial authorities.
If we may reason from the common course of nature the
grasses of our pastures will not cease growing, nor will the
alternation of our seasons be arrested, even though this present
Ministry should be out of power, and even if our grazing
arrangements should go into a groove where run-jobbino- and
money-lending may be unknown.
The wealth flowing from our pastures will continue to
flow and to increase in volume as we add to the security of
our tenure and enlarge the number of our land owners, as we
get rid of our squabbles and adopt a method of rational ad-
ministration.
The key to>ich a reconstruction of our system as would
benefit every land-holder alike and treble their numbers is in
our own hands. The annual waste of our resources, the extent


of wholesome settlement prevented or checked, our losses from
intimidation and black mail, the costs of law and officialism,
far outweigh in value the ? surplus? which is the boast of our
Government and promises to be the future bane of our country,
which is raised by the prompting of class antagonism, and
which is but a fund for the endowment of political jobbery and
the fattening of political quacks.
The direction in which we advocate a change involves no
mystery, and appeals to no untried theory. It simply points
to a movement towards wholesome ? homestead settlement?
from our present vicious method.
It merely involves the adapting of our standard industry
to the growth of population. It is only proposed to fall back
on that early method of which the practical results are written
in plain letters in the success of the first settlers and their
families.
It points out that the resources, both of the country and
the people, that raised the germ of a healthful community fifty
years ago are available yet in greater abundance and greater
variety than ever, and it is prepared to suggest a plain and
simple method for the satisfaction of existing interests.
Fortunately the changes of half a century have left the
original frame of settlement so far untouched in the old dis-
tricts as to place within our reach the means of laying before
our readers a comparison of two equal areas of country, with
the results shown in their occupation, one of the tracts being
settled before 1835 under the system of Crown grants, and
the other twenty years later, consequently purely under squat-
ting and selection.
The county of Breadalbane is poor third-class country. It
is called by the Riverina people ? sour grass country.? It is
sandstone intersected by granite, with a limestone ridge run-
ning through it. It is high, and has a long~winter. Its area
is about forty miles each way, or one million of acres. About
one-third of this consists of stony stringy-bark ranges, which
nobody will ever take up. The good land is all freehold. The
pre-emptive leases go up back creeks, but they are too poor
to be selected.
The crop grown in this county is very trifling. Few of
the larger landowners grow anything at all, and not above one-
third of the smaller settlers. All live mainly by their cattle

the small settlers is as bad as it can possibly be. Still, all
|* ve generally live well. Contract work, shearing, carry-
ing, and numerous local industries?such as fellmongering,
tanning, lime-burning, sawing?employ many of the smaller
settlers ; and, moreover, many of them supplement their means
by handicrafts, such as wheelwright?s work and shoemaking/
In fact, the community is mutually self-supporting; and it
may be fairly taken as an illustration of freehold or homestead
settlement.
Common talk often speaks of Breadalbane as a squatting
district, but in reality it has nothing to do with squatting
whatever, and never had. This inaccurate diction leads at
times to much confusion of ideas.
One or two of the larger landowners, indeed, call them-
selves squatters, not considering, or, perhaps, comprehending
the real meaning of the term. From a similar habit of inac-
curacy they have a way of giving out once a year that the
selectors (meaning every man with fewer acres than them-
selves) are starving, that property is only an incumbrance and
misfortune to the lower classes, &c.; but the fact is that nobody
in the county has ever starved yet, except the unfortunate
cattle, and they would not starve but from the negligence and
laziness of the owners. If all the small settlers put in a few
acres of crop, and saved a stack of hay for winter feed, they
would every man be twice as well off as they are, and their
cattle would not starve.
Breadalbane is occupied as follows. It contains 1

There is besides in this county the chief town of the dis-
trict, but we do not include this, as it does not depend entirely
on the local rural trade.
In the three villages each family possesses a few head of
cattle, and the men are employed in contract work and various
trades.


The above estimate we believe to be approximately correct,
and the number both of inhabitants and live stock to be below
the mark.
Breadalbane is in fact, with all drawbacks of soil and climate,
and all deficiencies of its inhabitants, a vigorous rural com-
munity.
In contrast we propose to present to our readers an equal
area of country on a western river, comprising the five stations
of Milroy, Bibadjan, Muntawang, Widgy, and Mandaray.
These runs are of course out of the sour grass country. Almost
every acre in any of the five is equal in grass-growing power
to three of the best of Breadalbane. The five runs belong to
four proprietors, two being resident, and two represented by
managers. No selection has taken place on any of them yet ?
the frontages being well secured according to law. A Sydney
merchant owns two of the stations, which he has never seen ;
a Melbourne speculator owns another ?he was once upon it for
a day ; and the two others were bought three years ago by the
present proprietors at high prices, and they ? are working them
out.? The total population of the five stations, two being cattle
and three sheep, is, counting women and children, about one
hundred and forty; and there is a floating number of some
forty men back and forward, being shearers, drovers, carriers,
and so on.
The stock on the country is 20,000 cattle and 140,000
sheep. The annual produce is worth �55,000, of which about
one tenth is spent in station expenses. By some unexplained
fiction all this wealth is supposed to benefit the district; but
the real beneficiaries are so placed that they never contribute
a farthing to the national advantage, and fulfil no social or civic
duties. Except as stomachs to absorb the fruits of the earth,
they are to all intents ciphers.
The contrast then stands as follows :
' One million of acres in the settled districts, or ? sour grass
country,? is occupied by 2030 inhabitants, with 29,100 cattle
and 63,000 sheep. A large proportion of the heads of families
are living on their own land and nearly all have stock. Against
One million of acres, being the celebrated fattening stations
Milroy, Bibadjan, Muntawang, Widgy, and Mandaray ?all
saltbush and volcanic plains??with forty miles frontage on both


sides of the Yarran, is occupied by 140 inhabitants, with 20,000
cattle and 140,000 sheep.
Two of the residents have a contingent claim to property
in this country when their bills are met. All the restare there
by the year or month on wages. The only other place in this
piece of country is a pothouse on Mandaray, where the shearers
change their cheques. It is brutally filthy, and can have been
licensed for no good reasons.
One sometimes hears that this latter method is necessarily
the first stage of occupation, and that these five stations and
others like them will, by a gradual process, take the same form
as the County of Breadalbane. When, we would like to ask?
When the land is wanted for agriculture. Yes?when the
Greek Kalends arrive??when the kye come hame.?
Go down to Riverina, and say to the owner of Windabyne
station that you want some of his land for agriculture, and he
will tell you that he has none to spare; he wants it all; and,
if you try to select on him, the chances are ten to one he will
? best? you, and you will only lose your time and money. In
like manner these five runs, a little further north, will, in a few
years, be so thoroughly protected by volunteer land orders and
improvement purchases, that a selector will be clever who can
find space to settle on. Does this process look like any pur-
pose of quitting hold of the country ? Is it not childish to
pretend to believe anything else but the plain fact, ?that these
stations are intended to be kept as they are, and that, whether
the ostensible proprietors sink or swim, the money power will
press and consolidate them more and more into the shape of
freehold estates.
This is the natural and inevitable consequence of our run-
jobbing tenure. A transferable lease is acquired for a few
pounds which conveys an actual title to country into hands
that will never willingly slacken their grip till the ? crack of
doom.? Selection, as things are, provides no solvent for this
monopoly; even where it has succeeded it has only established
one form of evil for another. The value of the old method,
under which Breadalbane was laid out, consists in this?that
it gave fair openings to men of all degrees and various means,
while it left no scope for the abuses in which our modern system
culminates.


then confidently ask these questions, in view of
the contrast presented,?
Which plan is best adapted for our social and industrial
welfare ? Which is most in accordance with a rational idea of
colonisation ? And which is most favourable to our national
growth ?
One very marked feature in the growth of our grazing
system has been the increased and ever-increasing size of the
runs. At first a run was 16,000 acres, the area estimated to
carry 4000 sheep, and it was thought to be a very fair extent
of country for a man to begin upon. Then, under the orders
in Council, it became common to tender for four runs or blocks,
afterwards eight ; and, with the Queensland rush, when specu-
lation took great dimensions, stations began to be reckoned by
hundreds of thousands of acres, and now they have reached to
millions.
There are runs taken up on the Diamantina and other
western Queensland rivers twice the size of the county of
Breadalbane.
This must all tend to an unwholesome growth that will
leave a riddle for the future of Queensland to solve.
Among other reasons that lead us to anticipate a change
in our grazing policy is the reflection that we can find only
through the agency of a settled freehold population, the means
by which the problems of grass culture, minute paddocking,
and other obvious improvements can be carried out. It is only
when our system begins to approach real stock-farming, that
we shall be able to meet with comparative indifference the
alternations of wet and dry seasons, or that will enable us to
cope with disease through a rational method of personal obser-
vation and study,without being victims, as at present, to periodi-
cal panic and quackery.
During the last few years a symptom in connection with
our squatting operations has recurred so regularly that it has
almost become permanent and chronic. Whatever the season
may be, ?whether the rainfall has been short ?of average quan-
tity ?or plentiful,?from the month of October till April one
prolonged wail of drought rises along our western rivers. It
needs but a slight knowledge of what is going on to explain
how this is. The seasons have little or nothing to do with it.
With 50 inches of rain the same thing would go on as with 15.


The frontages are over-stocked and the grass is shaved clean
off as fast as it grows. The Drove-Roads are crowded and
trampled bare by stock travelling for grass, and all the time
year after year hundreds of miles of magnificent plains are left
unwatered and the grass untouched. It is perilous under the
squatting tenure to cope with the watering of back country.
If you make a large dam, you are only providing an opening
for a gang of selectors, and moreover the money question comes
in, the ? atra cura? always on the croup of the squatter;?
buyers at the prices of late years are expected by their financial
nurses to clear off their balances, and not to increase them by
launching into expensive works.
It can only be through the personal energy of the freehold
grazier working on his own land, that these plains can be well
watered and really utilised.
Meantime, whoever attempts such operations at present,
runs the risk of ruining himself merely to swell the chaos of
universal usury and stock-jobbing.
There is another matter rising to view that threatens before
long to assume serious proportions. The increase of the wild
denizens of the forest, since the removal of their natural
enemies, is already causing the destruction of pasture on large
uninhabited runs. The future extent of this scourge we cannot
judge of, but during the last few years, heedless of our expe-
rience of the kangaroos? ravages, we have been turning loose
a much more destructive animal. The hare finds cover any-
where, and will increase in almost all kinds of country. Here
the doe breeds several times in the year, and has three or four
leverets at a time. The animal seems, too, to become stronger
and swifter in Australia. No dogs will keep down the number
when once they are fairly fixed in the ground. The gun is the
only remedy, and unless we get population, it will not be sur-
prising to find the hares doing everywhere very much what the
kangaroos are doing in certain districts.
These various considerations all tend in one direction, and
it will be a good day for New South Wales when we determine
to adopt a land system that will harmonise our standard in-
dustry with the spread of household life, that will rub out our
paltry class squabbles, and blend us all into one nation.
