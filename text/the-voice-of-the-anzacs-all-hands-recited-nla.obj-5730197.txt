THE VOICE OF THE "ANZACS."
H A N DS
Recited by Ed. E. FORD,
THE AUSTRALIAN SUNDOWNER.
There's a whisper that was bornsYipon the breeze,
Which the ca,n?c vvc j*j :;t - ~ # ef -iVr k ble. »
As a fact the message went ac. sAhe seas
By that unpoetic agency thea/rble.
All the same it sent a sympathise thrill
Through the Anglo-Saxon folk of other lands;
If you're in for stormy weather
Kindly count us altogether,
And be good enough to call all hands.
We hear the bugle calling on the British Grenadiers,
We hearken to the marching of the Irish Fusiliers;
The piping of the Highlanders ii. "inging in our ears,
So be good enough to call all hands.
We mean to take a place among the nations of the earth;
We'll found a new Britannia, or we'll try with all our worth,
But we don't forget the country where our Empire had its birth,
And we're ready when you call all hands.
They talk of your decadence, if you please,
But the beggars never seem to have a notion
That the Britain who is the seas
Has a growing group oi t-'ti.aii:- o'er the ocean.
We prefer a reign of quietness and peace,
But now trouble's come, we'/! show them how it stands
That ten thousand miles of water makes the British all the tauter
When you pass the word and call all hands.
We're as English as you English, though the water lies between;
We're as Irish as you Irish, who are soldiers of the King;
We're as Scotch as any Scotchman in the town of Aberdeen,
And we're Britons now yovjve called all hands.
PRICE: ONE PENNY.
