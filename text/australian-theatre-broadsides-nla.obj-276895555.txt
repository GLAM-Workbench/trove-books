Strange, isn’t it ?
A man will go into a Tobacconist’s
shop and ask for a packet of cigarette ?.
He knows that if he wants the beat
article the price is sixpence. This he
lays on the chunter, but he often does
not trouble about the brand. This is
a great mistake, for if he asked for
“ THREE CASTLES CIGARETTES ’
he would get the best article in the
market; and one thing is very certain,
that, having asked for “ THREE
CASTLES” once, and smoked them,
he would never buy any other brand.
Just you try, and see.

was first noted at Malta, and -aB5O. In
1729 the whole of Europe suffered severely.
According to statistics published by the
Novoe Vremya, the disease caused 908
deaths in London /up one week, and in
Vienna sixty thousand persons we'/e af-
fected. In 1737 land 1743 there were
further outbreaks, and the deaths in one
week in London amounted to one thous-
and. In 1775 domestic animals were
first attacked by it. In 1782 forty thous-

Thus an American paper . The tele-
graph companies of Australia suffer a
good deal from the fondness of the
natives for bracelets and ear and nose
rings made of telegraph wire.” All this
statement, by the way, is true, except
that there are no telegraph companies in
Australia, and that the few stray aborig-
inals to be found near telegraph lines
never dream even remotely of touching
the wires. The remainder of the state-
ment is quite correct, that is, if there is
any remainder.

A Well-known Sydney Resident Cured of Rheumatism.
Mr. Pegg will be only to 3 pleased to give any sufferer fuller details of his case by calling
at his private address, as below :
47 Lower Fort-street, Dawes’ Point, Sydney, November 30bh, 1899.
Mr. S. A. PALMER, 184 Pict-street, Sydney,
Dear Sir, —I am glad to testify to the invaluable qualities of VITADATIO. Some 13
months ago I had to consult a Melbourne doctor re a severe attack of rheumatism. The
doctor prescribed for me, but the medicine gave me no permanent relief. I suffered acute
pain for months, and was unable to get sleep for more than an hour or two during the night.
Knowing several of your clients who had been cared by Vitadatio, I resolved to give it a
trial, and am happy to say that for the last three months I have been perfectly free from
pain, and have no hesitation in attributing my restored health to Vitadatio. I shall be
very glad to give personal corroboration to the above, if necessary.
Witness : Daniel M. Urie. Yours faithfully, HENRY S. PEGG.
URIC ACID, CAUSING DEATH REMOVED--If your life is being shortened by
an excessive generation in the system of this poisonous acid, try VITADATIO,
which remove* abnormal uric acid deposits In blood and tissue, and remedies the
Gout, Rheumatism and Sciatica they may give rise to.
A Well-known City Ma,n Courteously Gives Vitadatio Credit.
Prell’s-buildings, 60-70 Queen-st., Melbourne, May sth, 1899.
Mr. S. A. PALMER, Esq., 45-47 Bourke-street.
Dear Sir, —I have been hesitating for the last six months relative to the actual merits of
your famous medicine, “Vitadatio,” and although I am anxious at all times to recommend
any sterling recipe for complaints similar to that from which I have suffered for the last ten
years, namely, sciatic rheumatism, I, knowing that my opinion and recommendation would
carry weight amongst a wide circle of acquaintances, felt I must actually satisfy myself
beyond the slighest doubt before expressing an opinion, good, bad, or indifferent.
I have, during my long career, travelled pretty well all over the world, tried many
prescriptions, and acted upon medical advice from gentlemen of repute and standing.
I must say now conscientiously that, although I have not been at all consistent regarding
diet, etc., during the time I have taken “Vitadatio,” still I have derived greater benefit
from the same than from any other medicine. Each attack of sciatic rheumatism gradually
lessens in its intensity, and without doubt is rapidly being eradicated from my system.
I think it a duty to give this testimonial, and fervently hope that those who have
suffered like myself will be equally successful in obtaining relief. With good wishes for
the future. Obediently yours, F. B. NORTON.
Acute Rheumatism Oared after 20 Months’ Intense Suffering.
Mr. S. A. PALMER. March 24th, 1900.
Dear Sir, —These lines are written to testify to the great benefit I have received through
the use of the famous remedy Vitadatio. I was a great sufferer from rheumatism for
twenty months. So bad was I that ray wrists were practically out of joint, my knee-caps
twisted on one side, and I was confined to my bed totally unable to work. The pain I
suffered was excruciating, my screams, or groans, being heard in my neighbours’ houses.
Hearing of the cures effected by Vitadatio, I was induced to try it, and I can truly say its
effect upon me was marvellous My limbs have been restored to their normal condition, I
am free from the pa n and I have been able to follow my occupation for four months past.
lam well known, aid my case has attracted considerable attention. You are at liberty to
et others know of the benefit I have received from that splendid remedy, Vitadatio, which
I can earnestly recommend, —Yours, etc., WILLIAM SMITH, Ferry Steps, Port Adelaide.

Changed His Mind.
A young man about twenty-three years of age
dressed like a farmer, bad his feet cn the car
seat in front of him and was reading a novel,
when one of the boys went over to him and ob-
served :
“ I’ve just made a bet of five dollars on you."
“Onme ? What is it ?”
“ I’ve bet five dollars that you will suicide
within a week. I’ve been watching you very
closely for the last half hour, and all signs in-
dicate melancholy and despondency. Have you
selected any particular line of killing yourself—
poison, the rope, drowning or hanging ? ”
“Did you actually bet five dollars?” an
xiously asked the young man.
“I did.”
“ Pay if you lose ?
“ I’ll have to.”
“ That’s too bad, 1 wish I could have seen
you last week.”
“ Why last week ? ”
“ Because I then had the ager every day right
along—two cows were sick on my hands—my
girl had gone back on me, and I expected a
windmill man was going to beat me out of four

He’d Stop Over.
A new story was afloat on Prince Russell
Harrison at the fifth Avenue Hotel last
night, and is credited to W. W. Dudley.
It occurred on the Prince’s recent visit to
Europe. On the way over he told his
fellow passengers that he should not stop
in England at all, but should hurry right
through to Paris. At Liverpool it was
noticed that Russell was preparing his
baggage with an eye to stop in London.
“ Why, Mr. Harrison,” said a fellow
passenger, “ I thought you weren’t going
to stop in England ? ”
“Well,” said the Prince, “It’s this way?
If the Prince of Wales should go to
America and pass through Washington
without stopping to call on father, we’d
think it darned queer, an’ so I thought
I’d stop over here a few days and pay my
respects to the Queen.” —“New York Star.*
Story or a Diamond Necklace.
A very wealthy man gave to his wife
some years since a diamond necklace
which cost him 75,000 dols. in Paris.
Her brother, under peculiar circum-
stances, defaulted. The family was in
unspeakable grief. The great corporation
whose assets he had made way with was
quite willing to compromise the felony if
it could be recouped pecuniarily. Taking
her diamond necklace to a world-renowned
establishment, she asked for how much
it could be duplicated in paste, and was
told that for 2,500 dols. a necklace abso-
lutely a reproduction, absolutely undetect-
able, save by expert tests, could be made
in three months’ time. It was ordered,
paid for, the original was sold, the brother
was saved. Shortly after that, or perhaps
a few years thereafter, this lady, who was
in what our contemporaries call “ high
life,” —that is, she was rich, —attended a
charity ball Sitting in her box, resplendent
in costume, magnificent in decoration, her
necklace so far outshone the jewels of her
friends and neighbors as to be included in
a reportprial description the following day
in the chief paper of the city.—“ New
York Press.”
