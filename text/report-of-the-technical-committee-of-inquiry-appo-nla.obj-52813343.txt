Report of the Technical Committee of Inquiry.
The Technical Committee, appointed to inquire into the health of stone-
masons, quarrymon, sewer miners and rockchoppers, submits the results of
its investigation in the following summary:—
The work of clinical investigation was commenced on 18th August, 1924,
and was completed on 12th November, 1924. During that time the complete
examination of 716 workmen was carried out.
These men had been engaged in Sydney and its neighbourhood in work
in sandstone, granite, trachyte and marble, and therefore were in the first
three instances exposed in their occupation to the inhalation of dust con-
taining free crystalline silica. Many of them (380 or 53 per cent.) had been
employed elsewhere than in Sydney in mines and at other work, in which
also they had been exposed to the inhalation of dust containing silica. Dor
the purposes of brevity in this report the term work in silica ” has been
adopted to express this occupational hazard. Eurther, the term “ ■Sydney
District ” has been used to describe an area extending from Sydney, south-
ward to Kiama, northward to Newcastle, and in a westerly direction as far
as Lithgow.
Each man submitting himself for examination was allotted a number, by
which only he was identified in the subsequent investigation. The name of
each individual was recorded in a book with his identification number, and
this information was regarded as confidential. In the case of 59 men who
withheld their names from the committee, the allocation of identification
numbers was made by the secretary of their Union.
A complete medical examination and a radiographic investigation of the
chest were made on each man. Chemical and pathological tests were carried
out in every case in which the necessary specimens were procured. Each man
who gave a history of cough and expectoration was supplied with a sterile
jar for the reception of a specimen of his sputum, which was brought by him
to the examination rooms. These and other specimens were examined-at the
Microbiological Laboratory of the State Board of Health. The industrial
history of each man was taken in detail. Some men about whom doubt or
uncertainty arose, either as regards their classification or diagnosis, were
submitted to such further examination and interrogation as was necessary.
Complete information was obtained in every instance, except in the case of
an Italian, whose inability to speak English prevented a satisfactory indus-
trial history being obtained. This man was not affected by silicosis or
tuberculosis.
Of the 716 men examined, 123 were found to exhibit signs of silicosis. Of
these 123 men, 47 were found to he affected with the first stage. 38 with the
second stage, and 38 with silicosis complicated by tuberculosis. In addition,
16 men were found to be suffering from simple pulmonary tuberculosis, i.c..
pulmonary tuberculosis uncomplicated by silicosis. In all, 139 men were
found to be affected with silicosis, silicosis with tuberculosis, or simple
pulmonary tuberculosis.

Table I.—lncidence of Silicosis and Tuberculosis among all Men
Examined (716).
Of these 139 men, 11 had worked for two years or less in silica in the
Sydney district, but for relatively long periods elsewhere in mines or at
other work in which they had been exposed to silica. Silicosis and pul-
monary tuberculosis existing in these men cannot be attributed to their work
in the Sydney district. Of these 11 men, 4 were found ti be affected with,
the first stage, one with the second stage of silicosis, 4 with silicosis and
tuberculosis, and 2 with simple pulmonary tuberculosis.
Men who had Worked in Silica in the Sydney District for more than
Two Years.
Among the 569 men who had worked for more than two years in silica in
Sydney, 114 were found to exhibit signs of silicosis and 14 were found to be
suffering from simple pulmonary tuberculosis. The distribution of these
diseases is shown in the following table:—
Table 2. —Incidence of Silicosis and Tuberculosis among 569 Men who have
Worked for more than Two Years in Silica in Sydney.
Note.—Those men, 147 in number, who had worked in silica in the Sydney district for a period of two
years or less have been relegated to a special class and considered separately in a later section of this
report.
Among the 441 men unaffected with either silicosis or tuberculosis, 221, or
50 per cent., had worked in silica in the Sydney district only, and 220, or
50 per cent., had worked in silica in the Sydney district and elsewhere.
Of the 114 men in whom signs of silicosis were found, 41, or 36 per cent.,
had worked in sandstone in the Sydney district only, and 73, or 64 per cent.,
had worked in silica in the Sydney district and elsewhere.
Of the 43 men who exhibited signs of the first stage of silicosis, 11, or 26
per cent., had worked in sandstone in the Sydney district only, and 32, or
74 per cent., in silica in the Sydney district and elsewhere.
lOf the 37 persons who were found to be suffering from the second stage of
silicosis, 16, or 43 per cent., had worked in sandstone in the Sydney district
only, and 21, or 57 per cent., in silica in the Sydney district and elsewhere.
Of the 34 men affected with silicosis complicated with tuberculosis, 14, or
41 per cent., had worked in sandstone in the Sydney district only, and 20, or
59 per cent., in silica in the Sydney district and elsewhere.
Of the 14 men affected with simple pulmonary tuberculosis, 6, or 43 per
cent., had worked in sandstone in the Sydney district only, and 8, or 57 per
cent., in silica in the Sydney district and elsewhere.
'The committee is satisfied from its investigations that a condition of
silicosis may arise in men who have worked only in sandstone in the Sydney
district. Despite the lack of opportunity to investigate post mortem the


organs of any men wlio had worked in sandstone in the Sydney district only,
the committee is satisfied from the clinical and radiographical examinations
that the disease occurs as the result of work in sandstone in the Sydney
■district).
No evidence was obtained that silicosis arises as the result of working in
granite, trachyte or marble in the Sydney district. During the investigation
a condition of silicosis was not found in any individual who had worked in
the Sydney district only and whose work had been done only in these
materials. The number (9) of such men examined is not sufficient to justify
a positive statement that silicosis may not result from work in granite,
trachyte or marble in the Sydney district. Examination of the industrial
histories shows that 4 of these men had worked only in granite and trachyte,
2 in trachyte only, 1 in granite only, and 2 in marble only.
Of these 2 had worked for ten years or less.
5 ” ’’ ” a period between eleven and twenty years, and
2 ” ” a period 1 between twenty-one and thirty years.
Of these 9 men, none showed any signs of silicosis. Two were found to
be suffering from simple pulmonary tuberculosis. Their ages were 36 and
47 years, and their periods of work in the Sydney district were twenty years
and twenty-five years respectively.
Ten men had worked for more than five years in granite, trachyte or
marble in Sydney, but had worked in sandstone also. Two had worked in
trachyte, lin granite, and 3 had worked in marble. Of these 10 men—•
5 had worked for ten years or under in granite, trachyte or marble.
2 had worked for periods between eleven and twenty years in granite,
trachyte or marble,
2 had worked for periods between twenty-one and thirty years in granite,
trachyte or marble,
1 had worked for periods between thirty-one and forty years in granite,
trachyte or marble.
Two of these ten men were found to be suffering from silicosis, but both
gave long histories of work in sandstone in addition to their work in granite,
trachyte or marble. One man, suffering from silicosis in the first stage, had
worked for thirty-four years in Sydney as a stonemason. The other, who was
affected with silicosis and tuberculosis, had worked for forty-four years in
Sydney as a stonemason. In both these instances approximately one-half of
this period had ‘been spent in sandstone and the other half in either granite,
trachyte or marble. It is clear that the condition of silicosis present in these
men cannot be attributed to their work in granite, trachyte or marble.
The 716 men who presented themeselves for examination were classified
into three groups, on the basis of their industrial histories, via.;—
(1) Stonemasons, 28€?;
(2) Quarryman, 115; and
(3) Sewer miners and rockchoppers, 313.
It was found impossible to subdivide these groups. The conditions of the
trades in question are such that men do not confine themselves entirely to
the performance of one definite type of operation. Hence it was found
impossible to separate any considerable number of men who had worked pre-
dominatingly at one class of work, such as for example scahblers, machine
men, henchmen, hlockmen, drillers, hoodlers, &c. It was also found impos-
sible, on account of the great diversity in their industrial histories, to
separate sewer miners from rockchoppers. These men were engaged in work
in the sewer tunnels under construction and in railway tunnels. The follow-
ing tables (3 to 8) indicate the incidence of silicosis and tuberculosis in the
groups mentioned.

Of 100 men who worked for ten years and under in silica, 1, or 1 per

33, or 41 per cent., wore affected with silicosis.


Of 61 .men who worked over forty years, 34, or .56 per cent., were
affected with silicosis.
1 man without industrial history.
Although a medical examination was not made of all the men engaged
in those industries, on taking into account the numbers examined and after
considering their distribution in groups according to age and period of
time worked, the committee is convinced that a reasonably close approxi-
mation to the incidence of the disease in these industries can be made.
Ko instance of the disease was found in stonemasons or quarrymen who
had worked in silica for ten years or less. Two men in the sewer miners
and rockohoppers' group, who had worked for less than ten years, were
found to he suffering from .the first stage of silicosis. One, -a railway
tunneiler, had worked for four .years as an underground miner ,at Bendigo
and for two and three-quarter years in Sydney sandstone. In Sydney he
had worked entirely with the, jack-hammer and automatic pick, for two
years in «pen outs .arid. for mine months underground. The mother, -a sewer
miner who had worked for-eight years in Sydney only, had worked ■entirely
with drills for three years.
Diagnosis.
Symptoms of pulmonary disease did not occur among unaffected men
with significantly less frequency than among men in the. first stage of
silicosis. Symptoms are, therefore, of very limited value in the diagnosis
of the stage oif the 'disease. The clinical examination of the chest affords
evidence in -some instances of the presence of the disease in its early stage,
hut in other instances no such evidence is given. Radiographic examina-
tion, however, supplies the most valuable single piece of evidence in
diagnosis.
When the disease has advanced to the second stage, symptoms and signs
give more definite information. Dyspnoea (breathlessness) after exertion
is more marked and frequent, physical signs are more usually- present ill
the chest, and there is sometimes an appearance of ill-health and poor
nutrition. The second stage of the disease, however, -can only he diagnosed
with certainty with the aid of a radiographic examination.
When a tubercular complication has become -superimposed on silicosis,
the general health in most instances, deteriorates and the characteristic
physical signs -of tuberculosis of the lungs are present. Even in this stage
of the disease, however, instances -occur in which neither the symptoms nor
the signs reveal the true nature of the affection, and the correct diagnosis
is only reached after radiographic examination.
Disability.
Uncomplicated silicosis is not characteristically a disabling disease in
either the first or the second, stage. The majority of the men affected with
the first stage of the disease do not complain of any incapacity for carrying
on their work, nor do they present any signs indicative of -such incapacity.
The same may fee said of men suffering from the second stage of uncom-
plicated silicosis.
These men, however, are damaged in so far as they- are more susceptible'
to an infection with tuberculosis. Among 123 men affected with silicosis,
38, -or 31 per cent, were found to have -become tuberculous. Among 6D3 men
unaffected with silicosis, 16, -or 2' 7 per cent, were found to be tuberculous.
These figures express the increased risk to which sufferers from uncom-
plicated silicosis are exposed. When the tubercular complication super-
venes, a definite disability soon appears. This disability is bound to appear

sooner or later if the tubereulo-silicotic individual continues working at a
dusty process in the industry. There is every reason to expect that under
such circumstances a fatal termination will eventually ensue'as a result of
the tuberculosis.
Simple Pulmonary Tuberculosis.
Fourteen men were found to be- suffering from, simple or uncomplicated
pulmonary tuberculosis. These included. 6. stonemasons, 1 quarry-man and
7 rockehoppers and sewer miners. Gf this total, 6, viz., 4 stonemasons,. 1
quarryman and 1 sewer miner, had worked in the Sydney district only.
The- ages of these 14 men are shown in. the following table, viz; :

Clinically these men, presented; a. picture of uncomplicated- pulmonary
tuberculosis*, no evidence of damage to. the. lung by dust being- found by
radiography. According to the investigations which the- committee were
able- to carry, out, only 2, of these-men. suffered from, the disease- in, its
■‘open.'’ or infectious form.
A comparison is made ini the following; tables of the incidence-of tuberr

The numbers available for examination are small and no definite opinion,
can be based upon them.
Mes who .have Worked foe Two Years ok Less is Silica is the Svosey
District.
One hundred and forty-seven men. were examined who bad worked for
two years or less in silica in tie Sydney district. These men have been
classified separately, because the presence among them of silicosis could
not be attributed to their work in sandstone in the Sydney district. Of
these men, 15 were classified as stonemasons, 4 as quarrymen, and 128 as
sewer miners or roekchoppers. Among the 15 stonemasons, one man was
found to ho suffering from silicosis in the first stage. He had worked for
eighteen months only as a stonemason and for eleven years as a quartz
miner at Bendigo.
Among the 128 sewer miners, 7 men were affected with silicosis, 4 in the
first stage, 1 in the second stage and 2 had silicosis with tuberculosis; 15
men had simple pulmonary tuberculosis.
The 7 men affected with, silicosis gave histories of work in silica, in the
Sydney district for periods ranging from six mouths to two years, and of
work in quartz mines elsewhere for periods of seven and a half, ten, twelve,
twenty, twenty-two, twenty-three and twenty-seven years. It is clearly
justifiable to attribute the silicotic condition found in these men to their
occupation elsewhere than in the Sydney district.
The 3 men with simple pulmonary- tuberculosis were aged 42, 45 and 54
years, and had worked for one year, seven years and thirty-three years
respectively in silica elsewhere.
Dust Coxditkws.
The services of Ur. Badham, State Medical 'Officer of Industrial Hygiene,
were made available to the committee by the Director-General of Public
Health, Hew South Wales. He had already investigated the atmospheric;
conditions under which the sewer miners, and those employed in the railway-
tunnels under construction, worked. The result of these investigations have
already been placed before the State Arbitration Court.
Dr. Badham has made certain investigations of the atmospheric condi-
tions under which stonemasons and quarrymen work. As these conditions
vary very muck in different places and also in different parts of each
stonemason’s yard or quarry, and are affected considerably by weather
conditions, particularly air-movement, a very large number of observations
will be necessary before any definite conclusions can be drawn from the
results of the investigations.
The clinical evidence obtained by the committee in regard to stonemasons
and quarrymen cannot at the present time be co-related with the result of
the tests so far obtained by him. The committee is of the opinion that
this extremely valuable work of investigation of the dust hazards by atmos-
pheric tests should be continued, since it is likely to provide the basis for
preventive measures which may be adopted at a later date in these two
occupations.
