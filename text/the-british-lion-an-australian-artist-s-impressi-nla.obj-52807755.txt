The British Lion.
An Australian Artist’s Impressions
of London.
BY CHARLES NUTTALL.
London.
Earth has not anything to show more fair;
Dull would he be of soul who could pass by
A sight so touching in its majesty;
This City now doth like a garment wear
The beauty of the morning; silent, bare,
Ships, towers, domes, theatres, and temples lie
Open unto the fields and to the sky;
All bright and glittering in the smokeless air.
Never did sun more beautifully steep
In his first splendour valley, rock, or hill;
Ne'er saw I, never felt, a calm so deep!
The river glideth at bis own sweet will:
Dear God! the very houses seem asleep;
And all that mighty heart is lying still!
—Wordsworth.
The policeman on the crossing holds up
his hand, and the whole world stands still.
The bus-driver flicks an imaginary fly
from the policeman’s shoulder with his
whip, and the guardian grins an acknow-
ledgment of the salute. But the bus re-
mains stationary, and the other vehicles
in line “ stand at ease,” awaiting the mo-
ment when the policeman shall lowei his
semaphore hand, and traffic shall resume
its course. London is well drilled, and
the drill-master is not Fear, but Acquies-
cence. Everybody smiles, everybody
makes way, everybody’s rights are respec-
ted. And this is the spirit of England,
the power and the glory thereof.
The pigeons of St. Paul’s coo and flutter
fearlessly among the feet of the crowd
that moves up and down Ludgate Hill,
Children come to the open space before the
great cathedral, bringing rice and bread-
crumbs for the birds. The tall bobby
who stands there takes a benign interest
in the pretty scene; busy men in top-hats
pause a moment to watch the laughing
youngsters and the eager doves. And I,
♦First of a series of travel sketches written
and illustrated for “
standing beside a column near the tall
entrance-door of that hoary temple, look
out upon the bustling turmoil of the street,
see the well-controlled traffic, the easy-
moving, quiet-voiced people, the pleasant-
faced representative of Law and Order,
the merry children and the birds in that
flagged oasis, and 1 reflect that here also
is shown that spirit of personal freedom,
the kindly, acquiescent courtesy which
marks the conquerors of the world, whose
hearthstone is London, capital of the
greatest Empire that the world has
known.
Within the vast cathedral the pillars
rise in tall shafts whose forms are lost in
the umbrage of the domed ceilings. Down
the long perspective of the main aisle, soft
light and brown shadow blend to the mass
of a perfect whole, the lit altar shimmer-
ing faintly at the end. Deep, swelling
organ-tones base the music of the Gre-
gorian chant, and white-robed acolytes
follow in the steps of the staled and mitred
priests who lead the day’s procession.
Hush, pomp, peace, stability; the soul
of the Nation, the life of the Nation, the
desire of the Nation are expressed here.
At right and left, lining the walls, stand
monuments and sarcophagi of the glorious
dead. I see the battle-rent flags of a hun-
dred wars; I hear the tramp of armies,
the sound of many trumpets, the charge
of countless legions, the thunder of the
captains and the shouting. Warriors,
martyrs, poets, artists, sea-fighters—with
the mind’s eye I see them pass in splendid
array down the long aisle of this, their
noble tomb.
Here the countryman, the slum-dweller
and the noisy American tourist tread
softly and speak in low tones, awed by
the solemn dignity of this poem in stone,
supreme triumph of one man’s mind. ,4
wonder whether he knew —the great artist'
who conceived this work —whether tria fine


imagination saw and enveloped the lordly
whole as it stands in completion; whether
he beheld the wide, lighted spaces, the
clustering, transparent shadows, the dim
glories of the gilded and painted ceilings,
the quiet impressiveness of the high altar,
distant far from the entrance, gleaming
pale among the shadows at the end of the
columned avenue, the main aisle.
The oak-tree and the British eoat-of-
arms do not typify the Nation as this
building does. Stately, not haughty;
splendid, not garish; quiet, not suppressed,
breathing dignity, power, confidence, ease.
When Wren erected
this, his masterpiece,
he did not cry from the
dome, “ Behold the
thing which I have
made!” and the nation
paid him no great tri-
bute of praise. He
did his work well, and
let it go at that.
Enough for him and
for them that the work
was good. It had to
be good!
In the same spirit,
latter-day England ex-
pects her sons to pio-
neer and to police the
world, with axe and
plough, with fire and
sword. In the far
corners of the earth
they go half-mad with
fever and loneliness;
their bones lie bleach-
ing in every jungle and
desert the world over.
England expects that
every man will do his
duty, not for money,
not for fame, but for
duty’s sake alone.
Of this great army of
the unpaid, or badly
paid, Mr. Thomas At-
kins is a shining ex-
ample. He is a fresh-
faced young man in a
trig, well-fitting uni-
form. Igo into Hyde
Park and watch the
drilling of him. Tommy fights for duty,
eightpence a day and his beer. He has
no fears for the future of the Nation; he
knows that there are other nations —
Frenchers and Germans and Dutchies and
such —but he does not regard them highly,
and he almost wishes that they would dis-
play some aggressive activity, and thus
give him something to do —a man
grows stale who does nothing besides
courting nursemaids and drilling in
the Park!
Tommy passes me in the street, pipe in
mouth, cane in hand, his girl on his arm.
He is jaunty and care-free, ruddy and

vigorous; his jacket fits tightly across his
sturdy shoulders and his swelling chest.
He is not righteous or witty or wise. He
does not think, or he would not be a
Tommy; he cannot act upon initiative, but
he can fight when he is told to do so; he
goes cheerfully to battle as his fathers did
before him. In his blood are qualities of
courage and tenacity which make him
more terrible than the Roman soldier of
old, who invaded Tommy's country, and
met Tommy’s forbears, the fierce bar-
barians who followed Caractacus and
Boadieea.
This is a fighting
race, strong in defence
of, and demand for, its
rights. Just now the
women —or some of
them —are aggressive-
ly clamant, calling for
the right of franchise.
The militant suffra-
gette is a part of the
day’s pageant in Lon-
don; everywhere one
hears and sees posted
the words of the slo-
gan, “ Votes for Wo-
men,” and every day
some demonstration is
made. Ten thousand
women marched to
Hyde Park last Satur-
day. So did I, but not
in procession. The
paraders were dressed
in white; they carried
devices, flags and ban-
ners of many colours.
The spectacle was
beautiful, but the faces
of the insurgents were
not noticeably so. In
fact —but stay, O foun-
tain-pen, thou’rt in-
clined to babble! Be-
hind a banner in-
scribed “ Men who de-
mand justice for wo-
men,” walked a strag-
gling crowd of those
whom the banner de-
scribed as Men. They
wore side-whiskers for
the most part, and they seemed to suffer
keenly under the gibes of the spectators.
Among the lookers-on was an ’Arry man
who had broken his pledge. He had a
slogan of his own, which he repeated with
high emphasis at frequent intervals. It
was, “Blokes for Women!” 1 looked
long and earnestly at that white stream of
down-trodden women, trying to discover
a pretty face in the ranks. And lo! I
went away disappointed and sorrowful,
and straightway lost interest in their
noble Cause. For lam keenly susceptible
to Beauty, and easily depressed by
Beauty’s opposite.
