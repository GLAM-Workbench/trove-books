, W S ‘ N ’ Hog ' 8 > who for 23 years
he!d ihe posiuon of m anager , of * ®
bank of New South Wales at Balmain
is writing a book on the
ough of Balmain. An interesting feature
will be short biographical sketches of
’s


Balmain Past and Present.
Mr. S. N. Hogg has kindly al-
lowed us to publish his paper,
which will be read by the people of
Balmain with great interest. The
same will appear in serial form. 1
Let us first consider briefly what
Balmain now is, but before doing
so I wish to refer to a remark made
by a very able writer, and still
, abler speaker, one whose name is
familiar to all, Cicero, who lived
2000 years ago. This renowned
orator very justly remarked in one
of his essays entitled “ Public
Offices” that “every scheme and
purpose of life needs the assistance
of men.” If therefore such an
able writer did not hesitate to avail
himself of the knowledge others
possess, I have felt no scruples in
gleaning, orally, from many elderly
people in our midst much of the
information I have to give you to-
night. Indeed, I fear that acting
for the last few weeks as a sort of
Paul Pry, or as a “ chiel amang
them takin’ notes,” I may have
been considered a nuisance, but
you will agree with me that no
better source of information can be
obtained than from those who have
“ seen with their eyes and heard
with their ears.” I have the per-
mission of these elderly people to
make full use of what they have
told me.
Other sources of information
have been old newspapers, searches
made for me in the Lands Titles
Office, an inspection of some old
buildings which still exist here as
landmarks confirming the reports
of their former uses, and the assis-
tance of our worthy Mayor, and of
many other friends in their respec-
tive official capacities, who have
willingly supplied me with dates
and facts, so that I have at all
events aimed, at accuracy, as all
historians should do.
BALMAIN AS IT NOW IS,
I*may seem to some of us who
live in Balmain almost superfluous
to say much about our suburb as
it now is, for have we not the evi-
dence before our own eyes ?
In these days of extensive read-
ing and of newspapers dealing with
world-wide subjects of interest,
we are not likely to take our own
horizon to be the boundary of the
whole world, and the gossip of the
village counts for but little. It
may be that we do not even know
accurately the population of our
own suburb. In 1861 it was 3482;
in 1871, 6272; in 1883, 16,0*3; in
1891 23,475; and it is now estimated
at 32,750.
Our worthy Mayor has kindly
supplied me with the following
facts, which I think will interest
all ratepayers. The numbers of
electors liable to be rated is 7628.
The number of electors who have
paid rates and are entitled to vote
is 5335, 70 per cent, of the 7628.
The estimated capital value of all
rateable property in “poor Bal-
main ” is very nearly 1 millions
(viz. £3,918,430). The total rates
in 3 904 were £13,617, which are
only exceeded by those of North
Sydney, 15,678, and the unim-
proved capital value of land in the
municipality is £1,204.372 (again
only exceeded by North Sydney
with its £1,694,305). I gather from
official records that the deposits
in our local branch of the Barrick
street Savings Bank approximate
£94,000, a larger amount than in
any other suburb of Sydney. The
number of dwellings and shops,
etc,, on sth February, 1906, was
(6542, namely 6032 inhabited, 350
uninhabited, and 160 shops and
stores without residence attached.
In 3901 the average number of in-
habitants per occupied house in the
municipality was 5T9'.
We hav a lo lamps in Balmain,
59 mik malted footpaths, 21


miles footpaths formed only,' and
76 miles kerbing and guttering,
and the total estimated value of
improvements is £80,313.
One of the things that make
Balmain differ from the other
suburbs is that it is not merely a
residential quarter, but it has in-
dustries and factories, docks,
wharves, and a harbor of its own.
Probably it was only the accident
that Sydney Cove was a little
nearer the Heads than Mort’s Bay
that gave the priority of settlement
to Sydney in the first instance,
but however that may be, there
can be no question as to the splen-
did position occupied by Balmain,
or its wonderful progress as an in-
dustrial centre. Our industries
are so numerous that it is impos-
sible to refer to more than a very
few, and in a short paper like this
I can only speak of those which
come most readily in my mind,
and not necessarily the most im-
portant.
MORT’S DOCK AND ENGINEER-
ING CO., LTD.
Here in our midst we have a ■
Company in a position to deal with ;
a total tonnage of 26,000 at one ■-
time. They have a large graving •
dock at Balmain, with two slips,
' and two floating docks at John-
I stone’s Bay. They have also a
I large graving dock at Woolwich,
600 it, long, and a floating dock
there also. Unfortunately this
Company employ only about 700
bands, which is loss than were at
j work there -0 years ago, but the
! manager, Mr. Franki, tells us that
with the latest machinery available
Mort’s Dock could keep in employ-
i merit 2000 workmen if only protec-'
tion to the extent of 25 per cent.
I was imposed, to recompense the
| Company for payment of wages 8<
| per cent, higher than obtain in the
j old country. , ,
It may not be uaiAf I T'l
to fov words 'about one ni
Balmain’s noblest sous. Thomas
Sutcliffe Mort.
At the close of an eloquent ser-
mon preached at the Congrega-
tional Church, Pitt-street, Sydney,
on 19 May, 1878, I find that the
Rev. J. Jeffries, L.L.D. delivered
himself as follows :
“ I praise this brother of ours
that beyond graceful spending and
charitable giving, he used his wealth
chivalrously , even in the production
of other wealth. He invested his
means in enterprises that appeared
to him most likely to promote the
general good. He believed in the
conquest of the forces of Nature,
and in making thein minister to
wants of man. He believed, as we
do, that Australia is capable of
supporting untold millions, and
that all genuine material advance-
ment will prepare the way for the
settlement of a contented and
happy people.
“ He built a dock for ships and
a foundry for forging iron, and
workshops for the construction of
engines. But I reserve for the
last what I deem to be one of the
truest life lessons to be gained
from the career of Thomas Sut-
cliffe Mort —he promoted the union
of capital and labor. With many
hundreds of working men engaged,
he is said to have not made an
enemy. The feelings of reverence
for his memory is not confined to
leading citizens ; it extends to the
working men of the city and to the
inhabitants of the whole colony.
Not referring to docks in the im-
mediate neighbourhood, but of
those in the municipality, I must
mention the one owned by the
family of the late Captain Rowntree
and one by Mr. Drake, whilst
among ship-builders the names of
Morrison and Sinclair are rapidly
coming to the front.
Then we have in our midst a
Comnany of world-wide fame of


) winch we may well be proujf'l
young Company that has not ye
attained its 21st. year, a Compan}
having its headquarters near Liver
pool, England, with branches in
the United States, Switzerland,
Belgium, Africa, Germany, Canada,
and in Balmain. It is a company
that is progressing in Australia by
leaps and bounds, that employs 40
per cent, more hands than it did
three years ago, and whose motto
must surely be “ Energy, progress,
success.” I refer of course to
Lever Bros., Ltd. At the head of
this firm is Mr. W. H. Lever, who
was comparatively speaking a poor
1 man 20 years ago, but who is now
| a millionaire, and a member for
Whirrall in the Imperial Parlia-
: ment*
Another large industry is that of
Elliott Bros., founded many years
ago by the Istte Dr. Elliott, and
now firmly established as one of
the big concerns of the State,
giving employment to a large
number of hands in our suburb.
Among engineering works may
be mentioned the young enter-
prising firms of Poole and Steel,
Overall and Overall, Foster and
Minty, and of Montney and Co.,
who have lately moved over from
Pyrmont.
Time will not permit me to do
much more than remind you of our
coal mine, piercing the earth by
two shafts to a depth of 3000 ft.,
only exceeded in depth, I under-
stand, by a few other mines in Bel-
gium, a Company whose pluck and
dogged perseverance command the
respect and admiration of everyone
in Balmain, and the universal hope
is that success may some day
! crown their efforts.
1 From the “ Balmain Banner ”of
4th August, 1906, I extract the
following information ;
“ The Balmain coal mine was
started in 1894 with half a million
capital, and is progressing steadily
towards completion. The site
covers five acres, and the area of
the Company’s working concession
about 11,000 acres,
U A great claim is put forward
for the' colliery should coal be
raised in sufficient quantity —it
wall hold a unique position as re-
gards shipping. The distance from
the pit’s mouth to the quay wall is
less than 100 yards ; the largest
ships coming to the port can be
berthed close to the pit’s mouth,
and by automatic screening and
delivery by telescope shoots, cun
be rapidly and safely filled, and all
this can be done with better des-
patch and economy than in any
other part of Australia. The
courage of the men who have per-
severed in this long, costly, and
arduous work is magnificent, and
without impugning the value of
the services of those at present in
charge of the mine, the name of
of Mr. J. L. C. Rae as one of the,
pioneers will long be remembered
in Balmain.”
Our new Sugar Refin
man Bros, and Co, will relieve
many of the unemployed in Bal-
mair,, giving—them h mos-t—work.
They have a capital of £30,000 in-
vested in land plant and buildings.
The partners in the 'firm are the
sons of the late highly respected
Frederick Poolman. Many old
members will remember him as the
manager for many years of the
Colonial Sugar Co. at Pyrrnont,
associated with Mr. Knox.
We have in our midst the
Working Men’s Institute, pecu-
liarly adapted to meet the tastes
and habits of residents of a suburb
preeminently industrial in their
modes of livelihood. By the
courtesy of their secretary, Mr.
Lewis, and of their president. Mr,
Goodsir, I have been supplied with
the following facts.
The Institute was founded on
21st May, 1865, very nearly 40
years ago. The first ,office bearers
/ (ft) J
(o*ll kvfCi-
< &l**" <n*M cru-f jf**#
-r sxjJT u/


were, President, E. W. Cameron ;
Trustees, Rev. A. Mansfield, and
Messrs. John Booth, and H.
Perdriau. Two rooms at the rear
and under the present Oddfellows’
Hall were rented at 6s. per week,
and 96 members joined the .first
quarter. The number of members
now on the roll is about 700. The
site on which the present building
stands was purchased in 1887. and
the first portion—ground floor—
of the present edifice erected the
same year. In 1903 the building
was added to, and again in 1896,
and finally in 1903 it was com-
pleted as it now stands. The In-
stitute is of a nature which cannot
fail to commend itself to those who
avail themselves of the rational
amusements so necessary in a
working community. Mr. Irwin
A. Lewis has been secretary con-J
tinuously since 1882, and he tells
me that the Institute is flourishing
most satisfactorily, and that they
have now 5000 volumes in their
circulating library.
ANGLICAN CHURCH.
The earliest official records in
connection with the Anglican
Church in Balmain go back to the
10th. March, 1843, when the Rev.
Frederick Wilkinson M.A., was ap-
pointed minister of the united
parishes of Balmain and Ashfield.
On Ist. January, 1845, the Lord
Bishop of Australia laid the foun-
dation stone of a church and
school-house to he called “ Bt.
Mary the Virgin ” on a site given
for the purpose by Michael Met-
calf, I believe, but am not quite
sure, that this was in Adolphus-
street. On Ist. January, 1848, the
Rev. F. Wilkinson appears to have
had a curate under him of the
same surname, and from this date
the name of the church appears as
St. Mary ’s. On Ist. January, 1849,
the Rev. F. Cameron. L.A., late of
Marsfield, was licensed as minister
of the church ofßt. Mary’s. Un-
less this gentleman’s likeness
greatly misleads us, he must have
been a man of striking personality,
aristocratic hearing, and marked
ability. On Ist. July, 1855, the
Rev. William Stack, 8.A., after-
wards Canon Stack, was licensed
as minister, vice Rev. C. F. I).
Priddle, transterred to Liverpool.
After a pastorate of 16 years Canon
Stack’s useful life was abruptly
closed. He received a telegram
from Walgett, informing him that
his son was lying there dangerously
ill. He hastened to see him, but
the coach he was travelling by was
capsized, and the Canon dangerous-
ly injured. He died on 14th June,
1871, the same day that the acci-
dent occurred. After having pro-
phetically preached his last sermon
from ch * St John “ 1
have ■py»ae£ecr fc uie work which
thou gavest me to do.” It was in
Canon Stack’s time that St. Mary’s '
Church was added to and greatly-i
improved. I have in my posses-
sion a list of some of the names
of people who subscribed towards
the funds 50 years ago. Here are
a few of them ; E. W. Cameron.
Thos. Perkins, Alex. Stuart, Dr.
Evans, J. C. Cohen, W. Howard,
James Looke, Captain Deloitte, Mr.
Fitzhardinge, John Booth, and
Henry Perdriau, Father T berry
(£25). On 22nd. September. 187 i,
Rev. Henry Archdall Langley was
licensed as minister. He resigned i
nix years later, and died as Bishop
of Bendigo only a few months ago.
The Rev. T. B, Tress succeeded Mr.
Langley, and remained in charge
of the parish for live years. He
was followed on 16th. June, 1882,
by a cousin of the late Bishop of
Bendigo., the Rev. Mervyn Arch- ;
•dall, M.A., now Canon Archdall, '
who is still with us,
(To bo Continued.) j




On 26th. December, 1874, on the
p°6tion of the Rev. H. A. Langley,
a license was granted, for St.
Thomas’, Balmain West. The
first minister Avas the Rev. Win. F.
B. Uzzell, and the present pastor,
the Rev. John Dixon, Avas licensed
on Ist. December. 1887. I am re-
minded that from Ist. July, 1879, to
December, 1880. the Rev. Geo.
Brown had charge of the parish,
and that six years, (viz.) from
Ist March, 1881, to 31st October,
1887, the Rev. E. D. Madgwick,
was the incumbent.
At St. John’s, Balmain North,
the first minister was the Rev.
Robert McKeon, licensed 23rd
October, 1883, and the present
pastor, the Rev. W. J. Cakebread,
received his appointment on 11th,
April, 1901, succeeding Rev. W. A.
Charlton, no\v of St. Barnabas’,
Sydney.
THE PRESBYTERIAN AND CON-
GREGATIONAL CHURCHES.
An interesting interview Avdth one
of bur oldest Presbyterian divines
elicited the following information,
which I have added to from othei
sources
“ I arrived in Sydney on Christ-
mas day, 1852, by the sailing ship
‘Hydaspes,’ and Avas 113 days on
the passage. I acted as chaplain on
board. The passengers Avere free
emigrants who had been employed
by the Government in the construc-
tion of the neAv Parliamentary
buildings, London, and were allowed
a free passage with their wives and
families as a mark of favor by
the Home authorities.
“ I understand that at a consider-
ably earlier date the late Dr. Lang
had arranged for religious services
here in a small- wooden building,
Avhich still stands at the corner
of Darling and Cooper-streets, and
that this building Avas known as :
‘Dr. Lang’s Church.’ Tradition I
nas 11 mat me first .Presbyterian
minister who came here at Dr.
_ Lang’s instigation was the Rev.
Mr. Collins, and that the manse
ij°r minister s residence in those days
was in Queen’s Place, at the back of
r where Mr. Hunter’s bakery now
£ stands, in the house lately occupied
\ by the late Mr. Daly, pawnbroker.
1 On week days the church was used
f as a public school, and at night
time it served as a school of arts.
“ The population in those days
was very small, probaly less than
1400, for a census taken a few
years earlier, in 1846, shows that
although Balmain was then, as now, !
one of the most populous suburbs of
Sydney, there were only 1337 people
in it, wdiilst the population of
Sydney was, not 400,000 as it is
now, but only 38,356, so that the
population of the whole of Sydney
when I came here first was only t
6000 more than that of Balmain
at present. 1
“ For some reason religious ser- |
vices among Protestants appear to
have been discontinued in the year
1853, when I first came to Balmain,
and the property above referred
to had fallen into the hands of
the Hon. S. D. Gordon. In 1853 1
was inducted by the late Dr. Ross,
Congregational minister of the Pitt-
street Church, and by the late Mr.
John Fairfax, proprietor of the
‘ S.M. Herald,’ to commence the
ministration of the. Gospel in the
small church vacated by the Presby-
terian body (Dr. Lang’s Church).
It was thought that if Presbyterians
and Congregationalists united re-
ligious services might be renewed
Atith success. This hope Avas realised
and the congregation increased
largely, so much so that in 1855 the
present Congregational Church at
the corner of Curtis-road and Dar- .
ling-street, Avas erected. Mr.
William Burt, of Jane-street, of
‘i IrYYI <VW»i<»vTffi*ilaTnil nnr li nr nrr. i?ri4-nn , *




tjcuiiuuu, WaW T “Llio ULiiidci, cixj.ll liL IS
still alive. As time went on, how-
ever, the early traditional training
of the adherents composing this
mixed congregation led to disinte-
gration, and to desire on the part of
a large number of the congregation
who had been brought up as Presby-
terians to form a church of their
own, governed by their own church
rules. I, tlieir pastor, had also been
born and bred as a Presbyterian,
whilst Dr. Ross and Mr. John
Fairfax, my patrons, were Congre-
gationalists. Swords were crossed,
|and the bulk of the congregation
walked out with military honors. A
camping ground was found in
Darling-street, opposite Stephen-
etreet, and a small weather-board
church was built by Mr. Schulz out
of hardwood timber brought all the
way from Hobart. This building is
in Darling-street, exactly opposite
Stepheh-street, and though shorn of
its steeple, and with a shop in front
of it, still has the appearance of a
church, and is in a state of fair pre-
servation, testifying to dura-
bility of Tasmanian timber. Exactly
opposite the church, in a building
now occupied by Mr. Dickson,
chemist, stood the drapery establish-
ment of Mr. John Murray, who even
in those early times interested him-
self in church and Sunday-school
work, as he still does nowadays.
“ The disrupture was not fatal to
either congregation ; the Congrega-
tionalists continued their services
successfully, whilst the Presby-
terians soon found the small church
in Darling-street inconveniently
small, and in 1867 the foundation
stone of their present fine edifice in
Campbell-street was laid by Mr. JV
D. Stenhouse M.A., and on 19m
April, 1868, it was opened by the
Rev. A. N. Mackray, M.A. (of Dob-
' royd.)
“ Before quitting our mention oi
the Presbyterion Church at the
jt corner of Hroadstairs and Darling
I streets, it is interesting to know that
a part of the pulpit was made from
timber recovered at the Gfap,. Wat-
sons Bay, from the wreck of the
“ Dunbar,” at Sydney Heads. This
pulpit was afterwards, I understand,
'•presented to the Presbyterians at
i Rozelle, and was used by the old
church there in the Rev. Mr. Grim’s
) .
time.
“Mr. William Burt, of Jane-street,
was the builder of the stone work
. of the new church in Campbell-
street, and Mr. Schulz carried out
the carpentery and joinery work.
The land upon which the church j
stands was presented to the Presby-
terians by Mr. John Gordon, an.
adherent of the old church in Dar-
ling-street, who lived in and owned
i “ Garryowen,” now called Callan
Park. Mr. John Gordon’s brother,
the Rev. T. A. Gordon, was the first
minister, and was the first to preach
in the new church. In 1869, the
Rev. T. A. Gordon left Balmain for
Inverell, and the Rev. Colin
M’Culloch was inducted on Ist.
November of the same year. Three
years later, viz. on 20 May, 1872 the
Rev. James Cosh M.A., commenced
his ministration in Balmain. After
a pastorate of 27 years, Dr. Cosh re-
tired from the ministry of Campbell-
street church on 30th September,
1899, having been appointed Hunter
Baillie Professor of Hebrew, at St.
Andrew’s College. He died on 20th
September, 1900, at Turramurra.
Dr. Cosh has left his mark for good
on Balmain. He was a kind and
sympathetic pastor, eminently wise,
a no mean order with
his church officers, tactful, thought-
ful, and hard working. Many who
are now men and women feel that
they owe much to his sympathetic
interest in their lives. To many of
us “ though dead he yet speaketh.”
It is said of him that he knew the
Christian name of every child in his




wiio ttieir parents were.
When the good man yields his breath
(For the good man never dies)
Bright beyond the realms of death
e&o the Land of Promise lies.
“ The present pastor of the church
the Rev. J. F. Blair, arrived from
Glasgow, and was inducted here on
2nd. February, 1900. He preached
a very eloquent sermon shortly after
Dr. Cosh’s death, and said, inter
alia: —
What a rich compound of fine
qtialities Dr. Cosh possessed ! A
Christian gentleman in mind and in
manner, in thought and feeling,
word, and action. It is good, as
Scripture enjoins, to mark such a
man. His example is a moral force,
whose influence every one feels.
Like gravitation it acts silently and
without ceasing. There is an eleva-
ting power in the mere presence of
a man of sound religious principle,
virtue radiates from him ; while he
lives his light shines before men,
and when he dies his memory is
blessed.
Oh who would live if only just to breathe
Thi* idle air, and indolently run
Day after day life’s sickly offices,
And mean return of joys.
But to be a guardian good on earth,
Still to employ the mind’s brave ardour
On heoric aims, such as will raise us
O ’er the grovelling herd, and make us fit
To live —that is life.
CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH
A. mystery shrouds the early days
of the Congregational Church here
so far as dates concerned. We have
seen that the present Congregational
Church building was erected in
1855, and this I have confirmed by
a reference to Mr. Burt, the builder,
who is quite clear on the point.
But the first Church records in pos-
session of the present secretary, Mr,
Diddle, state that on 26th. November
1858, a meeting was held to form a
Congregational Church. What oc-
curred between 1855 and 1858 can
only be a matter of conjecture, or
for further research by some more
experienced antiquarian.
The Rev. Thos. Arnold was in the
chair at the meeting in ’5B, and
among those present were Mr.
Samuel Gould, Mr. John Keep, Mr.
Josiah Mullens, Mr. F. Parsons, Mr.
E. Ramsay, Mr. E. Rowe, and Mr. F.
Saddington. The meeting was suc-
cessful, and the Rev. Thos. Arnold
was appo’nted as minister of the
new church on 23rd December,
1858. He held office for only a few
months, and resigned in 1859. For
three years the records are silent so
far as any fresh appoinment is con-
cerned, but on 19th July, 1864, the
Rev. J. G. Fraser M.A., A.D., a*
cepted a call. ur. eraser is no
1 warden of the Congregational!
Training School known as Camden^
College. He resigned his charge ol|
the Balmain church in 1872, anc
was succeeded by the Rev. Samue.
Hugh Roth well, who died a fen
years later. Then on 30th. January
1877, the Rev. A. G. Fry received £
call, and remained here for nine
years, being succeeded on 14th.
September, 1887, by Rev. A. J
Griffiths. In 1890, Mr. Griffith*
left Balmain for Croydon (N.S.W.)
and the Rev. Walter Mathison fron
Katoomba was appointed to fill hi*
place. Mr. Mathison remained here
for about five years, and then left
for Croyden, being followed by the
Rev. Henry Gainford, a son of the
well known and highly esteemed
Rev. Thos. Gainford, who for so
many years had charge of the
1 Seamen’s Mission, Queen’s Wharf,
Sydney. The present minister of
the church, Rev. M. L. Johnson B.A.
■arrived in Balmain from Adelaide
on Ist. Julv. 1905. ~

METHODIST CHURCH.
In collecting the earliest records i
in connection with this church, I
have been kindly assisted by Aider-
man W. J. Laws. Writing to that
gentleman, on 13th. August, 1894,
the late Mr. Ebenezer Vickery re-
marks, inter alia, that in the year
1842 he first visited Balmain, ac-
companied by Dr. Leichhardt, the
explorer, who was botanical tutor at
a college where he, (Mr. Vickery)
was a pupil. The visit was of the
nature of a picnic, and to collect
botanical specimens. In that year,
Mr. Vickery goes on to say, there
was only one landing place, only
one house on the top of the hill, and
just a few small shanties. He does
not think the population was large
enough in 1842 to make it at all
probable that any religious services
were held here at that early date,
notwithstanding the fact that to his
knowledge a band of Methodists
(Messrs. Pidgeon, Roseby, Jones,
and others), were in the habit, only
two years later, of visiting the su-
burb and holding cottage meetings.
In those very early days, Mr.
Vickery was one of the committee
of the Wesleyan Sustentation Society
and in October, 1845, a vote of six
bibles, 12 testgjnents, and 12 spel-
ling books f&rcarried for a school
to be established at Balmain. Mr.
Colledge was the first superinten-
dent, and was appointed in April,
1846.
I have also before me a letter
written by the abovenamed Mr. John
Colledge, dated Bth May, 1876, ad-
dressed to Mr, Joseph Watkin of
Balmain, from which we learn that
the first Wesleyan minister in Bal-
main was the Rev. W. B. Boyce, and
that the clmrch in Darling-street
'east was built in that year. Pre-
vious to this period, I gather from
other sources that services had been
lield in 3atchett-street, in a small
building still standing.
In the Wesleyan Church changes
of ministers take place much more
frequently than among other de-
nominations, and in a short paper
like this I can only write cursorily
on this and other subjects, and am
reluctantly compelled, to remain
silent with respect to the numerous
offshoots from the mother churches
of all denominations at Balmain east.
But that the Wesleyans at Balmain
have had among them from time to
time very able men, is made evident
from a letter written by Mr. Joseph
H. Watkin of Victoria, who for very
many years was connected with the
Darling-street East Church. His
intimate acquaintance for a long-
series of years with Methodist
preachers in Balmain enables me to
supply the following list, each name
having as an affix an adjective which
Mr. Watkin thinks conveys to some
extent their special characteristics or
gifts. Many of these names are
known to us as those of able colo-
nists in other walks of life. The
names are presumably in chrono-
logical order, viz., the saintly
Hessell, the learned Hurst, the scien-
tific Martin, the apostolic Robone,
the precise Mansfield, the stately J.
W. Fletcher, the versatile Braizeley,
the genial Gaud, the sparkling
Rigby, the philosophic Curnow, the
rhetorical Kelynack, the zealous
Clark, the evangelical Lamb, the
IV




practical Uliapinan, the original
Watkin, the cultured Fisher, the
analytical Firth, the scholarly
Fletcher, the wise Woolnough, the
large-souled Lane, the fatherly
Caldwell, the level-headed Meek, the
logical Fox, the unassuming Bourne,
the vigorous Sellers, the kindly
Stephenson, the gentle Moore, the
eloquent Wehh, and the clever Rodd.
To this long list may now he
added the names of P. J. Stephens,
Parsons, James, Newman, W.
Stewart, Nolan, Oaks, and the pre-
sent ministers, Messrs. Rogers,
Cocks, and Willard.
ST. AUGUSTINE’S
The old church of St. Augustine’s
is a land mark in Balmain, ancfl
was built as far back as the time on
the late Archbishop Polding. A
new church is in course of erection,
but the affectionate regard of the
Roman Catholic community for a
building where their fathers be-
fore them worshipped, and where
they worshipped as children, will
not permit of its demolition, at
present at any rate. The fact that
arch-priest J. J. Therry —the father
of the Australian priesthood—
passed his last days as pastor of
St. Augustine’s, lends an interest
to the old church. St. Augustine’s
has counted among its pastors since
the death of arch-priest Therry,
the late Rev. George Dillon, the
Very Rev. Dr. Forrest, Monsignor
Carroll, and Dean Healey, The
old building with its extremely
narrow windows and miniature
tower is still standing. It is a
small structure of stone, and from
the outside view has suffered but
little from Time’s defacing finger.
But the noble structure now in
course of erection will quite eclipse
it. It will be two feet wider and
three feet longer than St. Patrick’s
Church, Sydney, and will cost
over £7,000. ■?'
The parish priest here now is
Father Rohan, who is very popular
among his own people and highly
respected, not only by Roman
Catholics, but by Protestants also.
BALMAIN HOSPITAL.
That Balmain would evolve from
a quiet residential suburb into an
important industrial centre, must
have been foreseen by thoughtful
observant men far earlier than the
year 1885. But several severe ac-
cidents occurring at that time
brought home to these men the re-
sponsibility that their gifts of fore-
sight entailed. Their minds
reasoned in this way : if accidents i
so often occurr now when Indus-
tries are comparatively few, how
much more frequent will they be-
icome when these industries have
increased fourfold? If erstwhile
quiet sylvan retreats already ring
with noisy hammers, how much
more will they ring when Balmain
has become a busy hive of indus-
tries ? If the population of Balmain
s now in 1885 20,000, what may
wo not expect it to be in the future?
From deductive reasoning such as
this arose, in well regulated minds,
the determination to make provi- ]
sion at least for present disasters,
and to set an example to those> who
would come after them, by ac-
auiring a freehold with cottage
thereon, for the erection thereafter
i of a hospital for the proper treat-
ment of those among them who by
the very nature of their avocations
were liable at any moment to be
stricken down and severeiy injured
■ by the careless handling of some
huge iron plate, or scorched by too
close an approach to sparks flyi g
from molten metal, or maimed by
from some dizzy height. &
1




cottage hospital materialised frornf
these thoughts, and was formally!
opened on 10th August, 1885, by
the then Premier of the Colony,
Sir Alexander Stuart. The first
officers were: Jacob Garrard (pre-
sident), John Tomkins (hon. trea-
surer , G. F. Poole (hon. secretary).
The first medical officers were Drs.
0. S. Evans, O. F. S. Evans, C. U.
Carruthers, and L. G. Davidson
(father of the Dr. Davidson now
here). The following gentlemen
formed the first committee, Aider-
men S. Briggs, W. M. Burns, Geo.
Clubb, and Messrs. Jas. McDonald,
J. Cameron, Ellis Robinson, John
Murray, J. W. Breakwell, and C.
G. Cameron.
From time to time the hospital
has undergone improvements and
extensions. There are now 28 beds
and the total number of people
treated last year was 2244, the
total number of attendances and
outdoor patients being 11,824, and
the number of accidents 1271. Our
hospital is said to rank fourth in
the metropolitan area in the at-
tendance of outdoor patients.
But the considerations which led
to the inauguration of the hospital
are still potently at work The
finger of progress still significantly
points omvard. The same ques-
tions again arise, and history re-
peats itself ; If the population has
increased since 18b4 by nearly
10,000, what will it not do in
another 22 years? If our industries
have increased in magnitude so
marvellously since 1884, what will
they not be in 1928? The com-
mittee are therefore —in the humble
opinion of the writer—quite right
in seriously considering the ad-
visability of again adding to, and
greatly improving and modernising
the present building. They may
be quite sure of the loyal support
of the residents of our suburb, as
evinced from the experience of the
■nnst. for is it not a fact that only |
; £I9OO has been so far received fron
the Government as a special vote
that the freehold has been paid for
and that the necessary heavy ex-
penditure for its up-keep has been
maintained from private subscrip-
tions, added to only by the usual
Government subsidy of £ for £.
The last annual reports
office bearers as follow : President,
D. H. Easton (since resigned and
succeeded by Mr. H. A, Scott), vice-
president, G. C. Murdoch (since
deceased and succeeded by Mr. A.
G. Crump(. With reference to Mr.
Easton’s connection with the hos-
pital it is interesting to note that
up to the end of 1905 he held
office, in one capacity or another,
for the whole course of the hos-
pital’s existence, and strangely
enough in this way, seven years as
auditor, seven years as committee-
man, and seven years as president.
The present committee are,_ G.
Boulton, J. Goodsir, Alex. Smith,
Aldermen W. J. Laws and H. B.
Swan, Messrs. F. Lovett and R.
Wane, and Dr. Davidson. The
: present medical officers are Drs.
Carruthers, Davidson, Sinclair
Finlay, Guy Menzies, and J. B.
Mcllroy ; hon. consulting surgeons,
: Drs. R. A. Wilson and T. Harding;
hon. dentist, H. H. Froude ; hon.
auditors. R. Steward, D. Sinfield,
and J. Sims ; hon. treasurer, W.
Druce ; hon. secretary, E. B. Shaw;
matron, Miss Herbert; paid medi-
cal officer, Dr. S. Shirlow.
BALMAIN BENEVOLENT

from the same minds, the Benevo-
lent Society may also be looked
upon as the trained nurse of the
hospital, valuable, nay almost in- 1
dispensable, as an assistant to the
doctor —the hospital. The meta-
phor is the more complete when it
is remembered that the work is al-
most entirely carried on by ladies.
With the exception of our presi-
dent, the Mayor of Balmain, and
the hon. treasurer, the committee
consist entirely of the gentler sex,i
with Mesdames Broomfield,
McDougall, and Bracegirdle as vice
presidents, and the indefatigable,
strenuous Mrs. Nelligan as hon,
secretary.
Among those who attended the
first meeting may be mentioned the
names of our member in the House
of Representatives, Mr. W, H.
Wilks, Mr. W. C. MacDougall—
who has always been a good friend
of the Society —Mr. W. M. Burns —
at that date Mayor of Balmain —
Messrs. Geo. Clubb, Geo. E.
Young, Walter Beavis, John
Atkinson, T. Hooper, Father
O’Reilly, and many others.
That the Balmain Benevolent
Society is imposed upon occasion-
ally goes without saying, but at
the same time there is an honest
endeavour on the part of those con-
ducting it to distribute the funds
placed at their disposal so that
they may relieve the real distress
and want which exist. Relief is
afforded by means of half-crown
orders for provisions, and such
have been distributed to an amount
aggregating £BOOO since the in-
auguration of the Society. To visit
the sick, to comfort the distressed,
to dole out food to the
well, but what the writer and
every thoughtful man feels is that
it offers no remedy for the cause

mediable suffering, only through
better laws strictly administered
can effectual help come.
THE BANKS.
Prior to 1875 there was no Bank
in Balmain, and people had to
cross over to the city with their
money, but in that year two tried
their fortunes here, the Bank of
Australasia, and the Bank of New
South Wales. Later on, in the
eighties, the A. J. S. Bank made a
short sharp struggle for standing
room, in Beattie-street, but so un-
successfully that it retired. The
Bank of Australasia commenced
business in a small weatherboard
cottage with garden in front in
Darling-street, close to Stephen-
street, between Mr. Down’s, the
grocer’s and Mr. Dickson’s the
chemist’s. This cottage has only
been pulled down within the last
few weeksffc It had a small room
jutting out from the front veranhah:
here it was that the first cheque
was cashed in Balmain, but who
the drawer was, and whether he is
still alive, I cannot say. The
manager was Tom Cranstone, £> a
young man straight from Scotland.’
But the Bank found little to do,
and witndrew, not however, before
they had educated Balmain folk
into the advantages of banking
locally, and as Mr. R, E. A,
Wilkinson, accountant of the Head
Office of the Bank of New South
Wales, lived over here in Happy
Valley, they pleaded successfully
with him, and a branch of his
bank was opened on 17th May,
1875, in the building now occupied
by the Savings Bank, opposite Mr.
1 Hunters, the baiter's. me nr Sr
account opened was that of young
Mr. John Murray, draper, fol-
lowed by those of a few other
3




youths, viz., Messrs. Henry Jesson,
William Cox, J. C. Waterman, and
two young men named Alexander
Bowen, and Alexander Gow. The
first manager was Mr. G. V. James,
and the first accountant Richard
Stack, colloqualiy known as Dick
Stack, son of Canon Stack. Mr.
James was here for only a few
months, and was succeeded by Mr.
John Tomkins, a tall, delicate-look-
ing man of aristocratic features,
and a long silky black beard,
which however, became grey enough
poor fellow, before his death from
heart disease in February, 1888.
Mr. Tomkins was deservedly res-
pected, notwithstanding his some-
what reserved and austere man-
ners. His successor, the present
manager, received his appointment
on April fools day, 1888, notwith-
standing which sinister date he
has retained his position for nearly
20 years. On 16th November,
1903, the fine building now stand-
ing was first occupied.
The English, Scottish and Aus-
tralian Bank was opened here on
15th December, 1883, in one of the
“ Match-Boxes ” hereafter referred
to : the site is identical with that
now owned and occupied by Mr.
H. A. Scott, the reader of tJiis
paper. The first manager was
Robert Finlayson, who was suc-
ceeded in July, 1885, by the pre-
sent respected manager of the
Bank, Mr. William Druce, who on
that day commenced business in
the new building now standing at
the corner of Mort and Darling
streets.
The New South Wales Savings
Bank commenced business in Bal-
main on Ist December, 1902, with
Mr. Hibble as manager in a build-
ing adjoining the office of the
Balmain Observer.” On Ist
January, 1904, they removed to the
building previously occupied tor so
many years by the Bank of New
South Wales, and which they pur-
chased from that Bank.
OUR FERRIES.
Thirteen years ago the fares to
Balmain were 3d each way. But
on Ist January, 1000; a new com-
pany commenced to run : it was a
co-operative concern, and the hearts
of the people went out to it, for
was it not to be their very own, and
the fares only one penny ? The
first directors were Captain Napier
(chairman), with Messrs. Butement,
W. C. MacDougall, J. A. Oag, J,
Roderick, and H. J, Wise. After
an exciting struggle, the new com-
pany triumphed completely, and
then absorbed the old one. The
war between them will be long re-
membered, when rival boats
raced one another from wharf to
wharf, when party feeling ran
high, when the newspapers, the
“ Leader ” and “ Observer,” fought
fiercely with ink and pen, and
local poets ironically sang praises
to an old broken-winded paddle
boat owned by the new company
and styled the “ Millie,” “ Here’s
to sweet Millie of blushing 16,”
when the boys of
the sport, and crowed lustily as
the boat they were patronising out-
distanced its competitor, and when
women and children screamed as
the steamers, running at full speed,
approached perilously near to one
another.
The new compapy commenced
with three steamers, the “ Lady
Napier ” capable of carrying 450
[passengers, the “ Lady Mary ” 400,
*and poor old asthmatic “Millie”
(of sweet 16) 200. In addition to
the above the company now have
the “ Lady Hampden,” 636 passen-
gers, the “Waterview” 580, the |

torates in tire Amending Act ofTba I,
Balmain was joined with the Gleje, I
and was represented in the thi:i
-parliament by John Campbell, i j
the fourth and fifth parliaments b*
Thomas Ware Smart, and in tin'
sixth, seventh, eight, and ninth byi
George Wilgram Allen, who became
Minister of Justice and Public In-,
struction in the Parkes Administra- 1
tion from 1873 to 1874, and waif 1
elected Speaker of the House for the*
eight, ninth, and tenth parliaments. a
The Act of 1880 created Balmaii ,
a separate electorate, and its firs"
member was Jacob Garrad, who was'
justly regarded as the first Labor*
representative returned to
merit. Under the provision of what t
is known as the expansive clause ofi
the Act Balmain secured two mem- 1
hers in the next parliament, Jacob
Garrard and William Alston)
Hutchinson; the number was in-''
creased to three, and then fouri
members in the two
parliaments, and the
thus elected were Jacob Garrard, J,
S. Hawthorne, S. H. Hyam, F. J. 1
Smith, and George Clubb. The\*
election of the 15th parliament in
1891 resulted in the return of four
Labor members for Balmain, viz.
James Johnstone, W. H. Murphy,
G. D. Clarke, and E. Darnley.
By the Act of 1893 the principle i
of single electorates was established, j
the number of members was reduced
'to 125, and the redistribution of
seats and determination of boun-
daries were vested in Commis-
sioners. Balmain was accordingly
formed into two electorates, Balmain
North and Balmain South, and for
the 16th, 17th, and 18th parlia


• Me Mel " 580, the “Lincoln” 400,
“Lady Manning,” “Lady Rawson,”
“Lady Northcote,” besides many
others purchased from Mr. Henley.
The company have lately acquired
by purchase several pleasure re-
sorts. Their shares, paid up to £l,
are now quoted at £2, their last
dividend was 10 per cent., capital
£30,000, reserves £5240.
BALMAIN POLITICALLY.
In regard to parliamentary re-
presentation, Balmain had no di-
rect representative until the tenth
parliament, elected in 1880; prior
to then it was incorporated with
other electorates. Under the law
of 1843 creating the first joint
nominee and elective Council, Bal-
main was probably included in the
City of Sydney, represented suc-
cessively by Dr. William Bland
and Robert Lowe (afterwards Lord
Sherbrooke).
By the Electoral Act of 1851 t
Balmain was joined with Glebe,
Camperdown, O’Connell Town,
Chippendale, Redfern, Surry Hills, j
Paddington, and St. Leonards, in j
forming the electoral district of the
Sydney Hamlets, the members
elected being Thos. Ware Smart
and Alexander Stewart Donaldson.
During the .first two parliaments
under the Constitution Act establish-
ing responsible government, Bal-
main remained as a portion of the
Sydney Hamlets, whose members
were Daniel Cooper (elected first
Speaker) and Alexander Stewart
Donaldson (the first Premier, who
was subsequently succeeded by John
Campbell.) I
By the re-arrangement of elec-
Up?
ments the elected representatives
were respectively W. FI. Wilks and
S. J. Law. For the 19th parlia-
ment S. J. Law and John Storey
were returned. Mr. Wilks having
been returned as our representative
in the Federal Parliament.
Another revision of the electorates
and a further reduction of members
to 90, having been adopted, Balmain
and Rozelle were made the elec-
torates, and Walter Anderson and
S. J. Law have been returned as the
sitting members.
EARLIEST RECOLLECTIONS OF
BALMAIN.
(By one of the oldest residents veri-
fied as far as possible by official
maps, &c.)
“ Briefly recounting at your re-
quest my earliest recollections of the
appearance of Balmain, I find that
I can only go back 65 years, viz. to
the year 1841 ! At that time I was
quite a young man, an apprentice
on the brig “ Fulmar,” and had ar-
rived from England via Tasmania.
Our ship had brought out general
merchandise to Launceston, and
came on to Sydney in Ballast. We
anchored in Darling Harbour, which
was not then known by that name,
but was called “ Cockle Bay.” The
captain had been made a present of
a native bear, and was very proud of
it. He was anxious to keep it alive,
and take it home as an Australian
curiosity for his friends, and for the
young wife he had left in England.
My first visit to Balmain was made
under the captain’s orders, with a
view to obtain gum leaves for his
favorite. I was accompanied by
5




another boy; we pulled over the
ship’s boat, and moored her to a
stump of a tree somewhere at the
foot of Petersham Hill (which you
people now call Darling-street.)
“You ask me to tell you what
was the native name of Balmain ?
Well, I am sorry to say, I cannot
remember, nor can I discover it for
you from old records. But the
earliest plan of survey is by John
Meehan, surveyor, dated June, 1812,
on which plan Balmain is shown as
“Gilchrist’s Place” in the Parish of
Petersham, and is known as No. 183
in that parish. I inspected also for
you the first parish map of Peter-
sham, a very old tracing, and I find
there that ‘ Water view Bay ’ is shown
as ‘ Grose Bay.’ The only native-
names in connection with Balmain
and its neighbourhood I know of are
“Biloela,” now known as Cockatoo,
and the stream between Long Nose
Point, at the foot of Louisa Road,
and Kerosene Bay, or rather the out-
let of the Parramatta and Lane Cove_
i \ ■■ ■
rivers, which was known in those
days as ‘ Yeroulbin,’ or ‘the fast
running waters,’ and that probably
accounts for the fact —as you tell me
—that more than one house in that
part of Balmain is called‘Yeroul-
bin.’ * f
“ With respect to Cockatoo Island
I enclose for your information an
account of the Island in the early
forties, which narration is of course
not original.
COCKATOO ISLAND IN 1848.
This natural hulk is situated
about two miles above Sydney, just
where Port Jackson narrows into a
creek called the Parramatta River,
and about a quarter of a mile from
either shore. Here is all that re-
mains of that stupendous machinery
f which from first to last has intro-
duced into and diffused through
( these colonies not less than 60,000 of
Great Britain’s offenders, and hy
whose agency it may be said that
this great fifth portion of the globe
has been redeemed from the savage
and appropriated to the Europeen
family. The isle is a triangular
form,' about 400 yds. long by 280 in
width. It contains at present about
300 prisoners under conviction for
offences committed in the colony,
or expirees from Norfolk Island.
Many of these ore regular incurables
doubly or trebly convicted. These
prisoners are employed in quarrying
stone and laying down a clear and
spacious wharf around this rugged
isle, so that a few sentries can com-
mand the entire circumference.
They are moreover engaged in the
useful work of excavating a dry
dock, a convenience that does not
at present exist in these colonies.
The establishment is admirably
adapted both by nature and art to
its purpose. Nevertheless many
I desperate attempts to escape were
made in my time. One wretched
man flung himself into the water
loaded with chains, and being a
powerful swimmer had got nearly
j 100 yards from the pier before the
: sentry perceived him. Disregard-
ing the soldiers’ shouts and threats,
the man swam steadily onwards,
upon which the sentry fired, and the
wretch instantly sank, and the body
was never found. Sharks in search
of offal from the slaughter houses
< i haunt this part of the harbour, and
6




act as an efficient cordon. The
great curiosity of Cockatoo Island is
the siloes excavations in the solid
rock, shaped like a huge bottle, 15
or 20 ft. deep by 10 ft. wide, with a
narrow neck closed by a stone cap-
sule luted with plaster. About a
dozen and a half of these siloes,
filled in time of plenty with grain,
were intended as a reserve for food
for seasons of famine, which have
more than once befallen the colony.
It was a monopoly for the public
benefit, but the plan was discoun-
tenaced and disallowed by the home
authorities, I suppose it might inter-
fere with agricultural interests. These
excavations were afterwards used to
conserve a supply of fresh water for
the island. Some of them are still
in existance, and the sites may be
readily traced.
“ Such was Cockatoo Island in the
latter forties, when Fitzroy ruled the
land, and gave his name to the dock
mentioned, above, and since eclipsed
by its big neighbour the Sutherland.
There is still a penal establishment
there known to us as Biloela, but
the prisoners are only weak phan-
toms of their fierce and unruly pro-
totypes, drunk and disorderlies, no
visible means, &c., with a sprinkling
of short time thieves, larrikins, and
such like gentry, many of them old
decrepit folk of both sexes, who hail
the gaol more as a refuge than a
place of punishment, an asylum
where regular meals and enforced
cleanliness and a fair amount of
work enable them to regain in part
their shattered health before once
more appearing in society.
“But to return to Balmain proper.
As we pulled our boats towards the
sliore, the chits seemed to me much
higher and more precipitous than
they now appear, and instead of
houses and chimney stacks, and gas
lamps, and docks, and other evi-
dences of civilisation, I saw nothing
but bush, bush everywhere. There
was sufficient gum trees to enable
us to provide for our mission, but if
I remember aright the trees were not
tall and straight, but rather of the
nature of shrubs (ti-tree prevailing
I think). Wild flowers grew in
abundance, native roses, waratahs,
and rock-lillies being much in evi-
dence, as also (what interested us as
boys much more) geebungs, five-
corners, ten-corners, and wild mul-
berries. In those early days there
were, too, plenty of birds in our
suburb, wood-pigeons, gill-birds,
quails, various species of parrots,
&c., &c., and also, I am sorry to say,
any amount of snakes, slow-worms,
and bandy-bandies. Had my cap-
tain been generous enough to allow
me to take a holiday and roam over
the foreshores, and further up the
hill among the gullies towards
Happy Valley, there can be little
doubt that we could have added
wallabies, bandicoots, and native
cats to his menagerie, but this we
were not allowed to do.
“I do not remember seeing one
solitary house in Balmain, in 1841,
but in this, you tell me, my memory
must have failed me, for it is on
historic record that the very first
steamer that ever plied between
Sydney and the North Shore was
built in our suburb by a Mr.
Budevent in the early forties, and
was used for the transit of horses
7




and vehicles from Sydney to Billy I
Blue’s Point, North Sydney.
,£ I need hardly say that the
Cockle Bay of 1841, the year I am
speaking of, was a very different
looking place to the Darling Har-
bour of to-day. To me, indeed, it
seems as though the stretch of water
between the city and Balmain had
shrunk considerably, and perhaps
it has so in reality by the wharves
on either side encroaching on the
fair way. In those days we could
beat a good sized vessel up the bay,
a feat which I should not care to
undertake now, even if I were a
young man. Darling Island too,
midway between Sydney and Bal-
main, towering up to the sky with
its high cliffs, was I remember an
island in reality, at all events when
the tide went out.
“You may possibly find the fol-
lowing extracts from an old paper
in my possession of interest and
assistance to you in compiling your
paper. They are from the * Echo
of 23rd April, 1890 It will be
understood however that I am not
keeping myself strictly to the text,
but am adding to it from other
sources, notably from G. R. Addi-
son’s Political Pamphlet of 1877.
It may easily be conceived that
when Governor Phillip and the
officers and other educated men who
arrived Avith him in the first fleet,
decided that Botany Bay was not a
suitable spot for the settlement,
their disappointment was very keen.
The beauties, and the fauna and
flora AAdiich had so strongly im-
pressed Sir Joseph Banks, made
. very little impression on them. They
took a decided practical, utilitarian
view of the matter. A week after
the first landing at Botany Bay, the
.little colony was removed to Port
Jackson, and the duty of exploring j
and opening up the country was \
vigorously proceeded with. The .
peninsula of Balmain was one of the
first places which attracted atten-
tion, hut the visitors do not seem to
have been very strongly impressed
:with its appearance. It is described
as being covered with a dense ti-
tree scrub, through which some
gum trees straggled and struggled
up towards the sun. The shores
were rough and rocky, and the rocks
< were covered with brambles, and
[native currants. Further explora-
tion showed that the point (extreme
east end of Balmain) was admirably
adapted as a trap for kangaroos, and
it became the custom of the sporting
men to go out and drive a mob of
kangaroos from the Plain where
Leichhardt and Ashfield_ now are,
down to the Point. This accom-
plished, the best marksmen stationed
themselves at the narrowest part of
the Peninsular, about where the
Bowling Green now is, to shoot the
animals as they were driven back
by the beaters. & ■ •
On 26th April, 1880, the Point,
containing 550 acres, was granted
by Governor Hunter to Dr. William
Balmain, surgeon of a ship from
Calcutta, as a reward for medical
services rendered to the colony. (So
that the medical fraternity here may
claim, through one of their repre-
sentatives, to have first owned the
suburb, and we arrive at the con
elusion that Dr. Balmain was the
. first vnpiTirfl.l man in Balmain).

r—
“ London Gazette ” dated 29tt
March, 1806, makes known that
the King has been pleased to grant
unto the said John Gilchrist there-
on assignated of Camberwell in the
County of Surry, L.L.D. late Pro-
fessor of the Hindustanee language
in the College of Fort William,
Calcutta, the Royal license to use
the surname of Rothwick in addi-
tion before his surname of Gil-
christ. It would appear therefore
that he was not a Doctor of
medecine.


This gentleman’s practice, however,
could not have been onerous or re-
munerative, for he sold on 7th July,
1801, the whole of his interests for
ss. to Dr. John Gilchrist, Professor
of Hindustanee at Calcutta, and our
suburb was actually known for some
time as Dr. Gilchriit’s place. (So
that tne second Doctor here was Dr.
Gilchrist.) From this gentleman a
part of Balmain passed into the
hands of a\ English financial com-
pany, and other portions were sold,
from time to time for prices which
now appear ridiculously small. (On
26th October, 1830, 4 acres 12 per-
ches at Peacock’s Point was sold by
Dr. Gilchrist for £264 17s. 6d.)
For many years Balmain was only
a fishing ground for the blacks,
and picnic ground for whites. The
shores .were covered with mussels
and cockles (whence probably the
name ‘Cockle Bay’for Johnstone’s
Bay), and people went out in boats
from Sydney to gather them, whilst
the children were delighted to hunt
for native currants, geebnngs, &c.
The first settlements were near
Peacock’s Point, and the Needles,
where Mr. Budevant and Howard
and Alderman Looke built boats,
and -it was Mr. Budevant who built,
just where Mr. Beattie’s ship yard
nqw is, the first steamer that ran to
North Sydney. The first houses
were built by a Mr. Bass, on the
point opposite Goat Island (Mee-Mel)
and in very early days Balmain was
decidedly a fashionable suburb. It
Among our very early residents
were Captain McLean (superin-
tendent of convicts), Cantain
McLeod, who built Waterview 1
House, still standing in Waterview
street, ana captain iMcholson, xiar-
bour Master), whilst Captain Perry
[Surveyor General), and Mr.
[Brennan of Garryowen were other
early inhabitants. The first house
of any size, if not the very first
house erected in Balmain, was
built by Captain John Nicholson
R.N. The Earl of • Limerick built
and lived at Glanworth House,
now owned by the respected widow
of the late Captain John Broom
field.
The first road surveyors were
Captain McLean’s cows, and
Darling-street represents the course
taken by them on their way tc
Leichhardt, where grass was plen-
tiful. Later on Beattie-street was
formed, to cut off a huge bend ir
the main street, and it was namec
after a butcher, about whom ai
interesting little gossip is recorded
which however I am not going t(
repeat.
I had an interview with the
chief draftsman of the Land Office,
[who very kindly obtained for my
inspection a private map kept in
his own room. This map is by
Lieutenant John Septimus Roc
:R.N., and is dated 1822. On this
jmap the island now known as
Cockatoo is shown as “Banks
Island,” and the island known as
Goat Island is shown as ‘Cockatoo’.
The Iron Cove near Leichhardt is
shown as “Iron Stone Cove,” and
the water lying between Millers
Point and Darling-street is shown
f as Cockle Bay.
With respect to native names,
Goat Island was known in 1841 as
“ Mee-Mel,” that no doubt being
the aboriginal name, and there
werp, pven thpn snmp. buildings
9




erected there. Mee Mel, I learn
was used as early as 1836 for th(
storage of military ammunitior
and merchants’ explosives, and the
buildings were covered with whai
was then bomb proof roofing
although it is evident enough thai
it would afford but little protec-
tion at the present time for a con-
centrated fire by modern weapons
Though only semi-military ir
character, the island was garrisoned
up to 1868 by a detachment of Im-
perial troops. The last corps tc
act there as guards was the Royal
Irish, I asked a lady residing on
Goat Island now to let me know
the number of the present inhabi-
tants, and to say particularly what
sort of people they were. Her
answer tickled my fancy vastly,
all the more so, because I do not
believe she intended to be
funny. Her reply was this, “ I
find there are 50 people on the
island, and only one goat.” But I
am wandering from my subject.
In 1851, Captain T. S. Rowntree
settled in Balmain, and purchased
a piece of land from Mr. Morgan,
chemist, Sydney. He joined with
the late Mr. T. S. Mort, under the
name of Rowntree and Co., in con-
structing on his property the first
floating dock, which was opened in
1854. (It will be understood that
I am adding to the quotation from
the “ Echo ” considerably).
My friend Mr. Schulz (who I
hope will be present to hear your
lecture) tells me that the first
steamer to be placed in the dock
here was called the “ Hunter,” and
it was docked on 12th February
1855. The dock was then less than |
half its present size, and was j
managed in those days by the late
Captain Rowntree, and another old
friend of yours and mine (Mr.
Mackenzie, boat-man at the foot of
Darling-street) assures me that the
workmen of the dock lived in tents
between Cameron-street, and the
present engineer’s shop.
He speaks of a market garden on
the shores where Mort’s Dock
Works now stand, and can point to
a stone cottage owned, when he
was a boy, by a Mr. Wignell, fisher-
man* who had a wonderful pond,
there, where he had collected all
sorts of fish, and even young
sharks. It appears, too, from what
our old friend “Mac” says that a
creek ran down from the top of
Mort-street, and joined the harbour
where the dock now is, and that
this creek supplied the inhabitants
with drinking water. He tells me
that that portion of Balmain
between Darling-street and Mort’s
Dock was called in those days
“ Stratheen,” and that the streets
were not formed, although there
were tracks leading from the main
street through the scrub to various
points on the foreshores
Mr. Marsh, our C. P. S., informs
me that we have now between 40
and 50 policemen in Balmain. In
those days them was only one.
His name was "M’Caskie ; a dry
old Scotchman was M’Caskie,
canny enough too it would seem,
for I hear still, dim echoes of wild
days and nights at the Burnbank
Hotel, kept by a Mr. Tennent, but
now owned by Mort’s Dock Co. and
used as an office in connection with
.... ... <■ - f
10




Jubilee Dock. M’Caskie always
knew when to keep at a distance
from the Eurobank Hotel when
the young officers from Sydney
were over there.
My lecture to you about Balmain
seems to bristle with “ Macs.”
Besides old Mackenzie the boat-
man I have gathered further in-
formation for you from another
Mac, Mr. Arthur Mackenzie, who
has lived in the same house in
Reynolds-street continuously for 60
years. This Mackenzie has no per-
sonal recollection of course of Dr.
Balmain, nor of Dr. Gilchrist, but
he has of Dr, G. R. Elliott, and of
Dr. Harpur, and still more so of
Dr. 0. S. Evans. Of the latter the
two Macs' (indeed all old residents)
speak in the very highest of terms.
They tell me that Dr. Evans was
immensely popular. Able in his
profession, kindly in his disposition
and essentially manly and straight
from the shoulder in all his words
and actions—a healer of the sick
not only by training and education,
but by instinct and by nature, the
name of 0. S. Evans is engraven
on the hearts of all old residents,
even more abidingly than it is on
the stone walls of the Balmain
Cottage Hospital, of which he was
one of the founders, and where a
ward is very justly named after
him. Of Dr. Evans the words of
our Australian poet Lindsay
Gordon are very applicable, viz :
Amidst this world of froth and bubble
Two things stand out like stone
Kindness in another’s trouble
And courage in our own.
Poor Dr. Evans’ end was a very
sad one : the horse he was driving
bolted with him from the corner of
Beattie and Darling streets, where
Bank of New South Wales now
stands, and the vehicle coming in
contact with the kerbing opposite
the Congregational Church, the
Doctor was thrown violently out
on to it. His son, a promising
young medical man, since dead,
and his son-in-law, Dr. jCarruthers
were quickly in attendance, but the
accident proved fatal. Dr. Evans’
death came as a great shock to the
community where he had lived so
long and had been looked up to
whenever accidents or sickness oc-
curred That this strong man should
himself be stricken down and need
help seemed an unnatural horrible
thing. Doctors should never be ill
and only die long after they have
ceased to work.
Of other medical men no longer
among us, the names of Drs. Bott
and Graham are also remembered
with affection by grateful patients,
who owe their lives to their skill
and care.
The Mackenzies have a recollec-
tion—or think they have—-of sol-
diers marching prisoners down
from the foreshores of Balmain
opposite Cockatoo, through Birch-
grove scrub to the foot of Darling-
street, from wiience they were con-
veyed by water to the city. These
unfortunates, heavily, manacled,
formed a melancholy procession,
(an(T were tne recipients ot much
pity, and the cause of much curio-
sity, Trom the residents who gazed
at them from doors and windows
as they passed along.
Old Mackenzie, the boatman,
tells me that the first steamer to
11




run to Balmain is believed to have
done so in 1840, and to have beer
named the “ Experiment,” owned
by the Parramatta Ferry Co. She
ran, he says, from Deloitte’s wharf{
Miller-street to Pearson-street.
which extended at that time down
to the water. She was an old,
broken down paddle boat, and had
a wooden plug in the top of the.
steam chest which “
blew up ” when the pressure wad
too strong, and to prevent this old
Mackenzie tells me that a boy was
engaged to sit on the chest! It is;
not recounted what became of thf
boy, but it is evident Mac was toe
much of a Scotchman to sit ther<
himself, or he would not be sitting
as he still is so often, at the Dar
ling-street wharf. Boys must have
been pretty plentiful in those days
unless indeed Mac has been trying
to take a rise out of us by his tale!
which I expect is the case. This
steamer, the “Experiment,” onl)l
ran on Sundays and holidays. In
1842 the late Mr. Henry PerdriaU
purchased the “Waterman,” buj
she was not a success (perhaps
they could not get a boy to sit or
the chest). She ran for a time
from the Gas Works to the foot o
Darling-street. A little later, ir
the early fifties, Mr. Samuel Crook
the son of the Rev. Pascoe Crook
who had an honorable record ii
the very early days of the Colony
and was your grandfather, com-
menced a service by steamer from
the city to Balmain. Mr. Samue.
Crook resided in a stone villa just
above the water near Stephen-
street ferry: the property now
belongs to our townsman, Mr. J. A
Oag, and its ruins still exist
testifying to its original strength
In those days Dickens’ novel called
\ l Bleak House ” had just beer
published, and Mr. Crook callec
his villa by that name. It hac
wonderful internal doors opening
>oth ways, covered with greer
>aize and studded with brass nails
A beautiful garden, too, in terraces
stretched down to the water’s edge
o the beach opposite where the
Cubilee Dock now stands. Mr
brook’s erstwhile sylvan retrea-
nidst crag and rocks, with its rustic
garden and cultivated flowers grow
ing side by side with native ones
has T now been converted by th
ruthless hand of Time into a busj
3ommercial wharf where ships un
load timber. What will not tha
wharf be when your bearers are a;
bid as lam ? Who can say ?
“ Concluding my long letter t<
mu on this subject, I may sa?
hat it has occurred to me tha
perhaps the young people presen
nay like to know the fate of th<
mtive bear which induced my first
dsit to our suburb. Well, youh£

limself a true patriot, a strict pro-
ectionist, a native-born Australian
—he would have nothing but his
;um leaves, and refused the
hoicest viands as “ imported
übbish.” He died repeating
12




eloquently Scott’s immortal lines: —
Breathes there a bear with soul so dead,
?hat never to himself hath said,
?his is my own , my native land &c.”
ANOTHER OLD RESIDENT
SPEAKS.
After this long account from our
ancient friend, I propose to give
you a much shorter one from
another old resident, who by the
way is very anxious to preserve
his incognito. He speaks as
follows “ My early recollection
of Balmain is not a pleasant one.
I was arrested there on or near the
Pigeon Ground. Accompanied by
a number of young fellows on good
ponies, I was galloping through the
main street and trying to keep up
with them, when a big, brawny
Scotch policeman gave chase. My
mates kissed their hands to him
and soon galloped out of sight
on their fleeter steeds, but my
pony (which was a little wvetch and
very fat) knocked up, and though
I welted him with what remained
of a short stick that I held in my
hand, and dug my heels into his
sides for all I was worth, I could
not get him out of a trot; indeed
I remember that he had the effron-
tery to nibble at the grass which
grew along the road. Trying to
escape by cutting across the
Pigeon Ground, I was soon bailed
up by the policeman, who in Scotch
brogue demanded my name and
address. With an excusable men-
dacity I promptly replied, “ John
Smith Robinson of the Billybong
Swamps, North Queensland ” (a
place I had never even heard of).
I n he policeman made a carefuLnot'e'
n his book of both name and
address, and then let me go, saying,
.31“ Gang awa’ hame noo, ye muckle
loon, but ye’el hear of me in the
EA marnin’.” Well as that is now
14,600 mornings ago (or in other
words 40 years) I begin to hope
that he may have forgotten about
“ the muckle loon.” But as lam
5* the father now of a large family,
a church officer, I hope you
will not mention my name.
Yet another old resident of Bal-
main (not the gentleman who was
arrested, but one who has been in
Balmain just as long) is Mr. Alfred
Hancock, This gentleman may
indeed be fairly regarded as the
father of that portion of Balmain
in which he still resides. His
quaint little cottage and office is
surrounded by a goodly garden in
the heart of our populous suburb.
Mr. Hancock tells me that when
he made his first purchase of a
-block of land at the corner of
Darling road and Weston road,
opposite where the Rozelle Post
Office now stands, he did so for ss.
per foot, and people thought he
was a crank. It is doubtful now
whether Dr. Bott, its present owner
would take less than £45 per foot.
At that time the Balmain Naval
'Brigade, with Lieutenant Q.
■Deloitte at his head, and with Mr.
Hancock and Mr. Sommerville as
privates under him, used to fire
from Dick’s Hotel to the butts,
which stood near where St.
Thomas’ Church now stands, and
Mr. Hancock has a distinct recol-
lection of a rifle bullet whistling
13




past his ear and nearly putting an
end to his cogitations and his life,
at the very time when he was
viewing his lately acquired pur-
chase. It is not surprising to learn
that after this little incident the
butts were moved further away,
and the firing aimed towards the
water in the direction of Callan
Park,
As late as 1870, Mr, Hancock tells
me he found it difficult to define
the line of Darling-street past the
present Rozelle Post Office, and he
placed stones at intervals to mark
the roadway among the scrub.
On 21st February, 1860, Balmain
was proclaimed a municipality.
Mr. Hancock was early in the
council, but not among the first
councillors, whose names were as
follow : —Ralph Mansfield (chair-
man), E. W. Cameron, Dr. Q. S.
Evans, J. Beattie, Dr. Elliott, J.
Burt, J. W. Palmer, A. W. Rey-
nolds, and Captain T. S. Rowntree,
John Booth being the first mayor
and Thos. Butterfield, or Jas.
McDonald —some one please put
me right here —being the first coun-
cil clerk. In the Town Hall they
keep an ancient rusty iron key,
which is regarded with much vene-
ration by the officials, it being
known as “ The key of Balmain.”
This key was handed over by some
one at the inception of the muni-
cipality, and will doubtless be
looked upon as an interesting relic
of the early days by generations
yet unborn, though what it is sup-
posed to really open must, we fear,
for ever remain a mystery. It
may have been the corporation
treasure chest, or the first chair-
man’s refreshment cupboard, but
antiquarians will probably rank
the question with such unsolveable
riddles as the identity of the Man
in the Iron Mask, 01 the author-
ship of the Letters of Junius.
Again reverting to the subject of
land values, it is interesting to re-
member that that portion of
Darling-street lying between™.
Booth-street and Palmer-street,
known now as “ The StrandV
was as late as 1890 covered by a
row of flimsy one-story wooden
buildings, built out of old deal
boxes, &c., and known appro-
priately as “ The match-box Row.”
Even then, however, considerable
trade was done in the evenings in
this locality. At the corner,
nearest the Park. Mrs. Hannah
McLachlan had moved up from
Curtis road, and—keen business
woman though she was—found
time unostentatiously lor many
and many a kind action to the
poor, among whom she was ever a
Dorcas.
Further, towards Beattie-street,
just where the Bank of New South
Wales now stands, Robert Loudon’s
grocery emporium stood, on the
same spot where a little later
Skelton kept the “ Coolgardie
Stores,” an iron shed, a sort of
“ Johnny-all-sorts ” shop.
In 1891 the match boxes were all
removed, not by fire as had been
confidently predicted, but of set
purpose, and on 27th June of that
year the land was sold in vacant
allotments, realising prices pro-
bably less than half the present
value of the land. (The sales
14




realised from £ls up to £26 10s.
per foot).
BALMAIN SOCIALLY.
I have made diligent search with
the hope of discovering that Bal-
main has been the birthplace of
any men of real note in the history
of Australia. lam afraid that our
suburb cannot lay claim to this
honor, unless we mention the name
of one of the greatest cricketers
the world has ever produced.
Spofforth, the demon bowler, was
born here in 1855.
But among those who have re-
sided here and have made their
mark in Australia, very many
could be referred to. I have only
time to mention two, to whom I
hope no exception will be taken by
the friends of other noted Balmain
residents. The youngest members
of our Society doubtless remember
the familiar figure of Sir Henry
Parkes, as in his declining years
he laboured up the hill from
Stephen-street wharf to his resi-
dence at Hampden Villa, whilst
those of us who are older will, I am
sure, think I am right in singling
out the name of Nicol Drysdale
Stenhouse as representing culture
and letters. At the early age of
19 this gentleman earned the
degree of Master of Arts at Edin-
burgh University. For 46 years
he practised in the Courts in
Sydney, and he resided for very
many years at “Waterview House,”
Caroline-street, Balmain. He is
described as the Maecenas of Aus-
tralian literature, and was a friend
.and naMoj2-jMJQejiiehv Lwho lived
in ms House tor a time.) Me pos-
sessed a splendid private library
which is now included in the pre-
sent University library. Two of
his books, it is said, were worth
£250 each. Old residents in the
street remember as children the re-
moval of these books and say that
14 drays were required for that
purpose alone. He was an examiner
of the Faculty of Law, and a .
member of the Sydney University,
was well known as a scholar, and a (
fosterer of Colonial literature, and
his few published works show great
power and refined laste, as well as
a profound acquaintance with clas-
sical German and English litera-
ture. He died in 1876 at Balmain,
aged 63.
With regard to men of genius,
or at any rate of brilliant wit, it
often happens that men so endowed
are not fully understood in their
day and generation. They impress
strongly, and for all time, those
with whom they come in contact,
but their friends are too supine, or
, lack the ability to commit to paper
what they have said, so that after
they are dead their light is ex-
tinguished. Have we in Balmain
ever had among us any “ Mute in-
glorious Miltons?” Certainly not,
r so far as I can discover, but we
have had at least two men pos-
-sessed of brilliant powers of re-
partee, who have passed away
without any written record of their
keen perception of the humorous,
the grotesque, the incongruous, the
' oddities of life, which make up
that strange compound “ human
nature.” These two men were
cotem poraries, co-religionists,
■ countrymen, and great friends.
15




But in every other respect,—birth,
education, social standing, calling,
—as far from one another as the
poles. One was a Roman Catholic
ecclesiastic, a profound scholar, a
man of letters, a Doctor of Divinity,
and also —if I am informed aright
—a Doctor of medecine. The other
was a Bank messenger. The priest’s
name was Dr. Forrest, Rector of
St. John’s College: the Bank
messenger’s name was Martin
Cherry, of the Commercial Banking
Co, of Sydney.
/m i _ 1 l_ A * i \
I propose to conclude my paper
by recounting one or two anecdotes
with respect to these two men
kindly supplied to me by Mr,
Alfred Hancock, who knew them
well.
I hope that Mr. Scott will be
able to repeat these tales in as
broad and humorous an Irish
accent as Mr. Hancock does, other-
wise much of their effect will be
lost.
REMINISCENCES OF TWO OF
BALMAIN’S GREATEST HUM-
ORISTS.
Dr. Forrest was Rector of St.
John’s College, a profound scholar,
and a most genial man. He was
possessed of a ready and brilliant
wit, and it was dangerous to pro-,
yoke him to repartee.
Martin Cherry was known to and
held in high esteem by all creeds
and classes, during a residence in
Balmain of nearly 40 years. He
had not the scholarly attainments
of Dr. Forrest, but quite equalled
him in ready, natural wit.
On the occasion of a picnic, a pas-
sage of arms occurred between
them, of which I give a sample
During the day the Doctor, with
eyes twinkling, said, ‘Martin, where
did you get your education?” “ Oh
Doctor,” said Cherry, “ I was in
Ireland what they called a poor
scholar.” “ Heaven help you,
child,” rejoined the Doctor, “ you
are not much better now.” “Do
you not think, Doctor, replied
Cherry, “ I should have made a
mark if I had received a college
education?” ‘Doubtless you would’
was the answer, “ your would have
been hanged long ago.”
The Doctor related a story of the
Apostles fishing, and of casting
their nets thrice without success,
and at the fourth cast they caught
a fish with coin in his mouth.
“ That must have been a jew-fish ”
instantly replied Cherry.
One of the guests, a gentleman
[ with a somewhat remarkable nasal
organ, expressing his gratification
at being present in such distin-
guished company, asked to be
allowed the privilege of taking a
glass of wine with his riverence
“ By all means, my dear fellow,”
said the genial Doctor, “ you can
take two if you like.” The guest
then proposed the health of the
Doctor in terms of high eulogy,
evoking a most courteous and witty
reply, in the course of which the
Doctor said, “My friend has praised
me too much, speaking among
other compliments of my unselfish-
ness, a quality I have little claim
to, as I shall prove by stating that
I hold it of little use having a
friend unless you make use of him,
which I propose to do of the pro-
16




poser of my health. You know,
Mr. that beautiful building
just completed in Elizabeth-street,
I mean the Synagogue?” “Certainly
Doctor,” was the reply. “ Well,
then, I have an ardent desire to go
through the budding, but you must
know that a gentleman of my cloth
and persuasion is at a great disad-
vantage unless he has a friend at
court to introduce, him. This,
Mr.— is the service I asE of
you.” “But—but—” stammered
the guest in much confusion, “X
have no influence there, Doctor.
[ do not belong to that body : I am
not a Jew.” “No?” excitedly ex-
claimed the Doctor. “ You surprise
ne. In Heaven’s name what are
fou then?” “ I am Church of
England, Doctor.” “ You astonish
ne, but give me your hand, my
tear friend, you are the most con-
sistent Christian I have ever met.”
“ How so?” questioned Mr.
“ Because,” said the Doctor, “ your
faith must be in your heart, for
the devil of a sign of it there is in
your face,”
Just another. In a conversation
with Martin Cherry, the Doctor
giving him some serious advice
said, “You know, Martin, we are
all sinners, from the Pope, kings
and queens, &c., downwards.”
“ Yes,” said Cherry, “ I know I
have been a very bad one myself,
but I can lay claim to having
always had good intentions..’
“ That’s no use,” said the Doctor.
f‘ You Irnow Hell is paved with
good intentions.” ! H don’t believe
that,” replied Cherry. “ How?
Not believe,” exclaimed the Doctor.
“ Do you dispute the teachings of
the Church?” “The Church does
not teach it,” rejoined Cherry, “it
never blows hot and cold. I have
always been taught that Hell was
a bottomless pit : how then can you
pave it?”
The End.
We are sure that we are voicing
the opinion of thousands of readers
of the “ Banner ” when we state that
the publication of Mr. Hogg’s paper
on “ Balmain Past and Present ”
has been an intellectual tit-bit to
which we have never before been
treated. It sets one athinking as to
the possibilities of their being a
literary and artistic side to the
nature of our hard-working com-
munity that only wants galvanising
into activity in order to bring to
fruition. There is plenty hole-and-
cornerism of the mutual admiration
kind amongst us to-day—the out-
come of religious divisions and
social “ sets,” but nothing in the
way of developing character and
sentiment on broard national lines ;
no attempts at the catching of the
first glints of the Austral Age that
Is coming and giving them place
and substance in picture and in
story. Mr. Hogg’s hhtorical re-
searches show that in the past |
history of Balmain there is nothing j
of which we should be ashamed, but
rather a great deal of which we may
be justly proud. It remains for us
of a younger generation to do all we
can to carry on the good work. To
bring work to Balmain—that is the i
point. To see our foreshores hum- j
ming with the hammer of industry,
our workmen well employed, their
wives happy, and their children
well fed and well educated—that is

the destined end and way to which
we are striving.
