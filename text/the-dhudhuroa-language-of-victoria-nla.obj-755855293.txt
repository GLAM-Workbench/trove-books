THE DHUDHUROA LANGUAGE OF VICTORIA
By R. H. MATHEWS
THE Dhudhuroa was spoken by the Dyinningmiddhang tribe
on the Mitta Mitta and Kiewa rivers, and along the Murray
valley from Albury to Jingellic. Minyambuta, a dialect of
the Dhudhuroa, was the speech of the tribes occupying the Buffalo,
King, Ovens, and Broken rivers, with the tributaries of all these
streams. From Jingellic eastward was the country of the Walgalu
tribe, whose speech resembled partly the Dhudhuroa and partly the
Dyirringan, a tongue spoken from about Nimmitabel to Bega. In
1902 I published a short grammar of the Dyirringan language. 1
The Wonggoa ceremony of initiation, which was in force among
the Dyinningmiddhang and Minyambuta tribes, was described by
me in 1904. 2 The initiation ceremony of the Dyirringan is fully
set forth in an article communicated to the Anthropological Society
of Washington, U. S. A., in 1896. 3
North of the Dyinningmiddhang, on the opposite side of the Mur-
ray, the country was occupied by the outskirts of the Wiradjuri
nation. As g. consequence of this, we find that the Wiradjuri sys-
tem of marriage and descent 4 overlapped some distance southerly
from the Murray among the Dhudhuroa speaking people. For ex-
ample, along a narrow strip of country on the southern bank of
Murray from Albury to Jingellic, the descent of the children is
through the mother. Among the Minyambuta the descent was
paternal, the same as among the tribes to the west and south of them,
particulars of which I have given elsewhere. 5
Dhudhuroa Grammar
Nouns
Nouns are subject to inflection for number, gender, and case.

Number. Yauara, a kangaroo ; yauaraidbo, a pair of kanga-
roos ; yauaramunga, several kangaroos.
Gender. Dyaba , a man; midla , a woman. Yauara-jutmna ,
a male kangaroo ; yauara-dyunggana, a female kangaroo. Among
birds, the cock is denoted by the postfix bendyana, and the hen by
mimmindyana.
Case. There are two forms of the nominative. When the
action is described by an intransitive verb, the noun is without
flexion; but when a transitive verb is used, the noun takes a caus-
ative suffix, as dyabungu dyaua dugge , a man an opossum killed.
Genitive : Dyabala wfingewa, a man’s boomerang; mullala
dyjidya , a woman’s yamstick.
The accusative is generally the same as the nominative, but
when an instrument is the remote object of the verb, it requires a
suffix, as dyabangu wagara wungewangu yerriadliani, a man at a
crow a boomerang threw.
The dative and ablative have their respective inflections.
Adjectives
Adjectives take the same declensions for number, gender, and
case as the nouns with which they are used : Wagara murrandoa ,
a large crow ; wagaralbo murrandoalba, a pair of large crows. The
adjective always follows the noun which it qualifies. Adjectives are
compared by two positive statements.
Pronouns
Pronouns have number, person, and case, and contain two distinct
forms in the first person of the dual and plural.
The nominative pronouns are :
f ist person I nguddha
2d person thou nginda
l 3d person he magudha
thou nginda
he magudha
~ . f we, inclusive ngulla
Dual ist person \ „
f we, exclusive ngullanaha
, f we, inclusive ngana
Plural ist person \
L we, exclusive ngana,
nganandha
The following are the possessive pronouns in the singular
number:


r Ist person mine ngaila
2d person thine nginna
l 3d person his magudt
his magudhala
Demonstratives. —This, dyimbi; that, maigadha ; that, farther,
mamaitgura; that, still farther, madhanbunga; that, away yonder,
kait-gu-nt -u-u.
Interrogatives. Who (is that), nganbandu ; who (did that),
nganbunga; who (for), ngangala; who (from), ngandung u; who
(are those two), nganbulbid; what, minyua; what, for, minyena;
how many, minyamalah.
Verbs
Verbs have the same numbers and persons as the pronouns,
with the usual tenses and moods. Tables of conjugations are not
thought necessary, but a tolerably full list of verbs in common
use will be found in the vocabulary. They are conjugated as in the
Wiradyuri language, 1 published by me in 1904.
Adverbs
Here, dyimbi; there, munya ; where, wallume; where (is it),
wallungura ; where (dual), wallumbulan ; yes, namai; no, dhubfdga ;
to-day, nyinyanga ; to-morrow, ngangara ; by and by, maiarngan ;
long ago, nungadhanambu; how (was it done), yungamimdnda;
when (was it done), nguddaganganda.
Prepositions
In front, burrin-bung'a ; behind, bunnhonga; around, gullag-
wiangga; between, tianuramanga; inside, kikago; outside, kai-
kudha; up (a river), wunbainangadha; down (a river), dyikanan-
gadha ; up (on top), gunnagadha ; this side (as a stream, rock, etc.),
dyimbiangga ; the other side (of a river, etc.), yirigama.
Interjections and Exclamations
These parts of speech are not numerous. Hold on ! kunye;
Nhe/i! I don’t know.
Numerals
One, kurdawung-a; two, biiladherabo; three, burauigo (this
also means a few, such as three or four); many, nyanda.

Dhudhuroa Vocabulary
This vocabulary contains about 235 words of Dhudhuroa, col-
lected by myself from the native speakers. Words of a similar
kind are placed under similar headings, in the hope that this classi-
fication will be found more convenient for reference than if arranged
in alphabetic sequence. It is the equivalence of English words
which will be most frequently required and therefore they are
placed first.
