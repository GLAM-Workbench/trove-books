BABY RIDING.

And have a little puppy-dog tied to her side.
And little pussy-cat tied to the other.
And away she shall ride to see her grand-
mother, to see her grandmother.
Ride a Cock-Horse.
Eide a cock-horse to banbury-cross.
To see what Tommy can buy;
A penny white loaf, a penny white cake.
And a two-penny apple pie.
Eide a cock-horse to banbury-cross.
To see a young lady on a white horse,
Eings on her fingers, and bells on her toes.
And so she makes music wherever she goes.

You shall have a plum.
You shall have a rattle.
When your dad comes home.

Pat-a-Cake, pat-a-cake, baker’s man!
So I will, master, as fast as I can:
Pat it, and prick it, and mark it with T,
Put it in the oven for Tommy and me.
Come, Butter, Come.
Churn, butter churn ! come, butter, come!
Peter stands at the gate.
Waiting for a butter-cake;
Come, butter, come!
Baby Crying:.
When Jacky’s a very good boy.
He shall have cakes and a custard;
But when he does nothing but cry.
He shall have nothing but mustard.

Dance, little baby, and mother will sing!
Merrily, merrily, ding, dong, ding!

To beat the naughty bow-wow.

Bye, baby bunting.
Daddy’s gone a-hunting
To get a little Rabbit’s skin
To wrap a baby bunting in.
Hush-a<Bye Baby.
Hush-a-bye baby, on the tree-top.
When the wind blows, the cradle will
rock;
When the bough breaks, the cradle
will fall.
Down will come baby, bough, cradle,
and all.
Hush-a-bye baby. Daddy is near;
Mammy’s a lady, and that’s very
clear.
Rock-a-Bye Baby.
Rock-a-bye baby, thy cradle is green;
Father’s a nobleman, mother’s a queen;.
And Betty’s a lady, and wears a gold ring;
And Johnny’s a drummer, and drums
for the king.
Kissing; Baby.
My dear cockadoodle, my jewel my joy.
My darling, my honey, my pretty sweet
boy;
Before I do rock thee with soft lullaby.
Give me thy dear lips to be kiss’d kiss’d
kiss’d.
Good Aislit Baby.
Baby, baby, lay your head
On your pretty cradle bed;
Shut your eye-peeps, now the day
And the light are gone away;
All the clothes are tucked in tight;
Little baby, dear, good night.
Lie still with Daddy.
Hush thee, my babby.
Lie still with thy daddy.
Thy mammy has gone to the mill,
To grind thee some wheat.
To make thee some meat.
And so my dear babby, lie still.

Here’s that funny monkey
Has put on your night-cap.

Through the pretty window pane:

Hare it comb’d now.

And though he cannot speak.
He knows whate’er I say.
Whenever I come near.
He crows for very joy :
And dearly do I love him.
The darling, baby-boy.
BABY.
He opens his mouth when he kisses
you;
He cries very loud when he misses
you;
He says "Boo! boo ! boo!” for " How

he’s loving you.

Pushing her away!
Patting with his soft hands.
Laughing in his fun;
Slapping with such good-will.
That the tear-drops run.
Do not cry, dear Annie, i
Wipe away the tear;
Keep away from Charlie,
Do not come so near;
Or his little hands will
Pull your curly hair
Peep at baby, Annie—
Peep behind the chair.
Kiss the baby, darling.
Kiss the little one;
He is only playing.
In his baby fun.

With pretty things lor thee!
There were comfits in the cabin.

That stood between the decks, i
Were four-and-twenty white mice, i
With chains about their necks. 1
The captain was a duck.
With a packet on his back;
And when the ship began to move.

Jack be Quick.
Jack be nimble, and Jack be quick s
And Jack jump over the candle-stick*
Jack Sprat.
Jack Sprat had a cat,
It had but one ear;
It went to buy butter.
When butter was dear*
Jack Horner.
Little Jack Horner sat in the comer.
Eating a Christmas pie;
He put in his thumb, and he took out
a plum.
And said, “What a good boy am 11“
Tom Tucker.
Little Tom Tucker
Sings for his supper;
What shall he eat ?
White bread and butter*
How shall he cut it
Without e’er a knife ?
How will he be married
Without e’er a wife P
Georgie Porgie.
Georgie, Porgie, pudding, and pie
Kissed the girls and made them cry;
When the girls came out to play,
Georgie, Porgie, ran away.
See-Saw.
SEE-saw, Margery Daw,
Little Jackey shall have a new
master ; [a day.
Little Jackey shall have but a penny
Because he can’t work any faster.
Little Lad.
Little lad, little lad, where wast
thou born ?
Far off in Lancashire, under a thorn.
Where they sup sour milk in a ram’s
horn.
jack-a-Dandy.
Handy Spandt, Jack-a-dandy,
Loved plum-cake and sugar-candy;
He bought some at a grocer’s shop.
And out he came, hop, hop, hop.
My Son John.
Dbedlb, deedle, dumpling, my son
John,
Went to bed with his stockings on;
One shoe off, the other shoe on,
Deedle, deedle, dumpling, my son
John.
Jack and Jill.
Jack and Jill went up the hill,
To fetch a pail of water;
Jack fell down and broke his crown.
And Jill came tumbling after.
Who can Draw best.
Willie drew a little pig,
Harry drew a mouse,
Tommy drew a ladder tall
Leaning on a house.
Bah, bah, black sheep.
Have you any wool?
Yes, marry, have I,
Three bags full:
One for my master.
And one for my dame.
But none for the little boy
Who cries in the lane.
Hey Diddle Diddle.
Hey, diddle, diddle, the cat and the fiddle
The cow jumped over the moon;
The little dog laughed to see such sport
And the dish ran after the spoon.
THE QUAKER’S VERSION.
“Hey! diddle, diddle.
The cat and the fiddle.
The cow jumped under the moon;
The little dog barked,
To see the sport.
And the cat ran after the spoon!” *
*Our friend, the Quaker, holds that the last verse
is the proper one, as it is the truest; but the won-
derful is taken out of it, and children, accord-
ingly, prefer the first. There is nothing wonderful
in the cow jumping "under” the moon, but there is
in the cow jumping “over” the moon; so with the
blackbirds baked in a pie. It is the fact of their
Binging when the pie was opened that pleases the
children—'twas the wonder of the thing; so with
the freaks of Mother Hubbard’s Dog, etc. In nearly
all nursery rhymes it is the ludicrous and wonder-
ful that arrests the attention and pleases.
E. W. COLE.
Frightened Boy.
There was a little boy went into a
barn.
And lay down on some hay;
An owl came out, and flew about.
And the little boy ran away.
Frightened Boys.
Tweedle-dum and tweedle-dee
Resolved to have a battle.
For tweedle-dum said tweedle-dee
Had spoiled his nice new rattle.
Just then flew by a monstrous crow.
As big as a tar-barrel.
Which frightened both the heroes so.
They quite forgot their quarrel.
Baked in a Pie.
Baby and I
Were baked in a pie,
The gravy was wonderful hot:
We had nothing to pay
To the baker that day.
And so we crept out cf the pot.
Maid not at Home.
High diddle doubt, my candle’s out.
My little maid is not at home:
Saddle my hog, and bridle my dog.
And fetch my little maid home.

JACK the GIANT KILLER.
Once upon a time there lived tn Cornwall,
England, a lad whose name was Jack, and who
was yery brave and knowing. At the same
time there was a great Giant, twenty feet high
and nine feet round, who lived in a cave, on an
island near Jack’s house. The Giant used to
wade to the mainland and steal things to hve
upon, carrying five or six bullocks at once, and
stringing sheep, pigs, and geese around his
waist-band; and all the people ran away from
him through fear, whenever they saw him
coming. ,
Jack determined to destroy this Giant; so ho
got a pickaxe and shovel, and started in his
boat on a dark evening j by the morning he had
dug a pit deep and broad, then covering it witn
sticks and strewing a little mould oyer, to
make it look like plain ground, he blew his horn
so loudly that the giant awoke, and came roar-
ing towards Jack, calling him a villain for
disturbing his rest, and declaring he would eat
him for breakfast. He had scarcely said _this
when he fell into the pit. "Oh 1 Mr. Giant,
sayg Jack, ‘‘where are you now? You
shall have this for breakfast.” So saying,
he struck him on the head so terrible a
blow with his pickaxe, that the Giant feu
dead to the bottom. | . .
Just at this moment the Giant s brother
ran out roaring vengeance against Jack j
but he jumped into his boat and pulled to
the opposite shore, with the Giant after
him, who caught poor Jack just as he was
landing, tied him down in his boat, and
went in search of provisions. During his
absence Jack contrived to cut a large hole
in the bottom of the boat, and placed
therein a piece of canvass. After having
stolen some oxen the Giant returned and
pushed off the boat, when, having got fairly
out to sea. Jack pulled the canvass from
the hole, which caused the boat to fill and
quickly capsize. The Giant roared and
bellowed as he struggled in the water, but
very soon was exhausted and drowned,
while Jack dexterously swam ashore.
One day after this, Jack was sitting by a
well fast asleep. A Giant, named Blunder-
bore, coming for water, at onoe saw and
caught hold of him, and carried him to his
castle. Jack was much frightened at seeing
the heaps of bodies and bones strewed about.
The Giant then confined him in an upper
room over the entrance, and went for an-
other Giant to breakfast off poor Jack. On
viewing the room he saw some strong ropes,
and making a noose at one end, he put the
other through a pulley which chanced to be
over the window, and when the Giants were
unfastening the gate he threw the noose over
both their heads, |and pulling it immediately,
ho contrived to choke them both. Then
releasing three ladies who were confined in
the castle, he departed well pleased.
About ire or six months after. Jack was
journeying through Wales, when, losing his
way, ho could find no place of entertainment,
and was about giving up all hopes of obtain-
ing shelter during the bight when he came
to a gate, and, on knocking, to his utter as-
tonishment It was oponed_by a Giant. who
did not teem »o fierce as the others. Jack told
him his distress, when the Giant invited him
in, and, after giving him a hearty supper,
shewed him to >bed. Jack had scarcely got
into bed when he heard the Giant muttering to
himself t
“Though you lodge with me this night.
You shall not see the morning light:
My club shall dash your brains out quite.**
•'Oh, Mr. Giant, Is that yeur gameP” said
Jack to himself; “ then I shall try and be
even with you.” So ho jumped out of bed and
put a large lump of wood there instead. In
the middle of the night the Giant went into the
iroom, and thinking it was Jack in the bed, ha
belaboured the wood most unmercifully; ha
then left the room, laughing to think how he
had settled poor Jack. The following morning,
Jack went boldly into the Giant’s room to
thank him for his night’s lodging. The Giant
was startled at Ms appearance, and asked him
how he had slept, or if anything had disturbed
him in the night? "Oh, no,” says Jack,
" nothing worth speaking about j I believe that
a rat gave me a few slaps with Ms tail, hut,
being rather sleepy, I took no notice of it.”
The Giant wondered how Jack survived the
terrific blows of his club, yet did not answer a
word, but went and brought in two monstrous
bowls of hasty pudding, placed one before Jack,
and began eating the other himself. Deter-
mined to be revenged on the Giant somehow.
Jack unbuttoned his leathern provision-bag
inside his coat, and slyly filling it with hasty
pudding, said, “I’ll do what you can’t." So
saying, he took up a large knife, and, ripping up
the bag, let out the hasty pudding. The Giant,
determined not to be outdone, seized the knife,
and saying, “ Her can do that," instantly ripped
up Ms belly, and fell down dead on the spot.
After this Jack fought and conquered many
giants, married the king’s daughter, and lived
happy.
JACK AND THE BEANSTALK.
At some distance from London, in a small
village, lived a widow and her son, whose name
was Jack. He was a bold, daring fellow, ready
for any adventure which promised fun or amuse-
ment. Jack’s mother had a cow, of which she
was very fond, and which, up to this time, had
been their chief support. But as she had for
some time past been growing poorer every year,
she felt that now she must part with the cow.
So she told Jack to take the cow t® be sold, and
he was to be sure to get a good round sum for
her. On the road to market Jack met a butcher,
who was carrying in his hat some things which
Jack thought very pretty. The butcher saw
how eagerly Jack eyed his beans, and said, “If
you want to sell your cow, my fine fellow, I will
give you this whole hatful of beans in exchange
for her."
Jack was delighted; he seized the hat, and
ran back home. Jack’s mother was surprised to
Bee him back so soon, and at once asked him for
the money. But when Jack said that he had
sold the cow for a hatful of beans, she was so.
angry that she opened the window, and threw |
them all out into the garden. C\When Jack rose ]
up next morning he found that one of the beans
had taken root, and had grown up, up, up, until
its top was quite lost in the clouds. Jack re-
solved instantly to mount the Beanstalk. So
up, up, up, he wont till he had reached the very
top. Looking round he saw at a distance a
large house. Tired and weary he crawled to-
wards it and knocked at the door. The door was
opened by a timid looking woman, who started
when she saw him, and besought him to run
away as her husband was a cruel Giant who
would eat bim up if he found him there/ , But
Jack begged so earnestly to be admitted, that
the woman, who was very kind-hearted, had pity
on him, and so she brought him into the kitchen,
and set before him on a table some bread and
meat, and ale. Jack ate and drank, and soon felt
quite refreshed. Presently the woman started
and said, “My husband! quick, quick! he comes
—he comes !" and opened the door of the oven
and bid Jack jump in. The Giant was in a
dreadful passion when he came in, and
almost killed his wife by a blow which he
aimed at her. He then began to sniff and
■mell, at last he roared out!
“Fee, fa, fl, fo, fum,
I smell the blood of an Englishman I
Be he alive, or be he dead.
I'll grind his bones to make me bread I
His tfdfe gave him an evasive answer, and
proceeded to lay before him his supper.
When the Giant could swallow no more, he
called out to his wife to bring him his hen,
which having been brought, whenever the
Giant said 11 Lay,” the hen laid a golden egg.
The Giant soon fell asleep, and Jack crept
out softly and seized the hen, and made off
without disturbing the Giant. Away ran
Jack till he came to the Beanstalk ; he was
much sooner at the bottom of it now than
at the top in the morning; and running to
his mother he told all his adventure.
The hen laid as many golden eggs as
Jack liked, and his mother before long had
another cow and everything which she
desired. A second time Jack climbed the
Beanstalk, when he ran away with the Giant’s
bags of money. A third time Jack climbed
the Beanstalk, and again gained admission
to the Giant’s house. He saw the Giant’s
wife, and asked her for a night’s lodging.
She at first said she could not let him into
the house, but Jack begged so hard that at
last she consented, and she gave him some
supper and put him to sleep in the copper
boiler near the kitchen fireplace, where she
thought the giant would not find him.
When the giant came in, his good nose
served him in a moment; for he cried out “I
smell fresh meat.” Jack laughed at this,
but it was no laughing matter; for the
giant looked all round the room, and even
put his thumb upon the lid of the copper,
till it seemed as if a stone of a hundred-
weight had fallen upon the lid. Just then his
wife came in with a whole roasted bullock
smoking hot, which the Giant sat down and
ate for his supper, and then went down into the
cellar and drank about six gallons of Jamaica
rum. The Giant now sat down and went to sleep,
and Jack tried to run away with his golden harp,
an instrument, which, when the Giant said
play, played the most beautiful tunes. Now the
harp was a fairy, and as soon as Jack touched
it, it called out “ Master I Master I” so loud that
the Giant awoke, but he was some time before
he could understand what "was the matter. He
tried to run after Jack, but Jack got to the top
of the Beanstalk first. When he had descended
a little way he looked up, and how great was his
horror to see the huge hand of the Giant
stretched down to seize him by the hair of the
head! He slid and scrambled down the Bean-
stalk, hardly knowing how, and seeing the Giant
just putting his feet over the top, he called out,
“Quick, mother! A hatchet, a hatchet!” Jack
seized it, and chopped away at the Beanstalk,
when down it fell, bringing along with it the
Giant. Jackinstantiy cut off his head. After this
Jack and his mother lived very happily,and Jack
was a great comfort to her in her old age.

HOP O’ MY THUMB.
Once upon a time there was a woodman and
his wife, who had so many children that they
did not know how to find food for them. So
one night, when they were all in bed, the father
told his wife that he thought they had better
take them into the forest and lose them there.
The youngest child, who was so very small that
he was called Hop o’ my Thumb, overheard his
father, and as he was a very clever boy, ha
made up his mind to find his way home again.
So he went down to the brook very early the
next morning, and filled his pocket with large
smooth pebbles as white as snow. By-and-bye,
the woodman and his wife told the children
that they might go with them into the wood to
have a good game of play. They were all glad,
except Hop o’ my Thumb, who knew what his
father intended. So they set out; the woodman
and his wife first, then the boys, and last Hop
o’ my Thumb, who sprinkled pehbles all the way
they went.
They spent a very merry day; but by-and-bye
the parents stole away, and left the child-
ren all by themselves. They were very
much frightened when they missed their
father and mother, and called loudly for
them; hut when Hop o’ my Thumb told
them what he had heard, and how they
could find their way h®me by following the
track of the pebbles, which marked the way
they had come, they set out, and reached
home safely, and their father and mother
pretended to be very glad to see them back.
But soon after they again resolved to lose
their children, if possible, in the forest.
This time all the boys feared that they
should be left behind, and the eldest
brother said he would take some peas to
sprinkle, to mark the pathway that led
home. Bye-and-bye the cruel parents stole
away, and left the little ones in the dark
wood. At first they did not care, for they
thought that they could easily find their
way home; but, alas! when they looked
for the line of peas which they had sprinkled,
they found they were all gone—the wood-
pigeons had eaten them up, and the children
were lost in the wood. Holding each others
hands and crying sadly, they walked on, to
seek a place to sleep in. By-and-bye they
came to a giant’s castle, where they were
taken in, and told that they might sleep in
the nursery with the seven baby daughters
of the giant, who were lying all in a row in
one bed, with gold crowns on their heads.
Hop o’ my Thumb thought it strange that
the giant should be so kind, as he had been
told that ogres eat children. So in the
night he got up softly, and took off the little
giantesses’ crowns, and put them on his
brothers’ heads and his own, and lay down
again. It was lucky for him that he did so,
for in the night the giant came up in the
dark to kill the boys, that they might be
ready for next day’s breakfast. He felt the
beds, and finding the crowns on the boys’
heads took them for his own children, left
them, and went to the other bed and cut off
the heads of his daughters instead. Then
he went back to bed. DirectlyJhe was gone, _
Hop o’ my Thumb and his brothers got up, stole
down stairs, opened the door and fled away from
the castle. But they did not go far. Hop o’ my
Thumb knew that the giant would come after y
them in his seven-league boots. So they > - ot
into a hole in the side of a hill and hid. V ry
soon after, they saw the giant coming at a great
pace in his wonderful boots; but he took such
long steps that he passed right over their heads.
They were afraid to move out till they had seen
him go home again. So they remained quietly
where they were.
By-and-bye the giant who had been many
miles in on hour, came back tired, and lay down
on the hill-side, and fell asleep. Then Hop o*
my Thumb got out of the hole, and pulled off
the giant’s seven-league boots, and put them
on his own feet. They fitted him exactly, for
being fairy boots they would grow large or
small just as one liked. He then got his
brothers out of the hole, took them ip his
boots, marched for home, and although it was
a great distance, got there in almost no time,
but when he arrived at the house, his father
and mother were not there. He then hastened
to make inquiries for them, and found that they
had been suspected of murdering their children,
—who had all disappeared suddenly—that they
had owned to leaving them in the wood, and
that they were to be put to death for the crime.
“We must go and save them,” he said. So he
took his brothers into the seven-league boots,
and set out to the place where their parents
were in prison. They arrived only just in time,
for the guards were bringing out the woodman
and his wife to put them to death. Hop o’ my
Thumb took off the boots, and all the children
called out, “We are alive! we are alive! Do
not kill our mother and father."
Then there was great joy. The woodman and
his wife were set free, and embraced _ their
children. They had repented of their wicked-
ness and were never unkind and cruel any
more; and Hop o’ my Thumb kept them all in
comfort, by going on errands for the king in bis
seven league boots.
TOM THUMB.
In tlie days of good King Arthur, there lived a
ploughman and his wife, who wished very much
to have a son; so the man went to Merlin, the
enchanter, and asked him to let him have a
child, even if it were “no bigger than his thumb.”
“Go home and you will find one,” said Merlin;
and when the man came hack to his house he
found his wife nursing a very, very, wee baby,
who in four minutes grew to the size of the
ploughman’s thumb, and never grew any more.
The fairy queen came to his christening, and
named him “Tom Thumb.” She then dressed
him nicely in a shirt of spider’s-web, and a
doublet and hose of thistledown.
One* day, while Tom’s mother was making a
plum-pudding, Tom stood on the edge of the
bowl, with a lighted candle in his hand, that
she might see to make it properly. Unfor-
tunately, however, while her back was turned,
Tom fell into the bowl, and his mother not
missing him, stirred him up in the pudding, and
put it and him into the pot. Tom no sooner felt
the hot water than he danced about like mad;
the woman was nearly frightened out of her
wits to see the pudding come out of the pot and
jump about, and she was glad to give it to a
tinker who was passing that way.
The tinker was delighted with his present;
but as he was getting over a stile, he happened
to sneeze very hard, and Tom called out from
the middle of the pudding, “Hallo, Pickens!”
which so terrified the tinker, that he threw the
pudding into the field, and scampered away as
fast as he could. The pudding tumbled to
Eieces in the fall, and Tom creeping out, went
ome to his mother, who was in great affliction
because she could not find him. A few days
afterwards Tom went with his mother into the
fields to milk the cows, and for fear he should
be blown away by the wind, she tied him to a
thistle with a small piece of thread. Very soon
after a cow eat up the thistle and swallowed
Tom Thumb. His mother was in sad grief
again; but Tom scratched and kicked in the
now’s throat till she was glad to throw him out
of her mouth again.
> One day Tom went ploughing with his
father, who gave him a whip made of a
barley straw, to drive the oxen with; but
an eagle, flying by, caught him up in his beak,
and carried him to the top of a great giant's
castle. The giant would have eaten Tom
up; but the fairy dwarf scratched and bit
his tongue and held on by his teeth till the
giant in a passion took him out again and
threw him into the sea, when a very large
fish swallowed him up directly. The fish
was caught soon after and sent as a present
to King Arthur, and when the cook opened
it there was Tom Thumb inside. He was
carried to the king, who was delighted with
the little man.
The king ordered a little chair to be made,
in order that Tom might sit on his table,
and also a palace of gold a span high, with a
door an inch wide, for little Tom to live in.
He also gave him a coach drawn by six small
mice.
This made the queen angry, because she
had not a new coach too: therefore, re-
solving to ruin Tom, she complained to the
king that he had spoken insolently to her.
The king sent for him. Tom, to escape his
fury, crept into an empty snail-shell, and
there lay till he was almost starved; when
peeping out of the shell, he saw a fine but-
terfly settled on the ground: he now ven-
tured out, and getting on it, the butterfly
took wing, and mounted into the air with
little Tom on his back. Away he flew from
field to field, from tree to tree, till at last he
flew to the king’s court.
The king, queen, and nobles, all strove to
catch the butterfly, but could not. At
length poor Tom, having neither bridle nor
saddle, slipped from his seat, and fell into
a pool of water, where he was found almost
drowned. The queen vowed he should be
beheaded, and while the scaffold was getting
ready, he was secured in a mouse-trap;
when the cat seeing something stir, and
supposing it to be a mouse, patted the trap
about till she broke it, and set Tom at
liberty.
Sometimes Tom rode out on a mouse for a
horse. One day, a big black cat met him along
the road, and wanted to kill the mouse. Tom
jumped off the mouse’s back, drew his sword,
and fought the cat, and made her run away.
In order to show his courage and please the
queen, the new knight undertook a terrible
adventure.
In one comer of the palace garden there was
found a great black spider, of which the lady
was much afraid.
Tom undertook to kill this insect; so he took
a gold button for a shield, and his sharp needle-
sword, and went out to attack the spider; the
knights went also, to witness the combat.
Tom drew his sword and fought valiantly, but
the spider’s poisonous breath overcame him.
King Arthur and his whole Court went into
mourning for little Tom Thumb. They buried
him under a rose-bush, and raised a nice white I
marble monument over his grave.

Little 80-Pcep.
Little 80-Peep has lost her sheep,
And can’t tell where to find them;
Leave them alone, and they’ll come home.
And bring their tails behind them.
Little 80-Peep fell fast asleep.
And dreamed she heard them bleating.
But when she awoke, ’twas all a joke—
Alas ! they still were fleeting.
Then up she took her little crook.
Determined for to find them;
She found them, indeed, but it made her
heart bleed.
They’d left their tails behind them.
It happened one day, as 80-Peep did stray
Over the meadows hard by.
That there she espied their tails side by
side.
All hung on a tree to dry.
She heaved a sigh, and gave by-and-by
Each careless sheep a banging;
And as for the rest she thought it
was best
Just to leave their tails a-hanging.
Mary’s Little Lamb.
Mary had a little lamb
Whose fleece was white as snow.
And everywhere that Mary went
That Lamb it would not go;
So Mary took that little Lamb
And put it on the spit.
And soon it was so nicely done
She ate it every bit.
PEMMY.
Pemmt was a pretty girl.
But Fanny was a better;

But Fanny would not let her.
Pemmy had a pretty doll.
Put Fanny had a better;
Pemmy chatter’d like a poll.
When little Fanny let her.
Pemmy had a pretty song.
But Fanny had a better;
Pemmy would sing all day long.
But Fanny would not let her.
Little Husband.
I had a little husband.
No bigger than my thumb;
I put him in a pint pot.
And there I bid him drum.
I bought a little horse.
That galloped up and down;
I bridled him, and saddled him.
And sent him out of town.
I gave him some garters.
To garter up his hose.
And a little handkerchief.
To wipe his pretty nose.
I’m Governess.
Now children dear, you all come near.
And do not make a noise;
But listen here, just take and clear
That desk of all those toys.
For now I’m Governess you’ll find.
That its, myself will make you mind;
So Alice Brown you do your sum,
And Betsy Snooks don’t look so glum.
And Sarah White sit down at once.
And Susan Black you are a dunce.
And Annie Grey you needn’t think
I didn’t see you spill the ink.
And find your thimble Maggie Moore,
And ; mind your sewing Jennie Shore;
And Linda Cole you know ’tis wrong
To make each stitch two inches long.
And you Kate Eoss, stop pinching there.
Don’t scratch ! nor pull your sister’s hair;
And you, you naughty Lucy Moyes,
Must not be talking to the boys.
And Bridget Mace don’t make that face ;
And Norah Finn keep your tongue in.
Don’t be a Tom-boy Emma Pyke,
You really must act lady-like.
Now I want all good children in my school.
Don’t want a single dunce, bad girl or fool.
So I will kindly ask you to be brave.
And try to very, very, well behave.
Yes all be good and learn your lessons well.
And then I’ll ring the little bell to tell
That school is over for the day.
And you can all run out to play.

LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.
Once upon a time there was a dear little girl,
whose mother made her a scarlet cloak with a
hood to tie over her pretty head; so people
called her (as a pet name) “ Little Bed Biding-
Hood." One day her mother tied on her cloak
and hood, and said,
" I wish you to go to-day, my darling, to see
your grandmamma, and take her a present of
some butter, fresh eggs, a pot of honey, and a
little cake, with my love.”
Little Bed Biding-Hood loved her grand-
mother, and was very glad to go. So she ran
gaily through the wood, gathering the wild-
flowers and gambolling among the ferns as she
went; and the birds all sang their sweetest
songs to her, and the bluebells nodded their
pretty heads, for everything loved the gentle
child.
By and bye a great hungry Wolf came up to
her. He wished to eat her up, but as he heard
the woodman Hugh’s axe at work close by,
he was afraid to touch her, for fear she
should cry out and he should get killed. So
he only asked her where she was going.
Little Bed Biding-Hood innocently told him
(for she did not know he was a wicked Wolf)
that she was going to visit her grandmother,
who lived in a cottage on the other side of
the wood. Then the Wolf made haste, and
ran through the wood, and came to the cot-
tage of which the child had told him. He
tapped at the door.
"Who’s there?” asked the old woman,
who lay sick in bed.
"It is Little Bed Biding-Hood, Grand-
mamma," answered the Wolf in a squeaky
tone, to imitate the voice of her grand-
child.
" Pull the string, and the latch will come
up,” said the old lady, “for I am ill, and
cannot open the door.”
The cruel wolf did so, and jumping on the
bed, ate the poor grandmother up.
Then he put on her nightcap and got into
bed. By and bye Little Bed Biding-Hood,
who had lingered gathering flowers as she
came along, and so was much later than the
Wolf, knocked at the door.
" Who’s there ?" asked the Wolf, mimick-
ing her grandmother’s voice.
It is Little Bed Biding-Hood, dear Grand-
mamma,” said the child.
" Pull the string, and the latch will come
up,” said the Wolf.
So Bed Biding-Hood came in, and the
Wolf told her to put down her basket, and
come and sit on the bed. When Little Bed
Biding-Hood drew back the curtain and saw
the Wolf, she began to be rather frightened,
and said,
"Dear Grandmamma, what great eyes
you have got!”
"All the better to see with, my dear,” said
the Wolf, who liked a grim joke.
"And what a large nose you have. Grand-
mamma!” cried the child.
“All the bettor to smell with, my dear.”
"And, oh! Grandmamma, what long white
teeth you have!”
Alas! she reminded the greedy Wolf of eating.
"All the better to eat you with!” he growled!
and, jumping out of bed, sprang at Bed Biding-
Hood.
But just at that moment Hugh the woodman,
who had seen the sweet child go by, and had
followed her, because he knew there was a
Wolf prowling about the forest, burst the door
open, and killed the wicked animal with his good
axe. Little Bed Biding-Hood clung round his
neck, and thanked him, and cried for joy; and
Hugh took her home to her mother; and after
that she was never allowed to walk in the
greenwood by herself.
It was said at first that the Wolf had eaten the
child, but that was not the case; and everybody
was glad to hear that the first report was not
correct, and that the Wolf had not really killed
Little Bed Biding-Hood.

I’M GRANDMAMMA.
Last night, when I was in my bed.
Such fun it seemed to me ;
I dreamt that I was grandmamma,
And grandmamma was me.
But she was such a tiny girl,
And dressed in baby-clothes;
And I thought I smacked her face, because
She wouldn’t blow her nose.
And I went walking up the street.
And she ran by my side;
But because I walked too quick for her.
My goodness, how she cried.
And after tea I washed her face;
And when her prayers were said,
I blew the candle out, and left
Poor grandmamma in bed.
THE BABES IN THE WOOD.
A long time ago, their lived in an old mansion
in the country, a rich gentleman and his wife
who had two dear little children, of whom they
were very fond. Sad to relate, the gentleman
and lady were both taken ill, and feeling that
they were about to die, sent for the uncle of the
children, and begged him to take care of them
till they were old enough to inherit the estates.
Now this uncle was a bad and cruel man, who
wanted to take the house, the estates, and the
money for himself, —so after the death of the
parents he began to think how he could best get
rid of the children. For some time he kept
them till he claimed for them all the goods that
should have been theirs. At last, he sent for
two robbers, who had once been his companions,
and showing them the boy and girl who were at
play, offered them a large sum of money to carry
them away and never let him see them more.
One of the two robbers began by coaxing the
little boy and girl, and asking them if they
would not like to go out for a nice ride in
the woods, each of them on a big horse.
The boy said he should, if his sister might
go too, and the girl said she should not be
afraid if her brother went with her. So the
two robbers enticed them away from the
house, and mounting their horses, went off
into the woods, much to the delight of the
children who were pleased with the great
trees, the bright flowers, and the singing of
the birds.
Now, one of these men was not so bad and
cruel as the other, and he would not consent
to kill the poor little creatures as the other
threatened he would do. He said that they
should be left in the woods to stray about
and perhaps they might then escape. This
led to a great quarrel between the two, and
at last the cruel one jumped off his horse,
saying he would kill them, lot who would
stand in the way. Upon this, the other
drew his sword to protect the children, and
after a fierce fight succeeded in killing his
companion.
But though he had saved them from being
murdered, he was afraid to take them back
or to convey them out of the wood, so he
pointed out a path, telling them to walk
straight on and he would come back to them
when he had bought some bread for their
supper; he rode away and left them there
all alone, with only the trees and birds and
flowers. They loved each other so dearly,
and were so bold and happy, that they were
not much afraid though they were both
very hungry.
The two children soon got out of the path,
which led into the thickest part of the wood,
and then they wandered farther and farther
into the thicket till they were both sadly
tired, but they found some wild berries,
nuts, and fruits, and began to eat them to
satisfy their hunger. The dark night came
on and the robber did not return. They
were cold, and still very hungry, and the
boy went about looking for fresh fruit for
his sister, and tried to comfort her as they
lay down to sleep on the soft moss under the
trees.
The next day and the next, they roamed about
hut there was nothing to eat hut wild fruits and
they lived on them till they grew so weak, that
they could not go far from the tree where they
had made a little bed of grass and weeds. There
they lay down as the shades of night fell upon
them, and in the morning they wore both in
heaven, for they died there in the forest, and as
the sun shone upon their little pale faces, the
robins and other birds came and covered their
bodies with leaves, and and so died and was
buried the poor Babes in the Wood.


CINDERELLA.
i Cinderella’s mother died while she was a very
i little child, leaving her to the care of her father
and her step-sisters, who were very much older
than herself; for Cinderella’s father had been
twice married, and her mother was his
second wife. Now, Cinderella’s sisters did not
love her, and were very unkind to her. As she
grow older they made her work as a servant, and
even sift the cinders; on which account they used
to call her in mockery “Cinderella.” It was not
her real name, but she became afterwards so well
known by it, that her proper one has been for-
gotten.
She was a very sweet-tempered, good girl,
however, and everybody except her cruel sisters
loved her.
It happened, when Cinderella was about seven-
teen years old, that the King of that country
gave a ball, to which all the ladies of the land,
and among the rest the young girl’s sisters, were
invited. So they made her dress them for this
ball, but never thought of allowing her to go
there.
"I wish you would take me to the ball
with you, sisters," said Cinderella, meekly.
“Take you, indeed!" answered the elder
sister, with a sneer; “it is no place for a
cinder-sifter: stay at home and do your
work."
When they were gone, Cinderella, whose
heart was very sad, sat down and cried bit-
terly; but as she sat sorrowful, thinking of
the unkindness of her sisters, a voice called
to her from the garden, and she went out to
see who was there. It was her god-mother,
a good old Fairy.
“Do not cry, Cinderella," she said; “you
also shall go to the ball, because you are a
kind, good girl. Bring me a large pumpkin."
Cinderella obeyed, and the Fairy, touch,
ing it with her wand, turned it into a grand
coach. Then she turned a rat into a coach-
man, and some mice into footmen; and
touching Cinderella with her wand, the poor
girl’s rags became a rich dress trimmed
with costly lace and jewels, and her old
shoes became a charming pair of glass
slippers, which looked like diamonds. The
Fairy told her to go to the ball and enjoy
herself, but to be sure and leave the ball-
room before the clock struck eleven.
“If you do not," she said, “your fine
clothes will all turn to rags again."
So Cindferella got into the coach, and
drove oft with her six footmen behind, very
splendid to behold, and arrived at the
King's Court, where she was received with
delight. She was the most beautiful young
lady at the ball, and the Prince would dance
with no one else. But she made haste to
leave a little before the hour fixed, and had
time to undress before her sisters came
home. They told her a beautiful Princess
had been at the ball, with whom the Prince
was delighted. They did not know it was
Cinderella herself.
Three times Cinderella went to royal balls
in this manner, but the third time she forgot
the Fairy’s command, and heard eleven
o’clock strike. She darted out of the ball-
room and ran down stairs in a great hurry. But
her dress all turned to rags before she left the
palace, and she lost one of her glass slippers.
The Prince sought for her everywhere, but
the guard said no one had passed the gate but a
poor beggar girl. However, the Prince found
the slipper, and in order to discover where
Cinderella was gone, he had it proclaimed that
he would marry the lady who could put on the
glass slipper. All the ladies tried to wear the
slipper in rain, Cinderella’s sisters also; but
when sister begged to be allowed to
try it also, it was found to fit her exactly; and,
to the Prince's delight, she drew the fellow
slipper from her pocket, and he knew at once
that she was his beautiful partner at the ball.
So she was married to the Prince, and children
strewed roses in their path as they came out of
church.
Cinderella forgave her sisters, and was so kind
to them, that she made them truly sorry for
their past cruelty and injustice.
THE THREE BEARS.
Once upon a time three bears lived in a nice
little house in a great forest.
There was the Father Bear, the Mother Bear,
and the Baby Bear.
They had each a bed to sleep in, a chair to sit
on, and a basin and spoon for eating porridge,
which was their favourite food.
One morning the three bears went to take a
walk before breakfast; but before they went out,
they poured the hot porridge into their basins,
that it might get cool by the time they came
back. Mr. and Mrs. Bear walked arm-in-arm,
and Baby Bear ran by their side. Now there
lived in the same forest a sweet little girl who
was called Golden Hair. She, also, was walking
that morning in the wood, and happening to
pass by the bears’ house, and seeing the window
open, she peeped in. There was no one to bo
seen; but three basins of steaming hot porridge,
all ready to be eaten, seemed to say: “Come in
and have some breakfast," So Golden Hair went
in and tasted the porridge in all the basins; then
she sat down in Baby Bear’s chair, and took up
his spoon, and eat up all his porridge. Now
this was very wrong. A tiny bear is only a tiny
bear, still he has a right to keep his own things.
But Golden Hair did not know any better.
Unluckily, Baby Bear’s chair was too small
for her, and she broke the seat and fell through,
basin and all.
Then Golden Hair went up stairs, and there
she saw three beds all in a row. Golden Hair
lay down on Father Bear’s bed first, but that
was too long for her; then she lay down on
Mother Bear’s bed, and that was too wide for
her; last of all, she lay down on Baby Bear’s
bed, and there she fell asleep, for she was tired.
By-and-bye, the bears came home, and Old
Father Bear looked at his chair, and growledi
“Somebody has been here I”
And Mother Bear growled, more softly t
“Somebody has been here I”
And Baby Bear, seeing his chair broken,
squeaked out:
“ Somebody has been here, and
broken my chair right through!”
Then they went to the table, and looked at
their porridge, and Father Bear growled:
“Who has touched my basin?”
And Mother Bear growled:
“Who has touched my basin?”
And Baby Bear squeaked:
“Somebody has broken mine, and
eat up all my porridge!”
Then they went up stairs, and Father Bear
growled t
“Who has been lying on my bed?”
And Mother Bear growled:
“Who has been lying on my bed?”
And Tiny Bear squeaked out:
“ Oh! here is a little girl In my
bed; and It must be she who has
eaten my breakfast and broken
my chair and basin!”
Then Father Bear growled:
“Let us eat her up!”
And Mother Bear growled:
“Let us eat her up!”
And Tiny Bear squeaked:
“Let us eat her up!”
But the noise they made awoke Golden
Hair; she started out of bed (on the op-
posite side) and jumped out of the window.
The three bears all jumped out after her,
but they fell one on the top of the other
and rolled over and over, and while they
were picking themselves up, little Golden
Hair ran home, and they were not able to
catch her.
BLUEBEARD.
Once there lived in a lovely castle, a very
rich man, called Bluebeard. A short dis-
tance off lived an old gentleman, with two
lovely daughters, named Fatima and Annie.
Bluebeard visited at their house, and at
length proposed to Fatima, was accepted by
her, and they were married with great
splendour, he took her home with him to
his castle, and permitted her sister Annie to
reside with her for company for a time. She
lived very happy in her new home, her hus-
band was very kind to her, and allowed her
to have anything she wished for; but one
day he suddenly told her that business
called him away from home, that he should
be away some days, and handed her the keys
of his wardrobe, treasures, and all parts of
his castle; he also gave her one key of a
small closet, and told her that she might
unlock every door in the castle, but not this
closet door, for, if she did so, she should
not live an hour longer. He then left home,
fondly kissing her at the door; her sister
and herself returned into the castle, and
enjoyed themselves in unlocking room after
room, looking over the curiosities, treasures
etc., until Annie became tired and laid down
to rest on a rich sofa, and fell asleep, Fatima, as
soon as she saw that her sister was asleep, felt
a womanly curiosity, an irresistable temptation
to unlock the forbidden closet, and take a peep,
she tripped lightly up to the door, turned the
key in the lock, pushed the door open, and oh!
horror they were five or six dead ladies, laying in
the closet with their marriage rings on their
fingers, she at once concluded that they were
Bluebeard’s previous wives j she let the key drop
in her fright into the blood on the floor; she
picked it up and attempted to wipe it, but the
blood would not come off; she woke her sister
and they both tried, but they could not get it
off, and gave it up in despair. Just then Blue-
beard suddenly returned, and asked his wife if
she would please to hand him the keys. She
tremblingly did so. He said, “How came the
blood on the closet key ? You have disobeyed me
and shall die at once." She begged a few minutes
to say her prayers; and just as he was going to
chop her head off, her two brothers arrived at
the castle, burst open the door, killed the cruel
wretch, and rescued their sisters.


) Old Man and his wife.
I There was an old man who lived in a wood.
As you may plainly see ;
. He said he could do as much work in a day.
As his wife could do in three.
' “ With all my heart” the old woman said,
1 "If that you will allow,
' To-morrow you’ll stay at home in my stead,
1 And I’ll go drive the plough
i “ But you must milk the Tidy cow,
I For fear that she go dry ;
And you must feed the little pigs
That are within the sty ;
And you must mind the speckled hen,
1 For fear she lay away;
1 And you must reel the spool of yarn
1 That I spun yesterday.”
! The old woman took a whip in her hand,
! And went to drive the plough ;
The old man took a pail in his hand,
1 And went to milk the cow;
But Tidy hinehed, and Tidy flinched,
1 And Tidy broke his nose,
: And Tidy gave him such a blow,
1 That the blood ran down to his toes.
I “ High I Tidy 1 ho ! Tidy! high!
Tidy, do stand still!
If ever I milk you. Tidy, again,
1 "T will be so against my will,’*
1 He went to feed the little pigs,
1 That were within the sty ;
1 He hit his head against the beam,
i And he made the blood to fly.
1 He went to mind the speckled hen,
1 For fear she’d lay astray,
j And he forgot the spool of yam
His wife spun yesterday, [stars,
i So he swore by the sun, the moon, and ths
i And the green leaves on the tree,
i It his wife didn’t do a day’s work in her life,
I She should ne’er be ruled by he.

OLD MEN TALES.
The Funny Old Man.
There was an old man, and though ’tis not common.
Yet if he said true, his mother was a woman ;
And though it’s incredible, yet I’ve been told
He was a mere infant, but age made him old.
When’er he was hungry he long'd for some meat.
And it he could get it, ’twas said he would eat;
When thirsty he’d drink, if you gave him a pot.
And his liquor most commonly ran down his throat.
He seldom or never could see without light.
And yet I’ve been told he could hear in the night.
He has of’t been awake in the daytime, 'tis said.
And has fall’n fast asleep as he lay in his bed.
'Tis reported his tongue always mov’d when he talk’d.
And he stirr’d both his arms and his legswhenhe walk'd.
And his gait was so odd, had you seen him you’d burst.
Per one leg or t’other would always be first.
His face was the saddest that ever was seen.
For if ’twere not wash’d it was seldom quite clean ;
He shew’d most his teeth when he happened to grin.
And his mouth stood across ’twixt his nose and his
At last he fell sick, as old chronicles tell, [chin.
And then, as folks said, he was not very well!
But what is more strange, in so weak a condition,
As he could not give fees, he could get no physician.
What pity he died ! yet ’tis said that his death
Was occasioned at last by the want of his breath
But peace to his bones, which in ashes now moulder, —
Had he liv’d a day longer he’d been a day older.
Piper and his Cow.
There was an old piper who had a cow.
But he had no hay to give her,
So he took his pipes and played her a tune i
“ Consider old cow consider.”
Frighten’d Old Man.
There was a man, and he had nought.
And robbers came to rob him ;
He crept up the chimney pot.
And then they thought they had him ;
But he got down on t’other side.
And then they could not find him;
He ran fourteen miles in fifteen days,
And never look’d behind him.
A Man with a Wife.
I had a little wife, the prettiest ever seen,
She washed me the dishes, and kept the
house clean;
She went to the mill to fetch me some flour;
She brought it home in less than an hour;
She baked me my bread, she brew’d mo my
ale.
She sat by the fire and told many a fine tale.
Old John Brown.
Poor old John Brown is dead and gone;
We never shall see him more.
Hen sed to wear an old brown coat.
All button'd down before.
Three wise Men.
Three wise men of Gotham
Went to sea in a bowl;
And if the bowl had been stronger,
My song would have been longer.
Crooked Old Man.
There was a crooked man,
And he went a crooked mile.
He found a crooked sixpence
Against a crooked stile.
He bought a crooked cat,
Which caught a crooked mouse.
And they all lived together
In a little crooked house.
King; Arthur.
When good King Arthur ruled this land.
He was a goodly King ;
He stole three pecks of barley-meal.
To make a bag-pudding.
A bag-pudding the king did make.
And stuffed it well with plums ;
And in it put great lumps of fat,
As big as my two thumbs.
The king and queen did eat thereof.
And noblemen besides ;
And what they could not eat that night.
The queen next morning fried.
Barney Budkin.
Barney Bodkin broke his nose.
Without feet we can’t have toes.
Crazy folks are always mad.
Want of money makes us sad.
Funny Man.
A man of words and not of deeds.
Is like a garden full of weeds ;
And when the weeds begins to grow.
It’s like a garden full of snow;
And when the snow begins to fall.
It’s like a bird upon the wall;
And when the bird away does fly.
It’s like an eagle in the sky ;
And when the sky begins to roar.
It’s like a lion at the door;
And when the door begins to crack.
It’s like a stick across your back ;
And when your back begins to smart.
It’s like a penknife in your heart;
And when your heart begins to bleed,
You're dead, and dead, and dead indeed.
Strange Man.
There was a man and he was mad.
And he jumped into a pea-pod;
The pea-pod was over-full.
So ne jumped into a roaring-bull;
The roaring bull was over-fat.
So he jump’d into a gentleman’s hat;
The gentleman’s hat was over fine.
So he jump'd into a bottle of wine;
The bottle of wine was over-dear.
So he jump’d into a bottle of beer;
The bottle of beer was over-thick.
So be jump’d into a club-stick;
The club-stick was over narrow.
So he jump'd into a wheel-barrow;
The wheel-barrow began to crack,
So he jump’d on to a hay-stack;
The hay-stack began to blaze,
So he did nothing but cough and sneeze 1


Jack Sprat.
Jack Sprat could eat no fat.
His wife could eat no lean.
And so between them both.
They licked the platter clean.
Jack ate all the lean,
Joan ate all the fat.
The bone they picked clean.
Then gave it to the cat.
When Jack Sprat was young.
He dressed very smart.
He courted Joan Cole,
And he gained her heart.
In his fine leather doublet
And old greasy hat.
Oh, what a smart fellow
Was little Jack Sprat I
Joan Cole had a hole
In her petticoat.
Jack Sprat, to get a patch,
Gave her a groat;
The groat bought a patch.
Which stopped the hole,
"I thank you. Jack Sprat,**
Says little Joan Cola.
Jack Sprat was the bridegroom,
Joan Cole was the bride.
Jack said, from the church
His Joan home should ride.
But no coach could take her
The lane was so narrow.
Said Jack, “ then I’ll take her
Home in a wheelbarrow.”
Jack Sprat was wheeling
His wife by the ditch.
The barrow turned over.
And in she did pitch.
Says Jack, “she’ll be drown’d,”
But Joan did reply,
"I don’t think I shall.
For the ditch is quite dry.”
Jack brought home his Joan,
And she sat in a chair.
When in came his cat.
That had got but one ear.
Says Joan, “I’m come home, Bust,
Pray how do you do ?”
The cat wagg’d her tail.
And said nothing but “mew,”
Jack Sprat took his gun.
And went to the brook.
He shot at the drake.
But he killed the duck.
He brought it to Joan,
Who a fire did make
To roast the fat duck.
While Jack went for the drake.
The drake was swimming
With his curly tail,
Jack Sprat came to shoot him.
But happened to fail;
He let off his gun.
But missing his mark,
The drake flew away
Crying, “ Quack, quack, quack,"
Jack Sprat to live pretty.
Now bought him a pig,
It was not very little,
It was not very big;
It was not very lean.
It was not very fat,
"It will serve for a grnnter”
Said little Jack Sprat.
Then Joan went to market
To buy her some fowls.
She bought a jackdaw
And a couple of owls.
The owls they were white.
The jackdaw was black,
"They’ll make a rare breed,”
Says little Joan Sprat,
Jack Sprat bought a cow.
His Joan for to please.
For Joan she could make
Both butter and cheese.
Or pancakes or puddings.
Without any fat;
A notable housewife
Was little Joan Sprat.
Joan Sprat went to Drawing
A barrell of ale.
She put in some hops
That it might not turn stale |
But as for the malt.
She forgot to put that;
** This is brave sober liquor,"
Said little Jack Sprat.
Jack Sprat went to market.
And bought him a mare.
She was lame of three legs.
And as blind as she could stare;
Her ribs they were bare,
For the mare had no fat,
** She looks like a racer,”
Says little Jack Sprat.
Jack and Joan went abroad,
Puss took care of the house.
She caught a large rat
And a very small mouse ;
She caught a small mouse.
And a very large rat ;
"You’re an excellent hunter,”
Says little Jack Sprat.
Now I hare told you the story
Of little Jack Sprat,
And little Joan Cole,
And the poor one-ear’d cat.
Now Jack loved Joan,
And good things he taught her.
Then she gave him a sou.
Then after a daughter.
Now Jack has got rich
And has plenty of pelf;
If you know any more.
You may tell it yourself.
Cress Old Man.
There was a cross old man
And what do you think f
He lived upon nothing but
Victuals and drink ;
Victuals and drink were the
Chief of his diet;
Tet this crabbed old man
Would never be quiet.
He teased a poor monkey, who lived In a cage.
Till the animal got in a terrible rage,
And seized on his nose with fingers so strong
That it stretched the poor nose
Till t'was quite a yard long I
Old Man In the Moon.
The man in the moon, came tumbling down.
And asked his way to Norwich.

A Funny Man.
There was a man of Newington,
And he was wond'rous wise,
He jump’d into a quickset hedge,
And scratch’d out both his eyes ;
But when he saw his eyes were out.
With all his might and main.
He jump’d into another hedge.
And scratch’d ’em in again.
Doctor Faustus.
Doctor Faustus was a good man,
He whipt his scholars now and then;
When he whipp’d them he made them dance
Out of Scotland into France,
Out of France into Spain,
And then he whipp'd them back again I
IF, IF, IF.
If all the world was apple pie.
And all the sea was ink.
And all the trees were bread and cheese.
What would we have to drink ?
It’s enough to make an old man scratch his
head and think.

THE DIVERTING HISTORY OF JOHN CILPIN.
John Gilpin was a citizen
Of credit and renown,
A train-band Captain eke was he
Of famous London town.
John Gilpin’s spouse said to her dear,—
Though wedded we have been.
These twice ten tedious years, yet we
No holiday have seen.
To-morrow is our wedding-day.
And wo will then repair
Unto the Ball at Edmonton,
All in a chaise and pair.
My sister and my sister’s child.
Myself and children three.
Will fill the chaise, so you must ride
On horseback after we.
He soon replied,— Ido admire
Of womankind but one.
And you are she, my dearest dear.
Therefore it shall be done,
I am a linen-draper bold.
As all the world doth know.
And my good friend the Calender,
Will lend his horse to go.
Quoth Mrs. Gilpin,—That’s well said}
And for that wine is dear,
We will be furnish’d with our own.
Which is both bright and clear.
John Gilpin kiss’d his loving wife;
O’erjoyed was ha to find
That, though on pleasure she was bent.
She had a frugal mind.
The morning came, the chaise was brought.
But yet was not allow’d
To drive up to the door, lest all
Should say that she was proud.
So three doors off the post was stay'd.
Where they did all get in,
Six precious souls, and all agog
To dash through thick and thin.
Smack went the whip, round went the wheels,
Were never folk so glad,
The stones did rattle underneath
As if Cheapside were mad.
John Gilpin at his horse’s side
Seized fast the flowing mane.
And up he got in haste to ride.
But soon came down again.
For saddle-tree scarce reached had he.
His journey to begin.
When, turning round his head, he saw
Three customers come in.
So down he came; for loss of time.
Although it grieved him sore.
Yet loss of pence, full well he knew, .
Would trouble him much more.
*Twas long before the customers
Were suited to their mind.
When Betty screaming came down stairs,
“The wine is left behind.’’
Good lack! quoth he, yet bring it me.
My leathern belt likewise.
In which I bear my trusty sword
When I do exorcise.
Now Mistress Gilpin, careful soul.
Had two stone bottles found.
To hold the liquor that she loved, ?
And keep it safe and sound.
Each bottle had a curling ear.
Through which the belt he drew.
And hung a bottle on each side.
To make his balance true.
Then over all, that he might be
Equipp’d from top to toe.
His long red cloak, well brush’d and neat,
He manfully did throw.
Now see him mounted once again
Upon his nimble steed.
Full slowly pacing o’er the stones
With caution and good heed.
But, finding soon a smoother road
Beneath his well-shod feet,
The snorting beast began to trot.
Which gall’d him in his seat.
So, ‘Fair and softly,' John he cried.
But John he cried in vain;
That trot became a gallop soon.
In spite of curb and rein.
So stooping down, as needs he must,
Who cannot sit upright.
He grasp'd the mane with both his bands.
And eke with all his might.
His horse who never in that sort
Had handled been before.
What thing upon his back had got
Did wonder more and more.
Away went Gilpin, neck or nought.
Away went hat and wig!
He little dreamt when he set out
Of running such a rig.
The wind did blow, the cloak did fly,
Like streamer long and gay.
Till, loop and button failing both.
At last it flew away.
Then might all people well discern
The bottles he had slung,
A bottle swinging at each side.
As hath been said or sung.
The dogs did bark, the children scream’d.
Up flew the windows all,
And ev’ry soul cried out, Well done 1
As loud as he could bawl.
Away went Gilpin—who but he ?
His fame soon spread around—
He carries weight, he rides a race I
'Tis for a thousand pound!
And still as fast as he drew near,
'Twas wonderful to view.
How in a trice the turnpike men
Their gates wide open threw.
And now as he went bowing down
His reeking head full low,
The bottles twain behind his back
Were shatter’d at a blow.
Down ran the wine into the road.
Most piteous to be seen,
Which mode his horse’s flanks to smoke
As they had basted been.
But still he seem’d to carry weight.
With leathern girdle braced.
For all might see the bottle-necks
Still dangling at his waist.
Thus all through merry Islington
These gambols he did play,
And till he came unto the Wash
Of Edmonton so gay.
And there he threw the wash about
On both sides of the way,
Just like unto a trundling mop.
Or a wild-goose at play.
At Edmonton his loving wife
Prom the baloony spied
Her tender husband, wond’ring much
To see how he did ride.
Stop, stop, John Gilpin!—Here’s the house—
They all at once did cry.
The dinner waits and we are tired:—
Said Gilpin—So am I.
But yet his horse was not a wit
Inclined to tarry there ;
For why ? his owner had a house
Pull ten miles off, at Ware.
So like an arrow swift he flew
Shot by an archer strong;
So did he fly—which brings me to
The middle of my song.
Away went Gilpin, out of breath.
And sore against his will.
Till at his friend the Calender’s
His horse at lost stood still.
The Calender, amazed to see
His neighbour in such trim,
Laid down his pipe, flew to the gate,
And thus accosted him:—
What news ? what news ? your tidings tell.
Tell me you must and shall—
Say why bare-headed you are come.
Or why you come at alh
Now Gilpin had a pleasant wit.
And loved a timely joke.
And thus unto the Calender
In merry guise he spoke:—
I came because your horse would come j
And if 1 well forebode.
My hat and wig will soon be here.
They are upon the road.
The Calender, right glad to find
His friend in merry pin,
Beturn’d him not a single word.
But to the house went in.
Whence straight he came with hat and wigj
A wig that flow’d behind,
A hat not much the worse of wear.
Each comely in its kind.
He held them up, and in his turn
Thus show’d his ready wit :
My head is twice as big as yours.
They therefore needs must flt.
But let me scrape the dirt away
That hangs upon your face j
And stop and eat, for well you may
Be m a hungry case.
Said John—lt is my wedding-day.
And all the world would stare.
If wife should dine at Edmonton,
And I should dine at Ware.
So, turning to his horse, he said—
I am in haste to dine ;
'Twas for your pleasure you came here.
You shall go back for mine.
Ah, luckless speech and bootless boast t
For which he paid full dear;
For, while he spake, a braying ass
Did sing most loud and clear.
Whereat his horse did snort, as he
Had heard a lion roar,
And gallop’d off with all his might.
As he had done before.
Away went Gilpin, and away
Went Gilpin’s hat and wig !
He lost them sooner than at first.
For why ? —they were to big.
Now Mistress Gilpin, when she saw
Her husband posting down
Into the country far away.
She pull’d out half a crown.
And thus unto the youth she said
That drove them to the Bell, —
This shall be your’s when you bring back
My husband safe and well.
The youth did ride, and soon did meet
John coming back amain ;
Whom in a tnce he tried to stop.
By catching at his rein.
But not performing what he meant,
And gladly would have done,
The frighted steed he frighted more.
And mode him faster run.
Away went Gilpin, and away
Wont post-boy at his heels !
The post-boy’s horse right glad to miss
The lumb’ring of the wheels.
Six gentlemen upon the road.
Thus seeing Gilpin fly.
With post-boy scamp’ring in the rear.
They raised the hue and cry:—
Stop thief I stop thief!—a highwayman!
Not one of them was mute;
And all and each that pass’d that way
Did join in the pursuit.
And now the turnpike gates again
Flew open in short space ;
The toll-men thinking, as before,
That Gilpin rode a race.
And so he did, and won it too.
For he got first to town ;
Nor stopp’d till where he had got up
He did again get down.
Now let us sing, Long live the king,
And Gilpin long live he ;
And when he next doth ride abroad,
May I be there to see.


OLD WOMEN STORIES.
THE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.
THERE was an old woman who lived in a shoe.
She had so many children—such naughty ones too!——
She cried, “Oh, dear me, I don’t know what to do.
Who would he an old woman, and live in a shoe?”
Once ninety little fellows sat down on the floor
And lustily screamed, “we wont cry any more!”
“Then stop crying now,” the old woman said,
The noise you are making goes right through my head.
Then she gave the hoys broth without any bread,
And whipped them all soundly and sent them to bed.
She scolded the girls, and said, “Don’t make a noise,
Or you shall be served just the same as the boys.”


mother Goose.
Old Mother Goose, when
She wanted to wander.
Would ride through the air
On a very fine gander.
Mother Goose had a house,
’Twas built in a wood.
Where an owl at the door
For sentinel stood.
She had a son Jack,
A plain-looking lad.
He was not very good.
Nor yet very bad.
She sent him to market;
A live goose he bought;
Here, mother, says he.
It will not go for nought.
Jack’s goose and her gander
They grew very fond;
They’d both eat together.
Or swim in one pond.
Jack found one morning.
As I have been told.
His goose had laid him
An egg of pure gold.
Jack rode to his mother.
The news for to tell.
She call’d him a good boy.
And said it was well.
Jack sold his gold egg
To a rogue of a Jew,
Who cheated him out of
The half of his due.
Then Jack went a-courting
A lady so gay.
As fair as the Jriy,
And sweet as the May.
The Jew and the Squire
Came behind his back.
And began to belabour
The sides of poor Jack.
Then old Mother Goose
That instant came in.
And turned her son Jack
Into fam’d Harlequin.
She then with her wand
Touch’d the lady so fine.
And turn’d her at once
Into sweet Columbine.
The gold egg in the sea
Was quickly thrown, when
Jack gave'a quick dive.
And soon got it agtfin.
The Jew got the goose.
Which he vow’d he would kill,
Resolving at once
His pockets to fill.
Jack’s mother came in.
And caught the goose soon.
And mounting its back.
Flew up to the moon.

Old Woman who lived In a Shell.
A little old woman, as I’ve heard tell.
Lived negj the sea, in a nice little shell;
She was well off if she wanted her tea — .
She’d plenty of water from out of the sea.
Then if for her dinner she had the least wish.
Of course she had nothing to do but to fish;
So, really, this little old woman did well.
As she didn’t pay rent for the use of the shell.
Old Woman Swallowed.
There was an old woman call’d Nothing-
at-all.

small:

extent,

went.
Old Woman’s Calf.
There was an old woman sat spinning.

was Peg;

cork-leg.

water.

follow’d a’ter.
Old Woman of Stepney.
At Stepney there lived.
As every one knows.
An old woman who had
A plum tree on her nose!
The boys, while she slept.
Would cautiously take
The plums from her tree
Before she could wake.
This old woman went
One day to the lawn
Of my Lord Cockagee,
And there saw a fawn.
Having shot him, she tied
His hind legs to her tree.
And so quitted the lawn
Of my Lord Cockagee.
She’d nearly reached home.
When the constables came.
And put her in prison
For killing the game.
While locked in her cell.
She thought again and again
Of how to escape.
But kept thinking in vain.
She considered each plan.
Till she found out a way
Of escaping from prison
In the course of the day.
She cut the plum tree
Close off from her nose.
And made a scarecrow,
Dress’d up in her clothes; ,
This she set on a stool.
With its back to the wall.
And watch’d near the door
For fear it should fall.
Soon the jailor came in
With her water and bread;
He stared at the figure.
While from prison she fled.
The old woman reached home,
Singing diddle-dee-dee;
And again on her nose
There grew a plum tree.

And when he came back
She gave him a wink.
Daddy went to Cole’s Book Arcade
For an Exercise Book,
And when he came back
Puss gave a wise look.
Daddy went to Cole’s Book Arcade
To buy Puss a purse.
And when he came back
She was singing a verse.
Daddy went to Cole’s Book Arcade
And Oh me! Oh my !
When he came back
Puss had swallowed a fly-
Daddy went to Cole’s Book Arcade
Some paper to buy.
And when he came back
Puss thought she would die.
Daddy went to the doctor’s
To get Puss a pill.
And when he came back
She still looked very ill.
Daddy went to the Auction sale
To buy Puss a bed.
And when he came back
Puss shammed to be dead.
This was a very wise, knowing
Puss; she could read and write, and
liked books very, very much, and
didn’t want to die and be buried, and
leave all the mice, and milk, and
sausages, and nice books; so she
made haste and got better, and when
Daddy went to the cemetery
To dig her a grave.
Puss rushed off at once
Into Cole’s Book Arcade :
And that is the present residence
of Miss Puss.


DAME TROT.
Dame Trot once went to a neighbouring fair.
And what do you think she bought herself there P
A Pussy! the prettiest ever was seen;
No cat was so gentle, so clever and clean.
Each dear little paw was as black as a sloe.
The rest of her fur was as white as the snow,
Her eyes were bright green, and her sweet little
face
Was pretty and meek, full of innocent grace.
Dame Trot hurried home with this beautiful cat;
Went upstairs to take off her cloak and her hat;
And when she came down was astonished to see
That Pussy was busy preparing the tea,
" Oh, what a strange cat I ” thought poor little
Dame Trot,
" She’ll break my best china and upset the pot.”
But no harm befell them : the velvety paws
Were quite sure; the dame for alarm had no
cause.
Next morning when little Dame Trot
came downstairs.
To attend, as usual, to household affairs.
She found that the kitchen was swept up as
clean
As if Puss a regular servant had been.
The tea stood to draw, and the toast was
done brown;
The Dame very pleased to her breakfast
sat down;
While Puss by her side on an armchair sat,
up, 1
Anri lapp’d her warm milk from a nice china
cup.
Now Spot, the old house-dog, looked on in
amaze.
He’d never been used to such queer cattish
ways; .
But Puss mew’d so sweetly, and moved with
such grace.
That Spot at last liked her, and licked her
white face.
Poor little Dame Trot had no money to
spare.
And only too often her cupboard was bare;
Then kind Mrs. Pussy would catch a nice fish.
And serve it for dinner upon a clean dish.
The rats and the mice, who wished Pussy to
please.
Were nowne ver seen at the butter and cheese;
The Dame daily found that their numbers
grew thinner.
For Puss ate a mouse every day for her
dinner.
If Puss had a weakness, I needs but confess
■Twas a Girl of the period’s fancy for dress.
Her greatest desire a high chignon and hat:
And a very short dress a la mode for a cat.
So one day when Dame Trot had gone out to
dine.
Puss dressed herself up, as she thought very
fine.
And coaxed kind old Spot, who looked at her
with pride.
To play pony for her, and give her a nde.
Now Spot, who to welcome his mistress desired.
And to "company manners’’ had never aspired.
Jumped up to fawn on her—and down came the
cat.
And crushed in her tumble, her feather and hat,
•%
"Oh Puss 1 ” said Dame Trot, what a very sad
mess!
You’d best have remained in your natural dress;
The graces which nature so kindly bestows
Are more often hid than improved by fine clothes.
Mistress Puss and Doggy.
A little dog said, and he looked very wise,
" I think, Mistress Puss,
You make a great fuss
With your back and your great green eyes.
And you, Madam Duck,
You waddle and cluck.
Till it gives one the fidgets to hear you;
You had better run off
To the old pigs trough.
Where none but the pigs ma’am, are near yon.”
The duck was good-natured, and she ran away;
But old pussy-cat.
With her back up sat,
And said she intended to stay;
And she showed him her paws.
With her sharp, long claws.
So the dog was afraid to come near.
For puss, if she pleases,
When a little dog teases.
Can give him a box on the ear.
Head In the Milk- Jug.
Ho! Master, Mistress, Mary run.
Your Tibby is in grief;
This broken jug caught hold of me.
As though I were a thief.
Cat up the plumtree*
Diddledy, diddledy, dumpty;
The cat ran up a plum-tree.
I’ll lay you a crown
I’ll fetch her down;
So diddledy, diddledy, dumpty,
Pussy-Cat Mole.
Pussy-Cat Mole,
Jump’d over a coal.
And in her best petticoat burnt a great hole.
Poor Pussy’s weeping, she’ll have no more milk.
Until her best petticoat’s mended with silk.
The Three Little Kittens.
Three little kittens they lost their mittens.
And they began to cry.
" Oh I mammy dear, we sadly fear
Our mittens we have lost!"
" What! lost your mittens.
You naughty kittens.
Then you shall have no pie."
Miew, miew, miew, miew.
The three little kittens had need of mittens;
The winter now was nigh.
" Oh 1 mammy dear, we fear, we fear,
Our mittens we shall need."
" Go, seek your mittens.
You silly kittens;
There’s tempest in the sky.”
Miew, miew, miew, miew.
The three little kittens, in seeking their
mittens.
Upset the table high.
"Oh 1 mammy dear, we doubt and fear
The house is tumbling down."
" You foolish kittens.
Go, find your mittens.
And do not make things fly."
Miew, miew, miew, miew.
The three little kittens they found their
mittens.
And they began to cry,
•*oh! mammy dear, see here, see here,
Our mittens we have found.”
" What! found your mittens.
You little kittens,
Then you shall have some pie."
Purr, purr, purr, purr.
. The three little kittens put on their mittens,
: And soon ate up the pie;
r " Oh I mammy dear, we greatly fear.
Our mittens we have soiled."
"What! soiled your mittens.
You naughty kittens ! ’’
; Then they began to sigh.
Miew, miew, miew, miew.
'The three little kittens they washed their
‘ mittens.
And hung them up to dry ;
[" Oh! mammy dear, look here, look here,
j Our mittens we have washed."
“ What! washed your mittens.
You darling kittens !
But I smell a rat close by!
Hush! hush 1 ” Miew, miew.
The three little kittens put off their mittens,
A hunting match to try.
" Oh! mammy dear, his hole is here;
Our mittens down we fling."
Both cat and kittens
Flung down their mittens;
When —whisk! —the rat ran by,
Miew, miew, miew, miew.
The Dunce of a Kitten.
Come, pussy, will you learn to read ?
I’ve got a pretty book;
Nay, turn this way, you must, indeed;
Fie, there’s a sulky look t
Here is a pretty picture, sea
An apple and great A;
How stupid you will ever be.
If you do naught but play I
Come, A, B, C, an easy task.
What any one can easy do;
I will do anything you ask.
For dearly I love you.
No, no, your lesson is not done.
You have not learnt it half;
You’ll grow a downright simpleton.
And make the people laugh.
Don’t hurt Puss.
I like little pussy, her coat is so warm.
And if I don’t hurt her she’ll do me no harm; .
So I’ll not pull her tail, nor drive her away, I
But pussy and I very gently will play.


Puss in the Well.
Ding dong dell, pussy’s in the well!
Who put her in ?—little Tommy Lin.
Who pulled her ou t? —dog with long snout.
What a naughty boy was that
To drown poor pussy cat.
Who never did any harm.
But kill’d the mice in his father’s barn.
The sinsinsCat.
A cat came fiddling out of a barn,
With a pair of bagpipes under her arm;
She could sing nothing but fiddle cum fee.
The mouse has married the humble-bee.
Pipe, cat, —dance, mouse.
We’ll have a wedding at our good house.
Puss In London.
Pussy-cat, pussy-cat, where have you
been ?
I’ve been up to London to look at the
queen.
Pussy-cat, pussy-cat, what did you
there ?
I frighten’d a little mouse under the
chair.
Pnssey-Cat and Mousey.
Pussey-Cat lives in the servant’s hall.
She can set up her back, and purr;
The little Mice live in a crack in the
wall,
But they hardly dare venture to
stir; _ [the air.
For whenever they think of taking
Or filling their little maws.
The Pussey-Cat says, " Come out if
you dare;
I will catch you all with my claws.”
Scrabble, scrabble, scrabble, went all
the little Mice,
Fortheysmelt the Cheshire cheese;
The Pussey-Cat said, “It smells very
nice.
Now no come out, if you ple?"»e.”
“Squeak,” said the little Mouse;
“squeak, squeak, squeak,”
Said all the young ones too;
"We never creep out when cats are
about.
Because we’re afraid of you ’
So the cunning old Cat lay dow~ on a
mat
By the fire in the servants’ hall:
"If the little Mice peep, they’ll think
I’m asleep;’’
So she rolled herself up like a ball.
" Squeak,” said the little Mouse, "we’ll
creep out
And eat some Cheshire cheese.
That silly old Cat is asleep on the mat.
And we may sup at our ease.”
Nibble, nibble, nibble went all the little
Mice,
And they licked their little paws;
Then the cunning old Cat sprang up from
* the mat.
And caught them all with her claws.
CAT STORIES.
Puss 111 the Pantry.
Hie, hie, says Anthony, puss is in the pantry
Gnawing, gnawing a mutton, mutton-bone;
See now she tumbles it, see now she
mumbles it.
See how she tosses the mutton, mutton-bone.
Dick killed Puss.
Ho look at the cat! why, what is she at?
She’s catching a rat that’s hid in Dick’s hat.
Dick ran for a bat to knock him down flat.
But, crossing the mat the foolish young brat
Tripped up and fell flat. He half killed the cat
Instead of the rat. Hal cried out that that
Was just tit for tat.
Puss and the Monkey.
Says Mr. Monkey, giving a winks
"It would be exceedingly funny, I think.
To catch the cat, and give her a drink.
Out of a great big bottle of ink.”
So, suiting the action to the word.
He caught up Puss, but she demurred;
And made such a noise you never heard.
And said ’twas worse than eating a bird.
The Puss she didn’t like ink at all!
She didn’t like bottles great or small;
Ink to her was worse than gall.
And so she did nothing but spit, mew, and
squall. And that’s all!
SING, SING.
Sing, sing, what shall I sing?
The cat has ate the pudding-string!
Do, do, what shall I do ?
The cat has bit it quite in two.
Good Puss.
Poor Puss, dear, lovely pretty puss.
Content at home to stay;
Thy pleasure’s shown in gambol tricks
And loves to skip and play.
Grateful for every sup of milk.
And every bit of meat;
Gives lively proof of gratitude.
By singing while you eat.
See, how she cleans her sleeky skin!
A soil would prove a flaw;
She licks her neck, her sides, her back.
And don’t forget her paw.
Mary’s Puss drowned.
Mary had a little cat.
With long snow-white hair.
Such a merry little cat.
Jumping everywhere.
When Mary went to take a walk,
Pussey ran to meet her,
Eubbed its head against her frock.
And said, ‘ Purr, Purr,’ to greet her.
Once, when Mary was at school.
Some cruel bad boys found it.
And in a pond beside the road.
Oh, sad to tell, they drowned it!
Poor Mary’s face was wet with tears.
When she found pussy lying:—
I would not be a cruel boy.
To set poor Mary crying.
My Pussy.
I love little pussy, her coat is so
warm; [no harm.
And if I don’t hurt her, she’ll do me
So I’ll not pull her tail, nor drive
her away.
But pussy and I very gently will play.
She’ll sit by my side, and I’ll give
her some food;
And pussy will love me, because I
am good.
Oh! here is Miss Pussy; she’s drink-
king her milk;
Her coat is as soft and as glossy as silk.
She sips the milk up with her little
lap-lap;
Then, wiping her whiskers, lies down
for a nap.
My kitty is gentle, she loves me right
well;
How funny her play is I’m sure I can’t tell.
Now under the sofa, now under the table.
She runs and plays bo-peep as well as
she’s able.
Oh! dearly I love her! you never did see
Two happier play-mates than kitty and
me.

PUSS IN BOOTS.
Onca upon a time there was a miller who had
three sons. When he was dying he left each of
them a legacy. To his eldest son he left his
mill; to the second his ass; and to the youngest
his cat. The poor boy was very sad when he
found that he had nothing belonging to him but
a cat; but to his great surprise, puss jumped on
the table, and said in a friendly manner: “Do
not be sad my dear master. Only buy me a pair
of boots and a bag, and I will provide for you
and myself." So the miller’s son, who had a
shilling or two in his pocket, bought a smart
little pair of boots and a bag, and gave them to
puss, who put some bran and sow-thistles into
his bag, opened the mouth of it, and lay down in
a rabmt warren. A foolish young rabbit jumped
into it; puss drew the string and soon killed it.
He went immediately to the palace with it. He
found the king and queen sitting on their throne;
and bowing low, he laid the rabbit at the king’s
feet, saying: “ Please your majesty, my master,
the Marquis de Carabas, has sent you a rabbit
from his*warren, as a mark of respect." “I
am much obliged to the Marquis,” said the
king, and he ordered the rabbit to be taken
to the cook, and a piece of money to be given
to the cat.
During two or three months the cat con-
tinued to carry game every now and then to
the King, which was supposed to be the
produce of his master’s sport. One day
when he happened to hear the King was
going t j take a drive on the banks of the
river, in company with his daughter, who
was the most beautiful princess in the world,
puss desired his master to go and bathe in
the river at the spot that he should point
out, and leave the rest to him. The Marquis
of Carabas did as his cat advised him. Just
as he was bathing, the King came past,
when the cat bawled out as loud as he could,
"Help! help! or the Marquis of Carabas
will be drowned 1” On hearing this, the King
looked out of the carriage-window, and
recognising the cat, ordered his bodyguards
to fly to the assistance of my Lord Marquis
of Carabas. As the poor Marquis was being
fished out of the river, the cat informed his
Majesty that, while his master was bathing,
some robbers had stolen his clothes. The
King immediately ordered the gentlemen of
his wardrobe to go and fetch one of his most
sumptuous dresses. No sooner had this
been done and the Marquis suitably attired,
than he looked to such advantage, that the
King took him for a very fine gentleman;
while the princess was so struck with his
appearance, that at once she became over
head and ears in love with him. ,
The King insisted that the Marquis
should get into the carriage. The cat,
highly delighted at the turn things were
taking, now ran on before, and having
reached a meadow where there were some
peasants, he thus accosted them:" I say,
good folks, if you do not tell the King that
this field belongs to the Marquis of Carabas,
you shall all be chopped as fine as mince-
meat." The King did not fail to inquire of
the peasants to whom the meadow belonged
“To the Marquis of Carabas, please your
Majesty,’’ said they in a breath.
And the cat kept running on before the
carriage, and repeating the same instructions
to all the labourers he met with, so that the
King was astonished at the vast possessions of
the Marquis of Carabas.
At length the cat reached a magnificent castle
belonging to a Giant, who was immensely rich.
The cat having inquired what sort of a person
the Giant might be, and what he was able to do,
sent in a message to request leave to speak with
him.
The Giant received him civilly. "Ihave been
told,” said the cat, “that you have the power
of transforming yourself into all sorts of
animals.” “ So I have,” replied the Giant, “and
to prove the truth of what I say, you shall see
me become a lion.”
When the cat beheld a lion standing before
him, and saw the monster quietly light his pipe,
he was seized with such a panic that he clam-
bered up to the roof. After a time, the cat
perceiving that the Giant had returned to his
natural shape, came down again.
“And do you possess the power of assuming
the shape of the smallest animals likewise?’*
“You shall see;” and the Giant immediately
assumed the shape of a mouse, when the cat
pounced upon him and ate him up.
By this time the King had reached the gates
of the Giant’s manguificent castle, and ex-
pressed a wish to enter so splendid a building.
The cat ran out to meet the King, saying, “Your
Majesty is welcome to the Marquis of Carabas’s
castle.”
The King was so delighted with the Marquis
of Carabas, that he accepted him as his son-in-
law, and that very same day he was married to
the princess.
The eat became a great lord and ever after
hunted mice only for his own amusement.
MONKEY AND THE CATS.
Two hungry cats, having stolen some cheese,
could not agree between themselves how to
divide their booty; therefore they went to law,
and a cunning monkey was to decide their cause.
“ Let us see,” said the judge, (with as arch a
look as could be); “ay, ay, this slice truly out-
weighs the other; " and with that he bit off a
large piece, in order as he told them, to make a
fair balance.
The other scale had now become too heavy,
which gave this upright judge a pretence to
make free with a second mouthful.
“Hold! hold!" cried the two cats; “give
each of us our share of what is left, and we will
be content.”
“If you are content," said the monkey,
"justice is not; the law, my friends, must
have its course.”
Upon this, he nibbled first one piece and then
the other, till the poor cats, seeing their cheese
in a fair way to be all eaten up, most humbly
begged him not to put himself to any further
trouble, to give them what still remained.
“Ha! ha! ha! not so fast, I beseech you, good
ladies," said the monkey; "we owe justice to
ourselves as well as to you; and what remains
is due to me as the lawyer.” Upen this, he
crammed the whole into ms mouth at once, and
very gravely broke up the court!
This fable teaches us that it is better to put
up with a trifling loss, than to run the risk of
losing all we have by going to law.
Dick Whittington and his Cat.
There was once a Lord Mayor of London,
whose name was Sir Richard Whittington. He
rose to that office from being a poor orphan,
living in a distant village. Dick was a sharp
boy, and was always picking up knowledge from
some of the villagers. Dick heard of the great
City of London; he often heard it said that the
streets were paved all over with gold.
One day seeing a waggon and team of horses
on the road to London, he took courage and
asked the waggoner to let him walk by his side.
Having gained permission they set off together.
When Dick got to London he was very .eager to
see the fine streets paved all over with gold, but
the poor boy saw nothing but dirt instead of
gold, so he crouched down- at the door of
one Mr. Fitzwarren, a great merchant.
Here he was soon found by an ill-tempered
cook, who ordered him to go about his
business. But just at this moment Mr.
Fitzwarren himself came home, and finding
that the poor boy was willing to work he
took him into his house, and said that he
should be kept to do what dirty work he
was able for the cook. The cook was always
scolding him from morning till night, and
was very cruel to him. Poor Dick had
another hardship. His bed was placed in a
garret where there were great numbers of
rats and mice, which ran over his face, and
made a great noise. Dick at last bought a
eat which was famous for being an excellent
mouser.
Soon after this, the merchant, who had a
ship ready to sail, asked his servants if they
would send any goods abroad. All the
servants mentioned something they were
willing to venture, but poor Whittington, who
said he had nothing but a cat, which was
his companion.
“ Fetch thy cat, boy," said Mr. Fitzwarren,
11 and let her go." Dick hesitated for some
time, at last he brought poor puss, and
delivered her to the captain with tears in
his eyes. The cook continued to be so cruel
to him that the unhappy fellow determined
to leave his place. He accordingly packed
up his few things, and travelled as far as
Holloway, and there sat down on a stone.
While he was there musing. Bow-bells
began to ring; and it seemed to him that
their sounds said :
“Tun, again Whittington,
L i rd Mayor of London."
So back wifcrC Dick, and got into the house
before the ceok came down stairs.
The ship with Dick’s cat on board hap-
pened to be driven by contrary winds on a
part of the coast of Barbary inhabited by
Moors, who showed great eagerness to pur-
chase the things with which the ship was
laden. Ti e captain seeing this, took patterns
of tjM. choicest articles he had to the
KingSff the Moors. While he was showing
them to him, dinnerwas brought in; andat once
lots of rats and mice came and ate up all the
dainties. The captain was astonished when the ,
King told him this often happened. The captain ,
rushed off at once to the ship, and brought Puss (
to the palace. The second dinner had been
brought in, and, as usual, in came the rats and
mice: Pussy at sight of them sprang out of the
captain's arms, and killed lota of them, and
the rest ran off to their holes. The King was 1
greatly pleased with the wonderful Puss, and j
gave two sackfuls of geld for the cat, and the
captain at once sailed for London. When Mr.
Fitzwarren heard the news, he ordered Dick i
Whittington to be called, and showed him all
the riches which the captain had brought in ex-
change for his cat. Dick now was a rich man,
and soon after married the merchant’s daughter,
at the very church whose bells seemed to call
him back to London. Ho grew richer and
richer, became Sheriff, and at length Lord
mayor of London.

TO PARENTS AND SCHOOLMASTERS.
I have been blamed for printing and distributing “Mother Hubbard.’’ My answer is:—“ Old Mother Hubbard ” has done more towards the
education of young children than perhaps any piece of reading in existence. Amongst the eighty millions of English speaking people in all parts of
the earth, there are very few but can repeat a part or the whole of “ Mother Hubbard,” and I have seen it somewhere asserted that it is to be found
in almost every home in the civilized world. Its rude style of poetry tells nothing against it. The child knows nothing of correct metre; as long
as tkere is a jingling rhyme it is satisfied. The dog is the domestic animal in millions of families, and in numberless cases is actually a more loved
companion than brothers and sisters. A simple rhyme, therefore, about this attached, playful, and constant companion is sure to fascinate the
young, and it has fascinated more than a thousand millions of the little dears, I firmly believe that it would produce grand results if a pretty
illustrated edition of the principal nursery rhymes was made a text-book in infant schools. You may try and try, and try again, to drive an ordinary
dry school-book lesson into the infant mind, and make very little progress—it is up-hill work. But take an illustrated edition of a nursery rhyme,
say the death of “ Cook Eobin,” or "Mother Hubbard," and call the little one to you, begin to teach it—how eager, how intent does it begin to
learn now! what animation in it’s little eyes; what music in it’s little, joyous, interested voice. It learns this lesson ten times as fast as the other
one, and gives you ten times the pleasure in teaching it, and this kind of teaching gradually and insensibly leads the child into a love of learning; it
interests and sets the young enquiring mind at work. We all know how much easier it is to do a work we are interested in than a work we are not
It is just so with the child, and for that reason I would commence to teach the infant mind with that which pleased it best, and so gradually create
a love for reading. For years I have allowed numbers of little children, of their own accord, to stand and read nursery rhymes to themselves, and to
each other, and youths to read interesting and instructive fiction gratis in the Book Arcade, and I hold that by its enticingly creating a love of
reading, which will lead tosomething higher, mine is one of the best and most effective schools inthe country.—|

PUPPY.
There was an Old Man of Leghorn,
The smallest as ever was born:
But quickly snapt up he
Was once by a puppy.
Who devoured that Old Man of Leghorn.
DOGGY.
The cat sat asleep by the side of the fire.
The mistress snored loud as a pig;
Jack took up his fiddle by doggy’s desire.
And struck up a bit of a jig.
Hark, the Dogs bark.
Hark, hark, the dogs do bark.
Beggars are coming to town ;
Some in jags, some in rags.
And some in velvet gown.
Poor Dos Bright.
Poor dog Bright
Ean off with all his might.
Because the cat was after him:
Peor dog Bright.
Dog Blue Bell.
I had a little dog, and his name was
Blue Bell,
I gave him some work, and he did it
very well;
I sent him up stairs to pick up a pin.
He stepped in the coal-scuttle up to
the chin;
I sent him to the garden to pick some
sage.
He tumbled down and fell in a rage;
I sent him to the cellar to draw a pot
of beer.
He came up again and said there was
none there.
Little Dog Buff.
I had a little dog, and they call’d
him Buff;
I sent him to the shop for a hap’orth
of snuff;
But he lost the bag, and spill’d the
snuff.
So take that cuff, and that’s enough.
Dog burnt his Tail.
Ding, dong, darrow.
The cat and the sparrow;
The little dog has burnt his tail.
And he shall be bang’d to-morrow.
Thievish Dos Fan.
Thievish dog Fan, to yell aloud began.
She burnt her mouth through stealing
Thievish dog Fan. [tripe:
The Quarrelsome Dogs.
Old Tray and rough Growler are having
a fight.
So let us get out of their way;
They snarl, and they growl, and they bite.
Oh dear, what a terrible fray!
GOOD LITTLE DOG.
I will not hurt my little dog.
But stroke and pat his head;
I like to see him wag his tail,
I like to see him fed.
Poor little thing, how very good.
And very useful too;
For don’t you know that he will mind
What he is bid to do ?
Then I will never hurt my dog.
Nor ever give him pain;
But treat him kindly every day,
And he’ll love me again.
PUSS and ROVER.
Our Pussy she is white,
Our Eover he is black.
And yet he licks the Pussy’s face
While she stands on his back.
Our Pussy she is little.
Our Eover he is big.
And yet he likes the Pussy
Much better than the pig.
Our Pussy she is young.
And Eover he is old.
And yet he likes the Pussy
More than tons of gold.
Our Pussy she is good.
And so is Eover too.
So Pussy says, “Ta, ta,” "Good-bye,**
And Eover says " Adieu. ”
Don’t Tease Bogs.
Fooligh Edward runs away
From the large dog with the bone;
If we do not tease or chide.
Dogs will leave us quite alone.
No Breakfast for Growler.
No, naughty Growler, get away.
You shall not have a bit;
Now when I speak, how dare you stay ?
I can’t spare any. Sir, I say.
And so you need not sit.
Poor Growler! do not make him go.
But recollect, before.
That he has never served you so.
For you have given him many a blow.
That patiently he bore.
Poor Growler! if he could but speak,
! He’d tell (as well he might)
How he would bear with many a freak.
And wag his tdil, and look so meek.
And neither bark nor bite.
Upon his back he lets you ride.
All round and round the yard;
And now, while sitting by your side.
To have a bit of bread denied,
Is really very hard.
And all your'little tricks he’ll bear.
And never seem to mind;
And yet you say you cannot spare
One bit of breakfast for his share.
Although he is so kind.
Good Dog Tray.
Good Dog Tray
Watched Tommy t’other day,
In the garden fast asleep:
Good Dog Tray.
Poor Old Tray.
See, here is poor old Tray;
Good dog to run so fast.
To meet my sister May and me.
Now school is o’er at last.
Oh! how I love you. Tray,
You are so kind to me;
You run beside me in my walks,
. You sit by me at tea.
’Tis true that I give you bits
Of cake and bread and meat;
But I am sure you’d love as well
If you had naught to eat.
For faithful, true, and kind
Is our old darling Tray;
He guards our dwelling all the night.
And plays with us by day.
Deggy minds the Honse.
" Come hither, little puppy dog.
I’ll give you’a nice new collar,
If you will learn to read your book
And be a clever scholar.”
"No, no! ” replied the puppy dog,
" I’ve other fish to fryv
For I must learn to guard your house,
Amd bark when thieves come nigh.”

The Old Woman and her PI?.
Once an old woman was sweeping her house
and found a crooked sixpence, and went to
market to buy a pig. As she was coming
home, she came to a stile, and the pig would
not get over it; so she went a little farther and
met a dog, and said to the dog:—
"Dog, dog, bite pig;
Piggy won’t get over the stile;
And I shan’t get home to night,”
But the dog would not.
She went alittle farther, and met a stick and said:
"Stick, stick, beat dog; dog won’t bite pig j
Piggy won’t get over the stile,
And I shan’t get home to night.”
But the stick would not.
She went a little farther, and met a fire and said:
" Fire, fire, burn stick; stick won’t beat dog;
Dog won’t bite pig;
Piggy won’t get over the stile;
And I shan’t get home to night."
But the fire would not.
She went a little farther, and met some water,
and said:
" Water, water, quench fire;
Fire won’t burn stick;
Stick won’t beat dog; dog won’t bite pig;
Piggy won’t get over the stile.
And I shan’t get home to-night.”
But the water would not.
She went a little farther, and met an ox and
said;
"Ox, ox, drink water;
Water won’t quench fire;
Fire won’t bum stick:
Stick won’t beat dog, dog won t bite pig,
Piggy won’t get over the stile;
And I shan’t get home to-night.”
But the ox would not.
She went a little farther, and met a butcher
and said;
"Butcher, butcher, kill ox;
Ox won’t drink water;
Water won’t quench fire.
Fire won’t burn stick.
Stick won’t beat dog, dog won t bite pig,
Piggy won’t get over the stile.
And I shan’t get home to night.”
But the butcher would not.
She went alittle farther, and met a rope and said;
"Hope, rope, hang butcher.
Butcher won’t kill ox, ox won t drink water,
Water won’t quench fire, fire won’t burn stick#
Stick won’t beat dog, dog won’t bite pig.
Piggy won’t get over the stile.
And I shan’t get home to night.”
But the rope would not.
She wont a little farther, and met a rat and said I
"Eat, rat, gnaw rope,
Eope won’thang butcher, butcherwon tkillox.
Ox won’t drink water, water won’t quench fire.
Fire won’t bum stick, stick won’t beat dog,
Dog won’t bite pig.
Piggy won’t get over the stile.
And I shan’t get home to night.”
But the rat would not.
She went a little farther and met a cat and said t
"Cat, cat, kill rat, rat won’t gnaw rope,
Eope won’t hang butcher, .
Butcher won’t kill ox, ox won’t dnuk water.
Water wont quench fire, fire won’t bum stick#
Stick won’t beat dog, dog won’t bite pig.
Piggy won’t get over the stile.
And I shan’t get home to night
But the cat said to her,“lf you will go to
yonder cow, and fetch me a saucer of milk, I will
kill the rat." So away went the old woman to
the cow, and said:
Cow, cow, give me some milk, cat won’t kill rat,
Eat won’t gnaw rope, rope won’t hang butcher.
Butcher won’t kill ox, ox won’t drink water.
Water won’t quench fire, fire won’t bum stick.
Stick won’t beat dog, dog won’t bite pig.
Piggy won’t get over the stile.
And I shan’t get home to night.”
But the cow said to her,“lf you will go to yonder hay-
makers, and fetchmeawisp of hay, I’ll give you the milk.”
So away the old woman went to the haymakers and said:
"Haymakers, give me a wisp of hay.
Cow won’t give me milk, cat won’t kill rat.
Eat won’t gnaw rope, rope won’t hang butcher.
Butcher won’t kill ox, ox won’t drink water,
Water won’t quench fire, fire won|t bum stick.
Stick won’t beat dog, dog won’t bite pig.
Piggy won’t get over the stile,
And I shan’t get home to night.”
But the haymakers said to her,—"lf you will go and
fetch us a bucket of water, we’ll give you the hay.” So
away the old woman went; but she found the bucket
was full of holes. So she covered the bottom with
pebbles, and then filled the bucket with water, and
away she went back with it to the haymakers; and they
gave her a wisp of hay.
As soon as the cow had eaten the hay, she gave the
old woman the milk: and away she went with it in a
saucer to the cat. As soon as the cat had drank the milk:
the cat began to kill the rat, the rat began to gnaw
the rope, the rope began to hang the butcher, the butcher
began to kill the ox, the ox began to drink the water,
the water began to quench the fire, the fire began to
bum the stick, the stick began to beat the dog, the
dog began to bite the pig, the pig in a great fright
jumped over the stile, and so the old woman got home
that night in time to boil some apple dumplings for her
husband’s supper#
The Flylns Pip.
“Dickery, dickery, dare.
The pig flew up in the air
But Patrick Brown soon brought him down,
Dickery, dickery, dare.”
The story of the Three lilttle Pigs.
Once there was an old pig, who had three
little pigs, and sent them out to seek their
fortune. The first one went and built a house
with straw, and soon after a wolf came and
knocked at the door, and said:—“Little pig, let
me come in.” But the little pig said: —“No, no,
by the hair of my chin." The wolf then said: —
“ I’ll huff, and I’ll puff, and I’ll blow your house
in.” So he huffed, and he puffed, and blew the
house in, and eat up the little pig. The next
little pig built a house with sticks, and the old
wolf came along and called out: “Little pig, let
me come in.” And the little pig answered: "No,
no, by the hair of my chin.” “Then,” says the
wolf,“I’ll huff, and I’ll puff, and I’ll blow your
house in.” So he huffed, and he puffed, and
blew the house down, and ate up the little pig
also. The third pig built a house with bricks.
Just after, along came the old wolf, and said:
"Little pig, let me come in.” The little pig said:
“No, no, by the hair of my chin.” “Then I’ll
huff, and I’ll puff, and I’ll blow your house
down." Well, he huffed, and he puffed, and he
huffed, and he puffed, and he puffed, and he
huffed; but he could not get the house down.
When he found that he could not, with all his
huffing and puffing, blow the house down, he
said, “Little pig, I know where there is a nice
field of turnips.” “Where?” said the little pig.
“Oh, in Mr. Smith’s Home-field, and if you will
be ready to-morrow morning I will call for you,
and we will go together, and get some for
dinner.” “Very well,” said the little pig “I will
be ready. What time do you mean to go?”
“Oh, at six o’clock." Well, the little pig got up
at five, and got the turnips before the wolf
came—(which he did about six)—and said,
"Little pig, are you ready?” The little pig said.
“ Ready! I have been and come back again,
and got a nice pot-full for dinner.” The wolf
felt very angry at this, but thought that he
would be up to the little pig somehow or
other, so he said, “Little pig, I know where
there is a nice apple-tree." "Where?” said
the pig. “Down at Merry-Garden,” replied
the wolf, “and if you will not deceive me I
will come for you, at five o’clock to-morrow,
and we will go together and get some apples.”
Well, the pig bustled up the next morning
at four o’clock, and went off for the apples,
hoping to get hack heffire the wolf camej
hut he had further to go, and had to climb
the tree, so that just as he was coming down
from it, he saw the wolf coming, which, as
you may suppose, frightened him very much.
When the wolf came up he said, “Little pig,
what! are you here before me? Are they
nice apples ?" “Yes very,” said the little pig,
“I will throw you down one,” and he threw
it so far, that, while the wolf was gone to
pick it up, the little pig jumped down and
ran home. The next day the wolf camo
again, and said to the little pig, “Little pig,
there is a fair at Shanklin this afternoon,
will you go?” “Oh yes,” said the pig, “I will
go: what time shall you be ready?” “At
three,” said the wolf. So the little pig
went off before the time as usual, and got to
the fair, and bought a butter churn, which
he was going home with, when he saw the
wolf coming. Then he could not tell what
to do. So he got in the chum to hide, and
by so doing turned it round, and it rolled
down the hill with the pig in it, which
frightened the wolf so much, that he ran
home without going to the fair. He went
to the little pig’s heuse, and told him how
frightened he had been by a great round
thing which camo down the hill past him.
Then the little pig said, "Ha! I frightened
you then. I had been to the fair and
bought a butter churn, and when I saw you,
I got into it and rolled down the hill.”
Then the wolf was very angry indeed,
and declared he would eat up the little pig,
and that he would get down the chimney
after him. When the little pig saw what he
was about, he hung on the pot full of water.
and made up a blazing fire, and just as the wolf
was coming down, took off the cover, and in fell
the wolf; so the little pig .put on the coyer
igain in an instant, boiled him up, and eat him
for supper, and lived ever afterwards.

Mouse that lust her Tall.
Once upon a time a Cat and a Mouse were
Slaying together, when, quite by accident, the
at bit off the Mouse’s tail.
It was very strange that the Cat did not bite
off the Mouse’s head: but this Mouse was a good
Mouse, and never stole any cheese, and so the
Cat only bit off her tail. Mousey was very
much vexed to see that her tail was gone, so she
said to Pussy,—
“ Oh, dear Pussy! do give me my tail again.”
"No, that I will not,” said Pussy, “till you
get me some milk for my breakfast.”
“ Oh, the Cow will give me some, ” said the
Mouse.
So she frisked and jumped, and then she ran
Till she came to the Cow, and thus began :
“Please, Cow, give me some milk: I want
to give Pussy milk, and Pussy will give me my
own tail again.”
“ So I will, Mousey, if you get me some hay
for my breakfast,” said the Cow.
“ Oh, the Farmer will give me some, ” said
the Mouse.
So she frisked, and jumped and then she
ran
Till she came to the Farmer, and thus
began:—
"Please, Mr. Farmer, give me some hay,
I want to give the Cow hay. The Cow will
give me some milk, I will give pussy milk,
and Pussy will give me my own tail again.
“ So I will, Mousey, if you get me some
bread for my breakfast,” said the Farmer.
“Oh, the baker will give me some,” said
the Mouse,
So she frisked and jumped, and then she
ran
Till she came to the Baker, and thus
began:—
"Please, Mr. Baker, give me some bread:
I want to give the Farmer bread. The
Farmer will give me some hay, I will give
the Cow hay: the Cow will give me same
milk, I will give Pussy milk, and Pussy will
give me my own tail again.
“ So I will. Mousey, if you get me some
meat for my breakfast," said the Baker.
*• Oh, the Butcher will give me some,”
said the Mouse.
So she frisked and jumped and then she
ran
Till she came to the Butcher, and thus
began:—
Please Mr. Butcher, give me some meat:
I want to give the Baker meat. The Baker
will give me some bread, I will give the
Parmer bread: the farmer will give me some
hay, I will give the Cow hay : the Cow will
give me some milk, I will give Pussy milk,
and Pussy will give me my own tail again.
“ So I will, Mousey, if you’ll eat up the
crumbs that have fallen at my breakfast,” ■
said the Butcher.
“Oh, that I will,” said the Mouse; and
she soon cleared the floor of every crumb.
Then the Butcher gave the Mouse some
meat, and the Mouse gave the Baker the
meat, and the Baker gave the Mouse some
bread, and the Mouse gave the Farmer the
bread, and the Farmer gave the Mouse some
hay, and the Mouse gave the Cow the hay, and
the Cow gave the Mouse some milk, and the
Mouse gave Pussy milk, and then Pussy gave
poor little Mousey her own tail again. [ran.
And she frisked, and jumped, and away she
And cried out to Pussy, “Catch me if you can!"
Mouse Gruel.
There was an Old Person of Ewell,
Who chiefly subsisted on gruel:
But to make it more nice, he inserted some mice.
Which refreshed that Old Person of Ewell.
Wise Mice.
Some little mice sat in a barn to spin :
Pussy came by and she popped her head in:
“ Shall I come in and cut your threads off ?”
“ Oh, no, kind sir, you will bite our heads off.”
Mouse ran up the Cluck.
Hiecory, diccory, dock.
The mouse ran up the clock.
The clock struck one, the mouse ran down,
Hiccory, diccory, dock.
A Frog lie would a.wuulng so.
A Frog he would a-wooing go.
Whether his mother would have it or no.
So off he set with his nice new hat.
And on the road he met with a rat.
“ Pray, Mr. Eat, will you go with me,
Kind Mrs. Mousey for to see ? ”
When they came to the door of Mousey’s hall.
They gave a loud knock, and they gave a loud call.
" Pray, Mrs. Mouse, are you within ? ”
“Oh, yes, kind sirs, I’m sitting to spin. 11
“ Pray, Mrs. Mouse, will you give us some beer ?
For Froggy and I are fond of good cheer.”
“ Pray, Mr. Frog, will you give us a song—
But let it be something that’s not very long.
“ Indeed, Mrs. Mouse," replied the Frog,
“A cold has made me as hoarse as a dog.”
“Since you have caught cold, Mr. Frog,” Mousey said,
“ I’ll sing you a song that I have just made :”
* But while they were all a merry-making,
A cat and her kittens came tumbling in.
The cat she seized the rat by the crown,
The kittens they pull’d the little mouse down.
This put Mr. Frog in a terrible fright,
lie took up his hat, and wished them good night.
But as Froggy was crossing over a brook,
A lily-white duck came and gobbled him up.
So there was an end of one, two, and three,
The Eat, the Mouse, and the little Frog-ee.
Three Blind Mice.

Three little dogs were basking in the cinders:

In a crack, near the cupboard, with dainties
provided.
A certain young mouse with her mother
resided;
So securely they lived, in that snug quiet
spot.
Any mouse in the land might have envied
their lot.
But one day the young mouse, which was
given to roam.
Having made an excursion some way from
her home.
On a sudden returned with such joy in her
eyes,
That her grey sedate parent expressed some
; surprise.
“0 mother," said she, "the good folks of
this house, '
I’m convinced, have not any ill-will to a
mouse;
And those tales can’t be true you always are
telling,
For they’ve been at such pains to construct
I us a dwelling. (
" The floor is of wood, and the walls are of ,
wires.
Exactly the size that one’s comfort requires; )
Aud I'm sure that we there shall have ;
nothing to fear.
If ten cats, with kittens, at once should -
appear.
"And then they have made such nice holes
in the wall.
One could slip in and out, with no trouble
at all; (
But forcing one through such rough crannies '■
as these, (
Always gives one’s poor ribs a most terrible
squeeze. /
“ But the best of all is, they’ve provided, as
well, /
A large piece of cheese, of most exquisite
smell;
'Twas so nice, I had put in my head to go
through.
When I thought it my duty to come and fetch
you.”
“Ah, child,” said the mother, "believe, I
entreat.
Both the cage and the cheese are a terrible
cheat;
Do not think all that trouble they took for our
good,
They would catch us, and kill us all there, if
they could.
“Thus they’ve caught and killed scores, and I
never could learn.
That a mouse who -once entered did ever
return.”
Let younp' people mind what the old people say.
And when danger is near them keep out of the
way.

The Marriage of Cock Robin and Jenny Wren.
It was on a merry time.
When Jenny Wren was young.
So neatly as she danced.
And so sweetly as she sung—
! Robin Red-breast lost his heart:
! He was a gallant bird;
i He doffed his hat to Jenny,
| And thus to her he said:
“My dearest Jenny Wren,
If you will but be mine,
You shall dine on cherry-pie,
j And drink nice currant-wine.
I I’ll dress you like a Goldfinch, |
Or like a Peacock gay;
So if you’ll have me, Jenny,
Let us appoint the day.”
Jenny blushed behind her fan.
And thus declared her mind s
“ Then let it be to-morrow. Bob,
j I take your offer kind.
j Cherry-pie is very good,
( So is currant-wine.
But I’ll wear my russet gown,
I And never dress too fine:”
)
Robin rose up early,
At the break of day;
He flew to Jenny Wren’s house.
To sing a roundelay.
He met the Cock and Hen,
And bade the Cock declare
This was his wedding-day
With Jenny Wren the fair.
The Cock then blew his horn.
To let the neighbours know
This was Robin’s wedding-day.
And they might see the show.
And first came Parson Rook,
With his spectacles and band;
And one of Mother Hubbard’s books
He held within his hand.
Then followed him the Lark,
For he could sweetly sing;
And he was to be the clerk
At Cock Robin’s wedding.
The Goldfinch came on next.
To give away the bride;
The Linnet, being bridesmaid.
Walked by Jenny’s side;
And as she was a-walking,
Said, “ Upon my word,
I think that your Cock Robin
Is a very pretty bird.”
The Sparrow and the Tomtit,
And many more were there;
All came to see the wedding
Of Jenny Wren the fair.
The Bullfinch walked by Robin,
And thus to him did say,
“Pray mark, friend Robin Red-breast,
That Goldfinch dressed so gay;
What though her gay apparel
Becomes her very well ?
Yet Jenny’s modest dress and look
Must bear away the bell.”
Then came the bride and bridegroom;
Quite plainly was she dressed.
And blushed so much, her cheeks were
As red as Robin’s breast.
But Robin cheerd her up;
" My pretty Jen,” said he,
“ We’re going to be married.
And happy we shall be.”
“ Oh, then,” says Parson Rook,
“ Who gives, this maid away ? ”
“ I do,” says the Goldfinch,
“ And her fortune I will pay.”
“ And will you have her Robin,
To be your wedded wife ?”
“ Yes, I will,” says Robin,
“ And love her all my life !”
“ And you will have him, Jenny,
Your husband now to be ?”
“ Yes, I will,” says Jenny,
And love him heartily!”
Then on her finger fair
Cock Robin put the ring; [Rook:
“You’re married now,” says Parson
While aloud the Lark did sing.
The birds were asked to dine—
Not Jenny’s friends alone.
But every pretty songster
That had Cock Robin known.
They had a cherry-pie.
Besides some currant-wine.
And every guest brought something.
That sumptuous they might dine.
Now they all sat or stood.
To eat and to drink;
And every one said what
He happened to think.
Then each took a bumper.
And drank to the pair.
Cock Robin the bridegroom.
And Jenny the fair.
The dinner things removed.
They all began to sing;
And soon they made the place
Near a mile round to ring.
. The concert it was fine.
And every bird tried
Who best should sing for Robin
And Jenny Wren the bride.
When in came the Cuckoo,
And made a great rout;
He caught old of Jenny,
And pulled her about.
Cock Robin was angry.
And so was the Sparrow,
Who fetched in a hurry
His bow and his arrow.
His aim then he took.
But he took it not right.
His skill was not good.
Or he shot in a fright—
For the Cuckoo he missed.
But Cock Robin he killed!
And all the birds mourned
That his blood was so spilled.

The Death and Burial of Cock Robin.
Who killed Cock Robin ?
I, said the Sparrow,
With my bow and arrow,
I killed Cock Robin.
Who saw him die?
I, said the Fly ;
With my little eye
I saw him die.
Who caught his blood ?
I, said the Fish;
With my little dish
I caught his blood.
Who’ll make his shroud ?
I, said the Beetle;
With my thread and needle
I’ll make his shroud.
Who’ll dig his grave ?
I, said the Owl;
With my spade and shovel
I’ll dig his grave.
Who’ll carry him to the grave ?
I, said the Kite;
If it’s not in the night.
I’ll carry him to the grave.
Who’ll carry the link ?
I, said the Linnet;
I’ll fetch it in a minute;
I’ll carry the link.
Who’ll be the Parson?
I, said the Rook;
With my little book.
I’ll be the Parson.
Who’ll be the Clerk?
I, said the Lark;
If it’s not in the dark.
I’ll be the Clerk.
Who’ll be chief mourner?
I, said the Dove;
For I mourn for my love;
I’ll be chief mourner.
Who’ll bear the pall ?
We, said the Wren;
Both the Cock and the Hen;
And we’ll bear the pall.
Who’ll sing a psalm ?
I, said the Thrush,
As she sat in a bush;
I’ll sing a psalm.
Who’ll toll the bell?
I, said the Bull,
Because I can pull;
I’ll toll the bell.
All the birds of the air
Fell a-sighing and sobbing.
When they heard the bell toll
For poor Cock Robin.
The Life and Death of Jenny Wren,
Jenny Wren fell sick
Upon a merry time.
In came Robin red-breast
And brought her sops and wine.
“Eat well of the sop, Jenny,
Drink well of the wine.”
“Thank you, Robin, kindly.
You shall be mine.”
Then Jenny she got well.
And stood upon her feet.
And told Robin plainly
She loved him not a bit.
Robin, being angry.
Flopp’d upon a twig.
Saying: “Out upon you.
Fie upon you, you bold-faced jig.’*
Jenny Wren fell sick again.
And Jenny Wren did die;
The doctors vow’d they’d cure her.
Or know the reason why.
Doctor Hawk felt her pulse.
And shaking his head.
Says, “ I fear I can’t save her.
Because she’s quite dead.”
She’ll do very well,”
Says sly Doctor Fox,
” If she takes but one pill
From out of this box.
With hartshorn in hand
Came Doctor Tomtit,
Saying, “ Really, good sirs,
It’s only a fit.”
Doctor Cat says, “ Indeed,
I dont think she’s dead;
I believe if I try.
She might yet be bled.”
“I think. Puss, you’re foolish,”
Then says Doctor Goose;
"For to bleed a dead Wren
Can be of no use.”
Doctor Owl then declared
That the cause of her death.
He really believed.
Was the want of more breath.
“ Indeed, Doctor Owl,
You are much in the right:
You might as well have said
That day is not night.”
Says Robin, “ Get out!
You’re a parcel of quacks;
Or I’ll lay this good stick
On each of your backs.”
Then Robin began
To bang them about;
They staid for no fees.
But were glad to get out.
Cock Robin long
For Jenny grieves.
At last he covers
Her with leaves;
And near her grave.
From day to day.
He warbles forth
His roundelay.


Puss and the Robin.
Little Eobin Eed-breast sat upon a tree,
Up went Pussy-cat, and down went he_;
Down came Pussy-cat, and away Eobin
ran;
Says little Eobin Eed-breast," Catch me
if you can.”
Little Eobin Eed-breast jump’d upon a
wall.
Pussy-cat jump’d after him, and almost
got a fall;
Little Eobin chirp’d and sang, and what
did Pussy say ?
Pussy-cat said " Mew,” and Eobin jump d
away.
Cock Robin at Home.
Little cock-robin peep’d out of his cabin.
To see the cold winter come in.
Tit for tat, what matter for that.
He’ll hide his head under his wing!
Robin on a rail.
Little Eobin Eed-breast
Sat upon a rail:
Niddle naddle went his head.
Wiggle waggle went his tail.
Robin on a twig.
Little Bob Eobin, where do you live ?
Up in yonder wood, sir, on a hazel twig.
Robin on a hurdle.
Little Eobin Eed-breast,
Sat upon a hurdle;
With a pair of speckled legs.
And a green girdle.
Owl and the boy.
There was a little boy went into a barn.
And lay down on some hay;
An owl came out and flew about, |
And the little boy ran away.
Mary’s Canary.
Mary had a pretty bird
With feathers bright and yellow;
Slender legs, upon my word.
He was a pretty fellow.
The sweetest notes he always sung.
Which much delighted Mary,
And near the cage she’d ever sit.
To hear her own Canary.
Three Tom-tits.
Three little Tom-tits all lost their wits
When first they saw a pig in fits.
Cock Sparrow.
A little cock-sparrow sat on a green tree.
And he cherruped,he cherruped, so merry
was he;
A little cock-sparrow sat on a green tree.
And he cherruped, he cherruped, so merry
was he.
A naughty boy came with his wee bow
and arrow.
Determined to shoot this little cock-
sparrow.
This little cock-sparrow shall make me a
stew.
And his giblets shall make me a little
pie too.
Oh, no! said the sparrow, I won’t make a
stew.
So he flapped his wings and away he flew!
Old Men and Birds.
There was a fat man of Bombay,
Who was smoking one sunshiny day.
When a bird, called a snipe.
Flew away with his pipe.
Which vex’d the fat man of Bombay.
There was an Old Man of Dundee,
Who frequented the top of a tree;
When disturbedby the crows, he abrupt-
ly arose.
And exclaimed, "I’ll return to Dundee.”
There was an Old Man of Whitehaven;
Who danced a quadrille with a Eaven ,
But they said, " It’s absurd to encourage
this bird! ”
So they smashed that Old Man of White-
haven.
Australian Donkey.
A laughing Jackass, ha-hooing with great
glee.
Caught up a snake and flew into a tree ;
And then remarked as you above may see ;
If all the snakes in the world was one snake
What a horrid snake that snake would be !
Old Man and Birds.
There was an Old Man who said, "Hush!
I perceive a young bird in this bush ! ”
When they said, “Is it small?” he replied
" Not at all !
It is four times as big as the bush !”
There was an Old Man, on whose nose.
Most b.rds of the air could repose;
But they all flew away, at the closing of day.
Which r elievedthat old man and his nose.
A Bat.
Bat, bat, come under my bat.
And I’ll give you a slice of bacon.
And when I bake. I’ll give you a cake
If I am not mistaken.
A Hawk.
Eiddle me, riddle me, ree,
A hawk sat up on a tree;
And he says to himself, says he.
Oh dear! what a fine bird I be!
Two Pigeons.
I had two pigeons bright and gay.
They flew from me the other day;
What was the reason they did go?
I cannot tell, for I do not know.
A Pigeon and a Crow.
All of a row, bend the bow.
Shot at a pigeon, and killed a crow.
Cuckoo, Cherry-tree.
Cuckoo, cherry-tree.
Catch a bird, and give it to me;
Let the tree be high or low.
Let it hail, rain, or snow.
Little Poll Parrot.
Little Poll Parrot sat in his garret.
Eating toast and tea;
A little brown mouse,
Jumped in the house.
And stole it all away.
. Lady Bird.
| Lady bird, lady bird, fly away home;
[ Thy house is on fire, thy children all
f gone.
All but one, and her name is Ann,
And she crept under the pudding-pan.
, CUCKOO.
The cuckoo’s a fine bird.
He sings as he flies;
He brings us good tidings.
He tells us no lies.
He sucks little birds’ eggs.
To make his voice clear;
And when he sings " cuckoo!”
The summer is near.
Two Blackbirds.
There were two blackbirds.
Sitting on a hill.
The one named Jack,
The other named Jill;
Fly away Jack ! fly away Jill;
Come again. Jack! come again, Jill!
Little Bird.
Once I saw a little bird
Come hop, hop, hop;
So I cried, little bird.
Will you stop, stop, stop?
And was going to the window
To say How do you do ?
But he shook his little tail.
And far away he flew.
Old Crow.
There was an old crow sat upon a clod:
There’s an end of my song, that’s odd!
Birds on a Stone.
There were two birds sat on a stone.
One flew away and then there was one;
The other flew after, and then there
were none;
And so the poor stone was left all alone.


The Story of a Little Mouse;
OR, OUR HAPPY FAMILY.
Once there was a little mouse,
Who came to live in our house;
She came because she was terribly frighten’d
To stay outside as it thunder’d and lighten’d.
When she came in ’twas nearly dark,
And Ponto he began to bark ;
But she ran round at a rapid rate,
Then darted in behind the grate.
Ponto smelt, and sniff’d, and bark’d, and scratch’d,
But Mousey was safe and could’nt be catch’d
So Ponto when tired laid down to sleep,
And Mousey quite quiet determined to keep.
Mousey staid there a month, as she thought it was better,
And Ponto could smell her, but never could get her;
But every morning when Ponto went out,
Miss Mousey crept forth, and for crumbs looked about,
Now one day as Ponto came into the house
Thinks he, I’ll be kind to that poor little mouse :
“ So come out Miss Mousey,” our Ponto he said,
“ And if any one hurts you I’ll bite off his head. ”
So the poor little mouse came out of the grate,
And ate with our Ponto out of his plate,
And always when Ponto laid down on the mat,
Beside him Miss Mousey in her little chair sat.
But one rainy night as Miss Mousey sat still,
A thing called a bat, came over the hill;
But Ponto says to him, “You are not wanted here,”
And he sent that bat off with a flea in his ear.
The very same night as they lay on the mat,
What should come rushing in but a great big rat;
Up jumped Mr. Ponto and gave a loud bark,
And that rat scampered off out into the dark.
They had just got rid of the hat and the rat,
And what should come in but a Great Tom Cat ;
Came jumping, springing, and bounding along,
And frighten’d Miss Mousey more than a gong.
He raced after mousey, around, in and out,
Through the house, and the yard, and all round about;
To the East, to the West, to the North, to the South,
And at last caught her up in his great big mouth.
He squeezed her back hard and frighten’d her so,
She scarcely could say, “ Oh, please let me go !”
But Tom spoke and said, “ Mouse is very good meat,
And as I feel hungry, why, it’s you I shall eat.”
Tom let her go once, but he caught her afresh,
Although Mousey made a most desperate dash ;
And again Mousey pleaded, “ Oh, please let me go
But Tom only answered, “ Decidedly No !”
But as luck should now have it, our Ponto came in,
And asked Mr. Puss, “ What’s this horrible din.”
Says Puss to our Ponto, “ I’ve caught this sly thief,
And now I intend to bring her to grief.”
Says Ponto to Puss, “ The mouse is my friend,
And if you would hurt her, why I must defend
That nice little, kind little, good little mouse,
As long as she ever remains in this house.”
Says Pussy to Ponto, “ I pray you don’t fret;
I’ll love and I’ll cherish your poor little pet;
She shall sleep on the mat, and we’ll find her in food,
Because she is nice, and because she is good.”
So the nice little mouse, the dog and the cat,
All three ate together, and slept on the mat;
They sung, danc’d, and romp’d with joy and merry laughter
And as the old tale says, “ Lived happy ever after.”


Our
Darlings
in
Heaven.
Maggie left alone a moment,
pours porridge into her father a
watch.
My Bud In Heaven.
One bud the gardener gave me,
A fair and only child.
He gave it to my keeping.
To cherish undefiled;
It lay upon my bosom.
It was my hope, my pride;
Perhaps it was an idol
Which I must be denied.
For just as it was opening
In glory to the day.
Came down the heavenly Gardener
And took the bud away.
Yet not in wrath He took it,
A smile was on His face;
And tenderly and kindly
He bore it from its place.
Fear not.methought He whispered
Thy bud shall be restored.
I take it but to plant it
In the garden of my Lord.
Then bid me not to sorrow.
As those who hopeless weep.
For He who gave hath taken.
And He who took can keep.
And night and morn together.
By the open gate of prayer.
I’ll go unto my darling,
And sit beside him there.
I know Twill open for me.
Poor sinner tho’ I be.
For His dear sake who keeps it.
And keeps my bud for me.
The Little Darling's Shoe.
There is a sacred, secret place.
Baptized by tears and sighs.
Where little half-worn shoes are kept
From cold unfeeling eyes.
They have no meaning, save to her
Whose darling’s feet have strayed
Far from the sacred folds of love.
Where late in joy they played.
The impress of a little foot.
How can it be so dear !
How can a little half-worn shoe
Call forth a sigh or tear!
’Tis more than dear, ’tis eloquent
Of grace and beauty fled;
It wakes the sound of little feet—*
Sweet sound for ever fled!
It whispers to the mother’s ear
A tale of fondest love ;
It tells her that the little feet
Now tread the fields above.
Oft has she bathed it with her tears.
Oft kiss’d it o’er and o’er;
If it were filled with costliest gems.
She could not love it more.
The Golden Stair.
Put away the little dresses,
That the darling used to wear.
She will need them on earth never.
She has climb’d the golden stair:
She is with the happy angels.
And I long for her sweet kiss.
Where her little feet are waiting.
In the realm of perfect bliss.
Lay aside her little playthings.
Wet with mother’s pearly tears.
How we shall miss our little darling
All the coming weary years !
Fold the dainty little dresses.
That she never more will wear.
For her little feet are waiting.
Up above the golden stair.
Kiss the little curly tresses.
Cut from her bright golden hair.
Do the angels kiss our darling.
In that realm so bright and fair ?
Oh ! we pray to meet our darling
For a long, long sweet embrace.
Where the little feet are waiting.
And we meet her face to face.
Angels whisper that our darling
Is in lands of love so fair.
That her little feet are lightly
Climbing up the golden stair.


THE CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL.
The following is extracted from the
Laureate’s new volume. A hospital nurse
is made to speak as follows: —
' Nay, you remember our Emmie; you used to
send her the flowers;
How she would smile at ’em, play with ’em,
talk to ’em hours after hours ?
They that can wander at will where the
works of the Lord are reveal’d.
Little guess what joy can be got from a
cowslip out of the field ;
Flowers to these “ spirits in prison” are all
they can know of the spring.
They freshen and sweeten the wards like
the waft of an angel’s wing ;
And she lay with a flower in one hand and
her thin hands crossed on her breast—
Wan, but as pretty as heart can desire,
and we thought her at rest.
Quietly sleeping—so quiet, our doctor said
“ Poor little dear.
Nurse, I must‘do it to-morrow; she’ll never
live through it, I fear.”
I walked with our kind Doctor as far as
the head of the stair.
Then I return’d to the ward; the child
didn’t see I was there.
Never since I was nurse had I been so
grieved and so vext !
Emmie had heard him. Softly she called
from her cot to the next,
“He says I shall never live through it, O
Annie, what shall I do ?”
Annie consider’d. “If I,” said the wise
little Annie, “ was you
I should cry to the dear Lord Jesus to
help me, for Emmie, you see.
It’s all in the picture there: ‘Little children
should come unto me. ’ ”
(Meaning the print that you gave us; I find
It always can please.
Our children, the dear Lord Jesus with child-
ren about His knees.)
“Yes, and I will, “ said Emmie; “but then
if I call to the Lord,
How should He know that it’s me ? Such a
lot of beds in the ward !”
That was a puzzle for Annie. Again she
consider’d and said:
“Emmie, you put out your arms, and you
leave ’em outside on the bed —
The Lord has so much to see to ! But,
Emmie, you tell it Him plain.
It’s the little girl with her arms lying out
on the counterpane.”
I sat three nights by the child—l could not
watch her for four—
My brain had begun to reel—l felt I could
do it no more.
That was my sleeping night, but I thought
that it never would pass.
There was a thunderclap once, and a clatter
of hail on the glass.
And there was a phantom cry that I heard
as I tossed about —
The motherless bleat of a lamb in the-
storm and the darkness without;
My sleep was broken besides with dreams
of the dreadful knife,
And fears of our delicate Emmie, who
scarce would escape with her life.
Then, in the grey of the morning, it seem’d
she stood by me and smiled,
And the doctor came at his hour, and we
went to see the child.
He had brought his ghastly tools; we believed
her asleep again—
Her dear, long lean little arms lying out on
the counterpane ;
Say that His day is done ? Ah, why should
we care what they say ?
The Lord of the children had heard her, and
Emmie had passed away.
OUR LITTLE BOY THAT DIED.
I am all alone in my chamber now.
And the midnight hour is near.
And the fagot’s crack and the clock’s dull tick
Are the only sounds I hear;
And over my soul, in its solitude.
Sweet feelings of sadness glide;
For my heart and my eyes are full, when I think
Of our little boy that died.
I went one night to my father’s house, —
Went home to the dear ones all, —
And softly I opened the garden gate.
And softly the door of the hall;
My mother came out to meet her son;
She kissed me, and then she sighed ;
And her head fell on my neck, and she wept
For our little boy that died.
And when I gazed on his innocent face.
As still and cold he lay.
And thought what a lovely child he had been.
And how soon he must decay,—
“ O Death, thou lovest the beautiful!”
In the woe of my spirit” I cried;
For sparkled the eyes, and the forehead was fair.
Of our little boy that died.
Again I will go to my father’s house, —
Go home to the dear ones all, —
And sadly I’ll open the garden gate.
And sadly the door of the hall;
I shall meet my mother, but never-more
With her darling by her side ;
But she’ll kiss me, and sigh and weep again
For our little boy that died.
I shall miss him when the flowers come
In the garden where he played;
I shall miss him more by the fireside.
When the flowers have all decayed;
I shall see his toys and his empty chair.
And the horse he used to ride;
And they will speak, with a silent speech, •
Of our little boy that died.
I shall see his little sister again
With her playmates about the door;
And I’ll watch the children in their sports
As I never did before;
And if in the group I see a child
Like him, so laughing-eyed,
I’ll love the face that speaks to me
Of our little boy that died.
We shall all go home to our father’s house, —
To our Father’s house in the skies.
Where the hope of our souls shall have no blight.
And our love no broken ties:
We shall roam on the banks of the River of Peace,
And bathe in its blissful tide;
And one of the joys of our heaven shall be —
Of our little boy that died.
LITTLE JIM.
The cottage was a thatched onq,
The outside old and mean;
Yet everything within that cot
Was wondrous neat and clean.
The night was dark and stormy.
The wind was howling wild;
A patient mother knelt beside
The death-bed of her child :
A little worn-out creature.
His once bright eyes grown dim ;
He was a collier’s only child, —
They called him little Jim.
And oh, to see the briny tears
Fast hurrying down her cheek,
As she offered up a prayer in thought
She was afraid to speak.
Lest she might waken one she loved
Far better than her life;
For there was all a mother’s love
In that poor collier’s wife.
With hands uplifted, see ! she kneels
Beside the sufferer’s bed.
And prays that He will spare her boy
And take herself instead.
She gets her answer from the child;
Soft fell these words from him:
“Mother, the angels do so smile.
And beckon little Jim!
“I have no pain, dear mother, now;
But oh, I am so dry !
Just moisten poor Jim’s lips again.
And mother, don’t you cry!”
With gentle, trembling haste she held
The tea-cup to his lips;
He smiled, to thank her, as he took
Three tiny little sips.
“Tell father, when he comes from work
I said Good-night to him;
And mother, now I’ll go to sleep!”
Alas, poor little Jim !
She saw that he was dying:
The child she loved so dear
Had uttered the last words that she
Might ever hope to hear.
The cottage door was opened.
The collier’s step was heard
The mother and the father met.
Yet neither spoke a word.
He knew that all was over, —
He knew his child was dead
He took the candle in his hand.
And walked towards the bed.
His quivering lips gave token
Of grief he’d fain conceal;
And see ! his wife has joined him.
The stricken couple kneel.
With hearts bowed down with sadness
They humbly ask of Him,
In heaven once more to meet again
Their own poor little Jim !


The Deaf and Dumb Alphabet; or, Silent Language.
The Alphabet of HAND-SIGKNS is a great blessing to deaf and dumb persons, enabling them to converse almost as effectively
as others can by the organs of speech. It is also extensively used throughout the world as a useful accomplishment by those
who are not deaf and dumb, and besides it has this recommendation: —It is the most easily learnt language in the world.
SINGLE-HAND ALPHABET.


Language of Flowers.
THE LANGUAGE OF PLOWEES is pre-eminently the language of refined and modest Courtship ; millions have
conveyed a message by presenting a flower which they dare not have uttered in their mother tongue.
In some Countries this “LANGUAGE OF LOYE” is extremely common in the words of the Poet;
“In Eastern lands, amid fragrant bowers.
They tell the tale of Affection in Flowers.”

THE OLDEST OUT-DOOR GAME IN THE WORLD
IS THE GAME LEAP-FROG.
COLE’S
OWE OF FAVORITES.
(a game fob the educated).
Cole’s game of FAVORITES is founded
upon the principal of “ Confessions.” It
is a good game to sharpen the intellect by
encouraging the players to think ! to dis-
criminate ! and have opinions of their own,
and is played as follows: —
DIRECTIONS.
The company seat themslves around, a
judge is appointed, the judge then asks the
first person on the left one of the hundred
questions, and commences to count 20, if
the question is answerd correctly before the
20 are counted the person questioned is
WISE, and the judge passes on to the
next. The first one who does not answer
to time is there and then solemnly sen-
tenced by the judge as a MUFF, and the
judge passes on to the next one. The fun
of the game is to see how many MUFFS
the judge can catch in the company, and if
he does not catch one in 3 times going
round, or asks a wrong question, he him-
self, is pronounced THE GREATEST
MUFF, and a new judge is appointed.
This game can be played by 2 friends
or 2 lovers and yet be very interesting and
instructive; for instance, Edwin can ask
Angelina 10 questions to see if he can catch
her, and then Angelina can ask Edwin 10
questions to see if she can catch him, and so
on, or they can ask question and question
about, and see which is caught first.

SONG OF THE BOOK ARCADE.
SONG OF THE BOOK ARCADE.
Cole’s Book Arcade, Cole’s Book Arcade
It is in Melbourne town.
Of all the book stores in this land
It has the most renown.
It was the first, first Book Arcade
That in the world was found;
It’s still the finest Book Arcade
In all the world around.
A lovely rainbow sign appears
Above the Book Arcade,
And ’tis the very grandest sign
Was ever yet displayed.
Full forty thousand sorts of books
Are stored within its walls,
Which can be seen, looked at or bought.
By anyone that calls.
The book you wish, the book you want.
Is almost sure to be
Found somewhere in the Book Arcade,
If you will call and see.
VALUE OF BOOKS.
BOOKS should be found in every house
To form and feed the mind;
They are the best of luxuries
'Tis possible to find;
For all the books in all the world
Are man’s greatest treasure;
They make him wise, and bring to him
His best, his choicest pleasure.
BOOKS make his time pass happily
Through many weary hours ;
Amuse, compose, instruct his mind.
Enlarge his mental powers.
BOOKS give to him the history
Of each and every land;
BOOKS show him human actions past—
The bad, the good, the grand.
BOOKS show him arts, laws, learnings.
Of every time and place; [faiths
BOOKS show him how each thing is made
Used by the human race.


BOOKS give to him descriptions of
The world in which we live,
Of the universe around us.
And better still they give.
BOOKS give to him the greatest thoughts
Of all the good and wise;
BOOKS treasure human knowledge up.
And so it never dies.
BOOKS show him all that men have done.
What they have thought and said;
BOOKS show the deeds and wisdom of
The living and the dead.
BOOKS shew him all the hopes and fears
Of every race and clan;
BOOKS clearly prove beyond a doubt
The brotherhood of man
BOOKS give him hopes beyond the grave
Of an immortal life ;
BOOKS teach that right and truth and love
Shall banish every strife.
BOOKS teach and please him when a child
In youth and in his prime;
BOOKS give him soothing pleasure when
His health and strength decline.
BOOKS please him in his lonely hours,
Wherever he may roam;
BOOKS please when read aloud among
His loving friends at home.
BOOKS like strong drink will drown his cares.
But do not waste his wealth;
BOOKS leave him better , drink the worse,
In character and health.
BOOKS therefore, are, of all man buys.
The choicest thing on earth;
BOOKS have, of all his household goods.
The most intrinsic worth.
BOOKS are the greatest blessing out.
The grandest thing we sell,
BOOKS bring more joy, BOOKS do more good
Than mortal tongue can tell.
E. W. COLE.


A Wonderful Search Journey Dy the 40 principal modes of travelling in the World,
I have always been a man
of one idea at a time, and
that one idea I have followed
with unwavering determin-
ation until success has re-
warded my efforts. Now
listen to mystery :—A short
time ago, much desiring to
obtain a particular article, I
determined to get it if it was
possible to do so in this
world, and so started on my
search journey. I ran into
Melbourne and asked His
Excellency the Governor of
Victoria if he knew where I
could get it, he said he did
not but I might ask
the Rajah of Sarawak. J
took ship to Sarawak, asked
the Rajah, he said he did
not know, but referred me
to the Mikado of Japan. I
jumped into a boat, pulled
to Jedo, asked His Dual
Majesty, Lord Paramount
of Japan, and head of the
Sintoo Faith, he said he did
not know, but perhaps the
Tycoon of Japan did. I got
into a jimriksha and was
trotted away to the house of
the unfortunate Tycoon, he
said he could not help me,
but referred me to the Great
Cham of Tartary, I jumped
into a Chinese junk, bore
away to Pekin and saw the
Great Cham of the
Celeslials " Son of Heaven,”
" Brother to the Sun, Moon
and Stars j” “ Father of
Mankind,” “ Governor of
the World ” and head of
the Confucian Faith, he
condescendingly said he did
not know, but maybe the
Xiang of Nankin could in-
form me ; I took a sailing
wheelbarrow to the Centre
of Wise Learning, saw the
head of the Taoist Faith,
he could not tell me where
to get it but perhaps the
Grand Lama of Thibet
could, I jumped on the back
of a Yak, rode to Lassa, in-
terviewed the head of the
Buddhist Faith he said he
wanted one himself, but did
not know where to get it, go,
says he, to the Czar of
Russia, present ray compli-
ments and ask him for one
for yourself and one for me,
I took passage in a reindeer
sleigh to St. Petersburg, saw
the Czar, he referred me bo
his brother monarch the
Keizab of Austria, I jumped
on a horse, galloped away to
Vienna, saw the Keizaß, he
did not know, but I could
try the Queen of England,
I jumped into an electric
train, made for the metro-
polis of the world, saw Her
Royal, Imperial, and Repub-
lican Majesty the "Queen of
England,” “ Empress of
India,” Sovereign of Canada
Australia, and forty other
countries, the powerful and
beloved ruler of the finest
race of men, and the largest,
mightiest, and grandest
Empire the world ever saw.
I now said to myself I surely
shall get the article I want
from the vast rescources of
Her Majestry, but in answer
to my query she politely re-
marked that she did not
think I should get it in
her dominions but was almost
certain that I could get it
from the Chief of the Green-
land Exquimaux, I rose up
in a balloon, flew through the
air across the Atlantic, saw
the Chief, he could not say
but referred me to the
Viceroy of the Dominion, I
jumped on the back of a
reindeer, trotted away to
Ottowa, saw the Viceroy, he
was positively ignorant on
the subject and referred me
to the Mormon Prophet, got
into an ice ship, slid away
over the snow to Utah, saw
the Prophet, he had heard of
it but did not know where I
should get it, but I might
at least ask the Sachem of
the Flat-Head Indians, I
jumped into a dog-sleigh.
scampered away, hailed the
Sachem, he did not know,
but perhaps the President
of Peru did, rode on a one-
man sedan to the City of
Earthquakes, saw the Presi-
dent, he did not know, but
would I be so good as ask the
Em Verge, of Brazil, I sprang
on to the back of an llama,
flopped away to Rio; the
American Emperor, said he
did not know himself but
surely the Sheikh of Timbuc-
too ought to tell. I jumped
into a canoe crossed the At-
lantic, reached the negro city
asked the Sheikh, he said it
was like my impudence
asking him, how should he
know such a thing? none
of the traditions of the negro
continent mentioned it, but
if I thought that such a thing
existed I had better ask His
Sublime Mightiness the Sul-
tan of Zanzibar, I jumped on
the back of an ostrich strode
away to the Isle of Beauty,
saw the Sultan, he shook his
head and referred me to the
Negus of Abyssinia, I was
carried rapidly in a head-
palenkeen on the heads of
four negroes to Magdala,
spoke to the Negus, he re-
ferred me to the Khedive of
Egypt, I got into a water-
velocipede, trod away up the
Red Sea to the city of the
Pyram,ds, saw the Khedive,
he referred me to the Sherif
of Mecca, I at once bestrode
a donkey, cantered away to
the Sacred City, asked the
custodian of the Precious
Tomb of the Great Prophet,
the query nonplussed him,
and he desired me to wait on
the Imaun of Muscat, I
mounted a camel, ambled
across to the hot city of the
Imaun, hecould not say but
referred me to the Rao of
Cutch, I made for Bhooj on
a raft, spoke to the Rao, he
had not got one, but referred
'me to the Guicoweb of
Gujerat and considerately
lent me a pair of ten-feet
stilts for the journey. I
waded from the City of Dis-
mal Swamps and finally
reached Baroda on my stilts,
saw the Guicower, he had
never heard of the article
but referred me to the High
Priest of the Parsees, I got
into a sedan, was borne to
Bombay, saw the head of
the Parsee Faith, he had
not the article, did not be-
leive that it existed, as it
was not mentioned in any of
the sacred books of the Par-
sees, but finally referred me
to the Biby of Canoaore,
I mounted an Elephant,
stamped down the coagt*


addressed the Biby, she said
it was the first time she had
heard of the article, but the
Maharajah of Mysore might
have one. I stepped into a
palenkeen and foux men
trotted away with me to
Mysore, tne crreai xtajan
said he had .not got one but
perhaps the Nizam of
Hyderabad could assist me,
J got into a horse-sedan.
went to Hyderabad, saw
the Nizam, he did not
know and suggested the
Grand Mahunt of Benares.
I got into a horse-palen-
xeen, made straight for
the City of Sacred Shrines,
saw the head of the Hindoo
Faith, he did not know
where it could be got, but
had I asked the Thackoor of
Bhrownnuggar ? No ! — or
the Swat of Ackoond, or the
Muder of Cassala,. or the
Hospoder of Wallachia, or
the Aboona of Gondar or the
Patriarch of Constantinople,
pr the Archbishop of Canter-
bury ? I said most decidedly
not— that I would not waste
my time in consulting such
insignificant magnates, then,
says he, just you ask the
Guro of the Sikhs. I jumped
astride of a Bramah Bull,
and trotted away to Amrit-
zerj saw the head of the
Sikh Faith, he had not got
the article, had not heard of
it, but advised me to apply to
the Ameer of Afghanistan.
I got into an ox dooly and
at length reached Cabul,
saw the Ameer, he had not
got it, had not seen it, not
heard of it, did not believe
the article existed, but the
Khan of Bohara could speak
more possitively about it.
I got into a Tacon or
Hamockeen and was car-
ried by two men to Bokhara,
interviewed the Khan, he
said it was absurd for the
Ameer to send to him, he
knew nothing of it, but the
Shah of Persia probably did;
I got into a mule sleigh.
glided away to Teheran,
enquired of the Shah, could
get no satisfaction, he nevei
heard of it, was I sure there
was such an article in
existence ? I told him that
I wanted to find out, but I
thought there must be some-
where. Oh then, said he, try
the Chief Eabbi of Jeru-
salem. I got into a coach.
tore away to the Holy City,
of the Jews; asked the head
of the Jewish Faith, he had
not one, I had better ask
the Pasha of Damascus. I
jumped astride of a bicycle,
trundled away to the oldest
city in the world: asked the
Pasha, he could not say I
had better ask the Emir of
the Druses. I creeped up
the Lebanon in a bullock-
waggon ; saw and asked the
bead of the Druse Faith, he
referred me to the Bet of
Tunis. I got on to a
tricycle, rode to Tunis; saw
the Bey, he could not tell,
perhaps the Pope of Borne
could. I jumped into a ship.
made for the Eternal City,
asked the head of the Chris-
tian Church, His Holiness
could not tell, perhaps the
Grand Seignour of Turkey
might. I stepped into a
railway steam carriage.
swept around to the Golden
Horn; saw His Sublime
Mightiness the Padishaw,
he said that he had not got
one and never heard of it;
but when I described to him,
in clear, concise and glowing
terms, the real value of the
article to the whole human
race, he said that every
person black or white, or
brown, or yellow, or red, or
any other colour whatever,
in the world, should have
one, and that it was the
duty of all Kings and
Queens, and Emperors, and
Sultans, and Czars, and
Keizars, and Khedives, and
Khans, and Shahs, and
Ameers, and Deys, and Beys,
and Great Chams, and
Grand Lamas, to see that
every one of their subjects
obtained one without delay,
I said that those were
exactly my sentiments ; but
where was it to be got. He
again graciously assured me
that he did not know, but I
might ask the Grand Mufti
of Turkey, the fountain of
all human knowledge, and
custodian of the sacred
Koran. I tore along in a
goat - carriage, interviewed
the head of the Mahometan
Faith; but in answer to my
query this Mighty Spiritual
Magnate seemed taken
aback; he affirmed that the
Koran did not mention the
article, and, therefore, he
believed it could not exist,
but had I made a thorough
search for it; had I tried the
Dey of Algiers. I answered
no ! Had I tried the Doge
of Venice —the Elector of
Saxony—the .Begum of Oude
—the Stadtholder of Holland
—the Peishwa of Poona—
the Nabob of Bengal—the
Caliph of Bagdad—the Inca
of Peru, or the great Mogul.
I looked at the Grand Mufti
in speechless astonishment;
he might as well have asked
me if I had enquired of
Pharoah or Nebuchadnezzer.
I shook my head and rushed
from his presence, con>-
pletely nonplussed, be-
wildered, frantic. Where
on earth was I to get the
article? I had asked, and
asked, and asked again, and
was tired of asking, I had
travelled fifty thousand miles
by forty different modes of
conveyance; consulted in
their own capitals with thirty
secular monarchs, governing
three-fourths of the world;
and I had with earnest,
respectful enquiry ap-
proached the sacredotal
thrones of the spiritual
monarchs of the eleven
principal regligions of man-
kind and yet I could get no
tidings of it. What was I
to do P I was now standing
in front of the great Mosque
at Constantionple almost
frantic with perplexity;
some one approached and
handed me a printed an-
nouncement. I read it! it
sent an inexpressible thrill
through me. I immediately
took steamer for Melbourne,
landed there, jumped into
a cab.
went straight to Cole’s Book
Arcade, and saw a drawing
of the very article I had ran-
sacked the world over to
obtain, and what do you
think it was ? It was a
Flying Machine ! I wanted
a flying machine, Mr. Cole
informed me that he had
not got his machine to fly yet
and, that in all the world a
machine was notyetinvented
that would fly, but that,
through the active and pro-
gressive ingenuity of the
human intellect, such a
machine was certain to be
invented in the future, and
as an earnest of his strong
conviction he handece me a
document which rah aa
follows
Oct. 31st, 1882.
I the undersigned, firmly
believing that as man haa
already made machines to
run over the land and float
over the water faster than
the swiftest animal, so
shortly he will make
machines to fly through the
air as fast, and finally faster,
than the swiftest birds do
now. And I hereby offer a
bonus of .£lOOO to any
person who shall (in con-
sequence of said bonus)
within the next two years;
invent a flying machine, to
go by Electrical, Chemical
Mechanical, or any other
means, except by gas, a
distance of 100 miles, and
shall come and stop in front
of the Book Arcade, Bourko
Street, Melbourne, Australia
as easily and as safely as a
carriage stops there now.—

Abraham Adolphus. The letters GHIJKL belong to the second portrait in each row, and m the case of the second por-
trait, of the letter A include such names as Agnes, Alice, Ahaz, Alfred The letters M NOP Q E belong to the third P ortrait
each row, and in the case of the letter A include such names as Amy, Anna, Arabella, Amos, Andrew, Arthur. Ihe letters b l
UV WXYZ belong to the fourth portrait of each row, and in the case of the letter A include such names as Athahah, Augusta,
Asa Augustus. The same rule is followed with each letter of the Alphabet; for instance, the first portrait in the row B belongs to
such names as Barbara, Bessie, Bartholomew, Beniamin, and so on througout the whole collection of portraits
If a woman is looking for her future husband she must first find the number of her own portrait and then find the corres-
ponding number amongst the men’s and THAT IS TO BE HEB HUSBAND; for instance, if her own portrait is No. 27, No. 27

The same rule is to be followed by the men. If a mans portrait is No, 93, No. 93 amongst the ladies IS TO BE HIS
and if they are parried it will be their second husband or wife, and if they have been married twice it will be their third one^


and so on up to 144 times of being married and after that no one will be allowed to consult this oracle, look at it, speak of it,
or even think about it, such objectionable persons are entirely excluded from its benifits.
Persons who consult this oracle must accept the husband or wife that falls to their lot just the same as if they were married
them in the usual way, but if they are dissatisfied with them on account of ugliness, dress or any other cause the consulter, by
doing penance in the shape of a pilgrimage to a certain place in the exact centre of the world and paying a small sum, can obtain
a DIVORCE.
The place to which the pilgrimage is to be made is Cole’s Book Arcade, Bourke Street, Melbourne, Australia, where they
•must buy a book of some kind and that act DIVORCES them at once.
Any person that is bashful need not mention the fact of their pilgrimage at the Book Arcade, when they purchase the book,
unless they choose.
Anyone having obtained a DIVORCE will be allowed to choose out of 9 other portraits. If the number of the portrait that
fell to their lot was 8, they can choose any other number ending with 8, as 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, and 98, or if their first
number was 65 they can choose from 5,15, 25, 35,45, 55, 75, 85, 95 and so on, whatever their number was they may choose from the
corresponding figures throughout the table.
If, after making a choice out of the 9 portraits, anyone is still dissatisfied, by making 10 pilgrimages to the Book Arcade, or
by buying and giving away 10 of this Funny Picture Book, they can claim the indulgence of a GRAND DIVORCE and choose
which they like out of the whole 104 portraits.
Given under our Royal hand and Seal at the Palace of the Book Arcade, this 21st day of November, 1882. —COLE, REX

GEESE AND THE FOX.
There was once a Goose at the point of death,
So she called her three daughters near,
And desired them all, with her latest breath,
Her last dying words to hear:
“Build houses, ere long, of stone or of bricks,
And get tiles for your roofs, I pray;
For I know, of old. Master Fox’s tricks,
And I know he will come some day.”
Thus saying, she died, and her daughters fair, —
Gobble, Goosey, and Ganderee, —
Agreed together, that they would beware
Of Master Fox, their enemy.
Now Gobble, with some boards, made a nest,
For a roof took the lid of a box;
Then quietly laid herself down to rest,
And thought she was safe from the Fox,
But Reynard, in taking an evening run,
Soon scented the Goose near the pond;
Thoughthe, “Now I’llhave some supper and
fun,
For of both I am really fond.”
Then on to the box he sprang in a trice.
And roused Mrs. Gobble from bed
She only had time to hiss once or twice
Ere he snapt of her lily-white head.
Now Goosey was pretty but liked her own
way,
Like Gobble and some other birds.
“ ’ Tis no matter,” said she, “ if I only obey]
A part of my mother’s last words.”
So her house she soon built of nice red brick
But she only thatched it with straw;
And she thought however the Fox might kick
He could not get e’en a paw.
So she went to sleep, and at dead of night
She heard at the door a low scratch;
And presently Eeynard, with all his might
Attempted to jump on the thatch.
But he tumbled back, and against the wall
Grazed his nose in a fearful way,
Then, almost mad with the pain of his fall.
He barked and ran slowly away.
But soon he had lighted a bundle of straws
And made no more noise than a mouse.
Then lifted himself up on his hind paws.
And quickly set fire to the house.
'Twas soon in a blaze, and Goosey awoke,
With fright almost ready to die.
And, nearly smothered with heat and with
smoke,
Up the chimney was forced to fly.
The Fox was rejocied to witness her flight
And heedless of all her sad groans.
He chased her until he saw her alight,
Then eat her up all but her bones.
Ganderee took the advice of her mother and
friend,
And made her house very secure,
Then she said, —‘‘Now whatever may be my end;
The Fox cannot catch me, I’m sure.”
He called at her door the very next day.
And loudly and long did he knock,
But she said to him, —“Leave my house I pray,
For the door I will not unlock.”
“To-morrow, he cried, “there will be a fair.
All the birds and the beasts will go;
So allow me, I pray, to escort you there.
For you will be quite charmed I know."
" Many thanks for your news,” said Ganderee,
“But I had rather not go with you:
I care not for any gay sight to see; ”
So the window she closed, and withdrew.
In the morning, howe’er, her mind she changed.
And she thought she would go to the fair;
So her numerous feathers she nicely arranged,
Ahd cleaned her red bill with much care.
When the Goose arrived she began to laugh
At the wondrous creatures she saw;
There were dancing bears, and a tall Giraffe,
And a beautiful red macaw.
Ganderee went into an elephant’s shop,
And quickly she bought a new churn;
For, as it grew late, she feared to stop.
As in safety she wished to return.
’Twas late when she reached her house at noon,
And the Fox ne’er saw her that day;
But after the fair he came very soon.
And cried out in a terrible way,—
“Quick, quick, let me in! oh, for once be kind.
For the huntsman’s horn I hear:
Oh, hide me in any snug place you can find.
For the hunters and hounds draw near.”
“I’ll hide you,’’she said, ‘ ‘ in my nice new churn.”
“That will do very well,” said he;
“And thank you for doing me this good turn.
Most friendly and kind Ganderee."
Then into the chum the Fox quickly got}
But, ere the Goose put on the top,
A kettle she brought of water quite hot.
And poured in every drop.
Then the Fox cried out,“0! I bum, I bum.
And I feel in a pitiful plight
But the Goose held fast the lid of the chum.
So Eeynard he died that night.
Goosey, Goosey, Gander.
Goosey, goosey, gander.
Where shall I wander ?
Up stairs, down stairs,
And in my lady’s chamber s
There I met an old man
That would not say his prayers;
I took him by the left leg.
And threw him down stairs.
The Hen and her Ducks.
There was a little hen.
Very small and thick.
And this little hen
Never had a chick.
But in the straw, one day.
She began to scratch,
And four eggs she did lay,
Some young ones to hatch.
The farmer heard her cluck.
And he thought it best
To put the eggs of a duck
Into Biddy’s nest.
And soon the hen marched out
With a pretty young brood.
But what she led about
She never understood.
Proud was the little Biddy,
When she called " Chuck! chuck I”
She did not know, the niddy,
i A chicken from a duck.
The first pond they came nigh
The ducks waddled in,
While poor Biddy did cry.
And made a loud din.
But the ducks did not know
What frightened their mother;
Or what made her scream so.
And make such a pother.
For they liked it right well
To splash in the waters.
While the hen could not tell
What on earth ailed her daughters.
So she spread out her wings,
And went screaming about.
Till the fat little things
Had all paddled out.
The Clucklng-Hen.
“Will you take a walk with me.
My little wife, to-day ?
There’s barley in the barley-field.
And hay-seed in the hay.”
“Thank you," said the Clucking-hen;
"I’ve something elso to do;
I’m busy sitting on my eggs,
I cannot walk with you.”
“Cluck, cluck, cluck, cluck,”
Said the Clucking-hen:
“My little chicks will soon be hatched.
I’ll think about it then.”
The Clucking-hen sat on her nest,
She made it in the hay;
And warm and snug beneath her breast
A dozen white eggs lay.
Crack, crack, went all the eggs.
Out dropt the chickens small I
“Cluck," said the Clucking-hen,
“Now I have you all.”
"Come along my little chicks,
I’ll take a walk with YOU."
“ Hollo 1" said the bam-door Cock,
“ Cock-a-doodle-doo!”
Hlsglei)y Plggleby.
Higglepy Piggelby, my black hen.
She lays eggs for gentlemen;
Sometimes nine, and sometimes ten,
Higglepy Piggleby, my black hen.

Popular Errors.
The commonly received notion, that a man may marry his first cousin, but must not marry his second, is not true; but it is quite true that Cole’s Book
Arcade is in Bourke Street, Melbourne, about half way between the Post Office and Parliament House.
The rumour that a Yankee Gentleman had invented a machine to take the noise out of thunder, has turned out not to be true ; but it is quite true that
Cole’s Book Arcade is open from eight in the morning, to ten at night, every working day in the year.
The fact that Cole’s Book Arcade contains 20,000 sorts of books is not the cause of the sea being salt of cocoa-nuts containing milk of the growth
of big gooseberries, or of the multitude of great big fibs being told annually about a sea-serpent.
It is not true that cats will sack the breath of children when they are asleep, but it is quite true that Cole’s Book Arcade contains one interesting cat,
and twenty thousand sorts of interesting books.

To the Readee. —l beg to make two, and only two remarks upon this immense variety of girls’ names.
The first is:—That note-paper can be obtained with any of them beautifully engraved on it, in whatever
color preferred, at one hour’s notice, at Cole’s Book Arcade, Melbourne. And the second remark is:—Be
sure and preserve the list carefully, as it will serve from which to choose names for your daughters up
to the number of 555 without using the same name over again. P.S. If you should be very, very
lucky, and have more than 555 daughters, and want more names, call on Professor Cole, at the Book
Arcade, and he will give you an extra list.

MEN WITH TAILS.
) Account of a race of human beings with tails,
) discovered by Mr. Jones, the traveller, in the
) interior of New Guinea.
< Many eminent scientific men have inclined to
c the belief that human beings in the long past
( were possessed of tails, good respectable tails,
\ and not the stumpy apology for one which man
S now possesses. The statement, that men now
) possess tails, may somewhat startle;some of our
) readers, who are unacquainted with the fact,
1 (yet nevertheless it is a fact) that every human
) being amongst us possesses, just under the skin,
r and distinctly palpable to the touch, a rudi-
mentary tail, a real veritable tail of about two
( inches in length. Look at a human skeleton in
) any anatomical museum, and you will see at the
) bottom of the backbone, generally four distinct
) bones, exactly resembling the short tail of a
> gorilla. These bones are called collectively by
) anatomists the os coccyx from their being curved
) in the shape of a cuckoo’s beak. Our readers
J will have observed how a person writhes from
being slightly kicked behind, or from falling
) backwards a short distance against a stone or
j the blunt point of some hard substance. It is
> the striking against the coccyx, or to speak
> in plain English, the point of the stumpy
) tail, that causes the excruciating pain. As
i man now exists physically, the human tail,
1 from conception, through life to death,
1 presents several strange changes. For a
1 few weeks, in the early stages of the
1 embryotic state, he has a tail as long as a
J dog, a cat, a monkey, and most other mam-
, male, and it is only in later stages that it
, retrogrades and becomes rudimentary. Just
i after birth, and in the child it remains
simply a piece of gristle ; as youth advances
it hardens consecutively into four distinct
bones, not moveable at pleasure as in the
lower animals, but moveable backwards
and forwards for about an inch by external
pressure; and finally, as arule, about middle
age, the four bones, one after the other,
grow together into one bone. Mr. Darwin,
Mr Huxley, and others, have long held that
this stumpy tail in man is simply the
remains of a much longer tail that the race
once possessed ; that there is evidence, vast
and varied, to show that it is quite a common
thing in the animal kingdom for organs to
shrink up and become rudimentary from
disuse. As illustrations taken from thou-
sands which could be quoted, that the eyes
of the common mole who burrows under
ground, the fish and other animals who
inhabit the mammoth cave of Kentucky,
and such like places, and the wings of
birds accidentally located upon far isolated
islands in the ocean have become rudimeu-
tary from disuse; that they plainly indicate
by their anatomical structure that they
were once used, but that changed natural
conditions not requiring their use, in the
course of many generations they have
shrunk up and become rudimentary ; and,
finally, that the human coccyx or tail, by
its bony, muscular, and nervous structure,
bears within itself exceedingly strong pre-
sumptive evidence that by gradual disuse,
extending over a long period of time, it has
shrunk up to its present stumpy state.
Mr. Darwin, in particular, in his “Descent
of Man," vol. 1, p. 206, says : “ The early
progenitors of man were no doubt, once covered
with hair, both sexes having beards; their ears
were pointed, and capable of movement, and
their bodies were provided with a tail having the
proper muscles."
The theories of Darwin, Huxley, and
several other eminent naturalists collectively
seem to be that in the course of progressive
development, extending over many thousand
generations, men having gradually accustomed
themselves to the erect attitude by standing and
walking upon their hind-legs only, have set free
the fore-legs, which we call arms, to swing
about 4c., and so done away with the necessity
of a tail. These preliminary observations on
the physical fact of man’s rudimentary tail,
and the bold and elaborate theories of eminent
natural philosophers thereon, have been
called forth by the startling announcement
which has just reached us, of the discovery by
a traveller of a race of men in the interior of
New Guinea, still possessing tails of unmistak-
able length, thereby once more triumphantly
demonstrating to the world that the deductions
of honest, laborious, scientific men are, as a rule
verified by later discoveries. Mr. Thomas Jones,
the talented and observant traveller in ques-
tion, informs us that he arrived by ship at the
native village of Etihwretep, on the north-east
coast of New Guinea, on the 21th of December,
1871, with an intention of exploring the upper
waters of the river Tramsderf, and the coun-
try thereabout; that on the 3rd of January,
having his outfit completed, he started, in com-
pany with a European body-servant and a native
guide and interpreter, for the interior. We
have not space, nor is it our purpose, to recount
the adventures with beasts, reptiles, and hu-
man savages, the sufferings from exposure, and
MANNERS SIUOL,
King of the Elocweans.
the interesting and useful observations of the
traveller; suffice it to say, that after seventeen
days of dangerous and arduous marching
through the jungle, he reached the hill country,
and in two more days arrived at a country
where dwelt a community of people which
filled him with astonishment, and the dis-
covery of which will render his name im-
mortal. Mr Jones found a community of men
walking upon two legs, but bent forward, with
a considerable amount of hair on their bodies,
long arms, claw-like fingers, and real tangible
tails, more or less long. Mr. Jones’s discovery,
although far more extraordinary, is very similar
to the discovery of the strange nation or oom-
munity of the Mandan Indians, by Mr. Catlin.
A few years ago, Mr. Catlin found a community
of men, one of the most remarkable the world
has ever seen, within a few hundred miles of
the settled States of America ; and Mr. Jones
has just now discovered a community, even
stranger than the world has ever seen, within
a few hundred miles of important English,
Spanish, and Dutch settlements in the Eastern
Archipelago. We have called Mr Jones’s dis-
covery extraordinary—it is more than this —it
is perfectly astounding. Accustomed as we have
been from time immemorial to consider man as
pre-eminently the one sole biped at least with-
out a visible tail, and so strong are our pre-
possessions in favor of the uniformity of the
human shape in the present age, in all the
known countries of the world, that were it not
for the high standing and well known integrity
of the traveller, and the high character of the
“Calcutta Anthropological Beview"—to the
proprietors of which he has imparted the
startling information—we should still doubt;
but, of course, with such authorities before
us, strange as is the fact, our doubts must
cease. But to return to our traveller’s own
narrative. He informs us, that after pene-
trating through an immense jungle and
crossing a mountainous district, he arrived
on the 24th of January, at a valley called by
the natives Eloc. Here he first met with
the new race of men. The natives call
themselves Elocwe or Elocweans, the exact
meaning of which Mr. Jones could not as-
certain. When he first beheld them at a
distance, he concluded by their form, atti-
tude, and motions, that they were a species
of gorilla, remarkably approaching the hu-
man form, and was dubious of getting too
near to them, but was soon greatly and
agreebly astonished to hear them utter
distinct human speech, and a moment <
later saw in front of him a number of hu* i
man habitations. Their houses are made
of bamboo, very ingeniously constructed, of 1
two and sometimes three stories in height; 1
but for some reason they never sleep or '
dwell at all upon the ground floor. Mr. '
Jones saw around him the evidences ofahigh |
but remarkably unique civilisation, plainly (
of spontaneous native growth, but perhaps, (
all in all, scarcely inferior to that of India i
or China, or even Eastern Europe. Of their (
speech he could not understand a word, nor (
could the native interpreter, who acoom- <
panied him from the coast, give him any J
assistance. He therefore determined to re-
main amongst them for a time to learn
sufficient of the language to enable him to en-
able him to enquire into their manners, (
customs, laws, 4c., and obtain all the gene-
ral knowledge he could about them. He
remained amongst them about fourteen (
months. For general information of what (
he saw, and what he heard, we must refer the )
reader to the pages of our authority, the )
“Calcutta Anthropological Beview." or to the )
traveller’s own book, which will shortly be )
published, and shall simply epitomise some )
of his imformation about the most astonish- )
ing part of his discovery—that relating to ?
the human tail. Mr. Jones informs us that <
the Elocweans believe that they are the only (
people in the world who have tails (in (
this they are probably correct) and that,
consequently, they are superior to all
others; that the tail is the most sacred and
most important part of the whole body; that
while amongst Europeans and most other
peoples the dandies, male and female, are
prouder of their face than any other part of
their body, the dandies among the Elocweans
are proudest of their tails; that while they
generally wear nothing on their head or body,
except a slight covering round their loins, yet
that they deck out their tails with the most'
costly and delicate finery ; that while among
the Europeans, and in fact all the peoples of


the known world, the various passions
and emotions are indicated by the ex-
pressions of the face, among the Eloc-
weans they are shown through the tail,
and in this respect they correspond in
some particulars to such expressions in
the lower animals. The twisting of the
tip of the tail indicates impatience, the
lateral-lashing j stroke indicates anger,
a twirling motion indicates applause,
the ordinary wagging of the tail, recog-
nition, the tail depressed in certain
positions between the _ legs indicates re-
spectively fear, submission, or great grief;
one peculiar attitude of the tail indicates
determination, another love, another
hatred, another contempt, another joy,
another respect, another pride, another
humility, another dogged sulkiness, an-
other defiance, another despair, another
commiseration, another expectancy, an-
other jealousy, another inquiry, another
approbation, another disapprobation, an-
other yes, another no, another excessive
mirth, or more properly tail laughter.
In fact, the tail itself _is literally an
organ of speech, such is the variety of
feelings indicated by its numerous
turns and nice shades of movement; one
in particular we must mention, it being very
remarkable, as bearing upon a European
custom, namely, that of shaking hands.
The Elocweans, in bidding each other
welcome or adieu, move the tail up and
down, just the same as Europeans shake
hands; and they have a theory on this
subject which may or
may not be true. They
hold that all mankind
once had tails ; that all,
except their own nation,
lost them as a punish-
ment for eating animal
flesh; and that the
general mode of shak-
ing hands was merely
adopted as a convenient
but miserable substitute
for the previously simi-
lar shaking of the tail.
But the expression of
the passions and emo-
tions are not the only
use to which the tail is
put. The Elocweans
play games of dexterity
and skill, beat time,
ring small bells with
great nicety, and, ab-
surd as it may appear,
play certain musical
instruments with it.
Another service to
which they put it, is
to use it as a fan, for
the purpose of cooling
themselves and keep-
ing away flies, mosqui-
tos, and other winged i'i-
sects from their persona. They affix a number
of large feathers in a certain manner, along
the last half-length of the tail, and extend-
ing considerably beyond it, and then by
constant and varying motions, keep up a
most refreshing current of air, and so much
do they use themselves to this, that they are
able to do it for several hours in succession
without tiring, whether sitting, walking, or
standing, and at the same time that they
are fully employing their hands in their
usual occupations. Our traveller says that
oftimes when tormented with numbers of
flying, biting, and stinging insects, and near-
ly suffocated with heat, in that sultry torrid
clime, he has almost envied them their
Eliar appendage, seeing how much a com-
ras a first-class fanning machine, it
can be made.
With respect to the way in which they
play certain musical instruments of their
own simple yet strange construction, some
of his assertions are most astounding ;
among others he describes one kind of
melody which they produce by fixing two
pieces of reed in a peculiar manner near the
tip of the tail, and then, by a sudden twirling
swing, produce a most magnificent effect, something
like the sounds of an elaborate but loud zEolian harp;
and he asserts that when a number of fifty or more
gyrate their tails, so attuned in concert, in a building
that reverberates the sound, that the effect is sublimely
magnificent. In all public games and amusements the
tail counts as the most important member of the body,
and has more work thrown upon it than either the legs
or arms. The various societies, and public bodies, in
marching through passages, along the streets, or to the
recreation grounds, do not walk arm in arm, or hand in
hand, two or four abrest, as the Europeans do, but
move in single file ; the oldest man in the society goes
before, the next in age then follows, taking hold of his
tail with one dr both hands, the next in seniority the
same, and so on to the youngest, who brings up the
rear. Mr. Jones asserts that on one occasion he saw
not less than 500 men so marching in Indian file like a
huge serpent winding between the hills. In the same
way also, the members of a family invariably move
through the streets and lanes of the city, along the
roads, or across the fields to wherever they may be
bound, the rule of seniority always being observed —the
father goes first, then the mother, then the oldest un-
married son, then the oldest unmarried daughter, and
so on to the youngest child capable of walking, who
comes last. Mr. Jones says that it is not at all an un-
common thing to see families composed of the father,
mother, and twenty children, varying from two to
twenty years of age, in one connected string, walking
leisurely along; that these strings of families pass
each other in the most crowded thoroughfares
with the greatest ease, and that the inconvenience of
being brought to a full stop or run up against, arising
from the absurd European custom of walking arm in
arm, or hand in hand, three or four abreast, never

occurs. But although the Elocweans in some respects
act very sensibly, more so than Europeans, in some
other respects they act very absurdly, particularly in
matters of fashion. Fashionable deportment is an
element that enters largely into the question of tails,
besides the ever-varying dresses and ornaments of the
tail. There is always a fashionable position in which
to bear it, and among the upper classes particularly,
this is carried to a ridiculous extent—in fact to a sub-
lime absurdity, probably beyond even the conception of
Europeans, foolish as they themselves are in some res-
pects on the question of fashion. Pride of caste, of
position, of wealth, is indicated through the tail to a
very great extent. It is quite a common thing to see
dandies of either or both sexes walk along the streets,
tossing and twirling and swinging their tails in the
most haughty manner imaginable. Mr. Jones affirms
that the various turns, and twists, and twirls, and
shakes and motions of all kinds of the tail performed by
the aristocratically inclined to signify pride and
contempt alone are not less than forty in number. The
color, size, shape, and general contour of tails is an-
other question which largely engages the thoughts of
the Elocweans. It is more or less genteel or vulgar to
have a large tail, a small tail, a curved tail, a straight
tail, a bare tail, a hairy tail, a fleshy tail, a bony tail, a
long tail, a flat tail, a round tail, a lanky tail, a stumpy
tail, 4c. A stumpy tail is considered vulgar, the same
as a snub nose is among Europeans. A
tail, accordingto our measurement, nineteen
inches long, gradually tapering from about
one and a half inch at the base to a quarter
of an inch at the tip, moderately fleshy, of a
copper color, and with a slight natural
curve downwards, is the ideal tail of the
Elocweans. It is a common practice to put
the tail of children in a sheath, to gradually
give it the fashionable shape, the same
as young ladies wear tight stays to give
them small aristocratic waists; as the
Chinese put their children’s feet into dimin-
utive shoes to make their feet aristocratically
small, or as the Flathead Indians of North-
western America put their children’s heads
between boards to make of them aristocra-
tic Platheads.
With respect to the various styles of dress,
the Elocweans frequently deck out and
ornament their tails with bird of paradise
and other gorgeous feathers, millinery,
jewelry &c, in the most fantastic fashions, and
which fashions are continually changing
some of these are minutely described in detail
and are certainly absurd enough. One fashion
consists of a number of brilliant feathers
frills arranged round the tail in bottle-hrush
form, with a blown bladder at the end; an-
other, the latest, and certainly the most
sober mentioned, consist of about a dozen
colored rings fixed at equal distances around
the body of the tail, a series of five or six
bows or artifical flowers along the top, and
a streamer dependant from each ring along
the under surface ; the general effect of this
fashionas willbeseenhy
the likeness next page,
taken from life, is not
inelegant. At first, and
for some time, our
traveller was inclined
to indulge in ridicule;
and frequently when
some monstrous absur-
dity of fashion came to
his notice, he could
scarcely keep himself
from openly expressing
or looking contempt;
hut at length, after he
had become somewhat
used to them, more im-
partial and philosophi-
cal councils seem to
have prevailed in his
breast, and he says :—I
reflected that human
nature is human nature
the world over. Many
Asiatic and African
nations absurdly wear
rings and other orna-
ments in their noses
and around their legs;
and even in my own
Europe, women absurdly
wear massive pendants
in their ears, brac-
lets and armlets on their arms, rid-
iculous figure-deforming Grecian bends,
monstrous, inconvenient, flame-inviting cri-
nolines, draggling, wasteful, dust-sweep
ing, dirt-collecting trains, and ever vary-
ing absurdities on their bodies, chig-
nons, and constantly varying absurdities
on their heads; at one time wearing a
bonnet nearly a yard across ; at another
time a wafer-like bonnet of scarcely an
inch across; at one time with it tilted on the
nose so as to hide the sight, and leave the
back of the head bare; another time with it
fixed at the back of the neck leaving all the
front of his head bare ; and another time
stuck away in the distance at the back
of the crown beyond a pad of horse-
hair, goats’-hair, cows’-hair, or other arti-
flcal stuffing; at one time combing their hair
back so as almost to tear it out by the roots
to give them fashionable, high, intellectual
foreheads ; and at another time trimming it
straight down almost to their eyebrows, to
give them fashionably low gorilla-like fore-
heads, or what is very aptly styled the idiotic
crop. And if these, my own people, who stand
in the van of civilizaton—at the very head
of the rational world—make such in


[ expressibly unutterable donkeys of themselves,
[ until the term new fashion has become al-
-1 most synonymous with new foolery, until it
comes to be expected by all common-sense'
observers that nine out of every ten new
i fashions will of necessity be some fresh ex-
hibition of the absurd, what right have
I as a European, to laugh at these poor
i Elocweans. —Why should I laugh at them,
when the simplest reflection tells me that
if it had so happened that Europeans were
possessed of taxis, they would dress and
ornament them just as fantastically and
monstrously as the Elocweans now do.
1 There are six distinct classes who get
1 their living entirely by attending to the
wants and science of the tail. First, tail-doctors,
i who are skilled in the diseases peculiar to the
tail, and attend to the physical welfare of
diseased, injured, or deformed tails, just as
[ exclusively as eye and ear doctors attend to
[ those organs among Europeans. Second, tail-
[ barbers, who shampoo and shave the tail, make
[ and sell washes, perfumes, lubricating oils, &c.,
I with which to wash and anoint it, tattoo the
I tail with elaborate designs, make sheathes to
I protect it in the same way as gloves protect the
) hands, and also to make it grow to the fashion-
) able shape, and last, but not least, make false
) tails; for so much importance being attached
) to the tail, false tails are much more common
I among the Elocweans than false eyes, noses,
teeth, legs, and arms are among Europeans.
! Third, tail milliners, jewellers, and general
[ decorators. This class prepares and sells ribbons,
[ fringes, gorgeous feathers, rings, small bells,
' decorations, and tappings of all kinds to orna-
) ment the tail according to the fashions of the
day. Fourth, tailologists, a class of professors
who study the science of the tail, write books,
and deliver lectures upon it, describe the
characters and dispositions of persons as in-
dicated by its size, texture, complexion, shape,
( &c., the same as phrenologists and physiologists
i do respectively by the head and face amongst
( Europeans. Fifth, tailomancers, a class of men
( and women, who profess to tell fortunes, solve
( problems, predict events, &c., by the peculiar
) arrangement of the hairs, the veins, the color,
’ the shape, and the involuntary motions of the
I tail. Sixth, tail doctors, a class who make,
) advertise, and sell certain ointments which they
) assert will, under favourable conditions, known
( only to themselves, make the tail beautiful,
> obliterate deformities, cure it of any complaint,
( or even make it grow in length, thickness, or to
i any required shape. Mr. Jones informs us that
/ this class, although looked upon with contempt
/ by the more intelligent, are extensively patron-
) ised by the ignorant; he himself has the most
) supreme contempt for them, and relates a cer-
) tain anecdote, at their expense, which we think
) too good to let pass. A certain quack tail-doctor,
) who, from a professional point of view, was a
( very modest sort of man—he did not profess to
( compound and sell a pill or ointment like Hollo-
( way’s, or an elixir of life like somebody else’s,
( that a few boxes or bottles taken or rubbed on,
( would cure all diseases incident to the human
f frame, present and to come; but he devoted him-
/ self exclusively to the department of tail surgery,
) and in this line he asserted himself to be supe-
) rior to all living men. His peculiar ointment
) he called fail bone and nerve all-healing salve.
) According to his own account, on one occasion
) he thought he would try an experiment with it
( to see its full force under the most favourable
( conditions, so he cut off his dog’s tail and appli-
( ed some to the stump. A new tail grew out
( immediately; he then applied some to the
Siece of the tail which he had cut off, and a new
og grew out. He did not know which dog was
} which. As the tail is so highly esteemed, their
1' laws respecting it are numerous, elaborate, and
severe; the tail being considered the most
sacred member of the body, it is held to be the
most heinous crime against man to injure it;
therefore, for wilfully cutting off or vitally in-
juring the tail of another the punishment is
death. One heavier crime is known —the eating
\ of animal flesh—and that is followed by the
( heaviest punishment known to the law, viz.,
I amputation of the offender’s tail; 100, 200,
' and sometimes 300, strokes with a bamboo are
} given for the first offence; for wilfully jamming
) a tail in a doorway, wilfully treading on it, or
wounding it in any other way, although the
part may be little injured, the intention is held
to constitute the deed, but for second offences
of the kind the lex talionis, or the principal of
equivalents, of an eye for an eye, a tooth for a
tooth, is brought into action, the offender’s
tail is always injured by the public executioner
in the same manner, and to the same extent as
the one he wilfully injured. Condemned per-
sons are always made fast by their tails, and so
sacred do they consider them that they never
attempt to get away for fear of inj wring them.
Our traveller has seen as many as 150 all made
fast by their tails to a length of rope, marching
along the road to their task-work, and only one
person to look after them on the journey. Many
of what are considered the most heinous crimes
are punished by loss of parts of the tail; hence
a person, condemned of habitual lying, loses one
joint; of habitual laziness, two joints ; of habi-
tual theft, three joints ; of murder, four joints;
of witchcraft, five joints; of killing one of the
red kind of the birds of paradise, all except the
last joint; and as before mentioned, for eating
animal flesh, amputation of the entire tail. The
Elocweans are very kindly in their disposition
and will not knowingly injure a living animal.
According to their notions, one of the heaviest
crimes, next to eating animal flesh, is the taking
of animal life, and the penalty of which is the
same as for murder. They have a law making
DML YNNEJ,
Queen of the Elocweans,
Dressed in the latest Tail Fashion,
cruelty to animals punishable by heavy penalties;
and singular to say, so great is their veneration
for, or prejudice in favour of tails, as it were
even in the abstract, chat an offender receives
three times as much punishment for cutting off,
or otherwise injuringan animal's tail as he would
for hurting the same animal in any other part of
the body. But at the same time that they
inflict heavy penalties for cruelty, it must be
cruelty, within the meaning of the act, that is,
wilful and deliberate cruelty. This excessive
admiration for, and careful conservation of tailsof
even those of the lower animals, by the Eloc-
weans, and their extreme conscientiousness in
punishing only the wilfully cruel, even in so
sensitive a matter, moves our traveller consider-
ably; he is pleased with their humane feelings
and strict conscientiousness, but astonished
and amused at their absurd belief and pratice in
the matter, and relates an apt but amusing
European anecdote:—A gentleman having a
fancy dog with a long tail told his servant.
Patrick, to cut it off, as is the custom with many
people. Pat promised to do as ordered. For
three or four weeks after this the gentleman
heard a great yelping of the dog every morning
before he got up; his curiousity was excited,
and one day he ask ?d, “Pat, what makes Pincher
cry out every morning ? “ Shure, and you told
me to cut his tail off,” says Pat. “ I could not
find it in my heart to cut it off all at once, so I
cut off half an inch each morning to make it go
'asier with the poor baste.” Mr Jones is in
doubt how the Elocweans would deal with
this case; he thinks they would be some-
what mixed in opinion; their extreme hu-
mane feelings at the prolonged sufferings of
the poor dog, and their excessive sensitiveness
on the mutilation of that almost sacred mem-
ber, the tail, would incline them to murder him;
but then Pat acted from the most philanthropic
of motives, and certainly was not guilty of in-
tentional cruelty, and on this ground they
would incline to not only acquit him, but give
him their blessing. Taking all the aspects of
the case, therefore, the judgment would pro-
bably be, give him a beating and a handsome
reward, and let him go. Space will not permit
us to follow the extremely interesting, and
scarcely less amusing account of the traveller
any further. He seems to have been fully
aware that he had made a discovery such as it
falls to the lot of few men to make; and
certainly not one man in a generation, scarcely
in a century, does make a discovery so startling
in itself. He saw that the most interesting
Subject connected with this new-found people,
was that caudal peculiarity which certainly
places them as the most unique people on the
face of the earth. He knew that this pecu-
liarity, so strangely and so exceedingly novel,
while it most interested himself, would also
most interest the world at large, consequently
he has given it his almost undivided attention,
and has collected a mass of curious information,
not a quarter of which is summarised in this
notice; and for what he says on tail con-
versations, tail games, tail fights, tail
dexterities, tail gymnastics, tail pedigrees,
tail shows, (a la baby shows) tails in-
sults, tail etiquette, tail literature in prose
and verse, tail superstitions, tail stories, tail
theories, &c., we must refer the curious reader to
the account itself. We cannot close, however,
without mentioning one of his curious, in fact
the most curious of his many reflections. It is
this. He refers to the thousand and one tail
pains, and the thousand and one tail pleasures
that the Elocweans respectively suffer and en-
joy, and he asked himself the question, is it best
to have a tail ? After enumerating the many
mental and corporal sufferings that the Eloc-
weans undergo from ugly tail, deformed tail,
diseased tail, jammed tail, burnt tail, scalded
tail, frostbitten tail, rheumatic tail, crushed,
mangled, and sore tail from all causes, and tail
pains of all kinds, besides the enormous cost of
keeping it clothed, doctored, decorated, &c.;
he seems more than half inclined to congratu-
late himself that he has escaped so much suffer-
ing, from being, in spite of his rudimentary
tail, practically tailless; but upon passing in
review the numbeiless ecstatic delights, extra j
sensations and pleasures, mental and corporeal, (
that the Elocweans enjoy in consequence of ;
having that extra member, and accepting the )
principal that the pleasurable sensations of our ( !
members always exceed the pains, and therefore
the more members we have the more we enjoy; J
he finally, and positively, concludes that taken
all in all, the good with the bad, that the Eloc- I
weans, in possessing another important organ '
are the most happy people in the world, and (
that it is best for man to have a toil. )

all collected together, there was no animal larger
than a small shrimp or snail that was not there, for
all kinds of animals are eaten by someone in the

NAUGHTY BOYS.
Mr. Brown, the grocer, having nearly emptied a cask of sugar in front of his shop, a
number of naughty boys, seeing his back turned, commenced to steal some. Mr. Brown,
spying them through the window, came out, and the reader can see what happened A
bystander informs us that muttered howls of agony arose from the tu,sk, and all the boys'
interest in sugar was at an end.
BOY WHO STOLE OUT WITHOUT LEAVE.
I remember, I remember.
When I was a little Boy,
One fine morning in September
Uncle brought me home a toy.
I remember how he patted
Both my cheeks in kindliest mood;
"Then,” said he, “you little Fat-head,
There’s a top because you’re good.”
Grandmamma—a shrewd observer—
I remember gazed upon
My new top, and said with fervour,
"Oh! how kind of Uncle John!
While mamma, my form caressing,—
In her eye the tear-drop stood.
Bead me this fine moral lesson,
“ See what comes of being good!”
I remember, I remember.
On a wet and windy day.
One cold morning in December,
I stole out and went to play j
I remember Billy Hawkins
Came, and with his pewter squirt
Squibbed my pantaloons and stockings.
Till they were all over dirt!
To my mother for protection
I ran, quaking every limb:
She exclaim’d, with fond affection,
" Gracious Goodness! look at him! ”
Pa cried, when he saw my garment,
’Twas a newly-purchased dress—
“ Oh! you nasty little Warment,
How came you in such a mess ?”
Then he caught me by the collar,
—Cruel only to be kind—
And to my exceeding dolour.
Gave me—several slaps behind.
Grandmamma, while yet I smarted.
As she saw my evil plight.
Said —’twas rather stony-hearted—
" Little rascal! sarve him right !’*
I remember, I remember.
From that sad and solemn day.
Never more in dark December
Did I venture out to play.
And the moral which they taught, I
Well remember: thus they said—
" Little Boys, when they are naughty.
Must be whipp’d and sent to bed! ”


Dirty Jack,
There was one little Jack,
Not very long back.
And ’tis said, to his lasting disgrace.
That he never was seen,
With his hands at all clean;
Nor yet ever clean was his face.
His friends were much hurt
To see so much dirt.
And often and well did they scour;
But all was in vain.
He was dirty again
Before they had done it an hour.
When to wash he was sent.
He reluctantly went.
With water to splash himself o’er
But he left the black streaks
Eunning down both his cheeks.
And made them look worse than
before.
The pigs in the dirt
Could not be more expert
Than he was, in grubbing about;
And people have thought.
This gentleman ought
To be made with four legs and a snout.
The idle and bad may, like to this lad.
Be dirty and black, to be sure;
But good boys are seen
To be decent and clean,
Altho’ they are ever so poor.
Throwing Stones.
Johnny Jones, why do you doit?
Those who throw stones.
Surely will rue it;
Little of pleasure, evil may flow.
Mischief past measure comes of a blow.
Yes, yes! stone flinging.
Laugh as you may.
Woe may be bringing
Upon you some day.
Some one is watching.
Armed by the law;
Truncheon from pocket.
Soon he will draw.
Off he will march you,—
Dreadful to think! —to a dark prison.
Light through a chink.
Bread without butter, water for drink.
Dirty Dick.
Dirty, noisy, mischievous Dick
Struggled and tore, and wanted to
fight
Susan the nurse, who in the bath
Began to wash him on Saturday
night.
Her hair he tried to pull up by the roots.
The water he splash’d all over the floor.
Which ran down stairs, and one night
made
A terrible slop at the parlor door.
To give him advice was waste of time.
So his father resolved to try a stick;
And never since then has he been call’d
Dirty, noisy mischievous Dick.
BOY THAT STOLE THE APPLES.
A boy looked over a wall.
And spied some lovely apples;
"But,” says he, "the tree is tall,
And belongs to 'Grumpy’ Chappies.”
Still I think some could be got
By a climbing lad like me;
I’ll try and steal a lot.
So, here goes up the tree.”
The wall he then got over.
And up the tree he went;
But Chappies, mowing clover.
Espied the wicked gent.
He let him fill his school-bag—
Get over the wall again;
Eushed up and played at touch-tag
Which surprised him much, and then: —
Look at the Picture!l!
Mischievous fingers.
Pretty little fingers.
Wherefore were they made;
Like ten smart young soldiers,
All in pink arrayed.
Apt and quick, obedient
To your lightest thought.
Doing in an instant
Everything they’re taught.
’Twas for play or study.
Pen to wield, or ball.
Kite, top, needle, pencil.
Prompt at parents’ call.
Picking, poking, soiling
Costly things and dear.
Wracking, cracking, spoiling.
All that they come near.
Thus ’twas with Eobert Chivers,
Brandishing a swish.
Broke a vase to shivers.
Filled with silver fish.
"Tick, tick,” says the Dutch clock.
Eobert fain would know
How its pend’lum swinging
Makes its wheels to go.
Why not ask? No; foolish
Eobert takes a stick.
Pokes, and breaks the clock, which
Ceases soon to tick.
"Puff, puff,” sighs the bellows.
Eobert wants to find.
Yet he will not ask, whence
Comes its stock of wind.
With a knife up ripping.
Finds them void and flat.
Ah ! be sure, a whipping
Eobert caught for that.
The hoy who played with Arc.
Listen about a naughty boy.
Who might have been a parent’s joy.
But that he had a strong desire
To meddle always with the fire.
One day, when his mamma went out.
She said," Mind, dear, what you’re
about.
With your nice books and playthings
stay.
And with the fire, oh, do not play.”
But soon as his mamma was gone.
And this bad boy left all alone.
Thought he, "In spite of all ma says,
now will have a glorious blaze;
“No one is by, ’tis quickly done.
And oh! ’twill be such famous fun,”
Quick then about the hearth he
strewed
Some scraps of paper and of wood;
Then lighted them and drew them out.
And with them laughing ran about.
But soon he changed his merry note.
The flames, alas; had caught his coat.
And every moment mounting higher.
His body soon was all on fire;
And though he screamed with shriek
and shout.
No one came near to put him out;
So that it happened, sad to say!
That boy was burnt to death that day.


SNOOKS’ PATENT WHIPPING MACHINE FOR FLOGGING NAUGHTY BOYS IN SCHOOL.
“The Snooks’ Whipping Machine has proved a total failure."—Times.
Meciaration of a distracted Schoolmaster.
A year afro I took charge of a school of 1,000 boys. They were a very bad lot
indeed, and I could do nothing with them. Being of a mild disposition, I
attempted to reason with them* but I might as well have reasoned with the pigs:
I then thought of punishing them, but that was a big task, and besides, what
mode of punishment should I adopt? In my utmost perplexity I wrote to
Professor Wilderspin, a great authority on the management of boys, and he
wrote as follows: —“Nearly all boys can be managed by an intelligent school-
master without punishment, but in a few cases it seems impossible to do without
it In every large school in England, Ireland, and Scotland, some corporal
punishment is used, and some must continue to be used as long as very vicious
children continue to exist, or as long as parents spoil their children by over m-
diligence. or by wilful crimminal neglect, before they send them to school.
Yours truly. Professor Wilderspin,” I then wrote to 27 of the principal head
masters in the world, and the following are the replies:—
Prom the High School of Eton, wrote head-master, Mr. Squeera:
« if they don’t behave as they should do, why, soundly box their ears.
Prom the Grammar School of Harrow, wrote head-master, Mr. Phfools
« jf they do not behave themselves, expell them from the school.
From the Training School of Eugby, wrote head-master, Mr. Wist;
“ Just take a handful of their hair, and give a sharp, short twist.
From the College School of Oxford, wrote Professor Earey Hook :
“ Instead of nearly killing—over-awe them with a look.”
From the Bible School of Cambridge, wrote Professor William Drying:
««Well whip them with a birchen rod, and never mind their crying.
From the Blue Coat School of London, wrote Professor Eupert.Gower:
“ At arm’s-length make them hold a book, the space of half an hour.
From the Naval School of Liverpool, wrote head-master, Mr. Jointer :
•« j us t rap them on the knuckles, with a common teacher’s pointer.
From the People’s School of Manchester, wrote head-master, Mr. Flowers:
“ Make them kneel down as still as death, for just about two hours.”
From the Infant School of Birmingham, wrote Professor Dory Heller;
“ Just put on them a fool’s-cap, marked, * dunce,’ ‘ thief, or story-teller.
From the Charity School of Sheffield, wrote head-master, , Mr. Clay s
« jf the boys are disobedient, do not let them out to play.”
From the Gentleman’s School of Brighton, wrote Professor Kobert ilaskt
«« jf the boys will act unruly, why, just make them do a task."
From the National School'd Bristol, wrote Professor Mark Groom s
‘‘lf the boys are extra naughty, shut them in a dark room.”
From the District School of Edinburgh, wrote head-master, Mr. Glass:
“ The naughty boys should all be sent to the bottom of the class."
From the Mixed School of Glasgow, wrote Professor Duncan Law:
“ To keep a proper kind of school, just use the three-tailed taw.”
From the Latin School of Dublin, wrote Professor Patrick Clayrenco :
‘‘lf the boys are very bad boys, write a letter to their parents.”
From the Mission School, Calcutta, wrote the Eev. Mr. Mac Look s
“ Try them by a boy jury, write the verdict in a black-book."
From the Lyceum of New York, wrote Professor Henry Bothing;
“ Take your delinquent boys one hour, and make them sit on nothing."
From the Public School, Chicago, wrote head-master, Mr. Norrids:
“ If they will not behave themselves, why, just you snap their foreheads."
From the Academy of San Francisco, wrote head-master, Mr. Power :
“ Make them stoop and hold their finger on the floor for just an hour.”
From the Mormon School of Utah, wrote Professor Orson Pratt:
“ First strip and make them fast, and then, just use the little cat.”
From the King’s College, Lisbon, wrote Professor Don Cassiers:
“ If you want to make them good boys, pull, pinch, and twist their ears,”
From the Cadet’s School of Paris, wrote Professor Monsieur Sour :
“ Justmake them hold their hands above, their heads for one full hour.”
From the Eoyal School of Amsterdam, wrote Professor Vander Tooler:
‘‘lf they will not behave themselves, just trounce them with a ruler,”
From the Model School of Pekin, wrote Professor Cha Han Coo :
“ Just put their hands into the stocks, and beat with a bamboo.”
From the Normal School of Moscow, wrote Professor Ivan Trout:
« To make your boys the best of boys, why, you must use the knout."
From the Muslim School of Cairo, wrote the Mufti, Pasha Saido:
“ Upon the bare soles of their feet, give them the bastinado."
From the Common School of Berlin, wrote Professor Yon De Eind :
•‘ There’s nothing like the old, old way, that ever I could find;
Just lay them right across your knee, and cane them well behind,
I’ve only just been speaking mit mine goot fren’, Doctor Whistim,
And he says that it does no harm, but is felt throughout the system,”
At last as I was thinking deep, how puzzling all this looks,
I received a tempting offer, from a certain Mr. Snooks;
His “ great machine to whip with speed" I bought with flusteration ;
But to see just how it did succeed, you view the illustration
And then look at u Professor CoWs Gentle Persuader," next page.

JACK THE GLUTTON.
“Do look at those pigs, as they lay in the
straw,”
Little Eichard said to his papa;
“They keep eating longer than ever I saw.
What nasty fat gluttons they are ! ”
“I see they are feasting” his father replied,
“ They eat a great deal I allow;
But let us remember, before we deride,
’Tis the nature, my dear, of a sow.
“But when a great boy, such as you, my
dear Dick,
Does nothing but eat all the day.
And keep sucking good things till he makes
himself sick.
What a glutton! indeed, we may say.
“ When plumcake and sugar for ever he picks*
And sweetmeats, and comfits, and
figs;
Pray let him get rid of his own nasty
tricks.
And then he may laugh at the pigs.
TOM THE DAINTY BOY.
Never be dainty and throw food
away;
’Tis sinful, as you must have heard
many say;
Besides, you yourself may require
food some day.
Though well fed.
So don’t smell your plate and turn
over your food,
And doubt if it’s wholesome, or pleas-
ant, or good;
Such conduct is not only senseless, —•
but rude
And ill-bred.
There was a young boy, who so
dainty became.
That whether his dinner was fish, flesh,
or game.
He turned up his nose at them all,
just the same.
And would cry,
“ I cannot eat this,” —and, “ I do not
like that; ”
“This chicken’s too lean,” —and
“That mutton’s too fat;
The dog he may eat it up all, or the
cat.
But not I.
The consequence was that he soon became thin;
His bones they stuck out, and his cheeks they
sunk in.
And his hands were not stronger nor thicker
than tin.
If so strong.
And his legs grew as slender as little hat-pegs.
And almost as small was his waist as his legs ;
And he looked like the laths that are fast-
ened round kegs.
Thin and long.
And thinner, and thinner, and thinner he grew,
A shadow had been rather fat, of the two;
In fact, you might easily look him right through.
If you tried.
And when he was quite to a skeleton grown.
As weak as a reed, and as cold as a stone.
He fell all to pieces, and with a faint groan,
So he died.
Boy that robbed the birds’ nest.
" To-whit! To-whit! To-whee !
Will you listen to me ?
Who stole four eggs I laid.
And the nice nest I made ?”
“Not I,” said the cow. “ Oh, no;
Such a thing I’d never do;
I gave you a wisp of hay.
But didn’t take your nest away.”
“ Coo coo ! said the dove.
I’ll speak a word my love;
Who stole that pretty nest
From a little red-breast ?”
“ Not I,” said the sheep. “Oh no.
I wouldn’t treat a poor bird so;
I gave wool the nest to line.
But the nest was none of mine.”
“ Caw! Caw!” cried the crow,
“ I should like to know
What thief took away
A bird’s nest to-day.
“ Cluck ! Cluck !” said the hen.
Don’t ask me again!
Why I hav’n’t a chick
Would do such a trick
We all gave her a feather.
And she wove them together;
I’d scorn to intrude
On her and her brood.”
“ Chirr-a-whirr! Chirr-a-whirr!
We will make a great stir;
Let us find out his name.
And all cry for shame!”
“I would not rob a bird,”
Said little Mary Green;
“ I think I never heard
Of anything so mean.”
“ ’Tis very cruel, too,”
Said little Alice Neil:
“ I wonder if he knew
How sad the bird would feel ?”
A little boy hung down his head.
And hid his face so crimson red;
For he stole that pretty nest
From little robin red-breast;
And he felt so full of shame,
I do not like to tell his name.
But during the next week
Dressed in his Sunday best
This boy set out to seek
All for another nest.
He robbed a nest up high.
Suspended in a tree;
Two birds came through the sky.
What happened you can see.
CRUEL BOY.
What! go to see the kittens drowned
On purpose in the yard!
I did not think there could be found
A little heart so hard.
Poor kittens ! No more pretty play
With pussy’s wagging tail:
Why! I’d go far enough away
Before I’d see the pail.
Poor things ! the little child that can
Be pleased to go and see.
Most likely, when he grows a man,
A cruel man will be.
And many a wicked thing he’ll do
Because his heart is hard:
A great deal worse than killing you.
Poor kittens, in the yard.
TYRANNICAL PAT.
What became of tyrannical Pat,
Who pelted the dog, and beat the
cat.
Why, puss scratched his face, and
tore his hat;
And Dash knocked him over as
flat as a mat.
Mind that I
The little boy who hit his nails.
See here a naughty boy, John Thales,
Who had a shocking way
Of picking at his finger nails.
And biting them all day.
And though he had, like other boys.
Both soldiers, kites, and drums.
He liked, much better than these toys.
His fingers and his thumbs.
Boy who tore his hat.
Above on a chair, a little boy sat.
For he had torn his nice new hat;
And so was punished for doing that.
Thief Charley.
Charley, Charley, stole the barley.
Out of the baker’s shop;
The baker came out, and gave him a clout.
And made that Charley hop.


Girl who 'Wouldn’t go to Bed.
Once I knew a little girl.
Who wouldn’t go to bed.
And in the morning always had
A very sleepy head.
At night she’d stop upon the stairs.
And hold the railings tight.
Then with a puff she’d try to blow
Out Mary Ann’s rushlight.
The bed at last they tuck’d her in.
The light she vow’d to keep;
Left in the dark she roar’d and cried.
Till tired she went to sleep.
Little Girl that Beat her Sister.
Go, go, my naughty girl, and kiss
Your little sister dear;
I must not have such things as this.
Nor noisy quarrels here.
What! little children scold and fight
Who ought to be so mild;
Oh! Mary, ’tis a shocking sight
To see an angry child!
I can’t imagine, for my part.
The reason of your folly.
As if she did you any hurt
By playing with your dolly.
Children Should not Quarrel.
Let dogs delight to bark and bite.
For God hath made them so;
Let bears and lions growl and fight.
For ’tis their nature to.
But children you should never let I
Such angry passions rise;
Your little hands were never made
To tear each other’s eyes.
The Sulky Girl.
Why is Mary standing there.
Leaning down upon a chair.
With pouting lip and frowning brow ?
I wonder what’s the matter now.
Come here, my dear, and tell me true.
Is it because I spoke to you
About what you just now had done,
That you are such a naughty one ?
| Why, then, indeed, I’m grieved to see
| That you can so ill-tempered be;
i You make your fault a great deal worse
| By being sulky and perverse.
1 Oh ! how much better it appears,
1 To see you melting into tears,
| And then to hear you humbly say,
i “ I’ll not do so another day!”
The Little Girl that did not Like to he
Washed.
What! cry when I wash you! not love to be
1 clean 1
| There, go and be dirty, unfit te be seen;
And till you leave off, and I see you have
1 smiled.
I’ll not take the trouble to wash such a child.
NAUGHTY GIRLS.
The Girl who Sucked her Fingers.
A little girl, named Mary Kate,
Whom you may chance to see.
Would have been loved by small and great.
But for one thing, which I’ll relate;
So listen now to me.
A silly habit she’d acquired
Of putting in her mouth.
The pretty fingers of her hand.
And sucking them, for hours she’d stand.
In manner most uncouth.
Her play-companions used to laugh.
And jeeringly would say,
" Oh, pray bring Mary Kate some crumbs.
Poor thing ! she’s dining off her thumbs;
She'll eat them all away.”
Girl Stealing Treacle.
This is Nelly Pilfer;
I’ll tell you what she earned.
By stealing of the treacle
When Mary’s back was turned.
They caught the greedy Nelly
With treacle on her hand;
They put her in the comer,
And there they made her stand.
The Girl who soiled her Clothes.
Little Polly Flinders,
Sat among the cinders.
Warming her pretty little toes;
Her mother came and caught her,
And scolded her little daughter.
For spoiling her nice new clothes.
The Greedy Little GlrL
I knew a greedy little girl.
Who all day long did roar;
Whatever toys were given her.
She always wanted more.
Five dolls she had—one was black,
A ball and battledore.
But held them all so very tight.
Then roar’d and scream’d for more.
Now this was wicked of the child.
As everyone must own ;
So for the whole of one long day.
They shut her up alone.
The Girl Who Played With Fire.
Mamma, a little girl I met.
Had such a scar, I can’t forget!
All down her arms and neck and f ace j
I could not bear to see the place.
Poor little girl! and don’t you know
The shocking trick that made her so ?
’Twas all because she went and did
A thing her mother had forbid.
For once, when nobody was by her.
This silly child would play with fire;
And long before her mother came.
Her pinafore was all in flame.
In vain she tried to put it out.
Till all her clothes were burnt about;
And then she suffer’d ten times more.
All over with a dreadful sore.
For many months before ’twas cured.
Both day and night she pain endured;
And still you see, when passing by her,
How sad it is to play with fire.
Little Miss Consequence.
Little Hiss Consequence strutted about.
Turned up her nose, pointed her toes,
And thought herself quite a grand person, no
doubt.
Gave herself airs j took many cares.
To appear old; was haughty and cold.
She spoke to the servants like to dog ortocat
And fussed about this thing, and fussed
about that.
The Vulgar Little Lady.
" But, mamma, now,” said Charlotte,
" pray, don’t you believe
That I’m better than Jenny my nurse?
Only see my red shoes, and the lace
on my sleeve;
Her clothes are a thousand times worse,
" I ride in my coach, and have noth-
ing to do.
And the country folks stare at me so;
And nobody dares to control me but you.
Because I’m a lady, you know.
"Thenservants are vulgar and I am genteel,
So, really, ’tis out of the way.
To think that I should not bo better a deal
Than maids, and such people as they.”
" Gentility, Charlotte,” her mother replied;
" Belongs to no station or place;
And nothing’s so vulgar as folly and pride.
Though dressed in red slippers and lace.
"Not all the fine things that fine ladies possess
Should teach them the poor to despise;
For’tis in good manners, and notin good dress.
That the truest gentility lies.”


I Meddlesome Matty.
One ugly trick has often spoiled
The sweetest and the best;
Matilda, though a pleasant child
One ugly trick possessed,
Which, like a cloud before the skies.
Hid all her better qualities.
j Sometimes she’d lift the tea-pot lid,
! To peep at what was in it;
! Or tilt the kettle, if you did
j But turn your back a minute.
) In vain you told her not to touch—
) Her trick of meddling grew so much.
[ Her grandmamma went out one day,
I And by mistake she laid
l Her spectacles and snuff-box gay
( Too near the little maid;
i "Ah I well," thought she, " I’ll try them on,
i As soon as grandmamma is gone."
, Forthwith she placed upon her nose
i The glasses large and wide ;
i And looking round, as I suppose,
i The snuff-box too she spied:
1 “Oh! what a pretty box is that;
1 I’ll open it” said little Matt.
| “I know that grandmamma would say,
! ‘Don't meddle with it, dear;’
, But then, she’s far enough away.
And no one else is near;
Besides, what can there be amiss
In opening such a box as this?"
So thumb and finger went to work
' To move the stubborn lid ;
1 And presently a mighty jerk
The mighty mischief did;
For all at once, ah! woeful case.
The snuff came puffing in her face.
| Poor eyes, and nose, and mouth beside,
, A dismal sight presented;
In vain, as bitterly she cried.
Her folly she repented.
In vain, she ran about for ease:
She could do nothing now but sneeze.
She dashed the spectacles away.
To wipe her tingling eyes ;
And as in twenty bits they lay.
Her grandmamma she spies.
" Heyday 1 and what’s the matter now ?"
Says grandmamma, with lifted brow.
Matilda, smarting with the pain.
And tingling still, and sore,
Made many a promise to refrain
From meddling evermore.
And 'tis a fact, as I have heard,
She ever since has kept her word.
The Girl who Spilled the Ink.
“Oh! Lucy! Fanny! Make haste here I
Mamma will be so vexed, I fear.
For I’ve upset the Ink!
See, on my frock and pinafore.
Such great black stains! And there are mors
Upon my socks, I think,"
And Lucy cries, with open eyes.
And hands extended in surprise,
"Oh, naughty Mary Ann,
Those stains can never be washed out;
Whatever have you been about ?
Look at her, sister Fanl”
Mamma comes in" Heyday! what’s this t
Why, Mary Aim, I told you, Miss,
The Inkstand ne’er to move;
And little girls who won’t obey,
And mind each word their parents say,
Oood people ne’er will love."
The Naughty Girl.
A naughty girl had got no toy;
And didn't know what to do.
So she rumpled her frock.
And tore her sock,
And tried to eat her shoe.
The Girl who was always Tasting.
Little Miss Baster, of Sunnyside,
Was known os a taster, far and wide ;
Picking and licking, spying and prying.
Each bottle and dish with her finger trying.
Dangerous practice ! dreadful the fact is !
Once, almost poisoned, and very near dying.
Little Miss Baster, of Sunnyside,
Has got at some poison in paper tied ;
Harmless she deems it, yes, she must taste,
Like sugar seems it, ah! but ’tis paste,
llat’s-bane, the mixture. OI woe the day I
Run for the doctor, bid him not stay.
Dreadful her anguish—nearly she died,
Did Little Miss Baster, of Sunnyside.
Children Stealing Jam.
Four naughty little children thought
Some jam they’d try and steal;
But see how nicely they were caught
With a crash that made them squeal.
Their mother who was just next door.
And heard the horrid noise.
Came in and shook those naughty girls.
And whipp’d those naughty boys.
Sally, the Lazy Girl.
Her sister would come to the bedside and call,
“Doyou mean to sleep here all the day ?
I saw Kitty Miles up two hoars ago,
A-washing and workftig away.
" The water is boiling, the table is spread.
Your father is just at the door;
If you are not quick, we shall eat all the bread.
And you will not find any more.”
Then Sally sat up and half opened her eyes.
And gave both a grunt and a groan ;
“{I yawning, she said, in a quarrelsome voice,
I wish you would let me alone."
But though she was lazy, she always could eat.
And wished for a plentiful share.
So tumbled her clothes on, and smeared
her white face.
Forgetting her hands and her hair.
Her frock was all crumpled and twisted
away.
Her hair was entangled and wild.
Her stockings were down, and her shoes
were untied.
She looked a most slovenly child.
She sauntered about till the old village
clock
Had sounded and then died away,
Before she put on her tom bonnet and went
To school without further delay.
But soon as she came to the little cake shop,
She loitered with lingering eyes.
Just wishing that she had a penny to spend.
For one of the pretty jam pies.
Again she went on and she loitered again.
In the same foolish way as before.
And the clock in the school was just warn-
ing for ten.
As she lifted the latch of the door.
The governess frowned as she went to her
place.
She had spoken so often in vain.
And now only said with a sorrowful sigh,
“ There’s Sally the latest again 1"
She hated her reading and never would
write.
She neither could cipher nor sew,
And little girls whispered, “We never will
So silly as Miss Sally Slow." [be
Girl who Wouldn’t Comb her Hair.
I tell you of a little girl, who would
herself have been
As pretty a young lady as ever could bo
seen.
But that about her little head she had no
cleanly care.
And never, never could be made to brush
and comb her hair.
She would have been a pretty child,
But Oh, she was a fright—
She looked just like a girl that’s wild.
Yes quite as ugly, quite;
She looked just like a girl that’s wild
A frightful ugly sight.
The Nasty, Cross Girls.
The school was closed one afternoon.
And all the girls were gone ;
Some walked away in company;
And some walked on alone.
Some plucked the flowers upon the banks.
Some chattered very fast.
And some were talking secretly.
And whispered as you passed.
And if, perchance, a girl came near,
Then one of these would say, ,
" Don’t listen to our secrets. Miss, (
You’ll please to go away."
As Nelly White ran home from school.
Her work-bag in her hand.
She chanced to pass near Lucy Bell,
And her friend Susan Brand. ,
•• We don’t want you,” said Lucy Bell, 1
•* You little tiresome chit; 1
Our secrets are not meant for yon, <
You little Tell-tale-tit." i
Then both the girls cried " Tell-tale-tit,” 1
And pushed her roughly by ;
Poor Nelly said " I’m no such thing,' 1
And then began to cry. 1


Notice to the Public.
If a schoolmistress chooses to live a hundred ora thousand miles away from her school, she can use the Scolding Machine by means of a Teltphont attached thereto.
One great advantage of the Electro-micro Scolding Machine is, that after it has been in use a short time the girls will all have been shamed into good behaviour ; but
the Machine will not become useless, as it can, without afarthiug outlay, be turned into a Praising Machine, for it can be made to praise in a gentle voice as well as
scold in a harsh one. In fact, as said above, it will repeat in exact tones, anything that is recited, preached, sung, whistled, whispered, shouted, scolded or praised
into it—and any of which will be heard for forty miles around.
Cole can supply Scolding Machines from £5 to £5O. A very good one (the Excelsior), price £lO, oan be charged in one minute, and set going like a musical box,
and will sing, whistle, recite, preach or scold away for fully an hour without stopping.—Cols would particularly recommend this one to the ladies, it would
make a fine ornament for their own table.
Final Notice Extraordinary .—lf the champion male scold of the world, and the champion female scold of the world, will call on Professor Cole, at the Book Arcade,
Melbourne, he will give them both good wages, and find them constant employment at charging Scolding Machines. If any wife has got the champion male scold
for a husband, she will please to let me know. If any husband has got the champion female scold for a wife, he would please to let me know.—£lo bonus (or in-
formaut in each case.— E. W. COLE.
COLE’S ELECTRO-MICRO SCOLDING MACHINE FOR SCOLDING NAUGHTY GIRLS.
Cole’s Electro-micro Scolding Machine is a com-
bination of three instruments, the Pliunograpll,
the Microphone, and the Wonderphone.
The Phonograph is an instrument that will
preserve words for any length of time. Any person
can speak, sing, whistle or scold into a Phonograph,
and months or years afterwards by simply turning
a handle the same sounds can be reproduced a dozen,
a hundred, or a thousand times in the exact voice
of the person who spoke them in; so that if a man
or woman, who is a great scold, speak some good,
loud, severe scolding into a Phonograph, the mildest
teacher can then soundly scold her pupils, or the
kindest mother her children, by just turning the
handle.
The Microphone is an instrument that magni-
fies sound in the same way as a microscope magni-
fies objects; a very powerful microphone magnifies
the sound of a fly walking into a loud tramping
footstep, the tick of a watch into a deafening clatter,
and a whisper into a loud shout. Take a Micro-
Shone, then properly affix it to the Phonograph
escribed above, and you have a good Scolding
Machine; turn the handle, and as the Phonograph
fives out the scoldings, the microphone part magni-
es them so loud that they are heard for a consider-
able distance.
The Wonderphone (Cole’s own secret) is
another remarkable instrument ;it will cause sound
to travel very distinctly, but frightfully and equally
loud, for forty miles in all directions ; by attaching
this powerful instrument to the combination of the
other two. Cole’s Electro-micro Scolding Machine
is formed—and which is the first Scolding Machine
ever invented. If the machine is already charged
by having had some scolding spoken, or even
whispered into it, give the handle a turn, and forty
miles to the east, forty to the west, forty to the
north, forty to the south, forty up in the sky, and
down in mines forty miles deep, in fact forty miles
in every direction, everybody can clearly hear every
word that is said to the girl being scolded. Suppose
for instance, Hannah Maria Smith had done some-
thing wrong in school, the schoolmistress could
give the handle of the machine a turn, and it would
scold her so loud that her mother, and father, and
brothers, and sisters, and uncles, and aunts, and
friends, and those she didn’t like, would all hear her
scolded. The machine can be charged on the instant
by anyone scolding into it. In fact the whole value
of Cole’s Scolding Machine lies in its power to
repeat out exceedingly loud whatever is spoken
into it.
If the schoolmistress chooses she can put the
scolding into verse, so that all who hear it in the
forty miles around, can more easily remember it.
The machine that I have before me now, was
charged this morning for an aristocratic school,
and speaks as follows : —Silence! 1 Attention 111

Sneer at the boy’s new Whipping Machine.


Boy who Told a Lie.
The mother looked pale, and her face was sad;
She seemed to have nothing to make her glad:
Silent she sat, with the tears in her eye.
For her dear little boy had told a lie.
He was a loving and gentle child.
His way was winning, his temper was mild;
There was love and joy in his soft blue eye:
But the dear little boy had told a lie.
He stood alone, by the window within.
For he felt that his soul was stained with sin;
And his mother could hear him sob and cry.
Because he had told her that wicked lie.
Then he came, and stood by his mother’s side.
And asked for a kiss, which she denied;
So he made a promise, with many a sigh.
Which he kept, and never again told a lie.
I will tell the Truth.
“ 0 dear, that stray unlucky ball I
I wish I had not play* d at all”
Cried little careless Will;
" How can I to papa explain
The mystery of this broken pane.
And keep my credit still P
I’ll say it was some random stone,
B ysome one o’er the pailings thrown.
That struck the brittle glass;
Or else persuade him that I saw
The puppy break it with his paw.
And scamper through the grass.
“But stop;—l must not tell a lie;
For, though unseen by other eye,
God will the sin record;
’Tis better, all the truth confess
And frankly own my carelessness,
Than thus offend the Lord.
“Papa will frown, mamma will chide
My usual pence will be denied.
Yet, let me dare be true;
’Tis better, I am very sure.
Their anger for one fault endure.
Than lie, and make it two.
“ Although I would their anger soothe.
I’ll tell the plain and simple truth.
And sneaking lies disdain;
I’ll seek papa this very hour.
Tell him the mischief I deplore.
And own the broken pane.’*
A Quiet Conscience.
How pleasant it is at the end of the
day.
No follies to have to repent.
But reflect on the past, and be able to say.
That my time has been properly spent.
When I’re done all my work with patience
and care.
Been truthful, obliging, and kind,
I lie on my pillow, and sleep away there.
With a happy and peaceable mind.
But instead of all this, it must be confessed.
If deceitful or idle I’ve been,
I lie down as usual and go to my rest.
But feel discontented within.
Then as I am grieved at the trouble I’ve had.
In future I’ll try to prevent it;
For I never am naughty without being sad,
Or good without being contented.
GOOD BOYS.
The Truthful Boy.
Once there was a little boy
With curly hair and pleasant eye,
A boy who always told the truth.
And never, never told a lie;
And when he trotted off to school
The children all about would cry,
“ There goes the curly-headed boy,
The boy who never tells a lie.”
Everybody loved him so.
Because he always told the truth.
That every day as he grew up, [youth;”
’Twas said “ There goes the honest
And when the people that stood near
Would turn and ask the reason why.
The answer would be always this,
“ Because he never tells a lie.”
Washington, the Truthful Boy.
Mb. Washington had given his little son
a hatchet, and the boy had carelessly tried
its sharpness upon a young cherry tree,
that his father valued very much. The
bark was injured, and Mr. Washington,
when he found it out, was seriously dis-
pleased, and began to question the servants
as to who had done it. “ I did it, father,” said
George, holding out the greatly prized
hatchet, which he knew he must forfeit for
his folly. “ I did it with my new hatchet,
which you gave me,” “ Come into my arms,
brave boy,” said his father. “I would rather
every tree I possess be killed, than that you
should deceive me.”
I Must be Honest.
"No one will see me,” said little John Day,
For his father and mother were out of the way
And he was at home all alone;
“ No one will see,” so he climb’d on a chair.
And peep’d in the cupboard to spy what was
there.
Which, of course he ought not to have done.
There stood in the cupboard, so sweet and
so nice,
A plate of plum-cake in full many a slice.
And apples so ripe and so fine;
“Now no one will see me,” said John to
himself.
As he stretch’d out his arm to reach up to
the shelf;
“This apple at least shall be mine.”
John paused, and put back the nice
apple so red.
For he thought of the words his kind
mother had said.
When she left all these things in his
care;
“And no one will see me,” thought
he, “ is not true;
For I’ve read that God sees us in all
that we do.
And is with us everywhere.’*
Well done, John; your father and
mother obey.
Try ever to please them, and mind
what they say.
Ever when they are absent from you;
And never forget, that, though no
one be nigh.
You cannot be hid from the glance
of God’s eye,
, Who notices all that you do.
I must do Right.
I’ve been told, and now I know.
Though the pangs of want I feel.
That to take what is not mine—
Much or little—is to steal.
I’ve been told, and now I know.
What I say that is not true
Is a lie, though told in play, ,
And may lead to telling two. i
I’ve been told, and now I know, j
That I shall commit a sin
If I tell a single lie.
Or if I take a single pin.
I must not Waste
I must not throw upon the floor.
The food I cannot eat;
For many a hungry little one
Would think it quite a treat.
Tis “wilful waste brings woeful want’
And I may live to say.
Oh ! how I wish I had the bread.
Which once I threw away.
Tlie Golden Rule.
To do to others as I would.
That they should do to me.
Will make me honest; kind and good.
As children ought to be. ,


Dutiful Jem.
There was a poor widow, who lived in a cot;
She scarcely a blanket to warm her had got;
Her windows were broken, her walls were
And the cold winter wind often whistled in
there.
) Poor Susan was old, and too feeble to spin ;
) Her forehead was wrinkled, her hands they
were thin;
( And bread she’d have wanted, as many
have done,
i If she had not been blessed with a good
( little son.
) But he loved her so well, like a dutiful lad,
) And thought her the very best friend that
he had;
That now to neglect or forsake her,
he knew.
Was the most wicked thing he could
possibly do.
For he was quite healthy, and active,
and stout.
While his poor mother hardly could
hobble about;
And he felt it his duty and greatest
delight
To work for her living from morning
till night.
So he started each morning as gay
as a lark.
And worked all day long in the fields
till ’twas dark ;
Then came home again to his dear
mother’s cot.
And cheerfully gave her the wages
he got.
And oh, how she loved him! how
great was her joy
To think her dear Jem was a dutiful
boy!
Her arm round his neck she would
tenderly cast.
And kiss his red cheek, while the
tears trickled fast.
Oh, then, was not little Jem happier
far
Than naughty, and idle, and foolish
boys are ?
For as long as he lived ’twas his
comfort and joy
To think he’d not been an undutiful
boy.
The Good-natured Boy.
“ Oh ! I’ve gotaplum-cake, and a feast let ns
make;
Come, schoolfellows, come at my call;
I assure you ’tis nice, and we’ll each have a
slice,
Here’s more than enough for us all.”
Thus said little Jack, as he gave it a smack.
And sharpened his knife to begin;
Nor was there one found upon the play-
ground.
So cross that he would not come in.
With masterly strength he cut through it
at length.
And gave to each playmate a share;
Charles, William, and James, and many
more names.
Partook his benevolent care.
And when it was done, and they’d finished
their fun.
To marbles or hoop they went back ;
And each little boy felt it always a joy
To do a good turn for good Jack.
In his task and his book, his best pleasures
he took;
And as he thus wisely began.
Since he’s been a man grown, he has con-
stantly shown.
That a good boy will make a good man.
The Good-natured Girls.
Two good little girls, named Mary and Ann,
Both happily lived, as good girls always can;
And tho’ they were not either sullen or mute.
They seldom or never were heard to dispute.
Casabianca, the Heroic Boy.
The boy stood on the burning deck.
Whence all but he had fled;
The flame that lit the battle’s wreck
Shone round him o’er the dead;
Yet beautiful and bright he stood
As born to rule the storm;
A creature of heroic blood,
A proud though child-like form!
The flames rolled on—he would not go
Without his father’s word;
That father, faint in death below.
His voice no longer heard.
He called aloud —“ Say, father, say.
If yet my task is done !”
He knew not that the chieftain lay
Unconscious of his son.
“ Speak, father!” once again he cried,
“ If I may yet be gone !
And”—but the booming shots replied.
And fast the flames rolled on.
Upon his brow he felt their breath.
And in his waving hair;
And looked from that lone post to death
In still, yet brave despair!
He shouted yet once more aloud,
“My father ! must I stay ?”
While o’er him fast, through sail and shroud.
The wreathing fires made way:
They wrapped the ship in splendour wild.
They caught the flag on high.
And streamed above the gallant child.
Like banners in the sky.
Then came a burst of thunder sound.
The boy—Oh ! where was he ?
Ask of the winds, that far around
With fragments strewed the sea.
With mast and helm and pennon fair.
That well had borne their part—
But the noblest thing that perished
there.
Was that young faithful heart.
Boys who Loved their Parents.
During an eruption of Mount iEtna,
many years since, the danger it oc-
casioned to the inhabitants of the
adjacent country became very im-
minent, and the flames flying about,
they were obliged to retire to a
greater distance. Amidst the hurry
and confusion of such a scene (every
one flying and carrying away what-
ever they deemed most precious) two
sons, the one named Anapias, the
other Amphinomus, in the height
of their solicitude for the preser-
vation of their wealth and goods,
recollected their father and mether,
who, being both very old, were un-
able to save themselves by flight.
Filial tenderness set aside every other
consideration; and, “ Where (cried
the generous youths) shall we find
a more precious treasure than those
who begat and gave us being ?” This
said, the one took up his father on
his shoulders, the other his mother,
and so made their way through the
surrounding smoke and flames. The
fact struck all beholders with the
highest admiration; and they aad
their posterity ever after called the path
they took in their retreat, “The Field of
the Pious,” in memory of this pleasing
incident.
I must not Tease my Mother.
I must not tease my mother.
For she is very kind;
And everything she says to me
I must directly mind;
For when I was a baby.
And could not speak or walk.
She let me in her bosom sleep.
And taught me how to talk.
My mother, my dear mother.
Oh may I never be i
Unkind or disobedient.
In any way, to thee.


/ Jenny Lee.
An orphan child was Jenny Lee ;
Her father, he was dead;
And very hard her mother worked.
To get the children bread.
1 In winter time, she often rose
Long ere the day was light,
| And left her orphan family.
Till dark again at night.
And she would always say to Jane,
Before she went away:
"Be sure you mind the little ones,
i And don’t go out to play.
I "Keep baby quiet in his bed,
I As long as he will lie;
• Then take him up, and dance him well,
1 Don’t leave him there to cry.
i "And don’t let little Christopher,
1 Get down into the street,
| For fear he meets an accident
Beneath the horse’s feet.
| " And mind about the fire, child.
And keep a tidy floor;
We never need be dirty, Jane,
Although we may be poor.
| “Good-bye, my precious comforter.
For all the neighbours say.
That I can trust my little maid.
Whenever I’m away.”
Then Jenny she was quite as proud
As England’s noble Queen,
And she resolved to do the work.
And keep the dwelling clean.
She did not stop to waste her time.
But very brisk was she.
And worked as hard and cheerfully
As any busy bee.
If down upon the cottage floor
Her little brother fell.
She stroked the places tenderly,
■ And kissed and made them well.
And when the little babe was cross.
As little babes will be.
She nursed and danced it merrily.
And fed it on her knee.
But when they both were safe in bed.
She neatly swept the hearth.
And waited till her mother’s step
Came sounding up the path.
Then open flew the cottage door.
The weary mother smiled;
" Ah ! Jenny dear, what should I do.
Without my precious child!”
Work Before Play.
“ Mother has sent me to the well.
To fetch a jug of water.
And I am very glad to be
A useful little daughter;
And that is why I cannot play
With you and Mary Ann to-day.
" Some afternoon I’ll come with you.
And make you wreaths and posies;
I know a place where blue-bells grow.
And daisies and primroses;
But not to-day, for I must go [know.
And help my mother, dears, you
GOOD GIRLS.
" She says, that I am nearly eight.
So I can fill the kettle.
And sweep the room and clean the grate,
And even scrub a little ;
Oh! I’m so very glad to be
A little useful girl, you see.
" So, Johnny, do not ask to-day—
Perhaps I’ll come to-morrow;
But you’d not wish me now to stay.
And give my mother sorrow.
When she can spare me, she will say,
‘Now, Susan, you may go and play.’”
Lucy Gray.
Oft I had heard of Lucy Gray;
And, when I crossed the wild,
I chanced to see at break of day
The solitary child.
No mate, no comrade Lucy knew;
She dwelt on a wide moor, —
The sweetest thing that ever grew
Beside a human door!
You yet may spy the fawn at play.
The hare upon the green;
But the sweet face of Lucy Gray
Will never more be seen.
“ To-night will be a stormy night—
You to the town must go;
And take a lantern. Child, to light
Your mother through the snow.”
“That, Father, will I gladly do!
’Tis scarcely afternoon—
The minster-clock has just struck two.
And yonder is the moon.”
At this the father raised his hook
And snapped a faggot band ;
He plied his work; —and Lucy took
The lantern in her hand.
Not blither is the mountain roe:
With many a wanton stroke
Her feet disperse the powdery snow.
That rises up like smoke.
The storm came on before its time;
She wandered up and down;
And many a hill did Lucy climb.
But never reached the town.
The wretched parents all that night
Went shouting far and wide;
But there was neither sound nor sight
To serve them for a guide.
At day-break on a hill they stood
That overlooked the moor;
And thence they saw the bridge of wood
A furlong from their door.
And, turning homeward, now they
ci’ied,
" In heaven we all shall meet!”
When in the snow the mother spied
The print of Lucy’s feet.
Then downward from the steep hill’s
edge
They tracked the footmarks small;
And through the broken hawthorn
hedge.
And by the long stone wall.
And then an open field they crossed—
The marks were still the same;
They tracked them on, nor ever lost;
And to the bridge they came.
They followed from the sn«>wy bank
The footmarks, one by one.
Into the middle of the plank;
And furthur there were none !
Yet some maintain that to this day
She is a living child;
That you may see sweet Lucy Gray
Upon the lonesome wild.
O ’er rough and smooth she trips along.
And never looks behind;
And sings a solitary song
That whistles in the wind.
Mary’s Little Lamli.
Mary had a little lamb.
His fleece was white as snow;
And everywhere that Mary went
The lamb was sure to go.
He followed her to school one day—
That was against the rule;
It made the children laugh and play.
To see a lamb at sch®ol.
The teacher therefore turned him out;
But still he lingered near.
And on the grass he played about
Till Mary did appear.
At once he ran to her, and laid ,
His head upon her arm, i
As if to say, I’m not afraid —
You’ll keep me from all harm.
“Whatmakesthe lamb love Mary so?” i
The little children cry : 1
"Oh! Mary loves the lamb you know,” 1
The teacher did reply.


“We are Seven.”
I met a little cottage girl;
She was eight years old, she said;
Her hair was thick with many a curl
That clustered round her head.
She had a rustic, woodland air.
And she was wildly clad ;
Her eyes were fair, and very fair.
Her beauty made me glad.
“ Sisters and brothers, little maid,
How many may you be?”
“How many ? Seven in all,” she said.
And, wondering, looked at me.
“And where are they ? I pray you tell.”
She answered, “ Seven are we;
And two of us at Conway dwell.
And two are gone to sea.
“ Two of us in the churchyard lie —
My sister and my brother;
And in the churchyard cottage I
Dwell near them with my mother.”
“You say that two at Conway dwell.
And two are gone t© sea;
Yet ye are seven! I pray you tell.
Sweet maid, how this may be ?”
Then did the little maid reply,
“ Seven boys and girls are we ;
Two of us in the churchyard lie.
Beneath the churchyard tree.”
“ You run about, my little maid.
Your limbs they are alive !
If two are in the churchyard laid.
Then ye are only five.”
“ Their graves are green, they may bo
seen,”
The little maid replied;
“Twelve steps or more, from my
mother’s door.
And they are side by side.
“My stockings there I often knit.
My kerchief there I hem;
And there upon the ground I sit,
I sit and sing to them.
“And often after sunset, sir.
When it is light and fair,
I take my little porringer.
And eat my supper there.
“The first that died was little Jane;
In bed she moaning lay.
Till God released her of her pain.
And then she went away.
“ So in the churchyard she was laid;
And, when the grass was dry.
Together round her grave we played.
My brother John and I.
"And when the ground was white with
snow.
And I could run and slide.
My brother John was forced to go,
And he lies by her side.”
“ How many are you then,” said I,
“If they two are in heaven ?”
The little maiden did reply,
“ O master! we are seven.”
“ But they are dead; those two are dead;
Their spirits are in heaven !”
’Twas throwing words away; for still
The little maid would have her will.
And said, “Nay, we are seven.”
The Poor, but Kind Girl.
Young Lucy Payne lives on the Village Green;
Mary, you know the cottage, I am sure.
Under the hawthorn ! ’Tis so neat and clean.
Though Widow Payne, alas! is blind and poor.
She plies her needles, and she plies them well.
And Lucy never spends an idle hour;
On market days their mits and socks they sell.
And thus their balls of worsted turn to flour.
I pass’d one morning by their cottage door;
Lucy was talking to a little child,
A ragged thing that lives upon the moor;
Its parents leave it to run rude and wild.
Hunger had tamed the little wilding thing.
Its cheeks were hollow, but its air was light;
Young Lucy did not know I saw her bring
That porringer she kept so clean and bright.
It was her breakfast—all the darling had;
But oh! she gave it with a heart so glad.
Grace Darling.
“ Over the wave, the stormy wave.
Hasten, dear father, with me.
The crew to save from the wat’ry grave.
Deep in the merciless sea.
Hear ye the shriek, the piercing shriek.
Hear ye the cry of despair ?
With courage quick the wreck we’ll seek;
Danger united we’ll dare.
“ Out with the boat, the gallant boat;
Not a moment to be lost;
See! she’s afloat, proudly afloat.
And high on the waves we're tossed;
Mother, adieu, a short adieu;
Your prayers will rise to heaven;
Father, to you—your child and you—
Power to save is given.
“ I have no fear, no maiden fear;
My heart is firm to the deed,
I shed no tear, no coward tear;
I’ve strength in the time of need.
Heard ye the crash, the horrid crash ?
Their mast over the side is gone;
Yet on we dash, ’mid lightning flash.
Safe, through the pelting storm.
“ The wreck we near, the wreck we near
Our bonny boat seems to fly;
List to the cheer, their welcome cheer.
They know that succour is nigh.”
And on that night, that dreadful night.
The father and daughter brave,
W ith strengthened might they both unite.
And many dear lives they save.
Hail to the maid, the fearless maid.
The maid of matchless worth;
She’ll e’er abide the cherished pride
Of the land that gave her birth.
They send her gold, her name high
uphold.
Honour and praise to impart;
i But, with true regard, the loved reward
Is the joy of her own brave heart.
The Tidy Girl.
Who is it each day in the week may
1 be seen.
With her hair short and smooth, and
her hands and face clean;
In a stout cotton gown, of dark and
light blue.
Though old, so well mended, you'd
take it for new;
Her handkerchief tidily pinned o’er
her neck.
With a neat little cap, and an apron of
check;
Her shoes and her stockings all
sound and all clean P
She’s never fine outside, and dirty
within.
Go visit her cottage : though humble
and poor,
’Tis so neat and so clean, you might
eat off the floor;
No rubbish, no cobwebs, no dirt can
be found.
Though you hunt every corner, and
search all around.
Who sweeps it so nicely, who makes,
all the bread.
Who tends her sick mother, and
works by her bed ?
’Tis the neat, tidy girl—she needs no [
other name: i
Abroad, or at home, she is always the
same.
1 Will lie Good To-Day.
11 1 will be good, dear mother,”
I heard a sweet child say ;
** I will be good; now watch me—
I will be good all day."
Oh, many, many, bitter tears
'Twould save us, did we say.
Like that dear child, with earnest heart,
“ I will be good to day."
Wy Own Dear Little Sister.
I have a little sister,
She’s only three years old ;
I do most dearly love her.
She’s worth her weight in gold.
We often play together
And I begin to find,
To make my sister happy,
I must bo very kind.

BEAUTIFUL GEMS OF POETRY.
My Girl.
A little corner with its crib,
A little mug, a spoon, a bib,
A little tooth so pearly white,
A little rubber-ring to bite.
A little plate all lettered round,
A little rattle to resound,
A little creeping—see! she stands!
A little step ’twixt outstretched hands.
A little doll with flaxen hair,
A little willow rocking-chair,
A little dress of richest hue,
A little pair of gaiters blue.
A little school day after day,
A little “ schoolma’am” to obey,
A little study—soon ’tis past—
A little graduate at last.
A little muff for wintry weather,
A little jockey-hat and feather,
A little sac with funny pockets,
A little chain, a ring, and lockets.
A little while to dance and bow,
A little escort homeward now,
A little party somewhat late,
A little lingering at the gate.
A little walk in leafy June,
A little talk while shines the moon,
A little reference to papa,
A little planning with mamma.
A little ceremony grave,
A little struggle to be brave,
A little cottage on a lawn,
A little kiss—my girl was gone!
Little Tommy, or The Blow.
“ O neighbour, I’m so frighten’d.
Poor little Tommy’s hurt;
He came in where the clean clothes lay.
All over mess and dirt.
“ He would not mind me when I spoke.
And toss’d the things about.
Iron’d and folded as they were.
And sorted to send out.
“ And he was saucy when I spoke.
And said what he ought not;
Unluckily a stick was near—
You know my temper’s hot.
I struck at him a sharp quick blow.
It chanc’d upon his head;
I can’t believe it while I speak.
He fell down ••••like one dead.
“ He’s better no", but do come in,
I’m very sad at heart;
It seems to me there’s something wrong.
More than the pain and smart.”
The child lay \tfith a dreary look.
And an unmeaning j*aze;
The doctor came and did his best,
, But there he lay for days.
The blow has hurt the tender brain—
Poor little naughty child!
It was a punishment too sharp;
Try, mothers, to be mild.
Not word and blow with thoughtless haste.
And then this bitter grief—
A malady that none can reach.
No doctors give relief.
And never strike a young child’s head.
That tender part the brain
Is slightly cover’d, and if hurt.
May never heal again.
Poor little Tommy! now he lies
A little idiot boy;
And no one knows what he may feel
Of suffering or of joy.
He meets his mother’s anxious gaze
With calm unmeaning smile;
And little knows the agony
That wrings her heart the while.
Poor mother, in your patient love
You’re never hasty now.
And tears and kisses shower down
Upon his fair young brow.
The Wife to her Husband.
You took me, William, when a girl, unto
your home and heart.
To bear in all your after-fate a fond and
faithful part;
And tell me, have I ever tried that duty to
forego.
Or pined there was not joy for me when
you were sunk in woe ?
No; I would rather share your tear than
any other’s glee.
For though you’re nothing to the world,
you’re all the world to me.
You make a palace of my shed, this rough-
hewn bench a throne;
There’s sunlight for me in your smiles, and
music in your tone.
I look upon you when you sleep—my eyes
with tears grow dim,
I ory, “Oh Parent of the Poor,look down
from heaven on him;
Behold him toil from day to day, exhausting
strength and soul;
Oh look with mercy on him. Lord, for thou
can’st make him whole !”
And when at last relieving sleep has on my
eyelids smiled.
How oft are they forbade to close in slumber
by our child?
I take the little murmurer that spoils my
span of rest.
And feel it is a part of thee I lull upon my
breast.
There’s only one return I crave, I may not
need it long.
And it may soothe thee when I’m where
the wretched feel no wrong.
I ask not for a kinder tone, for thou wert
ever kind;
I ask not for less frugal fare, my fare I do
not mind;
I ask not for attire more gay —if such as I
have got
Suffice to make me fair to thee, for more I
murmur not.
But I would ask some share of hours that
you on clubs bestow.
Of knowledge which you prize so much,
might I not something know?
Substract from meetings amongst men eacb
eve an hour for me;
Make me companion of your soul, as I may
safely be.
If you will read. I’ll sit and work; then
think when you’re away;
Less tedious I shall find the time, de w
William, of your stay.
A meet companion soon I’ll be for e’en your
studious hours.
And teacher of those little ones you call
your cottage flowers;
And if we be not rich and great, we may be
wise and kind.
And as my heart can warm your heart, so
may my mind your mind.
Beautiful Snow,
Oh ! the snow, the beautiful snow,
Filling the sky and the earth below; ,
Over the housetops, over the street, i
Over the heads of the people you meet.
Dancing, flu-ting, skimming along ;
Beautiful snow ! it can do nothing wrong;
Flying to kiss a fair lady’s cheek,
Clinging to lips in a frolicsome freak ;
Beautiful snow from the Heavens above.
Pure as an angel, gentle as love !
Oh 1 the snow, the beautiful snow.
How the flakes gather and laugh as they go,
Whirling about in their maddening fun.
It plays in its glee with every one—
Chasing, laughing, hurrying by.
It lights on the face and sparkles the eye, I
And the dogs, with a bark and a bound.
Snap at the crystals that eddy around—
The town is alive and its heart’s in a glow
To welcome the coming of beautiful snow. !
How wildly the crowd goes swaying along.
Hailing each other with humour and song 1
How the gay sledges like meteors flash by.
Bright for a moment then lost to the eye ; |
Kinging, swinging, dashing they go.
Over the crust of the beautiful snow—
Snow so pure when it falls from the sky, 1
As to make one regret to see it lie, [feet'
To be trampled and tracked by the thousands of
Till it blends with the filth in the horrible street.
Once I was pure as the snow, but I fell, ;
Fell like the snow flakes from Heaven to hell; ,
Fell to be trampled as filth in the street j
Fell to be scoffed, to be spit on and beat.
Pleading, cursing, dreading to die.
Selling my soul to whoever would buy ;
Dealing in shame for a morsel of bread.
Hating the living and fearing the dead.
Merciful God ! have I fallen so low ?
And yet I was once like the beautiful snow I
Once I was fair as the beautiful snow.
With an eye like its crystal, a heart like its glow ;
Once I was loved for my innocent grace —
Flattered and sought for the charms of my face;
Father, mother, sister, and all,
God, and myself, I have lost by my fall!
The veriest wretch that goes shivering by
Will make a wide swoop, lest I wander too nigh ;
For all that is on or above me, I know.
There’s nothing so pure as the beautiful snow.
How strange it should be that this beautiful snow
Should fall on a sinner with nowhere to go; _ |
How strange it should be, when night comes again.
If the snow and the ice struck my desperate brain 1'
Fainting, freezing, dying alone, <
Too wicked for prayer, too weak for a moan.
To be heard in the streets of the crazy town! S
Gone mad in the joy of the snow coming down; S
To be and to die in my terrible woe, )
With a bed and a shroud of the beautiful snow. )
Helpless and foul as the trampled snow, )
Sinner, despair not! Christ stoopeth low ?
To rescue the soul that is lost in its sin, ?
And raise it to life and enjoyment again. c
Groaning, bleeding, dying for thee, (
The Crucified hung on the accursed tree ; (
His accents of mercy fell soft on thine ear, [prayer ?(
Is there mercy for me? will he heed my weak\
Oh God !in the stream that for sinners did flow, 1
Wash me, and I shall bo whiter than snow. /


A FUTURE LIFE.
Hamlet’s Soliloquy.
To be, or not to be—that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles.
And, by opposing, end them ?—To die—to
sleep;—
No more ; and, by a sleep, to say we end
The heart-ache, and the thousand natural
shocks
That flesh is heir to, —’tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wished. To die; —to sleep;—
To sleep ! perchance to dream; ay there’s the
rub;
For in that sleep of death what dreams may
come.
When we have shuffled off this mortal ceil.
Must give us pause; there’s the respect
That makes calamity of so long life ;
For who will bear the whips and scorns of
time.
The oppressor’s wrong, the proud man’s
contumely.
The pangs of despis’d love, the law’s delay.
The insolence of office, and the spurns
That patient merit of the unworthy takes.
When he himself might his quietus make
With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear.
To grunt and sweat under a weary life;
But that the dread of something after death.
The undiscovered country, from whose bourn
No traveller returns, —puzzles the will,
And makes us rather bear those ills we have.
Than fly to others that we know not of.
The Indian’s Idea of Heaven.
Lo, the poor Indian! whose untutored
mind
Sees God in clouds, or hears Him in the
wind ;
His soul, proud science never taught to stray
Far as the solar walk, or milky way;
Yet simple nature to his hope has giv’n.
Behind the cloud-top’t hill, an humbler
heav’n;
Some safer world in depths of wood em-
braced.
Some happier island in the watery waste.
Where slaves once more their native land
behold,
| No fiends torment, no Christians thirst for
, gold.
1 To be, contents his natural desire,
1 He asks no angel’s wing, no seraph’s fire;
* But thinks, admitted to that equal sky,
I His faithful dog shall bear him company.
The Land of Love.
There is a land of love,
> Where every wind breathes soft, and glad,
j and free;
) And every silvery, rippling stream exhales
j Heart-joyous melody.
There sweetest, fairest flowers
Ope their love-tinted petals to the sun.
And gently breathe their ravishing perfume
The wayworn heart upon.
No burning sorrows there;
No broken,bleeding hearts can there abide.
No silent, yearning, unrequited love;
' All, all are satisfied.
Orer There.
Oh, the spacious grand plantation.
Over there!
Shining like a constellation.
Over there!
Holy with a consecration.
From all tears and tribulation.
From all crime and grief and care.
To all uses good and fair.
Over there!
Always brooding warm and golden.
Shines the mellow sunshine olden.
Over there!
Never blighting shadow passes
O’er the silken, star-eyed grasses,
Waving wide their flowing hair
In the clear, translucent air.
Over there!
Oh, the grand encamping mountains.
Over there!
Oh, the sheeny, spouting fountains,
Over there!
Oh, the boundless starlit arches.
Where the sun in glory marches,
On a road forever tending
Through bright legion worlds unending.
Over there !
Brilliant blossoms breathe and burn.
Over there!
Nectar drunken drops the fern
By the tulip’s early urn.
Over there!
Orange-buds and passion-flowers
Lattice sweet hymeneal bowers.
Over there!
All the heavenly creatures born
Of the breeze, the dew, the morn,
In the divinest beauty grow.
Drape their purple, drift their snow,
Don their crimson, sheen their gold.
Shed their odors manifold
On the palpitating air.
On the flower-laden air.
Over there!
Oh, the royal forests growing.
Over there!
Breath of balsam ever flowing,
Over there!
Pine trees sing their breezy chime.
Palm-trees lift their plumy prime
In the ever Eden time.
Over there!
And a passionate perfume
Fills the deep delicious gloom;
While through forest arcades ringing.
Lustrous birds are floating, singing.
Over there!
No salt tears the ground are drenching.
Over there!
Faint with toil no thin forms blenching.
Over there!
No more burdend backs are aching;
No more hearts are breaking, breaking,
Over there!
No more lifted hands outreaching
With a frantical beseeching;
No more desperate endeavors ;
No more separating evers,
No more desolating nevers.
Over there! Over there!
The Better Land.
‘ I hear thee speak of the better land.
Thou call’st its children a happy band;
Mother! oh where is that radiant shore —
Shall we not seek it, and weep no more?
Is it where the flower of the orange blows.
And the fireflies glance through the myrtle
boughs ? ’
—‘Not there, not there, my child!*
‘ls it where the feathery palm-trees rise.
And the date grows ripe under sunny skies;
Or ’midst the green islands of glittering seas.
Where fragrant forests perfume the breeze;
And strange bright birds, on their starry
wings.
Bear the rich hues of all glorious things?’
' Not there,not there, my child!’
' Is it far away in some region old.
Where the rivers wander o’er sands of gold?—
Where the burning rays of the ruby shine.
And the diamond lights up the secret mine.
And the pearl gleams forth from the coral
strand ?
Is it there, sweet mother, that better land?’
‘Not there, not there, my child!’
‘Eye hath not seen it, my gentle boy!
Ear hath not heard its deep songs of joy;
Dreams cannot picture a world so fair—
Sorrow and death may not enter there;
Time doth not breathe on its fadeless bloom.
Far beyond the clouds, and beyond the tomb,
—lt is there, it is there, my child!’
Cato’s Soliloquy.
It must be so—Plato thou reason’st well—
Else whence this pleasing hope, this fond
desire.
This longing after immortality ?
Or whence this secret dread, and Inward
horror
Of falling into nought ? Why shrinks the soul
Back on herself, and startles at destruction ?
’Tis the Divinity, that stirs within us;
’ Tis heaven itself, that points out a hereafter.
And intimates eternity to man.
Eternity, thou pleasing, dreadful thought!
Through what variety of untried being,
Through what new scenes and changes must
we pass!
The wide, th’ unbounded prospect lies before
me;
But shadows, clouds, and darkness rest
upon it.
Here will I lf there’s a power above us,
(And that there is, all Nature cries aloud
Through all her works), he must delight in
virtue;
And that which he delights in mustbe happy.
But when or where ? This world was made
for Caesar.
I’m weary of conjectures—this must end ’em.
Thus am I doubly armed—My death and life,
My bane and entidote are both before me.
This in a moment brings me to an end;
But this informs me I shall never die.
The soul secured in her existence, smiles
At the drawn dagger, and defies its point:
The stars shall fade away, the sun himself
Grow dim with age, and nature sink in years.
But thou shalt flourish in immortal youth.
Unhurt amidst the war of elements.
The wreck of matter, and the crash of worlds.


Labour rids us of three great Evils—lrksomeness, Vice and Poverty.— The Great Frenchman.
Industry brings us four great Blessings—it makes us Healthier, Wealthier, Wiser and Worthier.- Gele’e Medal Maxim,
YOU MUST WORK TO BE HAPPY.
Proper time to Rest.
Early to bed and early to rise.
Is the way to be healthy, wealthy, and wise.
Hours of Sleep.
Nature requires eight; custom gives seven;
Laziness takes nine, and wickedness eleven.
Be Punctual.
Too late for work, too late for school.
Too late to keep by each good rule.
The sluggard soon becomes a fool;
Oh, never be too late.
Exercise.
Exercise in open air
Keeps the system in repair;
All the better it will be.
If pursued with life and glee.
Have an object for your walk.
Or a friend with whom to talk s
Only thus, ’tis understood.
Will your walking do you good.
Merry sport and manly game
Lend a vigour to the frame.
Which can ne’er be felt by those
In dull dumps who like to doze.
These are surely pleasant ways.
To prolong your youthful days.
How to Live Long;.
As soon as you are up, shake blankets and
sheet;
Better be without shoes than sit with wet
feet;
Children, if healthy, are active, not still.
Damp beds aud damp clothes will both
make you ill.
Eat slowly, and always chew your food well;
Freshen the air in the house where you
dwell;
Garments must never be made to be tight;
Homes will be healthy if airy and light.
If you wish to be well, as you do I’ve no
doubt.
Just open the windows before you go out;
Keep your rooms always tidy and clean.
Let dust on the furniture never be seen.
Much illness is caused by want of pure air;
Now to open your windows be ever your
care.
Old rags and old rubbish should never be
kept;
| People should see that their floors are well
, swept.
Quick movements in children are healthy
1 and right;
| Remember the young cannot thrive with-
I out light.
i See that the cistern is clean to the brim;
1 Take care that your dress is all tidy and
1 trim.
[ Use your nose to find out if there be a bad
i drain:
i Very sad are the fevers that come in its
1 train.
| Walk as much as you can without feeling
, fatigue,
i Xerxes could walk for full many a league;
1 Your health is your wealth, which your
| wisdom must keep;
, Zeal will help a good cause, and the good
i you will reap.
WORK.
Work, work, my boy! be not afraid, —
Look Labour boldy in the face;
Take up the hammer or the spade.
And blush not for your humble place.
There’s glory in the shuttle’s song;
There’s triumph in the anvil’s stroke;
There’s merit in the brave and strong
Who dig the mine or fell the oak.
I doubt if he who lolls his head
Where Idleness and Plenty meet.
Enjoys his pillow or his bread
As those who earn the meals they eat.
No Work, The Hardest Work.
Oh! ye, who at the anvil toil.
And strike the sounding blow.
Where from the burning iron’s breast
The sparks fly to and fro.
While answering to the hammer’s ring.
And fire’s intenser glow—
Oh! while ye feel 'tis hard to toil
And sweat the long day through.
Remember it is harder still
To have no work to do.
Ho! ye, who till the stubborn soil.
Whose hard hands guide the plough.
Who bend beneath the summer sun
With burning cheek and brow —
Ho! ye, who plough the sea’s blue field,
Who ride the restless wave;
Beneath whose gallant vessel’s keel
There lies a yawning grave;
Around whose bark the wintery winds
Like fiends of fury rave —
Oh ! while ye feel ’tis hard to toil
And labour long hours through.
Remember it is harder still
To have no work to do.
Ho! ye, upon whose fevered cheeks
The hectic glow is bright;
Whose mental toil wears out the day.
And half the weary night;
Who labour for the souls of men.
Champions of truth and right—
Although you feel your toil is hard.
Even with this glorious view.
Remember it is harder still
To have no work to do.
Ho ! all who labour, all who strive.
Ye wield a lofty power;
Do with your might, do with your strength.
Fill every golden hour!
The glorious privilege to do.
Is man’s most noble dower.
Oh! to your birthright and yourselves.
To your own souk be true !
A weary, wretched life is theirs.
Who have no work to do.
Labor, the Civilizer of the World.
It is to labor, and to labor only, that man
owes everything possessed of exchangeable
value. Labor is the talisman that has
raised him from the condition of the sav-
age ; that has changed the desert and the
forest into cultivated fields; that has covered
the earth with cities, and the ocean with
ships; that has given us plenty, comfort,
and elegance, instead of want, misery, and
barbarism.
Let The Child Work.
He who checks a child with terror, )
Stops its play and stills its song, j
Not alone commits an error.
But a great and moral wrong.
Give it play, and never fear it;
Active life is no defect.
Never, never break its spirit j
Curb it only to direct. /
Would you stop the flowing river, \
Thinking it would cease to flow ?
Onward it must flow for ever;
Better teach it where to go.
Work In School to be Wise. j
Now’s the time to study hard; l
Work will bring its own reward s
Then work, work, work I
We must spell and we must read
Nothing but our lessons heed.
Sure and steady must succeed:
Then work, work, work !
Who would like an empty purse ?
Empty brain would be still worse:
Then work, work, work!
With a will a task begin;
Now’s the time the prize to win;
Pour the golden knowledge in.
And work, work, work !
“REST.”
Rest is not quitting the busy career;
Rest is the fitting of self to its sphere.
’Tis the brook’s motion, clear without
strife.
Fleeing to ocean after its life.
’Tis loving and serving the Highest and
Best ;
’ Tis onward, unswerving, and that is true
rest.
Labor Is Rest.
Labor is rest—from the sorrows that,
greet us; i
Rest from all petty vexations that meet
us.
Rest from the sin-promptings that ever :
entreat us.
Rest from world-sirens that lure us to ill.
Work —and pure slumbers shall wait
on the pillow.
Work —thou shall ride over Care’s
coming billow;
Lie not down wearied'neth Woe’s weep-'
ing willow! >
Work with a stout heart and
RESOLUTE WILL !
Work for some good, be it ever so
slowly;
Cherish some flower, be it ever so lowly;
Labor !—all labor is noble and holt;
Let thy great deeds be thy prayer to God.
Industry far better than Gold. )
A man who teaches his sons and daughters
to labour at some honest calling, thereby
giving them habits of industry, provides
for their future happiness, far better than
giving them a large stock of money, and
permitting them to acquire habits of idle-
ness. To conclude, here is a maxim for
you, imprint it on your mind:
Work is the Saviour of Man.


** The longer I live, the more I am certain that the great difference between Men—between the Feeble and the Powerful, the Great and the Insignificant—is
Energy, Invxnoible determination —a purpose once fixed, and then Death or Victory. That quality will do anything that can be done in this world; and no talents,
no circumstances, no opportunities, will make a two-legged creature a man without it."—Sir Fowell Buxton's Motto.
ALWAYS PERSEVERE.
! Never Say Fall.
Keep pushing—’tis wiser
Than sitting aside.
And dreaming and sighing
\ And waiting the tide.
In life’s earnest battle they only prevail
Who daily march onward
And never say fail!
With an eye ever open—
A tongue that’s not dumb.
And a heart that will never
To sorrow succumb—
You’ll battle and conquer though thousands
, assail:
1 How strong and how mighty,
\ Who never say fail I
1 In life’s rosy morning,
\ In manhood’s firm pride,
, Let this be the motto
i Your footsteps to guide;
1 , In storm and in sunshine, whatever assail,
1 We’ll onward and conquer.
And never say fail!
Try Again.
’Tis a lesson you should heed.
Try, try, try again;
If at first you don’t succeed.
Try, try, try again.
Then your courage should appear;
For, if you will persevere.
You will conquer, never fear
Try, try, try again.
Once or twice though you may fail.
Try, try, try again;
If at last you would prevail,
j Try, try, try again.
) If we strive, ’tis no disgrace,
| Though we may not win the race;
What should we do in that case ?
[ Try, try, try again,
i If you find your task is hard,
1 Try, try, try again;
1 Time will bring you your reward,
[ Try, try, try again.
i All that other people do,
i Why, with patience, should not you ?
1 Only keep this rule in view,
| Try, try, try again.
Doing Nothing.
“ Lads,” said I, “ why sitting still—
Doing nothing ?”
1 u Oh,” says John," I’m helping Will
Doing nothing.”
“ Well, that seems a weary task
Doing nothing;
Don’t it tire you, let me ask.
Doing nothing ?”
" Tell me what you hope to learn,
Doing nothing!
Will it help you bread to earn.
Doing nothing!
Pray, to those who choose this trade.
Doing nothing.
How much wages should be paid;
Doing nothing P”
With no useful aim in view.
Doing nothing.
Soon you’ll find your friends for you
Doing nothing.”
To-Day and To-Morrow.
Don’t tell me of to-morrow.
Give me the man who’ll say.
That, when a good deed's to be done,
•* Let’s do the deed to-day,”
We may all command the present.
If we act and never wait.
But repentance is the phantom
Of a past, that comes too late!
Don’t tell me of to-morrow.
There is much to do to-day
That can never be accomplished.
If we throw the hours away.
Every moment has its duty.
Who the future can fortell ?
Then, why put off till to-morrow
What to-day can do as well ?
Don’t tell me of to-morrow:
If we look upon the past,
flow much, that we have left to do.
We cannot do at last;
To day,—it is the only time
For all on this frail earth;
It takes an age to form a life,
A movent gives it birth!
Psalm of Life.
Tell me not, in mournful numbers,
“ Life is but an empty dream !”
For the soul is dead that slumbers.
And things are not what they seem.
Life is real! Life is earnest!
And the grave is not its goal;
“ Dust thou art, to dust returnest/*
Was not spoken of the soul.
Not enjoyment, and not sorrow.
Is our destined end or way;
But to act, that each to-morrow
Finds us further than to-day.
In the world’s broad field of battle.
In the bivouac of life.
Be not like dumb, driven cattle!
Be a hero in the strife.
Trust no future, howe’er pleasant I
Let the dead past bury its dead I
Act—act in the living present!
Heart within, and God o’erhead I
Lives of great men all remind us
We can make our lives sublime.
And, departing, leave behind us
Footprints on the sands of time
Footprints, that perhaps another.
Sailing o’er life’s solemn main,
A forlorn and shipwrecked brother.
Seeing, shall take heart again.
Let us, then, be up and doing.
With a heart for any fate;
Still achieving, still pursuing.
Learn to labour and to wait.
The Industrious Nan*
Toiling, rejoicing, sorrowing.
Onward through life he goes ;
Each morning sees some task begin.
Each evening sees its close;
Something attempted, something done.
Has earned a night’s repose.
Look on the Sunny side.
Look always on the sunny side,
’Twill make us happier far.
Why should we try to find the cloud.
When brightly shines the star.
Some people only see the world.
As through a smoky glass.
They go half way to meet the woe.
And let the sunshine pass.
Persevere.
Drive the nail aright, boys—
Hit it on the head;
Strike with all your might, boys.
While the iron's red.
When you’ve work to do, boys.
Do it with a will;
They who reach the top, boys.
First must climb the hill.
Standing at the foot «,oys.
Gazing at the sky,—
How can you get up, boys.
If you never, try?
Though you stumble oft, boys.
Never be down-cast;
Try, and try again, boys,—
You'll succeed at last.
Never Give Up.
Never give up! It is wiser and better
Always to hope, than once to despair;
Fling off the load of doubt’s cankering fetter.
And break the dark spell of tyrannical
care.
Never give up! or the burden may sink you;
Providence kindly has mingled the cup;
And in all trials or troubles, bethink you.
The watchword of life must be, " Never
give up!”
Never give up! There are chances and
changes
Helping the hopeful a hundred to one;
And though the chaos, high Wisdom arran-1
ges (
Ever success, if you’M only hope on. i
Never give up ! for the wisest is boldest.
Knowing that Providence mingles the cup;
And of all maxims, the best, as the oldest.
Is the true watchword of," Never give up”
Never give up ! Though the grape-shot may
rattle.
Or the full thunder-cloud over you burst;
Stand like a rock, and the storm and the
battle
Little shall harm you, though doing their
worst.
Never give up! If adversity presses.
Providence wisely has mingled the cup;
And the best counsel, in all your distresses.
Is the stout watchword of, “Nevergiveup” )


TRUTH.
S'o Search for S ruth is Jiav/s first @)uty,
A knowledge of truth is besjk for human welfare; therefore, to observe, enquire, read, and think, in order to find truth, is the highest duty of man.
The first duty of man is to search for truth ; his second duty to be guided by it.—Cols’. Jfedol Maxims,
When one has discovered a truth, valuable to humanity, it is his duty to make it known as much as possible./or truth belong* to all.
He who has a truth and keeps it, keeps what not to him belongs,
Keeps part of his brother’s birthright, and his fellow-creature wrongs.
A Good Name.
Children choose it, don’t refuse it:
’Tis a precious diadem;
Highly prize it, don’t despise it s
You will need it when you’re men.
Speak the Truth.
Oh! ’tis a lovely thing for youth
To walk betimes in wisdom’s way;
To fear a lie, to speak the truth.
That we may trust to all they say.
But liars we can never trust, [true;
Though they should speak the thing that’s
And he that does one fault at first.
And lies to hide it, makes it two.
Be Liberal in Dealing.
All overreaching, grabbing, cribbing—
All imposition, cheating, fibbing—
Are mere obstructions to success;
Not merely vice, but foolishness.
You’ll find it better serve your end.
To regard each customer as a friend.
Let him in dealings treated be
With even more than equity.
Serve him with kindness and good measure,
Study in lawful things his pleasure;
Ne’er stick at what may doubtful seem,
Oive him the casting of the beam!
The men who thus their wares dispense.
In spirit of benevolence.
With less of gain on each transaction.
Have greatest final satisfaction.
• Be Honest.
Why should we deprive our neighbour
Of his goods against his will ?
Hands were made for honest labour.
Not to plunder nor to steal.
’Tis a foolish self-deceiving.
By such tricks to hope for gain;
All that’s ever got by thieving,
Turns to sorrow, shame, and pain.
Govern Your Temper.
Oh, govern your temper! for music, the
sweetest,
| Was never so sweet—nor one half so divine,
I As a heart kept in tune, which, the moment
i thou greetest,
1 Breathes harmony dearer than notes cap
[ combine!
, Never say it is nature , and may not be cured;
i One tithe of the time, which to music we
1 yield.
Would render the conquest of temper ensured,
| And bring us more music than song e’er
i revealed.
[ Oh, govern your temper—for roses, the
i fairest,
i Were never so fair, nor so rich in perfume,
1 As the flowers, which e’en thou, chilly winter
| sparest—
, The flowers of the heart , which unchang-
i ingly bloom!
1 Never think it is nature, —for oh, if it be,
1 The sooner the spirit of nature is shown,
[ That the spirit of heaven is higher than she,
i The sooner, the longer, will love be our
\ own.
BE GOOD.
Good Temper.
There’s not a cheaper thing on earth.
Nor yet a thing more dear;
’Tis worth more than distinguished birth,
Or thousands gained a year.
It lends the day a new delight;
’Tis virtue’s finest shield.
And adds more beauty to the night
Than all the stars may yield.
It maketh poverty content.
To sorrow whispers peace j
It is a gift from Heaven sent
For mortals to increase.
It meets you with a smile at morn j
It lulls you to repose;
A flower for peer and peasant born j
An everlasting rose.
A charm to banish grief away.
To free the brow from care ;
Turns tears to smiles, makes dulness gay.
Spreads gladness everywhere.
And yet ’tis cheap as summer dew,
That gems the lily’s breast j
A talisman for love as true
As ever man possessed.
As smiles the rainbow through the cloud
When threat’ning storm begins.
As music ’mid the tempest loud
That still its sweet way wins ;
As springs an arch across the tide.
When waves conflicting foam j
So comes the seraph to our side.
This angel of our home.
What may this wondrous spirit be.
With power unheard before ?
This charm, this bright divinity ?
Good temper ; nothing more !
Good temper ; 'tis the choicest gift
That woman homeward brings.
And can the poorest peasant lift
To bliss—unknown to kings.
Good temper ; ’tis the sweetest charm
To man or woman given;
The ills of life its powers disarm.
And make this earth a heaven !
Scandal, Live It Down.
Should envious tongues some malice frame.
To soil and tarnish your good name;
Grow not dishearten’d; ’tis the lot
Of all men, whether good or not:
Live it down!
And when shall come the poison’d lie
Swift from the bow of calumny.
If you would turn it harmless by.
And make the venom’d falsehood lie.
Live it down!
Good Life, Long Life.
He liveth long, who liveth well ;
All else is life but flung away;
He liveth longest who can tell
Of true things truly done each day.
Be True.
To thine own self be true;
And it must follow, as the night the day.
Thou cans’t not then be false to any man.
You auk me how I Live.
Living friendly, feeling friendly.
Acting fairly to all men.
Seeking to do that to others
They may do to me again.
Hating no man, scorning no man.
Wronging none by word or deed ;
But forbearing, soothing, serving.
Thus 1 live —and this my creed.
Harsh condemning, fierce contemning.
Is of little Christian use.
One soft word of kindly peace
Is worth a torrent of abuse j
Calling things bad, calling men bad.
Adds but darkness to their night j
If thou would’st improve thy brother
Let thy goodness be his light.
I have felt, and know how bitter
Human coldness makes the w®rld.
Every bosom round me frozen.
Not an eye with pity pearled ;
Still my heart, with kindness teeming.
Glads when other hearts are glad.
And my eyes a tear-drop findeth
At the sight of others sad.
Ah !be kind—life hath no secret
For our happiness like this;
Kindly hearts are seldom sad ones—
Blessing ever bringeth bliss.
Lend a helping hand to others.
Smile though all the world should frown,
Man is man —we all are brothers—
Black or white, or red or brown.
Man is man, through all gradations—
Little recks it where he stands;
How divided into nations.
Scattered over many lands ;
Man is man by form and feature,
Man by vice and virtue too,
TVfau in all one common nature
Speaks and binds us brothers true.
The Golden Rule of Pythagoras.
Written in Greece 2,400 year* ago.
Let not soft slumber close thine eyes.
Before thou recollectest thrice
Thy train of actions through the day—
‘ Where have my feet found out the way P
What have I learned where’er I’ve been,
From all I’ve heard, from all I’ve seen ?
What know I more that’s worth the knowing?
What have I done that’s worth the doing ?
What have I sought that I should shun ?
What duty have I left undone ?
Or into what new follies run ?’
These self enquiries are the road
That lead to virtue —lead to good.
Let us Rake a Heaven of Eartli.
Onward, onward, let us press.
Through the path of duty;
Virtue is true happiness.
Excellence true beauty.
Minds are of celestial birth j
Let us make a heaven of earth.
Cole’s Medal Maxim.
Always do that which you believe to be
right.


TRUTH.
Speak the S/ruth at all boosts.
He, who seeks the truth and trembles at the dangers he must brave.
Is not fit to be a freeman : he at best is but a slave.
Speak ! no matter what betide thee, let them strike but make them hear;
Be thou like the noble Jesus, scorn the threat that bids thee fear.
Be thou like the first apostles ; never fear, thou shalt not fall;
If a free thought seek expression, speak it boldly ! Speak it all I
Face thine enemies, accusers ; scorn the prison, rack, or rod!
Anri if thou hast truth to utter, speak, and leave the rest to God!
The Rights of Women.
(The rights of woman, what are they ?
The rights to love and work each day ;
(The right to weep when others weep,
The right .o wake when others sleep.
S The right to dry the falling tear,
(The right to stay the rising fear;
(The right to smooth the brow of care,
? And whisper comfort to despair.
| The right to watch the parting breath,
) To soothe and cheer the bed of death;
(The right, when earthly hopes all fail,
(To point to that within the veil.
(The right the wanderer to reclaim,
) And win the lost from paths of shame j
(The right to comfort and to bless

Are these thy rights? Then use them
Thy silent influence none can tell, [well ;
If these are thine, why ask for more —
Thou hast enough to answer for.
My Mother.
Who fed me from her gentle breast.
And hushed me in her arms to rest.
And on my cheek sweet kisses prest ?
My Mother.
When sleep forsook my open eye,
• Who was it sung sweet lullaby,
[ And rocked me that I should not cry ?
iMy Mother.
Who sat and watched my infant head.
When sleeping on my cradle bed.
And tears of sweet affection shed ?
My Mother.
When pain and sickness made me cry,
Who gazed upon my heavy eye.
And wept for fear that I should die ?
My Mother.
Who dressed my doll in clothes so gay.
And taught me pretty how to play.
And minded all I had to say ?
My Mother.
Who ran to help me when I fell.
And would some pretty story tell.
Or kiss the place to make it well ?
My Mother.
Who taught my infant lips to pray.
To love God’s holy Word and day,
) And walk in wisdom’s pleasant way ?
\ My Mother.
\ And can I ever cease to be,
{Affectionate and kind to thee.
Who was’t so very kind to me.
My Mother ?
Oh no I the thought I cannot bear;
And if God please my life to spare,
1 1 hope I shall reward thy care,
) My Mother.
DO GOOD.
When thou art feeble, old, and gray.
My healthy arm shall be thy stay.
And I will soothe thy pains away.
My Mother.
And when I see thee hang thy head,
’Twill be my turn to watch thy bed.
And tears of sweet affection shed.
My Mother.
For God, who lives above the skies.
Would look with vengeance in His eyes,
If I should ever dare despise.
My Mother’,
Be Kind.
Be kind to thy father: for when thou wert
young.
Who loved thee so fondly as he ?
He caught the first accents that fell from
thy tongue.
And joined in thine innocent glee.
Be kind to thy father, for now he is old.
His locks intermingled with gray ;
His footsteps are feeble, once fearless and
bold;—
Thy father is passing away.
Be kind to thy mother: for lo ! on her brow
May traces of sorrows be seen;
O, well may’st thou cherish and comfort her
now.
For loving and kind hath she been.
Eemember thy mother: for thee she will
pray.
As long as God giveth her breath;
With accents of kindness, then, cheer her
lone way,
E’en to the dark valley of death.
Be kind to thy brother: his heart will have
dearth.
If the smile of thy love be withdrawn;
The flowers of feeling will fade at their
birth.
If the dew of rffection be gone.
Be kind to thy sister : not many may know
The depth of true sisterly 1 Jve ;
The wealth of the ocean lies fathoms below
The surface that sparkles above.
Thy kindness shall bring to thee many
sweet hours,
And blessings thy pathway to crown;
Affection shall weave thee a garland of
flowers.
More precious than wealth or renown.
Tliy Neighbour.
Thy neighbour ? It is he whom thou
Hast power to aid and bless;
Whose aching heart, or burning brow,
Thy soothing hand may press.
Thy neighbour ? ’Tis the fainting poor.
Whose eye with want is dim,
Whom hunger sends from door to door; —
Go thou and succour him.
Thy neighbour ? ’Tis that weary man.
Whose years are at their brim.
Bent low with sickness, cares, and pain;—
Go thou and comfort him.
Thy neighbour ? ’Tis the heart bereft
Of every earthly gem;
Widow and orphan, helpless left; —
Go thou and shelter them.
Kind Words.
A little word in kindness spoken,
A motion or a tear.
May heal a spirit broken.
And make a friend sincere.
A word, or look, has crushed to earth
Oft many a budding flower.
Which, had a smiles but owned its birth.
Would have blest life’s latest hour.
Then deem it not a idle thing
A kindly word to speak j
The face you wear, the smile you bring,
May soothe a heart or break.
Little Things.
Little drops of water, little grains of sand,
Make the mighty ocean and the pleasant
land.
Thus the little minutes, humble though
they be,
Make the mighty ages of eternity.
Thus our little errors make a mighty sin;
Drop by drop the evil floods the heart
within.
Little deeds of kindness, little words of love.
Make our earth an Eden, like the heaven
above.
Act Pleasant to All.
Since trifles make the sum of human things.
And half our misery from foibles springs.
Since life’s best joys consist in peace and
ease.
And few can save or serve, but all can
please—
Oh ! let the ungentle spirit learn from hence,
A small unkindness is a great offence:
Large bounties to bestow we wish in vain.
But all may shun the guilt of giving pain.
Speak Gently.
Speak gently ! it is better far
To rule by love than fear;
Speak gently ; let not harsh words mar
The good we might do here.
Speak gently to the little child— *
Its love be sure to gain;
Teach it in accents soft and mild—
It may not long remain. (
Speak gently to the young, for they J
Will have enough to bear;
Pass through this life as best they may,—
’Tis full of anxious care.
Speak gently to the aged one — 1
Grieve not the careworn heart;
The sands of life are nearly run — ,
Let such in peace depart. i
Speak gently, kindly to the poor— 5
Let no harsh tone be heard; j
They have enough they must endure, j
Without an unkind word. )
Speak gently ! —’Tis a little thing, s
Dropp’d in the heart’s deep well; ;
The good, the joy, which it may bring, )
Eternity shall tell. (


TRUTH.
<S4 knowledge of truth is necessary for human welfare .
** The victories of truth are the most glorious, chiefly because they are the most bloodless of all victories, deriving their highest lustre from the
number of the saved, not of the slain.”— Colton,
Nine-tenths of man’s misery is caused by his ignorance of the truth —his bodily pains—his premature death—his poverty—
his crimes—his tyranny—his inhuman -wars—his enmity of other races—his religious hatreds—all result from his ignorance.
—lf men thoroughly knew the truth—disease—want—crime'—tyranny—war-hatred of race—and bigotry would cease, and
they would live the world through in comfort and brotherly love, and none would die except from ripe old age and rarely occur-
ing accidents. —But I have great hopes of the future; —slavery is ceasing, education is spreading—sanitary, surgical, and
medical knowledge is advancing—social and political congresses arc meeting —industrial exhibitions are opening—telegraphs.
WORTH MAKES THE MAN.
( True Nobility.
( “ The mind’s the standard of the man.”
) “ Tis worth that makes the man.”
) “An honest man’s the noblest work of God,
1 I ask not for his lineage,
| I ask not for his name;
If manliness be in his heart.
He noble birth may claim.
i I care not though of worldly wealth,
But slender be his part.
If yes you answer when I ask,
"Hath he a true man’s heart ?”
I I ask not from what land he came,
I sTor where his youth was nursed;
If pure the spring, it matters not
I The spot from whence it burst.
[ The palace or the hovel
, Where first his life began,
i I seek not for; but answer this—
I “Ishe an honest man ? ”
1 Moral Worth.
1 I love the man who scorns to be,
1 To name or sect a slave ;
Whose soul is like the sunshine, free —
Free as the ocean wave ;
Who, when he sees oppression, wrong,
Speaks out in thunder tones;
Who feels with truth that he is strong
To grapple e’en with thrones.
1 love the man who shuns to do
An action mean or low;
Who will a nobler course pursue.
To stranger, friend, or foe;
Who seeks for justice, not for gain,
Is merciful and kind;
Who will not cause a needless pain
In body or in mind.
Rich and Poor Rwial.
O, rich man’s son! there is a toil
That with all other level stands;
Large charity doth never soil,
But only whitens soft white hands;
This is the best crop from thy lands; —
A heritage, it seems to me.
Worth being rich to hold in fee.
O, poor man’s son ! scorn not thy state ;
There is worse weariness than thine.
In merely being rich and great;
Toil only gives the soul to shine.
And makes rest fragrant and benign;—
A hei’itage, it seems to me
Worth being poor to hold in fee.
Both heirs to some six feet of sod.
Are equal in the earth at last;
Both children of the same great God,
Provo title to your heirship vast
By record of a well-filled past;—
A heritage, it seems to me,
Weil worth a life to hold in fee.
What makes the Man.
Not numerous years nor lengthened life.
Not pretty children and a wife.
Not pins, and chains, and fancy rings.
Nor any such like trumpery things;
Nor pipes, cigars, nor bottled wine.
Nor liberty with kings to dine;
Nor coats, nor boots, nor yet a hat,
A dandy vest, ®r trimmed cravat;
Nor all the world’s wealth laid in store;
Nor master, rev’rend, sir or squire.
With titles that the memory tire.
No ancestry traced back to Will,
Who went from Normandy to kill;
Not Latin, Greek, nor Hebrew lore.
Nor thousand volumes rambled o’er:
Not judges’ robes, nor mayor’s mace.
Nor crowns that deck the royal race—
They all united never can
Avail to make a single man.
A truthful soul, a loving mind,
Full of affection for its kind;
A helper of the human race,
A soul of beauty and of grace,
A spirit FIRM, ERECT, AND FREE,
That never basely bends the knee.
That will not bear a fetter’s weight
Of slavery’s chain, for small or great;
That truth speaks of God within.
And never makes a league with sin ;
That snaps the fetters despots make.
And loves the truth for its own sake;
That Worships God and Him alone.
That trembles at no tyrant’s nod—
A soul that fears no one but God,
And thus can smile at curse and ban:
That is the soul which makes the man.
The Good, Noble Man of Ross.
All our praises why should Lords engross P
Rise honest Muse! and sing the man of Ross ;
Whose causeway parts the vale with shady rows ?
Whose seats the weary traveller repose P
Who taught that Heav’n-directed spire to rise ?
“ The Man of Ross,” each lisping bahe replies.
Behold the market-place with poor o’erspread 1
The man of Ross divides the weekly bread ;
He feeds yon almshouse, neat, but void of state,
Where age and want sit smiling at the gate ;
Him portion’d maids, apprentic'd orphans bless,
The young who labour, and the old who rest;
Is any sick ? the Man of Ross relieves,
Prescribes, attends, the med’eine makes, and gives.
Is there a variance ? enter but his door, —
Balk’d are the courts, and contest is no more.
Despairing quacks with curses fled the place.
And vile attorneys, now a useless race.
Thrice happy man! enabled to pursue
What all do wish, but want the power to do I
O, say ! what sums that gen’rous hand supply ?
What mines to swell that boundless charity ?
Of debts and taxes, wife and children clear.
This man possess’d—five hundred pounds a year.
Blush, Grandeur, blush I proud courts withdraw
your blaze;
Ye little stars ! hide your diminished rays!
| It is not Cold can make us Rich.
It is not gold can make us rich,
’Tis oft an idol shrine;
It is not titles makes us great.
True greatness is divine.
There’s many a wealthy man is poor.
And many a lordling low.
For wealth and titles but ensure
The pomp of outward show.
The lack of gold ne’er makes us poor.
If knowledge makes us wise;
The want of title ne’er degrades.
If virtue’s stamp we prize.
There’s many a princely throne is rear’d
Besides a lowly hearth;
And men that Fortune never cheer’d
Have blest and brightened earth.
What is Noble?
What is noble ?—to inherit
Wealth, estate, and proud degree ?
There must be some other merit
Higher yet than these for me !
Something greater far must enter
Into life’s majestic span,
Fitted to create and centre
True nobility in man.
What is noble ? ’Tis the finer
Portion of our mind and heart
Linked to something still diviner
Than mere language can impart;
Ever prompting—ever seeing
Some improvement yet to plan
To uplift our fellow-being.
And, like man, to feel for man!
What is noble ? Is the sabre
Nobler than the human spade ?
There’s a dignity in labour
Truer than e’er pomp arrayed.
He who seeks the mind’s improvement
Aids the world in aiding mind;
Every great commanding movement
Serves not one, but all mankind.
O’er the forge’s heat and ashes.
O’er the engine’s iron head.
Where the rapid shuttle flashes.
And the spindle whirls its thread.
There is labour lowly tending
Each requirement of the hour—
There is genius, still extending
Science, and its world of power,
’Mid the dust, and speed, and clamour
Of the loom-shed and the mill;
’Midst the clink of wheel and hammer.
Great results are growing still.
Though too oft by fashion’s creatures
Work and workers may be blamed.
Commerce need not hide its features—
Industry is not ashamed.
What is noble ? That which places
Truth in its enfranchised will.
Leaving steps, like angel-traces.
That mankind may follow still.
E’en though scorn’s malignant glances
Prove him poorest of his clan,
He*s the Noble who advances
Freedom and the Cause of Man.

search after, and consequent discovery of truth, there is indeed a good time coming. —And now dear reader—hoping that my
unusual medley of a book will please, instruct, and do good to some, and offend none, I bid you farewell; and that you in
common with all may become wiser and wiser, and consequently happier and happier as time rolls on, is the sincere wish
of that inhabitant of your earth, called E. W. COLE.
END.
HUMAN BROTHERHOOD.
The Miseries of War.
I hate that drum’s discordant sound.
Parading round, and round, and round ;
To thoughtless youth it pleasure yields.
And lures from cities and from fields:
To me, it talks of ravaged plains.
And burning towns, and ruin’d swains.
And mangled limbs, and dying groans.
And widows’ tears, and orphans’ moans.
And all that misery’s hand bestows.
To fill the catalogue of human woes.
The Sinfulness of War.
Ez fer war, I call it murder—
There you hev it plain an’ flat;
I don’t want to go no furder
Than my Testyment fer that ;
God hez sod so plump an’ fairly,
It’s ez long ez it is broad,
An’ you’ve gut to git up airly
Ef you want to take in God.
’Taint your eppy lefts an’ feathers
Make the thing a grain more right;
'Taint a-follerin’ your bell-wethers
Will excuse ye in His sight.
Ef you take a sword an’ dror it.
An’ go stick a feller thru,
Quv’ment aint to answer for it,
God ’ll send the bill to you.
Liberty without Murder
We want no flag—no flaunting rag —
In Liberty’s cause to fight;
We want no blaze of murderous guns
To struggle for the right:
Our spears and swords are printed words—
The mind’s our battle-plain;
We’ve won our victories thus before.
And so we shall again.
We love no triumphs gained by force —
They stain the brightest cause:
’Tis not in blood that Liberty
Inscribes her sacred laws;
She writes them on the people’s hearts.
In language clear and plain :
True thoughts have moved the world before,
And so they shall again.
We yield to none in earnest love
Of Freedom’s cause sublime ;
We join the cry—“ Fraternity!”
We keep the march of Time.
And yet we grasp no spear nor sword
Our victories to obtain;
We've won without such help before.
And so we shall again.
We want no aid of barricade
To show a front to wrong;
We have a fortress in the Truth
More durable and strong. [faith
Calm words, great thoughts, unflinching
Have never striven in vain;
They’ve won our victories many a time.
And so they shall again.
Peace, progress, knowledge, brotherhood.
The ignorant may sneer—
The bad deny; but we rely
To see their triumph near.
No widows’ groans shall mar our cause.
No blood of brethren slain:
Kindness and Love have won before.
And so they shall again.
The Four-Leaved Shamrock.
I’ll seek a four-leaved shamrock
In all the fairy dells.
And if I find the charmed leaf.
Oh, how I’ll weave my spells!
I would not waste my magic might
On diamond, pearl, or gold.
For treasures tires the weary sense—
Such triumph is but cold;
But I will play the enchanter’s part
In casting bliss around;
Oh! not a tear nor aching heart
Should in the world be found.
To worth I would give honor,
I’d dry the mourner’s tears.
And to the pallid lip recall
The smile of happier years;
And hearts that had been long estranged.
And friends that had grown cold.
Should meet again, like parted streams.
And mingle as of old.
Oh! thus I’d play the enchanter’s
In casting bliss around; [part
Oh! not a tear nor aching heart
Should in the world be f ound.
What Might be Done.
What might be done if men were wise—
What glorious deeds, my suffering
brother.
Would they unite.
In Love and Right,
And cease their scorn for one another ?
Oppression’s heart might be imbued
With kindling drops of loving-kindness.
And Knowledge pour.
From shore to shore.
Light on the eyes of mental blindness.
All Slavery, Warfare, Lies, and Wrongs,
All Vice and Crime might die together;
And wine and corn.
To each man born.
Be free as warmth in summer weather.
The meanest wretch that ever trod.
The deepest sunk in guilt and sorrow.
Might stand erect.
In self-respect.
And share the teeming world to-morrow.
What might be done ? This might be done.
And more than this , my suffering brother.
More than the tongue
E’er said or sung.
If men were wise and loved each other.
f All Men Equal.
All men are eqwal in their birth.
Heirs of the earth and skies;
All men are equal when that earth
Fades from their dying eyes.
'Tis man alone who difference sees.
And speaks of high and law,
And worships those, and tramples these.
While the same path they go ;
Ye great! renounce your earth-born pride ;
Ye low ! your shame and fear :
Live, as ye worship, side by side ;
Your brotherhood revere.
Brotherhood of Man.
Abou-Ben-Adhem—may his tribe increase !
Awoke one night from a sweet dream of
peace.
And saw, within the moonlight of his room.
Making it rich, and like a lily bloom.
An angel writing in a book of gold.
Exceeding peace had made Ben-Adhem
bold:
And to the vision in the room he said—
“ What writest thou P” The vision raised its
head.
And with a look made all of sweet accord.
Answered, “ The names of those who love
the Lord.”
“And is mine one?” said Abou. “Nay, notso,”
Replied the angel. Abou spoke more low.
But cheerly still, and said: “I pray thee, then.
Write me as one who loves his fellow
men.”
The angel wrote and vanished; the next night
It came again, with a great awakening light.
And showed the names which love of &od 1
had blest.
And lo ! Ben-Adhem’s name led all the rest.,
There’s a boud Time Coming;. I
There’s a good time coming, boys, (
A good time coming:
We may not live to see the day.
But earth shall glisten in the ray /
Of the good time coming.
Cannon-balls may aid the truth, j
But thought’s a weapon stronger j j
We’ll win our battle by its aid — )
Wait a little longer. /
There’s a good time coming, boys, i
A good time coming: )
The pen shall supersede the sword, )
And Right, not Might, shall be the lord (
In the good time coming. (
Worth, not Birth, shall rule mankind, )
And be acknowledged stronger; )
The proper impulse has been given;— <
Wait a little longer. (
There’s a good time coming, boys, /
A good time coming: /
War in all men’s eyes shall be (
A monster of iniquity j
In the good time coming; )
Nations shall not quarrel then, /
To prove which is the stronger, (
Nor slaughter men for glory’s sake — (
Wait a little longer. )
There’s a good time coming, boys, /
A good time coming: (
Hateful rivalries of creed (
Shall not make their martyrs bleed /
In the good time coming. )
Religion shall be shorn of pride, (
And flourish all the stronger, (
And Charity shall trim her lamp;
Wait a little longer. )
There’s a good time coming, boys, (
A good time coming; S
Let us aid it all we can, /
Every woman, every man, — /
The good time coming, (
Smallest helps, if rightly given, j
Make the impulse stronger; )
’Twill be strong enough one day;— )
Wait a little longer. (
