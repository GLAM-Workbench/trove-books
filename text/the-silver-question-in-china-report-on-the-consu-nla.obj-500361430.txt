THE SILVER QUESTION IN CHINA.
Report on the Consumption of Silver in China as shown by the Balance of
Trade between China and Foreign Countries, and on the effect
of the Fall in Silver on prices of Commodities in
China and on the Volume of Exports.
BY
G. JAMIESON, H. M. CONSUL,
SHANGHAI.
In the following pages I propose to review
the General Trade between China and Foreign
countries during the last 23 years, with a view
to showing: 1. —To what extent China has
been an importer or exporter of the pre-
cious metals since 1870. 2.—What has been
.the effect of the fall in the value of silver on
prices of:— (a) Articles of Native origin
commonly exported to Foreign countries; (b)
Articles of Native origin commonly produced
for consumption in China itself. 3. —What
has been the effect of the fall of silver
in stimulating the volume of exports from
China ?
Preliminary Observations.
China would seem to be peculiarly well
situated for observing phenomena connected
with changes in the value of the precious
metals. There is a fair stock of both gold
and silver in the country. Neither is produced
to any extent at the present day within the
country itself, but there is perfect freedom of
transport to and from Foreign countries.
There is no legislation in the country giving
either metal a preference over the other as a
medium of exchange. By common consent
silver is so used, not, however, in the form of
national coins bearing a certain standard of
value, but simply by weight, as one commodity
might be exchanged for another. There is
nothing to prevent gold being used in payment,
if the parties so desire, and if so used, it would
be taken by weight. The relative value of
gold and silver changes day by day, and
closely follows the exchange on the London
market.
The Government of China has not been a
borrower in the Foreign market to any appreci-
able extent. Small loans have been contracted
from time to time, but at the present moment
they are nearly all paid off. There has never,
therefore, been any disturbance of values by
the sudden augmentation of the stock of the
precious metals in the country, and whatever
minor effects the temporary borrowing may
have had, have been counteracted by the
subsequent repayment.
Again, all the conditions regarding mode
and cost of production of commodities in the
interior have remained unchanged. The same
methods of agriculture, of manufacture, and
of transport are still in vogue as were used,
not merely 20 years, but 100 or several 1,000
years ago. There has been no cheapening of
production, as in all western countries, by the
introduction of machinery, the substitution of
steam for manual labour, or by improved
facilities of transport. With the exception of
the steamboat service on the coast, the means
of transport remain such as they have always
been within the memory of man. The facilities
provided for the interchange of commodities
between the ports open to Foreign trade
through Foreign steamers, have doubtless
cheapened the productions of one province to
the consumers of another, but on the whole, it
does not appear that the cost of articles at the
port of production has been affected thereby.
The Foreign trade of China now amounts to
a total of some 52,000,000/. sterling, being
the equivalent at the present rate of exchange
of 235,000,000 Haikwan taels. This was
composed for last year of imports, 27,000,000/.,


and exports, 25,000,000/. The trade is thus
large enough to allow free play to the adjust-
ment of values through competition with those
of the rest of the world.
If, for instance, any article of general de-
mand —say wool, or silk, or cotton —was found
to be cheaper in China than elsewhere,
competition would at once set in, and
buyers would bid against one another
until the equilibrium was restored. This
result will be the same whether the relative
cheapness is caused by a difference in the ex-
change value of gold and silver or is due to
other causes. Say that a sovereign will buy
in London at any given time, a pound of raw
silk and at the same time exchanges for 6 dol.
in China, the price of a pound of raw silk
in Shanghai will tend to conform to a
standard of 6 dol., less duty and costs of
transport. If, then, by a fall in rates of
exchange the sovereign will produce 7 dol. in
China, the price of silk in London remaining
constant, the price of silk in Shanghai is 1
dol. a pound below the London price. Com-
petition at once sets in, and the price in
Shanghai is quickly raised to 7 dol. Or sup-
pose, again, that the price of a pound of silk in
London falls to 175., while the gold value of
silver falls as before, so that the 17s. will produce
in China approximately 6 dol. The price of
silk in China will not be affected, but the price
of gold will. Gold, as a commodity, is then
15 per cent, cheaper in China than in London,
and Foreign buyers will bid against one an-
other so long as any holders can be found
willing to sell until equilibrium is restored.
It is thus evident that changes in the rela-
tive value of gold and silver arising in Europe
will, through the agency of international com-
merce, immediately have their full effect in the
altered purchasing power of the two metals
all the world over, and in China no less than
elsewhere; and inasmuch as, for the reasons
before stated, the problems connected with
cost of production which complicate questions
of this nature in Europe, and even in India,
are here absent, it would seem that China is a
very favourable field for observing the effect
of the fall in silver on prices generally.
1. —Question of the Balance of Trade in the
Foreign Commerce of China. Imports
and Exports of Bullion.
The first point I wish to examine, is the effect
of Foreign trade on the stock of the precious
metals in the country.
Unfortunately, no statistics of the movements
of bullion are available until a comparatively
recent date. The only agency by which
information of this kind could be collected and
preserved is the Imperial Maritime Customs.
Statistics of the values of imports and exports
of merchandise have been published by
this department since about the year 1863,
and ever since 1870 the returns have been
compiled with great care, and may • now
be.accepted as being as accurate as the
nature of the case will allow. Unfortunate-
ly, however, the import and export of bullion
formed an exception. As bullion paid no
duty, no permit was required for its being
shipped or landed, and consequently no ac-
curate check was possible on the quantities
entering or leaving the country. To some
extent these drawbacks are still in operation,
but a greater desire on the part of the Customs
authorities to ensure accuracy, and a greater
willingness on the part of merchants and
bankers to co-operate, have combined to make
the returns of bullion published for the last
four or five years fairly trustworthy.
The only means, therefore, by which a
general notion can be got of the extent to.
which silver has been entering or leaving
the country during the last 20 years, is by
a comparison of the values of the imports
and exports. If these are accurately given
they ought either to balance, or, if they do
not, the difference must be made up by a
corresponding import or export of either gold
or silver. There is no private transmission
of capital from Europe for investment to any
extent and the Chinese Government having, as
I said, practically paid off the only small loans
she ever contracted, there is no national
indebtedness on the one side or the other to
complicate the account other than that arising
from the summing-up of the year’s transactions.
I propose, then, to examine the returns
published by the Chinese Imperial Customs,
with a view of ascertaining on which side the
balance of trade lies, and to what extent.
These returns, however, require several cor-
rections before they can be used for this
purpose. If the annual values of the imports
and exports as there given are added together,
say for the past 20 years, it will appear as if
the imports out-valued the exports by some
2,000,000/. per annum, and that, therefore,
there has been a constant outflow of the
precious metals to that extent. This is by no
means the true state of facts, and a few brief
explanations are necessary to show what
corrections and allowances must be made.


In the first place, the values given in these
returns are the market values at the port of
landing or shipment, as the case may be. A
moment’s consideration will show that this is
not the value at which the one sort of
merchandise can be set off against the other,
that is, the imports against the exports.
Take, for instance, a consignment of Manches-
ter goods arriving from England for sale by a
local agent which fetches on the market 10,000
taels. The whole of this sum is not available
for remittance to the owner in England. The
local agent, before he can put the goods on
the market, has had to pay duty and landing
charges, perhaps also storage and insurance,
and he expects also a commission as seller.
He makes up his account thus:—
Amount.
Paid duty Tls. 500
Commission and charges „ 400
Balance to be remitted „ 9,100
Total ... Tls. 10,000
If his principal has instructed him to invest
the proceeds in Native produce for shipment
to London, instead of remitting, he will take
care to purchase only such an amount as will
leave him enough in hand to pay the export
duty and his commission and charges. His
account will then run thus:—
Amount.
Bought, say 500 piculs tea @ 15 taels Tls. 7,500
Paid duty at 2.50 taels „ 1,250
Commission and charges „ 350
Total ' ... Tls. 9,100
The transaction is thus closed from an
international point of view; there is no balance
to be remitted on either side. But it is evident
that it would be quite erroneous to represent,
as the Customs returns do, that the double
transaction meant that imports to the value of
10,000 taels had come into the country and
exports to the value of 7,500 taels had left.
What really took place was an import of the
value of 9,10 a taels and an export of an
identical value.
It will be noticed that I have taken
no note of freight outward. This, though
usually paid and charged by the exporting
agent, does not really enter into the transac-
tion, because if paid by the shipper it has to
be remitted by the agent of the vessel to the
shipowner; all ocean-going vessels being
Foreign-owned, and so cbmes to the same
thing as if not paid here at all. So I have not
allowed anything for importer’s profit, but only
selling commission, as that is in the long run
what meets the local expenditure of the Foreign
merchants or agents. If they are themselves
principals they will call whatever surplus
remains over after the transaction is closed,
profit, but in so far as this exceeds a commis-
sion, it will eventually be remitted to the country
of the Foreign merchant.
The Customs returns must therefore be cor-
rected by deducting from the imports and ad-
ding to exports, duty and charges in each case.
The Customs authorities have recognised the
necessity of this correction, and have, since
1890, introduced into the returns for each port
an amendment purporting to show the true
values of imports and exports, at the moment of
landing and shipment respectively. With the
general principle and the reasons given for the
correction I entirely agree, but it seems to me
that in making the correction an error of fact
has been introduced which overstates the values
very considerably in favour of China, and leaves
the result still untrustworthy. I allued to the
per-centage which is added to exports and
deducted from imports by way of commission
and charges.
This is taken for imports at 7 per cent., and
for exports at 8 per cent. These figures, so far
as I have been able to ascertain, are far too
large. The true way to look at the Foreign
trade of China, which is all done by Foreign
capital, is to regard it, so far as local charges
go, as purely a commission business. What
ought to be deducted from market value of
imports under this heading, is the sum of all
local expenditure incurred in carrying on the
business, t.e., everything paid locally and spent
in the country. So for exports you must
add all expenditure accruing to China between
the purchase in the market and the point of
shipment. This is a matter of fact, which can
only be determined by a reference to those
that know, and collating all the information
that I have been able to gather, I think
that 4 per cent, all round is enough to cover
everything. This, of course, is exclusive of duty,
the amount of which is known, and on this
basis I have made the calculations that follow.
The next point to be noticed is that, previous
to 1887, the Customs returns did not represent
the whole of the Foreign trade of China. Ihe
proximity of the colony of Hongkong to the
mainland of China enables a large trade to be
carried on by Native junks, which have for
many years imported, into the several towns
along the southern coast, quantities of Foreign


manufactures, and have conveyed into Hong-
kong more or less of Native produce destined
for Foreign consumption, neither of which
came within the purview of the Foreign Mari-
time Customs. No statistics were obtainable
at the Native offices, and, Hongkong being a
free port, no information as to the values of
junk cargoes was to be procured on that side.
Consequently it was impossible to form any
accurate sort of estimate as to the amount of
this trade, or as to the proportion which the
imports bore to the exports. One thing,
however, was known, and that was that almost
all the Indian opium consumed in Southern
China entered by these junks, and not through
the Foreign Customs. This alone made it
quite certain that a great deal more in value
entered China by this means than came out.
It was estimated that from 15,000 to 18,000
chests of opium entered China in this way,
which, at an average cost in Hongkong of 350
taels per chest, made an indebtedness on the
part of China and increased the national bill
against her by some 5,000,000 taels to 6,000,000
taels per annum.
In 1887 the control of the junk trade be-
tween Hongkong and the mainland was by in-
ternational convention placed in the hands of
the Maritime Customs, since which time we have
had accurate accounts published of all mer-
chandise passing between Hongkong and China
in Native craft. The first and most con-
spicuous result of this, was that the import of
Indian opium into Canton by steamer, which
had for many years been merely nominal,
suddenly sprang to 6,000,000 taels in 1888,
and has remained since at between 5,000,000
taels and 6,000,000 taels. I find that during
the five years, 1888 to 1892, the values
of the junk cargoes, including such opium
as they carry, approximately balance each
other. Reasoning backwards, then, fro.m
what has been ascertained since the junk trade
came under review, I conclude that the value
of the Foreign imports into China by way of
junk exceeded the exports by about 5,000,000
taels. This, therefore, is the sum which must
be added to the imports into China each year
in making up the balance prior to 1887.
A small amount of trade finds its way by
junk to other Foreign ports, but this can have
no appreciable effect on the general result,
and it may be said that we have thus
accounted for the whole of the sea-borne trade
of China. As to what takes place on the
western or northern frontier, we have no
information, and for the present that must be
left out of account. The brick tea trade with
Russian Siberia, I may add, is accounted for
in the Customs Returns.
There are several other items which ought
to be noticed, if a strictly accurate account is
to be taken, between China and Foreign
nations, but I content myself here by merely
indicating them without attempting to strike a
balance between those that make for and
those that make against China. I do so,
firstly, because I have no data that can be
entirely relied upon; and secondly, because,
taking a rough estimate, the one set of items
may be considered as on the whole a fair set-off
against the other.
To the debit of China are the following:—
1. Rents and profits from Foreign capital
invested in China. The value of land alone
within the Foreign Settlement of Shanghai is
estimated at about 20,000,000 taels, and
the buildings thereon may be taken as worth
half as much. This gives a total of 30,000,000
taels, of which perhaps half is owned by
Foreigners resident out of the country, mostly,
of course, in England. Taking interest on this
at 6 per cent, to 7 per cent., we have an annual
sum to be remitted of about 1,000,000 taels on
this head alone. The like profits from other
ports would, of course, swell this considerably.
2. Earnings of Foreign-owned vessels en-
gaged in the coasting trade, so far as divisible
abroad, and remittances for purchase of new
steamers both Foreign and Chinese owned.
3. Expenditure on Chinese Government ac-
count for vessels of war, and for purchase of
arms and munitions of war, for machinery for
Government arsenals, and for expenses con-
nected with Legations and Consulates abroad.
And lastly, there are still small annual pay-
ments to be made in respect of the interest of
unexpired loans. Ido not include the principal
as that would merely be a cross entry.
All these items must amount to a very
considerable sum per annum, but they are
fully balanced by the considerations on the
other side which are :
1. Disbursements in Chinese ports of
Foreign-owned vessels engaged in the inter-
national trade. As no freight is assumed to
be payable in China, an allowance must be
made for ships’ disbursements, tonnage dues,
and repairs while in Chinese waters.
2. Wages and other disbursements of
Foreign men-of-war serving on China station.


3. Salaries and expenses of Foreign Legations
and Consulates in China, as also Salaries and
expenses of Missionaries, no inconsiderable
item.
4. And last, there are the earnings and
savings of Chinese in Foreign ports —San
Francisco, Australia, Java, Manila, the
Straits Settlements, &c., all of which
ultimately find their way to China. This
must be a very large item, and one which is
probably increasing.
It being, however, impossible, with our
present information, to strike any exact balance
between these opposing accounts, I leave them
to stand against each other.
Allowing for the various corrections and
additions in the manner I have indicated, the
balance of trade between China and Foreign
countries presents itself as follows :

The most noticeable features in this table
are these:—
Ist. From 1865 up to 1870 the imports and
exports very nearly balance.
2nd. From 1871 to 1880 there is a uniform
balance in favour of China, indicating a flow of
silver from Europe to China. The total amount
of silver thus absorbed would appear to be about
100,000,000 taels, of a sterling- value of
30,000,000/. The value of the tael fell in
those 10 years continuously from 6j. B d. in
1872, to sj. B d. in 1880.
3rd. During- the period from 1881 to 1887,
the imports, and exports again approximately
balance, and from 1888 to date there has been
an adverse balance against China, amounting
in the aggregate to about 32,000,000 taels,
and indicating a corresponding drain of one
or other of the precious metals from China.
The value of the tael was approximately
steady from 1879 to 1884 at s*. yd. From
1884 to 1892 it has fallen continuously from
ss. yd. to 4-y. 4 d. It is thus impossible to trace
any direct relation between the value of the
tael and the proportion between imports and
exports.
No sufficient data are obtainable for a
reliable return of the import and export of
treasure so as to check the accuracy of these
figures, prior to 1888. Since that year,
however, statistics of the movement of bullion
and specie between China and Foreign
countries have been published by the Customs
authorities, and I present in the following
table a summary of the net result:—

The small discrepancy between the two sides
of the account may, I think, be easily explained
by ascribing it to the increased earnings of the
crowds of Chinese who now find profitable
employment in Singapore, Penang, and the

other settlements of the Malayan Peninsula.
In speaking - of the subordinate matters which
enter into the account for and against China, I
assumed that they mutually balanced. But it
may well be that there is, on the whole, a
balance in favour of China arising from the
remittances of her emigrants, and that this
enters the country as merchandise and not as
treasure. As the figures stand, China appears
to have got some 8,500,000 taels in the 5 years
more than she has paid for, and the sugges-
tion is that she pays for it in this way, viz.: by
using the savings of her subjects abroad which
would otherwise come as treasure.
It is thus apparent that, though the foregoing
tables do not accurately balance, they mutually
confirm each other, and fully establish two
facts
Ist. That China has taken no silver off the
European market for a number of years, and,
2nd. That there has been a small but in-
creasing flow of gold from China to Europe.
By way of further illustrating the move-
ments of the precious metals as between China
and Foreign countries, I present a summary of
an unofficial return which has been furnished
me by one of the banks in Hongkong, showing
the imports into and exports from Hongkong of
specie and bullion for the years 1884-92.
This return considers Hongkong as forming
one group with China, which indeed for statistical
purposes it may be deemed to be, and takes
note only of gold or silver coming into Hongkong
from Foreign countries, or leaving Hongkong
for Foreign countries.

This return must not be taken for more than
it is intended, viz. : a rough estimate of the
amount of specie or bullion entering and
leaving China by way of Hongkong. It does
not purport to represent the whole movement
of the precious metals between China (including
Hongkong) and Foreign countries, because a
great deal is imported direct into Shanghai
both from Europe and America, and it is on
this point that statistics are wanting prior to
1888. But taking the return as far as it goes,
it does seem to confirm the conclusion already
come to, viz.: that China has not been, for
the last 10 years, an importer of silver to any
appreciable extent.
This will probably appear surprising to
many and contrary to what might reasonably
have been expected in view of the great fall in
the price of silver, but the facts seem too strong
to admit of any other conclusion. Why it
should be so I cannot otherwise explain than by
saying that the Chinese are ready and willing
customers for our mannfactures to the full ex-
tent of their means, and even a little over.
Their own exports have grown fairly well, as
will be seen by a reference to the foregoing table,
but their imports have fully kept pace. They
invest all the proceeds of what they sell in
Foreign wares, and they have, in addition,
been sending a good deal of gold and a small
amount of silver to pay for their purchases.
The amount of gold sent out of the country
during the last ten or fifteen years must be
considerable, and it is a question of some in-
terest to ascertain where it comes from. A
certain quantity is simply a re-export of gold
sovereigns brought by returned emigrants
from San Francisco and Australia, but the
bulk of it is a genuine export of the country
itself. So far as we know no gold mines are
now worked to any extent within the bounds
of China Proper. A small amount finds its
way down from the Russo-Siberian frontier
and from certain gold washiugs in the Amoor
River, but that cannot be much.
The gold for export comes mainly from the
private hoards of wealthy Chinese where it
may have been for generations in the shape of
bracelets, hair-pins and other ornaments,
being tempted out by the unprecedentedly
high price now paid for it. There is also a
considerable amount of gold in the shape of
bars which pass especially in the north as an
article of commerce. It is said that one of
the principal uses to which such bars are put
is to sc r e as the medium in which presents
are made to high officials.


In one form or other a very considerable
amount of gold exists in China, and I appre-
hend that there will be, so loug as the present
rate of exchange lasts, a continuous export to
Europe.
2. Purchasing Power oe Silver.
I now come to the second of the questions I
proposed to discuss, viz., the endeavour to
ascertain whether the prices of commodities
in China have altered during the last 20
years ; in other words, whether the purchasing
power of silver has varied with the varying
exchange.
To illustrate this I have compiled three
tables of prices of commodities, which are
hereto appended and marked A, B, and C.
The first, Table A, comprises articles which
are exclusively, or principally both produced
and consumed in China.
The second, Table B, comprises articles pro-
duced in China, but destined for the most
part for Foreign consumption.
The third, Table C, comprises articles pro-
duced abroad but consumed in China.
The prices given in Table A are compiled
from Customs values, and are, as far as possible,
the prices at the ports of production. The
prices in Tables B and C are compiled either
from Customs values or from Chamber of Com-
merce price lists and other contemporaneous
market reports. All three tables are, I believe,
as accurate as the nature of the case will
allow. At all events, they represent beyond
dispute the general tendency of prices, spread
over a series of- years.
An examination of those tables will, I think,
establish the following conclusions :
1. As regards articles which are both
produced and consumed in China, silver prices
have on the whole tended to decline. There
is a moderate rise in a few articles, principally
food stuffs, but all over there is a decline of
about 9 per cent.
2. As regards articles of Native origin
exported to Foreign countries, the silver
price has not advanced with the fall in
exchange. Prices, on the whole, are almost
exactly on the level of the years 1870 to 1874.
3. As regards articles of Foreign manufac-
ture or production imported for sale in China,
the average price in silver has deolined very
considerably.
Chinese can now obtain their supplies at a
less cost even in silver than they could 20
years ago by some 26 per cent.
In other words, the purchasing power of
silver has not declined in respect to any of
the classes of commodities, and has even con-
siderably increased in respect of the first and
last classes.
The purchasing power of gold, on the other
hand—that is its local market value—has
steadily advanced with every successive fall in
the rates of exchange on London, till now 4s.
will purchase what formerly required 6s. 6d.,
or 60Z. will now do what used to require 100 Z.
This is best illustrated by putting the gold
and silver prices side by side as follows :
The several quantities of commodities enu-
merated in the tables could have been bought
as below.

As regards Table A the result arrived at
will not appear surprising. The only way, it
would seem, in which Foreign trade or the
fluctuations of Foreign exchanges can affect
internal prices, i.e., prices of articles which
are not in demand for Foreign trade, is by
drawing away or bringing in one or other of
the precious metals. If the result of Foreign
trade is to cause a flow of silver into or out of
the country, the value or the purchasing power
of silver will tend to fall or rise as the case
maybe, and so with gold. But, as we have
seen, there has been no great addition to the
stock of silver in China during the period
under review, and consequently we ought not
to expect a general rise in prices. The fluc-
tuations which we find in the prices of com-
modities in Table A can, indeed, be shown to
coincide closely with the greater or less supply
of silver. From 1870 to 1880 there was a
continuous favourable balance of trade, indicat-
ing a flow of silver into China.


Accordingly we find there is during this
period a tendency of prices to advance. From
1880 onwards there has been no silver coming
to China, and as without this extraneous
supply the stock in the country is insufficient
to meet the growing wants of commerce, the
price of commodities tends to fall.
As regards Table B, the conclusions to be
drawn from that are more perplexing.
Given an equilibrium of prices at any time
between a silver-using and gold-using country,
say, between China and England, any subse-
quent fall in the gold price of silver must, it
would seem, have in respect to exports from
China one or other of three results. It must
either raise the price to the Chinese producer,
or it must lower the price to the English con-
sumer, or the difference must remain as profit
in the pockets of the middlemen.
The last alternative is of course excluded as
a permanent result. The immediate effect of
a fall is no doubt to enable the merchant to rea-
lize a better profit on merchandise at the time
in transit, but competition quickly puts an end
to this. As between the other two alternatives
one would be disposed to say “a priori” that
the larger market would rule and that the gold
price would tend to remain steady, leaving the
adjustment to be made at the other side. In
that case the silver price in China must rise.
But it does not appear to be so. It is,
I believe, a well-known fact in the commercial
world, that it is always much easier to lower
prices than to raise them. If you can afford
to go down a \d. a bargain is much more
easily struck than if you are bound to stand out
for a rise of a \d. It would seem then to be
a general rule that adjustments following on a
fall of exchange are always made along the line
of least resistance, and that therefore it is
not the China price that rises, but the Loudon
price that falls. Merchants operating on the
usual principles find it easier to buy Asiatic
produce at the old prices and sell it in Loudon
at a concession, than to stand out for old
prices at home, in order to be able to pay more
to the producei.
The experience of the last 20 years shows
that with every fall in the gold price of silver,
there has invariably been a simultaneous
lowering in the gold price of commodities in
Europe. This has variously been ascribed to
the scarcity of gold or to the greater strain
thrown upon existing stocks by its extended
use, or to a reduction in the cost of production,
but • may it not be ascribed principally or
entirely to the competition of the produce of
silver-usiug countries? If it is a fact that
there has been no general rise in the silver
price of produce in ludia and China and other
silver-using countries, or a less rise than the
fall in silver should produce, then the gold
price of such produce when imported into
Europe must necessarily have fallen with the
fall in exchange.
From this point of view it is really silver
that rules the world ; it is the purchasing
power of the cheaper metal that determines
the price all over. Just as in a bi-metallic
country the cheaper metal will drive out the
dearer towards her mono-metallic neighbours,
so, as between countries of different standards,
will the prices prevailing in the country of the
cheaper metal drag down prices all over to
their own level. And reasoning forward from
the experience of the past, it would not, per-
haps, be too rash to conclude that prices of
commodities in Europe, so far as these can be
drawn in -any fair quantity from silver-using
countries, must continue to decline with every
further fall in silver.
3. Volume of Expobts.
In regard to the third matter of inquiry
which I proposed to discuss, viz., how far the
fall in silver has stimulated exports from
China, an answer has in effect been supplied
by the foregoing remarks. There has been a
stimulus, but not such a stimulus as might
have been expected. The stimulus has been
a readiness on the part of Foreign merchants
to buy Native produce of all sorts at current
quotations, but not the stimulus which comes
from offering higher prices.
Such as it is, however, it has developed the
exports very considerably, especially within the
last few years. In 1872 the exports of China
stood in value approximately as follows :

Tea has always figured so prominently as
one of the products of Cbiua, that it could not
be omitted from auy list of exports, but the
causes operating of late years to effect both
its price and the volume of the export have
been so exceptional that it ought not, perhaps,
to be included iu a table from which it is
sought to draw general conclusions. As will
be seen, both the price and the quantity have
fallen off very much, owing, of course, to the
Indian competition. If tea, i e., black tea, to
which aloue these remarks apply, were ex-
cluded from Table B, the figures then would
indicate a small general rise of prices.-
The price of raw silk has shown a tendency
to decline, but silk has lately recovered,
and now stands at about the level of 1873.
The average value of China manufactured
silk has advauced slightly, aud the export
lias more than trebled.
The prices of straw braid and wool have
advauced some 15 per ceut. or l(j per cent.,
with a large increase of export; but, on the
of her band, the price of raw cotton, the export
of which has grown more than that of any-
thing else, has been steady, aud the prices of
tobacco, paper, aud sugar, all of which show
a large growth of export, have all gone down.
It may, however, be remarked that these are
not exports to Europe, but to silver-using
countries such as Japan, Singapore, &c., aud
so ought rather to be classed with domestic
trade.
It is thus difficult to formulate any general
rule as to a relation between prices and volume
of export, but it may be said that ou the whole,
leaving tea out of account, there has been a
small advance in silver prices of articles sent
to gold-using countries, and to this extent there
has been a direct stimulus to exports. There
seems every reason to expect that this
tendency will be greatly enhanced in the
near future, in view of the recent action of
the Indian Government in tixing the value of
the rupee in gold, which will probably have
the double effect of still further depreciating
silver and of limiting the silver using area
whence produce can be drawn for the Euro-
pean markets. Whenever silver falls below
the normal line of Is. 4 d. for the rupee, Indian
produce will, it would seem, be unable to com-
pete on the old terms with that of China.
The area of cheaper produce being thus nar-
rowed, it is probable that the price in London
will not continue to fall or will not fall so
much, and that will necessarily mean enhanced
prices in China and an increased export.
It unfortunately happens that, outside of
tea and silk, China does not produce many
articles that are of universal demand. Her
one great industry is agriculture, but agricul-
ture to supply her own wants. The export of
rice, wheat, and cereals of all kinds, except
peas and beans, is absolutely forbidden. If
this were otherwise, it is probable that the
exports of China might grow very fast, but
as things are, I do not look for any very rapid
expansion.
It follows, therefore, that it is impossible to
expect that China will, under present circum-
stances, become a great consumer of silver.
The conditions of the last few years which
have made. China an absolute exporter of
silver are doubtless abnormal. Under ordin-
ary circumstances, China ought to be an im-
porter, but, of course, she cannot get silver
uuless she gives value for it in some form or
other. Her power of absorbing silver is mea-
sured by the difference between the value of
her exports and imports, and unless the former
outvalue the latter, there is nothing left for
her to receive. I see no reason to suppose
that China will, until things are greatly
altered, take the place of India as an absorber
of silver.
But the undeveloped capacities of the
country are enormous, and if the Government
would only allow merchants a free hand in the
matter of railways and manufactures, the trade
of China might soon outrival that of India.
There is probably no country in the world
where capital is so much wanted, and where
it could be used with greater benefit both to
the borrower and the lender.


The amount of silver in the country is, I
believe, surprisingly small. Here in Shanghai,
which is the commercial metropolis, the stock
at any given time, whether in Foreign or Native
hands, seldom exceeds 3,000,000 taels, and is
often much less.
At Soochow and Hangchow, and other large
inland centres, the estimate is usually much
less than that, and in the country at large, and
even in populous towns and villages, silver is
rarely seen at all. Interest is high—running
from 5 per cent, to 12 per cent.—and that not
on account of insecurity, but because the
borrower can use the capital to such advantage
as to make it worth his while to pay it.
General Conclusions.
Viewing the situation from the Chinamau’s
point of view, he finds that his tael or ounce of
silver is just as valuable to him as it ever was.
He can buy the same amount of all the ordin-
ary necessaries of life for the sarae'money as
formerly, and of Foreign articles he can buy
a great deal more. If he has things to sell to
the Foreigner, he can usually get rather a
better price than he used to get, and he finds
the Foreigner mostly ready to buy, always
excepting tea. His wages, rent, and taxes
have remained unaltered, as has also the price
of land. He can get the same interest on his
spare capital if he has any.
The only thing greatly changed is the
price which Foreigners are willing to pay for
gold, and their strong desire to get it.
Formerly the price of gold was 15 to 16
ounces weight of silver for one of gold, aud
there was not much demand for it. Now
there is a universal desire to get it and send it
out of the country at prices which have
gradually risen from 16 taels to 18, 20, 24,
and even 30 taels fur 1 tael’s weight of gold.
Reverting to the questions which I pro-
posed to myself at the outset of this paper,
the conclusions may be thus summarised :
1. China has not been witbiu the memory
of the present generation, a great absorber of
silver. From 1870 to 1880 she did take otf
about 3,000,000 Z. per annum, but since 1880
this process has ceased, and there has even
been of late years a slight export.
2. (a) The fall in the gold price of silver
appears to have produced no effect on the
general level of prices of articles produced and
consumed in China.
(b) As regards articles produced in China
and commonly exported to gold-using countries
there is a slight tendency to a general rise.
This will probably be enhanced in the near
future.
3. The fall in the price of silver has
stimulated exports by making it possible for
Foreign merchants to purchase and export at a
profit a large variety of miscellaneous articles
which formerly would have yielded no return
at all. The value of such miscellaneous articles
has quadrupled within the last ten years. Tea
has declined very largely both in volume and
price, but for this there are special reasons.
Raw silk of best quality has increased some-
what in volume, but not iu price. There has
been a great increase in the quantity of waste
and refuse silk exported, but the price has
somewhat declined.
A continued growth in the exports of China
is to be expected, but under present conditions
it cannot attain to great dimensions. As the
capability of China to absorb silver depends
upon the excess of her exports over her im-
ports, there is no reason to expect that China
will, within the next few years at all events,
take large quantili s silver otf the European
market.
