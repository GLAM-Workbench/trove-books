THE
TOTALISATOR.
" THE INSTRUMENT
CAN’T LIE."


THE
PATENT TOTALISATOR
AT the last meeting of the Australian Jockey
Club at Randwick two strange sights were seen.
On the grass, smoking and chaffing each other,
lay many noted bookmakers. No longer, as of
old, were their brazen voices heard screaming
the odds on each race, their diamond-ringed
fingers jotting down bets at every minute, the
day being all too short for the business of gain
which they pursued with such fevered haste.
Strange indeed that the Ring-men should find
their occupation gone!
The explanation of this was to he found in a
corner of the Saddling Paddock where, around
a temporary wooden office, hundreds thronged
and, depositing their sovereigns, received
tickets in exchange, each bearing a number.
These numbers were identical with those on
the official programme, everyone selecting that
opposite the name of his favourite horse. By
an instrument hanging in the office, the total of
subscribers, and the amount invested on each
number were instantaneously recorded. This
was the celebrated “ Totalisator Sweepstakes,”
which for the second time was being so liberally
patronized at Randwick. This was the cause
of the enforced idleness and the curses of the


bookmakers. The sequel is now being played
out at the Water Police Court, where Mr.
Siegfried Franck is summoned to answer six
informations laid against him by the Police,
that he “ being the occupier of an office, &c.,
&c.,” did receive certain money, and did
promise to pay certain sums “on the happen-
ing of a certain event relating to a horse race.”
That the public may fully understand the
facts of the case, and the reason of the present
prosecution, almost amounting to persecution,
which Mr. Franck is enduring, the writer of
this pamphlet has carefully made himself mas-
ter of all the details and the evidence tendered
on each side, and he now presents this to the
Australian public as an appeal to their sense of
justice. The following plain statement will
fully show that this is a case where trickery and
fraud are brought together against honesty and
fair play.
Mr. Franck is a well-known and respected
citizen of Sydney. He has resided here for 26
years, and for 15 of these he was Consul for the
German Empire. During a recent visit to
Europe his attention became directed to the
fact that the Continental Governments encoura-
ged, under various names, “ Totalisator Sweep-
stakes.” In Mr. Franck’s own words in one of
his circulars he states as the reason for this:—
“ Ist.—Jockeys will no longer be tampered
with, the proprietor of the Totalisator being
always indifferent as to which horse wins:
which must support fair and honest racing.
“ 2 ;id.—To dimish the heavy betting on credit,
by which many men have lost fortunes, resul-
ting in suicide, robbing of banks and other


employers, to save their names being dis-
honoured ; because bookmakers have, in all
parts of the world, the preference over trades-
men. And whoever does not pay on the settling
night the amount lost to the bookmakers is
liable to have his name publicly posted as a
defaulter. And as every visitor to a racecourse
likes to have some tangible interest in the
result of a race, such disasters are avoided by
joining the Totalisator Sweepstake, where no-
body can invest more money than he brought
with him for that purpose.”
Hundreds, ay thousands, of cases might be
cited in England and the Colonies showing how
men in all ranks of life, from the duke to the
bank clerk, have been ruined and dishonoured
for life by reckless betting on credit. “ Plung-
ing ” heavily with the hope that their favourite
might win, the dreaded “ settling night ” and
the fear of being “ posted ” as defaulters have
caused many to commit crimes to obtain the
money to satisfy the leeches of the Turf.
Mr. Franck was so impressed with the ad-
vantages to the public, and to himself, of the
Totalisator that he determined to introduce it
into Australia ; but he first took the opinion of
a celebrated lawyer, who is also a Member of
Parliament, and who has a special knowledge of
these subjects, having assisted in framing the
“ Betting Act.” The reply of that gentleman
being that the Totalisator would be perfectly
legal, Mr. Franck took out the patent right of
this instrument for the colonies, and it was
first exhibited by him at the Association Ground
on the occasion of the cricket match played by
the Australian Eleven against fifteen of New


South Wales in December last. Considerable
attention and curiosity was caused amongst the
spectators at this novelty.
Mr. Franck then obtained permission from
the Committee of the Australian Jockey
Club to use the Totalisator at the meeting
on 18th January last. On the 17th of
January Mr. Franck was attacked in a
paragraph in the S. M. Herald. He con-
sequently called on Mr. Fairfax and remon-
strated with him on the unfairness of this,
but could obtain no redress. Anxious always'
to act fully within the law, Mr. Franck then
took the opinion of two other well-known legal
gentlemen. Their reply was favourable, and
they advised Mr. Franck to ask the Inspector-
General of Police to examine the instrument,
and also to give him full information. Mr.
Fosberry was accordingly waited upon, and
being told the opinion of the three lawyers,
was requested to call at the office and view the
“ Totalisator.” He did not, however, do so, but
subsequently saw the instrument publicly
worked at Randwick on 18th January.
At this meeting, the Totalisator proved a
great success. Strange to say, the S. M. Herald
gave a sneering report of its workings. The
Evening News gave the following very fair
account, written by the well-known sporting
authority and scribe, “ Pegasus ” :
“ But within the paddock there was one
new feature, which seems likely to become
very popular, and to take a considerable hold
on the speculative public. This was the ‘ To-
talisator, ’ lately introduced from Germany by
Mr. Siegfried Franck, on which the importer
operated before each race, to the evident satis


faction of those who patronised him. An
attempt had been made, a day or two before,
in the S. M. Herald, to bring this machine
into disrepute, and on Saturday the book-
makers set their faces dead against it; but
having had the whole working explained to
me, I’m convinced there’s nothing fairer in the
world. The odds being much longer than what
bookmakers lay, of course the public will
patronise Mr. Franck and his Totalisator, and
consequently the ring will have a proportionate
down upon the innovation; hut, at any rate,
I heard everybody expressing satisfaction after
giving the thing a trial. One feature of the
wagering on Mr. Franck’s plan is, that suppose
the race to be won by some horse that nobody
has backed, the money is returned to the sub-
scribers, less 10 per cent., 5 per cent, com-
mission being charged under any other circum-
stances, and this is a feature which would he
highly satisfactory to those who invest in the
chances of this generally useful scorer, reckoner,
and calculator.”
The next proceeding in the line of perse-
cution against Mi. Franck was indeed a strange
one. In the Parliamentary report of the S. M.
Herald for January 23rd, we read :
“ Mr. Terry said that a deputation of book-
makers had to-day called his attention to the
use of the Totalisator in the Saddling Pad-
dock of the Randwick racecourse, which, if not
an infringement of the Betting Act was, at any
rate, a breach of the Vagrant Act, and he con-
demned the conduct of the Inspector-General
of Police in allowing this thing to be used. In
England, France, and America, stringent mea


sures had been adopted to prevent the use of this
instrument, which was merely a game of chance.”
“ A deputation of bookmakers! ” And a
Member of Parliament who would receive them,
and afterwards act as their mouthpiece ! Re-
presentative Government is indeed dragged
through the mire when such things can occur.
It is sufficient to chronicle the fact, without
those criticisms thereon, which, until the
Parliamentary Privileges Bill is passed, we
might with safety indulge in. Mr. Terry was
absolutely wrong when he said that on the
Continent and in America “ stringent measures
had been adopted to prevent the use of this
instrument.” It is legalised and encouraged in
those countries. But the bookmakers’ repre-
sentative was hound to make a case on behalf
of his constituents. In spite of this Parlia-
mentary froth, the police took no proceedings
against Mr. Franck, who was now perfectly
satisfied that the instrument which he
had spent so much time and money to intro-
duce into the colonies, would prove legally
beneficial to the sporting public of Australia.
On the 7th of February Mr. Franck forwarded
a circular to every member of Parliament, and
the police were not directed to take any steps
thereon. The following is an extract: —

Result of Ist Totalisator Sweepstake, introduced in Australia, on the 18 th
January, 1879, in the Randwick Saddling Paddock at the Australian Jockey
Club Meeting :—


This circular so plainly showed the advan-
tages of the Totalisator as a public sweepstakes
that the members of the Betting Ring saw
that their ancient prosperity and glory were
passing away. On April 10th, at a meeting of
a well-known betting club called “ Tatter-
sail’s” the members passed a resolution that
the use of the Totalisator was “ contrary
to the true interests of sport.” “ Sport,”
to the minds of bookmakers, mostly means only
plenty of dupes to fleece. The Committee of the
Australian Jockey Club was requested not to al-
low the Totalisator to be used again, but fortu-
nately this Committee consists of gentlemen who
recognize the great advantage to the public in
these Sweepstakes, and they granted permission
to have the instrument worked again at the
Autumn Meeting.
But in consequence of sinister threats made
to Mr. Franck he again called on Mr. Fosberry,
and begged him if he had any doubt of the
legality of the Totalisator, according to the
expressed opinion of the three lawyers, to have
the question tested before the Autumn Races.
Detective Lyons received from Mr. Franck full
information as to the instrument, and circulars
descriptive of the working thereof. Afterwards
Mr. Fosberry was waited upon and asked if he
was satisfied as to the legality of the Totalisa-
tor, to which he replied that he did not think
it was legal, and that he would test the case
after the instrument had again been worked on
a race-course, as he required witnesses who had
purchased tickets. Mr. Franck, desiring not to
do anything illegal, offered to bring forward a
dozen witnesses who purchased tickets on 18th


January, and also to make an affidavit as to the
workings of the instrument. But Mr. Fosberry
declined the offer, and said that he must test
the case after the meeting.
After all these straightforward proceedings
of Mr. Franck, he was served with five summon-
ses on information laid by two detectives, to
appear before the Police Court in reference to
sweepstakes made up at Eandwick Autumn
Meeting by him. On the Ist of May (the
second day of hearing before the magistrates,
when the case was adjourned to the Bth May),
before Mr. Frank left the Court, he received a
sixth summons on same charge.
Is this Prosecuting or Persecuting ?
Is there an influence at work in our midst,
subtle, and dangerous, and powerful, which
poisons the minds and morals of the people ?
Is there a body which can pervert Parliament,
Press, and Police ? It would almost seem that the
Betting Ring has the power. The bookmakers
have their spokesman in the House. They dic-
tate to bodies of gentlemen like the Committee
of the Australian Jockey Club; they appa-
rently set the police in motion in this case,
and they influence the Press—the highly
immaculate Press of Sydney; The Sydney
Morning Herald, which is edited by broken-
down parsons, and always pretends to “ unco’
godliness,” yet keeps a “ tout,” and faith-
fully chronicles the betting markets, adver-
tising the bookmakers in that respect —this
godly paper, which assumes to detest gambling,
and even dared to lecture our late esteemed
Governor, Sir Hercules Robinson, for his love


of sport, is yet in this case of Mr. Franck’s an
ally and accomplice of the members of the
Betting Ring.
The proof of this is that on three occasions
the S. M. Herald has published accusations in
the shape of paragraphs and letters against Mr.
Franck and the Totalisator, and has refused to
insert his advertisement showing the fairness of
the proceedings at the late meeting at Rand-
wick. The S. M. Herald will advertise the
bookmakers free of charge by quoting their
betting, and will not insert anything in favour
of the Totalisator, which, if thoroughly worked
(a consummation devoutly to be wished!) would
ruin the Ring.
On the opposite page is the advertisement re-
fused by the S. M. Herald and the Echo, and
which appeared in the Evening News of April
23rd

The Evening News, however, on April 23rd,
the case being first heard at the Water Police
Court on April 24th, contained a very sneering,
if not libellous paragraph against Mr. Franck.
The trail of the bookmaker is perceptible
throughout the whole Press of Sydney. “ Pega-
sus ” alone has spoken the truth on this subject.
To whose interest is it that Mr. Franck
should be thus persecuted, and the Totalisator
declared illegal ?
Is it generally known that in Sydney and
Melbourne there are more than 200 book-
makers, who travel about to almost every race
in the colonies ? At the most moderate com-
putation this must entail an expenditure of
£4OO a-year each. Many spend thousands a-
year. This amounts to £BO,OOO per annum,
and as the bookmakers are nearly always able
to pay their bets, when they lose, it proves that
the public is yearly bled to the extent of
£BO,OllO- But if such au amount had been
invested in Totalisator Sweepstakes, the public
would have saved about £76,000- The differ-
ence has been netted by those parasites of sport
whose characters are so well known to the public.
It is to support these that Mr. Franck is perse-
cuted !
The prospectus printed at the end of this
pamphlet fully explains the action of the
Totalisator. It is in fact nothing but an
ingenious marking-board, almost the same in
principle as the books kept by secretaries of
all racing clubs in the colonies. This marking
board has been used at the two last cricket
matches for scoring, to the great satisfaction of
the public, and is also useful for many other
purposes, as stated at foot of the prospectus.


Every Racing Club in the colonies has seve-
ral sweepstakes in its list of “ events.” These are
made up beforehand for horse races to be de-
cided thereafter, and each club has an office for
the purpose of receiving sweepstakes money.
Each club is compensated by entrance fees at
gate, charge of admission to saddling paddock,
letting grounds for booths to publicans, cater-
ers, &c. What is the difference between
Totalisator sweepstakes and race club sweep-
stakes ? Both do the same thing; but one is
paid by a 5 per cent, commission, and the
other by charging admission fees. Sweepstakes
are made up in public houses amongst the
friends of the competitors in rowing matches and
race programmes contain perforated numbers
and names of horses for the drawing of sweep-
stakes.
Sweepstakes are thus recognised by law and
custom, as being perfectly legal. There can,
then, be neither reason nor justice in charging
Mr. Franck with committing a crime in being
a holder of money in a public sweepstakes to
decide the merits of horses running in another
sweepstakes organised by the Secretary of the
Australian Jockey Club, and for which Mr.
Clibborn has received the money.
It has been suggested that the Totalisator
might be manipulated to the prejudice of the
public. This suggestion was made by an in-
former, a low-class betting man; but the
perusal of the prospectus will show that this is
impossible. When a race starts, there stands
the Totalisator, the figures telling to each man
what he will receive in the evenUof his horse
winning. As a fact nearly all the winners in
the sweepstakes at Eandwick had calculated


out, and marked on their tickets, what they
should receive. The working is simplicity
itself, and “ the instrument can’t lie.” Mr.
Franck offers £IOO to anyone who can falsify the
Totalisator, if practised according to prospectus.
Ought not rather the authorities in Austra-
lia to thank the introducer of the Totalisator
instead of persecuting him ? The instrument
will tend to ruin the betting ring-—the greatest
curse of modern sport. It will return to the
pockets of the public thousands of pounds
yearly, which now go to keep in wanton luxury
and riot those kings of the bagnio and pot-
house, who are members of that ring. It will
put a stop to plunging and heavy betting, and
it is a legal method of acquiring an interest in
a race. For according to the testimony of
gentlemen in high position, who have recently
returned from England, the Totalisators are
allowed on race-courses there. They are legal-
ised on the Continent and in America, and it is
not to he supposed that the Totalisator will be
condemned here.
There is not the slightest doubt that Mr.
Franck will get justice at the Water Police
Court, hut he deserves public sympathy and
support for his honest and fair endeavours to
purify the sport of this colony—for which be
has, as yet, only been persecuted as a criminal.
No doubt he will he rewarded, as all inventors
and originaters should he rewarded, but his
greatest claim to the public thanks will he
that he has substituted for the present extor-
tionate system of hookmaking, an easy, honest
and practicable method of investing in sweep-
stakes which will benefit the many instead of
the few.


PROSPECTUS AND EXPLANATION OF
TOTALISATOR SWEEPSTAKES.
Shares will be issued in sums of £1 and £5
each, and an unlimited amount may he invested
upon any Number; the Numbers on the
Totalisator answering to those on the Pro-
gramme.
Upon receipt of Subscription a Ticket will
be given for the number applied for, and the
amount of Shares taken at once marked on the
Totalisator against the number chosen ; the
total amount of the Sweepstakes being, by the
mechanism of this patent invention, simulta-
neously recorded, so that no misunderstanding
can arise.
The Sweepstakes is p.p. and goes with the
prize.
The whole amount of the Sweepstakes, less 5
per cent, commission, will be ratably divided
between the Shareholders of the winning
number ; but no fraction of a shilling will be
paid.
If a blank number wins, 18s. in the £ will be
returned to each shareholder.
No tickets will be issued for any race after
the horses have started.
Immediately on the start a check will be
put upon the Totalisator, and a copy of its
record hung up beside the instrument, which
will remain unaltered for five minutes after
the winning horse's number has been posted.
Payment will be made one hour after the
decision of the race, or if possible sooner.


In the case of a dead heat not ran off, one
half of the amount will be apportioned to each
of the winning numbers, and then ratably
divided amongst the several Shareholders of
each number.
It is distinctly understood that the under-
signed accepts the money as the applicant's
agent and stakeholder, and that as soon as the
amount of the Sweepstakes has been distributed
under the above regulations, all further respon-
sibility ceases.
The Totalisator is also commended as being
valuable to Hotel Keepers in checking con-
sumption and cash receipts; checking gate-
keepers at public entertainments, discharging
and receiving cargoes of merchandise, receipt
and delivery of bonded stocks and merchants
goods, ballot papers at elections, passenger
traffic by steamers, omnibuses, or railways, and
scoring at cricket matches, &c., &c.
The patent right of the Totalisator has been
purchased by the undersigned for all countries
south of the equator, and also secured to him in
these Colonies.
