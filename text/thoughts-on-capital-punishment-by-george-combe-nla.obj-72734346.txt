THOUGHTS
CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.
In the Scotsman of the 9th and 30th May and the 13th
June 1846, a series of articles appeared on ? The Use of Ca-
pital Punishment;? and as they embodied in a clear, calm,
and logical form, an able defence of the existing practice, I
beg to offer some remarks in reply to them. The articles
bear the signature M., and, for the sake of brevity, I shall re-
fer to them under this designation ; but it is proper to say,
that they were not written by Mr Maclaren, the editor of the
paper.
M., then, ? entirely lays aside all claim on the part of so-
ciety to inflict vengeance? on criminals ; but he agrees with
Beccaria, that ? the true end of all punishment should be to
prevent others from committing the like offence.? This last
we consider to be an erroneous principle. It is discussed,
and in our opinion refuted, by Mr Hurlbut in his Essays on
Human Eights , p. 23. M. resolves the right of society to
punish, into ? the right of self-defence??coupled with which,
he says, ? it is a high and important object, also, to promote
the reformation of the criminal.? In these propositions I cor-
dially agree with him. After stating that we are bound to
select the best protection to innocent life ? (which also is
granted), he proceeds in these words?? Taking human na-
ture as it actually exists, and applying a rule which is to be
operative not merely on this or that eccentric individual, but
upon the congregated thousands which make up a nation,
the terror of a sentence of death will operate more to restrain,
than the terror of any other punishment. There is, in truth,
something like the universal consent of all mankind?at least
of all unsophisticated men?to this position.? If this proposi-


tion were sound, the whole question would be settled; hut I sub-
mit, that even if there were something like the universal con-
sent of all mankind to the proposition, it might still be open to
legitimate doubt; for the day was, when the same universal
consent declared the earth and moon to be flat?the earth to
be thousands of times larger than the sun ?the globe to be
stationary?and the sun, moon, and stars to revolve round it;
every one of which propositions is nevertheless false, and is
now abandoned by all who have enjoyed the benefit of a scien-
tific education, to enable them to correct the first impressions
of their unaided senses. Science may enable us to correct
also the first impressions of our emotional faculties. The
law of retaliation ?an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth
unquestionably received the ? universal consent of all man-
kind? in their first stage of civilization. It was dictated
by the natural impulse of revenge, along with rude notions
of justice; but more profound and elevated views of the na-
ture of man have induced it's to abrogate this law. It ap-
pears to me, that the universal consent of mankind (supposing
it to exist) in regard to the efficacy of death-punishment, is
founded, like the law of retaliation, on certain instinctive
emotions of the mind, which are universal because they are
natural ; but that it does not necessarily follow, that all the
actions to which they prompt us are on that account either
ethically sound or practically useful.
M. proceeds to say that ? there is nothing which all men
have so thoroughly in common as the boon of life, to which
all alike, by the very condition of their nature and their ani-
mal instinct, cling with equal tenacity , from the richest to the
poorest, and from the youngest to the oldest of mankind.?
If this proposition, also, were well-founded, it would power-
fully support the other two; but in fact it is an assumption
that will not bear the scrutiny of reason. The real state of
the case appears to me to be the following.
The love of life is one among many feelings which are in-
herent in the human mind. It is universal, because it forms
an element in our being; but it is not equally sti ong in
all individuals. There is reason to believe that there is a
special organ for this feeling, which in different individuals
differs in its size relatively to the other organs : But be this as
it may, any one who will inquire among a pretty wide circle
of persons for an account of their consciousness in this re-
spect, will learn that in some the feeling is so strong as to
amount almost to a passion, while in others it is moderate,
and in others feeble. . . ? . .. ri
Farther : the practical effect of this innate feeling is liable


to be strengthened by some, and to be weakened by other
feelings, which co-exist with it in the mind. I state two ex-
amples, and number them for the sake of reference:?l. If
the emotion of Fear, depending on the organ of Cautiousness,
be naturally strong, and be combined in an individual with a
powerful Love of Life, it will render death in the highest de-
gree appalling to him. Such a man will be a natural coward.
11. If, on the other hand, in another individual, the emotion
of Fear be feeble, the instinctive quality of Courage, depend-
ing on Combativeness, be strong, and the Love of Life be
moderate or feeble, this combination will cause death to ap-
pear to him as a much less formidable evil.
Again: There are still other instinctive emotions in the
mind which, in different individuals, co-exist in different de-
grees of relative strength, and act along with those already
enumerated: for instance, the love of sensual pleasure, depend-
ing on Alimentiveness and Amativeness; the love of gain,
depending on Acquisitiveness; the love of distinction, de-
pending on Love of Approbation; and so forth. Now, does
not the universal experience of mankind prove that the fear
of death has very different effects in restraining different men
from the indulgence of these propensities? For example, the
man possessing the combination No. 1., will abstain from
convivial indulgences, from horse-racing, from quarrelling,
from visiting pestilential climates in quest of gain, and from
many other gratifications to which he might be inclined,
through fear of losing his health and his life ; while the man
with the combination No. 11., will disregard every motive of
prudence founded on the love of health and life, and will pur-
sue the objects of his desire at every hazard. He will think
it even mean and dastardly to be restrained by so contempti-
ble a motive as the fear of death. Common observation so
strongly corroborates the truth of these propositions, that I
do not stop to offer detailed evidence in support of them.
But if they are true, it follows that, in judging of the efficacy
of the punishment of death as a means of deterring from
crime, it is not sufficient to proceed on general assumptions
founded on the supposed universal consent of mankind ; we
must go a little deeper, and inquire into the special combina-
tions of faculties which characterise the criminal mind. A
physician does not prescribe the same remedy for all patients
on mere general principles. He tries to discover the specific
condition of each, and varies his prescriptions according to it.
The administrator of the criminal law must follow the same
rule, and adapt his treatment to the mental condition of each
offender.


When a reflecting medical practitioner reads a statistical
report of deaths from disease in a great city, and perceives
that those from consumption exhibit the same proportion to
the population year after year, what conclusion does he draw \
It is?that in this population a certain number of individuals
have lungs too weak to withstand the injurious influences of
the climate and other noxious agencies which assail them.
The reason why all do not die of consumption is, that some,
the great majority, have lungs that are capable of withstand-
ing these influences. Those who die of other diseases may
have other vital organs weaker than their lungs ; but in them
the lungs, at all events, have been sufficient to resist the hurtful
circumstances to which they have been exposed. Now, when
we find in the statistical reports of any nation, the same number
of robberies, the same number of murders and other crimes,
recurring year after year in the same number of people, as long
as their circumstances continue the same, does not the conclu-
sion follow that there are, out of the whole population, a cer-
tain number of individuals whose moral qualities are not suf-
ficiently strong to resist the temptations to crime presented by
their external circumstances \ In short, does not this shew
that it is only a class of society which is predisposed to crime ?
In no other way can we explain the uniformity of the numbers
of criminals while the circumstances continue unchanged.
It appears to me to be impossible for any reflecting indi-
vidual to read the Essai sur la Statistique Morale de la
France, by Mons. A. M. Guerry (Paris 1832), and M.Quetelet?s
work, Sur V Homme et les developpements de ses Facultes (Paris
1835), or the ordinary statistical reports of crime in this
country, without arriving at this conclusion. M. Quetelet
says :?? This possibility of assigning beforehand the number
of the accused and condemned which should occur in a
country, is calculated to lead to serious reflections, since it
involves the fate of several thousands of human beings, who
are impelled, as it were, by an irresistible necessity, to the
bars of the tribunals, and towards the sentences of condem-
nation which there await them. These conclusions flow di-
rectly from the principle, already so often stated in this work,
that effects are in proportion to their causes, and that the effects
remain the same if the causes which have produced them do not
vary.?
If, then, mental predisposition be the primary cause of
crime, the question presents itself?What is that peculiar
combination of mental qualities which produces, in a certain
proportion of the population, a proclivity to crime \ It is an
undue natural preponderance of the animal propensities, and


an undue deficiency in the native power of the moral or the
intellectual faculties, or of both. This fact has been demon-
strated so thoroughly by evidence recorded in the Phreno-
logical Journal and other works, that I do not stop to repeat
the proof. I need scarcely add, that this combination does
not necessarily produce crime as a specific result, but only
implies strong impulses towards animal indulgences, accom-
panied by weak powers of restraint, in consequence of which
the individual is unable to resist the temptations presented
by unfavourable external circumstances.
Keeping in view, then, the causes of crime, we proceed to
inquire into the relation in which punishment stands to them.
If I am correct in saying that these causes consist in natural
predisposition and the influence of unfavourable circum-
stances, it is obvious that punishment does not tend directly to
remove either. The advocates of death-punishment will pro-
bably admit this proposition ; but they may reply that they
punish offenders with death in order to deter other persons
from offending. This, however, is not a legitimate object of
punishment; but, assuming it to be-so, let us consider the
relation which the infliction of death bears to the object in
view.
Suppose two young men to have weak lungs, and both to
be told that if they indulge in late and protracted convivial
entertainments, and often pass from the heated atmosphere of
a tavern into the chill air of a December night, they will cer-
tainly die ; and suppose, farther, that in one of them the ap-
petite for pleasure is moderate and the reflecting and pru-
dential faculties are strong, while in the other this men-
tal combination is exactly reversed?would the physician?s
threat of death have the same influence on both ? Ob-
viously not. The former would be deterred by it, while the
latter would either disbelieve in it, or recklessly disregard it.
These are not fanciful cases, but pictures of realities which
may be verified by daily observation. The lesson which they
teach is, that in these instances (other things being equal),
the fear of death, as a restraining motive, operates in the
inverse ratio of the force of the temptation.
This illustration is strictly applicable to the case of crime.
In the criminal mind, the love of pleasure (which may
take the form of sexual indulgence, of intoxication, of idle-
ness, of ostentation, or of any other vice), must be plus ,
while the moral or intellectual powers, or both, must be
minus, otherwise he could not become a criminal. The more
intensely powerful the desire of immediate unlawful enjoy-
ment is, and the feebler the moral and intellectual faculties


are in any individual, the more directly and vigorously will
the temptation act on him, and the more feebly will the con-
sideration of contingent evil, even in the form of death, be
calculated to modify his conduct. The punishment threat-
ened is necessarily distant and contingent: ?But the fiercer
the passion, the more thoroughly will it engross the whole
mind with the desire of present gratification ; and the feebler
the moral and reflecting powers, whose function is to consider
duty and to contemplate consequences, the less capable will
the individual be of realising the fear of death and applying
it as a restraining motive.
If these views of the criminal mind are sound, it appears
to follow, Ist, that death-pimishment does not stand towards
crime in the relation of a direct preventive ; and, 2 dip, that as a
means of deterring others, it operates in the inverse ratio of
the danger to avert which it is applied ?that is to say, that
it will effectually deter all favourably-constituted men, or
those who are naturally virtuous and prudent, and on whom
temptation to crime acts feebly ; that it will cast the balance
in favour of virtue in the case of certain individuals in whom
the elements that give power to temptation and those which
lead to resistance are pretty equally poised; and that it
will operate with least effect precisely on those on whom it is
most needed to act powerfully, viz., on such as by nature and
circumstances are most prone to fall before temptation.
These views are supported by the statistics of crime. A
return to the House of Commons, dated 22d May 1846,
shews the number of persons committed for each of seven-
teen different denominations of offences, including robbery,
housebreaking, arson, forgery, rape, and so forth, which
were capital in 1830, but for which the punishment of
death has been abolished by statute, or for which it has not
been inflicted during the last five years. The return includes
two periods of five years each, the one before and the other
after the last execution for each offence. The result is the
following :?During the five years ending with the last year of
an execution, there were committed, 7276 ; executed, 196 indi-
viduals. During the five years immediately following the last
execution, there were committed for the same offences, 7120.
What effect can be ascribed to the fear of the punishment
of death on the persons who committed these crimes. Al-
though the population increased, the aggregate amount of
commitments for the seventeen offences actually diminished
after the punishment of death was abolished; whence we
might infer that the abrogation of that punishment had ope-
rated as a sedative on the criminal mind. But, again, look-
ing at the small amount of the diminution (for the number of


the offences is very nearly the same in both periods), we might
with some degree of plausibility conjecture that the punish-
ment of death had, in these instances, been absolutely in-
operative either for good or evil. Apparently, evil-disposed
persons committed the same number of offences, whether
they incurred the penalty of death or not. These returns, at
all events, support the proposition that the punishment of
death does not stand towards crime in the relation of a pre-
ventive ; for fewer offences were committed after it was abo-
lished than when it was enforced.
Do I mean, then, it may be asked, to propound an absolute
impunity for crime as the result of this reasoning \ Certainly
not; and I proceed to mention the treatment which I pro-
pose. Before doing so, however, let me say, that the punish-
ment of death appears to me to be immoral as well as unne-
cessary. Death with torture is now universally disused ;
a.nd the punishment inflicted is simply the extinction of
life ignominiously. Little importance attaches to the ig-
nominy as a deterring influence ; Ist, because the mind
that will brave death itself, will not be much influenced
by the attendant circumstances; 2 dip, because, by destroy-
ing life, the consciousness of ignominy and of every other
emotion, in this world, is extinguished; and, 3 dly, because
the same amount of ignominy, if it were necessary, mio-ht
easily be inflicted without the accompaniment of death. Sim-
ple death, therefore, remains as the staple of the punish-
ment. Now, by the ordination of God, we are all under the
sentence of death. The clergy admonish us to bear it habi-
tually in mind, and to prepare for it; the warrior is praised
for disregarding it; and the philosopher glories in resigning
himself to it with cheerfulness and equanimity : and I ask*,
On what principle, consistently with these views, can its in-
fliction be justified as a punishment ?as the most terrible of
calamities -as that which is to restrain the reckless, excited,
daring villain, after he has become insensible to all other
earthly motives ? He may tell the jury which convicts him,
and the judge who condemns him, that they also are under
sentence of death, and that the brief space of time which will
elapse between the execution of the sentence on him and
them, is no very formidable consideration to his disadvantage.
Such a remark would be justified by religion, supportedlby
philosophy, and sympathised with by men of courage who
were neither religious nor philosophical. How, then, I ao-ain
ask, can we reconcile such heterogeneous modes of viewing
the most important event of our mortal existence ? If all
who should not be put to death for crime were naturally im-
mortal in this world, I could understand the consistency of


depriving a criminal of life, as the acme of human infliction ;
but in our actual condition it appears to be not only barbar-
ous but immoral and irreligious to do so. If we value moral
consistency as of any importance in criminal legislation, we
shall be led to abandon the notion that death is the most aw-
ful of punishments, and regard it simply as an institution of
a great and merciful God, to be encountered with courage and
constancy at the call of duty, to be prepared for by the aid
of religion, and to be submitted to with calmness and resig-
nation when it comes to us in the course of providence.
But what mode of treatment can society advantageously
substitute for the punishment of death % An illustration
again drawn from disease will serve to introduce the conclu-
sion which appears to me to follow from the facts and consi-
derations above mentioned. In the case of consumptive dis-
ease, we most successfully diminish the number of deaths,
1 st, by using means to strengthen the lungs, and thereby
to render them more capable of resisting the rude vicis-
situdes of the climate ; and, ?ldly, by removing as much as
possible all noxious external influences. To accomplish the
former object, we must improve the general health of the pa-
tient, beginning in infancy, and using diet, air, exercise,
cleanliness, order, and temperance, as means of doing so.
To attain the latter, we must drain, cleanse, and widen our
streets, ventilate our houses, and so forth.
Let this illustration be applied to the case of crime. To
remove, as far as possible, the first cause of crime namely,
the excessive tendency to idleness and animal
moral training, combined with religious and intellectual in-
struction, should be supplied, and habits of industry be form-
ed. These are the natural means for strengthening the
higher and mitigating the vigour of the lower tendencies of
the mind. To diminish the second cause of crime namely,
unfavourable external circumstances ?we must improve the
social condition of our people by withdrawing from them the
temptations to crime, presented on the one hand by the abuse
of intoxicating liquors, and, on the other, by the pressure of
actual starvation and physical destitution. While we allow
these two causes to flourish in unabated vigour, we may in-
flict whatever punishments we please, and the sura-total ot
crime will not be lessened. On the other hand, in proportion
as we diminish their influence, crime will decrease. Parlia-
mentary returns shew a diminution of offences as the con-
stant accompaniment of increased physical prosperity among
the people.
The infliction of pain and suffering, therefore, as punish-
ment, with a view to the protection of society, may, in my


opinion, be safely abandoned. But this is quite different from
proclaiming impunity to crime. Society is clearly entitled to
defend itself against the criminal acts of its evil-disposed
members, and also to use the best means of defence. But the
best means of defence are those which go most directly to the
root of the evil. Let us at once deprive the offender of the
power of repeating his criminal acts; let us withdraw him
from all excitements to new trangressions ; and let us train
him to industry, morality, and religion. The application of
these means, in the form of imprisonment, attended with ri-
gid discipline, and protracted for a longer or shorter period
according to the inveteracy of the evil habit which we seek
to subdue, will prove at once the most efficacious punishment for
crime, and the best defence of society, which can be attained,
until society shall amend its orvn institutions.
To this doctrine it is often objected, that by such treat-
ment we shall render criminals more comfortable than the
destitute but virtuous poor, who are left to struggle with the
last degrees of physical destitution and mental depression,
unaided by the hand of beneficence, and uncheered by the voice
of hope. In reply I beg to remark, that the possession of the
dispositions which enable the poor in such circumstances to
abstain from crime, places them far above envying the crimi-
nal, although he were lodged in a palace and fed as a prince.
The deprivation of liberty and the stamp of disgrace which de-
grade the criminal, are felt by well-constituted minds as evils
more poignant than the bitterest pangs of hunger and cold ;
and it is from this cause that the virtuous poor are not seduced
by the apparent comfort of the criminal in prison. He does not
appear to them to be in a happy and enviable condition. It is
an erroneous idea entertained by the rich that the poor view
him in this light. If the mental conformation of any class be
so low that they feel no regard for their own character, and set
no value upon their liberty, they will, by that very moral con-
stitution, be prone to become criminals, irrespective of the
supposed seductive pleasures of a jail. If their minds be well
constituted, they will abhor a prison, because it is a prison; just
as a poor but virtuous woman loathes a brothel, although its in-
mates may appear to her to be wallowing in luxury and wealth.
But there is another answer to the objection. If the rich,
against whom, chiefly, criminal acts are'directed, neglect their
own duty towards the poor, and leave them to grow up in ig-
norance, destitution, and vice, until, by becoming desperate
and reckless, they commit serious crimes?they have no rio-ht,
under the plea of self-defence, to degrade the offenders still
farther by rendering prisons more horrible than the loathsome
homes from which the criminal poor generally emerge. This


would be to add cruelty to injustice ; to perpetrate an unwar-
ranted and useless severity on the poor, under the colour of
protecting themselves from an evil which is the direct conse-
quence of their own misconduct.
Public opinion has now recognised the expediency of abo-
lishing the punishment of death for all offences except mur-
der ; and I proceed to consider if there be really any neces-
sity for retaining it as a means of protecting society against
the perpetration of this crime.
Murder may be resorted to as a means of preventing the
detection of another crime; of accomplishing some other
offence, such as robbing a dwelling-house ; or of gratifying a
bloodthirsty, rancorous disposition.
Experience shews that a large class of offenders systema-
tically prefer cunning and stratagem to violence, as their
means of depredation. They pick pockets by feats of dex-
terity, without the consciousness of the person robbed ; they
enter dwelling-houses under cloud of night, or in the absence
of the inmates, and plunder them in silence and by stealth ;
or they devise and execute plans of fraud and deception for
the purpose of robbing tradesmen of their goods, under the
guise of dealing with them as customers. All such practices
indicate in the perpetrators a mind in which, along with a
certain degree of daring, there is a large share of caution,
consideration, and ingenuity. Their grand defect is a want
of an adequate controlling moral power to give to these qua-
lities a virtuous direction. The organs of Cautiousness, Se-
cretiveness, and knowing Intellect, are fairly developed, those
of the moral sentiments are deficient, while those of the pro-
pensities are large.
Another class are so destitute of ingenuity, cunning, and
self-command, or so much swayed by the coarser and fiercer
passions, that they are incapable of using stratagem, but re-
sort to direct violence as their means of committing crime.
In them Combativeness and Destructiveness are plus , and
Cautiousness, Intellect, and the moral organs minus.
The distinction between these two classes is so well marked,
that no reflecting person can avoid ascribing it to differences
in the natural dispositions and intellectual faculties of the
criminals.
As it is almost exclusively the latter class which commits
murder, whether as a means of perpetrating other of-
fences, of destroying evidence, or of gratifying the passion
of revenge, let us inquire into the effect of the prospect of
death as a punishment, on this section of malefactors. The
very fact of their preferring blood and murder to stratagem


and dexterity as their means of crime, proclaims their de-
ficiency in ingenuity, in self-command, and in all the softer
feelings; while it indicates a predominance of the coarser and
more brutal elements of our nature. Owing to this com-
bination of faculties, the penalty of death, when presented
as a remote contingency, finds no quality in such individuals
on which it can make a deep impression. If they possessed
sufficient power of reflection to realise its high probabi-
lity and its terrors, they would, in order to avoid it, em-
ploy stratagem as their means of crime, in preference to
violence ; if they had an adequate sensibility either to social
opinion or to humane emotions, they would recoil from blood;
if they were timid, they would fear resistance or detection.
In short, in order to be a murderer, a man must, as a gene-
ral rule, possess the minimum of the faculties which confer
foresight, prudence, and a just regard to self-interest, and
the maximum of the brutal propensities which rush headlong
to violence, regardless of results. Phrenology enables us to
prove that this combination actually characterises murderers
as a class. On such minds, then, the prospect of death, as a
contingency, does not, and cannot, operate as a powerful re-
straining motive.
Farther: those propensities from which murder (as an
abuse) springs, are directly stimulated, instead of being re-
strained, by witnessing acts of severity and violence, and
especially acts of killing. The tiger in his cage rages at the
sight of blood ; and the bloodthirsty man becomes excited by
executions. Even the average soldier, who recoils at the first
aspect of carnage, becomes, when familiarised with death, in-
different to its terrors and reckless of his own life. The mur-
ders of the French Revolution produced a striking regard-
lessness of life in the people. One of them, when under trial
for murder, addressed the judge in the following words :
? Certainly, sir, I killed the man : kill me ; but do not fatigue
me with so much talking.? This is not theoretical reason-
ing, but the statement of results resting on facts. Captain
Maconochie, after four years? experience of the effects of the
severest criminal treatment at Norfolk Island, declares that
it fostered ? a tendency to reckless daring a quality which,
? more or less, characterises all prisoners, and without which
they would probably have been scared by the first threaten-
ings of the law, and would have escaped its toils.? His con-
cluding remark goes directly to the point of the present dis-
cussion ; it is in these words :?? As a feature in the criminal
character, this daring is not, I think, sufficiently adverted to
by those who advocate the attempt to deter from crime by


severe punishments. Tempers under its influence feel them-
selves only challenged , both in their own eyes and in those of
their companions , by the recurrence of these .? However strange
it may appear to those unacquainted with the subject, yet
? crime thrives on severe examples and ? most certainly in
direct competition with them.?
If, then, the infliction of death be advocated as the severest ,
and therefore the most efficacious, punishment for murder,
this testimony tends to prove, that, so far from repressing
the inclination to the crime, it only challenges to its com-
mission, or excites the minds of those who are predisposed
to it to greater acts of violence. In short, the whole records
of crime and punishment, if read with a due knowledge of
the peculiar constitution of the criminal mind, indicate that
the direct effect of witnessing acts of killing, as an example,
is to stimulate the desire to kill in those in whom the pro-
pensity is naturally strong; and that hence executions oper-
ate as the natural fuel of murders.
Those who disapprove of death-punishment maintain that
its advocates, to be consistent, should proceed to the use of
torture as an accompaniment of death, to render it more ter-
rible ; and this consequence seems to me inevitably to follow
from their own principles. Their object is to restrain by
the terror of the severest punishment; and as experience
proves that simple death does not restrain, why not render
the punishment more severe, and therefore more terrible,
by adding torture to death 1 According to them it is the se-
verity which gives the punishment its influence; why, then,
not increase the dose in proportion to the malignity of the
disease ? M. answers, that ?if the fear of death will not
deter, it may be doubted whether any pains incidental to
death would operate generally to deter. 5 ? But does not this
doubt imply a suspicion, that the mind disposed to murder
is so constituted as not to be capable of weighing accu-
rately degrees of distant evil 1 Heath by torture is, to a
reflecting mind, a thousand times more terrible than sim-
ple death; and if the offender be insensible to it, on what
ground can we rely on his sensibility to the terrors of simple
death \
But M. assigns another reason for avoiding torture. No
penal law, says he, can operate beneficially, if public senti-
ment revolts against it; and public sentiment does revolt
against torturing criminals. The premises and conclusion
here are both admitted to be sound ; but public sentiment is
bound to be consistent with itself. The same process of rea-
soning which has led it to abolish torture will, if legitimately


pursued, lead it to abandon death also as a punishment. The
real cause why society revolts at torture is, that extreme
suffering, when intentionally inflicted, lacerates and pains all
the higher feelings of good men, and, by exciting their sym-
pathy for the tortured wretch, blinds them to the malignity
of his crime. There is, however, a counterpart to this result,
which is too little known and considered; viz., that the sight
of torture interests, gratifies, and excites cruel and ferocious
minds, and supplies them with a decided impulse to deeds
of cruelty and blood. I object to torture, therefore, on the
ground that, so far from restraining, it stimulates destruc-
tive men to murder; and as an ignominious death is only a
minor degree of the same species of infliction, it stands con-
demned by its tendency to produce the same effect.
If there be truth in the principles now stated, it follows
that we shall most effectually temper and assuage the vio-
lent and bloodthirsty elements in the minds of the evil-dis-
posed members of society, by cultivating the greatest tender-
ness for life as a general public sentiment. By this means,
when any individual should feel a propensity to injure or to
kill rising in his mind, he would find in all around him a
calm abhorrence of the act, instead of that wild wonder and
excitement which now accompany the announcement of such
deeds, and which operate as a direct stimulant to his desires.
The prospect of secluded confinement for life would certainly
not excite his destructive propensity, but would tend, in some
degree, to mitigate it. By such means would society be best
protected.*
The last remark which I offer is, that the destructive pro-
pensity is liable to become morbid, and to induce acts of killing
as pure symptoms of insanity?which, nevertheless, are often
mistaken by society for crime, and punished by the penalty of
death. Not only the poor and the profligate, but likewise
educated, prosperous, and virtuous individuals, in the full en-
joyment of the external goods of life, are occasionally tor-
mented by unaccountable desires to commit suicide. When
the mind is under this diseased excitement, a straw may turn
the balance whether the sufferer shall kill another or himself.
The following case, reported.by Dr Samuel B. Woodward,
lately superintendent of the State Lunatic Hospital at Wor-
cester, Massachusetts, in the American Journal of Insanity ,
No. IV,, is highly instructive on this subject:?
* Those who desire to see evidence of the tendency of executions to excite
the destructive propensity, may consult Mr Sampson?s work on ? Criminal
Jurisprudence considered in relation to Mental Organization.?


On the Bth January 1845, I was consulted by G. E., twenty-five years of age,
in apparent good health, of good personal appearance, good habits, manners,
and character.
Before he called on me himself, his father stated to me, that he had for a few
days been unhappy, from an apprehension that he should injure some of the
family; that this impression preyed upon his mind, depressed his spirits, and
rendered him unfit for labour. I did not learn from the father that he was
apprehensive of any danger from this condition of the son, or that he was in-
formed of the extent of the evil that preyed upon his mind; he only requested
my advice for him as a physician.
The young man soon called, and in a private interview gave me the follow-
ing history of his own case.
He was quite well and cheerful till September 1843, when he lost a brother
to whom he was attached, which made him sober and pensive, but this was not
followed immediately by any peculiar feelings.
In the course of the winter he became affected with an extraordinary desire
to kill. Frequently in the course of the day, this feeling was excited by the
presence of his own family friends, to such a degree as to make him shudder at
their danger, and his own strange and unnatural propensity. He had no an-
tipathy toward any of them; on the contrary, he had all the affection of a son
and a brother. Although this desire to kill haunted him perpetually for some
weeks, he cautiously concealed it from his friends, and that so successfully, that
they had no mistrust of his feelings, or apprehension of danger.
As the warm weather approached, and he began to labour out of doors, the
propensity gradually subsided, and left him entirely before summer.
Early in the winter of 1844-5, the young man formed a partnership with a
brother-in-law, to carry on the shoe-business in a neighbouring town, and they
commenced operations about two weeks before he consulted me on the Bth of
January.
Almost immediately after commencing this labour in the shop, with his
brother, this impulse was re-excited, and he felt an irresistible desire to KILL
him. So strongly was this feeling excited many times a-day, that he felt com-
pelled to leave his work, and quit the room frequently, believing, as he now
does, that he should have killed him, if he had not thus abruptly torn himself
away.
After struggling many days with this dreadful propensity, he left his work
without giving notice to his brother, and returned to his father?s house, where
he now remains the victim of the same wretched feelings, and he insists that
he shall kill somebody, if not speedily cured. I prescribed some remedies, and
a course of diet and regimen for him, and recommended him to call on me
ao-ain, if he did not soon get better. Not having heard from him since, I hope
that the dreadful impulse has again passed from his mind.
Had this individual (remarks Dr Woodward) committed homicide in the
winter of 1843-4, there would have been no evidence whatever that he was not
of sound mind ; both rational and responsible. He was indeed slightly de-
pressed, but he had recently lost a dear and affectionate brother, who had been
his companion and playfellow from infancy upwards. No one suspected that a
dreadful impulse was at that time urging him to destroy his best friends, and
that, with all his might, he was struggling to overcome it. Even the more
recent escape from still greater danger-danger which it is fearful to contem-
plate ?seems almost miraculous; as no evidence had yet been afforded of the
influences which were urging him to take the life of one of his best friends, his
own relative, and daily associate, till he disclosed the fact to me, so fully and
unreservedly.

ANSWER, &o.
In 1845 an association was formed in Edinburgh by ? a
number of friends of evangelical truth,? for ? opposing pre-
valent errors.?. James Douglas, Esq. of Cavers, is, or was,
the chairman, and the Rev. William Thomson, the Secession
minister of Slateford, a small village near Edinburgh, is the
secretary. The ? prevalent errors? which the Society con-
siders itself called upon to oppose, are, ? Popery,? ? Pusey-
ism,? ? Pantheism,? ? Anti-Supernaturalism,? �� Socialism,?
? Combe?s Constitution of Man ,? and the ? Vestiges of the Na-
tural History of Creation .? Mr Kennedy?s work, mentioned
in the title page, has been published under its sanction, and
is the best of the books that have been written against ? The
Constitution of Man.?
The secretary of the Association, in his official circular,
acknowledges, that ? there is little in the piety or principle
of the mass of the population to which we can confidently look
as a barrier to this tide of superstition.? This is an ominous
avowal, and one which?taken in connection with Dr Chal-
mers?s declaration in the North British Review for February
1847, that, ?as things stand at present, our creeds and con-
fessions have become effete??looks uncommonly like an
avowal of failure by men who have been engaged in a vain
attempt to maintain ? prevalent errors.? It forms a strange
prelude to the announcement, that, notwithstanding this
failure, they consider themselves qualified to undertake the
gigantic task here presented in outline.
Since the Revolution in 1688, the clergy of Scotland have
enjoyed the privilege of governing parish schools, and in-
structing the people in religion ; and if, in the year 1847, they
are constrained to acknowledge that their �< creeds and cate-
chisms have become effete,?? and that they have been able to
infuse so �� little piety or principle into the mass of the popu-
lation,?? that they cannot resist Popery and Puseyism, and the
various other �� isms?? before enumerated, they should really
look into their own standards and tenets, and see if there be
not in them some �� vestiges? of error which have been the
causes of so great a failure. Strength, solidity, and endur-
ance, are the characteristics of truth ; instability, feeble-
ness, and decay, those of error. When, therefore, they ac-
knowledge, that, after so long period of teaching, the latter


characteristics attach to their own tenets, they should be
modest in their condemnation of those of other men. It is,
perhaps, a consciousness of this fact that has led them to add
that they ? feel the need of prudence and caution.? These,
certainly, are becoming principles of action in men who are
meditating assaults upon the opinions of their neighbours,
while their own positions are exposed to danger. We shall,
however, endeavour to shew that they stand in need of even
more of these virtues than they have exhibited in the present
publication.
At the same time, we have great pleasure in making one
acknowledgment in favour of Mr Kennedy?s work. It is free
from vulgar vituperation and denunciation. It is, moreover,
well written, and, in some instances, ingeniously argued ; and
it is altogether superior to any thing we have seen produced
on that side of the question. Unfortunately, we cannot carry
our commendations farther. It assumes throughout that the
Scotch Calvinistic interpretations of the Bible are the Scrip-
tures, and that no different interpretations have ever been
heard of; or at least none that are deserving even of men-
tion. In The Constitution of Man, Mr Combe has quoted the
following words of Dr Whately. ?If we really are con-
vinced of the truth of Scripture, and consequently of the fal-
sity of any theory (of the earth for instance) which is really
at variance with it, we must needs believe that that theory is
also at variance with observable phenomena ; and we ought
not, therefore, to shrink from trying the question by an ap-
peal to these.? Mr Kennedy answers ?
? With all due deference to this high authority, we maintain that, if Mr
Combe?s doctrines are really at variance with Scripture, and if we are
really convinced of the truth of Scripture, we must conclude that Mr
Combe?s doctrines are false. The reasoning is so obviously fair, that we
have no fear to exhibit it, either to Mr Combe or to the great logician whom
he quotes. It stands thus :
What is really at variance with Scripture cannot be true ;
Mr Combe?s theory of the world is really at variance with Scripture ;
Therefore, Mr Combe?s theory of the world cannot be true.?
With all deference to Mr Kennedy, the Archbishop of Dub-
lin is in the right. The record of nature is beyond all ques-
tion Divine ; and whatever we read correctly in it is Divine
revelation. Hence itfollow'S, to use the Archbishop?s words,
that ? a pretended revelation would be proved not to be a true
one, if it w r ere at variance with the laws by which the Maker of
the universe governs it.? ( Essay on Christian Self- denial.) Mr
Kennedy, therefore, and his Society, and all other persons
who assail expositions of scientific truths, by arguing that


they are at variance with the doctrines of Scripture, mistake
the way to accomplish their own ends. Their true duty is to
expound the laws of nature themselves, directly from the re-
cords of creation, and then to shew that their own interpre-
tations of Scripture are in harmony with them. The title of
Mr Kennedy?s work would lead us to expect that he had done
this; but his leading object has been only to attack Mr
Combe?s doctrines.
Dr Chalmers was called upon, in the Bridgewater Treatise
assigned to him, to present a view of the moral government
of the world by natural laws, if such exists ; and had he given
a sounder and more practically useful exposition of them than
that contained in ? The Constitution of Man,? and afterwards
reconciled Calvinism with it, he would not subsequently have
been under the necessity of acknowledging that men ? can
speak, and with a truth the most humiliating, of our inert and
unproductive orthodoxy.? Calvinism, proved by an appeal to
scientific facts to be a correct interpretation of nature, so far
as its doctrines touch the beings and interests of this world,
would exhibit none of the symptoms of weakness and decay
before referred to ; and a people instructed in the firm alliance
between it and nature, would possess not a ? little ,? but much
? of the piety or principle to which we can confidently look
as a barrier to the tide of superstition.?
The Society of which we speak will do well to take this hint
into consideration. ? The Constitution of Man? is a body of
alleged facts, and deductions from them. Mr Kennedy?s work
cannot take its place, because it contains no systematic ex-
position of the scheme of God?s works and natural providence,
which it is the aim of Mr Combe?s treatise to exhibit. The
human mind will not relinquish a positive for a negative,
when that positive is acknowledged by Mr Kennedy himself
to be ? characterized by great ability,?? ? its deleterious prin-
ciples? being ? mixed up with a large body of sound, and
valuable, and interesting instruction.? In the ? Remarks on
National Education,? and in the essay on ? The Relation be-
tween Religion and Science,? Mr Combe lias presented addi-
tional materials for the Society?s operations. If they really
design to make an impression on the public mind, let them
grapple with the questions there proposed. For example,
let them answer the following questions in substantive pro-
positions, and prove the answers, viz.:?lsthe world governed
by natural laws, or is it not \ If it is not, are physical and
moral events still caused by special supernatural exertions
of Divine power 1 If these have ceased, and no natural laws
exist, is not this world necessarily a theatre of anarchy, and,


consequently, of atheism ! If, on the other hand, natural
laws do exist, are they not of Divine institution and authority ?
And if they possess this character, where is any intelligible
and practical exposition of them, as guides to human con-
duct, challenging our reverence and obedience, to be found,
emanating from ? ministers and laymen connected with va-
rious denominations holding evangelical opinions If no
such expositions of them by these persons are published, is
not the neglect of teaching them, true and practical infi-
delity to God?s law written in the book of creation, on the
part of these ? ministers and laymen V ?
Farther : Are the practical precepts of Christianity regard-
ing human conduct in this life in harmony with and sup-
ported by the order of God?s providence in the natural world,
or are they not ! If they are not, how can man conform his
conduct to the order of nature and to these precepts 1 If the
precepts and God?s order of providence in the natural world
are in harmony, ?as science proclaims, ?why have these
? ministers and laymen? failed to discover this fact 1 and, if
they have discovered it, why have they omitted to teach it 1
These are the questions which the ? ministers and laymen?
must fairly encounter and satisfactorily answer, before their
lost strength will return to them; and in giving them this
advice, we are acting, we hope, as their sincere friends, and
certainly as their wellwishers. If they had practised the
? prudence and caution?? of which they feel the need, they
would have considered these questions maturely, before com-
mencing their present crusade ; and perhaps saved them-
selves from the risk of a public exhibition of their own weak-
ness, errors, and inconsistencies, while they are endeavour-
ing to demonstrate those of their neighbours.
Chapter I. is entitled, ? Mr Combe?s hypothesis concern-
ing the progressive development of elements of improvement
in the physical and organic departments of the world con-
sidered and the same subject is continued through the two
subsequent chapters. The point at issue is, whether ? the
world contains within itself the elements of improvement!?
In the edition of 1835, Mr Combe had added to this sentence
these words, ?? which time will evolve and bring to maturity.?
Some persons had supposed these last expressions (unwarrant-
ably, we think, when the context was taken into account) to
imply a denial of the government of the world by Divine
wisdom and power. In consequence of this misunderstand-
ing, the expressions were altered in the next edition, that of
1811, and the words used were, ? The world, including both
the physical and moral departments, is, in itself, well and


wisely constructed on the principle of a progressive system,
and, therefore, capable of improvement.? Mr Kennedy founds
his arguments exclusively on the edition of 1835, and never
mentions the existence of any alterations in that of 1841. We
have no doubt that this was unintentional on his part; but as
the rule among honourable controversialists is to cite the
latest, as the most carefully considered edition of a work as-
sailed, we, while acquitting him of intentional injustice, regret
the oversight, for his own sake.
Chapter IV. is on the ? Harmony between Geology and
Scripture which we leave in Mr Kennedy?s hands, having
neither interest nor space to enter into any controversy with
him on the subject.
Chapter V. treats of the question, ? Does the history of
mankind establish Mr Combe?s theory regarding progressive
development ?? Mr Kennedy?s opening sentence admits that
? mankind are, on the whole, making advancement in know-
ledge and civilization.? ? This advancement, however,?? he
adds, ?is not owing to the mere development of inherent
elements of improvement in human nature. For this ad-
vancement of mankind, we must assign a very different cause.
That cause is Divine mercy. Our world, though fallen, is not
forsaken. It is marred ; but there are agencies working to
effect its restoration to order, beauty, and blessedness. Apos-
tate man is the object of redeeming love, and the subject of re-
newing grace.? This is fighting with a shadow. The real
question, is, Whether the world be now governed through
special supernatural interferences of God?s power, or accord-
ing to natural laws \ Mr Kennedy has not shewn the former
to be the case, and until he do so, we are entitled to hold by
the latter, as the hypothesis which is supported by science
and daily experience. But if the order of God?s providence
be now characterized by the regularity of natural laws, ? re-
deeming love? and ? renewing grace? cannot be antagonistic
influences to these laws. Mr Kennedy would have better
served his cause if he had fairly grappled with the merits of
the question, and developed a view of the natural laws
adapted to these influences, instead of harping on the words
which Mr Combe had altered six years before the ? Defence?
was published, and which are no longer to be found in the
? prevalent? editions of his work.
ChapterVl. is entitled, ?Was Man originally mortal? ?Mr
Kennedy concedes that ? there may have been death among
the lower animals prior to the time when man sinned.? Mr
Combe added, that if man is now the same being that he was
when created, he must then, as now, have possessed organs
of Araativeness, Philoprogenitiveness, Combativeness, De-


structiveness, Secretiveness, and Cautiousness, and that these
seemed to him to indicate the adaptation of man to a world
in which the old were to be removed by death, to make room
for the young, and in which there was to be danger and dif-
ficulty, rendering the faculties before named useful and
necessary. Mr Kennedy maintains that, notwithstanding
these faculties, man may have been created sinless and im-
mortal. The arguments by means of which he supports these
propositions are, ?first, that the old, like Enoch and Elijah,
might have been ? removed? to another sphere without dy-
ing ; and, secondly, that Mr Combe has himself shewn that
all the faculties have a legitimate sphere of action, and may,
therefore, have been adapted to a world without death, dan-
ger, and sin. The question?Whether man was originally
mortal ?lies beyond the limits of science, and Mr Combe has
not discussed it in ? The Constitution of Man.?? He has only
asserted that the human mind and body, as now constituted,
are de facto adapted to the world in which we find them;
that, apparently, the world was not changed in its constitu-
tion and arrangements at the time of man?s appearance ; and
that it has not been substantially altered since. Our readers,
therefore, will judge for themselves concerning man?s condi-
tion prior to his entering upon his present state of exist-
ence.
Chapter YII. is on ? Man?s Fallen Condition.? We leave
this also to Mr Kennedy, as one belonging to theology.
Chapter VIII. considers ? Mr Combe?s Exposition and
Application of the Natural Laws.?? In this chapter Mr Ken-
nedy invents difficulties in order to combat them. By way
of correcting Mr Combe, he says?
? But it is not true; Ist, That any mode of action of a
physical object is otherwise inherent in it, than as it is
the will of God that that object should now present that
mode of action. Nor is it true; 2d, That it is beyond the
power of God to vary when he pleases, either temporarily
or permanently, the constitution of physical objects.? This
is trifling with the subject: Mr Combe has nowhere as-
cribed the inherent modes of action of any object, either
physical or moral, to any cause except the will and power of
God ; and he has never maintained ? that it is beyond the
power of God to vary, when he pleases, either temporarily
or permanently, the constitution? of these objects. The real
practical question is, Does it de facto appear, from what we
see passing around us, that it does please God , now to vary ,
either temporarily or permanently, the constitution and modes
of action of physical or moral objects \ Mr Combe affirms


that according to his observation of the present order of nature,
it does not please God. to vary these constitutions and modes
of action ; and Mr Kennedy, instead of shewing by clear and
unequivocal facts, now observable , that God does in our own
day please to vary these, enters into a general disquisition
to prove that God can vary them, if he pleases, and that un-
der the miraculous dispensations of the Old and New Testa-
ments, he did vary them. But not one word of this argu-
ment applies to the case in hand. We ask Mr Kennedy,
Were not the miraculous dispensations confined to the Jews
and the Scripture times ? Is the world now under the same
special supernatural administration which is recorded to have
characterized it then ? Does not Mr Kennedy know that
during the long reign of ignorance in the dark ages, the
Roman Catholic priesthood pretended that a miraculous
dispensation still continued, and that they were the appoint-
ed instruments for evoking special supernatural acts of Di-
vine administration; and that one of the boasts of Protest-
antism has been the demonstration that these pretensions
were presumptuous and fraudulent?. With strange incon-
sistency, however, some Protestants have retained a portion
of that superstition, and have not only taught it, but acted
under its influence themselves. (See ? Relation between Reli-
gion and Science pages 2, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
Chapter IX. is on ? The Efficacy of Prayer.? The ques-
tion here again at issue is, Whether we have evidence from
observation and experience, that in our day God pleases to
vary the constitution and modes of action which he has be-
stowed on physical and moral objects, in consequence of being
requested to do so by men in prayer. Mr Kennedy quotes
numerous instances from the Old Testament where this is
recorded to have been done. ? Take, for example,? says he,
? Elijah?s prayer for rain. That prayer, in itself, could have
no effect whatever on the atmosphere.? On this point we
beg to refer to the passage quoted from Archbishop Whately?s
address on the famine in Ireland, on pages 9 and 10 of ? Re-
ligion and Science,? which is strictly applicable to the pre-
sent question ; and to assure Mr Kennedy that if he will ad-
duce a sufficient number of well authenticated instances of
men in our day bringing rain or sunshine, or removing the
potato blight, or staying fever, or accomplishing any similar
physical result, by means of prayer, without bringing into
operation, by natural means, the natural causes of these re-
sults, we shall abandon all belief in the natural laws, and
renounce at once all the ? prevalent errors ? of Mr Combe?s
Constitution of Man.? But it is in vain to adduce examples


of supernatural power wielded or evoked by the personages
of the Old and New Testaments, as evidence that the same
gifts have descended to the men of our generation. If they
have so descended, why do we accuse the Roman Catholic
priesthood of fraud and hypocrisy in having pretended to
enjoy them \ The man who, by prayer, could, in our day, in-
duce God to send rain, or stay a pestilence, by special acts of
Divine administration, would really be able to work miracles;
and if we do not seriously believe that this can be done, why
should we mock God and deceive ourselves by pretending to
believe that it can be accomplished \
Chapter X. is on ? Changes in Moral and Religious Cha-
racter.? It is not necessary to discuss the topics involved in
this chapter, because the question constantly occurs?Are
the changes referred to effected through the instrumentality
of God?s providence operating by means of the natural con-
stitution conferred by Him on moral beings 1 or are they
effected by influences lying beyond these, and not acknow-
ledging alliance with them \ If such influences exist and con-
tradict the natural order of God?s providence, Mr Kennedy is
called on to prove this : If he admits that they act in con-
formity with it, and supplement it, he allows all*that Mr
Combe has contended for, which is simply this?that until the
natural conditions on which an event or result depends are
brought into existence, we have no warrant from our own
experience (whatever may have been the experience of the
Jews in scripture times), to expect that that result will be
accomplished.
Chapters XI. and XII. are ? On Affliction as a means of
Moral Discipline,? and contain a strange mixture of truth
and error. Mr Kennedy here arrives at the discovery that
the natural laws are inconsistent. ? The very same act,?
says he, ? is required by one law, and forbidden by another
law??both laws being Divine. ?We sometimes cannot obey
both the organic and the moral laws.? He adds, very truly,
? Now this view of matters involves gross absurdity.? It
really does so ; but on whose side does the absurdity lie ? By
the natural laws, of course, he means God?s natural laws;
and his proposition amounts to this?that God?s creation
is not systematic and self-consistent; that the natural con-
quences which God has attached to the actions of moral beings
are not always adapted to serve as guides to their conduct;
but that man may, in certain cases, shew forth a wisdom
superior to that of God, and legitimately disregard them.
Mr Kennedy teaches us, that man by following the dictates of
his own wisdom, in opposition to that of God, may reach
more excellent and beneficial ends than by following submis-


sively in the track of God?s providence ! This doctrine, be
it observed, proceeds from an evangelical Society associated
to oppose ? prevalent errors.?? This, although a strong state-
ment of Mr Kennedy?s doctrine, is no misrepresentation or
perversion of it: for he assumes that the law which he says
may be legitimately and beneficially transgressed or disre-
garded is God's law ; and the proposition which he is combat-
ing is Mr Combe?s doctrine that the Divine laws, in all cases,
and without any exception , are entitled to command the re-
spect and obedience of God?s rational creatures. But let him
speak for himself.
After citing, and partially approving of Mr Combe?s repre-
sentation of the advantages of obeying the natural laws, he
proceeds thus : ? Now, it is only the moral laws that impe-
ratively regulate our conduct. Obedience to the first two
classes (the physical and organic laws), is only prudential,
and often has nothing moral in it. Moral laws should be
obeyed at all times, and in all circumstances. Physical laws
we may evade or disobey in multiplied instances, quite unblame-
ably. That we may fully obey the moral laws , we frequently
must, to some extent, disregard the physical lawsf ? Physi-
cal laws ought not to be confounded with laws of human con-
duct. These we always must obey ; those we may often, with-
out deserving blame, boldly disregard .? ? The same remarks,
to some extent, apply also to the organic laws. These we
may often, to a large extent, properly disregard .? p. 132. Does
not this plainly teach that creation is not systematic and
self-consistent; that God has so framed the physical and or-
ganic worlds and the moral law, that there is often open
contradiction between them ; that the natural consequences
which He has attached to infringements of the physical and
organic laws are not intended, or at least, not calculated, in
all cases, to instruct us and to serve as guides to our con-
duct ? All this seems to be implied in the doctrine, that we
may ? often,? ? properly,? ? unblameably,? and ? boldly,?
? disregard? those laws.
The view insisted on by Mr Kennedy, that ? it is only the
moral laws that imperatively regulate our conduct;? and that
? obedience to the physical and organic laws is only pruden-
tial, and often has nothing moral in it,? is unsound in prin-
ciple and highly injurious to human welfare. That it should
be boldly proclaimed by an ? association ? ? holding evange-
lical sentiments,? appears to us to be explicable only by the
suppositions that they do not comprehend what is implied in
a law of nature ; or that their own moral and religious senti-
ments have been so misdirected by education, that they recog-


nize no sacredness in the order of God?s Providence embodied
in, and manifested through, the instrumentality of these laws.
In Mr Kennedy?s case, ignorance cannot be imputed; for he
appreciates, to a considerable extent, the Divine origin and
practical importance of the laws; but at the same time, and
apparently from his Veneration and Conscientiousness never
having been trained to reverence them, and to feel a moral and
religious duty in obeying them, he openly proclaims that there
is often ? nothing moral? in that obedience. If the intellect
were correctly instructed in the order of God?s Providence, as
embodied in the physical and organic systems of the world,
and if the moral and religious sentiments were trained from
infancy to reverence that order and the lessons which it is
ever addressing to man for the regulation of his conduct,
these lessons would be felt to imply a moral and religious
obligation. Many persons, for example, consider it a sin to
enter into a matrimonial compact for life without the bene-
diction of a clergyman, but consider it no sin, and only an
imprudence, to form, under the sanction of that benediction,
an alliance which, according to the organic laws, will entail
misery on their offspring. Such conduct appears to us to be
explicable only by supposing either that they ignorantly dis-
believe in the consequences of their own act, or that they
entertain a most irreverent contempt for God?s authority as
manifested in the organic laws. Let us see, however, by
what evidence Mr Kennedy supports his extraordinary pro-
position.
He appeals to the case of Grace Darling, ? who,?? says he,
? was rendered illustrious by nobly braving the surges of the
tempestuous ocean, endangering her own life to rescue others
from a watery grave. She scorned to be withheld from her ge-
nerous exertions by the regard due to the w r ell-known or-
ganic law, that a human body submerged beneath the
waves, must soon be bereft of life.? (P. 127.) This is a mis-
take. Grace Darling, by using a boat, which, by the phy-
sical law, floats on the surface of the water, preserved her
own body out of the water ; by obeying the physical law, she
obeyed also the organic law, and thus saved herself and her
fellow-creatures from drowning. Surely the Society?s ? pru-
dence and caution,? as well as their common sense, were asleep
when they allowed Mr Kennedy to publish such an example
as evidence of the advantages of disobeying a natural law.
He adds another instance in which Mr Holgrove rushed on
a?railway and rescued two poor women from destruction by
an advancing train, but was himself struck down by the
engine.


Kennedy's ? Nature and Revelation Harmonious l3
The argument founded on this ease, has been already an-
swered in Mr Combe?s Pamphlet on ? Religion and Science,?
pages 17 and 18. The argument itself affords an additional
evidence of the thorough confusion which reigns in the minds
of evangelical men on the subject of the natural laws, and
the low estimate which they form of Divine wisdom mani-
fested in the order of nature. It does not admit of doubt
that Mr Holgrove suffered from an error in calculating the
position in which his own body and the train would stand
relatively to each other at the time when he made the effort.
He reckoned on accomplishing his object, and on moving off
the rail, before the train should come up ; in other words, he
intended to obey the natural law, and not to set it at de-
fiance. It is because we give him credit for this intention,
and sympathize with his miscalculation (which in his place
we likewise might have made), that we yield to him the tri-
bute of our admiration. If we believed that he meant to sur-
render his own life to save the lives of the old women (which
he must have done, if he intended to disobey the physical law
under which the advancing train was moving), we could not
approve of his conduct. He was not the proper judge of the
relative values of the lives. If he had left a bereaved widow
and destitute children, they would have viewed the deliberate
sacrifice of his own life for those of the old women as un-
called for by the claims of duty. Again, if he had intended
to throw away his own life, and merely availed himself of the
opportunity of the old women being on the rail, to kill himself
with ecldt, our judgment of his act would be one of unequi-
vocal condemnation.
Mr Kennedy speaks of ? evading?? the natural laws. The
thing is impossible. God has connected the consequences with
the antecedents; and man cannot separate or evade them. If
Mr Kennedy had said, that by obeying one law we may
shelter ourselves from the injurious effects of another, we
could have understood what he meant; although, even in
this case, there would have been an error in the form of ex-
pressing the fact. For example, when a man rises in a bal-
loon, he does not triumph over the law of gravitation by set-
ting it at defiance, but by acting in accordance with it. That
law causes the heavier gases of the atmosphere to gravitate
more forcibly than the light hydrogen gas in the balloon;
and the former, gravitating downwards, lift the balloon up.
A physician who, before visiting a case of malignant and in-
fectious fever, takes a good breakfast, whereby he produces
in his own organism an internal resisting power calculated to
ward off external influences, and who orders the door and


windows of the patient?s chamber to be opened, and the room
to be ventilated, before he enters it, and by these means
escapes infection, does not triumph over the organic law by
defying it at the call of duty, but finds his safety in obeying
it. If he enters that same apartment feeble, fasting, and
exhausted, and encounters its concentrated contaminated at-
mosphere, unmodified by ventilation, the supposed calls of
moral duty will not protect him from the consequences. Ac-
cording to the ordinary course of God?s providence, he will
be infected himself, and he may die. We should be glad to
know whether the clergymen and lay inspectors of the poor
who have recently fallen victims to their duty in fever hospi-
tals, have acted on Mr Kennedy?s view of the order of God?s
providence, or on ours. We have a suspicion that they have
gone into the fever wards in a state of mental and physical
exhaustion, and neglected the means of diminishing by ven-
tilation the noxious influence of the effluvia from the bodies
of the patients. Be this as it may, the natural tendency of
Mr Kennedy?s doctrine, backed by all the influence of the
evangelical Society, is to encourage men, at the supposed
call of moral or religious duty, to set the organic laws at de-
fiance ; whereas our earnest exhortation to them is to obey
them in all cases to the very utmost of their ability. We leave
it to the reader to judge which party is here propounding
? dangerous error and gross absurdity and whether a So-
ciety which forms such an humble estimate of the self-con-
sistency and instructive character of God?s natural provi-
dence, and such an exalted view of its own discrimination, is
more likely to ?oppose? or to propagate ?prevalent errors.??
Chapter XIV. is ? On the Alleged Possibility of Deducing
a System of Morality merely from the Natural Laws.?? We
at once concede to Mr Kennedy, that if God?s natural laws
be, as he argues, so worthless that ?we may often, to a large
extent , properly disregard them,? and ? evade or disobey them
in multiplied instances, quite unblame ably ,?? they cannot be
the fountain of a ? system of morality.? If he should ever
have his eyes opened to higher views of the Divine Wisdom
embodied in the order of nature, perhaps he may differ less
from Mr Combe on this subject than he does at present.
Chapter XV. is ?On the use of Science as a guide to the
Interpretation of Scripture.? True science is merely a cor-
rect record of the order of God?s providence revealed to the
human mind in the constitution and modes of action of physical
and moral beings ; and while Mr Kennedy forms his present
humble estimate of its character, he is not in a condition to
judge of its use and importance as a guide to the interpreta-
tion of Scripture.


To conclude : we are not sorry that this Society has been
formed. When Mr Kennedy, as its organ, acknowledges
that the natural laws are God?s laws, and yet proclaims,
with its sanction, that we may often ? unblameably? and
? boldly? disregard them, it exposes itself to the imputation
of proclaiming war against the sacred and inviolable charac-
ter of God?s providence embodied in the order of nature.
While, however, we acquit its members of this intention, w r e
cannot help repeating that such works as Mr Kennedy?s be-
tray an extraordinary confusion reigning in the minds of
some religious men on the connection between religion and
the order of God?s secular providence, as disclosed by science.
This confusion appears to be general among the Calvinistic
sects; for ? The Free Church Magazine? has not hesitated
to adopt Mr Kennedy?s views, to recommend his work, and,
in American phraseology, to endorse all his doctrines. The
education of the people, and social progress generally, are
seriously retarded by such errors prevailing in such influen-
tial quarters.
