All of these things in my bath tub with me
Are really big ships sailing out on the sea.
I'm the big rock that is blocking the way
They must go around me to get to the boy

I'm off to the shop with a note and some money.
To buy Mum some eggs and some soap and some honey.
I can tun going up but must walk coming back.
Because if I run all the googies will crack.

This is our baby. My, isn't he sweet
The way that he plays with his hands and his feet
The name that we've called him is Timothy Peter,
We just call him Tim 'cause it sort of sounds sweeter.

To-day I'm very busy. I've lots of things to iron.
I've finished all my washing, it's hanging on the line.
My dolly's very dirty, her face looks awfully red.
I think I'll go and bath her, then pop her into bed.

To roll in the grass and the clover.
Is the game that most I adore.
Tumbling over and over and over,
I get up then do it some more.

It's easy to ride on a slippery dip.
Just slide off the top and go down with a zip.
At first I felt timid and did Tommy tease?
But now I'm an expert and go down with ease.

This is a jolly tea party.
The guests add up to three.
There's teddy-bear and dolly dear.
And hostess, little me.

At last I have decided, a nurse I'm going to be.
Here is my doggie Tony, who is a casualty.
At first he seemed to like it but now he won't stay put
I'm finding it a bother to bind his little foot

I # ve dressed myself up with such very great care#
I've powdered my nose and I've pinned up my hair.
When I put this hat on I'll go out and see
lust how many people will recognise me.

Two purl and two plain socks for Daddy I'm knitting.
I hope when they're finished they'll be a good fitting.
The color is blue striped with red. green and yellow.
They're bound to suit Dad who's a very smart fellow.


To-day I feel marvellous. I'm well as can be
You've only to look and you'll very soon see.
I'm taking precautions against winter's chill.
If I keep myself wrapped up I'll never get iIL


There's lots of things that I don't like# For each night after dinner
Being scolded is the worst#
But how I love the night time#
Cause that's when I get nursed#
Dad takes me on his knee#
And you should hear the stories#
That my Daddy tells to me.

A very sick dolly is Dorothy Jane.
It makes me feel anxious to see her in pain.
It's not as though she is a strong little mite.
She's bound to disturb my rest during the night
