PREFACE.
Taking into consideration the proportions that the
Science of Political Economy has assumed, and the fact
that its study has now become so general that it is repre-
sented by a Professor’s chair in every University in Europe,
it has long struck me that a Catechism similar to the
present was needed among the text books of the nine-
teenth century : and although fully aware of my own
inability to fill up the void, I have endeavoured in these
few pages to contribute my mite to the store of Education,
trusting that abler hands will continue the good work.
It will be seen that this Catechism is purely Elemen-
tary. I have carefully avoided all abstruse questions
which might serve to perplex the mind of the tyro, limiting
myself to the barest possible outline, an outline which the
preceptor himself will find it easy to fill up to any extent
he may desire.

A CATECHETICAL MANUAL
OF THE
SIMPLEST RUDIMENTS
POLITICAL ECONOMY.
Chapter I.
POLITICAL ECONOMY.
Q. What is Political Economy ?
A. The science that explains the causes and effects of
the various laws that govern our social relations.
Q. Are these laws definite and incontrovertible ?
A. Yes; for, although many philosophers differ in the
language to be employed in the explanation of these laws,
their principles are nevertheless axiomatic.
Q. Do these laws affect man as an individual ?
A. In no way, except as they influence his social re-
lations.
Q. Whence arises the title of Political Economy ?
A. The designation was originally employed by the
Italian writers of the seventeenth century, and to avoid
the confusion of authors has since been maintained; al-
though the more proper title would have been Social
Philosophy.


Q. Do I then understand that these laws are of modern
invention ?
A. By no means; but, although they have existed
since the first moment that the family of the human race
divided itself into communities, yet their phenomena were
never understood nor reduced to order till within the last
century.
Q. Whence do you infer that these laws have always
existed ?
A. Because the facts on which they are based are
coseval with the existence of society.
Q. Is, then, the science of Political Economy based
upon facts alone ?
A. Yes.
Q. Then, how do you explain that the science dates
from so recent an epoch ?
A. Because the facts were not understood as necessary
consequences of a certain order of events; thus, the world
has always revolved round the sun, yet it needed a Galileo
to prove it.
Q. Are they now understood ?
A. Yes.
Q. What is the object of the study of Political Economy ?
A. To increase the well-being of man.
Q. But you have before stated that the laws of the
science did not affect man as an individual, how do you
explain this anomaly ?
A. Because an acquaintance with those laws teaches
man that he must work, and why; explains the necessity
of moral training, and its bearing on his social ties; gives
him reasons for acquiring knowledge, for the importance
of order and obedience, for his duties as a citizen and a
relative.


Q. In what way does it do this ?
A. By showing how a disregard of the laws of Political
Economy leads to his own unhappiness, to the poverty of
the society to which he belongs, to the decadence of the
nation of which he forms a component item.
Q. But have not individuals and nations flourished, not
only in spite of, but even when acting in direct hostility to
those laws ?
A. Yes! but when individuals have so prospered, it
has been at the expense of others of the same community ;
and if ruin have not overtaken a nation, it is not because
the laws are faulty, but the immediate and ultimate effect
of their action has not been understood, and some secondary
cause, hidden from the eye of the public, but patent to the
philosopher, has intervened.
Q. Would it then follow that an habitual violation of
the laws of Political Economy could ultimately entail ruin
on a people ?
A. Most certainly; and hence do we see the continual
legislative changes made by those nations whose rulers
have ignored the science.
Q. What is then the relation between Political Economy
and Legislation ?
A. Inasmuch as legislation is but the wise government
of the social body ruled, it must be based upon Political
Economy to ensure vitality.
Q. But, as legislation embraces the regulation not only
of the State itself, but also of its relation with other
States, how can it be influenced by Political Economy ?
A. Because the laws of the science instruct man that
no amount of advantage can be gained by an individual,
without its being shared by the world at large, and thus
enables him to link his own well-being with that of others.
b 2


Q. But you have stated that individuals have prospered
in defiance of the laws of Political Economy; if, then, in-
dividual prosperity, as you state, must be diffused, where
is the advantage of the science ?
A. In this: that the knowledge of its laws would have
led to the more equal diffusion of wealth, and though the
well-being of individuals must lead in a greater or less
degree to the well-being of society, yet that can only be
insured in the highest degree by the contented competence
of all its members.
Q. If Political Economy has an influence on the foreign
relations of a people, do you thence infer that there would
be continual peace in the world, if its laws were universally
obeyed ?
A. No! for man would always be liable to the infir-
mities common to humanity; the weak would still be
oppressed by the strong, and the astute would take advan-
tage of the simple; but a perfect knowledge of the science
of Political Economy would tend to equalize advantages,
and, under a wise government, the causes of disagreement
in the human family would become less frequent.
Q. The arguments you have employed might evidence
the advantages of the study to the higher classes of the
community, but how can the knowledge of these laws be
made serviceable to the working bees of the hive ?
A. In many ways; for the labouring classes have a
greater interest than their employers in studying the laws
that rule the accumulation and distribution of capital—that
govern the rate of wages and the employment of labour —
the sources of national and individual wealth, and the
rights to which, as citizens, they are entitled.
Q. Do you think that any connection exists between
morality and Political Economy ?
A. Most certainly; for its laws are but the teachings
how best to obey the Divine ordinance “ in the sweat of


thy brow shalt thou eat thy breadlabour is thus man’s
destiny, and by this science we learn how best to employ
it and its products for our own advantage and the benefit
of our fellow-men.
Chaptee 11.
LABOUR.
Q. You have said that Labour is man’s destiny, will
you explain how you interpret the word ?
A. Labour is the employment of the mental or bodily
faculties of man directed towards production.
Q. Is it then in the power of labour to produce objects?
A. No ! the labour of man is directed to the arrange-
ment of the elements placed before him by nature, and
adapting them to human enjoyment or use.
Q. Is production then the immediate effect of labour
applied to existing elements ?
A. It is rarely, if ever, so; since antecedent labour is
necessary to yield a result to present labour.
Q. Exemplify this position ?
A. When a man tills a field, with a view to future
production, antecedent labour has supplied him with the
plough, antecedent labour has smelted the iron which
formed the plough-share, antecedent labour has erected the
smelting works to procure the iron, antecedent labour has
quarried the metallic ore, antecedent labour has supplied
the labourer with food while raising the ore from the
mine ; in fact, nearly all labour terminating in production,
may trace back its origin to the first Divine decree, and,
from the example I have given, it is clearly impossible to
estimate the precise amount of labour necessary to pro-
duction.


Q. Have mental and bodily labour been always em-
ployed to an equal extent. ?
A. No ! for day by day the world becomes more intel-
lectual ; and, hence, bodily labour is changed for mental
toil, —thus, in former times, the galley was propelled by
rowers, when all the labour employed was bodily; then
the vessel was drawn by sails, when a portion of the labour
required for propulsion was mental; then the steam engine
was applied, and the mere animal force employed in direct-
ing a steamer is very limited indeed.
Q. What deduction do you draw from this improvement
in the world’s history ?
A. That the material well-being of man has increased,
for a higher rate of remuneration is generally given to
mental than to bodily labour.
Q. Is the end of labour attained when the product upon
which it had been employed is fitted for use ?
A. No ! it then requires further labour to place the
object within the reach of those who seek its enjoyment;
the farmer cannot sell a loaf of bread to the housekeeper,
and the labour of the dealer, the trader, and often of the
merchant, is called in to render the advantage of labour
accessible.
Q. Has not labour been sometimes turned productive
and unproductive ?
A. It has; and some political economists denominate
that labour as unproductive which does not terminate in
the creation of material wealth.
Q. Do you so understand it ?
A. Ido not. No labour can be considered as unpro-
ductive which confers a benefit, or yields a pleasure.
Q. Is there, then, no such thing as unproductive labour ?
A. It only exists when labour is misapplied. Thus,
if two men are employed to do that which one man


would do equally well, or if a man devotes, say, six
days labour to procure a certain quantity of wheat,
when, if he devoted three days labour to the cultivation of
maize, he might exchange it with somebody else for as
much wheat as it would have taken him six days to pro-
duce.
Q. Is it, then, in the power of a Government to prevent
this waste of labour ?
A. Not entirely; though the efforts of a people should
always be directed to that object, for an economy of labour,
by whatever means effected, is an economy of the aggregate
wealth of a nation leading to an increase of its material
prosperity.
Q. Are there any requisites, essential, in order that
production may receive the greatest amount of impetus
from any given employment of labour ?
A. Yes. In order that this end may be attained, it is
absolutely necessary that the labourer should have the free
choice to employ his labour in the manner most agreeable
to himself.
Q. Can you name me any other requisite ?
A. There is one other, not less important, viz.: Com-
petition combined with the full liberty of disposal of the
produce of labour ; without the former, there lacks the
incentive to perfection, and in the absence of the latter, the
labourer has no assurance of being able to enjoy the full
fruits of his labour.
Chapter 111.
CAPITAL.
Q. What is Capital ?
A. The accumulation or saving of past labour as appli-
cable to the use of present labour.


Q. What other idea do you associate with the term
“ Capital” ?
A. That of exchangeable value.
Q. Are capital and money synonymous and equivalent
terms ?
A. Not necessarily so, although capital may be
money, and money may be capital; but the talents
of the author employed in the present and available
from the employment of past labour are capital; the
the tools in trade of the workman, if acquired by
past savings of his time or money, are his capital;
in a word all that is left of the past, and that is available
for present use or employment is capital.
Q. Is it necessary that this legacy of the past should
possess reproductive power ?
A. It is not! for if I have defined capital correctly,
such definition can scarcely be altered by the intent of its
possessor. Capital is not the less capital because its
owners may think proper to let it sleep in idleness instead
of employing it.
Q. But can that which is allowed to lie idle be termed
capital to a nation ?
A. No; but it does not follow that individual capital
should be national capital, though from the desire to ob-
tain an interest or a profit it almost always becomes so.
If a miner’s shovel belonging to A lay in a corner and
were never used, it would be unproductive individual
capital, but if A lends it to B upon the condition of re-
ceiving half a crown for the use of it, it immediately be-
comes productive national capital.
Q, What effect has capital upon labour ?
A. It is the source and measure of its employment.
Q. Do you mean to say that labour cannot produce
without capital ?


A. Most certainly; labour is as utterly useless without
capital as is capital without labour.
Q. Then with a given amount of capital in a country,
only a given amount of labour can be employed.
A. Just so ; and so intimately are these two allied, that
the application of labour to any end is generally termed
the application of capital.
Q. Is it not a common idea that a combination of labour
could produce without the intervention of capital ?
A. It is among some classes of the community, but the
fallacy of the notion is very easily demonstrable; without
selecting those particular employments that require a
certain space of time before the produce of labour can
have an exchangeable value, such as the bricklayer, stone-
mason, etc., It is easy to show that a combination of shoe
makers for example, can not work without capital, although
they may be able, day by day, to capitalize a portion of
the previous days labour, for not only must capital have
supplied them with the first day of food, clothing, and
lodging, but it requires capital, to no small extent, to pro-
cure the leather with which they would commence work.
Q, What should, then, be the aim of Governments and
individuals in order to create additional productive power
with additional remuneration ?
A. To create additional capital
Q. Is not capital productively employed always to a
certain extent consumed ?
A. Yes.
Q. In this case how can national prosperity be advan-
taged by the manufacturer more than by the spendthrift ?
A. Thus ! in the one case the capital is consumed
in the wear and tear of machinery, and in the food and
clothing destroyed or worn out by workmen; but while
it is thus being destroyed, it is re-producing an increased


capital; whilst the capital expended upon articles of luxury
when once destroyed is entirely lost.
Q. How so. Does not the capital expended on articles
of luxury afford labour to those who manufacture such
articles, and is not the ultimate effect therefore the same ?
A. Not at all; it is true that as long as articles of
luxury are consumed, so long will they be manufactured ;
but when manufactured they have in no way increased
capital, and the country is all the poorer from the mis-
application of labour.
Q. Is the end of capital then to be consumed ?
A. Yes, in re-production ; nor is it an anomaly to affirm
that almost all existing capital is created from year to year.
The capital that existed a century ago has perhaps been
re-produced a hundred times during that period.
Q. Is not a Government loan an abstraction of capital
from productive employment ?
A. Yes.
Q. And yet the loan may be expended in such a way
as to afford labour to many. Is it not so ?
A. Yes.
Q. Then may not the abstraction of the productive
capital of a nation be in this case advantageous ?
A. If the loan is raised in the country itself, certainly
not; because it is merely a change of the manner in which
capital would be certainly employed, and thus withdraws
from the labourer that fund to which he had a right to
look for employment, but supplying it in another shape.
The case is somewhat altered if a loan be contracted in
another country; though even then, when a State has
contracted a debt, the chief onus of paying for the imported
capital, will fall permanently upon the working classes,
and it is doubtful if the temporary benefit is at all an
equivalent to them for the permanent burthen.


Q. Is it possible for capital and labour to be antagonistic ?
A. No, it is not possible, for in order that either may-
gain the end it seeks, they are each compelled to reciprocate
advantages ; they are only combined in an individual when
the trade that he follows is just sufficient to occupy his own
personal labour employed by his own personal capital, and
when he has a larger capital than he can utilize, he is
obliged to share its advantages with others or to lend it to
some one else to share with them in the shape of wages,
and when he does not possess sufficient capital to utilize
his labour, he loans that labour to some one else who
possesses a larger amount of capital and not an equal
means of employing it.
Q. What deductions do you draw from the definitions
you have given ?
A. That the share of capital apportioned to labour, in
other words, the amount of wages is dependent entirely
upon the amount of capital seeking employment.
Chapter IY.
PRODUCTION.
Q. To what end are labour and capital employed in
human affairs ?
A. To Production.
Q. How do you define production ?
A. As being the creation of an article having an ex-
changeable value, and which value is greater than that of
its component parts before the application of labour and
capital.
Q. But is it in the power of human nature to create ?
A. No! man can only arrange the atoms of matter
existing; he takes advantage of their natural properties,


and moves them or employs them so as to make them
useful or agreeable. Thus, man moves a seed into the
ground, and its germinating principle causes it to fructify ;
man moves an axe through a tree, and by the power of
gravitation the tree falls; he moves fire to the mineral
ore, and by the natural properties of fire he makes the
metal available for use. Man’s intellect gives him the
motive power and its direction after his will, and this
power is the only one he possesses over inanimate matter.
Q. If I understand you aright, their labour and capital,
being unaided, cannot produce ?
A. That is what I mean; labour and capital can only,
produce when aided by nature, the assistance of nature
being indispensable to the production of any object.
Q. You have said that labour is a necessary element of
production, is the education imparted to a child, at the
expenditure of both labour and capital to be classed as
aiding production ?
A. And why not; the labour and capital so expended
are intended to be restored with increase, at some future
time, to the community; and, as a rule, the labour em-
ployed in directing the power of production is as essential
as when directly employed upon production.
Q. When capital and nature have supplied the requi-
sites, does it follow that production would ensue upon the
application of labor ?
A. No ! for the value produced may be less than that
which produced it.
Q. Is that the only position in which you recognise that
labour would be unproductive ?
A. It is.
Q. Why so; have not many Political Economists pro-
nounced that labor to be unproductive which does not lead
to the increase of material wealth ?


A. They have; but incorrectly. The potter moulds
an earthen vessel; the form remains ; and the object ac-
quires a value through the application of labour. A pro-
fessor delivers a lecture, his labour passes away in the
delivery; but, in the same way as the shape impressed
upon the earthen vessel remains, so does the result of the
professor’s lecture remain in the minds of his pupils, to be
ultimately directed to the increased well-being of the human
race.
Q. But, if this given amount of instruction do not lead
to the increase of material wealth, how can the science of
Political Economy recognise it as productive labour ?
A. So long as industry and order are the result of
virtue, and tend to the well-being of a nation, so long
must the teachings of virtue itself, resulting in conduct
which increases the material riches of a people, be con-
sidered a necessary branch of Political Economy.
Q. Your argument may be a moral one, but does not
the science of which we are treating limit in a great mea-
sure its studies to the production of riches, and their ex-
changeable value ?
A. And it is just for that reason that I have employed
the foregoing arguments, since if the activity, knowledge,
and intelligence of man impress objects with an exchange-
able value, the mental instruction which gives that know-
ledge must in itself have a value in exchange—become a
chief element in production, and a primary consideration
in the study of Political Economy.
Chapter V.
WAGES.
Q. How do you define Wages ?
A. As being that proportion of capital which, in ex-
change for their labour, is yielded to those who do not
possess capital.


Q. Is not all capital available for wages ?
A. No ! a portion is placed in providing the elements
supplied by nature and past capital; a portion in the per-
sonal expenditure of the capitalist; a portion in those
appliances that render labour available and accessible; and
the remaining portion only can be employed for wages.
Q. Why do not all who bring their labour to market
obtain in exchange an equal share of the disposable capital
of the community ?
A. Because there is a difference in their skill, their
ability to work, and also because some employments are
more attractive than others.
Q. But what is the reason that when an employment
is attractive the wages procurable in that employment
should be less ?
A. Because the supply of labour to such employment
will be the greater.
Q Are wages then regulated by demand and supply ?
A. They are, but not by these only.
Q. What other circumstance regulates wages ?
A. The proportion between labour and capital. Thus,
if the capital of a country increase the rate of wages will
increase for the share of capital available for the payment
of labour will be augmented, and if the capital of a country
diminish in the same way, the rate of wages must fall.
Thus, if wages be high, and there be no diminution in the
number of those seeking employment, there is every reason
to believe that the capital of the country is increasing;
while, on the other hand, if there be no material increase
of population, but the rate of wages is continually declining,
we may feel assured that a prospect of more profitable em-
ployment, arising too often from bad legislation at home,
or better legislation abroad, is inducing the withdrawal of
capital from the community; nor can this be controlled
by the will of a people, though it may be influenced by
their rulers.


Q. But without an increase of capital or a decrease in
the quantity of labour, is not the rate of wages higher
when in ordinary "parlance trade is brisk ?
A. Such is the case ; but it is somewhat erroneous to
say that there is no increase of capital.- Capital in the
aggregate has not increased ; but the capital available for
wages has increased, for as I have before said a portion of
national capital is always lying dormant in the purchase of
those elements which are supplied by nature and past
capital, and these, after the application of labour, become
what is designated stock in tx*ade. If this stock in trade
instead of lying idle for a time is immediately convertible,
the capitalist seeks more labour to replace it, and that
portion of capital which was for the moment locked up,
becomes immediately available as a labour fund, but if
this increase in wages has been caused without an increase
of capital it will certainly fluctuate, and the improvement
in the rate of wages one year will be followed by corres-
ponding depression in the next, when the liberated capital
shall be again locked up.
Q. But will not permanent prosperity in trade, by
tending to an increase of capital, lead to a permanent
improvement in the rate of wages ?
A. Most certainly.
Q. By what mode can such permanent prosperity be
brought about ?
A. By the largest possible increase in the purchasers of
the products of labour; in other words, by devoting the
extremest amount of national energy to that which a nation
can either produce or manufacture cheaper than .other
nations.
Q. Will not high prices induce high wages ?
A. No ! not if the high prices are confined to the com-
munity itself, for high prices to be paid by one portion of
a people whose means for making such payment are not
increased, to another portion of the same people, can only
c 2


benefit one class at the expense of others; while if the
high prices are caused by a body of clients abroad com-
peting in purchase, the amount of national capital will be
increased, and a larger proportion will be available for a
labour fund.
Q. What is the reason why among different nations, to
all appearances equally prosperous, there should be such a
difference in the rate of wages ?
A. Because of the different ratio between capital and
population, and which can only be corrected by an im-
portation of the one or an exportation of the other respec-
tively.
Q. Can you explain why, as a general rule, wages are
high in a new colony ?
A. Because, in consequence of the super-abundant ele-
ments of production afforded by nature, capital increases
in a more rapid ratio than labour.
Q. Coulcf either legal enactments, or combination
among workmen, permanently raise the rate of wages ?
A. It is altogether impossible ; for, supposing by such
enactment, or such combination, the rate of wages were
fixed at twenty shillings a day, and that the proportion
between capital and those seeking its uses allowed but the
share of fifteen shillings a day, it is clear, either that those
seeking employment would have exhausted in fifteen days
the fund available for twenty days, and then remain idle
for five days ; or, that one-fourth of those seeking wages
would be idle during the entire period of twenty days.
Q. What do you point out as being the most efficacious
permanent preventive to low wages ?
A . The mental enlightenment of those who seek em-
ployment, enabling them not only to recognise the fact,
but to assist in its realization, —that all circumstances
which tend to the increase of capital conduce to their own
material well-being.


Chapter YI.
VALUE.
Q. What is Value ?
A. The comparison of objects in exchange.
Q. What interpretation do you give to the word,
“Riches”?
A. Riches are objects that have a value in exchange.
Q. Is not your interpretation of these two words rather
similar ?
A. No ! Riches are objects themselves; Value is a
quality of those objects.
Q. Are value and price synonymous terms ?
A. No ! Value is a property that one object possesses
relatively to another; price is the money value of the
object; value existed when, in the earliest ages, men
carried on their exchanges by simple barter, thus, if one
exchanged a measure of wheat for a sheep, the value of
the two was equal, but price—which is the emblem of
money, did not exist.
Q. But, nevertheless, if an object has a value of five
shillings in exchange, and its price is five shillings, is not
the one term expressive of the other ?
A. No ! I repeat, price is but the result of the compa-
rative value of money with the article, and is not the
value of the article itself. If money became very abun-
dant in a community, it is certain that a larger quantity of
it would be given in exchange for any article, and in this
case the comparative value would be diminished, while the
price would be increased.
Q. Upon what does the value of an article depend ?
A. Upon the demand and supply.
c 3


Q. Is it possible that, in consequence of any increased
demand or diminished supply, there would be a simulta-
neous rise or fall in the value of an article ?
A. No! for value is a relative idea; and, if the value of
one object rises, it follows that the value of some other
object placed in comparison with it has fallen.
Q. Does not scarcity effect an alteration in value ?
A. It does ; but arising only from the larger amount of
other articles that the community is willing to cede to
obtain possession of the one that is scarce ; thus, if there
be a famine, the value of bread will be greater, not be-
cause its own intrinsic worth will have increased, but
because we are willing to relinquish a larger quantity of
other values to obtain it.
Q. Can you point out any necesary qualification of
value ?
A. Yes ; utility or the power of gratification.
Q. Has the nature of that gratification any influence
upon value ?
A. No; for the value we may attach to our pleasures'
is often as great as the value of those objects necessary to
afford us subsistence.
Q. Have immaterial objects or, rather, services a value ?
A. Certainly; if we are disposed to yield in exchange
for them objects that have a value in exchange.
Q. Can you give me a brief definition of value as
applied to human affairs ?
A. It is the power an object possesses of enabling its
owner to acquire objects in exchange.
Q. You have said that riches are objects that have a
value in exchange, but is it not quite possible that what
may be riches in one country are no longer so in another ?
A. It is, for the value in exchange can only be appre-
ciated by the amount of gratification that the possession of


riches will afford, and that which may have a value in one
community may probably be valueless in another.
Q. What is the chief source of the increase in the
value of riches ?
A, The efforts of labour in producing in greater quan-
tity those objects whose possession is either useful or agree-
able, and thus, vice versa , all increase of riches tends to
lower the value of objects.
Q. Riches being a total of values possessed, how can a
nation become richer by having reduced the value of a
product in diminished cost of production ?
A. The reduction in the cost of a product will in all
probability have increased its consumption and consequent
production, and value being a relative qualification, all
other values relative to the one in question will have in-
creased by just so much as the other has diminished, and
therefore the total of values will have augmented.
Q. You say that the consumption and consequent pro-
duction would probably have increased, Explain how the
doubling the entire products of a country, without in-
creased cost of production, will, notwithstanding diminution
in price, have doubled national riches.
A. Because each product will be exchangeable for
exactly double the quantity of other products and the
enjoyments of the community, and thereby the riches of
the nation will be doubled accordingly.
Chapter VII.
MONEY.
Q. What is Money ?
A. Money is that object which is the measure of value,
and at the same time its equivalent.
Q. What is the use of Money ?


A. To designate the ratio existing between different
values.
Q. Has the necessity for this distinction always existed ?
A. No! It did not become necessary until by the di-
vision of labour a man’s own exertions no longer sufficed
to supply all his own wants, and a medium was then re-
quired to indicate the value of services or objects ex-
changed.
Q. Why are the precious metals employed as money to
a greater or less extent in all civilized countries ?
A. Because of their durability, their value in compari-
son with other objects, and their power of subdivision and
re-union.
Q. Is there no other qualification to recommend them ?
A. Yes ! that they are not as liable as other commo-
dities to sudden and great fluctuations of value, and there-
fore that they form the best medium for the adjustment of
a difference in value at any future period.
Q. Money being a measure of value, is it equally so of
riches ?
A. No! for a man may be more wealthy in parting
with money to obtain commodities, than in parting with
commodities to obtain money, his riches being merely the
amount of his possessions, which, by their value in ex-
change enable him to obtain the largest possible amount of
gratifications.
Q. But, are not objects purchased by money ?
A. No ! if the exchange be pursued to its origin, it will
be found that money is merely the ticket enabling its
owner to obtain from the community such services or
objects as he may desire in exchange for services rendered,
or objects yielded to the community by himself, or by
some one else for him at some previous period. The rent
that a man pays to his landlord is really the landlord’s
share of his property ; the wages that a farmer pays to his


ploughman are the ploughman’s share of the produce of his
farm ; money is only used as a vehicle of exchange be-
cause it is more convenient to both parties.
Q. Do you mean, then, that the relation of objects to
one another, that is to say, one being cheaper or one
dearer, is not altered by the interposition of money ?
A. I do; objects that would exchange for one another
would continue to do so, whatever be their money value,
their position is only altered in so far as they ex-
change with money.
Q. What is the cause of the difference that arises in
the relative value of money and objects ?
A. Money being a commodity, the difference is to be
found only in the ratio between demand and supply.
Q. When you speak of the demand and supply of money
as a commodity, do you infer that money is bought and
sold as other commodities ?
A. I do; the seller of any object in exchanging that
object for money is a buyer of money, in the same way as
the purchaser is a seller. This can be easily exemplified
when a period of commercial panic exists, many being
desirous of buying money, objects are ceded at a lower
price to obtain it, and thus the value of money is said to
rise ; but when the quantity of goods in a market to be
exchanged for money is small, a larger amount of money
will be ceded to obtain them, and thus the value of money
will be said to fall.
Q. Will not this argument apply to services equally
with objects ?
A. It will; if the supply of objects and of labour be
great in proportion to the supply of money, the demand for
money will increase, and, vice versa, it will thus be seen
that the value of money increases in an inverse ratio to
the supply.


Q. Is it a correct term for individuals to employ tc say
that they are in want of money.
A. No ! the proper interpretation is, that that they are
in want of objects or services, which others may desire, to
exchange for money which others may possess; if one man
possessed ten pounds, and the remainder of a community
one hundred pounds each, the poorer man would be equally
poor if his own money being increased to one hundred
pounds, that of his neighbours was increased tp one thou-
sand pounds each, for the relative value of all objects to
be exchanged for money would remain the same.
Q. Is it just and equitable that an increase of wages,
that is, of the money paid for labour, should follow upon
an increased price of food ?
A. No! for the increased price of food arises from a
diminution in the supply, when it behoves an entire com-
munity to consume less, and hence it is an injustice to give
to any an increase of wages, so supplying them with the
means of consuming an equal amount of food, when the
quantity at the disposal of all is diminished.
Q. Is, then, the want of money in a time of scarcity
to be regretted, when the money that a community pre-
viously possessed has been applied to the purchase of
food ?
A. No; but the want, or scarcity of food would be a
subject of regret.
Q. Should a high value of money caused by the with-
drawal, or limitation of supply during a period of antici-
pated scarcity, be considered as a blessing or the reverse ?
A. Decidedly as a blessing, as consequent higher prices
will compel the community to economize their consump-
tion, and thus, in the ordinary course of affairs, to ward off
absolute starvation.
Q. To what cause do you attribute scarcity of money
in a community?


A. To scarcity of skill—absence of energy—poverty of
intellect, idleness, and probably bad habits.
Q. What means would you employ to increase money,
or the ratio of values in a community ?
A. Instruction ; in training the young and teaching the
old.
Chapter VIII.
CREDIT AND CURRENCY
Q. What is Credit?
A. A symbol of indebtedness for which the lender ex-
pects to receive future value.
Q. What is the use of credit ?
A. To supplement the use of money in increasing a
representation of value in Exchange, and in equalizing
such value to the community at large.
Q. In what manner does credit serve to equalize value ?
A. By affording the necessary time for production and
realization; thus, if a manufacturer were at the same
time a retailer, instead of selling his goods on credit to this
latter, his factory would remain out of work, and his
capital lie idle during the time necessary for the public to
purchase and consume his manufacture.
Q. Does credit, then, increase capital?
A. Not directly, though it has that effect in an indirect
form, by enabling capital to be turned over more frequently
since credit gives the temporary employment of other
capital.
Q. What do you mean by temporary employment?
A. That any value obtained on credit has, bona fide, to


be paid out of capital at a future time; credit merely
defers the payment.
Q. What name is given to the value of capital during
the period of this deferred payment ?
A. Discount.
Q. Is not credit liable to abuse?
A. It is, but that is no argument against its advantages
which tend to call into the extremest activity the produc-
tive powers of a community.
Q. How may credit be abused ?
A. By parties contracting engagements knowing at the
time that they so contract them that they will be unable
to pay them.
Q. What remedy can be found to this abuse of Credit ?
A. That alone which results from a moral training;
teaching each man to seek and employ only so much credit
as would be certainly yielded to him, were the person
giving credit to be as intimately acquainted with his own
concerns as he is himself.
Q. Is it in the power of any one to guard himself
against the evils that may ensue from the abuse of credit ?
A. Certainly, in a great measure, since those evils will
be generally found to take their origin not from giving
credit to others, so much as taking credit from others.
Q. What is the influence of credit ?
A. It regulates price in a far greater degree than money
itself, in consequence of its more extended action.
Q. Is the enjoyment of credit advantageous or other-
wise to a community ?
A. It is, in a high degree, advantageous, for suppose
that a manufacturer traded upon his capital only, and that
this capital represented by ten thousand pounds could his
factory be turned over only once in a year, he would


find it necessary in order to gain One thousand pounds to
make the public pay a profit of ten per cent upon his
manufacture; but supposing that by the aid of credit he
was enabled to turn over his capital four times in the
year, he would be enabled to supply the public on a profit
to him of three per cent, allowing at the same time, a
reasonable price for the use of the credit employed ; thus
credit in increasing production would serve to diminish
price.
Q. How do you sum up the advantages of credit ?
A. That credit in a community serves as capital.
Q. What is the meaning of currency ?
A. The circulation of values.
Q. Do you mean by that expression the circulation of
those commodities or products which constitute wealth. ?
A. Not at all, but merely the circulation of values, as
represented by money.
Q. What is the usual form of currency among civilized
nations ?
A. The precious metals and paper.
Q. Which of these two forms of currency is the more
advantageous ?
A. It is impossible to say that one is more advantageous
than the other, for in a State exhibiting great commercial
activity both are actually necessary, though even in such
case it is quite certain that a paper currency which is only
the symbol of a debt, and, therefore, another form of credit
could not safely exist, unless it were based upon metallic
currency, that is to say for example, that a five pound
note would be a dangerous currency unless the holder of
it has it in his power to demand or exchange for it at any
time, five sovereigns or their equivalent exchangeable
value.


Q. Might not any other valuable commodity serve as a
basis for paper currency equally as well as gold or silver
bullion ?
A. Certainly, if all nations would at all times recognize
that other article of equal value in exchange ; the chief
reason why gold and silver are selected is because they
have a value recognised by all, and which quality is
possessed in the same degree by no other commodity.
Q. Can a currency be extended or contracted at the
will of Governments or individuals ?
A. Not permanently, for no larger amount of currency
can be employed in a country than the actual circulation
of commodities renders necessary.
Q, Is there not a general idea that a contraction of the
currency, or a limitation of credit induces a commercial
crisis ?
A. There is; but these are the effects and not the cause
which may be found in the very simple law of nature, that
a commercial crisis is induced by there being more sellers
than buyers in a community, inducing, thereby, diminution
of price, and restriction of credit.
Q. What deduction do you draw from the remarks you
have made upon currency ?
A. That currency is the credit form of capital, and can
only permanently increase or diminish with it.
Chapter IX.
COMMERCE.
Q. What is Commerce?
A. It is that branch of human industry which causes a
product, either indigenous or foreign, to be placed within
the reach of him who desires its use or enjoyment.


Q. In what way does commerce aid production ?
A. In increasing the number of consumers by transport-
ing products from place to place.
Q. Why are products so transported ?
A. Because in consequence of the difference of soil or
climate they are of a different nature in different countries,
and by the aid of commerce the products of all countries
are placed within the reach of the inhabitants of one.
Q. But, would it not be possible for a country to pro-
duce within its own boundaries all the products of which it
stood in need ?
A. No ! for not only does the law of nature militate
against this isolation, for the reason I have before stated,
but, moreover, it is impossible that the same conditions of
labour could exist in every place, and hence would arise a
greater or less difference in the cost of production in dif-
ferent countries, and which might in some cases be so
great as to preclude consumption.
Q. Would it not be of advantage to preclude con-
sumption, so that native industry might be protected ?
A. That is not possible; nor can the limitation of the
enjoyments of a commnnity tend either to its happiness or
to its prosperity.
Q. But, are there not some people who urge that by the
creation of native industry, the wealth of the community
is increased by the retention of money in the country.
A. Doubtless there are some who urge this, in the same
way as there are some who once believed that the sun re-
volved round the earth, but the erroneous idea arises
chiefly from their adherence to an obsolete doctrine called
the Balance of Trade.
Q. What is the doctrine you speak of ?
A. A doctrine that held that if a country imported more
than it exported, the difference was loss, and which loss
n 2


could be increased by the necessity of payment in coin,
thereby diminishing by so much the riches of the country.
Q. Wherein consists the error of this doctrine ?
A. Its whole conception is an error; it supposes, in the
first place, that a country can import more than it can pay
for, which is absurd, and the absurdity is increased by the
supposition that coin is wealth.
Q. How do you explain that it is absurd to consider
that a country can import more than it can pay for ?
A. Because it supposes that one body of human la-
bourers shall, without receiving value in exchange, be
contented to make a gift of the produce of their labour to
another body of labourers, and inasmuch as none give, but
all exchange, it follows that either by direct or indirect
channels the value of the imports and exports of any
country at the place where the exports are exchanged for
imports must in a series of years be exactly balanced.
Q. Will you exemplify this statement ?
A. I will endeavour to do so ; but, in order to approach
conciseness, must reduce trade to its simplest elements; —
a community being only an assemblage of individuals, I
will assume an individual. A, as trading in London, and
another, B, as trading in Sydney; B sends to England
one thousand pounds worth of wool, being the produce of
his flocks, and which A sells for eleven hundred pounds,
investing this amount in merchandize to be shipped to B,
and which merchandise upon its arrival in the Colony has
a value of twelve hundred pounds; thus far the transaction
is clear, B has imported two hundred pounds more than he
exported, and is by that much the richer, the difference
being profit. Now, let me suppose that the wool sold for
only nine hundred pounds. A, having faith in B’s in-
tegrity still ships the eleven hundred pounds worth of
goods, but which on arrival in the Colony prove to be
worth no more than their cost, so that B remains indebted
to A for two hundred pounds, to be paid out of capital, or


the net year’s revenue. Now, C determines upon coming
out to the Colony, and applies to A for a draft on Sydney
for two hundred pounds ; A draws on B for this amount
which, although not figuring as an export, will certainly
have paid B’s debt. Again, suppose there should be no C
coming out to the Colony, B may have sold two hundred
pounds worth of sheep to I) in Victoria, and balances his
account with A by a draft from that Colony, and failing
all these aids, it is clear that when B remits to A the one
thousand pounds produce of his flocks in the following year,
A will retain from it the two hundred pounds due to him, I
say as I said before that to imagine A should for a series
of years continue to give credit to B, while a large sum
was owing to him is in the highest degree absurd.
Q. This explains why B’s credit should be limited by
the amount he can pay for, but does not explain why it
may not be disadvantageous for coin, which is the circu-
lating medium, to leave the country.
A. I have already explained on a previous occasion that
coin is not wealth, nor is it even necessary as a circulating
medium. Suppose that B’s crop of wheat failed so that
B were starving, B had fifty sovereigns, and A had a
hundred bushels of wheat, it is certain that B would not
purchase wheat with sovereigns, if he had anything else to
offer in exchange, because sending away money entails a
certain cost without any chance of profit, and if therefore
obliged to send away sovereigns it would not be a misfor-
tune, but a blessing that B had the coin to send out of the
country to pay for the wheat; the misfortune is that the
crop failed.
Q. What is meant by the term, free-trade ?
A. That state of international relations under which
each individual of a community is left free to devote his
energies and his labour in the way that seems to him the
most profitable, and to exchange their product freely for
those products of other countries which he may desire.
d 3


Q. Does free trade imply that products arriving from
other countries should be exempt from taxation ?
A. No! it recognises the necessity of taxation as
fiscal aid.
Q. What is protection ?
A. That state of a community when its energy and
labour is directed into channels into which it would not
naturally flow, and the community at large becomes taxed
for the advantages of some of its members.
Q. Is this a healthy state of society ?
A. No ! and not only is not healthy in misdirecting
labour, curtailing comforts, and diminishing production,
but it is moreover opposed to natural laws.
Q. How do you explain that it is opposed to natural
laws ?
A. Because protection compels men to reject the volun-
tary aid of nature. Nature and nature’s laws have made
the cost of products different in different countries, and
some portion of the cheapness of any imported commodity
is a spontaneous gift of nature.
Q. Can you give me any homely example of the po-
sition you uphold ?
A. Certainly ; here is one, —Pine apples are imported
into this Colony from Queensland at a cost of perhaps 3d.
to 6d. each, which sum has to be paid in produce or in
coin, if a protective duty were levied upon pine apples of
five shillings each, no more would be imported from
Queensland, but they would be grown in the Colony at a
greatly increased expenditure of labor and capital; the
cost being increased the consumption would fall off, and
many who now consume pine apples would do so no
longer. Labourers who are now digging for gold W'ould
be employed in raising pine apples; the aggregate national
wealth and the total of comforts would be diminished,
while the community would be taxed to support the


growers of pine apples, and all this evil would have been
brought about because nature enabled another place to
grow a product at 3d, which we refused to accept at that
rate, though not able ourselves to produce it for less than
five shillings.
Q. The argument that you have used carries weight in
reference only to natural productions, how does it apply to
manufactures ?
A. In exactly the same manner, since the reason that
any article can be manufactured more cheaply in one
place than another is to be found in the fact that nature or
adventitious circumstance such as capital, labor, &c., has
varied the cost of production.
Q. But would not the new employment of labour you
have indicated encourage native industry ?
A. No more than it could be encouraged by re-building
a house that had been burned down by a fire; labour in
each case could be expended to make up for a waste, a de-
struction of capital, and which labour would have been
more profitably employed to the community, had such
waste never taken place.
Q. Can you give me any brief exposition, shewing that
the laws of nature inculcate the doctrine of free trade ?
A. I can; inasmuch as Divine laws have pointed out
labour as man’s destiny, and have endowed him with cer-
tain wants, it has been so arranged that none of those
wants can be supplied, save by the result of his own
labour, or that of some other individual who at an ante-
cedent period had worked for him; so, a community being
a collection of individuals, nothing can be consumed by a
nation that is not earned by their labour,* this being the
case, it is clear that nature and nature’s laws will be best
* This point cannot be too strongly inculcated, for, strange as
it may seem, there are still many people who will not believe that
no man gives, but all men exchange, the produce of their labour.


carried into effect by man supplying with his toil the
largest possible number of his wants ; row, if an individual
by growing a pound of wool, which he may represent by
half a day’s labour, can send this wool to a country to
which China was indebted and obtain in exchange a pound
of tea, he will be clearly in a position to supply a larger
number of his wants than if he were to attempt to grow a
pound of tea under a hot-house at a cost to him of a
whole day’s labour; and protection at all times is but
another term for the home-erected hot-house.
Q. What is the influence of free trade upon the
working classes of the community ?
*A. That of increasing their comforts by enabling them
to avail themselves to the utmost of nature’s bounty, and
satisfy their wants at the smallest possible expenditure.
Q. Can trade have any influence over the social and
moral well-being of a community ?
A. Certainly, for the greater the number of comforts
placed within reach of its members, the less distress and
vice is likely to exist.
Q. In what manner are these comforts likely to be
secured ?
A. By leaving trade entirely free and unfettered;
allowing every man to employ his energies, capital, and
labour as he thinks best; not taxing one class of the com-
munity for the benefit of another, but seeking to induce all
nations to pour into the lap of the one all those products
and blessings which may tend to the comfort and well
being of its inhabitants.
Chapter X.
TAXATION.
Q. What is Taxation ?
A. Taxation is the abstraction of some portion of the


capital or revenue of an individual, in aid of the good
government of the state of which he is a member.
Q. What is a tax ?
A. A tax represents the portion, or value of the portion,
so abstracted.
Q. Can taxes be considered as a burden upon a com-
munity ?
A. As long as their produce is economically admin-
istered, and serves to secure order and peace and pro-
tection to property, together with a healthy and prompt
administration of justice, the means of speedy and useful
communication, and security from foreign invasion, tax£s
become really benefits to a community.
Q. In order to secure these ends, what is the primary
requisite of taxation ?
A. That taxes should be imposed and their produce
expended by those alone who will be called upon to pay
them.
Q. What are the fundamental laws that should guide
the imposition of taxes ?
A. They are these : firstly, that the subjects of every
State ought to contribute towards the support of its govern-
ment as nearly as possible in proportion to their respective
abilities ; secondly, that a tax should be certain and not
arbitrary, and the payment clear; thirdly, every tax ought
to be levied at the time, and in the manner in which it is
most likely to be convenient for the contributor to pay it;
fourthly, every tax ought to be so contrived as to take out
and keep out of the pockets of the people as little as
possible over and above what it brings in to the public
treasury ; fifthly, that a tax should not be of such a nature
as will afford the intended contributor either the oppor-
tunity or the chance of evading it.
Q. Is it possible to devise any one tax which should
answer all these requisites ?


A. It is not possible; no single tax could in an exactly
equal degree fulfil even the first condition, and a system
of taxation should therefore be a series of proportions
adapted to the abilities of various tax payers, when the
defects of each impost could correct one another so as to
form an harmonious whole.
Q. How are taxes primarily divided ?
A. Into direct and indirect.
Q. How do you distinguish these two forms of taxation?
A. Direct taxes are those that fall directly upon the
individual and from *vhich he has not the power or oppor-
tunity to escape ; indirect taxes are those which in order to
obtain a certain enjoyment he voluntarily undertakes.
Q. What are the forms these two kinds of taxation
assume ?
A. The principal direct taxes are a poll tax, a land
tax, a house tax, a stamp tax, a license to trade tax, a
property tax, and an income tax; indirect taxes are
customs and excise duties.
Q. What is the incidence of direct and indirect tax-
ation ?
A. Direct taxes chiefly fall upon the wealthy classes of
the community, while indirect taxes are chiefly contributed
by the lower orders and that in a great measure in con-
sequence of their greater number ?
Q. Are not then direct preferable to indirect taxes ?
A. The question cannot be debated in a community
where universal suffrage exists, for the incomes of the lower
orders can only be reached by indirect taxation, con-
sequently they could have no right to a voice which might
lead to imposing burdens upon the backs of others unless
they are also contented to bear their share.


Q. Do you then consider both systems of taxation as
being necessary ?
A. I do ; for the reasons I have before stated that the
one serves to correct the inequality of the other.
Q. Can prohibitory and protective taxes be ever
justifiable ?
A. Prohibitory taxes can never be so, because they
destroy revenue; but protective duties if not justifiable
may be excused.
Q. How so ? and how do you reconcile this idea with
the axioms of free trade ?
A. Because there are higher laws than economic laws,
and the first necessity of a State is that its revenue should
be proportionably raised from amongst all its citizens, nor
can any be exempt from taxation; for individuals as much
as property require the safeguard of the law ; if then the
lower orders of a democratic community refuse to pay
taxes except such as are created by protective imposts,
and they, having the power of taxation, are willing to pay
protective imposts, it is more just that they should be
made to contribute to the revenue in this form than that
they should be altogether exempt from taxation.
Q. You have referred to protective duties as specially
imposing taxes upon the poorer classes; is this the case ?
A. Most certainly. Protective duties, upon whatever
articles levied, are the most onerous of all taxes, and are
raised almost entirely from the working population; and
the lower the rate of wages, and the poorer the individual,
the more oppressive will he feel the burden of the tax.
Q. Do I then understand that under any circumstance
you justify protective laws ?
A. Not at all; but I point out a position of affairs
when the evil of protection is less than another evil.
