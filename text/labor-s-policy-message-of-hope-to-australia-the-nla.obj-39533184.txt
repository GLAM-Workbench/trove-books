LABOR’S
POLICY
MESSAGE OF HOPE
TO AUSTRALIA
J. A. BEASLEY, M.H.R.
The stirring Policy Speech delivered
at Sydney Town Hall, on Dec. 3, by
J. A. Beasley, Fed. Leader
of the Australian Labor Party.


THE PEOPLE MUST RULE!
Money must be a Servant —Not a Dictator.
Under the existing financial control, Primary
Producers must continue in Slavery.
Private Banking Institutions can defeat the
Farmers’ Pool Marketing Schemes and
by forcing them to sell on a low market
lose the benefit of their labor.
Labor’s policy of a Producer-Controlled
Marketing System, supported by a
Nationalised Banking System, is the
only Road to Freedom.


LABOR’S
MESSAGE OF HOPE
TO AUSTRALIA
The opening of this campaign to-
night will make the most important
period in the history of politics in
Australia. We have been through many
campaigns since the introduction of
responsible Government in this coun-
try. But on each occasion the re-
spective parties have put forward
their programmes without dealing
with the very issue which controls
the life-blood of industry. There can
be many reasons put forward as to
why such has been the case. The
main factor being that while we have
had our difficulties in the past, never
before have we faced in Australia a
crisis similar to that through which
we are passing at the present time.
It is because of these circumstances
that this great opportunity has been
given the Labor Party to boldly tackle
the real problem, namely, the control
of the credit resources of the coun-
try. Without declaring for a change
in this direction, it is absolutely use-
less for any political party to sug-
gest, or even attempt to deal with
the problems that confront our peo-
ple. To put before the people a
policy of social reform or extensive
schemes of public works without first
dealing with the means whereby
these things can be carried out is
simply humbugging the people. For
the past number of years Labor at
each successive election, it must be
admitted, has put forward its pro-
gramme of social reconstruction, and
while it had a definite policy laid
down in its platform to deal with
the monetary system the leaders of
the parties in the Federal sphere
never gave sufficient prominence to
it. They have talked of many things
and even on the occasion of the last
appeal to the people, when arbitration
figured largely, it must be admitted
that even with the most scientific
piece of arbitration machinery its
value is entirely lost when we have
an army of 400,000 unemployed.
FINANCIAL BOYCOTT
A further illustration can be sub-
mitted, and is proved by recent hap-
penings, that the power of finance
is so great that with one fell swoop
it can remove, or partly so, all the so-
cial legislation by operating a boycott
upon the industries in the country.
Following the boycott is a large army
of unemployed, and that is our posi-
tion in this country at the present
time. The real power to deal with
this problem is centred in the Com-
monwealth Parliament. State Par-
liaments are unable to deal effec-
tively with this matter. Their rights
in regard to currency problems were
taken away some years ago with the
establishment of the Commonwealth
Eank and the power to issue currency
being placed entirely in the hands of
those controlling that institution.
Therefore, the States are entirely de-
pendent upon this authority. They
have no legislative power to inter-
fere. While the assets of the parti-
cular States may be sufficient, and
are. as in the case of New South
Wales, to back the flow of credit
which is so badly needed, yet in
spite of having the assets the State
cannot, undertake the task unless the
Commonwealth authorities permit
them to do so. Therefore, It will be
seen that whatever feelings indivi-
duals mav have towards States and
their failure to meet the reouire-
ments of the people, it must be clearly
understood that the power* is not in
their hands to do so. and the atten-
tion of all concerned mu«t be direc-
ted upon those responsible. There-
fore. it is the Commonwealth Par-
liament’s obligation, and that being
so. this election provides the oppor-
tunity for directing the people to the
real cause, and at the same time en-
abling the parties seeking their sup-
port to put forward their remedies
to meet the situation.
NATIONALISTS’ RESPONSIBILITY.
Prior to the present Government
coming into office, the Nationalist
Party ruled in Commonwealth politics
for about 15 years. All during the
war period and following on they
were entirely responsible for the
policy that was pursued, and the cir-
cumstances in which the people find
themselves to-day had their begin-
ning during the periods referred to.
Their Government was not the peo-
ple’s Government. It stood for big


business and the policy of private
finance, and its direction in regard
to these matters generally came from
the other side of the world. Proof
of this fact can be established by the
simultaneous action regarding the
move taken by Great Britain in 1924
when Sir Montague Norman, Gover-
nor of the Bank of England, directed
the British Government of the day to
revert to the gold standard. Their
purpose of course in this action was
to enable them to give effect to a
monetary policy which would enable
them to make the bank created credit
of the war period equally as valuable
in purchasing power as that which
prevailed prior to the war. Much
about the same time the Bruce-Page
Government took a similar course in
Australia by amendments of the
Commonwealth Bank Act, which took
the power of the control of the bank
ti’om the people, placed it tinder a
board to be responsible to no one.
and entirely in the hands of the pri-
vate banking institutions.
A BANKERS’ BANK.
In other words, it was chang-
ed from the people's bank to
the bankers' bank, and thus per-
mitted of a uniform policy as
directed bv the Bank of England to
bo carried out here in Australia.
From then on we can trace the Policy
known as deflation, and in the his-
tory of all countries it has been
shown that such a policy in its train
brings business bankruptcy, unem-
ployment, and general chaos. Fol-
lowing on from that period the peo-
ple gradually became convinced that
there were forces operating in this
country that were tending towards
circumstances that we now sec. It
can be safely stated that the public,
while not being able to visualise in
every detail the future, were satisfied
that the time had arrived for a change
of Government, and nn.tm'ally a
change in policy. So that in 1928,
the general elections, the Nation-
alist Party suffered some very se-
vere reverses, the Labor Party being
returned in much larger numbers
than had been the cases on former
occasions. The real test then set in.
With a formidable opposition pledged
to the people’s cause, the Govern-
ment. under the leadership of Mr.
Bruce, only lasted ten months, and the
issue upon which the final vote was
taken centred around the question of
arbitration.
SCULLIN’S VICTORY.
The appeal was then made to
the people, and the issue upon
which the Government was de-
feated loomed largely in the cam-
paign, but there were other matters
of a deeper economic consequence
which the thinking sections of the
community felt needed adjustment,
and because it was recognised up to
that stage that the Labor Party, hav-
ing- no secret alliances with private
finance, they were the only people
that could be trusted to tackle the
problem. The Nationalist Party, as
is generally recognised, is subject to
the direction of those forces, and as
its policy had been responsible for
the circumstances then existing it
was only the natural thing for the
people *to turn to a party free from
the financial alliances of the Bruce-
Fage Government, and as a conse-
quence they returned the Scullin Go-
vernment to power, with the great-
est majority any party has ever had
in the history of the Commonwealth
Government. Their difficulty was to
in.mediately correct the wrongs
which the Bruce-Page Government
had been responsible for. All eyes
were turned in their direction, and
every move they took was watched
closely by the people, behind which
was the hope that very soon the force
that had been throttling the com-
munity would be dealt with. Their
watch has been a long and anxious
one. and the circumstances of to-day
have created in the minds of the
people bitter disappointment. At the
beginning the Government set out to
deal with the financial mess that
Bruce and Page had been responsible
for in regard to debts not only at
home but abroad. Policy of protec-
tion was given effect to; in fact in
some instances in regard to imports
a total prohibition was observed. Gold
was shipped to London for the pur-
pose of meeting demands that were
imposed from that quarter, and pri-
mary producers were urged to grow
more of their products for shipment
abroad.
BRITAIN SPURNS OUR WHEAT.
In this respect a tribute must
be paid to the rural community
for their ready response to the call
in this direction. “Grow more wheat’*
was the slogan emblasoned through-
out Australia. But the sorry spec-
tacle of after having done so the
wheat lying rotting at country sid-
ings could be seen in all parts of the
country. The only market of any
consequence that was secured for
our wheat was the Eastern countries
of China and Japan. The British
Government, to whom many conces-
sions are given regarding their manu-
factured goods, did not see fit to
reciprocate with the purchase of our
primary products, but took advantage
of cheaper wheat of nearer countries
whose economic situation was entirely
different to that of Australia, and as
a result their products could be pt'o-
duced much cheaper.
This policy occupied several months
of the early life of the Government,
but during that period these correc-
tive measures, while attempting to
meet the x external situation, were
creating more unemployment within


the country itself —therefore prov-
ing that, while giving effect to the
Government's policy on the one hand
jn connection with safeguarding our
secondary industries from low wage
countries, it was necessary on the
other to give effect to Labor’s poiicy
for the purpose of developing these
secondary industries, providing em-
ployment and generally restoring the
country to the former level. The
Opposition, led by Mr. Latham, natu-
rally opposed any moves that were
made in the direction of correcting
the internal situation. They were
very ably supported in their oppo-
sition by the Nationalists in the Sen-
ate, but in spite of this the obligation
remained with the Government to see
that its policy in its entirety was
given effect to. The people knew
where the Nationalist Country Party
Stood on these questions. Their op-
position was expected, but they had
returned to power a party to deal
with this opposition, and therefore the
direct responsibility rested with the
Government.
WHIPPING UP SCULLIN.
Spurred on toy Labor’s organisa-
tions, both political and industrial,
the Government made half-hearted
attempts to meet the situation. Series
of conferences were held with Sir
Kotoert Gibson and the Common-
wealth Bank Board, but without re-
sult. Of course, it cannot be denied
that behind the scenes the Nation-
alist Party was secretly working to
prevent anything being done. The
Commonwealth Bank Board compris-
ed men that had been particularly
chosen by them at the time when
the Eank Act was amended as pre-
viously referred to, and it is also
known that a direct contact and
consultation existed between the
Bank Board and the private hank-
ing institutions. The Government
was aware of these facts. If Labor
did not have a policy to meet this
situation some excuse might be of-
fered for their vacillating attitude
■with these authorities, and therefore
when the first sign of weakness dis-
played by the Prime Minister in fail-
ing to deal with these people as a
Government would be expected to do
■was the sign for both the Nationalist
Party and banking- institutions ro
stiifeji their lips and refuse to assist
unless the conditions laid down were
observed. In short, the Opposition,
even at that stage, was of a character
that, while the Nationalist Parties’
members in the Parliament were
small, their influence outside in the
quarters where the Government was
negotiating was sufficiently strong to
override the Government and its
policy, and, in effect, establish their
own without aid of the Parliament at
all.
We next And. the leaders of the Go-
vernment negotiating with the Bank
of England for the purposes of fin-
ancial assistance from that quarter,
and before these people would even
give consideration to the request, they
laid it down that first of all a re-
presentative of that institution should
visit Australia for the purpose of
examining the Government's policy,
and in fact laying- down the Bank of
England’s terms.
BANK OF ENGLAND TAKES
CHARGE.!
ft is known that in the course
of the negotiations that took
place between the representatives
of the Government and the Bank
of England that the details of
the Government’s policy were dis-
cussed. and the overseas people
were much concerned about our
tariff policih because it affec-
ted industries in which they had
invested large capital in all parts
of the world outside Australia. If,
because of temporary embarrass-
ment, financially, they could drive a
bargain in- regard to this policy, it
was clear that they were anxious to
seize the opportunity. So much for
our much spoken democracy, or, in
other words, a Parliament governed
by the will of the people. These ne-
gotiations in regard to a representa-
tive extended for several weeks, and
at that time the Government were
contemplating the establishment of
a Central Reserve Bank Bill, and
this matter figured largely, as well
as in deciding the investigations of
this representative. To show how
far the influence of banking, or the
private banks had upon the Govern-
ment, it is interesting to know that
before a statement could be made in
the Commonwealth Parliament as to
what this representative was to do in
Australia, the matter had to be sub-
mitted to tiie Bank of England
authorities and undergo a correction.
Even at that stage in the history of
the Government, the people of Aus-
tralia will now be able to see the
dose alliance between Directors
of the Bank of England. Common-
wealth Bank Board, and other private
Banks, and further, that the Prime
Minister was only the nominal head
of tiie nation, and had to submit his
utterances for their approval before
they could be made public. Finally,
arrangements were made for the
representative of the Bank of Eng-
land to visit Australia in the person
of Sir Otto Niemeyer. and. no doubt,
ibis decision was applauded in the
inner circles of the Nationalist Party,
because it provided yet a further
opportunity for them to force their
policy, even though not in power,
into effect.
LABOR’S BETRAYAL
Having before us the decisions of
the Government of recent months we
are now able to arrive at the definite
conclusion that the first step to-
wards the betrayal of Labor's policy


in the financial sphere was estab-
lished at the time that this gentle-
man was invited to Australia. He
laid the foundation stone of the
present policy of the Government,
and it is now clear that it was only
a matter of time after his visit when
it would be given effect to. It is
unnecessary to refer to the state-
ments he made while in Australia,
they were very fully canvassed on
the occasion of the last New South
Wales State Elections, but it is just
as well to remind you that one
phrase lie used was that if you did
not accept his dictates, well, then,
“Australia could stew in its own
juice."
The people of New South Wales
recorded their decision very em-
phatically against his intrusion into
the affail® of this country, and as
they did it here we are to-day hop-
ing that they will do the same right
throughout Australia on December
19.
GIBSON’S APPOINTMENT.
After his departure, the Common-
wealth Bank Board, directed by Sir
Robert Gibson and the Nationalist
Party, carried on their campaign,
and in spite of the fact that all the
factors surrounding the hostility of
Sir Robert Gibson to any policy in
keeping with Labor’s platform, the
Prime Minister again re-appointed
that gentleman to a further term of
seven years as Chairman of the
Commonwealth Bank Board. The re-
appointment of Sir Robert Gibson to
the Bank Board is an action that the
Labor Movement will never forgive
the Prime Minister for. The rank
and file of the Party were aware of
tile expiry of his term of office, and
in the Caucus Room the Prime Min-
ister gave an undertaking to his
Party that no appointment would be
made to this important position be-
fore the Party was consulted on the
matter. The demand of the Parti
for this assurance was not unusual
in the light of the information at
their disposal. They were aware,
Just as the Prime Minister, of the
part he was playing in defeating
Labor’s policy, and as he held the
kev position in Australia, and was
closely in touch with the Bank of
England overseas, it naturally followed
that the future in regard to what
policy would be followed, centred
around the mart who held this posi-
tion. In spite of the undertaking
given by the Prime Minister to his
Party, the matter of the appoint-
ment of Vtr Chairman of the Com-
monwealth ißank Board was decided
by Caucus at a time when the Par-
liament was actually in session, and
as a consequence, the members were
available for him to confer with it
he intended to honor his word.
NIEM: YERISM.
Following all these events the Go-
vernment continued its negotiations
with the Bank Board, and to those
who know the position, the attitude
of Sir Robert Gibson stiffened con-
siderably against the Government's
policy after the visit of Sir Otto
Niemeyer and his re-appointment of
the Bank Board; by a gradual pro-
cess lie was winning out, and prior
to the Prime Minister's departure for
overseas he was brought to the Prime
Minister's home for the purpose of
convincing some members of the
Government the necessity of follow-
ing his direction. But instead of
impressing the people, as no doubt
the Prime Minister wished him to
do, the case was turned against him
in the sense that lie was asked how
it was that for the last three or
four years the reports of the Com-
monwealth Bank Board did not in-
dicate any threatening financial
crisis. It was said to Sir Robert
Gibson on that oicasion that as he
held the centre position in regard
to financial affairs in ihis country
tor a number of years, how is it that
he did not make the same demands
upon the previous Nationalist Go-
vernments as he was ilien proposing
to do on the present Government.
He was further informed that if a
crisis did take place his adminis-
tration was to blame, and the people
of Australia wouil be tcld upon
whose shoulders tlie i espor sibility
lay. The Prime Minister, having
left for Great Britain, along with
other Ministers, the present leader
of the U.A.P., Mr. Lyons, became
Acting Treasurer, and as events since
have proved he believed Sir Robert
Gibson’s policy, the struggle to give
effect to it continued.
LANG’S VICTORY CHECKS
NIEMEYERISM.
Tn their determination to force
their policy at one stage, a threat was
made to hold up Government fi-
nance. it being thought that by this
process that those who were then
members of the Go'arn-nent who
had refused to agree woi-hi be forced
to do so. Just abo.'t the time this
threat was made the New South
Wales State Elections were taking
place, and at all ceils ihc Nation-
alist Party, of whom Me “Lyons, al-
though Acting Treasurer in the
place of the Prime Minister, was
really a member, the last definite
attempt was made by endeavoring
to put the policy through, so that it
would be in line with Mr. Bavin’s,
and thus defeat the New South
Wales Labor Party at the poll.
The attempt failed, and Labor in
New South Wales was successful.
Thus, for the time being, changing
tlie face of things because their policy
was the issue upon which the elec-
tions had been fought.
This fact was definitely established


in May of this year, when in Mel-
bourne, at a Premiers’ Conference,
the present Government accepted in
detail the policy of the Nationalist
party. It was a policy that had been
aimed for by Sir Robert Gibson and
his friends from tho very beginning
of the life of the Government; in fact,
it was based upon a resolution car-
ried by the Bank Board at a meeting
held in Sydney at the time of the pre-
vious Premiers’ Conference, at which
Mr. Lang launched his proposals. This
resolution had been bitterly attacked
by the Government; in fact, they ex-
pressed themselves in such terms that
under no circumstances would they
accept the conditions it laid down,
because it was a direct violation of
Labor’s principles. Now, of course,
they seek to justify it.
SCULLIN CAPITULATES.
The question to be asked is
why the sudden change and the
surrender to Labor’s lifelong ene-
mies? The decision at this con-
ference is known as the Pre-
miers’ Plan, and those who have been
directly affected by it need no intro-
duction as to its operations, but the
worst feature of all is the fact that
the old-aged and infirm are the ones
most seriously affected. The old-aged
have given their best years to the
nation; the infirm are numbered
amongst the many who pay the price
for the part they played in building
up industries in this country. They
looked at least to a Labor Govern-
ment to defend them, but, like many
others, they have also been sadly dis-
appointed. This plan, therefore, is
cut wages, cut pensions, cut mater-
nity grants and increase taxes. We
have been informed that this plan
will give wonderful impetus to in-
dustry; it will employ thousands. Mr.
Scullin says a new hope Is borne in
the hearts of the people. It opens
up a brighter prospect; it will pro-
vide a market for our primary pro-
ducts. In short, it will give work for
thousands. Finally, he says it will
ha a lasting benefit. Mr. Theodore
says it will restore confidence, in-
crease employment, increase purchas-
ing power. I fancv I can hear the
pensioners applauding such a state-
ment that by reducing their pensions
you are giving them more to spend.
THEODORE BOOSTS PREMIERS’
PLAN.
Mr. Theodore also said it will he
a direct benefit to every kind of in-
dustry. Factories now idle will be-
come busy. All this seems to be a
wonderful change, and according to
the Government and the Opposition it
can be obtained by a 22| per cent,
cut in pensions, wages, etc. There-
fore, how much could you get for a
50 ner cent, cut if this policy is cor-
rect? In the language of our poli-
tical enemies that was not a matter
of argument but one of arithmetic.
It is a plan in which the more you
are reduced and taxed the more work
and purchasing power you get. Thi3
is not a common sacrifice at all; it is
money from home; and if this plan
will cure the depression and save the
workers, why do its supporters apo-
logise for it? The truth of the mat-
ter is. and by this timd it is already
well known, it will not do the things
its supporters claim. But what we
know it has done is to rob those af-
fected by it of what they are justly
entitled to. All this to provide a
bankers’ holiday at the expense of
soldiers' old-ase and invalid pension-
ers, and others.
LABOR POLICY.
Misery and discontent are abroad
in Australia to-day because the
farmers are unable to obtain the cost
of production for their commodities,
and the workers are unable to obtain
employment.
Prosperity for the farmers and
the workers is the foundation upon
which the whole of our society rests,
and until that foundation is mad*
safe and secure nothing can be done
to rehabilitate the superstructure of
trade and commerce.
. Our difficulty is not that the pro*
ducers are growing or the manufac-
turers are making more than the
public can consume—the trouble is
that the means by which commodities
are transferred from the producer to
the consumer, that is, the financial
system, is wholly inadequate to exist-
ing conditions.
For any party to present to the
electors a policy for the rehabilita-
tion of our affairs and omit from it
proposals for a radical reorganisation
of our banking system is sheer
hypocrisy.
NATIONALISATION OF BANKING.
The first proposal that I will deal
with, then, is the corrective which
the Labor Party proposes to apply
to our financial system.
As all Governments are under the
dictatorship of capitalist, finance, it
logically follows that no policy, what-
ever its nature, can be operated
without its consent.
Therefore, the first essential for
the restoration of responsible gov-
ernment and the implementing of a
policy for economic reconstruction
from the standpoint of human well-
being .must be preceded by complete
national control of finance.
The Labor Movement holds that
the credit system of the community
is too vital to our well-being to be
allowed to continue in the hands of
private enterprise.
The banking system should belong
to the people as a whole, not to any
section of it.


That was the vision of the men
who created the Commonwealth
Bank.
Nationalisation was not directly
legislated for then because it was
thought that a national bank would
naturally crush out all competition
from the private banks.
The creators of this institution
placed it in charge of the late Sir
Denison Miller, a man with the mind
of a great banker and the sou) of a
great Australian,
BANKING FOR THE PEOPLE.
While the Commonwealth Bank
was under his control there was
every reason to hope that Labor’s
objective in this regard would be
realised.
At his death, however, the institu-
tion passed into other hands, and
was transformed from a people’s
bank into a bankers’ hank.
Framed to be used as the most
willing and useful servant of the
people, the Commonwealth Bank has
been moulded into a terrible weapon
of oppression and destruction.
If the party which I have the honor
to lead is given a majority at the
elections, the mistakes of the past
will not be repeated, because we will
introduce legislation nationalising
banking, having only one honk oper-
ating in Australia, the Common-
wealth Bank, with a branch in every
town and hamlet in this great con-
tinent.
It will be a bank such as that
which, operated under Sir Denison
Miller, was created to serve the
people and work in harmony with
the elected Government of the day.
HOW MILLER SAVED AUSTRALIA.
When, in the first months of the
world war the private banking in-
stitutions found the position beyond
them, a depression similar to that
now existing seemed about to settle
upon the primary industries.
The Commonwealth Bank, ignoring
the fears and incompetence of pri-
vate enterprise, undertook the stupen-
dous task of fliiancing our wool and
wheat crops, financing the army
abroad, and the cost of the war.
On that occasion the Common-
wealth Bank fqund hundreds of mil-
lions of pounds for a purpose not
constructive, but destructive.
If the bank could do what it did
tinder those circumstances, why
could it not do it to-day, when every
pound of credit that it would be
asked to issue would be backed by
the real wealth of primary and secon-
dary products and great public
works ?
That is the real wealth of the
community; the pound note is only a
token.
GOODS NOT NOTES IS WEALTH.
The Labor Party puts it to the peoi
pie that the only financial system
which will serve Australia is a
national Commonwealth Bank, whose
policy will be to see that the real
wealth of the people as measured in
goods is covered with sufficient cur-
rent credit to allow trade, com-
merce and employment to continue.
It has been suggested that our
financial ills could’ be cured by the
establishment of a National Reserve
Bank.
We have that already. The pre-
sent control of the Commonwealth
Bank, acting in concert with the
trading banks, has turned our
national banking institution into
nothing more or less than a Federal
Reserve Bank for the trading banks.
The result of this has been a greater
curtailment of credit than Australia
has ever known.
The Reserve Bank Plan does not
give the people control of finances,
but merely places a more delicate
weapon in the hands of those who
manipulate a monetary system.
This, then, is Labor’s proposal for
the solution of the financial difficul-
ties —the creation of a Common-
wealth Bank, giving it the sole right
to the banking business, using as a
guiding principle in its credit sys-
tem the quantity of wealth in goods
which the community wishes to ex-
change, not the amount of gold
hoarded in the bank’s vaults.
WHEN INFLATION IS NOT
INFLATION
Every time that a suggestion is
made to improve the banking sys-
tem, our opponents cry out —‘'Infla-
tion” —a word that has become as
blessed as Mesopotamia and just as
meaningless.
At the present moment there is
held by the different Australian
Wanks approximately 55 millions of
Treasury Bills, representing money
loaned to the different Australian Go-
vernments.
For the loan of that money every
Government is paying the ruling rate
of interest, now 4 per cent.
The Commobwealth Bank has ar-
ranged with the private banks, how-
ever, that they can at any time draw
from the Commonwealth Bank, notes
to the value of the Treasury Bills
they hold.
This means that the private banks
are able to place their Government
Bonds with the Commonwealth Bank
and draw on them as if those bonds
represented credit in a current ac-
count.
This is the point that I wart you
to grasp regarding this word infla-
tion.
If the Labor Government suggested
that all Government bonds should
be negotiable with the Common-
wealth Bank for a current account,
there would be an uproar from the


anti-Labor Press that inflation was
being practised and ruin would re-
sult.
Why is it that when the Common-
wealth Bank gives credit to the pub-
lic equal to the amount of Govern-
ment Bonds it holds it is inflation,
hut when it does the same thing tG
the private banks, it becomes pru-
dent finance.
NATIONAL DEBTS.
There is no difference between the
Government Bor.d held by a private
bank and the Government Bond held
by a private individual.
If all the bonds for the internal
debt were negotiable at the . Com-
monwealth Bank for a credit ac-
count, this would be a method of
dealing with it to the advantage of
the people and the Government, and
the interest and sinking fund which
is now used to service that debt
could be paid into the bank for the
purpose of redeeming the principal.
This method is only a slight varia-
tion of that adopted by the Com-
monwealth Bank during the war
years, when it- advanced money or
rather advanced credit to the peop.e
to buy war bonds with.
OVERSEA DEBT.
A mill-stone round the neck of
Australia is the large amount of in-
terest which has to be paid away
each year overseas.
The Labor Party’s proposals in this
regard are that a Labor Govern-
ment should promptly take up with
our overseas creditors the question
of funding this debt along the lines
cf the settlement which Britain made
with America regarding her own
debt, and that the procedure to be
followed should in every case agree
with that which Britain herself
adopted.
UNEMPLOYMENT.
With such a financial system em-
ployment would readily be found
for a large number of our citizens
who are now. without work.
The existing financial control has
laid down the dictum that in allocat-
ing funds for public works, profits
must be the guiding principle, not
the absorption of labor.
They have arrogantly dictated that
money comes before humanity.
When the bankers declared that
they would ignore Governments in
dealing with the question of unem-
ployment, and negotiate directly with
public bodies which could show that
they had profitable enterprises to en-
gage in, they not only received the
support of the Scullin Ministry, but
that Government appeared eager and
anxious that the people should know
that such policy was in some way
the direct result of the Government's
action.
HUMANITY BEFORE PROFITS.
That is a policy of profits before
humanity, which no People's Gov-
ernment can stand for.
The demand has often been made
by the unemployed that the basic
wage should be paid to those to
whom work cannot be found.
That is a wrong- statement of the
case.
There is more work to be done
in Australia—urgent work, repro-
ductive and necessary work—than
the present population is capable of
performing, but there is no money
to pay for it.
Under Labor’s policy of national
control of finance, much of this work
can be put in hand, because there
will then he money available.
To talk of raising money by way
of loan either in Australia or over-
seas is to talk of something that
is wrong as well as impossible.
It follows then that {f the existing
system of finance is to continue, and
loan money cannot be raised, the out-
look for the huge army of unem-
ployed is hopeless for some time
to come.
Any party which endeavors to dan-
gle before the electors a list of pub-
lic works for the absorption of labor
and which does not propose to im-
prove the national monetary ar-
rangements is deliberately deceiving
the people.
UNEMPLOYED’S ONLY HOPE.
There is only one hope for the un-
employed in this continent, and that
is a return of a real Labor Govern-
ment. pledged to the policy of the
nationalisation of banking.
When the money is available more
than enough work can be found—■
without the money it is futile to out-
line a policy of construction.
Humanity must come before pro-
fits, and the proprietors of the pri-
vate trading banks are to be com-
pelled to give up their profits in
order that the people of this great
continent of ours may be restored
to a condition which humanity de-
mands for them.
Any system to regulate employ-
ment in industry must take into con-
sideration the revolution machinery
has caused in relation to the employ-
ment of workers in industry.
EFFECT OF MACHINERY.
The remarkable efficiency of pro-
ductive machinery has not only had
a tremendous effect upon employ-
ment, but also it is the important
factor In any monetary policy.
Mr. Reginald McKenna, chairman
of the Midland Bank of London, a
banker >vho has contributed a good
deal to the discussion of monetary
policy that have taken place dur-
ing the past two years, says this:
“At present the efficiency of pro-
ductive machinery has far out-


stripped our monetary technique, and
it is the task of economists and finan-
cial authorities to adapt the monetary
system to our existing industrial and
social needs.”
That is a fundamental truth stated
by the highest banking authority.
The machine has not only out-
grown the monetary system, but also
the industrial conditions governing
employment.
The effects of machinery upon em-
ployment can be gathered from the
following illustrations:
Less than three years ago a
moulder and two asistants could pro-
duce 1J baths per day—to-day, those
three men can produce by machinery
40 baths per day.
One man couid produce 11 tyres
per day—to-day, by machine produc-
tion, the same man can produce 90
tyres per day.
Work which two years ago re-
quired the labor of 200 men can now
be performed by a steam navvy with
a crew of three men.
Under existing conditions this dis-
placed labor has been thrown upon
the unemployment market, but our
industrial laws should be so framed
that machinery should serve human-
ity, not profits.
SHORTER WORKING WEEK.
It is the belief of the Labor Party
that any Government dealing with
industrial conditions must shorten
the working week so that labor en-
gaged in any industry may continue
to be absorbed by it.
In that way machines can be made
to serve humanity which, after all,
is the only justification for their em-
ployment.
The absorption of labor in indus-
try must be approached intelligently
from two angles, the regulation of
industry, and the adaptation of the
monetary system to meet the position
which Mr. Reginald McKenna shows
has arisen.
PRIMARY INDUSTRIES.
The other phase of our economic
life which is wrapt up in the financial
question is the marking of our pri-
mary products.
We are producing more wheat, more
wool, and more meat than ever be-
fore, but for none of it is the grower
receiving the cost of production.
There is one way only in which
our primary industries can be , re-
trieved from their present parlous
condition, and that is by a system
of co-operative marketing, producer
control, with the necessary govern-
mental and consumer safeguard.
At different times spasmodic at-
tempts have been made at hulk mar-
keting.
These pools, when they have oper-
ated have greatly improved the posi-
tion of the producers, hut privats
banking has always been powerful
enough to prevent any real and last-
ing success being achieved.
JAWRA CONTROL.
Bawra control of our wool crop
was perhaps the greatest success in
pool marketing that Australia has
seen, largely because of the wonder-
ful assistance that the Common-
wealth Bank, under Sir Denison Mil-
ler. was able to give, and because
of the competent and expert direc-
tion of the gentleman who was in
control of the Bawra operations.
But, with the Commonwealth Bank
crippled as it is to-day, another
Bawra would not be as successful
as its predecessor was.
The Labor Party believes that by
welding al l the growers into a sys-
tem of co-operative marketing, guid-
ed by the expert direction which was
available to it in the war years, and
served by a nationalised banking sys-
tem, our primary industries could
again be placed in a profitable posi-
tion.
IMPORTANCE OF FINANCE.
A marketing pool, to he effective,
must have such financial assistance
that it can sell or hold, as the pro-
ducers’ interests dictate.
Only a national bank such as the
Labor Party will introduce can give
that assistance.
What applies to wool equally ap-
plies to meat.
The State Government of New
South Wales is about to embark
upon such a system of meat market-
ing for its primary producers.
Take what is happening at the
Flemington saleyards, where the
competition is nothing more than a
sham and a delusion.
Even the present big buyers are
at the mercy of one big foreign
buyer.
MANIPULATING MEAT MARKET.
The recent collapse of meat prices
at Smithfield illustrates how the
Australian grower is being swindled.
We were told this price-slaughter
was due to big supplies from Argen-
tine and the Uruquay.
The daily newspapers were the
vehicles of this trade falsehood.
There had been a falling-off of
supplies from these countries.
What happened was that the ex-
port of lambs and mutton from Aus-
tralia had been speeded-up and
hoarded in cold storage in London.
Then, suddenly, they w T ere released
on the Smithfield market and the
glut forced prices down.
The foreign operator who had re-
leased the lamb and mutton bought it
in at reduced prices, and returned it
to cool storage, whence it will be re-
leased when prices go up.
The prices in Australia will be
smashed down.
The producers will suffer.
The foreign operator will make a.
double profit on his two sales.
This is no new thing.


In February, two years ago, Lord
Beaverbrook called attention to the
fa-* that the meat supply of Great
Britain was controlled by foreign
companies.
COMMERCIAL TERRORISM.
This commercial terrorism, this
ruthless robbery of the primary pro-
ducer, was responsible for the State
Government turning its attention to
the subect of co-operative market-
ing control of their own lamb and
mutton by the producers.
This should show them, if they
were able to meet the trickery of
Smithfield efficiently, .twopence per
lb. more for their meat products.
Effective as such a scheme would
be within the borders of the State
of New South Wales, it would be
much more effective if the whole of
Australia were embraced in the
scheme.
The plight of the wheat grower is
the same as that of the other pro-
ducts I have mentioned.
This, then, is Labor's policy for the
primary producer.
An organised system of orderly
marketing controlled by the producers
themselves, directed by the most
skilful brains available and financed
by a natoinal bank, the only form of
hanking that can effectively finance
the farmers in the farmers’ own
interests.
AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES.
One of the outstanding events
which will require the attention of
the Federal Government this year is
tho Imperial Conference to be held
in July.
This conference is of tremendous
importance to Australia, because
proposals which will be made to her
there will be that in exchange for a
few benefits to our primary indus-
tries we should agree to abandon our
secondary industries.
We cannot afford to allow that
representation to be in the hands of
men who, while they have one eye on
Australia, keep the other on the
leading article of the London
“Times.”
We do not want spokesmen like
those who, on a previous occasion,
were so eager to show that they
were more British than Britain her-
self, that they agreed to pay 2 per
cent, per annum more on our war
debt than was necessary.
Australia’s point of viettf would
not be rightly put by representatives
of the big importing industries such
as the gentleman who is now in
London preparing the ground for the
betrayal of Australia’s secondary in-
dustries.
SOMEONE TO FIGHT FOR
AUSTRALIA.
At this conference we must have
men who will fight for the rights of
Australia’s primary and secondary
industries, leaving the representa-
tives of Britain and the other
Dominions to put forward the case
of the countries they represent.
Britain has had hundreds of years’
experience at negotiating treaties,
Australia has had practically none,
and we will want at that conference
Australians who will «tand up for
Australia and fight for her tooth
and nail. ,
The Labor Party believes in a
self-contained Australia.
We believe in the maintenance of
Australian secondary industries, pro-
tected by a tariff sufficiently high to
protect our industries from unfair
competition.
Believing as we do in <i high
standard of living for our people,
we will see that every industry which
maintains Australian .standards Is
fully and adequately protected by a
tariff.
Trade within the Empire is an ob-
jective worth striving for.
Trade within the Empire can never
be achieved by asking the Dominions
to sacrifice the rights of one section
of Its people to obtain doubtful
benefits for another section.
ARBITRATION.
Because the existing system of
Federal Arbitration has not been the
success it was hoped it would be. the
anti-Labor parties profess to see in
that non-success the failure of the
arbitration principle.
Th*. Federal Arbitration Courts
have never had an opportunity fully
to justify themselves.
They have had the widest powers,
apparently, to reduce wages and low-
er industrial conditions generally, but
they have lacked full authority to
give the workers in industry the
benefits to Which they are entitled.
The Labor Party believes that all
industrial powers should be vested in
the Central Government. _
It should be the sole and complete
authority for fixing hours of labor,
wages and conditions of the workers.
To do this, men of ability and in-
tegrity must be appointed to the
Bench and given wider powers than
any arbitration adjudicator in Aus-
tralia possesses to-day.
WATERED CAPITAL.
Since the employers invariably sup-
port their application for lower
wages by pleading that the industry
is unable to pay more, the Arbitra-
tion Courts should have the power to
inquire fully into this aspect.
It should have the power to in-
vestigate the capitalisation of com-
panies and delete from the calcula-
tions of the Court all watered stock,
taking as a basis only the paid-up
capital invested.
It invariably follows that when the
Court does award some advantage to
the employees, much of the benefit


is lost because the selling prices ot
the products are immediately in-
creased.
WIDE POWERS
The Court should he given powers
wide enough to prevent this, even to
including the fixation of prices and
the control of profits.
Every effort will be made to con-
stitute tribunals similar to those
operating in the State of New South
Wales, and so avoid the costly and
unsatisfactory legal formula follow-
ed in the Federal courts.
We believe that it Is only by such
a system, working universally
throughout Australia, that we can
achieve and maintain for our people
a standard of Jiving fit for Austi’a-
lians to enjoy.
Some of the proposals which I
have outlined so far are beyond the
powers of the existing Constitution.
Should we get a mandate from the
people, however, we will immediate-
ly seek full constitutional powers by
means of the referendum.
ROBBING THE PENSIONER.
A Labor Government will re-
store to [he aged and the sick
the pension which has been recently
taken from them.
Of all the dastardly, contemptible
things that any Government has ever
done, none has been meaner than the
robbing of the aged and infirm of
the miserable pittance which was
paid to them in the form of a
pension.
They were the most defenceless
section of our people, and, like all
defenceless people, they were the
most hardly hit.
Another section of our community
—the returned soldiers—were among
the weak who went to the wall
when the bankers made their on-
slaught.
These men paid whatever debt they
owed the nation when they risked
their lives in the war.
They must pay again by returning
to the maw of the bankei's a portion
of that miserable pittance which Par-
liament had awarded to them.
If returned to power, the Labor
Government will restore the pen-
sions which have been taken from
the soldiers.
FAMILY ENDOWMENT.
One of the greatest boons to the
mothers in New South Wales is
family endowment.
Restricted, as in the circumstances
it must he, this regular payment to
the mothers of our Australian child-
ren is one of the finest things that
has been done.
Given a majority in the new Par-
liament, a Labor Government will
institute a system of family endow-
ment for the whole of Australia,
A scheme of national insurance
providing for unemployment and
sickness will also be introduced.
The workers of the State of New
South Wales have the protection o"f
a Workers’ Compensation Act that is
not enjoyed in other States.
It will be our duty to bring in a
Commonwealth measure providing
for a system of compensation at
least as liberal as that operating
there.
FEDERAL MORATORIUM.
The incoming Federal Government,
if it is to he of service to the people
and not to the money-lender, must
immediately take steps to introduce
a moratorium.
As the conditions in Australia im-
prove and a better market for land
and property operates, there will be
a tendency everywhere on the
part of the money-lender to fore-
close on his security, driving the
worker from his home and the far-
mer from his land.
Highly beneficial legislation along
these lines has already been Intro-
duced by the Government of New
South Wales.
Unfortunately, the money-lender is
able to defeat this law in certain as-
pects by availing himself of the Fed-
eral Bankruptcy Act.
PEOPLE BEFORE MONEYLENDER
Should Labor be entrusted with of-
fice in the next Parliament, one of
cur earliest measures will be to in-
troduce legislation that will prevent
the money-lender taking from the
worker and tlie farnmv the fruits of
a lifetime of toil, and take special
steps to adust the burden of debt
so that those who have struggled
in the times of adversity to keep
their homes and hold their farms
will not be robbed of their all when
better times approach.
DEFENCE.
We shall pursue a prudent policy
for the defence of Australia, refusing
at all times to participate in any war
ether than one of invasion of Aus-
tralia.
Such a policy will require the util-
isation and extension of the Small
Arms Factory %t Lit.ligow and pos-
sibly the establishment of such fac-
tories in other centres for the manu-
facture of aeroplanes and all neces-
sary equipment for home defence
purposes.
Our policy will include the rehabi-
litation of the Cockatoo Island Dock-
yard for the building of whatever
ships are necessary for home de-
fence.
WIRELESS.
No industry in Australia has been
so restricted and hampered in its de-
velopment as the radio industry.
Control of broadcasting by the
Postmaster- General’s Department has


caused the greatest dissatisfaction to
the radio industry, the broadcasting-
stations and the great listening-in
public.
We will take radio out of the con-
trol of the officials of the Postal De-
partment and place it in the hands
of a separate board on which all
sections of the community who
vitally interested will be represented.
The following are the main planks
in Labor’s radio policy:
BROADCASTING.
1. Reduction of the listeners’
licenses from 24/ to 10/ per an-
num.
2. Nationalisation of all A class
stations under the control of
the respective State Govern-
ments.
3. Freedom of the E class stations
from the present harsh restric-
tions, including:
(a) Abolition of the restrictions on
the right of free speech over
the air.
(b) Extensions of the license
period for B class stations to
three years.
(c) Re-allocation of wave-lengths
to provide for more favorable
portions of the wave-band be-
ing made available to B class
stations
4. Investigation of the whole copy-
right position in relation to
broadcasting.
OVERSEAS WIRELESS.
Nationalisation of the Beam
Service to provide for substan-
tial reTucions in telegraphic
charges.
COMMUNICATIONS.
1. Facilities for the use of wire-
less for isolated country areas.
2. Facilities for +be use of wireless
telegraphy in the service of the
country Press.
The wireless broadcasting stations
are just as much organs for the ex-
pression of public opinion as is the
Press.
We consider the Federal Labor
Government committed a social crime
against free speech and violated the
sacred traditions on which the Labor
Movement in every country is found-
ed, when it took away from the broad-
casting stations the sacred rights of
free speech which they had hither-
to enjoyed.
The restoration of that right will
be one of the first tasks of the New
South Wales Labor Party.
OIL FROM COAL.
We will make immediate provision
for a close investigation into methods
of extracting oil from coal in order
that some practical means will be
provided to put to use the great re-
sources of the Northern Coalfields.
The issues in this election are now.
before the people. It is for you to
decide. The choice lies between what
is called the U.A.P. Partv, the Scul-
lin-Theodore combination, or the
Labor Party whose policy I have out-
lined to-night.
NATIONALISM’S ALIAS.
The U.A.P. Party is an old form
of reaction in another name. “When
they become discredited they usually
change the name. The history of this
political party is well known in Aus-
tralia. They have held office for a
long period of years in the Common-
wealth Parliament, and are mainly re-
sponsible for the chaos that exists
to-day.
Regarding the Scullin-Theodore
combination —they were elected two
years ago to correct the situation,
and the Labor Party’s platform pro-
vided the remedy. They backed and
filled, they talked, they called confer-
ences, and they did everything but
follow Labor’s policy. Consequently
they now face the people having mis-
erably failed to do what the Labor
Movement expected of them. They
have had their opportunity and failed,
and therefore are no longer deserv-
ing of the support of the people. We
have fought against them in the Par-
liament. Our numbers were not suf-
ficient to direct the nation’s affairs
along Labor lines because of the
amalgamation with the Government
of the Nationalists and Country
Party.
STAND UP FOR AUSTRALIA.
cumstances are removed from any
power and influence in this land.
The opportunity is now in your
hands to give us sufficient numbers.
We have declared that we will fight
the interests that are throttling this
country to-day, and in conclusion we
ask that if the people of Australia
believe in this country and wish to
see it progress, the time has arrived
for them to declare that they shall
stand up and fight until those that
are responsible for the present cir-
