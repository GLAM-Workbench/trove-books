“ BUNDLED OUT.”
The term “ bundled out ” has recently occupied a prominent
place in most of the speeches made by Dr. Mannix. Of course,
he applies it in hie narrow sectarian way to everyone who opposes
the impudent interference of the R.C. Church in political matters
throughout Australia. When the term is used in connection with
Rome’s thousand years’ protest against the temporal power of
the Popes, chased out, fired out, shot out would serve. But “Bundled
out” effectively explains the situation.
Formosa I. (A.D. 896) incurred (says Muratori) the hatred of
the Romans.

put to death.

retain the Temporal Power, sold it.
Victor IT, (1057) put down the insurrection of Ancona by such


merciless means that St. Damiano protested, and wrote: “If the
Church must have life by the faith, why do the Pontifical swords
so fiercely persevere in holding for the Church a power which
is earthly and transitory?”

from Rome, he bought the help of the Turk's, and died on his
way back to Rome, surrounded by his mercenaries.

He submitted, and returned, but was again exiled. The Germans
came on his invitation and sacked the city, but soon after another
revolt occurred, which he was unable to repress, and he was again
bundled out.

The decision of the Trustees of the Exhibition, Melbourne, not to
let the building on Nov. 5, 1917, to the Irish Roman Catholic Party

OUT.
