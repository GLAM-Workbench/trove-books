TABLES OF PEACE ORGANIZATION
AND
ESTABLISHMENTS,
1914-15.
INSTRUCTIONS.
(1) The following tables show the organization of units from Ist July,
1914.
(2) Generally those liable for training will be allotted to a unit formed
in the battalion area in which they reside. This restriction will not apply
to members voluntarily enlisted, nor in the case of those allotted to technical
arms, but where units have been raised in their residential areas it is
desirable that such members should be localized as far as possible.
(3) Commanding officers of all units will inform the brigade-majors
of the areas from which their commands are maintained, on Ist May, of
the number of recruits required on Ist July to complete their establish-
ments, specifying the proportion of men of special trades or occupations, and
the number of men required who are able to ride.
(4) The allotment to arms and corps will be carried out by District
Commandants in accordance with U.T. Regulations, Part V.,. paragraphs
107 and 108, and instructions thereon. Before the allotment is completed
commanding officers of units of artillery, engineers, army service corps, and
army medical corps will be afforded an opportunity of inspecting senior
cadets desirous for service with their units, with a view to the selection of
those possessing special technical knowledge for the requirements of such
arms. Brigade-majors will furnish lists containing the names and addresses
of recruits allotted to the various units to commanding officers and area
officers not later than the Ist June, supplementary lists being supplied later
in cases where necessary.
(5) Any surplus in the number of recruits after the requirements of all
units in the battalion area have been met will be trained as supernumera-
ries with the infantry, and will be available to meet any extraordinary
wastage in small units. Small units (Field Artillery, Garrison Artillery,
Engineers, Army Service Corps, and Army Medical Corps) will be main-
tained at the authorized establishments prescribed by these tables, provided
that transfers from the infantry, other than those occurring by removal
A 2


of residence, or under C.M. Regulation 179, will not be permitted after
31st December. Commanding officers of small units will inform the
brigade-majors concerned, on the first day of each month from August
to December, of the number of vacancies in their units, and brigade-
majors will take steps to have the necessary transfers from the infantry
effected. Any deficiencies in the number of recruits available will occur
in the infantry, which being the largest units will not be affected by the
loss of a few to the same extent as small units.
(6) Recruits (1896 quota) allotted to technical units, who are found
unsuitable to the extent that they are unable, from a technical point of
view, to adapt themselves to the special duties of such units may be trans-
ferred to the infantry battalion of the area in which they reside, provided
that no such transfer will be effected after 31st December. Transfers under
this instruction are not to be permitted for such reasons as irregular
attendance, slackness at drill, or breaches of discipline.
(7) Light Horse units, being maintained by voluntary enrolment, at
localities at which such units are established or may be established, and
in all metropolitan areas, in the allotment of recruits liable for service,
brigade-majors and area officers will ensure that preference is given on
all occasions to those with suitable horses at their disposal who are willing
to serve with light horse, and commanding officers of other branches are
expected to afford every facility to those who desire to transfer to this arm.
(8) The strength of machine-gun sections, signallers, and stretcher-
bearers of light horse regiments and infantry battalions is to be main-
tained at the authorized establishment.
(9) At localities at which units of Army Medical Corps are established
preference will be given to those who are forbidden by the doctrines of
their religion to bear arms. At other localities such persons will be allotted
to the infantrv and will be trained as stretcher-bearers.
