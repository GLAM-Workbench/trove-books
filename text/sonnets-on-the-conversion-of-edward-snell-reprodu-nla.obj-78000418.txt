H DEDICATION.
I?vE won but little fame, and less desire,
For my pretence is only this : to move
The loving heart that I so fondly love ;
To this alone I bid my muse aspire,
Though scant my inaence, weak my ?tful ?re.
And 0! if my poor Words should vagrant prove,
With but one smile to greet them where they rove,
I'll keep the dowry to adorn my lyre,
And with the souverance so richly dight
F3
[3
Will envy not the poet's brighter fame,
Content to know one soul has lent its light
To give a radiance to my humble name ;
To that one smile what thoughts I here relate
With loving gratitude I dedicate.

THE CONVERSION OF EDWARI) SNELL
Down in the West where 'l?a,mar's royal stream
Runs lovingly beside the signs of war,
And mighty steam-hulls lie in peaceful store,
And many a. clanking chain and creaking beam
Proclaims where Mars and Vulcan rule supreme,
A grassy hill looks down upon the shore,
Sha.dow?d by goodly beach and �ycamore,
In whose soft shades Endymion might dream;
There is a lovely home, and through its lights
The glowing tones of many a. summer's day
Have left their mellow stains and golden plights
Of sunny love, too deep to fade away.
So memory and these combine to tell
How art and nature fa.vour'd Edward Snell.
To Edward Snell belong?d a. force of thought
But few possess, and fewer can maintain;
And sovixe stood a. pillar on a. plain
In contrast strong against dogmatic thought ;
And when to meet his arguments they brought
Their worn out fantasies, he told how gain
And pride had made a. market of the fane
Where Christ was sold and Paradise was bought,
And how his mind refused with scorn to be
As others thought themaelves with pious pride,
A light?house made to ornament the sea.
He in his honesty could not abide
\Vith Shams, and so he sought to stand
On what he deem?d the safer lase, dry land.


...........
Blest with an independence, he was free
To utter as he thought of pulpit things,
And their illogical meanderings ;
To think no holy ordered man to be
Too sacred for his Wit and scrutiny;
And so among his village Wanderings
His satire wore no polite coverings ;
But stung at once the polish?d dignity
As he would sting th� meanest of the ?ock?
It might be too pronounced?he wofe no guise
And stoop?d not for a. smile to mock
Or veil the searching twinkle of his eyes.
?Twa.s thus he mov?d, but with a. feeling heart,
In acts of charity ma.inta,in?d his part.
An ancient borough is a. likely place
To ?nd old gables, crockets, and corbels,
A Norman tower, ani 3. p3a.l of bells,
A time-Worn tailor in the beadle?s place,
And here and there a clock with rusty face,
And many a. lichen?d monument that tells
What stately trees Death's axe for ever fells,
Regardless of their ma.gnitude or grace ;
But in Saltash one growth de?ant; stood,
And Death before it dropped his useless axe :
Wide as a. forest spreads in amplitude,?
?Twa.s never known in growing to relax
And ?neath its shade sat many a. coterie
Of tea.-inspired sca.nda.l~mongery.
Forth from the shade Where covert srzandal lies,
Shrinking to hide her own ill-order?d frame,
Comes shaft and barb of sly and cruel aim ;
But. all in vain the poisoned shower ?ies ; .
For honest hearts, like stars that gild the skies,
Are bob high set fin? dogma to defame :
And hmce is gained a prestaigr t) a name ;


So can the truthful doubter higher rise,
And so did Edward Snell around him throw
His cheerful life Where light was ever found,
While fretful slander, gnawing down below,
Like starving horses, bit at all around;
Yet he had best of Words and gentle speech,
And never tired some useful truths to teach.
Sa.lta.sh reclined. A Corporation doze,
A not uncommon circumstance, lay deep
And years had marked the period of the sleep.
To lecture criminals no Mayor rose,
And the Town-Serjea,nt?s mace lay in repose ;
The Borough Clerk had no records to keep,
And deeper still the slumber seem?d to creep
o?er pecadjlloes, poaching, theft, and blows,
When all at once, like buzzing hornets came
A noise that woke each burgessfrom his dream
Quicker than spreads ince?diary ?ame
It ?ew around from summit to the stream;
The parsons rushed from creed to catechism,
To lay the rising ghost of Spiritualism. .
Foremost amongst detractors, Edwaml Snell
Evolved tr.e ridicule he held so strong,
And like an engine, poul"d his scorx. along,
Careless on whom his ?erce invectives fell,
And the young truth rang loudly as a bell,
And eve3r'ywhere became :1. common song,
And then deep themes of talk for e'vel'y tongue.
Parsonic warnings failed the truth to quell,
But still he louder ra.is?d his seep tic scorn,
Fnmindful of the love which hover?d near,
VVaitiilg his conquered spirit tr) adom
With ornanlentzz of Godly truth and I'e:u*,
VVaiting to hear him shout the hopeful cry,
For God, for Truth, ani I111n1o1't;tlity.


The sun -Went down, and solitude and night
With silent footsteps crept round Culver Park,
And Ta.mar?s moonless waves roll?d sad and dark
Save where a. vessel hung its warning light,
Or distant town-lamp sparkled clear and bright ;
Upon nhe sky the trees stool gaunt and stark,
Silence was undisturbed by wail or bark,
Or the shrill chirup of the curlew?s ?ight.
In the still Autumn hush sat Edward Snell,
And round his board a group of happy boys :
And they were acting parts they knew so well
In science, arb?the younger with their toys??
When pleased with his own thoughts he loudly crie
? We?ll see, my boys! \vha.t ghosts with us abide.?
? Now,? said the freethought; thin}-ger, ? bring a bowl,
That foreign bowl of wood, and stand it here!
Here on this table from all ?ngers clear;
And We will see if there exists a soul
That lives apart from physical control,
Winging unseen in this our a/mlosphere,
Where microscopes are powerless to peer,
Defying air-pump force, through smallest hole,
And place inside that bowl a. leaden weight.?
?Twa� done, and Culver house expectant stood.
? Now," cried Ereethought, ? we've got you straight,
If you're a spirit, lift that bowl of wood,
And if you do, we're yours both tooth and nail,
And no one ?ga.inst that service shall prevail."
Behold a. wonder! Not among the stars;
That sparkle brighter on the darker night,
And ?ery meteors ?ashing short?lived light ;
Nor yet when ocean roars o?er rocky bars,
And raging sea gods drive their stormy cars;
?Tis not where ice-clad mountains ever bright
Reflect the beams of morning light ;


Nor yet in cav�s of ?everlasting spars,
But on the Atheist's table shut away
From High Church ornament, or Baptist pool,
A meeting-house where Independents pray :
Abjuring gravitation, slow and cool,
The bowl ascending ?oated clear and light,
And Edward Snell stood marvelling at the sight.
Then stood they all enchained in wonderment,
When thus the father from the silence broke,
And to his children like a prophet spoke :
?This is an evidence intelligent,
And who can such convincing foxce prevent?
Here?s greater ?truth than parson can provoke,
Or theologic mummery ixivoke.
To earth such book before was never sent.
VVhat may ensue we cannot now forsee
From such a. stepping-stone to future light :
?Tis not the only message meant for me
In telegrams of spiritual ?ight:
Now I believe, ?rm in undoubting mood,
That Jesus Christ upon the water stood.?
The work was done, and without ?ame or show :
No deacon, priest or preacher praised the Lord
F0 ?nished ?ngers struck gregorian chord,
No censor ?ung its vapours to and fro,
N o agony hung on the taper?s glow :
?TWas all achieved upon a household board
Where sacri?cial cup was never pour?d ;
Where never curse had sentenced souls to woe.
Thus came the news with ceremony new,
The dispensation of a common bowl.
Meanness of means stood preachingon the'view,
And mediaaval art had lost its snul.
Next day a menta.l earthquake with its crash,
Alarmed the anci-:-nt b<lmllgll<.f Ealtaslx.


SPIRITUAL SONNETS.
A swmmr low sound as if a Soul was there,
Came murmuring to me a living thought
As through a String by inspiration Wrought,
Had thrown its soft vibrations on the air,
With joyous echoes thrilling everywhere.
The song was new. and yet its? numbers brought
A memory of something, not unsought,
That tinted all around with colours fair ;
So like a royal visitor it came,
Illuming every footstep of its love,
And my soul?s mansion with its ?ame ;
And these words ?woke on song: ?No more above
I wing strange ?ight, but round about thy door
With sister Spirits? hover evermore.?
So came the Spirit like a White-wing?d bird
Upon the shadows of the dark-waved deep,
And all the leathean dreamers rose from sleep,
As by a hopeful rising sea-breath stirr?d :
'1 he morning broke and high in heaven was heard
A sound of orisons for those whu weep,
And bonus of strength for feeble ones to keep,
And ever to the sorrow'd. was prefer"d ;
This shout : ? The loved one; gone are living still
\Vit?u happy patience Waiting with their love,
And watchful hope their mission to ful?l.? '
Hence once again these words : ? N 0 more above
I wing strung: ?ight, but mund about thy door,
VVith sister spirits hover evermore.?


And often now the same words ?ow apace,
And by the repetition grow more grand,
Like wavelets breaking on an open strand,
Or the same beauty in a. loved-one?s face ;
And ?nis a joy those loving words to trace
Back through the years that mem?ry can cmimzmd,
And ever see the Spirit blessing stand,
A white-robed angel in a black Priest?s place.
0 gracious mutiny against his reign,
bisplacing Winter with fl'uit-bearing leaves !
The rule of healing for the rule of pain I
Cathedrals changed to barns of harvest sheaves !
Gamers for truth with stores? for living bread,
Arid crystal waters from the fountain head.
And so my Soul grew large, for life was seen
Of new-born things, uncover?d mysteries
That glow?d like new-found isles in peaceful seas,
Where all had a. freezing terror been.
The young-day sun came pouring wide his sheen, ?
And sinners smote no more with banding knees
The midnight mete of penance miseries.
Or shrieked before the Priest.?s emblazoned screen
Of ever burning woe, such ~as to-day
At B=.-ddington glares on the labourers? seats,
While further in, where polish?d manners pray,
High art, with burnish?d ornament repeats
Heaven?s milder forms. Such cheerful clmnges ring
The joy-bells whivh the loving Spirits bring !
True to her truth, like all things ll<=aVen-born,
The Spirit beaming came in her own light,
Like some fair peeress in unborrow?d right,
Pure as the radiance of a. summer morn,
\Vhen mint leaves sparkle-, through the summer corn
Fresh painted with the dewy tints of night,
Ere the ?edged Lark has wing?d his early ?ight,


Or the wild bee has blown his morning horn.
I felt the preserce coming to renew
What my weak doubts in grief had thadow?d deep
And once again the brightness brighter grew,
And then the Spirit cried : ?The childish weep,
But this light is for manhood, keep the truth,
And doubt no more the Spirit light of Ruth.?
And then I knew that I was not alone
Beatingabout upon a cheerless sea
To find a haven in a mystery,
And anchorage in is deep and dark unknown.
And then from out the deep a great light shone,
And in that light, this message 1 could see:
? Where e?er your footsteps lead I?ll go with thee,
And when you think not, make my presence known.?
And then I bless'd the Spirit and there came
A force of that belief \x:hich never dies ;
It felt like hOlill(SS?Of that ?erce ?ame
Which lick?d the water from the sacri?ce ;
?Twas then I pledged, and Buth the colllpaci kiss?d,
And I became a Spiritualist.
But I, too careless, let the moments pass,
Forgltful of the Spirit waiting by, '
Till winter slept. and summer time came nigh,
And the keen scythe swept down the ripening grass.
And Tamar lay a stirless crystal glass??-
Re?ecting back bold pictures of the sky,
Wliere Saltash rear?d her smoking turrets high.
And. I was there, and many an anxious class
\Vere secking tokens from the Spirit spheres,
Wliile tables ioc-k?d, and rose, with wond?rous force
And Parsons smote their Congregations? cars
\Vith ?ery warnings till th�ir {Broats were hoarse:
And, in the turmoil, I, with untrue mood
Forgot how near the faithful Spirit stood.


In Culver Park?but few its beauty knew,
And that grand mind who lived its truthful rule??
A youth but newly parted from his school,
The Spirits moved a marvellous work to do ;
And to his aid with grand displays they ?ew:
And he was no uncertain phantom?s tool
To practice whims old women to befool ;
But with great purpose held his mission through.
One night he shouted loud ; ? A novel power !
By such, ere this, I never was control'd.
?Tis falling on me now as falls a shower."
And I was there???-?tis not that I was told??-
He grasped a pencil _and with force of truth,
In letters large he wrote this one word : ? RUTH.?
THE TRAVELLER.
Striding along with steps of swift intent,
A traveller presses, ?rm of foot and gaze,
W T TYet unbewilder?d by a thousand ways
Which wind about a bnundless continent,
On whose Wide stretch his looks are ever bent.
He never turns aside, nor lingering stays
To watch the rising or the setting rays;
Nor hesitates to meet a. steep ascent ;
And when a fallen rock impedes his way,
His sinewy shoulders bear the ponderous stone,
And, as a child would with a sand heap play,
Or catch the sphere his playful mate has thrown,
Or as the torrent to the valley ?ows,
\Vith ease the mighty obstacle he throws-


A noisy flock of carrion birds arise
Around that traveller, and shake the air
With scrannel echoes, shrieking everywhere,
And darkening pinions ?lling up the skies;
But still his staff the earnest traveller plies,
And lends not ear nor favor of his care
To where these creatures move, nor how they fare :
But ever forward guides his searching. eyes.
He asks not glass, nor measure of the toad,
He seeks not shelter from the threatening storm,
In coldest night in vain the warm abode
Offers a c�uch Where he may lay his form;
But pressing on, in spite of ?ood or wind,
He leaves the tearing carrioners behind. 3
The chilling clouds of evening heavy fall,
And all the glowing landscape disappears,?
And (What of light? is in the far off spheres,
And what of sound is silenced in night's pull.
A stillness as of death is hushing all
In slumbers cold and deep, save human fears,
And sorrow with her sacri?ce of tears ;
Yet through that hush there comes a. ringing call,
It has not sound of fright, or agony,
Its cheerful words are on the night breeze borne
Hopeful as brexk-day signals on the sea,
Proelaiming to the sleepless coming morn:
And this the cry: ?What darkness can obscure,
Or make myprogress to the light less sure ??
And there are thousands Waiting for the light,
Exger to check the traveller on his way,
Birds of the stagnant pool, and birds of prey,
Most Reverend birds of plumage black as night,
With outstretched beaks for ever on the flight,
VVhO seek the most where fattest insects stray,
And where the rivers ?ncst. ?sh display ;


And there their Wings with hungry swoop alight.
The fearless traveller still his strength renews,
And scares to hurried ?ight the ravening throng,
Like scallop?d pilgrim still his path pursues,
And cheers him on with this his matin Song:
?Forward! For allways I am bound to press,
And my control will ever be-Progress !?
TO MEMORY.
How like the sun upon Wild herbage live S
Thy loving life-kiss changeless memory!
For under the ?owers that love to be
Breathing thy smiles Wherever life survives ;
For Where thou art desponding sorrow strives
To shed it� husks, aid burgt, with petals free,
To spread a. fragrant sacri?ce to thee.
A sun-?lled memory how the heart revives
And takes its colour from thy ?ooding rays!
Year after year to be the same again!
Living on thee, prime light of all my days,
And wrestling hard the blesaing to iretainl
Like him of old, I will not let thee gi,
Till thy deep chisel my poor heart doth know.
Carve then such wellrem3m?.)3r?d circumstance
As I can give thee for thy graving tool,
That so the sculptured form shall be my rule,
My penates for worship, and pleasancc,
Devotion and delight, in contrivance,
Mingling, like skies and leafage on the pool,
The sun-warm?d cloudets with the shadows cool,


And I spectator of the chaste expanse.
So, pleased with gazing, life shall all renew
- Its early years, and ?owers yield again,
And summer walmth keep verdure on the view,
An (1 o?er the sculptured beauty ?ush amain.
O lovely artist! who can so impart
To faultless modelling the beating heart?
Restoring memory who bids me arm
Against the wear of time with sylvan staves,
And conquer age as ?owers conquer graves ;
To turn intomb?d regrets into a charm, V
And the swift river of the past becalm, it
And all the billowythunders{of its "waves
To tideless silence of the inland caves,
Or the low breathing of a Vesper psalm.
With each pale mom, and glow of mid-day light,
And every ?ush of the fading eve,
And every sleepless moment of the night,
Around my thoughts thy silken meghee Weave
Of fair remembrances, that I may ?nd
My life, like Wine, with lengthen?d years re?ned.
Lifeless they live some breathers of the air,
When beauty ?lls the bright domes of the World,
And the fresh sun has his young beams uphurl?d-
To reach the mellow cloudlets everywhere!
Sightless they see, some eyes, when pictures fair
Are with the petals of Wild ?oWer?s unfurl?d,
Or with the Woodbine round the nut-stems, curl?d!
Deaf are some ears when melodies are there!
But, memory! with thee life leaps in Song
With shouting multitudes of form and S-ound,
Timing thy footsteps as they pass along.
Nor less, \\ hen dalknessfells, do they abound
Where buoyant dreamers ?oat with lamps of light.
To make a glory of the darksome night.

Though they may ?ll Wide space and pass along

The following article from the ? Harbinger of Light,? of Nov.
1887, introducing the Sonnets on " The Conversion of Edward
Snell,? as being in connection therewith, is here inserted.
" There is something in this more than natural if philosophy
could ?nd it out.??SHAxasl>EA�n:?s ? HAMLET."
Deer Sir,~?The circumstance of your inserting my article of
?j A ' Thirty Years Investigation of Spiritualism,? in the
July number of the Harbinger, wherein Mr. Edward Snell
Was spoken of as a. convert from Materialism; and apropos of
that gentleman, and the now appended Sonnets written by
Mr. Cartwright, in London, and Who was then mentioned, shows
to my mind that a. spiritual ai?nity was existing between us,
although 16,000 miles distant. On the 27th August, I received
per mail the Sonnets, consequently the writer could not have
received the Harbinger which I sent him at the end of that
month. ,
Mr. Snell was well known in Geelong and Melbourne about
thirty years since, as the designer and constructor of the Mel-
bourne and Geelong Railway, which circumstance was brought
about by an apparent incident. Mr. Snell was on his way to
England after making his ? pile? at the diggings, and calling at
an establishment to be ? Tonsorilly? treated, whilst under the
operation an exclamation of surprise came from the operator
on seeing a carved head to a walking stick which Mr. Snell
carried, saying it was the exact resemblance of the Deacon of
his chapel. He asked permission to show it to some friends?
neighbouring tradesmen?who soon afterwards thronged the
shop; and .from the gossip which ensued it was discovered


that Mr. Snell was an engineer, had been at Swindon with
g�runell, and was then just embarking for ? England, Home,
and Beauty." The party advised Mr. Snell to stay here and
construct a railway to Geelong. His reply was ? you ?nd the
money, I will ?nd the brains.? A bargain was then struck,
that Mr. S. should draw the plans and speci?cations, get them
passed through the Legislature, for which he should receive
payment; but if he failed so to do, he would be content to have
the labour for his pains. ,_
7 The }:l?_c:v?:a&-_tl?l'e engine�fs ability by his accomplishing
the task, and afterwards carrying out the undertaking of con-
struction on his own estimates._
After the opening of this line another railway was offered him
to construct, but he gave the answer that he had now made
? two piles,? and he intended to put on English waters one of
the ?nest steam-yachts that over ?oated. '
There-is one more incident in connection with this locality I
may relate, as bearing on the philosophy of Spiritualism. Some
.few months after the conversion from Materialism of Mr. Snell
at an evening s�ancel, theitable was suddenly and violently
agitated, and in answer to the enquiry of whose spirit was pre-
sent, the reply was ? a former partner of Mr, Snell?s.? ?Is it
possible that ???? can have the assurance to come here after
having so wronged me almost to beggary and ruin! Off with
you. ? I put the question what object the spirit had in coming.
The answer was - ? to obtain Mr. Snell?s pardon for the many
crimes of forgery and robbery towards him.? We all appealed
for the spirit to receive the pardon he craved, but it had no
e?ect. At our next meeting the same spirit came again, and
Mr. S. was again stern and unrelenting notwithstanding his
implorings. The company one and all begged the boon to be
-granted, as the spirit could not make any progress from his
sphere until that pardon had been obtained. "? Well, then
??-?? I forgive ye,? said Mr. Snell; whereupon the action of
the table was so demonstrative for joy, that w� had to rise from
our seats.
I should not have gone so far into particulars, but possibly
there. are many parties yelrolive who remember Mr. Edward
Snell, of Geelong, where he built a villa and married; and after
the completion and opening of the railway there, at length set-
tled down at Culver Park, on the banks of the Tamar, England
liis talented family of seven sons (all called after the names of
Iflnglish Kings), are artists, electricians, engineers, etc., and
one daughter, who is also gifted, and resides with her estimable
mother. TAMAR BANKS.*
