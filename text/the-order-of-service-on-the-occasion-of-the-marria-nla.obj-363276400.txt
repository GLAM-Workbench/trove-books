Dearly Beloved, we are assembled here in this Cathedral to join
in spirit with our kinsfolk all over the Commonwealth and Empire;
to give hearty thanks to Almighty God for the marriage of the Princess
Elizabeth and Philip Mountbatten; to ask God’s gracious blessing on
their lives; and to reaffirm, on this happy occasion, our loyalty to our
Sovereign Lord, King George, and the British Commonwealth and
Empire.
Versicle: Lift up your hearts.
Response: We lift them up unto the Lord.
Versicle: Let us give thanks unto our Lord God.
Response: It is meet and right so to do.
THE NATIONAL ANTHEM
Hymn
Praise, my soul, the King of heaven;
To His feet thy tribute bring;
Ransom’d, heal’d, restored, forgiven,
Who like thee His praise shall sing?
Praise Him, praise Him,
Praise the everlasting King.


Praise Him for His grace and favour
To our fathers in distress;
Praise Him still the same as ever,
Slow to chide, and swift to bless:
Praise Him, praise Him,
Glorious in His faithfulness.
Father-like He tends and spares us;
Well our feeble frame He knows;
In His hands He gently bears us.
Rescues us from all our foes:
Praise Him, praise Him,
Widely as His Mercy flows.
Angels, help us to adore Him,
Ye behold Him face to face;
Sun and moon, bow down before Him;
Dwellers all in time and space,
Praise Him, praise Him,
Praise with us the God of grace. Amon.
Let us pray.
Lord, have mercy upon us.
Christ, have mercy upon us.
Lord, have mercy upon us.
A PRAYER FOR THE PRINCESS ELIZABETH.
O God, our loving Heavenly Father, in whom all the families of
the earth are blessed: we humbly beseech Thee to bless the Princess
Elizabeth on this her wedding-day; that her husband may be to her
a strength in need, a comfort in sorrow, a counsellor in perplexity, a
companion in joy; and grant that they both may be so filled with
spiritual benediction and grace, that, living together in perfect love
and holy peace in this world, in the world to come they may obtain
life everlasting; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
A PRAYER FOR PHILIP MOUNTBATTEN.
Almighty God, our Heavenly Father, we pray thee to regard with
Thy loving-kindness, Thy servant Philip Mountbatten: grant him, O
Father, great joy in his family life; give him wisdom and discretion
in his new responsibilities, and the spirit of humility and steadfast
devotion, that he may ever seek the advancement of the true welfare
of Thy people; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.


THE LORD’S PRAYER.
V. O Lord, save Thy servant and Thy handmaid.
R. Who put their trust in Thee.
V. O Lord, send them help from Thy holy place.
R. And evermore defend them.
V. Be unto them a tower of strength;
R. From the face of their enemy.
V. O Lord, hear our prayer
R. And let our cry come unto Thee.
O Eternal God, Creator and Preserver of all mankind, giver of
all spiritual grace, the author of everlasting life: send Thy blessing
upon these Thy servants, for whom we pray; that, living faithfully
together, they may surely perform and keep the vow and covenant
betwixt them made, whereof the ring given and received will be a
token and pledge; and may ever remain in perfect love and peace
together, and live according to Thy laws; through Jesus Christ our
Lord. Amen.
O Merciful Lord and heavenly Father, by whose gracious gift
mankind is increased; bestow, we beseech Thee, upon these two persons
the heritage and gift of children; and grant that they may live together
so long in godly love and honesty, that they may see their children
Christianly and virtuously brought up, to Thy praise and honour;
through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
Deus Misereatur. Psalm 67.
God be merciful unto us, and bless us: and shew us the light of
his countenance, and be merciful unto us;
That thy way may be known upon earth; thy saving health among
all nations.
Let the people praise thee, O God: yea, let all the people praise
thee.
O let the nations rejoice and be glad; for thou shait judge the folk
righteously, and govern the nations upon earth.
Let the people praise thee, O God: let all the people praise thee.
Then shall the earth bring forth her increase: and God, even our
own God, shall give us his blessing.
God shall bless us: and all the ends of the world shall fear him.
Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the
Holy Ghost, as it was in the beginning, is now,
and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.


A PRAYER FOR THE KING.
Thou Wonderful Counsellor, King of Kings and Lord of Lords,
send Thy blessing upon our Sovereign lord, King George. Strong in
counsel, patient in action, pure in motive, striving for the welfare of
his people, may his great Kingdom ever be Thy Kingdom, Thy law his
law, Thy glory his renown. And for us who are his subjects grant us
to walk worthy of his royal command that our humble service may
never be his shame; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
A PRAYER FOR THE ROYAL FAMILY.
Remember for good, O Father, the family with which Thou has
surrounded our King. For our gracious Queen Elizabeth; for Mary,
the Queen Mother and all the Royal Family, we seek Thy blessing;
may Thy Fatherly hand be over them uniting them in a common bond
of love towards Thee, guiding them in the daily walk of life; sup-
porting them in the varied duties to which their high station calls
them; bringing to them health and happiness and true joy in the
knowledge and love of Thee and Thy dear Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.
Amen.
A PRAYER FOR THE BRITISH COMMONWEALTH AND
EMPIRE.
O God, who hast called our nation to a place of trust and respon-
sibility throughout the world: we humbly thank Thee for all the ways
in which Thou hast blessed and guided us unto this day. We confess
before Thee with shame all that has been unrighteous in our history,
and all that even now makes us unworthy to be called a Christian
people. Take from us, we pray Thee, all pride and greed and injustice,
and grant to us the spirit of unselfish service which alone can make
us great; and may the love of Christ be so truly shown forth through
us, that His name shall be glorified among all nations; through the
same Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
THE GRACE.
ANTHEM.
BLESSED BE THE GOD AND FATHER (Wesley)
Love one another with a pure heart fervently, See that ye love one
another.

OFFERTORY HYMN.
(After expenses have been covered the balance of the offertory will be
devoted to the Food for Britain Fund.)
Lead us, heavenly Father, lead us
O’er the world’s tempestuous sea;
Guard us, guide us, keep us, feed us,
For we have no help but Thee;
Yet possessing
Every blessing,
If our God our Father be.
Saviour, breathe forgiveness o’er us;
All our weakness Thou dost know;
Thou didst tread this earth before us,
Thou didst feel its keenest woe;
Lone and dreary,
Faint and weary,
Through the desert Thou didst go.
Spirit of our God, descending,
Fill our hearts with heavenly joy;
Love with every passion blending,
Pleasure that can never cloy:
Thus provided,
Pardon’d, guided,
Nothing can our peace destroy.
Amen.
THE WEDDING MARCH (Mendelssohn).
THE BLESSING.
Closing voluntary; "The Crown Imperial” (William Walton).


Extract from Princess Elizabeth’s Coming of Age Broadcast on 21st
April, 1947:
If we go forward together with an unwavering faith, a
high courage, and a quiet heart, we shall be able to make of this
ancient Commonwealth, which we all love so dearly, an even grander
thing, more free, more prosperous, more happy and a more powerful
influence for good in the world than it has been in the greatest days
of our forefathers.
To accomplish that we must give nothing less than the whole
of ourselves. There is a motto which has been borne by many of my
ancestors —a noble motto: T serve’. These words were an inspiration
to many bygone heirs to the throne when they made their knightly
dedication as they came to manhood. I cannot do quite as they did,
but through the inventions of science I can do what was not possible
for any of them —I can make my solemn act of dedication with the
whole Empire listening. I should like to make that dedication now.
It is very simple. I declare before you all that my whole life, whether
it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service and the service
of our great imperial family to which we all belong. But I shall not
have strength to carry out this resolution alone unless you join in it
with me as I now invite you to do. I know that your support will be
unfailingly given.
God help me to make good my vow and God bless ail of you
who are willing to share in it.”
