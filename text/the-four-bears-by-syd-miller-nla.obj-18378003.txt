Just as Davy Dingo was about to pop the twins into the pot, he heard
a knock at the door! It was Father William Bear back from the store.


Father William Bear heard the twins crying, but the door was barred
and bolted!

Taking his brand new axe, he threw it through the window and hit
Davy Dingo right on the head.

Father William Bear quickly climbed through the broken window and
set them all free.


They all drove Davy Dingo away with his tail between his legs!


Then, the Four Bears had a real party with chocolate cake, gum blossom
pie and eucalyptus tea.
Father William Bear promised never to leave them all alone again.
