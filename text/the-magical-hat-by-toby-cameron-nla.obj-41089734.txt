to spin his web these seven little babies had
grown into seven little witchlings. Their names

LONG, long, long ago—as long ago as
Doomsday—there lived a silly old Witch
and her name was Elvira. She lived
with her family in a great old cave right in the
deepest deep of a deep, dark forest, and the
cave was very old and chilly inside. It had
lots of little passages running through it and
holes in its walls. Toadstools grew in the
damp ground and it really made a wonderful
place for Elvira's seven littie baby daughters
to play in.
which were not witch-like names at all, were
they? But you see, Elvira secretly wished that
they wouldn't be witches when they grew up as
she sometimes felt all good inside and not a
bit magic and she got tired of thinking out new
spells, and talking to toads and things like that
Now these seven little baby daughters were
all bom at the same time and most of them
had their mother's nose, which was large and
very good, to snore through. Now I don’t think
you know that witches' babies grow up very
quickly, and in less time than it takes a spider

absolutely insisted on learning to ride their
seven broomsticks. Every night, as dusk fell,
they were out swishing and swirling over the
tops of the trees in the deep, deep forest and
it was hard work for the little witchlings—as the
broomsticks were frisky and full of magic
powers—and no wonder, for they had once be-
longed to the family of the very first witch who
was ever born! But the trees in the deep, deep
forest just hated the witchlings and their
broomsticks and they groaned and creaked in
disgust and tried to catch them with their leafy
fingers. When the flying lessons were over
and the seven broomsticks were parked in
seven old tree tops
went home through the deep, deep forest and
went to bed in their seven little crooks and

nannies; I mean nooks and crannies inside the
old cave.
Now, Elvira slept on a spring mattress and
she slept so soundly that she snored and snored
and snored through her big nose and woke up
all the trees and the birds of the forest—and
the Ant people—and the Lizards—and the Bat
family—every single night, until one dark night
Father Bat got really wild and flapping his
wings he hastily called a meeting in the hol-
low mountain and he said:
"Fellow Sufferers: We have stood this ter-
rible noise long enough, for as you know, it is
Elvira, the witch, who lives in the old cave who
snores and snores and snores and keeps us
and our babies awake. NOW THIS MUST BE
STOPPED—what are we going to do about it
Page Six
for I know that
have got big noses too and very soon they will
be snoring also and the noise will grow
LOUDER and LOUDER AND WE SHALL ALL
BE DEAFENED. I say again: WHAT SHALL
WE DO ABOUT IT?"
And the Trees outside Hollow Mountain
heard Father Bat and groaned and shook their
branches in agreement and quivered at their

roots.
Suddenly a tiny voice piped up: "I have a
suggestion to make. Let's steal Elvira's hat;
she can't sleep without it. I know because it
is magic and if she can't sleep she can't
snore!"
Everybody cheered and shouted and Father
Bat said In a loud voice, "Ye wings and toes!
That's a grand idea but who will steal Elvira's
hat?"
After a lot of talking it was agreed that
someone should be chosen who could move
very quickly in the dark and escape if the
witch awoke. So, at long last, after several
meetings, a vote was taken and Jack Daw was
chosen to do the deed which was really lucky
for him because he was already under a spell
Page Eight
for stealing, and this would give him a chance
of pardon. He was rather a nasty sort of bird
anyway.
"Well," said Jack Daw, when he knew the
worst, "I won't be too sure of getting the Hat,
for Elvira is very magical, even in her sleep.
She might wake up and magic me twice over
and that would be a pretty kettle of fish but
I'll try, folks. I'll do my best."
Everybody clapped and flapped wings and
sang "For he's a Jolly Good Fellow," although
they didn't really think so, and Jack Daw felt
mightily pleased with life.
One dark, dark night, when the world was
asleep and Elvira's snores were louder than
ever and all the forest folk were lying awake
listening, Jack Daw flew, sleekly and silently,
from his perch in the tallest tree, through the
deep, deep darks of the Forest into the Cave.

Sure enough there was Elvira —and there
was the Hat on her head!
"Here goes!" thought Jack Daw, and perched
himself very carefully, very quietly on the end
of Elvira's long nose. The snores made her
nose wriggle and Jack Daw had a job not to
fall off. After counting twenty he decided to

but theirs were only little whistly snores.
"Gee! this is awful," thought Jack Daw. "I
simply must get this old Hat or be spelled
again. I'll have another try." So this time
he took a big piece of the hat and gave a
great big HUGE PULL and a TUG and a GRAB
and—Hey Presto! —off flew the hat and dis-
appeared with a loud BANG in a puff of green
smoke —and standing there instead of Elvira
the witch was a beeeeeoooootiful young girl,
with blue hair and yellow eyes. I mean blue
eyes and yellow hair, and a silver dress with
a train.
"Oh, thank you, thank you, my wonderful

trillion years for this to happen to break the

Maudie and her husband, A KIND GIANT,
searched for the Magic Hat.

were all quarrelling and saying nasty witch-
like things to their cross husbands, and the
Giants were getting really angry and starting
to break down the branches of the trees and
throwing great rocks about the deep, deep
forest, and Maudie sighed a big sigh and wish-
ed that all giants were kind, like her husband,
who never threw rocks about, and who liked
almost everybody, such a dear old softie he
was and Maudie loved him very, very much
and because she loved him so much it made
her heart feel all warm and glowy and she
thought it would be wonderful to find the Magic
Hat and to put
Page Eleven

and their cross Giants under a spell of kind-
ness. So she told A KIND GIANT her idea
and he thought it was a very good idea and
Maudie climbed nearer to his face and gave
him a smacky kiss right on his big nose and
she thought, "While I am so near his ears I
will tell him my plan too," and she did—and
A KIND GIANT was very pleased about the
plan and said "YES!"—and the plan was that
they should all go AT ONCE on the Wonderful
Aaventure and do you know they wanted
Page Twelve
and the bad Giants to go too, because it would
be good for them and might stop them quar-
relling.
So, one bright, yellowy, dawny morning
Maudie got up very early and woke A KIND
GIANT and the six little witch wives and their
six husbands and told them to get ready for a
long journey. Nobody had any seven league
boots, which was a great pity, as Giants usu-
ally have them. But it couldn't be helped and
after six fights and ten arguments it was
decided that A KIND GIANT should lead the
way because he was ten minutes older than
the others! You would have laughed to see
the giants each carrying his little wife. Ethel
and Edith each rode in pockets because they
had cold feet. Mildred liked the brim of her


THE MAGICAL HAT
husband's hat because she could lie down and
go to sleep there. Fanny sat jauntily on her
giant's hand, while Agatha and Amy snuggled
in the crooks of their husband's arms. Oh!
and Maudie —our little Maudie —rode on A
KIND GIANT'S shoulder so that she could talk
to him and kiss his nose. At first the others
all talked and quarrelled and sulked very
loudly but as the day got older and Mr. Sun
began to get tired, so did the giants and their
wives. Very soon their great big eyelids be-
came heavy with sleep and they dragged their
great feet. One by one six clumsy giants and
six drowsy wives stumbled and fell by the side
of the road.
Now Maudie and A KIND GIANT had made
up their minds to get that hat and so they went
on—and on—and on—for ages of time and
always there was a soft shining light dancing
on the road before them. Maudie thought in
her mind that it was some sort of Magic and
as she thought, a little dancy voice said, "Hey
folks, you can see me but in a manner of
speaking you can't see me. I'm LUCK, your
guide, and if you trust me everything will go
well with you. So follow my light."
Maudie and A KIND GIANT were ever so
thrilled and the light seemed to know the way,
for it lit up the road as they walked and A
KIND GIANT was so huge, you know, that he
stepped right over forests and mountains and
things like that. But at last they reached one
ENORMOUS mountain that was much too high
for him to step over so he and Maudie had to
Page Thirteen


THE MAGICAL HAT
get down on all fours like a Giant's puss cat—
and her kitten—for Maudie got on A KIND
GIANT'S back and they crawled and crept
very, very carefully into the entrance of the
great huge mountain. And what a noise in-
side! —laughing and giggling and singing and
chattering; of all the queer places it was the
queerest. Coloured shadows and rainbow
cobwebs stretched across their path and made
their noses itch as they pushed through them
and heaps and heaps of gorgeous precious
stones, like diamonds and rubies and pearls
hung in ropes—mind you—from the roof. Music
seemed to come from the air and then vanished
as quickly as it came.
"This must be Dream Mountain,” thought
Maudie, "and it's not real at all and it won't be
Page Fourteen
long before we are out.”
But all the same she felt just a teeny weeny
bit frightened until she remembered Luck. And
suddenly, right out of the blue, something
tickled A KIND GIANT'S big toe and gave him
such a fright that he jumped about sixty thous-
and giant's feet into the air and bumped his
kind head on the roof of the mountains.
Maudie turned no less than twenty-five somer-
saults right down A KIND GIANT'S back and
landed upside down, mind you, on the ground
next to something that cried in a little girl's
voice, "Please don't be cross. I'm having a
nightmare about giants and I'm lightened—'cos
I'm only three and a bit and please don't tread
on me again.”
Maudie and A KIND GIANT picked them-


THE MAGICAL HAT
selves up slowly and painfully, and groping
about in the dark A KIND GIANT caught the
little girl in his huge hand and held her up to
his face so that he could see her.
"WHY,” he boomed, "IT'S A LITTLE EARTH
GIRL—AND SHE'S GOT RED HAIR. COME
AND LOOK, MAUDIE. SHALL WE TAKE HER
WITH US?"
The little girl wriggled and cried and cried
and Maudie said:
"Don't cry, little girl. My husband is A KIND
GIANT and loves little girls with red hair
—truly he does—so you tell us your name and
we will help you if we can."
The little girl said: "My name is Electra
Bunnynose and I want to go home."
And Maudie said: "Well, Miss Madam
Electro Bunnynose, I'm sorry but you can't go
home just now, you will have to come with
us and help us to find the Magic Hat and when
we have found it, maybe there will be a special
spell to send you home again—and if you are
extra specially good you can ride on A KIND
GIANT'S other shoulder, but be careful 'cos
every time he sneezes it is like a big wind and
might blow you off—so my advice is to hang
on to his ear."
Do you know, the little girl cheered up
straight away and her blue eyes twinkled and
she clambered with her legs and arms right
up A KIND GIANT'S long back on to his shoul-
der and seated herself there like a little queen.
By this time the dreamy things had vanished
and they were outside the mountain in the light

again, and they blinked their eyes and looked
and looked at the splendiferous things they
saw. For everything and everybody and
every tree and every flower and every-
thing was of a scummy rose-pink colour. Even
Maudie and Electra and A KIND GIANT were
pink.
'T think someone is tricking us, Mr. KIND
GIANT," said Electra, standing up to shout in
his ear. "And, my goodness, what are those
two great big pink windows over your eyes
with a bridge in the miggle?"
"Oh, THEY MUST BE THE FAMOUS ROSE-
COLOURED SPECTACLES," said A KIND
GIANT, "THAT ONLY VERY SPECIAL PEOPLE
CAN WEAR."
"But they help, don't they?" said a small

pink bird from a pink leaf on a pink tree. "I

Dreams to make the way seem brighter. lam
another guide and my name is PATIENCE and
you will need me, for your LUCK has turned
and there is a long weary journey before you
still; I mean before you reach the Lost Limbo.
Can you swim?"
Maudie and her KIND GIANT were very sur-
prised at this question and said, "Yes, they
could swim." But Miss Madam Electra Bunny-
nose wasn't too sure about it and anyway she
hadn't brought her "bathers" along, and then
everybody laughed and tried to be very jolly
but inside they felt disappointed about LUCK
and decided to make the best of it, and the
pink place was getting on their nerves and
they ALL—especially Electra Bunnynose—
wanted their Mummies for even Giants have
Mummies, you know. Besides poor KIND
GIANT had got two huge pink blisters like
party balloons on his heels. As for Maudie
and Electra —well, Maudie was hungry and
Miss Madam Electra Bunnynose had lost her
appetite and, oh! dear, it was getting hard,
but you know when you want a thing very
badly it's always hard to get, isn't it? The
real trouble was that they were all very, very
tired.
At that instant —just like Magic—SLEEP sent
her Cloud Bus and it caught them up in its
billowy arms and gave them a lift away up
over the pink land and in ten twinks they were
all asleep. And it bumbled along, did the
Page Seventeen

Cloud Bus, on its round cloud wheels and it
was lovely.
But all good things come to an end and soon
it was time to wake up and A KIND GIANT
stretched his huge legs about four miles in one
direction and yawned a big yawn before he
opened his eyes.
And where do you think he was? In the
Bus? No! In bed? No!
He was lying all by himself in the middle of
the desert! Sand everywhere—nothing else.
Just sand—and no Maudie and Electra.
"By scriminy,” he muttered, and shouted and
called their names over and over again and
the desert echoed back—"Maudie”—"Electra”
—"Maudie"—"Electra”—until A KIND GIANT
got very cross.
Page Eighteen
For the first time in his kind life he was
angry!
"Somebody must have stolen them,” he
thought. Wherever had they gone to?— His
dear little wifey and the little earth girl with
red hair. Oh, dear, what would

say to him when they found out that he had
lost Maudie. It was his punishment for leav-
ing them all sleeping by the side of the road,
and poor KIND GIANT began to cry. As he


THE MAGICAL HAT
cried his great drops of tears were like young
waterfalls and they gushed down his face and
sank into the sand around him and made it all
swampy and A KIND GIANT began to sink
into the damp sand. Down, down, down, he
went through the sand land into Crab Country,
past the Valley of Shells until —SPLOSH—
SPLASH —his huge body dropped like a ton of
stone into a pool way down beneath the depths
of sand. He struggled and got water in his
nose and when A KIND GIANT had got his
breath back he discovered that it wasn't deep
water at all. When he had dragged himself
upright he looked up—up —and "Hmmm, he
said, 'T DON'T REACH VERY FAR IN THESE
PARTS. THIS IS BY FAR THE WORST HOLE
I'VE EVER BEEN IN. I MUST GET OUT OF IT
QUICKLY AND FIND THE OTHERS.”
He began to scrabble with his big hands into
the sandy side of the deep, deep hole and
soon he had made a passage big enough to get
his head and shoulders through. Last of all,
inch by inch (which takes a terrible long time
for a giant) he managed to slide the rest of him-
self into the tunnel he had made. Lying on
his tummy just like a worm, he wriggled and
wriggled through that tunnel for what seemed
like hundreds of miles. He was full of sand—
eyes, ears and between his toes were just
clogged up.
"OH, MERCY ME, WILL IT EVER END,”
thought A KIND GIANT as he wormed along.
"MAYBE, IF I HUNCH MYSELF UP I CAN
BURST THROUGH THE ROOF AND REACH
Page Nineteen


THE MAGICAL HAT
THE WORLD AGAIN OR AT LEAST MAKE A
LITTLE MORE ROOM TO BREATHE IN.”
"Go carefully, then, Mr. Giant," said a
scratchy sort of voice right in his left ear drum.
"My house happens to be situated right over
your head as we are now and I'm not able to
get out of your stupid ear to protect it and if
you intend hunching yourself up, as you call
it, kindly wriggle a little further on or my house
will be ruined. lam the Sandman who helps
put little children to sleep. Im rather famous
in books, you know. Children pretend they
don t like me but they do really and truly, I'm
so comforting. So will you oblige me by shak-
ing your kind head and perhaps I will drop
out of your ear."
So our kind giant, who was very tired by this
Page Twenty
time, slowly shook his heavy head to and fro
and got more sand in himself, this time in his
nose.
Well, I'm out,” said the scratchy voice.
Thanks a lot. You can hump up now, Mr.
Giant, and thanks a lot."
AND ABOUT TIME, TOO,” muttered A
KIND GIANT. Slowly and carefully he climb-
ed from his flat wormy position to his knees
and holding his breath he humped himself up,
up, up—through the Valley of Shells, Crab
Country and Sand Land—until his huge body
was almost straight upright.
"ONCE MORE,” he said, and—yes—he did
it —he burst right through the sand into the
beautiful brilliant blue air againl
There he stood with his head and shoulders

slicking out of the desert just like a statue in
a park. (Oh! he did look funny). There
stretching out in front of him was the sea —the
salt sea. Somebody was laughing and he
knew that laugh—it gurgled and chuckled and
went right from the top of the scale to the bot- f
tom. There was a fat laugh, too —-a little girl s
happy fat laugh.
"IT'S MY DEARS. MAUDIE, IS THAT
YOU?" he called in a very thick sandy voice.
"I've been having an awful time. Where are
you?"
"We're here, right under your nose," said
Maudie. "And we were getting so tired of wait-
ing for you, and Miss Madam Electra Bunny-
nose was getting difficult and the train couldn't
wa it —so —we —got—off—here and so did
and their husbands, and they have gone to
afternoon tea with the three Walruses! And,
oh, dear, Miss Madam Electra Bunnynose has
been very trying but a kind old snake came up
and amused her by doing a dance with two
stick insects and she soon felt better and it is
lovely to see you again."
Maudie suddenly felt terribly happy and she
and Electra and A KIND GIANT hugged each
other and did little dances of joy and quite

forgot the strange place they were in.
DO ASK Ml HOW I GOT HERE,” said A
KIND GIANT. Maudie and Electra asked him,
and he told them all about everybody and they
told him he was very clever.
He said: "NOW IT'S MY TURN TO ASK
YOU HOW YOU GOT HERE."
Maudie said: "You ought to know."
A KIND GIANT said: "IT PUZZLES ME HOW
I GOT ON TO THE DESERT BY MYSELF IN
THE FIRST PLACE."
Maudie said: "Silly, you lost patience in the
cloud bus and just fell out of it on to the desert.
We finished the trip and changed at Memory
Station into the train of thought which was full
of
Page Twenty-two
and their husbands
who caught it about ten winks before we did.
So there is the story in a nutshell."
What s in a nutshell? I want to go in a
nutshell. I want to go home in a nutshell,"
worried the little earth girl with red hair.
Maudie gave her a look—one of those—you
be quiet—Oß—sort of looks that Mummies and
Aunties sometimes give you when they are
nearly cross.
Miss Madam Electra Bunnynose caught the

look and thought in hor small head, "I'd better
be quiet" and she was!
So Maudie and A KIND GIANT went on with
their talking.
Maudie said: "Can you explain the Moun-
tains—the Sand Mountains that popped up like
a string of huge yellow beads?"
"SILLY, YOURSELF," said A KIND GIANT.
"THAT WAS ME HUMPING UP UNDER THE
SAND. I THINK I WAS VERY CLEVER TO
GET OUT OF THAT HOLE. I'M A VERY
CLEVER GIANT, I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW."
"Yes, you are," whispered Maudie in an
aggravating voice, "but you haven't found the
Magic Hat yet, my clever one. We must keep
on trying or i
and their husbands will race us and that would
be silly."
So they decided to keep on trying even if it
was ever—ever —so hard to find (I mean the
Magic Hat).
After having a pretend wash in a pretend
pool with pretend soap and towels and eating
an enormous pretend dinner out of nothing, our
three started off once again, Maudie and
Electra seated as before on A KIND GIANT'S

shoulders.
"We lost PATIENCE and now I suppose we
must have faith in ourselves," thought Maudie.
"Such a dear little pink bird, he was. He was
a great help especially with Electra Bunny-
nose."
"I want to go home in a Nut wailed
the little earth child. "S HSH H H H," said
A KIND GIANT, but he forgot how strong his
breath was and it took Maudie and Electra and
twirled them round and round like two atoms
in the air and they blew away and got caught
on the horns of a giraffe in Africa and they took
ages to think themselves back again on to A
KIND GIANT'S shoulders. And when they did
get back A KIND GIANT just roared and roared
with jolly, gusty giant's laughter. His shoul-

ders shook and poor Maudie and Electra felt
quite sick and still A KIND GIANT LAUGHED
and his cheeks wabbled and his body trembled
and he just could not stop. So Maudie and
Electra had to get together and do something


even
ETHEL
EDITH

to stop him so they held on to his big nose and
pinched it until he stopped.
"MY JIGGERS,” he said, "THAT WAS
FUNNY" —for a good laugh cures all the
troubles in the world; it does truly.
Then they all got giggly again and so did
the Giraffe in Africa and the Snake that danced
for Electro;
and their cross husbands—they ACTUALLY
LAUGHED, for laughter is catching and had
come to help them find the Magic Hat.
"Pardon me, is there a joke on," said a
•smooth black voice. "I thought we were hav-
ing a nice lady-like afternoon tea when all this
giggling upset the Apple Cart."
"I want an Apple. Can I have an apple—-
a toffy apple?" began Miss Madam Electra
Bunnynose in a waily sort of a voice.
Quick as lightning she got a look and it
withered her and she went all quiet and pre-

"If you speak again, little earth person," said
Maudie, in a slightly witch-like voice, "you
won't be here to say it"—which was double,

"Can I give you another cup of afternoon
or is it morning tea? asked the black-voiced
one, who was none other than a very fussy
elderly lady walrus, who lived with her
brothers on the shore of the sea that A KIND
GIANT saw when he was being a statue in
the sand.
I DON'T TAKE TEA," said A KIND GIANT,
"AND ANY WAY, I'M AFRAID I'VE NOT MET
YOUR BROTHERS," he remarked, trying not to
laugh at the two very old walruses who were
sitting holding flippers and sharpening their
tusks on a rock.
An elderly lady walrus, and her two brothers.
"Oh, you mean Oswald and Egbert," said the
sleek, smooth-voiced one. "They don't want
to meet people. All they think about is sharp-
ening their tusks. They do it all day and all

night. Im. sick of them. Now, if you were
to ask me I might be able to put you in the way
of something you are looking for but you must
get on the right side of me first.” So all of
them, including
and their cross husbands, got on the right side
of the lady Walrus and listened while she un-
folded her tale.
"Giants, little girl, and er—wives,” she be-
gem. You see this sea. Well, it is nearly
your last trial. You must swim it before you
com hope to reach the Lost Limbo, but I warn
you that it is full of stumbling-blocks planted
there by the Man Who Knows All. We were
seekers too, my brothers and I (sob) and we
too (sob) were very nice people, but we tripped
up on all sorts of stumbling-blocks cmd some-
body turned us into three Walruses. So it has
been our job ever since to help seekers on
their way, so remember, a thing worth doing is
worth doing well. My Grandmother used to
say that and she was a very superior person,

mother four million times removed was the very
first witch who was ever bom in the whole
world, so there—! And if I find the Magic Hat
I stand a good chance of becoming a witch,
too —a nice kind witch, mind you, but magical
all the same. So don't boast, Mrs Walrus, it
won't get you anywhere."
'T want to be a witch! I want to be a
w.' . . . yelled Miss Madam Electra Bun-
nynose. "I want a green magic hat and . . ."
Maudie looked and looked and as usual it
worked and the little voice dwindled away into
nothingness.
"WELL, PEOPLE I'M TIRED OF ALL THIS
TALK. YOU WOMEN ARE ALL THE SAME,"
said A KIND GIANT—not too kindly, I'm sorry
to say. He immediately took a mighty leap
Page Twenty-eight
and hurled himself into the deep blue sea and
started to swim and puff like mad. So did —

and their husbands. Yes, they all jumped In
together—wives on husbands' backs—and
what a stormy sea it was. Great giants' arms
flashing through the waves and big puffy
breathing, which made waves like young
mountains, lust like a lot of whales they were
and the little witch wives hung on as best
they could.


THE MAGICAL HAT
Maudie and Electra Bunnynose stood like
two lost little figures on the rocks, waving and
shouting at A KIND GIANT to make him see
them. All of a sudden A KIND GIANT gave
a big gurgle and his head disappeared under
the water.
"Looks like a stumbling-block to me," said
the fussy lady walrus. "I warned him," —and
she was quite right. It was a great big slip-
pery, slimy stumbling-block, and it had caught
A KIND GIANT by the foot and what do you
think its name was—IMPATIENCE. Because
of it A KIND GIANT had to struggle to get
free and then swim all the way back again to
the beginning—back to the rocks where Maudie
and Electra waited.
They didn t say a single word because they
felt so sorry for A KIND GIANT but he send,
IT SERVES ME RIGHT. Come on!" and he
knelt down so that Maudie and Electra could
get a good seat on his back and then he dived
very carefully and quietly back Into the sea.
This is lovely. Much nicer than a nut-
shell," said the red-headed child. "But, Mr.
Kind Giant, I do feel so sorry for those three
poor walruses. Couldn't you help them-
pleeeese."
"I hope we get there first," whispered Maudie
in A KIND GIANT'S ear and quite ignoring
Miss Madam Electra Bunnynose's conversation.
WE WILL, shouted A KIND GIANT, and no
sooner had he shouted, than twelve voices
gave twelve shouts and twelve heads dis-
appeared under the water and of course they

and their husbands, had to swim all the way
back again to the beginning and there they
stayed, I'm glad to say, because they were too
tired and had decided amongst themselves
that it didn't matter if Maudie did find the Magic
Hat because she was their sister and would
be sure to lend it to them. And while they
were thinking these things A KIND GIANT and
Page Thirty
Maudie and Electra had reached the other side
of the water.
"I KNEW IT! I KNEW IT! WE HAVE
WON!” cried A KIND GIANT. "BRAVO!
HOORAY! JOLLY JINKS!"
The poor old giant struggled up the slippery
bank and fell a very, very tired giant onto the
shore.
Maudie and Electra in weak voices said
they were ever so glad, and then their knees
sort of crinkled up and they fell down too on
the shore.
It was a beeeeeeeooootiful place. Piles and
piles of brightly-coloured shells lay every-
where and they were made of transparent
glass or perhaps they were real precious
stones but it was all simply gorgeous. The

"Wrinkled up her little nose

sand was made of silver like the stuff on
Christmas trees —you know—and there was a
gorgeous smell like turkey and ham cooking
and Miss Madam Electra Bunnynose wrinkled
up her little nose and thought,
"I bleeve I'm hungry. I hope I find my
appetite as well as the Magic Hat.''
And Maudie and A KIND GIANT said it must
be Christmas Day and promptly went to sleep.
So did Electra and they slept for about forty
winks and when they woke up they felt much
better.
They saw Something for the first time. It
was a marvellous pattern made of the coloured
shells and it spelt out: "Lost Limbo Land"—
all in shells. And there was a signpost made
of milk chocolate and written on it was: "This

way to the Lest Property Cave."
Maudie, AKG (I'm getting tired of writing the
names) and EBN ,said in one voice:
"THAT MUST BE WHERE THE HAT IS.
LET'S GOI"
They sat up suddenly and AKG. nearly
squashed EBN., who howled and imme-
diately demanded her Mummy and they blew
her eyes—l mean wiped her eyes-—and made
her lots of promises and then got terribly ex-
cited because they had reached the Lost Limbo.
"I shall soon be able to wear the hat and
make Magic Spells—good ones," said Maudie,
who was quite beside herself. She did a little
hoppitty, skippitty dance, which cheered up
Miss Madame Electra Bunnynose as dances
always did (remember the snake?).
Page Thirty-two
They all started laughing again. A KIND
GIANT laughed so much he split on© of his
sides and had to have it mended by an oblig-
ing octopus, who lent him one of his feelers
and it acted just like one of those zippers. That
little repair took about twenty winks and sec-
retly annoyed Maudie, who wanted to be a
real witch so badly that she just couldn't bear
to wait.
"Oh, come on—DO " she said, a bit crossly.
"Let's be getting on our way. We can't afford
to wait."
"Not so fast. Not so fast," said a tiny little
perky voice they all remembered. "I'm back
—PATIENCE—you will need me these last few
miles for this is the very last test of all and
this is it —the road to the Cave is made of


THE MAGICAL HAT
Cocoanut Ice and you must wait kindly and
with me while Miss Madam Electra Bunnynose
satisfies her appetite, which is really lost but
she is being lent it for a little while. And if
you lose me again the Lost Limbo will dis-
appear for ever from your reach and you will
find yourselves right back where you started.”
Then A KIND GIANT smiled one of his very
extra specially kind smiles. Beaming all over
his nice face he lifted the little jed-headed
earth girl ever, ever so gently off his shoulder
and put her on the ground.
"WELL, THANKS, BROTHER,” he said, "IT
DOES ME GOOD TO SEE HER ENJOY HER-
SELF AND I ALWAYS DID LIKE RED HAIR.”
As for Miss Madam Electra Bunnynose, she
just filled up her tummy under her green dress

with pink and white coconut ice until it bulged
out like a little tiny girl's tummy and Maudie
sat and looked very tight about the mouth but
she didn't give "the look" or say anything—
which was good, really. And when Miss
Electra had eaten a whole front garden and a
gate her blue eyes glistened and her hair
shone redder than usual and she said in a
Page Thirty-three


THE MAGICAL HAT
rich coconutty voice:
"I FINK I’M GOING TO LOVE ALL GIANTS
and WITCHES BECAUSE THEY ARE SO KIND,"
Which made them all want to laugh and
cry at once (Yes! you can do that); and she
said: "I'm full up. Please carry me, dear Mr.
Kind Giant, and don't forget I want to go home
to my mummy."
So dear KIND GIANT gently and patiently
picked her up once again and tucked her away
in his right hand coat pocket and she fell
asleep straight away.
The little pink bird said, "WELL DONE.
YOU DESERVE TO FIND THE MAGIC HAT
FOR THAT LITTLE GIRL CAN BE VERY TRY-
ING AND YOU DIDN'T LOSE ME."
Then Maudie climbed up and hugged A
Page Thirty-four
KIND GIANT'S ear, because her arms were too
short to go round his neck. She told him how
much she loved him and as she told him a
sort of a swishy spell happened and they found
themselves standing in a gorgeous great big
cave—not dark like Elvira's, but full of a lovely
feeling and a soft blue light and it was just
honeycombed (ask Mummy the meaning) with
lots and lots of crooks and nannies—l mean
•
nooks and crannies.
"THIS MUST BE IT," whispered A KIND
GIANT, and, do you know it was the wonderful
Cave of the Lost Limbo. Of all the exciting
moments in their long journey this was the
very most exciting.
"Oh, doar. Can't we go right inside?"
wailed Electra. Even Maudie agreed with her


THE MAGICAL HAT
and so A KIND GIANT very carefully and very
stealthily took one small giant's step further
into the wonderful cave. You see he felt just
a bit awkward being a Giant and his small step
was exactly half a mile in humans' steps and
where do you think it landed them? Right in
the middle of this treeeeeemendously big cave
and it was so wonderful that it took all their
breath away for a minute and they just looked
and looked at all the strange things lying
around them. Books were stacked and piled
in huge heaps; the crooks and nannies were
full to overflowing with lost toys and parcels
and jewels and watches, dogs and cats and
everything people had lost—even babies! But
the funniest things of all were the army of lost
Umbrellas. You never saw so many and they
could talk and such a funny noise they made
that A KIND GIANT stopped feeling awkward
about being so large and he began to laugh
and shake and Maudie and Electro had to hang
on to his ears like anything to stop falling off.
"HO—HO—HO," he laughed.
"Well, I don't think it's funny. I want to go
h . . . ," started Miss Madam Electro Bunny-
nose and she began to cry, but nobody took
any notice of her and the lost Umbrellas went
on shouting at each other, so she decided to
stop and have a little explore instead. So she
slithered down A KIND GIANT'S back and
landed plop—legs in the air—on the top of a
huge pile of books right next to the tiniest,
weeniest, wrinkliest, most shriveldy-up old
man she had ever seen, with birdy-brown eyes

THE MAGICAL HAT
kicking through a mass of long white hair all
tied up in knots, like a hankie when its owner
wants to remember something. Oh! and his
beard too —all knots right down to his toes.
Electra just stayed still and stared—and stared
—until a sudden squeaky noise made her jump.
It was the little man's voice and he said
rather crossly: ' Stop, staring, young person.
Who are you? What do you want in my
cave and where have you come from?”
Poor Electra got a big fright and in a very
little girl's voice she said; "Please, Mr. Funny
Man, I'm Electra Bunnynose and want to know
what those knots are in your hair for?” And
she quaked as she said it, did Electra.
The tiniest,
weeniest, wrinkliest, most
old man."

"Mr. Funny Man, indeed,” he squeaked, "I'll

Page Thirty-seven


THE MAGICAL HAT
these knots are tied in my hair so that I won't
forget to remember all lost things come to this
Cave eventually. I enter them up in my book.
So I suppose you are lost too and your —er—
enormous friend?"
"Oh, no! Forget-me-knot. We aren't lost,
really, we aren't," said Electra. "We are
searching for the Magic Hat. Please, wait a
minute.”
Before you could say Algebra she had
climbed right up on to A KIND GIANT S
shoulder, next to Maudie, and was whispering
in his ear all about the little man and what he
had said. A KIND GIANT decided to knee
down so that he could see the little man too
and when he was on his knees and Maudie
was on the ground Miss Madam Electra Bunny-
Page Thirty-eight
nose said —feeling very important—"Dear Mr.
Forget-me-not, Esq. Allow me to introduce my
friend, Maudie, and her husband. A KIND
GIANT, who have come to find the Magic
Hat."
The old man put on his glasses and climbed
%
on to a page in a very large book and said:
"Howdedo, Folks; pleased to meet you"—and
wiped his pen on a very angry looking lost
Umbrella with a parrot's head, before he wrote
down their names and then he said: T guess
by now you know that I am the man who never
forgets. I know everything and everybody.
You three people have won the right to look
for your Magic Hat because you are kind and
because you can laugh—both these things help
to make others happy so I now grant you per-

mission to search my cave for your Hat and the
second last knot in my right forelock seems to
remind me that the Hat Department is—er—
let me see —the fifth turning to the right—
through the Lost Temper Department, next to
the Lost Appetites. And my advice to you is
to let the little earth girl with the red hair do
the searching as she is so small and so nimble
and can climb into the crooks and nannies like
a spider."
And lo and behold, in half a split second,
Miss Madam Electra Bunnynose had landed
right on top of A KIND GIANT S bewildered
head and had jumped from there into the nooky
comers of the Cave.
Maudie was secretly a bit jealous but she
was silly because she was too short-sighted to
Page Forty
find anything in a cave and A KIND GIANT
v/as altogether too big, so really Electra was
the right person to look for the hat, wasn t she?
"It looks like being a long performance," said
Maudie, in a resigned way—and it was —for
Maudie and A KIND GIANT waited no less
ihan three days, four hours and twenty-three
minutes while M.M.E.B.N. climbed and
crawled and searched into every twist and turn
of the cave. And at long last, when they had
almost given up hope and were having a little
tiny shut-eye, there was a wild shout and a
scream of joy and tiny feet prancing, skirts fly-
ing, red hair a-blowing and blue eyes a-twink-
ling, there stood—or rather jumped—Miss
Madam Electra Bunnynose Sausage Meat and
cn her head was THE MAGIC HAT.

Tiny feet prancing

"I've got it! I've got it!” she cried. "It
showed itself to me in a lovely green and
purpie light and it said: 'Little girl, put me on
your shining head'—and I did put it on and I
ran here to you and now PLEASE, PLEASE
can I go home to my dear mummy.”
Maudie and A KIND GIANT felt so happy
and thankful inside themselves that they said:
"YES, of course you can—in fact, you can wish
yourself home now because you are magic.”
''Can I suggest something,” squeaked For-
get-me-knot, Esq. "The little girl is entitled to
two Wishes. Let her now utter them.”
Electra stood quite still and in her sweet
little voice she cried;
"I WISH THAT ALL GIANTS AND WITCHES
SHALL BE KIND AND LOVE EACH OTHER—

And as she wished the hat flashed magical
lights and flew off her head on to Maudie's
and the little red-headed earth girl just van-
ished into thin air. So did the Cave and For-
get-me-not, Esq., and everything except Maudie
Page Forty-two
and A KIND GIANT, who were left. Maudie
had a brain wave and said: "Oh! dear, be-
fore we leave the Lost Limbo I wish the three
Walruses out of their spell,'' and it was a good
thing she remembered them beccruse they
turned out to be three of her second cousins
who were actually FG's. (Fairy Godmothers).
They were so grateful that they promised to
come and bestow good wishes at all family
christenings and there were lots for

and in no time they all had lots of kind little
babies —so did Maudie and A KIND GIANT—
and the three grateful EC's (Fairy Godmothers)
were kept very busy thinking out and bestow-
ing all sorts of nice wishes on the babies. As
for the Magic Hat—Maudie had it dry cleaned
