TO THE MEMORY OF E. C. CLOSE, ESQ.
Under a stone not far away
Lies the friend of the poor of a past gone day,
The father of the fatherless, and what’s more —-
The hungered with hunger ne’er went from
his door.
The widow oft times with confidence did seek
A tight little dwelling her children to keep.
The orphans he kept with a great deal of care,
With them the gifts of God he alw 7 ays did
share.
If to him for a piece of land you were due
The blast of the usurer from his mouth never
blew 7 .
Oft times his kindness has been greatly abused,
And w 7 hen others applied he has never refused.
Act a spot on his memory will ever appear,
—-Qn our fetebd- that’s departed beloved and
dear.
His hair was as w 7 hite as the snow on the hill,
His mind with good wishes for others did fill.
May those he has left to cherish his name
Inculcate those virtues and follow the same.
When you were amongst with a certainty too,
Tor counsel and kindness w 7 e all went to you,
But now 7 you have gone, wdiere a, Mend shall
w 7 e find
Tor virtue and w 7 orth your like is not left be-
hind.
You have gone from amongst us and lie w 7 ith
the dead,
An ill-w 7 ord of no one you never have said.
To the regions of bliss I’m sure you have gone.
By that line of conduct, that place you have
w 7 on,
In peace you may rest, you care not for the past,
Eor the duty of man you have performed to
71 it!
Morpeth, 17th September, 1866. J ’ WH ITE,
