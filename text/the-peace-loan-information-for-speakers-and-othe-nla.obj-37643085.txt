THE PEACE LOAN.
Statement by the Honorable A. Poynton, M.P.,
Acting Treasurer.
The War Loan expenditure of the Commonwealth is
estimated for the year ending 30th June, 1920, at
£52,000,000. On 30th June last the Treasury held war
loan moneys amounting to about £18,800,000. The differ-
ence between these sums must be found by way of loan,
and amounts to £33,200,000.
Towards meeting these requirements the Government
has decided to float another loan in Australia of £25,000,000,
which will appropriately be termed “ The Peace Loan.”
The nominal rate of interest will be 5 per cent, per annum,
but a bonus, to be given with the first interest payment,
will bring it up to 5| per cent, per annum on the average
for the whole period of the loan.
The principal will be repaid at par on 15th December,
1927.
Subscriptions to the Peace Loan will close on 23rd,
September next, and instalments will be payable as fol-
lows :—•
10 per cent, on application.
10 per cent, on 3rd November, 1919.
20 per cent, on 3rd December, 1919.
20 per cent, on 6th January, 1920.
20 per cent, on 4th February, 1920
20 per cent, on 4th March, 1920.


Interest will be subject to Commonwealth taxation,
but will be free of State income tax.
The loan will be offered to the public for voluntary
subscription, and the Government is hopeful that the
patriotism of the people and their resources will prove
to be sufficient for the purpose. The loan is for paying
expenses of actual war and for repatriation. The Govern-
ment believes feelings of relief, induced by a victorious
peace and sense of gratitude to the men who bore the heat
and burden of the day, will lead to a full subscription of
£25,000,000. If that amount be not obtained by voluntary
effort, it will be necessary to impose compulsion, and the
Government intends to take all steps necessary to bring
that about. In the event of compulsion, those who hold
no stock or bonds of War or Peace loans will be the first to be
called upon for subscriptions, and they will be subject
to a severe penalty, and still will be required to subscribe
to the loan.
There is at present before the House of Representatives
a Bill for obtaining compulsory subscriptions to war loans,
the maximum amount required in any financial year being
six times the average income tax paid by the individual
or company during the last three years. Persons whose
taxable incomes are £250 per annum or less are not subject
to the provisions of the Bill, and those who have served
with the Naval or Military Forces during the war are
exempt in so far as their incomes from personal exertion
are concerned. Under the Bill, compulsion will not apply
to any one if the £25,000,000 is obtained by voluntary sub-
scriptions, but in the event of a shortage the Treasurer


would require the Commissioner of Taxation to call for
additional subscriptions. An Appeal Board is provided
for which may consider any objections by the persons
from whom subscriptions may be demanded, and the Board
must take into account the amount, if any, invested by
the objector in previous war loans, or paid in the purchase
by him from the Commonwealth of war savings certificates.
Where any person is compelled to subscribe an amount
to the loan he will be automatically subject to a fine equal
to one-third of the amount of the compulsory subscription.
This fine will be paid to the Consolidated Eevenue, but
for the amount of his subscription he will get bonds or
stock.
When the loan closes the Government will bring before
Parliament any amendments necessary to deal with the
position then existing.
In order that facilities may be provided for persons
who have not ready money, the Government has again
arranged with the Australian banks that they will make
advances to customers at the rate of 4 per cent, per annum
to all persons who show that they have a reasonable
prospect of repaying the money within eighteen months.
The banks will advance up to 90 per cent, of the bonds
subscribed for, and will not ask for any security other than
that of the bonds themselves.
The Government is creating an organization similar
to that which was used for the last loan, and a Central
Committee has already been brought into being in each
of the State capitals. The Government confidently relies
upon the good work of these bodies.


I venture to hope that the loan, which is smaller than
either of the two previous flotations, will be fully sub-
scribed without resort to compulsion. I appeal to all
Australians to again show that the interests of the country
are vital to themselves as individuals and to once more
find the money necessary to meet the expenses of the
Great War, now happily ended.


THE PEACE LOAN.
The following further information will be useful to
Speakers and other Honorary Workers.
The people of Australia are now asked to subscribe
£25,000,000 to the Peace Loan. This money is required
to meet war and repatriation expenditure.
All persons should be induced to subscribe to the Peace
Loan to the full limit of their means. It is the duty of
all who have the interest of their country at heart to
assist.
Farmers and Graziers particularly should be approached
for substantial subscriptions. During the last twelve months
about £80,000,000 has been distributed amongst the
Primary Producers for proceeds of Wool, Wheat, Butter,
Metals, &c., and this has only been possible because of the
arrangements made by the Commonwealth Government
with the British Government for the purchase of these
commodities.
Every one who is in a position to subscribe even £lO
should be impressed with the necessity of assisting to
make the loan a complete success.
Every new subscriber means another person with a
direct monetary interest in the welfare of Australia and
in the successful repatriation of our soldiers.


The security for the Loan is Australia and all the wealth
of Australia.
The wealth of Australia in 1915 (the last figures avail-
able) as shown by the Government Statistician’s figures
based on the Wealth Census was £1,643,463,376, whilst
the annual income at that date was £257,650,251.
The amount of War Loans raised in Australia up to the
present is £193,689,974, the details of which are shown in
the following schedule.

WAR LOANS RAISED IN AUSTRALIA.
SUMMARY.


Previous Loans and the Present Effort.— ln America,
when the Liberty Loan was floated, and an organization
created to bring the Loan personally before every member
of the Public, one person in every six of the population
became a subscriber to the Loan, In Canada, where a
somewhat similar organization was created in connexion
with the last issue, one person in every nine subscribed.
In Australia the highest percentage which has been
obtained was in the case of the Seventh Loan, when one
person in every twenty of the population subscribed.
If we could bring our efforts and results up to those of
America and Canada, we should secure over 500,000 sub-
scribers to the present Loan. The fact that the percentage
of subscribers to our Loans has in the past been so small,
compared with America and Canada, clearly demonstrates
that the Australian Public has not yet fully realized the
position, and that the necessity and urgency of subscribing
to the Loans has not been brought personally under
the notice of every potential subscriber. The object of
the present campaign is to bring home to the Public the
fact that it is imperatively necessary for every person who
can subscribe to do so to the full extent of his or her
means.
Dates of Payment of Interest.— lnterest on the Peace
Loan is payable on 15th December and 15th June.
Interest on the Seventh War Loan is payable on 15th
September and 15th March, thus those who hold Stock or
Bonds in that Loan and subscribe to this one will receive
an interest payment every three months.
Subscriptions payable by Instalments.— Persons who have
not sufficient ready cash to pay up in full at date of appli-
cation can pay by instalments, £lO deposit being required


for every £IOO subscribed, and payment of the balance
being spread over five months, as set out in the Prospectus.
This should enable many to subscribe out of current
income, paying instalments as they fall due.
Though all the instalments will not be paid up until 4th
March, 1920, the subscriber will get interest amounting to
£4 ss. Od. for each £IOO, on 15th June, 1920. This
includes a bonus of such amount that, though the nominal
rate of interest is 5 per cent., the actual rate of interest
for the whole period of the loan will be £5 6s. Od. per cent,
per annum.
Fully Paid Applications. —On the other hand, some
may have accumulated money in hand awaiting invest-
ment, and to meet these it has been provided that they
may pay up the full amount of their subscriptions at
once. In such cases interest amounting to £2 15s. for
each £IOO, will be paid by the Commonwealth on 15th
December, 1919, though the Government will then have
had the money for only three months. The bonus of
interest is such that the actual rate of interest will be
£5 4s. lOd. per cent, per annum for the whole period of the
loan.
Interest free of State Income Tax. —The interest is
subject to Commonwealth taxation, but is free of State
Income Tax. The freedom from State Income Tax is a
very valuable concession.
Safe Custody of Bonds. —Any Bank or Savings Bank
will hold Bonds for safe custody free of cost, and will
either credit the interest half-yearly to a Banking
Account or forward it to any address, so that there is
no risk or trouble to the owner.


Application Forms. —A form of application must be
filled in by each person subscribing to the Loan. These
forms may be obtained from any Bank, Post Office, or
Local Loan Committee, or from an Authorized Agent.
The application form when completed should be lodged
Avith a Bank, Savings Bank or Money Order Office, with
the money payable thereon. If the subscriber is unable
personally to lodge the application and the money, they
can be sent by post.
Conversion Applications. —Holders of Stock or Bonds
in any previous CommonAvealth War Loans who may
Avish to convert their holdings into the present issue, can
do so if they subscribe a similar amount of neAv money
to the present Loan.
For example, a holder of £SOO of Bonds in the 4J per
cent. War Loan, 1925, can exchange them for Bonds in
the present issue if he lodges a cash application for a
further £SOO of Bonds or Stock. This cash application
may be on the instalment basis or fully paid, as may be
convenient to the subscriber.
War Savings Certificates will be accepted in payment
of the deposit and instalments of the Peace Loan up to
a maximum of half of the amount applied for. For this
purpose the three years Certificates Avill be accepted at
the purchase price together with simple interest at 4|
per cent, per annum from the date of each Certificate
to the due date of the deposit or instalment as the case
may be.
Five years or ten years Certificates will be accepted
at the purchase price together with simple interest at


5 per cent, per annum from tlie date of each Certificate
to the due date of the deposit or instalments as the case
may be.
War Savings Certificates will be converted only at
branches of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia,
What Commonwealth Loans Are.— There is reason to
believe that lack of information regarding the nature of
investments in Government securities has deterred many
persons from subscribing to previous War Loans. It is
advisable, therefore, to set out in simple form what the
Loans really are.
In times of peace, Nations raise by taxation the money
which is required to meet the cost of Government. The
expenses of War are so great, however, that no Nation
can meet them by only collecting taxes. Nations must
therefore borrow money when War comes. This is the
position of Australia to-day.
Those who put money into the Loan get, at their option,
either Treasury Bonds or Inscribed Stock.
Treasury Bonds. —A Treasury Bond is a promise by the
Treasury of the Commonwealth to pay to the bearer a
sum of money at a fixed future time, which in the present
case is 15th December, 1927, Bonds are for £lO, £SO,
£IOO, £SOO, and £I,OOO. Attached to the Bond are
Coupons for the interest, one for each half-year in the
period, up to December, 1927. At the end of each half-
year, the coupon for that half-year should be cut off and
presented for payment at any Bank or Savings Bank.
The Coupons are payable to bearer, and will be paid free of
exchange. If the Bonds are held for safe custody by a
Bank the interest will be paid to credit of a Bank account


or posted to any address, according to the instructions
which the person owning the Bonds may give to the
Bank.
At date of maturity the Bonds are repayable at the
Commonwealth Bank of Australia, at Melbourne, Sydney,
Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth or Hobart, for the full amount
which was originally put into the Loan, free .of exchange.
Inscribed Stock. —For those who can invest £IOO or
more, there are two forms of investment, namely —the
Treasury Bonds, which have already been described, and
Inscribed Stock. In other words, instead of an actual
Bond being issued the amount is “ Inscribed ” in the name
of the applicant in the books of the Inscription Registry,
which are kept at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia.
When so entered, the entry is the evidence of the claim
which the purchaser has upon the Government, just as a
Bank’s ledger shows what amount of money is due to
any depositor of the Bank. A Certificate can be obtained,
if required, verifying the amount. When the purchaser
pays for the Stock he is given a receipt for his money,
which, if lost, would be of no value to the finder. In
this way the investor is relieved of the trouble and risk
of keeping a document which is payable to bearer. Should
he sell his Stock, the transfer to the new owner may be
made by signing a transfer form and by registering the
transfer at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia.
Interest on the Stock is sent every half-year by the
Commonwealth Bank of Australia to the owner of the
Stock, or is paid to credit of a Banking Account as the
owner mav instruct. No exchange is payable on the
interest.


Sale of Bonds and Stock —Every lender will be
entitled to receive his money back on 15th December,
1927. Should he desire to have his money at any earlier
time it will be quite easy for him to sell his bonds on the
Stock Exchange at the market price of the day.
Any Bank or Stockbroker will do all that is necessary
in the sale of bonds, and there is no difficulty or trouble
on the part of the owner. A charge is made for broker’s
commission, but this is trifling. Indeed, there is no other
property which may be so promptly and so cheaply con-
verted into ready cash as bonds.
Organization.—Local Committees. —As on the occasion of
the Seventh War Loan, special steps are being taken to
thoroughly arouse public interest in the Peace Loan.
A Central Loan Committee, consisting of leading
Financial and Business men, has been formed in each
State. These Central Committees have the general
management of the Loan campaign in the respective
States.
In each country town and district, a local committee
of prominent and enterprising residents will be formed.
These local committees will do everything possible to
bring the loan under the notice of the people.
The total amount of the Loan —£25,000,000 —has been
apportioned amongst the States. The State totals have
been further distributed amongst the different towns and
districts so that each town or district has a quota which
should be subscribed to insure the success of the
Loan.
