The announcement that the Australians are
on the eve of sending one more Expedition in
search of some tidings of the long-lost party
of Ludwig Leichhardt is evidence of the ex-
tent to which this mystery of the Antipodes
has affected the imagination of our fellow-
jountrymen in the Far South. It is their one
romance, and they make much of it. More
than forty-two years have*passed since the
German explorer entered the Queensland
bush, never to return. Party after party has
set out in search of him, and again and again
reports have reached the settlements of bush-
men having come upon traces believed to be
those of the vanished pioneer. Huts thought to
be his have been seen, and in the recently
published report of the first meeting of the
Australasian Association for the Advancement
of Science there is a Paper by Mr. Panton,
in which it is argued that the camp dis-
covered by Gregory on the Elsey Creek,
during his overland explorations from Victoria
River to the Eastern Colonies in 1856, could
have been constructed by no other white men
than those of Leichhardt’s party. Romantic
tales of white-haired Europeans having been
noticed among the Aborigines attracted atten-
tion at frequent intervals, though when one
remembers the number of convicts who, in the
old times, took refuge among the natives, and
found it convenient to shake the dust of civilisa-
tion from their feet, the rumours cannot be re-
garded as proof of much. Initials cut on trees
were often seen. But, like the bottles containing
# 7 O
facetious records of the Franklin Expedition,
the “ L. L.’s ” inscribed on blue gum bark grew
so plentiful that it became evident that even if
Ludwig Leichhardt had spent the whole of
his time in carving these rustic records of his
progress, his brief career would have been all too
short for the task. Theories regarding his fate—
of every shade of ingenuity, probability, and
absurdity—were so numerous that for a stock-
man or a boundary rider on the Darling Downs
or the Riverina not to have a private, special,
and particular dogma on the subject was as rare
as it is to find an elderly Englishman without
views on the authorship of the Letters of
Junius, or a member of the Academy of In-
scriptions who is not perfectly confident as
to the identity of the Man in the Iron
Mask. Friends fell out over “ Leichhardt’s
fate,” and enemies made it up by agreeing
in the main concerning his latter end. “He
was killed by the natives ” —so ran one
theory—as were Cunningham on the Bogan
River, and Kennedy on the Peninsula of Cape
York. Or, like Burke and Wills in the Barcoo
Wilderness, he perished of hunger and thirst.
But the answer to both of these opinions is,
that net a scrap of his equipment has been found,
that not a whisper regarding the tragedy of
i which he was a victim has ever reached the homes
of civilised men, though most of the country
over which he travelled has been settled within
the last twenty or thirty years. A more con-
clusive hypothesis was that his camp had been
surprised by a bush fire and annihilated, while
another theory, equally possible, is that the
entire party of which he was leader was over-
whelmed by one of those sudden floods for
which many parts of the interior of Australia
are notorious.
But the many surmises have led to no more
tangible information regarding the fate of
the Prussian pioneer than did the search Expedi-
tions of Hovenden Heiy in 1852, of Augustus
Gregory in 1855 and 1858, of Duncan
M ‘lntyre in 1865, of John Forrest in 1867
and 1870, or of others organised on a less
extensive scale. From the hour when —on the
26th of February, 1848 —he wrote his last
letter from Canning Downs, to the effect that
he and his seven companions were starting for
the Gulf of Carpentaria, no scrap of informa-
tion worthy of the name has ever been received
of any one member of the party. They passed
out of the Ren of Christian men, and have
ever since been as if they had never existed.
However, about fifteen years ago a “ ne’er-do-
weel ” named Andrew Hume happened to be
lying fast by the heels in Paramatta Gaol. This
man was Known to have wandered extensively in
the interior, and to be intimately acquainted
with the habits of aboriginal tribes little, if
at all, familiar to the Whites. In the course of
his talks with the prison officials he affirmed
that during his wanderings he had met
with Hen Classen, Leichhardt’s brother-in-
law and one of his party. Classen’s story was
that Leichhardt’s men fell upon their
leader, and, after nearly killing him, deserted
with the whole equipment. The explorer soon
afterwards died, and Classen had voluntarily
remained ever since with the natives, nor had
he any intention of returning to civilisation.
The tale was in itself extremely improbable.
For it did not explain why Classen, an educated
man, with brilliant prospects, should choose
such a lot, or why he had never tried to send
| any message to the settlements, or how none of
the deserters or their stolen equipment had ever
been detected by some of the many eager eyes
on the outlook. Classen, it was nevertheless
declared by Hume, had carefully preserved the
journals and instruments of the Expedition,
though why he should be so careful of
these and so indifferent in other respects
seemed inexplicable. However, so undying
is the interest of the Australians in their
one great mystery, that when Hume offered
to bring back Classen, provided he was fur-
nished with a party sufficiently powerful to
capture the recalcitrant German, all the assis-
tance he required was given him. Then he set off,
and was not heard of for years, until he
returned, declaring that his escort getting “ dis-
organised,” he had entered the service of the
overland telegraph party, and remained with
them, caring nothing for the anxiety which his
absence must have caused to the enthusiastic
friends of Leichhardt, who had despatched him
on so bootless an errand. Still, belief in his
tale was unshaken enough to enable funds for
a second outfit to be provided. This party, like
the first, soon fell to pieces, and, after a series
of heavy drinking bouts, all except Hume
retraced their steps. Then, after a time, it was
reported that he also had died, and that his
body was found beside his horse close to an out-
lying stock run.
The interest in Classen did not abate, and a I
man named Skulthorpe was despatched to
follow up the traces which Hume was still be-
lieved to have found. But by this time Classen,
it appeared, was dead, and the only material
evidences of bis existence that remained were
two mahogany-coloured pledges of his affection
for a savage spouse. At a later date Skulthorpe
circulated a startling tale to the effect that he
had not only found. the grave of Leichhardt,
but had recovered the diary of his last Expedi-
tion. This was news indeed, and for a time
Sydney was intensely excited. The bushman,
however, tarried long on his journey, halting at
this wayside tavern for a leisurely debauch with
his admirers, and at that bush town to expostu-
late with the local editor who had ventured to give
expression to public opinion touching Mr. Skul-
thorpe’s veracity. He was even said to have
shown the box in which the journals were con-
tained. But he never exhibited the journals,
and so this story, like so many others, passed
into the limbo of unsubstantiality. Yet the
Leichhardt legends have not ceased to attract
the Australians, and now “ a well-known
and daring bushman,” named MThee, is
equipping an Expedition, the object of which is
to obtain tidings about a white man who, he
has learned, is living among the Blacks at some
distance in the interior. This renegade, he
concludes, “must be a survivor of Leichhardt’s
party,” though, from the circumstances already
mentioned, it is very likely that, even did
such a personage exist, he would prove to be
some very ordinary vagabond. However, as
the raison d'etre of another search, there is
no reason why the story should not be
accepted. For, if there is no white man, or
if the white man is neither Hentig, nor
Classen, nor Donald, nor Stuart, nor Kelly
—who, with two Blacks, were the personnel of
the Leichhardt party —some information re-
garding the country traversed will, incidentally
at least, be brought back by MThee.
The chances are, nevertheless, all against any
remnants of the Expedition being now in exis-
tence. The region, which was unknown when the
young Berlin Doctor started on his third journey
of exploration, is now either settled, or, for all
geographical purposes, fairly examined. Ac-
cordingly, even were his journals recovered, they
would be of little more than historical value.
They would naturally contain no exact informa-
tion regarding his fate. It is idle to imagine
that he pan be still alive. For, if he could not
have escaped from the Aborigines long ere this,
the latter would have found it more lucrative to
convey him to the nearest settlement than to
retain him. And the same may be said regard-
ing his men. Admitting that the story told to
Hume by the supposititious Classen was true,
experienced bushmen such as they were could
easily have found their way back. But as none
of the natives have ever heard of Leichhardt’s
murder, or come upon any traces of him, the
probabilities are all in favour of the unfortunate
Expedition having perished, the exact manner of
their taking off remaining for ever among the
mysteries of the Southern Continent,

Skins.—At these sales 106,290 Cape goat and Angora skins
were offered, and 97,492 sold. The market was very strong,
and values were materially advanced. Goat skins rose about
15 per cent, on average, and the various weights compared
with July rates show the following changes, viz.:—“ Bests,*
which have been very abundant, are the same; “ seconds” are
lid. to Hd. per lb. higher; “best smalls” show an average
improvement of 2d.; and “ second smalls ” are id. to id.
dearer. The improvement in dry damaged skins ranges from
2d. to 4d. per lb. The advance was most marked on Kaffir
descriptions. Angora skins rose 15 per cent, on average, the
various classes being dearer to the following extent, viz.:—
"Bests” and “seconds,” lid.; “best smalls,’ id.; “second

COTTON.—MANCHESTER, Sept. 4.— Yarns were quiet, and
only a small trade was transacted. The tone was about
steady, and buyers would not purchase freely except at lower
prices. Cloth was in moderate request. Manufacturers main-
tained quotations unchanged, aud therefore could not do
much business.
WOOL AND WORSTED—BRADFORD, Sept. 4 —The wool
market is rather quiet to-day, though it is reported there is,
if anything, rather more inquiry in English wool, and more
business is doing by spinners both for lustre and demi-lustre
wools. Efforts are made by staplers to obtain a fraction ad-
vance in price, but without success. The position of staplers
is one of difficulty; they have stocks of wool which are bought
at prices which are regarded as too high for this market, and
make vain efforts to obtain remunerative prices. Mohair and
alpaca are firm in price. A better tone prevails in reference
to some classes of wool aud tops. Merino tops, for
example, command better prices. In the yarn market
there is rather more activity. Orders have been
more freely placed in some classes of yarns, including twofold
and super 46 s and for weft and tube sorts. Spinners main-
tain prices with firmness. Mohair in thick numbers are in
fair request. Botany yarns are slow of sale but steady in price.
The piece market is without improvement. A steady business
is doing in fabrics for the Home market, but for other quarters
the languor continues The tone is one of confidence.
