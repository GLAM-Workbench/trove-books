Cinderella?s Party
ONE sunny day of early spring, Ellie was seated in her favourite seat, an old gum-tree
stump right at the bottom of the back garden. The peach and apricot trees were in
flower, and a little plum tree, starred all over with delicate blossoms, looked like a
fairy bride ;or so Elbe?s mother thought, and Ellie thought so too. A large wattle shook
its golden plumes in the light breeze; and it was under this tree that Ellie was sitting. She
always thought this the nicest place in which to read fairy stories ; and to-day she was mak-
ing the acquaintance of her old favourites under a new guise, for it was her birthday, and
she had been given a wonderful book full of the loveliest pictures you ever saw. It was the
gift of a friend of her mother?s girlhood, now a very important lady, who always remembered
her at this time. Ellie knew that her parents could not have afforded to buy such an
expensive book ; and that made it all the more exciting. Her mother?s birthday gifts to her
were a pretty new pair of strap shoes and a broad blue hair-ribbon ; and she was wearing
both with great pleasure, though she could not help wishing that she had a nice new dress
as well. But if her simple dress made by her mother?s clever fingers was not new, it was
neat and tresh; and her golden hair was well-brushed and glossy. Altogether she looked the
kind of little girl of whom one would like to know more.
She was turning over the pages of the book before deciding which story to read ; and
while she turned the pages she sang a little fairy song her mother had taught her.
Fairy bells ring sweet and clear.
Fairy flowers are blowing,
Here among the fairy bowers
Is no mortal sadness ;
Fairy voices greet the ear,
Fairy streams are flowing.
Songs of bells and brooks and flowers
Wake my heart to gladness.


Her attention was arrested by a picture of Cinderella and her Fairy Godmother.
There was the Fairy Godmother in a laced velvet bodice, with wide skirts, and a high
pointed hat with a peacock?s feather in the front, and carrying a bag with ? Godmother?s
Magic Bag? written on it. And there was Cinderella, in the most dreadful rags, but
looking just the sweetest thing.
?Oh, I?ll read that one? she said to herself,
and began to read. ?Once upon a time ?all the best
ones start that way? ?She was just getting nicely
into the story when she heard a voice calling ? Elbe,
where are you?? It was Arabella Brown, one of the
children who lived next door, and Elbe was not in the
mood for her ; so she said ? Bother! ? but not loudly
enough for Arabella to hear.
? I couldn?t think where you could be,? said
Arabella. ? I want you to come to the Pictures with
Alice and me, and your mother says you can if you
like.? Of course she ought to have said ?You may if
you like,? but she didn?t know any better. She was
quite a nice little thing; but she looked as if her mother
had not clever lingers to make her clothes, but
bought them straight out of shops. Elbe?s mother
thought her a little bit overdressed. She had a
pretty face though her expression was somewhat
petulent; and she was as dark as Elbe was fair.
?No, thank you, Bella, I don?t feel inclined to
go to the Pictures to-day,? answered Elbe.
Once upon a time ?
? Not inclined to go to the Pictures?? echoed Bella, ? Why, it?s Mary Pickford.?
I don?t mind if it is. Pd rather see the pictures of Cinderella, and read about her.?
? Cinderella, who?s she ? ?
Elbe jumped to her feet. She was quite scandalised.
? Arabella Brown, do you mean to tell me you don?t know who Cinderella is ? Why,
she?s most important.?
? Oh, you mean fairy tales,? replied Arabella scornfully. ?My mother says there
aren?t any fairies.?
? Web, my mother says there are, and she knows, because she often saw them when
she was little. And she says it?s better to be loved by the fairies than to have lots and lots
of money.?


? Well, I?d rather have lots and lots of money. See all the nice things you could
buy. I?ve got an aunt who?s very rich and has a big house and a motor car.?
Elbe was not at all abashed by this splendour. She
replied coolly, ? I have a much better relation than that.?
? Tell me
who it is, and then I?ll believe you,? retorted
Arabella.
?I have
?a Fairy Godmother,? said Ellie mysteriously.
Arabella had just answered, ? you haven?t ?there?s no
such thing ?my mother says there isn?t,? when a call was heard
from the neighbouring garden. ? There?s Alice calling me,? she
exclaimed. She looked at Ellie to see if she showed any signs
of wavering in her determination not to go to the Pictures, but see-
ing none she said ? You are nasty not to come,? and walked
slowly away. After she had gone a few paces she turned round
and asked : ? How do you know you have a Fairy Godmother,
Ellie??
? Because I know I have,? returned Ellie, with great
decision. And Bella waited for no more
? That?s the only way to answer some people,? said Ellie
to herself. ? Now I hope I shall be left in peace.?
Arabella
She settled herself comfortably on her seat again, and went on with her story. She
had just come to the part where Cinderella dances with the Prince at the ball, when an
extraordinary thing happened. She had gradually become aware that the air was full of
sweet distant music ; but she was fully roused to the consciousness of some strange happen-
ing by the sound of wooden heels tap-tapping along the path to her retreat. She turned
round quickly, and what she saw made her rub her eyes with astonishment, for there before
her stood Cinderella?s Fairy Godmother, with her laced bodice and wide skirt, and her tall
pointed hat with the peacock?s feather, just as if she had stepped straight out of the book.
And there was her star tipped wand, and she was pointing it straight at Ellie.
? So you know you have a Fairy Godmother, do you ? ? said this strange visitor.
Ellie stood up quickly, and having stood up she took a step or two backward, but
all she found to say was ? Oh ! ?
? That?s just like a child. One would think I was a ghost instead of a Fairy God-
mother,? said the old lady.
Oh, are you really ? said Ellie, pinching her arm. ?Oh yes, you must be real ?I
pinched myself and it hurt, so I must be awake.?


Ha, ha, ha,
Ha, ha, ha,
Here I be,
Well you see,
Wherever I go they?ve heard of me.
I?m full of mischief as can be.
Ha, ha, ha,
Ha, ha, ha,
I am Puck,
Have no care,
Treat me well, I?ll bring good luck.
Be my friend and I?ll play fair.
Ha, ha, ha,
Ha, ha, ha,
Put on side,
Here I be,
I?ll show you up and dash your pride.
Wherever I go they?ve heard of me.
Ha, ha, ha,
Ha, ha, ha,
Talk too big,
I am Puck,
I?ll see you get a wholesome dig.
Treat me well, I?ll bring good luck.
?Of course, I was sure inside that I had a Fairy Godmother, but Arabella says there
is no such thing.?
? Tut, tut, this is high treason,? said the Fairy Godmother. ? Little girls didn?t say
such things in my young days. That child will never see a fairy as long as she lives, unless
she mends her ways. But we must not waste time in talking. It?s just about the time for
the party to begin.?
? The party ! Is there going to be a party, Fairy Godmother ?
? Why, of course.?
? And am I going to it ? ?
? No, it?s coming to you.?
?And I haven?t a new frock. Whatever shall Ido i ?
? Stop talking, child. There?s hardly time to dress you.? She whisked off Elbe?s
frock, revealing a lovely blue spangly dress, and placed Elbe?s frock in the bag she carried ?
the same magic bag that Elbe had seen in the picture.
? Oh, how lovely ! ? exclaimed Elbe. ? Why, I?m Cinderella.?
?Of course you are Cinderella,? answered the Fairy Godmother. ? Every little girl
who loves the fairies is Cinderella. And if she loves them very much the fairies arrange a
party for her, and they bring a little bit of fairyland with them. See how pretty it is.?
Elbe looked and looked again in the greatest astonishment, for all the familiar
things ?house and garden, fence and wattle ?had disappeared, and she saw round her a
wide landscape with curious trees and grass and bowers, and curious clouds in the sky.
She had never seen anything like it before, but it was all very, very beautiful as fairy scenes
always are. Before she had recovered breath to express her delight she had another surprise.
A little bgure clad in a black and white suit with chess-board-pattern trimmings came
capering in. He seemed to be bubbling over with merriment, and he turned some Catherine
wheels just for the fun of it. He seemed not to notice Cinderella and the Fairy Godmother.
When he had bnished turning Catherine wheels he began to caper about again ; and as he
capered about he sang this song :


A ftuw - i ii, ' /-fill n t \ 9\fjl I f t
&?-???: ':~~a�*&!S3SSis
? Here is Cinderella's daylight dress ?




? How now, sirrah,? said the Fairy Godmother, when he had finished his song.
? What message do you bring ? ?
Puck ran quickly forward, and bowed low to Cinderella and the Fairy Godmother.
?I beg to announce, Godmother, that the fairies will be here in the twinkling of a dewdrop.?
?It is well,? said the Fairy Godmother. ? Now here is Cinderella?s daylight dress
in this bag. Put it in a safe place. And remember, Cinderella, you must be back in your
daylight dress before the clock strikes 12, fairyland time, or something dreadful will happen.?
?But how am I to know when it?s going to be twelve o?clock fairyland time ? ? asked
Cinderella, as we must now call her.
?Well, you?d better ask one of the Nursery Rhymes people to remind you. Perhaps
the Mouse that ran up and down the Clock will be there, and he ought to know
something about the time. But here come the fairies.? And here indeed were the
fairies, lovelier than F1 lie could ever have imagined them in their dresses of filmy
gossamer, shot with moon-rays or rainbow lights or a thousand other lovely hues. And
they danced as lightly as foam caps ride on the waves.
How lovely they are,? she cried. ? And how beautifully they dance.?
?You must dance too,? said the Fairy Godmother.
? I don?t know how to,? said Elbe mournfully.
You see she had forgotten for the moment that she was Cinderella.
? Not know how to dance,? echoed the Fairy Godmother, quite shocked. ? Tut, tut,
we?ll soon mend that.?
She waved her wand, saying ? Now you can dance, I?ll warrant.? And Ellie?s feet
began to dance of themselves, and carried her into the midst of the fairy revels. Her
heart beat fast with joy, and she knew that she was really Cinderella.


Then the fairies sang,
Fairies, fairies, in ferny grot? we dwell,
Fairies, fairies, our home each flowery dell.
We come to dance, so lightly, sprightly gay,
And give Cinderella a happy holiday.
Fairies, fairies, we make the children bright,
Fairies, fairies, we make their tasks grow light.
We give them wings to fly with us away,
Or come to give them a happy holiday.
? Thank you very much for coming,? said
Cinderella. ? And thank you most of all Fairy
Godmother. But who are all these others ? ?
? Oh, these are the Nursery Rhymes people,?
answered the Fairy Godmother, as a number of
little folk tripped in. And Elbe could see that they
were. There were 80-peep, Boy Blue, Jack Hor-
ner, Humpty-Dumpty, Miss Muffit, Mary Ouite
Contrary and others. She knew them from their
pictures.
? Our home each flowery dell "
? Oh, the darlings ! ? she cried. ? I?d like to hug them all.?
Then the Nursery Rhymes folk sang their little song. It is the custom at a fairy
party for the visitors to sing a song about themselves. And a very pleasant custom it is.
Oh, we are the folk of the Nursery Rhymes,
And we merrily come with right good will.
We have pleased you often in olden times,
And we very much hope to please you still.
Miss Muffit, 80-Peep of the Nursery Rhymes,
Humpty-Dumpty and Little Boy Blue.
Jack Horner you knew in the olden times,
And Simple Simon and Mother Hubbard too.
Oh, we are the folk of the Nursery Rhymes,
Who merrily come to see you here.
You loved us dearly in olden times,
Please say your hearts still hold us dear.
? A very nice little song, my dears,? said the Fairy Godmother. ? Come now, and
tell Cinderella who you are.?
? Oh, I can recognise most of them,? said Cinderella.
Little Boy Blue was the hrst to step forward. He wore a well-patched little blue
suit, and he carried a tin horn.

I'm little Miss Muffet, and this is my Spider. He?s quite a pet non'?




I?m Little Boy Blue, and here is my horn,
The sheep?s in the meadow, the cow?s in the corn,
How naughty they are so far to roam,
I?ll blow my horn, and they?ll all come home
He blew a good blast on his tin horn.
?Boy Blue,? said 80-Peep, a shepherdess in a pretty pink-
dress trimmed with lamb?s wool. ? Have you seen anything of
my sheep ? I can?t tell where to find them.??
? I?ll blow my horn again,? answered Boy Blue, ? and
perhaps they?ll come home with mine.? And again he blew a
blast on his horn.
? I?m so afraid they?ll leave their tails behind them,?
lamented 80-Peep. ? They?ve done it before.?
? Why, who?s this ? ? said Cinderella, as a little girl in a
Kate Greenaway frock and mob cap came forward.
? Oh, I?m little Miss Muffit, and this is my Spider. I?m
not at all afraid of him. You see he?s quite a pet now. I have
qVL made a new Nursery Rhyme about us.?
Little Miss Muffit who sat on a tuffet,
Her terror does quite forget,
For now the great Spider walks gently beside her,
And she calls him her dear little pet.
? He blew a good blast ?
?No wonder Cinderella didn't know you,? remarked the Fairy Godmother. ? You
used to be such a timid little thing. Oh, here is Mary Quite Contrary.?
? Yes, but I?m not contrary now, or only a little bit,? replied Mary archly. Her
dainty sprigged gown was bordered with bells and flowers.
?It doesn?t do to agree with everyone,? said the Fairy Godmother. ? Ah, here we
have a pretty pair.?
? I?m Jack Horner,? said a small boy, who carried a large pie.
?I know you well,? answered the Fairy Godmother. ?A conceited young Jackanapes,
with a fondness for pie.?
?And Pm Simple Simon,? said a lanky long-haired youth with a vacant air.
? And as simple as ever, I see,? retorted the Fairy Godmother.
? Ah, Mother Hubbard,? she continued. ? How?s the poor dog to-day ? ?
? He?s low in the feelings, Ma?am, on account of the scarcity of bones,? replied an
old lady in a poke bonnet and plaid shawl.
? But who are all the rest of them ? ? asked Cinderella.
? Oh, they belong to the Old Woman who lives in a Shoe. She?s at home minding
the rest.?


? What a lot she must have ! ? cried Cinderella in astonishment.
The children of the Old Woman who lived in a Shoe came forward and stood in a
row. They varied in sizes from a tall girl of about twelve to the tiniest toddler. Their
dresses, though nice, were all different ?for the Old Woman, having so many to clothe,
used to make them of samples, and some of them were a trifle skimpy. Still, all things
considered, she did very well.
Thank you for asking us, How do you do ?
We are so happy, and happy are you.
We are the children, not all but a few,
Of the Old Woman who lives in a Shoe.
Naughty we?re not as you may have been told,
But we will try to be all good as gold,
The bad ones, on purpose, got colds in the head.
All were whipped soundly and sent off to bed.
? Don?t tell tales," said the Fairy Godmother. ? I rather like the bad ones myself.?
? But here,? she added, ? come some of the Fairy Tale people."
Cinderella could recognise Red Riding Hood at a glance. She herself had worn just
such a cloak with a hood to it when she was a year or two younger. She was getting so
used to extraordinary happenings that she felt not the least fear of a large shaggy beast
which accompanied her new visitor, though it was none other than the wolf. How often she
had imagined she saw his big cruel teeth, and heard him say in his gruff voice, ? The better
to eat you with, my dear." And here he was walking beside Red Riding Hood like a nice
tame dog.
I'm so sorry, Godmother," said Red Riding
Hood. ? Most of the Fairy Tale people were out
when your message came ; but we left word for
them. We tried to persuade Puss in Boots to
come ; but he said he had good hunting elsewhere.
And the Ugly Duckling wouldn?t stir a feather. I
brought my Wolf, though. See how tame he is.
He eats out of my hand now.?
Is that the Wolf that ate your Grand-
mother ? ? asked Cinderella in a shocked tone.
? Yes, my poor, poor Grandmother,? said Red
Riding Hood, beginning to cry.
Puck, who was a great mimic, pretended to
cry also, wiping his eyes with his fingers from
which he shook imaginary tears. ?My poor, poor
Grandmother,? he wailed.
Red Riding Hood relieved his feelings by scold-
ing the Wolf. ?It was very unkind of you to eat
my Grandmother,? she said. ? Don?t you ever do
such a thing again.? And that made Cinderella
laugh.
Red Riding Hood


? Here?s a lordly gentleman,? said the Fairy Godmother. And she might well say
so. He was a portly little man, dressed in a rusty suit of armour. He wore a large
turnip on a fob ; and a long scabbard hung at his side.
Oh, I?m Seven-at-a-Blow, at your service,? answered the little man with an
important air. He puffed out his chest, and began to sing in a booming voice?
Godmother
? I'm game to fight with
every foe ?
Then the fairies sang this song ?
It happened, you know,
So very long ago,
The two little children were fair and good.
Don?t you remember,
Don?t you remember,
Don?t you remember the babes in the wood.
They wandered for hours
Picking woodland flowers,
These two little children so fair and good.
Don?t you remember,
Don?t you remember,
Don?t you remember the babes in the wood.
Oh, I am Seven-at-a-Blow, Oh, I am Seven-at-a-Blow,
I?m game to fight with every foe, My thoughts are lofty as you know,
I am a mighty warrior, you know, For I look down upon the low,
For I killed seven at a blow. And I killed seven at a blow.
? Oh, Seven-at-a-Blow,? cried Cinderella. ? I see that
you have a watch.?
Seven-at-a-Blow held out his turnip in a lordly manner.
A family heirloom,? he remarked.
? Please would you mind telling me when it?s five minutes
midnight, fairyland time. It?s most important,? said
before midnight,
Cinderella.
Blow bowed in his lordly manner. ? You
, Cinderella,? he replied.
Seven-at-a
may rely upon me,
? Here are
the Babes in the Wood,? said the Fairy
lovely little darlings,? exclaimed Cinderella.
? Oh, what
? The fairies shall sing you a song about them,? said the
Fairy Godmother. ? They always know about anything that
happens in a wood.?
When after the light
Came the cold, cold night,
Then perished those children so fair and good.
Don?t you remember,
Don?t you remember,
Don?t you remember the babes in the wood.
The robins in grief
With many and many a leaf
Did cover those children so fair and good.
Don?t you remember,
Don?t you remember,
Don?t you remember the babes in the wood.


Cinderella had felt almost ready to cry while the song was being sung; but, seeing
that the babes looked none the worse for their sad experience, she began to smile again.
At this moment Puck appeared, bringing forward Humpty-Dumpty, a small boy
with a thin little body and an enormous egg shaped head, on the top of which was perched
a tiny cricketing cap. He had bumped his head badly, and was holding his hand to the
sore place.
? Here?s Humpty-Dumpty,? said Puck. ? He?s been sitting on the wall again, and
he came down an awful bump.?
? Pride comes before a fall,? said the Fairy Godmother.
? That?s what my old grandmother used to say,? agreed Humpty-Dumpty.
sing you the song I made about her.?
When I was a lad, ah, happy day,
My dear old grandmother used to say,
? Take care lest you with pride be cursed,
Like the Frog that swelled until he burst.
Pride comes before a fall,
Humpty Dumpty, beware of the wall.?
I used to ask her if she couldn?t
Say something different, but she wouldn?t.
? Take care through pride you don?t fall in,
Like the Hare that let the Tortoise win.
Pride comes before a fall,
Humpty Dumpty, beware of the wall.?
It seemed that Puck had taken upon himself the position of master of ceremonies,
for he came forward again leading a sleepy-looking little boy in pyjamas with a fool?s cap
on his head.
? Here?s Sleepy Head,? he said. ?He can go to sleep standing up.?
? Sleepy Head?s always going to sleep,? said the Fairy Godmother. ?He belongs
to the Sluggard family. The Lie-abeds and Sleepy Heads are closely related. You had
better duck him in the pond, Puck. That will wake him up.?
? Oh, please, Godmother, don?t punish Sleepy Head,? pleaded Cinderella. ?It
would spoil the party.?
? Very well, we will let him off this time, on condition that he sings us the Sluggard?s
Family Song,? said the Fairy Godmother.
So Sleepy Head began to sing in a very drowsy voice :
?Tis the voice of the Sluggard as feebly he wept,
You have waked me too soon, I declare I?ve not slept
Instead of uprising I?d rather stay here,
And sleep from the start till the close of the year.
For what use to get up when the morning is bright,
When you?ve got to go back to bed when it is night;
And how much more sensible in bed to stay,
And snooze on so sweetly?
Here Sleepy Head went to sleep, and had to be shaken violently by Puck.
He finished the line more drowsily than ever ?
by - night - and - by - day
? You?re a perfect disgrace, Sleepy Head,? said the Fairy Godmother. ? Let this be
a lesson to you others not to marry into the Sluggard family.?

* Don't mention such honors ?
Twas flies he killed,
not giants ?
? Are there any more people coming ? ?
asked Cinderella, when Sleepy Head had been
hustled into the background by Puck.
? There is one more, at any rate,? said
the Fairy Godmother.
?Will he be a giant or an ogre?? asked
Cinderella excitedly.
But her question was not received with
pleasure. The fairies cried out in terror,
looking nervously about them ; and the Fairy
Godmother was quite cross.
? Don?t mention such horrors,? she
said. ? You gave me quite a turn.?
?Have no fear,? said Seven-at-a-Blow,
in his important way, ? I am competent to deal
with giants.?
?Was it seven giants you killed Seven-
at-a-Blow?? asked the Fairy Godmother
maliciously.
Seven-at-a-Blow looked rather crest-
fallen. ? Er ?not exactly giants,? he admitted.
Puck began to skip about in delight. ? I know what it
was. 1 saw him. Twas flies he killed, not giants. He?s a
tailor, and he killed seven flies that had settled on his bread and
quince jelly.?
Let this be a lesson to you not to boast and put on
airs, said the Fairy Godmother. ? Puck is sure to see you and
make fun of you afterwards. Don?t pretend to be a giant killer
when you are only killer of midges. If you are a good tailor
you shall make Puck a new suit for high days and holidays.?
? May I have a suit all red and gold and brown, like
autumn leaves ? ? asked Puck.
? Yes,? replied the Fairy Godmother, and Puck said ?Oh
goody! ? and began to skip about in high delight.
? Why, here?s a real giant killer, and a modest one too,
by all appearance,? said the Fairy Godmother.
The person spoken of was a tall, up-standing youth, clad
in green, and carrying a long wand that looked like the stalk of
a glorified broad bean.
?Yes, I?m Jack and the Beanstalk,? replied this personage.
?You?ve read about me in the history books.? And he
began to sing in a rollicking fashion ?


I?m Jack and here?s my beanstalk, and I hope I see you well,
The story of my eventful life I?m going for to tell.
You?ve heard of my adventurous climb into the Giant?s domain,
And how adroitly I did for him, and came safe home again.
The Giant?s wife, a kindly soul, hid me behind the door ;
The Giant enjoyed a cannibal feast and then he began to snore.
I took his gold, his harp, his goose that laid the golden eggs,
He cracked his crown, but I came safe down, for well I used my legs.
? I don?t think he?s overburdened with modesty, after all,? thought Cinderella to
herself. To Jack she said : ? You are not in the history books. You are in the fairy tales.?
? Fairy tales are the truest history, Cinderella,? replied Jack.
At this moment there came a sound of military music, and there was quite a stir in
the assembled company, as a band of Turks marched in, led by a chief. They were dressed
in white tunics, baggy green trousers, and red fez caps, and were followed by a stately-
looking Turk in flowing white garments and a turban, and a woman in long black robe and
a yashmak, which is a veil with slits for the eyes.
?And who may you be?? asked the Fairy Godmother. ?You are none of my
fairy people.?
?Oh, I know,? cried Cinderella, ?they must be Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves.?
? True, O Princess,? said Ali Baba. And he and Morgiana made a low salaam.
? True, O beautiful Princess,? echoed the Chief. ?We are the Forty Thieves, but
unfortunately not a full muster.? He gave the pass-word, ? Open Sesame ; ? and all the
Thieves made a low salaam to Cinderella.
? Please sing us a song about yourselves,? begged Cinderella. She thought that not
being fairy people they might not know the rules of a fairy party. But they evidently did;
for they sang their song with much spirit.
We are the Forty Thieves,
In the enchanting leaves
Of the Arabian Nights
Our tale is told.
How we so bold and free
Cried ? Open Sesame,?
Piled in our secret cave
Jewels and gold.
We are the Forty Thieves,
Our enemy
Whose life we desired,
Ali Baba was he.
Ali Baba was the next to sing. He had a bass voice and a condescending manner.
Ali Baba you see ; you?ve heard of me.
I found their secret cave,
Their pass-word ? Open Sesame ?
Its riches to me gave.
I took their jewels and gold,
They planned my life to take,
But Morgiana wise and bold,
A better plan did make.

Then Morgiana put back her veil and sang the second verse in a very dramatic way.
I went at night by candle light
To fill with oil my can ;
To tell you true I went quite blue,
Each jar concealed a man.
I kept my secret then,
But schemed their plot to foil,
Those robber men, e?er the clock struck ten,
I slew with boiling oil.
After which All Baba took up the strain again, and finished the story, which every-
body agreed was very interesting.
I lived at ease for many a day,
My wealth and fame increased.
1 helped my friends upon their way,
And gave them many a feast.
And her, the ingenious one
Who saved my noble life ?
I married her to my eldest son
To make him a sensible wife.
\\ hat a lovely party we?re having,? said Cinderella. ? I wonder if any more people
are coming.
? There is one more,? answered the Fairy Godmother, ? and he is really the most
important of all.?
? Whoever can he be ? ? cried Cinderella.
At this moment a herald entered in great haste, clearing a way through the
assembled company by the display of his staff of office. ? Make way for the Prince,?
he commanded in a loud voice.
Is it the Prince of \\ ales, I wonder," said Cinderella.
?It is the Prince of Peradventure," answered the Fairy Godmother. ?He is coming
to ask you to be his bride, Cinderella.?
Me ! ? said Cinderella. ? Oh, goodness ! ?
She had no time to say more, for in came the Prince followed by four attendants,
and looking ?well, looking just as you see him in the picture ?so graceful, so handsome, and
with so princely an air that Cinderella knew at once that here indeed was the fairy prince
of her dreams. She just gazed at him without saying anything.
? Curtsey, child,? said the Fairy Godmother.
I can?t curtsey,? said Cinderella, forgetting again.
The Fairy Godmother waved her wand a little impatiently. ? Don?t stop to think
whether you can or not, but do it,? she commanded. And Cinderella swept a low curtsey.


And then the Prince sang?
And she shall be both kind and good,
With charms and graces too,
1 am a prince of high degree,
It is my lot to roam
The flower of gentle maidenhood
Whose foot will fit the shoe.
Till I the lovely maiden see
To lead in triumph home.
Then her I?ll love and her alone,
With true fidelity.
Though many beauteous maids I find,
The one past all compare,
She?ll sit beside me on a throne,
And she my queen shall be.
The one entirely to my mind
I?m seeking everywhere.
After he had sung his song, in the most beautiful voice, he called to his attendants;?
? Bring forth the glass slipper.?
?The attendants became very agitated ?searched in their pockets, slapped themselves
all over; and each one said that somebody else ought to have it. But their search was in
vain, and after they had satisfied themselves that the glass slipper was not to be found upon
the person of any of them, the one who had spoken so loudly as a messenger ventured
timidly,
? Please, Your Loftiness, it cannot be found.??
? Off with their heads,? said the Prince in his princely way ?not meaning any harm.
?The glass slipper has unfortunately been left behind with the baggage train,? he explained
to the Fairy Godmother. ? However, I know the measurements to aT. Can anyone
oblige me with a foot rule ? ?
? If a yard measure is of any assistance,? said Seven-at-a-Blow, drawing this article
from the scabbard at his side, and presenting it with as large an air as if it had been a
diamond-hilted sword.
? It must serve,? said the Prince.
He knelt on one knee, and took the measurements of Cinderella?s foot.
? Exactly the measurements of the glass slipper,? he said, rising to his feet,
are she whom I have sought over the hills and far away. Will you be my bride ? ?
You
Cinderella hung her head shyly. ? This is so sudden,? she said.
? Curtsey, child,? said the Fairy Godmother, ? and say thank you very much.?
And Cinderella curtseyed, and said ? Thank you very much.? She felt very happy
indeed.


Then the fairies and all the rest clasped hands and
danced about Cinderella and the Prince. And while they
danced they sang this little song :
Dear little Cinderella, dear little girl so fair,
With helpful hands, tender heart, and merry laughing air ;
Dear little Cinderella, loving and kind and true,
Because you love the fairies, the fairies love you too.
Dear little Cinderella, now that the Prince has come,
In a golden carriage he will take you to his home.
Dear little Cinderella, soon you a queen shall be,
A queen to sit on a golden throne as happy as may be.
Dear little Cinderella, back in the world again,
You must love, you must labour, and know both joy and pain;
Dear little Cinderella, this you must not forget,
The fairies once have loved you, and they will love you yet.
?Well, I never had such a perfectly lovely time in all
my life,? said Cinderella when rhe dance was over. And then
she saw Seven-at-a-Blow beside her with his turnip watch in
his hand.
? Are you aware, Cinderella,? said the important little
man, ? that the time is??
? What ? ? cried everybody.
? The time is?? replied Seven-at-a-Blow, making the
most of the moment, ? the time is?five minutes to 12, fairy-
land time.?
The fairies love you too ?
?Oh dear, where is my daylight dress ? ? cried Cinderella. ? I must be back in it
before the clock strikes.?
? Bring my bag with Cinderella?s dress in it,? said the Fairy Godmother to Puck
? I put it in a safe place,? answered Puck, ? and I can?t remember where the safe
place is.? But he looked so mischievous that nobody believed him.
? Oh my goodness gracious me,? said the Fairy Godmother, ? Where is Cinderella?s
daylight dress ? ? And all the rest echoed, ?Oh my goodness gracious me, where can
Cinderella?s daylight dress have got to ? ?
I remember,? said Puck, ? I hid it under the Wolf?s fur coat.?
? Here it is,? said one of the fairies, bringing the magic bag and giving it to the
Fairy Godmother.
Then the fairies sang their farewell song.
Fairies, fairies, in ferny grot we dwell.
Fairies, fairies, our home each flowery dell.
We quickly back to fairyland must fly,
Dear Cinderella, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
? Oh goodbye, dear Fairies, and Nursery Rhymes people, and all,? cried Cinderella,
?and goodbye to you, dear Fairy Godmother.?


? Goodbye, Cinderella,? answered the Fairy Godmother. ? Always be happy and
then you?ll be good. Think of others first, and get up bright and early in the morning.
You remember the old adage,
Early to bed and early to rise
Will make you healthy and merry and?
But at this moment the clock began to strike.
?Oh dear,? she cried. She turned hastily away, and the last thing Cinderella heard
was the tap-tapping of her high heels on the garden path. And that was the end
of the party?and the end of Cinderella too, for when Ellie opened her eyes,
fairy people and fairy scenery had vanished. She was sitting on the stump with the
book on her lap, and round her were the familiar things, house and garden and little plum
tree and all the rest. And she was certainly wearing her daylight dress, though how she
got back into it she did not know.
11 Why, here comes Bella,? she exclaimed. ?It is quite late and I feel as if Pd been
asleep. Well, did you enjoy yourself ? ? she asked her friend.
Not very much,? replied Bella. ?It wasn?t Mary Pickford after all. But what
makes you look so happy, Ellie ? ?
? Oh, I?ve had the loveliest time,? said Ellie. ? I?ve seen my Fairy Godmother, and
the Nursery Rhymes people, and a lot of others. You never saw such darlings as the Babes
in the Wood. And Humpty Dumpty had a bump on his head because he fell off the wall.
And Seven-at-a-blow had a turnip watch, and he told me when it was 12 o?clock fairyland
time. But, of course, the Prince was the best.?
I wish I had a Fairy Godmother, Ellie,? said Bella wistfully.
So you have,? answered Ellie, ? Only you?ll never, never see her as long as you live,
unless you mend your ways. She told me so herself.?
? Oh, Ellie, I will try to mend my ways,? said the other little girl. ? Please tell me
how I can see the fairies.?
Always be happy r , and then you 11 be good,? said Ellie. ? Think of others first, and
get up bright and early in the morning. That?s what the Fairy Godmother told me. And
111 lend you my old fairy tale book. Just look at the lovely pictures in this one.?
Thank you, Ellie dear, said Arabella. ? I do want to read about the fairies.
And I?ll remember about the other things.?
Yes, do, urged Ellie. ?And if you believe in the fairies and love them very much,
they 11 come and give you a party ?as they did me.?
? Oh, Ellie,? sighed Bella ecstatically, as she gazed at the picture of the beautiful
Prince. ? I wonder if they will.?


Then the two little girls sang together a pretty song they had learnt at school
Among the blossoms fair and bright
And we must pass the ivory gate
And cross the crystal bar,
The little fairies live,
And gifts of health and love and light
And come with childish hearts elate
To where the fairies are.
To children dear they give.
And when we leave the happy band
And years their sorrows bring,
We?ll slip away to fairyland
To hear the fairies sing.
And so we will
leave them in the fairyland of a child?s dreams. And for the children
wish that the fairies may give them, every one, a Cinderella?s party
who read this book, I
of their very own
