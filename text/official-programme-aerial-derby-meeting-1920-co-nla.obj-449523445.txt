EFFICIENCY"

The ESSEX is a marvel of efficienc}^:
The small economical engine is 18
h.p. R.A.C., but it actually develops
55 brake h.p.
It is the perfect light car; for usual
work it is economical in the extreme,
but when occasion demands, it is a
veritable racing demon, capable of
outclassing larger and more costly
cars.

S.HARPtR
The weather this time of the year with the North-
Easters blowing affords conditions for flying
that are PERFECT.
You should therefore not delay in participating
in an aerial flight.
Eots of people still feel timid about “ going up.”
Why ! Because they have never spoken to any-
one who has flown and heard his or her personal
experience.
Our passenger-carrying experience has shown
us that those who are the most reticent and unde-
cided about making a flight invariably are the
most appreciative upon their return and will tell
you of their remarkable feeling of security and
comfort, to say nothing of its fascinating delight.
The Australian Aircraft and Engineering Co.,
Ltd. up to 31st October, have carried 4,803 pas-
sengrs in their Avros at Mascot and elsewhere
covering a total distance of 80,000 miles without
single mishap.
Some people talk safety, but after glancing at
these figures all doubt must be removed.
You should keep abreast of the times and book
a flight with us. You will always wonder why
you ve not tiied it before.
Bookings on Aerodrome, week days or week
ends. There is always a pilot on the ground.

TO SPECTATORS.
WARNING !
Do not trespass on that part of
the Aerodrome reserved for the

starting* and landing of Aero-
planes.
None but Officials and Competit-
ors will be permitted to pass
within the fenced barriers.
Whatever
may happen
do not rush on to the ground.
By so doing you would endanger
your own life and that of any
pilot who may be about to land.

As each aeroplane passes Richmond
the wireless officer in charge of the
station will transmit to Mascot infor-
mation as to identity of machine and
time of passing.
This information will be received
instantaneously (at the speed of
186,000 miles per second) by the
Mascot station and recorded on the
Notice Board erected near the Official

LUBRICATION!
The correct Lubrication of Aircraft is, natur-
ally, a matter of great importance.
Guesswork and theorising characterised the
early lubrication of aircraft —just as they
characterised the early lubrication of motor
cars.
The Vacuum Oil Company has placed Aircraft
Lubrication on the same scientific basis that
characterises its lubricating recommendations
for all types of machinery.
The further development of air travel will
continue —the work must go on.

lows: —
Ist Flight. —Aeroplane will fly along the centre of the Aero-
drome from one end to the other.

estimates of the speeds of the aeroplane are nearest to the officially
measured speeds, an order for a free flight over the Harbour in one
of the Aeroplanes of the Australian Aircraft and Engineering Com-
pany,
3. For the purpose of awarding the prizes, the Club’s officials
will add together the differences between each competitor’s esti-
mates and the official speeds, and the winners shall be those who
have the least aggregate error. The decision of the Club’s officials
shall be absolutely final in any matter connected with the compe-
tition, Only four prizes will be awarded, and in the event of
equality the Club will distribute them by lot.
