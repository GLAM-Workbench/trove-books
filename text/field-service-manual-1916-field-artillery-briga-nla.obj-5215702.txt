SECTION 6.—CART AND WAGON LOADS.
The distribution of the loads carried by transport vehicles shown
in this section has been arrived at after a series of packing trials,
and a departure from it would only be justified by exceptional
circumstances.
For the purposes of calculation the load of a G.S. Wagon with
4 light or 2 heavy draught horses is estimated as approximately
3,000 lbs. The weight of individual items in the loads of different
marks of wagons, and of individual wagons of the same mark, may
be found to vary.
The articles of " wagon equipment " and such articles of the
"loads " as spare wheels, poles, &c., which are required for general
transport purposes, will at all times remain with the vehicles, and
are not to be left with the unit when vehicles return to fill.
