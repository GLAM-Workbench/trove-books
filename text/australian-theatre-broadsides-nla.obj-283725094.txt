For the Last Week of the Season will w
be presented the Farcical Comedy H[ |Tw|
by W. Lestocq & Harry Nicholes ■ ! JLL JL^''#)
At the Parish Council meeting the pro-
ceedings began with none, and gradually
became uproarious. At last one of the
disputants, losing all control ot his
emotions, exclaimed to his opponent,
“ Sir, you are, I think, the biggest don-
key that I ever had the misfortune to set
eyes upon.” “Order! Order! ” said the
chairman, gravely, “ you seem to forget
that I am in the room ! ”
On an average each penny in circula-
tion changes hands eleven times a week.
“ Robbing Peter to pay Paul ” is said
to have originated in an act of the Church
government of England, in 1550. At
that time St. Paul’s Cathedral, being out
of repair, and no funds available, a por-
tion of the income of Westminster, which
was consecrated to St. Peter, was diverted
to the repair of St. Paul’s.
Jinks —“ Been to the circus, eh ! See
anything new ? ” Blinks — “ Yes. The
children who laughed at the clowns were
new.”

A “ nincompoop” was originally a per-
son of unsound mind (non compos men-

sect of the “ Assassins ” (founded by
Hassen ben Sabah in 1030). This order
derived its name either from that of its
founder or from that of the intoxicating
drug (haschisch), which was usually taken
by those selected to carry out his com-
mands in the way of “ removing ” lay
person or persons obnoxious to him.
An “ earl ” was an “ elder ” in the
primitive society, while “ pope ” is the

the Romans when they called upon the

MISS IDA HOLBEIN. whose private

Melbourne, is a talented young descrip-
tive vocalist, who has won laurels at the
Alhambra, Sydney, with the Cogill
Brothers, with Messrs. York and Jones,
and with other companies. She has
recently been fulfilling a seven months’
engagement in West Australia, a place
where the sanitary arrangements are
such as to make visitors fearful of, and,
consequently, especially susceptible to
any epidemic. Miss Holbein writes :
“ Whilst in West Australia I was
attacked by influenza, and as I had heard
so much about the sickness in the west,
I felt very bad.
‘ * What with burning head and pains, I
felt like to die. I know that I could not
do justice to myself or to my work. The
doctor could only give me the consolation
that the attack must wear itself out, and
that I must be patient. I could not be
patient, and my friends, seeing that the' feverish symptoms were growing worse,
determined to try the effect of Or. 'Williams’ Pink Pills. Acting
under their advice, I took several boxes. The effect has been marvellous. The
fever and the influenza rapidly disappeared, and have left no trace behind except
my gratitude to the Dr. Williams’ Medicine Company for having placed their
Or. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People before the public
of Australasia.”

Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills
Have a remarkable efficacy in curing
diseases arising from an impoverished
condition of the blood or an impair-
ment of the nervous system, such as
anaemia, partial paralysis, locomotor
ataxia, St. Vitus’ dance, nervous
headache, nervous prostration, and
the tired feeling arising therefrom,
the after-effects of la grippe, influenza,
dengue and typhoid fevers, and severe
colds, diseases depending on humors in the blood, such as scrofula, chronic ery-
sipelas, &c. Or. Williams’ Pink Pills give a healthy glow to pale
and sallow complexions, and are a specific for the troubles peculiar to the female
system, and in the case of men they effect a radical cure in all cases arising from
mental worry, overwork and excesses of any nature. They are sold by all

Du Maurier was a thorough worshipper
of beauty, as one can see from “ Trilby,”
The splendid specimens of womanhood
he used to sketch in Punch also show
this. He was no admirer of delicacy, but
loved to see well-developed frames. His
chief models were his wife and daughters.
Uncle Silas (in art gallery) : “ Giminy
crockets, Maria, but them artists is old

that air picter. It’s signed ‘ Jones, ’97.”’
“This is an insult,” declared the

Madame Bernhardt will not exercise,
and hates fruit, unless she happens to feel
in a mood for eating it, and still she has
a handsome head of hair, which some of
•the doctors say is quite remarkable, in
view of the fact that fruit and exercise
make beautiful hair. She makes her hair
grow winter and summer by exposing it.
For several hours a day it hangs down her
back, with the air blowing through it and
the sun touching it. Her theory is that
wherever the hairpins touch the hair it
will be dull and glossless.
Scribbler — “Yes, I have written a large
number of poems, but I do not propose
having them published until after mv
death.” Chorus of friends (raising their
glasses) “ Here’s long life to yon,
Scribbler.”
Mama (after she had punished Tommy)
—“ Stop making such dreadful faces.”
Tommy (bursting into tears) —“ I ain’t.
I’m trying to keep a stiff upper lip.”
Her Mother—“ Edith, don’t you think
i are getting too old to play with little
ys ? ” Edith (aged seven) —“ No,
jamma; the older I get the better I like
.hem.”
“ Do you hear that whining' in the next
room ? ” “ Yes; who is it ? ” “ That’s

manly utterances at the end of the game ;
his wife is rubbing his lame shoulder.”
A man recently drank a pint of yeast
in mistake for buttermilk. He rose three

He —“ Just think of it. They say

There are two violet farms in the

Hitherto Patient Boarder “ Mrs.

Pawkins, looking at her fashionable
daughters enthusiastically. “ Yes, the
dear, dear girl,” muttered Mr. Pawkins
despondently.
At the Party.— Mr. Boresley (amateur

you for a moment to concentrate your
mind upon absolutely nothing.” Miss
Spicer —“ Would it make much difference
if I concentrated it upon you, Mr.
Boresley ? ”
Society is divided into two classes—
the fleecers and the fleeced.
Encouragement. —Her Papa —“Has
my daughter given you any encourage-
ment, sir J ” Mr. Loveday—“Well—er
—yes. She said you were an awfully
generous parent.”
“ Knocked into a cocked hat ” is
symbolical of the ease with which this
article, especially when old, assumes
almost any shape.
Boy or Girl ? —Wife (reading a letter
from a distant friend) —“ How strange !
Blfrida doesn’t say whether her baby is
a boy or girl. But she states it’s already
beginning to talk.” Husband—“ Oh,
well, ihat decides it; it’s a girl, of course.”
Teacher—“ Where do the Arabs live I ri
Boy—“In the desert.” Teacher—‘‘What
do they call those pious men who flee to

Culture is dangerous when it reaches
the point of taking a woman’s mind off
the thing she has in the oven.
Lost Child (to policeman) —“ Please,

An impecunious Irishman said he liked

A country clergyman recently officiated
for a brother clergyman. Being anxious
to know what impression he had made
he asked the clerk : “Was my discourse
too long ? ” “No ; but it ’ was long
enough.” “I am glad of that; r or to
tell you the truth, the other day, as I
was getting this sermon ready, ray dog
destroyed four or five pages, and, clerk,
that made it much shorter.” “ Oh, sir,”

The poet enters timidly, “ Here are
a few verses, Mr. Editor,” he says defer-
entially. The barbarian, without looking
up, says, “Please throw them in the
basket, yourself—l haven’t time just
now.”
Truthful Tommy.— Mr. Oumso — “This
is a very bad report to bring me from
school, Tommy.” Tommy—“ I know,
papa ; but you said if I’d bring you a
report you’d give me half-a-orown,

Family friend: “ T congratulate you,

Dear Sirs, —I have been for some years subject to Biliousness and
Headache, and, seeing Bile Beans were so extensively advertised, I
decided to give them a trial, and accordingly put myself under a short
course. I can truthfully state that I experienced relief from the
beginning, and to-day I feel in perfect health. I can conscientiously
recommend Bile Beans to anyone suffering from Biliousness and
Constipation. You are at perfect liberty to publish this statement
when and where you please.
Yours truly,
W. HESLEHURST.
THIO WOB K.I3STO
BXLE BEANS*
Are manufactured in one of the largest and best-equipped laboratories
in the world at Detriot, Michigan, U.S.A. They have been used
throughout that country for years by the most eminent medical men.
Every pill is a dose, and their great worth lies in the fact that they
act directly on the bile ducts, and do not purge or strain the bowels,
therefore avoiding all vile after-effects that follow the using of nearly
all purgative medicines sold to-day. They are an undoubted specific
for Headache, Indigestion, Constipation, Debility, Dyspepsia, Piles,
Pimples, Female Ailments, Sallow Complexion, and all Liver Troubles.
They may be obtained at all Chemists, price 9Jd per box, small
size, or 1/1J regular size; or direct from the Australian Depot,
Bile Bean Manufacting Co., 19 Macquarie Place, Sydney.
