PREFACE.
It is at all times more or less difficult to determine the first
true discoverer or propounder of any new idea in science or
art, industrial or social progress. It frequently happens that an
observation casually made by some thoughtless person, to one of
a philosophical turn of mind, may start the latter upon a train of
thought and investigation leading to most important results. To the
first is due the credit of having given a useful hint; to the second
belongs the merit of maturing and developing the idea, and,
imparting to it a tangible and practicable form. Whoever may
claim to have first thought or written anything about holding an
Intercolonial Exhibition of Australasia, of this there cau be no doubt
that the realisation of the suggestion is due to the lion. Mr. Bindon.
'Without his persistent exertions, warmly aided by the present
Government, and most liberally supported by Parliament, the
idea of the first Industrial Festival of the Australian colonies at
Melbourne could not have been realised.
Of the Exhibition as it now stands, Victoria and the contributing
colonies may well be proud. The varied products, the display of
scientific, artistic, and mechanical skill* prove in a most striking
manner not only the general existence of a highly-cultivated intelli-
gence amongst the people of these colonies, but show a strongly-
marked progress of refinement since the last local Exhibition of
1861.
Since the foundation of Victoria, there has always been a dispel-


sition to foster and encourage home productions by means of local
exhibitions and shows. So far back in our brief history as 1850,
the Victorian Industrial Society, under the management of the late
Mr. Le Soucf, commenced its annual gatherings, and did some good
service to the cause of colonial enterprise.
The first Colonial Exhibition on a large scale was held in
Melbourne in 1854, preparatory to the despatch of objects to the
Paris Exhibition of 1855; anc l it says something for the enterprise
of our colony that in those ?dear times? .�21,000 should have
been spent on the erection of tire Exhibition Building in William-
street, a structure which, though now getting old and inadequate for
the growing wants of Melbourne, has done the State good service.
A few figures afford the means of contrasting the present Inter-
colonial Exhibition with previous efforts of a more local character.
At the first Melbourne Exhibition of 1854, in preparation for the
I aris Exhibition of the following year, there were 428 exhibitors,
by far the greater portion being of imported goods.
At the Victorian Exhibition of 1861, in anticipation of the great
London Exhibition of 1862, there were in all 703 exhibitors
catalogued.
This Exhibition was, on the whole, highly successful. The total
receipts for admission for the ten weeks during which it was open
amounted to �3400.
It is proper to mention that the receipts were greatly augmented
by having musical performances, the average receipts per day
without music being �2O 10s., and the average receipts with music
�59 Bs. The cost of the music must, of course, be considered;
but, financially, it was found that music was profitable as well as
attractive.
The prominent position assigned to Victoria at the Great Exhibi-
tion of London in 1862 is now a matter of history, and the follow-
ing extracts will show that none of the Australian colonies have
reason to regret the efforts they made to be duly represented, or have
need to find fault with the tone of English criticism upon them.
Mr. Hollingshead, in his admirably-written ? History of Exhibi-
tions,? which forms the introduction to the Illwf rated Catalogue of


the International Exhibition of 1862, makes these observations on
the colonies: ?
In 1851 the colonies were, us a whole, almost unrepresented. The
notice given was too short; the undertaking was hurried; the project
was quite new, and not clearly understood; and, moreover, most of the
colonies were scarcely in a position to go to much expense for contri-
butions. The East India Company, however, made a noble display, and
some few of the British colonies a respectable appearance in 1851, and
also at Paris in 1855. According to the latest official returns, the aggre-
gate population of the colonies and possessions under British rule exceeds
195,000,000, of which the great bulk? lBs,ooo,ooo? are distributed over
British' India. In these colonies a total revenue is raised of about
,�44,000,000, and the yearly value of the external trade?imports and
exports?is upwards of �?176,000,000. It appears from the official reports
that out of 23,575 superficial feet of horizontal net space allotted to the
British colonies in 1851, but 6180 feet were occupied. The only colonies
then specially represented were?Canada, which made a good display; a
few objects indirectly sent for exhibition from Nova Scotia, New Bruns-
wick, Newfoundland, and Bermuda. From the West Indies a small collec-
tion was sent from the Bahamas, and a few odds and ends from Antigua and
Barbadoes. Trinidad and British Guiana were well represented. Of the
African colonies, the Cape was the only one that sent a collection ; a few
objects illustrating the products of St. Helena and the west coast of
Africa were shown by London merchants and individual exhibitors in
England.
Of the Eastern colonies, The Mauritius sent but little; but a fair col-
lection was transmitted from Ceylon. ? r
In 1851 the Australasian colonies were but poorly represented, although
a few made some efforts to put in an appearance. The New South Wales
and Tasmanian collections were creditable, and a few things were sent
from South Australia and New Zealand. With the exception of a small
collection from Malta, this formed the aggregate of the colonial efforts.
? At the Paris Exhibition in 1855, the few colonies that did send articles
made a very satisfactory display'. Canada especially obtained honour for
its varied collections, which occupied upwards of 3000 feet of space, con-
tributed by about three hundred and fifty exhibitors. Jamaica covered
an area of about 500 feet, and British Guiana 350, whilst Barbadoes and
the Bahamas were the only West Indian colonies that sent. Ceylon
occupied nearly as much space as Demerara, and the Mauritius sent a
small collection. - -
The Australian colonies on that occasion were very well represented,
although one or two did not show. Two hundred and fifty-one exhibitors
from New South Wales occupied 871 square feet; one hundred and
eighteen exhibitors from Tasmania, 429 feet; thirty-six from Victoria,
289 feet; and ten from New Zealand, 117 feet. The official returns show
that the?twelve British colonies which exhibited products at Paris in 1855
filled about 500 feet more space than all the colonies which were repre-
sented in 1851.
Most of the industrial divisions in the Exhibition of 1862 were well filled
by nearly all the colonies exhibiting, and the collection of raw produce is
particularly rich and interesting. The Australian colonies exhibit one of
the most extensive and finest collections of the whole group, and on the
collecting, arranging, and despatching of these a very large amount of
money has been expended.
New South Wales has a beautifully-arranged collection of its gold


products from all the principal fields, in the several shapes of nuggets,
quartz, grain gold, washing stuff, coin from the Sydney mint, &c. It
sends an excellent assortment of Australian wines, tho best of its wools
and fleeces and cloth made from them, stuffed alpacas and the shorn
fleeces of the flocks now in the colony, coal, minerals, native woods, and
various agricultural produce and manufactures.
Queensland, which appears for the first time in Europe, has come
forward most creditably with its ornamental and useful woods, wool,
cotton, and tropical products.
South Australia is principally strong in its rich minerals, products of
copper and lead, and malachite manufactures, and its wheat and flour, for
which it has always been noted.
Western Australia also sends specimens of woods, in which it is espe-
cially rich, some of the spars and planks being very fine. Its other
products assimilate to those already mentioned.
Victoria has gone to great expense to forward an enormous collection ;
the only difficulty being to find room for one-half of the goods sent. One
of the most striking objects is a gilded obelisk representing the actual
amount of gold found in tho colony since 1851, about 800 tons, or
-�103,000,000 sterling. Its manufactures and general industry arewellreprc-
sented, and a more extensive and varied collection has never before been sent
from any British colony to Europe.
Tasmania sends, besides its wool, manufactures, and agricultural
produce, a noble trophy, rising 90 or 100 feet, made of its native woods,
with a circular staircase in tho interior ; two whale-boats with all their
gear are slung from it, and a fine native spar, surmounted with a fla<q
rises from the centre.
New Zealand sends from several of its provinces wool, wood, coal, gold
and agricultural produce. ?
There are one or two points of comparison between the Victorian
Exhibition of 1861 and the present Intercolonial gathering of 1866,
which will tend further to show a very gratifying march of improve-
ment. The Exhibition of 1861 had an available area of 19,000
superficial feet; the present Exhibition Buildings and Courts occupy
56,240 feet, or nearly three times the area of the old Exhibition ;
every available foot of this space is occupied, the exhibits being in
fact too much crowded, and the gangways too much encroached
upon by goods, to render promenading agreeable on busy days.
At the Melbourne Exhibition of 1861, the gross cash receipts for
admission, including season tickets, amounted to about .�3400 fer-
tile period of 60 days and evenings during which the Exhibition
was open. The gross number of persons admitted was 67,405.
The sum of �6O was paid as a bonus for the sale of refreshments.
At the present Intercolonial Exhibition, the gross cash receipts
for admission, including season tickets, from ? the 24th October
to the Bth December, 40 days and evenings, have amounted to

The experiment of admitting the public on Saturday evenings at
6d., and children at half-price, has been eminently successful, and it
is intended to open on Mondays at a similarly reduced rate.
At the Dublin Exhibition of 1865, the number of exhibitors
stood thus:?

mendation given to the several colonies, at the Exhibition of 1862,

At the Dublin Exhibition of 1865 Victoria was the only Austin
lian colony which exhibited anything like a complete collection. The
number of exhibitors from this colony was 141, receiving 34 medals,
and 62 honourable mentions.
According to the Official Catalogue, the other Australian colonies
which exhibited \vere ?Queensland, 6 exhibitors; New South Wales,
5 exhibitors; and South Australia, 2 exhibitors.
It may perhaps seem impertinent to contrast small things with


great, but the splendid success of this first Intercolonial Exhibition
really justifies a few other points of contrast.

It will thus be seen that, amongst this group of colonies belonging
to the British empire, we have managed to aggregate two-thirds as
many exhibits as at the exhibition of Dublin, one-fifth of the number
of exhibits shown at the Crystal Palace of 1851, and a little
more than one-twelfth of the number of objects displayed at the
Great Exhibition of London in 1862.
The success of this our first Intercolonial Exhibition has not been
achieved without labour, and for a time the most important feature of
the scheme, viz., its truly intercolonial character, was barely achieved.
The authorities in New South Wales declined to give us any support,
and the people of South Australia were at the outset nearly as indif-
ferent. Fortunately, however, for the credit of the enterprise, as well


as to the credit of the colonies themselves, a better tone succeeded
the first manifestations of indifference, and Dr. Bleasdale and myself
had the great satisfaction of discovering that amongst the commu-
nities of New South Wales and South Australia there existed kind
and warm feelings of regard for the people of Victoria, which were
not to be suppressed by the coldness of a few politically bilious
individuals, who would fain have sent us back to Melbourne defeated
and humbled for presuming to dictate to our seniors.
To our neighbours in Tasmania belongs the credit of having at
once heartily joined in the spirit of the Exhibition, and of having
contributed the most extensive and complete collection of natural
products and artistic objects.
To Western Australia is due the highest commendation for the
readiness which the authorities of that colony have displayed in
promoting the success of the Exhibition.
The Governor of New Caledonia is especially entitled to our
gratitude for the very handsome manner in which he responded to
the appeal of our Commissioners, and also for the valuable services
rendered to the Exhibition by Messrs. Mathieu and Boutan, the
gentlemen sent expressly from New Caledonia to -represent that
colony here.
The splendid collection of South Australian wines, fruits, cereals,
and minerals, together with the beautiful specimens of workmanship
in silver, the display of implements, and that admirable invention,
Mr. Nitschke?s still, present, on the whole, a highly-interesting and
characteristic group of exhibits.
New South Wales, the last to give her consent to join in our
industrial festival, has made good use of the little time left to make
up a becoming collection of objects suggestive of the great resources of
that most important colony. It is, however, to be regretted that the
completeness of the New South Wales Court should have been so
seriously marred, as it has recently been by the removal of goods for
transmission to Paris.
A similar remark may be made with regard to the Queensland
Department, as the best of her products have also been recently
despatched from hence for the great French Exhibition of 1867.


Althougli New Zealand Las not entered the lists in an official
manner, a very interesting collection of objects lias been gradually
accumulating, and the space set apart for the provinces is now quite
full. A very complete series of exhibits has been forwarded from
Southland, by Mr. J. H. Baker, Chief Surveyor, while the fine arts
are ably represented by the beautiful water-colour paintings of Mr,
Gully and M. Barraud,
A small but highly-interesting assortment of products has been
considerately forwarded from Netherlands India, and the first instal-
ment of promised contributions has arrived from the Mauritius.
The acknowledged success and completeness of the present Exhi-
bition is in a great measure due to the very general support which
has been accorded to the project by all sections of the Press, inter-
colonial as well as Victorian. In no instance have any Exhibition
notes been forwarded to the papers without their being promptly
and prominently inserted ; and I am not quite free from the conscious
conviction that many columns of matter which ought to have gone
into the advertising department have appeared in the cheaper garb
of general new r s.
Some suggestions have already been thrown out with reference to
the holding of the next Intercolonial Exhibition, and it has been
mentioned that, as the Centenary of the Foundation of New South
Wales will be in 1870, it would afford a most fitting opportunity for
holding the second Exhibition at Sydney in the course of that year.
Should such be the case, the people of New South Wales may
doubtless rely on the cordial support of Victoria, as well as of those
colonies which have come forward so well on the present occasion.
Having acquired some experience in connection with Exhibitions,
I may, perhaps, venture, in conclusion, to offer a few suggestions
with reference to the internal arrangements of such institutions.
1. In the general plan of an Industrial Exhibition, especial care
should be taken to make all parts of the edifice equally attractive.
If the design embraces one feature of peculiar beauty, all the
Exhibitors will naturally be clamorous to have a place in it, and the
great mass who are excluded will be jealous and dissatisfied.
2. Every exhibitor considers that his particular goods are entitled


to the greatest prominence-?hence the perfection of a design for an
Exhibition Building would be one all centre, and without sides, aisles,
ends, or out-of-the-way corners.
3. Annexes and secondary buildings should, if possible, be
avoided, excepting, of course, for machinery or processes of manu-
facture.
4. Ample space should be reserved for promenade and for seats
throughout the building. In the present Intercolonial Exhibition
the great demand for space for exhibits has rendered this impossible,
without rejecting a large number of important contributions.
5. Due provision should be made for musical performances,
which are essential to ensure the completeness of enterprises of
this nature. The greater the attendance the greater will bo the
success of Industrial Exhibitions, and all legitimate means may fairly
be resorted to to promote that end.
G. It is unnecessary and out of place to attach ultra-scientific
interest or sentiment to these industrial gatherings. The great
aim of an Exhibition is to give the fullest possible notoriety to
new manufactures and processes, and bring the manufacturer and
inventor more closely in contact with the merchant, speculator, and
capitalist; and, by this most practical method of advertising, to
enlarge the basis of trade.

INTRODUCTORY.
To those who remember the glories of the Great Exhibition of 1851,
the model of all succeeding enterprises of the kind, the under-
taking which has been brought by the Victorian Commissioners to
so successful an issue will not present very formidable proportions.
Contrasted on the other hand with previous attempts of a like
character in this city, there can be no doubt that this gathering of
1866 assumes an importance it would be difficult to overrate. But
without entering upon comparisons, either detrimental or flattering
to our pride as a nascent nation, it may be safely alleged that it has
been made evident, during the brief period which has elapsed since
the opening, that the Exhibition is quite sufficiently large to prove
puzzling to visitors unable to devote much time to its inspection, or
ungifted with the faculty of systematic application. Persons have
visited the place more than once, and for hours together, and have
subsequently found on comparing notes with friends that multitudes
of objects, well worthy of attention, have escaped their view. To
assist such visitors in making a more comprehensive survey of the
buildings, and to prove a Hand-book to the Exhibition, more interest-
ing and generally acceptable than a dry catalogue, constitutes the
modest object of this little publication.
We will first lay down clearly the line of march we propose to
adopt. Entering the building at the visitors? porch in Latrobe-street,
we shall proceed at once into the Main Hall, and turning sharp to the
left, find ourselves in the Mediaeval Court, where our inspection com-
mences. Passing through this court, we shall travel right down the
left avenue of the Hall, and come round the pillars back, then down
by the left centre, through the fur trophy which meets the eye on
entering the room ; we shall proceed back again by the right avenue,


passing round each intercolonial court on onr way, and taking a trip
into the gallery to obtain a bird?s-eye view of by far the finest hall
constructed in Australia, This completed, we shall find ourselves once
more by the Mediaeval Court, and shall leave the Main Hall and
enter the Machine Room, which runs along the northern side of the
pile. This most instructive apartment we shall circumnavigate, and
overlapping our course a little, pass out of it by the central door,
leading into the Northern Fountain Court. This will bring us to the
northern entrance to the Octagon, where we shall turn sharp to the
right, and inspect it first by the outer circle and then by the inner;
leaving this?one of the most elegant rooms of the series?by the
door, which enables us to cross the Hall, and proceed, without
turning to the right or left, into the Annexe, we shall advance
straight up the centre of this corrugated iron structure, and out
through the left wing, which, in consequence of pressure of space,
as the printers say, has been extended as far as Russell-street.
Returning down this wing, we shall take a peep at the large space
of open garden, where the flower show recently took place, and
others have yet to be held, and then, re-entering the Annexe, turn
to the right hand, and travel round it, and, re-traversing the central
pathway, return to the Hall. Taking the ? left wheel,? we shall come
to the entrance to the Picture Gallery, which runs along the south
of the pile, balancing the Machine Room on the north. After
making the circuit of the Picture Gallery, we shall descend the
steps leading to the basement, where are located the large and
delightfully-cool Refreshment Rooms, and shall find at the extreme
end of the corridor apartments containing more exhibits, in the
shape of wines, ales, and cured meats. A retrogressive movement
from this point will bring us to a flight of stairs, by ascending
which we shall reach the Southern Fountain Court, and re-enter the
Octagon by the door opposite to the one through which we first
came upon it. This will complete our tour of the Exhibition,


GUIDE
TO THE
INTERCOLONIAL EXHIBITION OE 1860.
THE MAIN HALL.
On entering this hall from Latrobe-street, visitors who put
themselves under our guidance will find, by turning immediately to
the left before arriving at the fur trophy, which faces them, that
they have come upon perhaps the last thing one might expect to
encounter in an exhibition of the products and manufactures of a
new colony?to wit, a Mediaeval Court, the whole of the decorations
and contents of which are the work of two Melbourne houses, the one
that of Mr. John Young, contractor, and the other that of Messrs.
Ferguson, Urie and Lyon, glass-stainers, &c. The excellence of
this court consists not more in the beauty of the various articles it
contains than in the admirable tone of all the decorations, giving to the
place that ?dim, religious light? befitting the character it assumes.
The stained-glass windows let into the partitions surrounding the
court are mainly instrumental in producing this effect. The court
is filled with statuary, fonts, and elaborately-ornamented wrought-
iron articles, suitable for mediaeval church purposes. One of
the statues represents the Madonna and Child ; others personify
St. John, St. Thomas, and St. Theresa. Attached to the walls
near the roof are several of the quaintly-carved figures which
catch the eye in old churches. These are intended for St.
Patrick?s Cathedral, now in course of erection on the Eastern Hill.
To complete the ingenious effect of this court as a complete
work of art, Messrs. Ferguson, Urie and Lyon have con-
structed at the side opposite the entrance a recess representing
an early English chancel, the decorations of which are most com-
plete. The furniture of the chancel consists of an altar table, an
illuminated oil painting of the Last Supper, and illuminated tablets
of the commandments, creed, and Lord?s Prayer. The light
admitted to the chancel pours through five s-tained-glass windows,
representing respectively the Nativity, Passion, Crucifixion,
Resurrection, and Ascension. These are designed for the Episcopalian


Church at Casterton. The walls are also artistically decorated, and
altogether this chancel, with the court leading to it, make up one of
the most remarkable objects of the Exhibition.
Passing out through an angle of the Mediaeval Court, we come
upon a nicely-arranged set of bedroom furniture, designed and
manufactured by Messrs. Beauchamp and Rocke. There are ward-
robe, drawers, washstand, toilet table, swing glass, pier glasses,
chairs, &c. The window lighting up this corner of the Hall is
elegantly curtained by the same firm, so as to complete the effect.
The furniture is principally of Huon pine and blackwood?two of
the most useful woods which this part of the world yields. The
Huon pine comes from the banks of the river of that name in the
south of Tasmania, and the best of the blackwood is brought from
the island colony. The chess-table ottoman is sure to attract
attention here as well as further down the same avenue, where one
capable of separation into two easy chairs is exhibited by Mr. D. M.
Crowley. For a good part of the way down the left-hand side of
this avenue are exhibited elegant suites of drawingroom furniture by
various makers, in inspecting which, however, the visitor must not
forget to lift his eye to the wall above, where various articles worthy of
attention are hanging. The windows also are utilised for the purpose
of displaying specimens of stained and ground glass, some of
the latter the product of a Ballarat manufacturer. At the
right-hand side, a case of valuable Australian furs from Mr.
Hart?s repository challenges notice. A little further on, among the
furniture exhibits, is a beautiful cheval drawingroom screen,
embroidered in floss silk on white satin, which will bear comparison
with the best foreign work of the kind. The billiard tables from Mr.
Alcock?s manufactory form too conspicuous a feature of this portion
of the building to be readily overlooked. They are (with the
exception of one portion of them) of colonial materials, even to their
beds, the slate for which is obtained in the neighbourhood of Castle-
maine. The wood principally used is that most valuable of all our
indigenous timbers, blackwood. Mr. Alcock has immense quantities of
this wood in his yard in various stages of seasoning. The bulk of it,
as we have said, comes from Tasmania, in the court of which colony
a magnificent specimen is displayed. One of Mr. Alcock?s billiard
tables is left without a cloth, so that the slate bed may be seen. The
cloth, by the way, it should be mentioned, is the exception to which
reference has been made, as up to the present time it cannot claim
to be a local manufacture. Above the tables are fitted lights of an
elegant design. Cues and rests, together with spiral columns and
other specimens of wood turning, are placed upon the tables. Passing
some elegant sets of drawingroom furniture, the visitor may be apt
to overlook a central ottoman standing by itself, less elegant, perhaps,
than comfortable-looking. It is possessed of this novelty, that by
the withdrawal of two or three iron rods it can be converted into two


couches and two easy chairs. On the walls above are slabs of grained
wood by Ellimore, so well executed that it is difficult to distinguish
them from the productions they represent.
On the right-hand side of this avenue, and ranged in cases
around the pillars, is to be found the collection of the Victorian
Mining Department. This includes minerals from all parts of the
world, as well as the almost exhaustive collection illustrative of the
mineralogy of this colony. Special catalogues of these exhibits can
be obtained by the visitor, together with an essay on the subject
from the pen of R. Brough Smyth, Esq., to whose patient exertions
the excellence and completeness of the collection is mainly due. For
the benefit of those who may not be disposed to have recourse to
this source we extract from the Argus an abbreviated notice of the
collection :
Beginning with the cases, we may point to Nos. 9 and 2858, from the
claim of Messrs. Lewis and Menzies (the former the prospector), situated
on Balaclava Hill, Whroo. The hill is one mass of sandstone, intersected
more or less thickly by auriferous quartz veins, and the main workings
at present in operation consist of a large open cutting. The specimens
are taken from depths varying from 50 to 330 feet, and some of the
quartz yielded thirty ounces of gold to the ton. Here, too, are exhibited
a fair number of Victorian gems?such as zircons, sapphires, &c., from
Blue Mountain, Berwick, Loddon River, and elsewhere. No. 254 includes
specimens of granite from Nuggetty Reef, Maldon. The granite shows
its junction with the metamorphosed slate and the intersecting veins of
quartz. The distribution of the minerals composing the granite is often
peculiar, and the gold is disseminated in the small veins of quartz in such
a manner as to compel the miners to send the granite itself as broken
out of the mine to the mills. Pyrrhotine and other forms of iron pyrites
are found in this locality. The whole of these specimens are very
interesting. No. 322 forms a collection of rocks and minerals illustrative
of the geology of the Upper Murray basin, collected by Mr. C. E.
Hodgkinson, C.E., Assistant Commissioner of Lands and Survey. The
collection includes some fine crystals of tourmaline in quartz, and two
specimens of fossil unio. The chief value of the collection is, however,
that it explains and illustrates Mr. Hodgkinson?s ? Observations on the
Geology and Soil of the Country adjacent to the Upper Murray, and also
on the Development of the Productive Capabilities of that Portion
of the Territory of Victoria,? published by the Victorian Philosophical
Institute (now the Royal Society), in 1855. No. 320 is a fine specimen of
Cape Paterson coal, about four feet long and 2 feet thick, from Mr. T.
Bury?s coal claim in that locality. No. 348 is a curious piece of New
Zealand jade, or greenstone (hydrous silicate of magnesia), the property
of Mr. S. H. Bindon. This mineral is found massive and in blocks, with
slate and limestone, in many parts of the world. In India, axe-heads and
ornaments are manufactured from it, and vessels made from the material
are found to be as sonorous as porcelain. In New Zealand, and indeed in
many parts of the South Seas, the natives fashion jade (or nephrite) into
all kinds of fantastic shapes, hatchets, ornaments, &c., of which the
specimen accompanying may be taken as an excellent example. In the
New Caledonia Court some splendid native weapons of this material may
be found, together with a huge block of a light green colour, closely
resembling jade. No. 496 indicates a case entirely devoted to some pro-


raising specimens of native copper, sulphides, oxides, carbonates, and
grey copper ores, from the claim of the Thompson River Copper Company,
above forty-five miles from Sale, North Gippsiand. Many are very fine
and large, consisting of blue and green carbonates of copper and hematite,
&c., yielding, it is said, a return of from 20 to 50 per cent, of pure copper.
The lode is understood to have been traced for several hundred feet, is
eighteen feet wide, and worked to a depth of 40 feet. According to account-
sales rendered, it would appear that 18 tons 15 cwts. of copper ore were de-
livered by the company to the English and Australian Smelting Company?s
works at Adelaide, and the percentages agreed upon for the four parcels
were respectively
copper, or 349 units, of the value of =�246 Is. 3d. At this point we may
mention that several fine slabs of slate, from the Moorabool Slate
Quarries, are exhibited in the North Fountain Court. Of native lead
there are two entries. Nos. 414, 415. The first came from the gold-
bearing drift in the claim of the Mount Greenock Great Extended Gold
Mining Company, on the main course of the Mount Greenock Lead, the
particles being more numerous towards the heart of the mount. They
were presented by Mr. E. J. Bateman, of Talbot. The second exhibit is
a specimen of lead found with fine gold, the gold appearing to have been
taken up while the lead was molten. They were in great quantities in
the claim of the Avoca Deep Lead Mining Association, in the gutter, and
are very rare and valuable. Part of the lead was washed from three tubs
of washdirt. From the Clones come, in addition to numerous specimens
of auriferous quartz, two specimens of ? flucans,? found in the centre of
the western reef, at the 200 feet level. They were presented by Mr. R.
H. Bland, and are derived from the Clunes Quartz Mining Company. In
separate small cases will be found three exhibits of great value, sent by
Mr. W. H. Gaunt, warden at Beechworth. The first is No. 522, and is
composed of washdirt, containing gold and stream tin, taken from a
depth of 75 feet; thickness of layer of washdirt, three feet. It came
from Messrs. Kneebone and Co.?s amalgamated claim, Eldorado
Flat, Woolshed Creek. The second. No. 523, is stream tin, taken
from a depth of 15 feet from the surface, said to yield 75 per cent,
of tin, and to be worth .�4O per ton, in addition to an average yield of 90
ounces of gold per ton. A cubic yard of washdirt yields about two to
two and a half ounces of gold, and half-hundredweight of tin ore. It is
derived from Gift?s claim, Napoleon Flat, Woolshed Creek. The third.
No. 524, is also stream tin, taken from a depth of thirty feet from the
surface, said to yield 65 per cent, of tin, and to be worth �37 per ton, in
addition to an average yield of 75 ozs. of gold per ton. A cubic yard of
washdirt yields about 3f ozs. of gold and 1 cwt. of tin. It comes from
the Endeavour Claim, Eldorado Flat, Woolshed Creek. Ingots of smelted
tin ore from Beechworth are also exhibited ; and beneath two of the long
specimen cases are two large blocks of fossil wood from the Ballarat deep
leads. A few specimens of carbonate of copper, from the Quedong
Copper Mining Company?s claim. Twofold Bay, cannot but attract notice ;
as well as several samples from the different levels of the St. Arnaud
Silver Mines Association, St. Arnaud; bismuth from the Dandenong
goldfields, and carbonate of bismuth from Eamshorn Gully, Sandy Creek,
Maldon. There may also be seen basalt, showing the strata sunk through
by the Great Redan Extended Company, Ballarat; kaolin from the
Dunolly Porcelain Company, sent by Mr. J. C. Paterson ; chalcedony from
Morocco Valley, Gippsiand; and agate from Cape Otway. The collection
made by the Geological Survey of the colony is at once remarkable and
varied. It is included in Nos. 423-487, and among other more familiar
minerals are cerusite, with galena, iron and arsenical py rites, from Wilson?s


Reef, St. Arnaud; mimetene from the same place, valentin from
Woudspoint, psilomelaue from Strathloddon, daillogite from Clones,
micaceous iron ore from the Grampians, brown iron ore from Moonee
Ponds, titaniferous Iron sand from the Upper Yarra, chromic iron sand
in small octahedrons from Heathcote Creek ; wolfram from Sandy Creek,
Maldon; spathic iron or chalybite from Lisle?s Reef, Maldou; sphaerosi-
derite from Campaspe River; pyrrhotine with arsenical pyrites from
Maldon, pharmacosiderite from Clones; copperas from Beehive Reef,
Maldon; felspar from West Australia, the Anakies, Malmsbury, Fryers-
town, and Gippsland; talc from Heathcote, obsidian from Geelong and
the Western Plains; and zeolites, zircons, corundums, alma.ndine, garnets,
&c., from various parts of the colony. From the Major?s Ranges, Benalla,
are sent by Mr. H. B. Nicholas, the mining surveyor, a small and a large
specimen of hydrated peroxide of iron, and Mr. Nicholas states that thexe
is an almost unlimited supply of similar material cropping out from the
surface. The same gentleman has sent specimens of limestone (Nos.
33 and 244) taken from the vicinity of the samples of iron just men-
tioned, and the limestone deposit appears to be very considerable. An
unusually fine specimen of sandstone from the Grampians, fourteen
miles west of Stawell, has been sent by Mr. W. G. Couchman, mining
surveyor of Inglewood. It is numbered 489. On one of the pillars
opposite to the auriferous quartz is hung a map of the colony of
Victoria, showing the mining districts and divisions, also the alluvial
workings and quartz reefs. As a piece of workmanship it may be said to
be equal to the maps by Major-General Colby, of the ordnance survey of
Great Britain. It also has the merit of being admitted as the most
accurate of the maps of Victoria yet published. Mr. A. B. Ainsworth,
mining surveyor, of Woodspoint. has also sent a map of that mining
division, which is hung on the other pillar. It would be difficult to find any
map of any mining division in the colony on which the boundaries of the
claims, leases, reefs, and alluvial workings are laid down with more
apparent carefulness. Numerous Victorian fossils from the goldfields are
also offered for inspection.
Independent of the large collection of the Mining Department in
cases, there are magnificent specimens of quartz exhibited in this
portion of the building, near to the entrance to the annexe. A
small case, stationed a little further down the same avenue, is con-
tributed by the St. Arnaud Silver Mining Company, the arrange-
ment of which deserves special attention. The specimens in it are
so located as to show the dip of the various lodes and the character
of the stuff lighted on. A still smaller case in this neighbourhood
is somewhat obscurely situated, and might, although containing
some elegant specimens of quartz gold, escape notice. It is among
the Sandhurst goods, and its contents are the product of the North
Whip Reef, and contributed by Mr. George Elliott.
The lower half of this avenue, beyond the annexe entrance, is
chiefly devoted to the provincial exhibits, which are of a heteroge-
neous kind. Coming first upon Sandhurst, we find, besides the
frames of photographs which are common to all the courts, and some
of which are executed in a superior manner, models of mining imple-
ments, specimens from the gold claims, and natural products innu-
merable. A box of gum taken from the acacia, greatly resembling


gum arabic, is contributed by Mr. Holdsworth, of Pall-mall, together
with samples of beeswax and white seal bottling wax. There is also
here what is termed a self-acting fountain; but as the action is not
going on, and there is not up to the present time any description of
its modus operandi , the visitor is left in the dark as to its peculiari-
ties. A collection of pebbles and stones, made by Mr. G. Long-
bridge, comprises a considerable variety of valuable specimens. The
Alabama Company have sent a beautiful quartz specimen. Among
the homely articles here, some most useful ones in the shape of
leathers and clay ware will be found. The former are from the
establishment of Messrs. Goudge and Sibley; the latter from the
pottery works of Mr. Guthrie, at Epsom. These comprehend,
among other things, those large stone bottles and jars which are
required for so many manufacturing and domestic purposes, and
which hitherto the colony has imported from the other side of the
globe. Opposite these are handsome cases, containing stuffed birds
from the Sandhurst district, contributed by Mr. John Slocombe, and
three or four paintings by Mrs. Thunder, which will well repay
inspection.
The next compartment we come to contains the exhibits forwarded
from the Beechworth district, a most admirable collection as showing
the resources of the locality, if not attractive in outward aspect.
One of the first exhibits we meet on the left-hand counter is a rough,
but doubtless efficacious, still for perfumery. It was moulded by
hand by the exhibitor, Mr. P. J. Martin. Side by side with this
is another novelty, the product of the inventive genius of the
district, to wit, some patent horse-shoes, designed by Mr. Samuel
Taylor. The peculiarity of these shoes consists in the fact that the
upper portion of them is expansive, and yields to the pressure of the
horse?s foot like the hoof itself. They are said to be advantageous,
especially in leaping. Patent stirrups, which readily allow the foot
of the rider to escape from them in the event of accident, and patent
hooks for hoisting, made so as to close the more tightly the greater
the weight placed upon them, are contributed by Mr. Macabe, of
Chiltern. Samples of sea-island and New Orleans cotton, grown
on the Ovens, will be noticed next, adjoining several small slabs of
the Murray pine. The latter form a section of an excellent collection
of woods from the Ovens district. Leaving a complicated geographi-
cal clock and altiscope of Mr. Cuzner?s to be investigated by the
curious in such matters, we pass on to inspect the samples of grain
and flour. Among the former will be found Ovens canary seed,
grown by Mr. Jeffrey, Gardiner, and much fine wheat, oats, &c.;
among the latter, samples of flour most creditable to the local millers.
Malt, dried fruits, and jams of all kinds will also be found amongst
the products of the district, among which, of course, the wines make
a good show. A good case of Ovens gems, set in Ovens gold, is
exhibited by Mr. \V. J. Turner; contiguous to which are cases of


birds and reptiles, which are not likely to escape notice One pretty
little exhibit in the neighbourhood consists of a branch of eucalyptus,
on the leaves of which landscape views are painted in oil colours.
Some large tobacco leaves, grown at Wangaratta, are shown here,
which appear to be of good quality; also, glue of local manufacture.
Another step brings us among a lot of Ballarat exhibits, and we
are surrounded by slates and woods, furs, and confections. r.
Stevens exhibits furs; Mr. Taylor, biscuits and bon-bom; Mr.
Shepperd, embossed glass-all of fair quality ; but the article which
will most likely catch the eye of the visitor is a case containing 72
birds, well stuffed and mounted. After having looked at this, how-
ever, let us turn to something less showy, but more useful the
saddlery. This is intrinsically worthy of special notice. ihe
Ballarat saddlery evidently competes on equal terms with that of any
in the Exhibition. . ,
At the extreme end of this avenue, where we have now arrived,
articles from the country districts and from Melbourne are pretty
well fumbled together. The former furnish some fine samples of
home-grown silk, and of a product to which we are more accustomed,
viz., washed wool; while the metropolis is strong in soaps, glues,
manufactured tobacco, and saddlery. As indicating what may yet
be done in this direction, a few leaves of tobacco grown at Belvoir
from seed of the Havannah plant are interesting. Among the more
ornamental saddlery is a side-saddle made by Mr . J. Martin, of
Melbourne, profuse in workmanship. Cases containing tobaccoes
and cigars, exhibited by Messrs. Moss, White and Co., Tobelman,
Hornmel and Co., and Politz and Co., are ranged along the corner
counters, while upon the face of the southern wall above is a fine
show of colonial-grown ? weed.? Handsome exhibits of spirits,
cordials, and liqueurs, from the establishment of Messrs. F. and J.
Hemmons, make evident the fact that the time is arriving when we
shall be independent of imports to a great extent in this as well as
in other directions.
Turning round now, to proceed down the second 001 �
upon cases of saddlery, some the property of Messrs. M Farlane and
Sons, and others of Messrs. T. Loader and Co. They do not enter
into competition the one with the other?the. former being of tle
elaborate and costly description, which appeals to the wealthy
connoisseur, and the latter plain and substantia, an appeamg
directly to the mind commercial. Haines for cart harness, portions
of head gear and girths, are among the articles which Messrs. Loader
and Co. manufacture for wholesale consumption, as well as wiup-
thongs, halters, curled horse-hair, and similar fixings. Passing
down this avenue towards the end at which we entered, we have on
our right hand the outer sides of the counters on which the
provincials display their contributions, and on our left principally
the results of Melbourne enterprise. Casting our eyes on the latter


first, we see a case containing some dainty little feminine boots and
slippers bearing the name of Emile Lance, and a large assortment of
millinery, neckerchiefs, cap-fronts, stays, and the like, by various
other exhibitors. On the right hand we have the contrast of
quartz from Castlemaine, tobacco pipes of fine clay, candles, and
beeswax from Dunolly, a slate mantelpiece from Ballarat, slabs of
lightwood and biscuit from Wangaratta, and gems and quartz
crystals from Beechworth?photographs of course everywhere, each
borough having furnished, in accordance with the suggestion of Mr.
J. G. Knight (the secretary to the commission), a municipal frame of
them, some of them, it must be admitted, admirably taken and
tastefully mounted. In this avenue, too, the banners of the various
boroughs are conspicuous, and deserve looking at, the designs of
some being very creditable. They certainly compare favourably with
the bunting of the sister colonies which adorns the other side of
the hall. A short way down this avenue, on the left-hand side,
just before coming once more upon the cases of the Mining Depart-
ment, is a very elegant exhibit which none ought to miss seeing
It is the contribution of Messrs. Joseph and Co., of Sandhurst,
and consists of a working model in silver of a quartz crushing
machine. It is diminutive, but strikingly accurate and illustrative,
the little stampers pounding away with all the energy characteristic
of the real machinery. The motive power is supplied by a small
galvanic battery fixed beside the model. Glancing at the very
elegantly-arranged photographic views furnished by the Essendon
and Elemington Council, we recross the gangway leading to the
annexe, and catch sight of some fine specimens of quartz supplied
from Tarnagulla, and of the regains of antimony from the Victoria
Antimony Smelting Company?s works. There are also pieces of
antimony ore from the Costerfield Gold Mining Company,
and from the Leviathan claim, Kedcastle. The white oxide
of this mineral is used in the manufacture of white paint, and
the red sulphate in the manufacture of red paint. The Victorian
lignite and splint coal exhibited here should not escape attention,
nor the small objects of smelted iron, the product of the black sand
found in various parts of these colonies, and notably in New Zealand.
But, in inspecting the one side of this avenue, we must not over-
look the other, which, besides the articles of female attire to which
we have referred, is devoted to cases containing Victorian-made hats,
of every variety, from the factories of Messrs. Ford Brothers, Mr!
Fletcher, Mr. Wallworth, and Mr. Galvin. The contributions of the
latter maker are very varied, comprising, besides the ordinary style,
cocked hats, jockeys? caps, hunting and travelling caps of different
shapes and descriptions of materials. A blackwood wardrobe, by
Messrs. Ashmere and Sons, Geelong, is a creditable piece of work,
and some chair frames challenge a word on the ground of their being
strengthened with corner fastenings of a novel kind, patented by


Mr. Hird. In fancy boxes for bon hons and tbe like there is a good
show, the work principally, we understand, of feminine hands. The
Postal Department contributes the electro-type dies from which the
postage stamps are struck off, together with a prettily-designed illus-
tration of the stamps themselves. The exhibits in straw plaits for hats,
bonnets, and the like, are all from the establishment of Mrs. Mealy,
of Collingwood, who for many years has devoted herself to this
industry, and now employs a large number of hands. The case is
well arranged to show the various processes of straw' splitting and
plaiting, and the articles made up manifest not a little ingenuity
and skill. The connoisseurs of the new roller skate will look
with some interest at a patent roller chair, exhibited by the
inventor, Mr. Rurraeister, which has a steering apparatus attached
to it on the regular race-boat tiller principle. By its means
the direction of the chair can be influenced as desired
either by the propellor or propeller. The collection of books
exhibited by Mr. Detmold, the bookbinder, deserves prolonged
scrutiny. The mounting of all of them is unexceptionable, but one
of them?a Shakspeare, with illustrative milling?is fit to compete
with specimens of ornamental binding in any part of the world. In
feathers there are exhibits of all colours and sorts, from the esta-
blishment of Mr. J. Robertson, dyer, and Mrs. Reed; and in furs, Mr.
J. R. Green shows several varieties, some of them made up into
those comforts for winter travellers, footmuffs. One of Mr. Green?s
productions is of a somewhat outre kind ?to wit, a kangaroo tail
of respectable dimensions turned into a horn of plenty. Passing
cases of embossed w T ork, gold and silver lace, dyes, straw hats made
up from imported plaits, barber-work and the like, we arrive at the
end of the avenue, and in front of a blackwood bookcase, the pro-
duction of Mr. J. G. Taylor, of Ballarat. This is a handsome piece
of furniture, and exhibits some bold wood carving of tasteful and
appropriate design. Some interesting stereotype work and printing
materials and tools are to be seen on the counter running at right
angles to the avenues, exhibited by Mr. Oliver Levey, Messrs. Walker,
May and Co., Messrs. Clarson and Co., and Mr. F. B. Franklyn.
Turning now at the entrance to the Hall, we find the remarkable
fur trophy, which does such infinite credit to the taste and enterprise
of Mr. F. Gardner, the farrier, of Collins-street. It is composed of
Huon pine, somewhat in the shape of a triumphal arch, but so com-
pletely covered wdth furs, chiefly kangaroo, on its outer side as almost
to hide the material of which it is constructed. Surmounting it are
well-stuffed specimens of the kangaroo, emu, and Australian eagle,
representing the Australian arms, while a wide-awake-looking dingo
keeps guard at the entrance. Within the structure are cases con-
taining rugs made up of the most costly furs, including one composed
of skins of the black and white opossum, one of the rarest of Australian
marsupials. The fur of the kangaroo, the wallaby, flying squirrel,


native cat, and ordinary opossum is made up into articles infinite in
their variety ; while the down of the black swan?a down which is as
white as snow?constitutes the material for muffs and boas in great
force. A table in the centre of the trophy is covered with
chiefly composed of the skins of native birds, the bright plumages of
which give great effect to the curious composition. Stuffed birds are
also perched upon stands made up of diflerent-sized kangaroo claws j
and stuffed animals adorn the floor of the compartment. Through
the arch opposite to the one by which we entered the fur trophy, we
come on one of the Commissioners? cases of wools, and round this,
upon two of the dead llamas of the Acclimatisation Society, set up to
look as like life as possible. Opposite to these, and balancing them, as
it were, in the arrangement of the room, is a case the property of the
same association, containing Angora goats, in the acclimatisation of
which the society bids fair to be successful, there being already 140
in the colony. A box holding a couple of stuffed flying squirrels,
one of the strangest of Australia?s animal products, will be noticed
between these two cases.
Leaving a handsome stand of liqueurs, bitters, essences, sauces,
<fcc., exhibited by Mr. Alfred Felton, we proceed down the third
avenue. A prominent object at our first step is a case of account-
books from the establishment of Messrs. Sands and M?Dougall,
comprising ledgers, daybooks, journals, invoice-books, and all the
multifarious works required for the literature of the counting-house
or bank. They are bound in white vellum and Russia leather, some
of them being mounted in brass, giving token of a strength
calculated to far outlast those who write in them. Clearly-
engraved bank-notes and cheques make up a part of the exhibit.
Mr. Detmold has also a number of account-books strongly bound.
Messrs. Blundell and Ford contribute a case filled with many
descriptions of printing, including specimen pages of the publications
issuing from their premises. Among them Melbourne Punch , in a
fancy dress of white satin in place of the ordinary homely paper, is
not the least conspicuous. Along our left hand (a row of elegant
but substantial garden seats excepted), we have for the most part
the opposite side of the exhibits to which attention has already
been devoted. On our right we notice first a billiard table, most
ornamentally composed of several Australian woods, by Messrs. Paser
Brothers, the legs and angles adorned with some well-executed
grotesque carving. Biscuits are not objects easy of tasteful display,
and Messrs. Swallow and Ariell must be congratulated on having
dealt most happily with their manufacture. They have arranged
them in pyramidal form, the basement composed of biscuits in
boxes, the upper portion of biscuits decoratively grouped under
glass, and the apex of a wheatsheaf Each compartment bears the
name of its contents, and the cognomen of the firm is worked out on
one side by means of the gustative material they manufacture. Next


to this biscuit trophy comes the handsome central gold case. Some
fine nuggets are deposited in it, but the show of gold altogether is
not one of the strong points of the Exhibition. This case helps to
fill up the void made by the removal of the gilded pyramid repre-
senting the quantity of the precious metal abstracted from Victorian
earth since the opening of the goldfields. The pyramid, after
occupying this situation for about three weeks, was taken down, and
sent off to enlighten the Parisians. It represents 36,514,361 ozs.
of gold, amounting in value to �146,057,444. In consequence of
the great height of this structure ?over 62 feet?it somewhat
dwarfed the apparent spaciousness of the hall, and its removal,
therefore, is not altogether a disadvantage.
Another of the admirable billiard tables shown by Mr. Alcock
stands next to the gold case, and upon it is placed a small case
containing the Rev. Dr. Bleasdale?s valuable collection of gems.
This comprises precious stones from all parts of the colony; and
beside many of these, the collector has placed foreign gems of like
kind for purposes of comparison. Some of the stones are shown in the
rough, others after having passed under the hands of Mr. Spink, the
lapidary. One of the finest specimens is a green sapphire unearthed
in the neighbourhood of Donnelly?s Creek ?an extremely rare and
valuable gem. Diamonds, emeralds, rubies, topazes, opals, hyacinths,
garnets, amethysts, and beryls are to be found in this collection,
which is one which persons engaged in mining pursuits will do well
to study. Many a rough but estimable gem has doubtless often
been flung away by the digger, which an acquaintance with such a
collection as this would have taught him to preserve. To the left of
the billiard table on which Dr. Bleasdale?s exhibits are displayed,
Messrs. W. Clarke and Sons have a case containing ores of gold,
silver, lead, and copper, of Victorian origin, amongst which are some
rich pieces. Leaving gold and gems, we come upon a more prosaic
article, namely, clothes, of which Messrs. Sargood, King and Sargood
show a capital case of home-made, comprehending every article of
dress, from fine woollen singlets to lusty overcoats. A step or two
further brings us to one of the most noticeable objects in the room ?
the piano trophy of Messrs. Wilkie, Kilner and Co. Pianos of
almost all sorts, from the hundred-guinea cottage grand to the plain
twenty-guinea article, are here to be seen, made up nearly entirely
of colonial materials. Some of the richest are of blackwood, and a
finer wood for the purpose could not be obtained. The care with
which these instruments are finished can hardly be understood with-
out an inspection of their interiors, which are models of neatness and
strength. By the side of this piano trophy are to be found?
generally in full operation under nimble fingers?quite a different
sort of instrument, the sewing machine, less musical but more pro-
ductive. The latest improvements in these are well represented in
the manufactures of Messrs. Grover and Baker, who also exhibit


some magnificent embroidery which has been accomplished
by these flying needles. Further on we have elegant cases of
the dainty garments worn by ladies, to say nothing of babies;
the exhibitors being Messrs. L. Robinson and Co., Mrs. Hill, and
others, of Melbourne, and Messrs. Bright and Hitchcock, of Gee-
long. Messrs. Kilmister and Purdie, of Ballarat, show a ease of
saddlery, uniting the substantial and the elegant in a marked
degree. The gallery pillar intersecting this avenue, like its fellow
on the opposite side, has been surrounded from top to bottom with
small shelves, supporting unnumbered bottles of colonial wines.
The vintage of the Murray and the Yarra, of the Campaspe and the
Barwon, all find representatives. Close at hand, Mr. S. Henderson,
crinoline manufacturer, displays the flimsy articles of his trade in
their happily-diminished proportions. An exquisite little model of
a saddle, under a glass shade, emanates from the establishment of
Mr. G. E. A. Kenney, and is a perfect wonder of dainty
device. A case of clothing from the factory of Messrs. S. Solcberg
and Sons stands next to the handsome glass edifice which envelopes
Madame Decourtet?s wax figure of the Empress Eugenie, in all the
pride of imperial purple. L'lmperatrice stands a little too much
under the shade of the organ gallery to be seen to the best advan-
tage, but we believe she was designedly stationed there to prevent
her wax majesty from being inconvenienced by the summer heat.
On our left hand, an assortment of Yictorian-made portmanteaus
demands attention. They are the work of Messrs. Pausacker and
Evans, who employ little besides colonial material upon their manu-
facture, and turn them out of all descriptions, from the compact
little valise to the many-compartmented travelling trunk. Another
object of attraction to the ladies meets us here, in the shape of two
dummies (not agricultural ones), gay in all the frippery of fashionable
feminine attire. Mr. Kruse, the chemist, exhibits a large collection
of his wares, including fluid magnesia, sugar-coated pills, table
vinegar, pomade. Ac. Turning to the right, we come upon a display
of boots of the tough order, grim with nails, and built, one would
suppose, for everlasting wear. The architects of these leathern
structures are for the most part apprentices connected with
the Collingwood boot factory. A few steps more, and we find
ourselves in a paradise of wines and cordials, jellies and
jams, with a few bottles of Messrs. Rowlands and Lewis?s soda-
water superadded for the benefit of persons suffering a recovery
from the effects of these dainties. In no manufactures is the
Exhibition more noticeable than in those of wines and spirits, jams,
jellies, bottled fruits, and other country products; and the mounting
?which is all about them of which the casual visitor is permitted
to have the opportunity of judging?in many instances is of a kind
to compare favourably with the ?get up? of the imported article.
Occupying a nook almost to themselves in the neighbourhood of the


corner allotment we are now examining, is a collection of soaps
much of it deserving to rank as ? high art,? so elaborate is the
manipulation it has undergone.
The art of our necessities is strange
That can make vile things precious.
1 And though soap in its unadorned state may be far removed from a
vile thing, it of a surety is made to look more precious than is its
wont under the decorative skill of the hands which have turned it
into apples and pears, peaches and nectarines, oranges and lemons
?to say nothing of cameo-like medallions and marble bas or
may we say bar?relief. Messrs. Kitchen and Sons and Messrs.
Tilley and Clack make great displays of these wonders ; while
for plainer soaps and candles the proprietors of the Hobson s
Bay works hold a conspicuous place. Mr. William Carter, of
Emerald Hill, who claims to have been the inventor of crochet,
exhibits a multitude of articles connected with that once-
fashionable work, and also some embroidered linen in various stages
of advancement. Among the numerous necessities of civilised life,
which are now seen to be supplied in this colony, it will be noticed
that the manufacture of ink has not been forgotten ; inks of the
three standard colours, black, blue, and red, being exhibited by Mr.
James Mallett, the goods finding their place at the foot of one of
the flights of stairs leading up into the gallery, where the organ has
been constructed, and the band, when one is present, takes up its
quarters.
The view of the great Hall, obtainable from the front of this
gallery, is perhaps the most striking which can be secured, and no
visitor should miss seeing it. The organ, built against the wall in
the rear, was made by Mr. Finchara, the whole being the product of
local industry, and the result a decided success. As yet only the
? swell ? organ has been finished, but when completed it will be the
largest instrument in the colony. It has a fine tone, and is capable
under a master-hand of producing magnificent effects.
Descending the stairs and passing to the extreme corner at the
foot of the avenue, which includes the courts of the other colonies,
we shall light upon the grand cocoa display made by Messrs. C.
Bates and Go., who have evinced great skill in disposing their goods
so as to afford the curious the clearest insight into the process of
cocoa manufacture. They show first the cocoa nuts in their raw
state, and also engravings representing the pod from which these
nuts are taken. Next comes the roasted nut, then the nibs, and
then the various preparations into which the produce of the cocoa
tree is transformed. Among the objects represented in manu-
factured cocoa, the visitor will notice good-sized busts of Victor
Emmanuel and Garibaldi. Proceeding now up the avenue, we walk
for the first few yards in a grove of leather ?leather of all colours


and of different degrees of thickness and finish. The whole is of
colonial make, but the process of manufacture is illustrated by a
series of fine photographs of the interior of well-known works at
Bermondsey, England. Samples of oil-skin clothing, Victorian
made, also find a place in this locality.
The New Zealand Court, which presents itself next in our ramble,
contains a vast number of interesting articles, most of them of a
substantial and downright useful character. Thus there are flour
and grain, flax, wool, coal, building stone, woods, barks, and the
like. Among the more attractive exhibits the visitor should inspect
a table?a fine piece of workmanship?composed of 17,000 pieces.
The samples of wood devoted to this purpose are well selected, and
the design and execution are alike excellent. A figure cut in
Oamaru stone is a singularly clean bit of carving. The peculiarity
of the material in which this is cut is, that it is soft when first
taken from the quarry, and hardens rapidly when exposed to the air.
It is likely to prove invaluable for building purposes. The collection
of flax fibres is a good one, the coloured fibres being especially
attractive. Silk is also exhibited in close contrast with the better-
known New Zealand products. A nest of Maori kits, made from
flax, adorns the front of the court, where also hangs a curiosity in
its way?viz., a knife made from the Taranaki steel sand. Samples
of the titaniferous iron sand find a place in the collection. Some
splendid Kauri gum should not escape notice ; a group of Otago
bush sticks is sure from its prominent position to catch the eye of
the visitor. An object, however, which is less likely to receive the
attention it deserves is a book of fem impressions very carefully
executed and well worthy of a few minutes? inspection. The greater
part of the New Zealand exhibits are from Southland, the Dunedin
district being very poorly represented.
The Tasmanian Court, which comes next, is one of the best-
arranged and most comprehensive in the entire building. All the
articles seem to be of good quality, and great trouble has been taken
by the Commissioners representing the island colony so to dispose
and decorate them as to set them off to the utmost advantage. A
striking feature on entering the court is the show of grain and
pulse, arranged under glass and placed obliquely against the wall.
Some stems of oats of gigantic stature are also shown, being culled
from a crop grown at Bishopbourne in 1864, the average height of
which is stated to have been seven feet ; those exhibited are much
taller. Below the grain cases are a couple of pair of sculls, made,
the one pair from Gordon River pine, and the other from gum. The
paintings and photographs disposed against the wall above the grain
are some of them admirably executed. The principal painting in the
court, however, is hung in front of the pillar, and is too peculiar a
composition not to catch the eye of the visitor at once. The subject
is a sacred one, and it is sufficient to say that it is from the studio


of Dowling to give assurance of its possessing great merit. " Among
the finest and most artistic things in the Exhibition must rank the
needlework shown here. The group of flowers and blossoming stems
worked in worsted by Mrs. Burgess are far superior to the general
run of articles of this description. Passing, however, to more
prosaic objects, the wood of course demands attention. We have
referred in another page to the large slab of blackwood, measuring
twelve feet by three, which adorns the front of the Court, but the
timber trophy is equally attractive, while beautiful specimens
of native wood are scattered around. Besides the two staples
blackwood and Huon pine, which, as shown in the Victorian furniture
court, can be so felicitously worked together ?there are samples of
bluegum, scented wood, muskwood, cherry-tree, sheoak, heoak, silver
wattle, sassafras, stringybark, peppermint, myrtle, pinkwood, and a
variety of others. A fine article, showing off many woods to advan-
tage, its manufacturer among the rest, is a writing-desk made by
Mr. J. Wood, of Launceston, composed of no less than 1470 pieces.
Oils distilled from the leaves of blue and white gum, peppermint, and
sassafras, form part of the exhibits. We cannot stop to specify all
the jams, jellies, and meat preparations, but their name is legion.
Hops are in full force, and dried fruits, and biscuits. One interesting
contribution is a hortus siccus of flowers gathered by Mr. John Abbott
in mid-winter?viz., July last?dried and arranged in a large album.
The modelled fruit lias been well chosen, and executed with care ;
and it affords evidence of how greatly favoured of Pomona is the
Tasmanian soil. The building stones of Tasmania have long been
popular, the excellent Kangaroo Point freestone forming the front
elevation of many a beautiful Melbourne building. Under the
counter are exhibited samples of all sorts, together with fire bricks,
and the clay of which they are composed. One article, standing in a
prominent position in the court towards the centre of the Hall, affords
an instance of the tasteful results which may be produced from the
simplest materials. It is a pine table, upon which real ferns and other
leaves have been pressed and then super-varnished. The grouping of
the plants has been judiciously managed, and the effect altogether is
excellent. Near this table the visitor must not neglect to cast an
eye on Mrs. Meredith?s delightful series of water-colours; and, if
time be not wanting, Mr, Morton Allport?s stereoscopic photographs
will give those who have not visited the island some notion of the
exquisiteness of the scenery it boasts. The specimens of book-
binding exhibited by Messrs. Walch and Sons serve to show that
Victoria is not singular in the high position which this trade has
attained. A handsome case of topazes from Flinders Island is shown
by Mr. Crouch, of Hobart Town. A less showy but more useful
* Since the above was in type, this painting has been removed into the
Picture Gallery.


mineral is the titaniferous iron sand, of which a quantity trom
North-West Bay is exhibited. Professor Miller, of Kings College.
London, has analysed this substance, and finds it to consist of
'? Peroxide, with a little magnetic oxide of iron, 42-70 ; titanic acid,
44-30; silica, 3-60; magnesia, 2-10; water, 0 52; alumina and
oxide of chromium, 6 - 78 ; lime, with oxides of cobalt, copper,
manganese, and phosphoric acid, mere traces."? Contributions from
the coal mines of Tasmania are not wanting; among the rest is the
anthracite coal found in the neighbourhood of Hobart Town.
Western Australia occupies less room in the exhibition than
Tasmania, but has almost equal cause for gratulation at the taste
displayed in the arrangement of the articles exhibited. Prominent
among these are the woods of the colony, two of which the maho-
gany and the sandal ?are well known to commerce. A slab of the
former wood, polished, is shown by Mr, H. haw, of Perth,
measuring six feet by two and three-quarters. Specimens of red
and white gum, tuart, casuarina, and raspberry-jam woods are
plentiful. The . last-mentioned gains its name from the odour it
gives forth, which resembles that of raspberry jam. Some large
blocks, in the rough, of the woods of Western Australia,as well as of
Tasmania, are to be found in the wing of the annexe, and in the
garden beyond. The following instructive account of the Western
Australian timber we copy from the introduction to the catalogue
issued by the Commissioners for the colony in Melbourne :
The principal timber trees of this colony are of the Eucalyptus or
Myrtle family. Amongst the most generally useful of these is that
commonly called mahogany, and by the natives jarrah. Of this 'wood it
was stated some years ago by Admiral Sir James Stirling, before a
committee of the House of Commons, that there is sufficient to build
twenty British navies. None of the neighbouring colonies possess timber
of similar character to the jarrah, or endowed with equally valuable
properties. If cut at the proper season, when the sap is down (a precaution
too little attended to), it will bo found to be the most enduring of all
woods. On this condition it defies decay?time, weather, water, the white
ant, and the sea worm have no effect upon it. Specimens will be found in
the Exhibition of portions of wood which have been nearly thirty years
partly under water and partly out. Others have been used as posts, and
for the same period buried in the sand, where the white ant destroys in
a few weeks evei-y other kind of wood. For this peculiar property
the jarrah is now much sought after for railway sleepers and
telegraph posts in India and the colonies. It is admirably adapted
for dock-gates, piles, and other purposes, and for keel-pieces, kelsons,
and other heavy timber in shipbuilding. The chief objection raised
against it is that it is liable to ?shakes,? the trees being very commonly
unsound at heart. In this colony vessels of considerable burthen are
built entirely of this wood, the peculiar properties of which render copper
sheathing unnecessary, although the sea-worm is most abundant in these
waters. Another most valuable kind of timber is a variety of white gum,
called the Tooart? close-grained, not to be split, very hard, and capable of
enduring a great amount of heat without rending. It is used for keels,
capstans, windlasses, naves of wheels, Ac., also in the engine rooms of


steam-vessels, liable to exposure to great heat. Both tooart and jarrah
were used to a small extent in the construction of H.M.S. ? Hannibal,? and
the former wood especially met with high encomiums from the Admiralty
surveyors. The Bluegum, which grows in immense forests, .and attains a
vast height and size, to the southward of Cape Leuwin, is allied to the
tooart, and quite distinct from the Tasmanian one. A splendid field for
capital will be found in these magnificent timber forests, and every
inducement is offered by the local Government for its introduction. The
license-fees are merely nominal, labour is cheap and abundant (although
of a rough kind), and the chief difficulty at present experienced is the
high price of freight. The Sandalwood of Western Australia has long
proved a most valuable export, in large quantities, to Singapore and China.
The Raspberry jam, a species of acacia, has an agreeable scent, and is
well adapted for cabinet purposes. The Gasuarina, or Sheoak, is remark-
able for its numerous large bars of radial fibre, which render it difficult
to be split in the direction of its circumference, and it shrinks the least
of any wood in the direction of its radius. The Sheoak is used not only
for shingles, but for axe-handles, spokes and felloes, &c.; the MoreUiov
shafts. See. Both the White and Blue Gums are so hard as to be used for
tramways. The following observations on the Jarrah, or Mahogany, are
by James Manning, Esq., C.E.:?? ?Jarrah, or Djaryl,? is the ? Eucalyptus
Marginata,? commonly called mahogany, from its similarity to the wood
from Honduras and the West Indies. It is applicable for every purpose
for which ornamental wood can be required, some of it being of the very
finest grain and showing much figure, mottled, curls, feathers, and excres-
cences, a feature peculiar to colonial wood, and highly effective in point of
ornament, as will be seen from the specimens forwarded. While it is
highly adapted for ornamental purposes, it is no less valuable as a timber
for heavy work, where strength, durability, and the property of resisting
the attacks of the ? white ant ? and ? Teredo navalis ? are necessary.
Thus for timbers of all kinds for houses, warehouses, wharves, jetties,
bridges, &c., it is invaluable. For piles it should be used whole (not cut
into quarters), either round or hewn; the former is preferable, there being
very little sap, and the outside portion of the heartwood is stronger by far
than the inner portions, near the centre; hence the desirability of keeping
the annular rings complete. The timber of this colony is moreover
subject to the peculiarity of being defective at heart, and although the
sound timber does resist the teredo and white ant, the heart and defective
portions do not. Hence the importance of keeping the outer annular rings
intact, for neither of the insects will touch the sound wood.?
in minerals, as well as in timbers, Western Australia proves the
extent of her resources by the contributions which form part of this
collection. Copper ores, of varying degrees of richness, are supplied
in abundance, most of them coming from the district of country of
which Champion Bay forms the outlet. Iron ore is also represented,
as well as lead, coal, antimony, and plumbago. But very slight
traces of gold have as yet been discovered in Western Australia.
Pipeclays are to be found among the exhibits, well as honestones
and ochres. In manufactured goods, besides turned woods of
various kinds, the principal article shown is leather, of which there
is a quantity from the tannery of Mr. Ranford, of Perth. Of wines
there are not many samples, as, though the vine grows luxuriantly
in the colony, little more of its juice is expressed than is sufficient
c 2


to satisfy tlie local consumption. The bulk of that produced is of a
richer, fruitier description than is common in the southern and
eastern colonies. Raisin-making seems to be a facile operation in
this colony, and two splendid samples find a place in the court.
Grain, flour, silk, ambergris, wool, and sponges, are also exhibited;
and among cases of curiosities will be noticed a good conchological
collection made by Mr. A. Shenton, of Perth.
The show in the South Australian Court is somewhat disap-
pointing, perhaps more from the fact of too great expectations
having been formed, in consequence of the promptitude and hearti-
ness with which the invitation of the Melbourne Commissioners was
accepted, than from any shortcoming in the collection. One marked
omission there is, however ?one of the staples of the colony, viz.,
wool, being unrepresented. Of copper ore and wines, on the
contrary, there is no lack, the samples of the latter numbering no
less than 610 in all. The visitor to this court must not forget that
the bulk of these are placed in the cellars along with other exhibits
of their class, while the larger articles of manufacture, such as
agricultural implements, in which the colony puts in a conspicuous
appearance, are deposited in the wing of the annexe, where,
indeel, will be found much of what may be termed the
overflow of the courts of the sister colonies. The richness of
the copper ore exhibited need scarcely be remarked, as it
is well known that in no part of the world are finer specimens
of this mineral obtained. There are contributions from the Burra
Barra, Moonta, and Wallaroo Mines. Samples of silver-lead ore are
also to be observed, as well as an ore containing gold, silver, and
nickel, associated with iron pyrites. Among the stimulative beve-
rages it will be seen that liqueurs, and even brandies, are not
wanting. The cases of silver work occupy a prominent position in
this court, and attract much attention. The articles contained in
them are the work of Mr. Steiner and Mr. Wendt, of Adelaide, and
their beauty and chasteness certainly deserve all the praise they have
received. A vase and cross, hammered out of blocks of copper, and
a lot of miniature jugs, cups, Ac., made out of silver coins, are the
work of Mr. Nitschke, the inventor of the copper still set up in the
annexe, which has shown itself to be so excellently adapted for the
work for which it is designed. A trophy of timber, banked up with
barrels of flour, is erected in front of the court, but it is dwarfed by
comparison with the magnificent pile constructed by the Tasmanians.
The case of fruit models, however, can hold its own against any in
the Exhibition.
A small portion of the counter space set apart for the use of the
South Australians has been devoted to Batavia, which contributes a
limited collection of products intrinsically valuable but not showy.
They consist principally of coffee, tobacco, spices, tea, silk, sugar,
rice, oil, and hemp, and are to be found ?partially boarded off


from the South Australian exhibits ?close to the entrance to the
Octagon. We extract the following interesting particulars con-
cerning these exhibits, and the Dutch colonies which send them,
from The Australasian of December Bth :
The article of which most specimens are sent is rice. The Java rice-
fields not only feed from seven to eight millions of indigenous inhabitants,
but supply Holland, Belgium, France, and Germany. The specimens here
exhibited are choice and fine, but we shall not say much about them. In
certain localities of Australia rice may be grown with a steady profit,
but only in particular localities, and only by means of cheap labour. The
process of culture is unmistakably unhealthy. It requires a strong heat
operating upon shallow water covering a substratum of liquid mud.
White men will have nothing to do with them, except as proprietors, and
as coloured labour is barely obtainable, we may be sure that, except
in a section of Eiverina and in Carpentaria, rice will not be grown among
us, and even there not for years to come. The indigo exhibited is very
fine, with which notice we pass on. Two excellent specimens of silk
attest the progress which the Batavians are making in sericulture. Both,
the yellow and the white alike, have got that firmness of fibre upon which
the value of silk depends, the insect being evidently of a healthy breed,
and the silk well reeled. These specimens are worth fully 255. per pound,
the best specimens of Australian that we have seen not exceeding 14s
Next we come upon the spices, so dear to our associations as connected
with the subject of Christmas plum-puddings. Here they all are?cloves,
nutmegs, allspice, cinnamon?just as one sees them in the grocers? win-
dows, but having still a spice of novelty about them, inasmuch as they
are shown in their natural, uncommercial state, fresh from the tree.
Tea and tobacco are here, as they may be seen anywhere. The other
products are more peculiar. There is a very fine specimen of mother-
of-pearl. The oils are represented in great force. There is a particularly
fine display of gutta-percha, which Borneo especially produces in any
possible quantities. Caoutchouc (indiarubber) is also present, and teak
shows the ship-building material that Java possesses. Bamboos and ropes
constructed from the cane, two good specimens of native lead, and some
parcels of herbs, complete the list. More than half the commodities
which could have been forwarded, and should have been forwarded, are
wa.nting. The famous tin of Banca is nowhere. Not one of the gorgeous
birds of paradise, children of the sun and of the Moluccas, is to be seen;
and the trepan g, which keeps up of itself a trade employing hundreds of
vessels, is quite ignored.
We regret this, for however little in the future Australia may care
for our outlying districts, the great East Indian Archipelago is certain to
become to us every year more and more an object of vital interest. It
lies dead in the track between us and Hindostan. It will have the
complete command of our telegraph line. Moreover, our commerce with
these great island-continents, Java, Sumatra, Borneo, is growing like a
young bay tree. When the regions round the Gulf of Carpentaria are
fairly settled, as in a quarter of a century they are certain to be, the
North Australians will have fully as much to do,with Banca, Celebes,
Borneo, and Papua as with Sydney and Melbourne. Before going into
dealings with these regions, it is just as well to know something about
them. The intercourse with them will take place under very different
circumstances from that with Polynesia. The Malayan races inhabiting
the three greater islands form highly-organised communities, devout
believer?s in Mahometanism, to the full as pugnacious as the New


Zealanders, numbering their men by hundreds of thousands and millions,
and accustomed to act together under hereditary princes. Over all and
above all are the Dutch, the race who, under De Ruyter and Van
Tromp fought us so hard, and who, under provocation, would not be
disinclined to fight us again. Considering the complex character of
the region and the people, it is remarkable that we should know so
little about them. Our commercial intercourse is already considerable,
but excepting the roadstead of Batavia, we know considerably less of
the East Indian Archipelago than our ancestors did 300 years ago.
The principal cause is, of course the policy of the Government. The
Dutch seem to take after Prince Metternich, who once upon a time
sent an Englishman out of Vienna for having written a book in praise
of Austria, informing him that the Government did not want to be
either abused or praised, but to be let alone. In many points King
William and his Ministers are liberal enough. They are thoroughly
in earnest, for instance, in pushing on the telegraph. But in most
respects the policy pursued is utterly antediluvian, and as opposed to
English notions as darkness to light.
How the Dutch got hold of these glorious islands is a very simple
story. In the olden times, when the Indian traders first established
themselves, under the name of the merchant adventurers, who subse-
quently merged in that of the English East India Company, their
ideas were entirely directed to these very same islands, but chiefly to-
the Moluccas for the spices. A good spice voyage then was for profit
much like what a good slave voyage is to a Cuban planter?he could
very well afford to lose every other vessel, and yet make cent, per
cent. When England laid its strong hand upon the empire of the
Moguls, it tossed over the islands with their lucrative trade to her old
rivals, the Dutch, pretty much like throwing a bone to a dog, and the
dog took the bone, and a very good bone it was. The system thence-
forward pursued by the Hollanders was one so curiously opposed to
our notions, not only present but past, that it is eminently noteworthy.
It was a kind of Spanish policy. The colonial native was to work
chiefly for the benefit of the mother country. He was to have enough
means to keep him in tolerable health and spirits, but beyond that
the surplus belonged to his master. With the exception of the short
interregnum from 1810-1814, when Lord Minto conquered Java, and the
sagacious Sir Stamford Raffles, the founder of Singapore, was his
locum tenens, this system has continued, and the result has been that,
on the average, Java alone contributes above a million and a quarter-
sterling to the home revenue.
Such a system would be impossible in any British colony; but in the
Netherlands East Indies everything is possible, because the climate and
soil are such that they are perpetually producing. No sight can be
more striking than sailing through the Straits of Sunda. The trees?
regular forest giants?covered with interminable creepers, decked with
the most gorgeous forest flowers, festoon the very edge of the waters..
The ground yields three or four crops every year. There literally is
nothing that will not grow. Even under their harsh, arbitrary govern-
ment, the natives cannot help being well off. After paying all then-
taxes, generally amounting to 50 per cent, upon the net produce;
after defraying all their religious ceremonies, which cost no small sum;
and providing for the rice and pillau, to have a sufficiency of which
constitutes their idea of earthly felicity?there is still enough of raw
export left to make Batavia one of the commercial emporiums of the
world. The trade is, as might be imagined, very peculiar, and we Aus-
tralians know little about it. The Dutch-Indian capital sends us sugar


and rice, and little else. But the home trade?that is, to Amsterdam
?is quite of a different kind. It consists to a considerable extent ot
what our American cousins call ?notions.'? Sugar and rice are the
staple. A great deal of tea is shipped, and a very large quantity of
coffee. But the assorted cargoes of the Butch ships are made up with
articles which only these islands can produce. Banca, for instance,
sends tin. Except Cornwall, no island produces tin in quantities like
Banca and the Banca tin is better than the Cornish. Celebes
and Gilolo, and a part of Sumatra, remit the unrivalled nutmegs, cloves,
and allspice, which go far to make up the chief merit ol Christmas
puddings all the world round. Borneo, Sumatra, Java, and New Guinea
manao-e between them to remit a considerable quantity of stream gokb
The Moluccas send birds of paradise plumes, of interest to old ladies and
to young ones. A very large and steadily-increasing export of sulphur
takes place from Sumatra and Borneo, which bids fair to undersell t m
Sicilian in the European markets. Borneo also remits the greater portion
of the gutta-percha, and a great deal of the indiarubber, consumed injthe
world. From Batavia, likewise, is shipped, in neatly-packed cases, tnat
precious trepang, or desiccated seaslug, which to Johnny Chinaman is
more enthralling than opium itself. A Dutch East Indiaman, in a word
is like a Noah?s Ark, containing a little of everything. ?W hen the next
Exhibition comes round, wherever it may be held, we hope that these
everythings will stand visibly forward. As it is, we must conclude as we
began, regretting that the absent friends so greatly preponderate over
the present.
Although but a few weeks have elapsed since the time when it
was thought probable that the Intercolonial Exhibition would take
place without the oldest colony being officially represented at it, the
Sydney Commission, appointed at the eleventh hour, exerted them-
selves so earnestly that they were enabled to contribute at last one
of the best collections in the building. The timber of the colony m
all its variety is well represented, the greater part of the sub-counter
space being devoted to the cleanly-plained and polished blocks
contributed by all parts of the vast territory from Twofold Bey in the
south to Clarence River in the north. One prodigious plank of cedar
emanating from the Richmond River district, but sawn and polished
by Messrs. M � Kendrick and M?E\Van, of Melbourne, is exhibited
against the wall at the end of the avenue up which we are now
advancing. It is 12| feet long by 4* feet broad, and is stated to
be the largest plank of cedar yet sawn. One of the most valuable
products of New South Wales?its coal?is exhibited in various
characters and phases, the biggest and most noticeable, however,
being placed in a conspicuous position in the annexe. An exhibit
occupying a merited place of honour in front of the court which we
have reached, is a collection of tweeds grown and manufactured in
New South Wales, the manufacturer being Mr. 0. E. Ebsworth, ot
Sydney. The excellence of this product of colonial enterprise and
industry will be readily perceptible. Messrs. French and Sons also
exhibit a couple of specimens of tweed cloth. Their manufactory
has not yet grown to the importance of that of Mr. Ebsworth, who


gives employment to seventy hands, and turns out articles which, as
we see, will bear comparison with the finest English make.
Another manufacture in which Sydney appears to considerably
outstrip Melbourne is that of leather, a display of which is made
by Messrs, Alderson and Sons, which includes enamelled leather, an
article which by Melbourne consumers has hitherto been imported
from the other side of the globe. An instance of the value of these
competitive exhibitions is afforded by this exhibit, as since it has
been displayed it is alleged that a portion of the Melbourne trade
in this commodity has been diverted to the handier source
of supply which has been thus disclosed. In some of the principal
leathern products, and notably boots and saddlery, it will be observed
that the elder colony manifests no deficiency. The elegance of one
side-saddle could not well be surpassed. It is said to have been
designed by the maker as a present to the Princess of Wales. In
ironwork there are several exhibits, one of them being an article
not likely to escape notice?to wit, a large casting of the Royal arms,
emanating from the foundry of Messrs. Russell and Co. Building
stone, bricks, stoneware, and rough glass-ware are among the con-
tributions sent by our eastern neighbours. Kerosene and paraffin
oils, crude and refined, are exhibited, as well as productions display-
ing taste and workmanship, such as polished tortoiseshell articles
of various kinds, workings in silver, photographs, paintings.
Among the last-mentioned is a water-colour sketch taken in the
neighbourhood of Sydney Heads, well worthy of prolonged inspection.
A good coloured likeness of Sir John Young is interesting, as repre-
senting a gentleman who occupied a prominent position in con-
temporary history, in connection with one of the most noteworthy
acts of modern British statesmanship?the voluntary surrender of the
lonian Isles.
The show made by the Northern or Clarence River district of New
South Wales is not the least remarkable feature of the Exhibition.
All sorts of products of the orchard and the garden seem to be
here collected, among the rest a preserve which is somewhat of a
novelty, viz., grape jelly. Coal, antimony, and iron pyrites, figure
among its minerals; while in agricultural productions are to be found
samples of its maize, ground and whole, an article much esteemed
in mercantile circles. The zoology of the district is admirably
illustrated in a most complete collection of birds, beasts, and fishes,
skeletons and skulls, industriously gathered and forwarded for exhi-
bition by Mr. J. E. Wilcox and Mr. J. M'Gillivray. No other
part of Australia is in this respect so well represented.
The display in the Queensland Court, never very extensive, is now
meagre in the extreme, as the greater portion of the articles con-
tributed by the northern colony have been forwarded to the Paris
Exhibition. The visitor will still find, however, a goodly number of
samples of the varied timber growth of the colony, as well as of


articles as yet less extensively known?viz., cotton and silk. Sugar
made for exhibition, out of West Indian cane grown in Queensland,
finds a place in the collection, and different descriptions of bottled
fruits and pickles. In minerals, the principal specimens consist of
copper ore, of considerable richness, from the Peak Downs Company?s
Mine in the far north. A few specimens of surface coal, gums,
barks, wool, and dried meats, complete the collection.
The unused space reserved for intercolonial purposes in this part
of the building, has been turned to good account for the disposal
of Victorian exhibits for which no eligible site could be found. On
our left hand, as we approach the end of our concluding avenue, we
see ranged several handsome cases, containing mineral preparations,
assays, and chemicals; while on our right hand, out towards the
hall-entrance, are tasteful glass stands, containing goods of divers
sorts, deserving of closer inspection. Among the former, the con-
tribution of Messrs. Clark and Co., chemical and paint manufacturers,
occupies a prominent position. This firm shows a quantity of anti-
mony ore, and regulus of antimony, together with the white and red
paints which are produced from it. In the case with the antimony
will be remarked magnificent specimens of soda crystals, which are
the product of the works of the same factors. An extensive assortment
of assays and minerals is exhibited by Mr. Sidney Gibbons, the
analytical chemist, who also shows a bottle of native petroleum in
the state it exhibits when pumped from the earth, and a- valuable
series of microscopic illustrations. Home-manufactured spices,
maccaroni, vermicelli, cotfee, and chicory, are ranged along the left-
hand counter, where also another manufacturer of ink, Mr. F. G.
Wormald, finds room to display the articles of bis trade, which
include, among other things, ink powder, which can be readily
turned into ink when required for use. At the extreme end of this
counter, beyond the exhibits of sundry chemists, will be found the case
of elegantly-modelled fruit which the Victorian Commission employed
Miss Thomas to produce. On our right hand, after inspecting the
Queensland Court, are ranged central cases from various Victorian
exhibitors. One of these is from Messrs. Tronson and Hill, and
contains woollen flock or shoddy ; another serves to display Messrs.
Harper and Co.?s coffees ; while a third most tasteful cedar and glass
stand exhibits to advantage the various grains and meals in which
Mr. George Bencraft deals. The corner between these and the Hew
Caledonian exhibits is devoted to the enticing preparations of the
confectioners. Several manufacturers contribute their wares, but those
of Messrs. Leonard, Giraud and Co. attract most attention, from
the taste with which they are arranged, and the delicacy and
beauty of the gustative goods exhibited. Hard by, Mr. R. Laver
exhibits curry powder, which he invites all connoisseurs to taste,
and challenges the world to surpass. Hanging against a pillar,
.above the box of confectionery accepted as a present from the firm


just mentioned by Lady Manners-Sutton, is a sample case of a very
different description of ware, useful enough, but less enticing?we
allude to Mr. Borthwick?s patent anti-fouling composition for coating
the bottoms of iron ships, to prevent them becoming overgrown with
weeds. We believe that this mixture has been found to answer the
most sanguine expectations of the shipowners who have tried it.
Retracing our steps a few yards, we come upon the counter and
wall space devoted to New Caledonia. This young French settle-
ment has come out strong on the occasion, and makes a really
excellent show. The island is well adapted to the growth of sugar,
and several large-sized canes are exhibited, as well as samples of the
sugar produced from them. In another year or two it is expected
that many hundred tons of this valuable commodity will be turned
out. Coffee, rice, tobacco, and maize, are among the products of the
island, the samples of the last-named grain being noticeably
luxuriant. Several native plants are exhibited, with the essential oils
and perfumes extracted from them. The weapons of the aborigines
of the island constitute an interesting item; and a large quantity of
sea-island cotton, grown at Lejou?one of the Royalty Islands?is
deserving of notice. Tortoiseshell, of very fair quality, is obtained in
the neighbourhood of New Caledonia, and finds a place among its
exhibits. But perhaps the most unique article of all is the trepang,
or beche-de-la-mer, which is piled up in a rough box, on a corner of
the counter in the rear of the court. This bon houche of Chinese
epicures has not before, that we are aware of, been seen in
Melbourne. It is found in large quantities on the northern coast of
this continent; and we fancy our readers will be interested in the
following account which the Rev. J. E. T. Woods gives of the way
in which the explorer Flinders fell in with a party of trepang
fishers in the Gulf of Carpentaria, upwards of 60 years ago :
After leaving the narrow passage between Cape Wilberforce and Bromby?s
Islands, the ? Investigator? steered along the coast to the south-west. Some
high islands prevented a view very far a-head, and while endeavouring to
peer among them to discover a passage, a sight met Flinders? telescope which
rather astonished him. Crusoe?s surprise at seeing the footstep in the sand
was nothing to his. There, in the most lonely part of Carpentaria, where
even natives had disappeared, and where the sight of an animal moving
seemed almost supernatural?there, under a rock close by one of the islands,
a Chinese boat full of men was perceived. Flinders knew from the signs he
had met with that some Asiatics must have been upon the coast at
no very remote period, but he no more dreamt of meeting them than
of meeting a parish beadle; and, to say the truth, he would much
rather not have met them. There were some ugly stories afloat as
to the honesty of Chinese boats in much more civilised seas than
the one he was upon. His ship was armed, it was true; but fighting
was disagreeable under any circumstances, especially in a rotten ship ; and
even if the strangers were pirates, and did not attack them, it would require
such an amount of attention to watch them that the survey would be ended.
These were Flinders? feelings as the ? Investigator? glided towards the place
where the boat was lying, and a nearer view did not tranquillise him. As


he rounded the point his anxiety was considerably increased. It was not
one boat, but he now beheld six, lying snugly covered like hulks, and
anchored at some distance from the shore. But for the report of the natives
about their having firearms, he might have been off his guard ; but he now
set them down as a set of piratical cruisers, who secreted themselves here
from pursuit, and issued out as the season permitted or prey invited them.
Impressed with this idea, the ?Investigator? tacked to work up for the
road, and on the pennant and ensign being hoisted, each of the ships hung
out a small white flag. Lieutenant Flinders was now sent in an armed
whaleboat to learn who they were, while the ship came to an anchor with a
spring on the cable and all hands at quarters. Every motion in the whale-
boat and in the vessel alongside which she was lying was closely watched,
but all seemed to pass quietly till the boat returned. Lieutenant Flinders
informed his captain that they were prows from Macassar, and the six Malay
commanders came on board shortly afterwards in a canoe. Fortunately the
cook on board the ? Investigator? was a Malay, and thus in a short time
communications were established.
The chief of the prows was a short elderly man, named Pobasso. He
said that there were sixty canoes upon the coast, in different divisions, and
that Salloo was the commander-in-chief. These people (I now quote from
Flinders) were Mahometans, and they expressed great horror, on looking
into the launch, to see pigs there. Yet they had no objection to port wine,
and even requested a bottle to take with them at sunset.
The object of their expedition was a certain marine animal, named trepang,
Mche-de-la-mer, sea cucumber, or Holuthurius cucumis, which had been
seen first by the explorer upon the coral reefs, and afterwards had been
dragged up in great quantities by the seine net in Caledon Bay. The Malays
get the trepang by diving for it in three to eight fathoms ; and where it is
abundant, a man will bring up eight or ten at a time. They then
preserve them by splitting them and drying them in the sun, stretched
on pieces of bamboo, after being boiled and pressed between stones. A
thousand trepang make a picol, and 100 picols is a cargo for a prow. It
is carried to Timor, and sold to the Chinese who meet them there; and
when all the fleet is assembled, they return to Macassar. The Holuthuria
belong to the family of Echinodermata, of which the sea-egg upon our
coast is a familiar example. The body is free, naked, soft, and thick,
with anything but an eatable appearance. What makes them still more
repulsive and disgusting is that the skin wrinkles about like that of a
leech, and is generally covered with papillary excrescences or warts of
different colours. The head is surrounded with tentacles. They are indo-
lent animals; but when handled, the body contracts, and the tentacles are
immediately concealed. They usually lie exposed in the shallow waters,
or buried in coral sand, their feathery tentacles being alone exposed.
What they live upon is a mystery, as their intestines only contain pellets
of coral rock, which is not very nourishing to an animal which does not
secrete a shell.
Turning to the right, at the extremity of the avenue we have
traversed, it will be seen that against the northern wall of the Hall,
and upon and underneath the counter projecting from it, are to be
found many Victorian exhibits of importance. * Passing over the
great plank of cedar already referred to, the native weapons con-
tributed by the Central Board appointed to watch over the interests
of the aborigines conspicuously attract attention. They include
spears of all kinds, shields, boomerangs, waddies, stone hatchets, and
throwing-sticks. A small box, containing in miniature every


description of aboriginal weapon, and ornamented with drawings, is
an object of interest. Specimens of papers made from Victorian
fibre, a valuable collection of seeds of castor-oil and fodder plants,
charcoals from several Victorian woods, and samples of the woods
themselves, constitute a portion of the articles exhibited in this
quarter. These somewhat uninviting objects are set off by a few
stands of well-executed wax flowers, the work of Mrs. Staffe. Close
to the entrance, to which we have now returned, is placed a case
containing samples of sugar, rum, treacle, and ivory-black, the pro-
duct of the Victoria Sugar Company?s refinery at Sandridge.
An article lately brought into the Exhibition, and placed in the
furniture court, is too important a one to be passed over sub silentio.
It is a sideboard, manufactured by Mr. Peter M?Lean, cabinetmaker,
out of a fine piece of cedar, and decorated with bold carvings by
Messrs. Terlecki and Pilichowski. These are mainly symbolical of
the chief pursuits of the people of Victoria; but the indigenous
animals and plants of the colony are also largely introduced. The
work is said to have been in course of preparation for six years,
and the value of the exhibit is estimated at �I2OO.
Before leaving the main hall, we ought to state that, thanks to
the ingenuity and perseverance of Mr. Severn, of the Union Bank,
the sunlights in the lofty roof are now lighted each evening by elec-
tricity, the apparatus for the purpose being situated in a little loft
over the furniture court of Messrs. Beauchamp and Rocke. It
should also be stated that Messrs. T. Ellis and Co., the photo-
graphers to the Commissioners, have taken some excellent pictures of
the interior of the room, from various points of view, and are still
pursuing their labours in other parte of the building.
THE MACHINE ROOM.
Leaving the Main Hall by the door through which we entered it,
we find ourselves in the apartment principally devoted to the
exhibition of machinery. In a corner on our right, but not
otherwise tenanted, excepting by an umbrella stand, is a case, the
contribution of the Bible Society, containing specimens of the Bible
in no less than 46 languages. Among the rest will be observed a
copy of the sacred Scriptures in raised characters for the use of the
blind, who are taught to read by drawing the extremities of their
fingers over the page. Another interesting item of a somewhat
similar kind faces the visitor as he emerges from the Hall. This is
a stand containing pages of letterpress, and lithographs, illustrative of
the progress of the art of printing in Victoria during the last ten
years. Turning to the left now, and commencing a perambulation of
the room, we come upon a working model of a double-action wind-
lass, the value of which will readily explain itself. Messrs. Houghton


and 00. have a stand adjoining for the manufacture and embossing of
envelopes. Opposite to this stands one of the cleverest little machines
in the room?viz., Messrs. Sands and M'Dougalls railway-ticket
printing-press. This apparently serai-intelligent piece of machinery
will print, number, and, if required, perforate, railway tickets faster
than one could count them. The unprinted tickets are placed in a
sort of open iron pillar on one side of the press, whence they are
taken when the machine is set in motion, and with lightning
speed transmitted up a similar pillar on the other side, their process
of printing, <fec., completed. Should the ticket become twisted, or
the slightest derangement in the mechanism occur, the fact is signified
to the workman by the ringing of a tell-tale bell. The press is
altogether scarcely as large as an ordinary sewing-machine. Next to
the stand of Messrs. Houghton and Co. is that of Messrs. Pearson
and Co., where various operations in lithographic printing are being
performed. Upon the central table are models of different kinds
of engines, as well as other applications due to the dexterity
of local inventors. A cooking-jack, to which hangs an object which
purports to represent a piece of the ribs of beef, undertakes in one
and the same operation to baste as well as turn the joint. To effect
this, the dripping from'the beef is conducted into a well in one
corner of the under dish. Into this well descends a series of little
tin buckets, which on their ascent precipitate their contents into a
short race, the mouth of which overhangs the joint, A series of
garden knives, meat choppers, from the cutlery establishment of Mr.
Grayson, affords evidence of the progress of Victorian manufactures
in a somewhat unexpected direction. Coming next is the large
threshing, riddling, and cleaning machine of Messrs. J. Robinson
and Co., which is said to be a very perfect instrument. It, as well
as the compound-stamp battery adjoining, is impelled by one of
Dunn?s rotary reversing engines, calculated, with a supply of water
of 1| inches in diameter, to work up to four-horse power. Several
other remarkably ingenious water-power engines are here shown.
Messrs. Clarson, Massina and Co., exhibit a compact horizontal
printing-press, engaged in turning off the sheets of the Australian
Journal. Next come two knitting machines, one of them by
Messrs. Bowling and Dean, being devoted to stocking-making, and
generally doing its work so well as to attract crowds round it.
Upon the table space opposite these, and in fact in many places
throughout the room, the visitor cannot fail to regard with wonder
the numerous machines and manufactures contributed by the
Victorian Railway Department, and collected by Mr. F. C. Christie,
the locomotive superintendent. These are "of all kinds, and are
highly illustrative of the standard of excellence 'to which the works
where they originate have been advanced.
It is some years since machines for turning irregular objects?such
as shoe-lasts, wooden dolls, axe-handles, <fec. ?were invented in


America, but there are few persons who have witnessed any of them
in operation. A lathe of this kind, with certain improvements
peculiar to itself, is exhibited here. It comes from the coach and
railway-carriage factory of Mr. Williams, the present Mayor of
Melbourne, and is kept pretty actively at work, turning oft? axe-
handles of the orthodox American pattern. The slope in the handle
and the square end to fit into the blade are all executed with
astonishing rapidity as the piece of wood out of which the article is
formed revolves. This difficult?apparently almost impossible-
process is accomplished with the utmost ease, by means of a guide
placed above the cutting tool. This guide presses against a model
of the shape desired, which revolves like the wood which is being
dealt Avith. The cutting tool follows the course of the guide, and
the irregularities of shape of the model are reproduced in the article
w ? hich is being carved. A complete axe-handle is thus produced
out of a long block of timber in less than a minute. Adjoining
this lathe is a nail-making machine, Avhich has been so rarely
attempted to be set in motion that we are precluded from saying
anything about its modus operandi. A step further, and we come
to the stand occupied by one of the cigar-making firm of Messrs.
Moss, White and Co. The Avorking tools of this manipulator of
the fragrant weed are very simple, viz., ten active and skilful digits
and a sharp knife. His materials are good Havanna tobacco and a
little gum tragicum. A small table constitutes his workshop ; and
seated at this, he twists and cuts away at the leaves which Raleigh
loved and James hated, producing with ease and rapidity cigars
which, for excellence of workmanship and goodness of tobacco, may
challenge comparison with any imported ones. This brings us to
the end of the room, and, simply alluding to the fact of there being
photographs, plans, and designs in the corner for the inspection of
the curious, Ave will turn to the model of revolving shutters, erected
by an enterprising Ballarat firm, Messrs. Irving and Glover. These
are made of wood, working with a steel spring, and certainly
manifest a great improvement on the common clumsy method of
guarding shop windows. Close to these shutters is a case of
handsome brass foundry work of Mr. E. S. Banks; contiguous to
Avhich is the lathe and bench for comb-making, put up by Mr.
Emmott. Pieces of bone and tortoiseshell are being continually
turned into combs of all sizes and shapes by the dexterous
Avorkman here employed, the heating, cutting, and polishing
processes being all performed with despatch. The glass house
erected by Mr. William Evett, gold-beater, is on our left, with the
old familiar gilded sign ; and we have an opportunity of Avitnessing
what can be achieved, by persistency and a mallet, with so
ductile a metal as gold. Hard at Avork in an adjoining loom,
constructed at the Williamstown Railway Works, is a Avorkman
manufacturing long and narroAV bands of a fluffy material, used as


lubricating pads for the axle-boxes of railway carriages. This loom
was invented as well as constructed in the colony, and is said to be
an unusually perfect weaving apparatus for the purpose for which it
is designed. Several remarkable machines from the railway works
follow, including a large screw-cutting lathe, a shaping machine for
chairing castings, a hydraulic steam gauge testing machine of great
power, a lever for bending metal bars into rings, and several other
ingenious implements. A pretty model of w T hat is termed a recipro-
cating water engine is exhibited by its inventor, Mr. J. E. Lowe.
Its chief peculiarity, as compared with other water engines, is the
rapidity of its action, as it is capable of being worked up to 300
revolutions per minute. It is engaged driving one of Messrs.
Willcox and Gibbs?s challenge sewing machines, which are affirmed
to work faster and surer than any other description. Enclosures, in
which engraving and printing operations are carried on by Mr.
F, Price, Messrs. Pearson and Co., Mr. Calvert, and Messrs. Purton
and Co., occupy the remainder of the space on our left hand, if we
except a paper-ruling machine, which has not yet, we believe, been
set in operation. On the counter to our right are multitudes of
models of inventions, some of which seem feasible enough, bn;
whose value can only be gauged by practice. Among the rest are
engine-packing, spark-catchers, pumps, hooks, lifts, self-heating irons,
steam engines, and a machine for drawing corks. With respect to
the last-mentioned article, the visitor will readily conclude that if it
should fail in performing the work for which it is designed it would
not be for want of size or power.
Besides models and machinery, the room contains many photo-
graphs and drawings, and the upper portion of the walls all round
is adorned with plaster copies of the Elgin marbles.
THE NORTHERN FOUNTAIN COURT,
Into which the central door of the Machine Room leads, con-
tains two of Clayton and Shuttleworth?s portable engines,
one of which works the large fountain, or centrifugal pump, in the
centre of the court, and the other turns the shaft which gives
motion to most of the machines exhibited. The latter is of twenty
and the former of sixteen horse power, but not worked up to so
much as half its scope, the centrifugal pump only requiring for its
working five or six horse powder. The quantity, of water thrown
into the air by this imposing-looking object is equal to fifteen tons
per minute. The basin into which the water falls empties itself
back into the pump, and thus a constant circulation of the fluid is
secured.
Independent of the fountain, the chief attraction of this court
consists of the building materials exhibited in it. There are arches of


freestone from M?Gann?s quarries ; a sample of Castlemaine paving-
stone, 12 feet 6 indies by 5 feet 6 indies in dimension ; pillars of
artificial stone ; walls of brick; slabs of monumental marble; besides
specimens of stoneware and other similar goods. A fossil tree,
discovered in sinking a mining shaft, is a curiosity seldom witnessed;
and adjoining it is a freak of rocky nature from Tasmania, which
must have cost its owner some trouble before.it arrived at its present
location.
THE OCTAGON.
Entering this portion of the building by its northern doorway, and
turning to the right, we pass between Marshall?s case of cricketing
materials and the exhibits of an enterprising pyrotechnist, and come
upon some bronzed figures, turned out of hand in a creditable style by
Mr. C. H. Mende. Some good specimens of marble mantelpieces
are placed opposite to a singularly different description of work, viz.,
a knitted quilt, a snow-white comfortable-looking object, manufactured
by Miss A. O?Donovan. The medallions by Mr. Scurry, and marble
work by Mr. Yeroli, display an excellence fully up to the average of
imported articles of the kind ; and after inspecting these we come
upon an elegant case of fancy exhibits, contributed by Miss E. Woods.
Bouquets of flowers made up from shells, bronzed and plain leather work,
and other tasteful knicknacks, constitute the contents of this case.
Not far from it is a pyramid of gold ?external gold, that is?formed
on the model of the great pyramid now on its way to Paris, typifying
the amount of precious metal taken out of the claim of the United
Extended Band of Hope Company, Ballarat, from the 25th of May,
1864, when the lead was struck, to the 21st of September, 1866.
The pyramid represents 91,652 ounces. Beyond tliis is the per-
fumery case, exhibited by Messrs. Levy Bros., the Victorian agents
for Eimrael?s well-known manufacture. A great diversity of scents
and toilet requisites here find a place, while in the centre a
grotesque little fountain pours out a stream of odoriferous fluid
for the benefit of all comers. Another of Messrs. Levy Brothers?
exhibits close by is a handsome clock, on the top of which a
brilliant-plumaged bird sings in a natural and life-like way. A still
prettier object contributed by the same firm is an ornamental work-
box, elaborately fitted up, and containing withip a gilt box a yet
smaller bird, which, on a spring being touched, leaps up, flutters its
wings, and sings more excellently than the other one. These
are among the few imported articles contained in the exhibition.
The others shown by Messrs. Levy Brothers also find a place in the
octagon. They consist of a large hall-clock, with magnificent bronze
female figure, holding in her hand a patent rotary compensating
pendulum ; a musical-box, playing twelve tunes by means of barrel
and reeds, drum, castanets, and bells; and a tableau mechanique,


comprising a clock, orchestra, and dancing figures. Near this last-
mentioned object is a collection of articles made by the prisoners at
Pentridge. It includes carved work, mats, native weapons, clothes,
etc. One piece of carving, representing a small figure, is the work
of an incarcerated midshipman, who is said to have formed it with a
common penknife out of the handle of a toothbrush. The visitor
will next find himself among a perfect fleet of miniature yachts,
brigs, frigates, steamers, and rowing boats, and among the rest will
have an opportunity of inspecting a model of a floating battery
designed for the defence of Hobson?s Bay by Mr. Wilson, of the
firm of Crouch and Wilson, architects, Two marble mantelpieces,
exhibited by Messrs. Huxley, Parker and Co., are meritorious works ;
one especially, by far the less elaborate of the two, being designed
and executed with unusual skill and taste. Models of buildings in
shells and plaster, more models of ships, and the Berlin avool and
leathenvork which pretty well pervade this portion of the Exhibi-
tion, are here interrupted by a large model illustrative of life on the
goldfields, the handiwork of Gustavus Steinraeyer, of Kyneton. A
case containing Burraeister?s roller skates meets the eye here, as does
a case containing Coppin?s patent on the opposite side of the counter.
Passing many curious articles, such as a copy of Luther?s Bible,
fossil shells from Schnapper Point, bouquets of seaweed, <fec., we come
to a very beautifully made pair of assaying scales, the 'credit of
which belongs to Mr. H. Schreiber. Some figures and medallions
by Miss Thomas, and cameos by Miss Kelly, show that artistic
talent in Victoria is not confined to the male sex. A few vegetable
ivory nuts are exhibited by Mr. W. Vazie Simons, carved in
various grotesque shapes. The jewellery case shown by Mr. Crisp
contains some elegant specimens. The emeu?s egg has rarely been
turned to such artistic account as in the lamp and inkstand Mr.
Crisp exhibits. One of the noticeable objects, too, is a large
colonial diamond found at Beechworth, and mounted in a ring.
Two fine bronze figures, which, with the reduced copy of Kiss?s
? Amazon? and the colossal deer, form the collection brought from
Europe by the Hon. W. Degraves, are stationed one on each
side of the eastern entrance to the octagon. A pretty and novel
object has been attached to one of these figures?namely,
a bird cage, the bars of which are made of twisted glass. A glass
fountain, by the maker of this last-mentioned article, is also to be
seen. The spectacles exhibited by Mr. T. Gant, and the workings
in turned metal by Air. John Rettwdg, being passed, we come to
some of the finest specimens of wax flowers shown. They are the
work of Mrs. Burgoyne. A well-finished lot gf leather writing-
cases is shown by Mr. Joseph Turner, and among numerous
descriptions of fancy goods, the specimen of potichomonie, by
Mrs. Lusher, and of needlework, by Mrs. Claridge, are sure
to attract notice. In the midst of ornaments and bijouterie, it


is curious to see two cases containing various kinds of surgical
bandages and supports. The castings in bronze, iron, and' zinc,
shown by Mr. D. Livingstone, are far in advance of anything of the
kind previously achieved in the colony, as are also the scagliola
mantelpieces and pillars by Mr. T. A. Dunn. Among the colonial
industries to be noticed, watch-cases made of Victorian gold and
silver, water monkeys and jugs, miallwood pipes, stock-whip handles,
&c., are shown in this apartment. The cases of jewellery and
silverwork are full of interesting objects. Mr. W. Edwards shows
epergnes of most tasteful workmanship ; Messrs. Kilpatrick and Co.
exhibit sets of jewellery rich with brilliants, as well as a large silver
cup intended for a racing prize ] and Messrs. Walsh Brothers have,
besides other articles of value, two massive silver cups, the one for
the Gippsland meeting, the other offered by Messrs. J. Levy and
Sons as a prize for the best growth of Silesian beet. A model of
a kangaroo in silver, by Julius Hogarth, is a true work of art, as is
also the leaf watch in Mr. J. Powell?s gold case. Mr. H. Newman
has a handsome case of gold chains, and Mr. Spink, the lapidary,
shows a multitude of fine colonial gems. The spiral wood turning
by Messrs. Roberts and Ford proves that the most difficult kind of
work can be accomplished in this colony. An etching on charred
wood by a miner named Leaf is possessed of some merit. It is in
juxtaposition to a frame carved in wood by Kern Wah, the Chinese
carver ?a complicated piece of work, but far less so than the
altar-piece which it has replaced. There are several dental exhibits,
the best arranged being that of Mr. Charles Lange, who has
managed to make the articles of his calling look attractive in spite
of their teeth. The centre of the Octagon is occupied by a case
filled with a bewildering posy of paper flowers, the work of Mrs.
Staffe. The visitor before leaving this apartment should not forget
to scrutinise the decorations of the dome, which, although painted
on rough wood by the decorative artist, Mr. E. J. Bateman, are
surpassingly clear and beautiful.
THE ANNEXE.
Straight across the Main Hall, and we come to the entrance to
the Annexe, a corrugated iron structure added at the eleventh hour,
when the proportions the Exhibition was likely to reach began to
disclose themselves. The passage leading to this spacious erection
is principally devoted to the Victorian grain and meal, samples of
which are shown in tasteful cases of Huon pine and glass on each
side of it. Near the Hall on the right hand is the Board of Agri-
culture?s collection of analyses of soils, with the constituents of each
written inside the bottles containing them. On the left-hand side
are some large beet grown by Mr. Orlebar, 12-| acres of land having
yielded 500 tons. In addition to the things already enumerated, the


passage contains brushes, by Messrs. Stone and Zeveuboom, cheeses,
native weapons and drawings, and guano. Advancing to the Annexe,
we come first to the coals of New South Wales and Tasmania,
arranged so as to illustrate the seam where discovered; also, the shale
of the former colony, and the product thereof, kerosene, The piece
of cabinet work in which Messrs. Macmeikan and Co. have enshrined
their bone manure stands close by, and is a curiosity well worth
inspection. Adjoining this, Messrs. Gough and Co. show samples
of their malt, white and black. The firm turn out some 700 bushels
a-week, and are gradually getting the better of the imported article.
Proceeding down the right centre we have carriages to the right of
us, to the left of us, and in front of us, like the light brigade at
Balaclava, with this difference, that our carriages have no guns on
them. The whole are most creditable articles. They emanate from
the factories of Messrs. Stevenson and Elliott, Mr. W. Williams,
Messrs, Miller Bros., Messrs. M'Gregor and Agilew, Mr. H.
Samwells, Mr. R. Miller, Mr. W. Crutch, Mr. J. Hackett, and Mr.
F. Goernemann, of Melbourne ; Mr. W. Carpenter, of Geelong ; and
Messrs. Cutter and Lever, of Ballarat. Street cabs are shown by
Messrs. Maynard and Fisher, Mr. Hackett, and Mr. Andrew Elliott,
of Melbourne, and Mr. W. Proctor, of Ballarat. Among the larger
exhibits, a glance at which discloses the mode of their working, are
the wine-presses, wool-presses, grape mills, &c., contributed
by Mr. J. W. Horne, Messrs. T. Robinson and Co., and Messrs.
Fulton and Shaw. Passing out into the wing of the Annexe,
one of the first things to catch the eye is the copper still, made by Mr.
Nitschke, of Adelaide, out of which spirit sixty degrees over proof has
been readily obtained. It is said to be capable of distilling GOO
gallons per tw T elve hours. Contiguous to the still, a self-heating bath,
generally in operation, will be found to be a most useful invention.
Without taking up more room than an ordinary bath, it contains a
cistern of water and a furnace for making the water hot. The
corner to the left has been termed Volunteer Corner, inasmuch as it
contains all the materials for instructing a military neophyte?guns
of all kinds; shot, whole and in segments; shells, canister, grape,
together with photographs taken in English gunneries and arsenals.
The large guns are placed outside in the enclosure, where the flower-
show tents are erected, and where Messrs. Robinson and Co.?s mill
is the most conspicuous object. Cartridges, fusees, and ammunition,
Victorian made, form part of the collection to which we have just
referred; and as there is generally an artilleryman present capable
of imparting the fullest information, the inquiring visitor cannot do
better than attend to his discourse. The heavy timber from the
neighbouring colonies, agricultural implements, tind things of that
kind, are placed in this wing of the Annexe. With the machinery
here, not far from the gun stand, is Mr. Enoch Chambers?s patent
stone-breaker.


Turning once more into the Annexe, and proceeding to the right
hand to make the circuit of the building, we come to a sufficiency of
manufactures to prove the advances the colony is rapidly making.
In this way?Victorian made and generally Victorian material?we
meet with Venetian blinds, sun blinds, machine-made doors and
sashes, life-boats, coloured rock-work hangings, chaff cutters, earth
closets, canvas buckets, hoses, and filters, japanned goods with
colonial scenes illustrated on them, gas reflectors, manures, zinc
and brass work, galvanised iron goods, axes? head as well as
handle home-made ?patent beehives, basketwork of the most
elaborate description, ropes and rope cables, iron bedsteads,
life belts, dressed Hax, scoured wool, curled woodwork in
infinite variety, cooking ranges of gigantic size and first-class
finish, stoves for wine mulling, composing frames and printing
presses, fire-proof safes, churns, oak wine-casks of 400 and
500 gallons, candle machines, silk flour-dressers, perambulators, race
boats, lead piping and flooring, wire work, coach springs, cutlery,
and agricultural implements of all sorts. A tour round this Annexe
absolutely introduces us one after another to all these things, and at
last we come to an imported piece of machinery, the printing press
with which Mr. J. P. Fawkner turned off the first newspaper printed
in Port Phillip?a relic of the past, and a most antiquated looking
affair. Less than thirty years ago this clumsily-constructed instru-
ment was brought here to enlighten the settlers; now all the
ingenious things around are made in the colony by the men who
have settled here. It is a notable fact.
Passing out of the Annexe, we turn to the left down the Main
Hall, and come to a long apartment forming the southern wing of
the building, and known as
THE PICTURE GALLERY.
In referring briefly to the contents of this room, it is not our
purpose to attempt any criticism of the pictures, still less to
endeavour to notice all the works of art exhibited. We shall
merely indicate the position of some of the more remarkable, and
allude to the general arrangement of the collection. The room is
divided by screens into ten compartments, the whole of the space on
the walls and screens within convenient range of the eye being
covered with paintings, drawings, photographs, Ac. As in most
picture galleries, a railing has been erected round the room at a
little distance from the wall, and the space between the two has
been happily turned to account for the display of the magnificent
gathering of Australian seaweeds, ferns, land and marine shells,
insects, birds? eggs, etc., contributed by Mr. and Mrs. H. E. Pain?a
collection which constitutes in itself no mean museum of curiosities.
At the end of the room where we enter, the most conspicuous


object (next to the large painted cartoon, which some people are said
to admire) is a handsome case of stuffed birds, exhibited by Mr. W.
Woods. The mounting of these beautiful specimens has been taste-
fully effected, so as to lend as natural an appearance to the collection
as possible. Not far from these winged curiosities is an interesting
case of Dr. Bleasdale?s, showing the apparatus made use of by
mineralogists and others in blow-pipe investigations. Turning now
to the exhibits for which the apartment is set apart, we find the first
screen, or partition, covered with the Geological Survey maps, and
the second and third chiefly devoted to illuminated writings, litho-
graphs, chromo-lithographs, and photographs. On side walls, screens,
and in cases between the screens, are photographs upon photographs,
their name being legion. The large-sized views of forest scenery
by Mr. Cornell are not likely to be hastily passed over,
nor those of the Sandridge and Williamstown shipping by Mr.
Eider. On the southern wall are suspended a large number
of portraits by Perry, Davis, and other photographers. Among
those of the former, a coloured likeness of a Scotch terrier,
who, it seems, rejoices in the name of ? Tom Sayers,? makes
a most life-like and telling picture ; some of Mr. Perry?s cartes
de visite are also conspicuous for their admirable tone and
finish. A truthful likeness in- colours of Miss Cleveland
as Leah is exhibited in Mr. Davies?s collection, near a won-
derfully clear photograph by Nettletou of that marvel' of wood
carving, the Chinese altar-piece, which during the early days of the
Exhibition was on view in the Octagon, but which now adorns the
Joss-house at Emerald Hill. The elegant crayon drawings and
plaster castings presented by the Government of Italy to the Vic-
torian Board of Education will attract the notice of the visitor at an
early stage of his perambulation. Their.merit is beyond cavil. Of
portrait photographs, Messrs. Johnstone, O?Shannessy and Co. pre-
sent several admirable ones of large size, and prepared so as greatly
to resemble mezzotint engravings. They will be found on the
northern wall of the room, not far from the entrance. A little
further on, in the fifth compartment formed by the screens, Messrs,
Batchelder and Co. have their exhibits, comprising among others a
life-sized picture of Judge Barry, and a series of full-length portraits
of the Governors of Victoria, from Latrobe downwards. Another
series by the same firm, which is deservedly attractive, represents
Mr. Lambert, the comedian, in some of his best characters. Facing
Batchelder?s photographs is a large number of drawings in coloured
crayons and sepia by Mrs. Naylor. They represent clusters of fruit,
heads of game, rabbits, and the like, and are depicted with remark-
able fidelity; some copies of old engravings .painted on linen in


division Messrs. T. Ellis and Co. exhibit for sale copies of the
photographs they have taken of different portions of the Exhibition.
Some of the finest paintings of local artists are to be found in this
portion of the gallery. The eastern side is occupied by the produc-
tions of Clarke, Gritten, and others, M. Guerard?s graphic illus-
trations of Australian scenery meet the eye when turned to the
north. On the southern wall hangs the prize picture of M. Cheva-
lier, representing ? The Buffalo Ranges,? Gippsland ; while on the
western side are to be seen a series of admirable studies from the
pencil of M. Buvelot, an artist who has but recently taken up his
sojourn in Melbourne. Against the northern wall, in the succeeding
compartment, hang the New Zealand water-colour drawings, by Mr.
Gully, which have met with such general appreciation here ; and
contiguous to them is placed a well-known picture by Mr. H. E.
Davies, representing a scene in the neighbourhood of Launceston.
A very beautiful English water-colour sketch, said to be by Turner,
is placed close to Mr. Gully?s productions. It represents a simple
poetical scene, but the details are admirably worked out. Charac-
teristic sketches by Gill, Burrand, and others, face some capital
crayon drawings by Mdme.Vieusseux and some of her pupils. Beneath
the latter, a pen-and-ink copy of an engraving from one of Landseer?s
paintings forms a conspicuous feature. The subject is the noble
Newfoundland dog, termed ?A Distinguished Member of the Humane
Society,? and it owes its existence to the amateur, but by no means
unpractised, hand of Mr. E. L. Montefiore. The next compartment
is filled with some of the fine series of water-colour sketches which
constitute the magnificent result of M. Chevaiier?s New Zealand
tour. Paintings, mostly of European origin, fill up the two remaining
divisions of the room, the full-length life-size pictures of the Prince
and Princess of Wales, recently added, proving a great attraction.
The principal portion of these imported works were purchased for
the Victorian Art Commission, and have been exhibited for many
months in the art gallery of the Public Library. Many of these are
of a high order of merit, and copies of them, as might be expected,
have been made by local artists. One of these, by Miss Thomas, a
copy of ? Le Depart du Fiance,? is exhibited in the gallery, together
with original works both in painting and sculpture from the hand of
this talented young lady. At the western end of the gallery is a
room devoted to the exhibition of architectural designs, all of which
will be found worthy of inspection. Most of our leading archi-
tectural firms are represented.
THE BASEMENT.
From the Picture Gallery the visitor will readily discover there is
a facile descent to the shades below, where the genius of Messrs.
Ellis and Hodgson reigns supreme. No guide is needed to direct to


the tempting viands which these enterprising caterers set forth in one
of the coolest dining halls in the Southern hemisphere. If the great
business of life be to dine, persons attending the Exhibition have
good reason afforded them why they should not neglect it.
Although a great part of the basement is devoted to the Baron of
Beef and his belongings, it is not actually bereft of exhibits, as the
enterprising visitor will find on approaching the remote extremity of
it, where there are apartments filled with wines, beers, and cured
meats, sent in for competition. About these we have nothing further
to write than that they are said to contain samples of rare quality,
upon which, however, the judges must be left to report. Flights of
steps from the Basement lead to
THE SOUTHERN FOUNTAIN COURT,
Which has been laid out very prettily with plants and grass, seats
and statues surrounding the tasteful fountain constructed of marble
by Signor Yeroli. Here, as well as in the Northern Court, a circle
of lights has been placed around the fountain, so that after dark an
excellent effect is produced. Among the objects of taste in this
court, the bronze figures of deer contributed by Mr. Degraves are of
a particularly imposing character, and add greatly to the elegant
appearance of the place.
The southern entrance to the Octagon is approached from this
direction, and arriving at it we terminate our circuit of an exhibi-
tion which would prove an attraction in any part of the earth, but
is a truly marvellous achievement when it is remembered that it
takes place in a colony which at the first great English Exhibition
was not of sufficient importance to be recognised even by name.
