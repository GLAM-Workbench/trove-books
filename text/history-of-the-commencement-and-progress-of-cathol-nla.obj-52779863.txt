TO
THE BISHOP OF BIRMINGHAM,
RIGHT REVEREND
WILLIAM B. ULLATHORNE, O.S.B.
To YOU, my dear Lord, I dedicate these pages, in which I have
endeavoured to narrate the commencement and progress of
Catholicity in Australia. I know no one to whom in preference
I could commend this small production. Several of those great
and distinguished missionaries who laboured with you so
successfully in cultivating this new portion of the Lord’s vineyard
in Australia, have gone to their rest; and amongst them,
Archbishop Folding; he with whom you were united in heart
and mind, whilst you were his Vicar-General in Australia. Your
zeal and labours under his auspices changed the condition of the
Catholic Church in Australia. By your writings you informed
Europe of the restraints of the catholics in this far distant land,
and their spiritual destitution; and you travelled in all parts to
obtain an abundant supply of priests. You brought from the
Colleges and Universities of Ireland and the Continent hands of
zealous and enlightened missionaries, who spread the faith
everywhere, and covered the land with churches.* You exposed
the inhuman treatment of your fellow man, by those who were
in power, and greatly contributed to the amelioration of his
unfortunate condition. By your pen and words you silenced the
enemies of our holy faith, and reduced them to reason.
I lie under the deepest obligation to you. The young men
whom you were preparing for the priesthood, were singularly
favoured, of whom I was one. You spared no pains to develope
our minds, by imparting to us the rich stores of philosophical and
historical knowledge with which your luminous and acute mind
was supplied. Many years have passed since you bade farewell to
the Australian shores ; but never ought the Catholic Church of
Australia forget those days when, in all the vigour of your great
intellect, you laboured so earnestly and incessantly for her
welfare.




PREFACE.
The object I had in view in writing the history of Catholic
events in Australia, was to correct the mistaken notions in the
minds of many, in regard to our history, and to reduce them to
something like chronological order; and to show the wonderful
progress of Catholicity in Australia in such a short time. I have
been witness of many events recorded in the history. I came to
the colony in the year 1835, with Bishop Bolding, as an ecclesias-
tical student: it will soon be fifty years ago; and I was not
unobservant of what was passing. I was ordained a priest with four
others, by Archbishop Bolding, in the year 1843, and have
laboured ever since on the Australian Mission.
I am mainly indebted for the principal facts and events of
the early history, to a small pamphlet of Dr. Ullathorne’s, entitled,
“ Catholic Mission in Australasia ”; and I have inserted an
abridgement of his able reply to Judge Burton, one of the judges
of the colony. I have carefully looked over the copies which
remain of the old Government Gazette, and have perused many
other papers, books, and periodicals, for catholic information. I
must express my thankfulness to Mr. Halley and his assistants,
of the Bublic Library, for their readiness in getting for me the
books which I required. I have given some Colonial History


connected with the events, which will enable -the reader to
remember better what occurred. Ido not pretend to brilliancy
of style, hut I have adhered strictly to the truth in the narration
of facts.
The extraordinary efforts and zeal of Father Therry, after-
wards Archpriest, for the preservation of the faith, are not passed
over, hut portrayed with all fidelity ; and the trials of Archpriest
Flynn, and his expulsion from the colony by the Government, are
detailed with all the particulars. Nor are the great labours of
Archdeacon McEnroe unnoticed.
I intend the History to consist of two volumes, octavo, and I
would have had the second volume ready now for publication,
only a very severe attack of acute rheumatism, extending over
three years, has prevented me from arranging the materials which
I have collected.
The present book contains a complete narration of Catholic
facts and events up to the year 1840, when Bishop Folding left
Australia the first time for Europe. If this History gives
satisfaction to the catholic public, I shall lose no time in getting
the second volume published.
The year of our Lord, eighteen hundred and thirty-five, was
a year memorable in the annals of the Catholic Church of
Australia, for on the 13th of September of that year, arrived in
Sydney the first catholic bishop of those colonies, the Right Rev.
John Bede Folding. He came appointed by the successor of St.
Feter, Gregory XYL, and intrusted with extraordinary powers to


superintend the spiritual interests of Christ’s church in these
parts; to direct her energies for the glory of God and the salvation
of souls. His labours extended over a period of about forty-two
years, during which time his strenuous exertions in the cause of
our holy faith abundantly testify to the wisdom, zeal and
prudence with which he superintended the holy work committed
to his care. The purpose of this History is not only to show the
wonderful progress of Catholicity during the Pontificate of the
Right Rev. Dr. Folding, but its commencement with the first
catholics and the first priests who arrived in the colony.
I commence the History by giving an account of the discovery
of this great South Land. It is interesting to know when
Providence directed the helm of the mariner to the shores of this
Great Island Continent, destined by our Lord to be a field where
souls were to be saved and his praise and glory promoted.

A HISTORY
OF THE
COMMENCEMENT & PROGRESS OF CATHOLICITY
IN AUSTRALIA,
UP TO THE YEAR 1840.
CHAPTER I.
The Opinions of the Ancients in regard to the Great Austral
Land.—The Spanish Navigators.—Fernandez de Quiros.
Spanish Navigator, supposed by many the discoverer of
Australia, in 1606.—The Dutch landed early in Australia.
The famous Buccaneer, Dampier, visited Australia, 1688.
Captain Cook sighted Australia 18th April, 1770.
Australia is the largest island in the world; it is situated to the
south of the Malay Archipelago, and lies between the Indian and
Pacific Oceans. It extends from latitude 10° 40" South to 39° 15"
South, and from longitude 113° 20" to 153° 20" East. In length
from East to West it is 2,400 miles, and breadth from North to
South, it varies from 1,600 to 1,900 miles. The area of Australia
is computed at three millions of square miles. It may not
improperly be termed a continent.
This great Austral Land, it is believed by many, was known
to exist by the ancients before the Christian era. Strabo, an
eminent geographer, who flourished fifty years before Christ,
mentions in his writings a large island which lay to the South-
east of India, and stretched far towards the West. Pliny (A.D. 77)
refers to a great island lying to the South of the Equator.
B


Ptolemy Claudius, celebrated as a geographer, who lived in the
year of our Lord 150, states that from a great bay, 8° South, the
land turned to the West and stretched to an unknown distance.
The celebrated Venetian traveller, Marco Polo, visited the Indian
Archipelago in the year 1293, and remained on the island of
Lesser Java for live months, with the expedition fitted out by
the Great Mogul, Emperor, Kublai Khan. He states that 700
miles from that island there was a country called Lochse, which
formed part of a great mainland. In the 14th century a Catholic
missionary appears to have visited Java, and whilst there he
heard of a great country which stretched so far to the South
that its extreme regions, for several months in the year, were
enveloped in darkness. For upwards of 200 years after Marco
Polo’s time no mention is made of the supposed island or continent
lying to the South, except by this Christian missionary. From
these testimonies, there can be little doubt but that some .maritime
adventurers in those early times had seen and coasted the shores
of Australia ; but their notions must have been very vague as to
whether it was a continent or an island.
An attempt was made by the Spanish Navigator, Alvaro
Mendana de Neyra, in 1568, to discover the great South Land
which had been so much spoken about. He sailed from Callao,
in Peru, and held a course due West for nearly 4,500 miles, when
he discovered the Soloman Isles. This group is in the latitude
of Torres’ Straits. Afterwards, during another voyage, in the
year 1595, he was the discoverer of the Marquisas Islands; but
he failed in finding the great Austral Land he was in search of.
Mendana died on the voyage, and was succeeded in the command
by his pilot, Fernandez de Quiros, who soon returned to Lima, in
South America. Quiros became quite enthusiastic about the
discovery of the great South Land; he maintained there must be
a great country undiscovered lying to the South. He prevailed
by his arguments with Phillip 111. of Spain, who supplied him
with three vessels for another expedition. Quiros was appointed
Chief in command, and the second commander was Luis Vaez de
Torres, a Spanish Navigator of great ability. The discovery
fleet sailed from Lima, in South America, on the 20th of December,
1605, in the direction of West by South. The island of Tahiti
was discovered by Quiros on 10th February, 1606, and on the
26th April he saw land which he believed to be the great South
Land, and he named it Terra Austral del Espiritu Santo—the
South Land .of the Holy Spirit. N otwithstanding the persever-
ance and courage of Quiros, he is denied the honor of having
discovered the great Austral Land; for many say that he mistook


for it the group of islands known now by the name of the New
Hebrides. Quiros, on account of disputes with his officers, loss
of men, and sickness, was compelled to return to South America,
before he had ascertained the extent and character of the islands
which he had discovered. He reached Acapulco nine months after
his departure. His companion, Torres, continuing to sail westward,
in the latitude of the Straits, passed safely through those waters,
which divide Australia from New Guinea. The straits have been
called after him, Torres’ Straits. He, Torres, sighted the main-
land at the most northern point, viz., Cape York, but took it for
a group of islands. When Quiros returned, he laid a memorial of
his discoveries before the King of Spain, and mentioned twenty-
three islands which he had discovered, together with “certain
parts of a country which he believed was a portion of the
Australian mainland.”
About this time —the beginning of the 17th
Dutch were very persevering in their endeavours to discover the
great South Land, which was so much spoken about throughout
Europe. They maintain having landed on the Australian shores
a few days before Quiros, if he did not mistake the New Hebrides
for a part of the mainland of Australia.
It is difficult to suppose that a skilled navigator, such as
Quiros was, would take three comparatively small islands for the
mainland; he had been in those seas before in search of the great
Austral Land, and had only recently discovered the island of
Tahiti. My conviction is, with many, that he sighted the
Australian Land; but the difficulties he had with his officers and
crew prevented him from landing and surveying the coast.
The Dutch had wrested from the Portuguese the richest of
the islands in the Indian Archipelago, and they lost no time in
trying to ascertain the extent and riches of this great South Land.
By the year 1622 they had surveyed nearly the whole of the
Western Coast, and, in the year 1664, they gave the name of New
Holland to the great discovery. It was in the year 1642* that Yan
Dieman’s Land was discovered by Abel Jansen Tasman ; but he
thought it was a part of Australia, connected with the mainland.
There is no account of any one having visited the shores of
New Holland or Yan Dieman’s Land for fifty years after the
discovery of Abel Jansen Tasman. When the famous English
buccaneer Dampier, visited the Island Continent, no doubt in
quest of plunder, he landed on the western coast the sth January,
* Abel Jansen Tasman during the same voyage discovered New Zealand
December, 1642,


1688, in latitude 16° 50" South. The ship commanded by him
was named the Cygnet. He remained in this place whilst the
vessel was re-fitted. He had some intercourse with the natives,
whom he considered a very inferior race; nor did he form a very
high opinion of the country which they inhabited. The locality
where he landed was extremely barren and uninviting:
Dampier, notwithstanding the unfavorable appearance of the
country, must have taken a deep interest in the Great
South Land, and he was not content with the partial view
which he had obtained. He hoped, we may surmise, like others,
to make a rich discovery on her shores, which would reward him
for his pains, and give glory to England. He changed his colours,
and through the patronage of his friend Lord Oxford, was
appointed by King William 111. to the command of an old ship
of war, the Roebuck : in this vessel he left England in the year
1699, for Australia, and reached the western coast at Shark’s
Bay, latitude 25° South, on the 6th August of the same year.
He does not appear to have surveyed any part of the coast; he
remained only a few days at Shark’s Bay and then put out to
sea again: he went no further south, but steered north, touching
at several places between Shark’s Bay and Cape Bougainville;
then he bore up to the island of Timor, and after that visited New
Guinea. He visited many parts of this interesting island, and
surveyed the coast. Dampier discovered many bays, capes, and
channels on the coasts of New Holland and New Guinea, and they
bear the names which he gave them. One hundred years
transpired after the visit of Dampier to Australia before any
settlement was formed on her shores, and this probably happened
in consequence of the unfavourable account given by Dampier
of the Great South Land.*
Captain Cook was the next after Dampier who conducted an
exploratory expedition to the South Seas. He was selected by
the English Government as the best qualified to make it certain
as to whether there was a Great Southern Continent; although
it is strange how Cook, or the English Government, could have
any doubt about what had been made so certain by the discovery
of the Spanish navigator Quiros, and by the Dutch. Captain
Cook placed no reliance on the statements made by Quiros and
the other navigators, that there was a Great South Land or
Continent which they had seen, but attempted to prove they
were mistaken in supposing that a Continent existed to the north
of 40° of South latitude. Nor does it redound to his credit, when
* Vide ; Dampier’s Voyages.


he was convinced of the correctness of the reports and accounts
of those grand old navigators, not to acknowledge his indebtedness
to their skill and daring. But we do not wish to detract from
the everlasting merit of Captain Cook, since to him we are
indebted for the knowledge of the extent of Australia, the nature
of the soil on the coast, and its adaptability for settlement.
Captain Cook had only one vessel under his command, named the
Endeavour, and only of 350 tons burden. His companions were
Mr. Banks (afterward Sir Joseph), Mr. Solander, a Swede and a
pupil of the celebrated Linnaeus ; they accompanied the expedition
as naturalists ; Mr. Green as astronomer, Mr. Buchan as draughts-
man, and Mr. Parkenson as painter. The Endeavour left
Plymouth on 26th August, 1768. Several islands in the Pacific
Ocean were discovered by Captain Cook during his first voyage,
and he staid for some time at New Zealand and then sailed for
Australia ; he sighted land at the southern extremity of Australia
on the 18th April, 1770. He called the point of land which was
first seen Point Hicks : it received this name from his lieutenant,
Hicks, who was the first to obtain the sight of it. The Endeavour
put in to Botany Bay, and there Captain Cook saw the natives
for the first time, some of whom resisted his landing. At the
spot to the south of the bay, where it is supposed the Great
Navigator landed, a tablet has been erected on a projecting rock.
In 1821 the Philosophical Society of Australia was established, and
the President, the then Governor, Sir Thomas Brisbane, instituted
enquiries among the Botany Bay natives to ascertain the exact
spot where Captain Cook landed. After great difficulty a hoary-
headed old Botany native stated that he saw the big ships arrive,
the boats land the Chief of the party —a man with a big hat, —
Captain Cook jump ashore, and that he could point out the exact
spot. His account tallied with Captain Cook’s historical records.
The Governor and the Society firmly believed he was a reliable
witness, and they organized an excursion to the landing place on
Wednesday, March 20th, 1822. The excursionists proceeded from
the north to the south side of Botany Bay, and the old white-
headed native pointed out the rock on which Captain Cook landed.
On a bold rock was fixed a brazen plate whereon was engraved
the following inscription:—“ A.H. MDCCLXX., under the auspices
of British Science, these shores were discovered by James Cook
and Joseph Banks—the Columbus and Mecsenas of their time.
This spot once saw them ardent in the pursuit of knowledge;
now to their memory, this tablet is inscribed, in the first year of
the Philosophical Society of Australia, Sir Thomas Brisbane,
K.C.8., F.R.S.S. and E , (Corresponding Member of the Institute
5


of France,) President. AD. MDCCCXXI.” This tablet was
soldered about 25 feet from the level of the sea, on the face of the
most remarkable rock in the vicinity. The Society then, in a
natural arbour close by, drank to the immortal fame of the
illustrious men whose discoveries they were there met to com-
memorate. The inscription on the tablet has not been obliterated
by time; but it is somewhat overcast with branches of plants
growing out of the fissures of the rocks. It is believed that
Captain Cook landed on a beach near the rock, which corresponds
with the account given in his journals, and that the rock was the
most convenient place for affixing the tablet. Close by is a
remarkable opening in the rocks by which the natives gained
access to the elevated ground. The Hon, Thomas Holt has
erected a monument on what he regards as the exact spot where
Cook stepped on shore, and a flight of steps to very high land, for
extensive views, has been cut near the spot.
When Captain Cook left Botany Bay he continued to survey
the coast to the north for 2000 miles, that is to Cape York,
the extreme point of the Australian Continent; and the time
spent in coasting to the north was four months, during which time
he discovered all the principal bays and harbours.
Captain Cook in his journal thus ends his account of New
South Wales.—“As I was now about to quit the eastern coast of
New Holland, which I had coasted from latitude 38 degrees south
to this place (Gape York), latitude 10J° South, and which I am
confident no European had ever seen before, I once more hoisted
English colours; and although I had already taken possession of
several particular parts, I now took possession of the whole
eastern coast, in right of his Majesty King George the Third, by
the name of New South Wales, with all the bays, harbours, and
islands situated upon it. We then fired three volleys of small
arms, which were answered by the same number from the
ship.” —Captain Cook’s Journal.
Had it been given to this great English navigator to see into
the future, when the waters over which the keel of the Endeavour
was the first to pass, carrying on their bosom ships laden with gold
and rich merchandise of every kind, going to and from her shores ;
to see the coast, where he only saw the wild Aborigine, taken up
by civilized man; the land richly cultivated in many parts,
yielding abundantly, and covered with cities and towns. What
more could he have desired !

CHAPTER II.
The causes which led to the foundation of the Colony.—Captain
Arthur Phillip of the Royal Navy, selected by the Home
Government to be the first Governor of the New Colony. —
The landing of the Colonists.—The Inauguration of the
Government, 7th February, 1788.—The Governor’s Speech.
— Two French Discovery ships anchor in Botany Bay. —
The death of the Priest, Pere Receveur. —The resignation
of Governor Phillip.
The discovery of the eastern coast of Australia was made by
Captain Cook in the year 1770 ; but it was seventeen years
afterwards when the Colony of New south Wales was established
by the British Government, in the year 1788. It happened in
this wise:—The attention of the Home Government was drawn
to select the shores of Australia for the foundation of a colony
from the favourable account given by Captain Cook in the
published narrative of his voyage. In all probability no settle-
ment would have been made at this time, had it not been that the
Government wanted a distant place to send her criminals. The
jails throughout Great Britain were crowded with prisoners,
because they could no longer be sent to the plantations in
America. The Americans were victorious in the war of Inde-
pendence, and would not allow any more traffic in white slaves.
The convicts had been sold to the Planters of Virginia, and been
sent to toil in the burning heat of the Barbadoes and other places.
An account is given in Dr. Langard’s History of England, vol,
xi, p. 145, that, during the Protectorate, 70 persons were sold at
the Barbadoes for looOlbs. of sugar each. Among- them were
n o
divines, officers and gentlemen, who were represented as grinding
at the mills, attending the furnaces, and digging in that scorching
island, whipped at whipping-posts, and sleeping in sties, worse off
than the hogs in England. These were persons obnoxious to the
Government, being bought and sold from one Planter to another.
In the time of Charles 11. there were sold, of those who had taken
part in the rebellion of Monmouth, 849 persons, to the Planters
of Jamaica. “The Mayor, Aldermen and Justices of Bristol
were accustomed to transport convicted criminals to the American
plantations and sell them by way of trade. Now, the English
nation abhors such inhuman conduct as that of one man selling
his fellow-man for gain ; but it is most humiliating to think that
the great in the land at one time sold their Christian brother as
they would a piece of merchandise.” — Samuel Sydney—Three
Colonies, p. 22.

The English Government came to the resolution, some time
after the voyage of Captain Cook, to send her criminals to that
island continent, lately re-discovered, and the coasts of which had
been so favourably described by that illustrious navigator. The
place selected for location was Botany Bay, situated on the eastern
coast. In coming to this determination the first object was to
clear out the jails and houses of correction, and send the prisoners
beyond the seas, to where they would be as little trouble as
possible to the parent country. The second object was, which is
evident from the great preparations made, to secure this great
South Land by founding a colony, which might in course of time
compensate for the loss of her American possessions.
The Order for the establishment of a Settlement in New
South Wales was issued by the Executive Council on 6th Dec.,
1786. The Government selected Captain Arthur Phillip, of the
Royal Navy, to conduct the expedition, and to be the Governor
and Commander-in-Chief of New South Wales; and offi'cers were
appointed under him for the different departments, both military
and civil. When the expedition for the new colony embarked,
they numbered 1044 persons ; hut 14 died during the voyage;
thus 1030 landed in New South Wales. The persons belonging
to the expedition were distinguished:—Civil Officers 10; the
Military, including Officers, 212; wives and families of the
Officers, 28 women and 17 children; other free persons 81; the
prisoners amounted to 696 : in all there were 348 free persons and
696 convicts.
When making preparations for this exodus the spiritual
wants of the bond or free were not taken into consideration of the
unfortunate men destined to people this desert land. What ought
to have been thought of in the first instance was left to the last.
No minister of religion or schoolmaster was appointed to instruct
the ignorant. Before the fleet sailed a Protestant Bishop
charitably reminded them of the omission, and then the Rev.
Richard Johnson was appointed chaplain. Such conduct of the
then Government merits great reproach not to think of
supplying those unhappy beings with the means of religious
instruction and consolation. Is it not the duty of a Christian
Government to endeavour, by providing ministers of religion, to
raise the fallen ? otherwise what is it better than the heathen
rulers of Greece and Rome ?
The fleet, consisting of one frigate, the “ Sirius,” with a
tender, three store ships, and six transports, set sail on 13th May,
1787. It had a prosperous voyage and touched at several ports
on the way —at Cape de Yerd Islands, Rio Janerio, and Cape of
8


Good Hope, where they were kindly received and their wants
supplied. They arrived at Botany Bay 20th January, 1788.
When Governor Phillip examined the land near the hay he came
to the conclusion that it was unsuitable for a Settlement. Some
of the people were allowed to go ashore and they began to clear
the land, but found the surrounding parts not adapted for
occupation. The bay, although spacious, was found to be shallow,
and not safe from the easterly gales, and the shores were low and
swampy. No debarcation of the people in general took place, and
no Settlement was formed.
Governor Phillip, having manned three boats, proceeded to
explore the coast to the north, and when examining Jackson’s
Bay, as laid down in Captain Cook’s chart, he entered the Heads,
and discovered a magnificent harbour, deep, wide, and land-locked
on all sides, the shores high and richly wooded. He sailed round
the bays in the spacious harbour and selected a cove where flowed
a clear spring from the rocks, which was afterward called Sydney
Cove. The fleet, which consisted of eleven sail, was ordered to
sail for Port Jackson on 26th January, 1788: it entered the
Heads and sailed down the harbour to the cove selected by
Governor Phillip and there cast anchor. On the second day the
debarkation took place, which was made with some formality.
The first who landed was a detachment of Marines and some
Blue Jackets. There were a great many of the Aborigines on the
shore when they landed, and they seemed disposed to defend their
country against the intruders. The natives were armed with
spears and shields and bomerangs : they were quite naked; but
through the conciliatory conduct of the Governor and officers, and
seeing no doubt that a far superior force was opposed to them,
they submitted and laid down their arms. The natives on this
occasion showed more bravery and natural intelligence than at
first they got credit for. The number of Settlers who then landed
were one thousand and thirty souls: during the voyage the
expedition had lost fourteen persons.
The first colonists of New South Wales being safely landed,
after having been delivered from the perils of the sea, and having
traversed 16,000 miles of water, we do not find them manifesting
gratitude to the Almighty for His protection; they did not
assemble around the cross—the symbol of our redemption—and
chant the Te Deum in thanksgiving ; no : but that same evening,
when the Royal Standard was erected, the Governor with his
officers assembled round and drank the King’s health and success
to the Settlement.

It was in the vicinity of the Sydney Cove, 7th February,
1788, that a portion of the ground was cleared for habitation: it
was laborious work, for the land was thickly timbered to the
water’s edge, and there were gigantic trees : the sound of the axe
reverberated for the first time in that primeval forest and soon
fell by the sturdy arm of the exile, with a loud crash those aged
denizens. The Governor then lived in a tent and every one
erected a covering of the best kind available ; some lived in
hollow trees, and huts were made out of the cabbage tree which
grew there in great abundance, others made of branches and twigs
plastered with clay. There was a clear running stream of fresh
water close by where they were encamped. The locality where
Sydney took its rise was on the level ground, from Hunter-street
towards the Circular Quay. No house, then, nor for a long time
after was put up for divine worship. There was a clear piece of
ground on the west of the Cove, now called Dawes’ Point, where
a battery is placed, and it was. there on the 12th day after
landing, 7th February, 1788, that the government of the
Colony was inaugurated with all the formalities. The Royal
Standard was raised, all the colonists were there, the Military
were drawn up under arms, and the Governor was surrounded by
his officers. The prisoners were placed on one side. The Royal
Commission was read in the first place by the Judge Advocate,
David Collins, then the Act of Parliament was made known,
which authorized the establishment of Courts of civil and
criminal judicature in the Colony, and finally the letters patent
under the great seal which give power to the proper officers to
summon and hold those Courts. The Governor was entrusted
with extraordinary power, by the letters patent of the Seal of
England, which had never been exercised by any other official in
the British Dominion. He could sentence to five hundred lashes,
fine five hundred pounds, regulate customs and trades, fix prices and
wages, remit capital punishment, bestow grants of land, and
create a monopoly of any article of necessity. All the labour of
the Colony was at his disposal; all the land, all the stores, all the
places of honor and profit.”*
The Governor on that occasion delivered a very well prepared
and appropriate address, although rather boastful. “ He considered
that a Special Providence had watched over them and directed
their course, made the winds and seas propitious and brought them
in safety to their destination. England the especial favorite of
Heaven. No power on earth equal to that of England, her

sway reaches from pole to pole, and this is an earnest of the
protection which will he afforded the offshoot of the parent
stem, which that day sprang into existence. She has surpassed
all nations in colonization. Other nations have conquered by
force of arms, destroyed communities and made homes desolate;
but England created new communities and established happy
homes. He acknowledged that young America had obtained the
victory in the late contest with Britain, and Britain resigned the
dominion of the Continent into her hands. She sought now to lay
the foundation of another empire in this region of the earth, which
will rival in strength the one recently lost. This project had the
authority, sanction, and encouragement of the Sovereign, the
parliament and the people, he said that the enterprise was wisely
conceived, deliberately devised, and efficiently organized. That
they took absolute possession of this fifth division of the globe on
behalf of the British people and hope to occupy and rule this
great country and to be the patron of the whole Southern
Hemisphere. They will have the surpassing honor of having
introduced the Christian religion, and European civilization
into the Southern Hemisphere. It will be their honor to plant
the Standard of the Cross, and the ensign of their country, at no
distant time amongst populous nations to whom both of these
have been little known. Such are the objects which will arouse
the enterprise and stimulate the energies of the people of this
young country. Enterprise and energy directed towards the
extension of commerce, spread of the English language, the pro-
motion of the arts and sciences, and the extension of the true
faith. Next after the protection of Providence they will have
to rely upon their own fortitude, energy, and discipline.”
This is the substance of the address which was delivered by
Governor Phillip, when he initiated the Government of the
Colony. It is difficult to know what induced him to speak in such
flattering terms of the territory, to the young colony ; there was
no appearance of fertile land; he had abandoned the shores of
Botany Bay because they looked so barren, and the land they had
encamped upon seemed to be of the same character; and as for
the mineral wealth, which was known, he said, to be so great, as
to promise “ that it may yet rival the treasures which fiction loves
to describe.” How was it known? We have no accounts
previous to that time of the discovery of gold, or any other
mineral: except the reports of the ancients about the golden
treasures of the Great Austral Land. Probably the Governor
indulged in this fabulous description, (which is becoming a
reality), to reconcile the unfortunates to their unhappy lot
11


by filling them with hope, and that they might be the more
subordinate. Sad must have been their disappointment, on the
third year of their settlement, when they remembered the
encouraging words, and found themselves nearly starved to
death from want of provisions; partly occasioned by the un-
generous soil and the drought! A land without native fruit of any
kind, no vegetables, no wild fowl, no beast except the kangaroos,
and few of them to be seen —to satisfy the cravings of hunger.
The timely arrival of the store ship Justinian saved the entire
colony from perishing by famine. A few days after the arrival
of this ship four transports arrived filled with convicts, and the
population of the colony was increased by 1250; and had
they come before the store ship nothing could have saved the
colony from destruction.*
There appears to have been no zeal for the advancement of
religion, in the beginning of the colony. The Governor, and
probably his officers, did not attend the service of the Church of
England until afterwards. There was no church erected during
the stay of Phillip ; but all the convicts, composed of different
religious denominations, were compelled to hear the liturgy of the
English Church on every Sunday, and that under the penalty of
having so much deducted from their rations—overseers 3 lbs.
flour, labouring convicts 2 lbs. Divine service was generally
performed in the open air, and then the poor convict was exposed
to the inclemency of the weather in this ever changeable climate;
the burning sun, the scorching wind, and the cold, biting, westerly
blasts of winter. The Governor, who was a man of great ability,
shrewdness, and intelligence, and of some religious sentiment,
must have seen the utter impossibility of reconciling the Catholic
convict to the liturgy of the Church of England : he must have
been convinced that the Roman Catholic priest was necessary to
effect a reformation in the Catholic prisoners. We can well
imagine, in those times, the piously disposed of the Catholics
assembling in a shady place, saying the Rosary, reading the
Litanies, and prayers of Mass : making fervent Acts of Contrition,
and asking a merciful God to send them His teacher to instruct
and console them, and to offer up the Holy Sacrifice. When they
met for this holy purpose they would be accused of plotting
rebellion, and forbidden, under the severest penalty, to be seen
together.
A week after the Government was established, Lieutenant Philip Gidley King
went with a small party to form a settlement on Norfolk Island. Captain Cook had
recommended this to be done.

When Governor Phillip and the fleet arrived at Botany Bay
there were lying two French Discovery ships which had put
in to get re-fitted. During the time they remained in the harbour
a French priest died, from wounds which he had received at the
Navigator’s Islands. His name was Pere Keceveur. He was the
Naturalist of the expedition. Those Discovery ships had been
sent out during the reign of the unfortunate Louis XYI. The
remains of Pere Receveur were interred on a slope of rising ground
on the north side of the bay, not far from the entrance. A monu-
ment was erected over his remains with the following inscription:
—“Hie jacet Le Receveur E. F. F. Minimis Gallise Sacerdos,
Physicus in circum navigatione Mundi. Duce M. de la Peyrouse.
Obut 17 Febi. 1788.” This monument was destroyed by the
aborigines; but Governor Phillip, by a Christian and friendly act,
ordered another to be erected, and had the inscription engraved
on a copper plate and attached to the nearest tree. The names
of the two ships under the command of Monsieur de la Peyrouse
were the Boussole and Astrolabe : they remained at Botany Bay
until the 10th March, same year, when they sailed, and were
never more heard of. Forty years after remains of the vessels
were found at the island of Malicolo. There is now a large slab
over the grave of Pere Receveur, with the inscription engraven
on it, and surrounded by a substantial iron railing. This im-
provement was effected by the late Father Nesbert Woolfrey, the
priest of Waver ley.
Governor Phillip resigned the Government of the colony in
December, 1792, and returned to England. He was the best of
the four first Governors. Had he not removed the colony from
Botany Bay to Jackson’s Bay, Sydney harbour, in all probability
the Settlement would have been abandoned. The low swampy
land at Botany was found to be quite unsuitable for habitation
and cultivation. He guided the young colony with great ability
during the short time he had authority. He was well adapted
for governing those over whom he had power. Brought up
himself under the severe discipline of the Navy, he knew well
how to command others. He repressed vice by the maintenance
of good order, and he made himself feared by terrible examples
of punishment. He restrained those in the Military and Civil
service by keeping them to their duty and making them respect
the laws; and had they been under similar control, they would
not have been guilty of those escapades which afterwards demoral-
ized, and retarded the progress of the infant colony. There is one
thing of which this Governor was greatly deficient; he does
not appear to have understood the benign influence of religion


upon the soul of man ; he would have left England without a
minister of religion had he not been reminded of the expediency
of providing a clergyman; and during his time no place of
worship was erected. But the Home Government was more to
blame in this matter than Governor Phillip. It was hard enough
to transport the unfortunate convicts to an unexplored island
16,000 miles away, and deprive them almost of hope to
return to their native land ; but persecuting in the highest degree,
to deprive them of the consolations of religion and the means of
arriving at their everlasting kingdom, drowning all hopes in them
for time and eternity, fie looked well after the material interests
of the colony; he lost no time in getting the land cleared of the
heavy timber, and how could that have been done without the
prison labour ? At the time of the departure of Governor Phillip
the statistics show that 1703 acres of land were in cultivation,
which belonged to sixty-seven settlers; and the Government had
in cultivation 1012 acres; the whole under cultivation amounted
to 2715 acres; Governor Phillip had only granted, in his
time, 3470 acres. He encouraged industry, and caused the
country to be explored: he discovered the river Hawkeshury
in the second year after his arrival, 6th July, 1789, and
sailed up the river for 100 miles, till he came to shallow water
at the foot of a hill, which he called Richmond Hill. In the same
year an attempt was made to penetrate to the Blue Mountains,
which are distinctly seen from Sydney. It is much to the credit
of Governor Phillip that he was most kind and humane to the
Aborigines, and did all he could to conciliate and establish a good
understanding between them and the colonists; and tried to
ameliorate their forlorn condition. An accident occurred to him
on one occasion wdien he ventured too far among a tribe of
blacks, on the coast at Manly beach ; Several hundreds were
congregated; one of them mistaking his kindness for an act
of aggression, hurled a spear at him, which lodged in his
shoulder, above the collar bone, and remained there, and was
extracted with difficulty. No vengeance was taken; one of
them boldly came to the Governor, and represented that the black
fellow who threw the spear did not understand what the Governor
meant. A better understanding would have existed between the
two races, and more could have been done for the civilization of
the Aborigines, had the conduct of Governor Phillip been imitated,
by not retaliating on the poor savage when it could have been
helped. Governor Phillip resigned and returned home through
ill health. He sailed 11th December, 1792, after ruling the colony
for five years: and although he had been compelled to preserve
order, —frequently to punish by the last penalty of the law, he


took with him the good wishes of all the colonists, and an ex-
pression of their hope that he would soon be restored to health.
When he returned to England he lived in retirement on the small
salary of £4OO a year. He died there a few years after.
In the year 1790, during Governor Phillip’s rule, three
transports arrived with 1250 additional convicts, —1000 males and
250 females; and detachments of some companies of soldiers
belonging to the N. S. W. corps. Amongst the officers was Mr.
John McArthur, who afterwards became a leading man in the
colony, and acquired great wealth, He was at first Captain and
Paymaster of the force—the New South Wales corps. On account
of bad treatment nearly 300 of the prisoners died on the voyage.
In their desperation they tried to take the vessel, but were over-
powered and chained down in the hold. The contractor with the
Government got £l7 7s. 6d. per head for bringing them out, and
no deduction in the event of any one dying, so that for them the
more deaths the more gain. The dead were permitted to remain
festering with the living.
It was not until September and October of 1791, that the
remainder of the second fleet, consisting of five vessels, arrived,
and anchored in Port Jackson, with a large number of convicts.
These were five of nine vessels, which left Plymouth the previous
year, with 2050 male and female convicts.
When the Governor left, in 1792, there were 2715 acres of
land under cultivation, as stated above, and the population, not
including Norfolk Island, numbered 3,500, and one-third of these,
our historian states, were Roman Catholics : including Norfolk
Island the population amounted to 4,414. The ship “ Bellona,”
in the year 1793, brought out a number of emigrant settlers.
They were to have grants of land. Land was assigned to them
eight or ten miles to the west of Sydney, called Liberty Plains :
so named because they came free to the colony.


CHAPTER III.
The Religious and Social Condition of the Colony after the
departure of Governor Phillip.—The arrival of three
Priests in 1799.—Governor King, by directions of the
Home Government, gives permission to Father Dixon to
exercise his clerical functions. —The insurrection at Castle
Hill.—Extreme liberality of the Home Government to the
Church of England.—Father Dixon falsely accused of
complicity in the rebellion at Castle Hill.
When Governor Phillip left, the government of the Colony
was entrusted by him to Major Francis Grose, the senior officer
of the 102nd Regiment, or N.S.W. Corps, and he had as
assistants David Collins, Esq., Judge Advocate, the Rev. Richard
Johnson and two magistrates. Major Grose after a time
resigned and went home. He was succeeded by Captain Paterson
as Lieutenant Governor. These two officers governed the Colony
for nearly three years, and “ secured for themselves a monopoly
of land, labour and traffic.” Nothing was allowed to
be bought, either from the public store or from the private
ships which visited the port, without passing through the hands
of a set of greedy and grasping officials.*
They were accused of having abused the power which
was in their hands ; that they withdrew all authority from the
civil magistrates, prevented them from making inquiry into cases
and giving judgment; that they were guilty of self-aggrandise-
ment by obtaining for themselves large grants of land. Governor
Philip was very judicious in portioning out the land. He had
not given away more than 3,470 acres, but the officers of the
new Government and their immediate friends were soon in the
possession of 15,000 acres. They aimed seemingly at becoming
the principal proprietors of the land and stock, the founders of
wealthy families and of a Colonial Aristocracy.
They interfered with the commercial interests, small as the
Colony was, for they restricted the sale of merchandise. When
a ship arrived with a cargo of merchandise, instead of allowing
the owners to sell it out to the best advantage, they monopolized
the cargo, fixed the price, and then retailed the articles at an
enormous rate of interest —as high as 1200 per cent, and more.
This was crushing to the infant Colony, which had the greatest
difficulty to produce at the time, and such an unlawful restriction
weighed heavily upon the new settler, who had to sell cheap to
the Government and purchase at a famine price. However, this
insignificant oligarchy made a sure footing on the lands of the

16


colony, and were able to control future Governors and dictate
their own terms; but some of these officers, to do them credit,
in course of time improved their estates; the land was cleared
by them and cultivated, the stock improved, and they redeemed
themselves to a certain extent by their energy and enterprise.
Exploring the country, they opened up its resources, and whilst
they enriched themselves they added to the prosperity of the
colonists. The worst of it was, that during- those three years and
afterwards a traffic was created in spirituous drinks, especially
rum.*
Rum became the common currency amongst all classes.
Land and goods of all kinds were bought and sold with it. There
is an instance on record of an officer who, with a hogshead of
rum, purchased 100 acres of land, which had been granted to
some soldiers in half-acre allotments. Wives have been bought
from their husbands for rum, as there was little respect for the
marriage bond. The vice of drunkenness was rampant in the
community, and the highest class was not free from it. It is
recorded that a Judge, in those early days, “ pronounced sentence
of death when in a state of intoxication.”-f-
The greatest licentiousness prevailed during these three
years, and continued during the times of succeeding Governors.
The most baneful of the human passions—avarice, drunkenness
and lust—were in the ascendancy. Had these demons not been
arrested in their course, it must have eventuated in the ruin of the
colony. Then, in a small community consisting of only 4,000
persons, were found all the elements of evil which have
caused the destruction of mighty empires. Such was the social
condition of the colony, during three years of military despotism ;
the civil authority was dispensed with, and the military alone
governed. On the first Sunday alter the arrival of Governor
Hunter, September, 1795, the Rev. Mr. Johnson, the colonial
chaplain, and the only clergyman in the colony, had the
boldness, after his sermon, (although generous, it would have
been more magnanimous had he confronted the evil in the
beginning), “to expose the last government, their extortion,
their despotism, their debauchery, the ruin of the colony,
reducing it almost to famine by the sale of goods at 1200
per cent, profit.” He congratulated the colony on the abolition
of the military government, on the restoration of a civil one,
and on the laws; and orders this day given out “ that no

officer shall sell any more liquor.” —* It is not my intention
to write a general history of the colony; hut only to advert
to the state of the politics, as an elucidation of the condition
of the colony. Religion and politics are the two points upon
which all human affairs turn. When religion is wanting in
a state, the superstructure will be frail and tottering: —Such was
the condition of the colony during the interregnum from depar-
ture of Governor Philip to arrival of Governor Hunter. It seemed
to have been the intention of the Government in the beginning
to plant the true religion, and extend the true faith, when the
colony was founded.! The colony was woefully in want of
religious instruction ; there was only one clergyman sent out by
the Christian Government to administer to the religious wants of
the young community, and no place of worship was erected until
after the departure of Governor Phillip ; and then, in July (1793)
after a period of five years, the first place of worship was erected.
This Church was opened for service of the Church of England,
25th August, 1793; but this House of Prayer was not erected at
the expense of the Government but by voluntary contributions of
the colonists and by the exertions of the Rev. Mr. Johnson, the
protestant colonial chaplain. Everything else had been diligently
attended to, except the interests of religion, which was the last
consideration. Commodious dwelling houses were erected by
the Government. Stores, barracks, workshops, &C.+
A priest who was the chaplain of one of two Spanish vessels
which arrived in the port, in March, 1793, expressed his astonish-
ment when he ascertained that no place of worship had been
built; he said “that had a settlement been made by his nation, a
house for the service of God would have been erected before
any habitation for man.”
It does not appear that much interest was taken by the com-
munity in erecting a place of worship for their protection from
sun and rain; for the building only cost £4O, and the materials
of which it was constructed were very unsubstantial; the walls
were made of posts, wattles and plaster, and the roof was thatch.
Nor is the want of ardour on the part of the inhabitants to be
wondered at; the third of the population were Roman catholics,
and they were required by the regulation of the Government to
be present during the service of the Church of England; and the

other two-thirds were members, we presume, of the Church of
England and Dissenters. It was great oppression to compel the
catholics to attend a worship they disliked and believed to be
erroneous, and which brought to their mind all that their fore-
fathers had suffered for conscience sake. They were there in
punishment for their violation of the laws, but they should have
loeen at liberty to worship God according to their belief. Such an
attempt to fetter the soul whilst the body was in chains could
only nourish discontent, and breed revolt. The authorities should
have seen the impossibility of making at least the catholic
prisoners conform to the worship of the Church of England; and
therefore the necessity of providing clergymen to supply the
religious wants of the catholics and others. The Rev. Mr.
Johnson must have been very distasteful to the members of the
Church of England when he turned a Moravian Methodist; and
notwithstanding all that is said of his zeal and piety, he spent
a great deal of his time, away from his charge, on his farm
at Kissing Point. He was very successful in horticultural
pursuits, and his oranges sold sometimes at a shilling each. He
returned to England with a good fortune, after having spent
twelve or thirteen years in the colony.
There was no school for the children until the year 1797,
when a school-house was built for the accommodation of 300
children ; and it is astonishing that some provision was not made
for the secular education of the children during these nine years
of the existence of the colony. It was not before, but when the
school was built, that the Rev. Mr. Johnson began to catechise
the children after the service on each Sunday. A great many of
these would be catholic children, who were compelled to be
present, as the catholic adults were compelled to be present to
hear the service of the Church of England.
The tenets of the Moravian Methodists are very objectionable.
It is said the doctrines preached by their founder, Zinzendorf, were
of the most revolting and horrible nature.* An author remarks,
referring to his doctrines, “It is truly melancholy to behold the
sacred name of religion prostituted to such vile abomination.”
Such were the dangerous occasions in regard to Faith, to which
the catholics were exposed in the beginning of the colony. An
historian of the colony writes, “ One chaplain of the Church of
England enjoyed a salary for preaching occasionally to an igno-
rant uninstructed multitude, of whom one third were Irish Roman
* History of Heresies, by St. Liguori. Vol. n., p 73.


Catholics, transported for political or agrarian offences. Religious
teaching, the bedside prayer, the solemn call for repentance, were
seldom heard in that miserable Gomorrah.*
The church which had been erected at the cost of £4O, was
on the evening of the Ist October, 1798, consumed by fire. It was
thought to be the work of an incendiary and a reward of £BO was
offered by the Government to find out the transgressor ; but no
one was found charged with the offence. A very strict order had
been made compelling all the prisoners, under certain penalties, to
attend, without distinction of creed, Divine Service on Sunday.
And because it was suspected to be the work of an incendiary, all
the men were compelled to work on Sunday for the erection of
another place of worship. But can anyone be surprised if it was set
on fire by someone ; since could anything be more intolerant than to
compel the unfortunate prisoners to hear what which was contrary
to their faith and conscience, and calculated, at least in respect
to the Roman catholics, to awaken all their animosities to a
Liturgy, an account of which their forefathers had suffered so
much by the penal laws.
A singular notion took possession of the minds of the people,
in the beginning of the colony, and for many years after, that
Australia was united to China ; and that if they could cross the
country to the north they would reach China ; deluded by this
notion, a considerable number made the attempt. The colony
was only three years (1791) in existence, when the first attempt was
made. Twenty convicts ran away, seven of them perished in the
bush, the remainder, when discovered, were almost naked and
dying with hunger: still this did not deter others from making
a similar attempt. In the beginning of the following year,
44 men and 9 women were missing from the establishment, and
it was believed they had lost themselves on the way to China,
and had died of starvation; nor did the fate of these deter others,
a few years afterwards, from trying the experiment. It is related
by Collins, writing in January, 1798, '• that numerous bodies of the
Irish convicts left the settlement to regain their liberty, by making
their way through the bush to China, but no doubt they perished
in the attempt.” A man by the name of Wilson, who had lived
with the aborigines, returning to the settlement gave information
that he had seen more than fifty skeletons of those, which the
blacks said were skeletons of white men who had lost their way
in the woods. It was the greatest infatuation for men to
attempt what they knew had been fatal to so many, but the

innate love of liberty prompted them to try or perish in the
attempt; and death was preferable to the cruel treatment they
were undergoing, working in chains, under the scorching
Australian sun ; subjected to the lash for the least infringement
of regulation; and the despotic conduct of overseers and no
abridgement of punishment for good behaviour; associated with
the vilest of men, and the voice of religion never heard in that
Pandemonium. These are extenuating circumstances. Who
would not excuse them for trying to get to China ? It is very
illiberal to reproach, as some have done, these men with their
ignorance of the Geography of Australia, a land 16,000 miles
distant from the Green Isle ; and the more, because in their
youth they were deprived of the opportunity of acquiring any
knowledge. It should be remembered that those Irishmen were
brought up under the penal laws, and it was not until the year
1791, that the following enactment was expunged from the
Statutes: —■“ If a catholic kept a school or taught any person,
protestant or catholic, any species of literature or science, such
teacher was for the crime of teaching punishable by law, by
banishment—and if he returned from banishment, he was subject
to be hanged as a felon.”
It is not to be doubted but that it was the intention of the
Home Government in the beginning of the colony to establish
the Church of England upon such a basis that she could not be
shaken, and to make her the dominant church, to the exclusion
of all dissenters. The colony was only two years in existence
whan provision on an extensive scale was made by the Home
Government for the “church and schools.” Instructions were
sent to Governor Phillip to set apart in each township, in the
name of His Majesty George 111., 400 acres for the minister, and
200 acres for the maintenance of a schoolmaster. The same
provision was repeated to Governor Macquarie in the year 1809.
There was a new measure—a most bountiful measure—put
in force in the year 1826, thirty-nine years after the establish-
ment of the colony, giving to the Church of England the most
extensive support. This measure was planned by George IY.
and His Majesty’s advisers, and issued under the Royal Sign
Manual. By this Royal enactment (purporting to provide for
the maintenance of religion —that is the Church of England—
and the education of youth in the discipline and according to the
principles of the united Church of England and Ireland) a
Body Politic and Corporate was formed to carry out the Royal
provisions, consisting of the Governor and the Government


officers, together with the Archdeacon of the Church of England,
and the nine senior chaplains. The Governor is commanded by
his instructions under the Royal Sign Manual, dated 17th July,
1825, to see that there be set apart in every county for the above
purpose “ the seventh part in extent and value of all the lands in
each and every such county, and to be known by the name of
the Clergy and School Estate of such county.”
How exclusive and unjust to the Roman catholics —one-third
of the population, numbering 17,000 at that time —and all dissenters
from the Church of England ! —a most determined attempt to
establish a State Church in the colony, and force the colonists
in a manner to conform to the Church of England. Nor was
there a shadow of excuse for such an exclusive measure. Had the
colony been composed only of members of the Church of England,
with not much likelihood of divergence from her views, then
there would not bo so much cause for complaint. But. when the
most of the people of the colony, both bond and free, were adverse
to the principles of the Church of England, and not likely to be
reconciled to her, such a Royal piece of legislation was, to say
the least of it, very short-sighted and one-sided, and calculated to
breed the greatest discontent in the State. In all probability the
measure was concocted in the colony by the would-be aristocrats
and sent home for the approval of His Majesty’s advisers. This
would be making the amende honorable for their insubordination
at the time of the coup d’etat —a manifestation of their loyalty
and fidelity to the Church and State. It was intimated to the
corporation by the Governor, at the close of the year 1829, that
it was His Majesty’s (George IV.) intention to revoke the charter.
The charter was actually revoked on 4th February, 1833. The
revocation was notified in the Gazette, 28th August, 1833.*
Very little is on record about the catholics in the early days
of the colony; only that about one-third of the prisoners
were Roman catholics ; some statistics were kept, but not one
giving the number of each religious denomination ; the entire
population seemed to be considered as members of the would-be
State Church. In my opinion there were very few catholics
amongst the convicts of the first fleet, who came out under
Governor Phillip. They, in all probability, were the deliverances
of the jails and houses of correction, throughout England.
Collins states in his History of New South Wales, that the first
Irish convicts arrived in the year 1791 : No doubt, a great many of
these were catholics. The unfortunate Irish Catholic prisoner,
when he landed, found no priest to whom he could pour out his

afflicted soul, and receive the strengthening graces of the sacra-
ments. The Home Government were too apathetic to care about
his spiritual wants ; and the colonial authorities too bigoted and
averse to the catholic church to trouble themselves in procuring
spiritual aid for the catholic convicts. We are sure the prayers
of the poor prisoners were unceasing to the God of all consolation
to send them a priest. Their petition was heard, and He sent
them three priests under the garb of political prisoners, but they
were innocent of the charges made against them. In 1799, the
year following the Irish Rebellion, a great many persons were
banished, on the charge of being implicated in the outbreak of ’9B,
and amongst these were three priests, viz., Fathers Dixon, Harold,
and O’Neil, and a protestant clergyman, the Rev. Mr. Fulton.
Father-Harold was placed at Norfolk Island, where he officiated
for some time. Father O’Neil obtained his liberty, the Home
Government having discovered that he was innocent. He returned
to Ireland in 1802. Father Dixon was appointed by the colonial
Government to administer to the religious wants of the catholics
of the colony in 1803. And at the same time that Father Dixon
received permission from the Government to exercise his clerical
functions, he received faculties from his ecclesiastical superiors.
Father Dixon was appointed by the Proclamation of Governor
King, on 19th April, 1803. The Proclamation ran as follows :
‘•Whereas I have judged it expedient and admissible, in con-
sequenceof acomrnunicationfromHis Majesty’s Principal Secretary
of State for the Colonies and War Department, to grant unto the
reverend Mr. Dixon, a conditional emancipation to enable him
to exercise his clerical functions as a Roman Catholic priest;
which he has qualified himself for by the regular and exemplary
conduct he has manifested since his residence in the colony; and
his having taken the oath of allegiance, abjuration, and declaration
prescribed by law.”
“ Which permission shall remain in full force and effect, so
long as he, the said Reverend Mr. Dixon, and (no other priest) shall
strictly adhere to the rules and regulations which he has this day
bound himself by oath to observe, as well as all the other regula-
tions which may hereafter be made thereon by His Majesty’s
Governor of this territory for the time being ; and in case of any
deviation therefrom by the said Mr. Dixon, or any of his con-
gregation, it will remain with the Governor of this territory to
suspend such religious assemblies, and to deal with the offenders
according to law.”

To which proclamation are appended the following regula-
tions :
General Orders, April 21, 1803.
Regulations to be observed by the Rev. Mr. Dixon and the
catholic congregation in this colony :
First—They will observe with all becoming gratitude that
this extension of liberal toleration proceeds from the
piety and benevolence of our Most Gracious Sovereign,
to whom, as well as our present country at large, we
are (under Providence) indebted for the blessings we
enjoy.
Second—That the religious exercise of their worship may
suffer no hindrance, it is expected that no seditious
conversations that can in any way injure His'Majesty’s
Government or affect the tranquillity of the colony will
ever happen, either at the places prescribed for their
worship or elsewhere; but that they will individually
manifest their gratitude and allegiance by exerting
themselves in detecting and reporting any impropriety
of that or any other nature that may fall under their
observation.
Third—As Mr. Dixon will be allowed to perform his clerical
duties once in three weeks at the settlements at Sydney,
Parramatta and Hawkesbury, in rotation, the magis-
trates are strictly forbid suffering those catholics who
reside at the places where service is not performed
from resorting to the settlement and district at which
the priest officiates for the day.
Fourth—The catholic service will be performed on the
appointed Sundays at 9 o’clock in the morning.
Fifth—No improper behaviour during the time of service is
to be allowed by the priest, who will be responsible to
the magistrates for his congregation going regularly and
orderly to their respective homes, after the offices are
ended.
Sixth—And to the end that strict decorum may be observed,
a certain number of the police will be stationed at and
about the places appointed during the service.


Seventh —Every person throughout the colony will observe
that the law has sufficiently provided for the punish-
ment of those who may disquiet or disturb any assembly
of religious worship, or misuse any priest or teacher of
any tolerated sect.

Where was the need of all this formality in appointing
Father Dixon, and why expect such immense gratitude for an
act of simple justice ? —for had two or three priests been
appointed by the Government before that time it would
have prevented an accumulation of crime. And why were
the Governor and others so full of fear and apprehension of the un-
fortunate priest and Irish rebels ; did they think that if they were
treated humanely, they would rise up and murder their keepers in
cold blood ? And for what end would they rebel ? to seize upon the
miserable uncleared land about Sydney,and a few shabby weather-
boarded cottages, including the Government House ? Ho, the
only motive by which they could be actuated, would be to rid
themselves of the cruel tyranny by which they were oppressed.
Father Dixon immediately availed himself of the permission
granted by the Governor, to discharge his clerical duties : I find a
notice in the Sydney Gazette of May, 1803, that the Roman catholic
congregation in that year, assembled for i\\e first time at Sydney.
It is there stated," That on Sunday Morning, 22nd May, 1803, the
Reverend Mr. Dixon will perform the duties of his functions at
Parramatta, and on Sunday next, at the Hawkesbury ; in which
succession the meetings are to be held at these three principal
settlements.” The first meeting of catholics was held in Sydney
by the Rev. Mr. Dixon, on loth May, 1803. He was, according to
all accounts, a good, zealous and charitable' priest, and was ever
ready to give consolation to the afflicted, and he spent his time in
administering the Sacraments of Baptism, Marriage, offering the
Holy Sacrifice, absolving the penitent from his sins, and feeding
him with the Bread of Life. A marriage which he solemnized is
notified in the Government Gazette in the following terms : “ May-
loth, 1803, married by the Rev. Mr. Dixon, of the Church of
Rome, Henry Simpson, shipwright, to Catherine Rourke, of the
Rocks, widow.


But the good priest was not allowed to remain long in the
quiet enjoyment, like his Heavenly Master, of going about and
doing good ; the hatred, bigotry and jealousy with which he was
surrounded, soon found a pretext to deprive him of the power of
doing good. “He was. interrupted,” says a respectable writer, “by
the report that meetings for worship were gatherings of traitors,
and the medium of communication for another attempted rebellion.
An order closed the services.” And yet when the insurrection
did burst forth, and a second “ Vinegar Hill ” battle took place on
the other side of the world, the Rev. Mr. Dixon accompanied the
Commanding Officer and exerted himself nobly on the side of
order and humanity.
The same vessel which brought out the three priests to the
colony, brought Joseph Holt, called General Holt, because he was
one of the leaders in the rebellion of 1798. He was fourteen
years in the colony, at the end of which time he returned to Ireland.
He wrote a very interesting biography in which he makes known
his experiences of colonial life and gives a very truthful and
correct account of the “oppressions, woes and pains” inflicted by
those in authority. I will give an illustration drawn by him,
which shows the barbarous and cruel treatment to which the
unfortunate prisoners were subjected by the myrmidons of
power. He was taken shortly after his arrival by the Rev. Mr.
Marsden, one of the colonial chaplains, who wished to secure his
services, to see a Government gang at work. He writes: “At a
distance, I saw about 50 men at work, as I thought dressed in
nankeen jackets, but on nearer approach I found them naked,
except a pair of loose trousers. Their skin was tanned by the
sun and climate to that colour, I felt much pity for the poor
wretches : they had each a kind of large hoe about nine inches
deep, and eight inches wide and the handle as thick as that of a
shovel, with which they turned up as with a spade, the ground
which was left to rot in the winter. They cannot bear any
clothes when at work in the heat of the day. Captain Johnstone
addressed me saying, ‘ Mr. Holt, you are a good farmer, I suppose ? ’
‘I do well enough with horses and oxen, but not with men,'
said I. Dr. Thompson then said, ‘Do you think those men would
understand you better than horses or oxen ? ’ ‘Yes sir,’ I replied,
‘ but it appears great brutality to work men in this manner.’
‘Well,’ said he, ‘it matters not what you think about it, you will
soon come into it.’ ” On another occasion not long after, Holt says :
“ I marched to Toongabbee, where all the Government transports
were kept, who were called out to witness the punishment of the
prisoners. One man, Maurice Fitzgerald, was sentenced to re


ceive 300 lashes, and the method of punishment was such as to
make it most effectual. The unfortunate man had his hands ex-
tended round a tree, his two wrists tied with cord, and his breast
pressed closely to the tree, so that flinching from the blows was out
of the question, for it was impossible for him to stir. Here is a
picture of the working of the convict system in those days.
Father Harold was ordered to put his hands against the tree, by
the hands of the prisoner, and two men were appointed to flog,
namely Richard Rice a left handed man, and John Johnson the
hangman from Sydney, who was right handed. They stood on
each side of Fitzgerald, and I never saw two thrashers in a barn
move their flails with more regularity than those two man-
killers did, unmoved by pity, and rather enjoying their horrid
employment than otherwise. The very first blows made the blood
spout from Fitzgerald’s shoulders, and I felt so disgusted and
horrified, that I turned my face away from the cruel sight.”
What a revolting scene, what inhuman treatment to a fellow
man, made to the image and likeness of God. It puts one in
mind of pagan times when the master would order his slave to
be scourged or slain for the slightest offence, merely through
capriciousness. In all probability Fitzgerald had to suffer those
300 lashes on account of a little insubordination or impertinent
reply to his hard task-masters ; but what prompted those petty
tyrants to order the priest, Father Harbld, “to put his hand
against the tree by the hands of the prisoner ?” Was it to nerve
Fitzgerald to bear his punishment with more firmness ? But such
tigers could have no sympathy. No, it must have been to degrade
Father Harold, to lower him in the eyes of all present, to remind
him he was a political prisoner, a rebel, and that he might expect
similar treatment if he dared to evince a spirit of discontent.
Whatever was their reason for such an order, it was treating
Father Harold with the greatest indignity. I cannot find for
what Fitzgerald was flogged, but the punishment surely was
excessive.
An outbreak of the prisoners and others happened in March,
1804, said to have originated with the Irish State prisoners ; but
Mr. Holt, and others, assert that they were not the only prisoners
who broke out. The gangs of prisoners employed at Toongabhee,
Castle Hill, near Parramatta, took part in the insurrectionary
movement; and amongst them there were Englismen and free
men, and assigned servants belonadna: to the settlers in the
7 t & &
surrounding parts. They numbered from 200 to 300, and were
well armed. They were met by Major Johnstone, at the head of
25 soldiers and some settlers, at the Ponds, a place between


Parramatta and Windsor. The insurgents, seeing such a small
force against them, halted at the side of a hill, not to oiler battle,
but they sent two men, Cunningham and Johnson, to represent
their grievances, and Major Johnstone, if he had had any
humanity, might have listened to their tale of woe ; but instead
he laid hold of Johnson and placed a pistol at his ear, whilst his
quartermaster, Laycock, killed Cunningham with one blow. They
then fired at the insurgents, killing some, and the rest fled. It is
evident the rebels had no intention to take life. If they had, it
would have been easy for 300 well-armed men, in their desperation,
to have slain or put to the rout twenty-five soldiers. It cannot
be concealed, although the ’9B business was made a “ cloak for
malice,” that it was the tyranny and cruelty of those in authority,
and of the settlers to whom the prisoners were assigned, which
instigated them to rise up against their hard taskmasters.
In order to hide their cruelty and mismanagement, the
Government of the day was easily persuaded that the Irish
political prisoners were the instigators of the late disturbances
and cause of all the discontent, and they pretended that Father
Dixon was implicated, for he was obstructed in the discharge of
his clerical duties, and the allowance which he received from the
Government was withdrawn, and his rations were stopped. This
was no doubt tantamount to a dismissal from the Government. It
is very natural to suppose when Father Dixon saw the way
he was treated, and could do no good, that he made up his mind
to leave the colony, which he did in the year 1808. Father
O’Neil had also been sent to the colony for being implicated in
the Rebellion of 1798, together with Father Harold. The Home
Government became convinced in due time that the Rev. Mr.
Dixon and Rev. Mr. Harold had no participation in the acts of
the Irish Rebellion. Father O’Neil received his pardon and re-
turned to Ireland in the year 1802. Father Harold officiated at
Norfolk Island for a time ; and when the Rev. Mr. Dixon left, he
came to Sydney and officiated in his place.
The Colonial Government now became thoroughly religious,
and persuaded of the necessity of the ordinances of religion being-
attended to ; accordingly they determined to enforce the ob-
servances of the Church of England, and compel all without
distinction to give their attendance. A regulation was made and
enforced, that the whole of the prison population should attend
Divine Service in the Church of England; and, if anyone kept
away, for the first offence he should receive twenty-five lashes,
for the second fifty lashes, and if he refused the third time be sent
to a penal settlement. The regulation was vigorously enforced.
Here was persecution for conscience’s sake with a vengeance.
28


The priest was now separated from his flock, he could neither
preach, baptize, nor attend the sick, in all probability he had no
means of subsistence. He asked permission from the Government
to return home, and immediately it was granted. This priest was
the Rev. Mr. Harold. Now was the time, when the three priests
had left the colony, to compel all to conform to the Church of
England; but the means resorted to were not the mild and
persuasive words of the gospel, but the painful and bloody
strokes of the lash. They borrowed from the penal code to
carry out their ends. The inhabitants of the colony, bond and
free, amounted to 10,500 souls at this time, 1809, and a great
number were Roman catholics. In the year 1807, Rev. S.
Marsden, one of the protestant chaplains, the senior, went to
England to procure more clergymen for the Church of England.
In 1808 the Rev. Wm. Cowper and Rev. Mr. Cartwright arrived
in the colony, and between 1810 and 1817 the church establish-
ment was increased by an assistant chaplain. Observe with
what care the protestant church was fostered.
A literary person, by name James Benwick, F.R.G.S., writes :
“ New South Wales in the beginning was regarded as England over
the way, and absolutely attached to the State Church of England,
and Roman catholics could expect no favour. All had to go to
church, they were driven as sheep to the fold, and whatever
their scruples they had to go : Fallen as many were, they were
not to be supposed aliens altogether in principles, and indifferent
to Faith. In some, the very consciousness of crime had developed
an eagerness after Faith, and that the Faith they had known, the
Faith of a mother. But expostulations were unheeded. If a man
humbly entreated to stay behind, because he was a presbyterian,
he incurred the danger of a flogging. It is said that upon a
similar appeal from another, who exclaimed ‘ I am a catholic,’ he
was silenced by the cry of a clerical magistrate, ‘ Go to church
or be flogged.’ ”
Contrast the prosperous condition of the Church of England
with the deplorable and neglected state of the catholics. They
are denied all help; not an acre of land for them to build a
church or school upon: no priest to administer the rites of their
holy faith : no catechist to instruct them in the elements of
religion: no schoolmaster: which meant, as clearly as possible,
that their only help was in the Church of England, by law
established in the colony. Was this not religious oppression ?
Father Harold must have left the colony about the year
1809. Father Dixon left in 1808. From this time until 1817,
when the Very Rev. Father O’Flynn arrived in the colony, that is
29


eight years and more, there was no priest in the colony to ad-
minister to the religious wants of the catholics, amounting to
nearly a third of the population, and they were compelled to
attend the protestant service of the Church of England. What
a state of spiritual destitution during those eight years! No
priest to offer up the adorable Sacrifice: no church for the
catholics; the catholic child left without the saving waters of
baptism, or doubtfully baptised by the Protestant minister : the
sick and oppressed without the spiritual consolation of their
pastor ; and they go into their grave unconfessed and unanointed:
no catechist to instruct the children in the only true and saving
faith. And this continues for the long time of eight years. The
poor catholics had one resource—they could pray that the Al-
mighty would soon relieve them and send them priests. They
did pray, and in due time their prayer was heard.
CHAPTER IV.
1808 —The Coup d’Etat, when Governor Bligh was deposed, and
Mr. John McArthur appointed himself Colonial Secretary.
—Arrival of Governor Macquarie, in 1809.—The Very Rev.
Jeremiah O’Flynn arrived, 9th November, 1817. —Archpriest
O’Flynn compelled by the Governor to leave the Colony.
The very year in which Father Dixon left the colony was the
year when Governor Bligh was arrested, and his administration
put an end to by Major Johnstone, at the head of a number of
soldiers. This little coup d’etat took place 25th January, 1808.
The Governor was imprisoned until 20th February of 1809.
Those 'who had seized upon the Government dismissed all the civil
officers and appointed others in their place. Mr. John McArthur,
who had chiefly been instrumental in deposing Governor Bligh,
was placed at the head of the Government, or rather, it is recorded,
appointed himself Colonial Secretary.
The way these things came about was this: —Mr. John
McArthur had been imprisoned by the Governor because -he
refused to pay the forfeit, which he had incurred, by a prisoner
being found in his craft, which was cleared for New Zealand.
The Governor had taken a piece of land from Captain John
McArthur, which he had selected for a residence, on Church Hill,
—an elevated healthy situation—and given him in lieu an allot-
ment at the end of lower Pitt-street, then called Pitt’s Lease,
which allotment was very objectionable, because it was the place
30


where the gallows stood, and surrounded by all the vile and
infamous characters of the town of Sydney. These were the
immediate causes which brought things to a crisis; but there had
been a very bad feeling and misunderstanding between the
Governor and McArthur from the beginning. Governor Bligh
entered upon his rule of the colony with the firm determination
of crushing monopoly in all its branches, and all its adherents;
and he seems to have looked upon McArthur as the ruling spirit
of the movement. The sentiments of the Governor in regard to
the condition of the colony when he arrived, may be gathered
from his own words. He wrote :—“ To ascertain the state of the
colony I visited many of the inhabitants individually, and
witnessed many melancholy proofs of their wretched condition.
A want even of the common necessaries of life vjas too 'prevalent,
particularly at the extensive settlement on the Hawkesbury ; and
although Sydney formed some exception to the general aspect,
yet even there the habitations and public store-houses were falling
into decay ; industry was declining ; while a pernicious fondness
for spirituous liquors was gaining ground, to the destruction of
public morals and private happiness. Knowing the sentiments
of the British Government on the subject of the existing abuses,
and the solicitude entertained for their correction, I used every
exertion to accomplish this, and particularly in relation to the
barter of spirits.” It would appear from this statement that the
Home Government was perfectly cognisant of the abuses which
existed in the colony, and that the Governor had particular
instructions to use all his endeavours to remove them. Captain
John McArthur called to see the Governor shortly after his arrival,
and fully alive to his own interest, and no doubt in the second
place, to the interest of the colony in general, began to impress
upon his mind the great advantages which he thought must
accrue to the colony and the mother country from the production
of fine wool. The Governor answered in his gruff seaman style ;
and seeing Mr. McArthur had an eye to business, said—
“ What have Ito do with your sheep, sir ? What have I to do
with your cattle ? Are you to have such flocks of sheep and
herds of cattle as no man ever heard of before ? No, sir.” The
captain replied that he understood the Home Government had
particularly recommended him to his notice. “I am well aware
of your concern, sir ; you have got 5000 acres of the best land in
the colony, and in the finest situation, but by God, you shan’t
keep it.” —Judge 1 herry’s Reminiscences of JS ] .S. Wales.
This was rather hasty language on the part of the Governor,
a comportment perhaps suited for the quarter-deck, but not for the
31


floor of the Government House, with a wealthy and am-
bitious man like Captain McArthur, who was supported by a
powerful oligarchy. The Governor had no intention of taking
the life of McArthur, but was not reluctant to put him in prison
from a desire to break up the combination by securing the ring-
leader. When the Governor was put under arrest by Major
Johnstone, at the instance, it is said, of McArthur and others, he
ignominiously, his enemies declared, concealed himself under a
bed in the Government House. Now it should be known that
the residence was suddenly surrounded by the soldiers, and a
number of them with their muskets and fixed bayonets rushed
up stairs, at the top of which Governor Bligh was standing,
sword in hand; he thought they were about to seize his
person, and he retired to prevent them laying hold of him. Now
I do not think the Governor was so much to blame for trying,
as he supposed, to save his life: he knew well, a hero of many
fights, what infuriated soldiers might do; and his conduct under
such dangerous circumstances was not worse than that of
Charles 11., who concealed himself in the oak tree from his enemies.
No doubt John McArthur and his party had no intention of
taking the life of the Governor, but it seems as if they were fully
bent on sending him out of the colony, and thus getting rid of
one who was most inimical to their scheme of aggrandisement.
Governor Bligh, at the court-martial in England (for he brought
Major Johnstone before the court on a charge of mutiny, and
John McArthur was also arraigned before the same tribunal)
declared it was a slander on the part of Major Johnstone to
make such a statement. It is difficult to believe that an old
naval hero would have been guilty of such an undignified retreat.
He commanded the man-of-war ship, Director, at the battle of
Camperdown, and he first silenced and then boarded the ship of
Admiral De Winter. At the battle of Copenhagen Bligh com-
manded the Glutton, and was publicly thanked by Lord Nelson
on the quarter-deck.
The result of the trial was that Major Johnstone lost his
sword, and was cashiered. Mr. McArthur had left the army
for some years before, and on this account could not be brought
before a court-martial for the part he had taken, but he was
interdicted from returning to the colony for a period of eight
years.
This little coup d’etat had rather a beneficial effect upon the
affairs of the colony; it broke up the oligarchy of would-be rulers
and caused a Governor of superior character to be sent to the
colony, the very able and sagacious Governor Macquarie. With
32


VERY REV. J. O'FLINN, ARCHPRIEST.




all the noise and agitation caused by this stroke of policy there
were no lives lost; it ended happily, like a comedy, by marriage.
Young Lieutenant O’Connell, one of the officers of the 73rd
Regiment, who came to the colony with Governor Macquarie,
married Mrs. Rutland, widow, and daughter of Governor Bligh.
The festivities consequent upon the nuptials allayed much of the
ill-feeling which had existed amongst some of the principal
colonists.
The colonists presented an address to Governor Bligh before
he left the colony, testifying in the strongest terms their respect
and veneration towards him. The address was signed by 833
country settlers and landholders; date, Ist January, 1808.—
Discovery and Colonization of Australia, p. 382 & 386.
This should be said in favour of Captain John McArthur,
that although he was bent on the acquisition of wealth and
influence, he never forgot the general interests of the colony. On
the trial, at the court-martial, he stated, and there is no reason
to disbelieve his statement, that he had disposed of breeding
cattle, amongst the settlers, to the amount of £20,000 ; that he
had raised about 12,000 head of horned cattle and 12,000 sheep;
that at that time he was in possession of 4,600 sheep and 300
head of cattle; and that the consequence of his management was
to lower the price of beef and mutton from 2s. 6d. per lb. to 9d.
The descendants of John McArthur are still wealthy and
influential, and hold part if not all of the 5000 acres originally
granted to the founder of their family, They have cultivated
their land to the highest degree, and planted vineyards; and they
are ever foremost in whatever movement is set on foot for the
advancement of the colony.
The reader will pardon this digression from the ecclesiastical
history; but it will be well for him to know what were the
current events, the disorderly state of the Government, and the
wretched condition of the people. A new state of things was
inaugurated with Governor Macquarie, who arrived in the colony
28th December, 1809.
After the departure of Father Dixon the catholics were for
ten years, as I have stated, without a priest to administer the
sacraments and rites of the church; there were no influential
catholics to represent their spiritual grievances: many of the
Irish catholics had been sent to the colony on account of the ’9B
rebellion and for agrarian outrages, and a good number for
offences of quite a different character, which ranked them with a
degraded class. Very Rev. J. O’Flynn arrived in the colony in the
year 1817. He was appointed by Rome to administer to the
D
33


spiritual wants of the catholics of the colony, and had authority
to confer the sacrament of Confirmation. He was a man of meek
demeanor, and very zealous for the salvation of souls. I have
seen several who were baptized by him, and there was pointed
out to me by an old resident of Sydney, a place in George-street,
where he administered the Sacrament of Confirmation. He went
from one part of the colony to another, seeking out his people,
celebrating the Divine Mysteries, and giving instructions. From
the time he landed the most determined opposition was raised
against him. His zeal and piety attracted the notice of the anti-
catholic party, and they cried out for his expulsion from the
colony. As a pretext for sending him away it was alleged that
he had come to the colony without the approval of the Home
Government. Judge Therry, in his “Reminiscences of New
South Wales and Victoria,” states, that there was no law which
required the sanction of the British civil authorities. Father
O’Flynn was cast into prison and sent away by the first ship
sailing for England. It is said that he left the Blessed Sacrament
for the adoration of the faithful in the house of Mr. William Davis,
near where now stands the Church of St. Patrick. We can well
imagine the fervent prayers which the afilicted souls would offer
to their Saviour in the sacrament, to send labourers into the
vineyard, which was arid for want of cultivation. Nor was it
long before their prayer was heard. The Arch-priest, Father
O’Flynn, arrived safely in England, and the hardship of the poor
catholic prisoners being deprived in this summary manner of his
ministry was brought before Parliament, by Lord Bathurst,, who
made provision for two catholic clergymen. Lord Donoghmore
represented the arbitrary conduct of Governor Macquarie, in
compelling Father O’Flynn to leave the colony, in the House of
Commons. The representation caused considerable excitement, and
the British public acknowledged that a great injustice had been
done to the poor catholics of New South Wales. It was ordered by
the Executive that two priests be selected, and salaries given
them, to proceed to New South Wales to attend to the religious
wants of the Roman catholics.
To show how deeply the catholics felt the deprivation of
their spiritual adviser, it is related by Dr. Ullathorne in his
account of the Catholic Mission in Australasia, that shortly after
his arrival a venerable old man came to him from a distance to go
to his religious duties, and expressed his regret for the departure of
Father O’Flynn by saying, “ Oh had Father O’Flynn remained what
would he have done! He had the sweetest and the swiftest
tongue of Irish that ever my ear heard.” The old man excused
34


his bad English and said that he “ had never spoken one word of
English until it was made fifty lashes to speak a word of Irish.”
The anti-catholic clique of bigots who surrounded the Governor
of the day must have been sensible of their injustice towards the
catholics.
A petition was got up by the catholics and liberal-minded
protestants requesting the Governor not to send the Very Rev.
J. o’Flynn out of the colony. They were told very coolly that it
was a piece of presumption on their part to make any such
request. Some over zealous protestant officials were accused of
influencing the Governor to do this despotic act: and it is said that
the Governor was incessantly entreated by settlers to send Father
O’Flynn out of the colony, because he was constantly inducing, by
Divine Service, the prisoners to leave their work. In a letter
which appeared in the “ Freeman’s Journal,” a few years back,
the writer states, “That the name of the Arch-priest was not Rev.
William Flinn, as given by a correspondent, but the Very Rev.
Jeremiah O’Flynn, and a very fine looking man he was. He
confirmed me, and I quite well remember him.” Again, the
writer states, that “Father O’Flynn left the Blessed Sacrament in
the house of a devoted catholic (in a Fix), the late Mr. James
Dempsey, of Kent-street, near to Erskine-street, and next door to
the then residence of Mr. Thomas Day the boat builder, which is
not near St. Patrick’s Church, as has been asserted.” He also
states that before the arrival of Father Therry the catholics met
in Sydney, for their devotions, at the house of this good old man,
James Dempsey, on all Sundays and holidays; and that the
priest of a French Frigate frequently said mass there. I find it
attested by Bishop Folding, in his report of the Mission, for the
Propagation of the Faith, that the Blessed Sacrament was con-
sumed, and the species found uncorrupt, when the two priests,
F. Connelly and Father Therry arrived, in the year 1820.
There is no record in the Government Gazette of the im-
prisonment of Father O’Flynn, or of his compulsory departure
from the colony, that I can find. There were said to be at the
time, in New South Wales and Van Dieman’s Land, not less than
10,000 catholics, which is a most aggravating circumstance in
connection with the treatment of the Arch-priest—to deprive
that number of people, firmly attached to their religion, of the
ministrations of a priest, and who had been already without a
clergyman for ten years. But I suppose penal laws were to be
expected in a penal settlement. Father O’Flynn concealed
himself for a time, whilst a petition was being prepared. The
petition was signed by 400 respectable colonists, who prayed the


Governor to allow Father O’Flynn to remain, otherwise a great
number of the community would be deprived of religious instruc-
tion. It was to no purpose ;he had to depart from the shores of
Australia.
In course of time Archpriest O’Flynn arrived in his native
land; he represented the treatment he had received from the
Colonial Government to the Right Rev. Dr. England, Bishop of
Charleston, who was in Ireland at the time. Bishop England put
the case into the hands of Lord Donoughmore, who was then
member for Cork, and he brought it before the House of
Commons.
When Father O’Flynn returned to Ireland, there was a young
priest, lately ordained in Carlow College. This priest was the Rev.
John Joseph Therry. He had greatly distinguished himself during
his college career for learning and piety. He was most anxious to
devote himself to the service of God and of His church in a foreign
land: he had formed a small band of students into a society to offer
up prayers for the success of foreign missions. This zealous young
priest saw Archpriest O’Flynn, and heard from his lips the tale of
the sorrows and spiritual wants of his fellow countrymen: he did
not hesitate, but offered himself at once for the arduous duty. He
applied and obtained the consent of his bishop to go out to
Australia. Another priest, somewhat older, the Rev. P. Connelly,
joined him in the noble object. They were furnished with the
requisite papers by the Government; Lord Bathurst having made
provision for two catholic clergymen to be sent to New South
Wales.


CHAPTER V.
2nd May, 1820.—The arrival of Fathers Therry and Connelly. —
Extraordinary instructions of Governor Macquarie to these
two clergymen. — Foundation-Stone of St. Mary’s laid by
Governor Macquarie, 29th October, 1821.—The reason why
Father Therry was deprived of his salary, and forbidden to
officiate. —In the year 1829 Mr. Roger Therry arrives as
Commissioner of the Court of Requests.
They sailed from the Cove of Cork, in the ship “ James,” on the
sth December, 1819, and arrived in Sydney Harbour on Tuesday,
2nd May, 1820. They lost no time after their arrival in obtaining
an interview with the Governor, then General Macquarie, when
their credentials were acknowledged. There being now no
hindrance on the part of the Government, they immediately
began to discharge the functions of their sacred ministry. Fathers
Connelly and Therry received their spiritual powers from the
Right Rev Dr. Slater, who was Bishop of the Mauritius, and held
from the Holy See Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction over New South
Wales, and all the islands in the Oceanique-Southern Seas. They
had from the Home Government £IOO each as an annual salary.
The catholics, although numerous, were without a church
wherein to offer the Holy Sacrifice, and hear the word of God ;
and had been so since the foundation of the colony, and these two
devoted men resolved without delay to exert themselves to have
this great want supplied.
Soon after the arrival of the Missionaries, 6th June, 1820,
the Governor sent them written instructions, to direct them in the
discharge of their clerical duties. “He advised them not to try to
make converts from the members of the church of England, nor
protestants in general, to confine their labours to those of their
own flock, and warned them on their peril.” This was certainly an
uncalled-for admonition on the part of the Governor to the
catholic clergymen He should have left them to their own
judgment and discretion as were the protestant clergy; but it may
be supposed that as he and his advisers could not send them out
of the colony, like Father O’Flynn, they were determined to
restrict their action in every way they thought that action would
be detrimental to the would-be state church, by changing the
minds of her subjects, and drawing them over to the catholic
church. He also enjoined that the mass should not be celebrated
publicly, except on Sundays and holidays of the church of
England. He seemed to regret he could not enforce the “ Act of
37


Conformity,” passed in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, which pro-
hibited any one from attending the ministration of any clergyman
except those of the church of England, and inflicted a fine for
not attending service on Sundays, and the prescribed holidays.
Governor Macquarie further regulated, that Fathers Connelly
and Therry were not to interfere with the religious instruction of
the catholic children belonging to the orphan schools ; all the
inmates of which were to be instructed in the faith and doctrines
of the church of England. The Governor ended his instructions
by saying, “he was ready to advocate and support the religious
liberty of his flock and maintain their just rights and privileges.”
This last regulation was a block thrown in the way of the
two zealous priests, who had just arrived in the colony, of no
small magnitude ; to prevent them from instructing the children
of their flock, who were being brought up in the Government
charitable institutions. The Government had no power to inter-
fere in this way with the parents, who have a natural right to get
their children educated in their own religion. To deprive them
of this right is unjust, it is to sever the most tender ties which
bind the parent to the child —the tie of faith, the tie of hope, the
tie of charity in God. If the Governor had received a warrant
from Heaven that the church of England was the church of
Christ, then he might have exercised control over the souls
of those children; but the church of England can lay no
substantial claim to this high prerogative, there is no argument
in her favor. It is the more to be regretted that he
acted in this manner, as Governor Macquarie had many good
qualities, but the arbitrary treatment of Father O’Flynn and
these stringent regulations are blots upon his administration.
They soon commenced their labours. In the Court House a meeting
of the catholics was held in the month of July, about two months
after the arrival of the catholic clergymen. It was resolved at
this meeting, without delay to use their best endeavours, to com-
mence a church, suitable for the catholics of Sydney. The
Rev. Philip Connelly presided at this meeting. It was arranged,
soon after, that in order to do more good, one of them should go
to Tasmania, and labour amongst the catholics, of whom there
was a considerable number. The lot fell to Father Therry, who
was the junior. He proceeded for his destination and was at sea
about a fortnight, when adverse winds drove the vessel back to
Sydney; the catholics of Sydney were wont to say from their
appreciation of Father Therry that “ it is an ill wind which blows
nobody good.” Father Therry then remained in Sydney, and
Father Connelly went to Hobart Town.
38


When a suitable site had been secured from the Government
and all the necessary preliminaries settled upon, the day was
appointed for the laying of the foundation stone, and Governor
Macquarie was invited to perform the ceremony: he accepted
the invitation. It was on the 29th October, 1821, the event took
place ; when the Governor received from the hand of Father
Therry a silver trowel, and laid the foundation stone of the first
catholic church commenced in the colony. On this occasion the
reverend chaplain was robed in his priestly vestments.
Government Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser, 3rd Nov., 1821.
Foundation Stone laid 29th October, 1821.
On Monday last the first stone of the first Roman catholic
chapel was laid in this part of the world, in the presence of a
vast assemblage of respectable persons, who were anxious to
witness so important and interesting a ceremony. The site
chosen for the erection of this edifice, which is intended to be
spacious as well as handsome, is to the east of Hyde Park, the
front of the chapel facing the town. The spot in every way
seems extremely eligible, and there can hardly be a doubt enter-
tained but that the structure, when completed, will join with the
other superb buildings in that attractive end of the town in
affording additional and consistent beauty to the rapidly improv-
ing Australian capital. His Excellency the Governor performed
the grateful ceremony, for which purpose a very handsome silver
trowel had been prepared by Mr. Clayton, which was adorned
with an appropriate inscription. “ St. Mary’s Chapel ” was the
designation which this intended place of worship received from
His Excellency. The Rev. Mr. Therry’s address on this occasion
and His Excellency’s answer have been transmitted to us for
insertion, and are subjoined for the information of the public.
“ In presenting to your Excellency this humble instrument
(which, undervalued as it may be by the supercillious and the
unscientific, will not be contemned by any who have studied and
patronized, as your Excellency has done, the sciences and useful
arts), we, the catholics of this colony, cannot refrain on such an
auspicious occasion from expressing our most sincere and heart-
felt gratitude to your Excellency for having deigned to honor us
by personally laying the first stone of the first Roman catholic
chapel attempted to be erected in this territory.


“As a worthy representative of a benevolent king, you, by
this act of condescension, give an illustrious example, which will
prove to be not less beneficial to society than meritorious to your
Excellency. You will have the merit of laying the firm
foundation of a moral edifice of unanimity, mutual confidence
and fraternal love, and of more strongly cementing the respect
and affection of all persuasions and parties in this country to
our sovereign, to yourself and to each other.
“ In the temple whith you now commence, prayers shall be
frequently offered to the Throne of God to invoke upon yourself
and your amiable family the richest blessings of heaven, and we
venture to predict that whilst it shall continue to be appropriated
to the sacred use for which it is intended, neither the name nor
the virtues of your Excellency shall at any time be forgotten.

“Roman Catholic Chaplain.
“ For himself and his Roman catholic brethren
of New South Wales.
“ His Excellency Lachlan Macquarie, Esq., Governor-in-
Chief, &c., &c.”
“ 29th October, 1821.
“ Reverend Sir, —I receive from your hands with much
pleasure, in your own name and that of your Roman catholic
brethren of New South Wales, the very handsome silver trowel
now presented to me, and I feel myself very much honored in
having been thus selected to make use of this instrument in
laying the first stone of the first Roman catholic chapel
attempted to be erected in Australia The sentiments you have
addressed to me are congenial with my own—in the beneficial
result to be derived from the erection of the proposed edifice.
“It has been a great gratification to me to witness and
assist at the ceremony now performed, and I have every hope
that the consideration of the British Government in supplying
the Roman catholics of this colony with established clergymen
will be the means of strengthening and augmenting (if that be
possible) the attachment of the catholics of New South Wales to
the British Government, and will prove an inducement for them
to continue—as I have ever found them—to be loyal and faithful
subjects to the Crown.

“ I beg you will accept of my best acknowledgments for the
sentiments of friendly regard and kind good wishes you have
been pleased to express for myself and my family.
“Lachlan Macquarie,
“ Governor-in-Chief of New South Wales.
“To the Rev. John Joseph Therry and the Roman
catholics of N. S. Wales.
“ Sydney, 29th October, 1821.
It is related, there were dissensions amongst the catholics
about the size of St. Mary’s, and no doubt had the plan not been
so large the Government would have contributed more readily and
liberally. The Colonial Architect objected to the plan being so
large, and said that the catholics would not require such a building
for a hundred years. Mr. C. Fitzpatrick, in a letter, states, that
there were catholics from all parts of the colony at the laying of
the foundation stone ; and that he was a boy serving mass on the
occasion ; he held the trowel until the time came for Father Therry
to present it to the Governor; the following inscription was on
the trowel:—“ This trowel was presented by the catholics of New
South Wales to Major-General Lachlan Macquarie, Governor in
Chief, &c., &c., on the auspicious occasion of his laying the
foundation stone of St. Mary’s Catholic Church.” The Governor
wiped the trowel with his own handkerchief, and put the trowel
in his bosom saying, “You must know Mr. Therry that, although
I never laid the first stone of a catholic church before, I am a very
old mason,” meaning he was a Freemason, “and I shall keep
this trowel as long as I live, in remembrance of this day, and I
wish you and your flock every success in your pious undertaking.”
Mr. Fitzpatrick also states that Father Therry won the esteem of
Mr. Commissioner Bigge, who made a present of two silver branch
candlesticks of great value for the especial use of St. Mary’s
church.
Governor Macquarie did not long enjoy the vice-regal power
after the laying of the foundation stone of St. Mary’s church ;
he was recalled by the King’s Commission, on the Ist of December
following, when Major-General Sir Thomas Brisbane was ap-
pointed in his stead, as Captain General and Governor in Chief
of these colonies.


I cannot allow the time of the administration of Macquarie
to pass by without recording my small meed of praise ; he is
considered by the majority, who have written on the affairs of
the colony of New South Wales, to have been the best Governor
the colony had, up to the time of his removal. He held the
Government for eleven years. One of his first acts was to declare
all trials since the arrest of Bligh illegal, and all the acts of the
provisional management null and void. He arrived in the colony,
as Governor, when it was in a very distracted state with much
dissension and discord,monopoly of trade and commerce, depression,
great dissipation and lax morals ; he destroyed the monopoly, and
broke the power of the would-be oligarchy; he restored credit
and confidence which were at a minimum, and by wise regulations,
he established order and due subordination. Besides looking to
the general interests of the colony, he considered it a special duty
to attend to the welfare of the prison population, and encouraged
them in every way ; he ameliorated their unhappy condition, and
strove to bring about their reformation; he held, as a principle,
that when a man had gained his freedom by good conduct, his days
of punishment should not be remembered against him; and he ex-
pressed a hope that the British public would never be so resentful
as not to pardon the injuries which lawless men had committed
against her. This was the best of ethics, and it must be said that
the Governor endeavoured to carry out these principles in his
conduct. He caused to be erected by prison labour, and the
prisoners could not be better employed, many large, commodious,
and not inelegant, substantial public buildings ; and that not only
in Sydney, but in all the adjacent towns. Hyde Park Barracks
were erected for the accommodation of the prisoners, and Sydney
Infirmary, now being pulled down, which has done the greatest
service, during the time of the penal settlement and till the present.
It was also during his administration that two orphan schools
were erected at Parramatta, one for boys and another for girls.
It was in his time that Bathurst and the adjoining country
was discovered by the enterprising explorers, Messrs. Blaxland,
Lawson and Wentworth. He Connected Bathurst with Sydney,
by prison labour.
He opened up the resources of the colony by the construction
of roads and bridges, but the crowning achievement of his ad-
ministration was, the finding of a passage across the Blue Moun-
tains, and the making of a road to Bathurst Plains. It is by such
men, endowed with the faculty of organisation, as Governor
Macquarie, men of capacious minds, and far seeing, that empires
are founded. Judge Therry, in his “ Reminiscences of New South


Wales and Victoria,” remarks : —“His merits are summed up in
a sentence —He found a garrison and a gaol, and left the broad
and deep foundations of an empire.” (The retiring Governor, in
recognition of his worth for the good he had done, was presented
with a golden cup, valued at 500 guineas. This was done at the
instigation of Messrs. D’Arcy Wentworth and John Piper.—
Flanagan’s History. Yol. 1, page 2 JO.)
He was not so happy in his views about religion; he was
warmly attached to the church of England, because she was the
church of the state, and he considered that she ought to be the
only church in the colony, to the exclusion of all dissenters : he
would give no encouragement to the catholic religion; he left during
the most of his time, the catholics without a religious instructor,
and compelled Father O’Flynn, at the instigation of the bigots
who surrounded him, to leave the colony, because he had no
credentials from the Home Government. He found out his mistake
in the end, when Fathers Connelly and Therry arrived in the colony,
appointed by, and with salaries from the Home Government. He
very graciously consented and laid the foundation stone of St.
Mary’s cathedral. He did more, knowing that the catholics were
not the most wealthy in the colony, and the funds nearly exhausted,
he promised on the eve of his departure from the colony, to use
his influence with Earl Bathurst, to obtain further help for
the completion of St. Mary’s—l find the words of the note, in
Dr. Ullathorne’s reply to Judge Burton.
Ship Surrey, Port Jackson,
15th February, 1822.
Dear Sir, —I shall not fail to move Earl Bathurst, on my
arrival in England, to instruct Sir Thomas Brisbane to extend
further, assistance towards completing the Roman catholic
chapel at Sydney.
I remain, in haste, dear Sir,
Yours very truly,
L. MACQUARIE.
To the Rev. J. J. Therry, &c., &c.
Nor was he unmindful of his promise, it would appear; for
when a memorial was presented to His Excellency, Sir Thomas
Brisbane, supported by one of the judges and twenty-six
magistrates of the territory, praying for pecuniary assistance
towards the completion of St. Mary’s, the following reply was
received from his Excellency, through his secretary.
“ After the anxiety so generally felt, the propriety of opening
a fresh subscription for the consummation of that religious,
43


political, and elegant undertaking, naturally suggests itself; and
in any list that may be opened, I am directed by the Governor,
to enter the name of the Government for a sum equal to the sum
total of all such additional donations.
I have the honor to be, rev. sir,
Your most obedient servant,
F. GOULBURN,
Colonial Secretary.
It would have redounded to the everlasting honor of
Macquarie had he before his departure, expunged from the regu-
lations of the orphan schools, which were made by him and
his confidential advisers, that one which required that all the
inmates, whether of catholic parents or dissenters, should be
instructed in the doctrines of the church of England but the
honor of erasing it was left to others.
Most strenuous efforts were made by the catholics to supply the
requisite funds for the building of St. Mary’s church ; collections
were made in every place, and even collectors were sent to the
Dutch settlements in the Islands to the North of Australasia, but
the results were inadequate, and no aid was received from the
Government. The leading protestant gentlemen of the colony
had contributed handsomely to the erection of the building ; I
have given a list of their names in Appendix A. at the end of the
volume. We find there the honored names of Wentworth,
Campbell, Goulburn, the Governor’s Secretary, Wm. Bland,
McHenery, Gapt. King, Royal Navy, Sir John Jamieson, Lord,
and many others. It may be said of them in regard to the
catholic community that they were friends in need and therefore
friends indeed. Be their names ever remembered—From papers
left by Father Therry, I find that from the '•commencement of the
building, that is from 29th October, 1821, to 14th August, 1824,
the subscriptions amounted to £2,602 4s 2d. and work worth
that and more had been done. No assistance had as yet been
given by the Government. It is true that to undertake such a large
building at that time, when the catholics did not number more
than 10,000, one-third of the population, and these comparatively
poor, required no ordinary foresight and fortitude. It was a
question, when the structure was nearly at a stand still, whether
it would not have been better to have built a church not so
large, that the Government might help more willingly, and the
catholics assemble in it, for divine worship, within a time not


far distant. However, the work was proceeded with by separate
contracts, and Father Therry lived to see St. Mary’s cathedral
nearly completed and filled with faithful and devout worshippers.
When Father Connelly went to Tasmania—in 1820, shortly
after his arrival in the colony—Father Therry had no assistance
until the year 1820, when Father Power arrived. During those
five years he had to discharge all the duties of a priest, which
was no light obligation, as the catholics were scattered in the
surrounding country. He had to celebrate the divine mysteries
at Parramatta, Wollongong, Hawkesbury, Penrith, Liverpool and
other places, and to be ready to attend to sick calls at any time.
And all the salary he had as colonial chaplain was £lO0 —not
sufficient to keep a horse in those days, when feed was so dear.
In a very arbitrary manner (as I will show a few pages further
on) he was deprived by the Government of his salary. Father
Therry was actuated by the true missionary spirit, and many
instances are on record of the promptitude with which he attended
to the salvation of souls. A catholic who lived in those times,
now far advanced in years, informs me that he remembers one
occasion when Father Therry had returned to Sydney from
Wollongong, where he was attending a sick person. Without
any time to rest he was sent for to see another person said to be
dying. It was a Sunday, and a very wet day. He immediately
prepared and proceeded to Wollongong, distant seventy miles,
on horseback, and then by an exceedingly bad road. I have heard
that every day his gig was ready at the door to start for where-
soever he was required.
I have before related that Commissioner Bigge was sent out
by the Home Government to investigate the affairs of the colony.
He had for secretary Mr. Thomas Hobbes Scott, who had been
in early life a wine merchant. The commissioner with his
secretary had not long returned, when Mr. Scott was appointed
archdeacon of the colonial protestant church. He arrived in
May, 1825, and soon after made his charge to the clergy of
the church of England, when he said “he communicated the
gracious intention of His Majesty to divide the colony into
compact parishes and to prosecute the work of education on
a more liberal and comprehensive system than that which had
hitherto been pursued.” Accordingly in the following year a
royal charter was issued, with instructions under the royal
sign manual to Governor Darling, dated 17th July, 1825. The
preamble of the charter shows the end for which it was designed
—“ Whereas we have taken into our royal consideration the


necessity of making provision for the maintenance of religion
and the education of youth in our colony of New South Wales,
and for that purpose have thought proper to erect into one body
politic and corporate such persons as are hereinafter mentioned,
and to vest in them and their successors such lands and tenements
as will be sufficient to make aprovisionforthatpurpose,as aforesaid.”
And in the instructions under the sign manual to the Governor are
the following ; “ Whereas it is necessary that sufficient provision
should be made for the establishment and support within our
said territory of the protestant reformed religion, as by law
established in England and Ireland, and for the education of
youth in the discipline and according to the principles of the
united church of England and Ireland. And we have for that
purpose thought fit that such part as hereinafter mentioned of
the waste and unoccupied lands within our said territory and
its dependencies, should be appropriated and set apart, and
should be placed under the control and superintendence of one
body politic and corporate, to be established within the said
territory by letters patent, to be for that purpose issued under
the public seal of New South Wales, &c., &c.”
When Father Therry saw what was the intention of the
Home Government, viz., to give no assistance for the education of
children of catholic parents, in the catholic faith and to provide
only for the education of children in the protestant belief, he
resolved to form a Catholic Education Society to prevent the
children of catholic parents from being taught the doctrines of
the church of England. There appeared in the Sydney Gazette
of 16th June, 1825, a letter written by Father Therry, in which
he makes known the measure intended, and how prejudicial it
would be to catholic education, and in the same letter he exposes
the grievance which compelled the catholics to bury their dead
in the protestant burial ground; and it is in this letter that
appeared the expression “ qualified respect ” in regard to the
protestant clergy. Here are the words of the letter—
Sydney Gazette. —Thursday, June 16, 1825,
The Homan catholic chaplain has publicly to express his
grateful acknowledgements to Mr. James Burke, of Airds, a native
of this colony, for his offer of five acres of cleared and valuable
land, contiguous to Campbelltown, as a burial ground, and site
for chapel and school-house; and for his still more liberal promise
of giving double that number of acres, if so many should be
required, for these purposes.


“ It may be necessary here to state that the Roman catholics,
who form the greater number of, at least, the free inhabitants of
that and some of the adjoining districts, having no place to
assemble in on the Lord’s day, for the purpose of divine worship,
but the open air (in which the prisoners of that persuasion are
obliged to continue for hours together on every Sunday, exposed
to all the vicissitudes of the weather, in order to be exempted
from a necessity of attending at ceremonies of which they cannot
conscientiously approve), and having already liberally subscribed
to the erection of the Sydney chapel, the funds of which are
indeed nearly if not completely exhausted, decline to contribute
any further to that edifice until they shall have first erected a
temporary chapel in their immediate neighbourhood.”
“ And as from a document which has been recently published,
it may be inferred that public provision is to be made for pro-
testant parochial schools exclusively, and that the children of the
catholic poor are to be either excluded from the salutary benefit
of education, or compelled, or enticed to abandon the truly vene-
rable religion of their ancestors, according to the past and present
system of the orphan school institutions of the colony; and as
the lesser of these evils must be deprecated as a most serious one,
the Roman catholic chaplain, with the fond hope of obviating
both, is determined, Deo adjuvante, immediately to form a Roman
Catholic Education Society, into which, however, persons of any
denomination may be admitted on subscribing to its fund fifteen
shillings a-year, or one shilling and three pence per month. But
he has seriously to regret that this design has not been anticipated,
or that its execution has not been reserved for less humble and
more efficient instrumentality than his.”
“ The intention of the Roman catholic chaplain to procure
burial places separate from those of the establishment, will not
be ascribed, by any person who happens to know him, to a spirit
of illiberality: so far from it that the idea was first suggested to
him by a personage of high and distinguished liberality and
benevolence, of another persuasion, who had known by experience
that it was in strict accordance with the discipline of the Roman
catholic church, and calculated to prevent the clashing or incon-
venient interference of the respective duties of clergymen of
different societies, and the recurrence of an instance which had
more than once taken place, in which burial or surplice dues were
required from surviving friends of deceased catholics by a
minister who had not officiated at the interment, and on payment
of them being refused, were enforced by him in his capacity of
magistrate.”


“ This precedent, however, he feels it his duty also to state, has
neither been, nor is likely to he adopted by the other reverend
gentlemen of the establishment, who, with the exception of
the reverend gentleman alluded to (who, I sincerely believe, on
these occasions, merely vindicated what he considered to be his
just rights), are in every way entitled to, and possess his qualified
respect.”
Sydney, 14th June, 1825.

chaplain may be left at the residence of Mr. William Davis,

It is evident from the context that Father Therry meant the
expression unqualified respect “ the protestant clergy are in every
way entitled to his unqualified respect.” When brought to an
account for the expression he declared it was the word unqualified
he wrote, and the printer admitted that it was his mistake.
It was only a pretext to find fault with Father Therry; the head
and front of his offending was because he had in this article
exposed the exclusiveness of the intended measure to provide
only for protestant parochial schools, and because he reminded
the Government of its promise to assist in the erection of
St. Mary’s, and informed them that the catholics were entitled
to burial grounds separate from the establishment. However it
was through this letter that Father Therry was deprived of his
salary, and prevented by order from officiating in any of the
public institutions; nay more, he was offered £3OO to leave the
colony; but Father Therry was made of sterner stuff, he worked
on and would not desert the flock entrusted to his care by the
Supreme Pastor. Had he left the little flock forlorn, he would
have been like the hireling described by our Lord, who aban-
dons the sheep when he sees the wolf coming. More anon about
Father Therry.
Sir Thomas Brisbane was recalled through misrepresentations
made against his administration to the Home Government, before
the expiration of the time alloted for the stay of a Governor.
Sir Thomas was a man of well cultured mind, and possessed of
scientific attainments. He was distinguished as an astronomer.
It was he who established the first observatory in the colony
and appointed a well-qualified astronomer to superintend it. In
his reply to the address. which was presented to him by the


VERY REV. JOHN JOSEPH THERRY.




colonists, when about to leave, he said; “he had been bred in the
profession of a soldier and spent the last years of his life in the
campaigns of his country.” He had very much distinguished
himself during the Peninsular War. In the address {vide
Wentworth’s and Lang’s History) he was complimented by being
told, that “ during the four years he held the reins of Govern-
ment, the colonists enjoyed three of the greatest political bles-
sings, to wit, a mild, an impartial, and firm administralion”
It is not recorded that Governor Brisbane during his time per-
formed any great work; hut he is thanked for having established
trial by jury, and given freedom to the Press. Many distressful
events occurred, in the time of his administration, and several
beneficial happened. Through some mis-management, by selling
too cheap, the wheat became scarce; the wheat fell from 10s and
7s 6d to 3s 9d and then rose to £1 4s per bushel. There was a
disastrous flood in the Hawkesbury River, and the finest crops
were destroyed. Many of the small settlers had to dispose of
their farms which fell into the hands of the public-house keepers
and money lenders. The colony was gradually extending its
limits, a Captain Currie of the Royal Navy explored the plains of
Maneroo, which are from two to three thousand feet above the
level of the sea, divided from Twofold Bay by a lofty range of
mountains.
In the year 1824 Messrs. Hovel and Hume, after great
hardships, crossed the country to Port Philip. In the north Mr.
Oxley, Surveyor-General, was ordered by Sir Thomas Brisbane
to make an exploration, and he discovered the River Brisbane,
which is navigable and leads to rich agricultural land and pastoral
districts. And in 1825 Mr. Allen Cunningham discovered the
Pandora Pass, by which you enter from the Upper Hunter to
the Liverpool Plains, and to extensive and rich districts beyond.
Sir Thomas Brisbane is praised for having ameliorated the
condition of the prison population and improved the financial
affairs of the colony. He seems to have left Australia with the
goodwill and esteem of all the colonists, and he was no ordinary
person to have won this honor in the midst of parties who were
so discordant.
There was not much immigration before the time of Governor
Macquarie. Towards the end of his vice-royalty immigrants
were encouraged to come to the colony by grants of land being
given, and a good many possessed of small capital took advantage
of the premium held out by the Government. The prospects of
success in commercial pursuits were full of hope, and the soil
was reported in many parts to be of the best description, and
E


well adapted for agricultural purposes. When immigration
fairly set in, the giving of grants was discontinued.
During the administration of Governor Brisbane many retired
officers of the naval, military and civil service, induced by
the salubrity of the climate and other decided advantages, settled
down in the colony. Their morals generally gave edification,
and their upright conduct inspired confidence. Then also were
added to the population men of superior education and intelli-
gence, most of whom speculated in taking up sheep and cattle
stations, and in the end became immensely rich, through the
profits on their wool and cattle.
Governor Darling succeeded Sir Thomas Brisbane, and
arrived in the colony 19th December, 1825. On his way out to
the colony he called at Hobart Town, capital of Yan Dieman’s
Land, and by virtue of the power entrusted to him by the Home
Government he declared the island colony independent of New
South Wales and a separate Government, except that the
Lieutenant-Governor of Tasmania was subject to the Governor-
in-Chief of New South Wales. When he arrived in Sydney he
appointed the first Legislative Council, composed of the following
members, viz.: Lieutenant-Governor Stewart, who had adminis-
tered the affairs of the colony before his arrival; Chief Justice
Forbes, Archdeacon Scott, Macleay, Colonial Secretary; John
Macarthur, Robert Campbell, sen., and Charles Throsby. At the
same time the Executive Council was formed, consisting of the
Lieutenant-Governor, the Chief Justice, the Archdeacon and the
Colonial Secretary. Whilst Darling was Governor that inestim-
able privilege of the British Constitution was conferred by the
Home Government, viz.—trial by jury in a full and complete
form. The colony had enjoyed trial by jury since 2nd November,
1824; but not complete, because it was only in criminal cases
that a jury was impanelled. The civil cases were decided by a
judge and two magistrates, as assessors; unless both parties
agreed to have a jury, and then the Court was empowered to
supply jurors.
It was during the governorship of Darling that Father
Therry was deprived of his salary, and offered £3OO to quit the
colony. A very old and respectable man, still alive in the colony,
told the writer that Father Therry, being very disconsolate at
thinking he might be compelled to leave his flock, as Father
Flynn had been to leave the colony, called upon Mr. C. Went-
worth, the leading barrister then in the colony, and a most
determined foe to any thing like oppression, who, having heard
his case, told him not to fear, that “he defied the Governor to


send him out of the colony.” The condition of the catholics in
the colony at this time was very disheartening. Subscriptions
were coming in very slowly for the completion of St. Mary’s
church; and the Government was not redeeming its promise, to
be at half the expense; to add to their troubles, the chap-
laincy was taken from Father Therry, and he had to be supported
by the people. The catholics were becoming numerous, but the
majority of them were poor: they had subscribed liberally
towards the erection of St. Mary’s, but it was a great undertaking,
and a heavy tax upon their resources. I have given in the
Appendix a list of those who subscribed their Christmas dues at
St. Mary’s in 1824, amounting only to £2B. Mo doubt he received
more than this : at the different stations he would receive support
according to the means of the congregation. This would be
considered now a small Christmas dues at the stations.
And what must have been the greatest affliction to the Rev.
Father was to be prohibited from visiting the sick in the hospitals
and infirmaries—when, he could not administer to them the
consolations of our holy religion. To show the fortitude and
address of this apostolic man, whilst under ban, he went to visit
a dying man at one of the hospitals; he was stopped by the
guard when about to enter; Father Therry said to him, “ the
salvation of this man depends on my ministration ; which is your
first duty ? The guard, recognizing the right of the man of God,
lowered his arms and permitted him to pass. Another time he
was going into the Infirmary to attend a sick person, when the
door-keeper told him to stop until he ascertained from the
attendant surgeon whether he could be admitted. Whilst he was
away, Father Therry, who knew all the passages of the place,
entered, gave the sick person consolation, and when returning he
met the official, who told him he could not be admitted. Many of
the petty officials were very insolent to Father Therry and his
flock, taking advantage of the circumstances. It was permitted
the catholics to have divine service in the old Court-house, a large
building, now a Public School in Castlereagh-street; but because
their pastor was not recognised by the Government the door was
locked against them ! but in defiance of such insolence the door
was forced open. It is said Mr. Wentworth was consulted as to
what steps the catholics ought to take to secure the court-house
for divine service, as they had as good a right as others to use it
for that purpose. “ What will you do ?” said Wentworth, “ why
take a crowbar and break the door open; and if they take you to
court, send for me, and I’ll defend you.” In the midst of all this
trouble Father Therry was ever cheerful, and his sorrows only


tended to make him more zealous and laborious for the cause of
God and good of his fellow men; which reminds one of the words
of St. Paul, when he says “ There is a sorrow of the world, and a
sorrow that is according to God.” Father Therry was widely
respected by all classes, and highly esteemed. When travelling in
the discharge of his sacred duties every door was open to him and
every assistance given to further the sacred ends he had in view.
In disputes the decision of Father Therry was accepted, and
oftentimes the matter was referred to him for arbitration. He
had a kind word and shake of the hand for every one.
The administration of Governor Darling extended over six
years; he retired on 21st October, 1831. His Vice-royalty was
certainly not popular. He came seemingly to govern with a high
hand, it being then a penal colony. His acts would lead one to
suppose that severe measures were necessary to keep the colonists
in subjection. He was a soldier, accustomed to the routine and
exactness of military life, which brooks no delay or reply, and he
expected every one should bend to his will. He introduced again
the lash and short rations in regard to the unfortunate prisoners,
which had been partly done away with in the time of Governor
Macquarie. He, writers say, meddled and interfered too much in
the details of the Government departments instead of casting the
responsibility on the heads of offices. He is said to have ignored
the control of the Executive and Legislative Councils, which
could have shielded him from much of the opprobrium which he
suffered from the public. Governor Darling estimated himself
rather highly ; confiding too much in his own ability, he fancied
he could manage efficiently all things civil, judicial, and financial.
He wanted more experience in governing a community, and better
knowledge of men and things. He quarrelled with the Press
because it criticised severely and condemned some of his public
measures: and he enlisted the antagonism of several of the leading
and most popular men of the day, such as Mr. C. Wentworth, Mr.
Wardell of the Monitor newspaper, and Mr. Hall of the A ustra-
lian. Two of the editors were prosecuted for libel against the
Government, and lodged in jail. They were sued for penalties
and forfeitures incurred by infringement of the Act for regulating
the Press. Governor Darling was severely condemned by the
public for cruelty towards two soldiers who had committed a petty
larceny, to get out of the army. Their names were Sudds and
Thompson. No doubt it was a very critical time for the King’s
representative to administer the affairs of the colony. The
colonists were very much agitated in demanding the rights and
privileges to which they considered they were entitled by the


British Constitution. They wanted complete trial by jury, and a
Legislative Assembly, to have the power of taxing themselves.
The Home Government was not disposed, as yet, to grant all they
demanded, and the Governor stood between, to carry out the
behests of Downing-street. But he would have succeeded better
had he been more conciliatory. Yet Darling was most exact
and attentive to business, and he cannot be accused of want of
zeal for the common good and advancement of the colony. He
encouraged explorations of the interior which were made by
Major, afterwards Sir Thomas Mitchell, Captain Sturt and
others. Captain Sturt and party were the most fortunate, they
went in a boat on the Murrumbidgee until they came to its
junction with the Murray; which noble river brought them to
South Australia, near Lake Alexandria. Thus Captain Sturt was
the discoverer of that beautiful country of South Australia and
of the Murray River, which now is the boundary between New
South Wales and Port Philip. These rivers are sometimes
navigable, for vessels of small tonnage, a distance of 600 and even
1000 miles. By them the produce of the settlers on their banks is
conveyed to market and they receive their supplies by those rivers.
In the time of Governor Darling Sydney was supplied with water,
from the Botany swamps and lagoons, by means of an aqueduct,
constructed by Mr. James Busby, Mineral Surveyor and Engi-
neer to the Government.
The catholics during the time of Governor Darling were be-
coming numerous and almost equal in number to the members of
the more favoured community of the protestant church. It is a
fact that all the prisoners from Ireland were sent lo New South
Wales, for the last 40 years; and the majority of these being
Roman Catholics, accounts for the catholics being so numerous in
New South Wales; It is said they were not sent to Tasmania,
alias Van Dieman’s Land, because it was intended to make that a
protestant colony; The most of those who were sent from Ireland
were transported for political and agrarian offences. The
political prisoners were exiled for loving their country too well and
desiring to see her free and independent, and their religion
delivered from the oppression of the penal laws. Many of them
were excellent men, and left their native land without a taint on
their moral character, and their children’s children at this day do
honour to their sires.
Many of the catholic emancipists were scattered over the
colony following agricultural pursuits; and by their skill and
industry in farming, had become wealthy. Very few were em-
ployed by the Government; their religion, country, and name of


rebel operated powerfully against them in the social scale. The
catholics were very much depressed in the time of Governor
Darling’s administration; there was no one amongst them of
social standing and influence to advocate their wants and repre-
sent their grievances. The voice of Father Therry would not be
heard : he had quarrelled with the Government and was deprived
of his salary, and there were only six families of catholic gentry
in the colony. The sad condition of the catholics then, and their
subsequent deliverance and liberation would remind one of the
words of our Saviour to his disciples before his passion and
resurrection, where he said, “ Amen, amen I say to you, that you
shall lament and weep, but the world shall rejoice; and you shall
be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.” The
time of sorrow for the catholics of New South Wales was about
to be changed for a time of joy: real joy was about to succeed to
the sorrow of those days.
Towards the end of the year 1829 there arrived in the colony
Mr. Therry, with the appointment, from the Home Government,
of Commissioner of the Court of Requests. He was a catholic
gentleman, who had taken part in the struggles for catholic
emancipation, and had been secretary of the “ National Society
for the Education of the Poor in Ireland,” which was formed in
Dublin in the year 1822. Mr. Roger Therry was a firm and true
catholic ; he deplored the humiliating condition of his co-religion-
ists in New South Wales, and he determined to do all which lay
in his power to raise them in the social scale. During his stay in
England he had made the acquaintance of Mr. Blount, the member
of parliament for Steyning. Mr. Blount had been, previous to
the passing of the Emancipation Act, secretary to the Catholic
Association in England, and he enjoyed the confidence of the
liberal administration of the day. To this amiable and energetic
man he represented, by writing, the great grievances under which
the catholics suffered, and entreated him to use his influence for
them and obtain redress. Mr. Therry has quoted in his book of
Reminiscences of New South Wales and Victoria, a letter which
he received from Mr, Blount in reply, which shows how strongly
he sympathised with the catholic population in the wrongs which
they were enduring, and how anxious he was to assist in obtaining
justice for them. The letter was dated, London, Dec. 1833.
These are the words of Mr. Blount;—“ Nothing can be more
palpably absurd, or more abhorrent to every feeling of Christian
charity than to transport many thousand abandoned wretches
to a distant land, that they may be reformed and become good
members of society, and debar them from the means of learning


the morality or practicing the precepts of religion. Such conduct
would have been too bad in any times; but it is intolerable that
an administration boasting peculiar liberality, and teaching the
people their physical strength, and confiding in the schoolmasters
to enforce obedience to the laws, should condemn so many poor
creatures to the sad necessity of remaining in ignorance of their
social duties. Such however is the state of the catholic convicts
in Australia. It is well worthy of your philanthropic exertions
to remove an error in legislation from our liberal government,
such a danger from the colony, and such a curse from those
wretched beings: and you ought to be zealously seconded by
every friend of humanity at home and abroad, be his creed in
religion or politics what it may. But how is this desirable object
to be obtained ? By giving to catholics, who, though they may
have deviated from the precepts of their religion, yet are con-
vinced of the truth of its doctrines, adequate protection, places'of
religious worship, and spiritual instructors. Whence must funds
be provided for such objects ? Not from charity, but the policy
of the Government; from their intimate conviction that not only
justice and humanity, but the well-being of the colony essentially
depend on the maintenance of public morality.”
Mr. Blount was faithful to his promise, and lost no time to
impress upon the leaders of the Government the policy of
sending religious instructors to the poor outcasts in New South
Wales. The question which he kept constantly before them was
—“ Are the catholics of our foreign dependencies to be good or bad
subjects ? —loyal, orderly, and educated, or factious, ignorant, and
degraded ? ” He exerted himself very much in obtaining a
catholic bishop and clergy to be sent to the colony.

The Arrival of Governor Bourke, 3rd December, 1831.—Great
Meeting of the Catholics on March 30th, 1832. —The Speech
of Roger Therry, representing the grievances of the Catholics.
—Memorial carried at the meeting in favour of Father
Therry.—The arrival of Rev. John McEncroe with the ap-
pointment of Roman Catholic Chaplain, and John Hubert
Plunkett, as Solicitor-General, in May, 1832. —The Very Rev.
Dr. Ullathorne arrives as Vicar-General, 1832. —The Origin
and Provisions of Sir Richard Bourke's Church Act.
Governor Bourke succeeded Darling, and landed on 3rd Dec.,
1831. He was received by the colonists with great welcome and
rejoicings. His fame had gone before him as a man of enlight-
ened and liberal views; a soldier who had greatly distinguished
himself in the wars of South America, and gained there an
experience well suited to enable him to govern the colony. With
his comprehensive mind it was not long before he became master
of all the details of the government, and the state of affairs both
ecclesiastical and civil. He determined to do justice to all, as far
as lay in his power. One of the first steps which he took was to
allay religious discontent, by proceeding to procure assistance to
the different Christian denominations in proportion to their
numbers.
The arrival of Sir E. Bourke filled the Eoman catholics with
great hope: they expected he would prove himself to be what
report made him, an able, just, and liberal Governor, and as the
sequel showed, they were not disappointed.
Not long after the arrival of the Governor the catholics deter-
mined to hold a meeting, and agree upon a memorial, representing
their wants and grievances, and present it to the Governor. One
particular, object of the meeting was, to induce the Government
to redeem its promise of assistance towards the building of St.
Mary’s church. At that time the work done, when valued by a
competent architect, amounted to £5,900, and when all deductions
were made, there remained due to the church by the Government,
£3,000 —ajust and legitimate claim.
This meeting was held in Sydney 30th March, 1832, at the
time a Eoman catholic gentleman, by name Lieutenant Paett, an
officer of the Indian army, on leave of absence, was here, and he
presided at the meeting. The mover of the memorial was Mr.
Therry, then commissioner of the Court of Eequests. He spoke


to the following effect: —“ Though,” he said, “ they were bound to
be thankful for the £SOO that had been recently appropriated for
the completion of the chapel, yet their thanks should partake
somewhat of that gratitude which was described as ‘a sense of
favours to come.’ Their thankfulness for what they have
received should not be construed into an admission that what
had been done was all that ought to be done. The Chief Justice,
he was bound to state, had been their warm advocate on the
occasion of this recent grant, but as the proceedings of the
Council were not published, of course he could not ascertain who
were their supporters, and who were not, but he believed the
general disposition of the council, on the occasion, was kind and
friendly towards the Roman catholics. Upon the part of the
memorial which referred to education, he would only remark,
that whilst the protestant church was unquestionably entitled to
those facilities to which its importance and numbers gave it a
claim, yet the Roman catholic community and the dissenting
congregations had a claim to corresponding facilities according to
their importance and numbers. Now it was admitted that the
Roman catholics constituted more than one-third of the popula-
tion of the colony; yet they were excluded from the school for
teaching trades at Carter’s Barracks, from the School of Industry,
and from the Orphan Schools; nor was there any endowment
which made a provision for the education of Roman catholic
youth. It was but justice to say, however, that a recent resolution
of the Legislative Council had recommended a provision to supply
this desideratum. The Roman Catholics owed it to themselves
and to their advocates at home, to invite the attention of the
Council here, and of the parliament, to the pressing and urgent
necessity of their condition. There were some persons who
refused to sanction any appropriation of the public money for the
uses of the Roman catholics, lest thereby, forsooth, they might
assist in propagating a false religion. No man had a right to use
this doctrine, however privileged or orthodox he might fancy
himself to be. A man’s religion was between God and his con-
science, and he was bound to abide by that faith of the truth of
which he was conscientiously convinced. The public money was
supplied by the catholic as well as by the protestant tax, and
should be applied to the uses of each according to the exigencies
of each. While on this topic he could not forbear from pre-
senting to their consideration one view of the Roman catholics of
the colony which had always impressed itself forcibly upon his
mind. To him the condition of the catholics of the colony ap-
peared to be, in one respect, particularly hard. He adverted to


the circumstances of that portion of their body who resided out
of the district of Sydney; and how vast that portion was might
be easily estimated from the fact, that all the transports from
Ireland, freighted with prisoners, had been invariably sent to
New South Wales : none from Ireland, certainly within the last
eight or ten years, had been sent to the sister colony. The reason
of this arrangement it was immaterial to consider; but it was
material to consider that the fact was so; for it was the fact that
accounted for and explained why it was the Roman catholics
constituted so large a proportion of the population of the colony.
Now it was not an exaggerated estimate to say that three-fourths
of those sent to New South Wales from Ireland were Roman
catholics. In the ship in which he came out there were 200
prisoners, and of these 175 were Roman catholics. This average,
from accurate information which he had obtained, was applicable
to all the ships from Ireland. Let him now trace the progress of
these men, these 200 Irish prisoners, after their arrival in the
colony, sent thither, it should be borne in mind, for the purpose
of being reformed. Perhaps twenty or thirty of them were
assigned as servants in different employments in the district of
Sydney, whilst the remainder were drafted off to Bathurst, Illa-
warra, or Maitland, each place one hundred and fifty miles distant
from Sydney, and where, during the whole term of their sentence,
—and if their sentence were for life, during the whole term of
their existence—no opportunity for religious instruction was
afforded them ; and should death overtake them in their calami-
tous position, their pillow was not soothed by the consolation of
the minister of religion; nor over their untimely grave could their
pastor pour his pious requiem. To the Irish Roman catholic
exile this deprivation added a deep and hitter —and the more
bitter, because an unavowed, and, he believed, an unattended—
aggravation of the punishment of evil to which his sad destiny
had doomed him. In regard to Father Therry, he had now been
for twelve years a Roman catholic clergyman in this colony:
during the greater part of that time he had been the Roman
catholic chaplain; during the whole of that time, in point of zeal,
activity, of useful and efficient discharge of the functions of the
ministry, he had been indefatigable as an officiating priest.
Neither time, nor distance, nor danger—and his duties were often
performed at the real peril of life —ever impeded or obstructed
him in the zealous performance of the sacred duties of his mission.
The duties of the office which he held brought him into frequent
contact with all classes of persons in every district of the colony,
and he never made an assertion of the truth of which he was
58


more convinced, than that the Rev.. Mr. Therry possessed the
unbounded esteem, confidence and affection of all classes of Roman
catholics; and with corresponding confidence he would assert,
that he knew of no act which the Government could perform
towards that body that would be hailed by them with more
delight and gratitude, than the re-appointment of that rev.
gentleman to the Roman catholic chaplaincy of the colony. But
it would be remembered, he added, that similar testimony had
been borne on his behalf in a memorial presented to the Council,
to which the signatures of forty magistrates, the principal civil
and military officers in the colony, and several hundred other
persons were affixed.”
Mr. Therry then read the memorial, and proposed the
adoption of it to the meeting. The memorial represented that
the Government had been most liberal in providing for the edu-
cation of the youth of the established church, and of the other
denominations ; but that for want of means the majority of the
catholic poor were uneducated and without religious instruction.
His Excellency was also requested to restore the Rev. John Joseph
Therry to his position of Roman catholic chaplain.
The motion for the adoption of the memorial was seconded
by John O’Sullivan, and unanimously adopted by the meeting.
This memorial was not presented to Governor Bourke until
more than four months after, and in the mean time arrived in the
colony the Rev. John McEncroe, with the appointment of Roman
catholic chaplain, and John Hubert Plunket, Solicitor-General:
they came in the same vessel. The memorial of the catholics was
presented to the Governor on the 17th August, 1832. The depu-
tation consisted of five gentlemen, two of whom were protestants;
viz., Major Mitchell, Surveyor-General; J. H. Plunket, Solicitor-
General ; S. Moore, senior magistrate of the colony; the Rev. J.
McEncroe, and R. Therry. The names of two thousand persons,
free inhabitants of the colony, were appended to the memorial.
His Excellency gave them a very gracious reception, and having
listened attentively to the reading of the memorial, said: that he
was most anxious to secure for his majesty’s Roman catholic
subjects in the colony a suitable provision for their education and
religious instruction; and he had made known immediately the
resolution of the Legislative Council on the subject. It was not
within the scope of his commission to add to the Roman catholic
chaplains of the colony; but he would lay before the Secretary
of State, without delay, the application of the memorialists in
favour of the Rev. John Joseph Therry. He said he had en-
deavoured to place upon a better footing the catholic schools
59


at present in existence, and was ready to receive any application
for the establishment of additional schools. His Excellency read
extracts from the despatches of Earl Bathurst, Secretary of State,
giving directions to assist in the building of the Roman catholic
chapel.
It was well for the catholics at this time, that the colony
was ruled by a governor so just and generous; and who looked in
his administration, not to the good of the few, but to the welfare
of the entire community. It would have retarded the progress
of the colony very much, had Governor Bourke been an irresolute,
bigoted, and party man. It is evident from the conciliatory action
of the Home government at this time, that it was not intended for
the future to keep up the repressive policy in regard to her
catholic subjects. A different policy from what had been pursued
for so many long years was inaugurated since the passing of the
Emancipation Bill, which removed from the catholics many
disabilities. There was now a liberal government, and the old
tories were disbanded : a new era was dawning over the British
Isles, and the long and dark night of persecution and intolerance
was disappearing. The British Government had now no intention
of fondling and pampering a dominant church in any of her
dependencies. There was a good deal of work to be done to clear
away the accumulated injustice of years. The Roman catholics
especially, and dissenters from the church of England in the
colony, were most unfairly dealt with in the distribution of the
public funds, to which all contribute. The monies to he expended
by the government, in the year 1833, were estimated at the round
sum of £110,252, and more than £19,071 (one-sixth of this sum)
was devoted to the expenditure of the church of England; whilst
only £BOO was allotted to the Roman catholics, who numbered
more than one-third of the population, for the support of clergy
and maintenance of schools; and £6OO appropriated to the kirk
of Scotland. Here was the greatest disproportion and want of
equalization in the distribution of the public revenue. Governor
Bourke took the first steps to promote religious equality in New
South Wales.
Contrast the means and appliances of the catholic church in
the colony in the year 1833 with the state of the church of Eng-
land, and the greatest difference is evident. The staff of the
establishment then consisted of an archdeacon and 16 chaplains,
and they were possessed of eight churches and six chapels. I may
mention that the church of St. James, at the head of King-street,
in Sydney, and which was first intended for a court-house, was
nearly roofed in so far back as the year 1820, and they had at


that time a fine stone church in Parramatta, capable of containing
400, and commodious churches in Windsor and Liverpool; and
the poor catholics had “ not where to lay their heads,” except to
attend the divine mysteries in the court-house of Sydney; and
outside of Sydney, in the towns of Parramatta, Windsor, and
Liverpool, in the houses of the catholics : there is no question,
therefore, of the extreme partiality of the government of the day
to the church of England.
Before I give an account of the Church Act, I may state, it
was in the year 1832 that the Very Rev. Dr. Ullathorne arrived
in the colony. The origin of his appointment as Vicar-General
was related to me by the late venerable Arch-bishop Polding. On
account of the disagreement of Father Therry with the colonial
authorities, the Home government applied to Dr. Bramston, then
the Roman catholic bishop of London, for the appointment of a
Roman catholic Ecclesiastical Superior for New South Wales.
Dr. Bramston applied to the Benedictine congregation of Down-
side, and the appointment fell upon Dr. Ullathorne, who came to
the colony as Vicar-General of Bishop Slater of the Mauritius.
Bishop Slater held jurisdiction from the Holy See over all the
islands to the east of Mauritius ; consequently over New Holland,
Tasmania, New Zealand, &c. An amusing occurrence was told to
me when I was in England, by the late estimable Dr. Heptonstal,
illustrative of the disinterestedness and devotedness of Father
Ullathorne, when he was leaving for Australia. Dr. Heptonstal
met him in London just on the eve of his departure, and in
bidding him adieu, the young ecclesiastic, about to embark on such
a long voyage, and for what was then a comparatively unknown
land, manifested not the slightest regret at breaking the dearest
ties, no more than if he were going to see the brothers of his order
at Downside or Ampleforth. Before Father Ullathorne came to
the colony he had been assisting Father Sinnot in the manage-
ment of Ampleforth College, a Benedictine establishment, for two
years, because of a reconstruction which had been brought about
by Dr. Bains, the bishop. Father Ullathorne, on his way out,
touched at Hobart Town, in Van Dieman’s Land. The state of
that very small portion of the church very much displeased him.
Father Connelly had been there alone twelve years and not much
was done; not even a suitable church was built. It should be
considered that the government there were just as remiss and
disinclined to help the catholics as they were at Sydney. The
catholics were few and very poor ; the protestants had there a
commodious and substantial stone building, capable of containing
1,000. It was opened for divine worship in the year 1819.


The famous despatch of Sir Richard Bourke to the Right
Hon. E. G. Stanley, Secretary of State for the Colonies, was dated
30th September, 1833; in which his Excellency, in clear and
unmistakable language, represents the religious -wants and wishes
of all sections of the community, and proposes measures calculated
in his estimates to give general satisfaction.
He began by stating that he had received the order of the
King in Council (W. IX.), dissolving the church and school corpo-
ration in New South Wales; but without any information of the
views of his majesty’s government as to the future maintenance
and regulation of churches and schools within the colony. He
observed that the inhabitants of the colony were of many different
religious persuasions ; that the members of the church of England
were the most numerous; but there were large bodies of Roman
catholics; and presbyterians of the church of Scotland, besides
protestant dissenters of many different denominations, and
that probably one-fifth of the whole population of the colony was
catholic. He said that the clergy of the church of England were
supported chiefly by payments from the Treasury, and to a small
amount, by the rent and sale of lands, formerly granted to the
church and school corporation. That the charge for the church
of England in the following year would amount to £11,542 10s.
The whole charge on the public treasury for the church of Scot-
land was £6OO, and for the Roman catholic chaplains and chapels
£1,500 “In regard to the catholics,” he said, “they
possess one large and handsome church, in Sydney, not yet com-
pleted. In aid of its construction, donations, amounting in all to
about £1,200 have been at different times granted by this
government. The sum of £4OO (included in the £1,500 before
mentioned), has been appropriated by the Council to be paid in
the next year, in aid of a similar sum to be raised by private
subscriptions, for erecting Roman catholic chapels at Maitland and
Campbell Town.” A chapel was begun at the latter place, as well
as at Parramatta, some years ago; but neither have been com-
pleted for want of funds. “The chaplains” says Sir Richard Burke,
“of the church of England are provided with glehes of 40 acres
each, or with a money allowance in lieu, and with houses or
lodging money. No advantage of this kind is possessed by the
clergy of the church of Scotland, or by the Roman catholics
Such an unequal distribution of support cannot be supposed to be
acceptable to the colonists, who provide the funds from which
this distribution is made. Accordingly, the magnitude of the
sums annually granted for the support of the church of England
in New South Wales, is very generally complained of, and a


petition to the Governor and Legislative Council has been lately
prepared at a public meeting, and very numerously signed, praying
for a reduction of the expenditure.” The Governor goes
on to remark, that in a new country, to which persons of all
religious persuasions are invited to resort, it will be impossible to
establish a dominant and endowed church without much hostility,
and great improbability of its becoming permanent. The inclina-
tion of these colonists, which keeps pace with the spirit of the
age, is decidedly adverse to such an institution ; and I fear the
interests of religion would be prejudiced by its establishment.
If, on the contrary, support were given as required, to every one
of the three great divisions of Christians indifferently, and the
management of the temporalities left to themselves, I conceive
that the public treasury might in time be relieved of a consider-
able charge ; and what is of much greater importance, the people
would become more attached to their respective churches, and be
more willing to listen to, and obey the voice of their several
pastors.
The following were the arrangements proposed by Sir
Richard Bourke. The first was, that whenever the congregation
subscribed £3OO for the erection of a church and a clergyman’s
residence, that upon application, an equal sum should be issued
from the colonial treasury in aid of the undertaking; that
the building be vested in trustees. A chaplain of the creed of
the congregation shall then be appointed by the crown in the
manner now practised, and his stipend shall be issued by the
Governor at the following rate: —If, in the district where the
church or chapel to which he shall be appointed, is situated, there
be a resident population of one hundred adults, who shall sub-
scribe a declaration setting forth their desire to attend such place
of worship, the chaplain shall receive from the treasury one
hundred pounds a-year; if there be two hundred adults, one
hundred and fifty pounds; and if five hundred adults, then two
hundred pounds; which is proposed as the maximum salary to be
paid by the government to a chaplain of whatever persuasion.
In regard to the appointment of Dr. Ullathorne as Yicar-General
of the catholic church in the colony, he says: —“ And the recent
appointment of a Vicar-General, with whose discretion, character,
and morals I have the greatest reason to be satisfied, will, I hope,
effect what is required in the Roman catholic church. lam in-
clined however,” he continues, “ to think that the salary of £2OO
a-year is too low for the office, and that it might be advanta-
geously raised to £4OO, to enable the Vicar-General to visit
frequently the chapels in the interior.”


His Excellency states, in the foregoing outline, “ I have
limited the support of the government to the three principal
Christian congregations in the colony.” He states, that “in both
the male and female orphan schools, the children are brought up
exclusively in the doctrines of the church of England.”
There is in Parramatta a considerable boarding school, called
the King’s School, at the head of which is a clergyman of the
church of England, with a salary of £lOO a-year only, but who
has been promised the occupation of a house at the public expense,
to contain from sixty to eighty boarders and day scholars. The
three schools thus described, now are, and will in all probability
continue to be, exclusively for the church of England. They may
be supported, and the orphan schools extended, by means of the
income which will, at no great distance of time, be derived from
the lands granted under seal to the Church and School Corpora-
tion ; and which, in its dissolution, became, by the terms of the
charter, vested in the crown, to be disposed of by his majesty,
his heirs and successors, “in such manner as shall appear most
conducive to the maintenance and promotion of religion, and the
education of youth in the said colony.” “ Under these terms,”
says Sir R. Bourke, “ the income of the lands may be applied to
the support of any of the churches or schools referred to in this
despatch.”
“ The primary schools, or parish schools established by the
corporation, which are thirty-five in number, situated in various
parts of the colony, attended upon an average by 1,248 children
of both sexes, are charged in the estimates for 1834, at £2,756 :
in all of them the catechism of the church of England is taught.
Thus the charge for all the schools of this description for the year
1834 is taken at £5,736, to which should be added a vote of the
Legislative Council of £2,300, for the site and buildings for the
King’s School at Parramatta The sum of £BOO has been
voted for the Roman catholic schools for the year 1834.”
“You may thus perceive, sir, the great disproportion which
exists in the support given by the State to schools formed for the
use of the different denominations of Christians in the colony; a
disproportion not based on the relative numbers of each, but
guided, it would seem, by the same principles which have regulated
the support afforded to the different churches.”
I have given in the above extract the principal matter
contained in the despatch of Sir Richard Bourke in regard to
ecclesiastical matters. These suggestions of his Excellency must
have been most acceptable to the Home government; since,
having dissolved the Church and School Corporation, and the


REV. JOHN MCENCROE.




lands of same reverting to the crown, they were enabled to
sanction those measures of the colonial government which seemed
to be most conducive to the public good.
The Home government took time (two years) to consider the
matter; but a most gracious reply was received from Lord
Viscount Glenelg, then at the head of the colonial department,
during the administration of Lord Melbourne. His communication
to Sir Richard Bourke bears date 30th November, 1835 ; in which
document he acknowledges with pleasure, both on his part
and the part of the others of His Majesty’s government, “ for the
full and clear statement which he transmitted to them, of the
existing means of religious instruction and education, in connection
with the wants and circumstances of the colony ; and also for the
suggestions with which you have followed up that statement.
Further on His Lordship states; —“ I am disposed, therefore,
to commit to the Governor and the Legislative Council the task
of suggesting and enacting such laws and regulations for the
distribution and appropriation of the funds applicable to the
general purposes of religion and education, as they consider best
adapted to the exigencies of the colony.”
“ In the general principle upon which that plan is founded as
applicable to New South Wales, His Majesty’s government entirely
concur. In these communities,” he goes on to state, “of the
Australian colonies, formed and rapidly multiplying under most
peculiar circumstances, and comprising great numbers of presby-
terians and Roman catholics, as well as members of the church of
England, it is evident that the attempt to select any one church
as the exclusive object of public endowment, even if it were
advisable in every other respect, would not long be tolerated.
To none of the numerous Christians of those persuasions should
opportunities be refused for worship and education on principles
which they approve.”
“ The plan which you have suggested appears to me fully in
accordance with these views in both its branches; —in that which
relates to the places and ministers of worship, or, as it may be
more briefly described to public religion; and in that which
concerns public education.”
Now nothing could be more just than the conclusion come to
by the Home government, and communicated to His Excellency
through Lord Glenelg; and it would have been inconsistent for
them to have acted otherwise. It is strange how things happen,
at times: this reply emanated from the whig liberal government,
under Lord Melbourne. The administration of Sir Robert Peel
F


was adverse to making any alterations in the protestant church
establishment, and were defeated in April, 1835, on a motion to
appropriate a portion of the church revenues to education.
The Church Act, initiated by Sir Richard Bourke, became the
law of the colony on the 29th July, in the year 1836. This
memorable Act, which, to a certain extent, put down religious
dissensions, established also equality amongst the different
Christian bodies, although chiefly framed by the Governor.
Nevertheless, as he intimates in his despatch, he was indebted for
several of its clauses to suggestions from experienced liberal and
enlightened men, both protestants and catholics, of the colony.
I come now to the time when Dr. Bolding was appointed
bishop. I have heard from his own lips, that he was appointed,
at first, by the Holy See, Vicar-Apostolic of Madras, in India,
with the title of Hierocoesarea; but Dr. Bolding declined the
appointment, after full deliberation, although, in some respects,
there were strong inducements. It was a very important charge
and well able to support the dignity of a bishop: but it had also
its drawbacks; a terribly hot climate; and there were differences
with the Bortuguese clergy—a kind of schism. It was about this
time that Father Therry, being the senior priest in the colony, had
disagreed with the government: and on account of this an appli-
cation was made to Dr. Bramston, bishop of London, for the
appointment of a Roman catholic Ecclesiastical-Superior for New
South Wales. Dr. Bramston applied to the Benedictine congre-
gation of Downside. I have related that the appointment fell
upon Dr. Ullathorne. In course of time Governor Bourke wrote
home that Father Ullathorne was giving them every satisfaction,
and had secured the confidence of the catholic population. Dr.
Folding received a letter from Father Ullathorne in the year 1833,
describing the mission, and giving an account of his missionary
labours.


CHAPTER VII.
The appointment of Dr. Folding as Bishop-Vicar-Apostolic of
New Holland.—Consecrated Feast of S.S. Peter and Paul,
29th June, 183 4. —Arrives at Hobart, 6th August, 1835. —
Arrives in Sydney 13th September, 1835.—Installation
of the Bishop in St. Mary’s, 22nd September, 1835.—The plan
of the Bishop for the reformation of the manners of the
people.—The acknowledgements of Governor Bourke as to the
change of conduct. — Laying, by the Bishop, of the foundation
stone of St. Patrick’s Church, at Parramatta.—Petition
of Bishop Folding, to Government, for more Priests.
Representations of the state of religion in Australia were sent
to Rome, and in the year 1834 Dr. Folding was requested by the
Holy See to accept of the appointment of Vicar-Apostolic of New
Holland, Van Dieman’s Land, &c., as bishop-in-partibus. He gave
his consent, and on 2nd May, 1834, was appointed; in the
following month, the Feast of Sts. Peter and Paul, he was
consecrated.
Full of zeal and fervour, the new and first bishop of
Australia immediately began to select subjects for his distant and
extensive vicariate. Many were the applicants to help him in
his arduous mission; nine persons were chosen to accompany him,
viz., three priests, Revs. Fisher, J. Corcoran, and A. Gotham, 0.5.8.;
Rev. J. B. Sumner, 0.5.8., sub-deacon; catechists and eccle-
siastical students, Rev. John Spencer, 0.5.8., professed; Rev. H.
Gregory, 0.5.8., professed; and Messrs. Harding and Kenny. The
bishop applied to the Home government for pecuniary aid to assist
in bringing out those missionaries to the colony. It was in
February, 1835, that Lord Aberdeen appointed four additional
Roman Catholic chaplains for New South Wales, with an annual
stipend of £l5O to each, and in this number was included
Dr. Folding, the bishop; the catechists received £IOO each.
When all things were ready, the heroic party met in Liverpool at
the Misses Slater, relatives of the bishop, and nieces of Bishop
Slater of the Mauritius.
It was in the month of April, 1835, that the company,
with the Right Reverend Dr. Folding, sailed from Liverpool
in the good old ship “ Oriental ”; she was towed to Birkenhead
by a steamer, on which were a great many of the bishop’s friends
and admirers, wishing him God speed and praying for the success
of his glorious mission. When the “ Oriental ” was leaving
Liverpool and moving down the Mersey, the poor Irish labourers
at the docks gave three hearty cheers for a prosperous voyage.


Alas ! Some of them had friends in that far distant land, to
whom they hoped the bishop and clergy would give consolation.
It was all well with us, (the writer was one of the party) till we
reached the Bay of Biscay; then old ocean seemed to dispute our
passage; we encountered a terrible sea, and were tossed to and fro
by the winds and waves, and never shall I forget the last assault,
when a towering wave, erect as a wall, fell over us, forced in the
front of the cuddy and cabins; their contents and seats were
floating in the saloon. But the old East Indiaman stood it
bravely, and this was the first and last rude shock she received.
After this we enjoyed fine weather and fair winds, with nothing
to incommode us except le mal de mer. So soon as we were
recovered from our sickness, and able to keep our equilibrium, by
the directions of the bishop we were engaged in study—some
studying theology; and there were frequent religious conferences,
over which Dr. Bolding always presided; and others employed in
preparatory studies, under the direction of a priest—so that the
ship became like a small ecclesiastical seminary. When the
vessel was steady we had mass every morning, and the bishop
gave us a discourse every Sunday. We were becalmed at the
line, and had only crossed it about a fortnight when a great
affliction befell us in the loss of one of the priests, the Rev.
Fisher. He was sickly when he came on board, but it was hoped
that the sea voyage would restore to him his health. He died
calmly and resigned to the will of God, having received the last
rites of the church at the hands of the good bishop. Most serene
was the afternoon, when wrapped in a canvas shroud his remains
were lowered from the Archbishop’s cabin into a watery grave;
both sea and sky in their solemn silence seemed to condole with
us. The sacred mysteries had been celebrated that morning by
every priest for the repose of his soul, and matins and lauds were
said around his remains before he was committed to the deep.
“ Requiescat in pace.”
The “ Oriental” had favorable winds and fine weather till we
neared the Derwent River, in Tasmania, where we were prevented
by contrary winds for some days from reaching Hobart Town.
We cast anchor in the Derwent, some distance from the town, on
the 6th August, 1835. There for the first time we enjoyed the
delights of an Australian climate; smooth as glass were the waters
of this majestic river, and not a leaf stirred on its thickly wooded
banks, nor did a cloud float on the rich blue expanse of the
heavens, not a breath of wind to stir the sails. The brave old
ship after the travel of 16,000 miles lay motionless on the bosom
of the waters, with her image perfectly reflected from the glassy


surface. We were soon surrounded by many boats, full of people
curious to see the new arrivals and gather some news from home.
Lieutenant Small was the first visitor. Some of us were rather
disappointed at the civilized appearance of our visitors; for we
expected to see canoes filled with sable strangers, the native blacks;
we thought the former rather common place, not differing in face,
clothing, or manners, from those we might have seen had we only
reached as far as the Firth of Forth, in Scotland. Two of the
bishop’s party went to Hobart Town, the Reverends Corcoran and
Sumner, and they brought us the news that the town was larger
than they thought, and that an old priest, viz. Father Connelly,
had been there alone for twelve years; that there were some
respectable catholics, but his flock was not numerous; but it
gave us a good opinion of the land and climate when we saw in
their hands a few apples which they brought from Father
Connelly’s garden. His Excellency, Governor Arthur, sent his
boat, well manned, to take the bishop ashore. The day we left the
ship we were introduced to Father Connelly, at his residence, by
the bishop, and dined there. His place was situated a little above
where the catholic cathedral now stands and contiguous to his
small church. This structure was certainly not creditable to the
catholics of Hobart Town—a small oblong rough building for
divine worship, and the flooring boards were not laid. Still it
must be taken into consideration that the catholics were few and
not wealthy, and the Government was by no means liberal in
those days.
Father Connelly was a man of no small ability and
attainments; but he had become rather antiquated in his manners,
on account of being so long by himself. He was a native of the
North of Ireland, very witty and full of dry humour and caustic
remarks, and had often shown great adroitness in his corre-
spondence with those in authority. A singular story is related of
him in regard to a convert whom he had converted to the
catholic church. The name of the man was Pierce. The
narration is, that this man Pierce escaped from Macquarie
Harbour in Van Dieman’s Land, with six companions ; they lost
their way in the bush and were reduced to the last extremity by
hunger. The demon provoked Pierce to that extent that he rose
up against his companions, killed and eat them. He gave himself
up and was sent back to Macquarie Harbour. He again escaped
with a man named Cox, whom, in like manner, he killed. Pierce
appeared in the settled districts with a bag containing an arm of
his victim, Cox. Father Connelly wrote an account of Pierce’s
life, in Irish, when he Pierce was in prison awaiting the fulfilment


o£ the last sentence of the law. Father Connelly read it on the
scaffold, folding up the paper and putting it in his pocket.
Governor Philip, who thought Father Connelly rather a simple
kind of man, sent his orderly with the request to favor him with the
account of Pierce’s life. The priest sent it, but the Governor nor
any of the officials “ could make it out.” They thought it was
Hebrew, and had to send for Father Connelly to translate it.
This was a standing joke ever afterwards on the Governor, who
had thought very little of the attainments of the humble priest.—
Taken from a letter of C. Fitzpatrick.
The bishop was cordially received by the catholic laity;
and those of them who were in good circumstances and influential
showed him every respect. There were amongst these Messrs.
Halket, Driscol, Doctors Hall and Rowe, Lieut. Small and others.
Dr. Hall is still alive, having reached the ripe and mellow age of
seventy-three. During the short stay of the Bishop a great deal
was done for the spiritual well-being of the catholics of Van
Dieman’s Land, alias Tasmania. He appointed the Rev. A. Cotham
to the spiritual charge of the Mission with Father Connelly, who
had been there for so many years ; he also established a catholic
school in Hobart Town and obtained from the government £9O
as a salary for the teacher. The first teacher was Mr. John
Kenny, one of the ecclesiastical students, who came with the
bishop to the colony. At the request of Dr. Folding he
remained for six months to organize the school, and instruct the
children in the Christian doctrine. Whilst the bishop was in
Tasmania, he laid the foundation stone of a church at Richmond,
and visited various parts of the colony, forming congregations
and imparting new life into the catholics, who rejoiced to see the
day when they were visited by a bishop appointed by the
successor of St. Peter.
Bishop Folding left Hobart Town on sth September for
Sydney, in the same ship the “ Oriental,” in which he came,
accompanied by one priest, three religious who were professed
monks of the order of St. Benedict and two ecclesiastical students
viz; —Messrs. Harding and Gorman. He left in Hobart Town
Reverend A. Cotham and Mr. John Kenny. The “ Oriental ”
arrived in Sydney with the Bishop and his party on Sunday, 13th
September, 1835. The installation of the bishop in the cathedral
of St. Mary’s took place on Sunday, 20th of the same month. It
was an imposing ceremony. The bishop, clad in mitre and cope,
and holding the crosier, proceeded with his chaplain to the
principal entrance of St. Mary’s church, where he was received by
the vicar-general, the Very Reverend W. Ullathorne and the clergy,
70


they then walked in procession to the sanctuary, where they kneeled
in prayer for a time; during the procession the Te Deum was
sung by the choir accompanied by the organ; then the bishop
ascended the steps of the altar, and took his seat in front of the
congregation. The bulls of consecration from the Holy See were
read by the vicar-general and then the clergy one by one kneeled
before the bishop and made their submission. The vicar-general
when introducing his lordship to his flock, delivered an appropriate
discourse which deeply moved the bishop. His lordship then for
the first time addressed his flock in a most feeling and impressive
manner, when he dwelt with considerable force upon the merits
of the reverend gentleman, who had filled for some time the
office of vicar-general; and spoke of the excellent qualities of
Father Therry, the pastor to whose zeal they were indebted for
the noble structure in which they were then assembled and whose
absence on this occasion seemed to be much felt by the
congregation. He concluded by complimenting the gentlemen
who had accompanied him, and hoped that the flock would abide
by the instructions of those who had forsaken their country and
friends to administer to their spiritual wants. High mass was
then celebrated by the bishop ; at the end of which he gave the
solemn benediction, standing with mitre on head and crosier in
hand. There was a very crowded congregation, and a great many
protestants, both ladies and gentlemen, were present. The choir
was very efficient, and Mrs. Russ, who will be well remembered by
many of the old colonists, with her exquisite voice sang the most
difficult passages of the mass, to the delight and admiration of all.
It was remarked by a contemporary print, that from what had
been heard of Dr. Folding, they were led to anticipate the best
results, both in a religious and moral point of view, and hailed
his arrival with the greatest satisfaction.
The Bishop, Dr. Folding, was only provided by the Home
government with the same salary as the priests who accompanied
him, viz.: £l5O per annum; but that was certainly a very
small allowance for a bishop, under the circumstances, to enable
him to support his dignity and to answer the many demands sure
to be made upon him. The committee of St. Mary’s taking these
things into consideration, memorialized the Governor, praying that
an adequate salary be provided for the Right Reverend Dr.
Bolding. This memorial was laid upon the table of the Legislative
Council by His Excellency Governor Bourke on 18th September,
1835. After the deliberation of the council, it was moved on the
twenty-second of the same month, that His Excellency the
Governor be requested to convey to the Right Honorable the
71


Secretary for the Colonies, the recommendation of the council,
that an annual salary of £SOO be allowed to the Roman Catholic
clergyman exercising episcopal authority in this colony, with the
sanction of His Majesty’s Government. I would here remark from
the wording of the motion, viz., “ Roman Catholic Clergyman ”
that the gentlemen of the council had a difficulty in recognizing
Dr. Folding as a real bishop, although eighteen centuries of
apostolic succession gave him an undoubted claim to the title;
it was only pressure from without which forced them to acquiesce
in the proposal.
In commencing to give an account of the labours of Bishop
Folding as vicar apostolic, it will be well to inform the reader of
the vast extent of his vicariate: He had to administer to a territory
in New Holland, extending from Sydney to Queensland in the
north, distant 500 miles ; to Cape Howe in the south, distant 300
miles; and reaching from Sydney to Bathurst on the, west,
distant 144 miles ; beyond these places at the time, in the year
1835, the population was very sparse, and the towns which have
risen to such great importance were only being formed, or not yet
in existence. The bishop had also to attend to the spiritual wants
of Tasmania, i.e. Van Dieman’s Land. The catholic population
of New South Wales, according to the census taken one year
after the arrival of Dr. Folding, amounted to 21,898, and in Van
Dieman’s Land they numbered not less than 7,000 souls. The
bishop did not delay in sending the few labourers at his disposal
into this portion of the vineyard of God’s church, which had been
entrusted to his pastoral care. Father Gotham, as stated, he left
in Tasmania with Father Connelly: he removed Father Therry
from Sydney and placed him in Campbelltown; Campbelltown
contained 287 catholics, Appin, Menangle, Narellin and Cooke,
810; and he had charge of Appin, Illawarra and Argyle. There
was great discontent, on the part of the catholics in Sydney, to
the removal of Father Therry, who had done so much for the
catholic cause there; but his new appointment was a larger
honor, and he preferred to labour in those districts. The bishop
arranged that Father Therry, who had been deprived of his salary,
should receive in testimony of his merits, a stipend equal to that
of the colonial chaplain. The Reverend J. Corcoran was appointed
to Windsor, Richmond and Currajong; the Reverend J.V. Dowling
was placed at Maitland, on the Hunter River. Windsor at this
time contained 228 catholics, Richmond 171, Hundred of Richmond
102, County Cook 534, West Maitland 365, East Maitland 200.
The very reverend the vicar-general, Dr. Ullathorne, remained
for some time with the bishop in Sydney and then took charge of
72


Parramatta, and resided there. The bishop retained in Sydney
the Reverend John McEncroe, a priest most devoted to his duties
in visiting the sick and comforting the poor afflicted prisoners,
and withal a man of learning and great energy of character.
Like a true missionary, the first object of the bishop was to
reform the morals of his people, and enforce the discipline of
the church. Vice was to be removed : Many were at variance
with the laws of God and His church : Intemperance was very
prevalent, with all its attendant evils; the marriage bond was
not respected, and licentiousness of manners was general, and
much fraudulency and overreaching in business; yet there were
those, not a few in the catholic community, whose conduct was
most exemplary, who flourished in faith and virtue, and had
contributed much to preserve the faith and maintain virtue.
The bishop and his clergy were indefatigable in their exertions
to bring about a reformation of manners, and the greatest
success, by the grace of God, resulted from their exertions. In the
first relation of the mission of New Holland, which Bishop Folding
presented to the congregation of the propagation of the faith in
Rome, he details the plan adopted to obtain that good end. “We
have,” he says, “ the inexpressible satisfaction of being eye witness
to a decided change in the conduct and manners of our flock. The
simplicity of the first ages seemed to be renewed, in the prompt-
ness with which they heard and obeyed the admonitions of their
pastors. From week to week we have been employed in hearing
the general confession of individuals, who, on account of their
circumstances, or through negligence, have remained immersed in
sin for forty or fifty years, and even a longer time. It being of
the greatest importance to have order in our missionary life, we
formed a plan which we follow to the present day. We commence
at an early hour in the morning, and place ourselves in the church,
or house used for that purpose, and remain there until some one
comes to confession. At 10 o’clock a.m., the sacraments of baptism
and matrimony are administered ; afterwards the hospitals are
visited, the prisons, the jails, and finally the sick living in the
city and suburbs. Thus is occupied the day until the evening,
when the funerals are attended. Then only can we repose for
awhile, and apply ourselves to our spiritual exercises, although
they are frequently interrupted, and even our sleep during the
night. In the evening we instruct our converts, It need not
be added that the Sunday is a day of incessant occupation Each
one celebrates mass twice, and it is necessary to give two or three
instructions, besides continual attendance in the confessional.
In the course of a few months there was a visible change in the
73


entire population, it being impossible that a reform such as this
should take place in one third of the population without pro-
ducing a certain effect in the remainder. In consequence, the
public authorities acknowledged that there was an amelioration,
concluding from the general tranquillity throughout the colony,
and from the diminution of public crime.”
The writer well remembers the complete disinterestedness
shown by the bishop in the discharge of those duties : he took his
share, as a simple priest in the labours with his priests, without
reserve, except when the general interests required his attention.
Every day he attended in the confessional, and I have seen him
delayed on the Saturdays till nearly midnight in the old chapel of
St. Joseph: his confessional was always thronged, for he was a wise,
prudent, and consoling confessor, and well knew how to pour oil
and wine into the wounds of the soul. He took his turn in
preaching, and some will recollect the great power and unction of
his words in those days. He visited the hospitals and prisons,
inspiring patience and resignation, and encouraging the poor
sufferers to be fervent and to lay aside all tepidity and repugnance
in the service of God. I once accompanied him late at night to
the old jail, then at the end of George-street, where lay a young man,
in the prime and vigour of life, under the sentence of death for
bushranging; he went to strengthen him for his terrible end, and
remained a long time praying and instructing him; the man was
executed the following morning, and to show the kindness of the
good bishop, he brought him two large apples from his own garden,
to cool his feverish mouth.
There was one cause which contributed very much to the
moral improvement amongst the prisoners: Every month, and
sometimes more frequently, there arrived in the colony vessels
filled with prisoners, who were transported from England, Ireland,
and Scotland ; a great many of these were catholics. (From the
beginning of the year 1836, to the year 1841, there were sent to
New South Wales upwards of 18,000 prisoners : each prison ship
carried from 200 to 300). They remained, when the vessel
arrived, according to the Government regulations, for fourteen
days on board the ship, until the necessary preparations were
made for their assignment to masters in different parts of the
colony. As might be supposed, they did not spend these days of
indolence profitably, but sometimes rather sinfully. Bishop
Folding considered it his duty to represent to the Governor, that
the time could be employed very usefully if they were permitted
to land and receive instructions, and other means which religion
offers. The Governor very willingly consented to the request,
74


and the prisoners were allowed, for ten or twelve days, to attend
the instructions of their respective pastors, catholic and protestant.
Dr. TJllathorne, in his evidence before the committee on
transportation, gives the following account;— * “ The catholic
prisoners, who are about one-third of those who arrive, with the
consent of the Government, remain ten days in Sydney before
they are assigned, for the purpose of obtaining religious and
other instruction. They are marched to our church at six in the
morning, and remain till about 11 o’clock, they are then
again marched to the church at three, and remain till about six.
The bishop himself appears personally amongst them, and after
giving them an exhortation they are then classed; those who
have neglected the duties of religion altogether for the course of
one year, those for three, those for seven, those for ten, and those
for life. They are then subject to an examination as to their
dispositions, and the amount of religious knowledge they may
possess. After this they are again classed : the best of them are
selected as monitors: our ecclesiastical students act as catechists ;
a clergyman is called to assist from the interior, and after they
have gone through a series of religious exercises and through a
series of individual converse with the clergy, they then after that
course of their instruction, go through another series of instruction
with regard to their condition as prisoners, and also in reference
to their masters, and the law, and the Government, and the
particular dangers that surround them. After this they proceed
to their assignment.” These exercises were introduced Ist
January, 1837.
There can bd no question as to the beneficial moral effects of
this plan to the prisoners; and many of them attribute their
future virtue and welfare to this spiritual retreat of ten days,
under the eyes of the bishop and clergy. Nay, the sincerity and
piety with which those unfortunate men comported themselves,
made a deep impression on the minds of the faithful. It is
related that on one of these occasions, when the bishop was
administering the holy communion to about one hundred of them,
he was interrupted by the sobs and cries of a person present in the
church; she was at first taken to be a maniac ; the bishop sent
her word to remain quiet, and he would speak to her after the
service. After mass, and whilst he was yet in the sanctuary, she
came to him and said she had been a great sinner, and that for
thirty years she had not been at confession, that Father Therry and
the other priests had frequently admonished her ; that she had
* Page 36. No. 324.
75


abandoned the church in order not to he disturbed by the sermons of
the bishop and the other clergy; but what she had seen that
morning had made a strong impression which she could not
remove ; that she wished to turn to God, and begin by making
her confession without delay. She made her confession, and
continued to persevere in her good dispositions.
It was remarked by Bishop Folding, in his relation to the
Holy See, that before this_ plan was adopted of preparing the
prisoners, who had newly arrived, by giving them a spiritual
retreat, instruction, and the sacraments, it was observed that
many of the newly arrived were put in prison, either through
their folly or wickedness; but more frequently by the persuasions
of designing rogues who took advantage of their ignorance and
induced them to steal and rob their masters, in the hope of having
part of the plunder. “We put the unfortunate penitents on their
guard against such artifices. We do not permit them to depart
to their destination until they are fully instructed in their
religious obligations, and well advised how they are to conduct
themselves to obtain an amelioration of their unhappy condition,
particularly insisting on industry, sobriety, fidelity, and obedience
to their masters. After this the prisons were not filled with the
new arrivals. It was universally remarked that a great change
had taken place in the behaviour of the prisoners throughout the
colony; and it is worthy of observation, that of those who were
condemned to death within three years after our arrival, scarcely
one of the many was of those who had been instructed and
prepared by us. The number of the public executions were con-
siderably diminished. In the year of our arrival twenty-two
were condemned, several of whom were converted in the prison ;
the year following twelve; in the next seven; and since the
number has gradually decreased.”
Governor Bourke, in reply to certain questions proposed by
the Secretary of State, wrote as follows: “ They, the prisoners, on
their arrival were granted a few hours in the day to receive
instructions from the clergy of the different communions. To
give a longer time for this instruction, Dr. Bolding, the Roman
Catholic Bishop, shortly after his arrival in New South Wales,
requested that the time be prolonged between the arrival and
consignment of the prisoners, which was granted. The attention
paid to those of his communion has been given with great
earnestness and regularity; and there is reason to believe that
the result has been beneficial, both to those who have received his
admonitions and to the public in general.”


The first year after the arrival of Bishop Bolding was filled
with many important events in connection with religion. The
first time the bishop administered the sacrament of confirmation
was on Sunday, 28th February, 1836; it was then given to 60
or 70 soldiers of the 17th Regiment, It was remarked at the
time by a correspondent, that he often heard it said, “ better the
Christian better the soldier,” and he had no doubt of the truth of
the saying; for a man who goes into the battle field in the peace
of his Maker cannot have the dread of death staring him in the
face, but advances boldly to meet the enemies of his country,
feeling confident, if he falls, of doing his duty to both God and
man. This holy rite had been administered in the colony
before, by the Very Rev. J. O’Flynn, who had the power to give
confirmation, but this was the first time a Bishop had administered
the sacrament in the colony.
The next catholic work of importance done by the bishop Was
the blessing and laying of the foundation stone of St. Patrick’s
Church, at Paramatta. It was said, then, it is high time that in
the thriving and flourishing district of Parramatta something in
the shape of a decent place of worship should be erected for the
catholics, who comprise so great a portion of the community. On
Thursday, 17th March, 1836, St. Patrick’s Day, the inhabitants of
Parramatta witnessed a religious spectacle, the first of its kind
in the colony.
All the catholic clergy of the colony were in attendance,
and a very large assemblage of catholics from all parts,
with many persons professing other creeds, were gathered
round the foundation at the time appointed. The bishop, clergy,
and assistants walked in procession to the site. The bishop was
richly vested in rochet, stole and cope, with mitre and crosier, the
clergy were vested with beautiful chausibles of silk, gold and
embroidery work, and the cantors had on copes of costly material.
The bishop delivered an address on the occasion. He spoke
as follows: “ A foundation of religion had been commenced
amongst them, and from these beginnings he prayed God to be
propitious. A temple would arise, in which would be offered up
the great sacrifice, a temple in which they would assemble
to worship and glorify God and to learn lessons of love
to all mankind. When the children of Israel passed the
Jordan they collected, by command from on high, stones from
the bed of the river, which had miraculously opened a way
to their feet, and erected a monument of the event, to the end
that their children’s children might remember the protection
which God had given their fathers. So the monument commenced
77


this day would be a sign to those who came after them in future
generations that God had visited and protected His people amidst
their difficulties ; that in bringing them into a strange land He
had not forsaken them; He had redeemed them from captivity,
had blessed their flocks and herds ; wherefore then, not unmindful
of His goodness, they had raised this temple to His holy name. The
bishop then exhorted all according to their means to contribute
cheerfully and generously towards its erection, following the
example of the people of Israel, who brought their gold, their
silver and brass, when David invited them to build a house unto
God, and rejoiced because they offered their gifts with all their
hearts. The church was dedicated unto God, under the name of
St. Patrick the Apostle of Ireland, whose festival was this day
celebrated. This day would be remembered memorable amongst
them by the erection of a material temple. There was also a
spiritual temple, in which God loves to dwell; let the spiritual
temple be this day commenced by a renunciation of all excess and
a change of life. In conclusion the bishop, with the authority of
a father, and in the name of the glorious St. Patrick, entreated
his people as they reverenced the land of their forefathers and
rejoiced in its power, to show forth the power and purity of their
faith, in the propriety of their conduct: to shun all excess
and drunkenness, as most offensive to the Almighty, derogatory
to the memory of a saint, distinguished for his abstemiousness,
and degrading to the descendants of those whose holy lives obtained
for Ireland the title of the Island of Saints. When the illustrious
Daniel O’Connell called on the men of Clare to abstain, during the
period of the election, from intoxicating drink, they obeyed, and
their obedience was rewarded; their moral triumph was followed
by another which spread rejoicing through the world. The men of
Clare will be remembered with feelings of gratitude and respect; so
also will the people of Parramatta if they set this day an example
of temperance to present and succeeding generations, which shall
contribute to emancipate them from the power of evil habits ; by
many deemed invincible. In this hope the bishop entreated all to
retire early to their homes, blessing and praising God for that He
had vouchsafed to choose unto Himself a dwelling amongst them.”
The priests, at the commencement of the year 1836, were few
in number, but the bishop did not delay in striving to have the
number augmented. On the 6th May, 1836, he forwarded to His
Excellency, Sir Richard Bourke, an application for an increase to
the number of priests ; and I consider it would not be fair to the
reader if I did not quote this communication in extenso, as it gives
a particular account of the condition of the catholics at the time
in New South Wales.


The application was made in the following terms: “ Sir, —In
forwarding to the Colonial Office the estimate of the probable
expenses of the department of the Roman Catholic Church and
School Establishment for the year 1837, and also the supple-
mentary to the estimate for the year 1836, I have the honor
respectfully to submit to the consideration of your Excellency,
and of the Honorable the Legislative Council, the justice and
expediency of augmenting the present number of Roman catholic
chaplains in this colony and penal settlement. Before I state the
reasons on which I ground this application, your Excellency will
permit me to trace the measures that have been adopted within
the last three years to provide the catholic population of New
South Wales with religious instruction. In the year 1833, on
two chaplains, with the presiding clergymen Father Therry,
Father McEncroe, and Dr. Ullathorne, devolved the duty
of imparting religious instruction and of administering to the
spiritual wants of one-third of the entire population of the colony,
diffused throughout every part of this extensive territory. By
so small a number of clergymen, not more than sufficient for
Sydney alone, little could be done, except to keep from entire
decay so much of the spirit and form of religion as had been
preserved by the zealous labours of their predecessors, to run
hastily from place to place, perhaps at great distances, to supply
the most pressing wants of their flocks—to administer the rites
of religion to the child, and to those in danger of death. In such
a state of things even the individual efforts of a clergyman
must of necessity have been limited in their application and
weakened in their power, the greater portion of his time being
consumed, and his energies exhausted, in the act of passing from
locality to locality. The efficiency of clerical labour is intimately
connected with the continued residence of the clergyman amongst
his people; thus only can the pastor know the habits of the
individuals of his flock ; have frequent communication with them,
become enabled to adapt his instructions, public and private, to
their respective dispositions and circumstances. In the course of
the same year the urgent petition of the catholic community for
religious assistance was taken into consideration, and provision
was kindly made by your Excellency and the Honourable Legis-
lative Council, for four additional chaplains. Towards the latter
part of last year, the bishop arrived with three chaplains, and
the result of the combined labours of the catholic clergy thus
augmented in numbers tends to show, in the effect, the
absolute necessity of a resident, in order to secure an efficient,
clergy.
79


“During the last seven months, two clergymen and the Bishop
have devoted their labors permanently to the inhabitants of
Sydney and its various establishments. The result has shown
itself as well amongst the prison population as amongst the free,
in the inmates of the gaol, prisoners’ barracks, the hulks, and
amongst the inhabitants of the town, by a marked and
acknowledged improvement of morals, and in the ease of a, by
no means, inconsiderable number of persons hitherto regardless of
religious duty, by a total reformation of conduct; and your
Excellency will participate in the pleasure with which I state
that this moral improvement amongst our people is, under the
Divine blessing, still steadily progressing.
“ Since the month of October last, each Sunday ecclesias-
tical Students have read prayers, and instructions selected by the
Bishop, to the prisoners in Carter’s barracks, at the treadmill, in
the gaol, and recently to those employed at the new gaol.
“ Sydney being thus provided, there remain only four
chaplains for the whole of the interior of the colony and the
remote penal settlements. Duty is performed at Parramatta by
the Vicar-General, Dr. Ullathorne, but in consequence of our
limited numbers, he is liable to be required to attend other and
distant settlements. Clerical attendance is also provided for
Liverpool, a position important on account of the hospital. A
chaplain is also established at Windsor, but as the field of his labors
extends from Penrith and its vicinity down to the mouth of the
Hawkesbury, a distance of more than sixty miles, over a populous
country, he cannot be considered as resident ; each part of this
extensive district can only be occasionally attended to; still a
manifest improvement has taken place at Windsor, and in its
vicinity. The same may be said of Maitland. The chaplain
stationed at Maitland has to extend the sphere of his duties to
Newcastle, across the Hunter, up the whole of the Williams
River, and over Patterson’s Plains on the one side and on the
other to the distant districts of the Upper Hunter, the Patrick’s,
and the Liverpool Plains. The population of the township of
Maitland alone, of which a great portion is catholic, according to
a census taken by a police magistrate in the commencement of the
last year, amounted at that time to 2,000 souls; since it has been
considerably increased. And there still remains Campbelltown
and Appin, the Cowpastures, and the district of Illawarra, divided
from the rest of the colony by its precipitous range of mountains,
chiefly catholic, the vast district of Argyle, Bathurst, with all the
settled country beyond the Blue Mountains, all the penal settle-
ments unprovided with Roman catholic chaplains.
80


“ According to the census of the colony taken in 1833, the
catholic population amounted to 17,200; since that period
3,600 have been added to the number by transportation, besides
the increase by births and by immigration. Of the free female
immigrants, about 550 are catholics.
“ In the view of this statement, I beg most respectfully to
express my confidence, that your Excellency will not fail to
perceive the justice and expediency of augmenting, for the
catholic population of this colony and penal settlement, the
number of chaplains.
“ Firstly.—lnasmuch as a clergy not permanently resident,
but moving from place to place, cannot be adequately efficient;
passing visits leave only passing impressions.
“ Secondly—Without an increase in the number of our
clergy a considerable portion of the colony must still remain
almost entirely destitute.
“ Thirdly.—The numerous prison population have no means
of procuring religious assistance and instruction, except through
the provision of the Government. The duty of making such
provision for persons so circumstanced is evident; without it,
one of the great ends proposed to be gained by the system of
transportation, viz. the reformation of the criminal, must be left,
to a great extent, without the means of accomplishing it.
“ Fourthly.—An increase of the number of clergy is most
desirable for the sake of the free persons who arrive in the colony
for the purpose of settling in the interior, whose emigration to
this country is encouraged by Government, in order, amongst
other motives, to raise the morals of the people deprived of the
rites and consolations of their religion themselves, and their
O 7
children deprived of all pastoral care and guidance, a bereavement
and disappointment more afflicting to them than any other that
may be named; they are in imminent danger of falling into the
vices which they find prevailing around them, and thus most
lamentably frustrating the praiseworthy object proposed on their
immigration.
“ Fifthly.—A greater number of clergy is required for the
sake of the rising generation; these, in the absence of nearer
guardians, have a claim to the protection of Government; without
the aid of their clergy they must in very many instances grow
up neglected, ignorant of their moral duties, and formed to
criminal ways, guided by the depraved example of their neglected
parents.
G
81


“ Sixthly.—l have great reason to confide that the labours of
a resident clergy amongst the catholic population will be
followed by a considerable diminution of public crime, and
consequently by a proportionate diminution in the expense of
convicting and punishing crime. Out of the number of public
criminals of the catholic religion executed during the last
four years, it has been remarked not one has seen a clergyman
so as to receive the rites of his church in this country,
until after he was apprehended and lodged in jail; the remark
may be extended to the 450 catholics of Norfolk Island;
scarcely any amongst them are to be found who had attended
even once to their religious duties, from the period of their
transportation to the period of their re-conviction, and all, with
an uniformity which cannot be deemed the chance of coincidence,
attributed their career of guilt principally to the absence of
clerical care, guidance, and support.
“ On these grounds it is most respectfully submitted to your
Excellency that six additional catholic chaplains are required to
render the catholic a permanently resident and efficient clergy,
besides the one to be stationed at Norfolk Island. Of this num-
ber I propose one to be stationed in a central part of the county
of Camden, one in the Illawarra, one in Argyle, one at Bathurst,
one additional chaplain in the district of Windsor and of the
Hawkesbury, and an additional one in the district of the Hunter, to
be stationed at Newcastle or Patrick’s Plains. Even after this
arrangement the settlements of Port Macquarie and of Moretonßay
can only receive occasionally spiritual assistance from Sydney.
“ Having, as I hope, shown most satisfactorily the urgency of
the case, and that this further addition to the number of catholic
chaplains is not greater than is demanded by the pressing wants
of the colony, my confidence in the successful result of this
application is the more firm, being supported by the late Right
Honorable Secretary of State for the colonies, Lord Stanley, as to
the dispositions of your Excellency, and of the Honorable the
Legislative Council. Lord Stanley states it to be his opinion ‘ that
an addition of four chaplains was not more than was required by
the urgency of the case.’ A letter, dated 22nd January, 1834, to
Edward Blount, Esq., a copy' of which was transmitted from
Howning-street to the Right Rev. Bishop Bramston, by the
direction of Lord Stanley, and now in my hands, contains a similar
sentiment. Having stated the opinion above quoted, his Lordship
continues—‘ and should the demand increase, lam satisfied that
the Legislative Council of New South Wales will be happy to make


such further provision as may be in their power, consistently with
the other claims upon the revenue, which it may be necessary for
them to take into consideration.’
With great respect,
I have the honor to be,
Sir,
Your most obedient humble Servant,
J. B. POLDING.”
The following excellent letters of Bishop Bolding arose out
of a discussion about Lord Stanley’s system of education, which
Governor Bourke wished to establish in the colony. Bishop
Bolding was favorable to its introduction, on the principle that
half a loaf is better than no bread ; and to give it a trial. The
protestant bishop (Broughton) was opposed to the general system
of education, because he thought it would be too much in favor
of the cathplics and obstruct his favorite scheme, which was to
compel, or bring about, that all the children, whether catholic or
dissenting, be taught the doctrine and catechism of the Church of
England ;
(To the Editor of the Australian.
Sib, —A speech delivered by the Brotestant Bishop of
Australia at a meeting held on the 3rd August, at the Bulteney
Hotel, has at length fallen into my hands. Of its existence in
print I had heard; some portions of it in the public papers I
observed, but to obtain it had been hitherto almost as hopeless an
endeavour as to catch the gleams of light with which the marshes
of Botany Bay sometimes favor us.
Its object, I perceive, is to discountenance the system of
education it has been proposed to introduce into the colony.
Thus it may be considered as a continuance of the series of
petitions, resolutions, and protests which have emanated from the
Bulteney of late, tending to the same purpose. This address,
therefore, may be possibly the finale of the exhibition. Rocket-
like, it scorns the base things of earth and takes its flight into the
regions of theological disquisitions, displaying in the grand burst
plainly and legibly the object of its author, and then, as best
beseems the nature of all earthly things, descending into the
covert of darkness and of silence.
That Dr. Broughton has a right, particularly in the situation
he holds, to canvass a system of education, no one will deny ; each
83


one will deem that he is employed in his proper function in can-
vassing such system if he have doubt respecting its utility and
propriety. But neither eminence of station nor zeal for the cause
we conscientiously embrace will justify glaringly incorrect and
palpable misstatements. The former, in the person of Pilate,
condemned the innocent Jesus ; the latter, in the person of Paul,
persecuted the church of God. On the ignobly intended shield of
ignorance must be received the charge, which also will strike
moral integrity to the heart. I regret deeply to find in the
address now before me statements on subjects the most import-
ant equally incorrect with those which had been so gravely
numbered amongst the resolutions and solemn declarations of the
Pulteney. Amongst the latter I read, for instance, that “to prize
the Bible is to forfeit the favor of the government.” How im-
pressively the alteration helps on the phrase ! And again, that the
population includes 16,000 catholics and about 1600 children, in
the face of the census of 1833, which even at that time gave a
return of seventeen thousand two hundred catholics, taken as it
was, so carelessly that not one catholic is reckoned in upwards of
nine hundred colonial seamen. As regards the number of
catholic children, upwards of sixteen hundred have been baptized
within the last four years. But these extravagant assertions of
the Pulteney have been so regularly manufactured for the nonce
that the grave formality of discussion respecting their truth
would chase away the smile which they are good-naturedly
intended to elicit to dissipate the tedium of continued lamentation.
To the statements in the address I shall proceed presently.
As regards the system of education and its fitness for this colony
permit me to say a word en passant. I cannot condemn, on the
strength of the evidence now in my possession, a system which
has received the sanction of such eminent divines and scholars as
those confessedly are who compose the Board of Education in
Ireland. I have every reason to believe the empire contains no
individuals more attached to their country, more solicitous to
promote its welfare, more capable of devising means for that pur-
pose, or of carrying those measures into effect. It is truly
delightful to see such men leaving the areopagus of controversial
recrimination, sitting down together in the temple of concord to
receive from the lips of heaven born charity, lessons informing
them how their fellow creatures may be taught to preserve their
faith and yet dwell in mutual love. In this matter I would not
surrender my private judgment, yet who would not pay a rever-
ential deference to the names of Murray, Whately, and Carlisle ?
As regards its fitness for the colony ; no evidence of its unfitness


has yet been adduced; the trial is to he made. And after the
success the system has met with in Ireland, it deserves a trial.
There it has smoothed down animosities, it has encouraged the
spread of education, it has introduced a nobler range of feeling
than heretofore degraded the national character under the influ-
ence of Charter House and Kildare-street Schools. What radical
distinction exists between the inhabitants of Australia and their
• Antipodes to prevent those blessings being produced by the
system here, though one-third be catholics, and two-thirds of the
population be of all shades of religious belief, from the scarcely visible
tinge of enthusiasm to the lamentably broad expanse of entire in-
difference, is an enquiry I could wish to hear satisfactorily answered
by the author of the Pulteney address. I can readily conceive
that the conversation on religious subjects, which will take place
sometimes, even amongst boys, will clear away many of the
prejudices which were heretofore deemed sacred, that it will not be
easy to poison the friendships that have been formed at school by
the insinuation of deadly enmity; each catholic will not be deemed
an inquisitorial torturer at heart. He who has never been known
even in the thoughtlessness of youth to swerve from his word will
not readily be deemed a purjurer on principle; and he who has
uniformly shewn himself possessed of common sense, will be
permitted to believe in transubstantiation without being insulted
by the odious epithet of idolater. I acknowledge the consequence
will be awful to some parties, there will be bewailing amongst
dealers in anti-popery tracts. The fifth of November will loose
its flaming honors; and many a preacher, with the candid
Mr. Grinfield, will deplore that each cottage no longer makes
Fox’s Book of Martyrs its chief treasure; and may conclude
his argument on the utility of such noble publications with the
pathetic avowal of that reverend gentleman ; “my brethren let
Sophists disclaim as they may, man is too little a creature to be
stripped of his prejudices.”
As a catholic I am vastly amused with the contrariety of
opinion expressed with regard to this system. The Pulteney
oracles declare the system will be the means of establishing the
catholic religion. A writer in the “Australasian” is quite as
positive it will destroy the catholic religion. The sagacious
editor of the “ Monitor ” rejoices that at length the book of
Revelation will give an interlinear translation to the book of
Nature, and we shall thus be enabled infallibly to resolve the
mysteries of faith into the dicta of reason. Creeds, commentaries,
and councils—priests and parsons —all books, save the Bible, will
be forced into a pyramid from the top of which, with the book of


Nature in one hand and the of book Revelation in the other, the
“ Monitor ” will instruct the world. But to be serious, religion,
which springs from man, essentially partakes of man’s infirmity,
like him it is destined to decay—it is the creature of circum-
stances—it is “of earth earthly.” The religion which has God
for its author cannot be destroyed by human devices. It
demands not to be exclusively bolstered up by external power,
it refuses not support when proffered, it quails not before the
terrors of persecution, it attributes not its flourishing to the
smiles of an earthly potentate. True religion enshrouds not
herself in prejudices, these she regards as habiliments degrading
to her beauty. As a catholic, whether the system be permanently
adopted or not, I have no fear of the result. Prohibit education—
even use physical means to prevent it—we will still exert our
efforts to educate our children, for, “ it is better to obey God than
man.” Open schools to us, unhampered and unfettered on the
fair principles of equality. We ask no more—and the form of
religion that perishes under the test ought to perish, for it has
within it the germ of mortality.
In my next letter I shall proceed to the proofs of my
assertions, in the fact of misrepresentation of the doctrine of the
catholic church, as defined by the council of Trent, respecting the
reading of the scripture's; secondly, in the fact of misrepresentation
respecting the Bull “ IJnigenitus ” (no wonder the Venerable
Marsden was deceived) ; thirdly, in the fact of misrepresentation
respecting the introduction of the Bible as a school book.
I have the honor to be,
Sir,
Your most obedient servant,
CATHOLICUS IPSE.
Tuesday, August 23, 1836.
Remarks of the Editor of the Australian. —The tenor of his
writing (Catholicus Ipse) must and will obtain, for his con-
tributions, a prominent attention in this interesting discussion.
The letter avows the ardent attachment of the writer to his own
form of religion, but at the same time evinces how compatible
that attachment is with an enlarged and enlightened spirit of
Christianity.


De. Broughton’s Speech
(To the Editor of the Australian).
Sir, —It has been for many years a subject of regret to me,
that they who have stated, or take occasion to state, matters of
catholic faith or doctrine as distinguished from their own protestant
opinions, do not bring to the task that caution and discrimination
demanded by the importance of religious inquiry. This observation
extends to practical subjects of most serious import. By in-
dividuals moving in the first circles of society, the catholic
religion is, in a solemn appeal to the Deity, declared to profess
articles superstitious and idolatrous. This is declared by persons
who have never examined wdiether these things be so or not, and
who, in the ordinary course of life, maintain that a conviction of
the truth of the thing sworn to is necessary to relieve the con-
science of him who swears from the horrible guilt of perjury.—
*'Vse tibi flumen moris humani! Quis resistit tibi ? Quamdiu non
siccaberis ? Quousque volves Evse filios in mare magnum, et
formidolosran ? ” The language of the penitent Augustine thus
expresses how custom lends its deluding influence to self-deception;
and oh ! how fatally. Our books are now to be met with, and
even if they were not, we are ready to give an account of the
faith that is in us, and application might be made to ascertain
whether the tenets imputed to us, but generally disclaimed, do, or
do not belong to catholic faith. How many prejudices would be
cleared away, how narrow would become the isthmus of separation
between the catholic church and numberless well-meaning people
who are now floating about in search of truth, and weary for want
of a standing place to their feet! Were no doctrines ascribed
and believed to belong to the catholic church, except such as she
herself has declared to be articles of her faith, only that imperish-
able barrier would remain which the hand of the Almighty hath
established to preserve pure and undefiled, from the turbulent
ocean of human fallacies, the waters of salvation which have been,
are, and will be to the end of time, poured over the earth from the
fountain seated in Himself, and reflecting upon the surface, and in
their depths, the beauty and purity of His own unchangeable
existence. These thoughts have been brought to my mind by the
perusal of a passage in Bishop Broughton’s address, which I shall
presently quote ; first observing how in gentleness is administered
a castigation to certain individuals, who had, through the medium
of the press, used words of scoffing and reviling towards the


catholic church. We are so accustomed to language of this sort,
that we had not noticed it as deserving of particular reproof ; nor
indeed am I now sensible that it was merited. The game is started,
the animals in pursuit give notice that they are in full chase—and
they are chided for the natural development of their instinctive
propensities. This is not as it ought to be. It grieves us to see
them thus inopportunely surprised by a check. If the reality of
catholic doctrine be such as Dr. Broughton exhibits, in their
language and in that exhibition I can assuredly trace the con-
nection between cause and effect.
I proceed to prove the first assertion contained in my last
letter. The fact of misrepresentation of the doctrine of the
catholic church as established by the Council of Trent respecting
the use of the Scriptures. Preparatory, I will place before you
the words of Dr. Broughton relating to the subject. “ The rule of
the Roman catholic church as to the use of the Scriptures we
know is diametrically opposed to ours. It is this:—Forasmuch
as it is manifest from experience, that if the Holy Bible, trans-
lated into the vulgar tongue, be indiscriminately allowed to
everyone, the temerity of men will cause more evil than good to
arise from it; it is on this point referred to the judgment of the
bishops or inquisitors, who may, by the advice of the priest or
confessor, permit the reading of the Bible translated into the
vulgar tongue by catholic authors to those persons whose faith
and piety they apprehend will be augmented and not injured by
it; and this permission they must have in writing. But if anjr-
one will have the presumption to read or judge the Scriptures
without such written permission, he shall not receive absolution
(fourth rule of the index of prohibited books; by order of the
council of Trent). It is needless to perplex ourselves with a dis-
cussion, whether this rule be a matter of doctrine or of discipline,
w’hich distinction is sometimes dwelt upon. It is the acknow-
ledged rule of that church sanctioned by its declared authority.”
Dr. Broughton asserts first, that the rule of the Roman
catholic church, as to the use of the scriptures, is diametrically
opposite to the protestant rule, and that we know it; secondly,
that this Roman catholic rule is contained in the fourth rule of
the index, by order of the Council of Trent; thirdly, that it is
immaterial whether this rule be a matter of doctrine or of
discipline ; fourthly, that it is the acknowledged rule sanctioned
by its declared authority.
To try the correctness of the first proposition, we will place
the protestant principle and the rule quoted as the catholic by
Dr. Broughton in juxta position.


Quoted by Dr. Broughton as
THE CATHOLIC RULE.
Eor as much as it is manifest
from experience, that if the Holy
Bible translated into the vulgar
tongue be indiscriminately al-
lowed to everyone, the temerity
of men will cause more evil than
good to arise from it; it is on
this point referred to the judg-
ment of thebishopsor inquisitors
who may, by the advice of the
priest or the confessor, permit
the reading, &c., &c.
Protestant.
Holy Scripture contains all
things necessary to Salvation,
and that the use of it should be
put to every man who has a
soul to be saved.
The parts, says Hooker, of every true (diametrical corresponds
with that quality) opposition do always concern the same subject,
and have reference to the same thing (with all due submission to
Dr. Broughton’s judgment, according to this definition the elements
of opposition are wanting). Thus one proposition affirms and
another denies. Applying this definition to the passages
before us—what opposition exists between the proposition; the
Scripture contains all things necessary to salvation, and the
observation made in the quotation opposed that if the Holy Bible
be indiscriminately allowed to every one, more evil than good will
arise, does the one deny what the other affirms ? Evidently not.
But perhaps the diametrical opposition is to be found between the
second principle and the unhappy fourth rule of the index. Let
us try. The one asserts the free use of the Scriptures, the other
requires a certain permission to be obtained to prevent abuse and
injury to the unexperienced. But precaution is not prohibition.
Am I debarred the free use of the Port of Sydney and its
advantages, because to prevent destruction to the individual and
loss to the public, a wise government requires me to take a pilot
on board and to conform to regulations most easy to be complied
with ?
That the propositions are not adequate in terms, I readily
grant; that they contradict each other, or are contrary to each
other, las readily deny it. To take up the metaphorical language
of Dr. Broughton, though they do not exactly fall upon the same
space or coincide, yet they are not diametrically opposite.
Between two points on the circumference, diametrically opposite
is an extent indefinitely devisable, what part of it and by
consequence what position is occupied by the rule of the index


relatively to the protestant rule, is. a problem which might be
worked out, were the result when obtained worth the time and
trouble of obtaining it.
But it is unnecessary to dwell any longer on this subject, for
the regulation adduced by Dr. Broughton is neither an article of
catholic doctrine nor of catholic discipline, respecting the perusal of
the Scriptures nor published by order of the Council of Trent.
Indeed, whilst this quotation was under the pen, I suspect
some sort of uncertainty disturbed the writer’s course of thought.
It is needless to enquire, observed Dr. Broughton, no, that is not the
word to perplex ourselves with the discussion, whether this rule
be a matter of doctrine or discipline. Quite as needless as to
perplex ourselves whether the number of catholics in this colony
be sixteen or six and twenty thousand ; quite as needless as to
enquire whether or not the forfeiture of government favour has
been actually the consequence of prizing the Bible.
“ Sic volo sic jubeo slat pro rations voluntas.”
Why perplex ourselves ? As regards the present subject, not
the least reason imaginable ; to be perplexed, intimates to have
the presence of troublesome doubt, and troublesome doubt is very
inconvenient, but indeed there can be none. For what is matter
of catholic doctrine ? “ All that and that only is of catholic
doctrine which God has revealed and the church proposes to the
belief of all.” In an article of faith or doctrine therefore there
are two things required,—revelation from God, for faith, says St.
Paul, comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ; and
the second that it be taught by the church, either in a general
council by an express and definite decree, or practically
confirmed by the unanimous assent of the pastors of the church.
Till Dr. Broughton shall bring proof that the fourth rule of
the index has been in either way declared to be an article of
Faith, take, Sir, the assertion of Catholicus Ipse, that it is no
matter of catholic doctrine, propounding the rule of the Roman
catholic church as to the use of the Scriptures.
Secondly, neither is it a matter of catholic discipline in the
general sense of the word, for that law of discipline is not
obligatory, which neither proceeds from a general council, nor has
been promulgated to the church at large, and received by its
pastors. Now the regulations of the index, though received by
some countries, have never been enforced throughout the church,
nor received by its pastors at large as rules of general church
discipline, and wherever they have been adopted, it has been
because the local ecclesiastical authorities have deemed it
expedient as a matter of prudence and of temporary precaution


to do so. Thirdly, the rule in question is not by order of the
Council of Trent. It is often objected against us, says Veron, for
the sake of causing dissension and of rendering the catholic
religion more odious, that the Council of Trent forbids the
perusal of the Scriptures, in a vulgar tongue. This is a mere
calumny. There is not a word which can possibly be construed
in the decrees of the council, as even alluding to a prohibition of
using the sacred Scriptures in a vulgar tongue. As to the fourth
rule of the Roman index, which Dr Moulin and others falsely
ascribe to the Council of Trent, that council had nothing to do
with it. The fact is—and Dr. Broughton ought to be aware of
it, the council appointed certain individuals to consider what steps
had better to be taken to prevent the dissemination of books
dangerous to the faith and morals of the faithful. Amongst
these were corrupted and perverted translations of the Scripture.
The rules of the index were drawn up by these deputies, “hut
never received the sanction of the Council of Trent.” In fact the
council purposely abstained from giving its sanction to them.
Hence Dr. Marsh, the Bishop of Peterborough, observes ;—“ The
reading of the Scriptures, in an authorised version, is not
prohibited to the laity (even of the Roman catholic church) by
any decree or canon of the Council of Trent. And even the
impediments which from other quarters had been thrown in the
way of reading the Bible, such for instance as the requiring a
license for that purpose, have been gradually diminished if not
removed.” Comp, vide Chap. 6. Who is the faithful witness, Dr.
Broughton or Dr. Marsh ?
Dr. Broughton, the Protestant Bishop of Australia, asserts
that it is needless to enquire whether the rule of the Roman
catholic church respecting the use of the scriptures be a matter of
doctrine or of discipline. I am astonished that this assertion
should proceed from a theologian, who has before his mind a distinct
knowledge of the difference between an article of doctrine and an
article of discipline. Discipline considered in a general eccle-
siastical sense regulates the internal policy of the church, connected
indeed directly or indirectly with articles of faith or doctrine,
but mutable, adapted to times and circumstances. Matters of
doctrine are those truths which God has revealed, which all are
bound to believe, immutable, received at all times and in all places.
Do you not perceive, Sir, an immense difference which even
Dr. Broughton might have condescended to notice ? He might,
Sir. And instead of producing an unauthoritative regulation
respecting the perusal of the scripture, he might at once have gone
to the fountain head and drawn from the council itself the pure


catholic doctrine on this important subject. But as the writer of
the address observes, “ there is a meaning in these proceedings.”
Our doctrine is contained in the following decree of the fourth
session of the council and in truth published by its order. The
council—to curb the petulance of certain dispositions—defines,
that on questions of faith and morals appertaining to the edifi-
cation of Christian doctrine, no one relying on his own discretion
pervert the scriptures to his own meaning in opposition to that
sense which our Holy Mother the church, to whom it belongs to
judge of the true sense and interpretation of the scriptures, has
held and doth hold, or presume to give an interpretation of
the sacred text, contrary to the unanimous consent of
the fathers. This is a decree of the catholic church : in this we
avow our firm belief. To this we submit. Has she thereby
prohibited the reading of the scriptures ? So far from prohibiting
the perusal of the scriptures—the definition contained in this
decree of the council is grounded on the fact of perusal—since
abuse necessarily implies the power to use. It admonishes the
faithful, lest in such perusal they may be led astray by their own
fancies to destruction. No one is to presume to read them with
a view of deriving from them articles of faith at variance with
the doctrine “ once delivered to the saints ” and handed down by
the church, the attested witness of their truth, to our times,
either in the original languages or in copies authorised by her;
she exhorts her children to read the scriptures in the spirit of
humility and of piety, to apply to their own personal improvement
its precepts of wisdom, its examples of charity, its counsels of
perfection,—that thus they may become more conformable to our
Divine Model Jesus Christ, our most blessed Lord. But she warns
her children to repress the spirit of pride and presumption—not
to be wiser than it behoveth to be, not to be deluded, by the
wicked enemy whose advice is destruction, into conceited thoughts
and vain imaginings, to set up individual judgment in opposition
to the sense in which the books of God have been read by the
fathers of the first ages of the church, which sense is embodied in
the creed, liturgy, and prayers, which unite her children at all
times and all places as one, in accomplishment of the prayer of
Him who prayed that His people might be one, even as He and
the Father. Thus is it now, thus it has always been, with those
who are gone before, with those who are still in the mortal body,
age preceding age, as wave precedes wave, till we come into the
very source whence emanates the stream of eternal incorruptible
truth. In this spirit the venerable pontiff, Pius the YL, in 1778,
wrote to the Archbishop of Florence, to express his gratification


that at a time when a vast number of bad books were in circula-
tion, the faithful were ever exhorted by him to the reading of Holy
Scripture, and that they were enabled to read them more usefully
by his faithful translation of the sacred writings with judicious
notes. In a rescript addressed to the catholic bishops in England,
April 18th, 1820, Pius the YIII. earnestly exhorts them to confirm
the people committed to their care in piety and virtue, and for that
end to encourage them to read pious books, but especially the
Holy Scriptures, in translations approved by ecclesiastical
authority. The same venerable prelates in their declarations of
catholic tenets, published in the year 1829, state, “ that the
catholic church has never forbidden nor discouraged the reading
or circulation of authentic copies of the sacred scriptures in the
original languages ; as to translations into modern languages, the
catholic church requires that none shall be put into the hands of
the faithful but such as are acknowledged by ecclesiastical
authority to be accurate and conformable to the sense of the
original.” They observed, in fine, that there never was a general
law of the catholic church prohibiting the reading of authorised
translations of the scriptures. How correctly Dr. Broughton has
represented the catholic rule respecting the use of the scriptures
and its translation into the vernacular languages, is a conclusion
you, sir, will receive with more gratification than I may express.
And in reference to this subject permit me to record the astonish-
ment with which I have observed in page 22 of the address, that
Dr. Broughton pleads for favour of the Church of England, in the
eyes of those who dissent from her doctrine, on the ground that
the church for which he makes a stand, “ gave to them all the
word of God in their native language, yes, to you all.” Again,
“ you are, and must be, indebted to the Church of England for
ability to read the scriptures in that language.” If this statement
be correct, then history thou art splendide mendax. But possibly
Dr. B. may mean that the Church of England has provided the
dissenters with the physical means to read the scriptures. In this
sense let each one abide with his own experience, and answer to
the truth, I meddle not.
There was not, Sir, in Europe, a single civilized nation in
which versions of the Bible in the national language had not been
published before the Church of England, as at present constituted,
was established by law. As to England, there were many Anglo-
Saxon versions of different parts both of the Old and New Testa-
ment. “ The whole Bible,” says Sir Thomas Moore, Dialog. Lib.
3, c. 14, speaking of catholic times, “ was by virtuous and learned
men translated into the English tongue, and by good and godly


people with devotion and soberness well and reverently read.”
Mr. C. Butler, who has written his reply on this subject states,
that he numbered in one bookseller’s list alone, twenty-two
different editions of the whole Bible or New Testament which had
been published by the English catholics since the period of the
Reformation. Sed Eheu ! satis. For the sake of peace and of
those well-meaning persons to whom I have before alluded, I
rejoice that in her theory, at least, the doctrine of the Church of
England respecting the free use of the scriptures, more closely
approximates that of the catholic church as before detailed, than
is stated by Dr. Broughton, and this I propose to discuss and
demonstrate in my next letter.
I have the honor to be, Sir, &c., &c.,
CATHOLICUS IPSE.
To the Editor of the Australian.
Sir, — Having shown in my last that Dr. Broughton had not
given a correct statement of the doctrine of the Council of Trent,
respecting the use of the scriptures, I shall now proceed to
demonstrate that the doctrine of the Church of England on this
subject approximates more closely to the doctrine of the Roman
Catholic Church than might be supposed from the statement of
the Protestant Bishop of Australia.
In the first struggles for change, civil or religious, the cry of
liberty is raised loudly, and the abstract individual rights of man
are asserted strongly. There is an object to be gained. Flatter
the pride of man and he instantly becomes the instrument of his
own subjugation. When that change has been brought about, and
the transfer of power has been accomplished, a return to those
principles of subordination and of restriction, the experience of
ages has proved to be essential to the well being of society, is
made invariably. Thus at the period of the boasted reformation,
authority in matters of faith denounced as intolerable des-
potism—the pages of the Bible were refused to those who could
read and those who could not —the pride of the learned and the
unlearned alike, welcomed the assurance that faith was to be the
result of each one’s interpretation of the word of God. The right
of private judgment was the powerful lever used to wrest
asunder the bond of catholic unity—and the alarming effects were
soon visible. A monster, it was perceived, had been created that
strode the land, east and west —anarchy rejoicing in its footsteps.
They whom it had enthroned in the high places beheld


the spread of ruin with dismay. They trembled for their
own safety —parricide in itself became a virtue and protestants
strove to annihilate the parent of protestantism. “ The free use of
the scriptures is each one’s birth right.” Thus exclaimed Luther,
as he headed revolt against the church of God, and by the way of
commentary he insisted upon his catechism being adopted, and
denounced Zuinglius as an abettor of diabolical opinions, from
presuming to use the scriptures in a sense different to his own
exposition. Thus exclaimed Calvin too; but when he became
supreme in Geneva, Servetus and others had to choose between
the faggot and Calvin’s interpretation of the scripture.
Thus also repeated our eighth Henry, having placed the
tiara on his crown he sent forth his knightly pontifical degree,
that his subjects should not presume to expound or take argu-
ments from the scripture —Burnet lib. 3. —and indeed he had
before given them to understand, that “ whereas there were some
teachers whose office it was to instruct the people, so the rest
ought to be taught, and to those it was not necessary to read the
scriptures, and that therefore he had restrained it from a great
many, esteeming it sufficient for such to hear the doctrine of the
scriptures taught by their preachers.”
The same ambitious spirit which went forth at the com-
mencement of the reformation has been abroad in this colony—
accommodated however to circumstances. Now there is an
object not to be gained, but to be retained within exclusive
dominion. The church, heretofore dominant, has fallen from her
lofty bearing; or rather a just and prudent hand, by placing all
denominations of the Christian religion on a level, —has filled
up the iniquitous chasms which belted her as something
sovereignly to be distinguished—into which she would have fallen.
Let them stand or crumble away according to their deserving
before God and man. No church founded in truth can perish
under this fair state of things. No system of education which
leaves the mind unbiassed and the communication between the
pastors and pupil free and uncontrolled, can offer detriment for
her well being. Yet the senseless cry of “the church is in danger,”
has been raised. I protest, I could not —could not remain a
member of any church that required seclusion for the wholesome
expansion of her tenets, or that could be endangered by any cause,
save the physical destruction of its members. Can man destroy
the work of God ? The question approaches blasphemy; all,
however are not of my opinion. Has the attempt failed to obtain
favourable suffrages for the Church of England—or rather for
that system of education which has swallowed annually so many


thousands of public money, under the administration of the
Church of England ? and, alas! like the lean Kine of Pharoah,
without becoming proportionately beautiful and well conditioned.
Hence the supplications and petitions—hence the vulgar denun-
ciations of the system, and the witless sarcasms, as if any thing
good could come from Ireland; hence the prejudices excited on
the score of religion, fostered and cherished—and furnished with
a place to rest upon in the solemn warning of the bishop of
Australia —that the fundamental principle of protestantism is
about to be destroyed, and the fear of the foolish, and dreams
of the ignorant have ample scope and verge enough in the
appalling contrast between the free use of the Bible allowed the
protestant —denied the catholic—a contrast founded, as we have
seen, on grievous mis-representation. And why all this ? There
is a chance of detaining influence and at a venture it is grasped
at; why this? Not that the fundamental principle of protestantism
is in greater danger than it has been since the Church of England
form of worship ruled dominant in the colony—as we shall
presently see; but because, under the new system of education,
truth and charity will occupy the ground hitherto cumbered by
prejudice and sectarian exclusiveness. And this is becoming mani-
fest to those who in their simplicity surrendered their judgment
to the outcry. That outcry summoned all under the protestant
name to the defence of their principles. “ The free use of the
Bible is endangered—it is to be taken away,” exclaims Bishop
Broughton, and the according response, so loud and general at
first, has now died away to a lady’s whisper.
But when I hear from the lips of Dr. Broughton, “ that the
free use of the scripture belongs to all who have souls to be
saved,” I do not forget he is chief dignitary of the Church of
England form of worship in this colony, suffragan to the
Archbishop of Canterbury, deriving ecclesiastical power from his
ordination in that church, and a sworn observer of the thirty-nine
articles of the Church of England. To whatever purpose, there-
fore, the Bishop of Australia uses the maxims above quoted, they
receive their modification from that form of the protestant
religion of wffiich he is the colonial head. Now I think it will
not be difficult to show, that the maxim which is so loudly pro-
claimed from the portals of the Church of England has been most
carefully excluded from her precincts.
As regards the burden of authority in reference to the free
use of the scriptures, which the great body of protestant
dissenters regards with equal disdain, whether imposed by the
hand of Canterbury or Home; the right to impose it is claimed


and exercised by the church of England with as much pertinacity
and imperiousness of dominion, as may be found in the canons of
the catholic church, which openly and honestly avows that right
to have been deposited with her especially and inalienably. In
proof, I shall not cite laws nor regulations, partial in extent and
inoperative —disowned to be the canons of the church of England;
we will appeal at once to the thirty-nine articles agreed upon by
the archbishop and the whole clergy in convocation assembled ;
and solemnly confirmed by the king.—Art. 20. “ The church has
power to decree rites or ceremonies, and authority in controversies
of faith; and yet it is not lawful for the church to ordain
anything that is contrary to God’s word written; neither may it
expound one place of scripture that is repugnant to another.
Wherefore though the church be a witness and keeper of Holy
writ, yet as it ought not to decree anything against the same,
so besides the same ought it not to enforce anything to
be believed for necessity of salvation.” * Here the church
claims not only the power of regulating the ceremonial of
religion—but also authority in determining controversies of faith,
of expounding scripture and enforcing points of necessary belief,
provided her decrees, her ordinances, and enforcements be
agreeable to Holy writ as expounded by herself; but so expounded
that no part be repugnant to another. Who is to judge of the
discrepancy or the accordance ? The appellant ? To what purpose
then the appeal ? The scripture ? This would be an appeal from
the tribunal de dernier ressort constituted to determine; from the
chancellor of the court to the equity he administers. The church
declares herself the arbiter of controversies and the interpreter
of scripture. Her judgment is set up and private judgment
disallowed; for the church claims a right of enforcing her
judgment, and if her judgment is to be enforced, what more is
left for private judgment on doctrinal points ? What becomes of
the free use of scripture ? If the individual understands the
scriptural passages different from the church, and desires a
different doctrine, he is called upon to suppress or renounce his
own opinion and submit to authority. If he should refuse, then
he is liable to be cast out of the society of faithful men, “as a
heathen and publican;” so the visible church of God is defined by
the nineteenth article, in the which it is declared the “ pure word
of God is preached and the sacraments duly administered.”
* On what grounds of scripture does the Church of England prove the
lawfulness or validity of infant baptism? the lawfulness of working on the
Saturday, the Jewish sabbath ; the abrogation of command to abstain from things
strangled and from blood.—Acts 15, v. 29.
H


And the church of England has not only claimed, but
exercised this authority in a manner the most ample. Read the
thirty-nine articles; has she not declared her judgment upon, and
interpreted the word of God on subjects of, mysteries, of
sacraments, of truths, practical, and speculative ? Has she not
made a terrible inroad on private judgment, by proclaiming on
her own authority the exact number of inspired books ?
Farewell, original sin, justification and predestination; all are
determined by her in a manner intended to be most precise,
whatever may be our opinion of their theological accuracy. In a
word she gives a summary of Christian belief, grounded on her
own exposition of scripture. This is authoritatively required to
be adopted, because it is either read in scriptures or may be
proved by it. Who declares this ? The Church of England.
Thus the interpretation of the Bible by private judgment is
completely interdicted on every vital point of religious belief.
Nor let it be supposed, sir, that these articles bind only
the clergy and not the laity. Read the declaration prefixed to
the thirty-nine articles; the preamble states that the object of
the articles is to preserve the church in the unity of religion, not
to suffer unnecessary disputations, altercations, or questions to
he raised. The declaration itself has these decisive words:
“We require all our loving subjects to continue the uniform
profession thereof, and prohibit the least difference in the said
articles.”
And let it be further observed, that the entrammelling effects
of the church of England’s authority not only restricted the free
use of the bible, but the free use of the limbs also. In 1551 it
was enacted, “ that all should resort where the book of common
prayer was used under pain of church censure. If he be present
under any other form of prayer he shall suffer imprisonment for
life.” In 1558 it was enacted, “that any minister refusing to
use the book of common prayer, or using any other rites or
ceremonies, but what are set down in the said book, shall forfeit
his benefice or be imprisoned for twelve months; on third
conviction be imprisoned for life.” I mention these enactments
in no invidious sectarian spirit, nor to revive the remembrance of
times and grievances I could wish to be obliterated from history,
but to show that the authority, which as Supreme Governor of
the church, ratified and confirmed the thirty-nine articles of
the church of England, did in good earnest intend all liege sub-
jects to abide by them. I think, Sir, it is sufficiently evident,
that the church which Dr. Broughton acknowledges to be his
mother, has appointed herself the judge of the true sense and
98


interpretation of the scripture—that she has exercised that right
and fenced about her prerogative with statutes cogent enough to
obtain respect to its exercise, if not conviction to its consistency,
with the boasted principle of the reformation. Now we will see
what rule she has appointed, in order that her ministry may be
directed to give the right interpretation of God’s word to the
people. I observe the rule was made and given to the clergy in
the year 1571 by the convocation, the same year in which the
thirty-nine articles, drawn up in the year 1562, were revised by
convocation and confirmed by Act of Parliament. —-Canon de
concion : “ Let them take care that they never teach anything
which they would have the people to hold and believe, but what
is agreeable to the old and new testament and which the catholic
fathers and ancient bishops had collected from that very doctrine.”
It then declares such doctrine to be contained in the articles on
Liturgy, and then concludes, “ whoever shall be otherwise and
disturb the people by contrary doctrines shall be excommunicated.”
“ By this rule,” says Dr, Brett on tradition, “ I take it that all
preachers are obliged to interpret the scriptures, not according to
their own fancies, but according to the consentient tradition of
the primitive and catholic fathers of the first ages of the Christian
church.” Now sir, let me ask, where is the diametrical opposition
Dr. Broughton good-naturedly informed us, was known to exist
between the protestant and catholic rules in the free use of the
scriptures ? Alas ! with the benefit of the information given, we
are not much wiser on the subject. What becomes of the free
use of the scriptures according to the protestantism of the church
of England ? Yerily, verily, Messieurs of dissent, I think it
behoves you to be quite as wary in steering your barque of bible-
use clear of the ecclesiastic institutions of comparatively modern
date, as you doubtlessly are to keep clear of the ancient rock of
Peter’s orthodoxy. The former are most certainly quite as fatal
to its existence as the latter.
In the commencement of this examination into the difference
between the catholic and protestant rules respecting the use of
the scriptures, I placed in juxtaposition the two rules stated by
Dr. Broughton to be diametrically opposite. I am unable to
discover the elements of opposition. I will conclude this letter
by the juxtaposition of two rules respecting the free use of
scripture, which I humbly conceive not to be substantially
discordant —the one taken from the Council of Trent, the other
from the articles and canons of the church of England.

Catholic Rule respecting the use and interpretation of
the Bible.
Council of Trent, Sess. 4th.
The Council of Trent defines that on questions of faith and
morals, appertaining to the edification of Christian doctrine, no
one relying on his own discretion, perverting the scripture to his
own meaning, in opposition to that sense which our Holy Mother,
the Church, to whom it belongs to judge of the true sense and
interpretation of the scriptures, has held and doth hold, shall
presume to give an interpretation of the sacred text contrary to
the unanimous consent of the fathers.
Protestant Rule of the Church of England for the same.
The church hath power to decree rites, or ceremonies, and
authority in controversies of faith. Art. 20, D. Concion.,
1571, Canon 5. Let them take care that they (the clergy) never
teach anything which they would have the people to hold and
believe, but what is agreeable to the Old and New Testament, and
which the catholic fathers and ancient bishops had collected from
that very doctrine. Whoever shall do otherwise and disturb the
people by contrary doctrine shall be excommunicated.
Surely the laity are not allowed a wider latitude in the
exposition of the scripture than the clergy ?
Thus, it appears, the diametrical opposition between the
doctrine of the two churches, on the most important subject,
proves to be nearly a coincidence.
Would to God that all religious differences might thus
terminate.
I have the honor to be, Sir,
Your most obedient servant,
CATHOLICUS IPSE.

CORRESPONDENCE.
{To the Editor of the Australian.)
Sir, —A letter appeared in the columns of the Herald
animadverting on the lucubrations of “ Catholicus Ipse.” Its
natural tendency to sink beneath the surface has been arrested by
the friendly hand of the “ Colonist.” From this circumstance it
may be supposed to contain a statement of some importance, how
correctly _ the following observation will show :
I pass by the preliminary surmises respecting “ Catholicus
Ipse,” conceiving them to be of very little consequence, either to
him or to the public.
The object of the writer is introduced by a certain query and
wonderment it was not answered before. Why did not “ Catholicus
Ipse ” cite the observation of Leo XII. on the Bible Societies ?
For two obvious reasons: Ist.—The decree of the Council of
Trent, to which allusion is made, has been cited as the foundation
of the argument and the exposition of catholic belief: it was
unnecessary therefore to repeat it. 2nd.—Because the observations
of Leo XII. referred to the exceptions from the general rule
respecting the use of the scriptures, which rule was the subject of
discussion ; and therefore the observations were deemed irrelevant.
But since “ Colonist ” has opened this subject of the Bible Society,
and its translations into various languages,—and since the
quotation from Leo XII. has doubtless caused numbers of pious
ladies, of a certain age, to raise their eyes to heaven and ejaculate
many devout sayings respecting the said very irreverent observa-
tions, I will cite for their further edification the judgment on this
Society passed by other witnesses, perhaps more competent to give
evidence respecting the mischievous effects produced by it than
even Leo XII.: —“ Surely it is enough to make the Christian’s
blood run cold to think of the sacrilegious presumption of a society
which has thus dared to trample and trifle with the revelation
of the Almighty; and dares to publish to the heathen, and
attempts to foist upon its credulous supporters those schoolboy
exercises of its agents as the sacred word of God. It is the
circulation of such translations as these, that more than once at
the meetings of the society have been blasphemously compared to
the miraculous gifts of tongues. And such a system is supported
and such comparisons applauded by many who on other occasions
lay claims, and justly, to characters of piety and intelligence.”
Appendix to reasons why I am not a member of the Bible Society,
by the Hon. and Rev. Phil. Arth. Percival, chaplain in ordinary


to Her Majesty. Now for a sample of the doings of the Society.
The Welsh translation was so incorrect that no use could be
made of it. The Turkish, Dr. Henderson owns to he incapable
of defence. The modern Greek was written in such a strange
language that it could not he understood. In November, 1822, the
Irish Society passed the following condemnatory resolution on the
Irish translation of the British and Foreign Bible Society. “ Resolved,
that after a full enquiry, the members of this Society feel satisfied
that material and very numerous errors exist in the version of the
New Testament edited by the British and Foreign Bible Society.”
“With the exception,” say the quarterly reviewers, “of three or four
individuals, not one of those who have been employed, under the
auspices of the British and Foreign Bible Society, either in
translating or editing the scriptures, has received the benefit of a
regular and learned education; whence their existing versions
will be remembered hereafter only for the errors and blunders
which disfigure them. It has even,” they said, “ been openly and
repeatedly asserted, that amongst the foremost of the Society’s
continental supporters appear many individuals notorious for
entertaining heretical or infidel opinions, whence the persons in
question have succeeded in making serious innovations in the
received versions.” “ With truth, Sir,” Pope Leo observed, “ there
is just ground to fear, that in all the translations it will be
discovered, as it has been found in those already examined, that,
by bad translation, it has been found to be, instead of the Gospel
of Christ, the gospel of men —or rather that which is worse, the
gospel of devils.” Now in this apprehension, and in this censure,
the Sovereign Pontiff is in the company of the high church
gentlemen of the Quarterly Review, and of other most staunch
protestants. Of the eighty-nine new translations of the scripture
there is not so much as one even tolerably accurate. —“ Whence
their existing versions (of the Bible Society) will be remembered
hereafter only for the errors and blunders which disfigure them.”
And those are the writings, it is expected, the catholic church
will acknowledge to be the inspired word of God, and recommend
as such to the perusal of her children! Thus, Sir, in the language
of Dr. Doyle, “ the types sweat, the press teems, —vessels are
freighted for this Society. It drives an immense trade, profitable
no doubt to many, in Bibles and missionaries. Fortunes are made
for the printers and booksellers, secretaries, and functionaries, and
agents, and pawnbrokers : these be they to whom the Society is
indeed of profit. In the meanwhile has the Society converted a
single tribe or native to the faith ? No, not one —and what is
more, it is improbable they ever should.” Excuse the parenthe


tical observation. Now Sir, we will take a view of the translations
which had preceded the translations of the Bible Society. To
begin with that of Luther—the foremost man of the reformation—
he translated the scriptures. Let us have the testimony of his
brother reformer, Zuinglius, respecting this translation. He
stigmatizes him as a foul corrupter, and horrible falsifier of God’s
word —one who followed the Mareonites and Arians, —that he
erased all such places of the Holy Scripture which were against
him. In his New Testament alone not less than 1400 corruptions
of the text were noted by Staphylus and Emserus. Not
only did this man, who is said to have been deputed of God to
reform the world, thus reform God’s sacred word according to his
own fancy, but he falsified the text also. Impartial justice to
the entire exclusion of good works, is the fundamental principle
of Luther’s theology. Not only did he reject the epistle of St.
James, which destroys this most dangerous tenet, profanely
terming it a “ chaffy production unworthy of an apostle,” but to
have a direct proof from scripture he inserted the word alone in
the text of St. Paul in Romans iii, 28 :—We account a man to be
justified by faith alone, without the works of the law. Accused of
this presumptuous innovation on the inspired word, hear his
defence : —Sic volo, sic jubeo —so I will, so I command. “ Let
my will be instead of reason, Luther will have it so. The word
alone must remain in my testament. Although all the papists
should run mad, they shall not take it thence. It grieves me, I
did not also add those other two words, omnibus, and omnium,—
without all works of all laws.” Zuinglius gave also his trans-
lation of the New Testament. As Luther had introduced the
word alone into the Epistle of St. Paul —to justify his doctrine of
impartial justice, so Zuinglius inserted a word to meet his new
idea of the figurative presence in the Holy Sacrament. The words
St. Matt, xxiv, 26, —this is my body, hoc est corpus meum, —he
translated “ this signifies my body.” "Whereupon Luther returned
the civilities of Zuinglius by rejecting his translation, calling him
and his divines fools, asses, anti-christs, and deceivers. Calvin
of course had his translation; of its merits the learned Molinus
speaks thus, —“Calvin in his harmony makes the text of the
gospel to leap up and down. He uses violence to the letter of
the gospel and besides this adds to the text —in sua translat.
New Testament, Art. 12. And the translations of such men, for-
sooth, we are invited to receive as the inspired word of God !
So far for the foreign translations, We will now turn our atten-
tion to the translations into the English language.


I shall pass by that of Tyndal in the time of Henry YIII.—
in the new testament alone two thousand corruptions were
noted by Bishop Tunstal. Then we have Cranmer’s Bible in
1546 —the Geneva Bible of 1557 and 1560, and the Bible
emphatically called the Bishop’s Bible in 1572, and in many other
editions. Now this translation was approved and authorized by
the same powers, spiritual and secular, that gave authority to
the present authorized version of the Church of England, which
authority, it is insinuated, catholics ought to respect. In this
translation the word church is supplemented by the word
congregation —for idols, images are substituted—for traditions,
ordinances. I need not observe there was a meaning in these
proceedings. Lest, however, it may be supposed that the catholic
eye is prejudiced, we will receive the testimonies of protestant
authorities on the corrupt state of these translations. In an
abridgement presented by the ministers of the diocese of Lincoln
to King James, they denominate the English translation “ a
translation which taketh away from the text, that addeth to the
text, a translation which is absurd and senseless, perverting in
many places the meaning of the Holy Ghost.” Mr. Broughton in
his letter to the Lords of the Council stigmatizes the English
translation as “ full of errors.” And in his advertisement of
corruptions he plainly tells the bishops, “ that their public
translation of the scriptures into English is such that it perverts
the text of the old testament in eight hundred and forty-eight
places, and that it causes millions and millions to reject the new
testament and to run into eternal flames.” This Mr. Broughton, it
is remarked, was one of the more zealous sort of protestants.
King James, the royal divine, complained that he never saw a
Bible well translated into English —as for the Geneva Bible, he
pronounced that the worst of all. The character of these
English protestant translations is thus described by a modern
writer of eminence, DTsraeli. “ Our English Bibles were suffered
to be so corrupted that no books ever swarmed with such
innumerable errata. These errata were in great part voluntary
omissions, interpolated passages, reformed and forged for certain
purposes.”—Or as Dr. Broughton would say:—“There was a
meaning in these proceedings.” I think, sir, painful though it
may be, “Colonist” will acknowledge that Leo XII. had just cause
for the censure and caution expressed in the adduced extract.
Respecting the present authorized version of the Church of
England, I shall only observe that the authority which has
sanctioned it, sanctioned the translations on which the severe
censures I have quoted were passed—l will not draw the obvious


conclusion. When the translation of the scriptures by the rev.
missionaries to our aborigines is completed, we may perhaps be
called upon to receive it also as the inspired word of God,
together with the versions for the use of the Boothians and other
Esquimaux. In the meantime “ Colonist” may derive comfort from
the sentiments expressed by Dr. Norris in his letter to Lord
Liverpool.—“We conscientiously believe the Bible Society to be
fraught with danger not only to our own church, but to the best
interests of Christian truth and unity throughout the world.” “ The
current of public opinion,” says Rev. Mr Callaghan, “has already set
in against the established church; and the Bible Society, whether
the prelates will see it or not, is unquestionably converted into an
engine for its destruction.” Bishop Marsh expresses a similar
opinion—see inquiry p. 61. “ The Socinians,” observes the British
critic, “ are so convinced that the tendency of the Bible Society is
hostile to the church, that they are unwilling, even though it
circulates the authorized version of the scripture, to give their
support.”
Thus, sir, by protestant authorities are proved and
confirmed the observations of Pope Leo XII., respecting the
tendency of the Bible Society and its false and corrupt and
school-boy translations. His past and emphatic denunciations of
scriptures perverted to deceive and destroy, are founded on good
sense and experience. The Bible delivered to her children by the
church of God, and accredited by her authority to be the inspired
volume of the divine revelation, ought to be received with
veneration, read with reverence and humility not to be expressed;
and deposited, when not in use, in an ark of cedar lined with gold.
That which men or any set of men, not having authority from
God, or not authorized by those having authority from Him,
have sent, can only be received as the word of man. That trans-
lation which has knowingly perverted the sense of the original,
and is sent forth to the world as the word of God, whereas it is
man’s own word corrupted to their own purposes, merits con-
tempt as a vile imposture and is treated with too much honor
when conveyed with a pair of tongs into a hole made for its
reception, after the manner of the poor peasant mentioned by
J. K. L., on whose devoted head the pious and gentle of the Bible
Society have poured out so frequently their indignation.
I have the honor to be,
Sir,
Your most obedient servant,
CATHOLICUS IPSE.


PART II.
CHAPTER I.
A great Protestant Meeting, held in the Pulteney Hotel, Sydney,
in the year 1836, in favour of the Denominational System of
Education.—An Account of the Foundation of Melbourne,
by Governor Bourke, in the year 1837.—The resignation of
Sir Richard Bourke , and the cause why he resigned.—The
Departure of the Governor.—The Address of Bishop Folding
and the Catholic Clergy to His Excellency before his departure,
and the Governor’s Reply.
By the passing of Sir Richard Bourke’s Church Act, the
different principal religious denominations were placed upon an
equality before the Government, and aid was granted in proportion
to their numbers. At the same time Sir Richard Bourke was
most anxious to introduce, as the law of the land, a system of
Education which would not interfere with the religious views of
the different churches, and by which efficient help would be given
to all; and he was of opinion that Lord Stanley’s system of
General Education, which had been lately established in Ireland,
would he admirably adapted for this purpose in the colony. The
measure of His Excellency, so justly and liberally conceived, by
no means met with the approval of some of the heads of the
religious bodies in the colony. The protestant bishop of the day,
Dr. Broughton, cried out loudly against it, and remonstrated by
sending a strong petition to His Excellency, to prevent Lord
Stanley’s school system from becoming the law of the colony.
Besides, the non-conformists also sided with Bishop Broughton
against the system. A meeting was held in Sydney, on the 24th
of June, 1836, in the Pulteney Hotel. And this meeting was
presided over by Bishop Broughton, and there were represented
the Presbyterians, the Independents, the Baptists, and the
Wesleyans. They unamiously came to the four following resolu-
tions. First, that this meeting having learned by official documents
recently published, that it is the intention of the Government to


propose the establishment in this colony, by an enactment of the
local legislature, of a system of general education; and that the
schools introduced into Ireland a few years ago under the sanction
of the British Government are thought to afford an appropriate
model for that system, do unanimously express their decided
opinion that any system of general education which shall be
founded on the principle of interdicting, either wholly or in part,
the use of the Holy Scriptures, according to the authorised version,
and of prayer, in which the doctrine of the Blessed Trinity may
be unequivocably acknowledged or implied, could not receive their
countenance and support, without a compromise of the essentials
of their faith. Second, that this meeting do now form itself into
a committee of protestants, to be hereafter enlarged in numbers
for the purposes of concerting measures to obtain the general co-
operation of the protestant body throughout the colony of New
South Wales, in petitioning His Excellency, the Governor,'and
the Honorable, the Legislative Council, on the subject of the plan
of general education, setting forth their objections to the basis on
which the same is founded, as being according to their conscien-
tious conviction, subversive to the fundamental principles of
protestantism, and, they are pursuaded, opposed also to the wishes
of a very large majority of the people of this community. Third,
that the petition now produced be adopted by this meeting, and
signed by the members present. Fourth, that for the more
effectual fulfilment of this purpose, a general committee be formed,
to consist, in addition to the individuals here present, of all the
protestant ministers having charge of congregations in Sydney,
and of twenty-four protestant laymen resident in Sydney, or the
vicinity thereof, of whom twelve shall be episcopalians, and twelve
members of other protestant denominations ; and of this general
committee any seven duly convened shall form a quorum. That
they shall have power to fill up vacancies on the principle of the
aforesaid proposition, and that the following ministers and laymen
be requested to constitute such committee : —( Signed ) The Right
Reverend, The Bishop of Australia ; George Allen, Esq.; Charles
Campbell, Esq.; Reverend William Cowper; Prosper De Mestre,
Esq.; Reverend J. D. Lang, in all thirty-six.
Dr. Broughton, the protestant bishop, in his speech delivered
at the Pulteney Hotel, on the 3rd of August, 1836, made some
very extravagant assertions and misstatements; for which Bishop
Folding brought him to account in a series of letters, with the
signature of “ Catholicus Ipse.” Which letters are inserted at the
end of the first part. Dr. Broughton in those letters is taken to
task, in a very able manner, for having asserted that the catholics


of the colony only numbered 16,000, whereas by the census of
1833, their numbers were 17,200, and that instead of the catholic
children only numbering 1600, within the four previous years
more than 1600 catholic children had been baptized. He showed
also how Dr. Broughton had misrepresented the doctrine of the
catholic church, as defined by the Council of Trent, in respect to
the reading of the scriptures ; and he explained his own views on
the vexed question of the fitness of the system of general education
proposed to be introduced into the colony by the Governor, Sir
Richard Bourke. These letters show how vigorous was the mind
of the gifted prelate at that time, and how capable he was of
defending the dogmas of the catholic faith, and protecting the
interests of that portion of the church which had been committed
to his care.
It will not be irrelevant to my subject, having arrived at this
time in my history, to give a brief acccount of the foundation of
Melbourne, which rose so rapidly into importance and became
the rival of Sydney ; and, on account of the sudden increase of
the catholic population, required that it should be recommended
by Bishop Bolding to the Holy See, to be erected into a Bishopric.
The origin of Port Philip as a settlement, with its capital
Melbourne, began in this way: The port and surrounding-
district were discovered by Captain Cook, when he surveyed
the coast in his good ship the “ Endeavour,” so far back as
the year 1770. From, the accounts of those who visited the
district from Sydney and Van Dieman’s Land, it soon
attracted notice on account of the capacious port, the richness of
the soil, the picturesqueness of the scenery, and above all its
admirable adaptability for cattle stations. The spirit of
enterprise was very strong in those days, and many ambitioned
to heap up wealth, by being shepherd kings, alias squatters.
Several attempts in the beginning were made by private
individuals to form settlements in Australia Felix, but failed.
Messrs. Hume and Hovel travelled across the country from
Sydney to the shores of Port Philip in the year 1824; but the
first permanent settlement is said to have been made by Mr.
Edward Henty, who landed at Portland Bay, to the south of Port
Philip, and formed there a whaling station in the year 1834. A
Mr. John Batman, although it seems more for his own private
interests than the public good, bargained with the natives
for land, and his first sheep station was where St. James’ Cathedral
now stands, in which place he had a shepherd’s hut. He
subsequently brought his wife and family from Yan Diemen’s
Land, built a house on the western side of the part which is


now Collins-street, and opened a general store. The New South
Wales Government would not recognize the bargain which Mr.
Batman and others had made with the natives. Sir Richard
Bourke, Governor of New South Wales, issued a proclamation
notifying that every treaty, bargain, and contract with the abori-
ginal natives for the possession, title, or claim to any crown lands
within New South Wales is void, as against the rights of the
crown; and that all persons found in possession of any such
lands without license or authority from His Majesty’s Govern-
ment first had and obtained for such purpose, would be con-
sidered as trespassers.
Sir Richard Bourke in his dispatch to Lord Glenelg, stated
that in consideration of the capital expended by Mr. Batman
and his associates, he was inclined to recommend an early
occupation of Port Philip. Mr. Batman had been negotiating
with Governor Arthur of Van Dieman’s Land for the acquisition
of no less a quantity of land than 600,000 acres, and that in the
vicinity of Port Philip; but Lord Glenelg in reply to a dispatch
of Governor Arthur, July 4, 1835, checked the ambitious career
of Mr. Batman and his associates, and said:—“ That all schemes
for making settlements by private individuals or companies in
the unlocated districts of Australia, have of late years been
discouraged by His Majesty’s Government, as leading to fresh
establishments involving the mother country in an indefinite
expense, and exposing both the natives and new settlers to many
dangers and calamities. And there is so much of prudence and
of justice, and I think I may add of humanity in this policy, that I
do not feel disposed to depart from it in the present instance.”
There can be no question but that His Excellency Sir Richard
Bourke, with the concurrence of Lord Glenelg, was the real founder
of the Colony of Victoria, and but for his exertions and prompt-
ness, Melbourne would be now very small in all probability and
surrounded in its immediate vicinity with cattle stations and
sheep walks.
It was on the 4th March, 1837, that Governor Sir Richard
Bourke landed on the banks of the Yarra Yarra, from H.M. ship
“ Rattlesnake ” with Captain Hobson, R.N., for the purpose of
founding the colony. He was accompanied by Captain Hunter,
the military secretary; George Kenyon Holden, Esq., his
private secretary; Captain P. P. King, as his travelling
companion; and Mr. Robert Hoddle, surveyor in charge. His
Excellency fixed the site for a township and called it Melbourne,
after the then Prime Minister. The town of Melbourne was laid
out by Mr. Hoddle. The principal streets were measured 99 feet


wide. Collins-street was named after Lieutenant Governor
Collins; Flinders-street after Captain Flinders; Bourke-street
after Governor Bourke ; Lonsdale-street after Captain Lonsdale ;
Swanston-street after Captain Swanston ; and Russel-street after
Lord John Russel. Governor Bourke then visited Mount Macedon
and Geelong; he named Geelong after the native name of the
hill on which Geelong is built. Hobson’s Bay was named by the
Governor after Captain Hobson, commander of H.M. ship the
“ Rattlesnake,” which brought His Excellency to Port Philip. An
address was presented to the Governor by the inhabitants before
he left for Sydney, to which he made a suitable reply. The
population then amounted to 600. During his stay three
counties were marked out, viz.: Williams, Melbourne, and Geelong.
During that short stay, not much more than a month, he
accomplished a great deal and returned to Sydney, 7th April,
1837.
I have given this account of the foundation of Melbourne
because I will often have to refer to it, when writing about
affairs in connection with the church and its wonderful
development in that part. Now, for the information of our
friends in the northern hemisphere, who are so very apt to make
mistakes as to our geographical positions in Australia, I will state
that Melbourne is distant from Sydney about 500 miles to the
south, lat. 87° 29' 25" ; east, longitude 144° 59'.
Before Governor Bourke went to Port Philip, he had tendered
his resignation if Mr. Riddell, the colonial treasurer, were re-
instated as a member of the executive council. He had removed
him from his seat in the council, because he allowed himself to
be nominated and elected chairman of the quarter sessions, at the
instance of a hostile clique of magistrates, who had put him
forward in opposition to Mr. Therry. This was an act of official
impropriety on the part of Mr. Riddell and for which he deserved
to be removed from his seat in the executive council which he
held by virtue of his official position, which the Governor
could not condone. A dispatch came from Lord Glenelg, which
restored Mr. Riddle to his seat in the executive council, on the
grounds that suspension for one year was sufficient punishment
for his indiscretion. Another dispatch arrived shortly after
urging the Governor not to carry out his resolution; but Sir
Richard Bourke declined to sit with Mr. Riddell and consequently
made preparations to leave the colony.
A public meeting was convened in Sydney, to devise
measures to present the Governor with a suitable valedictory
address; Mr. C. Wentworth was the principal speaker on the
occasion ; an address was agreed to by the meeting, and in due


time presented. In this address the colonists and citizens of
Sydney acknowledged the reforms, useful regulations, and works
of the greatest public utility begun and completed by His
Excellency: but the people in general were not content with this
customary tribute of respect to a departing Governor, whom they
held in the highest estimation, they would further testify their
appreciation of the great good he had done to the colony, by
determining to erect a statue to his memory. At the same meeting
£6BO were collected for this purpose; and, not long after the
departure of Sir Richard Bourke, his statue of bronze was erected
in the Inner Domain of the Government House. The statue is
raised on a pedestal of granite, on the base of which is inscribed
an accorrnt of those services performed by him, which entitle him
to the everlasting remembrance of the colonists.
I here transcribe this tribute to his worth :—“ This statue of
Lieutenant-General Sir Richard Bourke, K.C.8., is erected by the
people of New South Wales, to record his able, honest, and
benevolent administration from 1831 to 1837. Selected for the
Government at a period of singular difficulty, his judgment,
urbanity, and firmness, justified the choice. Comprehending at
once the vast resources peculiar to this colony, he applied them
for the first time systematically to its benefit. He voluntarily
divested himself of the prodigious influence arising from the
assignment of penal labour, and enacted great and salutary laws
for the amelioration of penal discipline. He was the first
Governor who published satisfactory accounts of the public
receipts and expenditure. Without oppression or detriment to any
interest, he raised the revenue to a vast amount, and from its
surplus realised extensive plans of emigration. He established
religious equality on a just and firm basis, and sought to provide
for all, without distinction of sect, a sound and adequate system
of national education. He constructed various public works of
permanent utility. - He founded the flourishing settlement of
Port Philip, and threw open the wilds of Australia to pastoral
enterprise. He established Savings Banks, and was the patron of
the first Mechanics Institute. He created an equitable tribunal
for determining upon claims to grants of land. He was the warm
friend of the liberty of the press. He extended trial by jury
after its almost total suspension for many years. By these and
numerous other measures, for the moral, religious, and general
improvement of all classes, he raised the colony to an unexampled
prosperity, and retired amid the fervent and affectionate regret of
the people, having won their confidence by his integrity, their
gratitude by his services, their admiration by his public talents,
and their esteem by his private worth.”


The following address was presented by the Right Reverend
Dr. Folding and his clergy to Sir Richard Bourke, shortly before
his departure from the colony.
The Roman Catholic Bishop and Clergy to His Excellency
Lieutenant Sir Richard Bourke, K.C.8., commanding Her
Majesty’s Forces in, and Governor of, New South Wales,
&c., &c., &c.
We, the Roman Catholic Bishop and Clergy of New Holland,
feel it our duty to express to your Excellency on the eve of your
retiring from the administration of colonial government our sense
of the moral and political benefits conferred by you on this
portion of the British Empire.
While we give expression to the admiration and gratitude
with which we contemplate the advantages derived by this
country from your wise and impartial administration, it
becomes our sacred profession, and the position we hold amongst
our fellow colonists, more particularly to allude to those acts
which have fallen under our episcopal observation. The solici-
tude you have evinced to establish on its proper basis general
good, and in particular exigencies, the assistance which the state
is to give to religious forms of belief, deserves to be mentioned
with the highest respect; in a society so peculiarly constructed,
assistance on the part of the state appears just and reasonable
and not less so that it should be administered in proportion to the
number of its component parts, you have adopted that happy
medium which is the best and fittest for the wants of the colony.
Total support would nurture internal weakness and helplessness,
the total abstraction of aid would bring the zeal and efforts of
individuals to abortive decay.
Consistent with those principles of even-handed justice you
have so distinctly laid down and acted upon in your numerous
legislative enactments and minutes, Your Excellency has shown
respect for the rights of conscience, even in the infant. Perhaps
no measure according to its extent has been productive of more
gratification than the institution for the support of our destitute
children. You have allayed the heart-burning with which a
numerous class beheld the orphan deprived of its sole inheritence,
the faith of its fathers. The mother is no longer borne down
under the weight of her toil, by the afflicting reflection that her
offspring is even then purchasing food and raiment at a price
compared to which life is by her deemed valueless, that alienated
from her in affection, and abhorrent of her creed, the meeting of
child and parent is unnaturally shunned.


We have to express our thanks for the urbanity of manner,
courteous attention, and prompt decision with which our official
communications have been received and conducted, and in general
for the cordial co-operation we have received from your govern-
ment in our efforts to promote the moral good of the inhabitants
of the colony. We would refer, however, in a particular manner
to that class which in proportion to its wants will be made the
object of his first care by the Christian legislator. We allude to
the convict population, a class doomed to punishment, but not to
despair; degraded, yet not to be cast away; emblem of man in
his fallen state, to be reclaimed, amended, reformed, not in the
sternness of unmitigated justice, which is of the heathen, but in
mercy, the essence of the Christian institute. We are not accus-
tomed, sir, to speak the language of adulation, but rather to
declare the truth in plainness of speech, and we do not hesitate to
state on extensive experience that your humane regulations have
produced in the convict population, under our pastoral care,
results the most gratifying; their numbers have been annually
increased to a considerable amount, yet crime has diminished; a
healthy contentedness of mind, under the influence of religion,
has generated a disposition to improve the adverse circumstances
of their condition ; a high moral purpose has succeeded a mis-
anthropic sourness and gloomy despondency which heretofore
rendered the convict careless and reckless. We mention this fact,
for it proves the course you adopted and pursued, unawed by
intimidation and undisturbed by clamour, has been instrumental
in effecting a great practical good.
In retiring, sir, from this government you will bear with you
not only the conviction that your measures, the emanations of a
mind singularly comprehensive and benevolent, were intended and
directed to promote the best interests of the colony, but proof of
their success. The testimony of your own conscience, that in the
administration of your high office you have never, either from
favor or aversion, passed the bounds of equity, receives a faithful
and applauding response wherever judgment has not been misled
by party or warped by prejudice.
Yes sir ! this colony owes you an immense debt of gratitude,
accumulating as the progress of time and the spread of population
shall more fully develop, and more severely test the excellence
of your policy and the depth of your foresight, and that debt
future generations will gladly own in the reverence and love with
which your name will be enshrined in their breasts.
Religious intolerance you have crushed all the arts of
peace you have encouraged—you have opened sources of


blessing to the miserable, the healing waters of which are and will
be for ages doing the work of God. No honors, no demonstration of
grateful feeling can be equal to the satisfaction derived from a
consciousness of having lived for a purpose so noble, so becoming
the man, the Christian, the legislator. May you live long to enjoy
it, and to witness the prosperity of this colony, which will ever
number your Excellency among its chief benefactors ! With our
best wishes, in deep regret and respect, we bid you farewell!

[Reply,]
I have much satisfaction in receiving this token of respect
and attachment from the clergy of a communion which reckons
within its pale a large proportion of the inhabitants of New South
Wales. I have observed with great pleasure the exertions which,
though few in number, you have made for the reforming and
improving the character and conduct of the unhappy persons of
your persuasion, who quit their country under the penal sentence
of the law. To these exertions is to be attributed the peaceable
and orderly behaviour which has latterly been observed to pre-
vail among the Roman Catholic convicts.
Continue, gentlemen, to instil into their minds the love of God
and of their neighbour, and be assured that in thus consulting
their temporal and eternal interests, and in conferring an impor-
tant service to the State, you best manifest the gratitude which I
am convinced you entertain for the religous freedom which in
common with other denominations of Christians you have lately
obtained.
(Signed) BOURKE, K.C.B.
Governor Bourke left the colony on sth December, 1837. A
large concourse accompanied him to the place of embarkation,
including the clergy of the various denominations, the officials,
and persons of every grade and class.


CHAPTER II.
The first Ordinations which took place in the Colony.—The de-
parture of the Vicar-General Dr. Ullathorne, for Europe, to
procure more priests.—Public meeting of the Catholics held
in St. Mary’s Cathedral to raise funds for the completion
of the building.—The first Oratorio given in the Colony. —
The commencement of St. Mary’s Seminary.—The labours
of Bishop Polding..—The accidental death of the Revd. J. V.
Corcoran.—Laying of the Foundation Stone of St Mathew’s
Church, Windsor, 20th December, 1836.—The Ordination of
Revd. H .G. Gregory, to the order of Priesthood, 17th March,
1837.—The Arrival of the Revd. Charles Lovat, who takes
charge of St. Mary’s Seminary.
Now I will continue to recount the events and affairs more
intimately connected with the church and the administration of
the Right Revd. Dr. Folding. I have stated that Messrs. Sumner,
Gregory, and Spencer were professed monks of the Order of St.
Benedict when they came to the colony, in the year 1835, with
Bishop Folding. They were prosecuting their theological studies,
which they had commenced in the College of Downside, at Bath,
during the voyage, and continued so after their arrival in the
colony. On Sunday, Bth May, 1836, Messrs. Spencer and
Gregory were promoted to the order of Deacon in St. Mary’s
Cathedral; and on the following Monday the Revd. C. Sumner
was ordained priest. He was the first priest ordained in the
colony. It was considered advisable for the Vicar-General, the
Very Revd. Wm. Ullathorne, to proceed to Europe to procure
more priests. He and Dr. Folding, the Bishop, sailed together for
Hobart Town, on Tuesday, 10th May, the day after the ordina-
tion. They arrived safely at Hobart Town and Dr. Ullathorne
took shipping there for England. Bishop Folding remained at
Hobart Town to look after the interests of the church, and settle
some matters about church land, but returned to Sydney by 4th
June.
The Bishop was most anxious to see St. Mary’s Cathedral
completed; he published a pastoral on the subject, and called a
public meeting of the Catholics, which was held in the Cathedral,
on 10th July, 1836. The pastoral was read at the meeting, which
strongly urged the Catholics to exert themselves by subscribing
towards the completion of the Cathedral.
The Church Act, introduced by Sir M. Bourhe, teas passed on
29th July, 1836. The Revd. T. Watkins was appointed Vicar-
General of Hobart Town, and sailed from Sydney for that place on
13th August, 1836. There had arisen a misunderstanding


between the Bishop and Kevd. P. Connolly ; Father Connolly
was superseded by the Yicar-General, Father Watkins.
The first oratorio given in Australia took place in St. Mary’s
Cathedral, the 21st September, 1836. The orchestra was under
the direction of Mr Y. Wallace, and ably did he sustain his repu-
tation on the occasion as the first musician of the colony ; he led
the music with the violin, of which instrument he was a master.
This is the same Wallace who afterwards composed several operas
in Europe, for which he is famous. The Cathedral contained on
that occasion the most numerous assembly up to that time ever
convened in the colony, 700 found suitable and pleasing accommo-
dation. The orchestra was raised over the sanctuary. There
were about 1,000 listeners in the church. The Bishop and clergy
were present, as well as the public officials and distinguished
individuals of the colony. The principal selections were from
Handel’s “ Messiah ” and Haydn’s “ Creation,” and other beautiful
pieces of sacred music were given. Mrs. Bust, a distinguished
vocalist of the colony in those days, sustained her reputation.
She sang “ Comfort ye my people ” and other pieces with great
power and sweetness. Mrs. Chester, another favourite singer,
gave “With verdure clad the fields appear.” Miss Wallace, the
sister of the distinguished conductor, sang “I know that my
Redeemer liveth, &c.” This young lady, it was remarked,
possessed a fine flexible and powerful voice, which marked her
out for eminence in the musical world. The proceeds of the
Oratorio went to the building of St. Mary’s Cathedral. The
service of the church was not neglected in those early times.
An advertisement appears in the “Australian” newspaper of 23rd
December, ,1836, that on Christmas day, at St. Mary’s Cathedral,
the first mass would be at six a.m.; the second at half-past seven
a.m. ; the third at half-past eight a.m. And that high mass would
be celebrated by the Right Revd. Bishop at 11 o’clock. Mass to
be celebrated at Liverpool at 7 o’clock by Revd. Mr. Sumner.
The nucleus of St. Mary’s seminary was formed in the year
1836, when there were four students intended for the church
pursuing their preparatory studies in the Bishop’s house at
Woolloomooloo, viz.—Messrs. Harding, Kenny, Reynolds, and
Gorman. In the beginning of the year 1837, Mr. Reynolds and
a Mr. Ferguson went to Europe to prosecute their studies for the
church there. Mr. Reynolds studied at St. Sulpice in Paris, and
Mr. Ferguson in the Propaganda at Rome. After three or four
years family matters caused Mr. Reynolds to return to the
colony, but he did not resume his ecclesiastical studies, but
afterwards became a solicitor in Sydney. Mr. Ferguson was
ordained in England, and he did not return to the colony. In


the years 1836-37 the time of the good Bishop was very much
occupied in corresponding with the government and visiting, from
time to time, all the districts about Sydney with the view of
preparing them for the placing of resident clergymen. When he
obtained some leisure from the discharge of his onerous duties
he did not forget his young charge, the hopes of the ministry ;
he would call them into his study in the quiet of the evening and
hear them repeat those passages of scripture which he had given
them to learn, and then he learnedly explained them, and never
failed to put before them the sanctity, the glory, the responsibility,
and the perils of the ecclesiastical state. Those homely and fatherly
instructions of the saintly bishop always made a deep impression,
and were never forgotten. The Mission, towards the end of 1837,
sustained a great loss in the death of the Rev. J. V. Corcoran.
But for the will of God, he could badly be spared. He was stationed
at Windsor, 40 miles from Sydney. While seated in a. gig,
journeying towards Sydney, the wheel slipped into a rut near
the old toll-bar—he was thrown out, and the vehicle passed over
his head and neck. He was taken into the toll-house, but
only survived about a quarter of an hour. All the Catholics were
deeply affected at his sudden death, for he was greatly beloved
by every one who knew him, and by none more so than the
affectionate Bishop and those with whom Father Corcoran came
to the colony. His remains lie in the old Catholic Cemetery in
Devonshire-street. Requiescat in pace.
The following account of the inquest appeared in the papers
of the day :
New South Wales, Sydney, to wit. An Inquisition taken at
the Toll Gate, Sydney-road, Sydney aforesaid, in the colony afore-
said, on the fourth day of August in the year of our Lord one
thousand eight hundred and thirty-seven, before me John Ryan
Brenan, gentleman, one of the coroners of our Lord the King for the
colony aforesaid, upon view of the body of James Vincent
Corcoran, then and there lying dead. Upon the oaths of Henry
McDermott, George Langley, Henry Merritt, Janies Cosgrove,
William Welch, Christopher Flinn, Edward Ryan, John Fisher,
Patrick Maher, Edmund Fitzgibbons, James Roche, and Patrick
Grace, good and lawful men of Sydney aforesaid, who being
sworn and charged to inquire on the part of our said Lord the
King, when, where, how, and after what manner the said James
Vincent Corcoran came to his death, do say upon their oaths
that the said James Vincent Corcoran on the fourth day of
August in the year aforesaid, on the Parramatta-road leading
to Sydney, in the district aforesaid, came to his death by being
accidentally thrown from his gig on the said road, and then and


there receiving an injury on the head, which then and there
produced death and not otherwise. Witness as well the said
coroner as the jurors aforesaid have to this inquisition, put their
hands and seals on the day and year and at the place first above
written :—John Ryan Brenan, coroner ; H. McDermott, foreman ;
Edward Ryan, Jas. Cosgrove Henry Bennett, William Walsh,
Christopher Flynn, George Langley, Edmund Fitzgibbon, James
Roche, John Fisher, P. Maher, Patrick Grace.
In the territory of New South Wales, Sydney, to wit.
Informations of witnesses sevex-ally taken and acknowledged on
behalf of our Sovereign Lord the King, touching the death of the
Reverend James Vincent Corcoran at the Toll Gate, Sydney-road,
on the fourth day of August in the year of our Lord one
thousand eight hundred thirty-seven, before John Ryan Brenan,
Esquire, one of the coroners for the said territory. Edward Ryan
of Galong, county of King, being sworn, saidl was in company
with the deceased this afternoon in a gig, he was driving from
Windsor to Sydney, after passing the Toll Bar on the entrance
into Sydney about twenty or thirty rods, the wheel got into a rut
or hole and threw him out of the gig, he went out head foremost,
the gig was not upset, it was produced by a sudden jerk, I was
thrown out of the gig, the wheel of the gig went over the
deceased’s head, the horse was trotting moderately at the time, I
laid hold of the reins and stopped the horse, I got out of the gig
and came up to the deceased, Mr. McDermott and the Reverend
Mr. Summer came up to the body before me, the deceased was
removed into the Toll Gate House. I was taking off his coat
and I asked the deceased if his arm was broken and the deceased
answered “ No,” he did not speak after this. Dr. Hosking and
Dr, Smith were sent for and arrived before life was extinct. The
deceased was not bled, the surgeons said if he was bled he would
die immediately. The deceased departed about ten minutes after
the arrival of Dr. Hosking and almost immediately after the
arrival of Dr. Smith. I have no doubt on my mind but that it
was purely accidental by being thrown from the gig, and also
that the injuries which the deceased received, as I have
already described, were the cause of his death. Neither of the
doctors then called in are in attendance. This circumstance
occurred between five and six o’clock this evening to the best of
my recollection. The mark which is observable on the right side
of the cheek of the deceased, has been produced either by the
fall or by the wheel passing over the head of the deceased. The
body viewed by the jury on this inquest is the body of the
Reverend James Vincent Corcoran. I was an intimate friend of
the deceased. (Signed) Edw. Ryan.


It was noticed in the Australian Newspaper that the founda-
tion stone of a church, dedicated to St. Matthew the Apostle, was
to be laid and blessed by the Right Rev. Bishop Bolding, at
Windsor, on Wednesday, 28th December, 1836. It was during
the incumbency of Father Corcoran in Windsor the foundation
stone of St. Matthew’s Church was laid by the bishop, Dr. Folding,
on 28th December, 1836. He preached on the occasion, and all
the Catholics of the district were assembled to witness the inter-
esting ceremony of the commencement of the first Catholic
Church in the Windsor district. I may note here, as it occurred
at this time, that the Rev. Father Gregory was ordained a priest
by the Right Rev. Dr. Folding, in St. Joseph’s Chapel, on 17th
March, 1837, and he was the second priest ordained in the colony,
Father Sumner being the first.
Towards the end of the year 1837 arrived in the colony the
Rev. Charles Lovat, he came to conduct the Seminary; he. was
the first, perhaps, who brought to the colony a set of apparatus
to assist in illustrating lectures on natural philosophy. He was
a man of no ordinary abilities and attainments, and was well
grounded in physical science and mathematics; a distinguished
classical scholar and a sound theologian. He came from Stony-
hurst College, in England, and had been for some years the
professor of physics and moral theology. He went through his
theological course at the Propaganda, in Rome. Not long after
the arrival of the Rev. Charles Lovat, there arrived in the colony
two young theological students from the College of Waterford, in
Ireland, their names were Messrs. Walsh and McGrath. They
were received by the bishop, and immediately resumed the study
of theology, and at the same time assisted by teaching in the
Seminary. The first lay boarders of St. Mary’s Seminary were
Augustus Carter, William Carter, John McQuade, William
McQuade, later on Flanagan, William Gorman, Thomas Fennell,
Gerard Philips, George Plunket, William Plunket, George Therry,
and Joseph Leary, &c.
The first advertisement, relating to St. Mary’s Seminary,
appeared in the Australian Newspaper, of January, 1838, —■
“ Seminary of St. Mary’s, adjoining St. Mary’s Cathedral. This
institution will be opened pro forma on the 26th of this month.
Studies will be commenced on the Ist February. It will be con-
ducted under the direction of the Right Rev. Bishop. For terms
and tickets of admission apply to the Rev. John McEncroe,
Administrator, or the Rev. Charles Lovat, President. Only a
limited number of boarders will be received.”

The president, Rev. C. Lovat, formed the seminary (before
it was removed to the building near St. Mary’s) in the bishop’s
house at Woolloomooloo—a large commodious residence with
an extensive garden, and from twenty to thirty acres of lawn in
front facing the bay. Rut the property was only rented and
belonged to the Reilly estate. The old house and garden have
disappeared and the entire ground is now, in 1885, covered with
houses and streets. The play ground is no longer discernible.
Next to the president in charge of the seminary in the
beginning, was Mr. John Kenny, one of the ecclesiastical students
who came to the colony with Bishop Folding, and Mr. Boyle, a good
classical scholar, was the lay teacher. The president was well
acquainted with college discipline, and he soon made excellent
regulations for both studies and play.
CHAPTER III.
Strenuous efforts made for the completion of St. Mary’s
cathedral.—The arrival of two priests, Revs. Brady and,
Gould and two ecclesiastical students, 24th February,
1838—Grants of land given by catholics and others as sites
for churches —The treatment of Father Brady when he
applied to a protestant gentleman for a subscription to
help in building his church—The efforts of Dr. Ullathorne
to obtain priests in Ireland —The arrival of eight Roman
catholic clergymen, 15th July, 1838—Some extracts and
remarks on Dr. Ullathorne’s pamphlet entitled “The
Catholic Mission in Australasia.”
During this year, 1838, strenuous efforts were being made,
both by the clergy and the catholic community for the completion
of St. Mary’s cathedral. There appeared in the “ Australian”
newspaper of March, 1838, the following advertisement: “ A
subscription list has been opened for the purpose of completing
the plastering of St. Mary’s church ; the roof is now nearly
finished and on completion of the plastering, this spacious and
handsome edifice will afford ample and convenient room to the
large congregation of Christians who resort to this church.”
The following sums have been already subscribed ;


I noticed a few pages back that Dr. Ullathorne went to
England and Ireland to try and obtain more missionaries, for they
were very much needed and the catholics were increasing rapidly
in the colony. The first happy result of his endeavours was the
arrival of two priests and two ecclesiastical students ; they came
in the “Upton Castle,” 24th February, 1838, which ship brought the
new Governor, Sir George Gipps ; they were the Rev. John Brady,
an experienced and prudent priest, who had been for nineteen years
a missionary in the Island of the Mauritius : the other was a young
priest, Rev. James Gould, of the order of St. Augustine, lately or-
dained, who came direct from his monastery in Italy, where he had
prosecuted his studies. Dr. Ullathorne first met him on the steps of
St. Augustine’s Church in the Piazza del Popolo at Rome, and
induced him to labour on the Australian mission. He is now, in
the year 1885, the Archbishop of Melbourne. Messrs. Farrelly
and McPhilip who accompanied them were not in Holy Orders,
but had finished their classical studies, they were prepared to
commence philosophy, and whilst studying logic, metaphysics, and
theology under the learned president, they assisted by teaching in
the seminary. The senior priest, Rev. John Brady, was
appointed after a short time to Windsor, which had been widowed
of its pastor, through the untimely death of the Rev. James
Vincent Corcoran. The Rev. James Gould remained for a
considerable time in Sydney assisting the Rev. John McEncroe
(whose duties were very arduous amongst the prison population).
When the vicar-general Dr. Ullathorne returned to the colony, he
was appointed to Campbelltown.
At this time very few catholics enjoyed the wealth of this
world, houses or land; but some had acquired moderate riches,
and from time to time gave donations to the church; but
generally what they did accumulate was by the sweat of their
brow. A Mr. Thomas Humphries, who followed with his sons
the calling of fishermen at the Heads and Brisbane Water, had
realised considerable property. Mr. Humphries gave a grant of
three acres at Brisbane Water, as a site for a church and burial
ground. By the direction of the Right Reverend Bishop Folding
a meeting was held at Brisbane Water on 4th July, 1838, when a
resolution was passed returning thanks to Mr. Humphries for his
liberal donation. It will be seen by the resolutions, that some
persons in that locality were very much disposed to find fault
with the liberal provision of Sir Richard Bourke’s Church Act,
when they tried to induce the catholics to sign a petition, by
which they promised to attend the protestant place of worship,
and the police magistrate showed an earnest wish to return to the


old system of oppression, when he enjoined that the catholics of
that place should attend the protestant church. But the days of
persecution were gone!
I adjoin the resolutions passed at the meeting: —
[advertisement.]
At a meeting of the Roman catholic inhabitants of the
district of Brisbane Water, convened after the celebration of
Divine service, on the 4th July by direction of the Right
Reverend Bishop—the Rev. John McEncroe in the chair—the
following resolutions were passed :
First—That this meeting records its approval of the sentiments
expressed by his Excellency Sir George Gipps on various
occasions, relative to the moral improvement of the colony,
and hereby pledges itself to promote the same by example,
and other laudable and honourable means.
Second—Resolved, that for this purpose a subscription be opened
to obtain the funds requisite for the erection of a church,
and we respectfully call upon the inhabitants of the district
to assist us in the undertaking.
Third —That the thanks of this meeting are due, and are hereby
given, to Mr. Thomas Humphries, for his donation of three
acres of land as a site for the chureh and burial ground, in
a situation central and convenient, and that the Right
Reverend Bishop be most respectfully requested to accept
the same.
Fourth—That a committee of three be appointed to take the
names of Roman catholics willing to attend Divine service
in the intended church ; and this meeting, in making this
appointment, expresses its regret that members of the Roman
catholic faith have been cajoled to subscribe a declaration
that they would attend a place of worship not of their own
faith, under a pretence that it was a mere matter of form to
obtain a clergyman’s stipend ; a pretence dishonourable and
disgraceful to all parties connected with or concerned in it.
Fifth—That this meeting cannot separate without noticing an
order of the Police Magistrate of the district, dated January
Ist, requiring all assigned servants—catholics as well as
protestants—to meet each Sunday at the usual places of
protestant worship ; and, whilst we appreciate at its proper
value the privilege appended thereto, viz.:—that of allowing
the catholics to remain outside till service is over —we detect
in the granting of that privilege an assumption of authority
destructive of religious freedom, and not sanctioned by any
existing regulation or law.


Sixth —That the reverend chairman do present these resolutions
to the Eight Eeverend Bishop for his Lordship’s approval,
and, if approved, they may be published.
The following committee was then appointed—consisting of
Denis Dwyer, James Mullins, and Thomas Humphries; and sub-
scriptions to the amount of £65 10s. were procured in a few
minutes.
Signed on behalf of the meeting,
J. McEnceoe,
Chairman.

Not long after the arrival of the Rev. John Brady, by the
directions of the bishop, he held a meeting of the Catholics of
Penrith for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of Sir
Richard Bourke’s Church Act, in regard to the erection of
churches, as the catholics of the district of Penrith were very
much in want of a place of worship. Sir John Jamison, who
was a member of the Executive Council and favourably disposed
to catholics, lived on his estate in the vicinity of the town-
ship ; he offered a piece of ground for the erection of a catholic
church; another protestant gentleman, John Tindale, Esq., also
offered ground for the same purpose.
I subjoin the resolutions which were passed at the meeting,
and approved of by Bishop Folding.
[advertisement.]
At a meeting of the Roman catholic inhabitants of the district
of Penrith, convened by the direction of the Right Reverend
Bishop, in the Court House, after the celebration of Divine service,
on Thursday, 26th April, 1838—the Reverend John Brady in the
chair—Resolutions to the following purport were unanimously
passed;—
First, —That this meeting has derived cordial satisfaction from
the sentiments expressed by His Excellency, the Governor,
on various occasions, relative to the moral improvement of
the colony, and particularly of the prisoners of the Crown,
sentiments in which the true spirit of Christian philanthropy
and justice is distinctly recognisable.


Second.—That a considerable portion of the population of the
district of Penrith, free and bond, professing the Koman
catholic faith, are in want of a place of worship which
ought to be immediately supplied, in order to carry the
benevolent intentions of His Majesty’s Government, as
expressed by His Excellency, into effect.
Third. —That for this purpose a subscription be commenced
forthwith, and a committee be appointed to promote its
progress.
Fourth. —That application be respectfully made to the magistrates
and gentlemen of the district soliciting their aid, and this
meeting assures itself of their liberal co-operation in the
erection of the church contemplated, an object so essentially
connected with the moral improvement of the Roman
catholic assigned servants and others placed under their
responsible care and control.
Fifth.—That the thanks of this meeting are due to Sir John
Jamison for his kind offer of a site for the intended church,
and the Reverend Chairman is requested to present the
same.
Sixth.—That the thanks of this meeting are due to John Tindale,
Esq., for his kind offer of a site for the church. That our
Reverend Pastor be deputed most respectfully to request the
Right Reverend Bishop to accept the same, it being a
situation generally convenient to the inhabitants of the
township.
Seventh.—That the Reverend Chairman be requested to submit
these regulations to the approbation of the Right Reverend
Bishop, and if approved of by His Lordship, that they be
published.

Not long after this meeting there was a singular display of
bigotry shown by a protestant gentleman living not far from
Penrith, and a landed proprietor. Father Brady in compliance
with the fourth resolution passed at the meeting, called upon this
gentleman soliciting a subscription from him for the intended
church ; when the poor father, without being invited to sit down,


was met with a tirade of abuse, charging the catholic church with
superstition and error; and random texts of scripture were hurled at
his head ; such was the conduct of this individual, full of rancour
and animosity towards the humble priest, who begged for help to
enable him to build a church in part for the benefit of the gentle-
man’s assigned servants, who were tilling his broad acres and en-
riching him by the sweat of their brow, and at but a small expense
to him. But this is not all—to add injury to insult, the same
person, when Father John Brady wrote a letter, expostulating
with him on the impropriety of his treatment, had this letter
inserted in the Gazette, holding up the priest to ridicule. Father
Brady had been speaking the French language for nineteen years,
and had lost his former command over the English language ; he
made a few orthographical mistakes in the letter, and for this
reason it was published. “ Tantcene animis coelestibus irce ? ”
(To the Editor of the Australian.)
Sir, —You will much oblige by inserting the following article
in refutation of one which appeared in the Sydney Gazette of
Tuesday last, in your paper of to-morrow.
I remain, Sir, Yours &c.,
ERIGENA.
The Rev. Mr, Brady.
It requires considerable discrimination to decide on the
relative claims of the Editor of the Gazette, and of the individual
who furnished him with Mr. Brady’s letter, to the rank of honor-
able men. Rev. Mr. Brady applies in a respectful manner to
Mr. Cox for a subscription towards the erection of a place of
worship for the use of the Roman Catholic servants and dependents
of that gentleman —without being asked even to sit down, he is
assailed by Mr. Cox with a volley of controversial texts, and
stunned with the charge of superstitious and unscriptural
doctrines. The Rev. gentlemen very properly declines entering the
lists with this sturdy disputant in his own house. Mrs. Cox, on
perceiving this uncourteous reception, endeavors by her kind
attentions to remove the unfavorable impressions that her
husband’s theological wrath was calculated to make on the mind
of a stranger, whom she at once recognizes to have been
accustomed to better manners. On the next day the Rev. Mr.
Brady writes a letter in French, which language he had almost
exclusively used for the last nineteen years, and translates it into
English, obviously retaining the French idiom and pronunciation,


and thus commits two or three orthographical errors. The editor
of the Gazette adds a few more of his own inventions with false
punctuations, not to be found in the original.
Is it the act of a gentleman to send such a letter, under such
circumstances to such a man as the yclept editor of the Gazette ?
Had the learned editor spent eighteen or nineteen years of his
precious life in a foreign land, he might have lost some of
that purely English and Johnsonian style, which he so perfectly
formed during his long and extended literary pursuits in the
Dublin University !!!
Mr. Cox has been handing about the letter to the great
edification and delight of the elect “and elite.” No candid mind
will condemn the tenor of the letter—and Mr. Cox may rest
assured that he would make but a poor exhibition in a critical or
controversial Biblical discussion with the Rev. Mr. Brady. The
profound editor himself with all his classical lore, may be put to
his utmost to stand a few tilts over a Hebrew root, or' a Greek
particle with this “ hedge ” priest as he so elegantly designates
this unoffending clergyman.
Erigena.
P.S.—The following note from Judge Filhole of the Isle of
Bourbon, containing an extract from the “ Feuille Hebdoma-
daire ” of the 19th October, 1836, will show in what estimation
the Rev. Mr. Brady was held by his parishioners in that island
The Gazette man and his correspondent no doubt are able to read
French.
“ Mon cher Abbe, voici I’article dont je vous ai parle.
‘ L’Allier’ porte en France Monsieur Brady, cure de la paroisse de
Sainte Marie. Nous ne saurions trop faire I’eloge de cet
ecclesiastique. C’est le vrai pretre catholique d’un desinteresse-
ment parfait—ll consacrait toutes ses ressources au soulagement
des pauvres, et a I’education des enfants de la paroisse. Homme
d’esprit et d’instruction, il a su se faire aimer et estimer dans la
commune de Sainte Marie que de toutes les lies c’est celle dont
les appreciations ressortent toujours les plus exemptes de
prevention et d’enthusiasme.—Yotre devoue Serviteur,
Filhole,
Juge dTnstruction.”
The very Rev. Dr. Ullathorne was very much assisted in
obtaining the young missionaries in Ireland by the Rev. Francis
Murphy, who had been educated at Maynooth and was highly
respected by the president and professors of the college. He had


been on the English mission for a few years, and was, when Dr.
Ullathorne met him, the senior priest of St. Patrick’s church in
Manchester; he then resigned his charge and consented to join
the Australian mission. Father Francis Murphy was, without
doubt, a great acquisition—he was both learned and pious,
possessed of a very clear head and sound judgment; eminent as a
preacher and an able controversialist; he also had great aptitude
for business connected with the temporalities of the church. He
became afterwards Bishop of Adelaide.
He took charge of the young missionaries who left Maynooth
and accompanied them to the colony. When the old catholics
read the names of these new arrivals, they will recall many
reminiscences, it will remind them of former days and those who
brought them back to the paths of virtue and happiness,
encouraged them in their struggles through life, and took the
deepest interest in both their spiritual and temporal welfare.
Some of those good priests have gone to their everlasting rest,
and some still labour with the same assiduity as they have ever
done, expecting the promised reward. Arrived in Sydney
Harbour on 15th July, 1838, the barque “ Cecilia,” Walker,
master, which left Gravesend 23rd March, 1838. Passengers:—
The Reverend Messrs. Murphy, M. O’Reilly, John Fitzpatrick,
Edward Mahoney, John Lynch, John Rigney, Michael Brenan,
and Thomas Slattery, Roman Catholic Clergymen. Mr. and
Mrs. Davies, Mr. and Mrs. Hawksly, and two children, Mr. Brady
Miss Fisher and Mr. McGrane. I have given the notice just as it
appeared in the Australian of July 17.
The bishop lost no time in appointing and sending the new
labourers to work in the vineyard of the Lord. They were sent
immediately to the different districts where they were most
wanted and for which in his judgment he thought they were best
qualified. The senior of the party, the Rev. Francis Murphy,
was retained in Sydney; the Reverend John Rigney was sent
to Wollongong; the Reverend John Fizpatrick to Goulbourn;
the Rev. Michal Brenan to Yass; the Rev. John Lynch to
Patrick’s Plain; the Rev. Edmund Mahoney to Maitland; the
Rev. Michael O’Reilly and the Rev. Thomas Slattery to North
and South Bathurst.
These gentlemen when going on their missions were provided
with salaries according to the provisions of Sir Richard Bourke’s
Church Act.
I think it will not be out of place to make some remarks
here and give some extracts from a pamphlet, published in En-
gland by Dr. Ullathorne in 1837, entitled “the Catholic Mission in
Australasia.” It was the reading of this production of the


vicar-general, which partly was the cause of those excellent
young priests volunteering to devote themselves to the Australian
mission. Dr. Ullathorne lays hare in that pamphlet the defects
of the system of transportation ; and considers the principal defect
is not making the ministrations of religion the basis upon which
the convict is to he reformed : he states that the number of
criminals annually transported at about 6,000; the number in
actual bondage in New South Wales, nearly 30,000; in Van
Dieman’s Land, 20,000 ; in the penal settlements of Norfolk
Island, Moreton Bay, and Port Arthur, 3,000.
He writes : —The prisoners, amounting to two or three
hundred, are sent in a ship to the colony; they are mixed indis-
criminately on board, young and old; those immersed in vice,
deep in every guilt, old in depravity, with those who have taken
but the first steps in wickedness. True, some Bibles and Common
Prayer Books are thrown in amongst them, but no prayer books
or books of instruction for the catholic convict, in which he
might find hope and motives for contrition. That when arrived
ashore and lodged in the barracks allotted for them at Hyde
Park and other places, there was the same neglect and want of
precaution,—in fact the work of contamination continued; when
they were consigned to the settlers these did not look to the moral
improvement of their assigned servants (thirty, perhaps, huddled
together in a few huts), but to the quantity of work which would
bring to them the most gain. No reward was held out to encourage
the prisoner in industry and good conduct, but constantly kept in
dread of being returned to Government, and continually under the
apprehension of the lash. He cites a passage from a writing of Mr.
Commissioner Therry, in the year 1832, describing the lot of the
catholic convict:—“ The moment he reaches the shores of Aus-
tralia he is sent into the interior of the country, there to be
assigned to a settler, at a distance of perhaps fifty, one hundred,
or even two hundred miles from Sydney. There he is estimated
according to the quantity of labour which he is capable of per-
forming—there, amidst associates, reckless in their habits, and
infamous in their vices, his days are passed without care and
without solicitude, —there also, (and it is of this I complain), the
voice of religion, with its salutary counsels end its blessed
consolations, never comes. For him religion has lost all sanction,
morality all attraction. Can it be wondered at, that when
temptation presents itself anew, the miserable man continues his
career of crime, until at length he expiates his offences on the
gallows; or by an equally terrible fate, is cast into a penal
settlement, whose inhabitants consist of a populus virorum, the
misery and the horror of which it is shocking to contemplate.”


The Vicar-General finishes his heart-rending account of the
misery and spiritual destitution of the unfortunate convict by
this solemn appeal. “Oh remember the human lot and have
pity! The presence of Christ is amongst them. His wounds
and His agonies bleed anew: He calls on you to help; will you
refuse Him ? No ; for you also are the child of His sorrows.
The wild heathen walks through them deprived of light. The
little children point with their finger, and ask you whether they
shall become like these. From the shadow of death which covers
them, ‘ bound in poverty and iron,’ they stretch forth their arms
with mine to supplicate you.”
This pamphlet, at the time, caused the greatest consternation
in the colony of N.S.W., especially amongst those who wished
transportation to be continued, considering it the main stay and
support of the agriculturalists and the owners of sheep and
cattle, for they had the labour of the convict for nothing, com-
paratively speaking, and thus amassed wealth by over-strained
muscles and sorrows unceasing, unpaid-for toil of degraded
humanity, without attempting to lay before them the sanctions
of religion to reform the unhappy men; whilst they made it
appear by their representations that the lot of the prisoners was
far from being an unhappy one, and that they had every comfort
and consolation that could be allowed them. But the testimony
of this pamphlet, as well as the evidence of Dr. Ullathorne before
the Transportation Committee in London and the writing and
evidence of others, dispelled for ever from the public mind this
delusion. It is fair to state that some employers of convict
labour in those days (but they were the exception) were kind
and compassionate, and tried to reform those who were under
their charge.
When Sir R Bourke’s Church Act came into full operation,
and a good supply of priests were provided, then a decided
change for the better was inaugurated. A clergyman was ap-
pointed for the spiritual wants of the prisoners on the voyage; the
jails, iron-gangs, barracks, and factories were attended to by the
priest; the stations in the interior were visited, and every
assistance and co-operation with the clergy was afforded by the
squatters for the moral improvement of their assigned servants.

The arrival of the Right Rev. Dr. Pompalier in Sydney, the first
Bishop and Vicar-Apostolic of New Zealand, 8th Deer., 1837.

protestant missionaries when he arrived in New Zealand.

Public Meeting in St. Mary’s Cathedral to repel the charge
made by Judge Willis, that “the worship of the Catholic
Church was idolatrous.” — The opinion of the Protestant
Bishop in regard to the denominational system of Educa-
tion.—The opinion of Sir John Jamison. — Political
movements commenced in the Colony.
The Right Rev. Dr. Pompalier, the first Bishop and Vicar-
Apostolic of New Zealand, with one priest, Pere Servant, and a
lay brother Frere Michael, arrived in Sydney harbour on the 8th
December, 1837. He came by the schooner “ Reatea,” which left
Otaheite 6th October, and the island of Rotamah on the 20th
November. He was cordially received by the Right Reverend Dr.
Folding, and was his guest in Sydney for about six weeks, when
he left for the scene of his future labours in New Zealand and
the adjacent islands of the Pacific Ocean. I insert here a letter
from Mr. Thomas Poynton, a resident of Hokianga, which was
sent to the “ Australian” newspaper of Sydney, giving an account
of the reception and treatment of the bishop when he arrived in
New Zealand. This letter exhibits a protestant minister in a no
very enviable light Our Saviour said to his disciples, “ I send
you as sheep amongst wolves,” but the Rev. Mr. Turner mentioned
in this account, termed a preacher on the river, acted rather the
part of the wolf, and stirred up the natives by saying the
catholic church was idolatrous, and Frenchmen were murderers, to
prevent the bishop from landing. Is this the “ peace and good-
will” so strongly inculcated by the founder of Christianity ? and
what a demoralising effect such conduct must have on the minds
of the poor savage natives in regard to Christianity.
CORRESPONDENCE.
Catholic Mission in New Zealand.
{To the Editor of the Australian.)
Sir.—As a correct account of the reception and treatment of
the Right Rev. Dr. Pompalier at New Zealand, may be


interesting to some of your readers, I send you the following
straightforward statement from Mr. Thomas Poynton, a resident
of Hokianga.—Yours, &c.,
A “SUBSCRIBER.”
On the arrival of the Right Rev. Dr. Pompalier in Hokianga,
that Right Rev. Prelate met with great opposition from a Mr.
Turner, a preacher, stationed on the river. Mr. Turner was not
contented with preaching against the catholic religion and its
ministers on Sundays, and laying it down as black and idolatrous
as his eloquence could paint —but he must carry his malice
further. He represented to the natives that the bishop and his
priest could be no good as they were Frenchmen; that all from
their country were murderers, and if they were allowed to stoj)
in New Zealand, in course of time Dr. Pompalier would burn
them, tie the natives to a stake if they did not adhere to the
catholic religion. On the 17th day of January Mr. Turner sent
about fifty natives to my house, to force the catholic bishop from
this river; they demanded to see the bishop—the bishop
came out accordingly ; they spoke to me, as the bishop did not
understand them; they ordered him from New Zealand, and
demanded his wooden gods that they might throw them into
the tide.
It was time for me then to speak, when I saw they were
determined to do something which was not just; but I soon
convinced them that the best thing they could do was not to
meddle with me or the catholic ministers; they thought so
themselves and were soon satisfied, but told me that it was Mr.
Turner who sent them or they should not have come to trouble
the bishop or his priest—but that I knew what Mr. Turner’s
intentions were towards the catholic missionaries, and advised me
to take such means as lay in my power to prevent Mr. Turner
from sending them by native force from Hokianga.
I went down to Mr. Turner on that same day, to know by
what right or by what authority he should send a party of
natives to my place, to interrupt any person that might be there;
he, Mr. Turner, denied having sent the natives, but told me he
would oppose the catholic religion and its clergy as far as talk
would go —but would not advise insult or persecution.
I represented to Mr. Turner what he might expect from the
just indignation of forty or fifty British catholics if he persisted
in persecuting the minister of their church ; that we, as catholics,
were allowed the free exercise of our religion in Great Britain
131


and Ireland, and should be so in a free and independent country
I reminded him of the ill-advised plans to the natives, which
caused them to slaughter one another. Not many months back
I was an eye witness, as were ten Englishmen, to the complete
slaughter of sixteen or eighteen natives, by what they style
Christian natives. I told Turner, that if he commenced such
work it would not be easy to put a stop to it: that I had the
Europeans on my side, who were a match for what natives he
could muster, not to mention the natives that would take our
part, and that would be the greatest number. I moreover told
him I would make an appeal to the protestants on the river and
at the Bay of Islands to judge his conduct in persecuting two
men who never wronged him, and were strangers alike to his
language and the language of the natives, that they were alike
incapable of defending themselves in the English or New
Zealand language.
I advised peace and good will, as it would be the only way
to benefit the natives. This was the purpose for which the
catholic missionaries seemed to have been sent from home, and
not to raise dissensions and quarrels that might terminate in their
destruction, and cause a good deal of bloodshed on both sides.
Mr. Turner told me that all the blame should be to me, for he
was informed that I was the cause of the catholic clergy coming
to New Zealand. That he and his family were safe —that
Catholicism was the worst of all religions, and particularly in New
Zealand, as it had great attractions for the natives; that he was
well aware the poor natives would be allured over to that
religion by the splendour of their church and vestments—that it
suited them. “ But, Boynton,” he said, addressing me, “ you know
we call all those who adhere to the Roman catholic religion,
idolaters.” “Well,” I said, “there is no cause of quarrel on that point,
for you know we are not idolaters, but you are heretics ” —so we
separated with a good understanding. Of course he was
determined to drive the bishop and his priest out of New
Zealand, and I was determined to keep them or perish in the
attempt. I made an appeal to all the respectable protestants on
the Hokianga River, and to most of them at the Bay of Islands,
to know if they would sanction or allow Turner to carry on his
persecution against the Catholic Bishop, and to their credit they
said, to a man, that they would be the first to oppose Turner,
and protect the bishop with their lives, and observed it was a
good thing' that the catholic missionaries came; that it might
cause the others to mind that for which they left home, for most
of them forgot what they were before they came to New


Zealand, or for what purpose they arrived there. The bihle was
now only used as a mask for traffic ; and our poor, meek, and
humble English missionary is soon transformed into a complete
New Zealand merchant, with the addition of the ignorant pride
of a county magistrate. Their conduct but ill suits the purpose
for which they have been sent out —and they call themselves
Apostles of the Gospel. Oh how different from the first Apostles
of Christ’s church ! Here they have their wives and children,
their cows, and horses, their houses and land, and live in the
greatest plenty. This was a general remark.
But to resume—there was not a chief in Hokianga of any
consequence with whom Turner did not use his influence to see if
they would drive the Catholic Bishop from New Zealand, but all
to no purpose. Some would have nothing to do with it; and they
that would, were afraid or over-ruled by those possessed of more
power than themselves. There remained one more chance to he
tried by Turner. This was a very influential chief who was
from home, and Turner made no doubt when this man came
back that he would execute his purpose. This man came back ;
Turner spoke to him to put the catholic bishop from New
Zealand, but to his utmost surprise he made him this
answer;—“ No, I will not, do it yourself, if you think you can,
and if you think the white men will allow you ; as for me I will
have nothing to do quarrelling with the white men, I never did
nor will I now; ” so ended this much loved persecution. Turner
is at great pains to disown having spoken to the natives, to put
away the bishop ; but the natives prove it to his face, that he sent
them to my house to drive the bishop and priest from New Zealand
and to break their service for the altar. The catholics during
this dispute behaved with good conduct and prudence; they came
every Sunday with their families to mass. Those catholics who
lived with native women have all got married and had their
wives and children baptized; the natives are quite surprised
to see so many white men going to mass, when none go to
Turner’s preaching—men to whom the missionaries gave the
name of devils ; when the natives would ask, what was the
reason they never came to hear him preach, he would say that
they had no religion, that they were devils ; but now the natives
see that those devils, as they were called, have a religion and
attend to the same.
The natives seeing so many white men go to mass on
Sunday, and none, with the exception of two or three at most, go
to the preaching of Turner, conclude that the catholic religion
is the right one; and, many of the chiefs said to me that
133


only for being baptized in the Wesleyan church, they would be
catholics ; that they are ashamed to turn from it now, but that
they can see that Turner wanted to drive the bishop from New
Zealand for fear that they would all turn to him.
The bishop went to Weddenacey, situated about fourteen
miles from my place on the River Hokianga (the natives on this
river never would listen to Turner’s teaching) I spoke to some
catholics to go with the bishop, which they did in three boats;
this was another insight to the natives ; when we arrived at the
settlement and the bishop went on shore, their first exclamation
was, “ Oh! that is the right missionary and he looks like the right
one, we will have him and listen to him.” I was on the spot
when these words were spoken; we stopped all night, and the
next morning when the bishop put on his vestments to read mass,
I never before witnessed such surprise : they all consented to be
of his flock. On an other river called Ollani, they also wish to
belong to the catholic faith ; twelve or fourteen of the principal
men of that river were at mass at my house several times.
This week the bishop was sent for by two of the most
powerful chiefs of the Hokianga, they and their people are about
to embrace the catholic faith. There is another tribe called
Isutiyes, the best part of the men attend every Sunday. I trust in
God before many months expire, that we will have more catholic
natives on this river than what the Wesleyans will have, as all
those natives that have not turned to the Wesleyan preachers are
determined to embrace our religion.
His Lordship has got on well in learning the English
language since his arrival in this country ; so much so that he
can hear confessions; he labours hard in learning the English and
New Zealand languages; the latter comes easy to him to
articulate and he will not be long in learning it; sometimes he is
up the most part of the night and very often all night; he has a
great deal to do; but he is fit to accomplish it, he is just the man
for it. Oh ! what a blessing for all to have such a man, so meek,
so humble, and devout, he is a saintly man—may the great God
grant him health and long life to accomplish his great undertaking.
(Signed) Thomas Poynton.
Hokianga, March 12th, 1838.”
The following is an account of a public meeting of the
members of the Roman catholic church in Sydney. It appeared
in the Australian of July 31st, 1838.


At the close of the service at St. Mary’s Cathedral on Sunday
last, a public meeting took place, to take into consideration the
best means of dispelling an error induced by a portion of the
speech of His Honor Mr. Justice Willis, delivered at a meeting of
the Diocesan Committee at the Old Court House, Castlereagh-
street, on Thursday, 19th inst., in which that gentleman attributed
to the Roman catholic community “ idolatrous worship, and that
they had departed from the pure Apostolic Faith.”
His Lordship the Bishop took the chair and was supported
by the Roman Catholic Clergy, who took their seats on either side
on the platform. The chapel was crowded by the laity, and on
the business of the meeting being opened, the bishop delivered
the following address, premising that it might be remarked that
several leading members of the lay community did not take
an active part in the proceedings of this meeting. The reasons
were so obvious and need not be specified, the meeting might be
assured that they felt equally pained and aggrieved by reason of
the slander thrown upon their religion with any individuals
present.
The Pastoral Address of John Bede, by Divine Providence ,
Bishop and Vicar-Apostolic of Peiv South Wales and Van
Pieman’s Land, to his beloved in Jesus Christ—the Rev. Clergy
and Laity of Sydney and its vicinity.
St. Paul has forewarned us that men will arise, speaking
vain things, and the Royal Prophet in prophetic vision
contemplating the spiritual kingdom of Jesus Christ and its
assailants exclaims “ How have the nations raged and people
meditated vain things against the Lord, and against his
anointed ? ” —Psalm 2. In every age, in every place, the church
has experienced these predicted trials; and we could not expect
that our Holy Faith would be planted unassailed and unmaligned
within the limits of our jurisdiction in exception to the general
law, Accordingly we have had proof that ridicule and
misinterpretation are the portion of the people of God. For
party purposes the tenets of our religion have been made the
topic of unjust comment unceasingly. It was vainly imagined
we should become like unto those who thus slandered us. They
have done these things and we are silent. We sought after peace
and followed her paths, for we knew they were filled wdth
pleasantness.


But, my beloved brethren in Jesus Christ, circumstances have
recently occurred which compel us to depart from the silent
unobtrusive course which we deemed most fitting our sacred
ministry. Our blessed Redeemer endured all in silence till His
Eternal Father’s name was used by one high in station for party
purposes. And St. Paul, who prescribes patience and long-
suffering, rebuked severely Elymas, who tried to pervert the
right ways of the Lord in the court of Sergius the Proconsul. In
like manner we cannot permit calumnious expressions, which,
proceeding from the pen or lips of ordinary men, might pass by,
to escape unnoticed and uncensured, when they come forth to the
world impressed with a weight of authority, in itself entitled to
the deepest respect. Our worship has been represented to the
public as idolatrous by Mr. Justice Willis. A grave charge this !
If true, it sweeps away from the fold of Christianity a large
proportion of the inhabitants of this colony, and with them four-
fifths of the Christian world. Such an accusation is in itself so
far beyond credibility that we might leave it, as we before
observed, unnoticed, had it not been stated that it proceeded
from a high source. We ourselves could not credit the report.
Our sincere respect for the individual implicated, and regard for
our beloved flock unjustly maligned, induced us to write to Mr.
Justice Willis, requesting to be informed whether the expressions
imputed to him were correctly reported or not; to this request
we received a reply by no means satisfactory.
One from whose breast the reverential love of truth ought
to scare away every unseemly prejudice; from whose lips no
words unseasoned by discretion ought to proceed, has volunteered
the conviction that our worship is “ idolatrous.” Have we not
reason to feel aggrieved ?
But since this charge of idolatrous worship has been brought
against our holy religion, we deem ourselves called upon suc-
cinctly to expound those doctrines of the church which ignorance
or malice has usually selected to justify this most dreadful
imputation. We premise first, that we enter our solemn protest
against those who, differing from us in religious belief, arrogate
to themselves a claim to interpret our doctrines. “ Every church,”
says a well-known protestant author, is the properest judge of
its own doctrines and government.” Secondly, we declare that
God alone is the end of all religious worship. The catholic church
holds, as the foundation of all religion, that our first duty is to
believe that God is the Creator and Lord of all things, and to
love Him with all the feelings and faculties of our souls; to


prostrate before Him all our mental and corporal powers; at-
taching ourselves to Him by a continued service of faith, of
confidence and of love; for He is the source of all good.
Opposed to this duty is idolatrous worship, which consists in
giving to any creature whatsoever that supreme adoration, honor,
or worship which is due only to Almighty God.
Idolatrous worship consequently, as being opposed to the
first duty of man, the catholic church teaches to be one of the
greatest crimes which can be committed against the majesty of
the one eternal God; and every sincere Christian must feel
grievously injured by an imputation alike destructive of his
faith and of his hope.
For the catholic church moreover teaches that the fruition
of God and the remission of sin are not attainable otherwise than
in and by the merits of Jesus Christ, who, being God, became
man, suffered and died in his human nature for the salvation’ of
all mankind; that through his merits, gratuitously purchased for
us, all may be saved; and that there is no other name under
heaven given to men, in which salvation may be obtained. All
spiritual graces in this life, all happiness hereafter, must come to
us through the merits of Jesus Christ.
To God alone, therefore, do we offer the tribute of our supreme
homage; in Jesus Christ alone, His blessed Son, do we rest the
hope of our salvation.
In contradiction to these our doctrines it is said, we adore
the elements of bread and wine in the mass —that we adore the
Virgin Mary—that we worship the saints and images of Christ
and of the saints. In the mass we believe that after the
consecration, the substance of bread and wine is no longer present,
but only the appearances. In the mass we do offer supreme
adoration to Jesus Christ, the son of God, whom we believe to be
truly, really, and substantially present, under the appearances
only of bread and wine. Not indeed present according to that
sensible manner and visible form of existence which He once
assumed for our salvation, but after a spiritualized manner and
in a sacramental form, not exposed to the senses nor to corporeal
contingencies. Even as we believe the divine nature to have
been truly present in Jesus Christ whilst He was visible on earth,
though concealed, so in this. His sacramental form of existence,
we believe Him to be truly present. The divine and human nature
being alike concealed, and their presence being known to us by
His own unerring word, which is the direct testimony of God.
We adore, therefore, the Saviour in the mass, as we would have
adored Him in the stable of Bethlehem under the form of an


infant, or on Calvary under the appearance of a criminal dying
upon a cross; relying on the testimony of God manifested to us
by prophecy and miracles. In the mass we adore Jesus Christ,
whom we believe to be present —whom we acknowledge to be
truly God, the legitimate object of supreme adoration and love.
The reality of the presence of Jesus Christ in the holy Eucharist
may form a subject of theological discussion. The adoration of J esus
Christ in the holy Eucharist is a necessary consequence of a belief
in the reality of that presence. And we hold we have an equal
right to draw our own conclusions from the words of sacred
scripture, in favour of the real presence, with those who deny it.
They maintain a right of judging for themselves ; this right we
also maintain.
Before we proceed to answer the other objections, it will be
proper to remark to you, that the words—worship, honour,
adoration, with several others, are terms in themselves relative
and ambiguous, varying in their sense according to the nature
of the object to which the act, by the term expressed, is directed,
and according to the intention of him by whom they are used.
(Compare Prov. v., 9, and Exod. xx., 12, Deu. xxviii., 47 and 48).
In scripture we are commanded to honour God and to honour the
king ; children are commanded to honour their parents. Is it to
be supposed that the honour due to the king or to parents is the
same we owe to God ? To God we owe supreme and sovereign
honour, in which no created being can have any part. To the
king we owe the highest civil honour. To parents children owe
the honour of filial respect and obedience. Thus the words
adoration, and worship, are used in the ancient liturgies to signify
supreme homage, and also affection and respect. How frequently
is the former word to be met with in this sense in the language
of poetry, or of excited feeling. The latter, with perfect inno-
cence, may be used in the same sentence in reference to God and
to man. Thus, in the first book of Chronicles, chap. 29, v. 20.
And all the congregation blessed the Lord God of their fathers,
and bowed down their heads and “ worshipped the Lord and the
king.” Here evidently the word worship is used to signify
supreme homage to God and inferior worship to the king.
Seeing, therefore, that these terms are in themselves ambi-
guous, and that their sense is determined by the intention of the
person by whom they are employed, surely, no arguments can
be more unfair than those derived from the use of terms merely
relative, and construed in a sense disavowed by those against
whom such arguments are brought.


We therefore declare the faith, which we have been taught*
from our infancy, when we state that we do not adore, nor
worship, nor honour with the supreme adoration—worship and
honour due only to God—no other than the one, living, true, and
eternal God ; the Creator of all things. Whatever may be the
terms employed, we do not intend to express more than an honour
and respect infinitely inferior in kind , and infinitely inferior
in degree to this supreme homage. The honour we have in
reference to the Blessed Virgin and the saints is precisely the
same in kind with the respect and honour we would pay to our
fellotv creatures on earth, whom we deemed worthy of respect
and honour.
How unjust, therefore, to say that we offer idolatrous worship
to the Blessed Virgin and the saints ! In like manner we renounce
all divine worship and adoration of images and pictures, since we
worship and adore God alone. Pictures, nevertheless, and especially
the image of our crucified Redeemer, may be placed in our churches,
to recall our wandering thoughts and to inflame our affections.
What Christian can contemplate the image of his dying Saviour
without veneration ? It is a book to the unlearned; the Cross
was the book of St. Paul, from which he derived his knowledge.
We venerate the cross, as a son respects the image of his father
—a parent the picture of his child —a friend that of a friend.
To condemn the feeling which prompts this would be to condemn
the finest feelings of our nature. It is manifestly unjust to stig-
matize this veneration as idolatrous worship. Neither do we
adore the saints. We believe in the communion of saints; that
the church triumphant in heaven is one in Christ with the church
militant on earth ; that although faith and hope are absorbed in
the vision and fruition of God, charity never faileth. Hence we
believe that the blessed, who have died in the Lord, pray for us,
their fellow-members on earth, and that they rejoice in the con-
version of the sinner. We believe that the departed parents,
when happy with God, may pray for their children, even as the
parent did pray whilst on earth. We believe that God may be
favourably inclined to hear the petitions made by them in our
behalf; therefore we believe that it is good and profitable (not
necessary) to desire their prayers. Can this manner of communi-
cation and invocation be more injurious to the merits and triumph
of Christ, our only Mediator of Redemption, than it is for one
Christian to beg the prayers of another ? Above all, can this be
deemed idolatrous worship ?
Should anyone demand a more explicit declaration against
this most anti-Christian accusation ? We most solemnly pronounce


anathema against him who commits idolatry, who prays to images,
or worships them as gods. Anathema to him who believes the
Blessed Virgin to be more than a creature ; who puts his trust in
her more than in God. Anathema to the man who gives divine
honour to any created thing, whether in heaven above or in the
earth beneath, or who adores as God any but the one true and
living God, to whom be honour and glory for ever and ever.
Amen.
At the close of the address his lordship said that having now
touched upon the leading points of their faith, as connected with
Mr. Willis’s allusion, he would proceed to the business of the
meeting, and he had to express his deep regret that he was called
upon thus publicly to acknowledge how much they felt aggrieved
at the unfounded and illiberal charge made against the Roman
catholic community generally by Mr. Justice Willis.
The Rev. Mr. Lovat then said, that to bring into effect the
real purposes of the meeting, he had been induced to move the
hrst resolution, and then proceeded to state; —That valuing peace
as the greatest of all temporal blessings, and believing its pre-
servation to be a sacred duty, we have studiously avoided giving
cause of offence to any upon the subject of religion, which was
given to man to be a bond of union with his fellow-man. For
the same reason, when our doctrines have been impugned and
misrepresented, we have not answered railing for railing, and we
fearlessly appeal, in proof of this assertion, not only to the
authorities of the colony, but also to our brethren of every
religious denomination. We deem it criminal to bear false testi-
mony against our neighbour; and we consider, to charge any
body of Christians with doctrines disavowed by them, is a false
testimony—it is a calumny increasing in guilt in proportion to
the numbers maligned and to the odiousness of the doctrines
imputed. We consider that the charge of idolatrous worship
against any body of Christians is most odious, for it strikes at the
very root of their faith and of their hope ; it ranks them amongst
the heathen; their acknowledgement of the sole dependence on
one God, the creator of all things, is denied; their trust in one
mediator between God and man, our blessed Lord and Saviour
Jesus Christ is declared to be a lie ; their fitness for civilised life,
which, as the experience of past ages proves, can only rest on
these primary doctrines, is questioned. Moreover, this charge of
idolatrous worship, first brought against the catholic church for
the purpose of misleading the ignorant, and since resorted to for
the purpose of exciting party feeling and prejudice, has been dis-
tinctly and repeatedly shown to have no foundation whatsoever
in our belief nor our practice.


The resolution was seconded by Mr. Adam Wilson.
The bishop re-read the resolution, and stated if any persons
had objections to make, they were invited to stand forward and
make them The resolution was then put to the meeting, and
carried unanimously by the show of hands.
The Reverend Mr. McEncroe rose and said—lt was with
deep regret he felt called upon to allude in public to an estimable
and highly respectable personage, but his duty imperatively
impelled him to do so, and his public duty must supersede all
feelings of delicacy which he might have on the subject. These
must give way to the solemn charge laid upon him, and for which
he should have to account when standing before that highest of
tribunals, before which all would be called to account. He
admitted the right of every person to pursue his own course of
salvation, and to declare his belief or disbelief in particular
doctrines ; but in declaring his opinions he was not allowed to
bear false witness against his neighbour. Any one had a right
to state what he believed to be true, but he should arm himself
with reasons and with facts —he should acquaint himself with
the belief and practice, before he presumed to attack the doctrine
of his neighbour : and above all he should not carelessly asperse
any doctrine upon hearsay: he should not misrepresent and insult
a large portion of his Christian brethren who happened to differ
from him in faith, without being fully prepared to answer for his
assertions. If he had wished to attack the tenets of the Roman
catholic church, he should have done so fairly and honestly, and
not by giving expression to what was not catholic doctrine.
Before making such unwarrantable assertions, he should have
consulted the formulae of the doctrine of their faith; the ex-
pressed and written explanations and decrees of her prelates. If
he had done so, and had expressed his dissent from doctrines
correctly understood, no person could have censured his disagree-
ment with the Roman catholic doctrines, nor with the candid
expression of his disbelief. But if, on the contrary, he asserted
what the catholic faith expressly denied—that which had been
frequently attributed to it, and had as frequently been denied
with abhorrence —then it became the duty, the urgent duty, not
only of the clergy, but of the laity of that community, to assert
their detestations of such calumnies, and publicly to disavow a
participation in such doctrines. It was with the most painful
feelings that he was called on to denounce the assertion of so
exalted and influential an individual; but he was bound to his
God and to his flock to state aloud that the Roman catholics
abhorred idolatry, and he could not sufficiently express his horror


of the accusation. It was culpable to rob, to commit various
offences which were amenable to the law; hut the charge now
brought against the whole Roman catholic people was ten thou-
sand times worse than highway robbery, or any charge which
could be brought against man. They were charged with robbing
the Almighty of the honour due to Him alone; and it was not to
be wondered that they felt indignant at the accusation of giving
glory to the creature, which was alone due to the Creator. The
slightest tinge—the shadow “of idolatrous worship,” essentially
corrupts and destroys the purity and singleness of divine worship
of the “ One only true God;” for “ the Lord is a jealous God,” &c.,
“He will not bear a rival,” —“ He will not accept a divided heart,”
—“ He will not give His heart to another,” —“ no one can serve
two masters,” —“ there is no union between light and darkness,”
—“ there can be no union between God and Belial.” Hence, if
the Roman catholic worship be in any way “ idolatrous,” catholics
are cut off from the true worship of the Living God in this
world, and they can have no hope of mercy or glory in the world
to come —an awful conclusion! and one forced on us by the
astounding words of Mr Justice Willis. It was really painful for
him to be forced to express himself in uncourteous and strong
language; but standing as he did as the senior chaplain of the
Roman catholic persuasion now in the colony, and having ex-
tended and great experience as a priest, he could not help
rebutting the calumny which had either wantonly or ignorantly
been thrown on their community.
He had been acquainted with catholics from South and North
America, from the East and West Indies, from France, Germany,
Spain and Italy, and he had never met with the idolatry imputed
to the Roman catholics by Mr. Justice Willis. He could not find
any excuse for such a cruel charge, which had every appearance
of being thrown out to excite a prejudice against a large body of
Christians, who were in every respect as devout and as well-
conducted as any other body of religionists. To be accused of
idolatry was a charge which no unprejudiced mind could believe
against them, and which was not only uncharitable but untrue.
It was with pain he had stated so much, but it was his duty to
maintain the tenets of his church, and to contradict that which
had not the slightest foundation in fact or doctrine. He begged
leave to propose the second resolution, which was—“ That this
meeting cannot express in terms sufficiently strong its sense of
the conduct of Mr. Justice Willis, who at a public meeting has
declared that Roman catholics, by reason of their idolatrous wor-
ship, have departed from, or greatly erred in, the pure apostolic


faith; an assertion containing a wanton and unprovoked insult,
imputing to a large proportion of his fellow-citizens and inhabit-
ants of this colony a practical doctrine which they hold in the
utmost abhorrence. And that this declaration on the part of
Mr. Justice Willis is uncalled for by reason of the circumstances
of the meeting, and calculated to enkindle the flames of religious
discord in this colony, being direct evidence that in his estimation
we possess neither a moral nor a Christian character. We, the
Roman catholics of Sydney and the colony at large, do hereby
declare we can have no longer esteem for nor confidence in him.”
The resolution was seconded by Mr. R. Murphy, and was
carried without dissent.
The Rev. Mr. McEncroe said that inmoving the third resolution,
on the part of the Rev. H. G. Gregory, who was absent from the
meeting, he must observe that it had been declared that many
protestant gentlemen had expressed themselves equally indignant
at the unjust and uncharitable aspersions thrown out against the
Roman catholics, and that many of them would have attended
the meeting, but that it was called in the name of the catholics
only. It was very gratifying to him to state that many protestant
gentlemen, with the kindest feelings, had come forward and con-
tributed to the erection of temples for the worship of the only
true God; and he thought it was a duty they owed to those
gentlemen to rebut the presumption that they had contributed to
the support of “idolatrous worship,” which, if allowed to pass
unheeded and uncontradicted, would indirectly attribute to them
a culpability they deserved not. In justice and in gratitude to
those gentlemen, who must truly have appreciated the doctrines
of the catholic church, differing as it did in some points from their
own, he was happy to propose the following resolution on the
part of his brother-clergyman, the Rev. Mr. Gregory;—“ That
among the motives for this expression of our abhorrence of the
imputed idolatry, not the least is our desire to rescue from so
gross a calumny our respected protestant brethren who have so
liberally and so generously contributed to the erection of this and
other temples to be dedicated, not to the service of idols, but to
the worship, in spirit and in truth, of the living God.”
The resolution was seconded by Dr. Burke and carried
unanimously.
It was then moved by the Rev. Mr. Murphy, and seconded
by Mr. A. Ennis—“ That a copy of these resolutions be presented
to His Excellency the Governor, with a request that they might
be transmitted to the Right Honourable the Secretary of State.”
Carried unanimously.


Mr. Adam Wilson moved that the Bishop should leave, and
that the Rev. Mr. Murphy should take the chair.
The Rev. Mr. Lovat moved—“ That the thanks of this
meeting be given to our reverend bishop for his zealous and
dignified conduct, and for the honour he has done us in the chair
while presiding over this meeting.” The resolution was seconded
by Captain Carter, and carried unanimously.
The bishop then addressed the meeting, and said, that the
proceedings of one of the most painful days of his existence had
nearly come to a conclusion. They had been obliged to lay aside
for a short space the unobtrusive and humble course they had
always followed, to bring to the test of truth, what, if true,
would debase them below the heathen nations, and render them a
reproach to the name of Christians. They had met, and he
hoped by their unqualified denial of the odious charge made
against them, they had removed from the mind of their brother
Christians the odium which the indiscreet avowal of a gentleman
high in office, attached to them. Having done so, it was now
their duty to fall back into their wonted course of quietude and
charity. It rested with them to show to their opponents the real
beauty of religion by the purity of their lives, and he earnestly
prayed his flock to preserve and cherish feelings of peace and
good will towards their brethren, of whatever denomination,
regardless of the calumnies which might be thrown upon them,
either by unkind or ignorant persons. These would in the end
meet their own refutation, and recoil upon their propagators. He
entreated them to remember that whatever difference existed in
the forms of religion, there was one great commandment given
to all, —that they should love one another like brethren—and
this they were bound to obey, however others neglected it. With
these words, he would dismiss them in peace.
The meeting was conducted throughout with the most
perfect order, not a word being uttered, except by the speakers,
from the beginning to the end ; and the bishop having given his
benediction, the meeting broke up as if nothing uncommon had
occurred.
This meeting was by no means uncalled for, it was necessary
in order to dispel from the minds of protestants the revolting
prejudice, that catholics were guilty of idolatrous worship.
Indeed, this branch of the church catholic would have been
unworthy of the Faith had they not repelled with indignation
such an odious charge made by one of the judges of the land;
and it would seem that those who were present at the protestant
meeting (Bishop Broughton was in the chair) shared in the


sentiments of Judge Willis; for not one rose to contradict his
calumnious assertion; and the most influential members of the
Church of England were at the meeting. The editor of the
Government Gazette, in commenting on the meeting, stated that
nine-tenths of the Church of England colonists “ cordially
acquiesced in the opinions of Judge Willis.”
At this time the leading members of the Church of England,
with some honourable exceptions, seemed to be highly incensed
against the wise and liberal measure of the Church Act, introduced
by Sir Richard Bourke, by which the Church of England in the
colonies lost its ascendancy, and the lion’s share of allowances.
The progress which the catholic church had made in the
colony in such a short time, by the devotion and zeal of the
bishop and clergy, alarmed the illiberals. They were disposed to
resort to every means in their power to repress catholicitj T and
prevent its advancement; but “magna est veritas et prevalebit”—
St. Aug. A sure index of the rabid party feeling towards the
Roman catholics may be found in the remarks which appeared in
a public print at that time. When the ship “ Cecilia ” arrived, in
July, 1838, the following were the observations of the Government
Gazette : —“ The ‘ Cecilia,’ from London, has brought us eight
additional Irish Roman catholic priests, being the first fruits of
Dr. Ullathorne’s pamphlet, at a cost to the colony, which he has
calumniated and injured, to the extent of only £I2OO ! We
expect shortly to see the colony swarming with these adventurous
spirits, if, as in the present instance, our emigration fund is to be
taxed with the payment of £l5O to each priest for the purpose
of defraying the expense of his passage and to give the gentleman
an outfit—a system of robbery of which we shall say more on an
early day.” How contemptibly this scribe writes of the catholic
clergy ; to him the. introduction of learned, pious, and zealous
ecclesiastics—to instruct and improve the morals of the people—
was no benefit, and the statement was made as if the catholics
monopolised the provisions of Sir Richard Bourke’s Church Act.
In regard to Dr. Ullathorne’s pamphlet, by which, this writer
states, the colony was “ calumniated and injured,” I need only cite
the words of a liberal and intelligent cotemporary journal,
wherein the editor writes that there is “ not the slightest
indication of that mains animus —of that personal vindictiveness,
of that acerbity of temper which characterize the works of our
other colonial slanderers. It breathes throughout rather a spirit
of compassion for the religiously neglected prison population of
his own, the R.C. community, and a feeling of sympathy for
human suffering.”
L


The meeting at which Judge Willis made the false charges
was inaugurated by a dinner; here all the members of the
Diocesan Committee were present, including Bishop Broughton,
and Alexander Macleay, Esq., the Colonial Secretary, was in the
chair. The second toast proposed by the chairman was “The
Church and State,” which he prefaced by saying it was rather a
delicate toast, but one which he was assured would be well
received. He might well say “ delicate,” because by the Church
Act the connection between the State and the Church, by law
established in the colony, was slender indeed, if not completely
severed.
It was in consequence of the persistent opposition of Bishop
Broughton and his party that the system of general education
proposed by Governor Bourke was not introduced into tire
colony. They thought such a system of education too liberal in
its object and unfavourable to protestantism. No doubt Bishop
Broughton reasoned justly in favour of the denominational
system when he wrote, “He was persuaded that the artificial
substitution of a day for inculcating religion, instead of its being
made always the subject of devout observation, will not
accomplish the object proposed any more than in nature
occasional irrigation could compensate for the failure of the rain
and dew of heaven.” They would only consent to the protestant
catechism being taught in the schools ; the public school system
seemed to this party to favour the efforts of the Church of Rome.
The liberal-minded and enlightened protestants accorded no
approbation to the bigotry, prejudice, and religious rancour of
these zealots. Sir John Jamieson, who was a man of cultured
mind, a liberal and enlightened politician, in writing to a friend
on the other side of the equator, states: —“ At present the
population of this colony is disturbed by religious controversy.
Our Governor, Sir Richard Bourke, an enlightened and liberal
man, is anxious to establish such a national system of education
as would be most desirable to allay the prejudices of religious
sects and most important in regard to economy in this thinly-
peopled country. Against this our bishop has exerted all his
influence with his numerous Tory friends to oppose the Governor’s
effecting his wishes, and keep up a system of exclusion. Thus
the seeds of religious discord have been sown amongst us and
destroyed the unanimity which for years bound the bulk of the
colonists together.”
There appeared at the time in a liberal and well-conductcd
protestant journal the following remarks: —“ Our anti-popery
alarmists have done most serious injury They


have been the first to sow the seeds of religious discord in our
churches and in our society To them alone
belongs the guilt; their bigotry alone has been the means of
stopping the spread of universal education. The means which
have been resorted to are worthy of the end for which they have
been employed. Not content with imputing to Roman catholics
doctrines they abjure and purposes they abhor, some of our
protestant zealots have heaped calumny upon calumny on the
heads of the most virtuous and distinguished members of their
own faith, whose measures they laboured to contravene.”
It will be instructive and interesting to take a glance at the
political movements going on in the colony about this time.
There were two questions agitating the minds of the people the
solution of which in after years may be said to have changed
the destiny of the colony. The first question was, whether it
would not be expedient to get transportation abolished; and the
second, the natural outcome of the other, “ ought not the colony
to have representative government.” In regard to the question
of transportation, there existed a great difference of opinion.
The home Government was decidedly averse to a change, because
the colony was a very convenient and distant place to absorb
the prison population of Great Britain; and the would-be
autocrats who possessed large tracks of land in the colony, includ-
ing the squatter, supported the transportation scheme, it being
favourable to their interests; To do away with the prison
population would be, they said, the death-blow to agriculture,
and the money market would be shaken to its centre. It would
involve the country in a colonial national debt, as a loan would
have to be contracted, and the colony would be responsible for
both principal and interest. They said the prosperity of the
colony was bound up with the transportation system. The
opponents to this view maintained that so long as the colony was
a penal settlement, it was impossible for it to be prosperous and
glorious in comparison to the other nations ; it was like a leprosy
which excluded her from the society of the world.
The agitators for a representative government asserted that,
according to the law of nations, “ every community had a right to
govern itself; ” that the prison population were vastly in the
minority; that free immigrants were pouring in on our shores in
great numbers every year ; and that the colony could no longer
be considered a penal colony, but must be considered a commercial
dependency of Great Britain. There were only 20,000 prisoners
and why should the free inhabitants, amounting to 80,000, be
subjected to the arbitrary rule of a penal settlement ? Having


a representative Government they could, with the approval of
the Crown, make their own laws, tax themselves, and appoint
competent officers to the State. How the colonists obtained
their object I will briefly give an account of in another page.
CHAPTER V
The return of the Vicar-General, Dr. Ullathorne, to the colony
with three priests, three ecclesiastical students, and five
sisters of charity, December 31, 1838. —Great meeting of the
Catholics in St. Mary’s Cathedral, presided over by Bishop
Polding. — Dr. Ullathorne’s speech, giving an account of his
travels in Europe.—The Sisters of Charity, their work, and
the origin of their coming to the colony.—The able and
statesman-like letter of Sir Richard Bourke in reply to the
Bishop of Exeter, Dr. Philpotts, of Exeter Hall notoriety.
Now to return to ecclesiastical affairs. Dr. Ullathorne, after
an absence of about two years and a half, returned to the colony.
He brought with him the first nuns, Sisters of Charity, who ever
landed in the colonies. In the Australian newspaper of Tuesday,
January 1, appeared the following announcement: —“ December
31, 1838—Arrived, The “ Francis Spaight Sayers, master, with
merchandize. Left London August 23. Passengers: The Rev.
Dr. Ullathorne, Roman Catholic Vicar-General; the Rev. Messrs.
P. B. Geogeghan, Richard Marum and Thomas Butler, Roman
Catholic clergymen ; Mrs. Cahil, Mrs. O’Brian, Mrs. Callen, Mrs.
De Lacy and Miss Williams, Sisters of Charity; Messrs. J.
Dunphy, P. Magennis and J. Grant, ecclesiastical students.”
The press at the time made the following remarks : —“ On
New Year’s Day High Mass was celebrated in St. Mary’s Cathe-
dral, when the newly-arrived priests and sisters of charity
attended at the altar. The cathedral was crowded to see the
installation of the priests, and, no doubt, partly from curiosity to
see the veiled sisters who have ventured so far from their homes
for the purpose of contributing to the religious instruction of
their fellow creatures.”
After Divine Service on Sunday, January 6, 1839, a meeting
of the Roman Catholics of Sydney was convened in the cathedral,
the Right Reverend Bishop in the chair. The principal object of
the meeting, as the resolutions indicate, was to raise funds for the
completion of the cathedral.


We know not when we were more agreeably gratified than
we were on entering this splendid structure, and in being present
during the service which preceded the meeting. The whole of
the roof had been completed. The grandeur and general appear-
ance were well supported by the delicate minuteness with which
the detail of ornament, peculiar to the style adopted, had been
carried out. And we beheld the Bishop standing before the altar,
under the canopy of an arch, beautiful in the simplicity of its
form, and enriched in a manner peculiarly striking and novel by
the introduction of stained glass into the ornamental spandrils,
surrounded by the ministers of religion in their various gradations.
The recently arrived priests made their obedience to the Right
Reverend Bishop, and were formally received into the number of
the clergy. The music was of the first order. We never heard
the celebrated Gloria of Mozart, No. 12, to greater advantage. ,A
most instructive discourse was delivered by the Reverend Mr.
Geoghegan, one of the clergy who lately arrived with Dr. Ulla-
thorne. The sisters of charity, we observed, occupied the first
bench in front of the altar.
The service being finished, the business of the meeting
commenced. The Bishop, having taken the chair, read the
following address :
“ John Bede, by the grace of God and the appointment of
the Holy See, Bishop, Yicar-Apostolic of New Holland and Van
Diernan’s Land, to the faithful of Sydney and its vicinity,
greeting:
“ Dearly beloved in Jesus Christ, —
“ Two years and a half have elapsed since we first invited
your co-operation and assistance in the completion of the structure
in which we are now assembled. Then the bareness and naked-
ness of the walls, its roof just sufficient to protect the altar and
the congregated multitude around it from the elements, its
generally desolate appearance by reason of its unfinished state,,
served as arguments most cogent and irresistible to influence you
to take up the sacred cause with vigorous generosity. Blessed be
God, that space of time has not elapsed unproductive of the effects-
we wished to see realized. The building, commenced by that
good pastor whom Providence selected to watch over and protect
his infant church in these counties, has now grown up by your
efforts into a structure, without and within, goodly and pleasant
to behold, well seeming to its noble purpose. Cast your eyes
around, survey the work of your hands, the result of your zeal.


and you will take part in the joy of Holy David, when, having
adorned, according to the extent of his means, the resting place
of the Tabernacle—the mere type or emblem of our church—he
exclaimed, ‘ Lord, how have I loved the beauty of Thy House and
the place of Thy habitation ? I will adore in Thy holy temple,
and I will praise Thy name.’ Not one amongst you now repines
for that his contribution has been large and frequent, not one has
been visited by distress in his own family because he has given
generously to the Lord.
“In referring to the means we used for the purpose of
regulating the donations of the faithful, so that the contributions
might flow in channels easy of access to all parties, it will be
recollected we instituted a society of persons who engaged to pay
a sixpence per week towards the completion of the cathedral, and
also of those who zealously engaged themselves to collect the
sums so contributed. Amidst the labours of our Ministry it was
gratifying, it was consoling to observe how energetically you
exerted yourselves to obtain the means of completing the material
structure which best might represent that spiritual edifice of
faith, and of hope, and of love to God and man, which, with our
beloved clergy, we were engaged in raising among you. In the
lapse of time, however, various circumstances, as might be ex-
pected, have broken in upon the harmonious working of that
society, and have clogged proceedings ; so that, though the good-
will remains, the results of that good-will do not substantially
appear. The consequence is, the channels no longer bring in
their wonted contributions, the treasury from which the current
expenses were discharged has become entirely empty. We are
in debt. We think it right to state the fact in its plain simplicity.
Upwards of £2OOO have been paid to the contractors, Brodie and
Craig; several hundreds—the exact amount cannot yet be
ascertained—remain to be paid. We cannot proceed to complete
the cathedral unless our treasury be again replenished by the
contributions of the faithful,
“We require an immediate supply to meet the demands now
due ; we must provide for the future, so that the work may
proceed uninterruptedly to its completion, unencumbered by the
great evil of accumulated debt.
“ To effect the first of these purposes we propose that an
immediate subscription be commenced. Several gentlemen have
already signified their willingness, and have evinced their
sincerity by the payment of their subscription, others most
laudably have engaged to pay annually considerable sums until
the completion of the work. Thus encouraged we unhesitatingly


call upon all to contribute of their substance to this great work.
The Lord loves the cheerful giver ; and that which shall descend
into the general fund for erecting a temple to His name, which
shall in some sort be worthy of its object (like the waters which
have passed to the ocean, return from the clouds to the earth
with a fertilizing power) the divine blessing will again restore to
you with an hundredfold increase.
“ But this will not be sufficient. Who would not regret the
cessation of the work before completion ? Yet this must be the
case ; even the sanctuary, the place most solemnly consecrated to
the divine service, must remain in an unfinished state, unless we
have steady supplies on which we can safely calculate; and
these we do not doubt we shall have. To secure these supplies
we propose that a society shall be formed having for its object
the procuring of funds for the completion of the Cathedral This
society, like the former, to consist of those who will contribute
monthly at least one half crown to the funds, or a sixpence for
each member of the family ; and of others who will engage to
collect these sums from the faithful. We do not doubt, after the
proofs wo have received of the devotedness and zeal of very
many of our flock, that this association for the completion of
St. Mary’s Cathedral will accomplish the glorious object for
which it has been formed.
“ We cannot dismiss the subject which has principally urged
us to assemble you, before we have expressed our sincere heart-
felt gratitude to the author of all good for the unbounded mercies
he has been pleased to bestow’ upon us in the interval of time to
which we have alluded.
“ The mission of our beloved Vicar-General has been attended
with the most beneficial results His zeal, activity, and piety
have created an extensive sympathy in our favor. Zealous,
active, and pious laborers in the Lord’s vineyard have beheld our
w f ants, and have hastened to come to our succour. Our people
are no longer as sheep gone astray in the absence of pastors.
The cry of our little ones for bread—the bread of eternal life —
will not be in vain, there are those now who will brake it unto them.
The spirit of God hath filled with courage, not belonging to their
sex, excellent ladies, who, deeming all things of small account to
gaining souls to Christ, have, fearlessly traversing the ocean,
come amongst us to consummate their sacrifice of charity on these
shores in the abodes of sorrow and guilt. What return,
dearly beloved in Jesus Christ, shall we make to the Lord
for all he has done to us ? Shall we refuse to devote
a portion of our worldly substance to his service ? Impossible !


That part of the sacred edifice destined for the use of the
people we behold completed; now we are called upon to
adorn the sanctuary of our God, in which he loves to dwell with
the children of men. The donations we now request are more
directly consecrated to Him. Dearly beloved, on this auspicious
day, when we commemorate the oblations which were offered by
our forefathers in the faith—the wise men to the infant Saviour—
let us offer our gold as a testimony of our grateful homage unto
Him who has given us to enjoy in the light of the true faith all
its concomitant blessings. On this day when you behold,
encircling the naked unfinished sanctuary, those who, to
administer within its sacred precincts, have left all things—who
have given their very lives for you—let the munificence of your
present subscription, the energy of your future exertions in the
completion of the Cathedral of St. Mary prove that you
gratefully appreciate the sacrifice made by those apostolic men
for your sakes.
“ The Grace of God our Saviour be with you all. Amen.”
The Rev. Francis Murphy, in moving the first resolution,
expressed his conviction that a sum sufficient for the completion
of the cathedral, and for the liquidation of its present debt,
might easily be raised, if the labouring classes and the mechanics
would only unite with their wealthier brethren in contributing,
each according to his circumstances. Having resided for the last
ten years in Liverpool, England, he could bear testimony to the
extraordinary good which had been effected by the united
exertions of the labouring classes amongst the catholic body in
that town as well as in the neighbouring town of Manchester.
In Liverpool and its vicinity three splendid catholic churches
were erected, at an expense of upwards of twenty thousand
pounds, the greatest part of which was raised by the weekly
penny subscriptions of the poor, which amounted on an average
to the sum of twenty-five pounds. In Manchester, the weekly
subscriptions for the erection of a new church in that town
amounted, at the time of his departure from England, to the
sum of fifty pounds. He, therefore, was persuaded that if the
town of Sydney was divided into districts and collectors
appointed on a plan similar to that adopted by the catholics of
England, the result would prove what stupendous things may be
achieved by the united exertions of a whole congregation,,
animated with the Spirit of God, in love with the beauty of His
house, and the place where His glory dwells. Captain Carter
seconded the resolution, to the following effect That an asso-
ciation be this day formed, entitled, an association for the com


pletion of the cathedral of St. Mary. That the members thereof
engage to pay one half crown per month, or at the rate of six-
pence for each member of the family, towards this object. That
members of the association be invited to offer themselves to
become collectors to this fund. That collectors shall meet on an
appointed day for the purpose of arranging their several districts
and of organising the association, and that the funds being at
present exhausted a general subscription be opened, to which all
are most earnestly invited to contribute,”
Mr. Therry, Commissioner of the Court of Requests, in moving
the next resolution said, it was one which required no great
amount of eloquence, as the sentiment of congratulation and
gratitude it contained would find a ready response in the boscm
of every member of the meeting. It was natural and just that,
on such an occasion as the present, they should offer their
warmest acknowledgements, and the assurance of their grateful
esteem to Dr. Ullathorne, for all the toils and travels, both by
sea and land he had undertaken, solely for their interests, and in
their service. In the supply of the numerous and efficient clergy he
had induced to visit these shores—some preceding, some accom-
panying, and others yet to follow him—he had given proof of the
zeal, ability and energy with which he fulfilled the mission
entrusted to him. They had for many years experienced his
zeal while he was present amongst them; but they had now
manifestation of it whilst he was absent; and the only question
they had to determine respecting him was, whether absent or
present his anxiety for their welfare was the more assiduous,
persevering and serviceable ? It must be gratifying to Dr.
Ullathorne to see the edifice in which they were now assembled,
which he had left in a roofless and unfinished state, now rapidly
advancing towards completion—and to see the catholic religion,
which was but as a speck on the horizon when he first touched
upon these shores, gradually enlarging in size and strength. On
such an occasion it was impossible to be unmindful of the services
and of the name of the founder of that church in which they
were then met, the Rev. Mr. Therry—a name that could not be
blotted out from the page of the religious history in the colony
nor erased from the tenderest and most grateful endearance of its
catholic inhabitants. (Applause.) Besides the congratulations
with which they had welcomed Dr. Ullathorne and his associates,
they owed him a large debt of gratitude for the success of his
exertions in the mission, which was not undertaken in the pursuit
of any personal advantage nor to advance the wealth of the
colony, already accumulating wealth beyond any British colony,


nor to promote its commercial or agricultural interests. While in
England, he would venture to say, his reverend friend had not
once enquired how wool sold at Garraway’s, nor into the state of
the oil market. (Laughter.) There were a sufficient number
already engaged in these pursuits. The object of his mission was
quite a different one —to cause those to be remembered who were
forgotten, to relieve the wants of the depressed and deserted, and
to place a limitation to their distresses; to attend to the
neglected —these were the high and meritorious objects of his
mission, so that his voyage, like that of the illustrious Howard,
may be said to have been “ a circumnavigation of charity.” The
presence of the numerous clergy assembled on that day was the
best argument in favour of the resolution, as it furnished proof
of the zeal and services of Dr. Ullathorne, and the sympathy he
created in their favour.
The second resolution was then passed from the chair: —
“ That whilst we acknowledge with unfeigned gratitude the
goodness of Almighty God in the arrival of the reverend clergy
who have recently come amongst us, our thanks are also due, and
are hereby given, to the very reverend the vicar-general, for the
zeal, activity and ability with which he has accomplished the
arduous mission entrusted to him by the right reverend the bishop ;
and this meeting tenders to him and the reverend clergy who
have lately arrived our congratulations and the expression of our
grateful esteem.”
Dr. Ullathorne next addressed the meeting : —“ My lord, why
should praise and honor be given to me ? Praise and honor
belong only to Cod, and to Him I give back that which you,
dear friends, have given to me. In your heart, my lord, my heart
lives. I have been but the organ of your spirit. For, as Samuel
about Elias, so was I brought up about you, to serve the temple ;
as Paul before Gamaliel, so was I brought up at your feet. lam
but as it were an excrescence upon the large heart which God
has given to you for great purposes. I have long since lost my
personal identity, which has been merged in yours, because I saw
that yours was merged in a great cause, and that cause is not less
than the planting of the church, and the planting in its primitive
fervour in a new world. I have had no other will than yours,
for in yours I have always been accustomed to see the will oi
God. You spoke, and I went forth ; you breathed into me your
spirit, and that spirit prevailed. Let me expand in gratitude to
God, who sent His angel to accompany me and made all my
designs to prosper. You, the beloved flock whom I served, judge
of my joy at being again amongst you. If the brother rejoices


at the return of an absent brother, if the mother’s heart yearns
over the children whom she sees again after a long absence, and
if the guardian angel receives enlargement of happiness at the
sight of those received into heaven over whom he has had long
care, judge how full is my soul, who am at once your brother
y T our parent and your guardian, because your pastor. I left you
not for any personal object, but that I might serve you the more.
My friend Mr. Therry has well remarked that I never once
whilst in Europe mentioned the price of wool or of oil, though I
was doubtless often asked the question.
“ ‘Well,’ it would be asked of me by various persons, ‘ how is
land selling in N.S.W. ?’ ‘really,’ I would reply, I have been so
much occupied with the cultivation of sheep, that I have not paid
much attention to mere land. ‘ Well then, how is wool selling ? ’
‘ Why, you will think it very strange ; but though my flocks are
very numerous, they don’t bear wool; and if they did we would
not fleece them.’ (Laughter.) During my long absence you
were ever in my heart ; I lived but for you. On the trackless
seas you were my care ; amongst the icebergs of the Horn, in a
most severe winter, my prayers were constant for you. I landed
in England ; and wherever ray steps fell, in public or in private
life, I spoke of you and of your wants. I passed over to Ireland
and pleaded your cause ; I entered into France, and it was
sufficient to know you were Catholic, and in want of aid, to
obtain the co-operation of the faithful in that country. I crossed
the snowy Alps, descended upon the plains of Lombardy, passed
through the innumerable states of Italy: and when I stood
before that venerable man, on whose mitred brow a trinity of
crowns is pressed—the load of the spiritual—l thought I saw
Peter and all his successors. I saw the halo of 1800 years
gathered on the august temples of Gregory the XYI; and in my
person you all did homage to the prince of pastors, to the corner
stone of Unity, to the successor of Peter, to the Vicar of Christ.
Many and kindly affable were his enquiries about you, and deep
the interest he showed in this remote portion of his universal
charge.
“ When I stood in the noblest temple the world ever saw, an
emblem of our religion in its universality, I beheld from its
centre how to every quarter of the world it expanded an arm, and
how, above all, its vast dome seemed to enclose heaven as well as
earth ; and how it seemed to have gathered to itself all the
richest materials of the earth, mystically arranged in order to
express the profusion of spiritual treasures which it emblemati-
cally represents. This did not most interest me; but I went


down beneath its marble pavements, and stood upon the porphyry
floors of that elder church which Constantine, the first Chris-
tian Emperor, and Pope Sylvester had raised more than 1500
years ago, I entered the silver sanctuary, where side by side lie
the bodies of Peter and Paul, the dearest remains which are left
us—for the body of Christ arose and ascended to heaven ; yet
was that sacred body with me there in another manner, as it was
on the altar to-day, and upon the altar of that tomb you were
then in my heart, and I offered up the eternal sacrifice, that the
Apostolic spirit in its first fervour might descend upon Australia.
“And when on the Feast of the Pasch I mingled with the
150,000 men of Rome, who blended with the 60,000 strangers
gathered together from every spot of the earth within the arms of
that vast portico, which seems to invite and embrace the world,
and when that venerable figure of the sovereign pontiff arose with
uplifted arms to bless the city and the world, you then knelt in
me and prayed through me that, ‘ as the odors of a full field,’ so
might the blessings of God come down in their plenitude
upon you.
“In short, Avhoever knew me said, that I seemed to live and
breathe but for your cause. When I arose in the pulpits of
England and Ireland, of you only could I utter a word,
and of your wants and claims. In whatever I have
said or written of you, at home or in foreign lands, I had
but one object—to deter poor weak, ignorant men from
crime, and to arouse the zeal of good men to hasten with their
help to the fallen. For this I had but one resource ; to spread
before their eyes a picture of what my eyes had seen —of the
miseries in which my heart had mingled. I know of no politics,
for I am set apart to religion, I know of no parties or party
views—except to lament the disunion and uncharities which
grow out of them—for lam a minister of peace. I care not for
the temporal interest or material happiness of any man or class
of men, when these strike against interests antagonistic to
' < O O
the interests of a higher and more widely spread order. My
motto in such matters is that of the illustrious Bishop Milner, ‘ I
know of no politics but those of religion, and no party but the
Church.’ What man then in any place on this petty globe shall
dare to rise so far above the respect he owes himself, as a
member of our common humanity, as sharing the same flesh,
blood, soul and spirit with myself, as having part in the common
fall of our Nature —though he may have a trifle of the elevation
—who shall presume to say, that I, who as a man cannot be in-
sensible to the miseries of any of my fellow men, who as a
156


Christian should bring health to every wounded spirit, and a
refreshing cordial to every troubled heart; what man dares so
far to depart from himself as to say that I may not use the truth
in order to arouse the zeal of men, and to deter from crime by
painting the bitter miseries of its punishment ?
“What changes have I witnessed in the Mission of this
country ? It is not six years since I landed a solitary stranger ; I
found but three priests, zealous ones indeed, but what were these
amongst so many, and these so widely spread ? This building,
now so magnificent, was more like a ruin than a temple ; the walls
of two others, only commenced, werehasteningtodecay. I have seen
strange invisible things as though they were visible. I have seen
circumstances and events follow and combine with each other in
such numerous and strange ways, independently of human will
in our regard, that I can no more doubt the finger of a special
Providence over our affairs, than if I saw it incarnate before me.
I have done nothing, I was but the empty capacious vessel of
reception for the gifts of God as they unexpectedly came from
many quarters. Ireland, as of old, supplied her Saints, and
England gave her money; the Continent even claims a share in
the good work and France, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium,
Holland and many other parts of Germany, contributed each
their mite to enable me to complete the good work. The history
of our Mission is known not only to our countrymen at home, but
75,000 copies in the languages of Europe have made it familiar
to the faithful of the Continent, from the peasant to the prince,
from Paris to Vienna, and from Constantinople to the Baltic. We
have now twenty priests engaged in the Mission, besides the pro-
vision for Van Dieman’s Land; eight divines under your own
eyes, my lord, are preparing soon to enter the field of our labors ;
three others are equally making their preparations in the college
of Douai. Schools are increasing ; our missionaries are men on
whose brows are stamped the character of holy experience, our
young men all fresh in their fervor from the altar of their
vows. The institutions of the Church are being completed ;
holy women have forgotten the delicacy of their nurture
and the tenderness of their bringing up, they have
closed their senses to the blandishments, the fascinations,
and accomplishments of the world ; they have made themselves
deaf to the syren-cry of kindred and friends; they only know
that here was much crime and misery. Why do the angels of
God visit this earth ? Because in Heaven there is no misery, and
the God they love is merciful and compassionate ; and they saw
the Son of God come down to our poverty, to heal our sorrow by


labour and sufferings. And these, his daughters, saw also in Aus-
tralia the Cross was lifted up, and Christ upon it in bitter suffer-
ing ; like the Maries, they thirsted to be near Him in his agonies.
Wherever human miseries are greatest, there also will they be
found ; they will seek the bruised, they will bind up the broken
heart, they will pour in oil and wine and balm—the oil of mercy,
the wine of charity, the balm of heavenly consolation. lam
ashamed of myself when I think of their heroism. One word let
me address to the particular object of this meeting, and I have
done. It was the glory of our forefathers in faithful ages,
whilst they lived themselves in holy guise, to consecrate
all the best gifts of God to the honour of His worship. They
thought nothing too good for the God of goodness, who
gave them all. Let us rejoice to be like them. Remember that you
are not building for yourselves only, but leaving the best legacy,
the noblest and most lasting monument of yourselves, to your
descendents. It is here your minds are unburdened in their
sorrows, here you receive pardon for repentance : from this altar
the mingled streams of celestial fire and celestial blood will flow
for your spiritual strength and animation. Here will your
children be purified at the font, here will they receive the light
of heaven, here will they be united in holy bands, here will be
brought your greatest sorrows, that you may leave them, and
hence you will carry your greatest joys. And when the grave
closes over your bodies, when every other monument and remem-
brance of you have decayed and disappeared, the children of your
children’s children will be praying in this place, and enkindling
the fervour of their religion by that spirit which, whilst it
animates with life this temple, wdll recall the piety and self-
sacrifice of those ancestors who, through many difficulties, raised
it up for the service of the Living God.
“My Lord, may I express in conclusion my confident hope
that at the end of your labours, (may they be very long) the
crown of brethren with whom you are encircled —I have added
fifteen to the number—may still be yours, enriched with the load
of their labours ; may you be able to say to Christ, ‘ of these whom
thou gavest to me I have not lost one.’ At the terrible account,
(may it be far distant, and may I pass away first) may the
thousands of your people be also with you, and the words which
the Almighty put into the mouth of the prophet Ezekiel wdll be
your own, and presenting them to the Son of God you will say,
these came to me from the north, and these from the south, and
these from the Austral land.”


J. R. Brenan, Esq., J.P., moved the next resolution, and said
—“ I have a gratification beyond expression in proposing the
resolution with which I have been honoured, to this most
respectable meeting. It refers to men of other countries and
other colonies. It reminds me of scenes of unparalleled intensity
in interest, of which I was an humble spectator. I allude to the
exertions which at length accomplished the liberation of our
country from the bane of the law and the restrictions of religious
jealousy—to the unwearied zeal of those men of God who lived
only to console their people under their affliction and lift up their
oppressed souls ; how these same good and great men have seen
our distress, and with a disinterested spirit have laboured to pro-
cure good of which they will not participate, save by the
consciousness of having enabled others to comfort ■ the captive,
and to heal the wounded, in affliction. Their reward must not
come from us, but from Him who alone knows the amount .of
good they have accomplished. The expressions of our gratitude
we may offer, and this is embodied in the resolution I have the
honor to propose
“ That our grateful acknowledgements are due, and hereby
given, to the several Members of Parliament and to the other
friends of the mission in England and Ireland, who have so
earnestly and generously evinced their sympathy in our spiritual
wants; and this meeting does especially appreciate that truly
Catholic spirit which has influenced the Right Reverends the
Bishops of Ireland to surrender their claims to the spiritual
services of the apostolic men who have devoted themselves to the
Australian Mission; and in the name and on the part of the
Catholics of New Holland and Van Dieman’s Land, we most
respectfully and affectionately tender to their lordships the
homage of our gratitude, esteem and veneration.”
Dr. Ullathorne, on the motion moved by Mr. Brenan, seconded
by Mr. Coveny, again addressed the meeting to the following-
effect : —■“ My lord, to the enlightened hierarchy of Ireland we are
under very great obligations. Wherever I met those venerable
men, whether assembled or individually, I found but one sentiment
in our regard. I went before them a stranger, they received me
as a friend ; I went among them as an Englishman, they received
me as though I had been an Irishman; I went amongst them
unknown, they saw but my cause, and gave me their respect and
unanimous co-operation. I had but one brief word to say, “My
lord, our people were once your children, and the good Father
never forgets his children, our mission is but an appendage to the
Church of Ireland.” To particularize where all were so willing


■and ready, is almost invidious, and yet I cannot avoid mentioning
the names of two prelates whose sacrifice of their best subjects
was most generous : The Most Reverend Dr. Murray, the Arch-
bishop of Dublin, and the Right Reverend Dr. Kinsella, the
Bishop of Ossory. To another ecclesiastic of eminent dignity in
the Church we owe a peculiar tribute of remembrance. He it
was who by letter urged my visit to the Holy See, and entertained
much care for us. I arrived but in time to console him with the
intelligence of our progress and prospects, for a few days after-
wards, I stood on the outskirts of the assembled princes of the
Church, as they knelt round his dying bed. The illustrious
Cardinal Weld was our protector before the Holy See; as he was
a saint on earth, so he, doubtless, is now a protector before the
throne of God. Yet are we not left without a successor to his
kindness. There are several, and one in particular—a dis-
tinguished member of the sacred college—who will look’'with a
vivid interest for the particulars of our progress : the illustrious
and princely Cardinal Castricane.
“ To many of the members of the legislature we owe a debt
■of gratitude for their solicitude in our behalf. You are aware,
my lord, and no one more so, how difficult it is for a stranger,
amidst a crowd of applicants, to obtain ready access to Her
Majesty’s Ministers without the aid of influential members of the
legislature. Here, again, I feel it almost invidious to particularize,
but there are names which the burden of my gratitude urges me
specially to mention. Of the members of the House of Lords we
are most particularly indebted to the noble lords Clifford and
Stourton, and to the noble Earl of Fingal. Of the members of the
House of Commons we are specially indebted for their zeal in our
behalf to Daniel O’Connell, Mr. Moore O’Farrell, Mr. Lynch, Mr.
Shiel, the Honorable Mr. Langdale, and to that personification of
indefatigable zeal and benevolence in the cause of religion, Mr.
Philip Howard, who seemed to live but to serve us.”
The Reverend Mr. Geoghegan moved the next resolution,
which was to solicit additional aid from the Government. He
had but just arrived in the colony, which would excuse him from
not taking a prominent part in the proceedings of the meeting.
He was glad to hear of the liberal aid already given by the
and he hoped they would prove themselves worthy
■of a continuance of its extension. He concluded by moving the
fourth resolution:: —“ That a petition be presented to the Legisla-
tive Council, praying for additional aid towards the completion
■of the Cathedral, and that the Attorney-General be requested to
present it.”
Mr. Davis seconded the resolution.


Mr. Therry, before the resolution passed, recommended that
the Committee should use its best exertions to obtain numerous
signatures for the petition. After the liberal aid offered by the
Legislative Council in other instances, during the former and last
sittings of the Council, it would be an unjust and unworthy
suspicion to doubt the impartial distribution of the public funds,
which experience forbade them to entertain ; to doubt that the
prayer of this petition would receive all the fair and favourable
attention to which the wants of the community, on whose behalf
it was presented, and the reasonableness of the request entitled it.
It was then moved by the Very Reverend Dr. Ullathorne: —
“ That the Right Reverend the Bishop do leave the chair, and
that the Reverend Mr. Murphy take it.”
Moved by the Very Reverend Dr. Ullathorne : —“ That the
thanks of this meeting are eminently due to the Right Reverend
the Bishop, for his dignified and, what they valued much more,
his amiable conduct in the chair.”
The Bishop briefly expressed the pleasurable sensations
with which this meeting was closed. Having congratulated the
clergy and people on the union which existed amongst them, and
on the supply of all the branches of spiritual administration, His
Lordship exhorted them most earnestly and affectionately to-
evince their gratitude by a faithful correspondence with the
Graces of Heaven, and whilst, with becoming zeal, they laboured
to complete the material edifice, let them not forget the spiritual
edifice to be built up unto Christ, by the exercise of Faith, of
Hope, and of all the virtues of a good life. Having received the
episcopal benediction, the meeting was dissolved. The collection
amounted to about £l3O.
The new arrivals, whilst arrangements were being made,
t } n o '
stayed at the Bishop’s villa in Woolloomooloo. For a short
time the Rev. P. B. Geogeghan was attached to the district of St.
Benedict, and I may say he formed that mission. This is the
same Father Geogeghan who was afterwards Bishop of Adelaide i
he was a Franciscan Father, and had been one of the Community of
Adam and Eve, in Dublin. He made his philosophy and theology
in Spain, in a house belonging to his Order. He was distinguished
in Dublin as a preacher. When he came to the colony his zeal,,
eloquence and learning attracted many, and he was very suc-
cessful, by reason of his piety and learning, in advancing the
glory of God, and gaining souls to his service. Not very long
after commencing his labours in Sydney he was appointed to Port
Philip, as the first Catholic missionary to that new settlement
M


The Rev. Richard Marum was stationed at Liverpool, near
Sydney. He distinguished himself at Maynooth College, and had
been studying for two or three years on the Dunboyne establish-
ment ; but his health failing, he did not long survive; had he
lived he would have been a great acquisition to the mission, on
account of his piety and learning. He was nephew to Bishop
Marum, of Kilkenny. The Rev. T. Butler was very soon sent out
by the Bishop to Launceston, in Van Dieman’s Land. We will
have the opportunity of noticing, in another page, the great good
he did for religion.
The Sisters of Charity, whose names I have given, were the
first Nuns who landed on these Australian shores; and they were
selected in Ireland by Dr. Ullathorne. It required all but heroic
resolution on the part of these religieuse to separate themselves
at the time from their Holy Sisterhood, surrounded as they were
by the grandeur, influence, and opportunities of religion, breathing
an atmosphere of faith and virtue, to encounter a long, dreary,
and dangerous voyage to the extremities of the earth, for the
purpose of reforming the unfortunate of their sex, and generally
to help in the advancement of Faith and morals. But since the
day when the order was founded by St. Vincent de Paul, the
Sisters of Charity were always ready to make generous sacrifices;
whether on the field of battle by attending the wounded, amongst
the crowded poor and disconsolate of the cities, or in the prisons
amongst the criminals. The charity of God, with which their
breasts are filled, knows no difference in its object. The zealous
Bishop was overjoyed at the arrival of the Sisters, anticipating
the good they would effect in communicating the graces of God to
the most degraded, most despised and hardened of their sex. In
the account of his mission, which he sent to the Propagation of
the Faith, he gives particulars of the circumstances in which they
were placed on their arrival, and where they were established.
These are the words of Dr. Polding : —“ The locality at Parramatta
in which we intended to place them not being prepared when they
arrived, they remained for some time in the residence of the
Bishop. After the space of three weeks they were able to enter
on the battle field of their labours : and immediately were their
labours blessed by the most consoling results. There is an exten-
sive factory in Parramatta in which those females are confined until
they have been assigned to employers in the interior ; and some
prefer to remain in the establishment that they may not be ex-
posed to temptation. There are sometimes 1,200 of those unfor-
tunate women in the factory at the same time, and usually about
one half of these are Catholics. Your Eminence (addressing the


Cardinal Prefect of the Propaganda) will judge how necessary it
was to introduce into such a place the sweet and consoling instruc-
tions of the Sisters of Charity. The Governor immediately
granted the sisters permission to visit that asylum of crime and
misery and to visit it whenever they thought fit
In the Lent succeeding the arrival of the Sisters of Charity a
general preparation for the Sacraments was proposed to those
who were confined in the factory. Nearly the whole of them
availed themselves of the invitation. The Bishop, Vicar-
General and two other priests attended to hear the
confessions; and the result of this combined force was
clearly discernible in the improved conduct of the inmates; the
officials of the prison candidly acknowledged this to be a fact.
Those who had not been confirmed received the sacrament of con-
firmation. In the meanwhile the edifying and assiduous exertions
of the sisters caused a great many protestants to apply to them
for instruction, and every week persons were led to the Faith
and sanctity of life. Besides the duties of the sisters in the
factory, which they fulfil at hast twice a day ; they visit the
hospital of the town as well as the infirm. Further, they have
•charge of a large school and give instruction, when required. Our
orphan school also is placed under their superintendence. The
omnipotent God in Iris goodness has blessed them, and by
inspiring the young with a vocation to a religious life, they have
been enabled to undertake their duties with an increase of their
number. Four have entered into the convent since the arrival of
the sisters ; one of them is a convert from Socinianism. They
have obtained a house and garden which have been secured to
the institute for ever. We are indebted for this in a great
measure to the Association for the Propagation of the Faith, for
which we cannot be sufficiently grateful.”
I find that the origin of the Sisters of Charity coming to the
colony was this; In the year 1837 Bishop Folding made applica-
tion to Mother Mary Augustine Aaikenhead, foundress of the
Sisters of Charity in Ireland, for a community to be devoted to
the Australian mission. The sisters of Charity founded the
Magdalene Asylum in 1848. For this charitable purpose a
house was provided by Sir George Gipps, the governor, who
gave the establishment, formerly known as Carter’s Barracks.
In the year 1856 this institution was consigned to the care of
the Sisters of the Good Shepherd.
The Benedictine Sisters arrived in 1848, and were settled
at Subiaco, on the Parramatta River. They are cloistered
nuns, and devote themselves to the education of young ladies
in the higher branches of learning.


Allow me to advert here to- a grievous charge of injustice,
which was preferred by the famous Bishop of Exeter, Dr.
Philpotts, of Exeter Hall notoriety, against Sir Richard Bourke,
when he was governor of New South Wales, which implicates
also the council of the colony at the time : He was charged
with partiality and giving preference, inasmuch as he
recommended, with the advice of his council, that Government
support be allowed to the Roman Catholic Bishop, to the amount
of £SOO annually without an equal sum being raised by the
Catholics of the colony. This charge was made by Bishop Phil-
potts in a pamphlet which contained the address to his clergy. It
was published in the year 1839, when Sir R. Bourke was living
retired on his estate in the county of Limerick. I here present
the able and statesman-like letter of the former Governor of New
South Wales, in which he refutes and repels the monstrous in-
justice of that bigoted ecclesiastic.
SIR RICHARD BOURKE AND THE BISHOP OF EXETER.
11 Upper Belgrave Street, Nov. 30, 1839.
My Lord, — I have seen within these few days, for the first
time, your lordship’s published Charge to the Clergy of the
Diocese of Exeter, at their late visitation. The pamphlet, I find,,
contains observations on the ecclesiastical establishments of
Australia, and, with reference to them, your lordship’s state-
ment of a proceeding of the Governor and Council of New South
Wales at the time when I held the Government of that colony.
The statement and your lordship’s remarks upon it contain a
heavy charge against the Governor and Council, and as I have
reason to know that it is unfounded, your lordship will allow me
to repel the charge as publicly as it has been made.
Your lordship accuses the Governor and Council of having,
recommended the appropriation of a sum of public money in
favour of a Roman Catholic clergyman in direct contradiction to
a principle of the Government, acted upon in all cases affecting
clergymen of the Church of England, thus combining partiality
with malversation in the discharge of their official duty. The
facts of the case are simply these ; The Right Reverend Dr.
Folding came out to New South Wales towards the close of the
year 1835 to exercise episcopal authority amongst those of the
Roman Catholic communion in that colony. His stipend was
fixed by Lord Aberdeen, under whose authority he came out, at-
164


£l5O a year, which, under certain circumstances, was to be raised
to £2OO. At the first session of the Colonial Legislative Council,
subsequent to the arrival of Dr. Folding, a memorial was addressed
to the Governor and Council in the name of the Roman Catholic
inhabitants of New South Wales, praying for the augmentation
of their bishop’s stipend. The memorial having been taken into
consideration in the usual form, and the important duties which
Dr. Folding had to discharge, and the expense which he must
necessarily incur in their execution being adverted to, as well as
the station he occupied amongst those of his communion, and the
fact that the Bishop of Australia received an annual stipend of
£2OOO from the Colonial Treasury, the Council resolved to
recommend to the Secretary of State to raise that of Dr. Folding
to £SOO.
Upon this transaction your lordship informs your clergy as
follows: —“ The Council recommend £SOO per annum, which was
proposed to the Government at home, and forthwith assented to,
although it was in direct contradiction to the principle established
five months before, and acted upon in all cases of the Church of
England, that the amount of private contribution should be the
condition and measure of public aid, (p. 15). In this case there
was no private condition whatever.”—(Charge, p. 11).
Now, when I inform your lordship that no such principle or
rule as that which you have stated affecting the stipends of the
clergy of any religious persuasion in New South Wales prevailed
at the time when it was recommended to raise Dr. Folding’s, nor,
as I believe, at any time before, or at any time since (except in
one contingency, not bearing at all upon the case, but which, to
avoid any possible cavil, I will state hereafter), and that conse-
quently no clergyman of the Church of England could possibly
have been affected by it, the monstrous injustice which has been
done to the Governor and Council by the sweeping declaration to
your lordship’s clergy, as above quoted, is but too clearly shown.
Had your lordship been pleased to pay attention to the papers
through which you state elsewhere you had travelled to discover
the Church to which I gave a preference, you could hardly have
failed to see that it was proposed and authorised by the Homo
Government that for the erection of churches, chapels, and
ministers’ dwellings a sum equal in amount to private contribu-
tions might be issued from the Colonial Treasury, but it is
nowhere proposed or directed in these papers to require any con-
tribution in aid of the stipends of the clergy, which are, on the
contrary, to be paid by the colony under a totally different
regulation. It is possible your lordship may have merely adverted
165


to the expression in Lord Glenelg’s dispatch o£ the 30th Nov.,
1835, which you quote ; but, in a matter involving a charge of
official delinquency against the representative of the Crown, and
the Council appointed by the Crown in one of its foreign
possessions, it would have been no unusual exercise of prudence
to have ascertained by comparing Lord Glenelg’s dispatch with
that to which it replied, how far the expression you relied on
related to the matter under consideration, and whether it fairly
and fully supported the charge proposed to be founded on it.
The exception to which I have referred is to he found in
Sec. 5 of the New South Wales Act, 7 Win. IV., No. 3, which
authorises a certain allowance in aid of private contributions to
clergymen employed to visit at settlers’ houses in remote districts,
where no churches or chapels have been built; it would be avail-
able, by reason of the scattered condition of the inhabitants.
This Act was not passed until August, 1836, and does not hear on
the question of Dr. Folding’s stipend.
In the paragraph of the Charge at p. 10, from which I have
quoted, your lordship evinces a very laudable anxiety for the
maintenance of due subordination in the Colonial Department
and you state with seeming displeasure and regret, that “ Sir R.
Bourke scrupled not, in despite of the despatch of Lord Aberdeen,
to take advice of the Council upon the amount of stipend which
they would be willing to assign to Dr. Folding, if His Majesty’s
Government consented to enlarge it.” But your lordship has
omitted to state that the question arose upon a memorial
addressed to the Governor and Council by a number of respect-
able gentlemen in the name and on behalf of the Roman Catholics
of New South, which document is to be found with the despatch
from which your lordship quotes. To this petition your lord-
ship doubtless would at once have replied in the words you placed
in italics, that “ Lord Aberdeen was not prepared to sanction the
augmentation of Dr. Folding’s stipend.” But I have yet to learn
that it is the duty of Governor’s to slight the petitions of Her
Majesty’s subjects, or to debar her Ministers from performing in
her name, an act of grace and sound policy, even though it should
be necessary to revise a former instruction. Sure I am, that a
nobleman, whose name has just been mentioned, would more
honor the breach than the observance of any command of his
which was found to be at variance with the reasonable desires of
any loyal and dutiful subject of the Crown.
The same charge is repeated in italics in the next paragraph
of the pamphlet as applying to the Roman Catholic Yicar-General
of New South Wales, and must for the reasons already given be
declared unfounded.
166


Your lordship also imputes blame to the Lieutenant-
Governor and Council of Van Dieman’s Land for having granted
in 1835 to the Roman Catholics of Hobart Town pecuniary aid
for erecting a chapel, on terms more favorable than those granted
to members of the Church of England proposing to build a
church in the same town. Though I cannot pretend to have as
intimate acquaintance with the affairs of Van Dieman’s Land as
with those of New South Wales, yet I will venture, in the
absence of Sir George Arthur in Canada, to offer an opinion
though opposed to your lordship’s, that the Lieutenant-Governor
and Council had good reasons for what they did. I find in Sir
George Arthur’s Minute of 1835 to the Legislative Council a
document, not given with the Parliamentary Papers, No 112, the
following statement of each case;—“ In Trinity parish a church
is much wanting. Subscriptions were invited turn years since
from the inhabitants, but from some unexplained cause the
scheme has languished until very lately. I confidently rely upon
your support in providing such sums as may be required for the
erection of a church in that quarter of the town, keeping in view
the principle laid down by his Majesty’s Government.” And in
the paragraph next but one it is stated : —“ You are aware that
the Roman Catholics of Hobart Town have not at present any
suitable place of Public Worship whilst His Majesty’s Govern-
ment has recently acquiesced in an increase of the number of
chaplains. It has appeared to me, therefore, though I have re-
ceived no direct instructions from home on the subject, to be
proper that aid should be given them in building a chapel
sufficiently large to accommodate them, and I have accordingly
proposed that £l5OO should be voted for that purpose. It will
be remembered that a considerable number of the members of
this communion are not in circumstances to subscribe largely, and
I think, therefore, that this is a case in which an equal contribu-
tion by the people should not be rigidly required.”
I believe at that period (1835) there was no official regula-
tion in Van Dieman’s Land by which the aid granted to Roman
Catholics or Dissenters was to be measured ; and up to that date,
I apprehend, little aid had been granted to them ; whereas a rule
by which the building of churches and schools for the Church
of England was to be aided to the amount of private contribu-
tions had been long in existence. The regulation under which
other communions became entitled to similar aid, and to that
only, did not reach Van Dieman’s Land until 1836.
I will now beg leave to remark, that if I had not thought it
necessary to refute the charge brought against the Governor and


Council of New South Wales, it is probable I should not have
noticed what your lordship is pleased to say of myself at page 5
of the pamphlet in a strain certainly not remarkable for courtesy
or candour. Your lordship observes, that “ Sir It. Bourke, in all
his numerous and voluminous despatches, so far as I can discover,
does not appear in a single instance to indicate the slightest
preference of any church, or any creed whatever, the only
feeling on this subject expressed by this representative of
the Sovereign in New South Wales being that of hostility to an
established church.” I will briefly reply that it was no part of
my duty to lay before the Secretary of State for the Colonies my
confession of faith, or to trouble him with my opinion on the
advantages or disadvantages of an established church, except as
related to the affairs of the colony whose affairs I administered.
It need not, therefore, have surprised your lordship that in perus-
ing my despatches, you find no display of my religious opinions.
If the service of the colony had required their publication, they
would have been given. That service did however require that I
should convey to the Minister of the Crown the best information
I could obtain as to the opinions and feelings of the colonists, for
whose religious instruction a provision was about to be made.
Sir George Arthur also thought it necessary to report the
prevailing opinion upon the subject of church establish-
ment in Van Dieman’s Land. At page 70 of the Parlia-
mentary papers, to which your lordship has so often referred, he
observes : —“ I very fully appreciate the views entertained and
expressed in the Executive Council by the Chief Justice, and
other equally reflecting and excellent persons, who seem to dread
any countenance being given to other sects as injurious to the
interests of the established church. Igo all lengths with them in
the conviction that some establishment is necessary ; but I do not
think that the support of an exclusive system was at any period
wise. It is not only impolitic by defeating the end aimed at, but,
in the present day, I conceive it would be impracticable to sup-
port it without such an opposition as would shake the Church
itself.” The representations made to the Secretary of State, as to
the course of public opinion in New South Wales, produced a
measure which has, I trust, secured the lasting peace, while it
has excited the religious spirit of the colonists. In 1836 a Church
Act was passed by the Council, without a dissentient voice,
facilitating the erection of places of worship, and the appointment
of ministers of religion. Of these advantages by much the largest
share has been obtained, as was anticipated, by the Church of
England. Several new churches have been built, or are in pro


gress, and the number of chaplains of this communion has been
nearly, if not fully, doubled since the passing of the Church Act
in 1836,
I have the honour to be, my lord,
Your lordship’s most obedient, humble servant,

CHAPTER VI.
The arrival of Sir George Gipps, 24th February, 1838—Instruc-
tions of Lord Glenelg giving the order of precedence of the
Civil and Ecclesiastical Authorities—Complaint of Bishop)
Broughton against Bishop Folding, for having been received
at the Government House in the habiliments appropriate to a
Bishop of Rome—Letter of Bishop Polding in reply to the
allegation made by the Protestant Bishop—The case submitted
to the Catholic Institute in London, and their Answer.
His Excellency Sir George Gipps arrived in the colony by
the ship XJpton Castle, in the month of February, 1838; and by
the same ship came—Rev. John Brady, (afterwards Bishop of
Perth); Rev. James A. Goold (now the Archbishop of Melbourne),
and Messrs. P. Farrelly and—MThilips, ecclesiastical students.
I have previously given an account of the arrival of these priests
and students.
On the day of the arrival of the Governor, Sir George Gipps,
he issued a proclamation to the effect that he had assumed the
Government of the colony, and that her Majesty had been pleased
to appoint the Bishop of Australia, the Colonial Secretary, and
the Colonial Treasurer, to be members of the Executive Council.
In the beginning of the year 1838 the instructions from Lord
Glenelg, the Secretary of State, were published in the colony,
giving the order of precedence of the Civil authorities and the
Ecclesiastical authority.
The following is the order laid down:—l, The Governor; 2,
Lieutenant-Governor ; 3, the Bishop ; 4, Chief Justice ; 5, Mem-
bers of the Executive Council; 6, President of the Legislative
Council; 7. Members of the Legislative Council; 8, Speaker of
the House of Assembly ; 9, Puisne Judges.


An occurrence took place in the year 1889, in regard to> a
complaint of the Protestant Bishop, which caused no little sur-
prise amongst the Catholics of these colonies. Dr. Broughton
complained that the Right Reverend Dr. Folding was received by
the Governor at the levee “in the habiliments which are appro-
priate to a Bishop of the Church of Rome.” He had complained
before, in the time of Governor Bourke, but the practise being
continued in the time of Governor Gipps, he took upon him to
reprove that governor also for his indiscretion in receiving and
recognising Dr. Folding as a Catholic Bishop. Governor Gipps
acquainted Dr. Folding with the complaint of Bishop Broughton,
and it was then that Bishop Folding sent a letter to the Governor
in reply to the allegation made by Dr. Broughton. The Protestant
Bishop must have been very much chagrined when he did not
obtain that redress which he expected. The complaint was by no.
means creditable to him, and showed plainly the spirit of ascen-
dency and exclusiveness by which he was actuated. The case
was laid by Bishop Folding, with all the correspondence, before
the Catholic Institute of London, which had been established not
long before and that influential body completely vindicated
the conduct of the Right Rev. Dr. Folding. I here give the
correspondence..
The Catholic Institute was duly made acquainted with the
act of Bishop Folding, in attending the Governor’s levee in a
costume becoming a Catholic Bishop; the being received in such
a costume giving great offence to the Protestant Bishop, Dr.
Broughton. In the notice taken by the Institute it states: —
Dr. Folding has been in the habit of attending the levees of his
Excellency the Governor in the costume referred to in his Lord-
ship’s letter of the 2nd July, 1839, hereinafter stated, and he so-
appeared at a levee holden on 24th May, 1839. On the day
following, Dr. Broughton, who is the Protestant Bishop in the
colony, addressed and sent a letter to Sir George Gipps, who is now
the Governor, of which the following is a copy ;
Sydney, May 25, 1839
Sir, —Having yesterday had the honour of attending your
Excellency’s levee at Government-house, for the purpose of pay-
ing my respect to your Excellency, on the occasion of her most
gracious Majesty’s birthday, I witnessed the public admission and
reception of the Right Reverend Dr. J. B. Folding, wearing those
habiliments which are appropriate to a Bishop of the Church of
Rome. On a similar celebration in the year 1837 a correspond-
ing occurrence took place ; and I then addressed to Governor Sir


Richard Bourke a letter expressive of my sentiments, a copy
whereof I have the honour now to enclose. This letter lat that
time withdrew, upon receiving from Sir Richard Bourke an
assurance that such appearance of Dr. Bolding at the levee was
unforseen by him, and that it would not be repeated, unless the
practice in that respect at London or Dublin should be altered.
It appears to me, however, that no discretion now remains to me;
but that having witnessed the renewed endeavour now made to
obtain from your Excellency a recognition of Dr. Bolding as a
bishop within the dominions of her Majesty, and thereby of the
jurisdiction of the bishops of Rome within this realm, 1 should
be guilty of a neglect of duty, approaching perhaps to a high
crime and misdemeanour, if I forbore to notice and oppose it.
I have the honour, therefore, to request that the letter now
enclosed, and which was originally addressed to Sir Richard
Bourke, may be considered as expressing my present views; I
have further to request that the same may be transmitted by
your Excellency to her Majesty’s principal Secretary of State for
the Colonies with an application for a legal decision of the ques-
tion, how far such a public reception of a Roman Catholic Bishop,
avowedly and visibly in that capacity, is recognised by the
Statute Law of England, and with the oath of supremacy
especially which civil and ecclesiastic functionaries in general
within her Majesty’s dominions are required to take.
In addition to the above statement, I will with submission
intrude upon your Excellency with the expression of my hope,
that in making such a representation and remonstrance I am
acting wholly upon public grounds and not with a design—which,
indeed, I expressly disclaim—of manifesting any personal dis-
respect towards Dr. Bolding.
I have, &c.,
(Signed) W. G. Australia.
His Excellency Sir George Gipps, &c., &c.
The Institute states :—lt is not considered necessary to refer
to the complaint of Dr. Broughton, made in 1837, further than
to state that it was to the same effect as the one made by his
letter of the 25th May, 1839.
His Excellency the Governor having communicated to Dr.
Bolding the complaints of Dr. Broughton, Dr. Bolding on the
2nd July, 1839, addressed to the Governor a long letter on the
subject, from which the following are extracts :
“In the case as stated by Dr. Broughton, my appearance at
the levee and your Excellency’s reception of me, could only be


construed as a testimony of respect paid by a foreign prelate, an
alien to the representative of her gracious Majesty in the manner
deemed by him most fit to testify respect; and your reception of
him was nothing more than the courtesy a stranger bearing his
character would assuredly receive from your Excellency. It is
not easy to discern how in this transaction the Statute Law, or
the oath of supremacy, or the Act of Settlement has been in-
fringed. I proceed to the facts of the case. I did attend on the
occasion alluded to, as became the head of one of the recognised
religious denominations in the colony, and was received by your
Excellency ; but I did not attend, and of course was not received
by your Excellency in the appropriate vestments of a Bishop of
Rome. I have never attended (I should deem the exhibition un-
seemly and indecent) any secular solemnity in the appropriate
vestments of the episcopal order. If by pontifical ornaments be
meant the cross which I wear on my breast, and my ring,.these
I received on the day of my consecration to remind me of my
vocation and its obligation ; these I have worn ever since in every
place, at every time ; in the dining and drawing room, as in the
church and the condemned prisoner’s cell; and never till now were
they made a matter of offence—with what propriety by one
bearing the character of a Christian prelate, I leave your Excel-
lency to judge.
“ As regards the levee of 1837, with feelings of extreme pain
I proceed to notice the second allegation, because it rests on the
personal testimony of the Right Reverend Dr. Broughton. The
Right Reverend Prelate declares that he witnessed the public
admission and reception of myself wearing the habiliments
appropriate to a Bishop of the Church of Rome. Truth compels
me to place my solemn denial of the assertion, resting on the
personal testimony of his lordship, in contraposition to that asser-
tion and that testimony. I deliberately deny the correctness
of the statement offered to your Excellency. At the same
time I am fully aware how easily an error in judgment
may be formed on this subject. I do not ascribe to the
Right Reverend Prelate an intentional misstatement of fact;
but when the Right Reverend Dr. Broughton proceeds
from erroneous judgment on fact to gratuitous imputation of
intention, when he ventured to take the range of my mind and
to assert that I thus appeared for the purpose of obtaining a
recognition as a bishop from your Excellency, I feel that a liberty
is assumed in my regard, which I can find no palliating circum-
stances to excuse. Such intention never entered my thoughts.
It is not by appearance at a levee in a dress tolerated or not


censured that I would accept recognition of my sacred character
by the Government your Excellency represents. That there is a
recognised Catholic Bishop in the colony the legislative enact-
ments of the constituted authorities bear evidence, as well as the
Church Act in its clauses, the Church Act in its regulations, the
Legislative Council in its regulations and decisions. Does not
the entire body of your Excellency’s official correspondence in
reference to the Roman Catholic Church in the colony, that of
your Excellency’s predecessor from the month of October, 1835,
give testimony that I am the individual honoured in the recogni-
tion of that name ? Permit me to mention that before I
acquiesced in my nomination, foreseeing the difficulties that might
arise, I required that the Government at home might be consulted..
The Right Reverend Dr. Bramston, who usually transacted
business with the Colonial office in reference to the Roman
Catholic Church in the colonies, applied to the Secretary of State
to ascertain the feeling of the Government. Not only was consent
given, but the extreme propriety of appointing a bishop to govern
the Catholic community in this colony was distinctly expressed..
It was with the formal approbation of the Government at home
that I departed from England. To support my episcopal character
and dignity, the honorable Legislative Council made a provision
immediately after my arrival. No, sir, I did not attend the
levee in pontifical vestments, or habiliments, or ornaments to
obtain from your Excellency a recognition of myself as a bishop
of the Church of Rome. I repudiate the charge, and deem myself
aggrieved that an act and intention unworthy of my station
should be groundlessly imputed to me by the Right Reverend Dr.
Broughton, for no one in the colony ought more accurately to.
appreciate the pure and exalted motives which should influence
a bishop in all the transactions of life.
“ Having thus noticed the case de jure, and the facts on
which that case has been raised, I might close this letter. Certain
observations of the right rev. prelate, however, will justify me
in a further trespass on your Excellency’s time and patience..
His lordship states that he withheld his first letter to Sir Richard
Bourke on the assurance given him by his Excellency that no
such appearance of mine would be repeated. Sir Richard Bourke
did certainly speak to me on the subject, and mentioned that
some person had taken offence, not specifying the name or station
of the individual. He did not inform me that the Right Reverend
Dr. Broughton had interfered and remonstrated, considering that
appearance of mine as an inroad on his jurisdiction. Had I been
in possession of this information, I assure your Excellency that


before your arrival in the colony, with the permission of your
predecessor, the letter of the right rev. prelate, with my reply,
would have been laid before the authorities at home.
“ His Excellency Sir Richard Bourke is moreover informed
that the anxiety imposed on the mind of the right reverend
prelate on the subject of his letter was widely diffused among the
Protestant portion of the community. Of the existence of this
widely diffused anxiety, till I received the communication from
your Excellency, I was entirely ignorant. lam honored by a not
unextensive acquaintance in that community, many particularly
valued friends, holding influential rank, are in it. A word
expressive of offence taken by themselves or by others was never
conveyed to me, and I rely so firmly on their interest in my
welfare as to be certain that if they had heard that anxiety
expressed they would not have permitted me to remain in
ignorance of it. The public papers, some of which were incessant
in their attacks on the Roman Catholic community, and habitually
using every plausible pretext for censuring the acts of the late
Governor, passed over this cause of widely diffused anxiety
without a remark.
“ I cannot refrain from adding my conviction that, considering
the purport and contents of the two letters of the Right Reverend
Dr. Broughton, the question at issue regards not vestments and
habiliments, crosses and rings, but something of higher import-
ance, namely, whether each religious denomination is to enjoy
freedom of conscience on the footing of perfect equality, or
whether a hateful exclusiveness is to be introduced and established
■—whether one whom the Right Honorable Lord Glenelg has
distinguished as the Bishop of the Church of England in Australia
is to be the only recognised head in the colony, or whether each
religious denomination recognised by the Government in its head
and its members, looking up to Her Gracious Majesty as a
common protector and friend, free from all unseemly jealousy and
contentious bickering for exclusive favor and domination, shall
exist on the distinctly avowed basis of perfect equality, to
■ cultivate peace and social love.”
Dr. Folding, having done the Catholic Institute the honor
of transmitting to it a statement of the facts, in order, as his
lordship expresses himself, that its influential members may
“ interfere in the affair so far as may be necessary,” a meeting
of the Committee of Grievances was held on the 18th January,
1840, at which it was resolved to submit the case to Messrs. Addis,


Bagshawe and Cook, barristers-at-law, members of such Com-
mittee, for their opinion as to the legal bearing of it, and the
following is a copy of the report of those gentlemen;—
“It having been referred to us the undersigned, by the
Committee of Grievances of the Catholic Institute, to consider
the legal question arising out of the correspondence, and other
documents, relating to the affairs of the Right Rev. Dr. Folding,
Catholic Bishop and Vicar-Apostolic of New Holland and Van
Dieman’s Land, we certify that we have taken the matter so
referred to us into our consideration ; and we are of opinion that
if ever the Right Rev. Dr. Folding had, as alleged in the letter of
the Bishop of the Church of England in Australia, appeared at
the levee of his Excellency the Governor of Sydney in the appro-
priate vestments and Pontifical ornaments of a bishop of the
Catholic Church, (called in the letter of the Protestant bishop
“ the Church of Rome,”) that his lordship would not have yiol-
ated any law in force ; for we are of opinion that, in point of law,
the prohibition against the public wearing of the Pontificals and
priestly vestments, appertaining to the bishops and clergy of the
Catholic church, which is embodied in the 26th see., of the 10th
Geo. IV, 0. 7. (the Emancipation Act) does not extend to the
colonies. We beg to draw the attention of the Committee to the
fact of the constant appearance of the Catholic prelates of Ireland
at the levees of the Lord Lieutenant in Dublin, wearing the pre-
cise ornaments stated in the letter of the Right Rev. Dr. Folding
to the Governor of Sydney, dated 2nd July 1839, to have been
worn by his lordship, with the addition of the purple Episcopal
cassock. We also beg to draw the attention of the Committee to
the fact that his late Majesty King George IV., has on the
occasion of his visit to Ireland, received the Catholic bishops in a
costume similar to that worn by Dr. Folding. We are also of
opinion that if the case of Dr. Folding required to be strength-
ened, the public sanction of his lordships ecclesiastical rank and
functions by the Government of Sydney, (especially by the
printed circular issued from the Colonial Secretary’s Office, dated
4th Sept., 1836, would not only justify the appearance of his
lordship at the levee of the Governor in the dress and wear-
ing the dress appearing to have been worn by him, but would
render it a breach of state etiquette if his lordship had appeared
on such an occasion in any dress that did not in some manner
indicate his officially acknowledged rank and functions.
Dated this 22hd day of January, 1840.

It has been subsequently resolved by the Committee tee
submit this case to such of the Vice Presidents of the Catholic
Institute who are peers and members of Parliament, in order that
they may lay the facts (if they should think proper so to do)
before the Colonial Secretary in England.*
JAMES SMITH,
Secretary.
I will now give an account of the establishment, in Sydney,
of a Branch of the Catholic Institute. Bishop Bolding considered
it would be a great support and assistance to the Catholics in the
colony to be united with our brethren in England by this means.
The Catholic Church at that time was constantly assailed by
bigoted and malevolent Protestants, the pulpit, the press, and the
platform resounded with calumnies and misrepresentations
against the Catholic Church. The zealous efforts which were
being made by the bishop and his priests were represented as
quite alarming. A Wesleyan minister, the Rev. J. McKenny,
writing from Sydney in regard to the exertions of the Catholics
states : —“ This is not a matter of mere pounds, shillings and pence,
for it now assumes this form;—Shall Australia be a Protestant or
a Popish colony ? The number of priests who are being sent out
is quite frightful. Eight arrived lately in one vessel, and received
from the Home Government £l5O each for their passage
and outfit.”
[* By private communication from a friend in London, we are given to
understand that Lord John Bussell had been waited on by one of the most
influential of the vice-presidents, and that his lordship declared he considered Dr.
Broughton’s remonstrance unfounded and untenable. The Catholic Institute
deserves the lasting respect and gratitude of Catholics in the colonies.— Ed.]

A great public meeting of the Catholics in Sydney, 10th Sept.,
1840, when a branch of the Catholic Institute of Great Britain
was established, and also a branch of the Society for the
Propagation of the Faith —The general objects of the Catholic
Institute of Great Britain, with the names of the patrons —
The labours of Bishop Polding—Laying the Foundation

at Wollongong laid by Bishop Polding—The Foundation
Stone of the Schoolhouse at Campbelltown blessed by Bishop
Polding.
A public meeting was held in the Old Courthouse, Castlereagh-
street, on 10th September, 1840, for the purpose of forming
auxiliary branches of the Catholic Institute of Great Britain, and
of the Society for the Propagation of the Faith. The house was
crowded to excess, the platform being occupied by the Bishop and
Clergy, the gentlemen forming the committee of St. Patrick’s
Society, and the delegates from the country districts. His Lord-
ship, in opening the meeting, said that the establishment of a
branch of the Institute seemed to be imperatively required on
account of the incessant attacks made upon their religious tenets,
and liberty; moreover, their object was to organize an union with
that Association whose effects and transactions filled the world,
&c., &c.
The Rev. Francis Murphy moved the first resolution, viz.: —
“ That the numerous attacks made by means of misrepresentation
and in other unjustifiable ways upon the Catholic community of
New South Wales by organised societies, by officials of the
Government, and others, render it expedient that we should
establish a branch of the Catholic Institute of Great Britain and
her Colonies for the purpose of self-defence.” Amongst many
appropriate remarks he said that their object in furthering the
views for which that meeting had been assembled was to unite
the Catholics in one compact body, not for the purpose of attack,
although they had been called idolatrous imposters and clerical
scoundrels, but merely for the purpose of self-defence. Both the
clergy and the laity expected uncontrolled enjoyment of the
religion of their fathers; and that no dominant Church would be
N


allowed to rear its unhallowed head, fostered and cherished by
the hand of power, to the prejudice of other religious denominations
in this the land of their adoption.
Mr. Duncan, editor of the Catholic Australasian Chronicle,
moved the second resolution. After a few introductory remarks
in praise of the Catholic Institute, he said it was true, as the Rev.
Mr. Murphy had remarked, that the Catholic Church of New
South Wales had been attacked on all sides. They had been
assailed by Diocesan committees, reviled in productions of Tract
Societies, insulted by the abominable and ridiculous fabrications
of catch-penny Protesant magazines, and attacked by public and
private individuals of all ranks in society. Indeed he was well
convinced that it was only the existence of an act of the
legislature which prevented their enemies from coming upon
them with all the force of determined physical oppression.
There was one remark that he would make, undeterred either by
the absence of one gentleman who was concerned in it or by the
presence of the other, namely : That the work of the Very Rev.
Dr. Ullathorne was a complete answer to the aspersions cast upon
the Catholic community in the pamphlet by Mr. Justice Burton.
He then moved : —“ That the thanks of the meeting are eminently
due, and are hereby presented, to the Very Rev. the Vicar-General
for his able, eloquent, and satisfactory reply to Mr. Burton, judge
of the Supreme Court, in vindication of the Catholics of the
Colony: a reply which has added another to the many titles he
had previously acquired to our respect, confidence, and gratitude.”
Before the resolution was put to the meeting Mr. Gibbons
remarked that although he must admit the work of Mr. Justice
Burton had been offensive to the Catholic people, yet it had still
been productive of great ultimate benefit to them, inasmuch that
it had called forth a reply which was unanswerable and had also
compelled them to meet that evening for the purpose of
organization against similar attacks. (Cheers). The resolution
was seconded by Mr. McGuigan and carried amid loud acclamations.
The Lord Bishop presented the resolution to the Very. Rev. Dr,
Ullathorne, remarking that he did so with feelings of extreme
pleasure, knowing the inward gratification the receipt of such a
resolution, accompanied with such a demonstration, w r ould give
the receiver, embodying as it did the enthusiastic approval of all
those in whose cause he had so worthily exerted himself The
Very Rev. Dr. Ullathorne, amidst loud and continued greeting,
returned thanks and rose to say he had been taken by surprise,
as he did not expect the passing of such a resolution. He felt
sincere pleasure at the receipt of such a resolution, embodying as


it did the approbation of those in whose defence ho had taken up
his pen so often; but however often he had found it necessary to
do this in defence of the Catholics of New South Wales, he called
all present to witness that he had never done so for the purpose
of attack. The task which he had imposed upon himself to reply
to Judge Burton he had found a comparatively easy one, for the
moment he took up that gentleman’s book he perceived the
erroneous principle on which it was founded, and he had only to
peruse the necessary official documents in order to establish a full
and complete refutation of every assertion the Judge had made to
the prejudice of their holy religion.
The third resolution was moved by Rev. Mr. Goold ; —“ That
besides an Auxiliary Catholic Institute it is expedient that we
should form a branch of the Society for the Propagation of the
Faith.” This Institution was not less important than the Catholic
Institute, for it was by its influence and the exertions of its
members that the sacred truths of Christianity were spread far
and wide over the surface of the globe. The only way to resist
the incessant attacks against their holy faith would be to form
themselves into organized bodies, and by a liberal contribution
from their purses to further the dissemination of useful
publications. Thus the clouds of calumny might be removed by
which the shining rays of truth had so long and so oppressively
been overcast. The resolution was seconded by Rev. Mr.
Fitzpatrick and carried unanimously.
The Very Rev. Dr. Ullathorne then moved the fourth
resolution and said it required considerable energy and power of
the mind to do it justice, but he was enfeebled by bodily
indisposition and would therefore only read the resolution, which
shewed its own intention:—“ That the Catholic Institute and the
Society for the Propagation of the Faith be formed in union with
the Parent Institute and Society respectively, upon the funda-
mental principles, &c., &c.” He then continued to say the
circumstances of the Colony justified them in establishing the
Institute, so as to combat as successfully as might be the
numerous and unjust attacks which were being made upon the
Catholic body collectively and individually. They were assailed
by the judge on the bench, by the justice of the peace, by clergy-
men from the pulpit. The Catholic community did not wish to
quarrel with anyone, but was rather desirous of associating
peaceably with their fellow-colonists ; still it was necessary, in
justice to their civil and religious safety, to defend themselves
against the unprovoked assaults. At the very last meeting of the
Diocesan Committee what had been said from the pulpit was


carefully collected and afterwards printed, charging the Catholics,
with usurpation, and asserting that its followers offered all their
prayers and sacrifices through another mediator than our Blessed
Redeemer. It was no longer ago than the Tuesday before last
when a person, a non-commissioned officer of a regiment, asserted
at a public meeting held for the purpose of disseminating the
gospel of peace, that Popery, Infidelity, and Satan were in league.
Dr. Ullathorne spoke of the Tract Society and its publications
which were distributed everywhere, filled with misrepresentations,
calumnies, and falsehoods, which only perverted ingenuity could
devise. He further referred to another production—the Sydney
Protestant Magazine. In the number for June, 1840, it professed
to give “ the prices charged for indulgences in various sins by the
present Pope.” It appears there, according to the author of the
paragraph, that a Catholic may murder a layman for £1 Is. sd.
If a layman murdered a priest he must pay £1 19s. 2d. To
murder a bishop would cost £ls 13s. 7d. The author of this
precious document was the Rev. Mr. Mclntyre. Where did he
get his information ? He (Dr. D.) would tell him. It came from
a book written by one Laurentz Bank, a Swedish Protestant..
The present Pope was not more than 75 years old, and this book
was published in the year 1651. So far from being copied,
from any Papal document, it w 7 as immediately condemned by
the Holy See for its falsehoods and placed on the index of
prohibited books, where it remains to this day. It appeared to
him truly astonishing when he saw gentlemen whose general
character they were bound to respect were yet capable
of meeting together in a society, and contributing by the aid of
their presence and influence to the circulation of productions
which seemed to have no other object in view than to insult and
degrade the catholic name. It was always insinuated in these
productions that catholics were prohibited to read the Scriptures
whereas the clergy of the catholic church were most anxious for
the laity to read the Scripture. Before the year 1440 the art of
printing was not known, and the copies of the Scripture then in
existence, were the work of laborious penmanship. Prior to the
publication of Luther’s Bible, there were twenty nine editions of
the Catholic Bible circulating in Germany ; in France not less
than eighteen versions before the year 1541; in Spain two; in
Italy, the heart and fountain of Popery, fifteen editions were
published before that of Martin Luther, and all in the vulgar
tongue. Nay, there was on an average a new Catholic
edition of the Scriptures in Italy for every eighteen months
during the course of some seventy years after the discovery of


printing; fifty editions in seventy succeeding years. It could be
clearly shewn, even at the earliest period of British history, that
the Catholic clergy were employed on that good work. In the
year 706 there was a translation of the Psalms and New
Testament into the vulgar tongue, made by the conjoint
efforts of an Abbot and a Bishop for the use of the
common people. In the year 736 that truly venerable
man Bede, a catholic monk, expired praising God, who had
prolonged his life until he had completed the last line of his
translation of the Holy Scriptures into the language of the people.
King Alfred, who died in 900, made a translation of the Psalms.
In 995 Elfric, Catholic Archbishop of Canterbury, made a new
translation of nearly all the Old Testament. In the year 1290 a
translation of the Scriptures was done in English, of which three
copies are still in existence. On account of the persecutions at
the time of the Reformation there was no new translation of the
Holy Scripture. The first edition of the Rheims Testament
appeared in 1582, and the first edition of the entire Houay Bible
in 1610. He was informed by one catholic bookseller in Dublin
that he sold 50,000 copies of the Catholic Bible in the course of ten
years. In 1836 it was stated in the House of Commons that in the
course of six years three Irish catholic bishoprics had printed and
published 309,000 copies of the Sacred Scriptures among their
people. He had said enough to show that Popery was in league
with no party, however infamous or respectable, to stop the Word
of Life; and having, as he thought, established the necessity of
consolidating the catholic community into one body for the
purpose of defence —owing to the weak state of his health he
was unable to enter upon other important considerations—he
moved the resolution, which was seconded by Rev. Mr. Platt, and
then carried unanimously.
The Rev. Mr. Brennan moved the fifth resolution, viz :—That
the funds of the two institutions be preserved distinct, and that
after all expenses have been paid, they be remitted to the parent
Institute and Society respectively.” The resolution was seconded
by Mr. Coveny and carried unanimously.
The sixth resolution, “ That the Right Rev. the Bishop be
President of the Institute, and of the Society for the Propagation
of the Faith,” moved by Dr. Harnett, and seconded by Captain
Carter, was also carried without dissent
The Lord Bishop thanked the meeting for the honour they
had done him, and expressed a hope that the satisfaction which
he should give in the performance of the duties attached to that
office would be equal to the pleasure which he should feel in
fulfilling them.


The seventh resolution, “That the Very Rev. the Vicar-
General and the Reverend Deans be ex officio Vice Presidents"
was then carried.
The Very Rev. Dr. Ullathorne took advantage of the oppor-
tunity to return thanks on behalf of himself and his reverend
brethren the Deans. He wished to say that the Catholic Institute
of Great Britain was established in the year 1838, chiefly by the
influence of that distinguished individual Daniel O’Connell, Esq.,
M.P. Its president was the Right Honourable the Earl of
Shrewsbury, and its vice-presidents the Right Hon. the Earl of
Newburgh, Lords Clifford, Stafford, and Lovat, the Hon. Sir
Edward Vavasour, Bart., Sir Henry Beclingfield, Bart., Sir James.
Gordon, Bart., Sir Charles Wolsely, Bart., the Hon. Charles
Langdale, M.P., the Hon. Charles Thomas Clifford, Daniel O’Con-
nell, Esq., M.P., Philip H. H. Howard, Esq., M.P., (a gentleman to
whom the catholics of the colony were greatly indebted), and
fifteen other gentlemen of the highest rank and influence ; besides
which it had also been placed under the patronage of all the right
reverend the catholic prelates of England and Scotland. The
Society for the Propagation of the Faith, the object of which was
to spread the doctrines of the catholic church over every part of
the globe, was first formed by a few individuals in the city of
Lyons, on the 3rd May, 1822. Among other evidences of its
usefulness it would be gratifying for them to learn that the
mission of the Right Rev. Dr. Pompallier in New Zealand, had
been undertaken at the instance of this society, and that the
expenses of that mission were defrayed from its funds. During
the six years after its formation the sum of £600,000 had been
expended from its treasury for the furtherance of religion; and
in the seventh year no less than £102,000 was applied in like
manner. To this eminently beneficial society, as well as to the
Catholic Institute, auxiliary branches had been established in
almost every part of the world.
Mr. McQuigan proposed, “ That the Rev. Henry G. Gregory
be appointed treasurer for the Australian Catholic Institute.”
The Rev. H. G. Gregory moved the eighth resolution, and
spoke as follows : —The resolution I have the honour to propose
has for its object the assemblage of the members of the Institute
for the purpose of electing its officials, and for other business
connected with the well-being and continuance of the society.
The reasons which have urged us to the proceedings of this
evening point out the necessity of adopting measures proper for
giving them permanency. These, if I mistake not, will be found
in the resolution I have the honour to propose. An annual


meeting will invigorate our society; a knowledge of the pro-
ceedings of the past year, prosperous or adverse, for we may
expect an admixture of both, will be diffused, interest will be
created, and we shall re-commence our career with courage and
enthusiasm. And, my Lord, though important be the object, great
and glorious the cause we have taken in hand, yet we know by
experience all human institutions will fail unless some invigor-
ating process be entered into for their preservation. Moreover
we shall, I anticipate, derive great gratification from the accounts
which shall then be laid before us—peaceable victories obtained
over prejudice, bigotry, and intolerance—and the rights of truth
vindicated : whilst the shield of legal protection, sheltering alike
the weak and the strong against the oppressor and calumniator,
shall earn for the Catholic Institute of Great Britain and the
Colonies our respect and gratitude. I move, “ That a month’s
notice of the annual general meeting of the Institute be given,
at which the secretary and lay members of the general committee
shall be elected, and an account of the funds and proceedings of
the Institute and Society, of their condition and prospects, shall
be laid before the members, and that the discussion at such
meeting be limited to the foregoing objects.” Seconded by Mr.
Smith.
The twelfth resolution was moved by Rev. Mr. Brady;—
“ That the several congregations be invited to form branches of
the Institute.” He then remarked that ever since his arrival in
the Colony he had been very anxious to see these catholic
institutions established, convinced as he was of their salutary
effects, and of the great and many blessings conferred by
Almighty God upon the members of these most noble, pious, and
charitable institutions. He had had the honour of being elected
vice-president of the Society for the Propagation of the Catholic
Faith, established in Bourbon; he had also had the happiness of
forming several branches himself; and in the several missions
committed to his care of receiving many thousand members into
it; he was therefore an old as well as a working member. He
felt therefore much pleasure in moving the resolution. It was
seconded by the Rev. Mr. Gould, and carried.
Moved by the Rev. Mr. Murphy—“ That his lordship leave
the chair and that it be taken by the Very Rev. the Vicar-
General,”
Moved by Mr. Duncan, seconded by Mr, Coyle“ That the
thanks of this meeting be respectfully presented to the Lord
Bishop for his able and dignified conduct in the chair during the
evening.” (Tremendous applause.)


His Lordship said : He thought he had discharged his duty
by simply acknowledging the kind feeling evinced. They might
anticipate from the proceedings of that evening a cessation of
hostility in many quarters. Frequently attacks were made on
the presumption that no resistance would be offered. The atti-
tude of defence alone often prevented the manifestation of
attack. They had assumed that attitude in the love of peace,
and for the same reason they intended to continue it. (Cheers
and “We will”) Now that they had determined upon this
course it became them to consider how far they would permit a
line of conduct in others of which they had not taken public
notice; he alluded to the practice of certain persons who, earnest
in the work of charity from time to time appealed to the public,
and invited the cordial cooperation of all classes and creeds
Charity, exalting and noble, forbade not merely the action, but
the word, and thought even, which might give pain or be dis-
paraging to the feelings and good name of another. To illustrate,
he had been requested to take part in the proceedings
at the annual meeting of that noble institution the Benevolent
Asylum. He had attended under the presidency of one for
whom he had a sincere respect, He was not surprised at the
conduct of some; but that a chairman, whom he had deemed
deserving of respect and veneration, should tolerate those things,
should give them the sanction of his name, did cause him pain.
At that meeting the humble individual now addressing you was
classed with the infidel and the socialist; was described as the
enemy of truth, and as linked with Satan. Does any action of
mine merit that I should be flung into such a degrading associa-
tion ? Infidelity, Socialism, Popery ! He who maligns my
religion maligns me ; he who insults my religion insults me
That some individuals should have used such language lam
not surprised; but that such expressions should pass unrebuked
by the chair is not what I expected I am clearly of
opinion that a man of upright mind and good intentions may
have a conscientious attachment for that form of belief which he
thinks to be true; but this should be tempered by a delicate
tenderness for the faith and religious practices of others, and even
for the prejudices of those who deem his form of Christianity to
be erroneous I am quite convinced that there are numbers
who subscribe to these societies (Bible Tract Societies), who are
not aware of their working, or to what amount of ill-judged zeal
they give their names and their purses Thank God we
have no dominant church here—no one church exclusively by law
established, nor yet, I imagine, for some years to be established.


But we have three forms of faith distinctly recognised by the
legislature, placed on an equal footing; therefore by all in official
situations to be equally protected and guarded against wrong and
insult; for we all have an equal right to look up to the govern-
ment as our common protector and friend. His Lordship then
concluded by exhorting the people to preserve the same quiet,
forbearing, peaceable demeanor, showing forth the beauty of their
faith in the practice of their lives; and whilst determined to
repel every unjust attack, in all calmness to defend their tenets,
resting their principal dependance on Him, without whose aid the
best efforts of man are vain and fruitless. (Loud cheers.)
The immense crowd then retired in the most orderly manner,
every countenance beaming with satisfaction and delight—an
auspicious beginning to two noble institutions, from which might
be predicted the best results to the colony.
The catholic church made great strides during the years 1839
and 1840. Sir R. Bourke’s Church Act was now in full operation,
and it was deemed advisable by the Bishop and his Vicar-General
to take advantage of its provisions without delay. Through the
strenuous efforts of the good bishop and his clergy churches and
schools were erected in the most populous parts of the colony, as
a means most requisite for the advancement of religion. The
Right Rev. Dr. Bolding was then in the vigour of life, and he did
not spare himself in the labour of the Lord’s vineyard. Whenever
his clergy required him to lay the foundation stone of a church,
or to promote any other good work, he was sure to be present at
the time and place—in fact, it may be said he then worked
almost night and day. There were no good roads in those days,
nor trains, nor telegraphs, and in many places only bridle paths.
He travelled with his clergy from place to place, through
the thick forest, exposed to a broiling Australian sun, and shared
with them the terrible thirst, which sometimes there was nothing
to quench but muddy water. Everywhere he was received by
the people with joy and acclamation, and they bowed implicitly
to his injunctions, The bishop was an excellent horseman, who
bore well the heat and brunt of the day, and often at the end of a
very long ride was less fatigued than the young clergy who
accompanied him.
We find the Bishop on 22nd December, 1839, at ■ the
McDonald River, where he blessed the foundation stone of St.
Joseph’s Church, near Mount St. Joseph in the Windsor district;
the incumbent of the district at the time was the Rev. John
185


Brady, afterwards Bishop of Perth. In Windsor there were
about six hundred Catholics and six stations in the district,
visited monthly, at distances from 12 to 35 miles, and the
number of Catholics attending these varied from 60 to 120. It
was reckoned that Father Brady travelled, about 8000 miles a
year on an average. The address delivered by the Right Rev. Dr.
Folding to the inhabitants of the Lower Hawkesbury and
McDonald River, on the occasion of laying the foundation stone
of St. Joseph’s Church, was as follows:
“ Three years have elapsed since from the height of yonder
mountainous tract I first beheld the lovely valley which extends
its sinuous course on either side of us ; through the morning’s
mist I discerned the sparkling waters of the river which gives its
name to your district, and the tracts which in the highest state
of cultivation, fringe and border its course. As I descended the
precipitous path by which you hold communion with the outer
world, I said to myself : O that my God may grant me strength,
when the decrepitude of age warns me that ere long I must pass
to my dread account, to ci'eep to these quiet scenes before me and
whatever of worldly wealth I may possess shall be devoted to the
erection of a church wherein I shall lift up my hands to offer
sacrifice for my people; and the remains of a voice and of an
energy almost extinct shall be consecrated to the instruction,
consolation, and support of the simple minded inhabitants. I
thought that years, many and tedious, must elapse before a
temple unto the living God would be raised amongst you. How
could I have lost sight of the consoling assurance from the pen of
the prophet, that ‘ Every hill shall be brought low, every valley
filled, every crooked path made straight, in order that all flesh
may see the salvation of God ? ’ —words not merely to be under-
stood as pointing to the victorious influence of divine truth
manifested in the destruction of the prejudices, machinations, and
determinations of Paganism, but generally prophetic of the
removal of every difficulty from the path of the gospel, its
holiness and truth. Four months have not elapsed since I
attended your invitation to commence an oratory which might
also be used as a school, some few miles from here, and now we
are assembled to erect a church, a temple to the living God.
Does not this zeal confer honor on you ? Your school has been
supported entirely at your own expense, yet you hesitate not to
embark in an undertaking which will require considerable contri-
butions. It is thus that ‘He in whose hands are the hearts of
men models them to his own purposes ; ’ it is thus as we expected,
that your souls having become, by a holy life, the spiritual


temples of God, your zeal would not be satisfied until the
material temple, which is the church, should be raised, wherein,
after the wont of your forefathers you might worship in spirit
and in truth.
“ A noble instance of disinterestedness, a gratifying proof that
the right use of riches is not altogether forgotten, the church we
are about to found will record. The land on which we stand is
given by Mr. Watson, who also deposited £3OO as his contribution.
The Almighty has blessed his labours and he deems it right thus
to return a part to Him who gave all. Already does he see
around him the rising families of children he and his excellent
wife have adopted for their own. Placed by him on farms
purchased by his own honest and well-deserved earnings, he
enjoys the highest and most exquisite feast it is for man in his
present state to make unto himself, in their happiness and
prosperity. For their use and for the public benefit he devote.s
so large a sum for the erection of this church. I may mention
another circumstance which, in my mind, lessens not the value of
the donation nor diminishes my estimation of the man. Thirty
years ago, in a moment of thoughtlessness, that was done which
has been the cause of great regret. Is not this amply expiated
and atoned for ? Is the stain of such a fault to be made more
enduring than the justice of God ? Not so thought that Blessed
Legislator from whose code, as illustrated in his own example, we
are accustomed to draw our rules of life. When the publican
Zaccheus, nay, even the chief of the publicans, by the adventitious
circumstances sought, and succeeded, to see Jesus, was he not
forthwith recognised by the Saviour and desired to prepare to
receive Him into his house, for that He intended to abide with
him ? What were the dispositions of Zaccheus ? Lord, says he,
I give one-half of my goods to the poor, and if I have wronged
anyone I restore to him fourfold. Nor when we see those who
have followed Zaccheus in his aberrations, imitating him in their
return, striving by honest industry to raise themselves that they
may see Jesus and merit to be recognised by Him who came to
save the sheep that was lost, shall we hold in eternal remembrance
the fault of one moment ? It is not thus we shall prove ourselves
the ministers nor even the disciples of Jesus Christ; never, never
will be seen in the conduct of the true disciple of Jesus any
symptom of aversion and contempt for a large class of fellow-
citizens in which, if there be found the objects of punishment
well-deserved, there are and must be, from the nature of human
institutions, many victims of misfortune. I have not read to a
fruitless purpose the history of Ireland for the last two centuries.


I have not seen with my own eyes the misery of that once
unhappy country, but now disinthralled, I trust, from the tyranny
of besotted and heartless faction, the details and consequences
which always result when the arm of power is stretched forth to
uphold a party against a people, without coming to a conclusion
which right reason suggests, which religion sanctions, which is
exemplified and illustrated in the conduct of the incarnate
wisdom of the Godhead. I cannot fasten my judgment to the
ever-turning wheel of fashionable opinion. I am not prepared
to deem Joseph a degraded character, though sold as such by his
malevolent brethren; nor to pronounce the Blessed Jesus guilty,
though condemned by those leagued together for his destruction;
nor to throw a stone at the bidding of every Pharisee. I regard
not of what classes the settlers and cultivators of the soil are
composed ; but wherever I go, and I have largely traversed this
country, I meet men of industrious domestic habits, solicitous to
give their children an education superior to their own, I perceive
a deferential respect where respect is due, an attachment,
combined with that proper sense of independence, which in my
mind evinces a sense of propriety totally incompatible with
vulgar or mean thought. Take for instance this beautiful valley
with its inhabitants ! See those plains ! How zealously has not
the plough pursued its claims to the very mountain foot ' Not a
weed is visible amongst these families of corn plants which bend
their deep green flags to the breeze—emblem, dear children in
Jesus Christ, of your own state, who are the ‘ cultivation of the
Lord.’ How often have I not reposed when neither lock nor
latch nor fastening protected! You support your school, you
give proofs of the proper sense of the value of wealth and the
purpose for which it is given of which you may be justly proud.
Such being your state and your disposition, why should the
minister of peace make enquiries odious and uncharitable. Most
willingly do I bear my testimony that in no part of England, and
I have seen much of her rural population there, have I observed
a middle class possessed of qualities more valuable, or who by
their conduct were more deserving of estimation and of trust,
than it has been mine to meet here and in other parts of the
Colony which in the discharge of my pastoral duties I have
visited. But to return from this digression to the immediate
purpose for which we are this day assembled. Let us not imagine
that we have done a great thing even when we have bestowed
our whole substance on charitable doings; we can claim no right
to meritorious giving when we have none to possess. We cannot
suppose that the Lord requires a temple built by mortal hands


for his worship. The temple in which we are now assembled, in
which the earth furnishes the flooring and the arch of heaven
forms the dome, surrounded by creation, animate and inanimate,
is the most becoming. Yet for man’s accommodation God
condescends to accept worship in a temple built by mortal hands ;
and he deems that which is given towards its erection as bestowed
upon himself. We think it right to offer publicly a proof of our
approbation to the individual whose munificent donation we have
before mentioned. In your name, dearly beloved, we present to
him a treasure, the value of which money cannot reach, a copy of
the written Word of God—the Book of Life, the Holy Scriptures—■
and we feel an especial gratification in thus publicly with our
own hands presenting this most sacred Book to one of our beloved
flock, because we are not without hope that the false idea which
evil-minded men have spread abroad relative to unjust
prohibitions and restrictions will be thus dissipated. The
Catholic Church is said to be hostile to the distribution of the
Holy Scripture. Would to God I could deposit a copy in the
cottage of everyone disposed to read it with proper dispositions!
No, the Catholic Church neither now nor at any other period
prohibited her children from reading the Sacred Volume. Only
when those wicked men, whose object was plunder and sensual
gratification under the pretext of the reformation of religion,
translated the Word of God in the Sacred Scripture and fashioned
it to their own purposes to gratify their misdeeds and rebellion,
when they transformed the truth into a lie, the Church warned
her children against these poisoned fountains of error, and hence
the outcry raised against her, hence the calumnious charge
repeated a thousand times. Keep this book with reverence; let
its laws be thy guide, its counsels thy support and consolation.
When thou hearest its words or readest it, remember God speaks
unto thee, and be as the Jews near the Mount of Sinai or the
devout St. John near the Cross of thy dying Eedeemer.”
His Lordship then proceeded to the celebration of the
ceremonies usual on such an occasion. It was most gratifying to
observe the devotion of the Protestant part of the assemblage—■
the union of heart which seemed to predominate. The meaning
of the ceremonies used was then explained ; and all present on
bended knees having received the blessing of the Bishop, the
ceremony concluded. The interesting occasion will long be
remembered with delight by the inhabitants of the Lower
Hawkesbury and the McDonald River.
But to continue our account of the labours and travels of
Bishop Folding. On the 3rd October his lordship was in East


Maitland, and on the following day (Sunday) he officiated in the
church to a crowded congregation. There were a great many
Protestants present, and the sermon he delivered gave general
satisfaction. In the evening he proceeded to Raymond Terrace,
where he performed divine service on the following morning.
The chaplains of West and East Maitland and the surrounding
districts were the Rev. Mr. Mahony and Rev. J. Lynch. The
population according to the census of 1836 of the town of
Maitland was 1163 persons of which 365 were Catholics. The
chaplains had to travel on an average 5000 miles during the year.
There being no church, mass was celebrated under a tent erected
for the purpose, and it rained nearly all the time. The Rev. Mr.
Mahony said that he felt much pleasure in introducing that
portion of his flock to the especial notice of the Bishop for their
truly exemplary piety and general good conduct, and the bishop
expressed himself highly pleased at the account given of them by
their zealous pastor. A subscription list was opened for the
erection of a church and a handsome sum was subscribed. His
Lordship then proceeded to Hinton, about seven miles distant,
where a great many Catholics were in attendance to meet him,
whom he addressed, and earnestly exhorted to persevere in the
path of virtue and good works. The bishop then went on to
Cooley Camp, accompanied by many persons, and addressed the
multitude for a considerable time. From thence the bishop
proceeded to Glenham, the seat of Mr. C. H. Chambers, where the
party arrived about ten o’clock at night. On the following
morning, sth October, the bishop celebrated mass to about sixty
people, and selected the site for a new church, the land having
been given by the lady of Mr. C. H. Chambers, who had also
subscribed liberally towards its erection. He then went to
Dungog, a distance of about 25 miles, where he was kindly enter-
tained at the hospitable mansion of W. F. Mackay, Esq. Mass
was celebrated the next morning to about seventy catholics, some
respectable protestants being present. The same day the bishop
and party returned to Maitland where they arrived at 10 o’clock
p.m. A great change has taken place in this district in a very
short time, through the zealous exertions of the Rev. Mr. Mahony.
On the 29th September, his Lordship having travelled
overland from Sydney, arrived in the Wollombi district, where
he laid the foundation stone of a church dedicated to St,
Michael the Archangel. A Mr. McDougall presented the land,
and the stone bore the following inscription : —“ This church is
dedicated to the honour and glory of God under the patronage
of St. Michael the Archangel, by the Right Rev. John Bede


Folding, Bishop, Vicar-Apostolic of New Holland and Van Die-
man’s Land, on the 30th September, in the year of Our Lord,
1840 —Sacerdos Rev. J. Lynch.”
On Thursday, Bth October following, the foundation stone
of the church of St. John the Baptist was laid on Campbell’s Hill,
West Maitland, by the bishop. There was accommodation for
600 persons on the ground. The procession, with the children
clothed in white, moved from the temporary church in the town.
The Sacrament of Confirmation was administered to about seventy
persons, young and old : at the close of the Mass nearly the same
number received the Holy Communion. When about to lay the
foundation stone, the bishop said ; —“ On that stone, an emblem
of the new life which you this day commence, deposit all irregular
affections; increase in virtue ; raise higher the fabric of sanctity,
as the walls of this material building come nearer to their termi-
nation: and may this edifice, by being ever the habitation of
virtuous and pious souls, be a figure of the church triumphant in
heaven, where nothing defiled can enter, and where the prayers
of the saints ascend as a sweet odour before the throne of the
Lamb.”
The following was the inscription on a plate laid under the
stone

The Bishop celebrated Mass in the temporary chapel, on
Friday, in West Maitland, and the same day returned to Sydney
by Newcastle
On the same day, on the catholic church ground, Campbell’s
Hill, a branch of the Catholic Institute was established, the Right
Rev Lord Bishop in the chair. The Rev. Y. Dowling, E. Mahony,
and J. Lynch were appointed presidents and Dr. Mallon secretary :
the following persons to act as a committee, viz;—Messrs. Lett,
Dee, Murray, Turner, Grace, Healy, Tierney, jun., Callaghan,
McDougall, Byrne, Tierney, sen., Shinkivin, Haydon, O’Brian,
Brown, Cullen, Clarke, O’Neill, and (ex ojjficio) the Rev. Messrs.
Dowling, Mahony, and Lynch.
On Sunday, 18th October, in St. Mary’s Cathedral,
Sydney, the Lord Bishop conferred the holy orders of sub-
deacon and deacon upon the following gentlemen, viz;—The
Rev. John Kenny, the Rev. James Dunphy, the Rev, Patrick
Magennis, and the Rev. John Grant. A Pontifical Mass was
celebrated by his lordship, and a most learned and interesting
discourse, suitable to the occasion, w r as delivered by the Very Rev.
the Vicar-General, who, as their theological instructor, presented
the postulants to the bishop, and attested in the usual form their
fitness for the sacred office.
Bishop Polding was in Wollongong on 12th October, where
he laid the foundation stone of the church of St. Francis Xavier
on the following day. The catholics of Wollongong were joined
on the morning of the 13th by those of Dapto, Jamberoo, and
Shoalhaven. At the first note of the Adeste fidelis the procession
moved from the presbytery, consisting of the children to the
number of about 200, the members of the committee with cedar
rods, and the whole body of the people, walking two and two.
When assembled in the temporary chapel, and before the sermon,
the bishop offered up prayers, and the children sang the hymn
“ Jesus, the only thought of Thee.” The Rev. Mr. Brennan
preached the sermon, after wFich the procession moved to the
foundation stone close by. The bishop then proceeded according
to the ritual: a plate with an appropriate inscription was placed
under the stone ; and the bishop made a very effective address
to the people. The collection amounted to £55.
In the district of Illawarra the Rev. John Rigney is the
chaplain, and he resides at Wollongong. The attendance in the
temporary chapel there is 200. He officiates weekly at Dapto,
8 miles, with an attendance of 120; at Jamberoo, 25 miles,
attendance 80 ; at Shoalhaven, 50 miles, he officiates every month,
the communicants numbering 100. On an average the Rev. J.
Rigney travels 3252 miles during the year.


The Catholic Church at Campbelltown is a substantial stone
building capable of accommodating 500, and was erected before
Bishop Folding arrived in the colony. The interior of the church
was finished in a most tasteful manner by the then chaplain (the
Rev. J. A. Goold), now Archbishop of Melbourne. It is beauti-
fully situated on elevated ground, and commands a fine prospect
of the surrounding country. The school, the foundation of which
was laid and blessed on the 17th of March, was designed by the
chaplain to answer the twofold purpose of a school and chapel.
During the week days and some of the festivals mass was cele-
brated in it, because the church itself is rather distant from the
centre of the town. The Catholic population of Campbelltown
was, according to the census of 1836, no more than 287, and the
population of what is called the Hundred of Campbelltown, con-
tained in Appin, Menangle, Narellen and Cooke, was returned by
the same census as amounting to 810 persons ; but at the tiriie
when the school was built, in the year 1840, there must have
been a good many more Catholics. The chaplain attended five
stations monthly, at distances varying from eight to forty miles ;
during the year he travelled about 2000 miles in the discharge of
his clerical duties. The average attendance at each place was
from 100 to 250. The Communicants in Campbelltown were
about 50 at each mass. The Rev. C. Sumner, 0.5.8., was at this
time the chaplain of Appin, but resided in Campbelltown, attend-
ing three stations distant 15 to 30 miles, travelling in the year
about 1040 miles.
We extract the following from the Australian Chronicle of
March 24 :
“ Mr. Editor, —As an inhabitant of Campbelltown I am proud
that we anticipated the object of your remarks on the first
celebration of the day dedicated to the glorious patron of Ireland,
St. Patrick. Mass was celebrated at half-past ten o’clock by the
Rev. Mr. Goold, and an instructive address delivered by the
Right Rev. Bishop. The virtues of St. Patrick wore proposed for
the imitation of the hearers, and his extraordinary abstinence
and life of prayer were held up as a standard. These were
contrasted with the excess and dissipation too frequently to be
lamented as desecrating a day so holy, so full of grateful
recollections. The Bishop dwelt with much feeling on the
sufferings of Ireland, and called the attention of his hearers to
the fact that notwithstanding those sufferings Ireland had clung
to her faith—for thereon alone could she repose —this was the
anchor of her hope. Those sufferings had been to her as the press
in the vineyard, and the streams of life had been diffused amongst
o


her children throughout the habitable world. The feast of St.
Patrick filled the universe with joy. On this day Christianity
came to the nation who had returned her virginal fidelity to her
heavenly spouse undefiled, and with gratitude it acknowledged
the Apostle of Ireland to be the Apostle of the World.
At one o’clock his Lordship, accompanied by the Revs.
Messrs. Goold and Sumner and a very numerous assemblage of
Catholics and Protestants, proceeded to bless the foundation
of the New School, named after St. Patrick. The Bishop observed
that this ceremony was not indeed in the Ritual, but suggested
by a sense of propriety. “ Unless the Lord buildeth the house,
they labour in vain who build it.” After some remarks on the
value of education, its principal objects, and the end which ought
to be kept in view by those to whom the important task of
developing the moral and intellectual powers of the child is
committed, the Bishop congratulated the people of Campbelltown
on the public spirit evinced by them, and the glory they had
acquired in being the first to erect at their own expense a
schoolhouse, at once, in a moral and material sense, most credit-
able to them. His Lordship complimented them on the cordial
unanimity which seemed to animate all classes, and alluding to
the donor of the ground, who was then not expected to recover
he reminded those by whose exertions the present building was
to be erected of the gratification with which in their last hour,
they would recollect their donations to an object so praiseworthy.
The Bishop offered a prayer for the children, and then, surrounded
by the latter, implored a blessing on their parents and benefactors.
After this most affecting ceremony the Bishop gave his blessing
and the assemblage departed highly gratified.
A handsome collection, amounting to £265, was made on the
occasion.—Erigena.


CHAPTER VIII.
Wesleyan lamentations about the progress of Catholicity—The
Opening of St. Matthew’s Church, Windsor, 21st Oct. 1840 —
The Foundation stone of All Saint’s Church, Liverpool, laid
by Bishop Polding—Departure of Dr. Ullathorne for
Adelaide—The establishment of a Catholic Circulating
Library, under the patronage of his Lordship the Bishop —
Meeting held in the Catholic School-room, Castlereagh-street,
to devise means for the erection of a new church in Sydney,
to be dedicated to St. Patrick
We extract the following from a European Journal as an evidence
of the progress made by the church.
“Jonathan Crowder, a Wesleyan missionary, writing from
Madras, 16th March, 1839, says : —‘ Papists, with the reinforcement
which came out in December of an extra bishop and ten students,
are making a considerable impression at Madras.’ W. S. Fox, a
brother missionary, under date of 14th March, writes thus;—
‘ Our fears have not been a little excited of late by the arrival
and subsequent operations of a Roman catholic bishop, accom-
panied by several associates. That the papists are exerting
themselves in this country is an alarming fact; and if we may
judge from' the peculiar power of adaptation which distinguishes
popery, they are likely to form a numerous church.’ ”
J. McKenny, writing from Sydney, says, in allusion to
missionary efforts: —” This is not a question of mere pounds
shillings and pence, for it now assumes this form Shall
Australia be a protestant or a popish colony ? The number of
priests who are being sent out is quite frightful; lately eight
arrived in one vessel, and received from the Home Government
£l5O for their passage and outfit.”
In the Australian of the 19th May there is an account of
the conversion of T. C. Anstey, Esq., son of a respectable member
of the Legislative Council of Van Diemen’s Land. He went to
England to study with the view to become a clergyman of the
church of England. He commenced to study the grounds of both
churches, which ended in embracing catholicity in 1834. Since
his conversion he has contributed to the Dublin Review and other
catholic periodicals. He turned his attention to the legal pro-
fession and became a barrister-at-law in January 7, 1839. He
married Harriet, the second daughter of J. E. Strickland, Esq.,
of Loughlin House, Roscommon, Ireland.


In reference to the opening of St. Matthew’s Church in
Windsor, on 21st October, 1840, a gentleman writing to a
protestant friend in Sydney, states ; —“ Bishop Bolding and his
Vicar-General attended, with fourteen priests. I was highly
gratified at witnessing the grand ceremony of the consecration of
the Church. The Vicar-General preached on the subject of King
Solomon’s dedication of the temple ; his Scriptural allusions were
applied with peculiar fitness to the service of the day. To say
Dr. Ullathorne is a highly gifted individual, and endowed with
shining talent is merely to repeat public opinion, but I may add,
he turns the powers of his mind to the best advantage in using
them for the glory of God and the benefit of mankind. Dr.
Ullathorne is a quick-sighted investigator of the truth, and whilst
he grasps with firmness the evidences of Christianity, with
peculiar earnestness he invites his hearers to lay hold on them.
He is a sound logician and able champion of the Catholic Church.
The music was very grand : Mr. Bushelle and the band of the
80th Regiment attended Divine Service, as well as the officers,
with a number of respectable protestant families. I was present
at Vespers. The scene was imposing ; the greater part of the
service was performed by the Bishop, the Vicar-General, and
priests, in full chorus. Their voices were accompanied by a fine
mellow seraphim, presented as a gift from his Lordship to St.
Matthew’s Church. The Bishop closed the service with an appro-
priate discourse on the consecration of the Church, in which he
enforced, with persuasion and eloquence the essential doctrine of
the Gospel, without entering into metaphysics, and endeavoured
to convince his hearers that true religion is not only calculated to
promote the glory of God, but the real happiness of man. He
dwelt with energy on the virtue of charity, and charged his flock,
in their daily intercourse with their fellow men, to be friendly
with Christians of whatever denomination. osi sic omnes.
Within the walls of the Catholic Church Christ crucified is prac-
tised, and in all her services presented to the eye. Surely this
saving doctrine should induce protestants to overcome their
prejudices, and extend hands of love and charity to all catholics.
I shall communicate more fully upon this subject when we meet.
I remain, my dear sir, .... P.S.—I have had the honor of
an interview with Bishop Bolding. His lordship’s manners are
highly prepossessing, and, uniting the dignity which becomes the
Prelate with the humility of the true Christian, he is not only
revered but beloved by his flock.
I must not omit to make mention of the condition of catholics
in the County of Bathurst, at this time. The resident clergymen


were Dean O’Reilly and Rev. T. Slattery. In the town o£
Bathurst a church was in the course of erection ; the temporary
chapel was attended by from 90 to 100 persons. The Chaplain
attends twenty-six stations, once in the quarter, viz., Weagdon, 40
miles from Bathurst; Cabee, 60 ; Mudgee, 90 ; Jungy, 140 ; Mac-
quarie River, 120 ; Summers Hill, 30 ; Wellington, 100 ; Murrum-
hidgee, 120 ; Dubbo, 130 ; Weny Plains, 20 ; Groheinghon, 42 ;
Lachlan, 60 ; Billabulla, 60 ; Lachlan River, 80 ; Carryamy, 90 ;
Orpan’s Creek, 25 ; Todd Walls, 35 ; Vale of Clwydd, 42 ; Mount
Victoria, 52 ; Rose Vale, 40 : Cherry Tree Falls, 70 ; andßerigan,
50 miles.
In a letter Dean O’Reilly states : “ During my last journey
I was led to proceed on from one sheep or stock station to
another, until I found myself 350 miles from home. There were
no residences, but many stations, and numbers of catholics, who
often came from great distances, when they heard of me. Above
70 attended to receive the Sacraments. The Rev. T. Slattery per-
forms service at Bathurst, when the Dean is absent, and when he
returns, Father Slattery proceeds to visit eleven stations. The
sum subscribed towards the erection of the above church was
X 1,041 Bs. 6d.
The foundation stone of All Saints’ Church, Liverpool, was
laid by Bishop Folding on Sunday, the Bth November. There
was a large concourse of people, many of whom had come from
Sydney. The Rev. Mr. Marum, pastor of the district, was present.
The Bishop administered the Sacrament of Confirmation to a con
siderable number of the children. A Pontifical Mass was then
celebrated. His Lordship, before laying the stone, delivered a
most eloquent address. The collection amounted to £4O or £SO.
His Lordship, in addressing the assemblage again, expressed his
high gratification at their pious and zealous demeanour during
the day, and at the account given by their excellent pastor of the
vast improvement of their moral condition. He further said that
it would be one of his pleasing duties, if God spared him, after
his return from Europe, to consecrate the building of which the
foundation had been laid that day, to the honour and glory of
God and all his blessed saints. His Lordship concluded by giving
them his benediction, when the people cried out simultaneously
“ God bless you my Lord, God grant you a safe voyage,” and
immediately dispersed. The Chaplain in Liverpool is the Rev. R.
Marum. Service was performed in a room of the Government
Hospital, the average attendance being 200, of which the monthly
communicants number about twenty-four.


On the 28th May, the Vicar-General, Dr. Ullathorne, sailed
for Adelaide, and remained there for some weeks, making arrange-
ments for the building of churches, the appointment of clergy-
men, &c., &c.
A Catholic circulating library was established in Sydney during
the year 1840, under the patronage of his Lordship the Bishop.
Mr. E. J. Hawksley, who came to the Colony with the Rev. F.
Murphy, and who was a very competent person, was appointed
librarian. The books were kept in the Catholic Schoolroom,
Kent-street North.
The following advertisement appeared in the Australian
Chronicle of May 26, 1840 : —“ A meeting of the Catholics of
Sydney will be held at the Court House, Castlereagh-street, on
Monday the Ist prox., at seven o’clock in the evening, to appoint
a Committee, and to devise means for erecting a new Catholic
Church in Sydney. We understand that beautiful plans for the
new building will be submitted to the meeting. An excellent
site has been presented by Mr. Davis, and we are confident that
so praiseworthy an example will act as a stimulant to the rest of
our brethren to come forward liberally on so urgent an occasion.
We believe it is the intention of the Lord Bishop to dedicate the
new church to Ireland’s glorious apostle, St. Patrick. We say,
let St. Patrick’s new Church form a monument to future ages of
the piety of Erin’s sons, and of that zeal which, under every
variety of circumstances, they have evinced for that faith which
the great St. Patrick taught them.
The following is an account of the meeting. The Right Rev.
the Lord Bishop in the chair.
His Lordship, on opening the meeting said, as the object for
which they were assembled had been made public, he should
not detain them with any needless repetition, but should have
allowed them at once to proceed to business, were it not that
he felt himself justified in giving expression to the joy and grati-
fication which he felt on the occasion. He had long wished for
the erection of a church in that quarter of the town where it was
proposed to build the edifice now in contemplation, a district in
which, he was fully satisfied, the exertion of the harmonizing
influence of religion was more required than in any other. In
anticipation of the other advantages hereafter to follow, he was
not without hope that the very commencement of such a temple
in the quarter alluded to would tend, in a great degree, to im-
prove the moral condition of the people. He would, moreover,
observe that they had some reason to accuse themselves of a
defect in point of gratitude by having permitted so long a time


to lapse without the erection of some temple for God’s worship,
as a proof of their sense of the Divine goodness. At a vast
distance from their native soil, they had ample subject of thanks-
giving and gratitude to the Divine power for the glorious
privilege of enjoying the free worship of their Creator; a
privilege which their forefathers long and ardently struggled for
in vain. When therefore these bounties of the Almighty were
taken into consideration, gratitude alone would manifestly
demand the erection of some monument in testimony of their
feelings of religion; and what monument could be more proper
than a temple consecrated to divine worship, under the glorious
patronage of that great benefactor of mankind, St. Patrick; in
whose diadem it would form an additional jewel. The spire of
this temple would be, as it proudly stood, a perpetual and
unfailing monitor to each passer-by to lift up his mind to the
God who created him. It was a fact which needed no illustration,
that wherever the Irish people were spread, they invariably
carried with them their religion—the religion of their forefathers,,
in all its beauty and purity. The ground on which the proposed
new church would be erected was the gift of one who gloried in
the name of St. Patrick, and he hoped so good an example would
not be lost upon others ; but that if the present year should not
behold the laying of the foundation stone and the carrying up
of the spire, or, in other words, the commencement and execution
of the design, the terms of its completion might not exceed the
ensuing year (1841). Besides the ordinary method of collecting
subscriptions, it was their intention to form a society or fraternity
under the denomination of the “ Society of St. Patrick,” in order
to concentrate the efforts of the community at large towards the
accomplishing the great object in view; an object which would
be easily effected by these means Having said thus much, he
would not detain them any longer, but would request the gentle-
man who had undertaken to move the first resolution to proceed
to business.
Mr. Roger Therry, in moving the resolution, and in the course
of his remarks, said, in regard to Mr. Davis, that “ too much
praise could not be bestowed on Mr. Davis, who had made so noble
a commencement of the good work. He had devoted the early
portion of his life to pursuits and habits of industry, and he was
now in its decline applying the proceeds and fruits of that indus-
try to the best possible use to which they could be put —the
happiness and benefit of his fellow citizens and the service of
religion.” His allusion to St. Mary’s Cathedral was very happy.
His Lordship, he said, who was comparatively a new comer among


them, must be highly gratified by the rapid advances towards
completion made under his auspices by St. Mary’s Cathedral—an
edifice which, shortly before his Lordship’s arrival, they almost
despaired of seeing finished in their time. This and similar
results must be the best and most gratifying reward to that
respected prelate and the reverend gentlemen comprising his
ministry, for their zeal and devotion in the service of the people.
Those results were the fruits of the precepts which they taught,
and of that piety of which their lives afforded a practical
exemplification.
Mr. Therry here took the chair, and a vote of thanks was
accorded to his Lordship for his able and dignified conduct during
the proceedings of the evening.
His Lordship said that he received this mark of their kind-
ness with feelings of high gratification. He was proud to be
enabled to tell them they had discharged their duty. The general
proceedings and result of this meeting must have impressed every
one with a high sense of the unanimity which prevailed among
the professors of the catholic faith, and the generosity with which
each member stepped forward for the purpose of subscribing his
quota to further the cause of our holy religion. They had already
commenced the good work with every demonstration of a spirited
determination to bring it to a speedy and happy conclusion, which
desirable end would be greatly furthered by the efforts and
known zeal of the highly respected reverend gentleman whom
they had just now chosen as their president; whose name was
hallowed by both poor and rich wherever his ministry had led
him, and in whose praise ho would have said a great deal more
were he not then present. By the united energies and zeal of the
new fraternity, he felt certain that in a comparatively short time
such a sum would be raised as would at once be a source of grati-
fication and astonishment. He had not the honour himself to be
a native of Ireland ; but if he might be excused for making use
of what might be technically termed a bull, he was an Irishman
born in England. He perfectly recollected that which he con-
sidered the dearest compliment he had ever received, was from
the lips of a poor Irish woman—“ Ah! my lord, you have an
Irish heart! ” —and blessed be God ! he had an Irish heart, under
the influence of which he had ever lived among his fellow men,
and under the influence of which he would remain until death.
He would now dismiss them with his thanks and blessing, and an
injunction, when they were asked |by others as to what they had
done at the meeting, to answer them by a desire that they would
go and do likewise.


It was then moved by Mr. Callaghan, barrister-at-law, and
seconded by Mr. Roger Murphy, That a society be formed under
the designation of “ St. Patrick’s Society,” for the purpose of
collecting funds for the erection of the said church. The Rev.
Mr. Murphy was appointed by the Meeting president, and the
Rev. G. H. Gregory, treasurer. In the course of a few minutes
the collection amounted to £1,012.
CHAPTER IX.
Preparations of the Catholic Committee of St. Mary’s for the
Departure of Bishop Polding and Dr. Ullathorne for England
—Presentation of addresses to Bishop Polding and Dr.
Ullathorne, and Rev. H. G. Gregory —Departure of Bishop
Polding and party for England—The great estimation and
respect in which the two catholic gentlemen, John Hubert
Plunkett, Attorney-General of New South Wales, and Roger
Therry, Esq., Commissioner of the Court of Requests, were
held by the inhabitants of the Colony—The state of the Colony,
Religion, and Education, when Bishop Polding left, in the
year 140—An Abridgement of the reply of Dr. Ullathorne
to Judge Burtons Book.
For some time previous to the departure of Bishop Folding for
Europe, the Catholic Committee were engaged in getting up a
Memorial, as a token of the respect in which the Bishop and his
Vicar-General were universally held. On the Sunday before the
Bishop left, he administered the sacrament of Confirmation to a
number of children and adults. A Pontifical High Mass was
celebrated in the cathedral, at which the Rev. Dean Brady
officiated as assistant priest, the Very Rev. the Vicar-General and
Rev. F. Murphy as deacons, and the Rev. Joseph Platt as sub-
deacon. The Rev. Messrs. Mahony, Lynch and Grant assisted in
surplices and stoles. After the gospel his lordship delivered a
most affecting farewell address to his clergy and people.
In the evening at the Old Court House, Castlereagh-street,
the addresses were read to his lordship, the Right Rev. Dr.
Folding, and his Vicar-General, Dr. Ullathorne. Never was there
a more numerous and respectable meeting than that assembled
on the occasion. The Attorney-General, J. H. Plunkett, Esq.,
was called to the chair. Mr. Commissioner Therry commenced by
reading the address to the Very Rev. Dr. Ullathorne, as follows
Very Rev. Sir, —The moment of your departure for England
will, we trust, be not deemed an unsuitable one for receiving the


assurance of our grateful acknowledgements for the many and
important services you have rendered to the catholics of the
Australian colonies. On your first coming amongst us you found
but one roofless church before you: the religious wants of the
people for many years had been supplied by only one excellent
clergyman; and many thousands of the people had heretofore
lived and died in the interior of this colony without any religious
consolation whatever. If brighter prospects now present them-
selves ; if we see a hierarchy established on our shores; if we see
every populous district of the colony provided with good and
pious clergymen ; if we witness under the genial influence of their
precept and example, a moral regeneration and improvement
prevailing among their respective flocks ; if we behold the institu-
tion of the Sisters of Charity, famed throughout Europe for the
great religious benefits it has dispensed, extending its usefulness
to this colony, so exigent of its pious services, believe us Very
Rev. Sir, we are duly sensible that these great services and daily
augmenting advantages, are mainly to be attributed to your
active and devoted exertions on our behalf, both here and in
Europe; to the reliance which your character procured on the
truth of your representations, as to the great want of religious
aid and instruction under which these colonies suffered, and to
the persevering assiduity with which you left no source unex-
plored that could be available to our advantage.
With hearts full of gratitude for these great and important
services; with an earnest hope of soon seeing you again amongst
us in the prosecution of your pious labours ; and with a confidence
that, whether absent or present, we shall live, as past experience
assures us we have lived, in your regard and affections—we bid
you a respectful, a grateful, and an affectionate farewell!
We beg your permission to accompany this address with a
small token of our sincere respect and esteem.
The tribute of respect consisted of a snuff-box, valued at
£6O, with the following inscription; —Presented to the Very
Reverend William Ullathorne, Doctor in Divinity, and Yicar-
General of New Holland, as a testimony of the affection of the
Catholics in the Colony; and their gratitude for his high services
rendered to their religion and religious liberty; of regret at his
departure for Europe, and of their anxiety for his safe and speedy
return. November, 1840
Dr. Ullathorne’s reply : —My dear friends. I thank you most
sincerely. This is one of those rare moments in this earthly exist-
ence which drowns at once the recollection of a great many of its
trials. If the feelings of my own breast could enlarge themselves to
the extent of all your kindnesses and your many indulgences in my


regard of which this token is only the latest expression, I would
endeavour to thank you worthily. As it is, I return your kindness
and good wishes, as the best response lam capable of. It is a
consoling reflection that, whilst in all other things I leave this
colony as poor a man as when I first came to it, I am amply rich
in your good opinions and warm affections. For these, and all
those good works which I have seen done amongst you by the
grace of God, I can never be sufficiently grateful. That I should
have been an instrument, however by nature unworthy and unfit,
of any part of so great a work of good, as the one to which you
refer, will always fill me with happy recollections. But when,
my dear friends, you see and bear witness to any qualities in me,
except a very simple and earnest intention of serving you, and a
wish and endeavour to cherish and protect your faith, and to
enlarge and quicken the growth of your charity, I there recognize
the fallacy of your kindness. Warm and earnest in your good
affections, you believe those qualities to exist in your friend and
pastor which you well know ought to exist, and imagine he does
possess what you wish and desire he should possess ; and it is my
duty to pray that henceforward I may possess them. If on the
occasion of the departure of our beloved bishop, I condole with
you on the temporary loss of the presence of one, it is only the
loss of his presence—his spirit will continue with you —whom
you so truly and justly venerate; I would also console you with
the reflection that his absence is needful for your own best
interests, and that it will not be of a very long continuance; and
I would cheer you by directing forward your hopes towards the
happy period of his return, which may you all live, and live
worthily and happily, to see accomplished; and may his coming
again amongst you, as it will, be crowned with joy and benedic-
tions. For myself, whilst I most heartily thank you, and trust
that I shall live in your recollections, as you will continue to live
in mine, I am desirous of laying myself under new obligations by
most earnestly recommending myself to your prayers.
His lordship was addressed in the following words:—On the
eve of your lordship’s departure, we beg leave to express our
warmest wishes for your safe and prosperous passage to England,
and our earnest hope for your early return to us. Whilst we
deeply deplore even your temporary absence, our regret is subdued
and softened by the conviction that your visit to Europe is
prompted by a sense of duty, and by that devoted and untiring
zeal for our welfare, of which we have so many and unmistakable
manifestations. After, the five years you have exercised the
pastoral charge in these colonies with mild and firm efficacy, it


must be gratifying to you as it is to us, to look back on the great
benefits that have been conferred on this community, and of
which, under Divine Providence, you have been the chief and
chosen instrument. The many churches founded and consecrated
by your lordship; your frequent visits into all parts of the
colony; the dispersion and establishment of a zealous clergy
throughout the principal districts of New South Wales; the
impartial attention paid to all classes of your congregation,
without any distinction, except that where assistance was most
required and needed, there it was largely bestowed; and not
least, the truly paternal solicitude you have shown towards the
orphan, and the affection with which you have cherished the little
children of your flock, are among the enduring monuments
of those useful labours, by which, in your high station, you have
been distinguished, and which have made an indelible impression
upon hearts not formed to be ungrateful. As it is under the deep
impression of sentiments such as these that we bid your lordship
farewell now, you will not be surprised or displeased that, next
to the reverence and affection we entertain towards you, the
feeling uppermost is the desire that you may be re-united to your
flock at the earliest moment your sense of duty and zeal for our
service will permit. We beg leave to accompany this address
with a small token of our gratitude and veneration.
This tribute consisted of a Treasury Bill for £4OO.
His lordship replied as follows; —Wishes so warm and
generous, on the part of a people whose affections cannot be
commanded, but may be obtained, I do feel sincere gratification
in accepting. I knew not until the period of separation ap-
proached, how strong had become the bonds which united us.
Only indeed a sense of duty the most cogent, and a conviction
that my services elsewhere will prove more generally useful to
my extensive charge, could influence me to consent to be tempo-
rarily absent from you. May your prayers for my speedy return
be accomplished. Your kindness has attributed much to me Ido
not deserve. Patient enduring was the glory and merit of a
preceding generation. The season of mercy and grace has been
mercifully ours. Suffering and spiritual privation had disposed
you to receive with gratitude the enlarged means of religious
consolation Providence granted to you through us, the humble
instrument of the divine benignity; and the gracious dispensation
has not fallen on an unworthy soil. In the churches now in the
course of erection; in the improved habits of our people; in the
various charitable and religious institutions which have sprung
into existence, in a space of time almost instantaneous; there is,


surely, a demonstration, that beneath a surface unfortunately
made the ground of rash surmises and rude theories, there did
exist a bounteous source of moral worth, which only required to
be opened to the clear day, to diffuse streams of virtuous impulses,
of noble and disinterested well-doing, throughout our beautiful
land.
My labours and their effects you value too highly. The
zealous co-operation of the Vicar-General and of the clergy must
be held in grateful remembrance. My devotedness to my beloved
country, my determination to use every exertion that can tend to
raise and establish on a lofty and imperishable basis her religious,
her social and moral character, words cannot express. Let the
past be an earnest of the future ; and whilst I am absent continue
by your peaceable determined course to co-operate with me.
The calumny of the graceless may fall undeserving of note. No
opposition, statement, or misrepresentation detrimental to your
social or religious rights, which might derive importance from the
station of him who utters it, must pass unnoticed. Cultivate
peace, —I use the words of an apostle—as much as in you
lies have peace with all men, until the harmonious union
which gloriously distinguishes our body shall, in the extinction
of prejudice, of bigotry, or of unseemly strife, pervade the entire
of the social order of New South Wales. I accept with thank-
fulness this token of your affectionate regard; may the Almighty
dispenser of all good bestow upon you every blessing.
The ladies of Sydney on this occasion presented the Lev. H.
G. Gregory with a handsome and valuable ring, accompanied
with an address. These are the words of the address: —
“Rev. and Dear Sir, —We, the Catholic ladies of Sydney,
having observed that our husbands and fathers have their feelings
entirely absorbed with the lamented departure of our excellent
Bishop and his Vicar-General, cannot suffer you, reverend Sir, to
leave our shores without in some feeble manner testifying our
sense of your piety and zeal for the honor and glory of God
and for our spiritual welfare during the time the Catholics of
Sydney have had the happiness of enjoying your pastoral care.
Wo bow to the will of God, which for great and good purposes
separates us from our pastor for a time, trusting that that time
will be short, and that after a speedy and safe voyage and a
successful mission, you will soon be restored to a people who till
then shall never cease to pray for that event and for your
welfare.
We beg to accompany this address with a small tribute of
our respect and reverence.
Reverend and Dear Sir, farewell.”


The reply of the Rev. Mr. Gregory
“ I receive the token of affection with sincere gratification.
It is an emblem of that union between pastor and people, which
no circumstance can alter, no distance dissever. Accept my
thanks, and add to the favor conferred by remembering me in
your prayers.”
The chair being vacated by the Attorney-General, the Rev.
Francis Murphy was requested to take it, when a vote of thanks
was proposed by Mr. Commissioner Therry and seconded by John
Ryan Brennan, Esq., P.M.: “ That the thanks of the meeting are
due, and are hereby presented, to the Attorney-General for his
dignified conduct in the chair.” Mr. Plunkett briefly returned
thanks, and expressed his gratification at having had the honor
to preside over so respectable a meeting, assembled on so
interesting an occasion.
At half-past eleven o’clock a.m. on the Monday, following,
I6th November, 1840, the Catholic Committee accompanied
the Bishop from his residence to the Cathedral, where he
read at the altar the beautiful prayers appointed to be read to
implore the blessing of heaven on their voyage. A procession
was formed of the whole people, under the direction of the
Committee. There were many thousands in it. The girls of the
Catholic Schools were first, the whole of them dressed in white;
then came the boys, followed by the congregation walking two
and two; the Bishop and his Clergy formed the rear. The
procession marched along Hyde Park, Macquarie-street, Bent-
street, and Macquarie Place. When they arrived at the jetty on
the Circular Quay the people divided, and the Bishop, Clergy, and
Committee went to the boats. His Lordship and the Rev. Mr.
Gregory proceeded in the Government boat. Dr. Ullathorne and
the clergy occupied the boat of the Crusader, furnished by Captain
Inglis. The vessel in which the Bishop and the Very Rev. Dr.
Ullathorne, Rev. H. Gregory, and the Bishop’s Chaplain embarked,
was a brig, by name “ Orion,” Captain Saunders, master, bound
for Valparaiso; in their company were three young gentlemen,
Messrs. Chambers, Therry, and Carter, going to Europe for a
collegiate education. The brig was towed to the Heads by the
splendid steamship “ Clonmel,” and this steamer was filled with
upwards of 400 persons desirous of testifying to the last the deep
respect they had for their beloved Bishop. It was remarked by
the press at the time of the departure of Bishop Folding ; “ That
not only every Catholic, but every Christian ought to sympathise
in the sorrow at the absence of him who had given by his
presence and labours a moral dignity to our adopted land, formerly
represented as the abortion of nations, but now the abode of a fine


people, increasing in the enjoyment of a high degree of physical
and moral health. If ever a bishop was worthy to be called a
pastor of his flock, it is the Right Reverend Dr. Folding.”
I certainly would not he doing justice to my narrative were
I to pass by unnoticed the worth of two most estimable Catholic
gentlemen, officers of the Government, who flourished in our
community at this time ; I mean John Hubert Plunkett,
Attorney-General of New South Wales, and Roger Therry, Esq.,
Commissioner of the Court of Requests. They were conscientious
Catholics, and lived up to their religious principles. They never
compromised their religion, and were ever ready to speak and act
in defence of the faith of their forefathers, and of their country,
Ireland. They gave all the weight of their character and
position for the benefit of religion and charity. Mr. Plunkett
was for many years Attorney-General, and he went home on
leave of absence in the beginning of the year 1841. But before
he left the colony, in such great respect was he held by his legal
brethren, that they entertained him at a dinner. The Chief
Justice, Sir James Dowling presided, and there was present
Judge Stephens. The Governor, Sir Geo. Gipps, also honored the
festive board by his presence. The Governor, in returning
thanks when his health was proposed, said: “He felt extremely
happy in meeting such a large and respectable company of the
colonists of New South Wales, of every grade and of every
persuasion, who, laying aside all other motives, had met together
that evening to pay a tribute of respect to a public officer who
had discharged his great, important, and arduous duties with the
highest degree of impartiality and firmness; he felt extremely
happy to make one amongst them in bearing testimony to the
worth, ability, and integrity of that officer.” The Chief Justice,
Sir James Dowling said : “It was a pleasing reflection to Mr.
Plunkett, notwithstanding the very peculiar community in
which he lived, all men bore ample testimony to the just, upright,
manly, and impartial manner in which he had discharged the
duties belonging to his station; after many years of trial Mr.
Plunkett had passed through the crucible of public opinion
without a stain being cast upon him.” All the gentlemen present
at the banquet bore similar testimony to the high character of
Mr. Plunkett.
Before the departure of Mr. Plunkett, on leave of absence, a
handsome testimonial was presented to him in the shape of
several pieces of silver plate, and on each piece was engraved his
family crest, which is a trotting horse, with the motto “ Festina
Lente The silver service was purchased by public subscription
and cost about £4OO.


Roger Therry, Esq., was appointed Attorney-General, during
the absence of Mr. Plunkett. Mr. Therry had been Commissioner
of the Court of Requests for eleven years, and discharged the
onerous duties of his office with great rectitude and ability.
When he was promoted to be Attorney-General, the public
expressed their satisfaction for his past services, by presenting
him with a massive silver service, which cost £SOO. The salver
had the following inscription engraved on it, with Mr. Thcrry’s
crest, a lion rampant, bearing a cross, with the motto, “ E Gruce
Leo.” The words of the inscription were the following : —“ This
salver with an urn, dinner, dessert and tea-service, and other
articles, forming a service of plate, were presented to Roger
Therry, Esquire, Her Majesty’s Attorney General, by the people
of New South Wales, as a mark of their esteem and respect on
the occasion of his retiring from the office of Commissioner of the
Court of Requests, the duties of which he discharged in that
colony for a period of eleven years, to the entire satisfaction of
the community.”
Judge Burton, who published in London “an account of the
state of religion and education in New South Wales,” returned to
the colony in the year 1841. His party prepared a banquet for
him and the Governor was invited to attend, but he declined, “on
account of his independent position as a judge in regard to the
Executive ; and because the circumstances were different from
those of the Attorney-General, Mr. Plunkett, who was leaving the
colony, whilst Judge Burton was returning to office.” It was
very wise of Sir George Gipps to decline the invitation, if he had
attended, there would have been some reason to believe that the
ruler of the colony gave countenance and support to the false
statements, sophistical arguments, and derogatory remarks of
Judge Burton’s religious history.
The Judge must have been terribly taken by surprise when
he returned to find that all his visions of a dominant church were
baseless fabrics ; he found Sir Richard Bourke’s Church Act, which
placed the principal religious bodies on an equality, working
admirably, and giving to each denomination a share of the public
revenue. The Catholics whom he desired to be the last in status
before the law, had, since his absence vastly increased in numbers
and there were two most efficient catholic officers of the Crown.
AVhen Bishop Polding left the colony at the close of the year
1840, he left the church in a flourishing condition. The Catholic
population then amounted to nearly 20,000 souls; Sydney
contained 14,000 Catholics. The entire population of the colony
from a return published by the Government in 1839 amounted to
114,386 the population of Sydney was 40,000 and contained


nearly 14,000 Catholics. There were only in the year 1835 the
Bishop, the Vicar-General, and eight priests. When he left they
numbered nineteen priests and a convent of the Sisters of Charity.
There were only three churches commenced at the time of his
arrival in 1835 ; now nine churches were completed and six in
course of erection. In various places small chapels were erected,
and some not finished. The total number of churches and chapels
amounted to twenty-five.
The distribution of the priests was as follows: —In New
South Wales there were twenty-four ; in Van Dieman’s Land
three ;in South Australia three ;in Norfolk Island two. The
holy communions during the year 1840 were 23,130 and the
confirmations 3,158. Two institutions had been established
which were a great help to our holy religion, viz., the Catholic
Institute of Great Britain and the Society for the Propagation of
the Faith. I have given an account of these.
An object of the greatest solicitude to the Bishop was 'the
seminary intended to supply the mission with priests, and to
educate the children of the respectable classes in the higher
studies. St. Mary’s Seminary was established in the year 1838.
In the seminary when the Bishop left there were, six ecclesias-
tical students, twenty boarders, and twenty day-scholars, and the
bishop left detailed directions, both as to the scholastic and
economical arrangements of the establishment. The course of
classical studies comprised the study of Greek and Latin authors,
regular instructions in reading and elocution, writing and
arithmetic in all its branches, history sacred and profane,
geography and the use of the globes. The elder students received
lessons in Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Land Surveying,
Book-keeping, &c. The seminary was under the 'management of
the Very Rev. Francis Murphy, and the Rev. P. Farrelly, President.
The Catholic orphans were more under the care of the
church. Up to the year 1836, they were in Government orphan
schools, and taught the Protestant catechism, but the Bishop in
his own name and that of the Catholics petitioned the Govern-
ment, remonstrating against the injustice. The petition was
favourably received. In the following year the sum of £IOOO was
voted for the maintenance of the Catholic orphan children. A
large house in the suburbs of Sydney, known as Waverley House,
was rented, and there they were in the meantime located, under
Catholic guidance. When the Bishop shortly before his departure
for Europe saw the Governor, he told him that he had in contem-
plation to erect a large, commodious building in Parramatta for
the lodgement of the Catholic orphans,
p


In the year 1841 there were six public schools, Catholic, and
some private schools, indeed in all the principal towns and
localities existed now good schools under Catholic direction.
In Sydney about three times in the year, the children made their
first communion in St. Mary’s cathedral with great solemnity.
This imposing ceremony, made by the children with much piety
and fervour, had the best effect on the minds of the parents and
others, and usually a great many conversions of hardened sinners
took place. The gentle expostulations of the fervent children
drew their parents to the sacraments, which had been abandoned
by them for many years.
For the information of the readers I will relate how the
Catholic schools were supported at this time and previously by
the Government. To premise : there were 35 schools, primary,
established in various places of the colony by the Church and
School Corporation, and these were charged on the Estimates for
the year 1834, at £2,756. In these schools were children ,of all
denominations, Catholic, Wesleyan, and Presbyterian, and the
only catechism allowed to be taught was that of the Church of
England. Now observe the contrast, in regard to the support
given by the Government in those days to the Catholic schools.
The first Catholic school was established in the time of Sir
Thomas Brisbane, in 1822. In the year 1828 the Government
only expended on the Catholic schools £6B 35.; the Protestant
schools of the same character received Government support to the
amount of £2650 15s 2d. The Estimates for the year 1833 were
for Catholic schools £350, for Church of England schools of the
same class £2,232 Is 4d. The sum of £BOO was voted for the
Roman Catholic schools in the year 1834. The Estimates for
public education in the year 1841, which were laid before the
Council were, for Protestant education £6,106 0s 7d, and the total
for Catholic education £1,346 14s 4d. There was voted by the
Legislative Council in the year 1834, the sum of £2,300 for the
site and buildings of King’s School, Parramatta, and the annual
salary of £lOO towards the support of the head-master ; this was
exclusively a Protestant establishment.
The system of public education which was followed since
1836 was one which was introduced by Governor Bourke, and
similar to the system of education established in Ireland through
Lord Stanley. By this system, no religious instruction was given,
(that being left to the ministers of the different denominations,
and parents of the children) select portions of the Scriptures were
read This system of education was carried in the Council by a
majority of eight to four.


In the year 1840, Sir George Gipps, in a minute explanatory
of his views on the all important subject of education, found
fault with the present system. He said that, “ Although
apparently based upon the principle of equality, it was very
unequal in practice. The rule is : —‘ That the assistance given to
any school shall be measured by the sum which is raised for its
support by private contributions ’; but it is well known that
exceptions from this rule are made in favour of certain schools,
solely because they have been established longer than others—
exceptions which I cannot consider to be founded on any principle
of utility, expediency, or justice.” In the same minute the
Governor proposed a plan of public instruction which he intended
to carry into effect. According to this plan a public school was
to be built in Sydney, and two others in two principal towns of
the interior. The system he intended to establish was on the
principle of the British and Foreign School Society, and for this
purpose £3OOO were placed on the Estimates, and £lOOO for the
Catholic schools, because the Catholics could not conscientiously
send their children to those schools. The Governor at the same
time expressed himself favourable to the Irish National system.
This system was afterwards established in the colony.
The population of the Colony when Bishop Bolding left for
Europe in 1840 had increased to 129,463, and in the year
following, 1841, a census was taken by the Government of the
entire population of New South Wales and Port Philip, and the
result showed a total of 130,856. The population of Port
Philip District at this time was 11,728. In the year 1836, the
year after the arrival of the Bishop, the number of the population
of New South Wales was only 77,096. At the time of the census
in 1836 the Catholics numbered 21,898 souls; but when the
census was taken in 1841 they had increased to 35,690. The
members of the Church of England were reckoned at 73,725.
The rapid increase of the population in such a comparatively
short time was chiefly owing to the streams of emigration which
had poured into the Colony. A statistical account of the
emigration for five years, ending with 1829, was shown by
a Parliamentary paper published in the year 1832. It stated
that immigrants had been introduced into the respective Colonies
of Australia, viz., New South Wales, Van Dieman’s Land, and
Swan River, in the following numbers ; In 1825, 485; in 1826,
903 : in 1827, 715; in 1828, 1056; in 1829, 2016.
In the y T ear 1840 it was reported to Lord John Russell by
the Agent-General for Emigration that there had arrived in
Sydney, from Ist January, 1838, to 30th June, 1839, in Govern-
ment ships, emigrants to the number of 14,644.


The Agent for the Patriotic Association of Sydney, Mr.
Buller, in a speech made by him in the Imperial Parliament
in the year 1840, on colonial affairs, stated that the number of
free emigrants amounted annually to 10,000, for the last five or
ten years. He remarked at the same time that it was no longer
practicable to make New South Wales a penal colony, that the
convict labour was inadequate to supply the wants of the colonists.
The chief source of immigration was the Land Fund, i. e., the
proceeds of the sale of lands in the Colony, and the Government
was pledged to devote that revenue for the purpose of bringing
emigrants to the Colony. There were two systems of emigration,
one called the bounty system, the other assisted emigration; but
both depended for the means of being carried out on the land fund.
By the bounty system Government orders were issued, on condition
that those who took them up should send to the Colony eligible
emigrants, according to the orders received, and these orders Were
made payable when the emigrants were landed. The candidates
for such bounties were entrusted with the selection of the
emigrants and with whatever related to the arrangements of the
voyage. By the system called assisted emigration, which was the
Government system, the Government took all the responsibility;
by their agents the emigrants were selected, and the greatest care
was taken that they were eligible as to character, health, and
employment. The vessel was chartered by the Government and
provided with all the necessaries. All was effected through the
supervision of the Agent-General for Emigration. The Govern-
ment system gave satisfaction, but there was a popular outcry
against the bounty system, which had been, it was alleged,
woefully abused. Those who took up the bounty orders sold
them at a premium, and it was said this premium was deducted
by lessening the provisions and comforts of the emigrants. The
emigrants of some ships were starved, and, horrible to relate, some
females, it is said, bartered their virtue for food. The Govern-
ment interfered, and rigid conditions were enforced for bringing
out the emigrants by the Government system.
Some colonial authorities at this time objected to Irish immi-
gration, because the Irish were contentious and quarrelsome, and in
several respects an undesirable class to introduce into the Colony;
nay, that some were sent out who had aided and abetted in murder.
A Commission was appointed to enquire into the use which was
made of the land fund and the working of the emigration system.
The Commission in their report vindicated the Irish emigrants.
It stated; “We cannot quit the subject of the alleged prejudice, to
which we have had accidentally to advert, without expressing our
regret at its existence, and we hope that no public officer will permit


himself or be suffered by the authorities over him to give it any
countenance. We can only say that as regards their conduct on
board ship, judging by the records of the Agent-General’s Office,
no people seem to be more susceptible to the influence of kind
and judicious treatment than the Irish, or more capable of being
carried out in good health; and certainly none evinced better
feelings at the conclusion of the voyage towards those under
whose care they have been safely guided to their destination.”
Mr. Pinnock, the immigration agent, in a report which he drew
up at the instance of the Home Government, was charged with
having given a high colouring to the case of certain immigrants
from Ireland. He had said that these people were concerned in
the murder of a magistrate, and that, notwithstanding, they had
been sent out as emigrants by the Irish Government. An inquiry
was made, and it was found that such were not the real facts.
For these false allegations Pinnock was removed from his office
of immigration agent. That is not all ; but the Immigration
Committee of the Legislative Council, in the year 1841, in their
report, wished to exclude Catholics from participating in the
general benefit of the land fund for immigration. The Right
Rev. Dr. Broughton, the Protestant Bishop, was chairman of the
Immigration Committee. In September of this year there was a
public meeting in Sydney, to take into consideration this report
of the Committee, Dr. Bland in the chair, A petition was laid
before the meeting, in which the designs of the Committee were
exposed in regard to Her Majesty’s Catholic subjects; and the
petitioners asserted that “the spirit of sectarianism had been
created and encouraged by Bishop Broughton, who was chairman
of the Immigration Committee.”
Judge Burton’s Book, and Reply to it, by Dr.
Ullathorne. 1840.
There issued from the London Press in the year 1840 a book
entitled “The State of Religion and Education in New South
Wales, by Judge Burton, one of the Judges of the Supreme
Court,” in that colony. The subjects of the book are very well
divided, and there is in it a great deal of useful information: the
letters, petitions, and statistical statements in the Appendix are
valuable, and must have taken considerable time to collect.
But he by no means gives an impartial account of the progress of
religion in regard to the different denominations—and in many
instances he suppresses the truth; he is constantly insisting on the


prerogatives of the church of England, and how she had been
unfairly dealt with by both governor and government; that the
Roman catholics had been preferred in the distribution of their
favours. He says the church of England “is a part of the State
itself,” that the fundamental laws of England became the laws of
the colony when the settlement was made ; and by one of these
fundamental laws the church of England became the established
church of the colony ; “ for nearly fifty years,” the judge states,
“ no other denomination of Christians was acknowledged by the
government as an object of its support, beyond the limits of a
charitable tolerationand it was in this spirit of “ charitable
toleration” that the government assisted the catholics and dis-
senters. He extols to the skies the zeal and labours of the bishop
and clergy of the church of England; but he has not much to
record of the zeal and labours of the church of England for the
poor prisoners during those fifty years. What has become of the
Apostolic zeal of the church of England ? He calls her the true
Apostolic church, when, although “ part of the State itself,” she
could not succeed in sending more than one clergyman to ad-
minister to the religious wants of the colony, and he in the end
left the church and became a Moravian. When religion was left
in such a condition by the Apostolic church, it was time for a
separation between Church and State. Here is the description
which the judge gives of the state of religion in the early years
of the colony : —“ Those indeed who should (had they been so
disposed) have set about laying the foundation of their city in
righteousness, were far otherwise engaged : deeply immersed in
selfish pursuits, they were seeking their own future wealth in the
means placed at their disposal of unpurchased lands and convict
labour, of mercenery barter and petty dealings with their
inferiors. That most pernicious article of traffic, which came soon
afterwards to be the ordinary circulating medium of the colony
(spirituous liquor), was early resorted to in exchange for the
necessaries of life; in the purchase of valuable property; in
payment for labour, and as a reward offered by government for
public services. Thus were the foundations of the new colony
laid in avarice and drunkenness There must also be noted the
indifference of those in authority to religious matters, so remark-
able in the single fact, that one of the earlier governors had to be
informed by the clergyman that five or six persons only attended
divine service, and that it was then that he determined to go to
church himself, and stated that “he expected that the example
would be followed by the people.” The church Apostolic—the
church of England—could not complain but that ample provision


at least in land, had been made at an early time; for His
most gracious Majesty King George the Third gave instructions
to the first governor, Governor Phillip, to allot in each township,
which should he marked out, 400 acres for maintenance of the
minister, and 200 was for the maintenance of a schoolmaster; and
this was done by his Majesty only two years after the founding
of the colony. When the Grown was so favourably disposed to
religion and education, surely it would not have been a difficult
matter for the heads of the State Church to obtain from the
government of the day all the aid which they required for sending
to the colony ministers of religion, catechists and schoolmasters.
Since King George the Third and his advisers had such a paternal
regard for the sacred object of religious education, I think from
their want of sympathy and support in the case of the poor convict,
in his spiritual wants, the church of England looses all claim to
Apostolic zeal. The King of England, George IY., in his paternal
solicitude for the endowment of a dominant church in the colony,
was extravagant in his royal goodness. In the year 1825, under the
royal sign manual, instructions were sent to his Excellency the
Governor, “to make out and set apart to the body politic and
corporate, in each and every county, hundred, &c., into which
they may from time to time divide the said territory or tract of
land, comprising one seventh in extent and value of all the lands
in each and every such county, to be henceforward called and
known by the name of the clergy and school estate of such county.”
The most extensive powers were given to the corporation,
which was appointed by the home government, for the manage-
ment of the church and school lands in the colony of New South
Wales; and the laws and regulations were exceedingly exact and
comprehensive. The intention seemed to be to establish the
church of England on such a basis in the colony, which would
make her independent, so far as regards temporalities, in all times
to come. Notwithstanding, it was deemed wise in five years
after, for His Majesty, George IV., to revoke the letters patent.
The corporation was legally dissolved 28th August, 1833. During
the time of the existence of the corporation the agent for the
Church and School Lands, Henry Fisher, Esq., states in his return
for Lands, that the amount of land granted to the late Church
and School Corporation was 435,765 acres 2 roods 11 perches, and
they sold 15,993 acres 34 perches ; what remained unsold reverted
to the crown.
Dr. Ullathorne in his reply to judge Burton makes some very
judicious observations in regard to the magnificent endowments
made to the church of England, and shows clearly what likely


would be the consequence if such an establishment continued to
exist. He writes : —“ How this vast scheme of church aggrandize-
ment, unparalleled in the world’s history, would have been
ultimately found to operate ; how this monstrous monopoly of the
soil, one seventh in extent and value, in one continuous and
unbroken block, of each individual county—spreading like
Briareus, from one body and one will, a hundred strong and
mighty arms, over all the face of the country, how this would
have affected the interests and the industry of the farmer, the
grazier, and the merchant; how the continually increasing weight
and accumulating influence of such a corporation, which must
soon have become an exclusive, a close-shut, and a secretly
working ecclesiastical oligarchy, not merely claiming a tithe of
produce in this place and that, but one seventh of the firm and
solid earth—to which mere form the remainder must have
continually alluviated, whilst all that lay along dts endless
boundaries would be at his mercy —what weight and influence, I
say, such an ecclesiastical oligarchy must ultimately have ex-
ercised ; on one side, against the liberty and independence of the
civil government, and, on the other side, against the freedom and
rights of the people : above all, how uneven the pressure of such
an all-pervading, illimitable, and irresistible domination ; and the
more wealthy the more corrupt it must have become; the more
sacred in its own self-assumption, the more blind-sighted and
terrible in its zeal: how, under such a church domination, the
unfortunate catholic, and equally unfortunate dissenter, would be
reduced to worse than Egyptian bondage. All this, with various
other vistas of but gloomy promise that seem opening up to
contemplation in these temporal regions of spiritual domination,
belong rather to the pursuits of the politician, the economist and
the philosopher, than to the consideration of the present writer.
A clergyman may, however, be allowed to observe, that the pow';r
of this corporation church would not ultimately become a spirt-
ualizing influence : it would be temporal and earthly, not heavenly.
Separated from the people by independence, raised above them
by affluence, enjoying the luxuries of life by right, and assimilated
into an exclusive society; whilst the good things of this world,
combined with a natural desire to advance their families, would
supply continual temptation to ambition and intrigue. Such
an incorporate clergy would possess but little in common
with the feelings, the wants, the cares and the thoughts of the
great mass of the population. Their own connexions would be
proud of their alliance, but between the clergy and the people
the mutual relations would be at points of repulsion, and not of


sympathy and attraction. Nor would the system tend the most
effectually, at last, to secure the continual increase of their
numbers. We all know how corporate bodies work with personal
interests : the fewer the numbers the greater the share of spoils :
each additional claimant demands a new sacrifice from the pos-
sessor. Then again, we should have gradually created a sort of
clerical caste, a body of Christian Brahmins, minus their
mortification and self-denial. Valuable appointments would soon
be found descending in families. We should have a line of
priesthood almost as certain as a succession of title or an entail
of property.”
The Royal Commissioners report the expense of the
Corporation Church Establishment for the year 1828 as
amounting to the total sum of £22,406 ss. s|d.; of which amount
the sum of £19,300 was advanced out of the Colonial Revenue to
pay the stipends of the Clergy and the expenses of the School
Establishments. The population is given from a census taken in
November of the same year as 36,598 souls, of which 25,248 are
returned as the number of Protestants of all denominations,
11,236 (not much short of one-half) as Catholics, 95 as Jews, and
19 as Pagans.. In addition to these sums there were added £4OO
for the support of two Presbyterian clergymen, and for the
Catholic population of nearly one-half, and certainly outnumbering
the members of the Church of England, the sum of £l5O for one
clergyman, and £6B 3s. for the support of one school.
During five years of the reign of the Corporation it has been
shown that independent of the funds of the Corporation accruing
from sale and rent of land, and of items paid out of a
Parliamentary grant towards the support of the Church during
the year 1826, the Church of England cost the Colonial Govern-
ment the sum of £91,569 17s. 4d.; whilst the Church of Scotland
during the same period cost the Colony £1,966 6s. Bd., which is
less than one-fiftieth part of the cost of the Church of England;
the cost of the Catholic Church for the same period reaching a
still less amount.
Judge Burton asserts in his book that “ the dissolution of the
Church and School Corporation was followed by a revolution in
the constitutional principles of the Colony.” Dr. Ullathorne, in
his reply, maintains that this dissolution was quite legitimate,
because it took place by the operation of the law; it was the
result of the combined and unanimous act of the British Govern-
ment and the Colonial Legislature.
Judge Burton states that “ upon whatever varieties of
religious opinions individuals within the realm of England have


from time to time separated themselves into sects, dissenting in
matters of religion from the general body of the State, yet, ever
since the establishment of a Church in England, and the Union
of the Kingdoms under one Sovereign head, the Church of England
existed as the National Church; at first free and independent,
then for a time overwhelmed by corruption of foreign growth,
but again asserting and maintaining the independence of her
foundation and the purity of her faith. And as such was by
force of law, before the Statute 9th Geo. IV., c. 83, and by the
express terms of the Statute, the established Church of the
Colony.” To this spurious assertion of the Judge the reply of
Dr. Ullathorne is that the now established Church of England is
founded on the Statute 13, Charles 11. This Statute is entitled ;
“ An Act for the Uniformity of the Public Prayers and Adminis-
tration of the Sacraments .... in the Church of England.”
And the Act of 5, Ann. 8, for securing the preservation of the
Church of England by law established, which is cited by Mr.
Burton, expressly quotes the “ Act of Uniformity ” as being the
foundation of the establishment of that Church, and limits its
settlement by law “ within the kingdoms of England and Ireland,
the dominion of Wales, and town of Berwick-upon-Tweed, and
territories thereunto belonging.” “ Statue law, then,” writes the
Dr., “limits the Anglican establishment to England, Ireland,
Wales, and Berwick. All these Acts contain and speak their own
express local limitations The Statute law, he states,
is so far from giving the Anglican Clergy of the Colonies the
rights and privileges of belonging to the establishment of the
Church of England, that it expressly and by a special enactment
excludes them from the rights and privileges of that establishment.
The Act 59, George 111, expressly states that the clergy destined
for the cure of souls in His Majesty’s foreign and colonial
possessions are “ not provided with the title required by the
Canon of the Church of England of such as are to be made
ministers.
One word says the Dr. on Mr. Burton’s argument from the
Coronation Oath and the Catholic Official’s Oath. The Judge’s
sophistry on this point is the same as that of his friend the
Protestant bishop in his formal complaint to the British Govern-
ment on the subject of the Catholic bishop’s dress and appearance;
it depends on a quibbling mistake of the meaning of the words,
“ realm ” and “ kingdom.” There are three realms or kingdoms
and many vast dominions besides, which are beneath the empire
of the British Crown, some of which never were either realms or
kingdoms, and amongst these is the colony of New South Wales.


These oaths are limited by their own terms, and the Coronation
Oath by the Act requiring its declaration. The extension of the
Coronation Oath is expressly limited in the Act of Queen Ann to
within the kingdoms of England and Ireland, dominion of Wales
and town of Berwick.”
Having disposed, writes Dr. Ullathorne, of the Judge’s law,
we come at length to the facts.
The English Church has never been in New South Wales
by Act of Parliament established. No act of legislation has ever
interwoven its establishment with the colonial constitution.
During the short reign of the Corporation it became in so far the
creature of the King not of the Constitution, and on its own
showing it would then have perished but for the fostering care
of the Colonial Treasury. It has, before and since, been as an
establishment, the creature of the minister for the colonies, and
of the colonial Government. An omission of a single item from
the annual Estimates would have annihilated its establishment.
Its former head an Archdeacon was, its present head a bishop is,
the creature of the King, not of Parliament, the continuance of
the Episcopal office depends on the will of the Sovereign. No
act, even of the local legislature, much less of Parliament, ever
established the Church of England in this colony on a legal basis
until the Church Act; and this Act established three distinct
churches at the same time, and upon a system of perfect equality.
The Church of England, the Church of Scotland, and the Church
Catholic are the three churches established by the Colonial Law,
whilst a provision is also left open to the other denominations.”
We may be satisfied, then, that notwithstanding Mr. Burton’s
arguments, there is no dominant established church existing in
New South Wales.
Dr. Ullathorne in his reply takes Judge 'Burton to task for
an injudicious decision in a marriage case, which happened a few
years before. A man, the name of Maloney, a Catholic, had
contracted marriage with a Catholic woman, and they were
married by a Catholic clergyman. The ceremony was performed
in a private house. About seven years after the marriage, (he
kept a public house in Sydney) when the priest who solemnized
the marriage was dead and the witnesses had removed to the
interior, the (vil nature of Maloney prompted him to turn his
wife with four children out of doors; and he brought another
woman into his house, to whom he intended to get married. His
plea was because he had been married in a private house, which
he thought was contrary to law and invalidated the marriage.
Maloney was brought to trial for bigamy, and on the morning of


the trial the registration of the marriage was found and the
witnesses were produced. The only point then to be urged in his
favor was that the marriage ceremony was performed in a private
house, contrary to the English Marriage Act, consequently illegal.
By the English Marriage Act it is required that the marriage be
performed in the parish church, but there were no parish churches
in the Colony. The Government sanctioned the Catholic
marriages, and annually called for their registry. Maloney had
turned Protestant, and the marriage ceremony in regard to the
second woman was performed by a Protestant clergyman.
Judge Burton, in the case, differed in his decision, from the
judgments of his brother judges, Sir Francis Forbes and Sir James
Dowling. The opinion, or judgment rather, of Judge Burton was,
that the English Marriage Act was applicable to the colony.
“ Mr. Burton,” writes Dr. Ullathorne in his reply, “ would have
decided against the validity of this catholic marriage, and the only
one which, under the circumstances, could have taken place: and
but for the joint decision of his brother judges, not only would
this man, a licensed publican, who in the eye of nature, in the eye
of religion, and now in the eye of the law, was an adulterer, a
bigamist, and the deserter of his children to starvation, have been
delivered from all civil responsibility, but, as a necessary con-
sequence of this decision, every child born of catholic marriage,
of that marriage which the government recognized and sanctioned
O O O
by its acts, would have been reduced to dishonour, the succession
of all catholic property have been made unsafe and precarious,
and the colony have been thrown from end to end into a broil
and ferment of litigation of which no man could calculate the end
or consequences.”
Dr. Ullathorne in the same pamphlet further remarks upon
the conduct of the judge:—“ We catholics have been wronged,
grievously wronged, and by one whose appointed duty it is to
protect us in our rights. That name and character of a British
judge, which were given by the hand of power for our use, have
been turned to our abuse. You have
‘ Struck us with your tongue,
Most serpent-like, upon the very heart.’
You have for years industriously picked up the stories told
against us, gleaned gross falsehoods from time-serving newspapers,
which your length of public life should have taught you how to
value : you have carried them in your bosom, you have embalmed
them in your dislikes ; you have gone to England, and you have
scattered the devices of our enemies over the high places of


influence and power, endorsed them with your name, and with
the seal of your judicial character have stamped the falsehoods
true.”
“ This is not the first occasion,” the Doctor goes on to say,
“ you have given us to fear your especial presence on the bench.
The catholics of the colony remember your commonly reported
connection with that vile production of short-lived existence, the
Sydney Standard, which was not inappropriately designated ‘ the
high church and Burton paper, inasmuch as such of its columus
as could be spared from insulting us were devoted to your
particular opinions in politics.”
In another paragraph Dr. Ullathorne writes ; —“ You have
not only sought to sink us into a party of a degraded class, but
that holy religion which is the basis of our morals; that religion
which is the best motive of our social conduct; of those morals,
of that conduct, whose acts and omissions you are called upon to
decide in our utmost need; of that religion you have expressed
your contempt; her teachings you have derided; at the holiest
of her rites and sacraments you have mocked and scoffed
Your prejudice against us and your efforts to degrade us are now
matters of common fame.
In the concluding chapter the Doctor states : —“ The object
at which Judge Burton aims in his ‘ State of Religion and Educa-
tion in New South Wales,’ is evident; floating on the sur-
face of the work, visible without search.” “ A contest, he
perceives, has already begun. He will not avoid,” he says, “ any
part of his own proper duty on such an occasion. A member of
the church of England in Australia, he turns for help to his
brethren in England. The help he wants is money. Of this
article his brethren in the colony, he tells us, are collecting
considerable quantities, and are receiving yet greater sums from
the government. It is likewise his wish to obtain for the clergy
of his particular church, whose numbers he would increase to
legion, a legal and everlasting possession of one-seventh part of
the soil, that every one of them may be straightway constituted
an independent gentleman; independent not only of his people,
but, as time would quickly show, were it brought to the test,
independent of the duties expected from him, and equally inde-
pendent of any needful possession of the clerical qualifications
for his office. This large and ample independence he prefers
resting on the lands of the colony, as being ‘the safest and
securest.’ To the other religious communions of the colony Mr.
Burton and his friends make the gracious offer of ‘ toleration.’
A member of the church of England in Australia,” he


says, “ turns for help to his brethren in Great Britain. His object
is undoubted. He is the recognized lay leader of a politico-
religious party. Shortly previous to the arrival of this book, his
health was drunk, coram episcopo, at the diocesan dinner, as the
constitutional lawyer, who would never support any other doctrine
than that the Established Church of England is the national church
wherever the national ‘ Standard waves.’ ” —Speech of Mr.
Campbell. Sydney Herald, June 36, 184-0.
Such was the language of Mr. Campbell, when he proposed
the health of Judge Burton, coram episcopo, in the year 1840.
If Mr. Campbell survive, he must now be convinced, that outside
of England, the established church is not the national church,
wherever the flag of England waves.

APPENDIX.
A SHORT ESSAY
ON THE
ABORIGINES OP AUSTRALIA.
“Reges Tharsia et insulæ munera Offerent.”
Before the white man established himself on the Australian land
in 1788 the black man had been in possession, it is supposed,
of the Island Continent for thousands of years. There was not
a part fit for occupation in the whole land which was not taken up
by the Aborigines of Australia. The tribes were spread over its
breadth of about 1,600 miles, and its length of 2,400 ; hut they
were not free to roam where they pleased: they were obliged
to submit to certain laws, and each tribe was confined
to its own boundaries, and no one was allowed to trespass
upon the dominion of the neighbouring tribe under the penalty
of death. The consequence was that when the invaders came, the
natives were forced to submit on any terms, for they could not fly
to the adjacent tribes for refuge. The blacks living on the shores
of Port Jackson could not amalgamate with those at Parramatta;
the Cammeroy tribe on the shores of Broken Bay could not seek
refuge with the tribe of Badiagal, at the Upper Hawkesbury ; the
Gweagal of Botany could not expect protection from the Alowrie-
gal of the Five Islands.
When the tribes on the coast were subdued and dispersed
they had to eke out their existence as best they could, either by
begging from the white man for food, or by plunder. Their
natural food was the kangaroo and other marsupials, fish,
and wild indiginous roots. The white man hunted down
and destroyed the kangaroo, and interfered with their places
of fishing, so that they were reduced to famine, and great
numbers died of starvation. Governor Hunter gives an account
of their destitution, and states, that during the first two or three


years after the settlement, great numbers of skeletons and dead
bodies of the natives were found in caves and under projecting
rocks. Many of the survivors took to plunder and robbery as
their only resource: and numbers of them were cruelly and
mercilessly shot down: the remainder formed the boldest and
most warlike portion of the race.
The Aboriginal population of New South Wales at the time
of the settlement of the whites amounted to about one million ;
and it was reckoned there were fully three thousand natives of
different tribes living between Botany Bay and Broken Bay.
The cooey of the blacks is no longer heard in the bush and
valleys about Port Jackson. The corroberee or native war dance
by moonlight, at which hundreds assembled, is no more to be
seen; nor is the whizzing of the boomerang, thrown with such
dexterity by the native, heard on the plains ; nor the sound of
the hatchet, when he notched the tree and climbed to secure the
opossum, or the honey of the native bee : all is desolation to the
Aborigine ; the stranger has possession of his country !!
The Aborigines of Australia have been looked upon by many
as a contemptible race ; indeed, not far removed from the brute
creation : but ethnographists have discovered, after investigation,
that the native race of Australia is more ancient than all the races
of the surrounding islands; that they date back to a time not far
distant from the dispersion of the human race. We read in the
eleventh chapter of the book of Genesis, that after the deluge all
men assembled in the plain of Sennaar ; they were of “ one tongue
and speech.” After the attempt of man to build the Tower of
Babel their tongue was confounded ; “ and so the Lord scattered
them from that place into all lands,” &c. We can imagine the
primitive races after the dispersion wandering about from one
land to another, and some tribes taking up their abode in caves,
and under projecting rocks, without fixed habitations; without
implements of any kind except the stone hatchet; and without
any covering, except the skins of beasts : their food would be the
animals procured by the chase, ocean fish, wild fruit and indigenous
roots. The natives of the Andaman Islands, in the Bay of Bengal,
are characterized by habits and customs such as these : so also the
Negritos, or Indian negroes, and inhabitants of the Phillipine
Islands, the originals of the Malayan Peninsula.
The stone hatchet period is that era when numerous tribes
made use of that instrument; it was the most universal of all
tools or weapons before the inventions in metal, that is, in the
pre-metallic age of the world. The hatchet at first was formed
by splinters being taken off a block of stone, until it was reduced


to the shape of a hatchet; afterwards they made it a more
serviceable instrument by rubbing or grinding down the stone to
a proper shape. “ The hatchet of this kind,” says an author, “ has
been found in countless numbers, most of the specimens bearing a
marvellous resemblance to each other, in every portion of the
habitable globe, with the exception of China. In Europe, in Asia, in
Africa, in both the American continents, from the great lakes to the
Straits of Magellan, and throughout Polynesia and Australia.”
When the primitive race of Australians arrived in Australia,
is unknown; and from whence they immediately came: most
ethnologists are of opinion that the Negritos, or Indian negroes,
were probably the aborigines of the Malay Peninsula, and are
still to be found there, as well as in almost all the islands from
the Andamans in the Bay of Bengal, to the Phillipines in the
Chinese sea. The people of the A ndaman Islands appear to differ
in no essential respect from the Australian Aborigines. They go
quite naked; they build no permanent habitations; bone and
stone weapons are the implements which they use; they live in
families or very small communities, and, like the Australian
natives, have no knowledge of metals or of textile fabrics or
pottery; and their stature and general appearance are similar.
But they bear still a closer resemblance to the now extinct Tas-
manian Aborigines, who are regarded as belonging to the purest
stock of all the Australian Aborigines. The writers on the
Antiquity of Man connect by various and conclusive evidence the
Andamans and Negritos with the Australians; and the Negritos,
they say, are the types of the Bushmen of Africa, some of the
hill tribes of India, the Yedahs of Ceylon, perhaps the Caribs of
the Mexican Gulf, and probably the aborigines of Patagonia and
Terra del Fuego. “All these people seem to belong to that
ancient race known to ethnologists as Cave Dwellers. Their
remains have been disentombed from caverns, or dug from beneath
the alluvial deposits of thousands of years. In the chronology of
man this race occupies the first place, and must be regarded not
only as the most ancient, but also as the most widely" spread of
any section of the human family. Its vestiges are almost
universal. From the snows of Scandinavia, from the torrid soil
of the tropics, from the classic vales of Greece, from the shores of
barbarous Patagonia, from the valleys of sacred Mount Sinai,
from the caves of idolatrous India, from the plains of Australia,
and from the Steppes of Central Asia, the stone implements of
this most ancient, this once universal race, have been brought, in
modern times, to enrich the cabinets of the curious few, and to
excite the wonder of the ignorant many.”
Q


Many of the learned in these subjects have maintained that
the Aborigines of Australia belonged to, and were descended
from the Papuans of New Guinea; but after recent researches
they have come to the conclusion that the native Australian is not
connected with the Papuans. The very feasible reason on which
they rested their opinion, was the proximity of the two countries,
viz., Australia being only separated from New Guinea by Torres
Straits, which are not very wide, and there are many small islands
by which they could pass from New Guinea to Australia. Upon
investigation it was found that the inhabitants of these two
islands bear no relation whatever to each other. The
Papuans of New Guinea may be taken as the modern
representatives of the lake dwellers of the old world.
The Australians are undoubtedly, it is said, the modern
representatives of the cave dwellers. Those are two distinct
races. The Australians do not build permanent dwellings; they
are content to live in caves, or under a few sheets of bark. The
Papuans build substantial houses, on piles, on the margin of
lakes, or inlets of the sea. The Australians do not, nor ever
have cultivated the soil; the Haraforas, Arrufours, or Arafuras, a
people inhabiting some parts of New Guinea, and a large cluster
of islands to the west of that country, cultivate the soil with
considerable success. The Australian Aborigines know not, nor
ever have known the use of the plough ; they do not till the
ground in any way. The Papuans not only make use of wooden
implements and bone, but they understand the use of metal, and
they make textile fabrics and pottery; the Australian natives
are ignorant of all these things ; nor do they use the bow and
arrow, a weapon so well known to savage nations. The Papuans
live in rather large communities; but the communities of the
Australians are very small. The Papuans of New Guinea
construct very serviceable canoes by hollowing out large trees, in
making which they show considerable mechanical skill: the canoe
of the natives of Australia scarcely deserves the name, made from
sheets of bark, very frail and dangerous in a rough sea.
The physical appearance of the natives of New Guinea is
quite different from that of the Aborigines of Australia. The
Papuans from their appearance give evidence of a mixed people.
There is found amongst them the face of the Indian negro, of the
Malay, the Arab, and Polynesian; and they may be regarded as
chiefly of Tauranean or Tartar origin. The language of the
Australians is quite different from the language of the natives of
New Guinea: the language of the Australians denotes them to
belong to the Aryan race. They have not the well-developed


physique of the Papuans. The Australians are not men generally
of large frame—rather small in stature, slim but very active ; but
in some of the tribes there are tall powerful men. There is very
little mixture of foreign blood said to be amongst the blacks of
Australia. In the northern parts during scores of centuries, we
may suppose, a slight infusion of Arab, Malayan, Papuan, or even
Chinese blood, added to the old Negrito, or cave-dwelling stock ;
but not sufficient to any extent to change the character or insti-
tutions of the original inhabitants. There are some tribes in the
north of Australia who are called Murri. They give themselves
this name, and they resemble the Maori of New Zealand. They
have larger and more robust frames, and more nearly resemble
the New Zealander than any of the other tribes ; and, as amongst
the New Zealanders, the Jewish caste of features prevail. These
inhabit the north-eastern parts of Australia. Do they belong to
the Maori race ; or rather, are the Maoris descended from them ?
The facts in regard to this resemblance are too fine to justify any
definite conclusion.
The Australian natives seem to be isolated, and a race distinct
from all the other races of the Polynesian group of islands. They are
considered to be, as I have stated, the representatives of the cave
dwellers, one of the oldest of the human families, which belong
to the stone hatchet period. When they landed on these
shores, and under what circumstances, is a problem which
in all probability will never be solved. They may have been
driven, after the dispersion of man, in the plains of Sennaar, from
one country to another by their enemies, or through love of change,
have finally found refuge in the great Austral land. They may
have inhabited these lands since the days of Abraham, A.M. 2000.
It is considered, on account of the diversity and multiplicity
of their tongues, that they settled on the land at a very remote
time. Philologists discover that their languages are all of the
same construction, and must have been derived from one common
tongue. Every tribe has its own lingo, and such is the variation
of words and difference of inflection that one tribe does not
understand the lingo of the other. There is a finish and perfec-
tion in their tongues which is surprising. It is very remarkable
and very suggestive that the grammatical structure of all the
languages of Australia is the same, although there is so great a
diversity in the words that only the names of the most familiar
objects are common to the other tribes. Gideon S. Lang, Esq.,
who delivered a lecture in Melbourne some years since on the
aboriginal habits and character—and he was well qualified from
his opportunities to give an opinion—says that “The native


inhabitants of the whole continent form, in fact, one people, all
governed by the same laws and customs, the points of difference
between the tribes being only such as might be expected from
differences of circumstances and locality; and it is one of the
most remarkable facts in the history of the human family that
among different tribes, scattered over a region two thousand miles
long by nearly fifteen hundred miles wide, possessing no written
literature whatever, and traditions traceable for only a brief
period, there should prevail a system of internal government
almost identical and common to all; that this system must have
prevailed through countless generations, and that every tribe
has its own country, with as clearly defined a boundary as any
estate in England —a boundary which is never crossed but at the
risk of death, without diplomatic arrangements as elaborate and
punctilious as those between two German principalities.” Mr.
Lang states that “ The government is administered in ' each tribe
by a council consisting of old and elderly men, no young man
being admitted a member unless he has displayed unusual
intelligence, courage and prowess. There is also a class privileged
to go from tribe to tribe, to carry messages, to negotiate and
arrange for meetings between the various councils, and to transact
O O '
other business of a general character. These men are much
honoured by all the tribes.”
Their Degrading Practices. —Circumcision is practised by
some of the Northern tribes, and this may be accounted for from
their proximity to the Malayan Peninsula, and their intercourse
with the Arabs in former years, when the Arabs were navigators
and merchants in those parts. “ The practice of circumcision is
almost general with the Malays and Arabs.”
The tribes of Australia practise polygamy, and they have no
law against it; but the law pronounces capital punishment against
any one who marries one of the wrong sort. The practice of
infanticide was common and enjoined by their laws under certain
circumstances. The scarcity of food, it is supposed, prompted
them to destroy their offspring. Among the more degraded and
starving of the tribes cannibalism prevailed as the means of
sustaining life or of gratifying a craving for animal food, although
generally they hold the practice in abhorrence. We are not to
be suprised at these degrading habits, as they are common to
most savage nations.
Skulls of the Australian Aborigines have been exhibited in
Europe, seemingly in support of the old theory that the natives
of Australia are a very inferior race of the human family; but
those who have had good opportunities of judging, by no


means agree with this theory. The intelligence of a race
constitutes its rank among human beings. Now I have shewn
that their laws and customs by no means places them in an
inferior condition to other uncivilized nations or races. The
natives of Australia, although they do not build dwellings for
themselves or live in large communities, or have the knowledge
t ® _ O
ot any mechanical art, yet they have shewn great aptitude in
acquiring the knowledge of many things. They are most skilful
in using their own weapons —the spear, the boomerang, the stone
hatchet, &c.; it is said their use of these instruments is perfection.
“No one seeing ” says Mr. Lang, whom I have before quoted,
“ the natives merely as idle wandering vagabonds among the
white men, can judge as to what they are in their natural state.
In their subtlety as diplomatists, and their skill and activity in
war and in the chase, I consider them quite equal to the American
Indians. The great weir for catching fish on the Upper Darling,
and another described by Morrill, the shipwrecked mariner, who
passed so many years amongst them, prove that they are capable
of constructing works upon a large scale, and requiring combined
action. Everything they have to do they do in the very best
manner, and for every contingency that arises they devise a
simple remedy.”
When Sydney, some forty or fifty years ago, was a consider-
able depot for whaling and sealing vessels, the natives were
employed on board, and made excellent hands in the business.
Mr. Benjamin Boyd manned his fine yacht “ The Wanderer,” about
thirty years since, with native blacks of the Twofold Bay tribe,
and they made capital sailors.
A team of aboriginal cricketers was trained by a Mr. Wills,
in Victoria ; they came to Sydney in 1867. A few days after
they competed in a three days’ match with the Albert Club; the
natives lost the game, but played very skilfully. There were
eleven aborigines, captained by Mr. Wills. A team of aboriginal
cricketers went to England in the year 1868 for the purpose of
contesting the game with the renowned English clubs. The team
consisted of twelve blacks, captained by one Lawrence. The
aboriginals scored their first victory over an English team at
Lady well, against eleven gentlemen of Lewisham. The spectators
numbered upwards of 4000. A handsome silver cup was
presented to Red Cap, an aboriginal player, by the captain of the
Lewisham team, as the highest scorer on the Australian side.
If the native blacks of Australia shew such aptitude in
acquiring a knowledge of these arts and contrivances of the white
man, would they not, if pains were taken and sufficient means


provided, become capable of participating in most of the
advantages of civilized life ? Nothing could shew more the
adroitness and natural intelligence of the Aborigines than the
treaty which they entered into with John Batman, said to be the
founder of Victoria, for the purchase of land. Batman states ;
“ After some time and full explanation I found eight chiefs
amongst them, who possessed the whole of the territory near
Port Philip. Three brothers, all of the same name, were the
principal chiefs, and two of them men of six feet high, and very
good looking ; the other not so tall, but stouter. The other five
chiefs were fine men. After a full explanation now of what my
object was, I purchased two large tracts of land from them —■
about 600,000 acres, more or less, and delivered over to them
blankets, knives, looking-glasses, tomahawks, beads, scissors,
flour, &c., &c., as payment for the land ; and also agreed to give
them a tribute or rent yearly. The parchment the eight chiefs
signed this afternoon, delivering to me some of the soil, each of
them, as giving me full possession of the tracts of land.” —Men of
the Times, Heaton, page 12. — Batman. This account at once
shews the ingenuity of the natives and the greed of Batman.
The purest stock of the aboriginal natives is said to have
been that of Tasmania, which is now extinct. King Billy, or
William Laune, last male Tasmanian aboriginal, died March 3rd,
1869. Queen Tawaunimai, or Lalla Rookh, the last of the Tas-
manian aboriginals, died at Hobart Town, May 8, 1876 ; aged 73.
Governor Arthur of Tasmania. —When the blacks of
Tasmania were troublesome to the settlers Governor Arthur made
a cordon across the island to capture them, but only one was
taken, and the cost of the expedition amounted to £30,000.
Three hundred, the last of the Tasmanian aboriginals, were
transferred from the mainland to Flinders’ Island, in Bass’s
Straits, through the instrumentality of Mr. George Augustus
Robinson in 1837.
It is now nearly a hundred years since the white man
invaded these lands, and took from the black man the country
which he had inhabited for hundreds and hundreds of years —
the land which “ the Lord God gave unto him.” Since 1788, when
Governor Phillip, with his military settlers and prisoners, landed
on the shores of Australia, what has been done by those on whom
the responsibility rested, to ameliorate the condition of the un-
fortunate aborigines, to civilize and convert them ? No strenuous
efforts, either by the government or others who had it in their
power, have been made to alter their deplorable condition.
Commendable efforts have been made from time to time. Pro


tectorates, assisted by the government, and missions have been
formed for their conversion to Christianity ; but all have turned
out failures. Thousands and thousands are wandering as vaga-
bonds, without any object in life. If protectorates had been
established in every district, and abundance of land given to each
to cultivate, and the natives supplied with all the implements of
husbandry, and persons appointed to teach them the usages of
civilized life, and the arts of reading, writing and arithmetic, I
venture to say that thousands of them would be now enjoying
the comforts of civilized life, and their children would be perfectly
civilized. The invaders have taken possession of all their lands,
from north to south of this great island ; their tribal organisation
has been broken up ; cattle and sheep stations are everywhere ;
the kangaroo and other marsupials, upon which the natives lived
by the chase, have been destroyed or driven into the scrubs or
desert places ; houses and fences surround them on all sides:
they have received no compensation for the loss of country
which they have sustained. Let it not be thought that they are
indifferent to what has happened by the occupation of the
stranger. Starvation has done its work ; hope and vigour have
forsaken them ; they have become demoralised, and apathy or the
recklessness of despair has overtaken them. They have a deep-
rooted love for their country, and their feelings often rebel against
the intruders. Not long ago a poor black gin was giving some
annoyance at a station, and she was ordered by the squatter to go
away, when she turned quickly round and told him that “he
should go away, that this was her country.”
When, driven by hunger and starvation they have speared
the cattle and sheep of the white man, they were shot down
without remorse. Great have been the outrages committed against
the blacks in retaliation for depredations. It was no extenuation
that the unfortunate blacks were savages, starving with hunger,
and deprived of their hunting grounds. Oftentimes they have
been slain without pity, without a shadow of excuse, except the
desire to exterminate them. Who has not heard of the terrible
outrage perpetrated at the Myall Creek in June, 1838 ? At that
time 28 men, women and children were most barbarously murdered,
no regard being paid to age or sex; they were actually cut to
pieces and burned in a hidden part of the scrub. The massacre
was said to be committed by stockmen and labourers of various
stations. The outrage was clone, they said, because tne blacks
speared the cattle ; but there was reason for believing that those
murdered were not given to violence and plunder. Seven of those
who were charged with the murder of the aboriginals, were tried,
convicted and executed in Sydney, December 18, 1838.


A foreign author writes, in regard to this tragedy, “ Are these,
the English, the heralds of civilization, the preservers of the
human race, of which they boast ? With what right can they
proclaim themselves the benefactors of humanity, who, by virtue
of their profession, undertake to bring to the savage, life, activity,
religion, arts, science, glory, salvation and happiness !!!”
Dr. Lang, in his IV. Letter to the Earl of Durham, writes :
“ We are accustomed to speak with noble indignation and abhor-
rence of the brutal atrocities of Cortez, Pizarro, and the bands of
soldier-highwaymen who pursued their depredations in Mexico
and Peru: but we forget that at this time, in the nineteenth
century, we ourselves, although a nation civilized, and a colonizing
people, have upon other lands followed the same tragedy of blood.”
Besides this atrocity, innumerable are the outrages which,
from time to time, were committed by the whites against the
aborigines ; and now, in 1885, the fell work of extermination is
going on. We read in “ Heaton’s Dictionary of Dates ” that in the
year 1857, a tribe of about sixty were slaughtered on the Dawson
River. It is true that the blacks had murdered a Mr. Frazer, wife,
children and governess, at the same place; but how is it shown
that the tribe of sixty were all implicated in that massacre ?In
the Medway Ranges, Queensland, 170 blacks were slaughtered by
police and others, in reprisal for the Wills’ massacres, October and
November, 1861. When the blacks, through hunger, have been
guilty of petty thefts, the flour has been poisoned, and many of them
died in consequence ; and by having contracted the vices of the
whites they have died in great numbers from loathsome diseases
and strong drink. The depredations of blacks on the whites are
extenuated because the poor savage has only the light of reason
to guide him; but religion and civilization ought to teach the
white man to act with Christian compassion towards his unculti-
vated brother.
Their Religion.—lt is very important to consider what is
the religious belief of the aborigines of Australia. It is
the opinion of many who have written on the subject, that
they have no knowledge of the existence of God, the Creator and
Ruler of the heavens and the earth; others hold a contrary
opinion—that the aborigines of Australia believe in an omnipotent
Being who made the heavens and the earth, and they are far from
being atheists. Bishop Salvado of Port Victoria, who resides at New
Norcia (Abbey Nullins), (where there is a Catholic Settlement for
the aboriginals of Western Australia, conducted under his super-
intendence), states, in a work written by him, on the savages of
New Norcia, that, “they adore neither a true nor a false divinity;
they have, nevertheless, the idea of an omnipotent being, the creator


of the heavens and the earth, whom they call Motogon; that
Motogon is believed by them to he a man of great strength, high,
wise, and of their own colour and country. They say that in the
creation of the kangaroo, the sun, and the trees, he used these
words : —‘ Terra Esci Fuori,’ Let the earth exist, and breathed,
and the earth was created: ‘Acqua Esci Fuori,’ Let the water
exist, breathed, and the water was created; and so of other
things.” * Further on in his work Bishop Salvado writes, after
much conversation with the natives, that they admit two
principles ; one, the author of good, and he is Motogon, the other
the author of evil, whom they call Cienga.
In regard to the Aborigines of eastern Australia, a Protestant
missionary, who carried on for many years, under the auspices of
the Church of England, a mission to the Wiradhuri speaking
tribes of Wellington Yale, confidently asserts, after diligent
enquiry and study amongst the blacks, that most assuredly they
cannot be called atheists. This also is the opinion of Count
Strezlewski, who wrote “ A Physical description of New South
Wales and Yan Dieman’s Land.” The Count travelled much in
Australia, and had many conversations with the Indigenes.
There is no question but that amongst all the tribes of both
north and south there is prevalent the idea of certain imaginary
beings, to whom they ascribe various attributes, and some of these
attributes are very contradictory. However, it shows they have
some glimmerings of the supernatural. All the tribes have an
idea, but not very definite, that their existence does not absolutely
end with the death of their bodies; from which it is concluded
that they have an indistinct notion of the immortality of the
soul. There is one thing which they testify to and believe ; and
that is, the existence of an evil spirit, which they call Wondon.
Every thing adverse to them which happens, they attribute it to
the malignity of that spirit.. To the malignity of that spirit they
attribute the thunder, the lightning, the storms, floods, whirlwinds,
and hail.
They also. believe in the transmigration of souls. “It is
singular the manner by which they represent that transmigration.
When they see a person who has much resemblance with one
already dead, they say he has returned to life. Also a belief
prevails amongst them that after death they will rise up white
men ; and that the white people who inhabit other countries,
beyond the seas, are their ancestors, who pass away to live in
other bodies. Wonderful to say! I have found that belief to

prevail, identical, amongst the savages of the Liverpool Plains
who inhabit the eastern coast of Australia, and amongst those of
King George’s Sound, who live on the western coast, distant more
than two thousand miles, without communication with each other.”*
It is acknowledged by all who have had much intercourse with the
natives, that they are very reticent in regard to their religious
belief, and seem to have very confused notions of the supernatural.
Before the minds of the Aborigines became darkened by the
abuse of those natural lights and graces which they had received,
they knew their God, and adored Him as such. Romans, chap. 1,
ver. 2—“ But when they knew God they did not praise and
glorify Him, nor give Him thanks, but became vain in their
thoughts, and their foolish hearts were hardened.” St. Paul says ;
Rom., chap. 1, ver. 20 —“ For the invisible things of Him, from
the creation of the world, are clearly seen, being understood by
things which are made, His eternal power also and divinity ;so
that they are inexcusable.”
It is evident that the savages of Australia are reasonable
beings, made to the image and likeness of God, redeemed by
Christ, destined to be saved like the rest of man. 1 Tim., chap. 11,
ver. 4 —“ God will have all men to be saved and to come to the
knowledge of the truth.”
They are included amongst those nations to whom our Lord
commanded His Apostles to go and teach, and baptise in the
name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. The
words of our Lord when He commissioned His Apostles
are these : “ All power is given to me in heaven and in
earth. Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptising them in
the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost;
teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded
you ; and behold I am with you all days, even to the consumma-
tion of the world.”*f" This was a command given by Christ before
His ascension and after His resurrection to His Church, in the
persons of the Apostles, to teach the nations, and that His Spirit
would be ever and always with them. Christ hath been true to
His promise, He has been with His Church in all ages, converting
and baptizing the nations, “ enlightening those who sit in dark-
ness and the shadow of death, and directing their feet in
the ways of peace. The Catholic Church at the present time
has her missionaries in every part of the globe, dispelling the
darkness of infidelity, making known the saving truths of

salvation, and in many parts laying down their lives for the sake
of Christ; and the head of the Church, Pope Leo., appointed by
Christ, directs all her energies.
God selects His own time for the baptizing and conversion
of nations; the aboriginal of this land hath sat till now in
darkness and the shadow of death. The Catholic missionary is
now in the land, labouring to snatch these souls from the power
of the devil, and bring them under the influence of the Gospel.
Lately—in 1882—a mission has been begun in the Northern
Territory, at the express wish of His Holiness, Leo. XIII. It is
conducted by three members of the Society of Jesus ; the Rev.
A. Strele, S.J., is the superior. This first mission station is
established on an aboriginal reserve near Palmerston, given for
the purpose by the Colonial Government. Father Strele states
in his prospectus that “ The missionaries have the satisfaction to
see their efforts and sacrifices producing good fruit among ,the
aboriginals. Many of the latter have joined us in the work of
cultivating the land and of erecting the most necessary buildings
for a permanent station. They listen to the teaching, and about
forty have received baptism.” Father Strele goes on to state
that “ The satisfactory results obtained on the first station and an
increase in the number of missionaries led to the resolution to
form stations also among other aboriginal tribes For this
o o
purpose he had to confer with the Colonial Government, and was
very successful in obtaining an area of one hundred square miles,
a more inland position, on the Daly River, where the blacks are
very numerous.” He says, “ For aboriginals live still in great
numbers in this continent, and many thousands may yet be
brought out from their wretched state of ignorance and barbarism.
. . . The undertaking, moreover, co-operates with the
solicitude repeatedly expressed by Her Majesty’s Government,
that efforts should be made to ameliorate the condition of the
aboriginal tribes. It also co-operates with the intentions of the
Government of these colonies, which always second undertakings
of this kind.”
“ The continual life,” writes Father Strele, “which I lived
with the blacks during two years, and the close observation which
I had opportunity to make of them, force on me the persuasion
that their race, especially in the northern parts of Australia, is
well suited for instruction, for learning agriculture and the
various mechanical arts, and I am confident that after not many
years the stations will become self-supporting.”
The Rev. D. McNab, now the Catholic Pastor of Perth, con-
ducted a mission for the blacks a few years since in the country


surrounding Brisbane, and at Port Mackay, under the auspices of
Bishop Quinn. He obtained from the Government for the purpose
about four hundred acres of land, and gathered around him a
considerable number of the aborigines, many of whom he
instructed and baptized; but ill-health and want of assistance
compelled him to leave them. He said it was very difficult to
civilize and christianise those blacks, because they were so much
contaminated by association with whites.
I have seen in a letter from the Rev. D. McNab, dated 3rd
March, 1886, that he is establishing a native mission in Western
Australia, on the south side of King’s Sound. He has obtained
from the governor a reserve for a native mission, consisting of 600
acres; and the blacks in those parts have consented to settle
down and cultivate the land; to catch and cure fish ; and send
their children to school. The reserve is about eighty miles from
Derby. At the penal settlement, where he was for four months, he
instructed and baptized between twenty and thirty natives.
A Community of Benedictine monks was established in West-
ern Australia, upwards of fifty miles from Perth, on the extensive
Victoria Plains. It was founded by the Right Rev. Rosendo
Salvado, 0.5.8., about the year 1867. The monastry is called
New Norcia, and the bishop resides there. The community
consists of fifty-eight monks and lay brothers. In conjunction
with the monastry there is a settlement for the aborigines. In
the year 1866 Governor Irwin gave 30 acres of good land in
perpetuity, and for the use of pastoral purposes 1000 acres of
grazing land. The indigenes have been instructed by the monks
with great success. There may be, from time to time, as many as
300 blacks living on the establishment. The boys and girls at
New Norcia are in number about 50. They have two separate
buildings, one for the boys and another for the girls, where they
receive from the monks religious and secular education. They
are taught reading, writing, arithmetic, and sacred history.
New Norcia is a little colony of Australian blacks, and they
are provided with every necessary. 300 acres of land were
prepared in 1859, and 200 were put under cultivation. The
produce from the labour of the aborigines and the brothers
amounted to 3000 bushels of wheat, 15 tons of grapes, a ton of
tobacco and 200 gallons of wine.
They have an elegant church built in the Italian style; a
monastry, schools, houses for the adults, workshops, granaries,
and an hospital. The blacks are taught how to cultivate the soil.
They learn the useful trades of shoemaking, tailoring, carpentry,
&c., &c., and how to build in stone and brick. The females are


taught to knit and to cook and to do laundry work. Miss
Florence Nightengale, famed at the time of the Crimean war for
her attention to the wounded, in a work published by her in
London, after her voyage to Australia, says, in no part of this
world have they succeeded in educating and civilizing the savage
races, except in the Benedictine monastry of New Norcia.”
The Anglican bishop of Perth, understanding that the success
of the monastic colonization was a cruel reproach to the indiffer-
ence of his co-religionists in the question of the civilization of the
Australians, endeavoured by public conferences to engage the
English colonists to contribute to the foundation of a new Pro-
testant mission for the savages of his diocese ; but neither the
inhabitants of Perth, nor the colonists would listen to it; and
when he returned again to the charge, the journals answered him
in the following manner; —“ It is our profound conviction that
the Anglican missions for the savages in Western Australia; as
well as in other parts, have failed, because the principal object of
the founders was to make of the Australians, elegant and well-
informed men. We believe that if the missionaries of New
Norcia have succeeded, it is only because, without neglecting the
development of the intelligence of the savages, they have above
all sought to correct their manners after the precepts of Christ,
and to unite the moral to the physical education, so as to make
the Australian a working man and useful to society.” —Hie
Inquirer, of New Perth, 15th November, 1865.
All the young girls, natives, at New Norcia, know how to
sew, and some are as expert with the needle as any seamstress of
Europe. Every week two of them do the cooking for the rest,
and two of them bake the bread. The result is that when they
are to be married they are perfectly acquainted with their
household duties.
Bishop Salvado writes, 28th August, 1878, “On the 15th
August, the Feast of the Assumption, I administered the Sacra-
ment of Confirmation to forty savages and three Europeans, who
a few days before had abjured protestantism and received
baptism.” In a letter written 13th April, 1878, Bishop Salvado
writes these remarkable words :—“ The Australians received and
instructed in our monastic colony do not return to the savage
life, as the protestant neophytes generally do, when, for one
reason or another, they leave New Norcia. Last year some of
my savages who were baptized, left the mission, but they have
not dishonoured it. The first has gone to establish himself as a
shoemaker at Perth, our capital. Another savage civilized by our
monks, is gone to work with an English colonist, and he has his


wife with him, who is also an indigene. The colonist was so
satisfied with him that he has built them a small house and given
them a garden. The man acts as servant, groom and gardener ;
his wife as cook and laundress. A third Australian took service
with another colonist; he soon discovered the fitness of this
indigene, and not content with giving him three pounds per
month, with board and lodging, he made him his butler ; the other
domestics, who were English and Irish, obeyed him, and did it
with cheerfulness. Another indigene who was in the service of
a horse-trainer, seeing one of the domestics, an Englishman and
catholic, become seriously ill, took care of him and assisted him
piously in his last hour. During his agony he recited all the
prayers which he knew. When the domestic was dead he buried
him with respect, dug his grave, and after having interred him,
recited over his tomb the psalms and prayers for the repose of
his soul.” Such is the race, remarks the writer of these extracts,
of men whom the English protestants declare so incapable of any
civilization that they seek by every means to exterminate them;
and whom professor Darwin, with his credulous dupes, points
out to us as the direct descendants of the Chimpanzee and
Orang-Outang, after the amusing theory which would make us
all to come from a great baboon,
The Rev. George F. Dillon, a Roman Catholic missionary,
founded a mission for the aboriginals at Burragorang, a place
about 65 miles from Sydney. Many of the blacks have been
baptized and instructed there; the mission still exists, and is
bringing forth good fruit.
Notwithstanding the cruel treatment and slaughter of great
numbers of the blacks by the whites, together with the neglect
and contempt to which they have been subjected, they are still
very numerous in the year 1886. In 1788, when Governor
Phillip established the colony, he estimated the number of blacks
in New South Wales at 1,000,000; 3,000 of these were supposed
to be between Broken Bay and Botany Bay. The number of
blacks in Australia in 1848 was estimated at 3,000,000. At the
first colonization of Port Phillip the aboriginals numbered about
5,000. When Victoria became an independent colony, in 1857, the
number was officially stated to be 2,693. In 1879, the secretary
to the Central Board for the Protection of the Aboriginals esti-
mated the total number of aboriginals in the colony of Victoria at
1553. Aboriginals numbering 557, or more than a third, are
living on Aboriginal Stations, which are under the control and
partial support of the government. The remainder wander about
the colony at large. Every effort is made to induce them to follow


profitable employments, and the education of the young receives
attention. They are trained to labour; but they are also taught
reading, writing and arithmetic, and they are, as a rule, apt
scholars.” — J. H. Heaton’s Dictionary of Dates, p. 5.
Efforts made to Instruct and Civilize the Blacks by
Non-Catholics. —-The first great effort made to educate and
civilize the aborigines was made by Governor Macquarie. He
formed an establishment at Black Town, on the Richmond Road,
and placed it under the superintendence of a missioner of the
South Sea Islands. A branch of this institution was afterwards
established at Castle Hill, near Parramatta, but soon after the
departure of Governor Macquarie,both of the institutions failed.
Messrs. Tyerman and Bennett were deputed by the London
Missionary Society to establish missions for the aborigines, and
with the consent of the society they formed one at Lake
Macquarie, which lies to the north of Broken Bay; but whether
it was that the expenses were too great to support it, or that the
place was not well adapted for the purpose, the fact is that the
society gave orders that it should be broken up: the government
assigned to a protestant missionary a salary of £l5O, but not-
withstanding the mission failed.
Another mission was undertaken in the district of Wellington
for the aborigines, under the auspices of Archdeacon Broughton,
who was afterwards bishop of Sydney. The protestant propa-
ganda of London showed a lively interest for the prosperity of
this mission, because it represented the work of the Church of
England in the first colony of Australia. After a few years of
useless efforts the mission was abandoned.
The Wesleyan Church made another attempt. They saw, in
the district of Port Phillip, now the colony of Victoria, that there
were numerous tribes of native blacks ; they thought it would be
a fine field for their exertions : they established there a mission :
the plans for its success could not be better devised, says my
author, and they deserved a better fate. Notwithstanding,
“ periit memoria eorum cum sonitu.” —Psal. xi, 7.
The famous mission of Dr. Lang cannot be passed over
unnoticed. It was different from all the others in its formation.
Were one to believe the doctor, from what he has written, his
name should be ranked amongst the greatest philanthropists of
the Southern hemisphere, and held as one of the noblest defenders
of the cause of the savages before the tribunal of humanity and
politics, so great is the love which he shows for them; so
animated are the expressions he makes use of in addressing the
government and the agents, to induce them to ameliorate the


condition of the aborigines of Australia. He bitterly laments
that England has not made use of the means best adapted for
christianizing the aborigines. “ Anglicanism,” he says “or Episco-
palianism is nothing but a kind of popery, and popery has always
been an obstacle to the civilization of people. The Americans
never made any progress whilst they were under the government
of a code which recognized an episcopal church. But after they
became independent, then protestantism made wonderful pro-
gress.” Nothing would satisfy Dr. Lang, in converting the
savages, but that they should be taught pure presbyterianisin.
Dr. Lang states, “ that he was enabled, by the assistance of Lord
Glenelg, then Secretary of State for the Colonies, with all the
means necessary to convey, for the establishment of the mission
of the aborigines, two ordained presbyterian ministers, and twelve
lay missionaries, eight of whom were married. That mission was
placed under the presidency of the Bev. John Gossener’, pastor in
Berlin of the church of Bohemia, and already for many years a
most zealous promoter of the gentile missions.”* “The twelve
lay missionaries and the two ordained ministers,” says Dr. Lang,
“ established a mission at Moreton Bay, on the river Kidron, seven
miles from Brisbane. But lam grieved to say, that although they
who directed that mission were excellent persons and true
Christians, and exercised a great and salutary influence through
all the other districts of that Bay, they entirely failed in their
intention, and in the same way that all the other aboriginal
missions of Australia failed in their design of imbuing a religious
sentiment into the minds of the aborigines. The government aid
was finally withdrawn, and the missions from that moment were
dissolved.” This happened during the administration of Sir
George Gipps.
Let us enquire briefly, what has been the conduct of the
English and Colonial governments towards the aboriginal popula-
tion of Australia, Governor Phillip, in the . beginning of the
colony, manifested great sympathy for the blacks, and was very
kind to them ; but it was not in his power to protect them
sufficiently from the violence and bad treatment of the prison-
population ; so that he neither established any system for their
civilization, nor for their conversion to Christianity : nor am I
aware that the English government instructed him in the matter.
But in the year 1841 Lord John Russell, when he was Secretary
for the Colonies, vindicated the honour of England before the
* This Rev. J. Gossener, be it known, was an apostate, who, from being a
Catholic priest, became a Lutheran minister.


nations, to a certain extent, in regard to the aborigines. He wrote
a despatch to Governor Gipps, and recommended “ that fifteen per
cent, of the Land Fund should be applied exclusively to the
civilization and protection of the aborigines, leaving to the colonial
authorities the details of the expenditure, but requiring that a
yearly report should be laid before the governor of the colony,
showing, by statistical and other data, the progress made in
improving the condition of the black population.”*
The reply from the colony to this despatch was, that many
experiments had been made to ameliorate the condition of the
blacks, but without fruit; and if they were to judge of the future
by the past, there was reason to believe that every hope of
changing the habits and customs of these savages was vain.
In the year 1845, Sir George Gipps received another despatch
from Lord Stanley, about the civilization of the indigene. “ I
cannot conclude this despatch,” says Lord Stanley, “ without
expressing my sentiments upon the importance of the object; that
is, to receive from your Excellency a general plan, by the carrying-
out of which we can satisfy our obligation towards that unfortu-
nate race of beings. I will not admit without extreme reluctance,
that nothing can be done for them; and that only in regard to
them the doctrines of Christianity are inefficacious, and the benefits
of civilization incommunicable. I cannot be persuaded that they
are incapable of improvement, and that their extinction cannot
be prevented, in contact with the colonists. I recommend them
to your favourable solicitude and protection, assuring you at the
same time with all faithfulness, that I charge myself to co-operate
with you in that which will be considered opportune to execute,
in order to their civil advancement.”
Lord Stanley could not speak with more justness and interest
than he did by those words of the despatch. But what was the
result of the despatch ? A society was formed in Sydney to give
an answer to the Secretary for the Colonies. The members of
this society were composed not only of seculars, but also of
protestant missionaries, who pretended to know the habits and
dispositions of the savages. Every one gave his opinion ; finally
the conclusion was, that no plans, no systems availed to ameliorate
the condition of the Australians.
The account given by Flanagan in his history is the following,
in regard to the despatch.—“ A committee of the Council, having
reference to a despatch of the Secretary of State, received during
the preceding year, was appointed to inquire into the condition

of the aborigines. In the report which they prepared they
recommended the abolition of the Protectorate, as having failed
in the object for which it was established; as being in fact, at
this time, altogether useless; but they could not recommend a
substitute. They advised the house that it was useless to form
new reserves, as recommended by the Secretary of State ; the
education of adults they thought to be hopeless, and the young
could be educated only by a compulsory separation from their
relatives and tribes. They concluded by expressing an opinion
that, without under-rating the philanthropic motives of her
Majesty’s government in attempting the improvement of the
aborigines, much more real good would be effected by similar
exertions to promote the interests of religion and education among
the white population in the interior of the colony, the improve-
ment of whose condition in these respects would doubtless tend
to benefit the aborigines.*
An Italian writer comments upon this evasive reply of the
committee of the Council in the following words: —“ This report
was sent officially to London, and produced its effect, because the
parliament became persuaded that nothing could be done for the
civilization of the Australians. Thus no more is said about them :
they cease to exist in the minds of the government, either as a
race, or as individuals, and with the colonists prevails the idea
that they are not men, but a kind of monkey. Every plan was
dismissed, every system, every institution for their amelioration ;
they were left to themselves, exposed to all the violence and
cruelty of the colonists, and compelled to retire into the depths of
their forests, to become more savage and degraded than they were
before.”j"
“ The colony is now nearly one hundred years old ; the land
which belonged to the black population has been taken possession
of by the colonists who invaded their country ; I ask again, what
compensation has been made to the aborigines ? Have many of
them been baptised, and made Christians, and civilised ? Com-
paratively very few of the million which inhabited New South
Wales. Are not the colonies responsible in a great measue for
this being the case ? They have the power and the means of
ameliorating their condition. If they have obstructed the
labours of the missionaries of Christ, who were commanded to
baptize and instruct all men, | what a terrible account
they will have to give to the Supreme Judge. They will be

ranked amongst those to whom our Lord will say, after pro-
nouncing the awful sentence, —‘For I was hungry and you gave
me not to eat; I was thirsty and you gave me not to drink; I
was a stranger and you took me not in; naked, and you clothed
me not; sick and in prison, and you did not visit me
Amen, I say to you, as long as you did it not to one of these least
ones , neither did you do it to me.’ ” *
I will now conclude my short essay by a quotation from a
celebrated writer, Count Joseph De Maistre, in regard to whom
belongs the work of missions. “To the Pope,” he says, “and the
missionaries sent from the Holy See, belong the work of missions.
Consider that famous Bible Society, the weak, and perhaps
dangerous rival of our missions. It informs us every year how
many copies of the Bible it launches into the world; but it
always omits to tell us how many new Christians it has produced.
But if the money which this society spends on the Bibles were
given to the Pope, to be devoted to the expenses of missions, he
would by this time have made more Christians than there are
pages in all the Bibles of the association Although such
men had nothing against them but their divisions, nothing more
would be necessary to render them powerless, —Anglicans, Luther-
ans, Moravians, Methodists, Baptists, Puritans, Quakers, &e., —
such are the people with whom heathens have to deal. The
Scripture says, ‘ How shall they hear if no one preach to them ?’
It may be said with equal truth, ‘ How will they be believed, if
they do not understand one another.’ ” -f-
--“ An English protestant,” continues the Count, “ has felt this
curse of sterility, and has expressed himself in regard to it with
candour, delicacy, and truly religious sincerity, which show that
he was worthy of that mission which was wanting to him.”
“ The missionary,” he says, “ ought to be far above a narrow
bigotry, and ought to possess a truly catholic spirit. It is not his
duty to teach Calvinism, or Arminianism, but Christianity. It is
not his object to propagate an Anglican hierarchy, nor the
principles of the protestant dissenters, but to serve the universal
church. I wish the missionary to be well persuaded that the
success of his ministry by no means depends on the points of
separation, but on those which enjoy the concurrent assent of all
religious men.” J
