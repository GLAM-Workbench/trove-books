TO
BENJARMIN BOYD, ESQ. M.C.
Sir,
As nane hae attempted to write in the Scot-
tish style here, and haein’ been accustomed (syne
at skule) to spend my leizure hours in composin’
a few verses in my mither tongue, I published a
weeßuik in 1842, whilk, gin I can judge right,
met the approbation o’ some o’ my kintramen,
frae the tnony applications for copies sin’ they
were a’ expended. I’m noo applied to by some
frien’s to publish the remainder o’ my “ Pieces.’’
My time being noo mair happily employed, I hae
flung my pen on the skelf, to write nae mair.
In bringing my second Buik afore the Public,
tho’ I ken weel there’s naething very amusing or
instructive in it, still I hope it will be esteemed
by some o’ the progeny o’ Sons o’ Auld Scotia,
being dune wi' a desire to induce them to a warm
feelin’ for the laun’ o’ their -forbears.

1 beg you will excuse the liberty I hae ta’eu
in dedicatin’ it to you (withouten your lieve).
Ye ken ilka vine wants a prop, and, as I am a
root o’ nae sma’ magnitude, I maun hae a gude
ane, like yoursel’, to hand me up —sae I hope
you will forgi’e me. lam also unco anxious to
keep the favour o’ the Leddies. I dinna ken ony
thing mair likely to do that, than hopin’ yoursel’,
an’ a’ (your brithers) Bachelors wha hae gat
gude dookats, will tak to the Hymeneal altar
some bonniedoos, an’ spend the remainder o’ your
days in a’ earthly happiness.
I beg to subscribe mysel',
Maist respectfully,
Sir,
Your very humble Servant, .

INTRODUCTION.
Sin’ Adam was made, till thir day*,
A’ hae a selfish spell ;
Ilka ane on this stage weel plays
The part o’ “ min’ mysel.’ ”
A Bachaii’an, sae unco fine—
A Snuff-maker ! a perfect joke ;
The ane says, “ drown your cares in wine,”
The ither, “ puff them aff in smoke
But I swear by my stumpy pen.
Gin I write I winna fleech them ;
I’ll mak them better manners ken,
Or, faith ! I’ll try to teach them.
Better kill time at night, I think.
At hame—is’t nae far cheaper
Composin’—thof wastin’ pen an’ ink,
. Candles an’ writing paper ?

Written to the Memory of the late Captain John
M undell, R % N.—a faithful and affectionate friend
Ah ! Mundell, could I but see
Wharc your blest ashes rest,
Burden’d wi’ grievous ecst’cy
I’d press them to my breast.
Eras’d your mem'ry never can
Frae this puir forlorn heart ;
Aft do I think on pleasures gane.
And grief whan we did part.
Receive, the navy never can,
A mair int’reatin’ lad ;
A handsomer or braver man
Ne’er fought ’neath British flag !
To friend you nover turn’d your coat —
Was prompt in your command—
To conquer’d faes wi’ wham you’d fought,
Ne’er did refuse your hand,
Noo may your ashes rest in peace.
Whilst I troubles sair sustain,
Till the last trumpet pipes us hence,
To happier meet again.

To tear a heart—whilk ance was blest

And for their duds and meat to seek.

plexed by my Son Jamie.
O Lord ! unto your servant grant,

A breakfast or a dinner ;

Still I will GonteUtbrf be.

To ony man a penny.
May I and bonnie Betsy meet
In happiness thegither ;

You did her free deliver.

May they frae gude to ill ne’er fa’,
But aye wank in Thy ways !

SONG
Written on my dear lost Son, WILLIE.
Tune—“Logie o’ Buchan.”
Come tell me, come tell me, O saw ye my son ?
Come tell me, come tell me, what way has he gone ?
Is ho still a rover and ploughin’ the sea.
Or is he shipwreck’d, and aye lost to me ?
Is he still, die.
O may the Almighty let me nae langer mourn,
Bnt grant that my Willie may shortly return ;
O happy that moment! how blest wad Ihe
To see my dear Willie come jumpin’ to me !
O happy, die.
But a sair forebodin’ echoes in my ear
That o’ my dear Willie I’ll never mair hear ;
The Echo,* that perish'd, I strong doubts aye have,
Sent my ain dear Willie to a watery grave.
The Echo, die.
Noo I’m broken-hearted sin’ Willie’s away.
My frame’s gettin’ feeble, my hair’s gettin’ grey ;
O heav’nly Power ! let me beseech thee,
The mystery o’ Willie unfold unto me,
0 heav’nly, die.
* The schooner “ Echo” was lost in coming from
Hobart Town to Sydney, in which all hands perished,
at the time my Willie sent me notice, by a young man,
that he would be with me ; but, if on board that ves-
sel, he must have been under a feigned name, as that
of William Cunynghame did not appear amongst
either passengers or crew.

he having wagered and lost a hat, but without spe-
cifying whether it should be an old or new one.
Dear Mitchell—l’m sorry I forgat,
As promis’d, to send down the hat,
But hope (by Bill) still to find
That it has arriv’d in time.
The veteran hapo that it displays
Shows it has serv’d for mony days,
But better stuff was never wore
Upon a sinner’s head afore.
This wurthy hat ne'er minds the rains—
Twice in the furnace defied the flames ;
So for past favours has a claim
To be put in service again.

That muckle gude he’ll send you.
And whan ye’re gane, <fec.
May riches then sune be your lot.

Your sorrows buried and forgot.
Then return and aye live near us.

Weill receive you aye wi’ heart an’ hand,
Syne sorrows winna steer you.

Nae troubles will then tease us.

Whan Fate wi’ crosses press’d me much,
And crush’d my spirits sair,
In you I ever fand a friend.
Staunch, faithfu’, and sincere ;

In “ strong memory” revere.
Is there a heart o’ adamant
Wadnae melt at the sad tale ?
Tortures you and crew underwent,
Baith in minds and vigour hale.


Nae sepulchre will mark the place.
Tears frae your friends to draw ;
Your bodies made a sacrifice
To fill the savage maw.
Tour banes they’ll tak to point their spears,
And fresh arrows for their bows,
To mak further sacrifices
Wha unwary 'mang them goes.
Neptune his waters may heave much,
Boreas noo bla' his best,
Tour bodies they will never touch,
Nor e’elids keep frae rest.

Bring constant happiness to you ;
And, whan far distant, you can tell
You ken ane here does wish you well.

If through this warld you should rang*
To find out a’ that’s gude or strange,
O’ feelin’ hearts nane will compare
Wi’ the kind heart o’ Bella Blair.
My orphan Son, I weel may say.
Since I’ve frae him been lang away.
He an’ his lovely Addey fair
The friendship prize o’ Bella Blair.
To him a mither she has been.
To a’ his comforts she has seen ;
Sure sic an aunt you’ll meet uac where.
To equal Isabella Blair.
Lang may her life be spar’d to see
The happiness o’ her protegee ;
O Death, be kind—an’ lang, lang spare
The gude an’ wurdy Bella BUur.


FAREWEEL TO SYDNEY,
Written at a time when I expected to leave it.
fareweel then Sydney, my abode
These last twenty years, adieu !
In thee I fixed a’ my hope.
But pleasures I hae found few.
Fareweel thy bounie bays an’ bights.
Thy rocks an’ gullies deep;
Thy sweet domain, whare love invites
The happy pairs to meet.
Thy silv’ry stream, to thee adieu,
Whare aft I’ve fishin’ gane ;
Fareweel, a lang fareweel to you,
The wharf that bears my name.
Fate has decreed that I maun gang
Awa, I noo maun leave you ;
Sydney, may you ne’er feel a pang,
May naething come to grieve you.
May rich pastures on your hills increase,
Whare grazin’ cattle feed ;
Your flocks lang bring forth their gowden fleece
(,Ipon your fairy mead.
Your fisheries replete your stores
Wi’ oil and bane in plenty,
- Then whan your droopin’ spirit soars
Bear mind by wham they’re sent you,
Sydney, Slh January, 1844.

To waft yo ; safely to your hame,

Gie him a card—tell him to ca’—
Maybe he’ll hae a bolt to mend.
Gin in the Sand-hill I chance to lay,
Visit the place whan you come back ;

And ony ither thing you choose

But as I’m brought to that disgrace.
Lord send me noo a brazen face !
