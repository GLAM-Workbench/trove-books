INTRODUCTION
The Directors of Wormald Brothers Industries Limited feel the Staff, Shareholders
and Friends of the Company would welcome a collected narrative of our activities and
spread as an addition to our statements of account and our various brochures, giving full
particulars of our products.
It is felt that this would better take the shape of a separate booklet to be published
at the same time as our Balance Sheets in 1952, when the Company is well into its sixty-
fourth year of existence.
It is a long way from the foundation in 1889 to the great organisation spread over
two nations, and in these few pages an endeavour has been made to indicate the size of the
organisation that is available to give service throughout Australia and New Zealand.
The history is necessarily the briefest outline, giving the development in broad steps.
The activities are dealt with in the same way so as to link up all things in which we are
interested and are able to give service. The idea is to show what we do and where we do it.
Naturally, more detailed information is available on every activity.
Our endeavour has always been to preserve a happy Staff and to advance our business
by friendly service, and this is our policy today and one that we intend to continue.
July, 1952.

The Company has a continuous history since
the 23rd March, 1889, when it was established
as a partnership by Stanley G. Russell and Jos.
D. Wormald under the style of Russell and
Wormald, with an office at No. 3 Bond Street,
Sydney, and a store in the basement of Queen
Victoria Markets. The partners lived alternately
in Melbourne and Sydney, operating the
Agency held from Mather & Platt Ltd. for the
"Grinned” Sprinkler, "Simplex” Fire Extin-
guishers, Fire Doors and also the Palatine
Insurance Company. All materials were im-
ported ready to use and no manufacturing
was carried out in Australia.
Stanley G. Russell retired towards the end of
1896 to join Mather & Platt Ltd. as manager
for France, and the business was carried on as
Russell & Wormald until 1900. Harry P.
Wormald joined his brother, Jos. D. Wormald,
in 1898 and was admitted to partnership in
1900, when the name was changed to Wormald
Brothers. The partnership in Melbourne was,
for a time, Wormald Brothers & Wears.
The office in Sydney moved to 17 Bond
Street. A works to manufacture "Simplex” Fire
Extinguishers and Fire Doors was established
in Deans Place at the turn of the century. This
building was demolished to make way for
Warwick Building.
By 1908 there was a substantial store in
Melbourne, in Castlemaine Buildings, Queen’s
Bridge, and in Sydney the Works had outgrown
Deans Place and moved to premises in Ann
Street, Surry Hills, part of the site now occu-
pied by J- Gadsden Pty. Ltd. There were
agents in other State Capitals and operations
had been conducted in New Zealand through
agents since 1889-
The partnership became a limited company
on 9th January, 1911, when Wormald Brothers
Limited was formed with a nominal capital of
£25,000, of which 9,500 l c /c cumulative pre-
ference shares and 10,500 ordinary shares were
issued.
The first Park Works, of about 20,000 feet,
was built in Young Street, Waterloo, Sydney,
in 1912. Steel Rolling Shutters and Hollow
Metal Windows were first manufactured in
1913.
The Steel Shelving Department was set up in
1916. The first Works in Melbourne —Bay
Works in Bay Street, Port Melbourne —was
purchased on 19th August, 1919.
The nominal capital of the Company was
increased to £75,000 on 30th October, 1918,
and in 1920 was reconstructed with a nominal
capital of £130,000, of which, by 1924,
£121,000 was paid up. During the nineteen-
twenties, Works were built in Brisbane and
Adelaide and rented in Perth. This was neces-
sary to deal with the steel section window
business, which was a large interest at that
time.
The Bangor Sliding Door Track was acquired
from Dobson, Wormald Ltd. in March, 1928.
By this time branches were well established
in all important centres; the first to be opened
was Brisbane in 1916.
The organisation was hard hit by the depres-
sion, but recovered and expanded itself so that
it was in a position to provide the major part
of all fire-fighting equipment within its scope
to the Commonwealth Government during the
war.
The continual growth and increased decen-
tralisation since the war caused complete
reorganisation of the capital structure, and
smaller units had to be created to facilitate
management and pave the way for further
growth.
The first move was the formation of Steelbilt
Limited as a separate company on 2nd July,
1946. This was followed the next year by the
flotation of the Kirsch Company (Aust.)
Limited on 4th November, 1947, and the
formation of the New Zealand interests into a
company on Ist July, 1947, and Wormald
Brothers (East) Limited and Wormald
Brothers (South) Limited commenced business
on Ist October, 1947. The undertaking became
a public company under the title of Wormald
Brothers Industries Limited in May, 1949, just
over 60 years after its establishment.
