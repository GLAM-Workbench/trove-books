The following particulars of this
remarkable specimen of the antiquity
ot man, are copied from the Australian
papers, viz.—The “ Sydney Empire,’’
of January 28th, 1862; the “Adelaide*
Register,” November 27,1862; and
the “Adelaide Advertiser” of the 25th
“Some months ago it became known
in South Australia that very extensive
lime and stone caverns existed at
Me squito Plains, in the south eastern
districts of that colony.
The Caverns are said to he several
miles in length, and up to the present
time, have not been fully explored.
On exploring one of these caverns,
some 8000 yards in the interior, wasi
discovered the body of .this black man,p
(Homo Nigra.) 9


Mr. Collins determined to add this
rare species of man to his collection,
and having wrapped him in a travel-
ling rug, he emerged from the cavern
and then started, and travelled over
100 miles, until he reached Mount
Gambia, almost in a state of starvation
and exhaustion. However, nothing
daunted, he again started with his
singular burden, and after undergoing
numerous privations, readied Adelaide
in safety.
This is certainly the most extraor-
dinary instance on record, for how
long the body lay in the cave it is
impossible to say, it may be as anti-
quated as the pyramids or as youthful
as Stonehenge.”
