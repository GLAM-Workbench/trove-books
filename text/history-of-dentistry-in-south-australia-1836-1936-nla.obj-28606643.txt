PREFACE
Executive desire to record their thanks
to all those who have contributed to this Book,
especially to Dr. T, D. Campbell, Mr. T. Ayles-
bury Brown and Mr. Alex Swann, who have
contributed articles; to all those who have
supplied information and photographs; and
last, but not least, to Dr. Arthur Chapman, to
whose indefatigable zeal almost the whole of
the early history and biographies are due, and
upon whom the bulk of the work of production
has fallen.


HE status and progress of a
profession is to be measured
by the life and work of
its members.


INTRODUCTION
( <9HE South Australian Branch of the Australian
Dental Association has compiled this history of the
Dental Profession in South Australia in honour of the
Centenary of the State, and in order to preserve a
record of the gallant pioneers who, in spite of many
difficulties associated with the development of a young-
country, so ably served the community and laid the
foundation of the present virile Association.
The history of the profession during the past hun-
dred years reveals a steady improvement in technical,
moral and intellectual achievement, and the rapid
progress made during the past 35 years cannot be
perfectly understood and appreciated unless the succes-
sion of events in the preceeding years be well known.
In order to compile the history of dentistry as it was
practised in South Australia before the beginning of
the 20th century (at which date official records become
available), information has been acquired from various
sources; namely, yearly almanacs and papers since 1839,
containing public advertisements, announcements and
obituary notices. Further contributions have been
gleaned from scrapbooks, letters, family albums and
other memorials in the possession of those descendants
of our pioneer dentists whom we have been able to trace.
Our endeavour has been to write history rather than
to make it; to state the past rather than to point the way
to the future. We feel that no one correctly informed
of the past will be disposed to take a pessimistic view


of the present nor a despondent view of the future.
Rather do we feel that the story of the hardships
endured, of the obstacles overcome, of the ethical ideals
advocated and steadfastly maintained, cannot fail to
inspire the enthusiasm and moral courage to carry on
the great work for the advancement of the splendid
public service in the health and happiness of the people
which the practice and progress of dentistry affords.
Unfortunately, the history of dentistry in South
Australia does not afford us a record of uninterrupted
progress. Therefore, in the production of this work we
have felt it our duty to record faithfully the disasters
and humiliations as well as the successes and triumphs
which have marked our advance.
Every effort has been made to authenticate the data
as they have been revealed to us. Should there be
perchance any error or a falling below the dignity of
history, we feel that, in placing before our readers a
reasonably true picture of the life and work of our pro-
fessional forebears, we can cheerfully bear the soft
reproach.
For reasons which seemed sufficient to the editorial
committee, and which should be obvious to all, the
biographies of men still living and practising have been
purposely omitted from this history, but all records in
hand will be carefully preserved for a future historian.
We have endeavoured, however, in this work to give
honour where honour is due to each and everyone, living
or dead, who has served the profession, openly and
publicly expressing his views, standing by his convic-
tions, serving faithfully in executive office, and striving


always for the advancement of the profession as a
whole.
We express deep appreciation of the invaluable
assistance rendered by the Librarian, The Public
Library of S.A. (H. Rutherford Purnell, Esq., F.L.A.),
and also by the Achivist (G. H. Pitt, Esq., 8.A.).
The Association is also deeply indebted to the Dental
Board of South Australia for very substantial assist-
ance towards the printing of this book, and to the
following gentlemen for donations received: —

CHAPTER I
EARLY HISTORY
Part I
A STUDY OF EARLY CONDITIONS
That dentists may thoroughly appreciate the ameni-
ties of dental practice in this Centenary Year of our
State, it is only necessary to review briefly the conditions
under which our pioneer practitioners landed and
laboured. After weary months of pitching and tossing
in a small over-crowded, evil-smelling “wind-jammer,”
our first London dentist arrived at Port Adelaide in the
middle 'Forties, when South Australia’s population
totalled only twenty thousand souls. (These were
j j \
still the days when people were regarded as spiritual
entities rather than mere civic units.) No soft-
cushioned, scientifically-sprung sedan was to glide them
to the capital city in ten minutes. Perched on the
hard wooden seat of the Rolls-Royce's unrecognisable
great-great-grandfather —a Port-cart —this man, his
young wife, and year-old baby, were slowly bumped
along the rough road through the straggling village of
Albert Town, to the Half-way House, Here passengers
and horses partook of suitable, but plain, refreshment.
Approaching the city, they crossed over a rough low
bridge near the Gaol, which sprawled across, rather
than spanned, the Torrens. After mighty London, rich
with historic memories, how dreary and uninviting must


this gloomy entrance to a new life in a new land have
seemed to the enterprising pioneers. Their spirits would
rise, however, as they sighted Trinity Church, with its
old-world touch, and they would take fresh courage as
they entered the already busy thoroughfare of Hindley
Street.
The long, eventful journey ended, the travellers
alighted in the vicinity of the Auction Mart Tavern and
the Commercial Exchange—but what a road-way! In
summer it provided a Sirocco-cloud of fine dust, and in
winter a veritable quagmire. But there were compen-
sations. Ihe side-walks were of wood —well raised
above the road level —the shops excellently stocked with
necessities; and our dental Adam and Eve full of hope
and resource. 1 hen and now! What a difference!
Where the beautiful City Bridge spans the garden-
fringed Torrens Lake, there was originally but a rough
ford across a reluctant stream. On its banks were
plainly evident the well-worn tracks of the natives who
held their nocturnal corroborees within a stone-throw
of the city proper. From this stream the pioneers
obtained their water supply in casks, sled-drawn or
carried on bullock wagg'ons.
It is a far call, too, from our 1936 surgeries, replete
with the latest equipment and comforts, to the consult-
ing conditions of those early days. The dentist as a
rule practised at his residence, his chair was anything
fi oni a box, with the wall as a head-rest, to an arm-
chair, which could be wheeled around to the hre when
the toils of the day were over. Spittoons ranged from


orthodox bar-room receptacles to a broken frying pan
half full of ashes or sand.
What a babel of sounds broke the stillness of the
settlement: creaking bullock waggons, sulphurous, but
highly effective language of drivers, screeching of
multi-coloured parrots, the lowing of cattle —and the
staccato crescendo to double forte in the valedictory
ceremonies of patient and tooth. Gone are all these —
and most surely the last-named with the advent of hypo-
dermically administered local anaesthetics in the early
eighteen-nineties.
Dental treatment of the ’Forties consisted in the
herculean uprooting —or shattering often —of teeth
with the now (happily) defunct ’’key," or (for anterior
extractions) with the crude precursors of the modern
forceps. Speed, brawn, and a firmly-held patient were
the three principal factors in success. “Cleaning and
scaling” was done with “scrapers.” Carious spots were
removed, and teeth also separated with various grades
of “files.” Cavities were opened with hand'burs and
excavators, and afterwards “stopped” with gold or tin
foil entirely with hand-pressed instruments —an opera-
tion commonly termed “plugging with soft gold.”
The “Amalgam War” was raging in Europe and
America and the older dentists still scorned to use the
“causa belli.” This amalgam, the “Royal Mineral Suc-
cedaneum” of our ancestors, inserted into cavities from
which the carious “bone,” or gangrene as it was then
termed, had not been removed, had proved to be a curse
rather than a blessing. Its use by charlatan dentists
brought about the formation of Associations amongst


the legitimate practitioners, here as indeed all over the
world.
The practice of substituting artificial for natural
teeth was then universally known as “Mechanical Den-
tistry,” as the term “Dental Prosthesis” was as yet
unconceived. The mineral tooth was in the experi-
mental stage and mostly unreliable. Artificial teeth
were still carved from the tusks of animals, and even
human and bovine teeth were in common use. Full
dentures were carved from solid ivory, and gold base
plates were generally used to carry the crude substitutes
available.
With respect to professional intercourse and
“ethics,” it may be said that in the early days of the
State, dentists (as well as physicians) jealously guarded
their “secrets,” and none but an apprentice was privy
to their “methods or principles” of treatment. (Some
aspects of the Hippocratic Law were very slow to die.)
Mr. Norman, in his first announcement, refers to “his
system of treatment,” and other men of contemporary
date frequently claimed to conduct their practices
“according to the latest London ‘principles’.” In those
early days the prevention of dental troubles was
“assured by cleanliness,” and pyorrhoea alveolaris was
already the recognised battle ground of localists versus
constitutionalists. Fortunately, at that time, the modern
sciences of “dietetics and bacteriology, with its grand-
sons “auto-infection” and “allergy,” had not arrived to
further complicate the issue, and to add to the bewilder-
ment of the mere layman, already sufficiently cowed by
the Latin formulary and jargon of the professional man.


“Cupping” and “blood-letting” were frequently
resorted to, and “scarification of the gums” was in
general use.
Residents were not, however, without the amenities
of mouth hygiene. In 1842 Rowland’s “Odonto or
Pearl Dentifrice” was on sale at 2/9 per box, duty free,
and the claims of its proprietors were no less specious
and panegyric than those of the present day. The fol-
lowing is reprinted from a contemporary journal: —
“A white powder of Oriental herbs of the most delightful fragrance.
Eradicates tartar and decay spots from the teeth, preserves the enamel
and fixes the teeth firmly in their sockets, rendering them delicately
white. Being anti-scorbutic it eradicates the scurvy from the gums,
strengthens, braces and renders them of a healthy red; it removes
unpleasant tastes from the mouth which often remain after fevers,
taking medicine, etc., and imparts a delightful fragrance to the breath."
All honour to our pioneer dentists. Under such
conditions they laboured faithfully with the best they
had. Fortunately, the dawn of modern science, which
was not greatly manifest until the ’Eighties, has brought
ever increasing enlightenment to the profession and
benefit to the people. Time has moved on apace. Less
than half a century ago, dentists now practising on “the
most beautiful boulevard in the Southern Hemisphere”
saw flocks of sheep and herds of cattle being driven past
their front doors to the market at the western end of
North Terrace, while traffic was reduced to a standstill
to allow their progress.
So to those good old days and men, “Ale atque vale.’'
The bullock dray has evolved into the tram and train;
the cart into the motor car; and the tallow-candle lan-
tern has become the dazzling arc-lights of the great
city. “Tcmpora mutantur ct nos mutamur in illis .”


Part II
A REVIEW OF EARLY HISTORY
The story of dentistry in South Australia falls more
or less naturally into two well defined periods, one ante'
dating and the other post-dating the inauguration of
legislative control, associational activity and official
educational effort. The first legal enactment was “The
Dentists’ Act 1902,” the first Dentists’ Register was
issued in 1903, and the first Dental Society came into
being in 1907, so that the earlier history of dentistry in
this State may be said to belong entirely to the 19th
century.
Authentic records of the earliest years are difficult
to obtain, and there is little remaining if we except such
newspaper announcements as appeared from time to
time. Institutional dentistry was unknown and official
records non-existent. There was nothing in the nature
of local monuments of stone and brick connected with
dental progress to encourage a historical sense in the
pioneer dentists, so that we are entirely without any
record left by the practitioners themselves concerning
their professional life.
Nevertheless, our profession has its roots deep in
the dawn of this State. In our first accredited dental
surgeon, Robert Norman, Esq., we have indeed a link
with its very birth. A contemporary of those who con-
ceived and made possible the colonization of South
Australia, this gentleman, then practising dentistry in
London —a man of culture, enterprise and undoubted
imagination—became an original subscriber to the


colonization project in 1834. Ten years later, fully
believing in the future of the young British province,
he himself came to Adelaide to engage in the practice
of his profession.
The Earliest Records of Dental Service
For the first four years following the proclamation
of the State as a British province, there is no record of
any established dental service. It would appear that,
apart from the dilettante efforts of blacksmiths and
others, the original settlers had to be content with such
relief from the pains and aches of dental troubles as
resident, or visiting surgeons and apothecaries could
effect by extraction of diseased teeth.
In 1840, however, Bayldon & Co., Chemists, of
Hindley Street, and one Mr. Durie, Surgeon R.N., also
of Hindley Street, tendered their services to the people
in all operations of dental surgery, the former definitely
advertising the supply of artificial teeth. With the
advent of Air. Norman in 1844, and of Mr. Par doe in
1849, there became available all operations peculiar to
dentistry, including the regulation of children’s teeth
and the fitting of false noses and palates. The latter is
an eloquent reminder of the days preceding the conquest
of the treponema pallidum.
The ’Fifties
Immediately following the Victorian Gold Rush,
when Adelaide was left with hardly an able-bodied man
in residence, and with the abounding prosperity of the
’Fifties, there occurred a noticeable increase in the
number of dentists in the capital. During this decade
there were at least twelve dentists practising in the city,


and visits were periodically made to Gawler, Kapunda
and Burra Burra, in which latter township one J. A.
Isaacs, Chemist and Druggist, appears to have rendered
considerable dental service. J. R. Gurner, Esq., the
earliest practitioner to hold an E.D.S., R.C.S., settled
in Adelaide during this period. The introduction of
“laughing gas” must have been greatly appreciated by
those able to avail themselves of it; we note in this
period the use of “incorrodible mineral teeth” and the
“new gum coloured gutta percha” for denture bases.
Cupping and bloodletting were still everyday therapeutic
measures, and the distinctive terms “Surgeon Dentist”
and “Mechanical Dentist” appeared, whereas hitherto
the term “Dental Surgeon” had been the only one in use.
In these early days life was free and spacious, and
public questions were near to the hearts of all, because
public, business and private life were full of hazard.
South Australia was isolated not only from the out-
side world, but also from its immediate neighbours
Supplies of instruments and appliances peculiar to den-
tistry had to be secured from England, and each man,
importing for himself alone, was subject to unavoidable
delays and much anxiety.
Many of our early dentists, no doubt, as did the
physicians of those days, depended for a living not only
upon the proceeds of their profession, but also upon the
conjoint enterprises of agricultural, pastoral and mining-
interests.
The ’Sixties
In the Sixties the ranks of the dental profession
\\ ei e not significantly augmented. One Solomon
Meyers, however, destined to practise for over thirty

years in Adelaide, established himself and also paid
regular visits to Port Adelaide. This is the first
authentic record we have of an accredited dentist at the
chief sea-port town. We note in this decade the advent
of “self-adhesion plates.”
The ’Seventies
With another period of prosperity additions to the
ranks of the profession were again evident, notably the
arrival of Dr. H. H. Norman, H. Barron Rodway, Escp,
L.D.S., R.C.S. (Eng.), and L. N. Blackmore from
London. The last named gentleman also visited Port
Adelaide regularly, practising at F. H. Faulding's
premises. In this decade Glenelg was visited by Mr.
Meyers—the first record of a dental surgeon practising
in our foundation town. We find gold, platinum and
vulcanite in use for artificial denture bases, and nitrous
oxide gas largely employed for extractions.
The ’Eighties
These were years of acute depression, and there was
widespread ruin owing to the collapse of the land boom.
Although there was only one practising dentist holding
an American degree, the first signs of so-called “Ameri-
can Dentistry” appeared. We note in 1888 that one
dentist possessed a telephone, Dr. H. H. Norman,
probably the first of our profession in Adelaide to enjoy
both the annoyances and the benefits of this now indis-
pensible service. In the latter years of the decade
cocaine solution was introduced as a local anaesthetic.
Adelaide and Melbourne were linked at this time by the
running of express trains, which led to frequent short
visits from Melbourne dentists, and no doubt played its
part in the permanent settlement of many in the years
to follow.


Notable additions to the ranks of Adelaide dentists
in the ’Eighties were G. W. Trott, Esq., L.D.S., R.C.S.
(Eng.) ; H. W. Harrison, Esq., L.D.S., R.C.S. (Edin.);
and Peter Crank, Esq., L.D.S., R.C.S. (Eng.), D.M.D.
(Harvard, U.S.A.); and J. T. Hardy, who, alone of
these, is still in active practise.
The ’Nineties
This decade is remarkable for a large influx of
dentists of all kinds —of good, of doubtful, and of no
qualification whatsoever —the establishment of dental
companies and institutes and dental parlours, and the
introduction of all the paraphernalia of charlatanism,
together with a marked increase in competitive adver-
tising and intense price cutting. The passing of the
Dentists' Act in the neighbouring State of Victoria was
no doubt largely responsible for this.
The first dentists practised within 200 yards of the
junction of King William Street with Rundle and
Hindley Streets —the centre of the town. The concen-
tration upon North Terrace is of much later date,
although Mr. Norman in 1847, and Mr. Pardoe in 1851,
followed by Mr. Gurner in 1858, may be said to have
led the way, and as late as 1876 the City Directory
reveals only three dentists practising in this thorough-
fare.
In general it may be said that the area encompassed
by the following streets embraced all the dental prac-
tices from the earliest days.
RUNDLE ST. and HINDLEY ST., from Pulteney St. to Leigh St.
KING WILLIAM ST., from North Terrace to Victoria Square.
FLINDERS ST., from Pulteney St. to Victoria Square.

BIOGRAPHIES
FOREWORD
We include the following biographical sketches because
we feel that they offer a deep human interest without which
this history would be incomplete. We give no warranty as to
absolute authenticity and do not think any apology necessary
for the seeming completeness of some and the obvious meagre-
ness of others.. We merely give what we have.
THE NORMAN FAMILY
Mr. John Norman, with his wife and family of four, came
to South Australia from England in 1839, and with them his
sister and her husband, Mr. Septimus Herbert, J.P. In 1844,
John Norman’s brother Robert, arrived with his mother, wife
and one-year-old son. This family were original subscribers
to the South Australian colonization project of 1834 in Lon-
don, and upon arrival selected the large property of which the
present town of Normanville and district are the centre.
ROBERT NORMAN enjoys the honour of being South
Australia’s first dental surgeon. Born in 1807, he later became
a pupil of Mr. Helsby, of Manchester. After 18 years’ practice
in London he came to Adelaide in the good ship “Taglioni,”
and commenced practice in Wright Street (see S.A. “Regis-
ter,” Oct. 5, 1844 —Norman Street, off Wright Street, is named
after him). In July, 1847, he established himself at “Belle
Vue House,” North Terrace, thus being the first dental
surgeon to practise in this thoroughfare. (“Belle Vue House”
occupied a site immediately east of G. & R. Wills Warehouse.)
Here he practised for 37 years. He died in 1883, aged 76, and
was interred at Normanville.. Robert married Miss Hayes (a
daughter of a London dentist), and had six sons and two
daughters. Three sons became dental surgeons and one a
physician. He was a man of wide culture and many interests.
He spoke Irish, Lrench and Italian, was highly musical
(possessing a fine tenor voice), a keen litterateur, and a Shake-
spearian scholar. Apart from his profession his manual


Herbert Hayes Norman


dexterity is evidenced, in that he was an excellent billiardist
and an accomplished swordsman. In 1858 he was a member
of the Royal College of Dentists and a Corresponding Member
of the Odontological Society of London, which in ’63 became
the Odontological Society of England.
HERBERT HAYES NORMAN, eldest son of Robert Nor-
man. was one year old when he came to South Australia in
1844. He was educated mainly at St. Peter’s College. In
1859 he began a six years’ apprenticeship with his father,
during which time he was for five years with the Reedbeds
Cavalry, and won many trophies for swimming and rifle shoot-
ing. About 1866 he went to America and was graduated
Doctor of Dental Surgery with honours at New Orleans
Dental College in 1871. He returned to Adelaide in 1872 after
spending some time in London (see S.A. “Register,” Feb. 1,
1872). He lived and practised at “Rockville House,” North
Terrace, from 1875-1882, when he moved his residence to Hill
Street, North Adelaide. Always of a vigorous temperament,
a brilliant son of a brilliant father, he was engaged in active
practice for 52 years, a tribute to his remarkable virility.. With
his brother-in-law, the Hon. j. L. Parsons, he worked hard
for the Dentists’ Act in South Australia. Dr. Norman was
fruitful in mechanical inventions, and his engrossing hobbies
were French Crayon drawing and amateur photography. He
died in 1926, aged 83 years. Dr. Norman married a daughter
of Mr. Edward Dewhirst, of the Education Department, and
had three sons and three daughters.
ROGER NORMAN succeeded his father, Robert, in 1878,
at “Belle Vue House,” but went to Western Australian in
1883.. His brother, MR. LESLIE NORMAN, continued the
practice until 1887 at “Belle Vue House,” subsequently prac-
tising for many years in other parts of Adelaide.
JOHN ROBERT BURNER was born at Bath. March 6,
1832. He first studied in England, Florence and Milan,
and came to Australia as a young man. In 1858 we
find him in partnership with Mr. E. A. Phillips, practising
on North Terrace. This firm was appointed dental surgeons
to the Adelaide Hospital in 1859—probably the first appoint-
ment to that position. In 1876 he returned to England to

study, and his name appears in the Dentists’ Register as
L.D.S., R.C.S. (Eng.) in 1878. The same year he returned to
South Australia and practised at “Ramsay House,” North
Terrace. (Verco Buildings occupies this site today.) He
retired in 1897, and died at his residence, Fitzroy Terrace, on
June 11, 1900, aged 69 years. Professionally he enjoyed a very
considerable practice. His tastes and interests apart from
his profession were almost entirely literary. He was very
musical, and greatly interested in botany, being a member of
the Field Naturalists’ Society. Prominent in Freemasonry,
he became a member of three Lodges. He was a foundation
member of the Lodge St. Albans, was the originator of the
Masters and Wardens’ Association, and did most commend-
able work as principal editor of the “S.A. Freemason.” He
was Grand Standard Bearer in 1885, Vice-President of the
Board of General Purposes in 1885, and W.M. of the Lodge of
Friendship, 1886-1888. Mr. Gurner was twice married, his
first wife being a Miss Pearce, by whom he had two children.
In 1871 he married Louisa Jane Bakewell, by whom he had
four children.
SOLOMON MEYERS originally practised at Bold Street,
Liverpool, and came to Australia about 1856, residing for
several years in Victoria. He was in active practice in South
Australia from 1861 to 1890, and died in S.A. in 1900. His
family is closelv associated with the dental profession both
in England and Australia. Mr. Meyers married Miss Adelaide
Malian, a daughter of Mr. George Malian, dental surgeon of
London, three descendants of whom subsequently practised
in Australia, namely, Mr. H. D. Malian, of Adelaide; Mr.
Louis Malian, of Brisbane ; and Mr. Albert M. Malian, of Perth.
The first-named gentleman is very well known in South Aus-
tralia, and has notably served the profession as a member of
the Dental Board and in associational office. Mr. Meyers had
14 children, three of whom were dental surgeons; Edward,
who practised for a short time in Adelaide, and afterwards
for many years at Warrnambool; Valeck, who practised in
Adelaide under the name of Mr. Meyer Edward from 1879;
and Ernest, who was in Adelaide for a short period, and there-
after in Brisbane. Mr. Meyers was the first dental surgeon

to practise at Port Adelaide (1867), where he consulted at
Mr. Wald’s, watchmaker, Commercial Road, and at Glenelg

THE BLACKMORE FAMILY
The three original members who settled in Adelaide were
sons of Mr. Edward Ellicott Blackmore, dental surgeon, of
Barnstable, Devon, whose wife was a daughter of Dr. New-
bolt, of Bath, a son of Sir Thomas Newbolt, gentleman-in-
arms to Queen Anne. Little is known of their private interests
beyond the fact that two of the brothers were closely associ-
ated with the initiation of lifesaving in the swimming clubs.
All the Blackmore’s married, and their descendants are widely
scattered in the States of the Commonwealth today.
LIONEL NEWBOLT BLACKMORE formerly dentist to
the South Devon Dispensary, arrived in Adelaide in 1870,
where for upwards of 25 years he enjoyed a large and lucrative
practice in Flinders Street. He visited England and America
in 1876, his brother, Mr. Bruce Blackmore. acting as his
attorney and manager of his practice. In an old plan of North
Terrace he is shown as occupying “Belle A ue House” in 1885,
the late residence of Mr. Robert Norman.. He was probably
the first to use Nitrous Oxide Gas as a general anaesthetic for
dental operations in Adelaide.
NELSON NEWBOLT BLACKMORE, for seven years sur-
geon dentist to the North Devon Hospital, and 20 years at
Cavendish Square, London, was established at North terrace
West (corner of Bank Street) in 1873, where he practised for
about 20 years. He went to England in 1914, and returning
to Perth in 1915, died in 1917 at the age of 83.
BRUCE BLACKMORE was associated with both his
brothers alternatively for several years, and subsequently
engaged in practice on his own account. He died in Adelaide
in 1922 at the age of 71.
EDWARD NEWBOLT BLACKMORE was a son of Mr.
Nelson Blackmore. He practised in Adelaide during the last
decade of the 19th century, and afterwards in Perth for many
years until he died in 1928.


Nelson Newbolt Blackmore


W. H. HARRISON, Ph.C. (Lend.), L.D.S., R.C.S. (Edin.),
was the only son of Rev. W. Harrison (for many years a
missionary in British Guiana). He was born in England in
1852. About 1882 he commenced business as a pharmacist in
Adelaide, and was President of the first Pharmaceutical
Society in South Australia from 1885 to 1889. He is described
by his contemporaries as the clearest thinker and the most
logical debater in their Council.. Upon his return from a trip
to England he devoted his whole time to the practice of den-
tistry, and played an active part in the promotion of the first
Dentists’ Act in South Australia. He died in 1905.
H. BARRON RODWAY, L.D.S., R.C.S. (Eng.), gained his
diploma in 1878, and came to Adelaide in the same year. After
a short partnership with Mr. J. R. Gurner he commenced
practice on his own account on North d errace (opp. the
Institute). Here he was joined by Mr. G. W. d rott in 1884,
and the firm of Rodway & Trott continued till 1899, when
Mr. Rodway retired. He died in W.A. in 1934..
GEORGE WILLIAM TROTT, L.D.S., R.C.S. (Eng.), was born
in Devonshire, England, 1862. He joined Mr. H. Barron Rod-
way in practice at 34 North d errace in 1884. 1 hey were
joined by Mr. F. T. dTott, L.D.S., R.C.S., in 1897. Mr. G. \\ .
Trott took an active part in the promotion of the first Dentists’
Act in South Australia, and was an Hon. Dental Surgeon to
the Adelaide Hospital for many years. He died at Glenelg
in 1936, aged 74. He had seven children, two of whom,
Arthur G. Trott, L.D.S., R.C.S. (Eng.), D.D.S. (Penn.), and
Leonard W. Trott, D.D.S. (Penn.), still continue the practice.
PETER CRANK, L.D.S., R.C.S. (Eng.), D.M.D. (Harv., U.S.A.),
the son of Mr. Joseph Crank, of Beulah Road, Norwood, was
born in 1860. He was educated at Mr. Thomas Caterer’s
School, and from 1871-1873 at Prince Alfred College. Choos-
ing dentistry as his career, he went to England, where he
was apprenticed to Mr. Ludbrook, L.D.S., R.C.S., at Chestei,

and took his L.D.S., R.C.S.. (Eng.) in 1884. From there he
went to America and took his D.M.D. (Harvard) in 1887.
Returning to England he practised for some time as assistant
to Dr. Edwin James Richardson, of London. He came back
to South Australia about 1888, and established a practise at
North Terrace, opposite the University.. Later he built the
premises known as Harvard Chambers on North Terrace,
where he practised from 1902 to 1920. Dr. Crank was the only
dentist to hold the office of President of the Dental Board of
S.A., and was many years Honorary Dental Surgeon at the
Adelaide Hospital. He was also a President of the Odonto-
logical Society of S.A. He was an enthusiastic pioneer motor-
ist, and a member of the Automobile Club of S.A. from 1905
to 1914. He retired in 1920, and died at his home at Unley
Park in September. 1931, aged 71 years.
WILLIAM THEODORE SHANASY, D.D.S. (Univ. of
California), was born at Angas Park in 1865. He began the
study of dentistry in conjunction with pharmacy in 1883, was
registered by the Dental Board of Victoria in 1891, and passed
the qualifying examination of the Melbourne College of
Pharmacy in 1892. Practising first at Mt. Gambier, he came
to Adelaide in 1899. Two years later he went to America,
where in 1904 he was graduated D.D.S,. at L niversity of
California, and subsequently practised in Adelaide for 18 years.
Dr. Shanasy was the virtual founder of the Odontological
Society of S.A., and was President in 1913. He was a member
of the first Dental Faculty, holding the lectureship in Materia
Medica and Therapeutics, and an Hon. Dental Surgeon at the
Dental Hospital. He married Miss Anita Barker in 1894,
having one son, Dr. W. Bonwill Shanasy. Upon his retire-
ment from practice in 1921 he was made an Hon. Member of
the State Dental Society.. He died in December, 1922, aged
57 vears.

A LIST OF EARLY PRACTITIONERS
Owing to the absence of official records before 1902, the list has been prepared
from a search of newspapers and directories. Any omissions or incorrect dates must
be ascribed to the meagre source of information.


CHAPTER II
LEGISLATION
PREAMBLE
South Australia enjoys the somewhat equivocal
distinction of being the last State to exercise statutory
control of the practice of dentistry. Mainly as a result
of legislation in neighbouring States, the numbers of
the lesser qualified, and wholly unqualified, had multi-
plied considerably, and during the late nineties the press
correspondence and the questions in Parliament reveal
general dissatisfaction regarding the prevailing stan-
dards of dental service.
On 11th of August, 1898, the Government was asked
to introduce legislation similar to that in Victoria. It
was not, however, until 20th November, 1901, that a
Bill was introduced “to provide for the registration of
persons qualified to practise dentistry." Its sponsor
stated that “it was a remarkable fact that in South
Australia there were no safeguards to secure qualifica-
tion and competence in dentists, and I believe there is
no country in the Southern Hemisphere without such
provision except South Australia."
The Bill was prepared gratuitously by Mr. Louis
von Doussa, M.P., a well-known solicitor, in response
to the suggestions of a number of dentists practising in
Adelaide (see Chapter VI). The Bill was withdrawn
by consent, but in the light of subsequent history some
notation of its provisions is justified.


Notes on the Bill of 1901
1. The original draft specifically prohibited unregistered persons from
practising under the supervision of registered dentists. The clause
“unless under his or her immediate supervision” was added in Com-
mittee, with the express purpose of providing for the training of
articled pupils, and only for that purpose, as shown by the following
statements made by responsible Ministers, namely: “That would
provide all that was necessary,” and that would be “an effective
provision against unqualified persons seeking cover of persons who
were qualified.”*
2. The original draft did not allow for the registration of companies.
3. The main contentions which wrecked the Bill were: —
(a) The professional membership of the Dental Board.
(b) The administration of anaesthetics by dentists.
(c) The antagonism of diploma-men in both medical and dental
professions against those who had established themselves with-
out any academic or apprenticeship qualification.
THE DENTISTS’ ACT 1902
Assented to November 13, 1902.
By this Act, the practice of dentistry in South Aus-
tralia was made subject to Statute Law. A dentist was
defined as “a person entitled to be registered under the
Act.” This Act vested the administration of the Act
in a Dental Board, and empowered the Board to make
regulations and to conduct examinations. It also pre-
scribed the keeping of a Dentists’ Register and the
appointment of a Registrar. Plates and signs were
subjected to certain limitations, and were to be used only
by registered persons. Unregistered persons were for-
bidden to act for registered persons, and restrictions
were placed upon the use of anaesthetics.
* In this chapter all quotations are taken from the official record of Parliamentary
Deb ates. However misleading or erroneous they be, they serve to record the hopes
and aspirations of the times. In actual fact, most of the prognostications and promises
thereby exhibited have failed to materialise.


Notes on the Bill of 1902
The re-drafted 1901 Bill, which was destined to become South
Australia’s first Dentists’ Act, was introduced in July, 1902. In the
interval, more or less agreement had been reached concerning those
who were to he regarded as eligible for registration.
Two of its provisions were strenuously debated: —>
1. The inclusion of Medical Men and Laymen on the Board and
the provision for Dentists, with Diplomas only.
A memorial was presented supporting the proposed constitution of
the Dental Board as provided in the Bill and was signed: B. Thomson,
J. T. Hardy, A. Swann, F. Miles, E. Wagner, B. Cohen, E. A. Lundy,
W. Siebert, A. Crosland, A. Paice, T. V. Thomson, J. W. Hosking.
It was stated that there were 80 dentists in Adelaide, only eight
of whom were qualified by diploma.
2. The Administration of Anaesthetics.
A memorial was also sent in by medical men stating, inter alia,
“that persons not professionally qualified should not administer anaes-
thetics except in the presence of a duly qualified medical man.’’ and
was signed by E. W. Way, J. A. G. Hamilton, C. E. Todd, A. A. Hamil-
ton and R. H. Marten.
THE DENTISTS’ ACT AMENDMENT ACT 1904
Assented to November 24, 1904.
This Act, inter alia, defined dentistry, reduced the
membership of the Board from 6 to 5, forbade the use
of the letters R.D.S., and instituted the annual licence
fee. It also provided that the D.D.S. and D.M.D.
deo-rees of colleges, which were members of the National
O O’
Association of Dental Faculties of U.S.A., could he
registered upon the holders passing a certain examina-
tion.
Notes on Bill of 1904
As early as July, 1903, it was appreciated that the 1902 Act was
defective, in that the Board was unable to exclude undesirable persons.
In fact, during the next three months, questions appeared ten times on
the Parliamentary notice papers urging the Government to bring in a
new Bill. This was introduced in September, 1904. Its sponsor stated:
“Litigation had shown a definition of dentistry was essential, and that
the clause prohibiting the use of titles was absolutely unworkable. The
Board had been accused of autocratic action and had resigned.”
The inclusion of medical men and laymen on the Board was again
hotly contested, and “the Constitution of the Medical and Pharmacy


Boards was quoted in support of a Dental Board composed entirely of
dentists.
Attention was drawn to the fact that the 1902 Act prohibited the
registration of companies and institutes, but the Attorney General
assured members that this Act (1904) would definitely exclude com-
panies.
There was considerable opposition to the institution of a £2/2/-
annual licence fee, and especially to the requirement to pay all arrears
if absent from the State, or out of practice, for some years.
The Commissioner of Public Works pointed out that “it was the
practice to tour the country under the name of a qualified dentist, and
harm was done the people by these unskilful operators. Clause 9 was
intended to prevent this being done in the future." This statement
is of interest, for we find eleven years later, in 1915, the following
question put to Parliament; “In view of the fact that a great many
so-called dentists or dental practitioners are touring the country pulling
teeth, and that they have no qualifications, is it the intention of the
Government to introduce an amending Bill to give legally qualified men
and also the public some protection?”
1912—A BILL FOR AN ACT TO FURTHER AMEND
THE DENTISTS’ ACT
Prepared by Mr. Paris Nesbit, K.C.
Notes on the Bill of 1912
This Bill was thrown out at the second reading. Historically, it
is of the greatest importance, as in 1917 all its provisions were adopted.
It serves to record the fact that the Dental Board, and the qualified
profession generally, were fully cognisant of the impotence of the 1904
Act to secure to the public a progressively raised standard of dental
service within the State.
THE DENTISTS’ ACT FURTHER AMENDMENT
ACT 1917
Assented to November 15, 1917.
This Act, inter alia, included a more comprehensive
definition of dentistry, prohibited practice by unqualified
persons, and further, prohibited signs and the use of
certain letters and misleading- advertisements. It also
marks the introduction of compulsory notification of
operative dental assistants, limiting the number to two
per registered dentist, and also providing for their
registration upon passing a prescribed examination.


Notes on Bill of 1917
The sponsor of this Bill pointed out that the object of the 1902
Act and 1904 Amendment was the “protection of the public from
unregistered and presumably unskilful practitioners, and also the raising
of the standard of dentistry in the State by instituting a scheme of
dental education which would benefit both the public and the dentists.
. . . From the first the penal clauses proved ineffective to convict
unregistered persons. I am assured by the Dental Board that if this
Act is passed it will he able to exercise the powers it was originally
intended to possess.”
“The Bill is also the result of an Agreement between the Dental
Board and the Dental Operatives’ Association. It was very necessary
that very strict supervision should he given over those who will come
under the provisions of this Bill, and we do not want what other Acts
have failed to stop, namely, that dentists may stay at home while others
not registered practise in the country.”
The Minister indicated that a movement was on foot to establish
dental clinics in the State, and that the University of Adelaide and
the Adelaide Hospital would he able to provide facilities for men to
qualify.
THE DENTISTS’ ACT FURTHER AMENDMENT
ACTS 1918 and 1921
These Acts made special provision for operative
dental assistants on Active Service during the Great
War, and allowed extension of time for passing exam-
ination in cases of sickness or other causes.
1930—A BILL TO FURTHER AMEND THE DENTISTS’
ACT 1902
Prepared by Hon. H. Tassie.
As it was recognised early in the debate that this
Bill did not prevent a recurrence of operative dental
assistants for all time, it was withdrawn on the assur-
ance of the Dental Board to “re-draft the whole Bill
to provide for all classes of operative dental assistants."
The Bill is interesting in that it provided for a
Dental Board of five dentists, the Chairman or Presi-
dent to be elected by such members. This marks the


second attempt to have a Board so constituted. The
proposal, however, was for some reason not submitted
in the re-drafted Bill of the following year. It is also
of interest in that a provision that the Dental Board
should hold an Annual Meeting of Registered Dentists,
to submit a report and balance-sheet, was not included
in the re-drafted Bill.
THE DENTISTS’ ACT 1931
Assented to December 2, 1931.
This Act, inter alia, changed the constitution of the
Board, and increased the scope of its activities in order
that it might carry out public education on dental mat"
ters; it provided for the licensing of dental operative
assistants, and their registration upon passing certain
prescribed examinations. It also brought dental clinics
under statutory control, and further prohibited practice
for reward by unqualified persons. The registration of
American and Canadian degrees was withdrawn, being
omitted from the schedule of registrable diplomas. The
judicial powers of the Board were generally increased.
Notes on the Bill of 1931
The re-drafted Bill of 1930, prepared by Mr. Thomson, K.C.,
achieved the dual purpose of consolidating the Dentists' Acts, and also
of introducing many valuable amendments. In particular, it gave the
Dental Board real power to suppress unqualified practice, in regard to
which the intention of all previous Acts had proved lamentably
inefficient.
The Bill passed both Houses with little opposition, mainly as a
result of a statement by the Minister in charge of it, that “it can be
claimed that the Bill fully meets the requirements of every section of
the profession, and has been unanimously endorsed by the three dental
bodies concerned, namely the Dental Board, the South Australian
Branch of the A.D.A., and the Operative Dental Assistants’ Asso-
ciation.”
Such, however, was not the case. The Minister in question had
evidently not been fully informed. Part IV, relating to operative


dental assistants, and Schedule 11, relating to registrable qualifications,
since they had not been presented to the A.D.A. for consideration, had
not received the endorsement of that body. The effect of Schedule II
was to withdraw from the Board a power, exercised by it since 1904,
of placing upon the Register certain American and Canadian degrees,
and to admit holders of the same to the Register by examination. This
was, in effect, an important repeal of rights and privileges previously
enjoyed, and as such was worthy of serious debate. Owing no doubt to
the Minister’s assurance, abovementioned, this Schedule was passed
without debate.
The Bill, in its totality, must be regarded as one expressing the
compromise of the Board, with exigent circumstances, and the expres-
sion of the Board’s will in other matters, rather than that of any con-
sidered agreement on the part of the A.D.A., or of the profession
generally.
THE DENTISTS’ ACT AMENDMENT ACT 1932
This Bill was introduced at the importunity of the
Operative Assistants Association. In the main, the Act
allowed concessions to several unsuccessful examinees,
under Part IV of the 1931 Act, and prescribed that
future examiners be approved by the Faculty of Den-
tistry of the University of Adelaide. It further defined
the scope of study and examination for certain other
examinees under the same Act.

CHAPTER 111
THE DENTAL BOARD
PREAMBLE
The Dental Board is a corporate body with perpetual
succession, a common seal, and power to acquire and
hold land. It was created by Parliament in 1902, and
charged with the function of administering the Dentists’
Acts from time to time in force, which, according to the
preamble of the first Act of 1902, are made and pro-
claimed in order to “regulate the practice of dentistry
within the State of SoutJi Australia."
Under the first Act, the Board’s duties were
relatively simple, and strictly limited in scope. In the
passing of the years, however, several amendments to
the original Act have gradually widened the Board s
activities, and materially increased its powers. Whereas
the first Board acted almost solely as a tribunal to con-
sider the qualifications of applicants for registration,
the functions of subsequent Boards have been as
follows: —
1. Registration.
2. Education of Dental Students.
3. Examination of applicants for registration.
4. The education of the public in dental health matters.
5. Suppression of unregistered practice and “covering.”
6. Suppression of unprofessional conduct.
7. The initiation of dental legislation.
8. The statutory power of summary jurisdiction.
EARLY HISTORY
The initial meeting was held at the Board Room of
the Adelaide Hospital on 12th December, 1902.


The earlier meetings were confined to consideration
of applications for registration, and the first publication
of the Dental Register containing the names of 58 den-
tists appeared in the Government Gazette in January,
1903.
One of the first decisions was that registration in
other States would not be in itself an acceptable quali-
fication in South Australia. This was later upheld by
the Supreme Court. Another decision, and one which
involved considerable litigation, had reference to the
registration of chemists who had been extracting teeth.
In the main, the Courts agreed with the Board that this
practice did not constitute the bona fide practice of den-
tistry as a principal. The Board was compelled, how-
ever, by a writ of mandamus issued out of the Supreme
Court, to register one such appellant, whereupon it
immediately resigned as a body.f
The next Board was not appointed until January 13,
1904, though in the meantime several appeals were
heard, in which the Attorney-General acted for the
Board. This second Board is of special interest in that
it is the only one to which a dentist has been elected
President. From the many decisions given by the
Supreme Court, it was now apparent that the 1902 Act
had serious defects, mainly, that it did not confine the
practice of dentistry to registered persons. At the
request of the Board, the Chief Secretary introduced a
new Bill in September, 1904, which, after many amend-
ments, became law in November of that year 4
t Fisk v. Dental Board of S.A.
X For further details regarding legislation see Chapter 11.


This new Act also proved insufficient, and the Board
of 1906 again approached the Government for amend-
ments, unfortunately without success, and from that
time until 1917 this subject was continually on the
Agenda.
EDUCATION AND EXAMINATION
One of the first subjects to receive the attention of
the 1905 Board was that of dental education. A sub-
committee, consisting of Dr. A. M. Cudmore and Mr.
H. Gill Williams, was responsible for drafting the
Regulations, which became law on 15th October, 1905.
The outstanding feature of these Regulations was the
provision for a course of study at the University, com-
bined with a minimum of four years apprenticeship to
a registered dentist, as the minimum qualification for
examination for registration in South Australia.*
Facilities were also provided for the examination
of persons holding American and other foreign degrees,
and for those who had served apprenticeship prior to
the passing of the 1902 Act. The first examination was
held on November 21, 1905. The Dental Board-
University Course was commenced on 13th March,
1906, and the first persons to complete it were registered
in January, 1911. The first lecturer appointed was
H. Gill Williams, L.D.S., R.C.S. (Eng.), in Dental
Surgery and Pathology.
The year 1907 ( the year in which the Odontological
Society was formed) brought forth the suggestion of a
degree or diploma course to be established at the Univer-
sity, and a sub-committee of the Board, consisting of
Drs. H. S. Newland, P. Crank, and Mr. H. Gill Wil-
* For further details regarding education see Chafter IV, Part 11.


Hams, reported favourably to the Board, 1 his formed
the basis upon which, fourteen years later, a joint
committee of the existing Dental Societies and the
University finally succeeded in establishing the B.D.S.
Course at the University.
Since 1905 the Board has provided lecturers and
examiners for the Course prescribed by the Regulations,
and has scrupulously adopted the standard so prescribed
as a minimum qualification for registration, both for its
indentured pupils and for those holding foreign degrees.
While at no time has the Board of itself ever departed
from this policy to maintain and enhance the standard
of qualification originally prescribed as a minimum for
registration, it has twice been obliged to accept a modi-
fication under special circumstances. In 1917, and again
in 1931, as a result of pressure from a body of persons
who had established themselves in the dental profession
by reason of unexpected opportunities afforded by exist-
ing legislation, Parliament granted certain rights and
privileges in respect of the qualifying examination. In
the former instance 38 persons were admitted to the
Register, and likewise in the latter circumstances, 24
persons have, up to date, been so admitted.
PUBLIC EDUCATION IN DENTAL HEALTH
Following the English precedent, the Board was
allotted the duty of educating the public in dental health
matters by the Dentists’ Act of 1931. Considerable
propaganda matter has been, and is still being, distri-
buted. The Board has a moving picture plant which is
in continuous operation, showing films in dental health
education in all the country schools. This highly com-


menable procedure has been greatly aided by the Junior
Red Cross, with the co-operation of the Director of
Education.
THE SUPPRESSION OF UNQUALIFIED PRACTICE
AND OF UNPROFESSIONAL CONDUCT
From its inception the two essential duties of the
Board have been the safeguarding of the qualification
standard for registration, and the suppression of
unqualified practice. To this end the Board has always
worked for improvement in the dental service available
to the people of the State. Although its efforts have
from time to time appeared to have been somewhat unin
spired, there is abundant evidence that any failure is due
to deficiencies in the penal powers of the various Acts
which it has been called upon to administer, rather than
to any lack of initiative on the part of its members.
Faced with Act after Act proving inadequate for
the purpose, unqualified practice and “covering” have
proved very difficult to suppress, and it is only since the
passing of the Consolidated and Amended Act of
1931 that any real progress has been made. Under
this Act the powers of the Board have been markedly
strengthened, and the scope of its summaiy juiisdiction
greatly increased.
With regard to the suppression of unprofessional
conduct, the Board has suffered many vicissitudes, but
in 1927 it succeeded in abolishing the grosser forms of
newspaper advertising, and the use of hoai dings and
showcases. The Board has always maintained, e'\ en
from its earliest days, that its function in this i espect
is absolutely limited to a reflection of the wishes of the


majority of registered dentists. It has at all times been
freely accessible to both the medical and dental societies,
and has been pleased to confer with both on many
matters relating to legislation and regulation of practice.
In the matter of public education, it has often courte-
ously collaborated with the S.A. Branch of the Aus-
tralian Dental Association. It is a matter of interest
that the 8.M.A., S.A. Branch, wrote to the Dental
Board of S.A. in 1923, as follows: —
‘‘That it is unethical for a medical man to administer an anaesthetic
for an unregistered dentist even if a registered dentist is present to
superintend the operation.”
THE MEMBERS AND OFFICERS*
The first and second Dental Boards consisted of six
members, all of whom were appointed by the Governor.
In 1904, however, the number was reduced to five, of
whom the President only was a Government nominee,
with two dentists elected by the Registered Dentists,
and two legally qualified medical practitioners appointed
by the S.A. Branch of the B.M.A. In 1931 the number
of dentists on the Board was raised to three, and the
B.M.A. appointee reduced to one, while the presidential
office was appointed to be held by the Dean of the
Faculty of Dentistry, ex officio.
Under the first Dentists’ Act, the President was
elected by the members of the Board, and Dr. A. E.
Wigg, followed by Dr. Peter Crank, held this office for
short periods. From 1905 Mr. Frank Johnson rendered
indefatigable service as President for 15 years. At his
death in 1921 he was succeeded by Mr. Wallace (later
Sir Wallace) Bruce, who held the office with distinction
until 1931, in which year the Dean of the Faculty of

Dentistry, Dr. A. M. Cudmore, who, by happy chance,
had previously served upon nine Dental Boards,
assumed office, bringing to the Board a wealth of
experience of incalculable value.
THE REGISTRAR
T. C. Walker, Esq., appointed December 13, 1902,
rendered 25 years of splendid service to the Board, He
was succeeded by his associate, Mr. Max Syme, the
present Registrar, who was appointed July 13, 1927.
REGISTRATIONS
At the time of the passing of the first Dentists’ Act,
1902, it was estimated that there were 80 dentists prac-
tising in South Australia. The first Register (190o)
contained the names of 58, while in 1904 there were 110
(77 in the city and 33 in the country). In 1935 there
were 203 on the Register ( 153 and 50 respectively), the
percentage disposition being as follows: —
North Terrace, Adelaide - - 30%
Elsewhere in Adelaide - - 20%
Suburbs (within 12 miles) - 24%
Country (beyond 12 miles) - 23%
Institutions - 2%
Prior to official registration the exact ratio of den-
tists to population is uncertain, but the facts as far as
known reveal that there was not at any time before 1890
more than one dentist to each 7,000 people. 1 his ratio
has gradually increased until the present time, the
periods of special increase being 1915-1920 and 1900-
1935, as summarised below;
1900 - 4,500 people per dentist registered
1910 - 4.100 „
1920 - 3,500 „
1925 - 3,450 „

CHAPTER IV
DENTAL EDUCATION
Part I
EARLY CONDITIONS
During the 19th Century, the recognised means of
acquiring an education in dental surgery was that of
private tuition from a practising dentist, usually by
articles of apprenticeship of from three to six years.
Pupils were articled, in consideration of the payment of
certain premiums, either to learn the whole of dentistry
or, alternatively, to acquire the art of the dental
mechanic.
In “A Study of Early Conditions" (Chapter I,
Part I) is set forth in some measure the environment
in which the dental pupil of those days obtained his
training —the relatively primitive conditions which
served the expectation of the times. The pupil of early
days suffered many hardships, but at least he was spared
the apotheosis of academicity.
There was neither the wealth of "literature" nor
the "aids" to diagnosis that we have today, Ihe eaily
pupil was indeed well trained to diagnose from the
visible signs and symptoms, and was neither assisted
nor misled by reports of radiologists and clinical patho-
logists. He was not aware of his empiricism, and was
often (considering the circumstances) as good a clini-
cian as the graduate of today. Well enough educated in


the humanities, many of the old timers have proved
themselves able to keep abreast of the times even until
the present.
The experience of the pupil naturally varied with
the temperament, learning, social status and technical
ability of his preceptor, and there is perhaps more than
a modicum of truth in the oft-heard statement that the
quality of his education varied according to the amount
of premium, and the social standing of the pupil s
family. That many of these early pupils suffered a
condition of service little short of a mild form of slavery
is undoubtedly true —hours were long, and remunera-
tion, if any, small, while duties often included the
executing of the most menial of household chores.
Nine-tenths of his training was acquired in the
“workroom,” where the technology of the times required
the acquisition of considerable manipulative dexterity.
The dentist of those days was surely a master of his
art. No better words than those of Edmund Kells can
be found to describe the exact situation; —
“Who would find today a prosthetist who would know how to, and
who would take a lot of coins of the realm, alloy, cast and roll his
22K 28 gauge plate, make up suitable solders and draw his round and
triangular wire, then grind up single gum-teeth, solder without a crack,
finish, and have his patient wear the plate?”
There were many who also made beautiful gum sets,
hand carved throughout, and baked in a coke oven —to
the ruination of their eyesight.
The student of today walks up a velvet-carpeted
stairway to success. His predecessor had to throw a
rope over the beam of public needs, and practically pull
himself up by it —yet it is they, perhaps more than any


today, who are the more delighted to know that a
University Course, embodying the knowledge and
experience of all the best practitioners and research
work, is available for the younger generation.
In the S.A. “Register” of 1846 there appears the
following advertisement, inserted by Robert Norman,
Esq.: “A gentlemanly youth, who Would be taken as
pupil for a period of 3or 5 years.' 1 * There were also
some, however, who, from being employed as dental
mechanics, eventually became employed as operative
assistants.
Part II
MODERN DEVELOPMENTS
The Registered Articled Pupil
On and after November 24, 1903, the pupil was
required to serve under registered articles of apprentice-
ship “for a period of four years,” and to pass a
prescribed examination.
Preliminary General Education, 1906 and 1908
The Dental Board-University Course. —On and
after January 1, 1906, no articles of apprenticeship
were registrable until the pupil had passed the Junior
Public Examination of the University of Adelaide in
six required subjects. In addition to this provision,
pupils commencing subsequent to November 1, 1905,
were required to attend lectures at the University, to
pass an examination in the Compulsory Inorganic
Chemistry of the B.Sc., and the Organic Chemistry of
* We regret that we have not been able to discover whether such a pupil was

the M.B. degrees, also in Anatomy, Surgery and Patho-
logy, Materia Medica and Therapeutics and Dental
Surgery. These requirements were in addition to the
dental subjects already scheduled, to which Metallurgy
was also added.
Two years later “the general education" standard
was raised to the Senior Public Examination in five
subjects, which was actually a University matriculation.
Taken with the general scientific, medical and dental
requirements succeeding it, this constituted a course of
study and examination equal to that for which, in
certain other States, a Diploma was granted.*
The introduction of the various advancements in
educational requirements was the work of the Dental
Board by Regulation under the Dentists’ Acts. The
curriculum was so arranged as to bring the studies of
future dentists in South Australia into line with the
requirements of Great Britain.
The Period 1908-1917
During this period, and until the establishment of
the degree course at the University, there were no
alterations in educational requirements prescribed by
the Dental Board. In 1917, however, certain operative
assistants were allowed by Parliament to acquire status,
in order to pass a modified examination for registration,
and also certain persons who had served in the Great
War were granted the privilege of registration upon
passing an extremely modified examination consisting
of a test in practical work only.
* The Diploma status was definitely implied, though neither instituted nor given.
See Minutes of Committee, p. 50, et seq.


Origin of the Degree Course at the University of Adelaide
The move towards a full University degree course
in Dentistry probably found its definite beginning at a
meeting of the Odontological Society of South Aus-
tralia in 1908. It arose from the consideration of a
communication from the State Children’s Department
asking for advice on the care of children’s teeth. At
the Annual Meeting in November, a lengthy discussion
took place on the necessity for the establishment of ‘‘a
dental hospital and training school."
In February, 1911, the Committee resolved to place
upon the agenda for the first meeting of the year the
matter of the formation of a Committee “to inaugurate
a move towards the establishment of a dental hospital."
This subject came up for discussion almost every year
thereafter.
Arising out of a discussion on the need for revision
of the curriculum of the Dental Board-University
Course, this matter was again attacked by the Odonto-
logical Society in 1917, and after conferences between
a committee representing the Odontological Society, the
Dental Graduates’ Society, and the University, plans
for the degree course in dental surgery were completed.
The following copy of the transactions of the first
meeting of the conjoint committee which finally suc-
ceeded in establishing the degree course is of historical
value: —
“Minutes of the first meeting held at the Council Rooms, Adelaide
University, North Terrace, Adelaide, Thursday, October 4, 1917, at
8 p.m.
“Present: Professor Rennie occupied the Chair, and with Dr. A. M.
Cudmore represented the University. Mr. W. G. Coombs (Chairman
of the Adelaide Hospital Board) and Dr. R. S. Rogers (Deputy Chair-


man) represented the Adelaide Hospital. Dr. E. J. Counter, Messrs.
H. Gill Williams, L.D.S., R.C.S. (Eng.), W. A. Harrop, L.D.S.,
R.C.S. (Glas.), and Alex Swann represented the dental profession.
“Professor Rennie, in declaring the meeting open, reviewed the
circumstances under consideration, and suggested, as it necessarily was
a request from the dental profession, it might be as well to consider
the recommendations advanced by that body. In doing so the Chair-
man reminded members that progress with the University along the
lines of securing a degree course had been made some years ago.
“Dr. A. M. Cudmore submitted a progress report of the occasion
of the first attempt to secure a degree at the University, but as the
dental members had already perused the same it was not brought
forward for consideration.
“The Chairman then requested that the dental recommendations be
taken seriatim:—
“Recommendations:
(a) The Adelaide University and the Adelaide Hospital agree
to assist the Dental Profession to secure a Diploma in
Dental Science. (Carried unanimously.)
(b) That the members of the Odontological Society of S.A.
are prepared to give gratuitous clinical service at the pro-
posed Dental School. H. Gill Williams explained that the
demonstrators would be honorary officers.
(Carried unanimously.)
(c) That the proposed Dental School shall be under the control
and direction of the Adelaide University, and that a degree
in dental science be granted. (Carried unanimously.)
“Sub-section (1) of Recommendation (c); ‘That provision shall be
made for students who are registering under present conditions to
complete the curriculum for the said degree.’
“Professor Rennie desired to define the difference between ‘diploma’
and ‘degree.’ It was a degree in dental science that was requested.
These students had matriculated, and it was a matter of permitting
them facilities to secure the said degree by extending to them the
opportunity for contesting the increased subject matter for such
degree. (Agreed.)
[The word “diploma” was really in this instance a mistake in
the phraseology of the sub-section.]
“Sub-section (2) of Recommendatoin (c): ‘That past students who
have completed and registered under Section (e) of the Dental Board
Regulations shall have provision made so as to enable them to complete
the curriculum for the said diploma.’ Considerable discussion took place
upon this matter, and it was agreed that a diploma be granted to such
dental pupils and apprentices so favoured under Sub-section (e), Sec-
tion 19, and credit be given for the subject matter already secured with
the privilege of sitting for the increased subject matter to entitle him to
such diploma. These pupils or apprentices under Sub-section (e) had


' ' ■ ■

not matriculated, and consequently could not enter for the degree in
Dental Science. (Carried.)
“Sub-section (3) of Recommendation (c): ‘That a Practitioner’s
Course he established.’ This sub-section created a lengthy discussion.”
In 1919, under the wing of the Faculty of Medicine,
the course for the degree of Bachelor of Dental Surgery
was started. The first students were several pupils who
had obtained registration under the provisions of Sub-
section (e) of the Dental Board Regulations.
The Faculty of Dentistry, 1921
Regulations were finally passed by the University
Council in April, 1920, and an independent Faculty of
Dentistry was established in 1921, with Sir Joseph
Verco as the first Dean. With the establishment of a
full degree course, the matter of providing means for
practical instruction to take the place of the apprentice-
ship system had to be considered. The first dental
school, in which practical instruction was given, was
situated in a portion of the Old Exhibition Building on
the east side of Frome Road, where for a number of
years the Military Dental Department had been
established.
Establishment of a Training School
At this time Sir Joseph Verco, with remarkable fore-
thought and foresight, persuaded the Australian Branch
of the British Red Cross Society to allot £15,000 of its
surplus funds, which were then being distributed
amongst certain hospital activities, for the building of
a Dental Hospital in Adelaide. The South Australian
Government then decided to subsidise this amount with
another £IO,OOO. Thus the present Dental Hospital,
facing Frome Road, was built and opened for work in


July, 1923. It was the outcome of much labour by a
committee consisting of Sir Joseph Verco, Drs. A. G.
Trott and E, J. Counter, and Messrs. H. Gill Williams
and Alex Swann. The ultimate establishment of this
institution is a monument to the energy of Sir Joseph
Verco, and the interest and help of the committee which
worked under him.
Dental education and educational standards, so far
as the University is concerned, progressed and improved
under the able guidance of Sir Joseph Verco, the curri-
culum continually undergoing revision, and new lecture-
ships being created as required.
D.D.Sc. Degree
When the B.D.S. Course was well established, the
University, in order to stimulate post-graduate study
and research, made provision for the degree of Doctor
of Dental Science. The first admissions to this degree
took place in 1923.
B.D.S. Course increased to Five Years
In 1927, with a view to bringing the University
dental course into line with the requirements of the
General Medical Council of Great Britain, it was aeain
revised and strengthened. The revision of the course
also resulted in its lengthening, so that in 1930 it became
a full five-year course, thus providing more practical
experience and a more comprehensive preliminary scien-
tific education.
In 1928, owing to failing health, Sir Joseph Verco
was compelled to relinquish the post of Dean. His was
succeeded by Dr. A. M. Cudmore, for many years


associated with the Dental Board of S.A., and with the
Medical Course at the University, and who indeed had
actually been a lecturer and demonstrator to the first
dental students taking the University-Dental Board
Course as far back as 1905.
Upon retirement, Sir Joseph Verco gave an endow-
ment fund of £2OO for the purchase of books for the
Dental School Library, and, as was learnt subsequently,
made the School a beneficiary in his will.
The S.A. Branch of the A.D.A. has for some years
shown a practical interest in the University Dental
School. Amongst other things it provided the epidia-
scope for use at the Dental School, and gives an annual
prize for the final year's examination of the B.D.S.
Course.

CHAPTER V
PUBLIC DENTAL SERVICES
Part I
THE EDUCATION DEPARTMENT
Origin of the Service
The South Australian State School Dental Service
owes its origin in equal measure to the example given
by other States, and to the splendid public spirit of
several of Adelaide’s leading practitioners. For many
years individual dentists had rendered praiseworthy
service as honorary dental officers to local charitable
institutions, and the benefit of such service was clearly
recognised. The great European War of 1914-18
revealed the lamentable dental condition of the people,
and emphasised the urgent need for organised public
service.
Early in 1920 a special sub-committee of the S.A.
Branch of the British Science Guild issued a report on
the care of the State School children’s teeth, and on
May 20, 1920, the Minister of Education (Hon. G.
Ritchie) received a deputation which urged the estab-
lishment of school dental clinics. The speakers were: —
Prof. T. Brailsford Robertson Representing the University
Dr. F. S. Hone and Medical Profession
Mr. H. Gill Williams Representing the Dental
Mr. A. Swann Profession
Mr. W. A. Magarey Representing the School for
Miss Dorothy Gilbert Mothers


At this time South Australia and Victoria were the
only States having no school dental clinics. Mr. A.
Swann advocated the Queensland system, and Mr. Gill
Williams specially urged the necessity for the inclusion
of children from four years of age.
Reports were quoted from the School Medical
Officer (Dr. Gertrude Halley), which showed that 77%
of the children exhibited gross dental defects, and also
from the State Children’s Department (Mr. Roy L.
Sims), which revealed that 95% required dental treat-
ment.
The Minister gave a favourable reply to the deputa-
tion, and in November, 1920, Cabinet approved of one
dentist being appointed “for one year as an experiment,”
but it was not until March, 1922, that approval of the
first appointment was passed.
The Director of Education (W. T. McCoy, Esq.,
8.A.), recognising the importance of dental service, was
instrumental in introducing a system of departmental
bursaries for the training of dentists in the University
B.D.S. course. By this means it was designed to ensure
a continuous supply of highly qualified officers for this
department’s work.
1 hus was established a public service which it was
confidently hoped would develop into a valuable health
asset to the State. History shows that its first promise
was rudely checked by the years of economic depression.
From five departmental dentists by 1928, the staff
dwindled to none at all in 1932, while at present (1936)
there are only two departmental officers engaged.


Extracts from Annual Reports
1922 The Dental Services were inaugurated with a Travelling Dental
Clinic. Services were concentrated on small country schools
where private service was practically unavailable.
1923 102 out of 1,000 State Schools received attention. Dr. Halley
pointed out that the school dentists’ work was largely educational,
and that many instructional talks and demonstrations were given.
The dental officer also pointed out that his main object was to
ensure the interest of the children in the importance of dental
health to their general welfare. The futility of treatment alone
was stressed, as it was estimated to take ten years to make one
circuit of the 90,000 children in the State Schools.
The following statistics were issued. They are the first reliable
figures compiled by a qualified dentist in this connection.
Number of children examined - - 3,000
Average of five decayed teeth - - 94%
Marked malocclusion - 40%
Putrescent teeth (6 to 7-year group) - 60%
Sound teeth (8-year group) - - 66% per child
No evidence of attrition (8-year group) 40% of the children
1925 Establishment of the Metropolitan Dental Clinic at Molton
Street. Until this time metropolitan children had been examined
only. Parents were notified of defective teeth, but no treatment
had been undertaken. The same had applied to the larger country
towns.
1926 Treatment in the city was confined to children under ten years
of age, but in the country, children of all ages were attended to.
Addresses were given to the Mothers’ Clubs in the metropolitan
schools by the senior dental officer.
1927 There were four dentists engaged this year. Dr. Halley visited
New Zealand and, upon return, strongly recommended the system
of trained dental nurses in vogue in the Dominion. This was
opposed by the profession generally in Adelaide for the following
reasons. It was contended that the system tends to become
socialized, and is often exploited politically; that the nurses obtain
a false status in the community, and are liable, later on, to claim
rights of registration, and that the scientific background of their
training is grossly deficient; that the parents, for the greater part,
only appreciate the economic advantage of the system, and
not' the real health value of dental care; that the system dis-
regards all pre-school treatment.
1928 There were five dentists engaged, being the greatest number at
one time. During this year the City Dental Clinic was trans-
ferred from Molton Street to the Dental Hospital, Frome Road.
From the Principal Medical Officer’s report we read: “It is
impossible with such a small staff to deal adequately with the
question of dental care of children in State Schools.”


The Personnel
The following is a list of the dental officers engaged
from time to time: —
Moore, A. P. R., B.D.S. - - 3/4/1922 to 31/12/1923
George, F. R., B.D.S. - - 22/2/1924 „ 30/9/1924
Maddern, C. 8., B.D.S. - - 18/2/1925 ~ 6/2/1926
Monfries. J. W. E., B.D.S. - 23/2/1925 „ 10/7/1925
Cocks, A. D., B.D.S. - - - 24/2/1925 „ 18/1/1926
Grosvenor, C., B.D.S. - - 25/1/1926 „ 25/8/1928
Bolt, A. E. - - - - 16/2/1926 „ 15/10/1928
Corbett, B. M., B.D.Sc., L.D.S. 1/3/1926 „ 10/6/1927
Burns, J. C., B.D.S. - 1/2/1927 „ 13/4/1928
Cox, Miss I. E., B.D.Sc. - - 1/2/1928 „ 2/3/1929
Lipson, F. B. - - - - 1/10/1928 „ 15/1/1932
Chapman. E. S. B.D.S. - - 15/7/1929 „ 28/6/1930
Lewis, Miss G. E., B.D.S. - - 1/2/1933
Packer, Miss M., B.D.S. - - 31/1/1934
The monotony of the limited field of work obviously
resulted in many resignations and a constantly changing
personnel. In the 14 years there have been 14 dentists
in the department.
Treatment
As the Principal Medical Officer pointed out in 1928,
the actual amount of dental treatment given has been
totally inadequate to be of any real value in the educa-
tion of the child or, through it, of the improved general
health of the community. During the whole period of
operation of the service, 1922-1936, the average yearly
treatment accomplished is as follows: —
Fillings - 3,000
Extractions - 3.000
Treatments - - 1,450
Children completed - 1,450
Of recent years the Junior Red Cross Circles and
the Dental Board, in collaboration, have carried out
most commendable work amongst the schools and school
clubs by means of films and lectures and demonstrations.
In this work the Dental Profession is pleased to
acknowledge the invaluable assistance rendered by


Mrs. P. E. Stow, M.8.E., Organising Secretary of
Junior Red Cross, and W. J. Adey, Esq., C.M.G., Direc-
tor of Education.

Prior to the establishment of the present Dental
Hospital at Frome Road, the dental treatment afforded
by the Adelaide Hospital consisted solely of the extrac-
tion of teeth, this work being- carried out by an honorary
dentist who visited the institution each week.
In the “South Australian Register,” April 1, 1859,
there appears the following announcement: “Messrs.
Phillips & Gurner, Surgeon Dentists by appointment to
the Adelaide Hospital, North Terrace.” This is pro-
bably the first instance of institutional dental service in
South Australia.
The Adelaide Hospital official records disclose the
following appointments from 1878 to 1920: —
1878-1880 - H. B. Rodway, Esq., L.D.S., R.C.S.
1881-1888 - J. R. Gurner, Esq., L.D.S., R.C.S.
1889-1891 - G. W. Trott, Esq.. L.D.S., R.C.S.
1892-1895 - Herbert Davies, Esq., L.D.S., R.C.S.
1896-1900 - Peter Crank, Esq., L.D.S., R.C.S.
1901-1905 - G. W. Trott, Esq., L.D.S., R.C.S.
1906-1920 - Alex White, Esq.
With the inauguration of a degree course in den-
tistry at the Adelaide University, it became necessary
to establish a school for the training of undergraduate
students, and it was primarily in order to found this
school that the establishment of the Dental Hospital was
brought about, or as it is officially known, 1 he Dental
Department of the Adelaide Hospital.

A brief historical outline of the establishment of
this hospital is given in the section dealing with Dental
Education (p. 53). The new building was officially
opened in July, 1923. The first Dental Superintendent
being Dr. A. I. Chapman; the first Dental House
Surgeon, Dr. T. D. Campbell (the present Superin-
tendent) ; and the first appointees to the Honorary
Dental Staff were Drs. W. Theo. Shanasy, L. W. Trott,
P. Ray Newling, E. J. Millhouse, and Mr. F. M. Swan.
The first representative of the Faculty of Dentistry
upon the Advisory Committee of the Adelaide Hospital
was Sir Joseph Verco. He was succeeded by H. Gill
Williams, Escp, in 1928. Upon the resignation of the
last named gentleman in 1935, Dr. A. M. Cudmore was
appointed.
The Dental Hospital provides treatment for the
indigent public as out-patients, and also for indoor
patients of the general hospital, and for children and
other persons coming under the control of various
Government and charitable institutions, such as the
State Children’s Department, the Aboriginals’ Depart-
ment, the Old Folks’ Home, the Mental Hospital, etc.
It also undertakes the treatment of the Education
Department children in the metropolitan area.
The work of the Department, both in its teaching-
activities and in treatment of patients, has expanded
and progressed throughout the years following its
establishment, as is clearly indicated in the following-
table :


Part 111
GOVERNMENT DENTAL SERVICES
The institution of dental treatment as a Govern-
ment Service took place following several conferences
between the Government and the Odontological Society
of S.A. in 1908. The appointment of a Government
dentist to the State Children’s Department was made
on May 1, 1909. This was followed by the appointment
of a dentist to the Yatala Labour Prison in 1911, and
upon his resignation in 1917, that institution, together
with the Adelaide Gaol and the Mental Hospital, were
all placed under the care of the State Children’s Depart-
ment dentist. The whole service was transferred to
the Inspector-General of Hospitals Department in 1920.
The Government maintained surgeries in Flinders
Street from 1909 to 1926, when the Government dentist
was transferred to the Dental Hospital, Frome Road.
Since that date this officer has also held the position of
Senior Dental Surgeon and Demonstrator in the Dental
Department at the Adelaide Hospital.
Scope of Treatment rendered by the Government Dentist
Complete dental service is rendered to the Children’s
Welfare Department (formerly the State Children’s
Department). Extractions and prophylaxis are under-
taken for the Mental Hospitals, and dental prosthesis
in suitable cases. Certain patients are allowed to attend
their private dentists for conservative treatment. For
short sentence prisoners, extractions and relief of pain
are effected, while long sentence prisoners receive com-
plete dental service while detained in His Majesty's
prisons.


Other institutions, such as the T.B. Sanatoria and
Cancer Hospital, are visited for relief of pain and
extractions as required, and where suitable, patients are
referred to the Dental Hospital or to private dentists.

INDUSTRIAL CLINICS
“Lodge” or “Panel” Dentistry is virtually unknown
in South Australia. The only industrial clinic in the
State is the Broken Hill Associated Smelters Co-opera-
tive Council Dental Clinic at Port Pirie. The building
and equipment, provided by the Company, was opened
in March, 1926. The clinic has 1,100 members, whose
subscriptions are subsidised pound for pound by the
Company, and also provides treatment for members’
wives, children and other dependents. It employs one
dental surgeon and other necessary staff.


PART VI
THE DEFENCE DEPARTMENT
1. Dental Services in South Australia
Before the Great War (1914-1918), the Defence
Department made no provision for dental services as
part of the A.A.M.C. Permanent officers and other
ranks of the C.M.F. were provided for by contract with
private practitioners. A.LF. recruits, before 1915, were
examined for dental fitness by the M.0., and no dental
treatment was available officially in A.LF. training
camps. In 1915 one dentist, 5.D.0., 4th Military Dis-
trict, with rank of Hon. Captain, and six others with
rank of Hon. Lieutenant, were appointed as a war
measure. To the S.D.O. fell the duty of organising and
controlling the first defence dental services in S.A., and
the first service rendered by this Corps was that of
examining applicants for enlistment.
Subsequently, Dental Units, equipped for complete
treatment, were established in all A.LF. Camps. At
this time the rank of the S.D.O. was raised to Hon.
Major, and the O.C. of the Unit to Hon. Captain. Three
Units operated continuously, namely, Mitcham Camp,
the Base Hospital at Keswick, and the Exhibition Camp,
the latter attending to all soldiers repatriated, or on
leave, or re-enlisted. The Red Cross Society and the
State War Council rendered financial assistance for
dental treatment to many soldiers and their dependents
in cases where official services were not available, and
the existing dental societies encouraged their members
to undertake this patriotic service.

Driscoll, H. T. J. Edwards, J. L. Eustace, H. V. Frayne, J. W. Hos-
king, W. A. Harrop, F. J. Miles, P. R. Newling, A. S. Randell, R. L.
Sims, A. Swann, F. M. Swan, B. Thomson, A. G. Trott, E. A. Wagner,
C. Webb, A. L. White, H. Gill Williams.
2. Dental Services in the A.I.F. Abroad
It was early recognised, in the war area, that oral
and dental conditions constituted a most important
factor in the health of the fighting forces. Men evacu-
ated in large numbers on this account, often did not
return or returned without treatment, as no dental treat-
men was available at the base. By the end of 1915, from
the Ist Australian Division alone, 600 cases had been
evacuated from this cause.
In July, 1915, Military Order 387 authorised the
appointment of dental surgeons to commissioned, and
dental mechanics to non-commissioned rank, in the
A.1.F., and with the arrival in Egypt, in August of that
year, of six dental officers, the nucleus of the Dental


Corps was formed. Up to this time the only dental
treatment available to soldiers in the field was given by
dental surgeons who had enlisted, perforce as combat-
ants or medical orderlies, and who, without recognition
as to rank and corps status, had been transferred, as a
matter of urgent expediency, to the A.A.M.C.
The inauguration of the Dental Service as a regular
and integral part of the A.A.M.C. proved itself to he a
source of strength and mutual benefit to the service.
Whereas in 1915 there were only 12 dental officers, by
April, 1916. 36 Dental Units were at work.
In the early part of 1916, upon the departure of the
Anzac Corps from Egypt to the seat of operations in
France, an innovation was made, by the attachment of a
dental section to each Field Ambulance —perhaps the
most useful contribution made by Australia to medical
organisation.
Members of the dental profession in South Aus-
tralia who saw service overseas as officers commanding
Dental Units with the Australian Imperial Force were:
Capt. W. R. Bailey
Capt. F. M. Bradshaw
Capt. V. Campbell
Major L. B. Day

CHAPTER VI
SOCIETIES AND ASSOCIATIONS
In a review of associational activity it is impossible
to mention by name all those who have contributed to
the general advancement of the dental profession in
South Australia. It has been said that no man, however
able, can truly be regarded as an ornament to his pro-
fession who elects to stand aloof, and who at no time
becomes an active supporter of his Association.
Although a few can hold executive office, all honour is
due to the many who have assisted in the realization of
the reforms which have characterised the remarkable
progress of the last thirty years.
Legislative enactments and higher standards of
education represent but the dry bones of history; it is
in the record of associational activity alone that we are
able to read the romantic story of professional aspira-
tion and endeavour. Prior to the issue of the first
Dental Register in 1903 there is no record of any official
organisation of practising dentists, and it is not until
1907 that we discern the first real attempt to promote
closer union and fellowship.*
* In 1901, an Association of Professionally Qualified Dentists was formed, with
the object of securing legislation to regulate the practice of dentistry. Its members
were H. Gill Williams, L.D.S., R.C.S., Eng.; P. Crank, L.D.S., R.C.S., Eng.,
D.M.D., Harv.; W H. Harrison, L.D.S., Edin. ; G. W. Trott, L.D.S., R.C.S., Eng. ;
F. T Trott, L.D.S., R.C.S., Eng.; H. H. Norman, D.D.S.; A. J. Bennett, D.D.S.
Mr. H. Gill Williams was the prime mover and Hon. Secretary.


THE BIRTH OF THE FIRST DENTAL SOCIETY
At a dinner held on November 8, 1907, at the York
Hotel, which stood at the corner of Pulteney and Rundle
Streets, thirteen South Australian dentists, at the sug-
gestion of Dr. Theo. Shanasy, met to honour two
distinguished dentists from New South Wales, namely,
Dr. Alfred Burne, a member of the Dental Board of
N.S.W., and Mr. S. Chaim, Vice-president of the Odon-
tological Society of N.S.W.
Dr, Shanasy presided, and earnestly appealed to
those present to make this but the first of many gather-
ings. The visitors, in happy speeches, strongly urged
the formation of a dental society in South Australia.
Dr. E. J. Counter delivered a forceful address on “The
necessity of an Odontological Society for South Aus-
tralia,’’ at the close of which he proposed the formation
of the same. The motion was seconded by Mr. Victor
Cohen, and was strongly supported by Dr. Theo.
Shanasy, Dr. Peter Crank, Mr. W. E. Grosvenor, Mr.
Harold Crosland, and Mr. Ben Thomson.
The resolution was carried unanimously by those
present, namely:—
Dr. Peter Crank
Dr. E. J. Counter
Dr. A. S. Randell
Dr. Theo. Shanasy
Mr. Harold Crosland
Mr. Victor Cohen
Mr. W. E. Grosvenor
Mr. J. Hosking
Mr. J. Harris
Mr. F. J. Miles
Mr. Alex Swann
Mr. Ben Thomson
Mr. Chas. Webb
Of those present at this historic gathering, only
eight remain with us today. Messrs. Crosland, Harris,
Shanasy, Cohen and Crank have passed to the Great
Beyond.


INAUGURATION OF THE ODONTOLOGICAL
SOCIETY OF S.A.
The inaugural meeting was held at the York Hotel,
Adelaide, November 22, 1907. Those present were: —
Dr. E. J. Counter
Dr. A. S. Randell
Mr. H. Gill Williams
Air. Charles Webb
Air. W. E. Grosvenor
Mr. Alex Swann
Mr. Harold Crosland
Mr. J. W. Hosking
Dr. Theo. Shanasy
Mr. F. J. Miles
■The following officers were elected: —
President - Dr. E. J. Counter
Vice-President - - - Mr. H. Gill Williams
Hon. Treasurer - - - Dr. A. S. Randell
Hon. Secretary - Mr. Harold Crosland
Committee - Dr. Theo. Shanasy
Mr. Ben Thomson
Mr. Chas. Webb
The tenure of office was for one year, and the annual
subscription was fixed at one guinea, and the meeting
paid due honour to Dr. Theo. Shanasy for his energetic
efforts in the realization of the Society.
Mr. H. Gill Williams delivered the first address,
entitled “Dental Ethics,” to the new Society on
April 28, 1908, At this meeting Mr. Alex Swann was
appointed Minute Secretary, and Mr. William Siebert
was admitted to membership.
The first meeting was held at the Board Room of
the Dental Board in Currie Street, and subsequently,
for a considerable period, in an upstairs room in King
William Street, near Sands & McDougalls. Dinners
and entertainments were generally held at Jackman’s
New Grand Cafe nearby. The first Annual Dinner was
held at the York Hotel, November 27, 1908. Dr. Alfred
Burne and Mr. S. Chaim were made Hon. Members
during the year, and the Society adopted a strict code
of ethics for its members.


In its first year the Society successfully contended
with the Factories and the Medical Acts, both of which
contained clauses unfavourable to the best interests of
the profession. It considered the appointment of a lec-
turer for the School for Mothers, advocated the estab-
lishment of a dental hospital, fought for exemption
from jury duty, considered the provision of dental
service for the State Children’s Department, and strenu-
ously advocated dental, as well as medical, examination
of State School children. The Society also generously
responded to an appeal for forceps for the use of nurses
in the outback country.
This is a fine record of achievement, and it set a high
example of active associational work in the interests
both of the profession and of the public. For fifteen
years this original society zealously guarded the rights
and privileges, and actively promoted the scientific,
social and legislative progress of the dental profession.
It took part in the formation of the National Dental
Association of Australia, and encouraged the earlier
Congresses by large and representative delegations.
Many distinguished members of the allied professions
contributed to the success of its meetings, and particular
mention is due to Dr. Win. Ramsay Smith, D.Sc., M.D.,
C.M., F.R.S.E., upon whom the Society conferred
Honorary Membership in 1921.
THE DENTAL GRADUATES’ SOCIETY OF S.A.
This Society was founded in 1912 with Mr. H. Gill
Williams, L.D.S. R.C.S. (Eng.), as its first President.
It did much towards the increase of scientific knowledge
and the formation of a higher ethical status within the


profession. The Society actively assisted the Odonto-
logical Society in all its activities relating to public
health, dentistry in State Schools and the State Child-
ren’s Department, and amending legislation. It was a
financial member of the National Dental Association of
Australia, in the forming of which its first President
did outstanding work.
Regarding the introduction of X-rays to dental prac-
tice in South Australia, it is on record that at a conjoint
meeting with the Odontological Society in May, 1914,
Dr. Arthur Chapman, then Hon. Secretary of the
Dental Graduates’ Society, gave a practical demonstra-
tion. He took intra-oral radiographs of the living-
subject, which were immediately developed and shown
to the meeting. The Society functioned until 1922,
when an amalgamation was affected with the Odonto-
logical Society.
THE REGISTERED DENTISTS’ ASSOCIATION
OF S.A.
An Association of registered dentists, to which
graduates and non-graduates belonged—both ethical
and non-ethical from the point of view of advertising —
was formed in 1916. A copy of the Rules passed on
June 6 of that year is signed by W. A. Harrop, L.D.S.
(Glas.), as President, and A. R. Creswick as Hon.
Secretary. This Society did much useful work, and
amalgamated with the State Dental Society in 1927. In
this way was brought to fruition the long cherished
hope of a united body of dentists in South Australia.*
* The above records of the Dental Graduates’ Society, and the Registered Dentists’
Association, are necessarily brief, owing to the Minute Books not being available.


THE STATE DENTAL SOCIETY OF S.A.
By mutual desire, the Odontological Society of
South Australia and the Dental Graduates’ Society of
South Australia amalgamated on June 6, 1922. The
united body took the name of The State Dental Society
of S.A., with thirty foundation members. This new
Society adopted the constitution of the Odontological
Society, and became the sole accredited S.A. member of
the National Dental Association of Australia. Its first
President was Mr. Alex Swann, and the Hon. Secretary,
Mr. R. L. Sims, both of whom had rendered invaluable
service for the parent Society, working hard for the
creation of one ethical body in the State. The Library
and Museum of the Odontological Society were trans-
ferred to the State Dental Society. Meetings were held
on North Terrace, at the rooms of various members.
In 1923 the State Dental Society entered into
negotiations with the Registered Dentists’ Association
on the subjects of public health education and the
abolition of advertising. These questions originated
with the last-named body, and marked the first stirrings
of a desire to bring the whole profession into unity on
the basis of ethical practice. Negotiations were con-
tinued in 1924, and as a result, advertising, except for a
name card in the newspapers, was abolished by mutual
agreement in 1927.
In 1922 the profession suffered a definite loss by the
death of Dr. Theo. Shanasy, who had been made
honorary member upon his retirement from practice
two years before, and who had done so much to promote
associational work in this State. In 1924 the Associa-


tion Library and Museum, which had been under the
care of Mr. F. J. Miles since 1908, were transferred to
the newly-formed Dental Hospital. In the following-
year the Association held its first meeting at the Dental
Hospital by agreement with the Adelaide Hospital
authorities, and this venue has been its regular meeting-
place ever since. Members have the right to use the
Library, and the Association has from time to time
materially assisted in its upkeep by monetary gifts and
supplies of books and periodicals.
The year 1925 saw two innovations of importance.
The first was a conjoint meeting with the S.A. Branch
of the 8.M.A., and the second the holding of a local
congress on November 26, at which addresses and
clinics were given by two distinguished Victorian den-
tists, namely, Drs. W. J. Tuckfield and R. J. B. Yule.
The vital questions of Dental Nurses (Hygienists),
the abolition of advertising, and Society amalgamation
marked the chief work accomplished in 1926.
THE SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DENTAL ASSOCIATION
An amalgamation was effected on March 24, 1927,
between the State Dental Society of S.A. and the Dental
Association of S.A., under the name of the S.A. Dental
Association, with 111 foundation members. The first
President was Mr. Alex Swann, and the Hon. Secretary
Air. H. J. Lipman. Thus in two amalgamations Mr.
Swann holds the distinction of being the first President
of a newly created body, a fitting tribute to his inde-
fatigable zeal in bringing together the whole profession
in one united Association.


Lack of space prevents the mention of numerous
other members who, throughout the years, directly, and
indirectly, bent their efforts to this great object. To
none, however, could be attached more honour than to
the name of Sir Joseph Verco, Kt, first Dean of the
Faculty of Dentistry. It would be indeed difficult to
pay adequate tribute to the memory of this great and
modest knight who continually encouraged the unifica-
tion of dental endeavour.
THE AUSTRALIAN DENTAL ASSOCIATION
(S.A. BRANCH)
The Federal Council of the National Dental Asso-
ciation which met during the Fifth Australian Dental
Congress in Sydney in 1924 decided to re-organise that
body. A movement was initiated which culminated in
a meeting at Canberra on June 28, 1928, at which the
constitution, supported by the S.A. Dental Association,
was adopted. This gave birth to the present Australian
Dental Association with State Branches. Upon ratifi-
cation, the S.A. Dental Association, on August 23, 1928,
became the Australian Dental Association (S.A.
Branch).
In 1933, in recognition of his service to the profes-
sion in almost every executive office throughout a
quarter of a century, the Association conferred upon
Mr. Alex Swann the signal honour of Life Membership.
The special features of the Association’s programme
in 1936 were the initiation of the publication of the
present “Dental History” and the holding of the second
local Convention (the first was in 1925). At this
gathering the Association was privileged to have two


distinguished visitors from Victoria, namely, Professor
Arthur Amies, D.D.Sc., D.L.O. (Melb.), L.D.S. (Vic.),
L.R.C.P., L.R.C.S. (Edin.), F.R.A.C.S. (L.0.), Dean
of the Faculty of Dental Science, University of Mel-
bourne, and also Dr. J. Monahan Fewis, M.A.C.D.,
D.D.Sc., both of whom gave addresses and clinics of
high order. This “Centenary” Convention, held on
October 8, 9 and 10, included sports and the Annual
Dinner. Both academically and socially, it is generally
acclaimed to he a “red letter day” in the history of the
Society.
AUSTRALIAN DENTAL CONGRESSES
The Fourth Australian Dental Congress
At a general meeting of the members of the Third
Australian Dental Congress, held at Brisbane,, Queens-
land, in July, 1912, it was decided that Adelaide should
be the next triennial meeting place. Dr. E. J. Counter
was chosen as President-elect, and August, 1915, fixed
as the date.
Arrangements were well in hand, and strong com-
mittees working in all the States, when the Great War
intervened.
Owing to this regrettable contretemps, the executive
business of the National Dental Association was carried
on for nine years with headquarters in Adelaide, under
the able management of Dr. Counter as President, and
Dr. Shanasy and Mr. Alex Swann as Treasurer and
Hon. Secretary, respectively.
At the conclusion of the War, Congress executives
were re-assembled, and the Fourth Australian Dental




Congress eventually took place in Adelaide, from
August 22 to 29, 1921. There was a large represen-
tation from all the States, the South Australian
membership being 42, and the total membership 200.
The Congress was held at the S.A. School of Mines
and Industries, by courtesy of Sir Langdon Bonython
and Council. It was officially opened in the Brookman
Hall by His Excellency the Governor of South Aus-
tralia (Sir W. E. G. Archibald Weigall, K.C.M.G.).
The Lord Mayor, Frank Moulden, Esq. (afterwards
Sir Frank), and the Lady Mayoress (Lady Hackett)
tendered a civic reception to Interstate delegates on
August 22, and His Excellency and Lady Weigall gave
a reception to members and their wives at Government
House on the 25th.
The management of Congress was in the hands of
the following Executive Committee: —
Dr. E. J. Counter (President)
Dr. W. Theo. Shanasy
F. M. Swan, L.D.S. (Vic.)
E. J. Millhouse, L.D.S. (Edin.),
D.D.S.
Richard Godson, D.D.S.
Miss Beatrix Bennett
L. W. Trott, D.D.S.
Arthur Chapman, D.D.S.
Roy L. Sims
H. C. D. Taunton, D.D.S.
Fred J. Miles
F. A. Clarke
Arthur Cask, L.D.S. (Eng.)
E. A. Wagner (Hon. Treas.)
A. G. Trott, L.D.S. (Eng.),
D.D.S. (Assist. Hon. Sec.)
Alexander Swann (Hon. Sec.
and Vice-President)
The Eighth Australian Dental Congress
At the Seventh Australian Dental Congress at
Brisbane in 1930 it was decided to hold the next Con-
gress at Adelaide in 1933, and Dr. H. T. J. Edwards
was elected Federal President of the A.D.A., and
President-elect of Congress.


Shortly afterwards a strong executive committee
was appointed as follows: —
H. T. J. Edwards, D.D.Sc.
(President)
Alex Swann (Vice-President)
H. J. Lipman (Hon. Treas.

Congress was held from August 21 to 26, 1933, and
again we are deeply indebted to the President of the
School of Mines (Sir Langdon Bonython) and Council
for granting the use of that building, and to the Univer-
sity for the use of the magnificent Rennie Lecture
Theatre.
The Congress was opened at the Freemasons’ Hall,
North Terrace, by His Excellency the Governor of
South Australia (Brigadier-General Sir Alexander
Gore Arkwright Hore-Ruthven, V.C., K.C.M.G., C.8.,
D.5.0.).
Distinguishing features of the Congress were:
Firstly, the introduction of a section which had not
figured previously at Australian Congresses, namely,
Dental Economics; and secondly, “The Report of the
Proceedings,” edited by Dr. Arthur Chapman, in a
volume of 535 pages and 250 illustrations, which, by
being published before the end of the year, greatly
enhanced its scientific value. At this Congress strong-
feeling was evinced that future Congresses should be
a Federal responsibility, which has now become effective
under the new Constitution of the A.D.A.
