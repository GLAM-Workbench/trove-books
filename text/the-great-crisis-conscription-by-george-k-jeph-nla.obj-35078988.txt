The Great Crisis.
(By GEORGE K. JEPHCOTT.)
Lad] o3 and .gentlemen,?
I believe you will all easily agree
that tne. first minis amongst us
could not bring more to the study
of this matter than its importance
and urgency demand; and such
minds would need to be stored with
a large amount of first-class know-
ledge, and would need to be truly
and fully in earnest in the applica-
tion of that knowledge to arrive at
anything line a full and accurate
realisation of this great crisis in
wuich so much is involved. I do
not claim, ladies and gentlemen, to
have either this mind, or knowledge
bfufti I claim to have the earnestness;
which I say wo all should have?
the occasion demands it, and if we
do not have it we are quite
likely to fail in our duty at
the critical moment. And my
b'est thoughts tell me that much
which should have been done?much
chat* the situation demanded ?has
not been don�* There are, I think
three main things that should have
been done. First we should have
had conscription. There is, I be-
lieve, a gool deal of opposition to
the idea of conscription as being
something' un�ritish ; something that
is not in line with true freedom;.
This idea is absolutely and dia-
metrically wrong; for, on the con-
trary, it is quite impossible to have
fairness and certainty (the latter an
absolute requisite in a, time like,
the present) without conscription.
There u also an impression abroad
that the conscript is not so good a
soldier as the volunteer. Expeii-
ence to a very great extent, if
not entirely, disproves this, while,
on the other hand, to kill all your
host men first is about as sensible
as it would be for a banker to get
rid o� all his gold at the start and
dry to carry on then with silver and
?copper. Then, secondly, we should
have had a just, all-embracing
wealth tax; or, rather, levy. This
would have gone far to have re-
moved that feeling of
which, no doubt, is in the minds
of a great many people; it would
have blown away that 'Ttake iir
the country?' bush, behind which:'
pier haps a good many people have
been standing:* It would, in reality *
have removed all inequality between*
citizens, and would be worth more*
much more, than it would cost-
Thirdly, we should, have universal
training. And when I say ?uhi*
vcrsal training? I do pot mean that
all upi to a: certain age should be
gathered together in great concern*
tration camps On tha contrary, even
with the numbeis we have in trains
ing, I quite disbelieve in this racial
ot great concentration camps into
which men go straight from their
homes. I believe that each St a tef
should be divjded into sections, each:
section having its training cam'pj
but the first course of training
should be gone through practically:
at home. Them as wanted? the most
fit of the trainees should be passed
into the district camp-s, and then oH
to the main Campis- By the adop<
tion of tliis feystdm, I say? we should
have much better results in many,
ways- Men training thus in each'
locality would keep, the business*
before the public in a very prac*
tical way all the lime, and it would
naturally and perforce supersede,
sports pf all sorts (except rifle shoqty
ing). And it would be the means?
of imparting many much needed lesr
sons in discipline and organisation
and would be much the more
omical system, as in the first stages
of training the men could for a
good part of the time follow their
ordinary avocations. The change in
their habits of life would not be so*
sudden, and there would not
the crowding together of
of mien, and consequently not the*
great liability to disease?Which isr
a, matter of the first importance iik


Circumstances of this kind. In fact,
look at it in any way you like
land I think you will have to con-
fess that this would be the right
way?first to train men i n their own
locality, and then pass them on into
divisional Camps, and on into main
camp's for the finishing touches- If
any precedent were desired the case
of the Cossacks could be given,
for I under stand that it is on sinu-
lines that they iare trained ?and that
is all that need be said for any
system of training. There is also,
I believe, a good deal of opposition
to this, as being a first step towards
the terror of militarism on one hand
and as being a mere waste on the
other hand. The first objection
chiefly comes, I believe? from the
advanced Socialist cnlt, the other
objection from their opposites?the
Utilitarians. But both are alike
in being utterly wrong. If Social-
ism is ever to be pint into practice,
for good or ill, it will prove itself
to be a: form of national training!
vastly more difficult, intricate and
endless than would be required by
any necessary and useful system of
military training. As for those who
make the opposite objection ?of
waste, ?I would advise them to read
Blatehfordk book ?My Life in the
Army/" ISTo ! There i s no danger
[to a free and enlightened democracy
in the ideal of universal military
training. And against foreign foes
it may be absolutely essential to
adopt a par-reaching scheme of this
feort. Some may cite Germany as
an instance against me. I say this
is not so* Let us look squarely at
and the problems she
steadily, without hys*
tencal, foo kh hate, seeking to learn
{all we can from her; quite deter-
jnined, meanwhile, of course to put
lier down- I am not going to give
yon a learned on Ger-;
many; I arm not in a position to do
!so if I wished!, which I do not ?but
I do know that inward forces and
outward circumstances have cons
spired together to make her the
greatest fighting machine the world
has ever seen;, and those qualified' to
�pjeiak say she b a s great qualities
of "head, heart and hand?? and I
doubt not it is so. Some of their
qualities of head and hand are
shown in their wonderful national
organisation and apparently u n ivera
sal technical skill, which includes
all their military organisation, for
with th f m war is a trade poire and
pimple. But Germany is an auto-
cracy; k dominated by a caste, if
one cannot say by, an individual;
a force quite ,apart from the people
themselves, though it may be that
they are not aware thereof. There
k absolutely no freedom, no lib*
erty ?-ae we understand the words ?
in Germany. It is the most terrible
of all known facts that a great and
highly educated people can be, has
been, trained and forced to do any*
thing and everything by a power
apart from themselves dominating
them. And that power is mank
ffestly and confessedly non-moraj,
with a rapacity, brutality and du-*
rlioity which is boundless. We may
ask, Whence comes this monster?
If we listen to the echoes of history
we shall find that it is not new-born*
If we look at its recent story we
find it in unfortunate Poland, in
martyred Belgium and in Franco ?-
that the German genius has been
living on big favorite diet, raw blood
mixed with sugar-plums, and grown
fat thereon It we examine German
literature we find that he has latdy
had some wor hy teachers?Niet-scbe,
the philosopher, who taught that
Christianity is the greatest mistake
that has ever been foisted on hu*
manity; poor pap, only fit for ene-
mies one washes to destroy. Trett*
ochkei, the historian? who asserts
that the Prussians are the chosen
people, who are to dominate the
world- Bernhardi, the re-introduCeir
of the old gospel of frightfulness
for purposes of utility. Things
being different?lor instance, had
these teachers been English, say?
or French?the solidly educated
German would have considered Nieta
feChe what {he really was, an atavistic
lunatic; Treitschke, an exaggerated
Case of vulgar national spreadeaigio>
ism; Bernhardi, a headmaster for ft
fechool of pjirates. But in Gerpmuy


the times and cirdumstances were
waiting for them ?with the results
that can be seen in Belgium- Yes,
Belgium! What thoughts, what pic-
tures crowd the mind at that word-
Pictures of tragedy and pathos that
no human words can do justice to-
The Belgian flag, I say? could
rightly bo taken uy the brave ant
free as an anxtlem of devotion for
all timei, and that, I venture to
think, is the greatest praise that
could be given. If, ladies and gen-
tlemea, I seek to emphasise this
portion of my address I hope that
I shall he forgiven, when it is re-
inemhered that I do this ?lest we
forget;? lest we fail to realise what
our best friend in this dreadful
crisis has done for us- And that
what sh� has suffered is just what
we shall suffer if we fail to repay
that debt; it we fail to do our duty
and crush Gej many at whatever
pric a . To most ox you at least are
known the general facts- You know
that Belgium i? a, small country,
densely populated by one of the
most industrious and exemplary
peoples in the world- Buildings,
religious ana otherwise, that were
among the greatest monuments of
human art and industry; buildings
linked and intertwined with the
whole material and spiritual life
of the people -- full of the treasures
of art, thejrecords of national genius-
It is also, we understand? one of the
most intensely cultivated of all
countries; full of the most admir-
able homes that could be found any-
where?is, or rather wasl Bor does
not the smoke of their burning as-
cend to heaven and call aloud for
vengeance? And the people, what
of them? This brave, industrious
exemplary people- What of them ?
I say let us draw reverently near
those smoking ruins, and look upon
what the cultured German can do,
and has done, to this devoted people
(whom he has sworn to protect)
Because they refused his vile re-
quest to have free passage through
their country on his expedition to
rob and murder their good neighbor,
France. Let us look. I repeat), and
learn what will be our own fate,
for an absolute certainty, if we fall
to do our duty. We have read in
the newspapers of so many towns
and village.? having been raided and
destroyed, so many inhabitants'
men, women and children, having
been killed. We have read, too?
bow they were killed?of what has
been done by our 'cultured? enemy.
So many homes destroyed- As men
and women we must know what is
the meaning of that word home- We
know whab they h,a ( ve cost us of
toil and struggle- They may be
poor homes ?most of them are in
comparison with those destroyed in
Belgium?but we know .wha't we,
keep! in these homes of onrs- In the
humblest of them are treasures more
precious to us than are the most
priceless art treasures kept in the
great galleries of the world. For
liere are kept our women and chib
dren. Everyone knows what he
would do to protect these treasures.
But if we let the Germans get Fere
we shall bo as helpless as the Bel-;
gians were to protect them Every
man worthy of that name
what the meaning of the word wo-*
manhood is?in mother, lover, or;
wife; and has at least some rover ?*,
ence for the name- In the long,
tragic, pitiful story of humanity? so
far as we know it. who has been
man?s companion, who has inspired
his bravest deeds, his most heroics
devotion, and has suffered infinitely
more ? Woman; In the earlier
plages of the world?s story woman
was thought hut little of, perhaps;
but even among many savages at
least some respect was shown, while!
among the higher types, where else
has man found his chief inspiration?
Has any great pioet ever sung with-;
out her for his chief theme? Writ-!
ers and fighters, artists and heroes
alike, have found their greatest in*
spa rati on, their highest exemplar of
spiritual an 1 material beauty in wch
manhood- It has remained for Ger*
mans to show both at homo and
abroad that their ?culture?
no reverence for womanhood! Snail
Australian mem allow them to come
here ? I say no 1 And all women
should know?most of them do t and


many mm besides ?what is meant
t>y the word child. The soft and
thing; emblem of helpless-
ness- They know its smiles and
booings, its appealing motions and
glances, its laughter and tears- And
the boy grows from babyhood to
youto; the girl 4 o maidenhood?
meadenhood with the innocence of
childhooi and the charm of woman-
hood- Few they are, except the
very worst, the very dregs of hu-i
inanity, who could be brutal to a
bhild, even the chill of an enemy.
But how have the Germans treated
the women and children wherever
their accursed feet have trod?
Mothers, -you know! I say be brave?
glory that your sons go forth to
help in the glorious and sacred task
of protecting the helpless hahes and
?Children of this our Australia- Sis-
;tes, sweethearts., great as the an-
guish and grief may be, all do
your duty, fry our best to induce
nil that can and should go no go.
�o your part?as yon always do
'when rightly called" upon?to help
protect our children by helping to
keep the old flag flying?the British
flag, the far-flung banner on which,
the sun never sets, the emblem of
the brave and free, the flag that
flies over more free people than
hny other flag that has ever flut-
tered in the breezes of this earth.
??The flag that for a thousand years
has braved the tattle and the
freeze ,? flying over more bravo
deeds than any other, whatever it
may he! Shall that flag be torn
flown by the most brutal foe it
has ever met, and be stained not
only in the blood of fighting men,
hut in the gore of helpless women
and children r Flo! Say that it
newer shall?Australia will see to
that. Australia! your mother, Eng-
gland, calls you! And how nobly
that call has been responded to the
testimony ot those who have seen
what Australia has done at Gallipoli
shall bear witness. On the ridges
and crags of Gallipoli, in the gul-
lies and ravines and trenches that
traverse it, on its shores, and on the
waters that wash its shores, has
heen written in blood a story of
heroic devotion that shall never pass
away while the Empire and its his-
tory last. A story that would need
the most gifted orator or poet to
do justice undo. A story that is in
line with the best traditions of our
race. And thaf, I say- is the great-,
tst praise that can be given. Those
who have died there have nobly
answered the spirit-call of their
heroic forefathers. They have en-
tered into their reward?ete r injal
glory?and every citizen of our Com-*
monwoalth, man or woman, worthy
of the name, must feel a great
emotion of pride and gratitude to-
wards them. They have pointed
the way, they-have gone on before
Us, and it is our duty to follow
alter, to complete the task they
have so nobly wrought at We
should- put by all mean and small
things, trying to fully realise what
is indeed our duty. And having
realised, we must do it. no matter at
what cost until we achieve a full
and final victory!
It is only fair to the writer to
add that the above address was
written nearly twelve months ago,
and I think ihai- it can be lairly
Claimed that all which is said
therein has f sen fully justified; of
course much has happened since
then; there are mjany new facts to hie
taken into consideration which create
new view-points. For i n sta;nCe, we
know now that practically the whole
of the German people are fully
imbued with the spirit of hate,
rapine and plunder, and it might he
oaid that I nmkb a. mistake in plaic-s
iiig the blame on the ruling clacs,
hut it is not so?all who arei well-
informed aidmit that the mass of
the people have been educated up
to what they are, anr! are also dbmG
nated absolutely by that ruling
class. They (the " well-informed)
know that there is something in the
German mind which lends itself to
that sort of thing, and that therein
lies the great world-danger. There
seems to be something in the Ger-
manic spirit assimilated to the worst
phase' of the Asiatic temperament
in its docility and acceptanb� of


domination, its ductibility? its tcch-
jniCal skill and laborious application,
as also in its duplicity and callous
brutality; and therein, as I have
said, lies the world?s great danger.
For such a spirit, when backed up
by physical power (which it is al-
ways tending to create), must ah
ways he the, vital danger to all
the democratic nations. In the In ah
ter of the soldiers? camps, as we
know to our cost after fully de-
veloping one of the worst human
scourges (meningitis) the authori-
ties have seen fit to make a depar-
ture on the lines of practical com-
mon-sense by establishing a num-
ber of camps, located in compara-
tively favorable sites I understand.
But this dreadful disease, so devel-
opjed by recklessness and foolishness
is still with us to claim its imfur-*
tun,ate victims; and. according to
the ?Age/? at any rate* the powers
that he are as fit to deal with it
as to deal with any other great and
urgent national danger. Then how
long will thei Defence Department
?Mr- Pearce ?continue to palter in
the ?yes-no? attitude with in the
present juncture the most important
of all questions, that of conscripn
tion, which is the only medicine
calculated to make a complete and
rapid cure of the nation?s present
great complaint withheld in defers
ence to the wishes of a section of
the community which is both foolish
and misguided ? ? ? ; . > '


Conscription.
(By GEORGE K. JEPHeOTT.)
Some short time since I had the
pleasure of a very interesting and
informative conversation with a Bel-
gian gentleman who occupies a
prominent position among the con-
sular representatives in Australia*
Among other things conscription
irlamo up in our discussion* T was
brought up by a strongly anti-mill-
tarist father/ he said, ?'who quite
disapproved of Napoleon's pet de-
finition of human kind, ?Chair a
Canon? ??Feud foi Powder- But I
have liveid in France for ,a number
of years, and 1 found there- the.
most divided country in Europe?
the most dangerously divided ?into
socialists, anarchists, moderates and
re-ajetionaries, with the lines of
cleavage cutting sharpies! and going
deepest. A house divided against
itself, in doe I ?
And that house, France, oven in
times of peace was only saved by
conscription; the most democratic
institution, too, in that great de-
mocracy*
Under conscription the rich?sons
of professional men, sons of mer-
chants and millionaires ?live and
work side by side with the sons of
of laborers and shopmen; and if the
latter are the better men they are
soon placed above their aristocratic
comrades* This has proved the best
of all schools to create the true
Earner ad erie of Democracy?the great
living link that bound the country
together, making it one and indivis-
ible*
It has saved France. And had it
been introduced into Great Britain at
the very commencement of the war
it would have had an immense in-
fluence both upon Germany and the
neutral countries*
It is no use for us to complain of
the attitude or actions of the latter.
It was for us to so act as to give
them no possible cause toi doubt
either our spirit or our ultimate ac-
hievement. They could see that
Germany ?in however bad a cause-
was ??fighting all in? ?to the last
man, the last mark and the last ma-
chine ?and they do not see Great
Britain doing likewise* The adopi-
tion of conscription would have fur-
nished the one essential touchstone
as to cur capacity and intention to
accomplish our purpose that was
necessary to convince both friend
and foe.
It should by this time be undeni-
able ?at least by anyone worthy to
be called a British citizen?-that all
which is held good and precious,
not by us alone, but by all the
civilised world, is desperately at
stake to-day?all that is meant by
?The ashes of our fathers and the
temples of our gods.? Such being
the ease, should we not be more than
whiling to use any weapon that may
come to our hand, to submit to any
discipline and to make any Sacri-
fice that may be asked of us ? All
history tells us what happens to
those who refuse to pay the price
of liberty by personal service, which
is to fight for their enemies as
slaves after forfeiting the chance
to fight against them in defence of
their freedom-
What is this terrible thing, con-
scription, anyway that such dire
oppugnancy thereto is manifested by
a section in every community ? Ones
might imagine that it meant the
compulsion of men to fight against
their own country instead of merely
meaning as it does a provision that
men who claim the name and privi-
leges of citizenship shall not be
permitted any longer to shuffle out
of paying their share of the price
of such privilege s-
What natural right can any man
ha.ve as the citizen of a country he
is too cowardly or too selfish co de-
fend? If he is so prepared, is it


imaginable that he will have any
quarrel witn a system that shall
ensure him the adequate support of
his fellow countrymen?
We have seen the fruits of volun-
tarism through a long period of our
own history. Has it been shown to
be anything mere admirable than
mere anarchy, wherein tbe finest
flower of our national life has been
ceaselessly sacrificed often in the
interests of the most cowardly and
selfish portion of our people?
Can we in any honesty disagree
about what must be the eventful
effect upon the race of this conser-
vation of the cowardly and selfish
at the expense of the bravo and
(patriotic* generation after generation?
Can suph a system, or, rather, ab-
sence of all system in truth, under
any circumstances spell anything
else hut chaos, with its Inevitable
outcome of perpetual national danger
and racial degeneration?
It seems to be that the most mis-
guided fool in history is Jephthah,
with his vow to sacrifice the first
living thing that should come out
of his gates to welcome his return,
ensuring the destruction of the soul
that loved him best; and just such
insufferable insanity have we, dis-
played in our much vaunted Volun-
tarism, that has sacrificed millions
upoc millions of our dearest sons
to safeguard amongst other things
the interests of all those too cow-
ardly or too cunning to act as men
Against this servant of all
anarchy and injustice stands con-
scription with its standard of na-
tural justice, scientific social order
and decency of national life; with
its house set in order behind it and
ready to speak with the enemy at
its gates to some purpose, and to
conserve the precious lives of its
defenders by adequate and assured
support.
It is, indeed, doubtful and always
increasingly doubtful whether any
State can be a great fighting force
without con scrip tic n-
jNo historical instance is more
pregnant to-day than the story of
now the French rcc elution ad os, with
the whole social and economic fabric
of the ages falling in ruins around
diem, with the world in arms closing
upon their frontiers, by this one
word of conscription called out of
chaos their grand army of seven-
teen hundred thousand men and de-
fied that world in arms- .With that
conscript army Napoleon subdued!
continental Europe with almost the
ease and speed of some great games
and that he us -d it by-times to sub-
vert the liberties of France proves
nothing against it as a weapon of
national safely. Without conscript
tion France w r ould have been much
more quickly and shamefully en-
slaved by her outside enemies than
she was by her own sons-
Any weapon that may be dan?
gerous in the hands of autocracy?
as what weapon is not? ?may yet
be perfectly safe in the hands of an
enlightened demo-racy trained from
the cradle in the paths of freedom
and fellowship-
.Or, again, wha- made the Southern!
States in the American civil war
the terrible opponents they proved
to be in spite of their lack of prac-
tically all" manufacturing and mer-
cantile facilities their chief asset
being the patriotic devotion that led
them to adopt conscription at the
outbreak, of hostilities ? While the
North, after incalculable snedfioes
to the genius of voluntarism at
last, in spite of the most strenuous
braying's of the wild asses of Lib-
erty, under the wuse direction of
Lincoln, took advantage of the ex-
ample offered, enacted conscription
and ended the war upon exactly such
terms as they liked to grant-
In this great Empire we have the
means lying at hand to do all this,
and those in whose hands those
means. are placed, if they will not
make uce thereof, must answer at
the inexorable bar of fate*
The doom of Greece', free Greece,
when she was faced by the conscript
phalanxes of M acedonia conveys sn
especial message to our free and
easy Empire, where there is liberty
even for the cowards to skulk on**


uf7
ashamed in the rear and pick up all
the prizes that the brave let drop
to rush into the battle- The free
Greeks, heedless of the admonitions,
the entreaties, of their greatest ora-
tor, ?refused to train? as the phrase
goes* Demosthenes urged them in-
cessantly to cease depending on mer-
cenaries, to cease wrangling among
themselves to give personal service
and to organise, organise! Nothing
of.all this would they do; and so in
spite of belated heroism and vain
devotion at the last, at Cba.eroi.iea:,
instead of achieving another Mara-
thon or Salamis, mercenaries and
volunteers were sacrificed alike on
the altar of freedom with inefficiency,
and the liberty and the very life of
Greece vanished*
Cease, then, to call for volunteers,
kind yet more volunteers, and call
npi, rather, with one enacted word,
an embattled race with every man
of our millions fitted into his place,
ah integral part, of the great ma-
chine of victory-
As Dubois Cranee said in the
Assembly of ?B9, ?Every citizen
must bie a soldier, and every soldier
a citizen,? giving l in the fewest pos-
sible words the 'eternal creed of the
conscriptionist. And it is hard for
that ciODsrripitionist, who has thought
the matter out steadily and wholly,
to believe that the purblind, selfish
people who are always trying to
raise by any means dust enougn to
obscure tne whole world wide and
tremendous issue are not in reality
our worst and, number for number,
our most dangerous enemies-
The anti -c on scr i pitioni st, with his?
howl of ?Personal liberty in dan--
ger !? is to-day the most mortal
enemy of all liberty, national and
personal alike, and emphasise every
difficulty that stands in the path of
democracy- .
To the average intelligence it must
be apparent that if the action of
the volunteer is laudable then a?
machinery that ensures our volum?
leering en bloc cannot fie other than
right. It is fa nils to substitute order
for aniarehy, and to ensure that the
higher patriotic conscience of thej
nation shall have effect. And that
is the function of conscription* j
