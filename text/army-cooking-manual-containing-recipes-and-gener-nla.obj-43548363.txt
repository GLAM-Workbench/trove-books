FOR USE OF ARMY
CATERERS AND COOKS


AUSTRALIAN MILITARY FORCES.
Methods of Preparing Army Ration—including
Dehydrated Components—and Suggested Menu,
together with Useful Hints for Catering and
Cooking Personnel.
COMPILED BY D.A.D.A.C.: QUEENSLAND L. OF C. AREA.
1. The contents of this booklet have been compiled for two main
reasons: —
(i.) To encourage and enable Army Cooks to prepare a variety
of palatable and attractive meals for all personnel, from
Army Rations.
(ii.) To assist Unit Caterers in arranging varied meals so
necessary to successful messing.
2. All dishes set out herein can be produced from the Army ration
assisted by certain components purchasable by supplementary Ration
allowance and are based on 100 men.
3. Menus set out are issued as a guide to Unit Caterers. It is
to be appreciated that Commanding Officers are at liberty to utilise
the Ration as they think fit, having regard to facilities available and
conditions under which the Unit is operating.
4. The Army Ration of to-day is scientifically based on providing
a “balanced diet.”
Particular attention is directed to the inclusion of Blue Boiler
Peas and Cheese in the Ration. These components are of paramount
importance in maintaining the balanced diet, and every effort is to
be made, by prepared dishes, to utilise the ration of these items daily.
5. Rations are issued for daily consumption and the building up
of surpluses by units is forbidden. In certain circumstances, surpluses
do accrue, and in such cases they must be reduced by—
(a) Deletions of surplus component in subsequent indents,
or
(b) Return of non-perishable items to nearest A.A.S.C. Issue
Depot (see G.R.O. Q.501/42).
6. As mentioned in paragraph 1, this booklet is for assisting Cater-
ing and Cooking personnel. It is to be used for that purpose and not
kept locked away in Unit Orderly Rooms.

(85) PREPARATION OF BLUE PEAS.
Blue Peas: This most important vegetable item of the War Ration
is difficult to use because of its hardness, which is the source of its
resistance to deterioration and of its great value to troops in war.
Peas can be used in two ways—
(i.) After soaking for forty-eight hours or more until germina-
tion begins and a small sprout appears;
(ii.) After soaking overnight and subsequently passing them
through a mincing machine.
If method (i.) is used, the peas can be used for any dish in which
fresh green peas are utilised.
Using method (ii.) the resultant pea mash, after gentle simmer-
ing (not boiling), can be used in making a variety of dishes or as
thickening in stews and soups.
Instruction for soaking Blue Peas—
1. For use when minced it is sufficient to cover with water and
allow to stand twelve hours.
2. For use as green (fresh) peas, place in a sandbag and immerse
in water for twelve hours as above.


Then remove from water and hang up in the shade. Dip bag in
water every two hours for forty-eight to sixty hours, when the small,
white sprout will be about long. The pea now tastes sweet and
is in fact fresh and growing.
A convenient quantity is 7 lbs. per 15- by 24-inch bag (or sand-
bag). Remember that moulds grow on wet bags and will spoil the
taste of the peas. Therefore, boil all bags before again using them
to soak a fresh batch of peas.
Important: When troops cannot be issued with fresh vegetables,
7 lbs. of germinated peas per fifty men suffice to keep men absolutely
fit and well.
Appended is a list of recipes for the use of minced peas.
Blue pea water makes an excellent stock for soup. Don’t throw
it away.

B


(120) POWDERED (DEHYDRATED) EGG.
This commodity (an excellent one if correctly handled) is often
misused. Common faults in its handling are—
(a) Incorrect mixing;
(b) Too rapid and too long cooking;
(c) Failure to correctly flavour;
(d) Failure to keep from contact with the air after opening.
2. The product may develop in processing, and through over long
storage or storage in unsuitable conditions, an “off flavour.” Simi-
larly, in processing it may develop a darker colour than its normal
pale yellow tint. Texture has also been found to vary, being sometimes
coarser and drier than the average product.
3. Off flavours may be described as ‘‘ cheesy, ” “burnt, ’’ or “stale. ’ ’
Even, however, if the powder has developed one or other of these off
flavours, which render it unsuitable! for scrambled eggs, omelettes,
etc., it is still quite suitable for the making of sweets, cakes, and
puddings, and the flavour generally can be masked for other purposes
by the use of flavouring elements, such as onions, dried herbs, cheese,
or bacon.
4. Storage and Care. —The matter of storage of the product is of
the greatest importance. Always store egg powder in a place as cool
as possible, and after a tin has been opened and some of the product
remains unused, see that the remainder is, if possible, placed in an
airtight receptacle, or at least made as secure from air as possible in
its own tin. In contact with air, the life of egg powder is very short
indeed.
5. Reconstitution—
(a) Sift the egg powder at least 4 times to remove lumps and to
aerate. If no sieve available, work any lumps out of the powder with
a fork and toss the mixture in the bowl with the fork to aerate. The
powder should fall at least 2 feet in the process. It is most important
that the powder should be as lump-free as possible before addition of
liquid.
(b) Work slowly into the powder enough co.ol water to form a
smooth thick paste (approximately equal parts of water and powder),
ensuring that no lumps remain. Work in slowly the remainder of the
water called for tq reconstitute and stir until a mixture of smooth and
even consistency is obtained. If a rotary beater is available, the
mixture may with advantage be whipped at this stage for a few
minutes.
(c) Allow to stand for at least half an hour (longer if
convenient) before using. Remember that egg powder is a dehydrated
product, and sufficient soakage of water must be allowed to permit
reconditioning.
(d) Stir vigorously with a circular motion or whip again imme-
diately before using.
6. Approximately three-fourths of an egg (76 per cent.) is water,
and the amount of water found, in practice, to be necessary to recon-
stitute the egg powder to the equivalent of fresh egg pulp is 21 pints
(50 ozs.) to 1 lb. of the powdered product. The product so reconsti-
tuted is used as the equivalent of a similar weight of fresh egg, roughly,
bulk for bulk, egg and water.

Tomatoes, cover ingredients with good Stock, cook for 45
minutes, add Rice which should absorb most of the liquid. Use
no Flour for thickening.
(194) GRAVY FOR ROAST BEEF, MUTTON OR PORK.
Cooks should attach equal importance to the preparation of
Gravies for Beef, Mutton, and Pork, as to the roasting of these meats,
as the correct treatment of the exuded meat juices will add to the
palatability and nutritive value of the meal.
The correct sealing of the meats before roasting should receive
careful attention, so that the cooking process will allow only the
minimum quantity of juices to escape. See that burning of the juices
is avoided, as burnt gravy tastes bitter and spoils the flavour of the
meat.
Method: Use approximately 4 lb. Flour, plain, for 100 men. Pour
surplus fat from roasting pan, leaving sufficient for blending
with flour. Add 1 dessertspoonful of Sugar, Pepper, and Salt to
taste, and add Stock or liquid from cooked root vegetables.
Cook in oven or on top of stove till nut brown colour is attained,
say 10 minutes. Serve boiling hot.
(195) CLEAR SOUP OR CONSOMME.

Eggs, and also the crushed egg shells. Bring to boil and allow to
simmer for two (2) hours. After straining through a wet, fine cloth,
we have the foundation for the various consommes, as set out —
Consomme a la Brunoise —Very small diced diameter
Mixed Root Vegetables,'French Beans or Peas.
Consomme a la Julienne —Strips of different Vegetables, 1-ineh
long by 4-inch square with some green for colour.
Consomme a la Chiffonade —Very finely shredded Lettuce.
Consomme a la Royale —Rich steamed Custard (sometimes
coloured,) dice 4-inch squares Mixed Vegetables.
Consomme a la Jardiniere —All varieties coloured Vegetables,
4-inch square.
Consomme aux Perles —Soaked Bullet Tapioca.
(196) BROWN SOUP.
Use all classes of Root Vegetables, with Celery, if procurable, and
braise with Dripping—if possible, add Bacon Rind or Ham Bones —
until water has been extracted, adding sufficient Flour for consistency.


When thoroughly browned, add Boiling Stock, mix and allow to
simmer slowly. This allows fat to be skimmed off and thus a clear
flavour is attained.
Various thick brown soups are: Onion, Celery, Ox Tail, Kidney,
Mulligatawny, &c.
Important: Save the peelings from Carrots and Parsnips as they
are excellent for Braising, Consommes, Espagnol, and Brown Sauces.
Wash well and drain before using. Also use Water in which Root
Vegetables have been cooked.
(197) JARDINIERE SOUP.
Ingredients; 10 lbs. Mixed Vegetables (all varieties), Stock, Pepper,
Salt.

(198) SOUPS—STOCKPOT.
The foundation is most important. Have a perfectly clean stock
pot. Break up all large bones, cover with cold water, adding 1 oz. Salt
to every gallon of Water and bring to boil slowly, allowing to simmer.
Constant skimming of the scum as it rises is necessary to attain a clear
stock. The fat which has been skimmed should be carefully strained
through hessian or muslin, and placed to one side—it is very suitable
for paste making and other purposes, as it does not carry a heavy
flavour as compared with roast dripping. If all stock is not required
on the day of preparation, surplus should be strained for next prepara-
tion or reduced by constant simmering to a meat glaze, which is very
useful for strengthening soups, sauces, or gravies, or it may be served
as a Beef Tea.
(199) SALAD DRESSING—MOCK MAYONNAISE.
Method; Use same method as for Bechamel Sauce, using a little more
Butter and use Boiling Water in place of milk. Cook for 10

(232) NOTES ON DEHYDRATED FOODS.
The problem of producing and supplying food for troops in
forward and tropical areas has reached major proportions. The
question of overcoming the difficulties of providing food that contains
the necessary food value, plus the essential protective minerals and
vitamins, may be answered by dehydration.
Dehydrated foods are valuable because they —
(i.) Provide foodstuffs containing the necessary food value plus
protective vitamins and minerals essential to the soldier’s
well-being.
(ii.) Minimise space, weight, and cost.
(iii.) Saving of surplus foodstuffs for future use.
(iv.) Enable a meal to be served possessing colour and variety,
(v.) Relieve the monotony of tinned foodstuffs.
Dehydrated foodstuffs always require soaking before cooking for
restoration of water contents. Periods of soaking differ with various
kinds, but the following times of soaking will be found satisfactory:—
(a) Mutton, at least 2 hours.
(b) Root vegetables, at least 1| hours- A longer period helps
to restore them to almost their original fresh appearance.
(e) Onions and greens, at least 1| hours. In emergency they
can be put straight into boiling salted water and cooked for
about 50 minutes.
Experimental tests show the following approximate absorption of
water: —
Dehydrated mutton absorbs water equal to 1} times its weight.
Dehydrated carrots absorbs water equal to 31 times its weight.
Dehydrated potatoes absorbs water equal to 3 times its weight.
Dehydrated onions absorbs water equal to 5 times its weight.
Dehydrated parsnips absorbs water equal to 2| times its weight.
Dehydrated leek absorbs water equal to 2| times its weight.
Dehydrated cabbage absorbs water equal to 3 times its weight.

Note—
Previous soaking in Water, three or four times the bulk
of the dehydrated food is essential. When cooking dehydrated
vegetables, place in Boiling Water and simmer for not less than
| hour. Prior to frying, they must be soaked and partly
cooked, but to preserve Vitamin C over-soaking should be
avoided when the vegetables are to be boiled. As far as possible,
the Water used to soak the Vegetables should be kept for
cooking purposes.

O
USE OF WHOLE WHEAT GRAIN AS STABLE ITEM
OF RATION.
The above may be used alone or with other available items of the
ration.
(250) WHOLE WHEAT ALONE.
The following Recipes for preparation of Whole Wheat pre-
suppose :
Time for Soaking. —This can be accomplished by time to time
dipping of grain (enclose in small, porous bag) in water.
By “cracking” of the wheat it is not to be understood that the
whole of the wheat should be gristed. It is intended to convey the
fact that if some of the berries are broken, sufficient gluten for
binding purposes will be released, and in the case of porridge, sufficient
gluten to give the “porridge” texture. Passage through a mincing
machine is a simple means of “cracking.”
In the case of Recipes 251, 2, 3 and 4. Means of grilling. Practic-
ally any flat metal surface will suffice for this purpose, e.g., bottom of
mess tin.
Any two flattish stones would suffice for purposes of cracking.
Given the very slight facilities required, as above, whole wheat may, as
indicated by the following recipes, be usefully and palatably employed.


(251) SAVOURY WHEAT CAKES (Chupatties).
4 ozs. Wheat. Approximately oz. Meat Extract. Pinch of Salt, a
little Water.

allowed to stand. (Where possible allow to stand over night.)
Water: As for drinking purposes —all Water must be treated before
adding to Spread.
REMEMBER! SAVE YOUR VEGETABLE WATERS FOR
SOUP AND STOCK.
O
(278) NOTES ON BREAD, DOUGHMAKING AND
BAKING.
Bread is made by mixing together Flour, W ater, Salt and Yeast.
These form a Dough, which should be maintained at 80 degrees Fabr.
while fermentation proceeds. The Yeast ferments the small amount of
sugars present in the flour as well as the additional sugar produced
in the dough itself during the fermentation period. The fermentation
also converts the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide gas. It is the
amount of this gas and the gas-retaining properties of the dough which
largely determine the quality of the loaf. Small quantities of acids
and other substances are also produced during fermentation, and these
acids bring about the ripening of the dough.
It is not enough for dough to have attained the right size or
become sufficiently distended with gas, it must be knocked back, i.e.,
have the gas squeezed out of it several times during fermentation. This
working of the dough helps ripening process, and bread of better colour
aud flavour results.


The quality of bread produced depends upon the following
factors: —
1. The character and quality of the flour.
2. The quality of the yeast.
3. The suitability of the plant and premises.
4. The proficiency of the bake.
The wheat from which our flour is manufactured varies consider-
ably, and this variation is reflected in the flour. For comparative
purposes, the wheat may be divided into three classes, namely Strong,
Medium, and Weak. The term “Strong” means that flour obtained
from strong wdieat gives a high yield of bread, handles well in the
dough, and gives well-risen loaves. Strong flours are, therefore, the
best for bread baking and Medium and Weak flour for scones, biscuits,
and pastries. Strong flours contain a higher percentage of gluten, a
nitrogeneous power of cohesion and elasticity, and makes possible the
production of a fine open textured loaf. Of course, it should be under-
stood that there is no absolute standard of quality, and it requires
some experience to recognise the different strengths of flours.
METHOD OF DOUGHMAKING.
As in every branch of cooking, the first duty to perform is to have
all necessary utensils at hand. Perfect cleanliness is necessary and
imperative. Sift Flour, to remove impurities, pieces of string, &c., into
mixing utensil, make well in centre and add Salt. Have Yeast
dissolved and ready, then heat the Water to desired degree. It
should be noted that the temperature of the weather is a great factor
in the finished temperature of the dough, which should be 80 degrees
to 82 degrees Fahr. when finished. The amounts required for a small
amount of bread are as follows: —15 lbs. Flour, 4 ozs. Salt, 3 ozs-
Dri Barm, 5 pints of Water.
Put Water into the centre of Flour and dissolve Salt, draw in some
Flour to make a thin hatter, then take Yeast and mix thoroughly. This
dough should be very tight if for steaming, a, lighter dough for
baking, and it greatly depends on the perfect mixing (which cannot
be overdone) on the resultant lightness, texture, and flavour. When
dough is completed, place in a box (butter or similar) to prove in a
place where no draughts can affect it. Cover well and allow to rise,
which should be between 3 and 4 hours, knock back and mix well again,
leave for approximately one-half hour, knead again and weigh off at
2 lbs. 3 ozs. each piece, mould and place in greased jam, apple, or other
suitable tins. Allow to prove again until tin nearly full, cover with
greased paper to prevent Water reaching bread and boil or steam in
camp kettle or other container for 2-J hours. Care must be taken to
ensure continuance of boiling or steaming. When cooked turn out on
to clean cloth to absorb steam, and prevent sweating.
When baking bread instead of steaming: Note carefully that the
finished dough should he of a lighter or softer texture, but will bake
in 45 to 50 minutes in an oven of 375 degrees Fahr., same method of
making being performed.
Note: Salt in bread is a very important item, as it has the proper-
ties of flavouring the bread, preventing fermentation changes, and
assists the coagulation of the gluten to form the cells imprisoning the
carbon dioxide gas, which gives us the light loaf, so care should be
taken that it is never omitted,
c


.(279) BREAD AND BISCUIT CRUMBS (USE OF).
Biscuit Crumbs may be used successfully as under:—
40 per cent, for all kinds of Steam Puddings;
30 per cent, for Short Pastry;
25 per cent, for Rolled Oats or Oatmeal Porridge;
5 per cent, soaked with little Water for Minced Beef or
Rissoles.
Making Biscuit Crumb Custard, Crumbling of Cutlets,
Croquettes, Fish au Gratin dishes, Baked Tomatoes, &c.
Breadcrumbs may be similarly used but not recommended for
short pastry. White Crumbs for Bread Sauce. Other bread can be
used for making Stuffing for Stuffed Steak, Ox Heart, Beef Olives,
Colonial Goose, Seasoning for Mutton, Pork or Veal, Ducks or Poultry.
Therefore, should never be wasted.
(280) SAVING OF FATS AND CLARIFYING OF DRIPPING.
It is most essentia] that no effort be spared in the saving and
using of all fats, not only from beef or mutton itself, but by boiling
down of bones, skimming off of soups, corn beef water, stock pot, &c.
By doing this, you will be helping your unit and, incidentally, your-
self, by having a plentiful supply of dripping on hand for kitchen use,
and all surplus can be sent to Salvage, who, in turn, sell, and proceeds
are handed back to your unit for C.O. to spend on the improvement of
messing. You will also be helping the war effort by saving fats which
can be used in the manufacture of explosives, soap, &c.
Fats can be rendered down, and/or collected in various ways:—
(i.) By placing all fats in boiler half filled with water to
prevent burning. -This water is kept boiling throughout
the day, and scum is continually rising. This scum should
be removed by skimming. Fires are allowed to die out
during the night, dripping then sets in a cake on top, and
sediment stays underneath. This dripping or fat can be
removed quite easily in cake form before fires are relighted.
(ii.) By breaking up “green bones” and treating as in (i.).
(iii.) By placing fat in dishes in oven or stove or over open fire,
(iv.) By skimming off contents of stock pot.
(v.) By skimming off corn beef water, soups, &c.
Dripping—the product of fat—is graded into various grades, and,
naturally, the higher the grade, the better the return. But on no
account throw any of it away, it can be all sold, and, whilst it may be
unfit for use in the kitchen, it will be collected by Salvage and disposed
of to best advantage.
Care should he taken in the rendering of fat, especially for
cooking purposes. It should be kept as clean as possible.
Choicest dripping is secured from marrow* hones, such as shin, leg
bones, bolar cannon or thigh bones.
Kidney fat or suet rendered down on its own is usually a rather
hard dripping, but if a portion of selvidge or marrow' fat is mixed
during the rendering, you will get a first-grade dripping. This
dripping is of a crumbly nature, easily mixed with flour, and excellent
lor pastry.


A small quantity of salt sprinkled into the water causes sediment
to sink to the bottom, thus assisting in the clarifying. If corn beef is
included in that being rendered down, salt should not be necessary.
When the fat is thoroughly rendered out, and after allowing to
simmer slowly, strain off through a strainer or clean piece of hessian,
allowing no water to remain in the dripping put away.
If dripping is slightly burnt on rendering, the taste may be
removed by adding a cut-up lemon, with a little salt, to some clean
water and reclarifying.
(281) COOKING—HINTS ON.
The effects of over cooking food cannot be exaggerated. Meat is
rendered tough, dry, and unpalatable, and the fats are melted out.
Vegetables become sodden, and the various salts, which are most
valuable, are lost.
Make dishes appetising and pleasing to the eye.
Baked or roast meat should he first placed in a hot oven. This
quickly hardens the albumen and so prevents the escape of the juices.
Remember:
Check available rations and ingredients with recipe.
Check number of troops to be fed.
Calculate the time necessary for cooking the various dishes.
Collect all the necessary utensils and ingredients before starting
to cook.
Attend to all stoves.
Do not use unnecessary number of utensils.
Don’t prepare salads and cook vegetables too long before they are
needed.
Use Vegetable Waters for Soups and Stock. See your utensils
and preparation areas are spotlessly clean.
When boiling meat remove the scum as it rises, or it will spoil
the look of the meat.
Do not boil a stew; it should only he allowed to simmer; a stew
boiled is a stew spoiled.
Take away all fat before making a stew.
Do not boil cabbage with the lid of the utensil on; to do so
spoils the colour of the cabbage.
Do not forget your seasoning. Salt brings out other flavours.
Cut bacon as thin as possible for frying.
(282) NOTES ON BREWING TEA.
The best method of preparing tea is to place the tea in a muslin
bag, tied loosely or in an infuser, thus leaving room for the leaves to
swell.
Put bags or infuser into tea cans or kettles, pour on boiling water,
cover and allow to remain for ten minutes. Remove leaves and add
sugar and milk.


It is important the boiling water only should be used for brewing,
warm water can be added after the tea has drawn.
Tea should never be made in a vessel that has contained broth or
soup.
(283) TO MAKE COFFEE FOR 100 MEN.
Ingredients: lbs. Coffee, 6 gallons Boiling Water, 2 gallons Boiling
Milk, pinch of Salt.
Put two dixies (6 gallons) of Water on stove, bring to boil, divide the
Coffee equally and put on top of Boiling Water, add a pinch of
Salt to taste, to sharpen the flavour of the Coffee. Bring to the
boil again and let simmer with the lid on for 40 minutes. Bring
Milk to boil. Strain Coffee through fine strainer or muslin into
three tea buckets, then add the Milk equally. Keep very hot
until required, but do not boil after Milk is added.
Alternative Method: Same quantities as above. Put one dixie (3
gallons) of Water on the stove, bring to boil, add all the Coffee
and a pinch of Salt to taste, bring to boil again and let simmer
40 minutes, and let stand over night with lid on. Bring to boil
again, strain equally into three tea buckets, then add 2 gallons
of Boiling Milk and 3 gallons of Boiling Water, divide equally
into the three buckets. Keep very hot until required. Do not
boil after Milk is added.
To obtain a stronger aroma of Coffee: Spread the dry Coffee
on a clean tray and place in a moderate oven with the door open
for a few minutes to warm the Coffee, then make the Coffee in
the usual manner.
(284) WATER ICING.
Ingredients: Icing Sugar, cold Water, Flavouring and Colouring as
desired.
Method: Mix Icing Sugar with Water to a batter so that it will spread

TEST.
Method: Cut up half a dozen cubes of stale bread and when fat has
ceased to bubble (i.e., the water has all evaporated) and is still
and quiet and starting to give off a blue smoke drop the cubes of
bread into fat. The temperature of the boiling fat is determined
by the period of time it takes to turn the bread to a golden
brown.
Time to Brown. Temperature.
Over 1 minute 350° P. or under
1 minute 360° F.
