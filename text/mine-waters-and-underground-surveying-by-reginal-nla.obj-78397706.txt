MINE WATERS AND UNDERGROUND SURVEYING.
Reginald A. F. Mureat.
[Read before the Victorian Institute of Surveyors , March 28th, 1883.]
The subject of mine drainage and tbe grave importance of
accurate underground surveying in connection therewith have
lately been brought into prominence by the appalling disaster
in the New Australasian mine, near Creswick. Though unable
to contribute any new facts or views derived from original
research, I venture to submit for the consideration of the
members of this Institute a statement of the recognised
phenomena in connection with the occurrence of subterranean
waters, and some suggestions as to the part which should be
taken by underground mining surveyors in averting danger
arising therefrom.
It is hoped that the remarks offered may tend to manifest
the necessity of making the utmost practical use of the
knowledge possessed by us as to methods of mine surveying;
to exalt the importance of the profession in the eyes of its own
members as well as in those of the mining community at large;
and to aid in causing measures to be taken which will render
further catastrophe impossible.
All underground water is of meteoric origin: of the total
rainfall a certain proportion is absorbed into the earth, and
the amount of this proportion depends on the degrees of
permeability of the geological formations. A host of illustra-
tions might be adduced, each exhibiting certain phenomena in
connection with subterranean waters, but in this paper it is
proposed to treat only of underground waters in relation to
the geological conditions observable in the deep alluvial lead
workings of this colony, taking as a typical instance the deep
lead system extending north from Creswick, and contained
within the watershed of the central or Deep Creek section of
the Loddon Valley.


The watershed of the present drainage area here very nearly
coincides with that of the ancient drainage system, of which the
deep leads were once the channels.
The geological features, broadly stated, simply embrace two
groups : Ist. The primary silurian strata forming the bed-rock
of the whole area, except a few localities where granite appears;
2nd. The tertiary, sedimentary, and volcanic formations filling
the deeper portions of the channels in, and overspreading wide
areas between the exposed ridges of, the silurian and granite
bed-rock.
The granite and silurian rocks are but slightly permeable by
water: it is true that water does penetrate to considerable depths,
but principally along lodes, veins, or fissures, and then only to
certain limits, for in some of our deepest mines the lower levels
are nearly dry.
There would appear to be little or very slow natural
movement of the water in the bed-rock: having once saturated
the latter to a certain extent, the water remains for the most
part stationary until tapped by mining operations, and there are
no naturally-formed subterranean passages as in some other
formations, through which water can flow freely.
In the tertiary volcanic and sedimentary layers very different
conditions prevail: the basalts absorb water largely, while the
extinct volcanic cones, such as those of the Smeaton district,
composed of loose incoherent volcanic ash and scoria, resemble
huge sponges, which absorb nearly every drop of rain that falls
on them and allow a very small proportion to escape by surface
flow.
The sedimentary layers between the various lava-flows and
those resting immediately on the bed-rock are nearly all of a
pervious character; beds of clay occur occasionally through
which water does not percolate, but most of the deposits are
sandy or gravelly and readily admit of its passage. The depth
to which the water absorbed at the surface penetrates the
basalts and sedimentary layers, and the proportions of its
distribution through those layers, all depend on local degrees of
permeability and the respective arrangement of the pervious and
impervious layers.
The surface of the nearly impermeable silurian rock
forming the bed-rock of the leads has a general and persistent
slope seaward; the bedding of the super-imposed tertiary iayers
inclines in the same general direction ; consequently, all waters
absorbed by the tertiaries have a tendency to move seaward
through the deposits into which they penetrate from the surface,
and in the case of the Oeswick leads this seaward direction is at
first northerly towards the Murray Valley.
Of the entire drainage area of the Deep Creek and its


tributaries a large portion consists of exposed silurian country,
and of the rain falling on this only a small proportion penetrates
into the bed-rock, the rest escaping by evaporation and surface
flow.
Some of the surface flow is no doubt absorbed when the
channels through which it is carried off cross volcanic areas or
touch the tertiary sedimentary beds, but it would not appear
that under natural conditions very much of the water falling
originally on exposed silurian country eventually finds its way
into the deep leads.
When mining operations, in following leads from shallow to
deep ground under basalt, have opened a way for it there is
necessarily a considerable access of water to the leads at the
places where such work has been done. Naturally, however,
most of the water in the leads is what has fallen on the volcanic
areas and percolated to the subjacent drifts, or has found its
way down the slopes of the silurian rocks at the margins of the
valleys, and so passed into and under the tertiary layers.
Given the area occupied by pervious formations ; given also
the average rain-fall and the proportions which escape by surface
flow and evaporation from that area, and a fair estimate might
be arrived at as to the total amount of water that annually flows
underground through the basalts and drifts of a lead-system,
though it would be a complicated undertaking to arrive at even
an approximation to the proportions in which this total amount
is distributed through the respective layers of basalt, drift,
sand, &c.
Some water runs along the lowest stratum or gutter drift,
some in drifts above it or between the basaltic layers. It is not
uncommon in sinking shafts to pass through very wet ground
in the intermediate layers, and having timbered and puddled
that water back, to find the gutter water comparatively easy to
dispose of.
In other cases the bulk of the water is in the gutter drift
or in loose gravelly ? headings ? immediately above it, and there
may also be cases where water distributed through various layers
over one portion of a lead is concentrated into one stratum in
another. ?
In every lead, however, the water percolating the forma-
tions above the bed-rock may be divided into two sections ?
Ist. Water of saturation, or that held as in a sponge by the
formations. 2nd. The quantity of water actually in motion
sea-ward. The first can be exhausted in working a mine; the
second is a constant, varying in volume according to the rain-
fall, but more equable in its rate of flow than the surface
streams. Thus it is frequently found in the first workings of an
alluvial mine that the influx of water is almost unmanageable,


but having once subdued it to the extent of exhausting the
water of saturation, the regular how or ? constant ? can be kept
under with comparative ease. It not unfrequently happens that
an old bore-hole or an abandoned shaft allows passage to the
gutter-level of water which would otherwise have continued to
pass away through layers above.
As shown by the Creswick accident and several others of
less magnitude that have at various times occurred, the principal
danger from underground water lies in unexpectedly breaking
into its accumulations in blocked-out and abandoned ground,
frequently in large volume and under considerable pressure.
When such an accumulation is tapped by the workings of a
mine lower down the lead, damage inevitably ensues unless
proper precautions have been taken. There are legal enactments
requiring the exercise of such precautions, and mine managers
as a rule observe them; but to use them effectually proper
surveys are absolutely necessary.
In the case of the Creswick accident the evidence showed
the actual positions of the two shafts to differ from those recorded
on the working plan by some fifty feet ?a discrepancy sufficient
in itself wfien undetected to nullify all precautions taken when
the new workings were approaching the old. The mining
manager, a man of established and well-earned reputation in
his capacity, had accepted as correct the working plans fur-
nished to him; and whatever other causes may have operated
there can be no doubt that the disaster was primarily due to the
want of exact surface and underground surveys properly con-
nected, and of accurately prepared plans representing them.
From the northernmost of the Creswick and Smeaton mines
now actually raising gold, the continuations northward of the
known leads, besides numerous as yet undiscovered tributaries,
are likely to be remuneratively worked beneath the basalt of the
Deep Creek and Loddon Valley for at least thirty miles. The
aggregate quantity of underground water in the leads beneath
such an extent of country must necessarily be very great, and
as the work is progressing northward or down the leads it is
likely, in the natural course of events, that the southernmost
mines, or those up the leads, will be the first to be worked out
and abandoned, leaving great areas of blocked out ground to be
filled with water. Even without the awful experience already
gained, it would be easy to anticipate the disasters likely to
accrue from the neglect of precautions against danger from such
water, and the very best preliminary safeguard would consist in
stringently enforced regulations compelling exact surveys to be
made of the underground workings of each mine, and to be
properly connected with equally exact surface surveys from shaft
to shaft.


As regards details in the practice of underground surveying,
each surveyor may possibly have his own views, and the main
methods of operation now generally adopted are so well known
among surveyors as to require but brief notice.
For the establishment of a common meridian in connecting
an underground with a surface survey, where only one shaft is
obtainable, it seems impossible to devise a more efficient plan
than the usual one of suspending two heavy plummets in the
shaft by means of wires or strong fine cords, and regarding the
bearings between the wires or cords?at the surface and under-
ground respectively?as absolutely identical in direction.
For carrying the survey from the shaft along the drives, and
for ascertaining the differences of level, no better instrument
than the theodolite and steel tape, the level and staff, are at
present known : Everything depends on the way in which these
methods and appliances are used; scrupulous care, and the
determination to be thwarted by no difficulty in obtaining the
greatest possible exactitude, are the greatest requisites, and are
perhaps more essential in an underground than in a surface
survey.
Most mining managers can make underground .surveys and
prepare plans from them sufficiently well for working purposes,
but few are qualified as mining surveyors in the proper
acceptation of the term, and even if they were it would be more
satisfactory to themselves, their companies, and the working
miners, were their work checked and their main levels surveyed
by competent surveyors preyed to possess the necessary
qualifications of skill and experience and specially appointed for
the purpose. It would be difficult to find a country more
suitable for exact surface surveying than that extending from
Smeaton to Laanecoorie, through which pass the extensions of
the Ores wick leads ; it is devoid of scrub or timber, is for the
most part level, and the hills which do occur are bald volcanic
cones admirably adapted for stations for triangulation. On a
plan of such a survey there would be no excuse for a single shaft
or bore hole being shown a foot out of its true position.
With mining operations of such magnitude in progress, and
their very much greater extension in prospect, it is desirable
that from the outset a proper record be kept of the underground
workings as they advance, both as a means of obtaining
scientific information and as a safeguard against flooding; that
such survey should be executed by thoroughly qualified
responsible members of the profession, and should include not
only the linear measurements but also the measurements of
shafts and the relations of surface and underground levels along
the courses of the leads ; that locality plans should be kept on
which such work should be plotted, and should be open to


inspection by the public; and that the surveyors should also
from time to time check and certify to the accuracy of the
working plans used at the different mines.
It may be objected that in the case of the district under
notice the land is all private property, but if the Legislature has
power to cause inspection of mines under such conditions it has
also the power to enforce the execution of proper surveys, and
where such are evidently necessary as aids to mine-inspectors
and managers in guarding against danger to human life, it is of
paramount importance that they should be made compulsory on
all mine owners.
In addition to the provision against accident which the
surveys advocated would afford, valuable scientific information
would be gained; in the one matter of noting the position of
quartz reefs cut in driving through the bed-rock ?a subject
much neglected by alluvial mine managers ?records would be
obtained which would prove valuable perhaps many years
hence.
The public would also have the opportunity of knowing the
exact condition of progress in each mine, and mining investment
as a pursuit would be deprived of much of the gambling
element which at present forms such an obnoxious feature in it.
