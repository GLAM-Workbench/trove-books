REPORT
OF THE
TO THE J|eMBERS AND J^DHERENTS
OF THE
CHURCH IN TOWN AND COUNTRY.
When we entered office the Church?s affairs generally were in a
disorganized state. Unity amongst the friends of the Church
had become much unsettled. The exchequer was empty and all
the regular means of obtaining funds were wholly suspended.
The written records of the Church had suffered unaccountable
violence, and from the minutes and documents still left and re-
maining, little information regarding the origin, cost, or past
history of the Church could be certainly obtained.
We have secured the preservation of all we could find of
these records by inserting them in a new minute book. We have
also kept a minute and faithful record of our own proceedings
during the term of our office.
Shortly after we came into office several considerable debts
were reported as standing against the Church. For many reasons,
we, as your Committee, did not feel ourselves to be lawfully respon-
sible, even if we had had the means at our command to meet
them. At the same time if they are accounted just and approved
by the congregation they might be met, withott prejudice to the
Church?s present affairs, by an extraordinary subscription.
We regret that the Stipend Fund has not met with a far
more liberal support than that which the Treasurer?s Statement
reveals. A minimum Stipend o| �2OO per annum to begin with,
might, we thought, be reasonably expected j but the result has


come very far shoi?t of verifying our hopes. And to make the
deficiency still more seriously to be regretted, no extra provision
has been made for the Minister?s outfit or residence. "We would
therefore earnestly invite the attention of the members and ad-
herents of the Church to this matter, and appeal to them for an
increase of their own liberality, and the exercise of their in
fluence with others, and we trust that none concerned will give
only an idle attention to this appeal.
No steps have yet been taken by us to raise funds for the
erection or purchase of a Manse, The many other pressing
necessities of the Church (some of which are now removed),
together with the disastrous influence of the long drought upon
business and labor, put this matter beyond our immediate power.
That a Manse is, in any township like G-oondiwindi, absolutely
necessary, no one can doubt. Under some circumstances it is
more necessary than the Church itself. Tet while the Christian
population of this district has twice subscribed money for a
Church, it has overlooked the Manse altogether. The necessity
for a Manse is allowed to be immediate. We therefore feel
justified in taking this opportunity of bringing the matter
earnestly under the notice of the Congregation and of our suc-
cessors in office.
The Treasurer has been provided with a parcel of printed
circulars, by the use of which he will be enabled easily to apprise
subscribers living at a distance from town of the dates upon
which quarterly subscriptions to stipend fall due, and attention
to these circulars, when received, is respectfully requested. Sub-
scribers in the town and its immediate suburbs will, as usual, be
called upon by a collector some day during the week preceding
the termination of each Quarter, and his visits, it is to be hoped,
will meet with the usual liberality.
Wo have during the past year supplied the Church with new
pews, lamps, and pulpit, as being absolutely requisite,' not more
for the comfort of the worshippers than for the decent appear-
ance of God?s House of Prayer.


Provision for this year?s Annual Tea Meeting was made by
Mesdames M'Konzie, Threwecke, Caper, Bridson, Bailey, Hal-
loran, Wallis, Green, M?Donald, and Davis. The Tea Meeting
was a great success, and the Committee now acknowledge their
deep indebtedness to the ladies named for their great kindness
upon this occasion.
The Subscription List for raising funds to help to furnish
the Church was so successfully conducted by Mr. John Currie
that by the end of the year he had placed in the Treasurer?s
hands very nearly �2O.
We soon found it necessary to secure the services of an
Organist by the payment of a quarterly salary, no offer of
gratuitous services having been received from any one on the
regularity of which the Committee could depend.
We have taken the necessary steps for getting the Church
Building and its Furniture insured, and this transaction will be
completed in a few days.
A Tract Service, the object of which is to bring evangelical
truth in a popular form before the families of the town and
suburbs, and which meets with general acceptance, is maintained
at the sole expense of Mr. B. M?Donald, Mrs. Stephen Dwyer,
and Mrs Samuel Droughton.
The Sabbath School is in a flourishing condition. There
are 50 names on the roll, giving an average attendance of 42.
There is an able staff of Teachers engaged in this good work,
whose regular attention to their duties, and constant interest in
the children?s welfare, are producing the happiest results. There
is a Library in connection with the School, to which, during the
past year, no addition has been made. The children referred
to in this paragraph are those living in the town and suburbs.
A much larger number, taken collectively, live beyond these
limits, for whom, as yet, no congregational means of religious
instruction has been provided, who, nevertheless, belong to
families numbered in the congregation. For them a Tract Ser-
vice is in contemplation, which will to some extent remedy so
great a want. Special donations of course for such a service
will be required, and special attention is now invited to it.


Besides the town and immediate suburbs, many of the sur-
rounding stations, both in Queensland and New South Wales,
receive the services of Mr. M?Ara. His plan is to visit these
stations every two months at least. In so wide a district, how-
ever, any one of many possible occurrences may at any time
throw him out of his arrangements by a week or two. As far
as possible this plan will be carried out in the future.
The Committee, in laying this report before the Congrega-
tion, desire to acknowledge the goodness of the Lord in that
measure of success which has attended their efforts, and to com-
mend their successors in office to the same gracious and benign
influence.
order of the Committee,
STEPHEN DWYEE,
Hon, Secbetaey.
