FOREWORD
NEVER in the history of the world has an exhibition been attempted
whose objects were of such commercial and educational value as
the British Empire Exhibition of 1924.
Australia, fully realising its significance, its possibilities, its value as an
advertising medium, has endeavoured to make its exhibit so comprehensive
and complete that each visitor who enters the Australian Pavilion will
carry away an indelible impression of a country rich in all classes of com-
mercial activity, and a country whose natural resources are so vast and
varied that it is impossible to measure them in terms of monetary value.
One of the most important results of the British Empire Exhibition will
be the impetus to the trade of the Empire countries certain to be .given by
so magnificent a demonstration of their capacity to produce and to manu-
facture goods necessary to the life of their peoples. In that demonstration
of the Empire’s immense and inexhaustible powers, Australia, as her
Pavilion at Wembley shows, takes a prominent part. If, in common with
that of the other Dominions, Australia’s display of her products and manu-
factures induces the support of them by British consumers, one of the great
aims in view by the exhibiting Empire countries will be realised.
Already, as will be seen in the figures quoted below, the overseas trade
of Australia is of a magnitude and a value which give vivid witness to the
productiveness of the Australian soil, and the vigour of the Australian
people. But those figures represent the beginnings only of the trade that
will be possible to the Commonwealth in days when her capacity to pro-
duce is secured by the energies of a population more nearly adequate to her
productive powers. The value of Australia’s oversea trade in the financial
year ending June 30th, 1923, was as follows :—lmports, £131,808,673 ;
Exports, £117,913,083 ; Total trade for the year, £249,721,756. In 1913,
the value of the oversea trade of Australia was £158,321,422. The increase
in ten years amounted, therefore, to nearly £100,000,000. These figures
need no comment to emphasise either the purchasing ability of, or the
amount and quality of work being done by a population which, on June
30th, 1923, in its aggregate of men, women and children, numbered only
5,688,000 persons.
Of great importance, and giving impressiveness to the possibilities of
Australia’s trade with Great Britain —a trade which may safely be expected
to increase in volume as a result of this Exhibition—is the fact that in 1922
Australia bought from the Motherland goods valued at £60,000,000, a
total exceeded by only one other country in the world. That power to
purchase, and that desire to purchase, make Australia one of Great Britain’s
best customers.
AUSTRALI A THE LAND OF OPPORTUNITY


AUSTRALIA’S GREATNESS.
Australia covers an area of,nearly 3,000,000 square miles. The immensity
of Australia’s area, however, is only the beginning of the story of Australia’s
greatness. That greatness is founded upon the almost fabulous possibilities
of a soil which already has produced and is producing wealth in enormous
aggregates and of many kinds. Australia’s output of gold and silver, of tin
and copper and lead, of coal and of iron, and the wealth of Australia’s yields
of wool and wheat, already establish her as one of the richest countries of
the world in productive capacity. But her great expanse of 3,000,000 square
miles is still, for the most part, a storehouse of unrealised riches. The
present population of the Commonwealth is under 6,000,000. If the
enormous wealth of Australia’s production to date has resulted from the
labours of so few, incalculable wealth, surely, is destined for an adequately
peopled Australia. It is one of the functions of Australia’s exhibit to
emphasise the attractiveness of Australia as a field for the energies of British
workers who think of seeking the wider opportunities offered by an Empire
country oversea.
In that regard, attention is drawn to the scheme now operating for the
migration to, and the settlement in Australia, of British agricultural workers
and their families, domestic workers, and British boys desiring to be trained
as agriculturalists. Full particulars of the generous inducements now on
offer to approved migrants may be had at the office of the Director of
Migration and Settlement, Australia House, Strand, London, or from his
representative at the Exhibition.
Australia hopes to prove beyond question by this display that her mi-
gration schemes, and the attractiveness for British workers claimed for those
schemes, are fully justified. The Commonwealth needs British settlers, and
deserves British settlers. And the appeal made to British capital to assist
towards the cost of the vast Australian developmental works necessary to
prepare the way for their comfortable and prosperous settlement, is no less
justified. The investment is investment in a land of marvellous productive
power, energised by the work of British hands and British brains. The
return on that investment is certain.
AUSTRALIA’S RESOURCES.
Australia’s productive resources are such that the value of production
per inhabitant exceeds that of any other country in the world. In the year
1922, the value of the total production was at the rate of £65 for every
inhabitant of Australia. The total production in 1922 in the primary indus-
tries of Australia —the Pastoral, Agricultural, Dairying, Poultry and Bee-
farming, Mining and Forestry and Fishing Industries—was worth
£346,662,000. In the year 1912, the primary products of Australia as a
whole were worth £206,675,000. Within ten years, therefore, they increased
in value by nearly £140,000,000.
AUSTRALIA —LAND OF SUNSHINE


Australia possesses vast coalfields, huge deposits of iron, and incalculable
wealth in gold, silver, lead, copper, tin and zinc, and most of the non-metallic
minerals. This richness in raw materials suggests a great future for the
manufacturing industry of Australia, at present only in the infant stage, but
protected and helped by a scientific tariff, steadily growing. In 1916, 15,010
factories were in operation in Australia. In 1922 the number was 18,023,
an increase within six years of 3,000 factories. The value of the output of
those factories in 1916 was £172,574,845. In 1922 the value of the output
was £320,331,765.
The Australian exhibit at Wembley marks an important change in Aus-
tralia’s exhibition policy. Previously, the States of the Commonwealth
each made separate displays. For the Empire Exhibition, however, the
Commonwealth and State Governments have co-operated in organising the
Australian exhibit on a Federal basis. The exhibitors are representative
only of their respective sections of industry or production. The goods
exhibited are as prepared for ordinary trade purposes, and, generally
speaking, were not specially selected or prepared for exhibition.

AGRICULTURE
From the exhibits in this section the visitor to the Australian Pavilion
will learn much concerning the great agricultural industry of Australia.
Laid out before him are the products which the soil of Australia produces
in such richness of variety and abundance. Australia’s wheat, in particular,
is exhibited to the extent which its importance justifies. The wealth of the
yield of all the Australian grains that have long been famous, is displayed
for the visitor’s inspection, and he will learn, perhaps for the first time, of the
capacity of Australia to produce new and rapidly expanding yields of cotton,
tobacco and other crops. The orchards of Australia have been drawn upon
for an exhibit of the astonishing variety possible only to a country whose
climatic conditions range from tropical to temperate.
BEE PRODUCTS
Bee-keeping is one of the minoi agricultural industries of Australia.
The total number of hives in the Commonwealth is estimated to be 142,476.
Samples of the honey and bees-wax produced are shown on Stand No. 38 5
the exhibitors being: —

CEREALS AND PRODUCTS
The chief feature in this Section is the panoramic scene of the harvesting
of an Australian Wheat Field (Stand No. 55). The immense area of
an Australian Wheatfield is strikingly suggested in this scene, which shows
the crop being harvested by a number of machines called header-harvesters.
Each of these machines heads, strips, winnows, and bags the golden grain,
and covers on an average 15 acres per day. Mass production of wheat, as
practised in Australia, necessitates the employment of the latest labour-
saving agricultural machinery, types of which are shown in the Manu-
factures Section.
Further stages in the handling of wheat are shown on Stands Nos. 46
& 56. At the former the gristing of the wheat is demonstrated in a
small mill exhibited by Messrs. A. R. Tattersall & Co., Ltd., 75 Mark
A U S T R A L I A the Land of Opportunity


Lane, London, E.C. Opposite, on Stand No. 56, the flour is manufactured
into bread, rolls, cakes and pastries, which will be served in the restaurant
at the East end of the Pavilion, or which may be purchased at the Stand.
The bakery plant was supplied by Messrs. Joseph Baker, Sons & Perkins,
Ltd., Kingsway House, Kingsway, London, W.C.2.
The cereals trophy (Stand No. 44), the sunlike rays of which are
made with grain and seeds of various colours, is a novel feature worthy of
special attention.

COTTON AND OTHER FIBRES
At the present time cotton growing is creating greater interest in
Australia than any other rural industry. It seems destined to become one
of the great assets of the Commonwealth, comparable to wool-growing,
wheat-growing, and dairy-farming. Australian cotton has already been
proved to be of most excellent quality. Cotton exhibits are shown on
Stand No. 54- At the back of the Stand there is a panoramic scene of an
Australian cottonfield. In showcases in front, cotton is shown in various

ORCHARD AND GARDEN PRODUCTS
The Australian orchardist’s life at the happiest period of his year (the
harvest) is graphically depicted in the large panoramic scene opposite the
main entrance to the Pavilion (Stand No. 2).
The orchardist and his family are shown gathering the season’s crop.
In the foreground the process of grading fruit for export is in operation.
The grader being used is the “ Lomas-Excelsior,” exhibited by S. W.
Marshall, Kingston, Tasmania.
Other phases of orcharding are illustrated in the fruit trophy (Stand
No. 51) and irrigation trophy (Stand No. 13).
Fresh fruit—apples, pears, plums, peaches, and grapes and oranges in
season —are displayed in the refrigerator (Stand No. 43), and on stands
fronting the Main Entrance.
Orchard and Garden Products, processed in various ways, will be found
on Stand No. 52, and also on the fruit and irrigation trophies.
Behind the Australian Pavilion, near the entrance to the Cinema Theatre,
the visitor will find a working model of an Australian irrigation block.

CANBERRA
(Stand No. 25)
The seat of the Commonwealth Government is temporarily at Melbourne,
but will be transferred to the Federal Capital at Canberra when the new
city is ready for occupation. Canberra is charmingly situated in the
Federal Territory, an area of some 900 square miles acquired by the
Commonwealth from New South Wales in 1910. The new city is being
established on modern approved town-planning lines. It is expected the
Commonwealth Parliament will meet there in two or three years’ time. The
Canberra exhibit consists chiefly of a panoramic scene of the capital city site.

DAIRY PRODUCE
The dairy industry is represented in the Australian Pavilion by an exhibit
in keeping with its well-established position in Australia. In the refrigerator
(Stand No. 43) is a display of the choicest Australian butter which is being
served in all restaurants throughout the Exhibition excepting that in the
New Zealand Pavilion.
On Stand No. 48 is a display of cheese, including the largest cheese
ever made in Australia. This cheese weighs tons. It was made by the
Pittsworth Dairy Co., Pittsworth, Queensland, and 3,445 gallons of pas-
teurised milk were used in its manufacture.
Non-refrigerated dairy produce, such as condensed milk, tinned cheese,
tinned butter, casein and milk foods will be found on Stand No. 58- The
pig has a recognised place on the dairy farm as a consistent and substantial
revenue producer, and bacon and hams and other pig products are therefore
appropriately exhibited here also.
The most attractive features of the dairy exhibit will, however, be the
dairy trophy (Stand No. 41) and the panoramic scene (Stand No. 57).
The former consists of a number of typical scenes on a dairy farm. The
latter depicts the sunny, genial dairying country in Australia, where the
cows graze in the open all the year round, and the dairyman knows not the
discomforts and hardships of a snow-bound winter. He has not to resort
to the housing and stall-feeding of his cattle, that load the costs of production.
The rippling creek gives to this panoramic scene a realistic and typical effect.

EDUCATION
(Stand No. 53)
In Australia education is compulsory and free. Elementary (or
‘ primary ”) education is supplied by the schools of the State, built, staffed,
and inspected by a Department of the State Government concerned. There
are other elementary schools, conducted by private persons or religious
bodies, to which parents may choose to send their children. Beyond this
primary and universal stage of education the States are increasingly en-
couraging further advance by means of “ continuation ” schools, “ high ”
schools, technical colleges, training colleges, and universities. These
cannot be thrown as freely open to all and every pupil, as are the primary
schools. Nevertheless, liberal subsidies and endowments, scholarships and
bursaries, make easy the path of the intelligent aspirant.
)&,The educational exhibits in the Australian Pavilion are chiefly the work of
pupils of the primary, high, and technical colleges, and are exhibited by :

FISHERIES
Australia possesses an abundant and varied fish fauna, embracing
both tropical and temperate, indigenous and imported varieties. In the
refrigerator (Stand No. 43) a number of varieties ate exhibited in blocks
of ice. These include schnapper and Murray cod which are perhaps the
most popular food fishes in Australia. Pearling is carried on extensively
off the north-western and north-eastern coasts of the continent.
The pearling scene (Stand No. 8) depicts divers descending to
collect pearl shell. White divers use the regulation diver’s dress, but native
divers who operate in the comparatively shallow waters are seldom provided
with diving equipment.
Beche-de-mcr is collected for export, chiefly to China. The edible
turtle is found in Australian waters, and an organization has recently been
established in Western Australia to manufacture turtle soup. Whaling and
seal-hunting are carried on also in Australian waters.

FORESTRY
Australia’s wooded areas have been estimated to cover between 66,000,000
and 92,000,000 acres. Her forest wealth comprises principally hardwoods with
a limited range of cabinet timbers and soft woods. The hardwoods stand
supreme. In strength and durability they surpass British oak, Indian teak,
and the lignum vita; of the West Indies. In weight Australian hardwoods
are often heavier than water. One of them (Yate (Euc. Cornutd)) records a
breaking strain only tons below that of wrought iron of ordinary quality.
As sleepers, they give twenty years of useful work ; as unseasoned telegraph
poles they stand for over a quarter of a century. A life is recorded for two
square hewn piles of seventy-two years, and they were then sound. They
have established themselves for woodpaving in open competition with
concrete and many London streets are paved with Australian blocks. These
hardwoods are the tallest trees in the world, some of them measuring 400
feet in height. These wonder woods are suitably represented in the
forestry section by exhibits which demonstrate the qualities for which they
are famous and the uses for which they are specially suited.
Australian cabinet timbers are remarkable for their handsome figuring.
The visitor may see this for himself in the ornamental timber trophy in the
centre of the Pavilion. All the woods in this trophy were drawn from
Australian forests and are polished in their natural colours, no stains being
used. The trophy was made by A. Pengelly & Co., Adelaide, South
Australia.
The suitability of Australian woods for various classes of manufactures
is also demonstrated. They include furniture, parquetry flooring (Stand
No. 6), wheelwright work, boat building, cooperage, table furnishings, and
sporting goods (Stand No. 31). Among the last named is a cricket bat which
was used by Warwick Armstrong, the captain of the last Australian eleven to
visit England. The willow tree from which this bat was made was grown
from a slip posted to Australia in a sealed tube forty years ago.
Experiments have proved that some Australian timbers are suitable
for the manufacture of paper. A special exhibit demonstrating this has
been prepared bv the Commonwealth Institute of Science and Industry
(Stand No. 31).
Many essential oils obtained from Australian timbers are shown on
Stand No. 31.
AUSTRALIAN HARDWOODS STAND SUPREME


Perhaps the feature in the forestry section which wil] attract most
attention is the panoramic scene of a small Australian bush sawmill
(Stand No. 30). Lumber operations are of course conducted on a much
larger scale, many of the lumber mills costing between £lOO,OOO and
£200,000 or even more, and employing between 300 and 500 men.
A partly-felled tree to the right illustrates the method of cutting. The
fallen logs are cut into lengths, by cross-cut saw. The lengths are then
picked up by the whim (seen in the right foreground) and carted
to a bush landing. Here they are loaded on to trucks and conveyed to the
mill where they are sawn into marketable lengths, which aie loaded into
trucks and despatched.

HEALTH
(Stand No. 37)
Australia is one of the healthiest countries in the world. Her death-rate
is 9.8 per thousand. She shares with New Zealand the enviable position of
having the lowest death-rate in the world. This low rate is due largely to
the splendid climate, the dry air and the sunshine, the absence of intense
aggregation and overcrowding of population, and the small amount of
extreme poverty. In Australia there are no endemic diseases. The object
of the exhibit is to demonstrate how the health of Australians compares
with that of the inhabitants of other countries, and to illustrate the methods
by which the public health of the Commonwealth is being safeguarded and
improved.
Australia’s public health is founded to a considerable extent upon her
quarantine system which is generally recognised as the finest in the world,
a fact which gives special significance to the models of quarantine stations
and equipment which form an important feature of the exhibit. .

MANUFACTURES
The established policy of the Commonwealth Government is that of
effectively encouraging the development of local industries by means of
protective duties, as well as by the payment of bounties and bonuses.
Contracts are also frequently placed with local manufacturers at prices
higher than those which would have to be paid for imported goods. There
is thus a determination on the part of the Australian people to become more
self-contained and self-supporting, and, by creating and maintaining manu-
facturing industries, to assure a maximum condition of employment.
The statistics of Australian manufactures show that many industries have
now been permanently established on a secure basis both in regard to the
extension of existing industries and the establishment of new ones. In
1909 there were in the Commonwealth 13,197 factories employing 266,661
hands. In 1922 the factories had increased to 18,023, and the number of
employees to 395,425.
The exhibits in the manufactures section will illustrate the great variety
of manufacturing industries established in Australia and the high quality of
Australian workmanship.

MINERALS AND MINING
The importance of the mining industry to Australia may be gathered
from the fact that the value of het mineral production to the end of 1921
was £1,014,000,000. In 1921 it was £19,977,384. Gold was the
chief contributing factor, but coal, silver, lead, copper, and tin (in that order)
also contributed substantially to the total value. The specimens exhibited
testify to the wide variety of Australia’s mineral resources. There is a
considerable portion of the continent which has yet to be systematically
prospected.
GOLD
An exhibit of special interest is the model of a State battery on
Stand No. 23. This is the type of stamp battery that the Government
of Western Australia provides in the various auriferous areas of the State
to assist prospectors in developing the mining areas. The ore is first broken
into a suitable size in a rock-breaker and is then conveved by an elevator to
the thraize bin or hopper from which it is fed, together with a constant
supply of water, into the “ battery box.” Mercury or quicksilver is added
in small quantities to the battery box at regular intervals. The mercury
amalgamates with the gold. Coarse gold so amalgamated is retained in
the box and collected in the form of amalgam when the battery is cleaned.
Any fine gold or amalgam which passes through the discharge screen fitted
to the front of the box is caught on the amalgamated copper plate over
which the pulp flows. About 75% of the gold in the pulp is recovered in
this way. The pulp flows on into the dam and there the sand and slime
are settled out for cyanide treatment, the process used to recover the gold
contained in them. The separated water is pumped back to the head tank,
and from there is re-circulated through the plant.
On Stand No. 29 a number of gold specimens and models of famous
Australian nuggets are shown.

BASE METALS
(COPPER, ZINC, LEAD, IKON, AND TIN)
The base metal exhibit was organised by a committee of the Australian
Metal Exchange, Melbourne, who had the assistance of the Mines Depart-
ments of the States and many of the large Australian mining companies.
The exhibit is designed to show :
(i; The metals themselves.
(z) The general run of ores from which these metals are derived in the
Commonwealth of Australia.
(3) To indicate by means of flowsheets and specimens the metallurgical
practice employed in the extraction of the metals from the ores.
(4) To display in showcases special exhibits of ores and minerals
characteristic of the mining fields of the Commonwealth.
(5) To indicate by means of spot-maps the more important mines and
mining centres whence the base-metal ores of the Commonwealth
are derived. s*.
(6) To illustrate by means of photographs the mining, milling and
smelting industries of the Commonwealth.
Special attention should be paid to the beautiful and imposing mineral
trophy (Stand No. 17)

AUSTRALIA—THE LAND OF OPPORTUNITY

'£canom/ca//and Clearing
The Trewhella Monkey Winch will clear your timber with less men, at
less cost and in a fraction of the time. It entirely supercedes the old
method of cutting down the tree and digging up the stump by pulling
the tree do'wn and the roots out in one process.
The Trewhella Monkey Winch
is simple to operate, unfailing in result —and only man power is required. One
end of the steel cable is fastened high up in the tree to be felled, another rope
secures the winch to the base of a second tree or stump. By simply working the
lever to and fro the tree is hauled from the ground. With the Monkey Winch
two men can apply a pull of 24 tons. There are no upkeep costs, no delicate
mechanisms to get out of order and nothing required but man-power. Let us send
vou full particulars and proofs of the economy of land clearing bv the Monkey
Winch.

PASTORAL
There are some 82,000,000 sheep and some 12,000,000 beef cattle in
Australia. They represent an annual return to their owners of considerably
more than £70,000,000. The pastoral industry is one, therefore, of great
importance to Australia, and exhibits representative of it are given due
prominence in the Australian Pavilion.
WOOL
The wool exhibit shown on Stands Nos. 32, 40 and 42 has
been drawn from every State and district of the Commonwealth. Never
before has such a fine and wide selection of Australian fleeces been brought
together in such a compact way. Owing to an unfavourable season, a
number of the fleeces are somewhat lighter than usual. Pride of place is
given to the merino fleeces for which Australia is justly famous and which
command the highest prices in the markets of the world. The observant
visitor will note that the fleeces from each State have distinctive features.
The fleeces of Victoria are marked by their length of staple and high-
yielding properties. New South Wales and Queensland, on the whole,
produce fleeces of a finer texture. South Australian fleeces are noted for
their length, strength, and robustness. Western Australia, where con-
siderable improvement has been made during recent years, produces attrac-
tive fleeces of good quality. Tasmania was originally considered the home of
the merino sheep. It was found necessary to produce a more robust sheep>
and fully 70 to 80 per cent, of the Tasmanian flocks are now crossbred.
The fleeces exhibited were contributed by selected growers on behalf of
the industry.

are shown on Stand No. 32. The prices of these sheep range from 1,000
to 3,000 guineas.

Museum and Art Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne, the custodians of
this valuable and irreplaceable collection. The collection was made in
connection with the appraising of the Australian clips which had been,
bought by the British Government. The contract provided for an average
flat rate of per lb., but the value of the fleeces ranged between ad. and,
4Bd. per lb. So far as is known no other country in the world possesses
a complete collection of the types of wool represented in its annua! clip.
The methods by which the fleece is removed from the sheep’s back
will be demonstrated on Stand] No. 33, where a small plant of shearing
machinery has been installed by the Wolseley Sheep Shearing Machine Co.,
Ltd., Birmingham, and where a number of sheep will be shorn daily at
times which may be obtained from the Enquiry Bureau. When inspecting
this exhibit the visitor should remember that the number of sheep shorn
annually in an Australian shed ranges from 5,000 to 150,000, and sheds
provide stands for up to 74 shearers, who each shear about 100 sheep per
eight-hour day. Many shear twice that number according to the class of
sheep and the efficiency of the shearer. The methods of picking-up, skirting,
classing, and baling the fleeces will also be shown.
The visitor should not fail to inspect the handsome and imposing woof
trophy (Stand No. 50), consisting of a ball of scoured wool 16 feet in
diameter, with a girdle of pictures illustrating various phases of the sheep
industry.
Perhaps the most interesting exhibit in this Section is the model
illustrating the organisation of an Australian sheep station, which
Australia may fairly claim her sheep-owners have brought to a state of per-
fection. The model shows the sheep being driven into the drafting yards
where they are drafted with the object of bringing together for shearing
at the same time sheep of the same age and sex, thus facilitating the subse-
quent classing of the wool. The sheep then enter the shed, and are there
handled as shown on Stand No. 33. The fleeces are skirted, classed,
and pressed into bales which are removed, generally in wagons drawn by
horses or bullocks, to the nearest railway station for carriage to the great
wool-stores at the seaboard. The scraps of wool, such as locks and stained
pieces, removed from the fleeces when they are skirted are conveyed
(as shown in the model) to the scour, where they are washed and dried by
a mechanical drier or in the sun. The scoured wool is then baled, branded,
and transported to the seaboard.
The sheep when shorn are pushed through a small door in the side of
the shed down a chute into a counting-out pen, a separate pen being used by

each shearer so that a record may be kept of his tally. The sheep are period-
ically removed from these pens, passing through a race in which they are
branded. They are then passed through the “ dip,” where immersion in a
disinfectant kills the ticks or other parasites with which they may be infested.
They then return to their pastures to graze and grow more wool.
In the right foreground is the shearers’ hut which usually contains a few
rooms with wire stretchers and a mess room. Behind to the right is the
overseer’s cottage where the wool-classer, the machine expert, and the
“ Boss of the Boards ” also reside while shearing is in progress. At the
back of the overseer’s cottage is the stockyard where young horses are
handled, as shown in the model. Other features typical of station life are
the dam sinking (right), fence erecting (left), and the windmill pumping
water from the creek to the shed, scour, and dip. The homestead is shown,
in the background on the right.
CATTLE
A strikingly beautiful panoramic scene will be found at Stand No. 35..
It shows a mob of cattle camped for the night, during a long overland
journey to market or to fresh pastures. The stockmen have lit huge bon-
fires round the mob to prevent the beasts from panicking and stampeding,
and are yarning round the camp fire enjoying a well-earned rest which their
intelligent canine assistants share. The clothing worn by the men, their
saddlery, and camp equipment were specially collected on one of the large
stations in the interior of Queensland, and the scene is a faithful represen-
tation of the Australian stockman and his life.
FROZEN MEAT

POULTRY AND EGG
PRODUCTION
Poultry and egg production is a minor farming industry that is rapidly
growing in importance in Australia. From small beginnings it has been
extended until, in the 1921-22 season, the annual value of the industry was
£9,022,796. Climatic and other conditions are very favourable to the in-
dustry in Australia. Close attention has been paid to breeding, with such
success that Australian hens hold the world’s record for egg-laying. The
hens which established this record and particulars of their performance are
included in this exhibit. Australia’s exports of frozen poultry are rapidly
growing.

(Stand No. 26.)
Australian Scenery has a charm and beauty of its own. It is of infinite
variety. But the majority of visitors and Australians delight most in the
fern gullies, with their fronded vegetation and towering gums, such as the
one pictured in this panoramic scene (Stand No. 26). Not the least of
such a gully’s charm is in the native animals and birds it shelters and which
reveal themselves to the patient and quiet observer. Australia is the home
of many strange and unique forms of fauna —the kangaroo and wallaby, the
sleepy, leaf-eating native bear, the brush-tongued, honey-eating birds, the
bower bird that builds playing grounds decorated with bones, shells
and flowers, the kookaburra whose laugh rings through the bush.' Some of
these strange animals and birds (prepared by the Western Australian
Museum, Perth) are shown in this typical Australian scene.

ment owned and operated. The main inter-State line (Perth to Brisbane,
via Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney) has a total length of 3,479 miles. In
the cities, the railway service is supplemented by trams and motor buses.
A number of airways have been organised and are working satisfactorily.
The various exhibits on Stand No. 7 will illustrate the transport facilities

TROPICAL
More than 1,000,000 square miles of the Continent of Australia, or a
territory more than eight times the size of the British Isles, lie within
the tropical zone. It is neither infested with disease nor menaced by
wild animals. It is essentially a white man’s country. It is already
the home of thousands of prosperous farmers of British descent. From
the standpoint of health the Australian tropics do not differ materially
from the remainder of this great and rich possession. Queensland, the
State with a large tropical area, has a lower death-rate than three of the
southern States.
Some of the tropical industries, such as sugar-cane and cotton growing,
are referred to separately in the Agriculture Section of this Catalogue.
Pearling is dealt with in the Fisheries Section. But the exhibits in those
sections have been drawn upon for the tropica' trophy (Stand No. 21).
The following (not catalogued elsewhere) have also contributed tropical
products :

WINES AND BRANDY
Australia has aptly been named “ John Bull’s Vineyard.” Her Viti-
culturists produce a great variety of wines of the finest quality —sweet and
dry, heavy and light and sparkling—wines to suit all tastes. The best
known in England is the full bodied, dry red or burgundy type. No other
country produces wines approaching the fulness of the Australian burgundy.
Australian white wines of excellence are also finding favour with British con-
sumers. Of late years Australia has exported an average of 800,000 gallons
annually. The industry is capable of extension to any degree to which the
overseas outlet for the surplus can be developed. No Australian industry
hopes for greater results from the British Empire Exhibition than the
wine industry.
Stand No. 3 has been placed at the disposal of the Federal Viticultmal
Council of Australia. The Council is providing a special display of Aus-
tralian wines, and will have representatives at the stand to supply information
and book orders.
A panoramic scene of an Australian vineyard has been arranged on
Stand No. 4. It shows the lines on which a vineyard is laid out. On the
left-hand side may be seen the drying sheds and the trays on which the
grapes are collected.
An interesting exhibit on Stand No. 5 is a vine of the Alexandria
muscat variety, which eighty years ago was sent from Europe to Australia
by sailing ship, and helped to found the wine industry in the Antipodes.
It has borne fruit annually, and was systematically pruned from 1841 to
1921 when it was found necessary to uproot it to make room for an extension
of the cellars at the Stonyfell Vineyard where it was growing, and it was
then presented to Messrs. P. B. Burgoyne & Coy. by Mr. R. Martin.
