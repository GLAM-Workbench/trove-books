FOREWORD
IN this publication we celebrate the Jubilee of the Royal Art Society
of New South Wales. Looking back over the fifty years of its life and
progress, one cannot help a feeling of admiration for the energy and
perseverance and the remarkable optimism of its founders and the early
members, working under almost insuperable difficulties. Without their
work as pioneers our present high standard of Ajt would have been
well-nigh impossible. Since its inception the Royal Art Society has held
fifty important exhibitions and many smaller exhibitions for the purpose
of placing before the Australian Public the best work produced by the
Painters of our own country. Without the adventitious aid of borrowed
works, we have stood upon our own merits and endeavoured to foster an
Australian spirit and emulation in the world of Art. As the Old Dutch
School fostered its Art we have tried to educate the public to stand for the
advancement of our own National Work. Art knows no country, but art
has never existed in any country without a National Spirit, emulation
and public encouragement. We hope the time has now gone when the
daughter of the house could sit down to play on a grand piano that cost
300 guineas looking at a print that cost eighteen pence and dear at the
price. In many of the best houses of the present day good pictures form
an important part of the beauty of the home. The Royal Ajt Society Press
in publishing this book also wishes to state that other publications on
matters of interest with regard to Australian Art and Art Matters, are
under consideration.

Fifty Years of Australian Art
By GEORGE GALWAY
IN the Exhibition of which this volume is a memento, the Royal
Art Society of New South Wales is celebrating its Jubilee —50 years
of art in Australia. The Society was established just about 50 years
ago in Sydney, and may rightly be regarded as the cradle of Art
in New South Wales.
Fifty years ago Australian art, by Australian artists, was almost non-
existent. What there was of it may be described as a poorly-nourished
infant, crying for a little of the milk of human kindness, and attracting
no more attention than was bestowed on the poet or the novelist or the
street juggler of those early days. Very few people believed in an art
future for Australia. Australian pictures were painted by English and
other imported artists, and the exhibitions held at the time reflected
the methods of those men. The paintings may have been Australian in
subject, but they were English in treatment and in sentiment.
In those days artists who were fortunate enough to enlist the favour of a
prominent shopkeeper had their pictures exposed for sale in shop
windows, ticketed with the price like any other article of merchandise.
But it is safe to say that Louis Buvelot or Conrad Martens, both imported
artists, who came here in the very early days, found but a poor market
for their art.
ART SOCIETY FOUNDED
Into a welter of badly directed and poorly trained art the bold founders
of the Royal Art Society of New South Wales flung their energies, hoping
to better things both for art and the artists. In July, 1880, a little coterie
of artists, headed by Arthur and George Collingridge, took their courage
in both hands and established the Art Society of New South Wales.
Prior to that the only recognised Art Society for the exhibition and sale
of pictures in Sydney was the New South Wales Academy of Arts. The
new society was full of “ pep,” however, and soon took the wind out of
the sails of the other organisation.
The first exhibition of work was held in the Garden Palace in 1880, when
220 oil and watercolor paintings and drawings were hung, besides 8
loan pictures. Among the exhibitors were W. C. Piguenit, A. and G.
Collingridge, J. Gibb, John Gully, J. C. Hoyt, James Dalgarno and
Louis Frank. Altogether there were 51 artists exhibiting, and in the major-
ity of cases they asked as much for their pictures as the average exhibitor
does to-day. The top of the market was reached by Mrs. Alfred Williams,
whose picture, “ Ophelia ” was priced at £75. Piguenit, who was un-
doubtedly the genius of that collection, was more modest. His highest
oil was 26 guineas. Louis Frank had two paintings each marked £SO.


The Society started off with a list of working members totalling 88, in
addition to which there were 50 honorary and subscribing members.
An art union was run in connection with the exhibition, but more im-
portant from the standpoint of the advancement of art was the establish-
ment of a life class. That was a move in the right direction and supplied
some justification for the Society’s announcement that its intention was
to lay the foundation of an “ Australian School of Painting.”
The first President of the Society was Mr. J. C. Hoyt; the Vice-Presi-
dent, Mr. George Collingridge, and the Secretary and Treasurer, Mr.
E. W. Minchen. The Council consisted of Messrs. J. O. Burgess, J. H.
Carse, A. Collingridge, A. L. Jackson, T. Phillips, G. Podmore, J. T.
Richardson, W. C. Piguenit and Percy Williams.
HOLOCAUST OF ART
Disaster overtook the young Society early in its career. The whole of the
pictures sent in for the exhibition to be held in 1882 were destroyed in
the unfortunate fire that gutted the Garden Palace on September 22nd.
The show was to have been held in the following month. Such a calamity
bade fair to paralyse the Society for some time to come. But fortunately
an insurance had been effected over the pictures, and the insurance
company paid over a cheque for £3,000. That money was distributed
among the artists whose pictures were burnt, at the rate of 15 /i in the £
on the amount of their claims, the total of which reached £3 $73/10/-.
A black and white exhibition was held in the vestibule of the Town Hall
on March 17,1883, at which a prize of £lO/10/-was awarded to Monsieur
Henry of Sydney for the best picture in oil and watercolours. A similar
prize was won by Julian Ashton for the best black and white drawing
of a head, and another prize of £lO/10/- for the best black and white
drawing of an Australian tree was divided between J. Mather and W. C.
Piguenit. A total of 2921 persons attended the Show, and the takings
were £146/1/6.
It is just as well to remember that one is writing of 48 years ago when
setting down the seemingly amazing statement that when the Society
decided to have a presentation picture to subscribers to the art union
reproduced, the work had to be sent to London or Paris. Twenty-three
competitive designs were received, and the judges selected G. R. Ashton’s
“The Prodigal” (a reproduction of which is to be seen on page 102 of this
book) which was on view at the March Show of 1883. George R. Ashton,
now resident in London, is a brother of Julian Ashton.
Having arranged to send abroad for the reproductions, the Committee
had some misgivings as to whether they would be out in time for the
art union. Therefore it was further decided to purchase Piguenit’s picture
“ Mount Kosciusko ” and “ The Valley of the Upper Murray ” which was
considered to be of such merit that it was purchased for 25 guineas to be
reproduced by photography for the next art union.
EARLY EXHIBITORS
It is to be doubted whether purchasers at that time could be found to


pay the prices with which the majority of those early paintings were
catalogued—£so, £75 and even £lO5 —but the art union throws light
on the question. In 1883 the catalogues began to be illustrated with pen-
and-ink reproductions of works in the show. George Ashton became an
exhibitor in 1883. John Mather, a Scotch artist who had settled in Melbourne,
sent several paintings to the same year’s exhibition, and the name of
Frank Mahoney appears as the exhibitor of a portrait of the racehorse
Darebin, winner of the Melbourne Derby of 1881. In 1884 Mahoney
again exhibited, this time his picture being a head of the racehorse
Le Grand “painted from life.” Henry Fullwood, Julian Ashton, W.
Macleod, F. B. Schell and B. E. Minns also became exhibitors in 1884.
Fullwood’s contribution was entitled “ Morning ” a sketch from nature
and was priced at ten guineas. “A sketch from Nature ” and “ painted
from life ” were rather eloquent comments on the class of work sent
in to those early shows.
By that time the Society had secured rooms in the Royal Arcade, Pitt
Street, where the life class met twice a week. Mr. Edward Combes,
C.M.G., M.P., was President, and Mr. J. W. Sayer, Secretary. John Ford
Paterson, another Scotch artist of talent became an exhibitor with the
Society. His painting “ Fernshaw ” was priced at 100 guineas. A. J.
Daplyn, who afterwards became associated with art in Sydney as a teacher,
and published a text-book on “ Landscape Painting in Australia ” was
an exhibitor with the Society in 1883 and following years.
The late William Macleod, whose death occurred recently, was an early
supporter of the Society. He became a member of the Committee in
1881 and served again in 1891. Mr. Macleod was a portrait painter of
talent. He followed the traditions of the old British school. His name
should always occupy an honored position in the history of the art of
Australia, for he was ever willing to help the struggling artist, and he did
more in that direction than is ever likely to come to light.
Livingstone Hopkins “ Hop ” joined the Society in 1886, was elected a
Member of the Committee, and exhibited a picture called “An Aus-
tralian Lagoon ” in the following year, when the Society held its first
show in its new rooms, 70 Pitt Street. In the same year, Phil May, the
afterwards world-famous Black-and-White Artist was elected to the
Committee of the Society.
THE BRIGHTER DAWN
Although Australian art made but slow and indifferent progress prior
to 1880, once the proper spirit was awakened in the land, enthusiasm
was aroused, and exhibitions becoming more frequent, emulation was
engendered among the young people who had poetry in their souls and
imagery in their mind’s eye. In 1880 there was a tendency among the
older artists who had received their tuition in England and Paris to see
Australian scenery through European eyes, and when they painted
figure subjects to affect the sentimental style of the London Christmas
Supplement. Very soon, however, thanks to the energies that had been
aroused in the capital city, a broader and a saner outlook was vouchsafed


to those who were blessed with a little of the divine afflatus, and gradually
the nucleus of an Australian school of painting was evolved.
One by one the strong young birds in the art nest felt their wings and
began to soar. Cramped in their Australian environment, far from the
great art centres of the world, they were impatient to get away to the
distant fields that seemed so green. And so, one after another, the most
promising students found their way to London and Paris.
John Longstaff, winner of the First Travelling Scholarship awarded by the
Melbourne Gallery Schools, startled the art world of Australia, as a student
—by the excellent work he put into his diploma painting, “ Breaking
the News.” It was certainly a remarkable work for a student. He went
to England and remained there for many years, devoting his talent to
portrait painting, in which branch of art he stands in the front rank
and has won for himself the honour of knighthood.
TWO PERSONALITIES
Julian Ashton was elected a member of the Committee of the Art Society
of New South Wales in 1885 and became President in 1887. In the same
year he was appointed director of the art classes established in connection
with the Society, with the late A. J. Daplyn as instructor.
About that time W. Lister Lister made his appearance on the scene.
He was a Member of the Committee of the Society in 1889, and was
elected President in 1897. Mr. Lister was the same untiring worker in
those early years as he has continued to be up to the present time. He
was a pure watercolor painter—most of the leading men at that time
were using body color. His first exhibits were the usual English scenes
popular in those days, but it was not long before he got into the stride
of Australian atmosphere and color, and devoted a good deal of his
attention to the study of the Australian Bush with its magnificent gum
trees and the rocky foreshores of the Australian Coast of which “ The
Ever Restless Sea,” in the N.S.W. National Art Gallery, is a striking
example. Since Mr. Lister joined the Art Society in 1889, his interest
in it has never waned.
Tom Roberts was one of those who had been to France and had returned
full of French ideas on art and the practice of it. He visited Sydney in
1897, being interested in the progress of the Art Society of New South
Wales, where he met Charles Conder, then a pupil of that Society, and
whose picture “ Low Tide on the Hawkesbury River ” was in that
year’s exhibition. Conder had a wonderfully sensitive eye for color,
and his taste in decoration eventually led him to adopt the art of fan-
painting when he became domiciled in Paris after leaving Australia.
In 1888, Tom Roberts, Charles Conder, and Arthur Streeton established
the famous camp at Eaglemont, overlooking the Valley of the Yarra,
which is shown in Streeton’s picture, “ Still Glides the Stream,” now
in the Sydney Gallery. That picturesque bit of country has been the haunt
of artists since the days of Louis Buvelot. Arthur Streeton sent his oil
painting “ Fire’s On ” to the 1893 exhibition in Sydney, and it was pur-


chased by the National Gallery Trustees, after which Streeton and
Roberts settled in Sydney.
What Streeton and his fellow artists produced in those days was sneered
at by the critics and art connoisseurs as “ impressionist stuff ” a cranky
freak of the moment, and it was difficult to sell. To get over their finan-
cial troubles the little band of artists hit upon a daring scheme. They
arranged what they called a “9 x 5 ” exhibition. The size corresponded
to that of a certain kind of cigar box lid, on which most of the pictures
were painted. They were nearly all in schemes of yellow, blue, and
purple, and were painted in a higher key than that to which the public
had been accustomed. But there were those who recognised talent,
and saw that behind the apparent show of affectation there was good
drawing and a realisation of the Australian atmosphere.
By this time the seed that had been sown by the Art Society of New
South Wales was bearing fruit and a number of the artists whose names
are known in art circles on both sides of the world received their first
tuition in the classes established by the Society: Charles Conder, George
Lambert, A.R.A., Syd. Long, A.R.E., Frank Mahony, H. S. Hopwood,
B. E. Minns, Albert Hanson, Percy Spence, Arthur Burgess, Charles
Bryant, R. 0.1., and others who have since made good.
In 1892, Alfred Coffey won the first President’s Prize and also prizes
in every section taught by the Society. In 1893, Syd Long carried off the
President’s Prize, he having won second prize in the Life Class and the
Painting Class, the first prizes in both of which were captured by J. S.
Watkins. In the following year nearly all the prizes were carried off by
Joe Wolinski.
George Lambert won the Wynne Art Prize in 1899 with his painting,
“Across the Black Soil Plains,” now in the Sydney National Gallery.
In the following year he won the Travelling Scholarship and went home
for further study: Joe Wolinski being the runner-up, and as a consolation,
Wolinski’s picture was purchased by the National Gallery. Frank
Mahony received his art education in the Art Society’s classes, of which
he afterwards became instructor.
Just as Lambert’s early work marked him out for distinction on account
of the accuracy of its drawing, so Syd. Long, as a student, attracted at-
tention for the idealism, the emotional feeling, and the decorative quality
of his studies. An early picture of his “ Fleur de Lys ” exhibited at the
Art Society’s show, foreshadowed the gifts of design, form and colour
which the young student was afterwards to exploit to such artistic ad-
vantage. Other artists who have distinguished themselves after receiving
tuition at the Society’s classes in these earlier years, are: J. S. Watkins,
Alfred Coffey, C. E. S. Tindall, Harry Garlick, Howard Ashton, Gerald
Fitzgerald, D. G. Reid, J. Salvana, who are all represented in the National
Gallery.
Among other exhibitors at the Society’s Shows in the first decade of its
existence whose names became well known owing to the excellence of
their work may be mentioned: Tom Roberts, Phil May, R. Atkinson,


Gordon Coutts, G. Nerli, Alice Muskett, Ethel Stephens, Madame Roth,
G. Walton, D. H. Souter, Edith E. Cusack, Mary Stodart, J. A. Bennett,
C. H. Hunt, W. B. Spong, William Heron, W. T. Smedley, Arthur
Collingridge and George Collingridge, Signor Steffani, Donald Commons,
P. Van der Velden. Some of these names are still to be found figuring
with distinction in the catalogues of the Society.
Other evidence of the solid good the Society was doing for art was
the fact that Mr. Richard Wynne, in 1890, promised to award a prize
of twenty guineas for the best landscape in oils of New South Wales
scenery. In the following year the prize was awarded to W. C. Piguenit.
The value of the prize was subsequently increased, and became an annual
affair. According to the instructions left by Mr. Wynne, the prize has to be
announced at a meeting of the Art Society.
In 1895, a number of artists seceded from the parent society and formed
the Society of Artists. That body rejoined the parent body in 1902 but
again broke away in 1907 and has remained a separate organisation ever
since. This defection was the cause of considerable ill-feeling at the time,
but art has made such rapid progress during the last 20 years that the
formation of a second society has proved a good thing, as there is now
plenty of room for it and others beside. This is shown by the fact that at
the present time, in Sydney alone, there are eight societies actively en-
gaged in the furtherance of art.
Mr. A. Dattilo-Rubbo, who arrived in Australia in 1897 and at once
joined the Art Society, exhibiting figure studies which attracted con-
siderable attention has now the longest record as an art instructor to the
Society. He was first appointed 22 years ago and is still filling the position
in association with Syd. Long, A.R.E.
Norman Lindsay first exhibited with the Art Society about 1902.
In 1904, Hans Heysen exhibited ten pictures at the Art Society’s Ex-
hibition. Bernard Hall was also an exhibitor that year, and so was
Blamire Young, whose work was very different from his idealism
of to-day.
J. J. Hilder was an artist who possessed wonderful sense of colour and
arrangement, and his watercolour technique gave an exquisite quality
to his work. He became an exhibitor at the Art Society in 1912.
In the year 1908, the Trustees of the National Gallery of New South Wales
inaugurated Watercolour Competitions, purchasing the most important
works for £75 each. Amongst the pictures chosen were three by W. Lister
Lister, three by A. Henry Fulwood, two by Julian Ashton, one by Frank
Mahony and one by Albert Hanson.
During the last 20 years a vigorous effort has been made by the National
Art Gallery of New South Wales to secure a representative collection
of pictures by Australian artists. An annual Government vote is expended
in this way, and at present nearly every Australian artist of repute or
promise, and several artists who are Australian by adoption, have paint-
ings, drawings or etchings in the gallery. A similar policy is being pur-


sued by the Trustees of the Art Galleries in Melbourne, Adelaide, Bris-
bane, Perth and Hobart. The largest collection of pictures by Australian
artists is to be found in the Sydney Gallery. That the Trustees bought
any pictures by Australian artists at all in those early days was due to the
exertions of the Royal Art Society, the executive of which was constantly
bringing under the notice of the Trustees the necessity for giving en-
couragement to Australian art instead of spending all the funds available
in the purchase of pictures abroad. It was due to the representations
of the Society that in 1887 the Government vote of £250 a year as a sub-
sidy to the organisation was increased to £SOO.
At the exhibition of Australian Art in London, held at the Grafton Gallery
in 1898, and generously financed by Dame Eadith Walker, 22 of the
Royal Art Society’s pictures were sold for a total of £768. At that ex-
hibition, Mr. Lister’s landscape “ Mount Kembla ” and seascape
“ Passing Showers ” were purchased by Mr. Sedelmeyer, an art dealer
of Paris. The result of the exhibition must be regarded as a general
uplift to Australian art.
ROYAL CHARTER
In the year 1903, the Art Society was honoured by having the title,
“ Royal ” conferred on it by His Majesty, King Edward VII, largely due
to the efforts of the President, W. Lister Lister, who has had an unbroken
record as President since his first election in 1897, and of the Vice Pre-
sident, Arthur Collingridge, one of the founders of the Society.
At the Present time the Royal Art Society has a total membership of 180,
comprising ten Full Members: W. Lister Lister, President; Charles
Bryant, R. 0.1., Vice-President ; J. S. Watkins, Vice-President ; Lawson
Balfour, Alfred Coffey, A. Dattilo-Rubbo, J. R. Jackson, Sir John Longstaff,
Syd. Long, A.R.E., and Charles Wheeler: nine Associate Members:
John Banks, W. A. Bowring, R. 0.1., S. R. Flanagan, T. Freidenson,
E. Langker, C. E. S. Tindall, G. L. Trindall, J. Salvana, Frank Lynch and
D. G. Reid, and 161 Ordinary Members. The Hon. Secretary, Mr. E. H.
Oxnard Smith, and the Hon. Treasurer, Mr. G. W. Hadfield, have held
those positions since 1903. The Society held its 49th Annual Spring Exhi-
bition in August, 1928, for which 567 works were submitted and 218 accep-
ted. The Classes still constitute a most important feature of the Society’s
work. The attendances at the day and evening sessions are most satis-
factory and amongst the more brilliant students of recent years, are:
N. H. Baker, Evelyn Chapman, Elaine Coghlan, John Richard Flanaghan,
G. W. Finey, Allessie Kane, G. Litchfield, Eric Langker, Raymond
Lindsay, Arthur Murch, R. de Mestre, Percival Norton, D. J. Pratt,
Margaret Preston, Mary Will Slade, Dorothea Toovey, G. K. Towns-
hend, D. S. Wakelin, Pearl Sheldon.
One feature of the Society’s exhibitions must not be overlooked and that
is the Sculpture Section to which the undermentioned artists have at
various times been most important contributors: Percival Ball, W.
Macintosh, Signor Simmonette, D. H. Batchen, G. Macintosh, J. White,


Theo Cowan, Nelson Illingworth, Alan Hutchinson, Christy Wright,
G. W. Hadfield, George Hirst, and Frank Lynch.
During recent years, amongst the more important exhibitors at the Royal
Art Society, nearly all of whom are represented in the National Gallery
of New South Wales, may be mentioned: James R. Jackson, for many
years an instructor in the Society’s Classes, whose brilliant landscapes
have been a feature of the exhibitions.
Lawson Balfour, a distinguished painter, whose treatment of the figure,
in the open air, and portrait work has placed him in the fore front of
Australian painters.
John Banks, a painter of idyllic subjects.
W. A. Bowring, R. 0.1., well known for his fine portrait work.
Charles Wheeler, whose pictures of the nude have lent distinction to
many of the exhibitions.
T. Friedensen the well-known English etcher, now settled in Sydney.
H. S. Power, one of Australia’s finest animal painters.

The glorious colors of nature captured and wondrously re-
created on the screen in your own home. Flowers showing
their true richness and beauty—and similarly the bloom on
youthful cheeks, the glory of the sunset. A miracle ot
science and art!
No words can describe the fascination of Kodacolor. You must go to your
Cine-Kodak dealer and ask him to show you Kodacolor on the screen. He will
do so gladly. At once your imagination will be profoundly stirred—realisation
will come to you of the possibilities of natural color photography that are yours
for the taking.

Over one million Australian Citizens
annually prove the goodness of
HEENZO
The wonderful money-saving family remedy for
COUGHS, COLDS, CROUP
BRONCHITIS, INFLUENZA
COSTS 2/-
SAYES £’s
A two-shilling bottle of concentrated HEENZO, when added
to sweetened water, makes a family supply EQUAL to eight
ordinary-sized bottles (about £i’s worth) of the best ready-
made-up remedies money can buy, for banishing coughs, colds,
croup, bronchitis, influenza, and whooping cough. HEENZO
is equally good for young and old, and does NOT contain anv
poisons; therefore, it can be given to even the youngest baby
without upsetting the digestion. HEENZO should be used
in every 7 home.
Mr. WILLIAM HEUGHAN
Scotland’s Greatest Singer, writes: —
“It might interest you to know that, since my last visit to Australia,
I have travelled over 100,000 miles and have given, in all, 600 recitals.
Thanks to the excellent qualities of your HEENZO, of which I
learnt the value during my first visit to Sydney, I have not missed one
concert through a cold, despite all classes of climatic conditions, from
tropical to frigid, experienced throughout the tour. This, I consider,
speaks volumes for the goodness of HEENZO as a preventive of
chest and throat ailments. mLLIA M HEUGHAN
