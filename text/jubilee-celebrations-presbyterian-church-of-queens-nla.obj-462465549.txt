15 QCI®®3)SLIP)D,
By the Rev. A. Hay, D.D., Rockhampton.
•HE birthday of the Presbyterian
Church of Queensland was the
25th of November, 1863. Pre-
viously to that date there were
Presbyterian congregations in
Brisbane, at Ipswich, Toowoomba, Warwick,
Maryborough, and Rockhampton, whose minis-
ters represented the Established, the Free, or
the United Presbyterian Churches of Scotland,
or the Presbyterian Church of Ireland. Each
of these congregations included in its member-
ship representatives of all these and of other
Home Churches. Twenty years had elapsed
since the disruption of the Church of Scotland.
Acrimonious ftelings had been toned down in
the old country, and the absence in colonial
life of all invidious distinctions founded on
religion, rendered hearty co-operation in re-
ligious work possible, and made Union the
logical complement of that co-operation. This
union was more easily effected in Queensland -
that in some of the other colonies. The
number of ministers and congregations, all told,
did not exceed a dozen, and neither the prestige
nor the inertia of a large body hindered the
movement. The Basis of Union was easily
adjusted. The acceptance of the Confession of
Faith by all the Churches represented, the
identity of their polity, and the common sense
which deals with practical questions in a prac-
tical way, anticipated and obviated all
difficulties. Yet the Union did not at first
embrace all the congregations referred to above.
Two congregations did not apply for admission
until 1864, and one saw its way to join only in
1866. Those were the days of small things;
and although after the lapse of fifty years there
is still much land to be possessed, which it lies
specially to the hand of the Presbyterian
Church of Queensland to occupy, yet there is
much cause for thankfulness to God and mutual
congratulation for what has been achieved. 1
o
In relation to population, less
may seem to have


been effected for the extension of the Church
than in the Southern Colonies; but that is not
the only test of the quality or efficiency of the
work. The wide extent of Queensland, as com-
pared with New South Wales or Victoria, has
greatly increased the difficulty of extending the
Church. Efforts and energies, which in a
denser population might have accomplished
great results, have in not a few parts of Queens-
land been all but thrown away, so far as growth
is concerned. Still, when the number of con-
gregations now is compared with that of fifty
years ago, there is not awanting good reason
for thankfulness.
Rkv. Walter Ross McLeod, First Minister.
The General Assembly has ever kept before
the Church the prominent duty of extending her
ordinances wherever there has been spiritual
destitution. Perhaps the object of promoting
our own peculiar polity and worship has
not been kept so prominently before the
minds of our people as the importance of
spreading the Gospel of Jesus Christ. De
nominationalism has ever been subordinated
to doctrine, Christ and the salvation of men
have been preached rather than the Church
and her ceremonies. Yet the effort has been


made, and not without some measure of
success, to reach with the ministrations of
the Presbyterian Church the widely spread
groups of our people throughout the Colony ;
and if in the list of our charges there are a
number which are both small and weak, it by
no means follows that their smallness and
weakness is a reproach to the Church. The
reproach, if any, would be all the greater were
there no small or weak charges on our roll.
There is nothing so successful as success, and
the larger Churches will always command the
best supply of preachers both in quantity and
quality. What is wanted by our Church now,
what has always been wanted, is the means
of placing and supporting in our small and
weak charges, and in new fields of opera-'
tion, ministers, whose character as men, whose
First Church.
attainments as scholars, whose ability as
preachers, and whose manners as gentlemen,
shall secure the confidence, the respect, and the
attention of the community around them, and
who shall be able to feel, and be helped to feel,
that in the outposts of the Church they are
doing not only necessary, but noble and
honourable service. If these .Jubilee Celebra-
tions result in deepening the impression of the
truth and the importance of this on the minds
of our people, they will help in due time to
provide the means for its attainment.
In this brief sketch, only the most cursory
view can be taken of the work done by our
Church. It is only of late years that
attention has been definitely and steadily
directed to "the duty of Christianising the


—■■■■■— =
heathen races with which our residence in
Australia has brought us into contact. The
labour of the pioneer in a new land leaves
him but little time to look beyond the limits
of his own clearing. But in the provi-
dence of God the attention of the Church
has been pointedly directed to the aboriginal
heathen within our own borders, and the
imported heathen from beyond them. It is
many years since the Church evinced its
interest in the mission to the kanakas of the
New Hebrides, and chiefly in conjunction with
the provision and the work of the “Dayspring.”
But the introduction of the sugar industry
into Queensland, and the importation of
kanakas for the cultivation of the cane, pro-
vided work for the Church at her own door.
If there have been circumstances connected
with the introduction of South Sea Islanders
into Queensland to be regretted, it is cause for
sincere satisfaction that all the Churches in the
Colony have striven to minimise the evils asso-
ciated with it, and so make the sojourn of the
islanders on the plantations a means of moral
and spiritual good; and it is largely due to the
efforts of our Church that the planters have


so cordially co-operated in the arrangements for
the Christian instruction of their coloured
labourers. fn this good cause not only the
missionaries employed by the Churches, but a
number of private persons have taken an active
and successful part.
Rev. R. Kerr.
The exertions put forth for the civilising and
Christian training of the aborigines of Queens-
land in recent times are in wide contrast to the
manner in which they were treated in the early


days of this Colony, and in previous years in
the Southern Colonies. The policy of exter-
mination has been condemned by the growing
Christian conscience. If it is not yet possible
to treat the Australian native as a full grown
man, he is at least treated as a child in whom
the elements of-future manhood exist, though
still latent. Our Church has taken an honour-
able share in this work. On the shores of the
Gulf, and nearer home, her missionaries and
ministers are labouring to lift the native black-
fellow from his degradation ; and that not
without a most promising measure of success.
The field has been consecrated by one martyr
grave, and no nobler monument could per-
petuate the memory of Ward than the Church
Rev. W. S. Fkackeltox, Ph. D.
that bears his name. The Church in Australia
is irrevocably committed to the great enter-
prise, of which only the beginnings are as yet
visible. It is matter of special gratification
that, in this undertaking, not only the Southern
Churches, but specially the women of our own
Church, are the ardent promoters.
It has ever been our aim to place in our
pulpits men of liberal and wide education,
not only in theology, but in literature, philo-
sophy, and science; and every branch of the
Church has striven to provide the machinery
by means of which this may be accomplished.
Queensland also has put forth efforts in this
direction. Not a few of our young ministers
owe most of their education to the necessarily
limited provision we have been able to make


for the training of young men for the ministry.
Some of these have already done valuable work
for the Church, or are giving good promise
for the future.
The space at our disposal will not allow us to
dwell on other subjects which might appro-
priately be dealt with here —the efforts of the
Church in, and in connection with, Sabbath
schools, and with the social problems of the
day. Nor can we here give either a summary
or an analysis of her contributions for her own
religious work or • for purposes of general
benevolence. In regard to some departments
the data are not available, or if available,
Rkv. W. S. Macqckkn,
so imperfect as to render any attempt vto
give accurate figures nugatory. We are,
probably, not far from the truth if we say that
in the course of its fifty years’ history the
Church has raised among its own members for
Home Mission and Church Extension purposes
the sum of about £5OOO ; while it has received
from the Home Churches, and administered for
the same purpose at least an equal sum. But
to represent the full liberality of our people,
we should have to give the figures for about a
dozen other schemes which the Church has had
in hand for longer or shorter periods. If, for
some of these schemes, considering the wealth


and general prosperity of our people, the
amounts contributed may seem to be small, it
is to be borne in mind that our members
cherish an honourable spirit of independence
in regard to the maintenance of religious
ordinances among themselves. They do not
look to other and perhaps rival churches to
assist them in meeting the ordinary expenses
that are incurred in maintaining public wor-
ship. At the same time, they are second to
none in respect to liberality and assisting
others. Their freedom from religious bigotry
in matters of this kind is acknowledged
on all hands, even by those who grudgingly
Rev. T. Nisbbt.
accord, or altogether deny, to us the status
of a portion of the Church of Christ. That
there is room and need for a large expansion
of this generous and charitable spirit we
candidly admit, and it is to be hoped that
the celebration of the Jubilee will power-
fully stimulate this spirit, and secure as a
direct result the completion of the Jubilee
Fund, and the realisation of the hopes of its
projector and promoters, in the increase and
the increased exertion of the Church’s power
for good.
The Lord hath been mindful of us ; and He
will bless us.

I—Psalm. (G. P. and H. Ps. 100).
All people that on earth do dwell,
Sing to the Lord with cheerful voice.
Him serve with mirth, His praise forth tell,
Come ye before Him and rejoice.
Know that the Lord is God indeed ;
Without our aid He did us make ;
We are His flock, He doth us feed,
And for His sheep He doth us take.
O enter then His gates with praise,
Approach with joy His courts unto :
Praise, laud, and bless His name always,
For it is seemly so to do.
For why ? the Lord our God is good,
His mercy is for ever sure ;
His truth at all times firmly stood,
And shall from age to age endure.
2 Hymn. (C. P. 2; H. 10).
Glory be to God the Father,
Glory be to God the Son,
Glory be to God the Spirit,
Great Jehovah, Three in one
Glory, glory,
While eternal ages run !
Glory to the King of angels,
Glory to the Church’s King,
Glory to the King of nations !
Heaven and earth, your praises bring !
Glory, glory
To the King of Glory bring !
“Glory, blessing, praise eternal !”
Thus the choir of angels sings :
“Honour, riches, power, dominion !”
Thus its praise creation brings.
Glory, glory,
Glory to the King of kings ! Amen.
3-Hymn. (C. P. 179 ; H. 438).
J esus shall reign where’er the sun
Does his successive journeys run ;
His kingdom stretch from shore to shore,
Till moons shall wax and wane no more.
For Him shall endless prayer be made,
And praises throng to crown His head ;
His name, like sweet perfume, shall rise
With every morning sacrifice.
Blessings abound where’er He reigns :
The prisoner leaps to lose his chains ;
The weary find eternal rest;
And all the sons of want are blest.
C.P.” —Church Praise.
H." — Hymnary.
Let every creature rise, and bring
Peculiar honours to our King,
Angels descend with songs again,
And earth repeat the long “ Amen.” Amen,

0 God of Bethel, by whose hand
Thy people still are fed,
Who through this weary pilgrimage
Hast all our fathers led,
Our vows, our prayers, we now present
Before Thy throne of grace ;
God of our fathers, be the God
Of their succeeding race.
Through each perplexing path of life
Our wandering footsteps guide ;
Give us each day our daily bread,
And raiment lit provide.
Oh ! spread Thy covering wings around.
Till all our wanderings cease,
And at our Father’s loved abode
Our souls arrive in peace.
Such blessings from Thy gracious hand
Our humble prayers implore,
And Thou shalt be our chosen God
5 - Hymn. (G. P. 192 ;H. 441).
From Greenland’s icy mountains,
From India’s coral strand,
Where Afric’s sunny fountains
Roll down their golden sand ;
From many an ancient river,
From many a palmy plain,
They call us to deliver
Their land from error’s chain.
Can we, whose souls are lighted
With wisdom from on high,
Can we to men benighted
The lamp of life deny ?
Salvation ! oh, salvation !
The joyful sound proclaim,
Till each remotest nation
Waft, waft, ye winds, His story,
And you, ye waters, roll,
Till, like a sea of glory,
It spreads from pole to pole ;
Till, o’er our ransomed nature, .
The Lamb for sinners slain,
Redeemer, King, Creator,
In bliss returns to reign. Amen,

Onward, Christian soldiers.
Marching as to war,
With the cross of Jesus
Going on before !
Christ, the Royal Master,
Leads against the foe ;
Forward into battle,
See, His banners go !
Onward, Christian soldiers, &c.
Like a mighty army
Moves the Church of God
Brothers, we are treading
Where the saints have trod :
We are not divided ;
All one body we—
One in hope, in doctrine,
One in charity,
Onward, then, ye faithful !
Join our happy throng ;
Blend with ours your voices,
In the triumph-song :
“ Glory, laud, and honour,
Unto Christ the King !”
This, through countless ages,
Men and angels sing. Amen.

Brightly gleams our banner.
Pointing to the sky,
Waving wanderers onward
To their home on high !
Journeying o’er the desert
Gladly thus we pray,
Still with hearts united,
Singing on our way,—
Brightly gleams our banner, &c.
Jesus, Lord and Master,
At Thy sacred feet,
Here, with hearts rejoicing,
See Thy children meet.
Often have we left Thee,
Often gone astray ;
Keep us, mighty Saviour,
In the narrow way.
Brightly gleams our banner, &c.
Pattern of our childhood,
Once Thyself a child.
Make our childhood holy,
Pure, and meek, and mild.
In the hour of danger
Whither can we flee,
Save to Thee, dear Saviour !

8 Hymn. (G . P. 442 ;H. 558),
Jesus, high in glory,
Lend a listening ear ;
When we bow before Thee,
Children’s praises hear.
Though Thou art so holy,
Heaven’s almighty King,
Thou wilt stoop to listen
When Thy praise we sing.
We are little children,
Weak and apt to stray ;
Saviour, guide and keep us
In the heavenly way.
Save us, Lord, from sinning ;
Watch us day by day ;
Help us now to love Thee ;
Take ou*’ sins away. Amen.
According to Thy gracious word,
In meek humility,
This will I do, ray dying Lord,
I will remember Thee.
Thv body, broken for my sake,
My bread from heaven shall be ;
Thy testamental cup I take,
And thus remember Thee.
Gethsemane can I forget ?
Or there Thy conflict see.
Thine agony and bloody sweat,
And not remember Thee ?
Our God, our help in ages past,
Our hope for years to come,
Our shelter from the stormy blast,
And our eternal home !
Under the shadow of Thy throne
Thy saints have dwelt secure ;
Sufficient is Thine arm alone,
And our defence is sure.
Before the hills in order stood,
Or earth received her frame.
From everlasting Thou art God,
To endless years the same.

The Church’s one foundation
Is Jesus Christ her Lord ;

To be His holy bride ;
With His own blood He bought her,
And for her life He died.
Elect from every nation,
Yet one o’er all the earth,
Her charter of salvation
One Lord, one faith, one birth ;
One holy name she blesses,
Partakes one holy food,
And to one hope she presses,
With every grace endued.

Though with a scornful wonder
Men see her sore opprest,
By schisms rent asunder,
By heresies distrest;
Yet saints their watch are keeping,
Their cry goes up, “ How long ?”
And soon the night of weeping
Shall be the morn of song. Amen.
