Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Bill.
Senator MILLED (New South Wales
?Vice-President of the Executive Coun-
cil) [3.18]. ?I move ?
That this Bill be now read a second time.
What Repatriation Means.
Its purpose is to make provision for the
repatriation of soldiers. I will say hut
little as to the measure itself, inasmuch
as it is a machinery Bill, winch is de-
signed to create the organization for this
important work, and one which will con-
vey the necessary power to the autho-
rities to be created. It is a measure
which will lend itself to discussion more
at the Committee stage of our proceed-
ings than at the present stage. There-
fore, I propose to address myself not so
much to the Bill as to the scheme which
it is hoped it will he possible to launch
upon the passing of this measure. In
commencing, I am conscious of a sense of
responsibility in attempting to deal with
a problem the magnitude and complexity
of which is admitted. I can only express
the hope that in putting this matter for-
ward in the way I am doing, and in in-
viting consideration to the proposals
which we intend to submit, there will he
no reluctance on the part of persons here
and elsewhere .to make any suggestions
for its improvement which may occur to
them.
Repatriation, as we understand it, is
an entirely new proposition, and, seeing
that war is as old as humanity itself, it
is perhaps strange that this is so. But,
though it has been said that the war is in
>me sense a failure of civilization, we
can yet see through it some of the
triumphs of peace. The conception-of
repatriation as a national obligation re-
peals a new conception of public duty.
When we remember that, and when we
also recollect the splendid efforts which
have been made to carry comforts to our
troops and aid to the wounded?efforls
going right up to th� fighting line?we
shall see that through this war is being
revealed that humane and civilizing pro-
cess which quietly and unostentatiously,
but nevertheless surely, marked that long
peace which was so rudely broken in
August, 1914, Now, although much un-
related private effort has been made in
many of the Allied countries, it is unques-
tionably true that up to the present no
comprehensive scheme for the repatria-
tion of returned soldiers has yet been
submitted by any Government anywhere.
Australia has on more than one occasion
given a lead to the world. It may per-
haps be regarded as a cause of satisfac-
tion that it is doing so in connexion with
the repatriation of its soldiers.
It is first of all necessary to arrive at
a clear conception of what we mean when
we use the word ? repatriation.?? Very
many sincere and emphatic promises have
been made to our troops, but they have
been vague and indefinite to a degree.
These, perhaps, expressed the state of
our feelings rather than a clear line of
action. It is necessary, therefore, that
we should plainly set out what it is that
we contemplate and what it is that we
intend. In my view?and I venture the
opinion in all humility?when we speak of
repatriation we mean an organized effort
on the part of the community to look after
those who have suffered either from
wounds or illness as the result of the war,
and who stand in need of such care and
attention. We mean that there should
be a sympathetic effort to reinstate in
civil life all those who are capable of
such reinstatement. That is what we in-
tend when we use the word ? repatria-
tion.? The nation put forward an
organized effort to enroll these men in
the ranks of the fighting army, and there
must be an equally organized effort to
secure their return to that civil life which
at the call of duty they temporarily
abandoned.
Repatriation is not, or ought not to be,
a mere money-scattering proposition.
Money will be required, and much of it;
but that money ought to be spent only as
a means to the end we have in view. If


any other principle is observed, it will
not only not help the soldiers, but tend
to defeat the very object we have in
mind. Although underlying any scheme
of repatriation is primarily a sense of our
responsibility to our soldiers, it is as well
to recognise also that there is an economic
side to the problem. If 250,000 men re-
main unnecessarily idle for one week only,
there is a loss represented by their wage-
earning capacity of anything between
�600,000 and �700,000. It is as well to
remember, in view of the heavy financial
responsibility which will be involved in
consequence of this measure, that when
we help our soldiers we shall to a large
extent be helping ourselves, and by so
doing fit this country the better to carry
that great burden of debt which will un-
doubtedly fall upon it as a legacy from
the war.
Government Accepts Responsibility.
When repatriation first commenced to
claim public attention, it was in the form
of a voluntary movement instigated by a
number of patriotically disposed gentle-
men acting in a private capacity, and, as
a result of that initial movement, it was
perhaps only natural that it should be re-
garded as a fit subject for private con-
trol, The existing Repatriation Fund was
launched as a fund the conception of
which was that it was to be raised by
private contributions supplemented by
Government grants. It is necessary not
only to revise but to reverse that con-
ception, A wider, clearer view of the
problem demonstrates that it is bigger
and more complex, and that it will he
more costly, than originally anticipated.
I think there is now a general belief that
to insure the satisfactory solution of the
problem it cannot be left to undirected
and unco-ordinated private effort. No
matter how earnest and determined that
effort may be, it must necessarily lack
uniformity and continuity. It is no re-
flection upon those who have originated
and administered that private effort ?in
fact, it is a very poor recognition of
what they have done?to say that they
have mad� out of that system the best of
which it was possible, and that the sys-
tem itself was at fault rather than that
there was any failure on the part of the
men who attempted to work it.
I confidently believe that there will be
throughout Australia a general indorse-
ment of the declaration which I now
make,' that the nature, extent, and dura-
tion of the work of repatriation require
it to be accepted as a national responsi-
bility, to insure the proper discharge of
which must involve the direct action of
the National Government itself. This
Government accepts that responsibility,
and I believe its doing so will commam
parliamentary and public approval. But
if the Government is to be responsible,
it must have control over those agencies
and activities by means of which the
work is carried through. No Govern-
ment can possibly be asked to carry the
responsibility if the work is to be carriec
out by a number of unco-ordinated pri-
vate committees or organizations. It
must have an organization which it can
direct, which will move to a predeter-
mined plan, and which will be responsive
to its control. But this does not imply oi
call for the shutting out of private volun
tary assistance. With that voluntary as-
sistance making itself manifest in man;
ways and in numerous localities, it woul(
be a stupid blunder if we failed to aval
ourselves of the assistance which so man;
people are able and willing to render
But that assistance must move as part
of a recognised plan. Unless it does, vti
shall have overlapping in one place, in
sufficiency in another, and confusion am
probably irritation all round. From th<
bringing together or association of thi
private effort with Government activit;
we may hope, too, I think, for that dost
personal touch, and that personal sym
pathy which, properly directed, will (t
very much indeed to insure the smootl
working of any scheme of repatriation
I have endeavoured to co-ordinate the tw�
to devise a system in which there will b
a sufficiency of the official element to i�
sure uniformity, regularity, and co�
tinuity, and as much of private assistant*
as circumstances will permit, and as w
people are willing to render.
The Repatriation Fund.
There is in existence a fund known as tl
Repatriation Fund, initiated, as I ha 1
said, by the efforts of a number of priva
citizens, and placed by legislative enac
ment under the control of a Board 1
Trustees, which Board is still in existent


PrLTp 11 b n n ? 1 t the Bi ! ] bec � mes law - aid extended, but that inequality will be
mounted Z * SSK * h !.> nd d ? ?� sympathy, and /at to the
amounted to �109,355, and to this was
added a grant of �250,000 from the
Commonwealth Parliament. Under the
authority vested in the trustees, they
directed that any funds raised locally for
repatriation purposes should be paid into
that' central fund. The idea was to secure
by centralization uniformity in the aid to
be extended to our returned soldiers.
There were many local movements initi-
ated at that time, designed to raise funds
locally for the aid of local soldiers, but
there was soon manifest a strong disin-
clination to remit these funds, raised
locally for local disbursement, to a central
fund in Melbourne. These local movements
consequently either ceased or diminished
very considerably, but the position is now
altered by the acceptance by the Govern-
ment of responsibility for the financing
of the scheme, and as the Government is
about to take up this responsibility, and
incidentally to provide such money as
may be necessary, it is clear that we can
now safely and advantageously review
the decision previously recorded by the
trustees. The Government will, from
time to time, seek parliamentary appro-
priation of such sums as may be required
to replenish the central fund, and a uni-
form policy will thus be secured, not
uniformity in the amount given to indi-
vidual soldiers, but uniformity as to the
principles upon which the aids and bene-
fits of the Act will be disbursed.
No further appeals will be launched
for private contributions to the Central
Repatriation Fund, but as private citizens
will no longer be solicited to contribute to
that fund, and as the fund will insure a
reasonable response to every soldier?s ap-
plication, there is no further reason, it
seems to me, for placing any further re-
striction on local supplementary effort.
Private citizens, individually or other-
wise, will therefore be quite free to take
such action as they like in furtherance of
tue interests of the soldiers returning to
their particular districts.
Senator Febricks. ?Will that also
a Pply to the separate action of State
Governments ?
Senator MILLEN.?I shall be obliged
*f the honorable senator will leave his
Questions until I have finished. It is
cjuite true that these private supplemen-
tary efforts may lead to inequality in the
action of the Government.- To prohibit
ocal supplementary effort would be to
kill private effort altogether, for it is not
possible to conceive of citizens being will-
ing to contribute to a central fund when
the effect would be merely to relieve the
.treasury, and not in any way to add
to the comforts intended for the soldiers.
These local activities will be allowed a
very wide scope, but they must be under
the control of the local committees to be
created under this Act, they must be for
the benefit generally of all the soldiers of
the district covered, and not for individual
men, and they will have to conform to
regulations as to supervision and audit.
Existing Funds.
I come now to the several existing
patriotic funds. In a sense these funds
also are doing some of the work of
repatriation, and in spit� of possible
mistakes arising from inexperience,
these administering them have, on
he whole, done excellent work and
have done it well, but it is quite
obvious that between such funds and
the larger scheme there must be a
clear Ime of demarcation, a line which
will insure that the activities of these
funds shall abut closely on to the activi-
ties of repatriation proper, but without
any possibility of overlapping. Up to
the present these funds have dealt and
are dealing, in different ways in different
Mates, with both the dependant of the ab-
sent soldier and with the returned soldier
himself, both before and after his dis-
charge. The point at which the present
ac^va^es commence is an
ill-denned and loose one, and is deter-
mined by the circumstances of the indivi-
dual case rather than by any recognised
principle. I propose that ? repatriation
shall commence at the time of the soldier?s
discharge. This will be a considerable
measure of relief to existing private
funds, and it appears to conform more
correctly to wdiat I conceive to be in-
volved in the duty of repatriation. But
relieving these funds in the way indicated
strengthens the belief that, with every
confidence, we can appeal to the public
to sustain and continue these funds de-
signed for the welfare of the soldier and
his dependants prior to the date of his
discharge. This decision establishes a


clearly discernible division of responsi- tion thus disclosed, ihe proceeds of the
bility. It is easily recognised alike by
the soldier himself ?which is all-im-
portant ?by those administering the
funds, and by the repatriation organ-
ization.
Standardizing Private Funds.
Possibly induced by the criticisms which
have been heard regarding the adminis-
tration, suggestions have been made that
the Government should take over and
pool these private funds. lam not con-
vinced that the balance of advantage lies
in that direction, but with a view to cor-
rect some obvious anomalies, to secure
greater uniformity of administration, and
a needed liberalization in certain par-
ticulars, I recently, invited a conference
of representatives of these funds through-
out Australia. At that conference three
principles were approved: First, _ that
the several funds should adopt a uniform
policy 5 second, that there should be a
common collecting agency in each State;
and, third, a recognition of the responsi-
bility resting upon the Commonwealth as
to supervising the administrative costs of?
such funds. In furtherance of the first of
these resolutions, it was decided to adopt,
both with regard to dependants and sol-
diers, the highest scale of benefits at pre-
sent in operation ?that is, that in those
States wherein the scale was lower, it
was agreed to bring it up to the level of
the higher scale prevailing in another
State. This secures uniformity, and, as
the scale is not ungenerous, will, I think,
create a feeling of satisfaction through-
out Australia.
One Collecting Organization.
Speaking generally, the people are
not particularly concerned as to the
special object in connexion with
which their contributions are ex-
pended. They desire only that their
contributions should be judiciously
handled for the soldiers? benefit. But
thev have become a little confused, per-
haps a little worried, by the multiplicity
and variety of appeals presented to them.
Such a collecting organization as I sug-
gest would be able to announce an esti-
mate of probable requirements, and, hav-
ing clearly defined authority behind it,
could venture to appeal with every con-
fidence to the people to meet the obliga-
collection could be disbursed to the vari-
ous funds according to their needs.
It is conceivable ?indeed, ?it is the
case to-day ?that whereas one fund
has ample moneys for present require-
ments, another fund in the same capi-
tal city is falling uncomfortably
low, yet the moneys at the credit of
one fund are not available for the as-
sistance of the other. This anomaly will
be corrected as regards future collections,
though it will not disturb the balance
now in hand. It was also agreed that
the new scale of payments should become
operative as soon as practicable after the
Ist of August.
Registration.
I come now to what I conceive to
be the real work of repatriation,
and which I have previously defined
as being ? the reinstatement of the dis-
charged soldier in civil life. It is first
necessary to insure registration. It is
obviously ess'ential that the repatriation
organization should have not only a com-
plete register of the men on whose be-
half it is required to act, but that it should
have that registration as early as pos-
sible. At the present, registration is
effected after discharge, and in many
cases only when the soldier finds himself
under the necessity of seeking assistance.
The soldier, upon being discharged, finds
himself in possession of money and com-
plete freedom from control for the first
time for a very long period. It may be
regrettable, but it is none the less true,
that in many instances there is a ten-
dency to unduly indulge in the pleasures
of the city. When his resources are ex-
pended?it may be, wasted ?the soldier
presents himself for the first time at the
repatriation office under the necessity too
often of asking for immediate work or im-
mediate relief. It is idle to expect that
under such conditions suitable positions
can always be available at a moment?s
notice; an awkward and possibly dan-
gerous interval ensues. While the re-
patriation authorities are looking for a
suitable opening the man is dependent
upon grants from the amelioration
fund. Much of this delay can, I think-
be avoided by effecting registration prior
to, instead of after, discharge. There is
no difficulty in securing such registration
after the soldier?s return to Australia, but
it is possible that it can be effected before


returns to this country. I see very little would, lam sure, see the wisdom of the
difficulty in securing registration when the
transports are bringing the men out. I
am now looking into the question
of securing registration prior to the
soldier?s departure from England. It
is certainly desirable, in the interests of
the soldiers themselves, that the repatria-
tion authorities should have the earliest
possible notification, both of the numbers
with which they will have to deal and
with the requirements, wishes, and apti-
tudes of the individuals whose welfare is
their concern. lam hopeful that by this
earlier registration very much will be
done to eliminate that period of pre-
judicial idleness and that harassing un-
certainty which marks the present
methods, and which, I believe, is largely
responsible for the facts upon which cer-
tain public complaints have been founded.
Paying Offl
Another change which I hope to see
effected is in the method of paying
off the soldier. At present the man is
paid off at the barracks. He is under no
immediate necessity of going to the re-
patriation office, and is assailed by many
temptations and pitfalls, obviously pre-
pared and designed by the unscrupulous.
I am conferring with the Minister for
Defence to< see if a practical scheme can
be devised by which the final payment can
be made in the building in which the
main repatriation activities will be
carried out. This would insure an oppor-
tunity of getting into immediate touch
with the soldier. If this scheme can be
effected, the Governor of the Common-
wealth Bank has undertaken to open a
branch of his establishment in the same
building. It should be the duty of a
repatriation officer designated for that
purpose to invite the soldier receiving
his final pay to deposit a proportion of his
money in the Bank, beside the portals of
which he would be literally standing, and
'to point out the obvious advantages of. so
doing. Further, it would b� the duty
of such an officer to discuss with the soldier
the latter?s desires and intentions, with a
view to the earliest possible steps being
taken to give effect to the former. It is
quite probable that a percentage of the
men will decline to follow the course in-
dicated, preferring to take the risk of
carrying their money about with them.
But against this there are many men who
suggestion, and act upon it.
Employment.
Registration having been effected,
the repatriation authorities will pro-
ceed to deal with the application, for
such the registration really is. It is
reasonable to assume that with the ma-
jority of the men it will be a question of
obtaining suitable employment. It is
true that up to the present practically all
the men presenting themselves have re-
turned to Australia, either because of in-
juries or illness, but later on it may be
anticipated that by far the larger pro-
portion will be not only fit, but anxious
and desirous, of returning to the occupa-
tions and districts with which they are
familiar. Much has been said as to
teaching new trades, but, although this
will undoubtedly be necessary in many
cases, I submit that it is desirable that
an effort should be made to secure the
speedy absorption of the men in their
previous occupations. Our soldiers are
not like the soldiers of old, men who have
spent the best part of their lives subject
to military training, rendering it a little
difficult to satisfactorily re-establish them
as part of the country?s industrial or-
ganization. Our men are citizens.
Citizens before the war, they will be
equally citizens when they return. They
learned and followed their various call-
ings. They are of all classes, trades; and
professions, and there should, therefore,
be less difficulty in securing their ab-
sorption in civil life, provided no ill-con-
sidered effort is made to divert their ac-
tivities into fresh channels. As a very
essential feature in the work of repatria-
tion, I propose the establishment, in the
central offices of each State, of a Labour
Bureau which will be in constant com-
munication with the various district com-
mittees, to which reference will be made
later on. In this connexion, lam assured
of the hearty co-operation of those States
which have similar agencies for recording
the requirements of the labour market.
I look forward with confidence to the cor-
dial assistance which it is clearly within
the power of employers generally to ex-
tend.
Training of Injured.
What I have just said applies more
particularly to the men who happily


return sound and well. I turn now ment with private employers, under
to those who come back with their
efficiency impaired as the result of
wound or illness. Owing to the nature
of their injuries it will be impossible for
some of these men to follow their pre-
vious occupations. It will be necessary
to give them such training as to fit them
to take up ia new calling to which their
disablement presents no bar, or, at least,
presents only a modified one. The first
provision for such men will be provided
in curative workshops attached to the
hospitals. These shops will impart ele-
mentary training. Their purpose is
threefold. First, all medical opinion
supports the view that the restoration to
health of the injured man is greatly as-
sisted if his mind can be lifted away from
his own injuries, and he can become in-
duced to take a fresh interest in life. It
is natural and understandable that
young men who but a little while ago
were full of the vigour and strength of
youth, with life and all its possibilities
stretching before them, should become
depressed and inclined to be morbid,
when, as a result of physical injuries,
they suddenly find themselves crippled
and called upon to face the future with
impaired faculties. There is a tendency
on the part of many such to regard
themselves as upon life?s scrap-heap. It
is gratifying to know that much can be
done to re-adjust this view and to bring
it into proper perspective; to show the
men that, though nothing can be done
to restore a missing limb, yet in the ma-
jority of cases there is every prospect of
their becoming useful self-supporting
members of the community. These cura-
tive shops will tend to do this. They
help, too, to furnish the man with an
attractive means for exercising injured
limbs, or to become familiar with the use
of artificial ones, and, further, they are
an excellent means of ascertaining the
aptitude of the mian who later on will be
ready for more advanced training. In
conjunction with the Minister for De-
fence, action has been taken to provide
for two of these curative workshops at-
tached to the hospitals in* Sydney and
Melbourne. Two means seem available
for providing that advanced training ; One
is the establishment of special Govern-
ment institutions wherein the men could
be given the necessary training to enable
them to take their place as qualified
workmen; the other, by an arrange-
which the latter would pay in proportion
to the value of the man?s work, the Go-
vernment paying the difference between
that sum and the recognised wage appro-
priate to the particular occupation. There
are many ladvantages in the latter pro-
posal. It can be immediately brought
into operation. It will enable the men
to learn their work under actual trade
conditions, and it will, instead of segre-
gating those who are, because of their
injuries perhaps, disposed to take a
gloomy view of life,, bring them into
close association with the normal work-
men, and thus stimulate their return to
normal citizenship.
Renewal of Interrupted Training.
There is another class for whom training
must be provided. Among those who re-
sponded to their country?s call, many
were apprentices who had not completed
their period of apprenticeship. It is
not to be supposed that in every case it
will be? open to these men to return and
complete their indentures with their old
employers. Yet it is not only demanded
in fairness to the men themselves, but it
is obviously to the interests of the coun-
try, that they should have an oppor-
tunity of finishing their course and be-
coming qualified and skilled workmen.
Many of these men will be three years
older when they return than when they
left these shores. The wages appro-
priate to eighteen years of p,ge cannot be
regarded as sufficient or satisfactory for
twenty-one' years of age, and an effort
must be made, not only to provide facili-
ties for such men to complete their tui-
tion, but the country must accept the
responsibility of supplementing their
wages to enable them to do so. Some
of these men may be provided for at
technical colleges and similar institutions,
but the resources of such establishments
are limited. lam hopeful, also, of a mea-
sure of assistance from existing -Govern-
ment workshops and factories. If the pro-
jected Government ship-building enter-
prise is launched, I anticipate such estab-
lishments as Cockatoo will render very
material assistance in this regard.
But outside such opportunities I pro-
pose, as in the case of the disabled,
that an arrangement should be made with
private firms to take over and complete the
interrupted indentures,the Commonwealth


ibsidizing the wages as may b� necessary, made.
these avenues are insufficient, it will be
jessary to provide special training estab-
iments.
Possible Objections.
Now, some objections may be anti-
cipated. It is obviously useless to
teach a man a trade unless, having
learned it, he is in a position, as a result
of such tuition, to secure employment later
on. There will be cases in which a man?s
capacity has been permanently impaired.
Such a man can never be worth, owing to
his incapacity, the full wage paid to a nor-
mal workman, but it would be foolish in
the extreme to decree that, because he
could not earn the full wage, he should
be prohibited from earning, say, three
parts of it. Employers, however, could
not be expected to indefinitely pay,
&ay, �3 10s. to a man who was only
earning �2 10s. Yet such a man
would probably be in receipt of a pen-
sion of �1 per week. He cannot pos-
sibly live upon that pension, yeti he can
earn sufficient to so supplement that pen-
sion as to obtain a livelihood. Apart from
the money aspect of the matter, it would
be an injury to the man himself to con-
demn him to idleness, while such idleness
would also involve an economic loss to the
community. I propose to confer with the
industrial unions and with employers with
the view to arriving at an understanding
as to the employment of such men.
The Permanently Incapacitated.
So far I have referred to the uninjured
or to those whose disablements are such as
to still permit of their entering upon some
occupation. I turn now to those whose
condition calls for and will receive our
deepest sympathy. I refer to the totally
This term requires defini-
tion. As interpreted under the Pensions
Act, ? totally incapacitated ? means men
ybo have been allotted a full pension, and
includes, therefore, both those whose
though serious, still leave them
capable of following some occupation,
a nd those who are without hope in this
Aspect. No one will begrudge the former
the pension they are receiving; but, as
re gards the latter, it is quite obvious that
Jdhs pension will not, in a number of cases,
, e sufficient for those who are totally and
helpless. Some of these men
Jfll require constant care and attention,
"or them, special provision will have to be
I propose to meet such cases in
two ways: First, by the establishment of
hostels or homes in suitable localities,
where those who elect to become inmates
can satisfactorily, and, I hope, sympa-
thetically, be looked after. In such cases,
a reasonable deduction would be made
from the pension. In the case of those
who, having homes to go to, or friends
able and willing to look after them, and
who would, therefore, prefer to remain
outside such hostels, I propose that, at the
discretion of the repatriation authority,
there should be granted a special allowance
up to 10s. per week to meet the necessities
of the case.
There is another class which also makes
special demands upon our consideration,
and for whose care and welfare extra pro-
vision must be made, namely, those who
have developed tubercular complaints. Al-
though the Red Cross Society, in pursu-
ance of its noble work, has don� much to
provide for such cases, it is obvious that
some more extensive and more perma-
nent provision is needed to meet both
existing and probable circumstances. It
is proposed, therefore, to establish sana-
toria for the reception of the discharged
soldier, and also of those cases' wherein
the 'disease may later on develop or re-
assert itself. Where establishments exist
and accommodation is available it is ob-
viously advisable to utilize these as far as
possible, if only to tide over the neces-
sary interval which must interpose be-
tween the present and the erection of
Commonwealth institutions.
It is inevitable that from time to time
discharged soldiers will need medical at-
tention. An agreement by which this
could be provided by local hospitals should
not be difficult of attainment,, and I am
taking the initial steps to this end.
Artificial Limbs.
Under the existing arrangement the
Defence Department equips the maimed
soldier with the necessary artificial limbs.
But it is obvious to honorable senators
that such limbs will require repairs,
maintenance and renewals. This work
will by no means end with the war, but
will be continuous for many years to come.
It is proposed to establish a factory for
the manufacture of limbs, with branches
in the respective States. The major por-
tion of the work can be undertaken by
the central factory, the work of the


branches being confined to that of fitting,
adjusting and repairs. My colleague the
Minister for Defence has already arranged
to secure from America both a supply of
limbs and an expert, whose arrival here
may shortly be expected. Preliminary
negotiations have taken place for this ex-
pert?s services in the establishment and
equipment of the proposed factory, and
the training of the necessary workmen.
Although, as stated, there is a division
of responsibility in this matter, no
culty need be regarded or anticipated on
this account, but obviously the one fac-
tory can supply both the original and
the renewed limb.
Miscellaneous.
There are many other directions in
which, as part of the complete scheme of
repatriation, the Commonwealth must
prepare to help. I need not?indeed, it is
impossible to?enumerate all the direc-
tions in which such aids must be extended.
I refer to them merely as an indication
that they are not overlooked.
Land Settlement.
I turn now to one of the bigger
propositions which are involved in re-
patriation, namely, land settlement. This
is big, not only because of the many diffi-
culties associated with ordinary land
settlement, but equally so because of the
very heavy financial responsibility which
it involves. But in considering the finan-
cial side of this question there is one
matter to which I should like to direct
particular attention. It is an accepted
belief in Australia that every effort
should be made- to increase land settle-
ment and the production to which it
leads. The State Governments have for
many years incurred considerable expen-
diture in their efforts to promote such
settlement. Had no war occurred, public
policy would still have required a con-
tinuance of this policy. The cost in-
volved, therefore, ought not to be _ re-
garded as wholly a repatriation obliga-
tion, but as, in part, an expenditure in-
curred in furtherance of that settlement
which would have undoubtedly been pro-
moted quite apalrt from the war. In
other words, a proportion of the money
to be spent under this heading ought to
be regarded as being spent in the coun-
try?s development, and not solely to meet
our obligations to the soldiers.
At a conference held last February
between representatives of the Common-
wealth and the several State Govern-
ments, it was agreed that the States, hav-
ing control of land legislation, possess-
ing Crown lands, having Lands Depart-
ments and land experience, should under-
take to find the land and place the soldier
settler thereon. They could not, how-
ever, see their way to find the advances
necessary to enable any large number of
soldier settlers to effect the improvements
requisite to the satisfactory working of
their holdings. The Commonwealth Go-
vernment undertook, therefore, to make
advances to the States, to be in turn ad-
vanced by them to the settler to enable
the latter to effect improvements, purchase
plants, seed, stock, &c. The limit in any
case was to be �5OO. The advances to the
settler were to be upon favorable terms
as to interest and repayment. The States
undertook the responsibility of paying to
the Commonwealth the interest, and re-
paying the principal of the amount so
advanced. It was further arranged that
a Board representing the several States
and the Commonwealth should meet from
time to time for the purpose of consulta-
tion and advice. Queensland, through its
representatives, intimated its inability to
fall in with the arrangement, and for the
present, therefore, the agreement is
limited to five States. It was also agreed
to establish training farms, the loss on
such to be borne equally by Common-
wealth and States. It is not possible to
make any definite statement as to the
numbers likely to take advantage of the
opportunities for land settlement. But,
obviously, the number will increase or de-
crease as land proposals are attractive or
unattractive. Some time since, cards were
distributed amongst soldiers, both in camp
at Home and abroad, on which they were
invited to state- their wishes as to_ their
future occupation on the termination of
the war. From those replies it would ap-
pear that some 40,000 wish to go upon
the land.
A Huge Sum.
The financial liability which is in-
volved in a proposition to provide farms
and furnish working capital for such a
number, or even a much reduced num-
ber, is serious. Although large areas of
Crown lands are still available in certain


the States, very considerable resump- troducing such an innovation.
ions of private property will be necessary
a others. It is, therefore, difficult to
fate the average amount required per
lolding, but if the present forms of settle-
aent are continued, it may be estimated
it �l,OOO. If to this is added the �5OO
or improvements, &c., then a total of
160,000,000 is involved. This amount,
hough heavy, is certainly not prohibitive
f the scheme contained in itself rea-
onable prospects of success, but there are
erlain features about, the existing forms
if land settlement which render such suc-
ess highly improbable. No man, much
ess a returned soldier, ought to be in-
ited to go on rto a block of land except
inder such conditions as carry with them
he assurance that by steady application
here is a reasonable prospect of success,
hat assurance cannot honestly be given
nth many of the propositions being made
.vailable in the States. Leaving out
hose cases of special men who succeed in
pit� of insurmountable difficulties, deal-
ng with the average man under average
onditions, no practical man will venture
o say that with �5OO for improvements,
>lant, seed, fertilizers, &c., to say
lothing of sustenance and working ex-
penses, men can safely be invited to take
ip the occupation of wheat farming on
he terms now offering. The States now
ecognise this, and at a Conference held
ast week a resolution was passed inviting
he Commonwealth Government to agree
o raise the maximum to �750, without
ncreasing the total sum agreed to be ad-
ranced. This arrangement, if agreed to,
fould help to meet the difficulty so far
is the wheat grower is concerned, but it
pould be at the expense of other settlers,
ps if on� man is to get more than the
average, then another must get less.
The Alternative.
We are, therefore, brought face to
ce with two alternatives. Either the
lount of advance must be increased,
an effort must be made to find
hidings of a class which do not need
o much capital for their development.
a community, we are still largely in-
fenced by the days of broad acres, and
though there has been of late years a
endency towards smaller holdings, it can
lardly be said that Australia has seri-
Usly grappled with the problem of small
ettlements. I submit that the present
s an extremely favorable time for in-
I want
to lay it down as a principle that holdings
designed for soldier seitlers should con-
form to the capital available for their
working. Ihe value of a settler?s own
labour (to the block he occupies is in in-
verse ratio to the size of his holding. The
smaller the holding the more important
relatively is the man?s own labour in de-
veloping it. On a 10-acre block the set-
tler s own labour will, in a comparatively
short time, convert it into a fairly im-
proved property, but the same labour
would pass unnoticed on a farm of 1,00 n
acres. Even if more capital is made
available for the settler, it implies that
he starts with a heavier financial mill-
stone round his neck.
The Small Holding.
Among those wishing to settle upon the
Lind will undoubtedly be many specially
equipped by experience and possessing,
some capital. Eor these the present pro-
posals . will, perhaps, suffice. But if a
genuine effort is to be made to provide for
those of lesser experience and no capital,
and at the same time give a distinct im-
petus to small settlement, then a new
policy must be evolved, not in substitu-
kicm, but as an addition to the existing
proposals.
For the satisfactory settlement of the
class last referred to, there are four
essential conditions?
1. That the holding should be of such a
size that the settler?s own labour is the most
important factor in its development and work-
ing.
2 That the size and character of the holding
shall correspond to the financial resources at
the command of the settler.
3. That the knowledge necessary to work the
Can , be aC( l uired in a short period.
4. that the returns shall be quick.
These four requisites are quite apart
from the suitability of the man himself,
ihis factor attaches equally to all forms
of holdings, but I am now specially deal-
ing with men of limited experience and
no capital beyond that, which the Govern-
ment proposes to supply.
A Guaranteed Market.
There are many small holding indus-
tries suitable to Australia which have
so far not been seriously or system-
atically developed. It is part of the
policy of the Government, indorsed
I believe, by all sections of the


community, to promote the estab-
lishment of new industries and the more
scientific development of existing ones.
This policy can advantageously be ap-
plied to soldier settlement, a d in such a
way as to provide attractive holdings for
returned soldiers and new and more sys-
tematic forms of wealth production for
Australia. As land settlement is under
State jurisdiction, I propose to confer
with State Governments as to certain
projects on the lines indicated, and see no
reason to doubt that they will co-operate.
The underlying idea of these small hold-
ing propositions is that the Government
shall guarantee a market and organize
the handling and sale of the produce.
New Rural Industries.
As an instance of what is proposed, let
me refer to hog-raising. Although pigs
are reared generally throughout Austra-
lia, it cannot be said that there is a hog
industry here in the sense that there is in
America. Yet the conditions are equally
suitable. Pigs are raised here, with only
negligible exception, as an adjunct to
dairy or other forms of farming. There is
indeed a very generally entertained belief
that the pig cannot profitably be reared
apart from the cow. America, where
whole districts are devoted solely to hog
raising as a distinct business, completely
disposes of that contention. In the ab-
sence, however, of local examples the
settler might naturally hesitate before
embarking upon hog raising as his sole
business, and with no export trade at pre-
sent established, he might fear the
consequences of over production. But
if a market were assured, his hesitancy
would largely disappear. Such market
can be assured witffbut undue risk to the
community by providing establishments
for slaughtering and subsequent treat-
ment of the hogs and their disposal either
on the home market or by export, and by
guaranteeing a minimum price to the pro-
ducer. Such factories, when properly es-
tablished, could be handed over as co-
operative concerns to the settlers. The
Government will also make available such
scientific and practical advice as may be
desirable.
Reserve Employment.
In spite of all the efforts which may
be made to secure the speedy re-
instatement in civil life of our returned
soldiers, it is a reasonable assumption that
difficulty will be found and delays occa-
sioned in completing the process. Some-
thing in the nature of reserve employ-
ment is therefore needed to meet such a
contingency. The purpose of this employ-
ment would be to carry a man on until he
either obtains, or the repatriation organi-
zation obtains for him, that more per-
manent occupation which he desires, and
for which he is fitted. Such reserve em-
ployment must be suitable to the vary-
ing capacity and physical strength of the
individuals. It would be an advantage
too, if employment meeting these condi-
tions could be found which would help
the development of our resources, or the
establishment of new industries. Certain
projects are under consideration, but I
desire to refer to two of them. The first,
is forestry. A considerable volume of
labour could be employed in the develop-
ment of an undoubtedly big national
asset. Suitable quarters will need to be
erected for the men, and they will, of
course, bo paid reasonable wages. An-
other and larger undertaking which,
whilst having a distinct and important
bearing on Australian development, can
also, I think, be made a useful adjunct
to the work of repatriation, is the Mur-
ray River scheme. The carrying out of
thjs work is the subject of an agreement
between the three riparian States and the
Commonwealth. I am inquiring to see
how far it may be practicable to provide
a joint employment and settlement
scheme in conjunction with this work.
Pensions.
Under the present Pensions Act, pen-
sions are liable to revision. This, bv
creating a fear in the mind of the re-
cipient that the revision will proceed
downwards in proportion as his efficiency
proceeds upwards, is acting as a distinct
deterrent. It is desirable that the dis-
charged soldier should as speedily as pos-
sible develop the utmost earning capacity.
But there is a disinclination to proceed to
do so when it is seen that under the exist-
ing system the man?s success may be fol-
lowed by a cutting down of the pension.
At the same time, it has to be recognised
that it is not possible in all cases for the
medical authorities to accurately deter-
mine at the time of a man?s dischargo
how far the then existing disability may
be temporary or permanent, and some op- -
portunity for revision would, therefore.


Australian Soldiers? Repatriation
Summary of the Speech
DELIVERED BY
SENATOR MILLEN
(Minister for Repatriation)
IN THE SENATE, ON 18th JULY, 1917
Repatriation is an entirely new proposi-
ion. Although much unrelated private
Sort has taken place in certain of the
Hied countries, no comprehensive project
as yet been submitted by any Govern-
lent. Australia is therefore giving a
3ad to other nations. Repatriation is an
xpression of the nation?s determination
3 look after those who, as a result of the
f ar, are incapacitated, and to seek by
rganized effort to secure satisfactory re-
statement in civil life of those who are
ipable of such re-instatementi. The
ation put forth organized effort
> enrol these men in the ranks
E the army fighting for its safety,
k must with equal determination insure
iat an organized effort is made to secure
Heir return to that civil life which at the
ill of duty they temporarily abandoned.
Repatriation is not a mere proposal for
lie disbursement of money. There is an
conomic side to the problem. If 25,000
len remain unnecessarily idle for only
ne week there is a loss to the community
f from �600,000 to �700,000. In help-
ig the returned soldiers we shall also be
elping ourselves by hastening the pro-
uctive activities of the country.
C.9992.
Government Accepts Responsibility.
The problem cannot be left to un-
directed and unco-ordinated private effort,
however earnest and determined it may
be. ' The nature, extent, and duration of
the work requires it to be accepted as a
national responsibility. This Government
accepts that responsibility. The Govern-
ment must have an organization which it
can direct, which will move to a pre-deter-
mined plan, and w T hich will be responsive
to its control. I have endeavoured to
devise a scheme with which there will be
sufficient of the official element to insure
uniformity, regularity, and continuity
and as much of private assistance as cir-
cumstances will permit and the people are
willing to provide. The Government will
from time to time seek Parliamentary ap-
propriation as may be required to replen-
ish the Central Fund, and the policy of
uniformity in disbursement will be ar-
rived at?not uniformity in the amount
allotted to each individual soldier, but
uniformity of the principles upon which
disbursement shall proceed. No further
appeals to the public will be launched for
donations to the Central Fund. Local
activities, however, will be allowed very


wide scope, but they must be under the
control of the local committees to be
created under the proposed Act. They
must be for the benefit generally of all the
soldiers in the district covered, and not for
individual men, and will need to conform
to regulations as to supervision and audit.
Existing Funds.
Repatriation shall commence at the
time of the soldier?s discharge. Local
patriotic funds will therefore be consider-
ably relieved. The public, however, will
be appealed to to sustain and continue
those funds designed for the welfare of
the soldier and his dependants prior to the
date of his discharge. At a conference
of representatives of these funds three
principles were approved?first, that the
several funds should adopt a uniform
policy; second, that there should be a com-
mon collecting agency in each State ; and,
third, a recognition of the responsibility
resting upon the Commonwealth as to
supervising the administrative costs of
such funds. It was decided to adopt, both
with regard to the dependants and the
soldier, the highest scale of benefits at
present in operation. The new scale of
payments will become operative as soon
as practicable after August 1, 1917.
Registration, Paying Off, and
Employment.
It is essential that the Repatriation
Organization should have not only a com-
plete register of the men on whose behalf
it is required to act, but that it should
have that registration as early as possible.
Registration should be effected prior to, in-
stead of after, discharge. If possible, regis-
tration should be effected on the voyage
out or even prior to the soldier?s departure
from Great Britain. If practicable the
soldier should be paid off at the Repatria-
tion office instead of at the Barracks. In
that case a branch of the Commonwealth
Bank would be opened in the building and
the soldier would be invited to deposit a
proportion of his final pay, and so be safe-
guarded against temptations by which he
is now assailed. Registration having been
effected, the application of the soldier will
be dealt with. To aid the speedy absorp-
tion of the men into their previous occupa-
tions I propose the establishment in the
Central Offices of each State of a Labour
Bureau.
Training of Injured.
Those soldiers whose efficiency has been
impaired as the result of wounds or illness
will be unable to follow their previous
occupations. Elementary training will be
imparted to them in curative workshops
attached to the hospitals. Two means
seem available for providing more ad-
vanced training. One is the establish-
ment of special Government institutions
wherein the men could be given the train-
ing necessary to enable them to take their
places as qualified workmen; the other,
by an arrangement with private employers
under which the latter would pay in pro-
portion to the value of the man?s work,
the Government paying the difference be-
tween that sum and the recognised wage
appropriate to the particular occupation.
Renewal of Training.
Apprentices who had not completed
their ? indentures should have an oppor-
tunity of finishing their course and be-
coming qualified and skilled workmen. The
country must accept the responsibility of
supplementing their wages to enable them
to do so. Technical colleges, existing Go-
vernment workshops, &c., offer a measure
of assistance. In addition, arrangements
should be made with private firms to com-
plete the interrupted indentures, the
Commonwealth subsidizing wages as may
be necessary. If these avenues are in-
sufficient, it. will be necessary to provide
special training establishments. In cases
in which a man?s capacity has been per-
manently impaired, it is proposed to con-
fer with the industrial unions and with
employers, with a view to arriving at an
understanding as to their employment.
Special provision will have to be made
for the totally incapacitated.. Such cases
will be met in two ways. First, by the
establishment of hostels or homes in suit-
able locations where those who elect to be-
come inmates can satisfactorily and syrn-
patheticaly be looked after. In the case
of those who, having homes to go to, or
friends able and willing to look after
them, there should, at the discretion of
the repatriation authorities, be granted an
extra allowance up to 10s. to meet the
necessities of the ease. Sanatoria will be
established for those suffering from tuber-
cular complaints. Arrangements will be
made bv which discharged soldiers need-
ing medical attention will receive it. A


itory will be established, with branches
the different States, for the manufac-
re, repairs, and renewals of artificial
ibs.
Land Settlement.
In considering land settlement, a pro-
>rtion of the money to be spent under
iis heading ought to be regarded as
ling spent in the country?s develop
ent, and not solely to meet our obliga-
ons to the soldiers. The Commonwealtl
overnment recently undertook to mak<
Ivances to the States, to be in turn ad
meed by them to the settler, to enabh
le latter to effect improvements, pur
iase plants, seed, stock, &c. The limit
i any case was to be �5OO. It was alsc
p-eed to establish training farms. It
iculd be laid down as a principle that
>ldings designed for soldier settlers should
Hiform to the capital available for theii
orking. If a genuine effort is to be made
> provide for those of a lesser expert
ace and no capital, and at the same time
ive a distinct impetus to small settlement
aen a new policy must be evolved, not
i substitution, but as an addition to the
sisting proposals. For the satisfactory
ittlement of this last class there are four
mtial conditions ?
(1) That the holding should be of
such a size that the settler?s
own labour is the most im-
portant factor in its develop-
ment and working.
(2) That the size and character of
the holding shall correspond
with the financial resources at
the command of the settler.
(3) That the knowledge necessary to
work the holding can be ac-
quired in a short period.
(4) That the returns shall be quick.
The underlying idea of these small-hold-
tag propositions is that the Government
hall guarantee a market and organize
he handling and sale of the produce,
log raising affords an instance of what is
iroposed. In America whole districts are
ievoted to hog raising without the assist-
ance of the dairying industry. A market
ould be assured by providing slaughter-
ng establishments, and by guaranteeing
i minimum price to the producer.
Eventually such factories could be handed
?ver as co-operative concerns to the set-
tiers. The Government will also mako
available such scientific and practical ad-
vice as may be desirable.
Certain projects are under considera-
tion which will carry a man on until he
iither obtains, or the Repatriation Or-
ganization obtains for him, that more per-
nanent occupation which he desires and
for which he is fitted. Such reserve em-
ployment must be suitable to the varying
capacity and physical strength of the in-
dividuals. Afforestation and the Murray
River scheme suggest themselves as prac-
ticable means for absorption of such
labour. It is proposed that the Pensions
Act should be amended. Revision will be
provided for at the expiration of six
months from the granting of the pension.
Any further revision will be at the option
of the pensioner, and any alteration of
the pension must then be by way of in-
crease. Assistance in the establishment
of residences in urban areas is also under
consideration.
Central Organization.
The question now presents itself as to
the organization necessary to carry out
hese proposals. First of all, it is pro-
posed that there shall be a Commission
of seven members as a central organiza-
tion. The members of this Board will be
private citizens appointed by the Govern-
ment, acting in an honorary capacity.
This and all subordinate bodies will in-
clude returned soldiers. The duties of
the Commission will be to prescribe by
regulations the nature and the extent of
the many beneficial activities embraced in
the work of repatriation which have been
indicated. Included in the staff with
which the central organization must neces-
sarily be provided will be one or, if neces-
sary, more inspectors, whose duty will be,
by frequent visitations, to secure uniform
and smooth working throughout the whole
country.-
State Organization 1 .
State organizations will be charged
with the actual work of carrying out the
policy emanating from the Central Board.
In the capital of each State there shall be
created by appointment a Board of seven,
acting in an honorary capacity. It is de-
sirable that returned soldiers should be
represented. At the head of each State
there will be a responsible official, and


under his control the work will be sub-
divided into various appropriate sections,
such as training, employment, disable-
ment, land, &c. Progress would be ex-
pedited if there were in the Repatriation
office an officer whose duty it would be
to help the soldier-settler in the prepara-
tion and presentation of his application
for land to the State Lands Department.
District Committees.
Throughout Australia people will be in-
vited to create district voluntary organiza-
tions. These areas should be well defined
and co-terminous. These committees will
be invited to promote in every conceivable
way the interests of returned soldiers. A
special feature of their duty should be to
endeavour to find openings for employ-
ment in their districts. ? Working bees ?
could be established to give a man help
in the erection of initial improvements
and to assist in various other ways.
The different branches of repatriation
work will be brought under one roof.
Every effort will be made to secure eco-
nomy,, but under no conceivable circum-
stances can a very considerable expendi-
ture be avoided. That expenditure, how-
ever, will be only such as is necessary to
insure efficiency. This is a broad view of
what is contemplated, and as the last
word has not yet been spoken, it is neces-
sary to keep an open mind. These sug-
gestions are an earnest attempt to meet
the nation?s obligations to those who, on
its behalf, have gone down into the Valley
of the Shadow of Death, and it is hoped
that the scheme will, be regarded as not
altogether unworthy either of Australia or
of those who willingly and heroically
fought and suffered in her defence.
By Authority : Albert J. Mullett, Government Printer, Melbourne.


ippear to be necessary. It is proposed in
irder to meet the difficulty that the Pen-
ions Act should be amended. Revision
nil be provided for at the expiration of
ix months from the granting of the pen-
don. Any further revision will be at the
iption of the pensioner, and any altera-
ion in the pension must then be by way
)f increase only.
Housing.
It is reasonable to assume that
nany of those returned may desire
hat the assistance to be rendered shall
;ake the form of assistance in the estab-
ishment of residences in urban areas. I
am endeavouring to work out a scheme
which possibly, by the utilization of
existing agencies, will make financial as-
sistance available upon liberal and attrac-
tive terms.
Central Organization.
I have so far dealt with the things
proposed to be done. I now come
to the organization necessary to do
them. In outlining the proposals I
reiterate that the Government, having
accepted the responsibility for the work,
must have control over the agencies em-
ployed in carrying on that work, at the
same time securing as large a measure of
assistance as possible from private citi-
zens. There must be sufficient of the
methods of a public Department to secure
continuity and precision, but I have
sought to secure with this that assistance
which will undoubtedly be rendered if a
portion of the work and some of the re-
sponsibility devolves upon the commu-
nity. I propose first, as a central organ-
ization, a Commission of seven, of which
the Minister will be chairman. The
members of this Board will be private
citizens appointed by the Government.
They will he asked to act in an honorary
capacity. This Board, and all subordi-
nate bodies, to which I shall refer directly,
will include returned soldiers. The duties
of this Commission will be to prescribe by
regulations the nature and extent of the
many beneficial activities embraced in the
work of repatriation, and which I have
generally indicated. It will prescribe,
for instance, the purposes for which
money may be made available, the limits
and conditions of such assistance. It will
also hear appeals from the applicants dis-
satisfied with the decisions of the State
Boards, to which I shall refer a little
later.
Included in the staff with which the
central organization must necessarily be
provided will be one, or, if necessary,
more, inspectors, whose duty will he, by
frequent visitations, to secure uniform
and smooth working throughout the whole
country. Such duties will be the more
important in view of the large measure
of decentralization which is contemplated.
As a very wide latitude is to be accorded
to the repatriation authorities in the
States, and as, in view of such latitude, it
is impossible to avoid by any mere regu-
lation a divergence of working, I believe
that a competent inspector continuously
moving about would act both as a correc-
tive and stimulus. A visit from such a
man, and his consultation with those
carrying on the work in the various
centres, would do more than months of
correspondence to secure uniformity and
satisfactory results.
State Organization.
I now come to the State organizations
which will be charged with the actual
work of carrying out the policy emanating
from the Central Board. I propose that
in the capital city of each State there shall
be created by appointment, a Board of
seven, acting in an honorary capacity.
As with the Central Board, it is desirable
that the returned soldiers should be repre-
sented. This Board will deal with the ap-
plications submitted by returned soldiers,
and will in addition have other functions
to which I perhaps need not now refer.
At the head of each State organization
there will be a responsible official, and
under his control, the work will be sub-
divided into various appropriate sections,
such as employment, training, disable-
ment, land, &c. As disablement obviously
requires special assistance there will be as-
sociated with this branch a voluntary
committee of experts. With regard to
land, although upon the States will fall
the duty of settling the soldiers upon the
land, I think progress would be greatly
expedited if there were in the repatria-
tion office, an officer whose duty would be
to help the soldier settler in the preparation
and presentation of his application to the
State Lands Department. There is neces-
sarily a routine to be followed by the


soldier who wishes to obtain land through
the instrumentality of the State Lands
Department. But he cannot be expected
to be familiar with that routine, and his
want of knowledge on this point is likely
to lead to delays, confusion, irritation,
and in some cases, possibly failure. If
afforded assistance from a qualified official
acting really as his gratuitous agent, the
path, which might otherwise be difficult,
would become smooth.
All applications?and when I use the
word applications ? I mean registrations
?would be dealt with by the State Board.
Upon the registration forms will be set
out l what it is that each soldier wishes the
repatriation organization to do for him.
If I have used the word ? applications ?
anywhere honorable senators will please
understand that in so doing I was refer-
ring to the soldiers? registration cards.
These applications will be dealt with by
the Board to which I have referred. Any
applicant feeling dissatisfied with the
Board s decision would be free to address
an appeal to the Central Commission. The
responsibility for the efficient working of
the staff of each State organization would
devolve upon the Chief Executive Officer
for that State.
District Committees.
Right throughout Australia I propose
to invite the people to create district
voluntary organizations. It is essential
that these areas should be well defined
and co-terminous. In many cases existing
areas such as municipalities or shires sug-
gest appropriate divisions, but there aie
other cases, as, for instance, where a
municipality is completely surrounded by
a shire, that such lines should not be too
closely followed. But after consubation
with the local government authorities and
others qualified to advise I do not antici-
pate any great difficulty in satisfactorily
covering the whole territory with districts
adjusted to meet local conditions and local
wishes. The local committees will, when
formed, be themselves the best l judges of
the area with which their operations can
most satisfactorily be carried out. These
committees will be invited in every con-
ceivable way to promote the interests of
returned soldiers. Thev will be required
to act as the agents and deputies of the
State Board in carrving out any project
which the latter may have approved.
They will be required to advise the Board
on any matters which may be referred to
them. A special feature of their duty
should be to endeavour to find openings
for employment in their districts, making
it a point of honour to see that, as far as
practicable, preference of employment be
given to returned men. Regular and
frequent reports will be sent to the Cen-
tral State office both as to employment
offering and employment required. If effi-
ciently carried out it will be possible to
establish throughout Australia a complete
network of labour agencies working in-
cessantly in the interests of the returned
soldier.
? Working Bees.?
Another important duty which it is
competent for these bodies to discharge,
and which I earnestly hope they will
undertake, is the work at present carried
out energetically, but in a limited area,
by a body known as the ? Voluntary
Workers? Association.? This association
ati present is confined to the neighbour-
hood of Sydney. It is an association the
members of which form themselves into
working ? bees,? making their labour
available for the building of houses.
Roughily speaking, the material repre-
sents two-thirds and labour one-third of
the value represented in the cottages
which have been erected. The value of the
labour, and for which no charge is made,
represents a margin which permits of the
recipient of the cottage obtaining a satis-
factory advance from the Savings Banks
or other institutions on quite favorable
terms., This, however, is only one of the
very many activities which could be car-
ried out. In the country, similar work-
ing ? bees ? could be organized for the
help of the soldier settler. It would be a
tremendous advantage to him if, for in-
stance, by means of such voluntary orga-
nization, he were given a help in the erec-
tion of his initial improvements, and in
the gathering of his first harvest. Quite
a wide range of useful possibilities is
opened in this direction, and I sincerely
trust that when these local committees
are formed they will take up this aspect of
the work with earnestness and vigour.
The Voluntary Workers? Association has
expressed a strong desire to be allowed to
continue as a separate organization, ex-
tending its branches as opportunity pre-
sents itself. I do not, however, see that
any advantage can arise from establishing


,wo organizations in the same locality
vhen one is sufficient, and I ask them,
herefore, to merge themselves into the
arger and more extensive organiza-
tion which I now outline. The
sxperience of those responsible for orga-
lizing this association is, however, i
think too valuable to be lost, and as the
piickest way of bringing its methods
jointedly before local committees, and to
itimulate their interest in this important
>ranch of repatriation activities, I pro-
>ose to send an organizer to at any rate
he more important centres of each State.
The local committees as deputies for the
Slate authority will be required to see
aithfully carried out the Board?s deci-
>ions. For instance, where the Board
las decided to make an advance of money
! or a particular purpose to a soldier in a
;ountry district, it is not proposed that
he money shall be paid over to the sol-
iier himself, but it will be forwarded to
he district committee, who will see that
tis properly expended. As in this way
hese local committees may be required
:o handle considerable sums of public
noney, certain Government nominees will
je included in their numbers. Outside
heir activities as representatives of the
jentral body, these local committees
ivill be quite free to do what, they think
st, in the way of assistance supplementary
bo that extended by the National Re-
patriation Scheme,- subject, to the condi-
tions previously set out.
Concentration of Offices.
There is another little matter, which,
although small in itself, will be found
useful. I refer to the concentration of
offices. There is at present considerable
inconvenience owing to different, branches
>f repatriation work being scattered in
separate buildings. This is the position
in most of the capitals. I propose to
bring all under one roof. Every soldier
will then know exactly where to go, and
much time-wasting, inconvenience and
irritation will be avoided and intercpm-
mnication between the several branches
ill be greatly facilitated.
Administrative Expenditure.
Some public comment has appeared sug-
;esting a fear that the proposed new De-
triment will involve unnecessary ex-
>ense. Let me say at once that it is no
core possible for repatriation to be carried
m as a Government responsibility without
expense than it was for the children of
Israel to make bricks without straw. So
far as the objection is one merely
against undue or unnecessary expense, it
is understandable. But the administra-
tion of all that repatriation calls for,
spread, too, bver the whole continent,
must and will involve very considerable
expense It must not be supposed that the
present system is run without cost, al-
though up to the present most of this has
been borne by the State Governments,
who have provided premises and made
available the resources of a very consider-
able number of officers. The cost at pre-
sent is not less than �30,000 per year,
and the work has hardly commenced.
Everv effort will be made to secure
economy, but under no conceivable cir-
cumstances can a very considerable ex-
penditure be avoided. That expenditure
will, however, be only such as is neces-
sary to insure efficiency.
Conclusion.
Repatriation is a work of many
phases. It is so much a matter of detail
that it is an impossibility to deal fully
with it in reasonable limits of time. T
have, however, endeavoured to present
a btoad view of what is contemplated. I
do not for one moment think the last
word has been spoken. On the contrary,
I appetal to honorable senators to keep a
perfectly open mind. We are but feel-
ing our way, and must be prepared to
modify our views and our actions in the
light of daily growing experience. I
do, however, submit these proposals in
the firm belief that of many alternatives
they represent those with a maximum of
promise \and a minimum of disability. I
present them, too, in the hope that they
will be received as an earnest attempt to
meet the nation?s obligations to those
who on its behalf have gone down into
the Valley of the Shadow of Death, and
that they may be regarded as not alto-
gether unworthy either of Australia or of
those who heroically fought and suffered
in its defence.
Senator Gardiner. What about
financing the scheme?
Senator MILLEN. ?I tell the Senate
quite candidly that I am not at this
juncture concerned about finance. I have
put before honorable senators a proposi-
tion representing the duty we owe to
these returned soldiers, and whether it is
going to cost more or less for the dis-
charge of that duty, we have to shoulder
it.
