Fixing Instructions?Deep Corrugated ?Durabestos? Roofing
WUNDERLICH DEEP CORRUGATED "DURABESTOS" SHEETS
are fixed by the mitre (straight joint) method, as shown by the
illustrations on this and the following page.
TYPICAL
MITR-E
CUTS
"HAND" OF FIXING: Throughout th is catalogue, reference is
made to "left to right" and "right to left" fixing. To determine
the "hand" of fixing, stand at the gutter looking up the roof slope
and refer to the following diagrams, which illustrate;
UEfT TO RIGHT fIXING ?
4 m RIGHT TO LGPT FIXING
briefly, when fixing "left to right," take sheets (smooth side up),
with the corrugation turned down on the left side and turned
up on the right side, and make mitre cuts as shown by sketch "A."
For "right to left" fixing, reverse the sheets (still with the smooth
side up), so that the corrugation is turned up at the left side and
turned down at the right, and make mitre cuts as shown by sketch
"B."
NOTE: Accessories that are fluted for nesting into the corrugations
of the sheet, such as fluted ridge capping, must be of the same
"hand" as that adopted when fixing the sheets.
GABLE AND HIP ROOFS; When fixing Corrugated "Durabestos"
Sheets to gable or hip roofs, fixing must be commenced from the
same end of the building on both roof slopes, so that fluted ridge
capping will fit correctly.
MITRE CUTTING: Corrugated "Durabestos" Sheets are supplied
with all four corners square. Mitres are cut on the building site to
suit the "hand" of fixing and side and end laps adopted. Before
making mitre cuts, it is necessary, therefore, to determine:

I, Whether the sheets are to be fixed "left to right" or "right

of the prevailing winds or inclement weather; the side lap
should be fixed away from the weather, thus:

2. A side lap of 7" is recommended for fixing Deep Corrugated
"Durabestos."
3. End lap?see recommendation under "PITCH AND END
LAP" on previous page.
When the correct position or angle of the mitre cut has been
determined, prepare a template of the mitre for convenience of
marking off subsequent sheets to be cut. Use a hand saw for cutting
mitres.

the lower right-hand sheet.
(B) Showing mitre of top left-hand sheet

(C) Showing top right-hand sheet (over-
lapping mitre joint) in position.
FASTENING; Drill all holes?do not punch?in the top
or crown of corrugations only, approx. yV' diameter
greater than the diameter of the screw or bolt used.
Normally a yV' diam. drill is employed. One galvanised
screw (or bolt), one galvanised washer and one bituminous
(felt) washer comprise a set of "fixings." Sufficient plastic
bituminous asbestos compound must be placed between
the felt washer and the corrugated sheet to effectively
seal the hole against the entry of moisture. Secure the
sheets at each purlin or batten through the 2nd and sth
corrugation crowns. The fixings should not be screwed
down too tightly.
SIZE OF SCREW RECOMMENDED:
FOR FIXING DEEP CORRUGATED "DURABESTOS":
Use 3" x 14 gauge Galvanised Roofing Screws through
single thickness of sheet.
Use x 14 gauge Galvanised Roofing Screws through
double or triple thickness of sheet.
Use 4" x 14 gauge Galvanised Roofing Screws through
aprons of Ridge Cappings, etc.
ROOF STRUCTURE:
Where Deep Corrugated "Durabestos" Roofing is
employed, the roof structure should be slightly stronger
than that required for a 24-gauge galvanised iron roof.
Advice as to the suitability of roofing designs will be freely
given by our Technical Officers.
LAYOUT OF SHEETS: Deep Corrugated "Durabestos"
Sheets are made in lengths of 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 ft.
Set out the sheets to suit the length of the rafter, plus
necessary end laps, and plus approx. 3" projection into
the gutter. Choose sheet lengths that will involve as few
laps and entail the use of a minimum number of purlins.
SPACING OF PURLINS is influenced by the layout of
the Corrugated Sheets, with one purlin under the centre
of each end lap, and the intermediate purlins or battens
equally spaced. Battens to be provided for fixing hip or
ridge capping. Wunderlich Limited will gladly submit
purlin and sheet layouts to suit any length of rafter
involved on any roofing contract.
True hips and valleys should have the same sheet layout
and the purlins or battens maintained on the same hori-
zontal line to both roof slopes. This ensures economy, for
portions of sheets cut at one side of the hips or valleys
are then generally re-usable on the opposite roof slope. It
is also necessary to provide trimming members between
purlins or battens at each side of hip ridging to support
raking edges of sheets and hip capping, centring as for
ridging.
GUTTERS should be placed in position before commenc-
ing the fixing of the roofing sheets or other medium.
MAXIMUM PURLIN OR GIRT SPACING:
As regulations vary, reference should be made to us for
details of correct spacing of purlins (battens) or girts.

TYPICAL METHODS OF SUPPORTING BOX GUTTERS
"DURABESTOS" EAVES GUTTERS in 6' and 8' lengths are supplied
collared on one end and plain on the opposite end to fit into the
preceding length.
When commencing fixing, the position of outlets is first determined
from the position of drains at ground level. Allowing tor a fall
to outlets of aipprox. I" in 30', the gutter line is set out with a
chalk line. Then galvanised gutter brackets are screwed to the
fascia board to suit the gutter lengths?approx, at 3 centres
allowing 2 brackets for each 6' length or 3 for each 8 length of
gutter. I (or 2 in the case of 8' lengths) supporting the centre and
the other adjacent to the collar end. Then place the gutters
in position on the brackets, and assemble joints as shown by illus-
tration above, care being exercised to leave aV' 9 a P between
lengths to allow for expansion and contraction.
Fill the gutter joint with plastic asbestos bitumen compound, using
sufficient to adequately seal the joint when drawn together by two
gutter bolts which are fixed by drilling through the collar joint at
centre back and front. A round felt washer is necessary under the
bolt head, with a round bituminous and lead washer under the
nut. It is essential that the gutter joints are thoroughly dry when
sealing. ,
IMPORTANT: On no account must the gutters be secured to the
brackets or fascia, but must simply lie in the brackets and freely
permit of movement caused by expansion and contraction. Gutters
must always be in position before proceeding to fix the roofing
sheets.
Brackets or other supports are not supplied or fixed by us

m s brackets
"DURABESTOS" DOWN-
PIPES, BENDS, etc., are
supplied in lengths as
indicated on page 13,
collared at one end and

After determining the
position of the stack, fix
galvanised iron brackets
to the wall by means of
If' galvanised roofing
screws, allowing one
bracket to each length of
downpipe, placed imme-
diately under and support-
ing the collar, and one
extra length at the bottom
of the stack to hold the
last length or shoe firmly
in position. See diagram
at right, showing brackets
supporting a typical
downpipe stack.
Commence fixing from
the bottom of the stack
and work upwards. Secure
the collar end of the top
length to the gutter outlet
with one galvanised gutter
bolt. Seal the collar joint
by pointing with cement
mortar. Spigot ends are
available for the junction
of "Durabestos" downpipe
with cast iron downpipe.

BOX GUTTER JOINT
Junction
"DURABESTOS" BOX GUTTERS are normally supplied in 0" lengths,
including a 6" collar on one end, with the opposite end plain to fit into
the preceding length, thus providing an effective T 4" length of gutter.
To complete a run of gutter it is invariably necessary to manufacture
a short length; the stop-ended piece at the high end of the run is usually
chosen for this purpose.
When proceeding to fix, gutter bearers or brackets of wood or steel are
secured in position 3" on the low side of the collar and at two intermediate
points in each length at 2' 6" centres, all graded to gutter fall of I" in
12' 6". Always fix brackets and gutters from outlet end of run and work
towards the high end. The gutters are usually manufactured with raking
sides to allow for fall.
When jointing, place gutters in position on the bearers or brackets, and
assemble joints as shown above, care being exercised to leave an f" gap
between lengths to allow for expansion and contraction. Drill 4 holes for
i" bolts through points 2" from the outer edge of collar, one each at
centre back and front and two through the bottom of the gutter. Insert
a length of asbestos cord between the collar and plain end as shown by
detail above, then fill the gutter joint with plastic asbestos bitumen com-
pound, using sufficient to completely fill the cavity when drawn together
by the gutter bolts. Trowel with plastic asbestos bitumen compound on the
inside of the gutter joint, covering approximately 2" each side of the joint,
care being exercised to completely cover the bolt head. It is essential that
the gutters are properly dry when sealing the joint.
IMPORTANT: On no account must gutters be secured to bearers or brackets,
but must simply lie in position and freely permit of movement caused by
expansion and contraction. In long lines of gutter, it is essential to provide
stop ends at 75' intervals at least, and flash abutting stopped end* with
metal saddles. Where box gutters are fixed against brick or concrete
parapets or walls, overflash with lead.

The capacity of a "Durabestos" Roof Ventilator to exhaust
air depends on:?
I. Its location on the root.
2. Its size.
3. The area and position of opening, such as door and
window openings, to permit the inflow of air into
the building.
A roof ventilator should be located in a position on the
roof, where it receives the maximum force of the wind. The
size and number of ventilators to be used in any installation
is determined by consideration of the area of the roof, the
position of the ventilator in relation to wind action and
temperature differences inside and outside the building. The
openings at lower levels of the building should be at least
equal to and preferably twice as great as the combined
throat areas of the shafts of all roof ventilators.
