REPORT.
[ The paging continues the paging of the Main Report. ]
To His Excellency The Right Honorable Henry William, Baron Forster, a Member
of His Majesty's Most Honorable Privy Council , Knight Grand Cross of the Most
Distinguished Order of Saint Michael and Saint George , Governor-General and
Commander-in-Chief in and over the Commonwealth of Australia.
May it Please Your Excellency:
The matters into which your Commissioners were directed to inquire were
1. The actual cost of living at the present time, according to reasonable standards
of comfort, including all matters comprised in the ordinary expenditure of a
household, for a man with a wife and three children under fourteen years of
age, and the several items and amounts which make up that cost. -
2. The actual corresponding cost of living during each of the last five years.
3. How the basic wage may be automatically adjusted to the rise and fall from time
to time of the purchasing power of the sovereign.
The Commission has already in the Main Report (presented 19th November, 1920) given its
finding as to the actual cost of living for the family described in Clause 1. The Report shows
that while this cost of living was to be ascertained as a potential step in determining by judicial
or legislative methods, or both, what basic wage should be paid under Commonwealth sanction,
the Commission did not, as is widely supposed, make any recommendation either to the
Government or to the Courts as to what the basic wage should be or as to the way in which its
finding of the actual cost of living should be utilized in the determination of the basic wage.
In its original Report, the Commission stated that it had not so far been able to complete
its investigation under Clause 2, beyond the year 1914, and that it would await further directions
from the Government, before proceeding to complete its duties under Clause 2, with regard to the
years 1915-1919. The Commission was directed by letter from the Prime Minister, on the 27th
January, 1921, to complete this task. Preliminary work had been undertaken already in
anticipation of such a direction, the Commission having expressed the opinion that the inquiry
was desirable. The present Report deals, therefore, with the result of the investigation under
Clause 2, so far as the years 1915-1919 are concerned, and those results will be presented throughout
in an amalgamated form with the results for 1914 and 1920 already reported (see pp. 53, 59 of
main Report).
THE PROPOSED BUREAU OF STATISTICS.
It will be seen presently that the inquiry under Clause 2 has an important bearing upon the
inquiry under Clause 3of the Letters Patent. It has first, however, to be observed that part of
the Commission’s recommendation under Clause 3 was a suggestion that a Bureau of Labour and
Industrial Statistics should be organized from existing members of the Public Service, which
should ascertain from time to time the rise orTall in the purchasing power of the sovereign in relation
to the reasonable standard of comfort, for what is called in the main Report, the “ typical family ”
i.e. (such a family as is described in Clause 1). This suggestion was adopted by the Government,
as appears from the following letter from the Prime Minister’s Department to the Commission,
dated 20th December, 1920. The letter is as follows
Prime Minister’s Department.
Dear Sir, ... . . ...
In continuation of my letter of the 15th December, on the subject of the orgamzation from existing public
servants of a Bureau of Labour Statistics to undertake the work of adjustment of the basic wage to the cost of living,
I am directed to inform you that arrangements are being made to give effect to the recommendations of the Com-
mission, and that the Commonwealth Statistician is being consulted as to the methods to be followed in this connexion.
Yours faithfully,
(Signed) M. L. Shepherd, Secretary.
The Commonwealth Statistician, Mr. G. H. Knibbs, C.M.G., made a report to the Prime
Minister on 21st December, 1920. On 24th December the Government forwarded a copy, of
this Report and suggested that the Chairman of the Commission should confer with the Solicitor-
General and the Commonwealth Statistician, with a view to the submission to the Prime
Minister of a further report in regard to the matter.
A preliminary conversation with this object took place between Mr. Knibbs and the
Chairman, but it was the opinion of the Commission that a fuller discussion would be more
opportune when the material since collected and embodied in the present Report was available.
The Commission is of opinion that the proposed Bureau should be part of the organization
of the existing Bureau of Census and Statistics. It was never contemplated by the Commission
that any new officers would be needed, as indeed appears from the terms of the original recom-
mendation.

CONNEXION WITH CLAUSE 3.
(Note.- As in the main Report, the term “ Food ” in connexion with the Com-
monwealth Statistician’s figures includes a few articles of Groceries other than food
which the Commission has grouped with Miscellaneous Requirements.)
The relation of the question under Clause 2 to the questions already dealt with under
Clause 3 will now be considered.
It has been the practice of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court to adjust the basic wage
originally fixed in the Harvester Case, 1907, to fluctuations in the cost of living by utilizing the
index-numbers of the Commonwealth Statistician published since 1912. The Court has laid it
down that these index-numbers are to be regarded only as primd facie evidence, yet its actual
decisions have practically corresponded with the variations in the index-numbers. The following
passage from the original Report, page 11, may be repeated
“ It has been mentioned (page 9 of this Report) that since 1912 the Commonwealth Statistican,
“ for statistical purposes only, and originally with no intention of having his figures made applicable
“ either to determining or to adjusting the living wage, has published index-numbers which compare
“ the cost of rent, food and groceries, all taken together, from year to year, taking their cost in
“ 1911 as a basis and calling its index-number 1,000. The practice in the Commonwealth
“ Arbitration Court, followed with minor modifications by State Arbitration Courts, has been to
“ utilize these index-numbers as primd facie evidence for the purpose of obtaining a factor by
“ which to multiply (and in an epoch of continuously rising cost of living since 1907 it has always
“ been a question of multiplying) the basic wage of 7s. a day originally fixed in the Harvester Case
“soas to bring that wage up to date. Thus if the index-number for the year 1914 in Melbourne
“ was 1105 as compared with 875 in the year 1907 then the 7s. per day would be multiplied by
“ 1105
“ * n or(^-er h x the basic wage in 1915, the 1914 index-numbers being only available early
o 1 0
“in 1915. It will at once be seen that assuming 7s. a day in 1907 to have been enough to cover
“ the cost of the four sections, Rent, Food, Clothing and Miscellaneous, then to multiply the sum
“ which included all four component sections by the factor obtained by combining two of them,
“ viz., Rent and Food in a comparative figure for two relevant years, can only be a correct method
“if the remaining components, Clothing and Miscellaneous taken together or separately, also
“ vary in a ratio expressed by the same factor.”
At this point another matter acutely debated before the Commonwealth Arbitration Court
comes into the history of the decisions. In 1914 the Commonwealth Statistician found that
Rent and Food together constituted (speaking approximately) 60 per cent, of the ordinary
expenditure of a household, leaving 40 per cent, for Clothing and Miscellaneous. These
percentages were ascertained as a result of analyzing certain household budgets collected in 1913.
Since 1914 it has been assumed that the percentages for Clothing and Miscellaneous (40
per cent.) out of the total cost of living remained constant year after year. This, again, can only
be the case if people need year after year exactly the saipe proportion of money for each component
part of the necessary cost of living. It was, however, strongly contended in the years of the War
that Clothing in particular had increased in price at a greater ratio than any other section of the
cost of living, and this contention the figures now ascertained by this Commission fully justify.
The inevitable result of the cost of necessary Clothing increasing at a greater ratio than necessary
Rent and Food was that the standard of Clothing could not be maintained at the same level by
using the factor derived from Rent and Food to determine what should be inclusively provided
in the basic wage for Clothing.
The reliability of the index-numbers as a complete test of variations in the cost of living
has, therefore, been open to the objection that if the cost of Clothing, plus Miscellaneous
Requirements, should happen to advance or decline at a different ratio per cent, than the ratio
of advance or decline in the cost of Rent plus Food, then the cost of Clothing plus Miscellaneous
Requirements would no longer constitute 40 per cent, of the total cost of living. An illustration
may be taken from the experience of Perth in 1914 and in 1918—
Though this objection would always lie as a matter of logic against computing the changes
in the total cost of living from the changes in two only of the component sections of that total


cost, it might happen to prove unimportant as a matter of actual experience. In the past both
employers and employees have in turn believed that to take the index-numbers of the
Commonwealth Statistician as a true test of the rise or fall in the cost of living, was misleading.
In, the year 1915, when drought conditions led to a rapid advance in the cost of Food
and before the cost of Clothing had begun to take the rapid ascent, which, later on, was so
noticeable in the Commonwealth —employers believed that using the Commonwealth Statistician a
index-numbers had the effect of unduly inflating the total cost of living to the advantage of the
employees. This objection was urged on their behalf in the case of the Australian Letter
Carriers Association v. The Public Service Commissioner and the Postmaster-General, and in
delivering his judgment in that case Mr. Justice Powers says (9 C.A.R., p. 67) .
Mr. Skewes urged in this case —as he did in the Linemen’s Case, 29th April, 1914, before the President—(l)
That the cost of living referred to by the Commonwealth Statistician is based only on food and rent; and (2) that
the great increase in the cost of food and rent during recent years does not apply to all the other expenditure of th«
employee. The Statistician estimated food and rent to cover only 58 per cent, of the expenditure.
For this reason Mr. Skewes contended that the cost of living fixed by this Court in previous cases, based on the
Statistician’s figures, was wrong ; but he did not produce any evidence to show what the cost of living was at the present
time Mr. Skewes did show that, as to some of the items of expenditure included in the unestimated 42 per cent., it
was difficult to maintain the contention that the same increase had taken place, as on food or rent; but, as he did
not show that the expenditure, taking the whole of the items forming 42 per cent., had not. increased in the aggregate
at the same rate, I accept the Statistician’s figures as correct.
Personally, I should like to see the living wage based on estimates obtained of other expenditure besides rent
and food.
Again, in the case of Federated Artificial Manure Trade and Chemical Workers’ Union and Cuming
Smith and Company and Others, Mr. Justice Higgins, in his judgment, says (9 C.A.R., p. 190)
Mr. Derham (who represented the employers), has properly called my attention to the fact that the figures
of the Commonwealth Statistician refer only to groceries, food and rent, and not to other commodities or other
expenditure; and he urges that there is no evidence of any increased prices except for food and shelter. This
argument was pressed upon me on behalf of the employers in the case of the post office linemen, and I dealt with the
argument, as appears in the report of that case.
But after 1915, the employees in turn came to feel that to use the Commonwealth
Statistician’s index-numbers was a faulty method of determining the basic wage per medium of the
cost of living, because (they said) Clothing had now advanced at a very much more rapid rate than
Rent plus Food. A great amount of evidence in support of this contention was brought forward
in the case of the Australian Commonwealth Public Service Clerical Association and Others v.
Public Service Commissioner and Others, and in delivering his judgment in that case, Mr. Justice
Powers said (12 C.A.R., p. 534) > —
I was informed that the applications were made because of the general increased cost of living in Miscellaneous
Expenditure as well as in Rent, Food, and Groceries, and that the associations proposed to proceed on the lines referred
to in a statement made by me when delivering judgment in the case of the General Division Officers of the Trade and
Customs Department,,on the 30th day of May last.
The statement referred to was as follows :—I am prepared to reconsider any application of the Public Service
organizations as a whole—but not by one organization—for an increase in the basic wage fixed by my awards by way
of a war bonus during the war ; and if it can be proved (1) That the cost of living, including Food, Groceries, and Rent,
has increased since September last year ; (2) That the cost of Clothing and other necessaries of a worker’s home has
increased since 1914 to a greater extent than Food, Groceries, and Rent; (3) That the increases are large enough to
warrant an increased basic wage ; and (4) That the increased cost will in all probability continue, I would make such
an award as I thought just. Parliament would still have the right to decide whether the increased rate allowed, if
any, should be paid as a war bonus.
It will thus be .seen that as well as definitely settling long standing controversies before
the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, the Commission’s task under Clause 2 has a vital importance
in relation to future adjustments of the basic wage to the current cost of living.
In fairness to past practice, it should be pointed out that the method of taking the full
range of commodities and services which go to make up the cost of living, and following up the
fluctuations in prices over that full range was a method that could not be adopted until, as was
done by the Commission under Clause 1, a standard was determined as to articles, quantities,
duration and prices, both of Clothing and of Miscellaneous Requirements. It was, no doubt, the
grave hiatus then existing in this prime essential of information which to a large extent prompted
the desire expressed by the Judges of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court for the present
investigation. (See pages 12 and 13 of the main Report). Until the money necessary for
Clothing, for Miscellaneous Requirements, for Rent and for Food could be stated separately in
reference to a determined standard of living, it was not possible for a statistician to follow up
fluctuations in the aggregate cost of these sections, which aggregate constitutes the cost of
living The hypothesis that the first two sections always varied directly as the last two sections,
was therefore forced upon the authorities as the only ground upon which they could estimate
the fluctuation in the cost of living by utilizing the system of index-numbers.


It IS hardly necessary to lay stress upon the consideration that an inquiry to determine
the amount of money necessary for a reasonable standard in Clothing and" Miscellaneous
Requirements was, as the experience of the Commission has shown, a task that could not be
undertaken as a matter of detail in the work of a great Department, nor by the Arbitration Court
as part o± the hearing of one case.
, P rese nt -Report will show that this hypothesis was, during the years of war prices and
up to the year 1920, at variance with the facts. Comparisons throughout this Report have been
made by taking the prices in the month of November in each year. In the year 1914, no marked
fluctuations in prices had occurred by November, so that the prices for that year were in realitv
pre-war prices, as well as pre-drought prices—but ever since then, as a result partly of the 1915
drought and partly of the War, prices have fluctuated violently, and never according to the same
ratio of advance m Rent plus Food as in Clothing plus Miscellaneous Requirements.
The figures in support of this statement quoted below constitute a demonstration of the
advantage, now obtainable as a result of determining quantities and prices in all Sections, of
carrying out in the future that more extended comparison of prices which has already been
recommended by the Conmussion in the main Report. The number of items as to the prices
of which the Commonwealth Statistician s index-numbers have hitherto been prepared is in all 46
. t 7 e art \ C6S aS prices can now be c °mpared, includes almost all those 46 and
about 200 others, being all of them commodities or services'of daily necessity. The proposed
.Bureau can, therefore, bring out the fluctuations in the cost of living with the closest possible
approach to certainty as a result of ascertaining what that cost of living actually is from
quarter to quarter as expressed in terms of money.
METHOD OF TRACING ANNUAL FLUCTUATIONS.
. Tbe . methods adopted by the Commission for the purpose of returning its answer to the
questions involved in Clause 2 of the Letters Patent will now be described, taking in turn the
recognised Sections of the cost of living.
Rent.
1 itei ? n^ 6 followed the same procedure with regard to the years
1915-1919 as was followed in the main Report, which upon this point may here be reproduced
(p. 52) :> —
The rent stated below as part of the cost of living in 1914 is the rent for a house similar in all respects to that
described on page 22 of this Report,* but inasmuch as there are no statistical returns limited to the rent of houses of
that description, it is necessary to adopt as a modifying factor for bringing the present-day rent of such a house back
to the 1914 level, a figure which has been obtained by accepting the Commonwealth Statistician’s ratio between the
rents of five-roomed houses as to which he collected information in 1920, and the rents for which returns were sent to
him m 1914 1 his it has been safe to do because the type of house as to which house agents have been for years past
sending in their returns to the Commonwealth Statistician has been the same throughout the intervening period and
moreover house agents have been, so the Commission ascertained during the taking of evidence, in the habit of fillum
in their returns period by period from the rents of the same houses as far as possible. To apply, therefore to the
five-roomed house of the type determined upon by this Commission the Commonwealth Statistician’s ratio between
the rents of five-roomed houses in 1920 and the rents of similar houses in 1914 involves only one element of hypothesis
and that is, that the rents for a house of this kind have fluctuated pari passu with the rents for other five-roomed
houses dealt with in the Commonwealth Statistician’s computations.
(* Note.—This was such a house as would afford a reasonable standard of comfort for the typical family.)
In order to obtain a test of the soundness of the hypothesis last mentioned, the Commission
obtained from house agents who had given evidence in Melbourne the actual rents of five-roomed
houses for the year 1914-1920, to which latter year their evidence was directed. The ratios of
fluctuation being ascertained from these data over the rents during the seven years in question
of some 150 houses, it was found that these ratios corresponded substantially with those of the
Commonwealth Statistician. It was not considered necessary to apply a similar check to the
ratios for other cities.
Clothing.
The method adopted in the main Report (p. 52) for the purpose of ascertaining the
cost of Clothing in 1914 may be reproduced here
1. The Indicator List determined upon has been regarded as furnishing the standard of living appropriate to
the year 1914, the Commission having already, in determining upon articles and qualities for the purpose of this
inquiry, followed the principle that the standard of 1914 was not now to be lowered.
2. The traders in Melbourne who furnished the articles in the Indicator List have given their valuation of those
articles in 1914. From these valuations a ratio has been obtained between 1914 and 1920 prices for Melbourne, and
this ratio has been used for the other capitals upon the assumption, which would appear to be a sound one, that the
rate of increase in price over so large a number of articles and so wide a period will have been substantial!v’the same
in all capital cities.
3. As a check upon this method a list has been made of fair average quality garments of the kind and of the
number specified in the Indicator Lists, and the prices as in 1914 and in 1920 from the same traders’ catalogues have
been calculated so as to arrive at totals for each of the years compared.


The same method in substance was adopted for the years subsequent to 1914. In
Melbourne where the work of the Commission has been carried on since the Main Report it was,
of course, possible to secure from the firms supplying the articles upon which the Indicator Lists
are based, the actual prices for these articles in each of the years intervening. In the other cities
it was not so possible. The prices for 1920 were, of course, based upon the valuation of the
articles selected as a tentative regimen which the Commission took with them. It was not con-
sidered necessary to take these articles again to the cities and ask the retailers to supply their
valuations for the intervening years. In each city certain retailers had supplied fair average
quality prices for articles enumerated in the Indicator Lists. These were sent to the firms
in question with a request that the fair average quality prices for the same articles in
November of each of the intervening years should be given.
These prices having been received and tabulated, they were applied to the articles (bearing
in mind their number and duration) specified in the Indicator Lists, and thus results were
obtained which gave the “ weighted ” ratio of variation in the cost of the total regimen for each
of the years specified. These ratios were then applied to the values of the Indicator Lists for
1920. In determining, in its former Report, the values of the Indicator List of Clothing for the
year 1914, it was assumed that the ratio of change between 1914 and 1920 was the same in the
capital cities other than Melbourne, as it has been in Melbourne itself. The present more
exhaustive tabulation of the prices of clothing in the manner described, above shows that the
assumption was substantially correct. The difference is slight, amounting at the most to Is, 2d.
per week in Perth.
FOOD.
In ascertaining the cost of living in this Section, the Commission was able to obtain reliable
quotations of the prices in the years in question of all the articles in the Indicator Lists, except
fish, fresh fruit and vegetables other than potatoes and onions. The movement of prices so
ascertained was assumed to be reflected in the prices for fish, fresh fruit, and vegetables. Though
this assumption is not theoretically satisfactory, yet it is probable that the price of fish
fluctuates in very fair correspondence with the price of -meat, and that the price of vegetables,
other than potatoes and onions, fluctuates approximately with the prices of the last-named
vegetables. Whether this be so or not, the items fish, fruit, and vegetables only represent weekly
expenditures of Is. 6d., 2s. Bd., and Is. 4d., out of a total expenditure for Melbourne in November,
1920, of £2 6s. 2d. for Food (see Indicator List, page 44 of main Report). The assumption in
question, cannot, therefore, very substantially affect the accuracy of the finding as to the cost of
living in Food in successive years.
MISCELLANEOUS REQUIREMENTS.
On page 51 of the main Report will be found a list of miscellaneous items which go to make
up the standard of reasonable comfort. All those items permitted of specific information being
obtained as to prices, except the items Domestic Assistance, Newspapers, &c., Recreation, &c.
With regard to Domestic Assistance, the amount determined by the Commission was based upon
the principle of allowing an amount which corresponded with certain savings which might be
effected by a housewife undertaking the tasks alluded to on page 47 of the main Report. These
savings represent 5 per cent, on the total cost of Clothing, and accordingly the item of Domestic
Assistance during the years 1915 to 1919 has been calculated by allowing the same percentage on
the cost of Clothing ascertained for each of these years respectively. With regard to the item
Newspapers, &c., the variation in the price of the leading daily newspapers was taken as the basis,
it being assumed that about the same variation would occur in the cost of Stationery and Stamps.
The item Recreation, &c., was fixed by obtaining the comparative cost in the years under review
of charges of admission to ordinary entertainments. All the items so fixed by a process of
estimation are small, and there is no room, therefore, for any substantial degree of error as a result
of the methods described.
TABLES SHOWING THE RESULTS OBTAINED.
Table A sets out the cost of living corresponding to that cost in 1920 as determined by the
main Report for all the years 1914 to 1920 in the capital cities of the Commonwealth. The totals
in this Table will, therefore, represent the specific answer of the Commission to the question put
in Clause 2, viz., “ the actual cost of living according to reasonable standards of comfort for a man,
wife, and three children during each of the years in question/’

TABLE B.
A S an example of the comparisons that may be made by using the two last fables it will
be eeen that the weekly amount, according to the starting point and method adopted by the
Arbitration Court, was for 1918 in Perth, £2 18s. 7d„ and according- to the starting pomt and
Commission £4 9b 2d., and that the percentage increase compared with 1914
method of the seco nd, 22-5. This exceptionally wide difference is due
rthe 7 fact fft inpih'tfoS of FTodlid not, between 19?4 and lW rise as it did in the
Eastern States, whereas the cost of Clothing did rise in about the same proportion in all States
The disparities which emerge from the comparisons shown by these Tables are to be attributed
to the factor akeady noted, viz., that the Commonwealth Statistician s inquiries into the purchasing
value of the pound omitted any separate consideration of the two Sections, Clothing an
Miscellaneous Requirements, and his index-numbers show only the variations m the cost of Food

missioner and the Postmaster-General
,
The contrasts shewn in Tables B and C constitute the nearest practical comparisons to
the cost of living as determined by the Commission which arise from the joint effect in past
practice —( a ) of treating the Harvester wage as providing the cost of living in Melbourne in
1907 ; ( h ) of computing changes by the methods hitherto followed in the Arbitration Court.
In order to show' the difference arising from this second factor alone, the following table has
been prepared. It shows the Harvester wage brought up to date by the application of the
percentage increases shewn in Tables B and C of the Commonwealth Statistician and of the
Commission respectively. The wage for 1914 is- (for each town) the wage corresponding to the
wage of £2 2s. per week in 1907 if it had been fixed solely by the application of the
Commonwealth Statistician’s index numbers for the fourth quarter of that year
TABLE E.
Harvester Wage on Each Method of Adjustment.
In T able F, figures are given showing how the wages actually awarded from time to time
in the Commonwealth Arbitration Court compare with (1) the Harvester Basic Wage, brought
up to date by applying to it the Commonwealth Statistician’s index-numbers for the last quarter
in each year under (2) the amount of the Commission’s finding as to the cost of living
in November of the same years ; (3) the average wage for adult male employees in the fourth
quarter of the same years.
The following facts must be borne in mind :• —
1* The wages are for Melbourne only, as it is thought that for purposes of comparison
the figures relating to one city are sufficient.
2. The Arbitration Court’s Awards as a rule have a currency of three years, but in
the cases marked with an asterisk the basic wage was varied as noted before
the Award had expired.
3. With regard to the last column, the average adult wage includes those fixed by
Wages Boards in Victoria, which, as a rule, are lower than in the Arbitration
Court Awards. On the other hand, the wages of skilled workers are included.
4. As mentioned in the Main Report, the practice of the President in the Arbitration
Court was to compute wages, according to the index-numbers for the last
calendar year ; the practice of the Deputy President (Mr. Justice Powers) was
to compute according to index-numbers of the twelve months preceding his
Award. In each case the average of the index-numbers for the four quarters
in question was taken.
5. From the preceding paragraph it follows that the Judges of the Arbitration Court at the
date of making any of the Awards did not have before them the figures set out in the second
column of figures in the Table, which have been so selected in point of date as to correspond with
the last two columns. The rates set out in the first column were, however, still in force at the
dates of the second column.

In the course of its judgment upon the Basic Wage in Queensland the Full Court of Industrial
Arbitration (Mr. Justice McCawley and Mr. Justice McNaughton) spoke as follows (15th
February, 1921)......
The same learned Judge (the President of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court), in an article published in
the Harvard “ Law Review ” of December, 1920, thus refers to this basic wage, [i.e., the basic wage as awarded from
time to time by the Commonwealth Arbitration Court]: —“ In finding the basic wage the Court uses a rough estimate
which it made in an inquiry in 1907 as to ‘fair and reasonable remuneration,’ and the Court varies the 7s. per day,
425. per week, as then estimated in the ratio that the cost of living has increased since 1907. But there is no doubt
that the rough estimate made by the Court in 1907 ought to be superseded or revised by a new investigation made
after so many years have elapsed as to the absolute present cost of living. .
He considered that the wage of 7s. per day fixed by him in the Harvester Case involved a rise in the standard
of life, remarking, in the article referred to —“By a curious piece of good fortune, the standard of life was actually raised
at the beginning, before the application of the Statistician s figures j and the raised standard not the previous
standard—has been upheld in a long series of awards. For the very first case that came before the present President
was a special inquiry in which the President had to decide (for the purpose of an Excise Tariff) whether certain manu-
facturers were giving ‘ fair and reasonable remuneration ’ to their employees, and he had to make lip his mind what
was ‘ fair and reasonable.’ His conclusion was that a wage of 7s. per day, 425. per week, was the least wage that would
be sufficient for wholesome living in Melbourne, and the manufacturers were not paying so much. The wage at
the time for the labourer was ss. or 6s. per day. I think that lam close to the mark when I say, that even for men
in regular work, the average wage was not more than ss. Gd. per day, 335. per week. This would mean that the standard
was raised by over 27 per cent, in 1907 ; and this raised standard has been preserved in the succeeding awards, which
prescribed increases proportionate to the increase in the cost of living.”
{ 3rd Quarter ; 4th Quarter not available.


This rough estimate, which by a curious piece of good fortune ” raised the standard of life, has remained
the basis, not only of Federal awards, but also, in a large measure, of State awards. The fixing of a basic wage requires
a etermination of what ought to be the standard of living, of what approach to that standard is practicable and ought
to be prescribed, and of what sum is necessary in wages for the maintenance of that standard. For the due determination
o t ese matters it is manifestly desirable that the relevant facts should be ascertained with such scientific precision
as may be reasonably attainable. The Basic Wage Commission has shown how imperfect and incomplete were the
materials upon which the Harvester decision was based (pp. 9-13 of the Report).
remains only to add that between the theoretical basis of the standard which this
Commission has determined and the standard as defined in the Harvester Case there is
no difference. The term used in the Letters Patent was “ reasonable standards of comfort,
including all matters comprised in the ordinary expenditure of the household for a man with a
wife and three children under 14 years of age.” The standard as defined in the Harvester Case
is the normal needs of the average employee regarded as a human being living in a civilized
community/ As will be seen by the Report of the Commission under the headings “ Decision
as to the Class of Worker and What are Reasonable Standards of Comfort ” (pages 14—18
of the main Report) this Commission has throughout its task considered that £ * the normal needs
of the average employee regarded as a human being living in a civilized community ” are exactly
paraphrased in the Letters Patent by the term “ reasonable standards of comfort,” the word
‘ man ” being used as the equivalent of the words “ average employee ” as will appear from the
concluding sentence now quoted of the Commission’s “ Decision as to the Class of Worker.”
The Commission, therefore, has determined reasonable standards of comfort, not by reference to any one type
°r. jnoup of employees, but by reference to the needs which are common to all employees, following the accepted
principle that there is a standard of living below which no employee should be asked to live (p. 17).
CONCLUSION.
In the light of the figures now ascertained the Commission has the honour to report
that so far as the years 1915 to 1920 are concerned fluctuations in the cost of living have not been
correctly determined, and could not be correctly determined, by using the limited material up till
now at the disposal of the authorities. Further, that such fluctuations in the cost of living may,
by the use of the materials set out in the main Report as to the cost of living in all its branches’
be ascertained with the closest possible approach to accuracy. It follows°that the methods
already proposed in the main Report, Division 111, for adjusting from time to time the basic
wage to the rise and fall in the purchasing power of the sovereign should be adopted.
THE AMERICAN MINIMUM QUANTITY BUDGET FOR A WORKER’S FAMILY OF FIVE
PERSONS.
In the Main Report at page 17 an allusion was made to the Tentative Budget Inquiry
conducted in the United States of America in the year 1919, but it was not possible from that inquiry
to compare the results arrived at in America and those included in the Main Report. Since then
the Commission has been able to study, in the June 1920 Monthly Labour Review of the
American Bureau of Labour Statistics, the methods and conclusions of that Bureau as to
the “ Minimum Quantity Budget Necessary to Maintain a Worker’s Family of Five in Health
and Decency.”
The subject dealt with by the Letters Patent of the Australian Commission is so important
to the daily life of the community that an account of similar work carried out in America by the
Bureau of Labour Statistics, of which Dr. Royal Meeker is the distinguished head, cannot fail
to be of practical value for both countries.
OBJECTIVES.
The objectives of the Australian Commission and of the American Bureau will first be
described.
The cost of living was to be ascertained by this Commission as a potential step in determining
by judicial or legislative methods or both, the wages to be paid under Commonwealth sanction
In America, where wages are not determined either directly by legislation or by that delegation
of legislative authority which the Courts exercise, the objective of the inquiry is thus stated (pi) *-
The Bureau of Labour Statistics prepared primarily for the use of the Congressional Commission on
Reclassification a tentative quantity and cost budget necessary to maintain a family of five in health
and decency in Washington, D.C. It is even more important to establish a quantity budget for the
working man's family than for the clerical family. Such a quantity budget is needed for the more
accurate determination of the cost of maintaining a working man’s family in health and decency and
also for the more accurate calculation of changes in the cost of living. This tentative quantity budget
for a worker’s family constitutes the bureau’s best estimate at this time of what should be ‘inch, did
in the family budget of the working man. ' included


Though the American inquiry was not specifically undertaken for the purpose of determining
wages it will probably be utilized in future bargaining as to wages. In many progressive
factories and establishments in America the system exists of paying a standard wage, to which is
added in a separate pay-envelope an amount which varies with the cost of living, and in some
establishments, regard is had to the number of children in the individual employee s family.
For such purposes, the Bureau’s quantity budget would be certainly appealed to as an authority.
METHODS.
The outstanding difference in method is that the American Bureau carried out its inquiry
without any public evidence, obtaining its data (1) from household budgets, (2) from interviews with
families, (3) from clothing experts, (4) from the experts of the Committee to study the Relationship
of Standards of Living to Health, National Conference on Social Work, Office of Home Economics
(Miss Caroline L. Hunt). The inquiry was, therefore, in the nature of an economic research carried
out by official experts and statisticians. The Australian inquiry has been conducted in public
before a Commission representative of the community, by the judicial method of taking evidence
on oath in open Court and subject to cross-examination. The reason for this method was that
the Letters Patent involved determining what are “ reasonable standards of comfort and upon
this fundamental and preliminary question it was essential that the community itself should have
the rio-ht of audience rather than that it should have the question determined in advance by
experts, however skilled and experienced. In the the famihes selected for
study in regard to Household Equipment spent annually from $1,500 to $2,100 (say £3OO to £400)
per annum” and were for this reason regarded by the experts as presumably hying at a fairly
decent and healthful standard. Their household equipment, therefore, may be regarded as
reasonably sufficient in quantity and quality, although of course not luxurious. These and
similar phrases in the Quantity Budget indicate that the level of living for the working man
chosen by the American experts, was much the same as the reasonable standard of comfort
nostulated in the Letters Patent. The cost of living in Australia, at such a standard, has been
ascertained as about £5 16s. per week (equals about £3OO per annum) and this amount was the
minimum taken by the American experts who selected _ families living at a fairly decent and
healthful standard.” The purchasing power of money in Australia is, however, believed to be
higher than in America. „ , . . ~ ~ , ~ .
8 The fact that the American investigators first fixed a level of income which would justify
the presumption that families living at that level were enjoying a reasonable standard of comfort,
confirms the view of this Commission (see Main Report, p. 17) that under the current Australian
doctrine “ even the humblest worker ought to receive a wage which will afford him reasonable
standards of comfort.’ ” The American inquiry at the outset “ avoided the pitfall of supposing
that because the humblest worker ought to be paid ‘the actual cost of living, according to
reasonable standard of comfort,’ therefore, that ‘ actual cost of living according to reasonable
standard of comfort ’ must be ascertained by finding what the humblest worker does actually
exnend ” (See Main Report, p. 17). . _ ....
1 It is of interest to add that Mr. H. F. Giblin, the Government Statist of Tasmania, in his
Budget Inquiry in 1920 (see p. 26 of Main Report) also selected families who were known to be
workers living in reasonable comfort with thrifty management, and that his finding for Hobart
in August, 1920, was £6 per week.
THE FAMILY PROVIDED FOR.
The American Bureau takes a family composed of man, wife, boy of twelve, girl of six,
The Australian Commission took the average ages of three children under fouiteen, and
its family therefore consists of man, wife, boy of ten and a-half, girl oi seven, and boy of three
and a-half.
Food.
in both inquiries scientific material, as well as the results of household budget inquiries,
whs utilized in fixing the quantity of food to be allowed. With regard to the scientific aspect
,f the subiect both inquiries followed the method of first fixing by calories as purchased per man
“ T flav ti p nunimum allowance necessary. In both cases that amount was determined as 3,500
Llnries in eauating the other members of the family to the man, the American Bureau, m
determining co-efficients, utilized laboratory experiments, and made estimates, taking into
account the factors of age, weight, occupation and activity. This Commission, after an
examination of all the available written material dealing with the subject and the opinions of
medical witnesses, adopted as authoritative Atwater’s scale of co-efficients.

than the American allowance, but less dairy products, fruit, and vegetables.
In both inquiries there was a close conformity to the usage of the people in the respective
countries, as shown by analyses of household budgets submitted. They both give the same or
approximately the same, enemy value in calories, and contain proteins, fats, and carbo-hydrates
in sufficient quantities and in the right proportions.

COMPARISON OF THE COST OF THE FOOD REGIMEN.
It is, of course, impossible to directly compare the cost of the two regimens given in the
supplement to this Report. In order to show in some measure the difference in their cost
they have been compared in two ways. The cost of the two regimens has been computed at
American prices*, and also at Australian prices.
Cost at American Prices.
American Regimen. Australian Regimen.
16*71 dollars = £3 9s. Bd. 17*18 dollars = £3 11s. 7d.
Cost at Australian Prices.
American Regimen. Australian Regimen.
£2 7s*. (?d. = 11*41 dollars £2 ss. 6d. = 10 *9l dollars.
i lll A be . Se f. n tbat ; n Am ® rica the American Regimen is cheaper than the Australian,
and that in Australia the Australian Regimen is cheaper than the American Regimen. The
difference in either case is not very great,
HOUSING.
The basis of the Commission’s finding as to amount to be allowed for housing is given on
page 22 of the Report as ' the rental ordinarily paid by the tenant of a five-roomed house in
sound tenantable condition, not actually cramped as to allotment, situated in decent surrounding
and provided with bath, copper and tubs.” ° 5
The American standard lays down for the average family of five persons “ a house of five
rooms consisting of living room, dining room, kitchen and two bedrooms,” but for the standard
family (comprised of husband, wife and three children, boy aged twelve, girl six, and boy two)
it is suggested the following practical arrangement of the house should be adopted Three
bedrooms, a living room, and a combination kitchen and dining room.
It is specified that the house should also contain a bathroom, with toilet arrangements
and proper sanitation and drainage.
It is further stated by the Bureau that the minimum health and decency requirement for
the standard family will necessitate a floor space of approximately 560 square feet or if space is
provided for bathroom, closets, hall, and storage space, the gross area should be 660 square feet
No specific measurements were laid down by the Commission.
In neither case is there any attempt to specify the minimum allotment upon which such n
house should be built.
rnm f Tl f- A " st^ Ha “ Commission, while of the opinion that an allotment of approximately
6,000 feet is in the highest degree desirable, was not prepared, in view of the evidence and of
what was seen during inspections, to lay down such an allotment as indispensable to comfort
{vide Main Report, p. 20).
• Monthly Labour Review (U.S.A.), already cited, at pp. 07-60.


CLOTHING.
Both the American Budget and the Commission’s Indicator Lists follow the method of
giving for each member of the typical family full particulars of the kinds of articles- of clothing
selected, and the duration or time which such articles are expected, on the average, to give reasonable
comfort to their wearers. In each case the objective pursued was to ascertain the necessary
annual replacements. The standard aimed at was the same. The Australian Commission laid
down (p. 29 of Main Report) as requisitesA good wearing quality, disregard of caprice in
fashions, a good appearance, and a limitation to necessary articles, “ giving weight within
sensible limits to the consideration that Australians are a well-dressed community ” (p. 32).
The American Bureau speaks of its standard as follows :* —
The level of health and decency in clothing has been interpreted as a level which not only takes into account
the physical needs of warmth, cleanliness, and comfort, but also has such regard for appearance and
style as will permit the family members to appear in public, and within their necessarily rather narrow
social circle, with neatness and self-respect. In other words, the clothing standards oh the family
are intended to provide a fair degree of that mental satisfaction which follows being reasonably well-
dressed. But, while admitting the desirability of a more generous wardrobe, an effort has been made
to allow only those quantities of clothing consistent with the minimum requirement for health and
decency, and, where a doubt has existed, to err on the side of conservatism. (Monthly Labour Review,
already cited, p. 6.)
The following comparisons may be made
HUSBAND’S CLOTHING.
The general agreement between the two lists is very close. In suits, ties, shirts, collars,
working trousers, overcoat, and umbrella there is entire agreement or only a negligible
difference. .
In only a few cases is the Australian allowance more than the American.
A felt hat in America has to last two years as against one year in Australia, but the American
wearer is in addition provided with a straw hat each year. «
One pair of braces are expected to last a year in America, while in Australia, in addition
to one pair of ordinary braces a year, an additional better pair is allowed, which is to last three
years. On the other hand, the American Budget allows one belt every three years.
In boot repairs an allowance of three half-soles and heels is made for each year in the
Australian List. In the American Budget the allowance is one whole sole and one half-sole
and heel.
The items where the allowance is greater in the American Budget are ■■
Socks. —Twelve pairs (cotton), as against six pairs (wool) in the Australian List.
Underwear.— The American allowance is five suits per year, in Australia two.
Night Attire.- —In America two nightshirts, in Australia one and a half pairs of pyjamas
per year are specified.
Working Boots. —In America two pairs a year, in Australia one and a-half pairs a year.
Sundries. —In the American Budget 7 per cent, of total cost, in the Australian List
1 per cent, of total cost.
There are no items in the Australian List which are not to be found in the American
Budget. The following items appear in the American Budget, but do not appear in the
Australian List —
Gloves (leather), one pair a year.
Gloves (cotton), six pairs a year.
Cap, one a year.
Rubbers, one pair a year.
Garters, two pairs a year.
Cleaning and pressing, one suit a year.
Wife’s Clothing.
Comparisons are more difficult to make in the case of the wife’s clothing than in the case
of the husband’s. The items where the annual number is the same are hats, nightdresses,
umbrellas, and shoes. ■
The annual number of blouses and skirts is more m the Australian List, but it has to
be remembered that the Australian custom of wearing skirts and blouses is recognized, whereas in
America greater provision is made for full dresses.
The only other items for which the provision is greater in the Australian .List than in
the American Budget are aprons, four a year in the Australian as compared with one in the
American, and gloves, two pairs a year, as compared with one and a half pairs.
In all other items, except those enumerated in the two preceding paragraphs, the provision
is greater in the American than in the Australian finding. The difference is only small except
in the case of costumes and dresses, where the duration allowed is two years in the American


regimen as against three years in the Australian ; petticoats, where the Australian finding is
one white and one dark in three years, and the American one white one a year and one clark
one every two years ; wool coat (topcoat), Australian one in four years, American one in three
years. In this latter case, however, a golfer to last three years is specified in the Australian
and not m the American inquiry.
In the American Budget one pair of rubbers a year is allowed, and also an allowance for
cleaning and pressing the wool suit (costume) once a year. These items are not allowed in the
Australian List, but one pair _of slippers, one gossamer, and one, veil per year are allowed in
that List and not in the American.
The allowance for sundries is in the case of the American Budget 8J per cent, of the total
cost of the wife s clothing and m the Australian List 3J per cent.
Eldest Boy’s Clothing.
It has already been stated that the age of the eldest of the three children was fixed in the
American inquiry at twelve years, and in the Australian at ten and a half years. The one and
a halt years difference, however, does not appreciably affect the kind of clothes or the durability
ot them, though m actual practice the smaller size required for the boy of ten and a half as
compared with that required for a boy of twelve would probably be a little less costly
ihe same findings, both as to the article and its duration, is made in both provisions in
the case ol suits, jersey, summer coat (overall), handkerchiefs and ties.
The allowance is greater in the American Budget than in the Commission’s finding for
overcoat, America one in two years, Australia one in three years; pants, America three pairs a
year, Australia two pairs a year; shirts, America five a year, Australia four a year; stockings
America twelve pairs a year (cotton), Australia four pairs a year (wool) ; underwear, America
ve smts a year, Australia two singlets a year; pyjamas, America two pairs a year, Australia
one and a half pairs a year; boots, America five pairs a year, Australia three pairs a year • boot
repairs, America five a year, Australia two a year. *
.The only items in which the Australian finding is greater than the American are head
gear, America two caps a year, Australia one cap and one felt hat each year, and one straw hat
to last two years ; braces, Australia one pair a year, America one belt to‘last two years • collars
Australia three a year, America no allowance.
The American Budget includes two pairs of gloves, one pair of rubbers, and two pairs of
garters (to be made at home) each year, and an allowance for sundries of 3 per cent of total
cost, none of which items appear in the Indicator List of the Commission.
Girl’s Clothing.
The girl provided for in the American Budget is six years of age, in the Commission’s
Report, seven years of age, a difference of one year. It is probable that the requirements of a
girl of six will be of the same kind and cost as that of a girl of seven.
The only it.ems in which there is exact agreement is that of handkerchiefs, where the
number is six a year, and the sweater or jersey, one in two years in both cases. In all other
t e ? 18 .°°“ allowance is greater in the American Budget than in the
Indicator List of the Commission.
The American Budget allows one apron (home made), a pair of rubbers, two pairs of garters
and one pair of gloves a year, items which do not appear in the Indicator Lists of the Commission
r JNo is made for boot repairs in the American Budget, while the allowance in the
Indicator Lists ot the Commission is two repairs a year.
Youngest Child’s' Clothing.
In both cases the third child is assumed to be a boy, but there is again a difference in the
ages , the American child being one of two years of age, and the Australian one of three and a
half years. It is probable that the difference m age in this case will materially affect the kind of
c othing worn, ior instance, the boy of two in America is provided with dresses, rompers, cotton
suits overalls &c., all of which are to be made at home, while the Australian boy of three and
a half is provided with suits.
As already stated, the difference in the age of tjie youngest child makes comparisons between
the garments provided somewhat difficult. In such items as are comparable it will be seen that
for jersey and nightshirts the allowance is the same in both lists.
For all other articles the provision is greater in the American Budget than in the Australian
Ihe items which occur in one list and not in the other are—in the American, mittens one
pair a year, garters two a year, underwaists four a year, and an allowance of 6 per cent, of
the total cost for sundries ; in the Australian, boot repairs one a year, handkerchiefs three
a year, braces one pair a year, collars two a year, blouse coat one a year, and shirts two a year
With regard to boot repairs the American Bureau states that “ for the two younger children
shoe repairing is not considered feasible and provision has not been made for it.”


MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS.
It was found difficult both in America and Australia to prepare a quantity regimen for
many of the items which go to make up what is generally described as miscellaneous expenditure,
and, consequently the only way in which such items can be set out is in the form oi a money
provision.
The list given in the Supplement is self-explanatory, and shows that with the exception
of stationery and stamps, amusements and recreation, and tobacco, m which three divisions tne
estimate is'greater in the Australian than in the American finding, the expencature upon
miscellaneous items is much greater in the American Budget than in the Australian fin mg.
A list has been prepared (see Supplement to this Report), utilizing the Minimum Quantity
Budget and also the Tentative Budget of the American Bureau.
