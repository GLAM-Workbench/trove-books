Revival Hymns
| HAEVEST HOME.
1 rnHIS is the field—the world below,
JL In which the sower came to sow ;
Jesus, the wheat; Satan, the tares;
For so the Word of God declares.
Clio. —And soon the reaping time will come,
And angels shout, “The Harvest Home."
2 Most awful truth J and is it so ?
Must all the world the harvest know ?
Must all before the Judge appear ?
Then for the harvest, oh, prepare.
Cho. —For soon, &c.
3 To love my sins—a saint to appear—
To grow with wheat, and bo a tare —
May serve mo while on earth below,
Where tares and wheat together grow.
Cho, —But soon, &c,
4 But all who are from sin set free,
Their Father’s kingdom soon shall see J
Shine like the sun for ever there:
He that hath ears, then, let him hear.
Cho, —For soon, &c.
54 NOT ASHAMED OF CUEIST,
1 TESUS I and can it ever be
That I should be ashamed of Thee \
Ashamed of Thee ? whom angels praise,
Whose glories shine through endless days.
A 2


2 Ashamed of Jesus? Sooner far
Let evening blush to own a star :
He sheds the beams of light divine
O’er this benighted soul of mine.
3 Ashamed of Jesus ? Just as soon
Let midnight be ashamed of noon ;
’Tis midnight in my soul till He,
Bright morning star, bids darkness flee.
4 Ashamed of Jesus? That dear friend
On whom my hopes of heaven depend.
No; when I blush be this my shame,
That I no more revere His name.
5 Ashamed of Jesus ? Yes, I may,
When I’ve no guilt to wash away—
No tears to wipe, no good to crave,
No fears to hush, no soul to save.
6 Till then—nor is my boasting vain—
Till then I boast a Saviour slain:
And oh, may this my glory be,
Jesus is not ashamed of me.
THE LIFE LOOK.
1 rnHKllL is a fountain filled with blood,
JL Drawn from Immanuel’s veins,
And sinners plunged beneath that flood
Lose all their guilty stains.
Cko. —I do believe, I will believe,
That Jesus died for mo ;
That on the cross Ho shed His blood,
From sin to set me free.
2 The dying thief rejoiced to see
That fountain in his day;
And there have I, as vile as be.
Wash’d all my sins away.


3 Dear dying Lamb, Thy precious blood
Shall never lose its power,
Till all the ransom’d Church of God
Be saved, to sin no more.
4 E’er since by faith I saw the stream
Thy flowing wounds supply,
Redeeming love has been my theme,
And shall be till I die.
5 Then in a nobler, sweeter song,
I’ll sing Thy power to save.
When this poor lisping, stammering tongue,
Lies silent in the grave.
4 COME TO JUDGMENT.
1 milE blast of the trumpet, so loud and so shrill,
JL Will shortly re-echo o’er ocean and hill;
When tho mighty, mighty, mighty trump sounds,
“Como, come away,”
Oh may wo be ready to hail that glad day !
2 The earth and the waters will yield up the dead.
The righteous with joy shall awake from their bed.
3 The chorus of angels will burst from tho skies,
And blend with the shouts of the saints as they rise.
4 The cry of the lost ones, the yell of despair,
And loud Hallelujahs, will meet in tho air.
5 The throne of Messiah in clouds will descend,
And voices like thunder tho heavens will rend.
6 The cry of the Bridegroom will echo around.
And the bride in her beauty go forth at the sound.
7 Acknowledged by Jesus, confess’d as Hi$ own,
Transported to glory we’ll sit on His throno.
8 0 land of the holy, the happy, the free,
In Jesus Thy portals are open to me


5 THE SINNER’S ONLY PLEA.
1 *TUST as I am, without one plea
t) But that Thy blood was shed for me,
And that Thou bid’st me come to Thee,
0 Lamb of God, I come.
2 Just as I am. and waiting not
To rid my soul of one dark blot;
To Thee, whose blood can cleanse each spot,
0 Lamb of God, I come.
3 Just as I am, though tossed about
"With many a conflict, many a doubt,
Fightings within and fears without,
0 Lamb of God, I come.
4 Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind;
Sight, riches, healing of the mind,
Yea, all I need in Thee to find,
0 Lamb of God, I come.
6 Just as I am, Thou wilt receive,
Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve;
Because Thy promise I believe,
0 Lamb of God, I come.
6 Just as I am, Thy love unknown
Has broken every barrier down;
Now to be Thine, yea, Thine alone,
0 Lamb of God, I come*
C HOMEWARD BOUND.
1 /"\UT on an ocean all boundless we ride,
V/ We’re homeward bound;
Tossed on the waves of a rough restless tid$,
We’re homeward bound.
Far from the safe, quiet harbour we’ve rode,
Seeking our Fathers celestial abode,
Promise of which on us each He bestowed,
We’re homeward bound#


2 Wildly the storm sweeps us on as it roars,
We’re homeward bound;
Look! yonder lie the bright heavenly shores,
We’re homeward bound.
Steady, 0 Pilot! stand firm at the wheel;
Steady! wo soon shall outweather the gale;
Oh, how we fly ’noath the loud-creaking sail,
We’re homeward bound.
8 We’ll tell the world as we voyage along,
We’re homeward bound ;
Try and persuade them to enter our throng ;
We’re homeward bound.
Come, trembling sinner, forlorn and opprest,
Join in our passage ; oh, come and be blest ;
Journey with us to the mansions of rest;
We’re homeward bound.
4 Into the harbour of heaven now we glide ;
We’re home at last;
Softly wo drift on its bright silver tide;
We’re home at last.
Glory to God! all our dangers are o’er,
We stand secure on the glorified shore;
Glory to God ! wo will shout evermore.
We’re home at last.
1 THE BLEEDING LAMB.
1 TN evil long I took delight,
X Unawed by shame or fear.
Till a new object met ray sight,
And stopp’d my wild career.
Cho. —Oh ! the Lamb, the bleeding Lamb,
The Lamb on Calvary,
The Lamb that was slain,
But liveth again.
To intercede for me.


2 I saw One banging on a tree,
In agonies and blood,
Who fixed his languid eyes on mo,
As near His cross I stood.
3 Sure, never till ray latest breath
Can I forget that look;
It seemed to charge me with His death,
Though not a word He spoke.
4 My conscience felt and owned my guilt,
And plunged me in despair ;
I saw my sins His blood had spilt,
And helped to nail Him there.
5 A second look He gave, which said,
(t 1 freely all forgive ;
This blood is for thy ransom paid—
I die that thou may’st live.”
8 THE EDEN ABOVE.
1 XTTE’RE bound for the land of tho pure and the
VV holy,
The home of the happy, tho kingdom of love;
Ye wand’rers from (lod in the broad road of folly,
Oh say, will you go to the Eden above ?
Will you to? will you go ? will you go ? will you
Oh say, will you go to tho Eden above ? [go ?
2 In that blessed land neither sighing nor anguish
Can breathe in tho fields where tho glorified rove ;
Ye heart-burden’d ones, who in misery languish,
Oh say, will you go to the Eden above ?
3 No poverty there -no, tho saints are all wealthy,
The heirs of His glory whose nature is love ;,
No sickness can reach them—that country is healthy;
Oh say, will yon go to the Eden above ?


4 Each saiut has a mansion prepared and all furnished,
Ere from this clay house ho is summoned to move ;
Its gates and its towers with e:lory aro burnished ;
Oh say, will you go to the Eden above ?
5 March on, happy pilgrims, tbo land is before you,
And soon its ten thousand delights yo. shall prove;
Yes, soon ye shall walk o’er the hills of bright glory,
And drink the pure joys of the Eden above !
We will go, we will go, wo will go, wo will go ;
Oh yes, we will go to the Eden above.
J) NEARER HOME.
1 T?OR ever with the Lord,
jD Amen, so let it be.
Life from the dead is in that word :
’Tis immortality.
Clio. —Here in the body pent,
Absent from Him I roam ;
Yet nightly pitch my moving tent
A day’s march nearer homo.
!2 My Father’s house on high,
Home of my soul, how near
At times to faith’s far-seeing eye
Thy golden gates appear.
3 My thirsty spirit faints
To reach the land I love.
The bright inheritance of saints,
Jerusalem above.
4 For ever with the Lord !
Father, if ’tis Thy will,
The promise of that faithful word
E’en hero to me fulfil.
5 So when my latest breath
Shall rend the veil in twain,
By death 1 shall escape from dealh,
And life eternal gain. MONTGOMERY.


10 HOME IN PROSPECT.
1 T’M but a stranger here,
X Hoav’n is my homo;
Earth is a desert drear,
Heav’n is my home.
Danger and sorrow stand
Round me on every hand,
Heaven is my fatherland—
Heav’n is my home.
2 What though the tempest rage,
Heav’n is my home;
Short is my pilgrimage,
Heav’n is my home.
And Time’s wild wintry blast
Soon will be overpast,
I shall reach home at last;
Heav’n is my home.
3 There, at my Saviour’s side,
Heav’n is my home;
I shall be glorified,
Hcav’n is my homo;
There with the good and blest,
Those I love most and best,
I shall for ever rest,
Heav’n is my home.
4 Therefore I murmur not,
Heav’n is my home;
Whate’er my earthly lot,
Heav’n is my home.
For I shall surely stand
There at my Lord’s right hand;
Heaven is my fatherland,
Hcav’n is my home.
|| THE BETTER WORLD.
1 rpHERE is a better world they say,
X Oh, so bright 1


Where sin and woe are done away,
Oh, so bright!
And music fills the balmy air,
And angels with bright wings are there,
And harps of gold and mansions fair,
Oh, so bright!
2 No clouds e’er pass along its sky,
Happy land!
No tear-drops glisten in the eye.
Happy land!
They drink the gushing streams of grace,
And gaze upon the Saviour’s face.
Whose brightness fills the holy place,
Happy land!
8 Then parents, brothers, sisters, come.
Come away !
We long to reach our father’s home.
Come away!
0 come —the time is fleeting past,
And men and things are fading fast;
Our turn shall surely come at last,
Come away.
4 This world is oft so dark and drear,
Take us there !
We ne’er can be so happy here,
Take us there!
Oh, listen to the music sweet,
It comes so rich from yonder seat,
Where all the good in glory meet,
Take us there.
\% THE CHRISTIAN SOLDIER.
New Convert's Hymn .
1 A Mia soldier of the cross,
jClu A follower of the Lamb?
And shall I fear to own His cause,
Or blush to speak His name?


Cho. —Let us never mind the scoffs and the frowns of
the world,
For wo all have a cross to bear;
It will only make the crown the brighter to shine
When we have a crown to wear,
2 Are there no foes for mo to face?
Must I not stem the flood ?
Is this vile world a friend to grace,
To help me on to God ?
3 Must 1 be carried to the skies
On flowery beds of ease,
While others fought to win the prize,
And sailed through bloody seas?
4 Sure I must fight if I would reign—
Increase my courage, Lord!
I’ll bear the toil, endure the pain,
Supported by Thy w T ord.
5 Thy saints, in all this glorious war,
Shall conquer, though they’re slain:
They view the triumph from afar,
And shall with Jesus reign.
13 THY WILL BE DONE.
1 "IV/TY God, my Father, while I stray,
1V1 Far from my home on life’s rough way,
Oh, teach me from my heart to say,
“Thy will be done?”
2 If Thou should’st call me to resign
What most I prize, it ne'er was mine;
I only yield Thee what was Thine—
Thy will be done;
3 Though dark my path, and sad my lot,
Let me bo still and murmur not,
But breathe the prayer Thyself hast taught—
Thy will be done!


4 What though in lonely grief I sigh
For friends beloved, no longer nigh,
Submissive still I would reply—
Thy will be done !
6 Should pining sickness waste away
My life in premature decay,
My Father, still I’ll strive to say,
Thy will be done !
6 Renew my will from day to day;
Blend it with Thine, and take away
All that now makes it hard to say,
Thy will be done !
7 Then, when on earth I breathe no more
The prayer oft mix’d with tears before,
I’ll sing upon a happier shore,
Thy will be done!
|4 MY FATHER KNOWS.
1 T’M a pilgrim and a stranger;
j_ Hough and thorny is the road,
Often in the midst of danger,
But it leads to God.
Clouds and darkness oft distress me,
Great and many are my foes ;
Anxious cares and thoughts oppress me,
But my Father knows.
2 Oh, how sweet is this assurance,
’Midst the conflict and the strife ;
Although sorrows past endurance
Follow me through life—
Horae in prospect still can cheer me.
Yes, and give me sw r eot repose.
While I feel His presence near me,
For my Father knows.


3 Yes, He sees and knows me daily
Watches over me in love ;
Sends me help when foes assail me,
Bids me look above.
Soon my journey will be ended,
Life is drawing to a close:
I shall then be well attended,
This my Father knows.
4 I shall then with joy behold Him,
Face to face my Father see ;
Fall with rapture and adore him,
For His love to mo.
Nothing more shall then distress me,
In the land of sweet repose :
Jesus stands engaged to bless me,
This my Father knows.
|5 SWEET REST IN HEAVEN.
1 mHOUGH often here we’re weary,
I There is sweet rest above;
A rest that is eternal,
"Where all is peace and love.
Oh, lot us then press forward.
That glorious rest to gain;
We’ll soon be free from sorrow,
From toil, and care, and pain.
There is sweet rest in heaven.
2 Lov’d ones have gone before us.
They beckon us away ;
O’er heavenly plains they’re soaring
Blest in eternal day.
But we are in the army.
And dare not leave our post;
We’ll fight until wo conquer
The foe’s most mighty host.
There is sweet rest in heaven.


3 All glory to the Father,
"Who gives us every good;
All glory be to Jesus,
Who bought us with His blood;
And glory to the Spirit,
Who keeps us to the end;
Unto our God be glory,
The sinner’s only friend.
There is sweet rest in heaven,
1(> PERFECT LOVE.
1 'VT'E who know your sins forgiven, and are happy
I in the Lord,
Have you read the precious promise, which He left
you in His Word — [make you clean;
“ I will sprinkle you with water; I will cleanse and

17 HOME, SWEET HOME.
1 ? 1\/¥ ID scenes of confusion and creature com-
Jj/JL plaints,
How sweet to my soul is communion with saints;
To find at the banquet of mercy there’s room,
And feel in the presence of Jesus at home.
Cho.~ Home, home, sweet, sweet, home;
There’s no friend like Jesus,
There’s no place like home,
2 Sweet bonds that unite all the children of grace,
And thrice-blessed Jesus, whose love cannot cease;
Though now my tempations like billows may foam,
All, all will be peace when I’m with Thee at home.
3 Whate’er Thou deniest, oh, give me Thy grace.
The Spirit’s sure witness, the smiles of Thy face ;
Indulge me with patience to wait till Thou come,
And give me, 0 Lord, a sweet foretaste of home.
4 I long, gracious Lord, in Thy presence to be,
From sin, fear, and sorrow for ever set free;
And when in Thy likeness I rise from the tomb,
With glorified millions I’ll praise Thco at home.
18 THE LION OF JUDAH.
1 *]\/fY rest is in heaven, my rest is not here,
JLVJL Then why should I mui mur when trials are near I
Bo hush’d, my sad spirit; the worst that can come.
But shortens the journey, and hastens me home.
Cko. —For the Lion of Judah shall break every chain,
And give us the vict’ry again and again.


2 It is not for mo to be seeking my bliss
And building my hopes in a region like this;
I look for a city which hands have not piled,
I look for a country by sin undefiled.
3 The winds of affliction around me may blow,
And dash my lone bark as I'm sailing below;
I smile at the storm as I lean on His breast;
And soon I shall land in the haven of rest.
•I Let trial and danger my progress oppose—
They’ll only make heaven more sweet at the close ;
Come joy or come sorrow, whate’er may befall,
A home with my God will make up for it all.
5 With Christ in my heart, and His Word in my hand,
I’ll march on in haste through an enemy’s land;
The road may seem rough, but it cannot be long.
So I’ll march along singing the conqueror’s song.
19 OH, THE BLOOD OF JESUS.
1 TJEHOLT) the Saviour of mankind,
JD Nail’d to the shameful tree;
How vast the love that Him inclined
To bleed and die for thee. [Jesus,
Cho. —Oh, the blood of Jesus, the precious blood of
Oh, the blood of Jesus, that washes white as snow;
My soul is fired with strong desire
To sec Jerusalem:
A city bright appears in sight,
Whose maker is the Lamb.
2 Hark how He groans, while nature shakes,
And earth’s strong pillars bend;
The Temple’s veil in sunder breaks,
The solid marbles rend.
3 ’Tis done ! the precious ransom’s paid,
“Receive my soul,” Fie cries;
See whero Ho bows His sacred head,
He bows His head and dies.


4 But soon He’ll break death’s envious chain,
And in full glory shine;
0 Lamb of God, was ever pain,
Was ever love like Thine ?
20 the pilgrim’s joy.
1 T'Ma pilgrim bound for glory,
JL I’m a pilgrim going homo ;
Come and hear me tell my story—
All who love the Saviour, come.
Cho. —I love Jesus ; hallelujah!
I love Jesus—yes, I do;
I love Jesus—Ho’s my Saviour ;
Jesus smiles, and loves me too.
2 1 will tell you what induced mo
For tho better land to start:
’Twas the Saviour’s loving-kindnesa
Overcame and won my heart.
3 When I first commenced my journey,
Many said, t( He’ll turn again
But they all have been deceived,
In the way I still remain.
i Many years have now elapsed
Since I first began to pray—
I have been in many a conflict,
And am here alive to-day,
5 Soon to Jordan’s swelling river
Like a pilgrim I shall come;
Then I hope to shout salvation,
And go singing glory homo.
21 the saints’ future home.
1 TTTE dwell this side of Jordan’s stream,
YY Yet oft there comes a shining beam
Across from yonder shore;


Whilst visions of a holy throng,
And sound of harp and seraph song,
Seem gently wafted o’er.
2 The other side—no sin is there
To stain the robes the blest ones wear,
Made whito in Jesus’ blood;
No cry of grief, no voice of woe,
Can mar the peace their spirits know,
Their perfect peace with God.
3 The other side—its shore so bright
Is radiant with the golden light
Of Zion’s city fair;
And many dear ones gone before
Already tread the happy shore :
I seem to see them there.
4 The other side—oh, cheering sight,
Upon its banks array’d in white,
Forme a loved One waits;
Over the stream He calls to me,
<c Fear not—1 am thy guide to be
Up to the pearly gates.”
5 The other side —the other side—
Who would not bravo the swelling tide
Of earthly toil and care,
To dwell one day when life is past,
Over the stream, at homo at last,
With all the loved ones there ?
22 ON THE CROSS,
1 T)EHOLD, behold'tho Lamb of God
JD On tho cross.
For us Ho shed His precious blood,
On tho cross.
Oh, hear this all-important cry,
“Eloi, lama sabacthani!”
Draw near and see your Saviour die,
On tho cross.


2 Behold His arms extended wide.
On the cross.
Behold His bleeding hands and side,
On the cross.
The sun withholds his rays of light,
The heavens are clothed in shades of night,
While Jesus does with devils fight.
On the cross.
3 Come, sinners, see Him lifted up,
On the cross.
He drinks for you the'bitter cup,
On the cross.
The rocks do rend, the mountains quake,
While Jesus doth atonement make—
While Jesus suffers for our sake,
On the cross.
4 And now the mighty deed is done,
On the cross.
The battle’s fought, the victory’s won,
On the cross.
To heaven He turns His languid eyes,
“’Tis finished,” now the Conqueror cries,
Then bows His sacred head and dies, ,
On the cross.
5 Where’er I go I’ll tell the story
Of the cross.
In nothing else my soul shall glory,
Save the cross.
Yea, this my constant theme shall be,
Through time and in eternity,
That Jesus tasted death for me
On the cross.
S3 WHAT TO BELIEVE.
1 A LB ye that pass by,
XX To Jesus draw nigh :
To you is it nothing that Jesus should die ?


Your ransom and peace,
Your surety Ho is ;
Como, see if there ever was sorrow like His.
2 For what you have done,
His blood must atone :
The Father hath punish’d for you His dear Son.
The Lord, in the day
Of His anger, did lay
Your sins on the Lamb; and Ho bore them away.
3 He answer’d for all;
O come at His call.
And low at His cross with astonishment fall.
But lift up your eyes
At Jesus’s cries:
Impassive, He suffers ; immortal, He dies.
4 He dies to atone
For sins not His own ;
Your debt He hath paid, and your work He hath
Ye all may receive [done.
The peace He did leave,
Who made intercession, “My Father, forgive !”
5 For you and for me
He pray’d on the tree :
The prayer is accepted, the sinner is free.
That sinner am I,
Who on Jesus rely,
And come for the pardon God cannot deny.
G My pardon I claim,
For a sinner I am ;
A sinner believing in Jesus’s Name.
He purchased the grace
Which now I embrace;
0 Father, Thou know’st He hath died in my place.
7 His death is my plea ;
My Advocate see, [mo.
And hear the blood speak that hath answer’d for


Acquitted I was
When He bled on the cross ;
And by losing His life He hath carried my cause.
CHARLES WESLEY.
24 GOD IS SAVING.
1 Q< EE how great a flame aspires,
IO Kindled by a spark of grace!
Jesu’s love the nations fires,
Sets the kingdoms on a blaze :
To bring fire on earth He came ;
Kindled in some hearts it is :
0 that all might catch the flame,
All partake the glorious bliss.
2 When He first the work began.
Small and feeble was His day;
Now the word doth swiftly run.
Now it wins its widening way;
More and more it spreads and grows,
Ever mighty to prevail;
Sin’s strong-holds it now o’erthrows,
Shakes the trembling gates of hell.
3 Sons of God, your Saviour praise!
He the door hath open’d wide;
He hath given the word of grace,
Jesu’s word is glorified. *
Jesus, mighty to redeem,
He alone the work hath wrought;
Worthy is the work of Him,
Him who spake a world from nought.
4 Saw ye not the cloud arise.
Little as a human hand ?
Now it spreads along the skies.
Hangs o’er all the thirsty land :
Lo ! the promise of a shower
Drops already from above;
But the Lord will shortly pour
. ii ii . n (• tt. . i ■ _
All the Spirit of His love !
CHAS. WESLEY.


25 my JESUS, I LOVE THEE.
1 IV/TY Jesus, I love Thee, I know Thou art mine;
i-VX For Thee all the pleasures of siu I resign;
My gracious Redeemer, my Saviour art Thou,
If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus, ’tis now.
2 I love Thee because Thou hast first loved me,
And purchas’d my pardon when nail’d to the tree.
I love Thee for wearing the thorns on Thy brow;
If ever I lov’d Thee, my Jesus, ’tis now.
3 I love Thee because of Thy sorrows and tears.
Thy groans in the garden to banish my fears ;
Thou earnest from heaven to save me from woe—
If ever I lov’d Thee, my Jesus, ’tis now.
4 I love Thco in life, may I love Thee in death;
I’ll praise Thee as long as Thou lendest me breath,
And say, when the death-dew is seen on my brow,
“ If ever I lov’d Thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.”
5 In mansions of glory and endless delight,
I’ll ever adore Thco, in the heaven of light;
And sing, with a glittering crown on my brow,
“If ever I lov’d Thee, my Jesus, ’tis now.”
6 I'll tell of Thy love to the angelic throng,
And join the bright host in the heavenly song,
And shout at Thy feet while I humbly bow,
“ If ever I lov’d Thee, my Jesus, ’tis now.”
26 THE BELIEVER’S UNFAILING FRIEND.
1 mHERE’S a Friend above all others—
JL Oh, how Ho loves.
His love is beyond a brother’s—
Oh, how He loves.
Earthly friends may fail and leave us ;
One day kind, the next deceive us,
But this Friend will never leave us—
Oh, how He loves.


2 Blessed Jesus! would’st thou know Him ?
Oh, how Ho loves.
Give thyself this moment to Him —
Oh, how fie loves.
Best of blessings He’ll provide thee,
Nought but good shall e’er betide thee,
Safe to glory He will guide thee —
Oh, how He loves.
3 Tis eternal life to know Him—
Oh, how He loves.
Think, oh think, how much we owe Him--
Oh, how Ho loves.
With his precious blood He bought us,
In the wilderness He sought us,
To His fold Ho safely brought us—
Oh; how He loves.
4 Let us then His love keep viewing—
Oh, how He loves.
And tho’ faint keep on pursuing—
Oh, how He loves.
He will strengthen each endeavour,
And when passed o’er Jordan’s river,

28 PRAYER,
1 “pRAYER is the soul’s sincere desire,
JT Utter’d or unexpress’d :
The motion of a hidden fire,
That trembles in the breast.
2 Prayer is the burden of a sigh,
The falling of a tear,
The upward glancing of the eye,
When none but God is near.
3 Prayer is the simplest form of speech
That infant lips can try:
Prayer, the sublimest strains that reach
The Majesty on high.
4 Prayer is the Christian’s vital breath,
The Christian’s native air :
His watchword at the gates of death :
He enters Heaven by prayer.
6 Prayer is the contrite sinner’s voice,
Upturning from his ways:
While angels in their songs rejoice,
And cry, "Behold, ho prays.”
6 The saints in prayer appear as one,
In word, in deed, in mind ;
While with the Father and the Son,
Sweet fellowship they find.


7 Nor prayer is made on earth alone —
The Holy Spirit pleads;
And Jesus, on th’ eternal throne.
For mourners intercedes.
8 0 Thou by whom we come to God,
The Life, the Truth, the Way,
The path of prayer Thyself hast trod:
Lord, teach us how to pray.

That heavenly mansion shall be mine.


CAo,—I*m going homo—Fm going home—

To die no more—to die no more—

Far, far above the starry sky;
When from this earthly prison free
That heavenly mansion mine shall be.
3 While here, a stranger far from home.
Affliction’s waves may round me foam;
And though, like Lazarus, sick and poor,
My heavenly mansion is secure.

And sun and moon refuse to shine,
All nature sink and cease to be—
That heavenly mansion stands for me.

Steps unto heaven :
All that thou sendest me,
In mercy given,


Angels to beckon me
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee.
4 Then, with my waking thoughts
Bright with Thy praise,
Out of my stony griefs
Bethel i’ll raise:
So by my woes to be
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee.
5 And when on joyful wing,
Cleaving tho sky—
Sun, moon, and stars forgot,
Upward I fly—
Still all ray song shall be,

32 CONFLICT OR PRAYER ANSWERED BY CROSSES.
*■1 great favourite of the late Mrs. Burnett. L.M.
1 X ASK’D the Lord that I might grow
_L la faith, and love, and cv’ry grace ;
Might more of His salvation know,
And seek more earnestly His face.
2 ’Twas He who taught me thus to pray,
And He, I trust, has answered prayer ;
But it has been in such a way
As almost drove me to despair.
3 I hop’d that in some favoured hour
At once He’d answer my request,
And by His love’s constraining power
Subdue my sins, and give me rest.
4 Instead of this, He made me feel
The hidden evils of my heart;
And lot the angry powers of hell
Assault roy soul in ev’ry part.


5 Yea, more, with His own hand He seem’d
Intent to aggravate my woe ;
Cross’d all the fair designs I schem’d,
Blasted my gourds, and laid me low.
6 "Lord, why is this?” I trembling cried ;
" Wilt thou pursue Thy worm to death ?”
"’Tisinthis way,” the Lord replied,
"I answer prayer for grace and faith.
7 "These inward trials I employ,
From self and pride to sot thee free;
And break thy schemes of earthly joy.
That thou rnay’st seek thy all in Me.”
JOHN NEWTON.

Bowing at the Saviour’s feet— Cho*
34 SECOND COMING OF CHRIST.
(Tune —“ Ilelmsley .”)
IT 0 ! He comes with clouds descending,
1 J Once for favoured dinners slain ;
Thousand, thousand saints attending,
Swell the triumph of his train:
Hallelujah! God appears on earth to reign.
2 Every eye shall now behold Him
Robed in dreadful majesty;
Those who set at nought and sold Him,
Pierced and nail’d Him to the tree,
Deeply wailing, shall the true Messiah see.
3 Tho dear tokens of His passion,
Still His dazzling body bears ;
Cause of endless exultation
To His ransom’d worshippers :
With what rapture gaze we on those glorious scars 1
4 Yea, Amen ! let all adore Thee,
High on Thy eternal throne:
Saviour, take the power and glory ;
Claim the kingdom for thine own I

JL ) Mercy still reserved for me ?
Can my God His wrath forbear '{
Mo, tho chief of sinners, spare ?
I have long withstood His grace,
Long provoked Him to His face j


Would not harken to His calls ;
Grieved Him by a thousand falls.
Cho. —God is love, I know, I feel;
Jesus weeps, and loves mo still;
Jesus weeps—He weeps, and loves me still.
2 I have spilt His precious blood,
Trampled on the Son of God ;
Fill’d with pangs unspeakable !
I, who yot am not in hell!
Whence to me this waste of love !
Ask my Advocate above ;
See the cause in Jesu’s face,
Now before the throne of grace.— Cho.
3 Lo ! I cumber still the ground :
Lo! an Advocate is found !
u Hasten not to cut him down;
Let this barren soul alone
Jesus speaks, and pleads His blood !
He disarms the wrath of God !
Now my Father’s bowels move;
Justice lingers into love. —Cho.
4 Kindled His relentings are;
Mo He now delights to spare;
Cries, “ How shall I give thee up ?”
Lets the lifted thunder drop.
There for mo the Saviour stands:
Shows His wounds, and spreads His hand* !
God is love ! I know, I feel;
Jesus weeps, and loves me still! — Cho.
5 Jesus, answer from above ;
Is not all Thy nature love ?
Wilt Thou not the wrong forget ?
Suffer me to kiss Thy feet ?
If I rightly read Thy heart,
If Thou all compassion art.
Bow Thine ear, in mercy bow !
Pardon and accept me now,— Ch*.


6 Pity from Thine eye let fall;
By a look my soul recall;
Now the stone to flesh convert—
Cast a look, and break ray heart.
Now incline mo to repent;
Let me now my fall lament;
Now my foul revolt deplore;
Weep, believe, and sin no more.— Cho.

36 JOYFULLY, JOYFULLY.
1 TOYFULLY, joyfully, onward we move,
i) Bound for the land of bright spirits above ;
Jesus our Saviour in mercy says, “ Come;
Joyfully, joyfully haste to your home.”
Soon will our pilgrimage end here below,
Soon to the presence of God we shall go ;
Then if to Jesus our hearts have been given,
Joyfully, joyfully, rest we in heaven.
2 Death with his arrow may soon lay us low,
Safe in our Saviour we fear not the blow ;
Jesus has broken the bars of the tomb,
Joyfully, joyfully we will go home !
Bright will the morn of eternity dawn,
Death shall be conquer’d, his sceptre be gone;
Over the plains of sweet Canaan we’ll roam,
Joyfully, joyfully, safely at home !
3 Friends fondly cherish’d have passed on before ;
Waiting, they watch us approaching the shore,
Singing to cheer us while passing along,
“ Joyfully, joyfully, haste to your home.”
Sounds of sweet melody fall on the ear ;
Harps of the blessed, your strains we can hear,
Filling with harmony heaven’s high dome,
Joyfully, joyfully, Jesus, we come !


3T THE first saint in heaven.
(P.M. Tunc—“ Jfotgnte.")
1 mEN thousand times ten thousand sung
I Their anthems round the throne,
When, lo! one solitary tongue
Began a song unknown ;
A song unknown to angels’ ears,
A song that spoke of banish’d fears,
Of pardon’d sins, of dried-up tears.
2 Not one of all that heavenly host
Could such high notes attain;
But spirits from a distant coast
United in the strain :
Till he who first began the song,
To sing alone not suffered long,
Was mingled in a countless throng.
3 And still, as hours are fleeting by,
The angels ever bear
Some newly-ransom’d soul on high,
To join the chorus there.
And still the song will louder grow,
Till all the saved by Christ below
To that fair world of rapture go.
4 0, give me. Lord, my golden harp,
And tune my broken voice,
That I may sing of troubles sharp
Exchanged for endless joys.
The song that ne’er was heard before,
A sinner reach’d the heavenly shore,
Shall now be sung for evermore.

40 ON THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST. D.L.M.
(Tune —“ Ye Banks and Braes.")
1 TTE dies ! the Friend of sinners dies!
XX Lo ! Salem’s daughters weep around!
A solemn darkness veils the skies,
A sudden trembling shakes the ground.
Come, saints, and drop a tear or two
On the dear bosom of your God ;
He shed a thousand drops for you.
A thousand drops of richer blood.
2 Here’s life and grief beyond degree—
The Lord of glory dies for men!
But, lo ! what sudden joys I see—
Jesus, the dead, revives again !
The rising God forsakes the tomb,
The tomb in vain forbids His rise ;
Cherubic legions guard Him home,
And shout Him welcome to the skies.
3 Break off your tears, ye saints, and tell
How high your groat Deliverer reigns ;
Sing how He spoil’d the hosts of hell,
And laid the monster death in chains.
Sing, “ Live for ever, wondrous King,
Born to redeem, and strong to save.”
Then ask the monster, “ Where’s thy sting ?”
And, u Whore’s thy victory, boasting grave ?”
DR. WATTS.
41 HAPPY DAY.
• 1 T ’M glad 1 ever saw the day
I When first I learn’d to sing and pray.
’Tis glory’s foretaste makes me sing,
And praise my Saviour and my King.
Happy day, happy day
When Jesus took my sins away.
He taught me how to watch and pray,
And go rejoicing on my way.
Happy day, happy day,
When Jesus took my sins away.


2 1 hope to love Him till I die.
Then shout His praises in the sky ;
I’ll publish in the courts above
The triumphs of redeeming love.
3 A few more rising suns at most,
And we shall join the ransom’d host ;
Upon Mount Zion we shall meet,
And cast our crowns at Jesus’ feet.
4 Come, sinners, come along with us,
And taste the joys of holiness ;
Ilepent, and run the heavenly race,
And seek the aid of saving grace.

We’ve cast our distant lot;
Yet still we’d share the distant hope
Which Jesus’ grace has given —

Wc all shall meet in heaven.
3 No ling’ring look, no parting sigh,

And love immortal glows.

43 NO NAME LIKE JESUS.
(Tune —“ French”)
1 npHEHE is a name I love to hear ;
I I love to speak its worth ;
It sounds like music in mine car;
The sweetest name on earth.
2 It tells mo of a Saviour’s love,
Who died to set mo free ;
It tells me of His precious blood,
The sinner’s perfect plea.
3 It tells of One whose loving heart
Can feel my deepest woe ;
Who in my sorrow bears a part
That none can bear below.
4 Jesus, the name I love so well,
The name I love to hear;
No saint on earth its worth can tell,
No heart conceive how dear.
5 This name shall shed its fragrance still
Along this thorny road,
Shall sweetly smooth the rugged hill
That leads mo up to God.
6 And there, with all the blood-bought throng,
From sin and sorrow free,
I’ll sing the new eternal song
Of Jesus’ love to me.

But turn not thy back, for no armour is there ;
The legions of darkness, if thou would’st o’erthrow,
Then stand like the brave, with thy face to the foe.
3 The cause of thy Master with vigour defend,
Be watchful, be zealous, and fight to the end ;
Wherever He leads thee, go valiantly, go,
And stand like the brave, with thy face to the foe.
4 Pass on, never doubting ; thy Captain is near.
With grace to supply, and with comfort to cheer.
His love, like a stream, in the desert will flow ;
Then stand like the bravo, with thy face to the foe.

Cease, fond nature ; cease thy strife ;
And let me languish into life.
2 Hark ! they whisper; angels say,
“ Sister spirit, come away !”
What is this absorbs me quite.
Steals my senses, shuts my sight,
Drowns my spirit, draws my breath—
Tell me, my soul, can this be death ?
3 The world recedes—it disappears;
Heaven opens on my eyes ; my ears
With sounds seraphic ring.
Lend, lend your wings ; I mount, I fly,
0 grave, where is thy victory ?
0 death, where ig thy sting ?

1 Q1 WEET hour of prayer ! sweet hour of prayer !

Make all my wants and wishes known.

My soul has often found relief,
And oft escaped the tempter’s snare,
By thy return, sweet hour of prayer!

The joy I feel, the bliss I share,
Of those whose anxious spirits burn
With strong 1 desire for thy return.
With such I hasten to the place
Where God my Saviour shows His face,
And gladly take my station there
To wait for the sweet hour of prayer !
3 Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer !
Thy wings shall my petition bear
To Him whose truth and faithfulness
Engage the waiting soul to b'ess ;
And since He bids me seek His face,
Believe His Word, and trust His grace,
I’ll cast on Him my every care,
And wait for the sweet hour of prayer!
4 Sweet hour of prayer! sweet 1 our of prayer!
May I tby consolations share?
Till, from Mount Pisgah’s lofty height,
I view my heaven, and at the sight,
Put off this robe of flesh, and rise
To gain the everlasting prize,
And realise for ever there
The fruits of the sweet hour of prayer.

To hide Thee from Thy servant’s eyes.


2 When the soft dews of kindly sjeep
My wearied eyelids gently steep.
Be my last thought, how sweet to rest
For ever on my Saviour’s breast.
3 Abide with me from morn till eve,
For without Thee I cannot live ;
Abide with me when night is nigh,
For without Thee I dare not die.

Has spurned to-day the voice divine;
Now, Lord, the gracious work begin,
Let him no more lie down in sin.

Ere through the world our way we take ;
Till, in the ocean of Thy love,
We find ourselves in heaven above.

Over on the shining shore,
We will walk about the city,
And we’ll sing for evermore.

It ne’er has known the shades of night;
The glory of God, the light of day,
Hath driven the darkness far away.
VVill you go to th,at beautiful land ?

Its beautiful gates I too behold,
The river of life, the crystal sea,
The ambrosial fruit of life’s fair tree.

In rapture range the plains of light;
And in one harmonious choir, they praise
Their glorious Saviour’s matchless grace.
Will you go to that beautiful land?

4 And when our warfare here is o’er,
Battling for the Lord;
This strife we’ll leave, and war no more,
Battling for the Lord.
5 And friends and kindred there we’ll meet,
Cn the heavenly shore ;
And ground our arms at Jesu’s feet,
On the heavenly shore.
Home, home, sweet, sweet home ;
Prepare pie, deaj* Saviour, for glory, my home.

1 TERUSALEM, for ever bright,
U Beautiful land of rest!
No winter there, nor chill of night,
Beautiful land of rest!
The dripping cloud is chased away.
The sun breaks forth in endless day.
Jerusalem, Jerusalem,
The beautiful land of rest!
Beautiful land, beautiful land,
Beautiful land of rest.
2 Jerusalem, for ever free,
The soul’s sweet homo of Liberty;
The guilt of sin, the chains of woe,
The ransom’d there will never know.

Thy pearly gates almost appear ;
And when wo tread thy lovely shore
We’ll sing the song wo sang before.

55 the ROCK THAT IS HIGHER THAN I.
1 TN seasons of grief to my Gpd I’ll repair, [care
J_ When my heart is o’erwhelmed with sorrow and
From the ends of the earth unto Theo will I cry,
“ Lead me to the rock that is higher than I
Chorus— Higher than I, higher than I;
Load me to the Rock that is higher than I.
2 When Satan, my foo, shall come in like a flood.
To drive my poor soul from the fountain of good,
I’ll pray to the Saviour, who meekly did die,
i( Load mo to the Rock that is higher than I.”
3 And while as a stranger I sojourn below,
All Thy covenant blessings, Lord, freely bestow;
In affliction’s dark night to Thy throne let me fly,
Lead me to the Rock that is higher than I.


4 When Thou, Lord, shalt close my frail pilgrimage
In the likeness of Jesus then let me appear; [here
In the swellings of Jordan on Thee I’ll rely,
And look at the Rock that is higher than I.
5 And when the last trumpet shall sound through the
skies,
And the dead in Christ Jesus immortal shall rise,
With the ransomed I’ll praise Him above yonder sky,
Fixed firm on the Rock that is higher than I.
56 RECRUITING HYMN.
1 TTARK! listen to the trumpeters,
Jll They sound for volunteers ;
On Zion’s bright and flowery mount,
Behold! the officers.
Their horses white, their garments bright,
With shield and bow they stand,
Enlisting soldiers for their King,
To march for Cannan’s Land.
2 It sets my heart all in a flame,
A soldier I will bo ;
I will enlist—gird on my arms,
And fight for liberty.
They want no cowards in their band,
Who will their colours fly ;
But call for valiant-hearted men,
Who’ro not afraid to die.
3 The armies now are on parade :
How martial they appear—
All armed, and dressed in uniform,
They look like men of war.
They follow their brave General,
The great eternal Lamb ;
Ills garments stained with His own blood—
King Jesus is His name.
4 The trumpets sound, the armies meet,
And drive the hosts of hell;


How dreadful is our God in arms.
The great Immanuel.
Sinners, enlist with Jesus Christ,
The conquering Son of God,
And march with us to Caiman’s Land,
Beyond the swelling flood.
57 TOO LATE.
1 X * ATE, late, so late ! and dark the night and chill;

Too late, too late, ye cannot enter now.
2 No light had we ; for that we do repent,
And learning this the Bridegroom will relent.
Too late, too late, ye cannot enter now ;
Too late, too late, ye cannot enter now.
3 No light ! so lat°, and dark and chill the night I
Oh, let us in, that we may find the lisrht;
Oh, let us in, that we may find the light.
Too late, too late, ye cannot enter now ;
Too late, too late, ye cannot enter now.
4 Have we not heard the Bridegroom is so sweet ?
Oh, let us in, that wo may kiss His feet.
Oh, let us in ; oh, let us in ; oh, let us in,
Tho’ late, to kiss His feet!
No ! no ! too lato—ye cannot enter now.

58 MARCHING ALONG. '
1 rpHEcbildren arogatheringfromnearand from far,
_L The trumpet is sounding the call for the war;
The conflict is raging, ’twill be fearful and long,
We’ll gird on our armour, and bo marching along.
(Jho. —Marching along, we are marching along,
Gird on the armour and be marching along ;
The conflict is raging, ’twill bo fearful and long,
Then gird on the armour, and be marching along.


2 The foe is before us in battle array,
But let us not waver nor turn from the way ;
The Lord is our strength, be this ever our song,
With courage and faith we are marching along.
3 We’ve ’listed for life, and will camp on the field ;
With Christ as our Captain we never will yield;
The “Sword of the Spirit,” both trusty and strong,
We’ll hold in our hands as we’re marching along. #
4 Through conflicts and trials our crown we must win,
For here we contend ’gainst temptation and sin ;
But one thing assures us— we cannot go wrong.
If trusting our Saviour while marching along.
5I> I WOULD BE LIKE AN ANGEL.
1 T WOULD be like an angel, and with the angels
X stand,
A crown upon my forehead, a harp within my band ;
There, right before my Saviour, so glorious and so
bright, [and night.
I’d make the sweetest music, and praise Him day
2 I never would be weary, nor ever shed a tear,
Nor ever know a sorrow, nor ever feel a fear ;
But blessed, pure, and holy, I'd dwell in Jesu’s sight,
And with ten thousand angels, praise Him both day
and night.
3 I know I’m weak and sinful, but Jesus will forgive,
For many little children have irone to heaven to live;
Dear Saviour, when I languish, and lay me down to
die,
0 send a shining angel, and bear me to the sky.
4 Ah! there I’ll be an angel, and with the angels
stand,
A crown upon my forehead, a harp within my hand;
And there before my Saviour, so glorious and so
bright, [night.
I’ll join the heavenly music, and praise Him day aryl


60 THE CRUCIFIXION. 6-7’s
(Tune — “Jiovjseau. ”)
IT 0, at noon f tis sudden night,
I 1 Darkness covers all the sky,
Rocks are rending at the sight;
Children, can you tell me why ?
What can all these wonders be ?
Jesus dies on Calvary 1
2 Nail’d upon the cross, behold
How His tender limbs are torn!
For a royal crown of gold,
They have made Him one of thorn;
Cruel hands that dare to bind
Thorns upon a brow so kind !
3 See, the blood is falling fast
From His forehead and His side ;
Hark! He now has breathed His last J
With a mighty groan He died !
Children, shall I tell you why
Jesus condescends to die ?
4 He, who was a King above,
Left IIis kingdom for a grave,
Out of pity and of love,
That the guilty He might save;
Down to this sad world He flew
For such little ones as you.
5 You were wretched, weak, and vile,
You deserv’d His holy frown;
But Ho saw you with a smile,
And to save you hasten’d down.
Listen, children—this is why
Jesus condescends to die.
61 THE BETTER LAND.
Suitable for Sunday-School Anniversary,
1 T HEAR thee speak of a better land;
JL Thou callest its children a happy band;


Mother! Oh where is that radiant shore ?
Shall we not seek it, and weep no more ?
Is it where the flower of the orange blows,
And the fire-flies glance through the myrtle boughs ?
“Not there, not there, my child.”
2 Is it where the feathery palm-trees rise,
And the date grows ripe under sunny skies;
Or midst the green islands of glittering seas,
Where fragrant forests perfume the breeze.
And strange bright birds on their starry wings
Bear the rich hues of all glorious things?
“Not there, not there, my child,”
3 Is it far away in some region old,
Where the rivers meander o’er sands of gold;
Where the burning rays of the ruby shine,
And the diamond lights up the secret mine,
And the pearl gleams forth from the coral strand—
Is it there, sweet mother, that better land ?
“Not there, not there, my child.”
4 “ Eye hath not seen it, my gentle boy;
Ear hath not heard its deep songs of joy;
Dreams cannot picture a world so fair :
Sorrow and death may not enter there ;
Time doth not breathe on its fadeless bloom;
For beyond the clouds, and beyond the tomb,
Tis there, 'tis there, my child.”

1 'VTEVER be afraid to speak for Jesus,

He who loves and cares for you.
Chorus —Never be afraid, never bo afraid,
Never, never, never ;

Therefore never be afraid.


2 Never be afraid to work for Jesus
In his vineyard day by day;
Labour with a kind and willing' spirit;

3 Never be afraid to bear for Jesus
Keen reproaches, when they fall;
Patiently endure your every trial,
Jesus meekly bore them all.
4 Never bo afraid to live for Jesus;
If you on His care depend.
Safely you shall pass through every trial,
He will bring you to the end.
Never be afraid to die for Jesus;
He—the life, the truth, the way —
Gently in His arms of love will bear you
To the realms of endless day.
03 little children BROUGHT TO JESUS. r.M.
1 T THINK, when I read that sweet story of old,
X When Jesus was here among men,
How He called little children as lambs to His fold,
I should like to have been with them then, [head,
I could wish that His hands had been placed on my
That His arm had been thrown around me,
And that I might have seen His kind look when He
t( Let the little ones come unto Me.” [said,
2 Yet, more blest, to His footstool I always may go,
And ask for a share in His love;
And if I thus earnestly seek Him below,
I shall see Him and hear Him above,
In that beautiful place He is gone to prepare
For all who are washed and forgiven ;
And many dear children are gathering there,
t( For of such is the kingdom of heaven."
3 But thousands and thousands who wander and fall
Never heard of that heavenly home;
I should like them to know there is room for us all,
And that Jesus has bid them to come.


I long for the joy of that glorious time—
The sweetest, and brightest, and best—
When the dear little children of ev’ry clime
bhall crowd to His arms and be blest.
04 THE CHRISTIAN’S GOLDEN BOOK.
1 *\TTE won’t give up the Bible!.
YY God’s holy book of truth ;
The blessed staff of hoary age ;
The guide of early youth ;
The sun that sheds a glorious light
O’er every dreary road ;
The voice that speaks a Saviour’s love,
And calls us home to God.
2 We won’t give up the Bible!
For pleasure or for pain ;
We’ll buy the truth, and sell it not,
For all that we might gain.
Though men should try to take our prize.
By guile or cruel might.
We’d suffer all that man could do,
And “ God defend the right.”
3 We won’t give up the Bible !
But spread it far and wide,
Until its saving voice be heard
Beyond the rolling tide;
Till all shall know its gracious power,
We, with one voice and heart,
Resolve that from God’s sacred word
We’ll never, never part.

I GOUGH’S LAMENT.
1 TTtTHERE arc the friends that to me were so dear,
VY Long, long ago ; long, long ago ?
Where are the hopes that my heart used to cheer,
Long, long ago ; long, long ago?
Friends that I loved in the grave are laid low,
Hopes that I cherish’d are lied from me now ;
I was degraded—for rum was my foe,
Long, long ago ; long, long ago.
2 Gently my wife bowed her beautiful head,
Long, long ago ; long, long ago ;
Oh, how I wept when I knew she was dead,
Long, long ago ; long, Ion? ago.
She was an angel, my love, and my guide;
Vainly to save me from ruin she tried ;
Poor broken heart! ’twas well that she died,
Long, long ago ; long, long ago.
3 Let mo look back on the days of my youth,
Lons 1 , long ago ; long, long ago.
I was no stranger to virtue and truth,
Long, long ago ; Png, long ago.
Oh for the hopes that were pure as the day.
Oh for the joys that were purer than they,
Oh for the hours I have squandered away,
Long, long ago ; long, long ago.
2 WATER FROM THE SPRING.
1 T ’VE hoard the praise of rosy wine
J. In dulcet measures sung ;
And oft with wild and loud applause
The festive hall has rung.
Let drunkards wake their noisy harps,
And Bacchus’ praises sing—


By far the sweetest drink for me
Is water from the spring 1 .
Cho. —Is water from the spring-,
Is water from the spring ;
By far the sweetest drink for me
Is water from the spring.
2 Whene’er I wander from my home.
How distant far or wide,
I fear no danger on my way,
While Temperance is my guide;
With her my course I fearless steer,
Secure beneath her wing!
And health and happiness enjoy
By water from the spring.
3 She shelters me from all the ills
The drunkard knows and feels;
The bruised reed she docs not break,
The wounded spirit heals.
And when at last, life’s journey’s o’er,
That sweet repose she’ll bring—
Like infant’s sleep—as sweet and pure
As water from the spring.
3 THE GREAT CHANGE.
1 TTE left his wife at home,
Jti To feed his craving thirst,
And to the ale-house oft did roam,
Where he by drink was curs’d.
Cho. — How great a change is there,
How great a change is there,
Since leaving drink, which made him
How great a change is there. [sink —
2 His children oft did cry,
And ask in vain for bread ;
While the fond mother, weeping by,
In sorrow bow’d her head.


3 His children flew apace
When ho did homeward come;
But now how alter’d is the case!
They oft to meet him run.
4 Hard-hearted and unkind,
In rags he wander’d wide;
But now well clothed, in his right mind,
Ho loves his own fireside.
5 The cupboard, once so bare,
With scarce a plate or dish,
Speaks loudly now of better fare —
There’s much that heart could wish.
6 His children once ran wild,
Uncared-for, through the street;
But now a brighter dawn hath smiled —
In Sabbath-school they meet.
7 He used to curse and swear.
And squander time away;
But now he joins in praise and prayer,
And keeps the Sabbath Day.
4 COME, COME AWAY.
1 /"\H COME, come away, ye hardy sons of labour;
V/ Give up the glass, the ale-house pass—
Oh come, come away.
The drink has done you grievous harm,
Then hear a brother’s kind alarm,
And say you will reform.
Oh come, come away.
2 Oh come, come away, your wife’s kind voice is say-
For drink don’t roam, but hasten home— [ing;
Oh come, come away.
If drinking shopmates you should see,
To go with them pray don’t agree.
But, for yourself and me.
Oh come, com© away.


3 Oh come, come away, from those man-traps around
They’ve bit you sore, then go no -more— [you;
Oh come, come away.
No longer spend you time and pence
For that which takes away your sense.
And sends you reeling hence—
Oh come, come away.
4 Oh come, come away, ye Christian men who’re
By faith and zeal, for Zion’s weal; [striving,
Oh come, come away.
For God and man, and all that’s right,
Assist us in our righteous fight,
To put the foe to flight—
Oh, come, come away.
5 Oh come, come away, each toiling son and daughter,
The foo is nigh, then ’gainst them vie—
Oh come, come away.
Come, be a loyal volunteer,
Against the drink and traffic steer,
The foe is really here,
Oh come, come away.
5 SWEEP IT CLEAN AWAY.

B ’Gainst which w© mean to war;
It spreads a curse on every hand,
And causeth many a jar,
Cho. —Oh sweep it—Oh sweep it,
Sweep it away ;
The trade in drink,
Which makes men sink.
Oh sweep it clean away.

Down to a drunkard’s grave !
Yes, unprepar’d from earth they.went,
No ray of hope to crave.

3 I hate the trade, I hate the drink,
Which kills, and spoileth food ;
And both should hated be, I think,
By all the wise and good.
4 What though the foe be very strong,
That lifts its head to-day.
The right shall yet o’ercome the wrong;
God speed the time ! we say.
5 Come forward —help us, Christian men,
Your every effort bring,
Intemperance’ mighty tide to stem,
And with us act and sing.
6 THE OTHER SIDE OF DRINKING.
(Tune— “Rest for ike -Weary”)
1 rpHERE’S a better plan than drinking
1 The drink tljatds a snare ;
Yes, there is, I’ve long 1 been thinking,
And I will tell you where. 3
CAo —On the other side of drinking,
In the sweet fields of temperance,
Where the tree of health is blooming,
There is hope for you.
There is hope for the drunkard,
There is hope for the drunkard,
There is hope for the drunkard,
There is hope for you.
2 See, the slave from his strong fetters
And his bondage is free;
Now he reads blest gospel letters,
And is singing with glee.
3 So the tongue that once spoke madness,
Speaks now in sober joy;
And plenty, peace, and gladness,
All*his dear ones enjoy.


4 He’s a blessing to his neighbours,
Who was once a very pest;
And he goes forth to his labours,
That others may be blest.
5 Then come, brothers, volunteering,
A warfare great to wage;
Come all ye that are God-fearing,
In our sober ranks engage.
7 THE DRUNKARD’S WIFE.
(Tune — u Little Nell”)
1 T’D seen her in her childhood’s home,
I A young and joyous thing,
And wheresoe’er her steps did roam,
She brought a welcoming ;
The very flowers beneath her feet
Grew brighter when she smil’d ;
The throstle’s song did wax more sweet
To bless that lovely child.
2 I saw her on her bridal morn,
And she was passing fair;
1 deem’d not then that she was born
So hard a lot to bear;
And he, her own, was at her side—
Their lips had breathed the vow;
I never saw so fair a bride—
Alas ! what is she now I
3 I saw her with a blooming boy
Laid sleeping on her breast;
I could not speak the mother’s joy
As that fair child she bless’d ;
I could not tell the thrill of bliss
That warmed her beating heart ;
She knew not when she gave that kiss
They were so soon to part.


4 A few bright years have pass’d away,
But darker grows the scene,
As clouds obscure the parting day,
And night comes closing in ;
For death has nipp’d the rosebud’s bloom
That all her griefs beguil’d,
And she is weeping o’er the tomb
Of her young and beauteous child.
5 ’Tis midnight—and her heart’s away
To infancy’s bright bowers ;
She mingles in its laughter gay;
Onco more she plucks its flowers;
She thinks upon her father’s smile —
Her mother’s fond caress ;
Alas ! that she should thus beguile
Her hours of wretchedness.
6 No husband’s love, like holy calm,
Is soothing her despair;
No fond embrace, like healing balm—
No voice of hope is there.
Ah ! no—that husband’s heart’s estranged,
She is not now his life ;
For she her happy lot hath changed.
To be a drunkard’s wife 1
8 THE DRUNKARD’S HOME.
(Tune—“ Ti'oubadour.”)
1 OOFTLY the drunkard’s wife breathes forth her
fo pray’r;
Sadly her bosom heaves wild with despair;
Saying, “ For thee I pine, mourning alone—
Wanderer, wanderer, cotno to thy home.”
2 He with the revellers merrily sung.
Wildly he raised his voice madly in song,*
She in a mourning one blended her tone—
“ Wanderer, wanderer, come to thy home.”


3 Hark ! tis her husband s voice rings in her ear!
Seo how the upturn’d eye melts with the tear:
“Wife of my bosom ! seo here I am come,
Come, like a wanderer, back to my home.”
4 Brightly the drunkard’s home shines in the ray,
Sweetly the drunkard’s wife sraileth to-day;
Drunkard no longer, her husband has come —
Happiness, happiness brightens their homo.
I LOVE IT, MY OWN FIRESIDE.
1 T LOVE it! I love it! my own fireside !
JL What place to me hath such charms beside?
The land of promise, the shrine of love,
A type on earth of my home above !
Oh ! dear to me is its lovely ray
At the close of a long and weary day;
What matter to me how the world may glide,
If it leaves me the light of my own fireside.
2 I left it, and many a long, sad day
I wander’d my cheerless and weary way;
Hope had vanished, and joys were gone—
Friends, they had left mo one by one.
Sometimes a tear from the fount would start,
And betray the pangs of a breaking heart;
I left it, the home of my peace and pride,
And wandered away from my own fireside.
3 But now I love it, my own fireside !
What place to me hath such charms beside ?
Home of the happy, all joy is there;
Let the world rave loud with grief or care.
Oh ! not in the taproom’s murky gleam
Is the beauteous light of its beaming seen:
For she sits there, its joy and its pride,
My wife, by the glow of my own fireside.
4 And years may glide in their haste away,
My cheeks bo wrinkled, my locks bo grey ;
Children may run o’er the old brick floor.
Or pass from the eves of the bid oak door;


But we shall not forget, while life shall last,
The spot where our happiest hours were pass’d ;
And death, when he comes with a conqueror’s stride,
Shall find our hearts by our own fireside.

1 BEAT Founder of our cause, look down,
VJT And bless our labours as Thine own ;
Our common foe drive far away,
And bid fair temp’rance bear the sway.

And earth’s dread waste shall bloom again.
3 Bright earnests of success are given,
Myriads shine forth like stars in heaven.
Resolved our flag shall be unfurl’d
Till Temp’rance triumph o’er the world.

The tyrant mocks—gird on Thy sword ;
Ours is a tried, a val’rous host,
But Thou must lead, or we are lost.

And we shall vanquish all our foes;
Let truth with knowledge fly abroad,
TUI all own Thee, our Patron- -God.

Beams every eye;
Pledged with one heart and hand
To live and die.
Oh ! then, intemp’rance shun !
Be both health and virtue won,
Bright as the noonday sun
Shines in the sky.
3 Come, join the temp’rance band ;
Come, come away.
Why will ye doubting stand ?
Why still delay ?
Oh, we shall happy be
When we’re from intemp’rance free
Haste, from the danger flee—
Haste, haste away.

Pledge, pledge to-day;
Bow no more to fashion’s laws—
Break, break away.
Conquer habit while you can ;
Lengthen out life’s little span ;
Sign the good teetotal plan ;
Sign, sign to-day.

Not far away,
When tempTance truth shall shine.
Bright, bright as day.
Oh ! then we’ll sweetly sing.

While round our path the fierce wind plays.
To nerve our heart, to cheer our way,
We blithely sing this roundelay —

We’ll win the day!
We’ll win the day!
Then on we’ll go right merrily, merrily.
2 When public-houses rear on high
Their heads against a smiling sky,
We’ll heed them not—but still we’ll say.
Forward! my lads; we’ll win the day !
3 When'drunkards reeling through the street
In all their sin we sadly meet,
We’ll kindly speak, we’ll deeply pray,
And shout in their ears, 11 We’ll win the day !”
4 If cowards should refuse to raise
Their hand and voice to give us praise,
We will not heed their reckless way,
But forward rush to win the day,
THE CRYSTAL'SPRING.
1 IVE me a draught from the crystal spring,
VX When the burning sun is high,
When the rocks and the woods their shadows fling
Where the pearls and the pebbles lie.
2 Give me a draught from the crystal spring
When the cooling breezes blow,
When the leaves of the trees are withering
From the forest in the fleecy snow.
3 Give me a draught from the crystal spring
When the wintry winds are gone,
When the flow’rs are in bloom, and the echoes ring
From the woods o’er the verdant lawn.
4 Give me a draught from the crystal spring
When the ripening fruits appear,
When the reapers the song of harvest sing,
And plenty has crowned the year.
5 Give me a draught from the crystal spring,
Let me drink it day by day;
But if aught from the worm of the still you bring,
I will pour every drop away.


14 SOLDIERS OF THE WATER KING.
1 'VXTE’RE soldiers of the Water King,
VV His laws we will obey;
Virtue and health are His reward,
We want no better pay.
Cho. —Then let Us sing the Water King,
Good soldiers, one and all:
His banner to the breeze we’ll fling,
And cast down Alcohol.
2 He boasts no sword or glittering spear;
He wears a bloodless crown;
A purer, brighter, fairer thing
Than conquerors ever won.
3 Our strength is in the living spring.
And long as waters run,
Or grass grows green, we’re pledged to keep
Our terap’rance armour on.
4 And tho’ the Fire King mocks our hosts,
As great Goliath did,
We’ve temperance heroes in our ranks
Who’ll bring away his head.
15 IT WILL NEVER DO TO GIVE IT UP BO.
1 TTTE’VE fought tho battle very long,
Y V And now we’ll sing a little song
To raise our spirits, getting low,
For it won’t do to give it up so.
It will never do to give it up so,
It will never do to give it up so,
It will never do to give it up so—Oh no,
It will never do to give it up so.
2 We have a hard and lengthy race,
But still keep on the same good pace:
So long as rum shall lay men low.
It will never do to give it up so.
C 2


3 If you have tumbled off the track,
Have broken the pledge, are on your back—
Don’t give it up, but try again:
Come, sign once more, and be a man.
4 Those who sell the liquor, too,
We have a word to say to you:
Better away the liquor throw.
For we will never give it up so.
5 We’ve tried it hard, we’ve tried it long,
Wo’ve tried the speech, we’ve tried the song,
We’ve tried the mouth, we’ve tried the pen,
If they won’t do, we’ll try them again.
1G SONG OF THE SONS OF TEMPERANCE.
(Air--“7to«.«S£aw’5 Dream”)
1 T) BOTHERS, round our standard rally,
l> Haste and join us heart and hand,
Why with death and danger dally?
Help to save the Austral Laud.
Bacchus flaming hurries onward,
See his blood-stained banner waves,
Tens of thousands, dowmvard, dcnvnward,
Rush besotted to their graves.
2 See poor tattered children mourning,
See deserted wailing wives.
And poor drunkards sadly groaning,
O’er their wrecked and wasted lives;
Where is now their golden treasure?
Where the land that gave them birth ?
Where, alas! each fleeting pleasure?
All is ashes , dust, and earth.
i> Drink’s accursed dark dominion,
Where the ghastly prisons loom.
There despair, on sable pinion,
Sheds an everlasting gloom. •*
Hark ! the dreadful bell is sounding,
See the gibbet reare 1 on high,


Lo ! the people fiercely bounding,
There to see the drunkard die.
4 Brothers, for your soul’s salvation,
Shun the fell destroying cup,
Bringing woe and degradation—
Brothers! Sisters i give it up.
Sons of Temperance, brave and steady,
•March to meet our country’s foe;
With the pledge be always ready,
And for ever lay him low.
W. STITT JENKINS.
ty there’s a good time coming.
1 mHERE’S a good time coming, friends —
I A good time coming ;
The signs around us show it near,
We breathe the very atmosphere
Of the good time coming.
Intemperance has felt our blow,
Let us make it stronger ;
Its dying throes we soon shall see—
Wait a little longer.
2 There’s a good time coming, friends—
A good time coming;
The Churches have been waked at last,
Temperance facts are telling fast
Of the good time coming.
Abstinence is gaining ground—
Faith in it grows stronger;
And though prejudice yet lives —
Wait a little longer.
3 There’s a good time coming, friends —
A good time coming ;
The days of progress now appear,
The seeds are sown—the harvest near
Of the good time coming.
Slavery, war, intemperance,
Cannot now grow stronger;
Live, and justice shall prevail—
Wait a little longer.


4 There’s a good time coming, friends—
A good time coming;
Let us aid it all we can,
Every woman, every man—
The good time coming.
Smallest helps, if rightly given,
Make the impulse stronger—
’Twill be strong enough, one day —
Wait a little longer.
18 the temperance tree.
(Tune— tl Ivy Green.”)
1 A THRIVING plant is the Temperance Tree,
Xjl- That spreadeth its branches wide ;
Long may it hale and flourishing be.
Though heaviest storm betide ;
Though years roll over, relentless time
Shall work no slow decay;
Unharmed, uplifting its head sublime,
And welcome as the flowers in May.
Fruitful, vigorous, fadeless, free,
A thriving plant is the Temperance Tree,
2 Thousands are gathered beneath its shade,
And daily their voices ring
With heartfelt thanks for the glad homes made,
The joys which from temperance spring.
Though foes endeavour its growth to stay,
Their efforts shall fruitless prove;
Still blooming ’mid storms shall its branches play,
While cherished by virtue and love.
Fruitful, vigorous, fadeless, free,
A thriving plant is the Temperance Tree,
3 ’Twas planted by reason on virtue’s soil,
By tears of penitence fed;
Kind Heaven hath smiled on the work of toil
And genial sunbeams shed.
Its growth is spreading o’er land and sea,
And every foreign clime


Shall taste the fruits of the Temperance Tree,
The tree that defies old Time.
Fruitful, vigorous, fadeless, free,
A thriving plant is the Temperance Tree.

ANNIVERSARY OF THE KECHABITES.
(Tune — “ Rousseau. ”)
1 T)RETHREN, let us walk together,
i3 In the bonds of love and peace;
Can it be a question whether
Brethren should from conflict cease ?
’Tis in union
Hope, and joy, and love increase.
2 While we journey onward, let us
Help each other on the road ;
Foes on every side beset us.
Snares thro’ all the way are strcw’d.
It behoves us
Each to bear a brother’s load.
3 As we have strong drink forsaken —
That which fed contention’s fire—
It were strange if we, o’ertaken.
Show self-will, or wrath, or ire;
Let us rather
To remain in peace desire.
4 Let us each esteem his brother
Better than himself to be;


And let each prefer another—
Full of love, from envy free.
Happy are we
When in this we all agree.

All o’er the isle, and nobles feed the flame;
The rich and the poor are eager all in raising
Drunkards from sin, and their children from shame.

Over the land with trade and passion’s power;
Evoke the law’s aid to hush the millions weeping,
Demand ye the Maine law—now is the hour.

From the crystal fountain flowing ;
A pure delight both day and night,
On young and old bestowing.

In the smiles of a ransom’d father ;

O Would you escape the drunkard’s shame, now's
the time to stop, John ;
’Tis a lesson plain enough,
And e’en by children learnt, John—
That he who never touches fire
Can’t possibly be burnt, John.
And 'tis as plain that he who says
To little drops “farewell,” John,
Can never wear a drunkard's name,
Nor sink to drunkard’s hell, John.

A fiery demon’s lurking there to lead your soul
astray, John.
’Tis seldom one glass stays at one,
But passes on to two, John;
And three and four, and often more—
To run the risk won’t do, John ;
For many of earth’s greatest sons,
Accustomed deep to think, John,
Have yielded to the luring cup,
And conquer’d been by drink, John. —Stop, &c.
3 Nay, John ! nay, John! talk not of delay, John ;
It will not be an easier thing to-morrow than to-day,
If ’tis well for health and wealth, [John.
From strong drink to abstain, John,
’Tis well to-day; why then delay ?
What is to be the gain, John ?
Since now ’tis right, now boldly lift
Thine hand up for the right, John;
Then joy shall glisten in thine eyes,
In thinking of to-night, John. —Stop, &c,
4 What, John ! what, John ! you become a sot, John?
Unfit to live, unfit to die—is this to be your lot,
John?


u Nay, nay,” say you, “that will not do I”
Our temperance pledge then sign, John,
With heart and voice we welcome you,
Now write your name with mine, John.
You need not fear the laugh and sneer,
That may ere long begin, John;
You’ll be a wiser—better man,
And they can laugh who win, John.
Stop, John, &c.

2 “Forget me not when far away
O’er yonder restless bounding sea;
In foreign lands, when foes beguile,
And sinners tempt thee, think of me.
When pleasure spreads her gilded snares,
And lures thee in her paths to stray,
When glasses sparkle on the board,
Forget me not, though far away.”
3 Our native land we see no more—
No more its blooming heather tread;
We ne’er again shall hear the voice
Of lov’d ones numbered with the dead;
The land of Wallace and of Bruce,
Of virtuous dames and valiant men,
The Scotland that wo love so well,
We never more shall see again.
4 But dear unto our very souls
Is that loved island o’er the sea;
And shall we pray that God may send
Its people great prosperity.
The land of cakes— our father’s home—
We pray for every hallow’d spot,
And will while life endures proclaim,
“ Dear Scotland, we forget thee not.”


6 We meet upon another shore,
And other faces now behold ;
We claim another kingdom here —
The empire of the land of gold ;
And ne’er shall Bacchus us o’erthrow,
His banner ne’er above us fly,
For we will sign the pledge to-night,
And keep it, brothers, till we die.
6 We’ll sign the pledge, and will abstain
From all vile liquors evermore ;
We’ll sign the pledge, and soon will drive
John Barleycorn from every shore.
We’ll sign the pledge for happy homes,
Where wives and children shall be fed ;
We’ll sign the pledge, and God will send
All sober people daily bread.

:$8 death’s no foe.
1 ONE are the days when my heart was young
UP and gay,
Gone are my friends from these fleeting scenes away,
Gone from the earth to a better land, I know;
I hear their gentle voices whisper. Death’s no foe.
Clio. —I’rn coming, I’m coming, for my head is bending
' low;
1 hear their gentle voices whisper, Death’s no foe.
2 Why do I weep when my heart should feel no pain ?
Why do I sigh that my friends come not again ?
Grieving for forms departed long ago;
I hear their gentle voices whisper. Death’s no foe.
3 Where are the hearts once so happy and so free,
The children so dear that I held upon my knee ?
Gone to the shore where my soul has loneed to go;
I hear their gentle voices whisper, Death’s no foo.

1 T ET me kiss him for his mother,
I J Let me kiss his youthful brow;
I will love him for his mother,
And seek her blessing 1 now.
Kind friends have soothed his pillow,

I feel their blessings here.
Then kiss him for his mother,

Farewell, dear stranger brother—
Our requiem, our tears.
Sleep, dearest, &c.

With poor brother Benny so sick in her arms,
And no one to help her but mo.
Como homo, come homo, come homo !

42 MY BUD IX HEAVEX.
1 bud the Gardener gave me,
\J A fair and only child;
He gave it to my keeping,
. To cherish undefiled.
It lay upon my bosom,
It was my hope and pride ;
Perhaps it was an idol,
Which I must be denied,
2 For just as it was opening
• In glory to the day,
Came down the Heavenly Gardener
And took my bud away;
Yet not in wrath He took it—
A smile was on His face
As tenderly and kindly
He bore it from the place,
3 “ Fear not,” He whispered,
Thy bud shall be restored;
I take it but to plant it
In the garden of the Lord.”
Then bid me not to sorrow
As those who hopeless weep.
For He who gave hath taken.
And He who took can keep.
i And night and morn, together
Before the gate of prayer,
I’ll go unto my darling.
And sit beside him there.
I know that it will open.
Poor sinner though I be,
For His dear sake who took it,
And keeps my bud for me.
43 MOTHER WOULD COMFORT ME.
1 X’lTOLJNDED and sorrowful, far from my home;
VV Sick, among strangers, uncared for, unknown;


Even the birds, that used sweetly to sing,
Are silent, and swiftly have taken the wing.
No one but mother can cheer me to-day,
No one for me could so fervently pray.
None to console me, no kind friend is near;
Mother would comfort me if she were here.
Cko. —Gently her hand o’er my forehead she’d press.
Trying to free me from pain and distress ;
Kindly she’d say to me, “ Be of good cheer,
Mother will comfort you, mother is here.”
2 If she were with me, I soon would forget
My pain and my sorrow, no more would I fret;
One kiss from her lips or one look from her eye
Would make me contented, and willing: to die.
Gently her hand o’er my forehead she’d press,
Trying to free me from pain and distress;
Kindly she’d say to me, “ Be of good cheer,
Mother will comfort you, mother is here.” — Clio.
3 Cheerfully, faithfully, mother would stay
Always beside me, by night and by day;
If I should murmur or wish to complain,
Her gentle voice soon would calm me again.
Sweetly a mother’s love shines like a star,
Brightest in darkness, when daylight’s afar;
In clouds or in sunshine, pleasure or pain,
Mother’s affection is ever the same. — Cko.
u HOME AGAIN.
1 TT OME again, home again,
Xl From a foreign shore,
And oh ! it fills my soul with joy
To meet my friends once more.
Here I dropp’d the parting tear.
To cross the ocean’s foam ;
But now I’m once again with those
Who kindly greet me home.


Chorus. —Home again, home again.
From a foreign shore,
And oh ! it fills my soul with joy
To meet my friends once more.
2 Happy hearts, happy hearts
With mine have lausrhed in glee,
But oh ! the friends I loved in youth
Seem happier to me;
And if my guitfe should be the fate
Which bids me longer roam,
But death alone can break the tie
That binds my heart to home.
Clio. —Home again, &c.,
3 Music sweet, music soft
Lingers round the place,
And oh ! I feel the childhood charm
That time cannot efface.
Then give me but my homestead roof.
I’ll ask no palace dome.
For I can live a happy life
With those I love at home,
CAo.—Home again, &c.
45 WHAT AKE THE WILD WAVES SAYING ?
2nd Voice—
WHAT are the wild waves saying,
Sister, the whole day long,
That ever amid our playing
I hear but their low, lone song ?
Not by the seaside only.
There it sounds wild and free;
But at night, when ’tis dark and lonely,
In dreams it is still with me.
1st voice—Brother, I hear no singing!
’Tis but the rolling wave,
Ever its lone course winging
Over some ocean cave !


’Tis "but the noise of water,
Dashing against the shore,
And the wind, from some bleaker quarter,
Mingling with its roar.
Duet No ! no, no, no!
No, no, no ! it is something greater,
That speaks to the heart alone ;
The voice of the great Creator
Dwells in that mighty tone.
2nd voice—Yes ! but the waves seem ever
Singing the same sad thing,
And vain is my weak endeavour
To guess what the surges sing.
What is that voice repeating
Ever, by night and day ?
Is it a friendly greeting,
Or a warning that calls away ?
1st voice—Brother ! the inland mountain,
Hath it not voice and sound ?
Speaks not the dripping fountain
As it bedews the ground ?
E’en by the household ingle,
Curtain’d, and clos’d, and warm.
Do not our voices mingle
With those of the distant storm ?
Duet Yes ! yes, yes !
Yes, yes I but there’s something greater,
That speaks to the heart alone;
The voice of the great Creator
Dwells in that mighty tone.
40 THE ENGLISHMAN.
1 rilHERE’S a land that bears a well-known name:
JL Though it is but a little spot,
I say 'tis first on the scroll of fame.
And who shall say it is not ?


Of the deathless ones who shine and live
In arms, in arts, or song,
The brightest the whole wide world can give
To that little land belong.
’Tis the star of the earth: deny it who Can—
The island home of an Englishman.
2 There’s a flag that waves o’er every sea,
Ko matter when or where ;
And to treat that flag as aught but the free.
Is more than the strongest dare.
For the lion spirits that tread the deck
Have carried the palm of the brave;
And that flag may sink with a shot-torn wreck,
But never float over a slave.
Its honour is stainless : deny it who can ;
And this is the flag of an'Englishman.
3 There’s a heart that leaps with burning glow,
The wronged and the weak to defend ;
And strikes as soon for a trampled foe
As it does for a soul-bound friend.
It nurtures a deep and honest love,
‘ It glows with faith and pride,
And yearns with the fondness of a dove
To tho light of its own fireside.
’Tis a rich; rough gem : deny it who can
And this is the heart of an Englishman.
4 The Briton may traverse the pole or the zone.
And boldly claim his right;
For he calls such a vast domain hte own.
That the sun never sets on his might.
Let the haughty stranger seek to know
The place of bis homo and birth,
And a flush will pour from cheek to brow
While he tells his native earth.
For a glorious charter—deny it who can—
Is breathed in the words, “ I’m an Englishman,* 1
Mason, Firth, M'Cutckeon, Printers, Melbourne.
