VOCABULARY OF the NGARRUGU TRIBE N.S.W.
By R. H. Mathews, l.s.
[Read before the Royal Society of N. S. Wales, December 2, 1908.]
I wish to place on record a vocabulary obtained by me from
the remnant of the Ngarrugu tribe, which formerly occupied
the country from Queanbeyan, via Cooma and Bombala, to
Delegate. Adjoining the Ngarrugu on the north from
Queanbeyan to Yass, Booroowa and Goulburn, was the
Ngunawal tribe. In 1904 I published a short grammar and
vocabulary of the Ngunawal language, 1 a sister tongue of
the Ngarrugu. The grammatical structure of these
languages is closely similar, and several words of their


vocabularies are almost identical. Adjoining the Ngarrugu
on part of the west was the Walgalu, and westerly again of
the latter was the Dhudhuroa, a grammar and vocabulary
of whose language I shall publish later on. On part of the
south, the Ngarrugu was bounded by the Birdhawal tribe,
whose language and initiation ceremonies have been
reported by me. 1 West of the Birdhawal and south-west
of the Ngarrugu the Kurnai language was spoken, a gram-
mar and vocabulary of which I published in 1902. 2 It should
be mentioned that between the Ngarrugu and the sea coast
are a number of tribes, whose initiation ceremonies and
dialects have been dealt with by me in various Journals.
The tribal name, Dhudhuroalias been erroneously reported
as “ Theddora ” by some writers. Walgalu as “ Wolgal,”
and Birdhawal as “ Biduelli.”
Ngarrugu Vocabulary.
This vocabulary contains about 260 words collected
personally among the remnant of the Ngarrugu natives in
the Monaro district, New South Wales. Instead of arrang-
ing the words alphabetically they are placed together under
separate headings. As the equivalents of English terms
will most frequently be required they are put first.

APPENDIX.
Explanation re “ Notes on the Arranda Tribe.”
In an article published in this Journal, Vol. xli., p. 151,
I gave the marriage and offspring of a certain woman named


Nakara. As I possess the pedigree of this woman backward
to her grandfather, and forward to her grandchild, Dr.
W. H. R. Rivers, an eminent English anthropologist, has
asked me to publish it. I therefore submit the following
table, in which the names of men are given in capital letters
those of women in lower-case type, and the names of the
men are always to the left of those of their wives. The
section to which each person belongs is entered in italics
directly under his or her proper name. The letter m stands
for “married.”

In the left hand side of the above table, all the marriages
and the descent of the offspring are in accordance with
Table I, p. 68 of volume xli of this Journal, and with Table
C, American Anthropologist , Yol. x, N.S., pp. 89 90. In
the right hand side of the above table, Nakara is married
to an alternative or No. 2 husband, and her child Jakobus,
takes the section name of his mother’s mother and of his
father’s father. Jakobus marries an alternative or No. 2
wife and the child, Frieda, takes the section name of her
mother’s mother and father’s father, in accordance with
Table B, p. 151 of volume xli of this Journal. The man
Jakobus is about 37 years old at the present time. He


was born about 1872, before any Mission Station was
established at Hermannsburg, and his pedigree is conse-
quently free from any European influence.
Correction.
In my table of the intermarrying divisions of the Warra-
monga tribe, reported at p. 73 of Vol. xxxn of this Journal,
1898, some clerical errors occurred. In a few instances
the “alternative” or No. 2 wife was given instead of the
“normal” or No. 1. In 1901 I published a correct table
at p. 74 of Vol. xvi, Queensland Geographical Journal, to
which the reader is referred.
