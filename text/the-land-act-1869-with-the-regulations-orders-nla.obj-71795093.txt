tions for the management of any common heretofore proclaimed or
hereafter to be proclaimed: Now therefore the Governor, acting by and
with the advice of the Executive Council, doth by this present Order
make the regulations following:?
1. In the construction and for the purposes of these regulations, the

geldings, colts, fillies, asses, and mules; the words ? small cattle ? shall
mean sheep and goats ; and the word ? farmer ? shall mean a person who
resides on and uses for the purpose of agriculture or dairying land held

2. Application for the proclamation of a common under The Land

3. Application for the increase of any existing common shall be made
in the form prescribed in Schedule B hereto, and must contain full par-
ticulars relative to the area of the common to be increased, the number

ceived during that year, and how such fees have been disposed of.
4. Ratepayers in shires, road districts, and boroughs, holders ox

residence, four head of large cattle, or the equivalent of the whole or a
portion thereof in small cattle, on the basis that one head of large cattle
be deemed equivalent to three head of small cattle. A farmer having

head of large cattle, or the equivalent in small cattle, for every ten
acres of such land cultivated by him.
5. The fees for depasturing cattle on a common shall be paid in
advance, and shall not be less than at the rate of four shillings per

scale of fees within the prescribed limits, which alteration shall be sub-
ject to the approval of the Board of Land and Works, and be published
in a newspaper circulating in the district wherein the common is
situated.
6. The managers of a common shall have power to appoint a herds-

the management of that common. He shall also conform to any special
instructions issued to him by its managers relative to the registration,
custody, and delivery to owners of the cattle thereon, and to the pre-
vention of trespass thereon of cattle other than travelling cattle for
which no commonage fees have been paid. Such herdsman shall be
remunerated for his services out of the fund derived from the common-
age fees, and he shall provide security for the honest and faithful dis-
charge of his duties in such amount as the managers of the common
may deem adequate.
7. The managers of commons wholly or partially comprised within
boroughs or townships, and of goldfields commons proclaimed under
the Acts No. 117 or 145, may grant to butchers or to slaughtermen
special licenses to depasture, for such periods of time as may be agreed
on, cattle intended for slaughter, subject to the condition that the fees

per annum for large cattle, and one shilling and four pence per head per
annum for small cattle.
8. The money derived from the fees received for the agistment of
cattle on a common may, in addition to the defraying of the remunera-
tion of the herdsman, be expended by the managers of such common on

derived therefrom, the dates of such payments, and the authority for
making them; and the managers shall give printed receipts in the form
of the Schedule E hereto annexed consecutively numbered, the buts of
which receipts must be retained for inspection.

daries of the borough, the council thereof shall be the manager of such
portion.
11. Managers of every common shall, within one month after the
termination of each year, publish in a newspaper circulating in the dis-
trict wherein the common is situated a certified account of their receipts
and expenditure for the year, in the form prescribed in Schedule F
hereto.
12. No animal affected with any contagious disease shall be allowed
to depasture on any common.
13. When, owing to the distance of any goldfield common from the
office or place of meeting of any mining board, such common can be
more conveniently or efficiently managed by persons resident on or near
such common than by the mining board in its corporate capacity, the
Governor in Council, on receiving a representation to that effect, may
appoint as managers of such common persons nominated by the mining
board.

Crown Lands and Survey for Victoria, shall give the necessary direc-
tions herein accordingly.
