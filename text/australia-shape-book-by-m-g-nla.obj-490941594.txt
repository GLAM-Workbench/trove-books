Said the lyre-bird to the tall Emu, |
“Will you come to my ball with
the rose cockatoo,
Where the bower-bird builds his hall?
But the Emu bowed his stately head
And said, “I must run to the plains instead,
For I hear Mrs. Emu call.”
The proud black swans sailed away down stream
With, “how very silly those land birds seem!
The kangaroo laughed, “no one asked me at all,
But to-night I’ll go hoppity hop
to the ball.”

Black papa is grinning as he hears his Biddy crying;
“Meat, meat, muchee! meat for you and me.
And for all the picaninnies, one, two and three!”
“Black fellow cunning, black man throw a spear,
Hit the fat wallaby bring him home here,
Meat, meat, muchee! black fellow good,
Bring the wife and picaninny
plenty much food,”

Sheep mustering


Barking dog and cracking whip,
Sheep that run so fast, they trip,
Shouts on the still air breaking!
This is the way they gather the sheep
In that far lard, where they’re fast asleep
When you and I are waking;
This is the way, and a noisy way,
But then they’re afraid a sheep might stray.

There’s a hut where they watch for
the wagon’s sound, ”
And each step brings it nearer,
With its goods from the city
in big bales bound,
And its news which is even dearer.
And the driver thinks, “I have sold my wool
For a price that will make them stare,
I’ll soon go home with my pockets full
Of gold for the old folk’s share.”
