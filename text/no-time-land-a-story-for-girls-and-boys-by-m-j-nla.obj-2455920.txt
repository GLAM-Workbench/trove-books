A STORY OF NO-TIME-LAND.
CHAPTER I.
(I UY, come and play with me."
"Oh! I can't, Tina, I have no time;
I am going fishing soon with Erie Cass.
"Oh, dear!" said the little voice; "you
never get time, Guy, to have a game."
"Cannot you have one game with her,
sonny!" said his mother; "the wee girlie is
dull playing bv herself all day."
"But mother, dear, I have no time now,"
and so saying, Guy shouldered his fishing
rod and walked off.
But his mother's sad, grieved expression
seemed to haunt him all day, and his little
sister's voice echoed so in his ears, that the
fishing was not altogether such an enjoyable


time as he expected. He got back tired
and hungry, and soon after tea he was glad
to go to bed.
He was just dropping off to sleep, w hen his
eyes seemed to wander to the open window,
where the moonbeams were dancing in, as
if they had come to see what sort of a room
it was, and what the inmate was like. They
are inquisitive little things, you know; both
moonbeams and sunbeams. They like to
get into all the odd dark corners, and if
people arc dirty and slovenly in their work,
they show up the dust, and dirt, as much as
to say: "Oh, fie, for shame, you slovenly
creatures!"
Just as Guy's eyes alighted 011 the windows
he saw two ladies conic floating in 011 the
moonbeams. "There he is," one of them
whispered, "that is the little boy who has 110
time. Let 11s carry him off to No-Time-
Land."






Guv was fascinated at the beauty of Ins
visitors - so much so that he never thong
of hiding under the bed-clothes; but,, would
".I'e id, little use he had done so, for
these kind of ladies see ever) thing,

quiVpoxverless and unable to move a limb
While they were carrying him Guy not.ee.
„,ev were very pretty. Gueldme as he
companion called her, had golden hair a,
lar ., e brown eves, with golden brown lashes
Zi evebrows, the other had chestnut brow
I,! and large blue eyes, with dark brown
lashes and eyebrows; her name was h. . -

jresL" Gueldine's dress was pure white.
S old thread interwoven through at, and
rX* with long ends. I. gave her


a very dazzling appearance. On her hair
she wore a crescent moon of diamonds and
rubies. Crystals dress was white, with
silver interwoven, a silver sash with long
ends; in her hair were stars made of
diamonds and sapphires.
Away they went, over hills and water, then
he caught sight of dim grey hills in the
distance, as they drew nearer to them the
two ladies exclaimed —"Here we are in No-
Time-Land."
They floated across to the nearest town,
*
and placed him on a bench in the middle of
one of the parks, as it was getting daylight,
and said, "Good-by, little boy, we have 110
time to stop," and away they went. Guy
watched them till he could see them no
longer, and as it was fast getting daylight,
and things were becoming clearer every
minute, he roused himself, as he found now
he could move, and looked around. Dear


me! What a dreadful untidy-looking place;
and so it was, for papers were lying about
everywhere. In the centre of the square
was a fountain, but it was broken; the wall
round the basin was crumbling and falling
to pieces; the water seemed stagnant, the
flower beds, and grass lawns weye over-
grown with weeds, and everything looked
o
sadly neglected and forlorn. A boy came
sauntering along, so Guy said to him -
"Boy; why does your park look so neglected
and untidv i The boy stared at him.
"Are you a stranger?'' he asked at last.
J * —
"Yes," said Guy.
"Well." said the other; "no one has time
here to put it right."
"Are they so busy," asked Guy.
"Too busy to answer your questions," re-
plied the other, and walked off.
"No time either for manners," shouted
Guv: but the bov was out of earshot, so did
J ' "
not hear.


"I will go into the town," he thought, "and
see what it is like," so got up and strolled
about; but everywhere he went the same
neglect met his eyes. He became very hun-
gry after a while, and seeing a young woman
hurrying along, went up to her.
"Is there any place here where I can get
something to eat, please ma am, asked Guy.
"Oh! I have no time to talk to little
boys," she said.
Again and again he asked the same ques-
tion, and received the same reply. He at
last saw a pastry cook's shop, and went in.
People kept coming in and ordering things,
and, eating them, went out, saving, "I have
no time to pay, put it down." A little girl
came in and asked for two penny buns.
"Why don't you pay for them?" asked
Guy.
"No one pays here," she said, "we have no
time."




" Weer 7 aim! about money," -she mid ; •' / have DO time to take it.'


How dreadfully dishonest, he thought.
''Please ma'am," said Guy, "I am so hun-
'grv, can you give me some bread and butter
and milk? but I have no money to pay for
it.
She handed him a couple of rolls and
some butter 011 a plate, also a large tumbler
of hot milk.
"Never mind about money, she said; I
have no time to take it. I will just put it
down," and she immediately started to eat a
cake.
Guy began to laugh, saying lhats a
funny way to put it down."
"No time for anything else," she replied.
Guy sighed. lam getting quite tired
hearing those words, he thought to himself,
"No time, no time," always dinned into one's
ears. As he had finished his meal he went
out.


CHAPTER 11.
Seeing a number of children going to
school, he followed them in, and sat down
with them.
They all started as the schoolmaster came
in to sing—
We have no time to learn our lessons,
No time ! no time at all,
We do not want to gain any sense,
As we have no sense like Paul.
"I suppose Paul is the schoolmaster," said
Guy to the girl sitting next to him.
"What is your name?" she asked.
"Guy," he answered.
J '
Then they all began to sing again
There was a little boy,
And he was called a guy,
He wished to know Oom Paul ;
But like the rest of us,
He had no sense at all.


Guy became very angry upon hearing this,
and began himself to sing—
You have no sense at all !
You need not tell me so.
I've no time to talk to you,
So I'll take my hat and go.
''School is dismissed,' 1 said the school-
master. "I have no time to-day to hear les-
sons.' 1
Guy went down a narrow lane, or pas-
sage, it seemed, as it was carpeted; he saw
a little boy crying.
"What's the matter?" said Guy.
"I have no time to tell you, he said.
"Oh, rubbish," said Guy; ''make time.
The boy looked up in surprise.
"Why that is what they used to say to me
before I came down here. But I am not
clever, and I cannot make anything, not
even time.' 1
Guy was disgusted.


"No;" he said, "stupids like you want a
good beating, and I would like to give you
one, only I think it would be a waste of time
to give you even that.
o J
"I did not know time had a waist, said
the boy. "I thought it was only people.'
"You thickhead/' said Guy, and walked
off.
"What funnv words he uses," said the boy
"I wonder where he comes from: But, oh
dear; I have no time to think."
Almost at the end of the passage Guy
came to a large eight-day clock; he stood
and gazed at it with surprise; and well he
mieht. For the clock was fixed upon a
lone stick; in the centre of the clock the
eves and lips moved as if it was alive. Out-
side the face it had figures all round, in order
to tell the time of day. The arms and hands
protruded from the sides of the clock like
numerous arms and hands; which gave it


rather an odd look. Ihe pendulum hung
below, swinging backwards and forwards,
just as Guy was looking at him, the clock
opened his mouth, rolled up his eyes, and
began to sing—
Tick, tick, I'm a clock upon a stick ;
Never on a shelf I'll stay ;
But in this no-time-land
Upon a stick I'll stand,
And my pendulum will wag all day.
"Dear me," said Guy; "I've heard some-
thing like that before; but it sounds all
wrong?"
"Everything is wrong in this land,' said
the clock.
"How is that?" asked Guy.
"No time," said the clock.
" Did you ever study?" again asked Guy.
"Study?" questioned the clock, in a tone
of surprise. "I have heard of a person
being in a brown study, if that is what >ou
mean."


"No, 110! Study the time," said Guy. "If
you studied time you might manage to get
along better, you know."
"Oh! I get along alright," said the clock;
"only if there is no time, how can you study
it?" He gave such a loud tick, and pulled
such a funny grimace that it frightened Guy,
so he began to run; and, as he turned the
corner, seeing no one was after him, he
stopped to take breath, and there right in
front of him was a large open piece of
ground, in the centre of which was a sum-
mer house, and roads branching all ways
from it, and sign-posts saying where each
road led to.


CHAPTER 111.
Guv read some of the signs. One was to
*
the land Selfishness, another to Forgetful-
ness. To the land of Put-off, and By-and-
bv. Another was I Can't and I\\on t.
*
"Oh, dear! They are all as bad as the one
I am in, and I ve no time to read an} more.
Dear! Dear! I am always saying no time
myself now;' and, feeling very miserable,
he entered the arbour, sat down on one of
the cane chairs, and, putting his arms on the
table, rested his head on them.
"What a dreadful muddle things have got
into."
"Perhaps you have stirred up the mud,"
said a voice.
Guy started! "The only sensible thing I
have heard yet," he thought; and, looking


A Story of No-Time-Land.
up. saw on the mantelpiece —he never noticed
a fireplace in the arbour before—a little old
man holding a scroll.
"May I ask vour name, please sir.'' said
* *
Guv.
"Mr. Memory-Pricker," replied the little
man; "but I am called M.P. for short.'
"Whv, that stands for member of Parlia-
ment too, said Guy.
"Well, it is the same thing." answered the
little man. "You see, 'Parle' in French
means to speak. So it is meant, that I,
an active member, speak to, and prick up,
people's memories; it is what people would
call a play upon words; only you have a way
of putting it backwards."
"Please, sir, can you tell me why this is
called Xo-Time-Land; at least, how it got
its name?"
"Well, I think I can," said the M.P. "You
must have noticed people hurrying along


bent on some great purpose, but they never
seem to attain that purpose; or to put it still
plainer, they want to do some great thing,
or even little things, but they never get time,
they say, to do them, so all their great and
little ideas end in simple talk. Consequently,
and in fact, all lazy people who say they
have no time, are sent to Xo-Time-Land."
"Do they ever leave here: Mr. M.P."
"Sometimes," said the little man, "when
thev stray into my arbour, I prick up their
memories; they occasionally turn over a new
leaf, then, if they wish to overcome their
bad habits; but it is not often," sighed he,
"not often!"
"May I ask what YOU use the scroll for,
•/
please sir?"
"Yes; this is my scrap book. lam a
collector of poetry, wise sayings, and various
other things of interest. Here is a piece
you may like to read.'


Guy got up and went close to the scroll,
and read these lines —
No time like the present
To do the things that are right ;
If you let your chances slip,
They may vanish from your sight.
Then do the thing that's right,
Find time to help another ;
Let love be the golden rule,
No time lost in endeavour.
"I like that," said Guy. "I think I will
have a try, too."
"Small beginnings may lead to great end-
ings," said the Memory Pricker.
Ting, ting, went a bell. A great noise
arose. Guy hurried out to see w hat it was
all about. People were hurrying along,
shouting "Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!"
"Kill who?" cried Guy, running up to a
small boy.
"Time, of course;" said the boy


"But why kill him," cried Guy. "What
has lie done?"
"'You simpleton," said the other, "have
you never heard of 'People killing time' or
'Murdering the time?'"
"Yes I have," remarked Guy; "but instead
of 'Killing 1 him, suppose you try and 'Keep'
time mv boy?" so saying, Guy stuck out his
leg and tripped him up. Guy heard Mr. l ime
laugh and shout out —
Tick, tick, said the clock upon a stick,
" Pride will have a fall," they say.
But Guy heard no more, for he had to
run, as the little boy was chasing him. He
ran and ran till he was nearly out of breath,
and thought the boy would soon catch him,
as he was gaining on him fast.
When he heard someone shaking him,
and saying, "Guy, dear! Guy, wake up! the
breakfast bell has rung, and you will be late
for school."


"Oh! Mother,'' said Guy, "can it all be
only a dream"
tk Yes, sonny; you have been very fast
asleep; but hurry, now, and you can tell me
your dream as soon as you are dressed."
While he was eating his breakfast, he told
his mother his dream.
"Was it not a strange dream, Mother'
"Yes, dearie; but strange dreams are often
sent us for some wise purpose, if we have
only the wisdom to understand the meaning
of them."
"You mean, Mother, it was sent to break
me of my fault of always saying I have no
time.' "
His mother smiled, and said "Just that,
sonny!"
In after years, Guy used to say that dream
of his was at the bottom of all his success
in life, as he mastered a bad fault, and at last
quite gave up saying "I have no time, but


always "found time" for everything, not
only in doing his own work, but also in
helping others, so that his life became a truly
happy and useful one.
And now, dear little readers, will you also
try and overcome your faults? Xot in your
own strength, for then you will sureb fail,
but in the strength of Him, who said Re
ye perfect, even as your Father in Heaven is
perfect." Then you, too, can claim the pro-
mise. which is this:—"He that overcometh
shall inherit all things, and I will be his God,
and he shall be my son. Rev. xxi. 7
" Time is short,
If idly spent, no art or care
Time's blessing can restore ;
And God requires a strict account
For everv misspent hour.
