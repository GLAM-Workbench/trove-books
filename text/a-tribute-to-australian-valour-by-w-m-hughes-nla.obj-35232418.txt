EXTRACT FROM SPEECH
DELIVERED AT BENDIGO,
SEPTEMBER 1, 1919
TT is now 16 months since I
1 left you. We have gone from
the very Nadir of our fortunes
to the very pinnacle of triumph.
You all remember March 21,
1918. To those who have not
imagination enough to conjure
up for yourselves the possibili-
ties of that fearful day, let
me say that on that day every-
thing we have in this world,
everything we value, unless we
are traitors to our country, to
our race, and to our liberties,
and civilisation, was in deadly
peril. The German legions
hacked their way through the
sth British Army and poured


headlong along the road to
Amiens. Early in April the roll-
ing tide of the war had come
within a few miles of Amiens, to
a place called Villers Breton-
neux. That name to you citizens
perhaps means nothing. But in
the days to come it will be
engraved in the hearts and in
the minds of future generations,
not only of Australia, but to all
men who love Australia. And
it will be like Thermopylae,
where the Spartans fell and died
to a man to save Greece. On
that day Amiens was in deadly
peril, and Paris, and all that
Paris stood for, was on the verge
of black disaster, when the
Australian brigades, or some of
them, were sent down hurriedly
from the north, and were hurled
against the mighty hosts of the
Germans advancing in high
triumph, flushed with victory,


and confident of success. And
the Australian brigades stayed
them. Most of them know the
place, and know what it all
meant. There were the fortunes
of this great war decided, and on
those fateful days in April, be-
tween the 4th and sth, and 24th
and 25th, there were fought
engagements, or the culminating
points of engagements, which
stemmed the onward rush of the
foe. From that day the Germans
never advanced one foot, but
day after day were pushed back
and back until they were sent
reeling back across their
vauntedly impregnable Hinden-
burg line, broken and defeated.
Everything we value was at
stake. In those days we were
urging the people to reinforce
the men —those men who were
working not 8 hours, but work-
ing day and night, and treble


shifts, who were asked to do
miracles, and who did them.
Some day historians will write
the of those days from
March 26, until the first week in
October, when the bulk of the
Australians were withdrawn
from the lines, when victory was
assured. A more glorious page
will never be written in the
history of any nation than the
pages written there. Our safety,
our liberty, and ideals were in
deadly peril.
Victory and fruits of victory
are now ours. Those islands
which are a rampart of Australia,
which are so situated that those
who hold them hold us, are now
in our possession. We are the
custodians. From this day to
the end of the world they are
ours unless we commit some act
of folly or cowardice that will
wrest them from us. We must


keep them. There is no other
way by which we can hold
Australia. I am not going to
speak of those 101 intricate
problems which relate to this
peace and negotiations that lead
up to it. Nor am I going to say
anything about the League of
Nations. I shall say nothing
of politics as generally under-
stood in this country. We in
Australia, by the grace of God,
are free people. By the valour
of our soldiers we are a free
people. Liberty and safety have
been given to us by the blood
and sacrifice of those who have
gone out to suffer sacrifice and
die. They have given it to us
like the great sacrifice made for
all mankind 2000 years ago. It
has made this country a great
and precious thing. Liberty
takes on a newer and a more
glorious aspedt. It is now stained


with the blood of the best and
bravest of those who died for
you and me. There were men
in this country, all of us in fact,
to whom liberty came as it were
without money and without
price. It cost nothing. There
were some who thought of it as
the eternal prerogative of man
to be free without deserving it,
without being prepared to do
that which free men did when
their liberty is assailed fight
for it. Since the war has passed
like a scourge over mankind all
those except the deliberately
blind will realise that liberty is
a thing precious beyond price.
It has been bought with the
blood of 60,000 young Austra-
lians. It was by the suffering,
privations and the heroisms of
the men who went out to fight
that we gained a free, a safe, and
a White Australia.
