Managerial Card.
The lack of Dramatic Entertainments of a Light, Mirthful, yet entirely
Harmless Character, so marked lately in Sydney, has led Messrs.
GOUBLAY and WALTON
to join their forces. To this combination will be added the attractions of a
First-class Company and a comf ox table theatre. The entertainment, whilst
avoiding on the one hand the style of the music hall, and on the other the
dullness of the legitimate Drama, will suit the popular tastes.
The performance will commence with H. T. Craven’s Celebrated Serio-Comic
Drama in Two Acts,
Milky White
Daniel White (anpopularly know as Milky White
a Cow-keeper) ... ... ... Mr. John Gourlay
Dick Duggs (a Oow-boy) ... ... ... Mr, George Walton
Archibald Good (a Veterinary Surgeon) ... ... Mr. Charles Lindsay
(First Appearance in Sydney).
Bude Boy ... ... ... ... Master Cheeky
Mrs. Saddrip ... ... ... ... ... Miss Ada Moxon
Annie White (Daughter of White, with song
“Early Love”) ... .« ... ... Miss Amy Gourlay
SCENE.—Dairy and Parlour of Milky White’s House.
(Painted expressly by Mr. B. Vaughan).
One night is supposed to elapse betweens the Acts.
(The Curtain will remain down Two Minutes only).
After the drama an Interval of 10 Minutes.

She Knew Her Deficiences.—Mr
Wickwire: But, my dear, you are so.
pretty that I really cannot see how
your beauty needs any addition in
the shape of such expensive finery as
you wish. —Mrs. Wickwire : No, I
am not. If I were as pretty as you
pretend I am, I would not have to
argue so long to get a new dress.
It has long since been known that
real meerschaum pipes are frequently
manufactured from the humble
potato ; but now, it appears, someone
has patented an invention for making
bone buttons from the internals of
that useful vegetable. If we have
got to come to this altogether, most
boys, anyhow, would prefer to have
the buttons on their clothes made of
toffee or almond rock, as being more
palatable in an emergency. There
seems to be no limit to the use of
articles of food in these days. The
cabbage-leaf that comes before us in
the shape of an after-dinner cigar, is
familiar to us all ; and we are only
waiting now for the man who can
manufacture an umbrella handle out
of compressed ice-cream, or condense
a modest B. and S. into the form of a
pocket pan-holder.
It is said Miss Sedohr, the new
prima donna of the Lyric Theatre,
brings with her, in addition to
natural gifts of grace and beauty, a
high reputation as a singer and
actress from both Paris and Italy.
Although American by birth, the
lady is but one remove from English
kindred, her father having been a
Yorkshire boy, who was taken at an
early age by his parents to the
United States, where years_ later he
took to himself an American wife.
The new comer’s curious Christian
name—Sedohr it will be noted, is her
surname reversed, which, to indulge
a whim of her father’s was really
given to her at the baptismal font.
Miss Rhodes, who hitherto sung only
at concerts, will really make her
debut on the stage as the heroine of
Lecocq’s comic opera.
In one of the far-off countries,
where civilisation is not at present
on speaking terms with the inhabit-
ants, it appears to be the practice,
whenever twins are born, to kill one
of them immediately. We happened
to mention the circumstance casually
to a friend of ours who has just had
a set of twins rigged up in his house,
and he appeared to be inexpressibly
pained at the intelligence. After a
moment’s reflection he asked, with
a pathetic quiver in his voice: “ But
wh—why do they only kill one ? ”
Old Henry VIII. was an eccentric
wooer. He never popped the question.
He just married a woman and then
axed her afterwards.
Hot to bh Found.
You may come across some wonders
in the course of your career,
From a cabman who will ask his
legal fare
To an actor with a very poor opinion
of himself,
Ora girl wh( for flirtation doesn’t
care.
You may even find a “ p’leeceman”
with a liking for the truth,
A woman who’ll confess she’s get-
ting old;
But you’ll never find a girl who, when
she’s asked to sing a song,
Doesn’t first declare she’s got “ an
awful cold.”
Footpad : Hold up your hands I

His Only Chanch. —“ A man
can’t help his personal appearance,”
said Rowne de Bout. “He can’t
select his eyes or his hair.” “ No,”
replied Upson Downes, thoughtfully;
“ he is lucky in these times if he can
pick his teeth,”
Why is a watchdog larger at night
than he is in the morning ? Be-
cause he is let out at night and
taken in in the morning.
Over and Ova ! “ It’s getting
warm, isn’t it ? ” said one young
chicken to another which had just
emerged from the shell. “Yes,”
replied the other. “ That’s the rea-
son I left off my ova coat.”

One female companion to solace my

Three dogs and a gun when to sport
I incline,
Four horses and buggies to indulge me
and mine,
Fire jolly companions with whom to
make merry,
Six dishes each day, with six glasses
of sherry,
Seven beds in my house for my
friends at their leasure.
Eight somethings or other to add to
their pleasure,
Nine pounds in my pocket when cash
I require,
And a passport to heaven when
from earth I retire.

there are a largeness of purpose, a

comprehensiveness about this bachelor

When Thompson’s wife had left the
room,
As soon as he had missed her
He threw his arms around the pretty
servant girl and kissed her.
Asked she—“ Pray, are my kisses
sweet
As those pluck’d from your wife 7 ”
Said he—“ Hers don’t compare with
yours ;
They don't, upon my life ! ”
Said she—“ Your taste, Pm sure, no
one can blame;
Coachman and Deacon say the same.”
The liar catches fish with his
mouth.
It is hardly square to send a blind
man to jail for having no visible

are renewing their application to the I
London County Council for a music

the new Rosebery Avenue into a
first-class music-hall at an estimated
outlay of £15,000.

is to be resumed, with the probability
of this magnificent Shakesperian
pagent lasting on until Christmas,
soon after which it will give place to
another in the revival of “King Lear,”
a tragedy Mr. Irving has publicly
pronounced to be in his judgement
“ perhaps Shakespeares masterpiece.”
Certainly if “ King Lear” is not its
author’s grandest play, it is his
grandest character.
Miss Kate Vaughan has made
mock to an interviewer of the pre-
tensions of certain figurantes to
having invented serpentine dancing
Miss Vaughan asserts that she has
often used this choreographic device
herself, after having learned it, as she
frankly avows, in her early days from
Donato, the agile one-legged dancer.
Mr. Arthur Roberts has an idea
that there is a false impression pre-
vailing with regaad to the postpone-
ment of his appearance as the star
Comedian of the Gaiety -Theatre, for
which position he some little time
back signed a contract with the
directors of the Gaiety Theatre Com-
pany, he to appear there on the 24th
of December of this year. He wishes
ir to be understood that the post-
ponement of such appearance is due
to his desire to meet the wishes of
Mr. George Edwardes, who found an
opportunity of utilising for a further
period the valuable services of Mr,
Fred. Leslie. Consequently Mr.
Arthur Roberts bas consented to play
for a season at the Prince of Wales’
' Theatre at the conclusion of his
present tour with Two Lovely Black
\ Eyed Susan , but in doing so he
i wishes it to be distinctly understood
i that he in no way relinquishes his
rights at the Gaiety Theatre.

Gaiety Theatre, |
Large audiences testify nightly their
appreciation of the amusement proffered
at this place of entertainment, and it is
really worth a visit, being fully "up to
date ”as regards all the latest music hall ,
novelties. A good working company is
invariably to be found here, and judging
by the applause which follows the various
“ turns,” the patrons are pleased with the
performance. Mr. Dan Tracey, who is
very popular, leaves the management
almost entirely to his able lieutenant,
Mr. Alf. M. Hazlewood, with excellent
results. On Saturday night Mr. Will
Stevens, a clever comedian, was added to
the company—his appearance was warmly
welcomed. The stream of entertainment
here is well filtered, and discreet catering
has propelled It to the position which it
now enjoys—hence the tegular patrons
repair thither because there is always to
be found a programme of amusement abt
bountiful as it is good in quality. Mr. Wi
Warner still famishes good examples oil
his humour, and Misses Florrie Porde,
Amy Rowe, Minnie Shipp, Ida Clarkson,!
the Abbott Sisters, the Misses Howard,;
Messrs. Frank Yorke, Harry Crawford*,
Edwin Shipp. Harry Clay, and Arthufi
Farley, keep their audiences thoroughly'
interested by their merry songs and'
bristling dances, all of which are enter-
prisingly executed. A farce, being a
travestie on “ Under the Gaslight,” has to
be taken at headlong speed ; the fun
must be fast and furious if it is to be
appreciated. Mr. W. Warner plays
“ Booser” with “Spirit.” The piece may
be summed up as business first and
dialogue after—“ it aint exactly what we
says, its the funny way we does it,” —so
the company must have been gratified by
the continuous roars of laughter which
greeted their opportunities.

“ Why mayn’t I go to the theatre
with you mamma?” “ Because it is
a tragedy, and you couldn’t under-

“Yes, but you couldn’t understand
what they were talking about. You
don’t know enough.” “ Well, I don’t

preacher is talkin’ ’bout either, but

Bow-street, London. —Serious
Charge—Horace Leonard, an actor,
was charged with fraud, the prisoner
had induced Messrs. Gatti to change
worthless cheques for him.—William
Turrell, detective inspector, of Scot-
land-yard, stated that he saw the
prisoner at Victoria Station just as
he arrived by a special train from
Leeds. He told him he had a
warrant for his arrest. The prisoner
said “ what for ? ” Witness read
the warrant to him, and said “ there
are two other charges against you.”
The prisoner replied “ 1 know all
about it, but I did not think Messrs.
Gatti would do this. They did not
communicate with me.”—Witness re-
marked “Ho ; because they did not
know where to find you,” Whilst
proceeding to Bow-street in a cab
prisoner said " I heard at Glasgow
that the police were after me. I en-
deavoured to ascertain what it was
for, but was not successful. I know
I treated Messrs. Gatti rather badly,
I ought to have seen them before I
left London.” There were found on
the prisoner one blank cheque and
an unstamped postal order—ln reply
to the Magistrate who suggested that
there would be no difficulty in tracing
a man so well known as the defenden-
dent, witness stated that every inquiry
had been made. It was now known
that he had been playing with Mr.
Arthur Roberts’s Company, but when
the manager was written to he said
there was no such man with him It
appeared that he had been going
under an assumed name. Prisoner
was remanded.

We hope that Messrs. Qourlav and Walton (
will have reason to rejoice over their new ,
method of appeal, and wish them great
and abiding success. Saturday night last i
was fixed for the new departure, and a \
big crowd filled the building. The enter- (
tainment commenced with the customary
overture, which was well rendered by
Mr. Harcourt Lee and those who follow \
his beat, after which the two act piece of (
Craven’s “ Milky White,” was performed.
Mr. John Qomrlay as Daniel White and
Mr. George Walton as Dick Dugg’s gave
us homely pictures complete in their
minutest details, humour and pathos
being harmoniously blended in such a
manner that the embodiments cannot
fail to enhance these clever actor’s repu-
tation. Miss Amy Gourlay, though long
absent from the stage, is armed with
those qualifications which deserve to
bring her into prominence. As Annie
White she had a cordial reception. Mr.
Charles Lindsay played the Lover, and
Miss Ada Moxon, the Landlady. Thus
the characters being in the hands of
capable people, the performance was
rendered doubly enjoyable. An Olio
followed, in which Miss Nora O’Shan-
nessy took part. Mr. Gourlay and Miss
Grace Freeman sang the Scottish duet,
“ When ye gang awa, Jamie. ” An
original quiet change sketch, “Alice
Again,” was given by Mr, John Gourlay
very cleverly, showing that the fever for
reducing theatres to a complexion of
“ variety ” is taking an epidimic form.
A farcical comedy entitled “ Living

dyspepsia, if you mean to go serntinis-
ingly into the real probabilities of the
plot, do not go to the Garrick. But if
you want to get rid of bores, if your
motto is “ Begone dull care I ” it you
want to do what the French call
desopiler 'la rate , get rid of ‘ your spleen,
then by all means go and see the “ living
statues,” laugh at the nonsense, listen to
the dialogue, and ask no more. Absurd f
Of course it is. No common sense 7 Not

RATHER OBJECTIONABLE TO THE
LADIES.
The Americans are rather fond of the original.
Besides idlers in the States go in lor a certain
amount of drollery in their games of cards,
which is carried out thus:—A bit of burnt cork
is provided, and, as often as a player loses, a
dainty spot of ebony is imprinted on his or hsr
face. The effect is sufficiently ludicrous if the
player be unlucky. The sight of a grave aud
sedate elderly female, with the tip of her nose,
tl'c corners of her mouth, her temples and her
cheeks touched with black is said to be verjr
trying to the rising faculties. A little artirab
skill in the use of burnt oork enables the marker
to completely ehange the expression of the face
upon whith he is operating. This may be rather
grotesque, but it is a form of ornamentation that
most “ladle*” weald be InoUned to object to.
