PLANTS COLLECTED IN CAPRICORNIC WESTERN
AUSTRALIA, BY H. S. KING, ESQ, AND
RECORDED BY BARON VON MUELLER,
K.C.M.G, M. & Ph.D, F.R.S.
[Bead 13th June, 1886.]
During the last year survey-operations were carried on
between the Lyons- and Fortescue-Rivers, as well as on and
near the Upper Ashburton-River, by Mr. H. S. King, under
the direction of the Honourable John Forrest, C.M.G,
F.L.S, F.R.G.S.; and on this occasion again, through the
influence of the enlightened Minister of Lands and Surveyor-
General of the colony, specimens of the plants, met
during the survey, were secured, and through Mr. Forrest?s
liberality placed at my disposal. As the region, from which
this collection was obtained, is 'phytogeographically a most
interesting one, the tropical and extra-tropical species of the
western part of the Australian continent largely meeting in
the tracts of country traversed by Mr. King, it is my
purpose, to enumerate in these pages the species obtained, by
which means new localities of many rare plants will be
placed on record, and some new forms will become eluci-
dated, while by these means also some further impetus in
various parts of Australia will be given perhaps for utilising
the splendid opportunities, when surveys are effected in new
districts, to enrich collaterally also our knowledge of the
native vegetation and the resources connected therewith.
Cleome tetrandra, Banks; var. grandior. Taller and
more robust; leaflets broader; style longer, very thin and
curved; stigma not dilated ; fruit more distinctly stipitated.
Cleome viscosa, Linn A Fruit always without any
stipes; seeds smaller and darker coloured than those of
the preceding species. * The variety grandiflora, noted by
Bentham, is in the third supplement to the Systematic Census
of Australian Plants 'raised to specific rank under the
above appellation. Some of the shorter filaments are
remarkably thickened near the summit, almost as in the
American species of the section Physostemon. The ripe
fruit of C. grandiflora remained hitherto unknown.


Byblis liniflora, Salisbury. Fully a foot high.
Drosera Indica, Linne.
Tribulus platypterus, Bentham.
Triumfetta chsetocarpa, F. v. M.
Sida lepida, F. v. M.
Abutilon longilobum, F. v. M. A variety with leaves
less elongated and more definitely star-hairy, with calyces
not always cleft beyond the middle, and with the petals
usually longer.
Hibiscus trionum, Linnd
Hibiscus Goldsworthii, F. v. M. The specimens of this
highly ornamental plant show larger leaves with longer lobes,
also capsules of only about half the length of the calyx.
Gossypium Sturtii, F. v. M.
Gossypium Robinsonii, F, v. M.
Gossypium australe, F. v. M,
Brachychiton platanoides, R. Brown, Passes also in
Eastern Australia just beyond the tropic of Capricorn.
Euphorbia Careyi, F. v. M. Fruit not fully �th inch
long, three-lobed globular; seeds trigonous-ovate, dark-
brown, minutely scaly-hairy, destitute of any appendage.
Euphorbia Drummondi, Boissier. Specimens over a foot
broad.
Securinega Abyssinica, A, Richard.
Dodonaea petiolaris, F. v. M. Sepals five, oblong-
lanceolar, long. Fruit roundish-ovate in outline, about
H inch long and f inch broad, glabrous, almost vesicular,
finely veined, short-pointed at the summit, the three longi-
tudinal expanding membranes much narrower than the
cells of the fruit, confluent with each other at the upper
extremity,not forming lobes on the base; ripe seeds unknown.
This species was also found near the Finke-River by Rev.
H. Kempe, and near the Lachlan-River by Mr. Josephson.
Dodonaea pachyneura.?Branchlets slightly angular;
leaves narrow-lanceolar, entire, gradually attenuated into
a slender petiole, prominently penninerved, as well as the
branchlets densely beset with glandular dots ; sepals broadly
semi-lanceolar; pedicels usually two or three together, as
long as, or somewhat longer, than the fruit, very thin ;
capsules three-celled, somewhat viscid, the expanding mem-
branes broader than the cavities, gradually narrowed to near
the very short septa, each thus almost including the apper-
taining roundish-turgid cell, and giving each of the three


partitions of the fruit an oblique rhomboid-ovate shape, the
upper margin of the membrane more truncate, the lower
more rounded ; septa not fully half as long as the cells and
seceding with them.
The whole plant sticky from minute glandular promi-
nences. Leaves flat, dark-green, on the only specimen
obtained 1? long, above the middle about
broad, some faint denticulations occasionally developed at
the margin. Sepals nearly 1-1 Oth inch long. Staminate
flowers not obtained. Partitions of fruit broader than
long, their membranes very divergent, conspicuously veined,
rather obtuse at the terminating angle; stipes very short.
Style and ripe seeds not available.
From D. platyptera, the nearest allied species, this new
one recedes in greater viscidity, in narrower downward
much more attenuated leaves, with singularly prominent
and more copious nerves, as well as in the extension of the
fruit-membranes along the summit and base of the cells, and
further in the remarkable smallness of the septa.
Polycarpaea Indica, Lamarck., var. obtusiflora. The
plants only about two inches high, but much branched and
profusely flowering; sepals rather blunt; capsule exceedingly
short. Perhaps this variety will, under the above name,
have to be raised to a specific position.
Polycarpaea longiflora, F. v. M.
Mollugo trigastrotheca, F. v. M.
Trianthema crystallina, Yahl.
Trianthema pilosa, F. v, M.
Achyranthes aspera, Linne. Reaches the most northern
regions of New South Wales (Fawcett).
Amarantus pallidiflorus, F. v. M.
Ptilotus obovatus, F. v. M.
Ptilotus exaltatus, Nees.
Ptilotus alopecuroides, F. v. M.
Ptilotus helipteroides, F. v. M.
Ptilotus fusiformis, Poiret. Mr. Moritz Holtze found
this plant also near Port Darwin.
Ptilotus axillaris, F. v. M.
Gomphrena canescensi R. Brown,
Gomphrena Maitlandi, F. v. M. Specimens with flower-
heads partially axillary.
Gomphrena platandra, F. v. M. Under this new name
a species is defined, which from the only other Austra-


lian congener with filaments dilated and at the summit
bidenticulated, namely G. conica, differs in diffuse growth,
in shorter leaves, in unchanging globular flower-heads sup-
ported by two floral leaves, in larger bracteoles of greater
length than the calyx, and in the rosy colour of the sepals.
From the following species it is distinguished in broader
leaves, in much larger and never elongated flower-heads, as
well as in the toothed apex of the filaments.
Gomphrena conferta, Bentham. This was found by the
Hon. J, Forrest also on the Yule- and Shirlock-Rivers. There
likewise G. tenella occurs, but with finally spicate inflores-
cence.
Alternanthera triandra, Lamarck.
Codonocarpus cotinifolius, F. v. M.
Isotropis atropurpurea, F. v. M. Fruit about f-inch long;
seeds kidney-shaped, |-inch long, prominently reticulated.
Gastrololium grandiflorum, F. v. M.
Crotalaria Novae Hoi land he, De Candolle.
Crotalaria Cunninghami, R. Brown.
Crotalaria dissitiflora, Bentham.
Crotalaria medicaginea, Lamarck.
Lotus australis, Andrews. Now also known from New
Caledonia, the New Hebrides and Japan.
Psoralea leucantha, F. v. M.
Indigofera monophylla, De Candolle.
Tephrosia purpurea, Persoon. The silky variety obtained ;
also what seems a form with very narrow leaflets, but
gathered without fruit.
Sesbania grandiflora, Persoon.
Clianthus Dampieri, Cunningham.
Swainsona Macculochiana, F. v. M.
Swainsona Kingii. Slightly hairy, soon glabrous;
stipules very large, semicordate-lanceolar; leaflets of each
leaf in two to three rather distant pairs, somewhat glaucous,
nearly lanceolar, on very short stalklets, not darker above ;
peduncles almost capillary, fully as long as the leaves,
bearing at and towards the upper end two to four rather
small flowers ; pedicels much shorter than the calyx, not
much longer than the small lanceolate-linear ciliate bracts;
lobes of the calyx narrow-lanceolar, about as long as the
hemi-ellipsoid tube ; upper petal considerably longer than the
others, cordate-orbicular, with two faintly prominent erect
lines extending from the base to beyond the middle ; lower


petals acute, not twisted, nearly as long as the blunt lateral
petals; style towards the summit anteriorly short-hearded;
ovary slender, glabrous. Between the Gascoyne- and Fortes-
cue Rivers; H. S. King, Esq.
Branches slender; stipules mostly about f inch long;
leaflets � ?| inch long, but occasionally the terminal one
exceeding the others in size ; calyces nearly \ inch long.
Lamina of upper petal measuring fully � inch, its stipes
tender-membranous; lateral and lower petals violet-coloured
towards the summit. Anthers narrow-ellipsoid. Style but
slightly curved. Stigma very minute. Fruit not obtained.
This species may systematically be approximated to
S. oroboides, which it resembles often in foliage ; but the
stipules in the last-mentioned congener are minute, the
peduncles and pedicels thicker, the calyces permanently
hairy, while the petals are less unequal in length, the lateral
two broader, the lower two blunt, the upper having very
prominent callosities, which terminate almost truncately just
above the stipes, the style is more rigid and the ovary
downy; in fruit S. Kingii may also prove very different.
The great development of the stipules, which exceed in size
much any of the leaflets, separates this species at once from
all others.
Glycine sericea, Bentham. Found as far north as the
Mulligan-River by Mr. Cornish.
Cajanus cinereus, F. v. M.
Petalostylis labicheoides, R. Brown.
Cassia venusta, F. v. M.
Terminalia circumalata, F. v. M. This is the doubt-
ful Alectryon canescens (D. C. Prodr. I, 617), which was
probably described from specimens gathered during Captain
Bandin's expedition, and thus likely on the west-coast, not
in Eastern Australia, as so long was supposed. I owe an
original specimen to the kindness of the illustrious Alphonse
de Candolle.
Pimelea ammocharis,. F. v. M.
Hakea lorea, R. Brown, Collected on the Upper Flinders-
River by Mr. Dugan, .
Grevillea Wickhami, Meissner.
Cucurais Chate, Linnd.
Melothria Maderaspatana, Cogniaux. A variety with
sessile leaves, precisely of the form, peculiar to those of
M. amplexicaulis, but with the not pedunculate staminate


flower-fascicles, with the sphaerical fruit and with the
unmargined seeds of M. Maderaspatana.
Brachycome iberidifolia, Bentham,
Pterocaulon sphacelatum, Bentham.
Helipterum floribundum, De Candolle.
Helipterum Humboldtianum, De Candolle.
Helipterum roseum, Bentham. Eastward to Georgina-
Range (Harper).
Podolepis rugata, Labillardibre.
Calocephalus multiflorus, Bentham. A form with broader
leaves.
Eriochlamys Kappii, F. v. M.
Flaveria Australasica, Hooker. Traced southwards to the
Bogan (Wuerfel).
Lobelia humistrata, F. v. M.
Lobelia heterophylla, Labillardibre.
Scaevola ovalifolia, R. Brown.
Cynanchum floribundum, R. Brown.
Ipomcea Muelleri, Bentham.
Evolvulus linifolius, Linnd
Breweria rosea, F. v. M. A variety with smaller flowers,
also a state of this plant with grey vestiture.
Solanum phloraoides, Cunningham.
Nicotiana suaveolens, Lehmann. A minute variety.
Mimulus gracilis, R. Brown. Mr. St. Carey found this
also on the Lyndon-River; the allied M. prostratus we
have now also from near Everard-Range (Giles), the Wim-
mera (DAlton) and Dandenong (Walter).
Stemodia grossa, Bentham.
Stemodia viscosa, Roxburgh. A form with much elon-
gated pedicels.
Buechnera parviflora, R. Brown.
Pollichia Zeilanica, F. v. M.
Heliotropium undulatum, Vahl. This occurs also on
the Finke-River, according to collections from the Rev. H.
Kempe.
Clerodendrum lanceolatum, F, v. M.
Chloanthes paniculata, F. v. M.
Eremophila maculata, F. v. M.
Eremophila Forresti, F. v. M,
Eremophila leucophylla, F. v. M.
Eremophila Fraseri, F. v. M. Both varieties gathered
of this species, the one with short roundish leaves and the


other with elongated lanceolar leaves ; the first mentioned is
easily mistaken for E. rotundifolia.
Cyperus ixiocarpus. Stem cylindrical, finely streaked-
furrowed, smooth; floral leaves three or four, the two
longest of these generally much surpassing the inflorescence,
channelled towards the base, thence upwards compressed-
cylindrical and gradually much attenuated, smooth, one or
two of the floral leaves very abbreviated; primary peduncles
several, almost umbellate, unequal in length, smooth, not
prominently angular; secondary peduncles almost umbel-
lately crowded, very thin, each supported by a diminutive,
narrow, bract-like leaf; spikelets almost sessile, corymbous-
umbellulate, with a linear-lanceolate one-nerved glume-
like bract at the base, generally but few of the spikelets in
each of the umbellules; racheoles flexuous, simply angular,
not or scarcely membranously dilated, bearing six to thirteen
florets, the latter somewhat remote from each other, the two
or three uppermost sterile; glumes (floral bracts) pale-
brownish, almost cymbiform-ovate, mucronulate, strongly
five- to seven-nerved, the middle nerve keel-like; stigmas
three, about as long as the style; fruits obovate-trigonous,
black, shining, viscid, apiculate, somewhat more than half as
long as the glumes.
This remarkably handsome species had been already in
1882 collected on the Gascoyne-River by the Hon. J.
Forrest during his trigonometric surveys there. All the
specimens obtained are devoid of roots and radical leaves.
In vain have I endeavoured to identify this Cyperus
with any of the species described by Kunth, Steudel,
Boeckeler and Clarke. But this task is difficult as regards
a genus, containing several hundred well-marked species,
irrespective of their varieties. Our plant is however
traceable to a position near the tropical American C.
viscosus; but the spikelets are not capitately clustered, nor
are the florets closely imbricated; while the glumes are
more scarious, evidently viscid, stronger nerved and more
prominently keeled, the fruits moreover being somewhat
longer, more sticky, less pyriform, nor covered by a grey
pellicle.
Setaria verticillata, Beauvois.
Panicum pauciflorum, R. Brown, The fastigiate variety.
This grass was obtained near Short?s Range by J, Macd.
Stuart.


Eriachne obtusa, R. Brown.
Eriachne aristidea, F. v. M. Specimens with leaves
somewhat hairy outside.
Eriachne glauca, R. Brown. The leaves on the inner
side towards the base sometimes hairy.
Eriachne ovata, Nees. A small-flowered variety was
found by Mr. H. Stuart Carey on the Fortescue-River.
Triodia Mitchelli, Bentham. A variety with contracted
panicles and with particularly large spikelets, the middle
lobe of the flowering glume attaining a length of fully
a quarter of an inch. Only the inflorescence in Mr. King?s
collection, but this as well of pale as of purplish-darkish
colour.
Pappophorum commune, F. v. M.
Eragrostis speciosa, Steudel. Grain ovate, three or
four times shorter than the flowering glume. Mr. Ch.
Winneke brought a dwarf form of this grass from Eyre?s
Creek.
Eragrostis eriopoda, Bentham. Collected also near
Charlotte-Waters by Mr. E. Giles, and between the Lachlan-
and Darling-Rivers by Mr. R. Bennett.
Eragrostis tenella, Beauvois.
Chloris scariosa, F. v. M.
Astrebla pectinata, F. v. M.
Andropogon Australis, Sprengel. Along with the normal
form a variety, remarkable for its quite pale vestiture.
Andropogon Gryllus, Linnd.
Antldstiria ciliata, Linnd, fil.
Anthistiria membranacea, Lindley.
Erianthus fulvus, Kunth.
Cheilanthes tenuifolia, Swartz.
Cheilanthes vellea, F. v. M.
Mr. King?s collection contains also another Stemodia,
which was not known from Australia before, and seems also
unrecorded from Southern Asia or elsewhere. I have
designated it specifically with the finder?s name, but in
absence of fruit the plant cannot be described satisfactorily,
nor be placed sectionally into the genus, though it would likely
merge into Limnophila. The plant is glabrous ; the leaves
are opposite and remain well green in drying; the upper,
(which alone became available,) are linear or narrow-lanceolar
and not distinctly denticulated; the flowers are nearly
sessile, solitary in the axils; the bracteoles narrow-lanceolar,


Plants Collected in Capricornic Western Australia. 9
much shorter than the calyx; the three outer segments of
the latter are \ ?f-inch long, of herbaceous texture, almost
lanceolar, the two inner very considerably narrower, but
nearly as long; the corolla is glabrous, except inside near
the base, and a little hairiness occurs also on the upper
lobes; the tube is broadly cylindrical, almost as long as the
labia; the upper lip is bifid, _ thus producing orbicular-
cuneate lobes; the lower lip is bluntly 3-dentated; the
filaments are conspersed with stipitate minute glands; the
anthers have their cells parallel but almost disconnected, and
are fixed from a dorsal small protuberance to the filament;
the style is glabrous; the stigma divided into two semi-
orbicular lobes; the ovary ovate-conical, glabrous and
pointed.
