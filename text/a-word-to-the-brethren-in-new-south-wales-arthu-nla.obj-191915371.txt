A WORD TO THE BRETHREN IN NEW
SOUTH WALES.
With very great reluctance the writer of this brief paper
addresses brethren of another Church on a matter which natively
belongs to that Church’s jurisdiction. Were it not for the
intimate relations in which the Free Churches in Australia stand
to one another, and their deep interest in each other’s welfare,
nothing would induce the writer to proceed with his task. But
the Free Churches in Australia cannot stand in isolation from one
another. Close correspondence of various kinds has already
sprung up among them, and Scripture authority is express that
when one member suffers all the members suffer with it. Little
space can be spared for preamble in such a leaflet as this, and the
occasion of writing may at once therefore be stated. It is
THE QUARREL BETWEEN REY P. MTHERSON AND
REY. G. SUTHERLAND.
A good deal always depends on the aspect under which a case
is presented, and therefore the heading which has now been used to
bring forward the matter in hand may likely enough give
umbrage to both of the antagonists. For no doubt it does not
introduce the dispute between them in a manner that is flattering
to either. Mr. M‘Pherson claims a concern for the interests of
truth and righteousness as his motive in publishing the paper
which gave rise to this contention. Mr. Sutherland, in repelling
the attack, moves in an atmosphere of at least as high pretension.
But, these lofty claims notwithstanding, this unbrotherly dispute,
since it passed its opening stage, has shown nothing in such large
proportions to a dispassionate onlooker as the presence of very
embittered passions and unsanctified tempers; neither is there any
course that seems fitted to serve the ends of justice more suitably


than the administration by the Church of very serious admonition
and reproof to both the principals in this ill-conducted quarrel.
This admits of being said without prejudice to a limited area of
observation, within which the merits cf the quarrel distribute
themselves very unequally between the two disputants, and
incline very unequivocally to the side of Mr. M‘Pherson. But
before going inside this comparatively narrow siding, or seeking to
hold the balance between the two rivals, it, will be best to go
7 o
above the initial point from which the two opponents have chosen
to date their contention. If the lovers of the Free Church in
these colonies will look at the original head-spring out of which this
quarrel has emerged, they will find themselves in the presence of
an issue of the very highest importance, and one which places the
welfare of all the Free Churches in these colonies dangerously at
stake. The leading element in this unhappy business is some-
thing which neither Mr. M‘Pherson nor Mr. Sutherland allows to
come prominently, as it deserves, to the surface. But it shapes
itself into an uneasy inquiry as to the system pursued in Sydney
in
THE EXAMINING AND ADMITTING OF STUDENTS
FOR THE MINISTRY OF THE FREE CHURCH.
This is, in effect, the one question of real—that is to say, of
abiding and public—interest which the Free Churches have to deal
with in the quieting of this dispute. The writer of the present
paper finds no difficulty in coming to a very decided conclusion
on this main point; and he inclines to insist on it the more
because it receives the go-bye from both the rivals in this con-
troversy, although its importance is paramount. There has been
no proper care taken, nor anything like judicious discrimination
used, in the selection of candidates for the Free Church ministry
by the parties in this quarrel ; and the Free Churches in all the
colonies are alike endangered by this careless and unconscientious
looseness. If any one matter more than another imperatively
demanded prayerful anxiety—yes, and godly jealousy—it was
this: lest unworthy characters should obtain a footing in the
Church’s teaching staff. That no such godly jealousy had been
used is manifest. The evidence for this conclusion, which the
writer states strongly—that is, with strong confidence in its cor-
rectness—is apparent in the events which have followed out of
this pernicious laxity. What are the disturbance, the crimination
and recrimination, in the Smith and Ashley-mm-Bates embroglio
but the outcome of a church-extension policy which resembles
nothing so much as the misguided zeal condemned in Scripture of
men who imagine to build the house of God with “ wood and hay
and stubble,” Surely no man who could have the opportunity of


speaking five minutes with the Mr. Smith of this affair need have
been at a loss to see that he cared for the Free Church as much
as he cared for any other Church. That is to say, he valued it
according as it promised to find a place for him in its ministry—
and no more. It did not need much discerning of spirits to per-
ceive by such a specimen that candidates for the Free Church
ministxy had been selected without godly jealousy for that
Church’s welfare when as little intelligent acquaintance with or
hearty appreciation of its principles, doctrines, worship and
fellowship sufficed for a man who held the grade of a divinity
student in her schools of instruction. And now we are informed
of another out of the trio just mentioned that he has become a
Plymouthist; it is not necessary to require further evidence after
that. This pernicious and suicidal negligence in a matter so
vital as the selection of divinity students is disquieting to a
degree that gives every minister of the Free Church in any of the
colonies a right to complain of it, and according to his ability
sternly to reprobate it. It is not with bated breath, but with
very uncompromising vehemence, that the writer of this paper
protests against such treacherous progress. Nothing is to be
gained, everything is imperilled, by such slipshod facility in looking
out and accepting candidates for the ministerial office.
So lightly has the future welfare of the Free Churches been
regarded in this affair that the inquiry into it can scarcely take
end without looking narrowly at the Free Church bond jides of
those whose hand has been most deeply involved. Both Mr.
Sutherland and Mr. M‘Pherson may lay their account with
having either their judgment or their bond fides as Free Church
leaders or professors very freely canvassed after such an outcome
of their joint proceedings. It is beyond the need of any qualifi-
cation to affirm that a very few ripe fruits of such professorial
labours as they have both been concerned in in turning out licen-
tiates of the Smith description would exhale Free Church prin-
ciples, doctrine and worship out of the Free Church altogether.
In framing a judgment for himself on this miserable exhibition
of professorial inaptitude, the writer has small difficulty in
placing the blame in largest proportion to the side of Mr.
M'Phei’son in point of deficient judgment, and to the side of Mr.
Sutherland in largest proportion in respect of deficient bond fides
towards the Free Church. The thought which really comes
uppermost in a survey of this unhappy strife, and the Smith-cwm-
Bates occasion out of which it arose, emex’ges in the form of a
doubt or a misgiving, or even a conclusioxx ixx the negative, as to
the questioxi whether Mr. Sutherland is axxy Free Churchman,
properly speaking, at all 1 This is a question which may barely
suggest itself, but it will, almost as soon as it is suggested, be
resolved in tlxe affixmative, on the strength of former evidence,
with respect to Mr. M‘Pherson, The heavy blame abides, never-


theless, as a burden which the two disputants must share and
share alike between them. They have both been principals in a
method of procuring and training students for the Free Church
which is fitted very speedily to accomplish that there shall be no
Free Church left at all.
THE THREAT OF EXCOMMUNICATION
may now be looked at, as it has been freely bandied about in the
pages of Mr. Sutherland’s newspaper In this particular we cannot
treat the two disputants on one and the same footing. Mr.
M £ Pherson has no opportunity of lifting this weapon against his
opponent, and the writer believes that, whatever Mr. M‘Pherson’s
deficiencies may be, he would not lift such a weapon to gratify a
personal animosity if he had the power. There is no other way
of regarding Mr. Sutherland in this particular except as an
aggressor, presumptuously, and indeed sacrilegiously, laying hands
on a very sacred ordinance of the Lord Jesus Christ, and blindly
trying to make the Great Head of the Church himself a party to
his bitter contention. It would be time enough to speak of
ecclesiastical censure in this affair, even supposing Mr. Sutherland
were not well in the position of an offender who ought long since
to have been a subject of presbyterial inquiry and monition him-
self. Mr. Sutherland has mistaken the Church with which he is now
connected, and mistaken its spirit, as he has little sympathy for its
history. But until Mr. Sutherland’s appearance in the Free Church,
habitual Sabbath-breaking was not a fault that could be made a
charge against any of that Church’s ministers. The facts in regard
to Mr. Sutherland’s practice in this respect are well known, and
simply the case is this : that if profanation of the Lord’s day by
riding in vehicles plying for hire on the Sabbath be any sin, the
presbytery to which Mr. Sutherland belongs, and his superior
Church Court, should have proceeded against him long ago, and
put an end to his practice or to their connection with him. That
they never did so may perhaps be the sin—a participation in
another man’s sin—which is now finding them out in this
unhappy schism which is rending their unity. No doubt the bold
offender in this matter has compounded the guilt of it with his
own conscience, and perhaps has been seduced by the sinful
negligence of his brethren to flatter himself that there is no sin
in such bold Sabbath-breaking, or in the evil example it sets. A
little plain speaking on their part might have either reclaimed the
offender, or, at all events, it would have cleared them from com-
plicity with the offence.
But it is curious enough how men that are most obnoxious to
discipline are the foremost to brandish it over the heads of their
brethren. Judah, the arch offender in a case of immorality, was


loud in his zeal for domestic purity against his daughter-in-law,
until she compelled him to recognize her as the partner of his
guilt. And the men who wanted to turn Christ’s censure against
a fellow sinner did not know who they were dealing with till his
access to their conscience proved that the Heart-searcher had
them in hand, and they went out one by one from His presence.
It might be well for Mr. Sutherland, before laying hands on the
weapons of church discipline and excommunication, to examine
his hands and see whether they are clean and will abide the
judgment of eyes which are as a flame of fire. If he thinks they
are, it is only a marked instance of moral colour-blindness.
IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO DEFEND MR. MTHERSON
out and out in order to disqualify Mr. Sutherland from being his
prosecutor. Whether Mr. Sutherland is the right man in the
right place when invoking fulminations of church censure upon his
brother has been shown. Enough to put the would-be censurer out
of court lies on the very surface, and Mr. Sutherland may there-
fore be placed outside the scope of any further remarks on this
point. But, turning to consider Mr. M‘Pherson’s methods of
warfare, it is less than unnecessary to commend some of them.
From and since the moment when the provoking methods of his
antagonist began to gall him, neither the spirit nor the forum
in which Mr. M'Pherson conducted his war of reprisals has been
worthy of a good cause. “ A man for conscience sake suffering
wrongfully,” does not please the Master by “ going to law before
unbelievers.” The infidel tribunal of secular newspapers, or even
the too frequently biassed tribunals of denominational magazines, is
not a fitting court of appeal for such “griefs” as “conscience toward
God ” may infer upon a man. Neither is the publication of docu-
ments not given under any idea of publication —which appears at
least to have been threatened—the resource of an honourable
spirit under even severe provocation. In these methods and
weapons Mr. M‘Pherson has not shone as a combatant in a good
warfare or a hero of the faith. For even if a man offers himself
in the cause which he esteems to be Christ’s, and the cause of
truth and justice, “ yet is he not crowned except he strive law-
fully.” He must condescend to no unhallowed weapons. But
whatever Mr. M‘Pherson has done in this way is venial as
compared with a presumptuous lifting of Christ’s sharp sword of
discipline with unclean hands. This last boldness Mr. M‘Pherson
has not permitted himself to attempt, nor does the writer of this
paper think that Mr. M‘Pherson would lift such a weapon if his
opportunities of doing so were much greater than they are.
The truth is that the Synod of the Church of Eastern Australia
would do well, in the opinion of the present writer, if it refused


to go into these now exasperated personalities. The really vital
question has been smothered in them. What the wretched
embroglio arose out of is an unbelieving haste in rushing men
into the ministry of the Church, and this needs only to be continued
for a short time in order to build up the Free Church from the
face of the earth and leave it in the invisible. If the supreme court
of that Church in New South Wales will admonish both the
principals in this affair of their faults, and take means that no
raw, unfledged men be pushed out henceforward into the ministry
of the Free Church, they will perform a service from which the
Free Churches in the Australian colonies will derive a lasting
advantage, and they themselves will be freed from a present
danger. It may suit a Diotrephes to be the only man of education
in a church, and to get himself surrounded by a circle of ill-
trained, half-informed underlings, who will contemplate his
solitary and superior wisdom at a due distance and with a dumb
deference; but no church will thrive under such a one-man
regime , nor will the Free Church in New South Wales. Church-
extension is nearly, but it is not altogether, the right name for
such mismanagement. A church may be extended till its sub-
stance is beaten out of it ; but church-distension would be more
truly descriptive, and the distension in the case now under review
has brought about the possibility of extensive laceration and
schism.
MR. SUTHERLAND IS DISQUALIFIED TO BE A JUDGE
in this case. If the Synod takes it up, as they will no doubt,
they should in the very first instance put both the rival disputants
to the bar. So much has been said in Mr. Sutherland’s paper to
influence men’s judgment that no court with any respect for its
own impartiality can admit him to adjudicate, even if the case
were not one in which he is a principal to begin with.
It has been said that there is a narrow area within which the
merits of this dispute appear to be unequivocally in the hands of
Mr. M‘Pherson. This remark has reference to the course of
events dating from the rupture between Messrs. Smith, Bates, and
Ashley, on the one side, and Mr. Sutherland on the other. Putting
out of sight the vicious system of procuring and training students,
the treatment of these three aspirants to the Free Church ministry
at the hands of Mr. Sutherland appear to have been such as justly
to require investigation. Mr. M‘Pherson went no farther in the
first instance than to call for such an inquiry. Nothing in his
way of asking for that needed inquiry should have given umbrage
to a healthy mind. The Synod, however, ruled that they would
not entertain the question, and voted the publication in which
Mr. M'Pherson pleaded for it to be uncalled for. The matter


might have ended there; and, so concluded, it would have pre-
sented the aspect of a difference between the writer of the
pamphlet and the majority of the Synod which did not involve
more than a divergency of judgment, and in which the synodical
majority might be in the wrong. But such an open verdict was
not to the mind of Mr. M'Pherson’s opponent, and since the
Synod’s vote —which may have been judicious or the reverse, but
which need not have carried any sting of bitterness—it appears to
have been the employment of Mr. Sutherland to contrive how to
instil the elements of rancour into that comparatively passionless
judgment. That this unworthy treatment has not been borne by
Mr. M'Pherson without resentment is not matter of censure
against him. His resentments have latterly carried him too far,
but he certainly was not called upon to sit still in the first instance,
when “the facts” detailed by him were affirmed to be “fictions.”
Whoever was the author of that keen alliteration, Mr. M'Pherson
was entitled to hear from him the grounds of such a heavy
accusation. He was denied that reasonable satisfaction, and it is
no wonder if his resentment, from being just, became excessive.
In all this there is no evading the conclusion that Mr. Sutherland
has behaved as a high-handed, arbitrary, and despotic dictator.
There are men who make a study of the popish controversy, and
master it, who never learn to master the congenital popery of
their own hearts. Without justifying all that Mr, M‘Pherson has
done, it is impossible not to surmise that it is the truth of the
original publication, and not its want of truth, that renders the
animosity of Mr. M'Pherson’s opponent so rancorous.
But, as has been said, the true interest involved in this unseemly
dispute dates higher than the pamphlet referred to, and goes back
into a question which neither of the disputants holds before his
brethren. The system which allowed such unsuitable men as the
Messrs. Smith, Bates, and Ashley of this affair to be on the list
of Free Church students is now on its trial, or rather lies open to
the unqualified reprobation of all loyal Free Churchmen. The
Free Church in New South Wales will not long survive if such an
unconscientious method of receiving men as candidates for its
ministry is continued. And it will concern the Free Churches in
the other colonies to close their doors against the influx of such
unworthy pretenders to the Free Church name, unless some
thorough reform in this matter be initiated.
