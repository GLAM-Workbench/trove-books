R. L. J. Ellery, Esq., was called to the Chair.
The Conference commenced at 2-30 p.m.
1. The Chairman stated that in accordance with the understanding between the members at the close
of the Conference held at Sydney in November, 1879, that it was desirable to hold a second Conference in
Melbourne, early in 1881, he had addressed the following letter to the Hon. the Chief Secretary of Victoria :
C. 3.

Sir, Observatory, Melbourne, March 17th, 1881.
In November, 1879, the New South Wales Government invited the different colonial meteorologists to meet in
Sydney and hold a Conference with a view of bringing about a more satisfactory intercolonial weather telegram system, and to
decide upon the best means of improving our knowledge of Australian Meteorology generally. This Conference was held,
and among other matters it was decided, if possible, to hold a similar Conference in Melbourne about twelve months later
for a similar purpose. I now find that the gentlemen representing this science in New Zealand, New South Wales, and
South Australia will be able to attend in Melbourne about the middle of April. I have now the honor therefore to enquire
if you approve of such a Conference being held here, and if so whether you will cause an invitation to be sent to the
Governments of New South Wales, South Australia, and New Zealand, asking that their respective astronomers or chief
meteorologists may be authorized to attend such a Conference about the second or third week in April. I w ould also
respectfully suggest that the Governments of Tasmania, Western Australia, and Queensland be invited to send representa-
tives.
I have the honor to be, Sir,
Your most obedient servant,
_ ROB. L. J. ELLERY,
The Honorable the Chief Secretary, Melbourne. Government Astronomer.
The Minister approved of the proposal to hold a Conference, and at once invited the various colonies
to send representatives. Replies from New South Wales, South Australia, and New Zealand agreeing to
do so were received. Telegrams were also received from Queensland and Western Australia to the effect
that those colonies were unable to send representatives. The following message from the Government of
Tasmania was also received :
“To Chief Secretary, Victoria.
“We have no such officer as the one mentioned in your telegram. This Government cannot send delegates to pro-
posed Conference, but concurs generally in objects sought to be obtained, and if Conference is held will communicate their
views to the Chairman by letter or memorandum.
2 / 4 / 81 - WM. MOORE. ”
The only Colonies, therefore, represented at this Conference are New South Wales, South Australia,
New Zealand, and Victoria. The Chairman also stated that the Government had placed the services of a
shorthand-writer at the disposal of the Conference.
It was then resolved that the Government be thanked for their consent to grant the services of a
shorthand-writer.
2. The Chairman reported that the following resolutions were adopted by the Conference held at
Sydney in November, 1879 :
I. That, in view of the great importance which a better knowledge of the movement and origin of
strong gales and storms on our coast lines and neighbouring seas is to the shipping ancf com-
mercial interest generally, it is desirable to secure, as far as possible, co-operation in all the
Austialasian Colonies for the investigation of storms, as well as for agricultural and general
climatological purposes.
11. That, with the view of giving effect to the foregoing resolution, similar observations and the
same form of publication should, as far as possible, be adopted throughout the colonies.
111. That, in order effectively to carry out the objects of the Conference as afl&rmed in the fore-
going resolutions, it is desirable to establish first-class meteorological stations in certain well-
se ected positions in the several Australasian Colonies, including New Zealand, in addition to
those existing.
IV.


IV. That the definition of the work of a first-class station, given in the preface to the New Zea-
land Meteorological Report for 1873, be adopted, viz. :
“ The observations taken are limited to those for determining atmospheric pressure,
maximum and minimum daily temperature of atmosphere, and of insolation and radiation,
the average daily amount of moisture, the rainfall and number of rainy days, the force and
direction of wind, and amount and character of cloud.”
V. That the instruments at each first-class station consist of a mercurial barometer, of either the
standard or Board of Trade form; thermometers of new or approved patterns compared with
standards as frequently as possible; rain-gauges of 8 inches collecting diameter and
wind-gauges of any approved form. The local hours of observation to be 9 a.m., 3 p.m., and
9 p.m. Beaufort’s scale of wind to be adopted. The observations to be recorded in equiva-
lents and pressure.
VI. That it is very desirable to obtain the co-operation of the Government of Tasmania, and to
persuade them to establish a station at the public expense at Hobart Town.
VII. That it is desirable to secure the co-operation of the Governments of Western Australia,
New Zealand, and Tasmania in the system of weather telegrams, which now embraces the
colonies of South Australia, Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland.
VIII. That, in the opinion of this Conference, it is desirable that weather telegrams and forecasts
shall, in all cases, depend upon the observations used for general meteorological and climato-
logical statistics, and be under the direction of the head of the meteorological department in
each colony.
IX. That this Conference, having been informed that the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company
will charge half rates for the transmission of weather reports through the cable connecting
Australia and Tasmania, and probably also the cable to New Zealand, recommend that the
cost of such reports be defrayed by the participating colonies in equal proportions; and that,
in the opinion of this Conference, such cost need not exceed in the aggregate £350 per
annum.
X. That, in the opinion of the Conference, this expenditure is justified by the extreme importance
to the shipping interest of early information of the approach of dangerous easterly and
westerly gales.
XI. That the several Governments be requested to cause precedence to be given to the regular
weather telegrams and special storm reports.
XII. That, in the opinion of this Conference, there should be established in each of the colonies,
upon a high mountain peak, a meteorological observatory for the special study of winds and
other meteorological phenomena; and that the most desirable positions for them would be the
following:—
South Australia Mount Lofty About 2,500 feet above sea-level.
New South Wales ... ... Kiandra ... ... „ 4,600 „ ~
New Zealand ... ... Tauhara Taupo ... „ 4,600 ~ „
Ditto ... ... .•• Mount Herbert ... ~ 4,000 „ „
Tasmania Mount Wellington ... „ 4,000 „ „
Victoria ... ... ••• Mount Macedon ... „ 3,500 „ „
XIII. That the revision of the present telegraph weather code be referred to Messrs. Russell and
Ellery, with a view to its simplification and extension.
XIV. That the interchange of weather statistics, in carrying out the suggestions of this Con-
ference between the different Australasian stations, should be in the form of a diagram ; and
that this should not interfere with the printing of statistics- by the different colonies in any
way they like.
XV (1.) That the monthly graphic records for interchange consist of curves, showing barometer,
velocity and direction of wind, temperature, humidity, rainfall, with remarks upon weather,
especially with reference to storms and atmospheric disturbances, and that specific forms be
prepared and distributed to the co-operating colonies. #
(2.) That the mean humidity curve be derived from the means of maximum and minimum
of wet and dry bulb thermometers.
(3.) The barometer curve to be constructed from barographic records, so as to depict the
turning points. . , . . , „ , ,
(4.) The temperature curve to represent maximum and minimum and mean tor each day.
(5.) The velocity and direction of the wind to be deduced from the anemometer.
XVI. That in the transmission of telegrams the reports be generalized from the local weather
For New- 3 Zealand the following subdivision into districts is recommended for convenience of
reporting : , ~
A ... N.E. aspect ... North Cape to East Cape.
B ... N.W. aspect ... Cape Maria to West Cape (exclusive of Cook Straits).
C ... S. aspect ... West Cape to Moeraki.
D ... S.E. aspect ... Moeraki to East Cape (exclusive of Cook Straits).
E ... Cook Straits ... Comprising Wanganui, Wellington, Cape Campbell, and Cape
Farewell, Nelson.
A code to be framed to express the weather in each of the above aspects in general terms, according
to the judgment of the reporter, thus :
Aspect. Wind and Weather. Rain. Sea.
No remark to indicate absence of phenomena. XVII.


XVII. That the telegrams furnished to Melbourne by Tasmania should conform with those
between the Australian Colonies.
XVIII. (1). That weather telegrams from the Australian Colonies shall comprise :
1. Barometer reduced to 32° and sea-level,
2. Dry bulb,
3. Humidity,
4. Maximum and minimum,
5. Direction and velocity of wind,
6. State of weather,
7. Rainfall,
8. Sea disturbances,
with a synoptical report of the weather generally.
(2). And that within New Zealand the same system should be adopted.
XIX. That the extreme importance of the weather system proposed be strongly urged upon the
Queensland Government with a view to obtain their more active co-operation.
XX. That Australia be divided into six meteorological areas for transmission of reports to New
Zealand, viz., Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria, New South Wales, and Queens-
land ; South Australia being divided into two districts, tropical and extra-tropical.
XXI. That weather telegrams be written on paper of a special colour, so as to be readily distin-
guishable in the offices.
XXII. That the solar radiation thermometers should be blackened bulb thermometers in vacuo,
and should be exposed on an open space at an elevation of 4 feet 6 inches from the surface of
the ground, supported by a post carrying two light arms.
XXIII. That radiation thermometers be placed over grass.
XXIV. That the following subjects for experiment be referred to each member of the Conference
for future consideration and report:—
1. Shade temperature.
2. Swinging thermometer and thermometer sheds in use.
3. Standards to be swung with 2 feet 6 inches string during sunshine and after sunset.
4. Observations to determine the difference in humidity, by self-registering maximum and
minimum thermometers, and by other methods.
5. The best method of measuring the velocity and pressure of wind.
6. Whether any better method than black bulb thermometers can be devised for measuring
the direct effect of the sun.
7. As to the best method of determining spontaneous evaporation.
XXV. That as investigation of the Newcastle tide-gauges has shown that such instruments give
valuable indications of distant earthquakes, gales, and sea-disturbances, it is desirable, in the
opinion of the Conference, that self-registering tide-gauges be established in as many convenient
places as possible on the coast, in connection with the Meteorological Department of the
different Colonies.
XXVI. That the foregoing minutes be adopted as the Report of this Conference on the various
matters referred to it, and that the Chairman be requested to report to the Government of
New South Wales.
Reports.
3. Resolved XXVII. That, as a preliminary proceeding, each member should report the action
taken in the Colony represented by him with regard to the recommendations of the last Conference.
Report by Dr. Hector.
4. Dr. Hector accordingly reported as follows With regard to Resolution 11. : The forms for the
publication of meteorological statistics have been altered so as to meet the views adopted at the last Confer-
ence. The forms now used by first, second, and third-class stations respectively now submitted.
. . . ution HI. • Changes in the department have led to a reduction of the first-class
stations from eighteen to three, which he thought to be quite a sufficient number to afford all the data required
for complete meteorological statistics, especially as it is contemplated to furnish these stations with complete
sets of continuous self-recording apparatus. The number of second-class stations has, however, been largely
increased, and their equipment very much improved.
6. Under Resolution VII. : The New Zealand Government are favourably disposed in regard to the
co-operation requested, and to provide the means suggested by the Conference, but the matter has not yet
been brought before Parliament, the proposition being considered somewhat indefinite.
7. Under Resolution VIII. : Correspondence was read and handed in relative to the changes that had
been made in the relations of the Meteorological and Weather Departments of New Zealand, partly in
accordance with the recommendation of the Conference, and partly on account of certain changes in* the direc-
tion of retrenchment. Since 1874 there has been a Weather Signal Department under the charge of Captain
Jtdwm, quite distinct from the Meteorological Department, which furnished the statistics. The papers
■cv? 1 ,e Hector, and marked “A,” showed that he had recommended the reference to Captain
hidwin of the Report made by the Sydney Conference, for report—(l.) As to how far the suggestions could
e given effect to by his department. (2.) As to preventing duplication of observations by combining the
workot the two departments. And (3.) As to preserving the reports on which the weather signals are
rounded, in order that the conclusions may be reviewed in the future. In Captain Edwin’s reply, he drew
attention to the expense involved in sending the daily synoptical report; to certain phenomena, indicating
tnat, m ms opnnon, the meteoroiogicai connection between Australia and New Zealand is not so close as
rmgnt be reasonably supposed; to the probability that information from Queensland would be more useful
t i iat / rom the other colonies ; t 0 Mount Peel as a site for a mountain station, and to the
doubt whether the results from only one such station would be worth the expense; and to the desirableness
of


of assimilating the system of registration to that used in the United Kingdom ; he stated his preference for
a direct statement (in weather warnings sent to New Zealand) of the position and route of any storm centre
affecting that country, with an example ; he considered that certain suggestions in regard to telegraphic
messages were not neccessary ; that, while high tides are now predicted in New Zealand, additional informa-
tion would improve these warnings, and that tide-gauges would collect valuable data. A ttached to this
paper were notes thereon by Mr. Ellery and Mr. Russell. Mr. Ellery remarked that the cost of telegrams
would be but a trivial sum to each colony, say £9O or £IOO, and would be reduced by the joining of other
colonies ; that the weather telegrams should not be complicated by any deductions regarding a single locality,
though early intimation of any great disturbance, if added to the ordinary telegram from the colony where it
originated, would be very valuable. The suggestions as to telegraphic messages, considered by Captain
Edwin unnecessary, would secure promptitude in telegraph offices. The tide-gauges were not for prediction
purposes, but to furnish knowledge concerning abnormal tides, or disturbances of normal ones. Mr. Russell
expressed in his remarks the same view as Mr. Ellery did concerning the expense of telegrams; observed
that the Conference, having unanimously resolved in favour of cablegrams between Australia and New
Zealand, it was very desirable to test the proposition ; remarked that it was proposed to send information
from Queensland ; and pointed out that the messages proposed by the Conference were merely statements
of existing conditions, unburdened by any theoretical matter which might not be correct, though it might,
if of great importance, be appended as a remark, as it sometimes now is, in the cypher telegrams exchanged
by Australian Colonies.
8. Dr. Hector then handed in certain papers on the subject of amalgamating and reorganizing the
Weather Forecast and Meteorological Departments of New Zealand. The correspondence showed that on
the sth of April, 1880, Dr. Hector addressed to the Honorable the Colonial Secretary a letter pointing out
that a saving might be effected, and drawing attention to the fact that in 1867 and on several occasions since
he had suggested a complete reorganization of the department with a view to a better application of the vote,
though nothing had been done. This letter enclosed extracts —(1.) From a memorandum dated the 12th of
June, 1867 ; and (2.) From a letter to the Honorable the Colonial Secretary, dated the 23rd of September,
1874, both signed by Dr. Hector. In the former it was proposed to establish four principal stations where
the daily periodic elements would be determined by frequent direct observations, and twenty second-class
stations at which daily records should be taken of the indications of self-registering instruments. These
could be maintained for £6OO per annum, and would be quite sufficient for scientific purposes. The new
arrangements were proposed to be brought into operation on the Ist of January, 1868. In the latter Dr.
Hector recommended the reduction of the number of first-class meteorological stations to three, and the
placing of the other stations under the Weather Signal Department. He advised that self-registering
instruments -hould be procured ; that no break in the continuity of the observations should be allowed to
occur ; and that the changes should be deferred to the end of 1875. In reply to the letter dated sth April,
1880, and its enclosures, Captain Edwin sent a memorandum, dated lltli September, 1880, wherein he set
forth the impossibility of maintaining efficient weather forecasts with a reduced expenditure, the necessity
bn .in assistant in that branch of the service, the impossibility that one person could discharge efficiently
tliu duties of both d«i irtments, and several facts which, in his opinion, made the duties of a meteorological
observer incompatible with those of an observer for the Forecast Department. Captain Edwin laid stress
on the difference which he conceived to separate meteorology from weather forecast, remarking that the
former required trained observers, exact registration, and laborious calculation, in order to obtain results
which it was hoped would prove valuable in the future for the prediction of seasons and climatic changes
though they had not yet been found reliable for those purposes even where (as in Great Britain) observations,
had been made carefully for over fifty years ; while the latter, requiring no special training of observers,
demanded of tin forecasting officer skill and despatch, while it gave daily value for the daily expenditure.
9. In order to <explain to the Conference the method on which Captain Edwin conducted the Signal
Department, Dr. Hector laid before the Conference a copy of Captain Edwin’s paper communicated to the
New Zealand Institute on the Principles of Weather Forecast in New Zealand, with a sheet showing the
succession of weather as recorded in that colony, plotted on his principle for a period of six months from
January to June, 1880. He explained that Captain Edwin’s method was in the mam the same as that
adopted by the Meteorological Council of Great Britain, although it involved the acceptance of certain hypo-
theses which are not yet generally received. Since the beginning of the year, the Weather Signal Depart-
ment having been placed under the charge of Dr. Hector, as Meteorological Director, the method of observing,
recording, and reporting has been modified so as to agree with the wishes of the Conference.
10. Thirty-seven reporting stations are now fitted with complete instruments, and supply information
at 9 a.m. of every day as to the wind, pressure, temperature, humidity, and general weather. These tele-
orams are grouped according to the aspects decided on by the Conference, viz. : (A) north-east; (B) north-
west • (C) southern ; (D) south-eastern ; and (E) Cook’s Straits. From the data thus obtained and nom
telegrams when found necessary, an isobaric map is constructed each day, and a general report for each of
the above aspects is prepared, below which the forecast for each aspect is written m such a way as, it correct,
would agree with the report for the following day, and warnings are issued when necessary to any part ot
the coast where dangerous winds are apprehended. The data thus obtained will be used as secon c ass
station returns for statistical purposes. . , , ,
11. Dr. Hector submitted these isobaric maps and the data upon which they were founded tor the
months of February and March, during which the new system was in operation, and stated as the result ot
his experience that it afforded the most satisfactory method of tracing and recording the changes ot weather,
and distinguishing the characteristics of a season.
12. The correspondence had resulted in arrangements for the future, whereby one or all ot the three
first-class stations should be gradually so improved as to approximate in their equipment to that ot the
central or observatory stations in Australia, while, in addition to the thirty-seven second-c ass Nations a
large number of third-class or rainfall stations are being established. These last will be kept by li s htho
keepers (where not in telegraphic communication), by pilots, by harbourmasters and by other Governm
officers, and by amateurs. At these stations temperature, rain, wind, and weather observations are made
13. Valuable meteorological observations are received from Fiji, and were published in Dr. Hecto
last report for the years 1877, 1878, and 1879. An additional firsbclass station has been established at the
Chatham Islands, and has been in operation since January, 1879. The results for that year


published in the report just mentioned, a copy thereof was laid upon the table, and attention was drawn to
the fact that it contained daily readings for the three stations at Auckland, Wellington, and Dunedin for
pressure, wind, and rainfall for a period of three years, accompanied by curves which showed a very re-
markable agreement of the atmospheric disturbances throughout that range of latitude, which is equal to a
distance of 800 miles. Dr. Hector also submitted the daily observations for 1880, made at the Wellington
Station, and the monthly abstracts from all stations for the same year.
14. Under Resolution IX. : It was reported that the Government of Hew Zealand had agreed to
bear, for the present, the cost of any necessary cablegrams, but desired before bringing the matter before
Parliament, that the Conference should express more clearly what they consider to be the particular value
of those cablegrams, and what their probable cost, and what arrangements in regard to payment are sug-
gested to give effect to the recommendation. .
15. Under Resolution XI. : All weather warnings and the reports from stations are forwarded with
the greatest celerity, and no difficulty is experienced in New Zealand from delay of weather telegrams, a
result largely due to the interest which the Superintendent of Telegraphs, Dr. Lemon, takes in the subject.
16. Under Resolution XII. : No steps have been taken to get a high-level station ; the establish-
ment is not at present able to cope with this work, and it is doubtful whether, for some time to come, a vote
can be got to make it so. Observations are, however, taken at Taupo, at an altitude of 1,200 feet, in the
centre of the North Island, and Bealey (2,140 feet), in the centre of the South Island.
17. Under Resolution XIII. : The present agreement with Mr. Russell is, that cablegrams shall be
sent only for any remarkable phases of weather in New Zealand, and that they shall indicate excessive
pressure or abnormal differences in pressure within the New Zealand area.
18. Under Resolution XIY. : A form of diagram was submitted, in which the meterological statistics
have for some years been displayed at the Wellington Station, and in which they are to be communicated to
Sydney, from the beginning of the present year, from Auckland, Wellington, and Dunedin.
19. Under Resolution XYI. : The classification and grouping of the weather reports has been strictly
adapted to this recommendation, but, in practice, the arrangement is not found to be the most convenient, so
that the definition of the aspects may probably be revised with advantage.
20. Under Resolution XVIII. : The requirements of this resolution have been met, with respect to
New Zealand, and a synoptical report of the weather generally for the colony is published in the evening
papers each day.
21. Under Resolution XXY. : Several tide-gauges have been procured, but at present they are
utilized for the local requirements of harbour boards, and are not yet available for general investigations such
as are contemplated by the Conference.
22. It was arranged that data should be obtained from Sydney, Adelaide, New Zealand, and Mel-
bourne, for the months of January, February, and March, with a view of testing the applicability to
Australia of the system of weather forecasts adopted in the northern hemisphere.
The Conference adjourned to to-morrow at 10 o'clock a.m.

Mr. Todd.
The Conference met at the Observatory at 10 o’clock a.m.

Report by Mr. Russell.
25. Mr. Russell reported, in accordance with Resolution XXVII., as follows :—Under Resolution
11. : Had extended the range of the weather map by taking in new stations established in agreement with
report; had published daily a barometer curve including all the coast stations, as this was a method which
appeared to convey to the public better than could be done by figures the passage of barometric depressions.
He desired to call the attention of the members of the Conference to the fact that this curve pointed to the
insufficiency of the present telegrams because they did not give turning points of the barometer; hence
some depressions appeared to pass from Eucla in two days, and others in one day. This, no doubt, was
owing to the fact that the 9 a.m. observations were taken to represent the turning points. He submitted
copies of the weather map printed daily at Sydney and distributed gratis.
26. Under Resolution 111. : Additional stations (first-class) have been established at Kiandra,
Menindie, Hay, and Wollongong, making altogether twenty-nine in New South Wales, see list in Appendix
No. 1 ; besides these reports were received from 9 first-class private stations, from 72 thermometer and rain
stations, and from 100 rain stations, making the total 210 stations.
27. Under Resolution VII. : Had been unable to secure active co-operation from the Government of
Queensland in the weather system.
28. Under Resolution VIII. : Had continued to make the same observations serve for weather
signal purposes and statistics.
29. Under Resolution IX. : Submitted a letter from the Superintendent of the New Zealand Cable
showing the liberal rates at which the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company ? are prepared to transmit
weather


weather telegrams. He was authorized to say that the Government of Hew South Wales would share the
cost of the proposed weather cablegrams to the extent of £75 per annum, which was probably more than
would be required.
30. Under Resolution XII. : A mountain station has been established on Kiandra, 4,600 feet above
sea.
31. Under Resolution XVIII. : Had regularly sent, but had not received synoptical reports.
32. Under Resolutions XXII. and XXIII. : These resolutions had been conformed to.
33. Mr. Ellery, referring to the letter read by Mr. Russell (cf. par. 29), remarked that in 1877 he
received a letter from the Superintendent of the Tasmanian cable stating that cable messages from Tasmania
would be transmitted at half the ordinary rate, inclusive of the address and signature. & In 1880 he had
asked that this concession might be extended, and had received a reply to the effect that if more than one
message was required each way daily an endeavour would be made to induce the directors to extend the
concession to a second message.
Report by Mr. Todd.
34. Mr. Todd, in accordance with Resolution XXVII., reported as follows Under Resolution I. :
That he would hereafter lay before the Conference the form of weather bulletin posted at the Adelaide Tele-
graph Office, at the Exchange, and at Port Adelaide.
35. Under Resolution 11. : That nothing had been done, since the Sydney Conference had not
arrived at any decision as to the form to be adopted, leaving it open to each director to publish the results
of his own observations for his own purposes in his own way. A copy of the observations for January, 1879,
was put in, to show the form in which the observations for South Australia had been published ; also a copy
of the weather map taking in the whole of Australia and Hew Zealand upon which it is proposed to lay
down isobars.
36. Under Resolution 111. : That as the outcome of the last Conference, a vote has been obtained
from Parliament for providing the Observatory at Adelaide with self-recording instruments, namely,
a barograph, thermograph, anemometer, and ombrograph. Had deferred ordering the anemometer, knowing
that Mr. Ellery was making one on an improved principle ; and it was probable that a similar instrument
would be adopted at the Adelaide Observatory.
37. Under Resolution IV. : That the following are the first-class stations (as defined at the Sydney
Conference) in South Australia : —Adelaide, Cape Horthumberland, Cape Borda, Alice Springs, Port
Darwin, Eucla, Mount Gambia, Robe, Strathalbyn, and Kapunda. Barometer stations have been estab-
lished at Streaky Bay, Port Augusta, and Daly "Waters. There are thermometer stations at Goolwa, Mount
Barker, and Clare. At Cape Horthumberland, Cape Borda, Alice Springs, and Port Darwin, observations
are taken every three hours, day and night. At the other stations observations are taken generally at 9
a.m., 3 p.m., and 9 p.m.; but at some of them at 9 a.m., 12, 3 p.m., 6 p.m., and 9 p.m. It is intended to
establish additional barometrical stations, and to make them first-class stations. The proposed first-class
stations are Streaky Bay, Port Augusta, Farina, and The Peak. In addition to the stations named, there
are nearly 200 rainfall stations throughout South Australia.
38. Under Resolution V. : That barometers of Fortin’s construction are used, not the Board of
Trade form.
39. Under Resolution VII. : That it had been left to him to secure the co-operation of Western
Australia, which he had accomplished by the kind courtesy of the Honorable Mr. Fraser, Surveyor General.
That recently observations had been made at 7*30 a.m., in order that the report might reach the eastern
colonies early enough to be included in their daily reports.
40. Under Resolution IX. : That he was able to say that the South Australian Government would
bear its share of the expense of the cable weather telegrams.
41. Under Resolution XI. : That in the South Australian Telegraph Department precedence is
given to all weather telegrams before everything else, but that the same rule did not appear to apply to the
other Australian colonies.
42. Under Resolution XII. : That no action had been taken, but desired to mention, en passant,
that Alice Springs station is at an elevation of 2,100 feet above sea-level.
43. Under Resolution XVIII. : That the daily weather telegrams are not precisely consistent with
the resolution, the Sydney Observatory, for instance, sending the humidity, whilst from Melbourne
were sent the readings of the wet and dry bulb thermometers. The synoptic reports are not regularly
received.
44. Under Resolution XX. : That South Australia has been divided in the tropical and extra-
tropical districts, the stations in the tropics being Port Darwin, Daly Waters, Powell’s Creek, Tennent’s
Creek, and Alice Springs.
45. Under Resolutions XXII. and XXIII. : That the resolutions are strictly carried out.
46. Under Resolution XXIV. : That experiments with swinging thermometers had been carried out,
the results of which would be presented to this Conference at a future meeting.
47. Under Resolution XXV. : That he had not yet succeeded in getting records of self-register-
ing tide-gauges.
48. That the meteorological statistics had always been in his hands.
Report by Mr. Ellery.
49. Mr. Ellery, in accordance with Resolution XXVII., reported as follows : —Under Resolution
11. : That he had not changed the mode of publication for the reason that nothing had been definitely
decided on by the Sydney Conference.
50. Under Resolution 111. : That there are now in Victoria the following first-class stations, viz.,
Melbourne, Portland, Cape Otway, Wilson’s Promontory, Gabo Island, Sandhurst, Ballarat, and Echuca.
That Mount Macedon and Omeo are about being made first-class stations. Echuca is the only first-class
station established since the last Conference, any extension of the system during that time, besides the
alterations mentioned, being confined to third-class stations.
51. Under Resolution VII. : That soon after the last Conference he had requested the Victorian
Government to place him in communication with the Tasmanian Government in order to secure their
co-operation


co-operation in the scheme. Through some misunderstanding the application was not made to Tasmania, but
he had subsequently taken the best steps open to him to induce the Tasmanian authorities to join in the
Australian scheme. The Government had been again directly invited to send a delegate to the Conference,
but in the telegram produced they stated that they could not send one, although they concurred in the
objects sought to be attained by the Conference, and promised to communicate with the Chairman by letter
or memorandum. The Honorable the Chief Secretary of Victoria had been requested to convey to them
the information that the Conference would commence its sittings on the 21st instant, and would be very
glad to hear from them. He had no doubt that the co-operation of Tasmania would in a very short time
be secured.
52. Under Resolutions IX. and X. : That the Victorian Government had consented to exchange
weather telegrams, and had placed upon the Estimates for the current year a sum of £9O to meet Victoria’s
share of the cost. They had been prepared ever since last June to bear this expense.
53. Under Resolution XI. : That, after the last Conference, a copy of the report was sent
to the Government, attention being drawn to this paragraph, with a request that precedence and
prompitude be accorded to weather telegrams. A perceptible improvement had taken place since then, but
he was still of opinion that further improvement in promptitude might be made if the Conference pressed
the matter.
54. Under Resolution XII. : That last week a large obelisk station had been completed upon the
extreme south-west point of Mount Macedon, at an altitude of 3,500 feet, for the erection of a self-register-
ing anemograph, which would be in charge of an observer who, about 100 feet lower, has a barometer,
thermometers, and all the appliances of a first-class station. This would be worked as a first-class station in
about a month, with a continuous registration of the direction of the wind. The form of anemometer to be
used will be a direction-vane with pressure-plate.
55. Under Resolution XIII. : That Mr. Russell, subsequent to the last Conference, communicated
to Mr. Ellery some proposed improvements in or additions to the code, but the matter had not yet been
discussed.
56. Under Resolution XIV. and XV. : That nothing had been done in Victoria.
57. Under Resolution XVIII.: That the recommendation as to weather telegrams was carried out
in the telegrams from this station to the other colonies, except that the readings of dry and wet bulbs were
sent instead of the dry bulb and humidity. No synoptical report is sent from this station to other colonies,
and none is received. A long time ago two or three came, and then they ceased.
58. Under Resolution XXI. : That nothing has been done in this colony in regard to the use of a
coloured paper for weather telegrams.
59. Under Resolution XXII. : That the recommendation has been carried out.
60. Under Resolution XXIV. : That he will hereafter report on Nos. 1,2, 3,5, and 6.
61. Under Resolution XXV. : That enquiries had been made as to the best spot in which to place a
tide-gauge on the south coast of Australia. That Gabo Island had been recommended as the best position
on the south-east coast, and Portland as another site. It was desired to have Wilson’s Promontory made a
station, but there was no place for it. He hoped to get one or two of these tide-gauges erected in the course
of the next eight or nine months.
Definition of First-class Station.
62. Resolved, on the motion of Mr. Russell, XXX. : That, instead of the definition in Resolution
IV., the Congress adopt the definition of the stations given at the Vienna Congress, and contained in the
introduction to the Instructions for the use of Meteorological Instruments.
The Conference adjourned to Monday next , the 25th April , at 10 o'clock a.m.
ROB. L. J. ELLERY.
25/4/81.
MONDAY, 25th APRIL, 1881.
Present :
Mr. Ellery, in the Chair.
Dr. Hector, | Mr. Russell,
Mr. Todd.
The Conference met at the Observatory at 10 o’clock a.m.
The minutes of the meetings held on Thursday and Friday last were read and confirmed.
65. Mr. Todd laid before the Conference the following suggestions to be discussed hereafter, viz. :
(a.) That, with a view to the observations being referred to one uniform standard, a complete set
of standard instruments be purchased for circulation between the four chief stations, viz.,
Melbourne, Sydney, Wellington, and Adelaide—the cost to be divided between the four
colonies represented at this Conference. The instruments to comprise barometer, thermometer
max solar thermometer, anemometer, and rain-gauge.
( 6 ‘) A ll readings of the several instruments to be reduced to the readings of the standards.
(c.) That although absolute uniformity in the form of publication of meteorological statistics is not
considered essential, whatever form is adopted should give
a. Barometer reduced to 32° and sea-level, at least at one of the hours agreed upon at the
last Conference (9 a.m., 3 p.m., 9 p.m.), and the principal turning points, also reduced,
with the times or their occurrence.
* c 38—B p


(3. The temp, of the air at the same hour or hours, also max. and min. The max. should
be read at 9 p.m., and the min. at 9 a.m.
y. Wet bulb ther. readings at the same hour or hours, or humidity.
8. Amount and character of cloud, and upper current of cirri, or high cloud,
e. Direction and force of wind.
£. Rain during previous twenty-four hours, recorded at 9 a.m. It would be better to
read the gauge at 9 a.m. and 9 p.m., and distinguish between night and day rain.
(d.) The chief stations at Melbourne, Sydney, Wellington, and Adelaide, in addition to the fore-
going, should give max. solar ther. ; min. on grass and wool; hours of sunshine; ozone, 9
a.m. and 9 p.m. ; evaporation, read off at 9 a.m. and 9 p.m.
(e.) In addition to this, Melbourne, Sydney, Wellington, and Adelaide should publish hourly
readings of barograph (reduced to 32° and sea-level), thermograph, and anemograph.
(y]) Carrying out Resolution XIA., passed at the previous Conference, that curve sheets, with
synoptic reports on weather, should be exchanged monthly ; it is recommended that these
curves should show barometrical pressure at sea-level, temp, of air, relative humidity, dir. and
force of velocity of wind and rainfall ; and that the synopsis should be in sufficient detail to
trace storms and other atmospheric disturbances. There should be a sufficient number of
stations selected in each colony to supply data for forming isobaric maps for every day.
(<7.) The adopted mean temp, to be deduced from the min., 9 a.m., max., and 9 p.m. readings; and
at the four principal stations this mean should be compared with the hourly means.
(h.) Exposure of thermometer to be uniform, or, if that cannot be effected, the four principal
stations, or one of them, should mount thermometers on each plan adopted by the other
colonies, and compare the readings on each kind of stand with the readings of a rotatory
thermometer in the shade. ,
(i.) The dry and wet bulb thermograph readings should be compared with the readings ot the
standard or ordinary dry and wet bulb thermometers at 9 a.m., 3 p.m., and 9 p.m. ; and the
readings of the thermograph should be referred to those of the ordinary dry and wet, or the
correction supplied. , ,
(k.) The readings of the barograph should also be compared with the readings ot the standard
barometer at the same hours, and the differences given if not applied.
(1) Rain-gauges to be of one uniform pattern and size of receiving surface, viz., 8 m diameter, and
the mouth of receiver to be 1 foot above the surface of the ground, in such a position as
to be wholly unsheltered in all directions. . ,
(m.) Atmometer.—The form adopted at Adelaide is recommended. This consists of an outer tank
of brick cemented, 4 feet square, internal measurement; and an inner tank of slate or marble,
3 feet square ; both tanks being filled with water to the same level. The amount of evapora-
tion is read off by means of a float carrying a graduated rod and vernier, divided 001 inch.
(n.) Observations to be taken at Melbourne, Sydney, Wellington, and Adelaide, at 0 h 43 m., Gr;
m. t., or 7 h. 35 m., Washington, in compliance with the request of the late Brigadier-General
A. J. Myer, Chief Signal Officer, U.S.
Reports on Resolution XXIV.
66. Dr. Hector reported that he had experiments in progress upon the velocity and pressure of the
wind, and upon solar thermometers, but they were not sufficiently advanced to be reported upon. Experi-
ments had also been made with the swinging thermometer. . , , , numbers but

that they were not sufficiently advanced to be reported. He found that fhe swmgmg e rmome ers

wich which had been in use for so many years. For shade temperature, he had for a number of
vears adopted two modes of mounting thermometers. In one case the instruments were mounted on
modified form of Greenwich stand, which was always kept turned with its back

was a shed with an open louvre roof, which will effectually screen the stand (winch should

68. Mr. Russell reported that he had made experiments with the Greenwich stand that had to be
turned twice a day. With another, in which the exterior was composed of louvres, and the interior a box
in which perfectly free and carefully arranged ventilation was provided for, at the same time that no radiation
from the ground could affect the thermometers, and found that if the south side of the box was removed it
crave a temperature the same as the shed; but, if the south side or door was shut, the temperature was
thereby raised two degrees. Had found that thermometers placed on the south side of a wall with a box to
protect them from morning and evening sun, gave same mean temperature as shed.
69. That he had made a series of comparisons between a swung thermometer and a thermometer in
the shed with the following results: —

Swung in sun sometimes as much as 3*7 higher than swung in shade.
70. That to determine the difference of humidity as obtained from max. and min. thermometers, and
from the three daily observations of wet and dry bulb thermometers, he had made the following comparisons
of observations taken in July, 1880, and January, 1881, the result showing a difference of 4*l° in July and 2*6°
in January between the two methods.

Evaporation.
71. Having for the past ten years carried on observations with three forms of evaporators, he thought
the condensed results might be of interest to the members of the Conference. He mentioned that observa-
tions with the glass evaporator were begun at Sydney Observatory in 1860, but it was not until 1871 that
the other two forms were placed beside it for the purpose of comparison. It was simply because the glass
instrument was the one in use, that it was assumed to be the standard for comparison, and not for any
advantage in form or substance which it might be supposed to possess. The tin one had been adopted for
use in the country, because its cost was little, and the large one was started because it seemed to put the
water into the condition which obtains in an ordinary open reservoir. The following details will form a
sufficient description of these instruments :
Ho. I.—A glass vessel, standing on the ground, 8 in. high and 8 in. in diameter, in which the
water is usually about 6 in. deep; it is read by a vernier scale attached to a point which is
every morning made to touch the water by screw motion.
No. 2.—A tin vessel, painted white, standing on the ground, 12 in. high and 8 in. in diameter, in
which the water is usually about 8 in. deep ; the amount of evaporation is ascertained by
weighing it every morning. No. 3.


No. 3. —Is a galvanized iron vessel, sunk into the ground 2 ft. 4 in. ; it is 2 ft. 6 in. deep, and
4 ft. in diameter. In it is a small float, to the top of which is attached a light vertical rod
passing through two guides • this is graduated to tenths of an inch, and read to i.wo of an
inch by means of a microscope fixed on a firm support; the edge of the vessel is only 2 in.
above the ground, to prevent surface water from running into it; and the grass is allowed to
grow level with the top, to prevent rain splashing in, and sun-heat on the metal outside.
72. The table herewith shows the result from each evaporator, together with temperature, humidity,
wind, and rainfall, for ten years, 1871 to 1880. It will be observed that the tin one shows the greatest
amount, the glass second, and the large one least, on the average for ten years; but it is worth noting that
in 1876, when the velocity of wind greatly exceeded other years, the tin one gave the evaporation only 7 per
cent, above the average, the large one 20, and the glass 28 per cent.
Observations on the temperature of the water in the evaporators show that the glass one is most
affected by the sun, the tin next, and the large one least.
73. In the course of the experiments the question arose whether more or less evaporation took place
during the day as compared with the night. The day was divided at 9 a.m. and 9 p.m., and the observa-
tions confined to the glass and large evaporators ; and it was found that the glass one gave 42 per cent,
more during the day than during the night, and the large one 18 per cent, more during day than night, and
it sometimes happened that it was more during the night than during the day. The result of these observa-
tions may be expressed in another way : Comparing the two, the large one gave 13 per cent, less than the
glass one during the day, and 23 per cent, more during the night, which seems to prove that the heat
absorbed by the large one during the day was given off in vapour during the night, and not by radiation
from the sides, as in the glass one.

75. Another question presented itself, and was answered by several months’ observation. It was —
What ratio does evaporation in the shade bear to that in the sun ? The shade chosen was the thermometer-
shed, where the air has free access, but there is complete protection from the sun. The mean result of the
measures was that 26 per cent, less evaporation took place in the shed than in the glass evaporator in the
sun ; or, comparing it with the large one, the result in shade was 9 per cent, more than in the large one ;
but, as the shade evaporator was placed 3 feet above the ground, where the air would probably be drier than
on the surface of the ground, where it affects the large evaporator, it is probable that a small evaporator in
the shade would give about the same result as one 4 feet over and sunk into the ground.
7G. It will appear from what has been said that every change of condition under which evaporation
is measured produces a change in the result, and since the conditions are infinitely variable, so the lesults
must be. Therefore, before" any comparable results can be obtained, we must determine what it is that we
want to measure. Is it the evaporation from water in the ground, from water in a glass or metal vessel on
the ground, or from water at some distance above the ground ! For the mere purpose of comparison, any
one of these positions would do, but since the one in the ground comes nearest to the condition of a
natural reservoir, I prefer it, because the results would be directly useful for a practical purpose, as well as
for science.
Shade Temperature and Thermometer Sheds.
77. Mr. Ellery reported as follows : —Experiments with regard to true shade temperature, and best
form of thermometer shed, were made here early in 1880. The thermometer stands previously in use at the
Melbourne Observatory were—a Lawson’s stand, and, for a short time, a modified Stevenson s stand.
Prior to 1865, a form of Lawson stand, movable about a central column, so as to place its back to the sun
three times a day, was exclusively used, but this was done away with in favour of an ordinary fixed stand,
of the same form, in 1865.
78. Occasional experiments with a swing thermometer had shown that, on hot days, in which a rapid
change of temperature had occurred in the afternoon, the thermometers always indicated a higher tempera-
ture than that indicated by a thermometer swung in the air, and vice versa after a cold night, showing that
the stand itself retained a temperature different to that of the air a considerable time after an actual tall or
rise of shade temperature ; and further experiments showed that, in the ordinary small stands used
for thermometer exposure, the temperature of the material or the stand itself always lagged behind that
of the air.
* Corrected for two months, January and February, when observations were not taken. Large evaporators started
in March.


79. In a Stevenson’s stand, made for one of the country stations (with vertical instead of horizontal
louvres), the indications were half-way between the Lawson stand thermometers and the swing thermometer.
It was evident, therefore, that if we assume a correct thermometer swung in the open air will give true
shade temperature, thermometers shaded in the ordinary wooden stands (Lawson’s or Stevenson’s) do not
always do so ; and also that the mass of material in the stand, want of free traverse of the air through all
its parts, its slow conductivity, and its proximity to the thermometers themselves were probably the chief
causes. It therefore appeared that the required shelter should be formed of some better and more rapid
conductor than wood, that the mass of material used should be as small as possible, and that the circulation
of air around every part of this mass should be as free as possible ; also that the thermometers themselves
should be as far as convenient from at least the more massive or worst conducting portions of the stand, and
thus free from the retarding effects of radiation.
80. Acting upon this, trials were made with shades constructed of zinc and galvanized iron, and it
was soon found that under such shades the thermometers followed the swing thermometer very closely, and
when a sufficient and thoroughly open air space was allowed between the sheets of a double screen of this
material, and when no side screens were interposed, the swing and fixed thermometers always read alike
even when the temperature of the air was over 100°, and the sun temperature 150°. Trials were made by
day and at night, in both cloudy and clear weather, and the indications were always within a fraction of a
degree of that of the swing thermometer, while thermometers in the other stands differed from it frequently
two or three degrees, and in some cases four or five degrees.
81. After these experiments were completed, a new shed was erected at the Observatory in March,
1880, which has been used ever since for shading the thermometers, and has given every satisfaction ; and
whenever an occasional trial with the swing thermometer has been made, the thermometers fixed in it have
always agreed very closely indeed. Sometimes, after a very cold night, they have shown a slightly higher
temperature (sometimes fully half a degree) than the swing thermometer, which is perhaps due to the
ground beneath the shelter being less cooled by radiation during the night. The shed itself consists of
six uprights of wood fixed in the ground, carrying a double roof of galvanized iron, with low gables north
and south, and eaves east and west. The area covered is 12 feet by 12 feet; height of ridge above ground,
8 feet; height of eaves, 6 feet; space between two roofs, 9 inches. On the north gable a light trellis
extends from the apex of the gable to within 4 feet 6 inches of the ground. The three other sides are fully
open, except three louvre boards just below the eaves on the east and west sides, to keep the direct rays of
the rising or setting sun from reaching the thermometers. The 9-inch space between the two roofs is also
open all round. The thermometers themselves are exposed in a cage of open wire netting hung from the
roof, and about 1 foot below the iron of the inner roof, and, while fully exposed to the air in all directions,
are out of the reach of driving rain. A photograph appended shows the form.
82. The ombrograph is placed beneath this shed, with the collector on the roof.
83. The swing thermometer is a very good one, in glass tube, by Greiner, of Berlin. It is attached
to a silk cord, about 2 feet 6 inches long, with loop to pass over finger. It is usually swung at full length
eight or ten revolutions at a moderate speed, then stopped and immediately read, while the fixed thermo-
meter is read by another observer.
The best method of measuring the velocity and pressure of the wind.
84. I have made numerous experiments in these directions since the first meeting of the Conference,
but lam certainly not prepared to give any opinion yet as to the best method. According to my expe-
rience, the mean velocity for short periods, as furnished by the Robinson’s anemograph does not answer all
the questions that arise, and a good method of measuring the pressure of gusts is wanted. There is no
doubt that the Robinson, if kept in good order, is the most satisfactory of all forms now generally in use ;
but, in the Kew pattern used here, the register scale is too small and close—unnecessarily so, I think so
that it is almost impossible to obtain the maximum velocities in high winds, which generally take place in
very short periods.
85. It was necessary, some months ago, to thoroughly repair, indeed to remake, our anemograph, as
nearly twenty years’ wear had made it very shaky in all its parts. I therefore took the opportunity of intro-
ducing some modifications, especially in the registering portion of the apparatus, and in replacing the
original anti-friction ball bearings by the oil cup and Smeaton ring , as now used at Kew, with the effect of
securing a beautifully silent and smooth motion, combined with equal sensitiveness.
86. The registering apparatus is quite different from the old form and the record sheet much larger,
being 12 inches wide and 18J inches long. The direction record for a full revolution of the wind covers
4J inches wide, and the velocity 5 inches for 50 miles’ motion. An hour’s movement of the record proper
equals about fof an inch. The velocity pen—a glass one, charged with aniline ink falls back to zero
every houi by means of a clutch on the velocity shaft, which is released by an electro-magnet every hour,
the contact for which is made by the clock. Should the velocity exceed 50 miles an hour, the pen moves a
lever at the end of its range and makes contact, allowing the pen to fall back to zero at the completion of
the 50 miles. This acts exceeding well, and the pen commences its new curve the instant it has fallen back
to zero.
8' • I n order to facilitate measurements for short intervals during strong winds, there is a second
electro-magnet which gives the pen an upward movement when in action, forming a short off-set on the
velocity curve. By inserting a plug the clock actuates this electro-magnet every minute; the velocity
curve is thus divided by cross marks every minute, and an easy way of obtaining the velocity for short
intervals is thus supplied.
88. The direction record is given by spring pencils on a pair of endless chains running over two
rollers, a cam plate throwing the pencils, not in position for registering, out of action. The more open scale
ot the record sheet, and return of the velocity pencil to zero every hour, enables the sheets to be much
more easily read off, furnishes more precise results, and the minute marks on the curve made when the
second electro-magnet is connected promises to be a very useful addition for occasional requirements.
f -a -V? StlU SeemS to be SOme 9 uestion a s to the exact ratio of the rotation of the cups to the velocity
ot the wind m Robinson’s anemometer, as it is stated that this varies with the length of the arms and size of
tlie cups. It appears to me, therefore, very desirable to adopt some method by which the results of the several
anemometers in Australia shall be comparable. With this in view I have lately made some experiments
with


with Hagemann’s vacuum anemometer, described in the Journal of the Meteorological Society for October,
1879, because it appears probable that exactly similar conditions can be easily secured at each observatory
for such an instrument, which, moreover, has the advantage of being simple and cheap in construction.
The conditions necessary are, that the height above buildings or trees, or like disturbing causes, and the size
and shape of the orifice of the top of the vertical tube, shall be similar in each case; and perhaps it may be
also desirable to have the capacity of the floating air chamber nearly similar.
90. I have had placed on the observatory a light mast carrying a J-inch gas-pipe, about 25 feet above
the main roof, terminating in a nozzle similar to that described by Hagemann, having an aperture of about 3
or 4 millimeters diameter." The pipe leads to a “ gasometer ” arrangement in a chamber below, where a dial
and index shows the amount of exhaustion in the floating chamber of the gasometer, or in other words the
velocity of the wind, according to the law referred to in Hagemann’s paper.
91. This apparatus has now been at work some weeks, and has furnished very satisfactory results ; the
movements of the index are steady, making gentle sweeps around the dial with the lighter winds, and bold
and rapid ones in the strong gusts of a high wind. The steadiness of its action will render making it self-
registering an easy task.
From observations made with a dial roughly graduated to millimeters water pressure and miles per
hour, its indications appear to agree very closely with the Robinson anemograph, but of course all the rapid
variations of velocity lost in the" Robinson are plainly observable in this apparatus. I am so well satisfied
with this form of anemometer that I have had constructed a more perfect dial and index movement and
carefully made spring than at first used, and propose to make it self-registering by means of a lever marking
on a drum covered with smoked paper.*
Shade Temperatwre.
92. In regard to the experiments on shade temperature, Mr. Ellery mentioned that during the
erection of the shed, experiments were made with side screens, which made a very great difference m the
readings, the thermometer, as soon as the current of air was stopped, showing an elevation of temperature
to the extent of 4° or s°.
Swinging Thermometers.
93. Dr. Hector enquired whether in swinging thermometers the shape of the bulb had been observed
to modify* the results. Mr. Ellery replied that he had found that the shoulder bulbs always registered too
low when swung, although, when placed upon the stand, they read correctly.
94. Dr. Hector remarked that this coincided with his experience, and had led lnm to discard the
shoulder bulb, for the form in which the bulb was of the same diameter with the stem.
Evaporation.
95. Mr. Ellerv stated that he had for many years adopted only one system of measuring spontaneous
evaporation, namely, "that of a tank level with the surface of the ground. The height of the surface m this
tank was measured every morning at 9 a.m.
Black Bulb Thermometers.
96. Some years ago he made experiments upon black bulb thermometers, the results of which were
riven i n a paper read before the Royal Society of Victoria, and showed that while the thermometers
registered correctly up to about 125 or 130°, at temperatures over 125°, even with the best instruments
variations appeared amounting sometimes to 16°. The experiments were made m a room by means of
dark radiation from a heated copper surface, within about 3 feet of which the thermometers were placed.
■l7 Dr Hector enquired whether, after such an experiment, the thermometer returned to its normal
registration. Mr. Ellery replied in the affirmative : the instruments acted quite correctly when P lacec L!“
hot water ■ the variations appeared to result from variations in the diathermancy of the glass. His
opinion wals, that not the slightest confidence was to be placed in black bulb thermometers at temperatures
over about thathehad found that after 130” had been reached these thermometers radiated
beat from* the back at a very different rate from that at lower temperatures. He considered that the back
should always bo in contact'with a substance of the same nature and the same colour. When the back wa
covered with a white cambric handkerchief, he obtained higher readings te when any- other ' ™
used, while contact with black substances, such as black wool, gave quite different results 1 e hlgs «S

Anemometer.
103 Mr Russell suggested that, pending the solution of the best method of determining thcvelocity

stations. He had ordered twelve of these instruments from London, at a cost of 15s. each. He explained the
mode of using the anemometer, which was to be held in the hand, and gave the velocity and pressure of
the wind for 2 minutes at each experiment.
Discussion ensued.
104. Moved, —That the Conference recommend that, pending their final decision as to the method of
ascertaining the velocity of the wind, observers at second-class stations should use Mr. Russell’s hand form
of Robinson’s anemometer.
The decision on this motion was deferred.
Cable arrangements and financial matters connected therewith.
105. Moved by Dr. Hector, seconded by Mr. Todd, and resolved : —XXXII. That all accounts for
weather cablegrams be rendered to Mr. Russell and be paid by him.
Synoptical Telegrams.
106. The consideration of this subject was deferred, to be resumed in connection with the subject of
isobaric analysis to be brought forward by Dr. Hector.
Time at which Observations are to be made in the various Colonies.
107. Mr. Todd, in introducing the subject, said that he considered it desirable to take the observations
at the same hour by local time, but that in order to get out the results in time to be of service to the
general public, especially to persons interested in shipping, they should be taken earlier than at present—
say at 8 o’clock a.m. If this were done, South Australia would receive Sydney and Melbourne observations
at 9 a.m., and the eastern Colonies would receive South Australian observations about 9’30.
108. Mr. Russell considered that no alteration in the present system was practicable.
109. Dr. Hector said that evening observations were far preferable for weather prediction purposes
to observations taken at 9 a.m.
110. Mr. Russell suggested that if 9 a.m. observations were transmitted with the 9 p.m. observations
of the previous evening, predictions could fairly be made for the one day.
111. Mr. Todd moved, and it was resolved : —XXXIII. That no alteration be made at present in the
time at which observations are to be made. A standing foot-note to be made that the observations taken in
Western Australia are made at 7*30 a.m. local time.
Form of Telegrams from Tasmania.
112. Resolved XXXIY. That weather telegrams from Tasmania shall be similar to those received
from Cape Otway, Portland, &c., and shall be transmitted in this form to Adelaide and Sydney.
Form of Telegrams to New Zealand.—Adoption of Isobaric Analysis.
113. Dr. Hector submitted the outline of a telegraphic code based on the isobaric analysis, and
pointed out that the whole system depended upon the assumption that the deductions which had led to the
adoption of the isobaric system in the Northern hemisphere were applicable to these colonies, and, with
sufficient accuracy, to our present observing stations. He considered that the-work done in New Zealand
since 1877 had completely established that proposition. He saw no benefit in other system that could
not be secured by the one he proposed, which would confer this one in addition, namely, that the members
of this Conference would use the terms now used by meteorologists at home, those terms having been
hitherto avoided in order to prevent any appearance of attachment, on the part of the members, to certain
theories. The method of curves hitherto adopted was well adapted for the study of storms after the disturb-
ances had passed over, but did not show where the centres of storms passed, the observing stations not
being movable to follow the centres which moved very irregularly. The geographical curves used by the
Sydney Observatory were very useful, but he did not'think that they gave a true idea of the grades of the
atmospheric disturbances. He moved that it was desirable to use the isobaric method of representing the
weather upon our coasts.
114. Mr. Russell concurred with Dr. Hector’s remarks as to isobars. He had not hitherto adopted
them, because he had felt that the observatories were not sufficiently numerous to enable us to trace the
lines; but as the number of stations was being increased from time to time, and as New Zealand and
Tasmania were now probably about to join in the scheme, he would be very glad to adopt the isobaric
system.
115. Di. Hector pointed out that the use of isobars would prevent the need for communicating
so many instrumental readings for weather purposes as are now sent, since, if a centre was mentioned
and the grade given for particular winds, the general character of the weather would be a matter of almost
necessary inference. He had no doubt, however, that for other purposes those readings would be
CLCSira DI6.
116. Mr. Todd was in favour of the isobaric method, and had been carrying it out for some time in
connection with the intercolonial system of weather telegraphy, but had not published the results, feeling
that they rested upon insufficient data, owing to the fewness of barometric stations.
117. Mr. Ellery said that seventeen years ago work was done at the Melbourne Observatory in
drawing curves from logs of ships and tracing out the isobars. This was continued for nearly two years,
but had been given up as perfectly useless, since there was no observations to be combined with those made
at the Observatory except such as were got at sea. The work was only given up because there were not a
sufficient number of observing stations in Australia to carry on the system. He thought it could now be
carried out, and therefore supported the motion.
118. Resolved unanimouslyXXXV. That the isobaric system of anaylsis of the weather reports
as in use in America and Europe, be adopted throughout Australasia on the basis of the instructions con-
tamed m the pamphlet by Mr. Ley, published by the Meteorological Council of Great Britain.
V r - Y ect ° r * as a basis for suggestions, had taken the study of two months’isobaric charts,
rplatbvnY nf°^ ed ' . He had t l been able t 0 find critical P lace for Zealand, the atmospheric
nf P ar . ts °* that col ° n y being so varied that no one place would give the means in
Australia of carrymg the isobars through New Zealand : in other words, the range of pressure within the
New


New Zealand area was greater than the great range between the centre and the outside of a disturbance.
Thus a disturbance, which ranged from the Leeuwin to Melbourne, might be so distorted as to be all
existent within the small area of New Zealand. He thought, therefore, that it would be best to give the
highest and lowest pressures in New Zealand. These islands lie right athwart of all the disturbances that
pass over them, which, as a rule, follow the east coast line, under its lee from south to north. If, therefore,
the extremes of pressure each day were telegraphed when a well-defined centre of disturbance was shown
passing any of the aspects (but only in those cases where the grade might be considered as a source of
dangerous winds); if, for instance, a depression was making off Foveaux Straits, i.e., off aspect D, and if
the depression had a light grade for N.W. winds, that information might be of great use to Australia, since
such depressions have frequently been observed to bring in a change to strong wind from the S.W., and this
might be the beginning of a very large depression, whose diameter might exceed a thousand miles. Thus,
if the grade were given, Australia might form some idea of the weather to be expected along its east coast.
He did not see that in any other way the telegrams from New Zealand would as yet be of immediate use
except for purposes of study. Another point to be mentioned was, that when these disturbances—which
often form a consecutive series—had heavy N.W. grades, the series is inclined to the meridian at a different
angle from those previously mentioned. These points were not yet completely settled, but he thought it
would be necessary to indicate when a depression existed with a grade above 002 for every 15 miles of
horizontal distance.
120. The general weather and all remarks would be referred to aspects as decided at the last
Conference. When in his report he said that these aspects were not satisfactory, he did not mean to imply
that he had yet sufficient knowledge to say how they should be amended. As an instance, he mentioned
Bealey, the central station in the South Island, which is considered to be in aspect D, but experience has
shown that it ought to be regarded as in the West Coast aspect, and not that of the East Coast, although it
is upon the east side of the mountains. If at any time he had to change the definition of an aspect, he
would give notice of it, and explain the reason.
121. He proposed to give the cyclonic weather for north or south winds, and what aspect they are
in, and the anti-evclonics, which are of great interest, since, for some unknown reason, in summer, when
they should have low pressure, a high pressure occurred over the land.
122. Dr. Hector then submitted a double-entry code, prepared to exhibit the aspects of the New
Zealand coast, and the cyclones, anti-cyclones, &c.
123. Mr. Bussell considered that what was wanted was to give such information as would be useful
to the public. It might not appear to be of much interest to the Sydney public to know the general weather
in New Zealand, but in reality it was of interest to business men and all connected with shipping. Par-
ticulars would therefore be extremely valuable.
124. Mr. Ellery agreed with this view, and considered that a little extension of the cypher code for
New Zealand would give all that was required.
125. Mr.. Russell thought that the telegrams should show the general state of the weather, and the
particular state, if such existed. He thought that the synoptical view of the weather in each colony should
be compiled by the chief officer of that colony.
120. Further discussion ensued, after which the principle of the form for synoptical telegrams trom
New Zealand to Australia was adopted.
The Conference adjourned to to-morrow at 10 o'clock a.m.
ROB. L. J. ELLERY.
26/4/81.
TUESDAY, 26th APRIL, 1881.
Present :
Mr. Ellery in the Chair.
Dr. Hector, | Mr. Russell,
Mr. Todd.
The Conference met at the Observatory at 10 o’clock a.m.
The minutes of the last meeting were read and confirmed.
Form of Telegrams from New Zealand to Australia , and vice versd.
The discussion on this subject was resumed.
127. Dr. Hector, in submitting a form of code, said that he had divided Australia into districts
somewhat similar to those into which New Zealand had been divided. , ~ ,
128 He proposed that, under the column headed “Over the Land, Australia should be divided
into the West Central and East Central districts; the word “General” being used when the phenomena
reported were common to the whole. He proposed that the name of each station should be only one word
thus—for “ Alice Springs” the word “ Alice” alone should be used. Reports should be sent from only one
station in each district, unless some unusual phenomenon appeared at one of the others, m which case its
importance would justify the cost of reporting it in full. The western section extended across the continent
from Darwin to Adelaide, including as its principal stations Darwin, Alice, and Adelaide. He su gg es * el * *at
Alice should be the station selected for the Central District. The Eastern District he proposed should take a
similar range in longitude, its stations being Ravenswood, Bourke, Demliqum, and Melbourne. The sectio
through Darwin and Adelaide he regarded as the plain country. That from Ravenswood to Melbourne
would embrace the country westward from the foot of the mountain range.
129. Mr. Todd observed that Darwin would report the tropical rams. '
130. Dr. Hector considered that that would be very valuable information, as the weather would
rvrohablv be found to be to some extent controlled by these rains. ,
P 131. Mr. Todd remarked that the monsoon rains this year did not extend further than 12 miles sou
of Tennent’s Creek.


132. After some discussion, Gunnedah, Tam worth, Bathurst, and Melbourne were selected as the
stations for the Eastern district, Bathurst to be the reporting station.
Dr. Hector proceeded further to explain the draft code, pointing out that the station selected to
report was underlined and proposed to be printed in italic letter.
133. The coast he had divided into aspects. Aspect A would be the promontory from Perth to
Israelite Bay (Weld), including the stations Perth and Albany, the latter to be the reporting station; aspect
B was proposed to extend from Israelite Bay to Cape Borda, including Eucla, Borda being the reporting
station ; aspect C from Cape Borda to Cape Otway, would include Robe, Cape Northumberland, Portland, and
Cape Otway, Portland to be the reporting station ; aspect D comprised Tasmania, Hobart being its station ;
aspect E, he suggested, should extend from Cape Otway to Cabo Island, including Georgetown, Wilson’s Pro-
montory, and Gabo being its reporting stations; aspect Fto include Jervis Bay, Sydney (reporting station),
Newcastle, and Macquarie; and aspect G should comprise Brisbane (reporting station), Rockhampton, and
Bowen. For exceptional phenomena, he considered that ordinary words should be used, and the particular
station be referred to by name if necessary. He moved that the decision of the Sydney Conference relative
to the division of Australia into aspects should be amended according to the schedule handed in as
follows :—•
134. Mr. Russell considered that the arrangement made at the Sydney Conference, by which each
colony or aspect sent an account of its own weather, was better than that proposed.
135. Resolved : —XXXYI. That the coastal aspects proposed by Dr. Hector be adopted.
136. Upon the proposition to adopt Dr. Hector’s division of inland Australia, Mr. Todd proposed
as an amendment that Port Darwin should be made a separate aspect, to be named the North Coast aspect,
it having a climate peculiar to itself and quite distinct from that of Central Australia, as represented by
Alice Springs; also, that, instead of East Central and West Central, the inland portion of the continent be
divided into “ Central Australia ” and the “Riverine District.”
137. Mr. Russell considered that storm centres were the most important phenomena to be watched
and that for this purpose the lines of barometers in the South Australian Stations, on the overland telegraph
line, should be taken, and similar lines through the other colonies. °
138. Dr. Hector explained that in laying out the proposed divisions he had looked upon Australia
as a large plain country, with a range of mountains on its eastern border. He had, therefore, divided it into
a Western and an Eastern district; the former being the whole of the plain country, and the latter the
country at the western face of the range. The deductions regarding changes of weather arisin" in the
south-east would be made by the costal aspects on the east coast, while changes passing to the °south of
Australia (which are of the greatest importance to New Zealand) would be inferred from the successive
coastal aspects along the south coast of the continent.
139. Resolved XXXVII. That the interior of Australia be divided into East Central and West
Central.
140. Resolved XXXVIII. That the specimen code prepared by Dr. Hector be adopted pro-
visionally. r r
. . motion of Mr. Russell, it was resolved : —XXXIX. That the daily telegrams exchanged
within Australia shall include the time of turning points of the barometer and shift of wind.
142. On the motion of Mr. Todd, it was resolved XL. That the members of the Conference
undertake to impress upon their respective Governments the need for promptitude in the despatch of
weather telegrams, and the desirableness of using coloured paper for the forms on which these messages are
written. °
Alterations in Code.
I 4 A Ellei 7 P ointed out that code had been found to be not quite perfect, but he had no
doubt that the American word method adopted in Australia was preferable to the figure code in which
opmion all the members concurred.
. , , 144 j Mr ' Bussell su ggested that the present extensive table for direction and force of the wind
might be advantageously reduced to sixteen or even to eight words, since the clerks would soon learn bv
heart so short a code, and there would be no need of constant reference to the printed code.
140. Dr. Hector pointed out that, though as few as four points might be sufficient for merely
keeping a general record of the weather, yet, for the purposes of isobaric analysis, the information should be
as mmute as possible.
P n 14 6;, ?w ol 7if d : T* LL present form of the code in Table IY. be altered, as suggested by Mr.
Russell, and that the selection of code words be left to Mr. Ellery.
147. Dr. Hector suggested that every code word should consist of two syllables
148. Mr. Russell recommended that in any reprint of the code, the sheet form should be adopted.
Mode of carrying out Resolution XIV.
, 149.-Mr Russell submitted the form of diagram used in New South Wales. Mr. Ellery stated
and fotToT P no diagrams. Mr. Todd was of opinion that if the barometer temperature, direction
and force of wind, and rainfall records appeared on the diagram it would be sufficient.
0. On the motion of Mr. Russell, it was resolved : —XLII. That in carrying out Resolution XIV

153. Moved by Mr. Russell, seconded by Mr. Todd, and unanimously resolved : —XLIY. That in
the opinion of this Conference the results obtained under the present weather telegram system prove that
storm centres pass from west to east over Australia and New Zealand at such a rate as permits of important
telegraphic warning being given of approaching gales; and that it is of very great importance so to extend
and°complete this system, that it may include all Australia and New Zealand.
154. In the discussion upon the above resolution, Mr. Russell, Mr. Todd, and Dr. Hector detailed
minutely numerous and well-marked instances of the facts upon which the resolution was based. ( Vide
155 On the motion of Dr. Hector, it was resolved unanimously : —XLY. That additional barometer
stations be established in the interior of Australia, with the view of tracing the latitude of passing storm
centres
156 On the motion of Mr. Todd, it was resolvedXLYl. That the Government of New South
Wales be requested to communicate with the Government of New Caledonia, and that the Government of
New Zealand be requested to communicate with the Government of Fiji, in order to obtain regular observa-
tions from those countries. . , _ . . £ •-u a
157. Dr. Hector stated that Mr. Holmes, a resident of Fiji, an able observer, had been furnished
by the Government of New Zealand with a complete set of instruments, and had supplied statistics regularly
since 1872, which had all been published. „ . . . ,
158 Mr. Russell said that he had sent instruments to New Caledonia, with a request that
observations might be regularly sent to him, but that these had ceased to be received after the first two
months.
Daily Weather Map.
159. Mr. Russell proposed that a map, including Australia and New Zealand, be adopted for plotting
the information upon for daily publication.
Mr. Ellery submitted a specimen map. . .
160. Dr. Hector said that it was necessary that upon any map used for this purpose the gaps m the
mountain New Wales there was a meteorological pass of very great
imperial which was a low place in the mountains at the head of the valley cut by the Hunter River,
and stated that he could often see the storms coming from the other side of the range long before y
reached Sydney. These disturbances came along the valleys, and passed out upon the coast at Port
Mat "'"T ti On the motion of Mr. Russell, it was resolved :-XLVIL That the weather map-be upon the
scale of the map submitted by Mr. Ellery ; that the projection to be used shalll * M -3andHew

times of their occurrence. ( b .)


(i b .) The temperature of the air at the same hour or hours, also the maximum and minimum.
(c.) Wet bulb thermometer readings at same hour or hours, or the humidity.
(d.) Amount and character of cloud, and upper current of cirri or high cloud.
(e.) Direction and force or Telocity of wind.
( f ) Rain during previous twenty-four hours, recorded at 9 a.m.
171. It was agreed that 9 a.m. local time should be adopted as the common epoch of these
observations.
172. During the discussion on the above resolutions Mr. Russell asked Mr. Ellery whether in his
experience so many as 1 per cent, of cases occurred where the maximum temperature of the day occurred in
the morning before 9 a.m. Mr. Ellery having replied in the affirmative, Mr. Russell expressed a doubt
whether the cases were numerous enough to make their record of any value, and his conviction that that
value would never compensate for the disadvantage of heating the thermometers with a lamp at night when
reading them.
173. The suggestion contained in Mr. Todd’s notice of motion ( vide par. 65 c /3) that a maximum
reading be taken at 9 p.m. was therefore rejected.
174. On the motion of Mr. Todd, it was resolved:—Llll. That the chief stations at Melbourne,
Sydney, Wellington, and Adelaide should, in addition to the foregoing, give maximum solar thermometer,
and minimum on grass, hours of sunshine, and the evaporation read off at 9 a.m. and 9 p.m.
Ozone.
175. On the proposition contained in Mr. Todd’s notice of motion, that ozone observations be made
at 9 a.m. and 9 p.m., Dr. Hector moved, Mr. Russell seconded, and it was unanimously resolved :
LIY. That, on account of the uncertainty of the tests adopted to detect ozone, the continuance of
observations on ozone be optional with each director.
Hourly Readings at Principal Stations.
176. Mr. Todd moved, —That in addition to the observations already resolved on, Melbourne, Sydney,
Wellington, and Adelaide should publish hourly readings of barograph (reduced to 32° and sea-level),
thermograph, and anemograph. The motion was negatived.
Curve Sheets and Synopsis.
177. On the motion of Mr. Todd, it was resolved :—LY. That (carrying out Resolution XIY. passed
at the previous Conference) curve sheets with synoptic reports on weather should be exchanged monthly :
it is recommended that these curves should show barometrical pressure at sea-level, temperature of air,
direction and force or velocity of wind, and rainfall, and that the synopsis should be in sufficient detail to
trace storms and other atmospheric disturbances. There should be a sufficient number of stations selected
in each Colony to supply data for forming isobaric maps for every day.
Adopted Mean Temperature.
178. Mr. Todd moved, —That the adopted mean temperature should be deduced from the min., the
9 a.m., the max., and the 9 p.m. readings, and that at the four principal stations this mean should be
compared with the hourly means.
179. Mr. Ellery, in reply to a question, stated that at his Observatory the mean was arrived at by
taking the mean of all the observations of the day, and applying to it a correction deduced from the hourly
observations.
180. Mr. Russell preferred to have the max. and min. observations without any correction.
181. Mr. Todd concurred with Mr. Russell, and explained that he read his min. at 9 a.m. and max.
at 9 p.m. It of course occasionally happened in the summer that a lower temperature than the min.
recorded at 9 a.m. was reached at a later hour during the same day when a southerly wind set in after a
hot wind.
182. Dr. Hector considered that it would be sufficient to take as the mean for the day the mean of
the max. and min., as the thermograph gave all the intermediate variations. He much preferred morning
readings to those taken in the evening.
183. In deference to a general consensus of opinion, Mr. Todd consented to omit the recommendation
of using the 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. readings in deducing mean temperature.
184. Whereupon it was resolved : —LYI. That the adopted mean temperature be deduced from the
max. and min. of the day read at 9 a.m., and at the four principal stations this mean should be compared
with the hourly means obtained from the thermograph.
Exposure of Thermometers.
185. Mr. Todd moved, —That the exposure of thermometers be uniform, or, if that cannot be effected,
the four principal stations, or one of them, should mount thermometers on each plan adopted by the other
colonies and compare the readings on each kind of stand with the readings of a rotatory thermometer in the
shade.
186. Mr. Russell suggested that this would not be necessary if a thermometer were sent round for
comparison.
r - Ellei T remarked that the proposal might be referred for a report to be brought up with
the further experiments to be made with swing thermometers, and the motion was postponed accordingly.
Dry and Wet Bulb Thermometers.
188. Mr. Todd moved, —That the dry and wet bulb thermograph readings should be compared with
the readings of the standard or ordinary dry and wet bulb thermometers at 9 a.m., 3 p.m., and 9 p.m. and
the readings of the thermograph should be referred to those of the ordinary dry and wet, or the corrections
supplied. He suggested that this might be left to each person who had a thermograph.
189.


189. Mr. Russell enquired what was to be done with the thermograph registrations—were they
published h
Mr. Ellery and Mr. Todd replied that theirs were not.
Dr. Hector said that he had never taken any.
190. The motion was negatived.
Rain-gauges.
191. On the motion of Mr. Todd, it was resolved:—LVll. That rain-gauges be of one uniform pattern
and size of receiving surface, viz., 8" in diameter, and that the height of the mouth of the receiver above
the surface of the ground be stated in the published observations.
192. In the discussion upon this resolution, Dr. Hector mentioned that he was in the habit of
causing a small mound of earth to be raised, into which the rain-gauge was sunk up to within 6 inches of
the lip.
193. Mr. Ellery disapproved of the artificial knoll.
Atmometer.
194. Mr. Todd moved, —That the form of atmometer adopted at Adelaide be recommended. This
consists of an outer tank of brick cemented, 4 feet square internal measurement, and an inner tank of slate
or marble, 3 feet square or 3 feet in diameter, both tanks being filled with water to the same level. The
amount of evaporation is read off by means of a float carrying a graduated rod and vernier divided into
0-01 inch.
195. Resolved:—LYlll. That the consideration of the best form of evaporator be deferred to the next
meeting of the Conference.
Form for Reports on Stations.
196. Mr. Russell said it had been remitted to him to prepare some form in which the members
should furnish a description of their stations. He produced form providing for—(l.) A description of the
instruments in use at the Observatory, or on stations containing recording instruments ; (2.) The names and
positions of stations having barometers and thermometers, &c. ; and (3.) The number of stations having rain-
gauges, or rain-gauges and thermometers.
197. Resolved :—LIX. That the form of return prepared by Mr. Russell for reporting stations and
their equipment be adopted.
Defective Max. and Min. Thermometers.
198. Mr. Todd drew the attention of the Conference to a common defect in maximum thermometers
received from Messrs. Negretti and Zambra. When these instruments were put into the ordinary approxi-
mately horizontal position the column of mercury ran down two or three degrees, from the expansion of the
aii’ near the bend of the tube.
199. Mr. Russell said he had had much experience with these instruments, and had found that many
were sent out in a defective state. He detailed the method of examination applied when thermometers
were offered to him for sale, and stated that if they passed that examination they seldom went wrong
afterwards. He suggested that Mr. Todd should return imperfect instruments to the makers.
200. Mr. Ellery said that he formerly had much trouble with these instruments, but it had never
occurred since he had obtained them through the Kew authorities.
201. Mr. Todd remarked that he got most of his in the same way, but nearly all were similarly
defective. To return them was practically impossible, partly because of the distance and partly because the
goods were already paid for.
202. After some further discussion, it was agreed that it would be best to draw the attention of the
Meteorological Department of the Board of Trade to the facts, in order that the evil might be remedied.
Estimates of Force, Ac., of Wind. — Anemometer.
203. Mr. Russell again drew attention to the question whether the present mode of estimating the
velocity of the wind where there was no anemometer should be continued, or whether some better means
should be adoped.
204. Dr. Hector considered that, for ordinary weather reporting stations, the estimates were sufficient.
205. Mr. Todd placed very little reliance upon estimates, but feared that, at most of the stations, the
instrument devised by Mr. Russell would be of little use, since the officer would seldom take the
trouble to go out of the shelter of the building. At liglit-houses and such places he would be quite pre-
pared to place a Robinson’s anemometer, and have it registered.
206. Mr. Ellery said he proposed to try Mr. Russell’s form of Robinson’s anemometer at some of the
light-houses on the coast, in order to test its value for measuring velocity of the wind.
The Conference then adjourned to to-morrow at 10 o'clock.

WEDNESDAY, 27th APRIL, 1881.
Present :
Mr. Ellery, in the Chair.
Dr. Hector, | Mr. Russell,
Mr. Todd.
The Conference met at the Observatory at 10 o’clock a.m.
The minutes of the last meeting were read and confirmed.
Co-operation of Tasmania.
207 Mr. Ellery drew attention to the fact that the communication from the Tasmanian Government,
which the Conference had been informed would be made before the meetings terminated, had not
received.


208. On the motion of Dr. Hector, it was unanimously resolved :—LX. That the evidence before
the Conference shows the paramount importance of obtaining the co-operation of Tasmania in Australian
meteorology; and the Conference therefore requests Mr. Ellery, the representative of Victoria, to continue
the steps he has already taken to secure the practical co-operation of that Government as soon as possible.
Weather Maps.
209. The method of securing perfect uniformity in the maps was discussed and agreed upon.
Rain-gauges .
210. Mr. Russell stated that it had come to his knowledge that rain-gauges were offered for sale and
were actually sold, which had an error of as much as 10 per cent. ; and that he thought it desirable to point
out to all persons interested in rain measurement the necessity for having accurate means of measurement.
On this motion it was resolved :
211. LXI. That this Conference, in view of the importance of, and general interest taken in, rain
observations, recommend private observers to use none but certified 8-inch gauges ; and that each member
of the Conference undertakes to certify to the accuracy of rain-gauges gratis.
Sliding Scale for Reducing Barometrical Observations.
212. Mr. Russell stated that during the past few months he had devised a sliding scale for reducing
barometrical observations for weather purposes, a copy of which he submitted. In his experience it had to
a great extent obviated the risk of error in reduction. Its use could be taken up immediately, only a few
minutes’ instruction being required even by a person who had no knowledge of the ordinary forms of com-
putation. A calculation had to be made for each station, and from its result a curve was plotted; this curve
varied with the altitude.
213. Mr. Ellery suggested that a series of diagrams might be constructed which should serve for all
altitudes.
214. Mr. Russell agreed that the suggestion was practicable, but had found that, for actual use, it
was best to compute for each station and plot it with its name upon the scale so that it could be easily seen.
215. Mr. Ellery enquired whether the index error of each barometer was indicated upon the scale.
216. Mr. Russell replied that he had introduced that element, so that the diagram crave the reading
corrected for index temperature and altitude.
217. Mr. Todd stated that he had for each station a small card, upon which all the corrections were
included for index error, altitude, and reduction to 32°.
218. Mr. Russell said that in constructing the diagrams computations were made for 40° and 80°.
219. Mr. Ellery said that in his opinion the method would be found as valuable as Mr. Russell’s
hygrometric sheet had been, and the other members of the Conference agreed in approving of Mr Russell’s
plan.
Report.
220. Dr. Hector moved, and it was unanimously resolved LXII. That the foregoing minutes be
adopted as the Report of the Conference, and that the Chairman be requested to report them to the
Government of Victoria, with a request that copies of them may be transmitted to the other Colonies
~ , , 2 : l ', A ™ te „ thanks , *0 y r - Eller y for his services as Chairman, and for the accommodation
afiorded to the Conference at the Observatory, was passed unanimously.
The Conference then terminated.

APPENDIX No. 2. —(Vide paragraph 154.)
The following extract from the Adelaide Meteorological Report for
put in by Mr. Todd, and affords evidence of the easterly progressive motion of atmospheric disturbance .
The mean barometer was about o'o6 inch to o'o7 b t ®}?T h * h i 7 a^ e ™f^^,Jg\ P m^inuin W (30’485l a I Adelaide on the
high—or above 30—during the first half of the month, or till the 17th, | & h / 0 f the 20th, or 29 358 at
9tl; and was below 30 from the 17th to the 29th reaching a ““uTSvK centre of till the 17th, and the
Cape Borda on the morning of the 21st. The high pressure prevai pressure extended not only over the whole of
records of other Colonies, as well as ships’ logs, show that to longitude 70° east, as vessels from the westward
Australia, but far to the westward m the Indian Ocean probably e*en during the first half of May. It was
report high barometer, one stating that it stood as high as 30 however it was only slight, not going below 30T ;
broken by a depression between the 10th and 12th at Euc a, , ’ eter f e p f ro m 30-45 on the 9th to 29’78 at
but more marked to the eastward, at Cape Northumberland, wher Springs in the centre of the continent. The
midnight of the 12th and 13th ; the depression was also at C7-'t c P m^e nced generally on the 15th, setting in
prominent barometrical feature of the month was the large dep > nuarter of an inch between the 12th and
from the westward. Thus Perth, on the west coast, reports a falloi: about one and Tasmania on the 16th. By
13th, but at Cape Borda the downward tendency did not commence south’of Cape Leeuwin on the 19th. The
ships’ reports, the centre of this depression appears to have] passed abort=2oo on tl ? e 20 th ; Cape Borda, 29'358
minimum pressure at Perth occurred also on the 19th, 29 381 , Eucla 2-9 3 , * P and Hobarti 29-05, about midnight
at 3h. a.m. on the 2lst; Cape Northumberland, 29-401, at 3h. p.m. on t falling to 29’497 ; Wellington, 29’290 ;
on 21st and 22nd. It reached New Zealand on the 25th, the barometer at Auckland tailing
and Dunedin, 29 - 293. On


On the south coast this depression was preceded by rains between the 13th and 14th, the wind being from the S.
along the coast as far as Cape Otway, and S.E. and southerly with high seas to Cape Howe, to the north of which along the
east coast the winds were W. and SAV., with a relatively low barometer, being four-tenths lower there than at Kangaroo
Island On the 15th the S.E. winds reached along the south coast from Wilson s Promontory to Kangaroo Island, with
clouded skies, whilst at Eucla it was N.N.E. and overcast, under the influence of the advancing depression. On the
east coast the winds were S. and S.E., the weather being generally clouded from Sydney round to Eucla the
barometer showing a rise of two-tenths at Cape Howe. On the 16th the wind was still from N.N.E. at Eucla, with falling
barometer, but S.E. and easterly along south coast from Wilson’s Promontory to Cape Borda and southerly with heavy
seas and rain on east coast; barometer steady then at Eucla. On the 17th wind still N.N.E at Eucla, E and S.E along
south coast from Cape Howe to Kangaroo Island, and southerly with high seas and falling barometer on east coast,
accompanied with rain. On the 19th the wind was from N. and N.E in fcouth Australia and along south coast to Mel-
bourne : but on the east coast the general direction was westerly, with falling barometer and clear skies. On the 20th the
wind was N.N.E. from Eucla throughout South Australia to Cape Otway and westerly on east coast the sky being
clouded in South Australia and Victoria, also in the interior of New South W ales and along east coast. The north winds
are maintained on the south coast, veering to the N. W. on the 22nd. W esterly through Bass s Straits and east coast on the
22nd and with the exte nded area of high pressure prevailing during the first half of the month and the subse-
quent large depression, the progress of which we have just traced, it may be well to call attention to a cyclonic disturbance
to the west and south of the Mauritius, reported by Mr. Meldrun, as it seems not improbable that the disturbance just
referred to here originated in the Indian Ocean, to the north of that island. T IQ *rn
The following is extracted from the Monthly Notices of the Meteorological Society, Mauritius, 17th June, 1879,
PagG Barometric depression of 25th April to 10th May, 1879 The mean height of the barometer on the 25th April was
30*103 inches, from which it gradually fell to 30-043 on the 29th. On the 30th April and Ist May it recovered a little,
but in the evening of the Ist it began to go down again, and continued falling till the sth, on which day its mean height
was 29-895 It then began to rise, and on the 10th was at 30-033. The highest reading (corrected and reduced) was 30146
at 9 a.m. on the 25th April, and the lowest, 29'862, at 3 p.m. on the 4th May.
“ From the 25th to the 29th April the wind veered from S.E. to E. On the 30th it backed to S.E. x E., and then
veered to N.E. on the 3rd May ; was light and variable on the 4th, from N.N. W. to W. on the sth and 6th, from W. to
S.W. on the 7th, from W.S.W. on the Bth and 9th, and from the S. on the 10th.
“ On the night of the 3rd to the 4th May there was a thunderstorm, and also some thunder and lightning throughout
the 4th. From 9 a.m. of the 3rd to 9 a.m. on the 4th, 375 inches of rain fell at the Observatory.
“ These atmospheric disturbances indicated the existence of heavy weather away to the southward and westward,
and it is now known that on the 6th May two vessels, the J [aria Elizabeth and the Wayrien, were dismasted in about
latitude 29° S. and longitude 53° E.” . „ .
This last position, it will be seen, is about 420 miles E.S.E. of the locality given by the ship Windsor Castle on the
4th, in the following paragraph, which would show the storm to have had a progressive motion of about 210 miles per day
in an E.S.E. direction. .. ~ f „ r ....
The ship Windsor Castle , from Port Pirie, in South Australia, to Antwerp, appears to have felt the full force of this
storm on 4th May, in latitude 27° 10', longitude 45° 45' east, or about 200 miles south of Madagascar. The captain reports
as o p or t Pirie roads (South Australia) on 13th March ; passed Cape Borda on the 19th. Had light S.E. trades
across the Indian Ocean to latitude 27° 10' S., longitude 45° 45' E., when, on 4th May, was overtaken by a cyclone, which
came on at the N. and veered by the W. to S.E. During this gale, and for several hours before its commencement, a
mountainous sea was running from S.W. Had for four days previous hot sultry weather, with light variable winds. In
the height of the storm the vessel was forced over on her beam-ends, and everything movable on deck washed overboard;
two harness casks full of beef and pork, which were lashed under the topgallant forecastle for present use, were washed
adrift, and their contents went overboard ; the carpenter’s tool chest, which was lashed in the same place as the cask,
was stove in and some of the tools washed overboard ; the half-deck and galley doors 3tove in, and one of the iron posts
wrenched off its hinges; the gig was floated out of her chocks and dashed against the lifeboat, both boats received damage;
the force-pump was washed about the main deck and broken.”
On the 18th of May the barque Elizabeth reports experiencing a storm in 118° E., lat. 39° S., the barometer falling to
28*9 inches.
The clipper ship Oberon, from England, on the same day, in long. 115° E., lat. 39° S., had a violent S.E. gale, the
barometer falling to 21 16 on the 19th, having evidently sailed into the S.W. quadrant of the storm.
The barque Alice Mary, from Port Louis, on the 18th, in long. 114° E., lat. 37° S., reports the wind to have veered
to S.E., blowing a heavy gale with high confused sea. Fierce gale on the 19th, and the ship was hove-to from the 20th to
the 23rd.
The central depression passed therefore from the meridian of Cape Leeuwin to Hobart in about sixty hours, more or less,
and had a mean velocity of about 26 miles an hour ; but the velocity increased as the disturbance advanced eastward, as
between Cape Leeuwin and Eucla it moved at about the rate of 570 miles a day, 650 per day between Eucla and Cape
Northumberland, and 960 miles per day between Cape Northumberland and Tasmania ; this increased velocity in the
neighbourhood of Tasmania may be accounted for by the supposition that the area of low pressure then lying to the S. E.
of Cape Howe in a great measure lessened the resisting medium in front. The storm off Madagascar had a velocity of
about 210 a day, and assuming a gradually increased velocity to a mean of about 300 miles a day between the 6th and
19th would bring it off the Leeuwin on the 18th or 19th. It seems not improbable, therefore, that the storms were identical,
and that having passed southwards between Madagascar and the mainlands of Africa, it recurved to the eastward, traversing
the Indian Ocean to Australia, on the south side of the area of high pressure, which, however, did not move bodily off the
continent to the eastward, but gradually contracted and was dissipated ; thus we find on the 10th that the isobar of 30"4,
which on the 9th embraced an area of about 800,000 square miles, extending from Melbourne to beyond Eucla, with an
average breadth from N. to S. of about 500 miles, was restricted to an area of only some 20,000 square miles over the
Riverina District of New South Wales, north of the Murray, Deniliquin being about the centre. It should be added that
the barometrical depression which we have described as setting in from the westward, passing Perth on the 19th, was felt
slightly on the north coast at Port Darwin, and was very marked in the centre of the continent, where, at Alice Springs,
the mercury fell from 30 46 on the 15th, to 29 "72 on the afternoon of the 18th, remaining low till the afternoon of the 22nd,
the barometer at all other times of the month being there over 30 inches.
