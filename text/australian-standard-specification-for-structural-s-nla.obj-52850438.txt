PREFACE.
The benefits accruing from a considered system of Engineering Standard-
isation have met with but a tardy recognition in Australia. It was not until
the necessities of war pressed the subject to the foreground that any tangible
steps were taken towards introducing a systematic scheme for engineering
standardisation in the Commonwealth. The Institute of Science and Industry
has given considerable attention to the matter, and after informing itself fully
as to what has been done in other countries and after consulting various experts
in Australia, it put forward the outline of a scheme for the creation of an
Australian Engineering Standards Association.*
11l the meantime the question of reducing the number of Structural Steel
Sections used in Australia and of standardising the steel used for these sections
had received the attention of Mr. Walter Leitch, C.8.E., first Director of the
Bureau of Commerce and Industry. Mr. Leitch, in his capacity as Director of
Munitions, during the period of the war, had found that, owing to the restrictions
on shipping and other factors, Australian requirements in the numbers of
Sections in Structural Steel like'those of Great Britain could be reduced
considerably. In order that some idea of the actual requirements might, be
gained, and with a view of the standardisation, as far as practicable, of
Structural Sections for general requirements, and further with the object of
assisting the Australian manufacturers to produce such Sections, Mr. Leitch
decided to convene a Conference of representatives of the Institutes of
Architects, Institutes and Societies of Engineers, and Departments of Railways,
as well as of producers, importers, and users of steel in Australia. A meeting
was called to be held on the sth March, 1919, but owing to influenza restrictions
the date was indefinitely postponed.
At a later date Mr. Stirling Taylor, Mr. Leitch’s successor as Director of
the Bureau of Commerce and Industry, arranged for the postponed Conference
to be held on the 12th July, 1919, and then, having secured a representative
gathering of those interested, he carried out Mr. Leitch’s original intention of
handing over the whole matter to the Institute of Science and Industry.
Professor T. R. Lyle, D.Sc., F.R.S., member of the Executive Committee of the
Institute, was elected Chairman of the Conference, the following being present: —
Mr. J. Vicars, Engineering Association, N.S.W.
Mr. B. J. Smart, B.Sc. (Lond.), Testing Engineer, Public Works
Department, N.S.W.
Mr. W. J. Doak, Queensland Railways and Institute of Engineers.
Mr. H. W. Curchin, Chief Executive Officer, Commonwealth Ship
Construction.
Mr. E. E. Lucy, M.1.M.E., Railway Department, N.S.W.
Mr. E. Campbell, E. Campbell and Sons, Melbourne.
Mr. E. A. Evans, M.1.M.E., Railway Department, W.A
* The scheme has now been agreed to by the engineering societies, aad a recommendation made to the
Commonwealth Government for the establishment of a Standards Association.

Prof. T. R. Lyle, Institute of Science and Industry.
In his opening speech to the Conference, Professor Lyle said that he regarded
the presence of so many representatives of the Engineering, Architectural,
Manufacturing, and other interests as an indication of their sympathy with
the proposed scheme to reduce the number of Standard Sections of Structural
Steel that users would demand from the manufacturers. If any measure of
success attended the Conference it would result in the possibility of our steel
industry being so organised that Australia would in a large degree be inde-
pendent of outside sources, so far as Structural Steel is concerned. The
sections selected would be adopted as the Australian Standard Sections, and
in addition it would be necessary to agree upon the standard specification
of the steel and on the chemical and physical tests for it.
Standardisation had been the making of many industries in England,
America, and Germany, and it was unnecessary for him to stress before such an
audience as present its special value in the engineering industries.
Professor Lyle pointed out that the Conference was really the beginning
of a definite attempt on the part of the Institute of Science and Industry to
attack the general question of the standardisation for Australia of engineering
materials and processes. Already the Institute, in conjunction with the
Federal Electrical Association, has made considerable progress in Electrical
Standardisation, and conferences would shortly be held to deal with the
standardisation for Australia of railway rails and fish-plates and of tramway
rails.
By means of these and the present Conference it was hoped that Australia
would become more nearly self-supporting, as far as steel is concerned. We
have, however, a long way to go, for although the annual consumption of steel
and steel products in the Commonwealth is between 700,000 and 800,000 tons,
yet the total local production is only between 200,000 and 250,000 tons.

It was a patriotic act, the Chairman said, to nurture and help forward any
Australian industry, and he hoped that the members of the Conference and all
users of structural steel would loyally abide by the findings, and so help
forward the steel industry in Australia.
The Institute of Science and Industry, which he represented, would afford
assistance in carrying out any investigations required, or else in supplying
funds for such work as may be required in deciding on standards, and it will
also use its influence with Governments, public bodies, and large users to
secure the adoption of the standards when determined.
The Institute had already convened representative meetings in all of the
States for the purpose of bringing into notice the necessity for Engineering
Standardisation in Australia, and it is interesting to note that the general
consensus of opinion in all the States was that it was desirable to adopt the
British Standard Specifications wherever possible. He hoped that this would
be the spirit of the meeting.
The Executive Committee of the Institute of Science and Industry desires
to express its acknowledgment of the services rendered by Professor Lyle in
bringing the deliberations of the Conference to a successful issue, and in pre-
paring many of the details of this 'Specification.
The Committee also desires to express its thanks to the British Engineering
Standards Association for permission to reproduce the illustrations of the
sections shown in Appendix 11.

AUSTRALIAN STANDARD SPECIFICATION
FOR STRUCTURAL STEEL.
1. PROCESS OF MANUFACTURE.
(а) Steel shall be made by the Open Hearth Process (Acid or Basic) unless
either process is required or specified, and must not show on analysis more
than 0 - 06 per cent, of Sulphur or Phosphorus.
(б) Steel may be made either by the Open Hearth Process (Acid or Basic)
or by the Bessemer Process (Acid or Basic) unless any one of the four processes
is required or specified, and must not show on analysis more than O’oB per
cent, of Phosphorus, and not more than O’o6 per cen<. of Sulphur.
Now. — (h) Steel is not intended for Bridges nor for Plates \ inch in thickness
and over and Rivet Bars.
2. QUALITY OF FINISHED STEEL.
All finished steel as sent from the mills shall, subject to the provisions of
Clause 18, be well and cleanly rolled to the dimensions, sections, and weights
specified or required, shall be sound and free from cracks, surface flaws,
laminations, rough jagged and imperfect edges, and all other defects, shall be
finished in a workmanlike manner, and shall in all respects comply with the
tests and requirements herein mentioned applicable to the description of
material ( e.g ,, plates, sections, bars, rivets, &c.) required or specified.
3. TENSILE TEST PIECES.
The tensile strength and elongation of all steel shall be determined from
Standard Test Pieces cut lengthwise or crosswise from plates, and lengthwise
from sections and bars.
The test pieces shall not be annealed or otherwise subjected to heat treat-
ment, unless the material from which they afe cut is similarly treated, in
which case the test pieces shall be similarly and simultaneously treated with
the material before testing.
Any straightening of test pieces which may be required shall be done
cold.
The rolled surface of the steel wherevecpractioable shall be retained on
two opposite sides of the test piece, but in the case of bars having diameters
or sides not exceeding 3 inches the bars may be reduced by turning. For
bars having diameters or sides above 3 inches the test piece may, at the option
of the Maker, be taken from the position shown in the sketches.


4. SELECTION OF TENSILE TEST PIECES.
Tensile test pieces shall be selected by the Purchaser or by the Engineer
or Inspector—
(а) Either from shearings, or, if he so desire,
(б) From the plates, sections, and bars before or after they have been
cut to the sizes required.
In the latter case (b) if the test is satisfactory the Purchaser shall pay the
Maker the value of the plate, section, or bar from which the test piece has
been cut, or accept delivery of the same as though such test piece had not been
cut therefrom.
In neither case ( (a) or (6)) shall the test pieces be detached from the plates,
sections, or bars, except in the presence of the Purchaser or of the Engineer
or Inspector.
5. TENSILE TESTS.
The tensile breaking strength of all steel determined from the Standard
Test Pieces hereinafter referred to shall be as follows :
(a) Plates, Sections(e.g., Angles, Tees, Beams, Channels, Sc.), and Flat Bars.- -
The tensile breaking strength of all plates, sections (such as angles, tees, beams,
channels, &c.), and flat bars, except where required for welding, shall be
between the limits of 28 and 33 tons per square inch of section. The elongation
measured on the Standard Test Piece A (see Appendix, page 13) shall be not
less than 20 per cent, for steel of 0'375 inch in thickness and upwards, and not
less than 16 per cent for steel below 0'375 in thickness.
lb) Board and Square Bars. —The tensile breaking strength of round ana
square bars (other than rivet bars) shall be between the limits of 28 and 33 tons
per square inch of section, with an elongation of not less than 20 per cent
measured on the Standard Test Piece B (see Appendix, page 13), or not less
than 24 per cent, measured on the Standard Test Piece P (see Appendix,
page 14). The bars may be tested the full size as rolled.
(c) Rivet Bars. —The tensile breaking strength of rivet bars shall be between
the limits of 25 and 30 tons per square inch of section, with an elongation
of not less than 25 per cent, measured on the Standard Test Piece B (see
Appendix, page 13), or not less than 30 per cent, measured on Standard Test
Piece F (see Appendix, page 14). The bars may be tested the full size as
rolled.
Generally —Provided that fcr steel under -jfc inch (0'312 inch) in thickness
or diameter bend tests only shall be required.
6. NUMBER OF TENSILE TESTS.
Two tensile tests shall be taken from each cast or batch. These test
pieces shall be cut from the finished steel as rolled from each of any two
ingots in each cast or batch as may be selected by the Purchaser or Engineer
or Inspector.
In the event of either of such test pieces failing to comply with the tests
hereinbefore mentioned, three additional test pieces shall be taken from
the same cast or batch of steel and tested in a similar manner.
7


The acceptance of such cast or batch of steel shall be final if the majority
of all the tests comply with the conditions prescribed, otherwise the cast or
batch will be liable to rejection at the discretion of the Purchaser or the Engineer
or Inspector.
Should a tensile test piece break outside the middle half of its gauge length,
the test may, at the Maker’s option, be discarded, and another test be made
of the same plate, section, or bar.
7. COLD AND TEMPER BEND TEST PIECES.
Bend tests of all steel (other than Rivet Bars) shall be made from the teat
pieces prepared as follows :
Bend test pieces shall be sheared or cut lengthwise or crosswise from plates
and lengthwise frcm sections and round and square bars, and shall be not less
than 1| inches wide, but for round or square bars of less than 2 inches diameter
or side, or flat bars of less than 2 inches wide, pieces cut from the bar as rolled
may be used.
In all cold bend tests, and in temper bend tests on samples O's inch in
thickness and above, the rough edge or arris caused by shearing may be
removed by filing or grinding, and samples 1 inch in thickness and above
may have the edges machined, but the test pieces shall receive no other
preparation.
The test pieces shall not be annealed or otherwise subjected to heat treatment
unless the material frcm which they are cut is similarly treated, in which
case the test pieces shall be similarly and simultaneously treated with the
materia] before testing.
%
8. SELECTION OF BEND TEST PIECES.
Bend test pieces shall be selected by the Purchaser or by the Engineer or
Inspector
(a) Father from shearings, or, if he so desire.
(i b ) From the plates, sections, and bars before or after they have been
cut to the sizes required or specified.
In the latter case (b) if the test is satisfactory the Purchaser shall pay the
Maker the value of the plate, section, or bar from which the test piece has been
cut, or accept delivery of the same, as though such test piece had not been cut
therefrom.
9. COLD BEND TESTS.
For cold bend tests the test piece shall withstand, without fracture, being
doubled over either by pressure or by blows from a hammer until the internal
radius is not greater than one and a half times the thickness of the test piece,
and the sides are parallel.
For sections having flanges less than 2 inches wide these bend tests may be
made from the greatest width of flat material obtainable from the section.
8


10. TEMPER BEND TESTS.
For a temper bend test the test piece shall he heated to a blood red and
•quenched in water at a temperature not exceeding 80° Fahr. The colour shall
be judged indoors in the shade. The test piece shall then withstand, without
fracture, being doubled over either by pressure or by blows from a hammer
until the internal radius ri not greater than one and a half times the thickness
of the test piece, and the sides are parallel.
For sections having flanges less than 2 inches wide these bend tests may
be made from the greatest width of flat material obtainable from the section.
11. NUMBER OF COLD AND TEMPER BEND TESTS.
Either a cold or temper bend test shall be made from each batch of not
more than 5 tons, and these two kinds of tests shall be in about equal number
from the material ordered.
For rivet bars cold or temper bend tests are not required.
12. NUMBER AND KINDS OF TESTS OF MANUFACTURED RIVETS.
Manufactured rivets selected from the bulk, in such number as may be
specified or as may be approved by the Purchaser or by the Engineer, shall
withstand the following tests :
(a) The rivet shanks to be bent cold, and hammered until the two parts
of the shank touch in the manner shown in Figure 1, without
fracture on the outside of the bend.
( b) The rivet heads to be flattened, while hot, in the manner shown in
Figure 2, without cracking at the edges. The head to be
flattened until its diameter is two and a half times the diameter
of the shank.
FIG. 1.
FIG. 2.
13. ADDITIONAL COLD AND TEMPER BEND TESTS AND TESTS
OF MANUFACTURED RIVETS.
Should any of the test pieces or rivets first selected not fulfil the tests
applicable to the description of material to be tested, two additional test
pieces or rivets may be taken, and should either of them fail to fulfil such
tests, all steel from the cast or from each batch of not more than 5 tons in the
case of the bend test from which the test pieces have been taken may be
rejected. The additional tests shall be carried out in the same manner in all
lespects as the tests hereinbefore required to be made in the first instance.
C. 14487.—2

14. TESTS BY CHEMICAL ANALYSIS.
The Maker shall supply an analysis of each cast of steel when required go-
to do by the Purchaser or by the Engineer. Such analysis shall he made from
drillings taken from a test ingot obtained from the ladle and from about the
middle ingot of the cast during teeming. Drillings from this test ingot to
be supplied to the Purchaser or the Engineer or Inspector for check analysis
should it be so desired. The Maker shall supply the Purchaser, the Engineer,
or Inspector with a certified copy of the analysis of each cast if required to
do so.
15. MAKER’S TESTS AT HIS WORKS.
All the test pieces after they have been marked for testing shall (except
as provided in Clause 16) he prepared by tbe Maker and tested at bis works
and at his cost (and, if the Purchaser or Engineer so desire), in the presence
of the Purchaser or of the Engineer or Inspector. If the Maker fails to prepare
properly the test pieces for testing or to test the steel properly at his works in
the manner herein provided, the Purchaser or the Engineer may, at Die Maker’s
cost, have the test pieces prepared for testing and the steel tested in the State
in which the Maker’s works are situated.
16. PURCHASER’S TESTS.
Four days’ notice shall be given by the Maker to the Purchaser and to
the Engineer of the date when he will be ready for the Purchaser or the
Engineer or Inspector to select the test pieces. If within seven clays after the
receipt of such notice the Purchaser or the Engineer shall give notice in
writing to the Maker that he desires the test pieces to be prepared and tested
at a place to he named in the notice within the State in which the Maker's
works are situated, the tests shall then.be carried out at such place, and
at the Purchaser’s cost (and if the Maker so desires in the presence of the
Maker or of the person deputed by him to witness the tests). In the
event of such notice being given by the Purchaser or by the Engineer, the
Maker shall be allowed at least seven days from the receipt of such notice
before the selection of the test pieces. The tests must be completed within
fourteen days from the selection of the test pieces, failing which the tests shall
he carried out at the Maker’s works.
17. INSPECTION.
The Purchaser, the Engineer, and the Inspector shall at all reasonable times
have free access to the Maker’s works, and to all places under his control
where steel is being manufactured, and shall be at liberty to inspect the
manufacture of the steel at all stages.
18. MARGIN OVER AND UNDER DIMENSIONS AND WEIGHTS.
(o) Specified Lengths. —When steel in bars or sections is specified to be cut
to certain lengths it shall be cut within a margin of 1 inch under or 1 inch over
the specified length, but if the Maker is required to take his cutting margin
over and not under the length specified the margin shall be within 2 inches
over.
(6) Exact Lengths. —Where “ exact ” lengths are specified, the steel in bars
or sections shall be cold sawn or machined within a margin of £ inch over or
under the length specified.
10


(c) Weights. —The rolling margin on plates, sections, and bars shall be
between 2| per cent, over and 2| per cent, under the specified weights. Where
a minimum weight of section of steel is specified the margin shall be 5 per cent,
over. Where a maximum weight of section of steel is specified the margin
shall be 5 per cent, under.
19. CALCULATION OF WEIGHT.
The weight of plates shall be as calculated on the basis that steel weighs
40'8 lbs. per square foot per inch.of thickness, and the weight of sections and
bars on the basis that steel weighs 3 - 4 lbs. per square inch of sectional area
per foot run.
20. IDENTIFICATION OF CAST.
The Maker shall mark the ingots, billets, slabs, plates, sections, bars, &c.,
in such a way as to enable all finished steel to be traced to the original cast.
Every facility for tracing the steel to the original cast shall be given to the
Purchaser and to the Engineer and Inspector.
21. BRANDING OR MARKING.
Every piece of steel shall be legibly marked with the Maker's mime or
trade mark, and with cast numbers or identification marks by which the steel
can be traced to the oast from which it was made. For rivet bars and small
pieces securely bundled, a metal tag marked with the cast number will be
sufficient. Before the test pieces are selected, the Maker shall furnish the
Purchaser with copies of the mill sheets, giving complete lists of all plates,
sections, or bars in each cast, with sizes and weights, and the numbers or
marks by which each plate, section, or bar can be identified.
22. MAKER’S CERTIFICATE.
(a) When no Inspection has taken place.— ln the case of any steel which
has not been inspected at the Maker’s works, the Maker or Merchant, as the case
may be, shall supply the Purchaser and the Engineer with a certificate stating
the process of manufacture and a test sheet signed by the Maker giving the
results of each of the mechanical tests applicable to the description of material
purchased, and when required of the chemical analysis also. Bach test sheet
shall indicate the numbers or identification marks of the casts to which it
applies corresponding with the numbers to be found on the plates, sections,
bars, &c.
(b) When Steel is taken from Stock. —Where any steel is taken from a
Merchant’s stock, the Purchaser or the Engineer may either (1) have the
steel tested at such place as in Clause 16 provided and at his own expense, or
(2) the Merchant shall satisfy the Purchaser or the Engineer by means of
numbers or identification marks on the steel, combined with a Maker’s certi-
ficate, that such steel has been tested and complies with the whole of the
tests and requirements of this Specification applicable to the description of.
material required or specified.


23. NON-COMPLIANCE WITH TESTS AND REQUIREMENTS.
Should any steel not comply with the whole of the foregoing tests' and
requirements applicable to the description of material required or specified,
all the steel in the cast from which the tests have been taken may be
rejected.
24. DELIVERY.
No steel shall be despatched from the Maker’s works until it has been
tested and complies with, or has been certified (in the cases mentioned in
Clause 22) to comply with, the whole of the tests and requirements of this
Specification applicable to the description of material required or specified.
25. REJECTION AFTER DELIVERY.
The foregoing tests shall, except as provided for in Clause 16 and in Clause
22, Sub-section (6), be made at the Maker’s works prior to despatch ; but in
the event of any of the steel proving unsatisfactory in the course of being
worked, such steel may be rejected notwithstanding any previous acceptance.
26. ARBITRATION.
In case any dispute shall arise between the parties to any contract in
which, this Specification is in whole or part incorporated as to whether any
process of manufacture required or specified, or any test or requirement of this
Specification has or has not been carried out 05 complied with, or as to whether
any steel is or is not of the quality or free from the defects mentioned in
Clause 2, or as to whether any steel proves unsatisfactory in the course of
being worked as provided in Clause 25, then such dispute shall be referred to the
arbitration of a person to be appointed, at ’the request of either party to the
said dispute, by the Chairman for the time being of the Australian Engineering
Standards Association when established, and pending the establishment of
such an Association by the , Chairman of the Executive Committee of the
Institute of Science and Industry ; provided always that if such dispute is
within the terms of any other agreement to refer or submit to arbitration
this Clause shall be of no effect.


APPENDIX I.
FORMS OF AUSTRALIAN STANDARD TENSILE TEST PIECES.
Test Piece A.
Nole. —The widths of the - test pieces for plates are selected to comply
with the two following conditions : —(1) As the great bulk of plates to be
tested are from | inch to | inch thick, it is desirable for the sake of convenience
that the test pieces for such plates shall be of uniform width and, in accordance
with very general practice, a width of 2 inches was selected. (2) With a test
piece of a given form, the percentage of elongation is found to be less for thick
plates than for thin ones ; with steel of the same quality in other respects it
is desirable therefore to choose widths of test piece which will be slightly
in favour of the thicker plates. This is secured with the widths selected for
the Standard Test Piece of Form A.
Test Piece B.
Note. —All test pieces of form B are strictly similar, and for the same
material give the same percentage of elongation. They are nearly similar to
a test piece of form A, 8 inches in gauge length, 2 inches wide, and f inch
thick.
13


Test Piece C.
Test Piece D.
Test Piece E.
Note. —These are arranged to meet the very common practice of making
test pieces for forgings, axles, tyres, &c., of either J square inch or \ square
inch in sectional area. With the gauge lengths decided upon these three
forms .are very nearly similar, and, for a given material, give very approxi-
mately the same percentage of elongation. Though not exactly, they are
approximately similar to the Standard Test Piece F, and for the same
material give a nearly identical, but slightly* greater, percentage of elongation.
Test Piece F (for Test Pieces over 1 inch Diameter).
Note. —ln some testing machines it is found inconvenient to use form B
for bars of over 1 inch in diameter and form F of half the gauge length is designed
to meet such cases. For a given material the percentage of elongation with
Test Piece F is greater than with Test Piece B, and this difference is provided
for in this Specification.
Form of Ends.
Note. —In the case of the round Test Pieces B, C, D, E, and F, the form of
the ends is to be as required in order to suit the various methods employed for
gripping the test piece. When enlarged ends are used the length of the parallel
portion of the test piece must in no case be less than that noted on the
diagrams.
