HISTORY OF AUSTRALIAN TERTIARY GEOLOGY.
BY THE REV. J. E. TENISON-Woods, F.G.S., F.L.S.,
CORR. MEM. ROY. SOC. TAS., AND N. S. WALES.
[Read Wth July, 1876.]
The first person to call attention to the tertiary formations of Aus-
tralia was Capt. Flinders, who, in his surrey of the south coast in
1802, noticed the fossiliferous cliffs of the Australian Bight. He
imagined them to hare been derired from some rast coral reef.
Tertiary geology as such was not then known. In 1829 Capt. Sturt
traced down the Murray Hirer, and in doing so came to a portion
bounded on each side by high limestone cliffs, which were one
mass of fossils, many of which converted into selenite. He
identified some of those collected with European forms, and though
in this he was mistaken, yet he was correct in designating the
formation as tertiary. The subject then remained in abeyance,
except from some care remains sent home by Sir Thomas Mitchell,
until 1859, when, encouraged by Sir Charles Lyell, who was in a
great measure my instructor in geology, I prepared an account of
the tertiary formation in South Australia, for the Geological Society,
which was published by them. This was accompanied by a valuable
notice of the Polyzoa and Foraminifera, by Professors Busk and
Rupert Jones respectively. These investigations were followed by
my work on the Geology of South Australia, in 1862, subsequent
to which the regular reports of the Victorian Geological Survey nave
thrown a flood of light upon the whole subject. Professor McCoy
has from time to time issued notices of some of the most interesting
fossils and their affinities, while two parts of the “ Decades ” of
the Museum have been dedicated to Palaeontology, principally
tertiary. Within the last ten years Professor Duncan, the illustrious
President of the Geological Society, has steadily devoted himself to
the elucidation of the Australian Tertiary Corals ; while Professor
Laube, in Vienna, has given equal attention to our fossil Echinoder-
mata. The eminent palaeontologist, Thomas Davidson, has taken
our Brachiopoda in hand, —a work begun already by Robert
Etheridge, jun., who has also, with Professor Duncan, added
something to our knowledge of the Echinodermata.
It will be seen from this brief sketch that though the tertiary
formations of Australia have occupied many minds, yet our pro-
gress, so far, has been somewhat slow. This is the more remarkable,
as it has long been believed among scientific men that the develop-
ment of Australian geology must reveal facts of the utmost im-
portance to science generally. It has been remarked by some
geologists that the present state of Australia is very similar to what
Europe was immediately after the secondary or Mesbzoic period.
The position of Australia renders it less liable to an admixture
of its species with those of other continents, and therefore its
natural nistory is to a certain extent peculiar to itself. In the Flora
he correspondence to the Mesozoic period is well marked. There
3


tho Araucaria;, so common in the secondary rocks, are represented ;
and these are only found in tho Pacific Islands and Australia.
There are the Lamia: and Arthroxamiic found only at the Capo of
Good Hope and Australia, being closely allied to species found in
secondary deposits.
With regard to the Mammalia, no indigenous animals have been
found distinct from the Marsupialia except rodents, and one or
two species about whose introduction doubts have been entertained.
The rodents belong to an order which has many affinities with
marsupials, and in one genus, Fhastolomys, the characters are in-
terchanged.
Tho following passage from Mantell’s ‘‘'Wonders of Geology”
will show that the views of geologists on this subject were. Speaking
of tho Wealden strata, he says ;—“ Nor can wo resist the conviction
that not only did the same terrestrial area, however modified it must
have been during tho long succession of ages, supply the debris of
an almost unchanged system of animal and vegetable life to the
Jurassic seas at first, and subsequently to the Cretaceous ocean ;
but that, also, tho fauna and flora of this ancient land of the
secondary epoch had many important features which now characterise
Australia, The Stoncsfiold marsupials and tho Purbeck Plagiaulax
are allied to genera now restricted to Australia and Tasmania, and
it is a most interesting fact, as Professor Phillips was first to
remark, that the organic remains with which these relics are
associated also correspond with existing forms of tho Australian
Continent and neighbouring seas ; for it is in those distant latitudes
that the waters are inhabited by Cestracions, Trigonia: and Terihra-
tuke, and that tho dry land is clothed with Araucaria:, tree ferns,
and cycadeous plants.”
These facts, coupled with tho circumstance that no true
secondary rocks had been found in Australia, lent groat force to
the opinion that we had in Australia a continent which, having
been dry land during the Mesozoic epoch and only a small
portion of it since submerged, had preserved tho fauna and flora
of that time. But later investigations have shown that we
possess on tho continent nearly every leading representative of
the secondary strata of Europe. In Western Australia, and in
Southern Queensland, the lower and middle Mesozoic formations
are largely represented ; while in N.E. Australia and all around
Carpentaria wo have immense areas exclusively occupied with
deposits which very closely represent the upper and lower
Cretaceous with the Greensand of Europe.
The more advanced state of our knowledge places us now in a posi-
tion to give a solution to many important questions which naturally
arise. Tho first is whether tho secondary forms show any remark-
able divergence from tho typical forms of that period. To this we
may answer in the negative. In accordance with tho general rule
in geology that the lower we descend in time the wider the range of
species and tho closer the resemblances, wo find a strong resem-
blance, and, perhaps, in some cases, an identity which enables us
to say not only that tho fossils are secondary, but, also, to what
particular subdivision of the secondary rocks they belong. As a
further illustration of tho same rule, wo find in our Pakcozoic


(Devonian) rocks absolute specific identity with European forms,
with rare exception.
This being the case, it becomes most interesting to ask, in the
interests of the evolution theory, whether there are in our tertiary
formations any signs of a persistence of the secondary types, so that
their preservation, in the existing state of things, can be accounted
for. To this, w r o must again answer “no.” The secondary
typos in the tertiary rocks of Australia arc few and rare. We have
two Trigonue, both very different from the existing forms ; but one
very similar to our Oolitic species, and a Plenrutomaria, which is a
Pahcozoic type ! Some of the Brachiopoda have faint secondary
affinities, but the Echinodermata are certainly not Mesozoic in
character. In all other respects our tertiary formations have
very close affinities with the tertiary rocks of Europe, and, indeed,
with the rest of the world ; while there is the same singular and
remarkable break between the secondary and tertiary periods that
is found to prevail everywhere. Imperfect and incomplete as the
geological record must necessarily bo when it is interrogated as to
evidence in favour of evolution from what it gives in Australia, it
must say decisively “in Australia I have none to give.”
In this lam not putting any interpretation on the evidence. I
am merely stating the fact. Whether another interpretation
against evolution could be given is a matter of individual opinion,
and I withhold my own. My researches in Australian tertiary
geology have now extended over twenty years, and during that
time, as I have helped somewhat to create its literature, I may say,
probably without arrogance, that I have as good an opportunity
of becoming acquainted with its paleontology as any one. It may
be, therefore, of some value to state that in all my examinations of
our fossil and living fauna I have carefully sought for any reasonable
evidence in favour of evolution or clue to its mode of operation,
and have found none —none whatever. I must add that Australian
geology, whether reluctantly or not, must admit that she can urge
nothing in favour of that theory being true, the true explanation of
nature as wo find it.
But in the supposition that in our land fauna and flora we have
a relic of secondary epoch, there is something not easy to reconcile
with the evolution hypothesis. Types remaining stationary during
such long periods of time appear, to my imperfect knowledge of
evolution, inconsistent with the necessary postulates. Possibly I
may misunderstand the question, but it must bo of use to point out
that the evidence of the submergence of Australia since the Mesozoic
period is somewhat cogent. Not only are relics of the Cainozoic
strata found at considerable distances from the sea, but the northern
as well as the southern portions of the continent are covered at inter-
vals with a deposit which some regard as marine and some as
lacustrine, but all agree in referring to the most recent of our
tertiary strata. It would be, therefore, a hasty conclusion to assert
that any part of the continent has been preserved as dry land since
the Mesozoic period, and the weight of evidence is against it.




FURTHER NOTES ON THE TERTIARY MARINE
BEDS OF TABLE CAPE.
BY R. M. JOHNSTON.
[Read 1 \th July, 1876.]
In a former paper upon tho above subject, I confined my
observations principally to the organisms themselves. Since
that time I have visited Table Cape, and, assisted by Mr.
T. E. Atkinson of this town, I have not only added to my col-
lection a large number of new species, but have by careful
investigation become possessed of important particulars which
may be of some value in determining the relative position of
this interesting deposit.
On approaching Wynyard from the sea, the eye is at first
arrested by a bold basaltic headland, rising from the water at
an angle of 45 degrees, to a height of about 500 feet. The
bold outline and the characteristic level summit at once sug-
gests the idea that the striking object before you must be the
well-known Table Cape. On a nearer approach, two smaller
rounded bluffs come into view, and are rendered conspicuous
by the contrast which their white precipitous cliffs present, as
compared with the wooded and sombre slopes of Table Cape
proper. The two smaller bluffs are isolated from each other
and from Table Cape by narrow valleys formed by erosion,
while the larger valley or basin by which the river finds its
course to the sea separates them from the little township of
Wynyard. Notwithstanding the gaps between the bluffs,
an ordinary observer can perceive at a glance that the strati-
fied beds of the smaller ones were at one time continuous,
and that the protecting cap of basalt at the same time spread in
one continuous sheet over all the adjacent ridges. On closer
examination it becomes evident that we have in these two
solitary bluffs a small fragment of that raised sea bottom
which, most probably, at a recent period connected Tasmania
with the continent of Australia. At any rate it is most con-
clusive that we have in these stratified beds myriads of
organisms which were during tho tertiary period inhabitants
of that vast shallow sea which then covered the greater part
of Australia and Tasmania and separated the remaining
portions into island groups.*
The bluff nearest to the township of Wynyard is about 160
feet high. The general strike is north and south, and the dip
inclines about 5 degrees in a north-westerly direction ; and at
this angle the beds disappear at sea level under the great
basaltic promontory of Table Cape. As the series of beds
* See the Eev. J. E. Tenison-Woods’ paper.


forming the deposit attains its greatest thickness in the bluff
nearest to the township, and as the same relative characters
are maintained at other places where the beds are exposed I
have chosen this point as the most suitable for illustrative
purposes. [The accompanying diagram will show the relative
extent and position of the various beds.]
Conceive, therefore, a white, beetling sea-cliff, whose base is
obscured by enormous blocks of sandstone which, by the cease-
less undermining action of the sea, have recently been dis-
lodged from the various ledges high overhead.
Those restless sea waves by which they were originally
formed are now at once engaged in their destruction, and in
re-arranging out of the same materials a very similar set of
sandstone beds in the quiet coves of the neighbourhood.
Thus we have the work of destruction and construction car-
ried on by the same agency, and although we may find in the
new arrangement a certain parallelism with the older forma-
tion ; yet there are differences at once striking and instruc-
tive. For example—while the particles of sand forming the
original rock have only been subjected to a little more tear
and wear, the included organisms are in every case wholly dis-
solved. It is true that the existing types of life which find a
home and a grave in the new formation may have secreted in
their tests the same elements which formerly entered into the
composition of the tests of the organisms of the older forma-
tion, but the forms themselves are very different in appear-
ance. Were the present sands consolidated and elevated into
a series of cliffs corresponding to those which now exist along
the shore, the most careful observation might fail to find any
organism having its exact counterpart in the older formation.
The characteristic shells—
Trigonia semi-undulata ; Pectunoulus laticostatus ; Oucullea
corioensis; C. cainozoica; Valuta anticingulata; V. weldi, etc.,
and the Polyzoa Cellepora gambierensis; O. nummularia ; C.
hemispheriea; C. spongiosa ; Salicornaria sinuosa. —Corals—
Plachotrochus deltoideus; P. elongatus, etc., etc., of the older for-
mation, are not found in the new formation, whilst the
characteristic shells of the latter— Trigonia margaratacea;
TValdheimia australis ; Venus roborata ; Phasianella australis ;
JVassa pauperata, liisella nana, etc., etc., are nowhere to be
found in the beds of the former.
I shall now give a brief description of the various rock di-
visions of the section given in the diagram, and in following a
downward order I shall offer such observations as may be
necessary to impart to the members of this Society; some
knowledge of the coraposit and relative extent of the various
beds and their included organisms. My work in this particular

is rendered comparatively easy by what is now being carried
on by the Rev. J. E. Tenison-Woods, in classifying and
describing the organisms themselves.
BASALTIC CAP (a.)
It is a singular feature connected with the older stratified
rocks that, where exposed as cliffs, they are invariably capped
with sheets of igneous rock. It would seem that where
the soft stratified bods were unprotected by a capping
of this sort they have been washed away entirely or eroded
into valleys of which Pingal Yalley may be taken as a type.
'1 his supposition would fully account for the vast districts of
elevated table lands in Tasmania, everywhere terminating in
precipitous bluffs. A corresponding feature on a smaller scale
may be seen in connection with the stratified beds of tertiary
age, of which the Table Cape beds form a striking example.
It is probable that the deposit which forms the main subject
of the paper would have been entirely wasted away long ere
this time had it not been that during a late volcanic period it
was covered with sheets of basalt and basaltic tuff. The bluff
already mentioned is covered by a cap of basalt and basaltic'
tuff about 80 feet in thickness. This cap, though shown in
diagram to be separate from corresponding caps in the neigh-
bourhood must have, prior to the erosion of the valleys, formed
with them one continuous sheet.
The basalt at the only place where a face is exposed is greatly
decomposed, and at first sight it might be inferred that the
basaltic capping might be the re-arranged detritus of a basalt
older than the rock which it now reposes upon. This infer-
ence is however extremely improbable, inasmuch as there is
not the slightest evidence to show that the cap has been the
result of the re-distribution of older material. It may be
remembered that in a former paper I described a similar cap
of basalt, overlying the beds of lignite at Breadalbane.
As they presented a superficial resemblance I determined
to subject them to analytical comparison, and for this pur-
pose I sent specimens of the rocks in question to Professor
Ulrich, of Melbourne, whoso labours in connection with the
rocks of Australia have obtained for him a wide-world
reputation. After making sections of the rocks, and sub-
jecting them to microscopic examination he thus writes with
reference to the Table Cape basalt:—“ The rock is somewhat
similar to some of our recent basalts here, viz., it is essen-
tially a feldspar basalt with very little augite ; lots of glass
and magnetic titaniferous iron, and rendered porphyritic by
abundant grains and crystals of olivine. It differs from the
basalt of Breadalbane by that the latter contains abundance
C


of augite in well developed crystals.” “ These mineral
differences are however no criterion of age ; for we have here
genuine miocene basalts which can, mineralogically, not be
distinguished from recent pliocene ones. If the feldspar were
replaced by Nephelene orLeucite throughout a basalt sheet, we
might perhaps be justified to declare the geological age, within
certain limits, different from that of an adjoining feldspar
basalt flow, but even in this instance great care is required,
especially if conclusions are to be drawn as to the age of
underlying rocks.” Happily we have now a more reliable
index to the age of the underlying rocks than may be ob-
tained from the comparative analysis of the constituents of
igneous rocks; it is, however, satisfactory that the learned
professor’s analysis tends to confirm the opinion which I
formerly entertained, viz., that the protecting cap overlying
the marine beds at Table Cape is a recent basalt, and very
slightly differs from a similar flow which overspreads the
lignites at Breadalbane.
In order to ascertain whether the intrusive rock, mentioned
by Mr. Allport in connection with the Travertin at Geilston
Bay, is of a similar character to the rocks at Breadalbane and
Table Cape, Professor Ulrich has, in a letter to me, kindly
volunteered to analyse any specimens from that quarter sent
to him. For this purpose, Mr. Allport, on being applied to,
at once procured and forwarded an interesting suite of speci-
mens. It will be of great value to have an established rela-
tionship with the various basaltic rocks in Tasmania and Vic-
toria. The rock known as the “ older volcanic ”in Victoria is
very similar to the rock at Table Cape, and, like it, the “ older
volcanic” frequently caps the marine beds considered to
belong to the miocene age.*
I regret that I could not find an accessible spot to ascertain
whether the sandstone, upper bed, was altered at point of
junction with the basalt or not. Perhaps some future ob-
server may be more fortunate in this respect.
TUEEITELLA GEOUP (5.)
Following the descending order we come upon the group of
beds which immediately underlie the basalt as already
described. The group has been named by me in the diagram
as the “ Turritella Group,” because the small shell, T.
ivarlurtonii (Tenison-Woods), so abounds through this
particular formation as to give it a character which would be
sufficiently distinctive when compared with the only other
* I have since been informed by Mr. Ulrich that the composition of the
intrusive rock at Geilston Hay is similar to that at Breadalbane and Table
Cape,


division of which the tertiary marine deposit at Table Cape Is
composed. The group is about 80 feet thick where fully ex-
posed, and consists of a series of beds of white or gray
calcareous sandstone, more or less firmly consolidated.
Although there are some of the beds in which scarcely any
other organism can be seen but the Turritella already referred
to; yet there are others in which organisms are extremely
varied and abundant.
There are also bands frequently occurring throughout the
group, some of them can be traced horizontally for about a
mile perhaps, in which Cellepora gambierensis (Busk) seems
to be particularly abundant.
So much does the latter organism appear to be abound in
these bands, that I am of opinion that it is owing to the
segregation of the carbonate of lime around this coral, that
the great relative hardness cf these bands is due.
The other forms which give a character to these curious
bands appear to be Echinodermata and Brachiopoda. Of six
distinct species sent to tho Eev. J. E. Tenison-Woods for
diagnosis,the form resembling Ilemipatagns woodsii (Etheridge)
(so called after the learned gentleman just referred to) seems,
to be the most abundant. Among the seven species of
Brachiopoda found, the most conspicuous is the fine shell,
Waldheimia gamhierensis (Tenison-Woods), also described from
specimens supplied by the Eev. J. E. T. Woods, from Mount
Gambier, South Australia. The most abundant, however, is
a species of Terebratula, resembling a large T. compta (Teri-
hratella tenisoni, Tenison-Woods).
In the less indurated sandstone beds, or between the bands
already described, I have discovered 15 or 16 species of Poly-
zoa and Corals among which I have been able to recognise
many of the Mount Gambier forms, described in “ Observa-
tions on the Geology of South Australia ” by the Eev. J. E.
Tenison-Woods, viz., Cellepora nummulina, G. spongiosa,
Salicornaria sinuosa, Placlwtrochus deltoides, P. elongatus ?
Flabellum victoriae ? F gambierense ? etc., etc.
As we approach the point of junction with the underlying
division wo come upon forms common to both divisions, and
only distinguished by relative abundance, among which I may
mention— Typhis M'Cogi (Tenison-Woods) ; Valuta anti-
cingulata (M‘Coy) ; Ancillaria mucronala (Sow) ; Natica
Wintlei (Tenison-Woods) ; Cucullea cainozoica ' (Tenison-
Woods) ; C. Corioensis (M'Coy) ; Pecfwnculus laticostatus
(M‘Coy) (Tenison-Woods) ; Nucula hmida, a small species of
Cardita; a small species of Myadora; and two species of
Pecten, one of them being an extremely minute species.
Altogether this group, presents a facies so similar to that
C 2


described by the Eev. J. E. Tenison-Woods, as belonging to
the limestone beds of Mount Gambier, that the description,
of the latter would almost suffice for the Turritella Group of
Table Cape, e.g., in page 75, Geo. So. Austral., the following
description of the Mount Gambier beds is given—“ It is here
seen that in addition to a distinct line of stratification, dividing
the rock into layers about fourteen feet thick, there are regular
zones where particular fossils are associated. Thus, at the
first bed (fourteen feet) little is seen but Bryozoa and
Terebratulae; in ten feet next, less of the moss corals, and
mere Pectens ; the next is almost exclusively composed of a
Pecten common to this formation with imbricated stria; called
Pecten coarctatus, and a cellopore coral subsequently to be
described ( 'G. gambierensis). This state of things is nearly
continued to the bottom, where Echini and Eeteporao combine
with the general mass.” Had the learned author added that
the small shell Turritella warburtonii was found in great
abundance throughout the mass I should have supposed
that he was giving an exact description of the Turritella
Group at Table Cape.
THE CEASSATELLA BED.
We come next to the lowest division of the marine deposit.
For itself as a rock it hardly deserves to be considered as
separate from the Turritella Group, which rests immediately
upon it, were it not for the fact that it appears to have been
accumulated under different circumstances. The nature and
relative abundance of the organisms contained in it also give
a character which though most probably brought about by
local circumstances is yet most peculiar and sufficiently dis-
tinctive. In making a distinction, therefore, between the
Turritella Group (b.) and the Crassatella Bed (c.), it is not to
be understood that the forms of the lower are nowhere to be
found in the higher, and vice versa. All that is meant by the
distinction is that the characteristic shells of the lower bed or
division suddenly diminish in quantity as we enter the higher
group and as we ascend even these gradually disappear.
We also observe that certain forms, especially Corallines
and Terebratulse, abundantly appear in the, upper beds in
bands, which were rarely seen or altogether absent from the
lower.
The Crassatella bed is extremely variable in thickness, for in
some places it attains a thickness of three and four feet, while
at other places it is reduced to a mere band of 3 and 4 inches
thick. Everywhere throughout, however, it preserves a
uniform character.
I have named it in this paper the Crassatella Bed, because


this organism belongs almost exclusively to it, and in some
places it is so abundant that it forms distinct layers. The bed
itself may be said to be composed of an irregular agglomera-
tion of shells bound up in a matrix of ferrugineous looking
mud.
This substance is very fine and soft, and seems to have a
wonderful preservative property, for many of the shells in-
vested by it have not only the fine enamel preserved but
in many cases the gelatinous epidermal membrane of a
species of Pecten (possibly P. coarctatus ?), as perfect as
though it still contained the living animal.
In this mud I have also found grit and rounded pebbles of
a yellowish quartz very abundant. The fine yellow muddy
substance is itself principally composed of the comminuted
remains of various species of foraminiferoc. Perfect forms of
the latter are, however, abundant, among which I have noticed
various species of Botalia, Marginulina, and Textularia. I
intend, at some future time, to study these microscopic forms
more carefully.
Although the exposed face of this shelly rock is extremely
hard, yet when masses of the rock are detached they are
found to be extremely friable, and with ordinary care the
most delicate shells may be easily extracted. Unfortunately
many of the latter are already so fractured in the rock that
when separated from the matrix they fall to pieces. There
are numerous small caves hollowed out of this rock by the
waves of the sea at high tide —along the Sandstone Cave, and
it is from the roof of some of these caves that some of the
most interesting species of shells have been obtained. The
greater number of species have also been obtained from this
bed. As their number is so large I have prepared a complete
list in a tabular form in another place.* It is only necessary
to state here the names of those species, which from their
extraordinary size and abundance, give a distinctive character
to this small but interesting division, viz.—
*Typhis m'coyi (Woods).
Cyprea platypyga (M'Coy) Murex eyrei, Fusus roblini.
*Spondylus.

It is also important to notice the occurrence of fossil wood
greatly decomposed in this deposit, and occasionally the teeth
of two species of shark which had a world-wide distribution
during the tertiary period, viz., Lanina elegans, Gharcharodon
angustidens (Ag.Jf
Of the latter Professor McCoy writes :—“ The present
species, even as originally restricted by Agassiz, is one of the
most abundant and characteristic miocene tertiary fossils of
every part of Europe and America in which strata of this age
exist, and I recognised it amongst the Australian beds to
which I assigned miocene and oligocene with great astonish-
ment, from this evidence of its world-wide distribution in the
tertiary period.”
CONGLOMERATE (d.), AND SLATE (c.)
The rock forming the floor upon which the marine deposit
at Table Cape has been thrown down is a highly indurated
conglomerate. It presents a very irregular outline, and forms

all the numerous dangerous reefs between Table Cape and
Emu Bay.
I am of opinion that this is the same conglomerate which
crops out on the Dial Mange, and which is assigned by Mr.
Gould to Silurian age. It is composed of highly altered
water-worn pebbles derived from various ancient rocks. Some
of them are derived from a dark crystalline limestone, which
appears to be non-fossiliferous.
One remarkable block, however, was, so far as I could learn,
picked out of this conglomerate by Mr. James Smith, of West-
wood, Forth. It is highly fossiliferous, the prevailing form,
as shown In various sections, is undoubtedly a species of
Brachiopod. I have not sufficiently studied this rock. I
have observed, however, that it has been greatly subjected to
denudation, and that it rests, so far as I could see, uncon-
formably upon a more or less inclined slate rock.
GENERAL.
I have thus referred as briefly as possible to the vertical
distribution of the organisms contained in the tertiary marine
beds at Table Cape. It is of the utmost importance, prior,to
establishing any relations with similar isolated deposits else-
where in Tasmania, Flinders Island, or the continent of Aus-
tralia* that each isolated bed or series of beds should be fully
investigated, especially as regards the extent and distribution
of its organic contents.
While I do not deny that reasonable inference or conjecture,
so long as it is recognised as provisional, is most useful in
stimulating enquiry and helps to make interesting what would
otherwise be a chaos of isolated observations, yet as the ten-
dency to create minor subdivisions with reference to distant
European beds, is in many instances too apparent, it may be
the means of introducing much error into our classification.
Among recent geological authorities of eminence, perhaps,
no one has drawn more particular attention to this source of
error than the late respected Mr. Jukes.
In connection with chronological observation he thus writes
(p. 409, manual). “In order to avoid error each great dis-
trict of the earth, such as Europe or North America should be
surveyed separately, without reference to anything out of the
district, and that the order of superposition of its strata and
their classification into groups or formations, sholildbe settled
independently on evidence to be found in the district only.
When this has been done the two series may be compared,and
the synchronism of different parts of each may be decided on.”
If such care be necessary in the determination of the great

classes themselves, it is surely more necessary to be careful in
our classification of the isolated beds of a system into sub-
divisions, when we take into consideration the horizontal dis-
tribution of organisms as affected by migration of colonies,
physicial barriers and local influences.
As an example of classification which might ignore the
effect of migration of species, it is interesting to notice that
although the shell Pectunculus laticostatus (Lamarck)* so abun-
dant in the lower shell bed at Table Cape, is not now found
living near the shores of Australia or Tasmania, it still exists
in abundance on the coast of the distant colony of New Zea-
land. It is possible that this shell had a wider distribution
during the tertiary period; but if there be evidence to the
contrary, it is probable that change of circumstances have
caused the species to migrate from its original centre, and
that the great distance of our coast from the shores of New
Zealand, represent horizontally or in space, the long
duration of time necessary for the slow migratory progress
of such an organism.
Take again the following instance :
In the Turritellaf limestone of Flinders Island, there
occurs three species of shells also common to Table Cape
deposit; one of them being the shell so abundant at the latter
place. Gucullea cainozoica (Tenison-Woods.) Had an observer
only reported the discovery of these three forms, without
reference to their abundance or associated organisms, it would
be a reasonable enough inference, so far as evidence went,
that they belonged to the same sub-division. But as I have
fuller evidence which informs me that, with the exception of
the-organisms already referred to, the characteristic shells of
Flinders Island, though there very numerous, had never been
, detected in the beds of Table Cape. This knowledge, taken
in conjunction with the consideration that the latter beds
have now been very fully investigated, is sufficient to postpone
the final co-relation of these deposits until the other isolated
formations, of a similar character, afford some additional clue
to their exact position.
As an example of local distribution in the same bed at
Table Cape, I noticed, especially that Cylichna araclds (Quoy)
though very common at one particular point, could be found
nowhere else in the same horizon or indeed anywhere else.
This is another important consideration when comparisons
* At Table Capo this shell has invariably 29 radial ribs, not 39 as figured
and described by Prof. McCoy in the Victorian Decades.
t A very different species to that which characterises the Turritella group
at Table Cape.


are sought to be made with various isolated deposits widely
separated.
Generally, horizontal extension of a particular species from
its orignal centre may represent a period of time during
which vast deposits may have accumulated, vertically, on the
original habitat, where each succeeding layer, perhaps, shewed
a gradual extinction of the older forms, and the introduction
of a new class of organisms. Thus, for example, could we
depress the present group of tertiary beds at Table Cape so
that the marine beds now in process of formation rested
conformably upon them; a vertical section would show such
a complete change in the character of the various beds as to
justify jthe local geologist in sub-dividing his section into
separate groups with, locally speaking, well marked characters.
At the same time could we follow the horizontal movement of
organisms as they gradually disappeared from the original
centre, we would yet find in a very far distant part of the
earth’s surface, that amid all the vicissitudes of migratory
change, a few persistent forms of the lowest stratum of the
original centre would still be found to be the true contem-
poraries of those new forms which gave a complete change of_
character to the upper beds.
It follows from considerations of this nature that the exist-
ence of a few specific forms common to two or more widely
separated deposits, is, in itself, no guarantee that they belong
to the same subdivision of a great class ; or even to the great
class division itself.
Such being the case we should accept with the greatest
caution the subdivisions of the various widely separated
tertiary marine deposits of Victoria into Oligocene, Miocene,
and Pliocene, until we know more fully the extent and quality
of the evidence which forms the basis of their classification.
It also follows that until we have worked up independently
and fully each deposit of the tertiary period, and also com-
pared them with a fully worked up list of existing forms in
the same neighbourhood, any attempt at classification will be
premature and misleading.
Being deeply impressed with the importance of such con-
siderations I have most carefully gone into the investigation of
our Table Cape marine deposit, and I have been rewarded
in the discovery of the remains of at least 150 distinct specific
organisms. When the great number of new species are
described and classified by the Rev. J. E. Tenison-Woods, to
whom science in Tasmania is already so deeply indebted, we
shall then be in a better position to compare with similar
deposits elsewhere and with the existing forms in our own
neighbourhood. But it is not enough to have our own
D


deposits worked up with care. It will be useless to make com-
parisons with the deposits of Victoria or New South Wales
without the co-operation of the naturalists and geologists of
Australia generally.
This might be most effectually brought about by appeals to
the various learned societies in Australia and New Zealand to
make exchanges with us and to send catalogues of their classi-
fied fossils, with descriptions of habitat and distribution.
For this object I have arranged the marine fossils at Table
Cape into a tabular form, which not only shows at a glance
the distribution, so far as known, throughout the Australian
deposits, but also, by signs, is made to show the relative
abundance of each particular organism. Were the various
learned societies to aid in classifying their fossils in a similar
way, we would then be able to dispel all doubts with regard to
the present classification. Co-operation, therefore, is at the
present time of the utmost necessity, and I trust that the
members of the Eoyal Society of Tasmania will take the
initiative in a work so desirable and of such importance.

NOTES ON THE FOSSILS REFERRED TO IN
THE FOREGOING PAPER.
BY THE REV. J. E. TENISON-WOODS, F.G.S., &c.
[Read Wth July, 1876.]
Since I last described some of tbe Table Cape fossils
existing in the Museum of the Royal Society the collection
has been very much enlarged, owing to the indefatigable
exertions of the author of the preceding paper, Mr. R. M.
Johnston. From this collection I have been enabled to
determine upwards of eighty new species, the greater part
of which are new to science. About ten per cent, of these
are still existing, some few in the same seas, some in the
Northern Hemisphere, in subtropical regions or in Euro-
pean seas. Knowing as we do now, from deep sea dredging
the wide diffusion of species until recently regarded as local,
we must not be surprised at the result, nor should we be
surprised if a still larger number of our living shells are
found common to European seas and our own. Ten per
cent, can hardly be finally regarded as the proportion of
surviving forms, because our knowledge of the existing
fauna is so imperfect. Some of the fossil shells I never
saw living until very lately, and should have described
them as extinct had not living specimens been recently dis-
covered. Such instances are, however, like the species
themselves—extremely rare. Natica polita and Fissurella
concatenata are cases in point. They had been described
there as extinct and only very recently discovered living
specimens. Trivia europea and Eulimella subulata are
European forms, which I believe occur at Table Cape as
fossils.
I have already described the nature of the formation. I
may add that it is evidently a deposit belonging to the
Larainarian zone. This I gather from the entire absence
of truly littoral shells, and the presence in abundance of
Rissoidse, etc., which feed on sea weed at depths, of from
eighty to one hundred fathoms. Foraminifera are
numerous and indicative of the same depths as well as
corals among which are true reef builders, Heliastreea tas•
maniensis, Duncan ; Thamnastrcea iasmaniensis, Dunc. ;
and T. sera. Dunc., which are rather abundant. They
are the only ones hitherto found in the Australian
tertiaries. I have been able to determine a new Placo-
D a


trochus, and a very peculiarly branched Dendrophylla.
The Brachiopoda are abundant, and tend to confirm
the evidence of the depth at which these beds were
deposited. Several new species are under the considera-
tion of Mr. Thomas Davidson —our greatest living
authority—and, doubtless, will soon be described.
The Echinodermata are numerous and present some new
forms. They are all considerably distorted by pressure.
Nothing, however, of very great novelty has hitherto been
found, and all the species bear the strongest resemblance
to those of the Malta Miocene.
Polyzoa are scarce, and in this respect the Table Cape
beds present a remarkable contrast to those of a similar
horizon in Australia. This is accounted for by the nature
of the beds which arc composed of a levigated mud,
mingled with coarse pebbles of quartz and feldspar, and all
highly ferruginous. They were either derived from the
detritus of submarine craters, or the wearing down of
volcanic rocks in a sea, not tranquil, but containing strong
oceanic currents These conditions are very unfavourable
to the growth of polyzoa.
Though some of the shells, as far as yet known, arc
peculiar to the Table Cape beds, and many of the corals;
yet the majority of the fossils are identical with those of
the Australian so-called Miocene and undoubtedly be-
longing to the same sea. To show what differences have
arisen since the period, I may mention that there is a
much closer resemblance between the fossils of Table 'Cape
and those of Southern Australia, than there is between the
shells found upon the same coasts now, that is to say, that
the two places had more species in common formerly than
than they have now, and, though of course the differences
even now are not very great, yet they are more evident
than they were. It should be remarked, however, that
now the existing shells for comparison are littoral, but then
they were a continuous deep sea, and whereas we know the
littoral species, we do not know the deeper sea ones.
It is certain that as we go back in geological periods we
find a greater similarity extending over wide spread areas,
until in the early formations, where absolute identity is the
rule in the most remote parts of the earth’s surface. Thus
the Devonian fossils of Tasmania are, with few exceptions,
specifically identical with those of Europe. Professor


McCoy has pointed out another curious fact in our Aus-
tralian palaeontology, which is, that though in our early
tertiary formations we have little specific identity with
European fossils, yet we have shells in some instances so
closely resembling them as to be mimetic, and no more than
just specifically distinct. As far •as my examinations go
this I find to be rather the exception than the rule, and in
most cases I looked in vain for even a general resemblance
between our fossils and those which may be presumed to
be of the same horizon in Europe.
The following are the new species brought to light by
Mr.Tohnston. Note.—All dimensions in French milli-
metres.
Mukex eteei. n. s. Shell fusiformly ovate with a rather
depressed spire, laraellose and spiny, last whorl three-fourths
the whole length of shell, sharply ungulate rather above the
middle and furnished with eight thick lamellose frilled varices
which at the angle become projected into blunt hollow short
somewhat recurved spines. About the fourth from the aperture
the varices lose their lamellose character, and become lirate ribs,
still preserving the spines at the angle, above which the shell
slopes upwards to the suture at a slight inclination on which
the varices are represented by smooth lamellar raised lines;
the spiral whorls, four in number, have the angle spinous, and
but little raised above the suture; apex obtuse; aperture
ovate ; outer lip produced at the angle and terminating an-
teriorly in a long straight canal; inner lip reflected with a
conspicuously raised ibliaceous rib, spirally sloping to the
siphonal aperture. Long. 48, lat. 32. Last whorl from
posterior margin of mouth, 34 ; length of canal, 17.
Cassis sufflatus. n.s. Shell thin, shining, globosely in-
flated with simple or subplicato whorls, spire short almost acute;
whorls G, 2| apical, naticifonn, three next distinctly cancellate
with a fine subnodoso carina above ; last angulate below the
suture, between which and the angle there is a shallow broad
finely bimargined groove ; below this the shell is somewhat
finely and indistinctly tuberculate and ribbed, the ribs showing
a faint lower band of tubercles near the middle of the whorl,
below this the shell is smooth or very finely striate; aper-
ture auriform, outer lip reflexed, rounded, thickened and much
produced anteriorly ; inner, a mere enamelling above and pass-
ing as a thin septum over the round abruptly twisted,
short siphonal canal, causing a'broad spiral groove like an
umbilicus to pass behind the labio. Long. 37, lat; 23.
Long, apert, 26, lat 12, mil.
Though very distinct there is an approach to the Australian


types 0. paucirugis and C. semigranosa, which are now found
on our coasts.
Pusus tate an a. n. s. Shell ovately fusiform with the
apex curved, and a rather long, narrow, straight canal; whorls
8, roundly convex, smooth, the upper and obliquely curved ones
obscurely tubercled, and all more or less marked with flexuous,
slightly raised lines of growth; suture well defined but not deep,
rather sloping; aperture regularly elliptic, smooth,outer lip thin
and roundly curved into the anterior canal, which is narrow
and straight; base slightly concave. Length, 81; lat., 35 ;
aperture, 30, anterior canal, 20, but often broken and
evidently continued at least 5 mil. further where its width
would be scarcely 5 mil. Common.
The constantly curved apex, the slightly tubercled spire
while the rest of the shell is so conspicuously smooth renders
this form peculiar and distinct. Among living Australian forms
there is nothing at all likeit, while with the fossil tertiaryspecies
of Europe its analogies are remote. I have great pleasure in
dedicating the species to Professor Tate, of the Adelaide
University, who has done such, service to molluscan science
by his numerous conchological works, but especially in the
revised edition of “ Woodward’s Manual,”
Pusus teansenna. n. s. I name this shell provisionally as
the only specimen sent to mo has the apex and lip broken. It
is ovately fusiform with sharp spire, and scarcely rounded
whorls, which are completely, equally, rather distinctly latticed,
with transverse and spiral lirse, which are subnodose at the
intersection, there are about 24 longitudinal ones in the
body whorls, but this number is uncertain, as they become
confused to some extent with the striae of growth, and there are
10 spiral ones on the body whorl reckoned at the back of the
columella. The body whorl is also subangulate above, and
there concave to the suture, which is rendered almost mar-
ginate by small granulations at the end of the lirse. The
outer lip appears to be thin, the columella slightly twisted,
the aperture oval, with a long sub-oblique posterior sub-
recurved canal. Long. 22, lat. 11, aperture with canal, 12,
lat. 4.
Pusus johnstonii. n. s. Shell very small, narrowly
fusiform, apex smooth, elongate, of two whorls, the upper being
the most swollen ; whorls 7, very convex in the' middle with
8-9 very prominent broad rounded ribs ; conspicuously marked,
with very numerous spiral lirce which alternate, large and
small, and pass over the ribs; longitudinally finely striated
but not so conspicuously as Urate, so that the whorls could
scarcely be called cancellate, suture deeply impressed, aperture
narrowly ovate, canal prolonged, outer lip thin, columella


simple, with the lip slightly enamelled, and the lirae descend-
ing obliquely from behind it. Long. 8, lat. scarcely 3 mill.
A form slightly aproaching F. Swartzii, Hornes, of the
Vienna basin, but in that species the canal is recurved, and
the lirae sub-squamate.
Voluta m‘coyi. n. s. Shell narrowly ovate, thin,
smooth, shining, with a small obtuse naticiform apex;
whorls slightly convex and, oblique with no other marks than
the lines of growth, aperture l-3rd larger than the spire, acute
posteriorly and gradually widening to the anterior notch,
which is broad and scarcely recurved, columella with four
high oblique p aits. Long. 30, lat. 11, aperture long. 18,
lat. 5.-
Tekebea additoides. n. s. Shell very acute—lanceo-
lately turretted, somewhat solid, closely longitudinally ribbed
and finely transversely striate, ribs rounded, ivory like and
smooth, interrupted above by a rather broad shallow groove
in which they are slightly deflected, but not entirely obliter-
ated, above becoming almost nodular; interstices broad,
slightly concave, shining, equally and closely striate, which
disappears on the ribs, suture sharply and deeply impressed;
whorls 13, ribs nodular in 7th to 11th, two spiral whorls,
rugose only ; apex decollate ; mouth ovate, almost channelled
near suture; inner lip reflected over columella, which is
twisted into four to six rugose folds, sloping down to the
siphonal notch. Long. 24, lat. 5.
In this fossil the groove on the ribs and general form brings
it near to the Tasmanian T. addita and T. kieneri, but the
whorls are closer and more numerous. It has a general re-
semblance to the Australian members of the genus. It is
very close to certain European miocene forms, notably T
pertusa Bast., and T. basteroti Nyst (formerly called T. dupli-
catei by Brocchi, by mistake identified with Linne’s shell of
that name), but from these it differs in being a smaller nar-
rower shell, and in the ribs being more numerous and finer.
Astralium (Calcar) elindersu. n. s. Shell solid, tro-
chiform, not umbilicated, spire somewhat elevated, granular
and spiny; whorls six, furnished at the base with lamellar
imbricated folds in the form of short spines, above which are
five spiral unequal lines of round granulations, the uppermost
of which are the largest; last whorl angular ; suture a broad
and deep groove with a line of granulations within ; aperture
subcircular; columella flattened and concave ; outer lip angled
and channelled at the base ; base flat with many spiral gran-
ular or imbricated lirae. Alt. 17, diameter 13 mil. The short
spines and the coarsely granular lirae easly distinguish this
species.


Astealium (Calcae) oenatissimum. Shell very solid,
rounded obliquely, and globosely conical, whorls five, rounded
and ornamented below with a marginal rib of close granula-
tions ; above this a very fine line of granules, above this a pro-
jecting conspicuous spiral line of lamellar imbricating
spinous folds, and crowned above by a spiral line of coarse
round nodules ; aperture circular, outer lip with an exterior
angle and canal; columella curved, scarcely flattened; base
concave above with four spiral granular ribs. Alt. 17,
diam. 13.
Delphinula teteagonostoma. n.s. Shell small, obliquely
turbinate, latticed, whorls four, swollen, with three keels and
8-9 spiral line, which are United to each other by small close
diagonal riblets, making complete lattice-work all over the
test; apex obtuse, depressed; aperture round, outer lip
quadrangulate, with a distinct channel at eaeh angle ; inner
lip reflected over the umbilicus, on the outside of which is a
salient conspicuous marginal rib which joins the aperture at
the anterior angle ; base convex and latticed. Long. 2 ; lat.
3- mil.
This very small Delphinula has some relation with our
latticed Tasmanian Liotias, but is very distinct in every other
way.
Zizyphinus blaxlandii. n.s. Shell small, conical, stained
purplish in colour, spirally ribbed and transversely diagonally
finely striate ; whorls 7, flattened above and surmounted by
a broad canaliculate spiral groove, which is diagonally finely
striate; spiral ribs, four on each whorl, and separated from
each other by equal grooves, which have 3-4 spiral line and
diagonal striae; penultimate whorls very finely coronate
above with almost imperceptible elevation of the margin,
these become more distinct on the next whorl above, and then
are regular granulations on the two next; the two apical
whorls are smooth ; on the penultimate whorl and base the
transverse striae are raised, but faint, with a tendency to be
in pairs; on the antipenultimate they are wrinkled and dis-
tinct ; mouth sub-quadrate; outer lip thin ; columella with a
faint umbilicus behind, margined by a thick spiral rib. Long.
5, lat. 4, mil. Named after one of the first explorers who
crossed the blue mountains. This fossil is not allied to any
existing species in these seas, though slightly resembling a
Philippine form.
Liotia lamellosa. n. s. Shell small, orbicular, sub-
discoid, apex flattened, and depressed, four to five longitu-
dinal keels, which are not very prominent, and equally, dis-
tinctly lamellosely costate with overlapping undulating ribs,
between which the whole shell is closely and finely striate,


umbilicus broad, deep, and finely crenulated by the endings
of the lamellae, aperture round, with a thin varix. Diam.,
3 mill.
This form which, though decidedly similar to many Aus-
tralian forms, is distinct from any yet described. Quite recently
I have seen in the collection of Mr. W. R Petterd, a specimen
dredged from the Tasmanian coast, so that the species is stbl
living.
. Maegaeita kekwickii. n.s. Shell small, thin, broadly
globosely conical, deeply umbilicate ; spirally lirate and shin-
ing ; whorls seven, rapidly decreasing in size, rounded and
equally spirally lirate with alternating large and small fine
line, the larger ones sharp, and the lowest projecting a little,
forming a groove over the suture, the smaller microscopic, and
not visible above the basal and penultimate whorl; aperture
round, peristome almost meeting on base, outer lip thin;
columella curved and thin, umbilicus acutely margined and
with curved ribs at right angles to spiral lira. Long, and
lat. 5. Named after my late friend the overseer of Stuart,
the great explorer, who accompanied him on all his expedi-
tions, and was one of the most courageous and indefatigable
of his followers. The fossil has no known living congener
in Tasmania.
Teochtjs josephi. n. s. Shell very small, broadly pyram-
idal with a small, smooth, white, rounded apex of 1| whorls ;
spire conspicuously latticed ; whorls 6-7, with three conspicu-
ously keels, the lowest projecting much over the suture ; keels
closely latticed regularly by somewhat broader sub-distant
sloping ribs which seem to pass under the keels, and to cause
them to become nodular as the point of intersection, in addi-
tion the whole shell is very finely striate; base flat, with
numerous spiral alternating lira; aperture subquadrate, simple,
entire. Long. 3, width of base, 2.
Thalotia alteenata. n. s. Shell turbinately conical,
spire elevated, acute ; whorls six, very slightly convex, granu-
losely ribbed; on the last whorl the spiral ribs are twelve in
number, three conspicuous and largely granulose, and the rest
with small sometimes sharp edged grains or reduced to fine
lines; they are disposed thus—each granulose rib has fine lira
at each side of it, and the large and sma'l ribs alternate;
suture inconspicuous, base convex, rounded at the* periphery,
with spiral granulose ribs and fine lira regularly alternating;
aperture obliquely quadrate, nacreous, outer lip thin, smooth
inside; columella s ightly twisted with an obsolete tubercle
at the base. Lon. 12, lat. 10.
Not like any of our existing Thalotias.
Solaeium (Toeinia) gibbuloides. n. s. Shell thick, sub


turbinate, rugose, spire somewhat elevated; whorls 4-5
angulated tuberculately coronate above and conspicuously
keeled, keel thin, finely granular with irregular lines of rather
larger granules above it; apex smooth, and turbinate for 1|
whorls, base very much produced by the spiral, sharp, smooth,
edge of the umbilicus, and handsomely ornamented with
spiral granular lines, and undulating subsquamose stria;, which
are a'so found above the carina and between the granules on
the body whorl; aperture orbicular, outer lip produced and
everted posteriorly, and narrowed into a fine short canal,
anteriorly, inner lip acute, curved, umbilicus, keeled in the
centre, very concave, and distinctly undulately striate. Diatn.
8, a't. 7.
This form which departs in many respects from the typical
Solarium has some affinity to S. iurlinoides, Nyst, and S.
trochiforme, Desh. of the French and English Eocene deposits.
Gxbbula. ceassigeasosa, n. s. Shell solid, thick, rugose,
turbinately conical, apex obtuse, depressed, smooth, whorls
5-6, coronate with slightly oblique rounded ribs, extending to
a sharp granulose carina, in the middle, below they have a
conspicuous spiral groove to the suture on which is a line of
very fine granules ; base sharply angular, slightly convex with
spiral lines of fine and coarse granules; aperture, orbicular,
nacreous, columella produced into an anterior angle. Long. 14,
Lat 11. Young specimens have numerous oblique longitu-
dinal lines of growth, and are umbilicated. At the dimensions
given there are about 16 costae on the last whorl.
Qibbtjla ;equisulcata. n. s. Shell orbiculately turbi-
nate, sub-depressed, thick, apex acute ; whorls 5-6, rapidly but
regularly increasing, rounded, spirally finely regularly grooved,
and very closely lirato and regularly cancellate with extremely
fine diagonal striae; aperture orbicular, smooth, outer lip
finely crenulate, inner lip arcuate with slight anterior angle ;
deeply narrowly perspectively umbilicate ; periphery rounded,
base convex, marked like the whorls. Diam. 12, alt. 9, Lat.
of apert. 6. Rare. The carina; between the grooves are
sharp and very distinct from the much finer lira; with which
the whole shell is marked, on the last whorl where they are
crossed by the diagonal strise they become granular.
Except that this is a more depressed and smaller shell, it
has considerable affinity with Trochus patulus, Bron. of the
Vienna Miocene. The description, however, as given by Nyst.
Coq. Foss. p. 383, makes this a more angular shell in Belgian
formations.
Turbo etheridgei. n.s. Shell turbinately conical, solid,
granular, grooved, spire rather elevated and acute, whorls
6-7, convex, conspicuously carinated with 5-7 elevated sub


distant, largely granular spiral ridges, interstices closely,
finely, but very distinctly, obliquely striated with striae which
pass over the ridges and sometimes even over the raised
rounded often polished granulations; aperture orbicular,
nacreous and smooth; columella simple, not tuberculate, base
convex and spirally granular. Sometimes the interstices be-
tween the ribs have a fine, sharp raised keel in the midst.
Long. 17, Lat. 12|. Common, but nearly always broken.
I have dedicated this shell to Mr. Robert Etheridge, jun.,
P.G.S., a distinguished palaeontologist and geologist, formerly
connected with the Victorian Geological Survey.
Syemola bifasciata. Tenison Woods; This species which
is described by me in last year’s Transactions of the Society
has been forwarded by Mr. Johnston as found fossil at Table
Cape.
Tueeixella waebtjetonii. n. s. Shell small, shining,
narrowly pyramidal, spirally ribbed and (microscopically)
transversely closely undulatelj' striate, two smooth conspicuous
ribs at the lower part of each whorl, with others very fine and
of varying size above ; whorls 8-10, flattened, slightly swollen-
above ; suture narrow and deeply depressed, apex always
decollated, base flattened, almost concave,with 8-10 fine spiral
ribs which alternate large and small, outer lip thin, inner lip
not reflected, mouth quadrate, columella simple. Long. 6,
Lat. 2.
I have marked the difference between this and the preced-
ing species in italics. In addition it is a much smaller shell.
Table Cape. Common.
Tueeixella sttjetii. n.s. Shell small, acutely pyramidal,
spirally granulosely ribbed; ribs 7-8 in each whorl, three con-
spicuous and prominent, the others intermediate, small non-
granulose, and of varying size. Whorls ten, constricted at the
suture which is deeply impressed. ■ Base flattened with 7-8
spiral equal sized ribs, covered with numerous very fine
transverse stria; mouth subquadrate, outer lip thin, inner
lip much reflected over the base, columella simple, and
slightly reflected at the base. The three prominent ribs on
the whorls are all granular, the larger two at the base of the
whorl, and the third above and separated by a wide interval
in which the smaller ribs occur. Granules on lowest prominent
rib separated from each other by oblique grooving, and below
this rib a deep channel above the suture; apex always
decollated. Long. 12, lat. 4 mil.
This fossil is of a type common enough in the genus, which
may be said to vary in individuals by the disposition of the
three prominent ribs. It has remote resemblance to some living
Australian species. Its small size and remarkable granula


lions distinguish it. Very common at Table Cape, and in the
Australian Lower Cainozoic, Muddy Creek, Corio Bay, etc. In
the Museum there is a large block of yellow calcareous sand-
stone from Table Cape, principally composed of this fossil, with
an almost complete skeleton of a small marsupial herbivore
imbedded. (Macropus or Helmaturus ?)
Tenaoodus occlusus. n.s. Shell loosely twisted, the
three apical whorls in contact, the fourth slightly detached,and
sloping, the last largely unfolding, making a loose turn two
and a half times the length of the remainder; whorls solid,
wrinkled or detaching upper shelly coat in flakes, underneath
which it is still thick, cracked, smooth, and somewhat polished,
rounded below but narrowing and almost angular at the cleft,
which is a smooth slit without punctures closed for its whole
length, and evidently almost filled up by lamellar calcareous
matter down to the aperture where it is little more than a
shallow notch, pyriform and projecting below, apex disciform,
apical whorl vermiform and fine pointed. Length, 56 lat.,
aperture 8 mil.
The absence of foramina and the almost closed slit dis-
tinguish this from all known Australian forms. The cleft is
much more narrow and inconspicuous than the size of the
shell would lead one to suspect, and its being reduced to a
notch in the aperture. It is supposed that the slit is left
open for the purpose of bathing the gill which lines the left
side of the mantle, which, in this animal, is divided. It
cannot, however, be so necessary where the aperture slopes
forward from the notch. The slit is not, in this case, entirely
closed, for the tube, when broken below it, separates at once
at the fissure, and shows a fine delicate edge at the point of
junction.
Yebmetus conohelix. n. s. Tube adhering, corrugated,
coiled, lower whorls, laterally depressed into a ridge and
coiled upon each other with a truncated flattened hollow
cone of two whorls, at the apex the tube becomes free,
obliquely erect, flexuous and cylindrical, aperture somewhat
thick and orbicular. Height of cone, 3 ; breadth, 6 ; length of
free end, 5 ; aperture, 1, mill. wide.
I am unacquainted with any form like this either in Aus-
tralian seas or elsewhere, as far as I can gather from 0.
Morch’s extensive lists.
Eissoa stevexsiana. n.s. Shell minute, narrowly pyram-
idal, nucleus somewhat suddenly contracted of two smooth
turbinate whorls, spire slightly tumid in the middle ; whorls
ten, angular or sub-carinate in the middle, coarsely costate,
from 12-16 ribs on each whorl, and finely but indistinctly lirate,
ribs rounded, not much elevated and continuous from suture


to suture, tlio latter very deeply impressed so as to give the
whorls a rounded swollen aspect; base almost flat, aperture
pyriform entire, l/sth length of shell; columella simple.
Long. 3, Lat. 1 mil.
Eissoina vaeicifeea. ii.s. Shell minute, smooth shining,
tumid, apex somewhat contracted, of two whorls, smooth, and
was previously whiter than the spire ; ’whorls 6-7, flattened,
but rounded above, suture deeply impressed, aperture rounded,
much smaller than penultimate whorl, outer lip slightly pro-
duced, inner lip reflected over the base, generally a continuous
line of swollen conspicuous varices on the columella side of
the whole shell. Long. 3, Lat. scarcely one mill,, but this is
the largest size.
A form approaching somewhat the H. costulata, Grat. of the
European tertiaries, but smaller and with a rounded con-
tracted aperture. The varices are not always visible. I
believe this form still exists in Tasmanian seas.
Eissoina johnstoni. n.s. Shell minute, rather broadly
pyramidal turretted, apex smooth, white, shining, of two
smooth turbinated whorls ; spire 2| length of aperture ;
whorls 9-IC, sloping, rather convex, obtusely carinated in the-
middle, more or less longitudinally plicate, with 6-12 ribs
(which are in some specimens very faint, and others almost
varicose) and spirally Urate with 6-8 valid line, which often
alternate in size ; suture well impressed; aperture suborbicular
outer lip somewhat produced, thin ; column slightly twisted,
and everted below ; base concave and spirally Urate. Long.
31f, Lat. I|.
Very common. In this species the ribs do not follow each
other in a regular series, but seem rather to alternate, those of
each succeeding whorl rising from the interstices between the
ribs of the ones below. It has no living representative in
Australia. Its Bittium-like form distinguishes it from any
other species known to me.
Ttjbbonilla pagoda, n.s Shell minute, narrowly pyra-
midal, apex a swollen elongated kind of pullus of two smooth
whorls, spire flattened turriculate, whorls 9, rising in stages or
slightly overlapping; ribs 12-16 rounded, raised, in a con-
tinuous sloping series, broader than the interstices; no visible
transverse markings, base smooth, slightly convex, aperture
oblong, squared above, rounded below, columellp, twisted.
Long. 4. 1 ;. Lat. 1 mil.
In this genus determinate characters are not easily speci-
fied. The above fossil may, perhaps, be best distinguished by
its size, sloping ribs, smooth base, twisted columella, and the
whorls rising in stages.
Tuebonilla lietkcostata. n.s. Shell elongate, narrowly


pyramidal, nucleus of two smooth turns, apex blunt,
whorls (without nucleus) 8, flattened, with 20-24 straight
round ribs which continue unaltered (though some-
times slightly flexucus) from suture to suture ; interstices not
so wide as the ribs, and very closely spirally grooved, which
sometimes pass over the ribs; base roundly convex and
spirally lirate, suture submarginate, aperture broadly ovate,
outer lip thin, columella slightly arched, canal short, very
slightly recurved. Long. s|, Lat. 1)-.
Eulimella subulata. Donovan. (Nat. Hist. Brit. Shells,
vol. 5, t. 173—1799 as Turbo.) This shell, which is very fully
described and figured by Hornes, Nyst, Wood, and others, as
Eulima, would come under Prof. Forbes genus of Eulimella.
It has received a host of names during the last 77 years of its
scientific life. I can see no difference whatever between the
specimens found at Table Cape and those found existing in
the British seas. It is extensively known as European
Miocene and Pliocene fossil. Not common. Two specimens
forwarded by E. M. Johnston, one by Stephens, many
found by myself at Muddy Creek, Victoria, Mordialloc, etc.
It has not yet been found living in Australia, unless some
only closely allied forms of Eulima should be identified with it.
Action sceobiculatus. n.s. Shell oblong, ovate, solid,
apex acute, smooth only at the extreme summit, whorls 7,
cancellate with very distinct spiral lirse, muchfiner longitudinal
strife ; interstices rounded or punctate, lirse on the last whorl
broad and subdivided by a fine groove, longitudinal striae sub-
distant (so that the interstices are transversely oblong) and
passing occasionally over the lirse, so as to make them sub-
granular, especially at the anterior margin ; aperture
subauriform, posteriorly acutely attenuate, peristome anteriorly
everted and recurved, plait conspicuous, solid, obtuse. Long.
12, Lat. 6, apert. 6.
A form very closely allied to the A. pinguis, D’Orb., of the
European Miocene, from which it differs in the narrower
form, the character of the plait, the anteriorly produced mouth
and everted lips. It has no Tasmanian nor Southern Aus-
tralian congener.
Cylicuna aeachis. Quoy. Still living in Tasmania and
Australia, and not uncommon in the Table Cape beds.
Liotia discoidea. Eeeve Zool. Prov., 1844. Living in
Tasmania and extending to Philippines; somewhat small in
the fossil state and rare.
Fissubella concatenata. Crosse. Shell thin, oval,
laterally and anteriorly depressed, tumid posteriorly, irregu-
larly concentrically ridged with lines of growth, and covered
all over with fine hexagonal depressions which grow broader


from apex to margin ; foramen oval, with a conspicuous
tubercle on each side, and widely margined beneath, interior
margin enamelled, and above which the shell is undulately
striate or subcorrugated to the foraminal margin. Long. 14,
Lat. 10, alt. 2g- mil. Easily distinguished by its hexagonal
markings, in which it differs from any described. This shell
was described by H. Crosse, in the Jour, de Conchy, in 1864
but the fossil forms are generally thinner and fragile, and
more like the variety found near Sydney.
Emakginula teansenna. n.s. Shell thick, small, oblong,
subquadrate posteriorly, end slightly produced, conical, high,
apex submarginal, smooth, acute, recurved, parallel with the
margin, anterior surface ventricose, posterior concave,
latticed ; radiating ribs 23, high, between them smaller ones
which often in descending give rise to still smaller; transverse
ribs raised, but always more sunk than the radiate, and at all
the points of intersection, very projecting granules, interstices
very deep and square, fissure slightly longer than width,
margin denticulate, straight. Long. 11, Lat. 6, alt. 6. Fissure,
Long. lj mill., Lat. mill.
There are many fossil Emarginulas, some descending as low
as the Inf. Oolite, though most of them are tertiary. The
above description, detailed though it may seem, would apply
to many species unless particular attention is paid to the re-
lative dimensions. It is very near the existing Arctic (?) E.
ftssura, Lamk., but narrower, and less high in proportion to
length. It is not unlike the E. clathratasformis, Eichw.
(Vienna Miocene) but that has a sinuous margin, and the
apex is incurved and marginal. I doubt very much if our
fossil is distinct from what Mr. Angas names E. dilecta of
South Australia and N. S. Wales, but which is very distinct
from E. dilecta of A. Adams (Proc. Zool. Soc. 1851, p. 85),
which comes from King George’s Sound. The latter is very
depressed with deep fissure.
Pleueotosia. This genus, which is very largely repre-
sented in the tertiary deposits of Europe, and in the existing
fauna is not numerically a large genus in Australian or New
Zealand tertiarics, and in this it accords with the existing
state of things. Out of over 400 living species (divided into
many genera and subgenera) Australia has scarcely 30, and
out of nearly 400 fossil species the tertiary beds of Australia
and New Zealand have not so far yielded a dozen'well defined.
The genus is mainly characterised by the deep cut or sinus in
the outer lip. In this and in the form of the shell there is
every variety. I draw attention to two important charac-
ters which distinguish the sinus, which seems of value in
the identification of species. Sometimes it is close to the


suture, either as a mere notch or narrow slit, or it is at some
distance from it. Ist. On a keel which becomes nodose,
granular or imbricately squamose. Or, 2nd. By the side of
the keel, next the suture, or outside. On this particular the
striation and ornamentation I have found depend very much.
For convenience also we may divide the genus into: —1.
Plicate, or ribbed. 2. Spirally keeled. 3. Plicate and
keeled. Each division may also be subdivided thus : —A.
Spire longer than the body whorl. B. Body whorl longer
than the spire. In New Zealand the plicate division is repre-
sented best. Eleven fossil species are known, two of which are
living, and there are four living forms in the same seas, and
one which Captain Hutton refers to Daphnella, the Drillia
( Mangelia ) letourneuxiana of Crosse. It does not correspond
with the Daphnella genus referred to here. We find in the
Australian tertiaries none of those mitras like forms of Europe
such as P. ramosa, Bast., neither is the style of ornamentation
that of P. granulocincta, Miinst, P. Schreihersii, Horn. The
shells are simply granular, and not often ribbed as far as they
have been examined.
Pleueotoma pullulascens. n.s. Shell small, slender,
rather solid, fusifonuly turretted, spire nearly twice exceed-
ing body whorl, apex naticiform shining, smooth of 1~ turns ;
whorls (exclusive of apex) 5, angular, equally, distantly,
spirally lirate; upper ones subplicate with rounded un-
dulating ribs ; all finely long, undulately striate; suture with
a distinct margin much broader than the lira:; sinus a rather
deep broad crescentic bend, occupying all the space between
the angle of the whorls and the suture, which is slightly
sloping, lirate and very distinctly striate with the lines of
growth ; aperture sub ovate, outer lip simple ; inner lip thick-
ened distinct, enamelled; canal short, not recurved. Long. 8,
Lat. 2|.
This is a form which closely allied to P. crispata, San. (cited
by Hornes as agreeing with Murex turricula, Brocchi, and P.
turrella, Reineri, Basteroti, Tarentini , of other authors) the
differences being that is smaller, the canal is not contorted,
and the granular apex. There is no known form like it existing
on our coasts.
Pleeueotoma sandleeoides. n.s. Shell small, somewhat
solid acutely fusiform, turretted, spire twice longer than body
whorl, apex naticiform, smooth shining; whorls 7, rounded,
accurately, closely, diagonally plicate; liras solid, smooth,
shining, 8-12 in a whorl; sinus deep and conspicous, aperture
narrow much contracted anteriorly, canal short, outer lip thin,
and curved so as to appear thickened and conspicuous, colu-
mella slightly twisted, base spirally striate. Long. 7|, Lat. 2.


A form approaching P. Sandleri, Partsch. (Vienna basin
Miocene and in habit also resembling P. costellaria, Nyst
(Eecli. coq.foss. Hosselt et El., p. 31) but smaller and more
slender than either. Much approaching in character many of
an existing Australian Mangelias, with which it would pro-
bably be associated by many naturalists. I prefer to beep it
with the Pleurotomas because of the .very conspicuous sinus
which is also margined, the margin extending remarkably on
the body whorl. The number and size of the half ribs varies
in different specimens.
Pleueotoma paeacantha. n.s. Shell fusiformly tur-
retted, spire pyramidal acute, and nearly twice as long as the
aperture; spirally equidistantly lirate, with an angle and a
spiral row of tubercles about the upper third of the body
whorls, and the lower part of those of the spire; finely longi-
tudinally undulately striate with the lines of growth in which
the profound broad rounded sinus of the outer lip is very con-
spicuous upon the keel; interstices between the lirae with
3-4 fine liruloo, tubercles on the carina sometimes broad and
sharp-edged, sometimes white, round, enamelled and projecting
almost like spines, mouth pyriform, outer lip acute, thin, inner
lip defined, slightly enamelled; canal short, almost truncate,
base strongly and finely in the interstices, spirally lirate, and
almost cancellate behind the columella. Long. 33, Lat. 13.
Not common at Table Cape. A very distinct form having
some relations with P. caiaphracta (Murex c. Brocchi Conch,
foss. subap. Tom. 11, p. 427) and P. turbida, Lamarck, Hist. an.
s. vert. Yol. 7, p. 97, which is the P. colon, of Horn, and P.
crassata of Nyst, Coq. foss. de Belg. p. 511. That shell has the
spire short in proportion to the whole length of the shell.
Daphnella coltjmbelloides. n.s. Shell small, fusiform
sub-turretted, rather solid, and much the aspect of a colum-
bella, whorls seven apical ones margined at the suture, and
ribbed with rounded smooth oblique ribs, 8-12 in each whorl;
penultimate, and last whorl smooth, margined at the suture ;
aperture long and narrowly fusiform, rounded posteriorly;
outer lip and columella simple and truncate. The lines of*
the sinus only visible with a lens, rather recurved than deep.
Long. 12, Lat. 5. Not common.
Pleueotoma johnstonii. n.s. Shell fusiformly turretted,
solid, apex acute, transversely striate, and finely, un-
dulately, longitudinally, striate (whorls 11, with 3 spiral
ribs below (the middle one most prominent), forming a tu-
midity above the suture, which is distinct but not impressed,
above which the former fissure marks form almost nodular
crescentic markings above these the lines of growth curve for-
ward to the summit, and are crossed by regular equidistant


fine lirse; apex very acute; aperture elongately fusiform, and
prolonged below into a rather long straight canal; outer lip
thin, with a broad, deep incision (2| mil. broad, and 2 deep) ;
columella broadly enamelled. Long. 38, Lat. 12.
Daphnella geacillima. n.s. Shell fusiform, thin, fragile,
shining, whorls 6, gracefully sloping, last longer than the spire,
finely striate lengthwise with irregular ridges of growth which
become fine, close, and founded at the lip; regularly and
somewhat distantly grooved with rather broad, flat, shallow,
conspicuously striate grooves, one of which is much broader
just below the suture, which is distinctly canaliculate; apex
obtuse, and natica like ; mouth narrow, finely rounded at the
suture; outer lip thin; canal short; base of the pillar finely
and obliquely decussate behind. Long. 21, Lat. I\, Aperture,
Long. 13, Lat. 3 mil.
This shell is very closely allied to D. ornata, Hinds, of the
Philippines. It is very common in Table Cape. Fourteen
specimens were collected by Mr. Johnston.
Daphnella tenuisculpta. n.s. Shell fusiformly ovate,
rather solid, aperture a little longer than the spire, apex
naticiform, depressed, smooth, shining, whorls 6, rounded,
slightly concave and narrow, grooved near the suture, every-
where very finely and closely cancellated, acutely undulately
ribbed; ribs broader than the lirse (which pass over them),
regular oblique, close on the whorls of the spire, only slightly
interrupted by the groove, and becoming an obliquely sub-
granular on a margin round the suture. On the body whorl
irregular, fine and undulating, 24 in number; aperture pyri-
form, attenuate at each end; outer lip thin, columella smooth,
canal somewhat short and truncate. On the basal whorl the
spiral lirse alternate, large and small, while the longitudinal
ones are much finer throughout. Long. 17, Lat. 8. Common.
Mangelia oeacililieata. n.s. Elegantly fusiform tur-
retted ; aperture about J- length of spire, apex obtuse, smooth,
almost turbinate for 3| whorls ; the latter (apex included) 9,
convex, everywhere very finely Urate, lirse alternating regularly
large and small and obliquely plicate; plaits 18, in penultimate
whorl, 23 in last becoming obsolete anteriorly Mouth
elliptical, outer lip varicose, produced in the middle, sinus in-
conspicuous ; columella grooved slightly; canal short, truncate.
In larger and older specimens the former mouth leaves a dis-
tinct varix on the body whorl, half a turn form the lip. Long.
13, Lat. 5. Specimens much smaller than this are found, but
without the varix.
This most remarkable fossil with its peculiar apex and varix
is distinct from any living or fossil known to me, though if I
mistake not there are Mesozoic forms not unlike it. I call


attention to the fact of the smooth almost turbinate apex
which most of the Pleurotoma family had in the Australian
cainozoic period. In this respect they seem to be distinguished
at once from living forms and European tertiary fossils.
Buccinum fragile. LS. Shell ovately fusiform, turretted,
extremely thin and fragile, spire acute, apex naticiform of two
whorls; the whole shell lirate with raised lira) which are
alternately large and small, and about three on each whorl
become nodose keels. These are cancellated by much finer
longitudinal lines ; whorls 6-7, rather globosely convex, and
angulate above, the upper ones with solid ribs, which disap-
pear on the body whorl which is multicarinate, suture deeply
impressed, but not canaliculate ; aperture broadly ovate, outer
lip very thin, with a smooth inner margin, within which there
rises a number of small, raised, polished lirse which have a
tendency to run in pairs; columella short, and spirally
much twisted, but not enamelled; canal short, and scarcely
reflected. Long. 17, Lat. 10. Long, of aperture, 8, Lat. 5.
This is a very common fossil and widely distributed as I
have seen it taken from most of the Lower Tertiary beds of
Australia. It has many representatives of its peculiar type'
among European tertiary fossils, but none living or fossil of
such a fragile character which gives it a marked specific
distinction. B. tenerum. Sow., is a very fragile form of B.
undatum found in the Eocene beds of England and Belgium,
but in that well-known and much larger species the shape is
different, and the whorls obliquely ribbed.
Triton minimum, n.s. Shell small, somewhat solid,
ovate, with a naticiform obtuse, smooth, white shining apex of
nearly four whorls ; whorls 7-8, with numerous raised rather
broad lira), sometimes alternating large and small; interstices
about twice as wide, and closely, elegantly, striate at right
angles with very fine lines, which do not appear to pass over
the spiral lirse ; spire regularly costate near the apex, the plait
disappearing for the two last whorls, though some of the lira)
are slightly nodular; varices much raised and lirate ; mouth
broadly oval, outer lip projecting beyond the varix and undu-
late, prominently dentate ; inner lip only slightly inflexed,
and oblique, about half the length of the aperture ; second
varix on a line with the columella. Long 11, Lat. 5.
There is a small fossil of this genus in the Vienna Miocene,
T. parvulum, Michl., but it is larger than the foregoing, and is
distinctly ribbed throughout. Our existing T. quoyi is also
small, but the size of the present fossil at once distinguishes it
from all known species, fossil or recent.
Cominella cancellata. n.s. Shell solid, imperforate
ovally pyramidal, costatc and lirate: apex subacute, smooth ;


whorls 7-8, convex, suhangular and somewhat concave at the
suture very distinctly and slenderly cancellate throughout
(the spiral lirae being a little smaller than the longitudinal
with a tendency especially at the base to become alternately
large or small) at the angle coronate with rounded ribs which
are obsolete below (about 14 on last whorl) aperture oval;
outer lip acute, simple, columella excavated anteriorly and
slightly twisted; canal short. Long. 24, lat. 13. Long
apert. 13.
In form a good deal like one existing 0. costata, Quoy,
but the ribs are smaller and neater while the cancellation
entirely removes it from any Australian species. In the
European Miocene Huccinum pMlippi, Micht., appears the
nearest form, but that is very different —more turriculate,
not ribbed on the lower whorl, lip thickened, etc. Some of
the Belgian Eocene forms come perhaps a little nearer.
Cominella LYEA3COSTATA. n.s. Shell rather small, fusiform
turretted, lirate and costate; apex smooth white, tur-
binate of 2| whorls, whorls 8, rounded, closely, ribbed with
round prominent ribs (16 on last whorl), and very conspicu-
ously spirally lirate, with lirse which pass over the ribs; in
addition to which the whole shell except the apex is finely
cancellate, suture deep and margined; aperture oval, outer
lip acute, finely crenulate, columella twisted, canal much
recurved with a distinct enamelled plait passing from the
centre of the notch to the back of the columella. Long. 19,
lat. 7. Long, of apert. 7.
In older larger specimens the ribs become obsolete in the
body whorl, but as the dimensions grow they are very con-
spicuous, and extend from suture to suture without alteration.
Approaching in character the Miocene Buccinum prismaticum,
Broc., of Vienna, but all the fossils of Europe differ much
in the aperture, and have the inner lip reflected over the
columella. This species differs from the last in the whorls
not being angular nor coronate; in the larger liras, the more
prominent ribs, the contorted canal, and the general form.
Thala maeginata. n.s. Shell small slenderly fusiform ;
apex obtuse smooth, shining, of three whorls; whorls 7,rounded
oblique, plicate, sub-angular, coronate and conspicuously
grooved above, finely spirally lirate, and undulately striate
with lines of growth which show the semilunar sinus very
plainly upon the groove ; plaits anteriorly absolete on the body
whorl; suture conspicuously marginate; canal straight, nar-
rowly ovate, canal prolonged, equalling the aperture in height,
outer lip thin, inner lip reflected on the columella, and with
3-4 very distinct plaits. Long. 8, Lat. 3|, length of aperture
to the end of canal 6.


The genus Thala was erected by Messrs. H. and A. Adams
in 1853, for shells which combine the characters of Mitra,
Pleurotoma, and Fasciolaria. The type specimen. T. nucifera
was found in the Philippines, and perhaps this makes only
the second or third specimen of a very rare genus.
Maeginella octoplicata. n.s. Shell solid, smooth,
shining, pyriform, spire scarcely visible; of three very small
depressed whorls, body whorl distinctly striate with lines of
growth, mouth narrow, sub-sigmoid, columella with eight
plaits, the anterior valid, scarcely oblique, the posterior four
faintly traceable, outer lip much thickened, and very regularly
dentate with 12 raised linear teeth, at the base of the colu-
mella thefS is a distinct varix, which proceeding round the
posterior end of the shell unites with reflected lip making that
broadly marginal.
This shell has considerable resemblances to certain forms
from the Indian Archipelago, but is unique in its multiplicate
columella, and peculiarly dentate outer lip. In this respect it
bridges over the gap between Marginella, and Erato, and
Cyprea.il/. 5 -plicata, Lara., If. elegans, Gmel., and M. turbinata,
Sew., show an approach to this form, but they are larger
shells. If the lower part of the columella were not so dis-
tinctly plicate, and the upper teeth so rudimentary I should
have no hesitation in placing this as a species of JSrato.
Maeginella steombifoemis, n.s. Shell small, solid smooth
shining, ovate, narrowed anteriorly, spire short obtuse, whorls
four, rounded, body whorl obscurely longitudinally p icate be-
low the suture, columella anteriorly obliquely somewhat
coarsely quadri-plicate, aperture narrow, curved posteriorly
emarginate, outer lip conspicuously thickened and produced
posteriorly, finely, tuberculately dentate within. Long. 3, lat. 7.
Very different from Australian forms, all of which, as far
as I know, have the lip smooth. It is nearest in form to the
Indian M. Marguerita, Kiener, but that is a somewhat larger
and more angular shell. Not unlike a minute strombus viewed
from above owing to the produced lip. The genus is very
poorly represented in European tertiaries, few being known
and none living in the northern seas.
Maeginella wentwoethii. n.s. Shell small, ovately
oblong, tumid, smooth, shining; spire exsert, obtuse, whorls
five, roundly angulate, aperture narrow,oblong, outer lip much
thickened, deeply channelled above, enamelled on the edge,
with numerous small tubercular teeth within the margin;
columella with four plaits; the three anterior oblique, fourth
at right angles to the axis, anterior aperture widely chan-
nelled. Long. 6, lat. 3J mil.
Teivia eueopea. Montf. Testae. Brit, (as Cgpreti) 0,


coceinella. Lamarck (1810, Ann. Mus., vol. 16, p. 104.
T. coccinelloides, Sow. Min. Conch, vol. 4,p. 10 7, pi. 378, Jig 1.
Nyst. Coq. Foss, de Belg., p. 609.) The shell which I thus
identify I distinguish by its size, the absence of dorsal division
between the striae and the arcuate aperture. It is found
throughout the Miocene of Italy, France, Austria, Sicily, and
exists in the Mediterranean. I can find no ground whatever
for separating our fossil from the one described as above. An
unusual number of works (31) are cited by Hornes and
Parlsch, whose Foss. Moll, and the above-named authors I
have been able to consult, besides "Wood on the Crag Mollusca,
Deshayes, Lamarck, while specimens of the Italian fossil are
in my possession, and except that they are a little longer I
can see no difference. Long. 7, lat. 6. The knowledge
obtained recently of this wide-spread diffusion of some species
will prevent that difficulty hitherto experienced in the identifi-
cation to European species, and will prevent their needless
multiplication on geographical grounds alone. The shell is,
however, very distinct from our Trivia australis, Lamk.
Coltjmbella. cainozoica. Shell minute smooth, somewhat
solid, narrowly pyramidal, spire longer than the aperture,
apex elongately naticiform of two smooth shining whorls ;
whorls in all six, very slightly rounded, almost flat, smooth,
but not shining with faint strice of growth, suture distinct;
aperture broadly sigmoid ; outer lip thickened and finely
dentate ; columella smooth with five corrugated plaits behind,
passing obliquely to round the notch which is broad and
scarcely recurved. The outer lip is thickened into almost a
varix, and the last whorl has the stria; of growth raised so as
to become almost like costce. Long. 4, Lat. scarcely 2.
In shells which differ so little in form as to cause the
majority of specific distinctions in existing forms to depend
upon colour alone, it is difficult to give such a description as
will not apply to many other species. This species therefore
must be distinguished first by its small size. 2. By its
thickened almost varicose lip. 3. By its very prominent striae
of growth. 4. By its naticiform apex (which it shares with
many living Australian species, especially 0. minuta, mihi,
which is much the same in size) ; and, lastly, the peculiar
corrugations from the back of the columella and round the
notch. No living or fossil form known to me unites all these
details, though in general form our fossil is not unlike G.
scripta, Bell., a much larger form of the Vienna Miocene. The
genus is almost unknown as fossil, but very numerous as
living species, probably over 200. All subtropical, two being
in New Zealand, but none fossil, in any of the extensive
tertiary deposits of those islands.


Columbella oxleyi. n.s. Shell small, fusiformly turretted,
smooth, shining; whorls 8, somewhat rounded, overlapping
slightly at the suture, apex with a distinct natica like pullus.
extending for 2| whorls, smooth, pyriform, much narrower
posteriorly, and produced, with a narrow sloping channel an-
teriorly, outer lip thin; inner lip slightly inflected over the
columella, behind which are numerous .sloping fine regular
lirse. Body whorl slightly angulated at the suture. Long.
9, Lat. 3 mil. Named after the early explorer of N. S. Wales.
This singular fossil varies from Columbella in particulars of
almost generic importance, not only in the apex but in the
turriculated habit. It has no known living form in Australia.
Naticavixumbilicata, n.s. Shell globose, smooth, shin-
ing, very finely cancellate, which is visible only with a lens;
spire acute, slightly exsert as a more finely rounded coil;
whorls 6. The apical 4, small, round, and distinct, only
slightly increasing in size, the last two becoming suddenly
globose, aperture semilunar ; outer lip thin, inner lip everted
anteriorily into an acute projecting angle, umbilicus small
narrow, deep, slightly cal'ous above, with a conspicuous groove
leading to it from the anterior angle of the lip. Long. 20,
lat. 13J, long apert. 12, lat. 7, diam. of umbilicus I|.
Cucullzea cain oizoiCA. n.s. Shell roundly trigonal, ob-
lique, globose, smooth, faintly and closely marked with radia-
ting ribs and concentric strise, the latter well defined and
somewhat rugose at the margin and sides, umbones very
acute and recurved ; ligamental area, arched, broad, with six
straight grooves on each, which are well defined and overlap
each other alternately under the umbo, hinge teeth, 6-7, bent
under the hinge and then bicuspidate, muscular impressions
lanceolate, well defined, the anterior adductor with a slightly
lamellar edge, margin finely pectinated with very distinct
crenulations which continue in young shells all round as far
as the hinge. Young shells are also more quadrate and
have the angular ears slightly developed. Altogether the
shell is intermediate between Cuculloea and Pectunculus and
partakes somewhat of the character of both genera.
NuctUiA tijmida. n.s. Shell small, solid, obliquely tri-
gonal, tumid truncated anteriorly, slightly produced and
rounded posteriorly, finely wrinkled with consecutive irregular
rounded ribs, increasing in thickness from umbones to mar-
gin, and irregularly grooved with deep consecutive iiues of
growth, margin thickened and bilabiate, hinge teeth small
diverging progressively in an increasing series, interrupted by a
narrow deep ligamental pit, largest teeth slightly bent,
anterior row short, eight in number, the distal ones smaller,
but all high and lamellar, umbones fine and sharply incurved;


lunule shallow but well defined, wrinkled and broadly lanceo-
late. Transverse long. 13, lat. 11; thickness of both valves
united, 8 mill. Not unlike' the Tasmanian iV. grayi, Sow.,
but more tumid and conspicuously sulcate.
Leda ceebeecostata, n.s. Shell minute, depressed, trans-
verse, trigonal narrowly oblong, roundly obtuse in front, much
punctured, almost angular, and slightly gaping behind, sinus
conspicuous—2—sub-depressed and conspicuously cut by an
angle from which the shell slopes to the margin, whole surface
of the valve regularly concentrically marked with equal
rounded ribs ; hinge line inconspicuous, and short
anterior sub-ligamental area distinct. Transverse long. 5, lat.
8, thickness of both valves joined 3.
The sinus and angle project from the margin of this fossil
like a tubercle. Smaller and less rostrate than L.-caudata, Don
but like it, distinguished by the abrupt angulation of
the sinus. There is no European fossil like it in this respect.
Caedita geacilicostata. n.s. Shell roundly oblong,
transverse, inequilateral, oblique, globose, solid, furnished with
30 to 34 fine, curved, radiating, finely nodular ribs, which
are narrower than the interstices, nodules obsolete to near the
centre, whence they become less rounded and more lamellose
to the margin, where they are almost spinous, and united to
one another by transverse raised liras, umbones, finely ribbed,
acute, oblique, and much incurved, lunule, short cordate,
well defined and deep, hinge area much overlapping the hollow
of the umbones, hinge with one central tubercular, rounded
tooth, round which the laterals make a complete arch, much
thickened posteriorly. Margins coarsely crenulate. Long,
from umbo 27. Transverse lat. 31. Alt. of both valves
14 mil.
Lima bassii. n.s. Shell oblong, subquadrate, rather
solid, somewhat tumid, rad lately and squamosely ribbed,
margin full, and equally rounded with a prolonged curve;
anterior side short, and very slightly concave, almost mar-
gined through its whole extent by a small, narrow, obtusely
angled auricle, which has three small rough ribs, and is
deeply striate near the umbo, posterior side without auricle,
truncated with a straight, sloping line deeply impressed with
fossa towards the interior; ribs 22 in number, radiating regu-
larly, divided at equal intervals by long arched, raised
squamse, etc., umbo acute and only slightly curved. Length
from umbo to margin 27. Lat. 22 mil.
Very distinct from any Australian congener by the absence
of the auricle and the straight posterior side, though the form
closely approximates to the sp. L. squamsa, now living in the
Eed Sea and Mediterranean.


Lima (Limathla) subaueiculata. Montf. This shell
which is also found in the British seas still existing, and has
been collected by Cummingin the Philippines's a common fossil
at Table Cape, at least I can discover no difference in size,
shape, makings, etc. We thus have a world-wide distribution
as well as an extensive range in time.
Tellina cainozoica. n.s. I give this name to a shell
which has characters slightly different from any existing
Australian form, but the number of species is already so
great and the differences so slight that I venture to add to
them only with considerable reluctance. The form of this
fossil approaches to our T. albinella, of which there is a white
and pink variety. It is, however, smaller, smoother, and less
arcuate with scarcely a perceptible sinus. The dimensions of
this specimen is transversely 24. Long. 15. Thickness 5.
Chione pbopinqua. n.s. Shell small, oval, transverse,
equivalve, sub-equilateral, posterior and slightly longer and
sub-attenuate, anterior end broadly, rounded, transversely
ribbed with many solid, raised, rounded ribs grooved behind
and lamellar at each end, ribs striate transversely and between
which the striae become larger towards the umbones and-
finally indistinguishable from the ribs.of which there are 18-20
in all; interior finely crenulate right round to the hinge
posteriorly, to the umbone anteriorly; central tooth bifid,
lateral, —anterior lamellar and moved outwards; posterior
bifid, muscular impressions scarcely perceptible. Transverse
length 26. Lat. 4.21. A shell certainly very nearly approach-
ing our existing Chione conularis, hut less oblique in its shape,
size, and almost entirely crenulated margin.
Venus (chione) cainozoica, n.s. suborbicular, inequi-
lateral, globosely convex, very finely and closely striate with
concentric lines, which here and there become lamellose,
lamella; close and more numerous at tho anteiior and pos-
terior margin, scarcely raised, extremely thin and nearly
always broken and incomplete, where there are no lamella;,
stria; regular and equi-distant, marking lines of growth which
seem to overlap each other in regular succession ; anterior side
rounded, contracted ; posterior side broadly rounded and very
slightly produced; umhones convex, much incurved and
smooth, lunule clearly defined, but not deep, broadly cor-
date lamellosely striate and radiating from the um-
bones, and finely crenulated on the edge within; hinge teeth,
right valve with one long lateral ridge extending to the ventral
margin with a groove between it and the edge, three smaller
teeth, the two posterior bifid, the anterior one small, lamellar
and oblique; left valve with a lateral ridge, one thin short
curved hinge below the corselet, one broad central tooth ; and


two anterior, one oblique and lamellar and one more tubercle,
the whole anterior, ventral margin finely crenulated. Trans-
verse. Long. 22, Lat. 18. Thickness of both valves 17.
This fossil is very completely removed from any known
existing Australian form, being more globose, more finely
striate; and the peculiar crenulation of the margin which ex-
tends under the lunule. lam not acquainted with any fossil
form near it as far as my acquaintance with the European
Miocene and Eocene extends. It must be admitted, however,
that the points of distinction in shells where there is so much
general resemblance, as in this genus,can scarcely be made out
without the closest attention to details and comparison of
specimens. The descriptions by most ordinary writers on
palaeontology are quite insufficient.
Chama lamellifera. ns. Shell somewhat small, thick -
isb, globose, angularly orbicular, very inequivalve, and ad-
herent. The whole surface of both valves covered with close
thin irregular lamella;, which, though sometimes projecting
slightly, never become much produced or spiny, in the grooves
between fine and smaller ridges can be seen; left valve very
convex, attached anteriorally where it is sharply angled and
flattened ; umbones small and very much incurved, making
almost a spiral whorl; hinge linear and curved with a broad
flat concave linear fossette under the dorsal curve, right valve
solid, very convex (but less so than the left valve) with an
incurved sloping prominent umbo. Largest specimens about
lat. 24 by 22 and 18 mill, thick.
In the absence of radiating striae the non-spinous or pro-
duced lamella;, and the size, all this species differs from the
known fossil Chamac. It is very abundant in the beds.
Besides the foregoing fossils I have provisionally named the
following not being able to publish a more extended diagnosis
because of the imperfect state of the specimens.
A small smooth Pyramidella, Pyramidella roherti, mihi,
with perfectly flattened smooth whorls, 12 in number; the
apex of 3 round smooth turns; the aperture subquadrate ;
base of columella everted. Long. 6-, Lat. 2 mill.
Eissoina tate an a. Almost turbinate, numerous oblique
solid ribs on upper whorls ; lower whorl almost smooth; outer
lip varicose. 1 mil. Lat.; Long. (?), (decollated.)
Gibula claekei. n.s. A turbinated multicarinate shell,
obliquely, regularly, and finely lirate, where they cross the
Carina;, making the latter almost granular; whorls 6; flat-
tened and broadly canaliculate at the suture; base flat or
convex, grooved, deeply umbilicate, obliquely striate within,


shell a brilliant green nacre underneath the outer shelly coat.
Diam. and Lat. about 3 mil., dedicated to the eminent geolo-
gist, the Rev. W. B. Clarke. A fossil which varied so much
in the few specimens I examined that I hardly liked to include
it in my list.
Dendeophtllia duncani. n.s. This is a compound
corallite, with a very imperfect epitheca. It gives off four
branches from a kind of internode, but in the specimens
examined by me (among the corals collected by E. M. Johnston,
Esq., Dr. Milligan, and Mr. Stephens), the branches and
stem were broken off short. It differs from the hitherto only
Australian tertiary species in the iuternodal character of the
branches and the imperfect epitheca. A complete diagnosis
will no doubt be published by Professor Duncan, to whom
the specimens will be forwarded, but I have taken very gladly
the opportunity of dedicating it to the learned Professor, to
whom the science of geology owes so .much.
Flabellum duncani. n.s. The coral is cuneiform and
very much compressed at the base, which is pedicillate. The
calice is elliptical and shallow. The septa are in six systems
of.three cycles, delicate and well apart, the principal exsert'
and rounded, having few large rounded lateral granules. The
fossa is deep and rather broad. There is no columella. There
is a stout epithera, and the costae are strongly marked, linear
tapering with faint transverse curved folds, 22-24 in number.
Height, 6, transverse diam. of calice, 4|. Lat. 3, millim.
This is the fifth flabellum described from the Australian
tertiaries. It is smaller than any of them, and mainly dis-
tinguished by the distinct external costae.
Buskia. nov. gen. This genus is proposed for Escharas,
which are disposed on a cylindrical hollow axis, which is
branched and irregular. It differs from Eschara in not having
the cells back to back, but on one side only of the cylindrical
branches, and from Hemeschara, in being erect and branched,
and not encrusting.
Buskia typica. n.s. Cells disposed sometimes quincun-
cially and sometimes irregular, surface of the branches
crumpled aud flexuous, elliptical branches irregular and
widely separated ; if bifurcating a very wide cellular interval
between the opposite divisions; cells convex and projecting
from a very clearly defined margin, within which there is a
row of pores continuing all round from 18-26 in number. From
each pore there is a deep grove to the mesial line, which is also
sometimes grooved, and then the surface has a rugose cor-
rugated appearance ; mouth orbicular, with a somewhat larger
often pyriform pore on each side. Width of some of the
branches, 10 diam. 7 mill.


ECHINODERMATA.
The following notes on the Echinodermata have been
made by Mr. Johnston, some of which I have examined
and compared the species, and added the specific names,
with a few verbal alterations.
Micraster brevistella. Laube. Rather more rounded
than Laube’s figure. It is slightly compressed dorsally;
central surface concave. The anal orifice is triangular -in
appearance, with the apex towards the “plastron,” and is
situated on the posterior of the ventral surface.
The plastron is round, and is situated near the.middle
of the concave ventral surface. The five ambulacra radiate
from the apical disc in a graceful though slightly irregular
manner. The pores 27 to 37 double pairs on each ambu-
lacrum, extend about half way over the dorsal surface;
and from the extremities of each double pair, the two
grooves are continued round to the ventral surface, and
thence to the plastron. The groves may be described as
irregularly parallel to each other. The whole surface is
densely covered with rather small tubercles, uniform in
size, and surrounded by scrobicula.
Micraster etheridgei. n.s. Test small, oval, depressed,
and surface very much flattened ; ventral slightly con-
cave; ambulacral groves 5, well marked and continued
from apical disc on the dorsal surface to the plas-
tron on the ventral surface; anal orifice, small, round,
situated at the posterior ventral margin; plastron,
central, round. The whole test covered densely with
tubercles, small, but irregular in size and distribution.
The dorsal surface is too imperfectly preserved to make
out the apical disc or ambulacral pores clearly.
Hewipatagus woodsii (var. a) Cordiform. Differs from
H. woodsii in the following particulars:—Apical disc
contains 5 ocular plates, and is situated nearer to anterior
end of test madreporiform body angular : odd ambulacral
groove, much shallower than in H. Woodsii.
Primary tubercles greater in number; occasionly one
primary tubercle is found situated on the posterior inter-
ambulacra. Great breadth nearer to anterior and than
upon H. woodsii. Dorsal surface much more flattened and
depressed.
Note. —Prof. Duncan has lately shown that Hemipatagus
is a genus identical with the living Lovenia, Gray.


ON A NEW SPECIES OF AMPULLARIA.
BY THE REV. J. E. TENISON-WOODS, F.G.S., F.L.S.,
Coek. Mem. Eoy. Soc. Tas., Sydney, &c.
I beg to bring under the notice of the Society a new
species of Ampullaria, a genus hitherto unknown in the
Australias. Some time since I described all the known
freshwater shells of the island which duly appeared in last
year’s transactions. Since then I have described a new
Valvata, V. tasmanica which was discovered by that most
industrious entomologist, Aug. Simson, who obtained it
from a creek in Gould’s Country. Since then in looking
over some shells kindly placed at my disposal by Ronald
Gunn, Esq., F.L.S., I have found the Ampullaria which I
now describe. It is small in size, but very interesting from
the fact that it is the only species of that very large genus
which has yet been found in any part of Australia. For-
tunately, though the collection of individuals was small,
yet the most of them had the operculum in situ, which
enabled me to pronounce, that it is shelly. The genus has
only been studied of late years, and is found best repre-
sented in South America, where it attains a large size, and
presents beautiful varieties of colouring. I was unable to
ascertain the precise habitat from Mr. Gunn, who was,
however, certain that it was obtained from some of the
rivers emptying themselves on the north coast.
Ampullaria tasmanica. n.s. A.t. parva, subglohosa, cornea,
spirabrevi, ohtusa, epidermide atro-olivaeea, indnta; anfractibus 4,
subito decrcscentibus; apertura lata, simplici, postice angulata; labio
alba, conspicua, cuncava, rejiexa, fame eetate albicante. Operculum,
subconvexum, Icedgatum epidermide (?) olivacea indutum.
Shell small, subglobose, horny, with a short obtuse spire;
epidermis blackish olive; whorls 4, rapidly decreasing,
aperture wide, simple, angulate posteriorly, inner lip white
conspicuous, reflexed, concave; throat becoming whitish
with age. Operculum, sub convex, smooth, with an olive
epidermis (?)
IJiam. maj. 3\, min. S mil.
This little ampullaria has no determinate characters
except its small size, dark color, and white concave inner
lip. The penultimate whorl is rather gibbous.
