THE
CLIMATOLOGICAL BASIS
OF FORESTRY
NEW SOUTH WALES
I. CLIMATE.
(i) ? Climate is the universal locality factor ?, Cajander, 1926.
(2) ? When a process is conditioned as to its rapidity by a number of separate factors
the rate of progress is limited by the pace of the slowest factor.? Blackman, 1905.
Geographers have always been agreed that climate controls vegetation, and this statement
must stand. The difficulty, however, has been to evolve a system of correlation. Many attempts
have been made to evolve schemes of universal application.
Schimper in 1898 and Mayr in 1909 attempted to develop schemes intended to be of universal
application. Champion (1) in 1935 puts forward a classification scheme based on four Tempera-
ture Zones. Moor (2) in 1937, says that ? Chip originated ? a degree of wetness ? formula designed
to express effective rainfall during a year ? and himself used a modified form using a monthly
instead of a yearly period.
All these schemes of classification are more or less cumbersome and are not satisfactory.
Swain (3) in 1928, discussing the climatico-phyto-geographical conditions of Queensland
states : ? The general limiting factors in the vegetative process are cold and drought, and as
first measures of these limiting factors may be accepted ?
(1) The mean temperature of the coldest month (MTCM);
(2) the degree of rain continuity through the year ?;
and adds that : ? These factors exercise obvious influence on the geographical arrangement of
Australian forest species ?
Swain (4) in his 1938 Climatic Index, enlarged and reversed his order of precedence of the
limiting factors in the vegetative process. His simple and effective formula for climatic
classification now is :
(i) Continuity or rather lack of continuity of rainfall throughout the \"ear, i.e., the seasonal
drought period.
(2) The mean temperature for the coldest month (MTCM).
(3) The temperature range as expressed by the mean temperature of the hottest month
(MTHM) in relation to MTCM.
(4) The mean annual rainfall (MAR) as a subordinate factor.
This classification is embodied in the Index which is global in character, enabling the correlation
of world homoclimes.
It is evident from the application of this formula that the limits of indigenous vegetation are
in close accord with the climatic limits arrived at by means of this classification, and the Index
is therefore self-demonstrative.


The primary divisions of the Index comprise four broad Regions based on the duration of
seasonal drought?any period exceeding one month with less than 2 inches average monthly
rainfall constituting the seasonal drought period.
Region A is without drought and is a moist climate.
B has a seasonal drought of 2-4 months and is a moderately moist climate.
C has a seasonal drought of 5-7 months and is a dry climate.
D is the arid climate with 8-12 months drought.
Each Region is divided into 2 Zones and 10 Sub-Zones, the Zones being indicated by an integer
and the Sub-Zones by a decimal ; a letter indicates the relative character of the mean annual
rainfall.
The Primary Division is based wholly on the season of, and duration of drought.
Odd numbers indicate Winter-Spring, and even numbers Summer- Autumn droughts.
The limits of the sub-zones are fixed by the MTCM and MTHM.
The Index being global all similar climates of the globe are grouped under the foregoing
headings, and an easy reference to similar world climates to any particular station is readily
available.
The Climatological Maps are the graphic representation of this Index and the correlation of
climate and vegetation.
The whole of the world?s basic climate Zones are represented in Zones 1-8 on the maps of New
South Wales and Australia, the one great difference between the local climates and that of
many other portions of the globe is the degree of temperature range. The Australian climate
is outstandingly equable by comparison.
A study of the Climatological Map reveals New South Wales as a very dry country with a
narrow belt of sustained rains climate on the fringe of the eastern and south-eastern coast and
parts of the highlands, a narrow zone of broken rain climate mostly inside and adjoining the
sustained rainfall area, then a small zone of droughty climates, and finally a huge area of very
dry to arid climates. The same dty climates are evident on the map of Australia, showing
definitely the vast proportion of arid lands.

AUSTRALIAN CLIMATES AND HOMOCLIMES :
Summing up for the whole of Australia, it may be said that the whole of the East Coast has a
climate predominately that of the Argentine, Brazil, and Mexico with spots of South Africa;
Mozambique comes in in N. Queensland with patches of India and Annam. The North Coast
and hinterland has the climate of Madagascar, India and Mozambique. The West Coast and
hinterland has the climate of South Africa, Nigeria, Algeria, Sudan, Mexico and Arizona, with
spots of Persia. The South and South West has a South African and Californian climate with
spots of Spain. This climate extends around the south of Australia to Port Phillip where
Californian and Mediterranean conditions cross to the north of the Alps. A fringing Oregon
climate is evident. Coastal climates extending to New South Wales from Port Phillip are
mostly South African and New Zealand in character, but similar to southern N.S.W.

The cooler and moister parts of southern Australia have counter-parts in Chile, and Oregon,
U.S.A. Most of Eastern Australia back from the coast has the climates of Argentine, Mexico,
Texas and South Africa, with patches of Southern Rhodesia in the Downs country, and Arizona
climates to the west.
The summit of the Alps has a climate approximately that of parts of Norway and Alaska,
the cooler slopes that of France and Italy. The lower Murrumbidgee basin is Mediterranean
in character with patches of California.
The S.E. Tablelands (cold and dry for the most part) have an Argentine climate with an Irish
and Turkish patch in the northern part. In more southern latitudes the dry cold Mexican
climate is in evidence with spots of French and British Isles climates. East Coastal plateaux
have an Argentine and Mexican climate with spots of Japan, Black Sea, Russia and Italy. The
dry heart of Australia has a climate similar to Egypt, Arizona, Palestine and patches of
Californian desert climate.
In Tasmania the climates of California, Scilly, Portugal, Chile and Washington are in evidence.
STATE CLIMATES AND HOMOCLIMES :
Queensland : Has a small area of continuous rainfall with a climatic similitude to Brazil and
Mexico, with a spot of South Africa and of Madagascar in the wettest parts.
The nearly continuous rain belt has a climate similar to parts of Mexico and Argentine, with
spots of Mozambique and South Africa, and occasional Texan, Indian and Annam climates.
The cooler drier zone has climatic counterparts in South Africa, South Rhodesia, with patches
of Texas. The hotter, drier zone climates of Mozambique, Madagascar and Mexico, become
general with areas of Gambier, The Sudan, and India.
The Herberton-Atherton plateau country has a climate approaching that of Abyssinia, whilst
the dry west has climatic counterparts in Mexico, Texas, Argentine, with spots of Algeria and
Egypt-
New South Wales : In the narrow coastal belt of continuous rains, the climate of wet parts
of Argentine and Brazil predominate, with some of South Africa and Mexico, and patches of
Texas, Florida, South Carolina and Paraguay. On the coastal plateaux and ranges with con-
tinuous rainfall, the climates of Japan, Black Sea, Russia, Italy, Argentine and Mexico are
represented in the north, whilst the wetter parts of the British Isles occur in the south ?all
regions of summer-autumn rainfall. The region of continuous winter rains in the Southern
Alps has a climate similar to those of Norway and Alaska. The central mountains show a climate
of the continuous but moderate rain climates of Texas, Brazil, Argentine, France and Italy,
with an outcrop of Oregon, U.S.A.
The drier belt of coastal slopes and river valleys well represents the climates of Argentine,
with an intrusion of Burmah in the north and of South Africa in the south. A few dr}? ? islands ?
of South African climate occur throughout the length of this region.
The cold Highlands show also a climate of Argentine in predominance with spots of Turkish,
French and Irish climates in the north. In the south the highlands are generally drier, the
Argentine climate fades out. A spot of Californian climate occurs in Federal Capital Territory,
but generally the South Tablelands show a climatic counterpart to that of cold dry Mexican
regions, with sections of France and British Isles and specks of Norway.
In the north the cooler western slopes have a distinctly Argentine, Mexican and Texas climate,
with Arizona coming in on the western edge. They are regions of winter drought.
Southerly the cooler slopes have a climate similar to France and Italy, with a representation
of Yugo-Slavia. The warmer Riverina resembles parts of Spain, Italy, Turkey, Greece and
Palestine, with a patch of Cyprus. Californian climates put in an appearance also.
West of the Darling climates similar to Palestine, Egypt and Arizona, occur.


Victoria ; The climate of Victoria is less complex than that of N.S.W. Except for a small
length of Gippsland Coast, with a South African and New Zealand climate, the State is within
a region of Summer-Autumn drought. The Alps are similar to Alaska and Norway, with a
touch of Northern Scotland.
The slopes to the Coast have a counterpart in France, whilst the slopes northerly have the
climate of Spain, Portugal, Italy and Algeria. The dry hot northern interior has a dry Spain,
Californian and Mexican counterpart. The westerly ranges have a climate similar to parts of
Oregon, U.S.A., whilst the whole of the south west has a predominant Californian climate with
spots of Spain and Portugal.
A speck of Brazil is to be found in the Beech Forest area.
South Australia : with a more even climate is, in its limited moderately wet part, similar to
parts of Chile and Oregon (U.S. A.). The remainder of the State has a dry to very dry climate and
is almost wholly Californian in character, with sections of Portugal and Spain, Tunisia and
Algeria. There is also a speck of Chile in Kangaroo Island.
The arid north has an Egyptian climate.
West Australia : The climate of the south is largely Californian and South African, with
sections of Spain and Algeria.
To the north, South Africa, Mexico and Arizona are evident, with spots of Persia and the
Sudan. The far north coast has something of Nigeria at Port George IV, and an Algerian climate
is evident in the Eastern Kimberly?s.
The climate of Arizona and Syria occurs in the gold fields and north, whilst that of Egypt
occupies the arid southern interior. Also some Californian counterparts exist for the arid areas.
North A ustralia ; Northern Darwin has counterparts in Madagascar, Orissa, India or part
of Mexico. The remainder has a climate similar to parts of Mexico, Mozambique and Dhond,
India. The southern arid area has a counterpart in parts of California and perhaps Sudan.
Tasmanian climatic counterparts are mainly California, Scilly Islands, Washington (U.S.A.),
Portugal, Chile and the Kerguelen Islands.
11. THE CLIMATOLOGICAL BASIS OF FORESTRY.
From the foregoing, it is evident that climate exercises a strict control over vegetational
distribution, and is the principal external factor affecting tree growth in particular, the other
main factors are edaphic or local.
The climatic factor influences large areas, whilst edaphic factors are restricted and are mostly
determined by local physical conditions.
Differences in character of vegetation ;within climatic zones are determined by local factors
such as soil conditions, aspect, etc.
It is possible to modify edaphic factors to a fair extent, but the climatic factor is beyond
control except in a very limited way, on very local sites.
It follows then that in any sound scheme of forestry, climate must be the principal consideration
and the most suitable plants for any given climate are those occurring naturally in that climate,
or in a reasonably similar climate.
The climatic control of forest types and species is very evident in New South Wales, i.e., the
jungle species of the hot humid sites in the coastal division, the open stands of leathery-leaved
stunted eucalypts of the cold dry Tablelands, and the sturdy shrubs with wax coated foliage
of the arid interior.
The climatic control of distribution of species in N.S.W. is hereunder.

111. DISTRIBUTION OF FOREST TYPES AND SPECIES.
The lorest vegetation of the State may be divided into four broad divisions corresponding
to the grouping of the Climatic Zones.
These divisions are :
I. The Coastal Division:
Embracing the whole of the warmer regions of Zone i?regions of continuous summer
rains?light to heavy, varying from 30" MAR in the south to 70" MAR to the north;
and part of Zone 3 of broken rains.
This climate produces the State?s most valuable forests, both of hardwood and brushwood,
also the only Araucarian forests occurring in the State. The division occupies a narrow
strip lying mostly between the foot of the coastal escarpment and the ocean and on the coastal
plateaux. The greatest width of this division is about 60 miles in the north, constricting
in the south to a few miles in width in the vicinity of Sydney and Illawarra, then expanding
again to about 30 miles in width to the southern borders of the State.
The forests of this division comprise two types of vegetation ;
[a) The Eucalyptian.
(b) The sub-tropical jungle type.
(a) The Eucalypt forest is more or less open and park-like in character, and in addition
to the predominating genus, contains half-a-dozen or so non-eucalypts. This forest
occurs for the whole length of the State.
(b) The sub-tropical jungle is most extensive in the northern parts of the division and much
of it is found on the Coastal Plateaux. This type is popularly known as ? Brush ?
and carries a dense stand of species occurring in several stories and bound together with
vines of all descriptions. Glades of Palms are frequent throughout on suitable sites.
A valuable sub-type now almost eliminated is the Araucarian belt, which encroached on
both types of forests and extended from about the Bellingen River to the northern limits of
the State, and on into Queensland.
Climatically the Eucalypt forest of this division falls into two distinct classes
(i) The region of continuous rains.
(ii) The region of broken rains.
The latter region occurs mostly along the dry valleys of the Upper Clarence, Hunter and
Hawkesbury Rivers, and vegetationally is distinctive in that several dry country species have
crossed the main divide and invaded the nominally coastal territory, mingling with the more
drought-resistant coastal denizens.
The intruding species are Euc. crebra (narrow leaf Ironbark) and Euc. mclanophloia (Silver
leaf Ironbark). In addition to these two species Euc. trachyphloia enters the Valley of the
Hunter, together with the non-eucalypts, Casuarina cambagei (The Belah), Cm. luehmanii
(Bull Oak), Callitris glauca, and Call, calcamta (White and Black Cypress Pine), Acacia harpo-
phyila (Brigalow), Acacia homalophylla (Yarran), Ac. salicina (Willow Wattle) and occasionally
Ac. pendula (Weeping Myall), Geijera parviflora (Wilga) and Pitiosporuni phillyraeoides (Butter
Bush). (The latter occurs in the 6" MAR rainfall belt at the western limits of the State.)
In the broken rain region of the Hawkesbury River, Euc. crebra is the only dry country intruder
at present existing. The drought hardy coastal species mingling in this broken rain region
are Euc. maculata (Spotted Gum), Etw. siderophloia (Broad-leaved Red Ironbark), and Euc.
eugenioides (White Stringybark), and in the Hawkesbury region only?the southern species?
Euc. lougifolia (Woollybutt).
Some Eucalypts of the Coastal Division, attain best development in regions of very heavy
MAR 55 "-70". Chief among these are Euc. pilularis (Blackbutt), which on moderately
warm sites (Zone 1.6 c) exists in almost pure stands as in the Woolgoolga-Coffs Harbour,
and the Port Macquarie-Manning River belts. Euc. microcorys (Tallow-wood), Euc. saligna
(Blue Gum) and Euc. paniculata (Grey Ironbark) are also lovers of moisture on similar sites,


and with the non-eucalypt species Syncarpia laurifolia (Turpentine) attain noble proportions.
at times exceeding 150 ft. total height, exceeded occasionally by the other important non-
eucalypt hardwood Tristania conferta (Brush Box) (Zones 1.7 c, 1.8 c.).
The Spotted Gum on the other hand attains best development in the lower rainfall and
cooler sites of the South Coast (Zone 1.5 a).
The Eucalypt forest usually has an understory of Casuarina tondosa (Forest She Oak)
or Cas. suberosa (Black She Oak), and some Acacia spp. and other shrubs.
Along the coast line of the division are comparatively small areas of swamp and sand.
carrying mostly a more or less unimportant and often ill developed stand of Euc. rohusta
(Swamp Mahogany), E. planchoniana, Banksiaspp., and Casuarina glauca and mangrove in
the saltwater estuaries.
On the barren sandstones of the Clarence River and Hawkesbury River a very poor class
of inferior stunted eucalypts and angophora occur with many species of Acacia and a dense
ground cover of many shrubby plants. The principal eucalypts on the Hawkesbury area are
Euc. haemastoma (Scribbly Gum), and a depauperated form of Euc. corymhosa (Bloodwood)
and Euc. eximia (Yellow Bloodwood), also dwarf stringybark.
On the barren Clarence sandstones the principal species are Euc. planchoniana, Euc.
haileyana, E. bancrofti, E. tindalae, Angophora intermedia and Angophora bakeri, all of very
poor development.
A list of the principal Eucalypt species occuring in this division, together with their geo-
graphical and thermal range is hereunder

2. The brush type is composed of a multiplicity of species, mostly invaders from the Malayan
jungles.
The extent of this type dwindles quickly from the central to South Coast, ultimately covering
narrow strips along sheltered gullies at its southern limit?Zone 1.5b.
One species, a survivor of past temperate wet conditions attains large development in a few
select sites on the Coastal plateaux and on the crests of coast ranges. This species is Nothofagus
moorei ?the Negrohead Beech. It occurs intermittently, from north of the Hunter River to
the McPherson Range on the Queensland border, deteriorating to insignificant proportions
at its northern limit.
A total of about 200 species are found in this forest type. The principal; pecies are listed
below, classified in 5 groups, each of 3 sub-groups based on thermal range
This classification indicates the extent of range of any species.
It is apparent that the most widely distributed species is in Group 5. Eugenia smithii ,
the common Lilly-pilly has a thermal range 46� to 76� plus, MTCM, or more than 30�F,
geographically from Western Port (Victoria) to the tropics of Northern Queensland.
In group 4 Ehretia acuminata shows a range of 28� also extending well into the tropics.
The greatest number of species are comprised in Group 1, Sub-group C, with a thermal
range MTCM of 57�-b7�, geographically from
the Clarence River to Townsville.

2. The Highland Division:
Embracing the summit of and elevated country east and west of the Great Dividing Range
this division attains its greatest extent in the south adjoining and including the Australian
Alps, at elevations from about 2,000 ft. to 7,000 ft. Disappearing along the low western
watershed of the Hunter River for about 100 miles it reappears again with the northerly
trend of the Main Range near Nun die, and thence widens into the New England Tableland
with a width of up to about 120 miles.


In the north the division is mostly within Climatic Zones 3.4 a, 4.4 a, and 3.4b, with a small
extent of 1.3 a, indicating a cool climatic region of light to medium summer rainfall.
These conditions continue along the eastern side of the Main Divide through the Blue
Mountains locality to the Southern Tablelands south of Goulburn. Here drier conditions
intrude, culminating in the cold drought climate of Cooma with 10 dry months and?l 9"
MAR still within region of summer rains (Zone 7.3 c).
The cold Alps and cool western slopes with medium to heavy winter rains and summer
droughts, Zone 2.0 c to 2.4 a, and the light rain country Oberon to Taralga, Zone 2.3 a, and an
isolated patch at Orange, are the only exceptions to the summer rainfall regime.
The tree growth of this division is almost wholly Eucalyptian, the principal exceptions
being unimportant occurrences of Acacia spp. and Callitris spp. which appear throughout
The division comprises two types ;
(a) The Tableland type. Light rains. Principally within Zones 3.3 a, 34a, 4.4 a, 5.4 a,
and 7.3 c.
(6) The Upper Slope type. Medium to heavy rains. Mostly within Zones 2.0b, 2.0 c,
2.ibc, 2-3bc, 2-4ab and i-3ab, i.4ab, 3.4b and 4.4b
(a) The Tableland type within sub-zones 3 and 4 produces tree growth of generally poor-
development, and of little use commercially. The principal species with thermal range
are :

The Inland Division:
Note : Western limits of this division coincide with the approximate western limits of the
main Callitris glauca belt.
Within a region of light to very scanty rainfall, it embraces both winter and summer drought
regimes, also an even rainfall belt.
Within Zones 5, 6, 7 and 8, Sub-zones .4 and .6, 12 to 28 inches MAR
The winter drought region of this division produces fairly extensive stands of Ironbark
of commercial value. The most prevalent is Euc. crebra. (Narrow Leaf Ironbark); line, mclano-
phloia (Silver Leaf Ironbark) is more restricted in range. Occasional belts of Euc. sidcroxylon
(Red Ironbark) and Euc. caleyi occur, whilst Euc. nubilis (Red Ironbark) is rather plentiful
locally in Pilliga and Dubbo localities, reaching the limits of the winter drought region. (No
species of Ironbark except E. sidcroxylon occurs within a region of summer drought, and only
this species reaches good development where the MTCM is less than so�F.)
Many of the ? Boxes ? occur within this division. The species of this class which attains
best development under adverse conditions is Euc. pilligaensis, and planting of this species
is advisable. Other prevalent box trees with a wide range are, Euc. po puli folia (Bimble Box)
extending westward to 7" MAR, Euc. microcar pa (Grey Box), E. albeus (White Box) and
E. melliodora (Yellow Box) with much narrower range. E. bicolor (Black Box) also has a range
to the low rainfall areas, mostly on sites subjected to sporadic flooding, whilst E. restrain
(River Red Gum) has a still wider range, but clings to the banks of watercourses, and on the
naturally irrigated flats of the Murray River produces comparatively extensive pure stands
of commercial value.
Within this division with a limited range in the north the hardy Carbecn {Euc. icsscllaris)
appears and on suitable sites on alluvials attains splendid proportions. The bloodwoods of
drought-hardy type have a limited range in the northern part of the division, and are often
in association with Angophora; neither of these extend into the region of summer drought,
but are lovers of the summer rains; one Bloodwood {Euc. polycarpa ) attains fair development
in the 7" MAR belt.
* Confined to winter drought zone in south. f Confined to summer drought zone in south.


Many non-eucalyptian species are found within this division, most of them ranging to the
Western Division. One of them, Sterculia diversifolia (the Kurrajong) is of great value as a
fodder tree, and has been largely planted for ornament and shade and shelter. Its cultivation
should be extended. It occurs naturally as isolated trees or in very scattered stands of about
sor 6 per acre on highly favourable sites. It extends westward to the 10" MAR line and also
on to the selected dry sites on the Coastal division, but avoids cold.
Casuarina, especially C. cambagei, originally formed fairly extensive dense stands and C.
luehmanni appeared as a fairly plentiful species. Cas. cunninghamiana is found on the river
banks in cooler sites.
Many species of drought-hardy Acacias are prevalent, some in dense stands, like Ac. harpo-
phylla (Brigalow). Most non-eucalypts occurring are forage plants, and many have been
almost eliminated owing to careless lopping and direct felling for fodder purposes. Most
of these species are denizens of the summer rain region, but a few, such as Yarran (Ac. homa-
lophylla), Weeping Myall (Ac. pendula), Wilga (Geijera parvijiord), and Boonery (Heterodendron
oleaefolium ) extend throughout the dry areas of the summer drought region. Other non-
eucalypts will be mentioned under the Western Division heading.
By far the most valuable tree in the inland is Callitris glauca (White Cypress Pine). This.
species is distributed throughout the warmer parts of this division in both summer rain and
summer drought regions. It extends to the western limits of the State in a depauperate
form (6" MAR). It occurs in more or less scattered belts and often in dense stands when
immature. The most extensive existing belt is in the Pilliga, but only a remnant of the once
extensive stands now remain throughout its range.
The climatic controls for optimum sites of this species are :

The Western Division:
Comprises a climatic region of both summer rains and summer droughts. Warm and
arid, it is wholly within Zones 7.6 and 8.6. The rainfall indicator being a, b and c. The
region has a thermal range of 48�-53� MTCM with 6"-i5" MAR.
There is much treeless country covered with small mostly edible shrubs, Blue Bush, Salt
Bush, etc. There are also many small trees which if brought under the influence of more
favourable moisture conditions would probably attain considerably greater size and usefulness.
Most of the vegetation is edible for stock.
The Callitris glauca belt extends into this division about halfway to the Darling River
westerly from Cobar. Scattered.belts are found on the sand hills paralleling the Murray and
Darling Rivers. Acacia species predominate in the region of summer rains and Mallee
Eucalypts in the summer drought regions giving two clear-cut dominants, Mulga {Acacia
aneurd) in the north and the numerous Mallee species to the south; Belah, Boonery, Wilga,
are partial to both regions, but most of the Acacia spp., Leopard Wood (. Blindersia maculosa)
Beefwood ( Grevillea striata), Colaine or Gruie ( Owenia acidula ), Whitewood {Atalaya) prefer
the northern region, a few just struggling into the southern. Stragglers of Callitris are found
right to the western limits of the State, often associating with Beefwood, Whitewood and the
cosmopolitan Needlewood ( Hakea spp), Boonery and Yarran. Mulga (Ac. aneurd) has perhaps
the widest distribution in the northern area, but is small in size. Ironwood (Ac. excelsa),
Gidgee (Ac. cambagei) and Brigalow (Ac. harpophylla) attain fair dimensions, as does Beefwood,
Leopardwood and in favourable sites Colaine and Kurrajong; all with the exception of the
Leopardwood and Kurrajong are confined to the summer rain region. Leopardwood just
straggles into the summer drought region. Of the southern acacias, A. oswaldi (Boree) and
A. salicina (Willow Wattle) attain bed development, Yarran and Myall remaining small
in size. Numerous species of Eremophila, Cassia, etc., are distributed throughout the division
and the arboreal Myopo urn platycarpum is plentiful in the southern half. Of the Eucalypts
the south produces the oil bearing Mallees, which straggle from dense pure stands on favourable
sites to scattered individuals in parts of the summer rain region.
Bimbil Box (E. populifolia), mainly a northern species, and Black Box ( E . bicolor ), a southern
species, reach out to the 7" MAR, mostly in depressions, while the �biquitous E. rostrata
clings to the banks of watercourses. Euc. coolihah reaches well west in the northern region.
likewise E. polycarpa. Euc. intertexta is found on less arid sites, and Euc. melanophloia intrudes
slightly from the north in the io"-i2" MAR.

IV. APPLICATION OF HOMOCLIMES.
The fact of having homoclimes for any given place readily available is of great usefulness,
not only for forestry purposes but also for agriculture, and the establishment of new rural
industries?one of which already mooted is fur farming.
Architecture can likewise receive useful aids
Conditions of life obtaining within any selected climate with Australian homoclimes may be
studied, and the long and valuable experience gained by older settlements fully exploited in the
climatic counterparts of Australia.
The hacienda of Mexico and Texas and South California, with thick adobe walls and sheltered
inner court, and a surround of shade trees, introduced from Spain and modified to suit local
conditions, could well make living conditions in similar climates in Australia much more
acceptable, and certainly would be a great advance on many of the sweltering sheetiron and
timber shacks now seen.
Amenities for cold-country dwellings could be introduced from northern climates.
New crops may be introduced into selected areas, and suitable new species introduced for
afforestation work, and on the other hand by consulting the homoclimes, suitable Australian
species may be distributed abroad.
In the course of a recent investigation into the possibility of the fur-farming industry being
established in N.S.W., it was ascertained that the climate of the Southern Alps and their upper
western slopes was very similar to that of Christiansund, Norway, whilst the dry Monaro
Tablelands have a similar climatic trend to that of Oslo, Norway, and of Mystic Lake,
Montana. The production of high grade silver fox fur is quite possible in the Kosciusko region.
Homoclimes for fur farming possibilities hereunder.
There is a greater similarity between the climates of the selected New South Wales stations
and those of Norway, than those of Canada and U.S.A.

Generally, it may be stated that the Norwegian climates are to a greater extent similar
to the New South Wales station climates quoted.
The Canadian winters are longer and much more severe and the summers are hotter,
except along the west coast of British Columbia and in parts of Nova Scotia on the East,
The rainfall in the central Provinces of Canada is very scanty and the drought period is winter.
The Coastal Climate of British Columbia and part of Alaska is much milder and wetter, and
along here the dry period is in summer.
The coldest mainland Australian station is Hotham Heights (6,100 ft.) and this has very
close homoclimes in Juneau, Alaska, and Sitka, Alaska.
The climate of the snowy mountain region including its upper western slopes above 3,500 ft.
is very similar to Christiandsund and its environs in Norway, whil t the dry Monaro Tablelands
are similar in trend to the dry Oslo and other dry climates o Norway. The winters of the
select d N.S.W. stations at Cooma, Dalgety and Jindabyne, are 9 to 10 degrees warmer than the
Norwegian Stations.
Mystic Lake (6,545 ft ) in Montana also possesses a climate very similar to that of Oslo, Norway.
Introduction of New Species.
Consulting the New South Wales homoclimes it is evident that the undermentioned are a
few of the exotic species which should respond satisfactorily, if introduced into the localities
mentioned, in order of prefer nee : ??
Cork Oak ( Quercus sober) . From Spain, Tumut-Tumbarumba to Albury districts.
Portugal and Algeria.
American Hickory (. Hickoriae spp.) ... Hanging Rock, Dorrigo, Kurrajong, Moss
Vale.
Parana Pine {Araucaria brazilensis) , Yerba Eastern Dorrigo, Coast Range at Wool-
Mate {llex Paraguay ensis), Quebracho goolga and Coff?s Harbour. MacPherson
{Schinopsis lorentzii) {Schinopsis hal- Range. Mf. Pikapene, Banyabba.
sansae). From Brazil and Argentine.
Chilean Pine {Araucaria imhricata)
Grafton, Narrabri.
Bago and Jounama S.F?s. Billapaloola,,
Wee Jasper S.F?s
Alerce ( Fiizroya paiagonica), Cedar {Libo- Bago and Jounama S.F?s
cedrus chilensis) {Drimys winteri) {Drimys
chilensis). From Chile.
Chestnut {Casianea saliva) From Southern Red Hills?Murraguldrie and Carabost
Europe. S.F?s.
Pinus taeda, Pinus caribea ... ... Casino to Coff?s Harbour.
Pinus radiaia. From California ... ... South-eastern Riverina.
Cricket Bat Willow {Salix caerulea). From Bombala, Wallerawang, Moss Vale, Green
South-eastern England. Hills, Tumut-Tumbarumba districts.
Poplars {Populus tremula, and Populus spp.) Same localities as Salix and in Hunter
From southern U.S.A., etc. Valley for river banks.
English Ash {Fraxinus excelsior) ... ... Same localities as Salix.
American Oaks {Quercus spp.). From Texas. In Hunter Valley.
English Beech and Birch Bombala-Tumbarumba, Moss Vale, Mt
Royal and Wallerawang.
Spruce {Picea sitchensis). From N. Cali- Bombala-Tumbarumba, Moss Vale, Wal-
fornia and Oregon. Douglas Fir and lerawang, and Mt. Royal.
Redwood.
Rock Maple {Acer saccarinum) ... ... Jounama S.F.
Page 21


Introduction of new crops : Again consulting N.S.W. homoclimesof regions abroad, the suitable
placing of new crops is simplified.
Thus flax from the great flax growing country in Armagh, Northern Ireland, should flourish
in the Wallerawang and Oberon Districts.
Pyrethrum from Japan could be planted at Moss Vale, and
Pyrethrum from Albania should be experimented with in Tumut, Adelong Districts.
The best coffee in Brazil is produced in a climate approaching that of the Eastern Dorrigo-
Woolgoolga-Coff?s Harbour Districts.
