PEEFACE.
Fok the benefit of extra-colonial readers, it is deemed advisable
to introduce the following pages with a few words of explanation.
It would be unkind to them, perhaps, to let them go stumbling over
such expressions as “ Goyder’s Valuations,” “Column A,” “Column
B,” “ Small Blocks,” &c., without the slightest warning beforehand.
Then be it known to them, that in the year 1851 the Squatters of
South Australia, who had hitherto occupied the Waste Lands of
the Colony under annual licenses, were raised to the dignity of
Crown Tenants by having fourteen years’ leases issued to them at
a rental of 10s. per mile. In those days the “ bush” was so slightly
appreciated that any one who would undergo the hardship of
living in it was made welcome to all that he could make from it.
But after the gold diggings there came a change. The South
Australians, almost to a man, joined in the “rush,” and were
generally fortunate. They made a good deal of money and brought
it home to invest in land. As a natural consequence the value of
land rose, and the value of produce, both agricultural and pastoral
rose with it. From insignificant outsiders, always in danger and as
often in difficulty, the Squatters were suddenly changed into a
prosperous and powerful class. In 1858 the question was x’aised
whether they ought not to have to render some kind of thank-
offering to the State for their prosperity. An annual assessment
of 2d. per head on their sheep was suggested as not too much for
them to give nor too little for the State to accept. At first they set
their backs to their fourteen years’ leases and denied that the
Government had any right to interfere with them. After many
discussions in Parliament, and an enquiry by a Select Committee,
the Government thought fit to try a new line of policy; they said
to the Squatters, “ Submit to the assessment for the remainder of
your leases, and, as a quid pro quo, we promise you a renewal for
five years at a valuation” Had the leases expired at the end of
the original period they were to have been put up at auction. The
Squatters saw the advantage of the new plan and agreed to pay the
price for it. In 1864, when the fourteen years’ leases were within
a year of expiring, the Government sent round their Surveyor


General to the runs to make a preliminary estimate of their value
with a view to the renewals. His first reports were sent in while
Parliament was in session. Before the Government had resolved,
how to deal finally with his valuations, and whether they would
grant the lessees an opportunity to appeal against them, an officious
senator, evidently very young in the ways of responsible Govern-
ment, moved that Mr. Goyder’s reports be laid before the House -
after some suspicious demurring, which only aggravated the
curiosity of the Assembly, this unconstitutional request was complied
with. The reports were produced, and it was discovered to tlie-
astonishment of all that Mr. Goyder proposed to raise the rentals
more than nine-fold, namely, from about 40s. a mile to £lB or £2O
a mile. His Column A represented the gross annual value of the
runs, improvements included. In Column B the runs were
estimated according to grazing capacity only, allowing so much a
year off, during the five years, as would, taken altogether, reim-
burse the lessees for their improvements. It was violently discussed
in the Assembly which of the two should be adopted, the £2O a
mile scale or the £ls a mile. At the same time the colony was
agitated from end to end about the safety of the valuations, “ They
must be adopted,” shouted Demos, “ Goyder for ever!” At last reason
prevailed so far as to secure the adoption of Column B instead of
Column A, and on this basis many of the valuations have been
Gazetted by the Government. The Squatters are accepting them
under protest, for, with many thousands of sheep to provide for, they
must retain their runs for a time at least. So far as they are con-
cerned the dispute is at an end, but that we have not seen the last
of its consequences I have endeavoured to prove in the following
pages. Our system of Waste Lands management is glaringly im-
perfect compared with those of the neighbouring colonies. It
makes no distinct provision for the protection of lessees’ improve-
ments. It lays down no distinct principle of valuation. It furnishes-
no uniform, well-understood mode of appeal. In all these respects
we have retrograded under the auspices of our local legislature,
and the recent valuations show that a reform of some kind is-
imperatively necessary.

OUR WOOL STAPLE:
THE HISTORY OE SQUATTING IN SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
INTRODUCTION.
We will frankly acknowledge that this Pamphlet owes its existence
to the squatting contest which for several months back has convulsed
this colony. Hitherto the question has been treated both in Par-
liament and out of it chiefly as a party question, but it would say
little for the intelligence and justice of the community were it
allowed to be finally decided on that and no other ground. There
remains a much more important point of view from which it ought
to be considered, namely, in its bearings on the future prosperity
and progress of the colony. It were a foolish and reckless policy
indeed, to disorganize —it may be for years —one of our chief sources
of production, for no better reason than that the producers are an
unpopular class, and therefore fair game for legislative oppression.
Common prudence ought to teach our legislators that not only the
fortunes of the squatters, but also, to a serious extent, the fortunes
of the country are at stake on the equitable readjustment of the
Pastoral Leases. It is not a subject to be shuttlecocked in Parlia-
ment, or dodged through at the tail of a casual majority —to be
spoiled the one year and mended the next, or patched up in a
promiscuous way at the convenience or humour of honourable
members; but it is a subject in which one false step may entail
wide-spread disaster both on individuals and on the country at
large. If it is to be justly treated all the information that can be
drawn from our own past history, from the example cf the ncigh-


homing colonies, and from the opinions of the ablest professional
authorities on such questions, ought to be brought to bear upon it.
An aim of this kind, disinterested in the highest degree—for the
writer has no connection whatever either with the Squatters or
with their official and editorial adversaries—has given rise to the
present publication. He has no private or preconceived opinions
of his own to urge, but only desires to call attention to certain-
important circumstances which have hitherto been strangely over-
looked, and ought therefore to be made known before the contest is
finally closed.
CHAPTER I.
THE NEW VALUATIONS CONTEASTED WITH THE FUNDAMENTAL
PEINCIPLES OP THE COLONY.
If our legislators really appreciated the magnitude and hazard
of the enterprise upon which they are entering, they would be
disposed to seek advice from those who have trod the same path
before them. For South Australians, nothing can be more
natural than to consult with fondness their own past history, which
in rapidity of progress and substantial prosperity knows no rival.
After what the fundamental principles of the colony have done for
us, it would be rash indeed to throw them overboard before they
had been much longer than a quarter of a century in operation.
There is not an intelligent colonist here but is proud of the fact
that South Australia was the first colony formed on Wakefield’s
system. That system carefully revised and modified in practice by
men of enterprising genius has produced the results we now see
around us—a population of over a hundred and fifty thousand—
among whom wealth is more equally distributed, habits of industry
more prevalent, the standard of morality higher, and the comforts
of life more widely diffused, than almost anywhere else in the world.
The men who could accomplish such a work have been no mere
theorists nor newspaper agitators. They were correct in their
views as to the propriety of selling land at a uniform price ; they
were further correct in the method they adopted for giving im-


mediate value to the land by importing labour; but their sagacity
was best shown in the due application and proportionment of
capital to the former two elements. It was a grand economical as
well as political experiment, and its success is conspicuous in every
phase of our national life. Our agriculture proves it, our mining in-
dustry proves it, and so does our commerce. Hitherto our wool trade
has been among the most prominent proofs, but a disastrous change
threatens it. Ere the die is cast we would ask a hearing for those to
whose sagacity, combined with our own perseverance, we owe our
past success. We ought not to take the benefit of their advice on a
few points and ignore it on others. If on some their teaching has
led to success, they merit at least our consideration on others. The
policy which has reared a class of independent farmers like those of
South Australia, may also answer with other classes of producers ;
and surely, as simple citizens, all are alike entitled to its benefits.
The system must be treated as a whole, and after having adopted so
beneficially all that relates to the disposal of land in fee , we may
notice how it proposed to deal with tvaste lands. Fortunately
this part of the subject has been specially treated by Wakefield
himself in one of his latest works, “A View of the Art of Coloniza-
tion,” published in 1849. At that time squatting was a very
insignificant institution compared with what it has since become,
but its ultimate importance was clearly foreseen by him, and his
opinion as an impartial scientific observer was that it should be
encouraged to the utmost. His words are—“ According to the
principles of their theory (those who in 1830 projected the figst
scheme for colonizing South Australia) the natural pasturages of a
colony, which nature has freely given, the colonists should use
without let or hindrance of any kind from their Government, and
moreover their Government ought to afford them every facility in
its power for making the most of that natural advantage. It
behoves the Government, therefore, to frame a set of laws for the
disposal of the natural pasturage in New South Wales or New
Zealand—laws which shoidd provide facilities instead of obstacles.
Such laws woidd establish a perfect liberty of choice by the flock-
masters themselves, together with certainty and stability in the whole
proceeding. The laivs of our colonies on this subject would almost


seem to have been designed to check colonial prosperity by means of
direct obstacles, and by giving to the tchole process a character of
uncertainty and instability. This of course was not really the aim
of these bureaucratic labours ; but such is the result of ignorance
and carelessness in the mode of imposing on the pastoral colonies
the most objectionable of taxes." Elsewhere in the same chapter
he says :—“ But if the abundance of natural pasturage thus fur-
nishes an additional reason for working out completely, and on the
greatest possible scale, the principle of a sufficient price for freehold
land, what shall we say of the policy of the colonial office and its
official instruments in the colonies, ivho put a price on the use of
natural pasturage for no other reason but that of getting money out
of the settlers? The prosperity of New South Wales, for example,
is wholly dependent on the use of vast tracts of natural pasturage.
With labour as dear, and as scarce at whatever price, as it is in
New South Wales, the production of fine wool at a cost not
involving loss would be utterly impossible without the aid of
nature in supplying the sheep with food. The woolgrowers of
New South Wales, therefore, who formerly got the use of the
pasturage for nothing, must still get it or be ruined. As they have
no choice between getting it and being ruined , their Government , being
despotic , can make them pay for it as much as they can afford to pay.
Short of paying more than they can afford —more, that is, than
their occupation would leave, after replacing capital with some
profit —they cannot help paying whatever their Government chooses
to require. This absolute necessity of paying, in order to preserve
the staple business of the colony, renders the imposition of a price
on the use of natural pasturage a remarkably facile and pleasant
sort of taxation —facile and pleasant, that is, for a Government
which has no sympathy with its subjects. As regards the subjects,
this is a most unwise and oppressive tax — unwise, as it is a tax on the
article of primest necessity of New South Wales life; oppressive, as
it was imposed and is maintained in spite of every kind of complaint
and opposition from the colonists.” In a crisis like the present it
is gratifying to find that Wakefield’s manly expostulations were
not without effect on the Colonial Office. Very soon after, the
system he here condemns was abolished, and a new set of waste


lands regulations issued, for general application to the Australian
Colonies. Under these the leases of 1851 were granted, and
considering the circumstances of their origin, we have more reason
than ever to doubt whether our Colonial Government have acted
prudently in setting them aside after only a fourteen years trial.
In the recent Parliamentary discussions the anti-squatting party
could not condescend to speak in civil terms of the orders in
Council—“ Pooh! pooh ! they are obsolete, out of date, Goyder
has done away with them, let us stick to the Valuations!” —but
more wonderful things have happened than that they should have
to take in sail a bit and retrace their steps, we do not say how far.
Even allowing that the orders in Council are technically superseded,
the Imperial Act for the regulation of the Waste Lands is still in
force. If they do not advance with caution they may run their
heads against that ancient difficulty of theirs— the validity of local
acts ! It serves our present purpose, however, to have shown what
were the opinions of scientific men like Wakefield on this subject.
It is not too much to say that he understood its nature and im-
portance fully as well as the legislatorial editors of our own day,
who can only oppose personal spite, backed by the envy of the
lower orders to Wakefield’s acknowledged experience and sagacity.
CHAPTER 11.
RISE AND PROGRESS OF THE WOOL TRADE.
The early settlers in South Australia enjoyed the full benefit of
the liberal views described in the preceding chapter. At first no
definite charge was made for the right of pasturage, but a small
annual tax of lOd. per score was levied by the local Government.
To many of the settlers squatting became a necessary alternative,
for the surveys proceeded so slowly at first that it was quite
uncertain when sufficient land would be ready for them to select
from. In desperation they got together a few sheep and set out
with them into the bush, settling down on patriarchal principles


wherever they found a place to suit them. But this was by no
means the commencement of troubles with the sheep. It had been
a very difficult and precarious undertaking to import them first of
all into the colony. Private enterprise could not have accomplished
this thoroughly for years had it been left to itself. The South
Australian Company, however, with most comprehensive foresight,
included this in its programme. Through the agency of a
Tasmanian sheepholder, they obtained from Saxony a very fine lot
of rams and ewes of the purest Merino breed, which were shipped
in the Lady Mary Pelham , the third vessel that sailed for the
colony. The Emma , her immediate successor, called at the Cape
for cattle, sheep, and goats, which had been selected there by the
Company’s agents. After their arrival several of the Company’s
vessels were employed in conveying sheep from Tasmania, and a
very poor speculation it was, for about 2,000 of them died on the
voyage. Afterwards an overland route from New South Wales was
discovered, and the necessity for importing stock by sea consequently
removed. Thus, by the exertion of rare enterprise and perseverance
in the face of many difficulties and discouragements, was the
foundation of our wool trade laid in barren wastes where no
European had ever trod before.
The first squatters paid for their few sheep about 50s. to 90s. per
Bead on an average, and went out into the wilderness, no man
asking them whither they went. _ They had to settle for their rents
with the natives, and the wild dogs, and the kangaroos, in an ir-
regular kind of way, which had also its advantages when compared
with the modern civilized system of Mr. Goyder. At all events
they had a natural Court of Appeal against their savage persecutors,
and that is what they do not have now.
By degrees order was established among the promiscuous popu-
lation of the settled parts ; some made money and many lost it in
the land-jobbing fever which seized the young colony ; then they
all betook themselves to honest industry, each in his own depart-
ment, and Government got time to make regulations for the
squatters. The system then in force in New South Wales, that
of annual licenses, was adopted. There were two kinds of them :
Ist. Depasturing licenses for those who possessed purchased land,


and wished to depasture their stock on the waste lands adjacent
to it; these cost 10s. 6d. per annum. 2nd. Occupation licenses
for those who had no purchased land, and required not only-
pasturage but the right to form stations and erect buildings on the
waste lands they occupied; these cost £o per annum. The
chief object of the then Government was to promote and secure, by
every means in their power, the ultimate prosperity of the colony.
They carefully avoided everything like a forced growth, or a
precocious development, but wished first to make a secure founda-
tion by attaching the people to the soil and opening up natural
channels for the employment of capital. It was objected to them
at the time that they might have draAvn more money from the sales
of land, and urged on the growth of the local revenue faster tham
they did, but such would have been contrary to the principles of
the settlement. These required that all natural advantages of the
colony should be for the good of the colonists, not for the good of
the Government. The land was to be disposed of on moderate fixed
terms, and the purchasers or lessees were to have full liberty to
make the most they could out of it. Individual enterprise never
had a fairer field to exercise itself in, for it was not only unrestrained,
but the more it exerted itself the more it was encouraged. The
squatters shared only the common fate in being allowed to do the
best they could for themselves. They imported, and crossed, and
improved, and thereby contributed to the general progress, each in
his own way. Statistics prove beyond cavil what the results of
this policy were. Whether we consider the increase of stock, or
of the annual exports of wool —both as to weight and money value
—we can clearly trace the significant circumstance that the rate of
progress has ahvays been materially influenced by the terms of the
squatters' leases. With moderate rents and certainty of tenure the
wool trade made rapid strides from year to year. AN hen either of
these conditions were impaired, a manifest decline ensued. To-
this proposition we shall apply three distinct tests by analysing
—First, the yearly returns of stock; second, the annual exports of
wool, as regards quantity ; and third, the annual exports, as regards
money value.
Ist. Increase of Stock. —In the second year of the colony the


number of sheep was 28,000. Next year the number was 108,700,
showing an increase of 286 per cent. In 1840 the number was
200,600, increase 85 per cent. In 1841 the number was 242,055,
increase 21 per cent. In 1843 the number was somewhere about
350,000, increase in two years 45 per cent., annually 22| per cent.
We do not wish to lay particular stress on these early years of the
colony, as everything was then in an abnormal state, and the wool
trade, like everything else, had yet to find its natural level.
From this point onwards we may calculate on a regular rate of
progress, influenced only by internal causes. We shall therefore
arrange the subsequent years in periods, distinguished from each
other by the more or less favourable circumstances in. which the
squatters were then placed. From 1843 to 1846 was a good time,
licenses cheap and grass abundant. This may explain how stock
came to be doubled in that comparatively short period, having
risen from 350,000 in 1843 to 700,000 in 1846 ; the total increase
was 100 per cent., or per cent, annually. Between 1846 and
1850 the scene changes, and at the end of that term appears much
less hopeful. Colonel Robe took the same view of squatting as o\ir
present Government, and gave it a squeeze occasionally for the
benefit of the exchequer. His most arbitrary measure was to
increase the depasturing rates from Is. to Is. 6d. per annum, but
bye and bye he saw that his semi-military law did not suit the
colony, and he had the good sense to rejoin his regiment. The evil
was done, however, and the consequences appeared in due time.
Between 1846 and 1850 the number of sheep increased only from
700,000 to 1,000,009, or 43 per cent, in four years, being 10| per
cent, yearly. July, 1851, marks a new era both for the squatters
and for the country. The first Constitution had just been received,
and with it came the new' Waste Lands Regulations for all the
colonies, which Wakefield had advocated in the extract we have
given. The first batch of leases issued under them w r ere dated
July, 1851, and henceforth the Squatters were to be tenants of the
Crown. Hitherto they had been living in a state of pastoral
vagrancy, wandering to and fro over the country, sheltering them-
selves in huts, and with no legal status but W'hat their yearly
payment of £5 for a licence might entitle them to. Now they were


to be accredited cultivators of wool, fixed down to particular
locations, and subjected to rentals proportioned to tlie area of their
runs.
Considering that they were now brought into direct relationship
with the State, and were to have a qualified certainty of tenure, the
terms demanded were not too hard—l Cs. per square mile per
annum on a lease of fourteen years. They were satisfied, and
forthwith commenced to prosecute their business with renewed
vigour. Houses were built, wells dug, fencing erected, and im-
provements of every kind projected, just as men would naturally do
when they had an assurance that they would be permitted quietly
to enjoy the fruit of their labours. The impulse given to the
culture of wool was such that during the first five years of the new
system the annual rate of increase rose from lOf per cent, to 15J
per cent. At the end of 1856 there were in the colony 1,962,460
sheep, showing a gross increase since 1851 of 860,000. The last
period we have to notice is that between 1'856 and the present year
One change took place in that period, and it was a retrograde
movement, productive of corresponding effects. In 1858 an assess-
ment of twopence per sheep per annum was imposed, which no
doubt benefited the exchequer, but at the expense of national pro-
gress. From 1856 to 1863 inclusive the rate of increase was 14 per-
cent. yearly, or 98 per cent, in the seven years; the number of
sheep in 1856 having been 1,962,460, and in 1863 3,891,642. It
will be remembered that the rate of increase between 1850 and
1856 was 151 per cent, yearly.
2nd. Increase in the money value of the wool exports. —The value of
the wool exported in 1838 is stated at the modest sum of £770.
In 1840 the value had risen to £8,740, an increase of 1,100 per-
cent. in two years, or 550 per cent, yearly. In 1841 it was
£35,485, increase 310 per cent. In 1843 it was £45,568,.
increase 28 per cent, in two years, or 14 per cent, yearly. This
sudden and extensive retrogression must be ascribed to the first
crisis in the colony, occasioned by the dishonouring of Colonel
Gawler’s drafts on the Commissioners. On emerging from this
crisis, we enter on the normal state of progress before referred to.
Between 1843 and 1846—namely, in three years—the value of our


wool exports rose from £45,568 to £106,510, increase 135 per
cent., or 45 per cent, yearly. In 1850 the exports had risen to
£131,731, showing an increase on the previous four years of only
23 per cent., or 5f per cent, yearly, which does not say much for
Colonel Robe’s patronage of squatting. Contrast this with what
took place in the first six years after the leasing system commenced.
In 1856 our exports of wool were estimated at £412,163, increase
on the six years 216 per cent., or 36 per cent, yearly, about seven
times as high as the rate of increase on the four years preceding
the adoption of the leases ! If the much-decried measure of 1851,
the pepper-corn rent system as it is now called, is to be judged by
its economic results, it has been a blessing to the country as well as
to the squatters. In consequence of it, the increase of stock which
'had formerly been proceeding at the rate of lOf per cent, yearly
rose to 15J per cent., and the increase in value of wool exported
rose from 5£ per cent, yearly to 36 per cent. If the Government
had been more exacting, it is doubtful whether they would have
greatly increased their revenue, though on the other hand it is
certain that the productive powers of the country, encouraged by
their moderation, improved to the extent of £260,000 a year. Had
the liberality now so highly condemned not been exercised, and the
squatters continued their old rate of progress, instead of having
(produced £1,230,000 worth of wool between 1851 and 1856, they
would not have exceeded £850,000 worth. The alteration made
in 1858 tells the same tale with regard to the increase of exports as
with resrard to the increase of stock—both were obviouslv retarded
O *
by it. In the seven years between 1856 and 1863 inclusive the
-value of wool exported rose from £412,163 to £715,935, being an
increase of nearly 75 per cent., or 10| per cent, per annum; whereas
the annual rate of increase on the preceding six years had been 36
per cent, per annum.
It may be objected to this mode of comparison that variations in
the price of wool were to some extent the cause of these alterna-
tions in the rate of increase. But our first table is not open to that
objection, nor will the third be, namely, that based on the quantities
of wool exported in each year.
3rd. Increase in the quantity of our wool exports. —ln 1841 the


quantity of wool exported was 641,825 lbs. In 1843 it was
1,159,574 lbs., increase on the two years 78 per cent., or 29 per
cent, yearly. Between 1843 and 1846 the quantity rose to
2,042,195 lbs., increase 76 per cent, on the three years, or per
cent, yearly. This may be set down as a fair normal rate, and the
other periods judged by it as their common standard. In 1851 the
quantity exported was 3,694,017 lbs., showing an increase of 80
per cent, on the five years, or 16 per cent, yearly. In 1856 the
quantity exported was 8,236,221 lbs., increase 125 per cent, on
the five years, or 25 per cent, per annum, clearly proving the
superiority of moderate rentals and certainty of tenure over Colonel
Robe’s system. In 1863 the quantity exported was 15,566,787 lbs,,
increase since 1856 88 per cent., or 12 4-7ths per cent, yearly
under half the rate of the previous period; in other words,
allowing fully 12 per cent, for the pernicious influence of the
assessment of 1858.
To the mind of a true statesman the relation of cause and effect
between such a striking series of coincidences as this would be
suggested at once. There is a perfect analogy to the circumstances
on which Sir Robert Peel based his theory of financial reform —low
duties encouraging consumption, and always yielding more in the
end than high duties which discouraged consumption. Here we
have moderate rentals encouraging production and high rentals
retarding it. What might be the consequence when a
further rise, not of 300 per cent., as in 1858, but of 3,000
per cent, on the original rentals takes place, it is not
difficult to conceive. The fate of the Spanish silver mines
in South America might teach our legislators a lesson if they
would take the trouble to consult Adam Smith on the subject. The
royalties exacted by the Spanish Government were so high as to
prevent all but the richest mines being worked, consequently so
high as to defeat the selfish aims of the exactors, and diminish very
materially the revenue they could have acquired by fair means.
They were compelled to reduce the royalty first from a half to a
third, then to a fifth, and finally to a tenth. Thus were they pun-
ished by a rod of their own making, but who can estimate the
additional loss to their country from the tardy appropriation of the


boundless wealth which lay buried in the treasure vaults of Peru ?
And would our popular Government emulate for us the fate of
Spain? Does it prefer the short-sighted selfishness of the
Bourbons to all the liberal principles of economy which modern
science urges on their attention ? Then let the squatters be taxed
to the very uttermost, our wool trade repressed and crippled by
those who fail to appreciate its importance, and the millions of
acres of waste lands in the colony be left barren and useless only
that the official rent-roll may swell to unprecedented greatness.
Some of our legislators can see nothing more in squatting than a
business which has made many people rich, and consequently able
to stand bleeding by the taxgatherer. If they would only try for
a moment to comprehend its national bearings, to observe how
sensative it is notwithstanding its magnitude and show, how great
an effect the slightest interference with its natural course has upon
it, how inextricably interwoven it is with all the other industries
of the colony which must advance or retrograde along with it, how
many thousands besides the squatters are directly dependent upon
it, and how difficult a task it will be to restore it should it once
become disorganized—were they to take all these facts into
account there would be less haphazard legislation on the subject.
The lesson which our past history teaches us is quite the reverse
of what editorial demagogues day by day din into our ears. And
now for the example of our neighbours.
CHAPTER 111.
THE WASTE LANDS REGULATIONS OF THE OTHER COLONIES
CONTRASTED WITH OUR OWN.
Prudence as well as justice requires a comparison of this kind to
be made, for if it should prove to be the case that we are forcing
up our terms out of proportion with those of our neighbours then
they must inevitably reap the advantage of our folly in the long-
run. It is true that twenty or thirty thousand sheep cannot be re-
moved in a day, or at a day’s notice, but like all other kinds of

Even though all now in the colony were to remain, and our
squatting interest to be able to maintain its footing, what margin
have we left for progress, or what inducement do we offer to it ?
Let us compare Goyder’s fifteen pounds per mile (a tanner
an acre , as it stands in the vernacular), or eighteenpence per
sheep, with the scale of rent charges in Victoria, New South
Wales, and Queensland. For Victoria I take the Act of 1862,
which has been somewhat modified during the present session of
Parliament, but not materially, nor to the disadvantage of the
certain number of sheep or cattle for every hundred acres com-
prised therein.” When the valuation has been completed, a notice
of the amount of rent to be paid in respect of each run is to be in-
serted in the Government Gazette , and if not appealed against
within two months after such publication is to be considered bind-
ing on the occupier. If the latter wishes to appeal he has only to
send a notice to the Board, naming the person whom he wishes to
act as arbitrator on his behalf, and depositing fifty pounds as a
security for the costs of the appeal. Clause 88 regulates
the mode of arbitration. “ Every such appeal shall be


boundless wealth which lay buried in the treasure vaults of Peru ?
And would our popular Government emulate for us the fate of
Spain? Does it prefer the short-sighted selfishness of the
Bourbons to all the liberal principles of economy which modern
science urges on their attention ? Then let the squatters be taxed
to the very uttermost, our wool trade repressed and crippled by
those who fail to appreciate its importance, and the millions of
acres of waste lands in the colony be left barren and useless only
that the official rent-roll may swell to unprecedented greatness.

CHAPTER 111.
THE WASTE LANDS REGULATIONS OF THE OTHER COLONIES
CONTRASTED WITH OUR OWN,
Prudence as well as justice requires a comparison of this kind to
be made, for if it should prove to be the case that we are forcing
up our terms out of proportion with those of our neighbours then-
they must inevitably reap the advantage of our folly in the long-
run. It is true that twenty or thirty thousand sheep cannot be re-
moved in a day, or at a day’s notice, but like all other kinds of


capital they must gradually be drawn towards the best market.
Even though all now in the colony were to remain, and our
squatting interest to be able to maintain its footing, what margin
have we left for progress, or what inducement do we offer to it ?
Let us compare Goyder’s fifteen pounds per mile (a tanner
an acre , as it stands in the vernacular), or eighteeupence per
sheep, with the scale of rent charges in Victoria, New South
Wales, and Queensland. For Victoria I take the Act of 1862,
which has been somewhat modified during the present session of
Parliament, but not materially, nor to the disadvantage of the
squatters. With regard to rentals, the only alteration made by the
Act of 1865 is, that if in any case the Board of Land and Works,
or the lessee of a run, should be dissatisfied with the estimate of the.
grazing capacity on which the rental is fixed, they or he may apply
to the Supreme Court for an order without costs that the said esti-
mate may be resubmitted to arbitration,— (Clause 57, Land Act
of 1865. y As to runs already occupied the Act of 1862 prescribes
(clause 80) that yearly licences shall continue to be issued to the
existing occupiers, and that “ the rent (clause 83) to be paid by every
such licensee for his run shall be at the rate of eiyhtpence for every
sheep, or two shillings for every head of cattle which it shall be
determined to be capable of carrying by the Board of Land and
Works, or where the determination of such Board shall he disputed
hy the arbitrators hereinafter mentioned .” In determining the
carrying capability the Board is to “ divide all runs into four
classes, according to their grazing capabilities, each class including
those runs which shall be estimated to be capable of carrying a
certain number of sheep or cattle for every hundred acres com-
prised therein.” When the valuation has been completed, a notice
of the amount of rent to be paid in respect of each run is to be in-
serted in the Government Gazette , and if not appealed against
within two months after such publication is to be considered bind-
ing on the occupier. If the latter wishes to appeal he has only to
send a notice to the Board, naming the person whom he wishes to
act as arbitrator on his behalf, and depositing fifty pounds as a
security for the costs of the appeal. Clause 88 regulates
the mode of arbitration. “ Every such appeal shall be


decided by three arbitrators, or the majority of them, one
of such arbitrators to be appointed by the said Board, the
second by the person appealing or his agent, and the third by the
Judge of the County Court holden nearest to the principal building
on the run.” On the subject of granting compensation for im-
provements, the law in Victoria stands thus (clause 110): —“If
the occupier of any run not being part of the lands reserved for
proclamation in agricultural areas shall after the passing of this
Act wish to erect any substantial fence, or to make any permanent
reservoir of wtiter on such run, he may apply to the said Board for
permission so to do; and if they are of opinion that such erection
or making will conduce to the more profitable occupation of the
run for pastoral purposes, they may grant such application, and
cause the same to be registered in a book to be kept for the pur-
pose, and such occupier may, within three months after the com-
pletion of such fence or reservoir, make before a Justice a declara-
tion in the form or to the effect contained in the 9th schedule
hereto, and transmit the same to the said Board, and in case any
portion of the run on which such fence or reservoir, or any part
thereof shall he situated, shall he thereafter proclaimed a common, cr
a reserve for any public purpose whatsoever, or he leased under this
Act, he shall he entitled to receive out of the public revenue, or if such
portion shall be sold, out of the purchase-money, as hereinafter
provided, the value of such fence or reservoir at the time such portion
of the run shall he so proclaimed, or shall he leased or sold.”
Leases of unoccupied country or of forfeited runs are to be dealt
with in the following manner: —The “ small block” principle is
countenanced in so far as the maximum size of such runs is re-
stricted to an extent which “ will be sufficient according to the
estimate of the said Board to carry, all the year round, five
thousand sheep, or one thousand two hundred and fifty head of
cattle.” (Clause 98.) The amount of rent is then to be fixed by
the Board for any period not exceeeding fourteen years, and the
lease put up to auction, after due notice, in the same manner as is
enacted with regard to land to be sold in fee-simple. Whoever
bids the highest sum for it by way of premium obtains the lease ;
but if there be no bidders at such auction the Board may reduce


the amount of rent, and re-expose the lease to auction as before.
Apart from the very great difference in rent (eightpence against
our eighteenpence), the Victorian squatter has more indulgence in
the use of his run. Clause 104 provides that “ every licensed
occupier of a run for pastoral purposes may cultivate so much of
the run as may be. necessary to provide such grain, hay, vegetables,
or fruit, as may he required for the use and supply of his family
and establishment.” We look in vain through this Act for any
clause corresponding to our “ six months’ notice.” The relations
of the farmer to the squatter are more considerately maintained by
the proclamation of agricultural areas, within which all may
exercise the right of selection. Beyond the areas so proclaimed,
the squatter can vegetate in peace with nothing to fear from
Surveyor or Valuator, Clause 13. “The Board of Land and
Works shall from time to time cause to he surveyed agricultural
areas taken from the aforesaid lands, and such areas shall he as
much as possible in defined and extensive districts, and not in iso-
lated or scattered portions, and shall be surveyed in allotments of
not less than forty nor more than six hundred and forty acres.”
The principal points in which I conceive the Victorian system to
be superior to our own are ;
I. A moderate and uniform rental—eightpence per head instead
of our rough average of eighteenpence per head.
11. A regular and permanent mode of appeal which gives to the
appellant the right of appointing a representative. The Board of
Land and Works is superior to our single Commissioner, who
comes in to-day, and goes out to-morrow, while the decision of
three arbitrators must of necessity he more trustworthy than the
bare dictum of Mr. Goyder.
111. The liberal and straightforward plan of granting compensa-
tion for improvements. The Victorian squatter has this natural
right expressly guaranteed to him by the Act under which his
lease is issued, whereas the South Australian squatter must first
ran the risk of obtaining no compensation at all; then should he
get it contemptuously thrown at him, it is accompanied with cries
from Parliament of “See how generous we are!” and from the
anti-squatting public of “ See what another big sop for the
squattocracy! ”


IV.—Greater certainty of tenure. If the squatter happens to
keep in his own place in Victoria—namely, outside the agricultural
areas; he may go on ever so long without molestation. But
here he has always the six months’ notice to quit hanging like the
sword of Damocles over his head. Ido not mean to denounce that
regulation as pernicious, or even unnecessary; but every one may
see for himself that it greatly diminishes the commercial value of the
squatters' leases. Even if Goyder’s valuations were admitted to be
reasonable in themselves, when this drawback is taken into consi-
deration they cease to be so.
Now we come to New South Wales, whose present Crown
Lands Act bears date 1861. It divides Crown lands into two
classes —first class settled districts ; and second class settled dis-
tricts which latter also includes the unsettled parts. In the former,
only annual leases are granted, and these when once obtained “ may
be renewed annually by payment between the first and thirtieth
day of September to the land agent of the district, or to the
Colonial Treasurer of rent for the ensuing year, at the rate of two
pounds per square mile , or such higher rate as the lessee may pay
for the current year, unless the lands be required for sale or for
any public purpose, &c.” There are two distinct modes of obtain-
ing such leases—first, “ the holders in fee-simple of any lands may
be allowed leases of Crown lands adjoining their respective pro-
perties, without competition, at the rate of tico pounds per section
of six hundred and forty acres, and to the extent of three times
their own purchased or granted lands, if there be so much vacant
Crown lands available.” (Clause 12, par. 5.) This is termed a
pre-emptive lease; and the other is non-pre-emptive “ Crown lands,
over which no pre-emptive right of lease shall have been exercised
within one year from the passing of this Act may be put up to
lease at auction at the land office of the district either on applica-
tion or otherwise, but no such sale of lease shall take place without
one month’s notice thereof having been given in the Gazette."
(Clause 12, par. 8.) “The upset price of each lot shall be at the
rate of one pound per section of six hundred and forty acres, and
the full price for each lot shall be paid at the time of sale.” (Clause
12, par 9.)


In the second class settled districts and in the unsettled districts
leases for five years are granted. The following is the clause pro-
viding for the conversion of leases current when the Act came into
operation into the new form of lease prescribed by the Act: —
“ Leases of runs shall be converted into leases for five years under
this Act by payment to the Colonial Treasurer, net later than two
months from the date of a notice in the Gazette to that effect, of
rent to be determined by appraisement of the fair annual value for
pastoral purposes of the lands comprised in such runs. Provided
that in estimating such value neither the construction of dams or
reservoirs, nor the laying down of grass, nor the making of any
other improvement hy the occupier shall he taken into account
(Clause 13, par. 1.)
In ordinary cases the runs are not to exceed tv/enty-five square
miles in extent, “ but should that area, in the opinion of the proper
officer of the Government, be insufficient in average seasons for the
pasturage of four thousand sheep, or eight hundred head of cattle, a
run may be enlarged to whatever area, not exceeding a hundred
square miles, may be necessary for that purpose.” (Clause 14,
par. 1.) As to forfeited or vacated old runs, it is enacted that they
“ may be submitted to sale by auction in leases for the term of five
years, at the minimum upset price of one pound per annum for
every square mile of estimated area.” (Clause 17.) The leases
being all short but certain—one year in the first class settled dis-
tricts, and five years elsewhere—no great difficulty arises as to
compensation for improvements. Lessees having further a right
of pre-emption over one square mile out of the twenty-five con-
tained in their runs, are, of course, careful to make all their per-
manent improvements on that one mile, or the “ homestead,” as it is
called. Yet as if such a liberal guarantee were not sufficient to
encourage the making of improvements, an extension of lease is
held out as an extra inducement to lessees in the second-class dis-
tricts. Clause 15 says :—“ If in any case it shall appear that at
the time of the appraisement any run in its natural state was
incapable of sustaining four thousand sheep, or eight hundred
head of cattle, in all seasons of the year, the lessee thereof may
during the first quarter of the last year of his lease apply for an


appraisement thereof, and if it shall then appear that such run
has by the adoption of artificial means been rendered capable of per-
manently depasturing the said number of sheep or cattle, or if it shall
appear upon a like application in respect of any run of whatever
capacity that such run has by adoption of artificial means been
rendered capable of permanently depasturing an additional number
by one-half or more beyond the number of sheep or cattle which
the run in its natural state was capable of despasturing, the
duration of the lease shall he extended to ten years f i.e., five years
beyond the original term of five years J, at the same rent and on the
same terms and conditions as the original lease." Such are the
principal features in the New South Wales bill of fare for
squatters. It contrasts favourably with our own as regards—
I.—Rental, showing a moderate average of forty shillings
per square mile against Mr. Goyder’s fifteen pounds a mile.
11-—Renewals. In the first-class settled districts, every lessee
is considered to be entitled to a renewal of his lease from year to
year, on the same terms as it had been originally granted on —if a
pre-emptive lease, at forty shillings per square mile; and if ob-
tained at auction, at the auction price. In the second-class
districts the leases are subject to revaluation every five years, but
the valuators are expressly instructed to take into account only
the fair annual value of the land for pastoral purposes , excluding
all artificial improvements , such as dams , reservoirs , <s'c.
lll.—Guarantee for improvements. Every lessee enjoys the
right of purchasing his “ homestead,” so that he can retain his
improvements in his own hand, and does not need to trouble
Parliament for an ex cathedra enactment to compensate him for
them. This privilege of pre-emption over their homesteads used
to be enjoyed practically, though not secured by law to the South
Australian squatters. It was till recently an understood rule that
when any of them wished to erect a dwelling-house or woolsheds
on his run he had only to select his site, and the Government
would survey it for him at their convenience, and put it up at
auction. So much reliance was placed in the validity of the
practise as well as in the good faith of Government that many
began building before they had actually secured their site. They


might have called at the Crown Lands Office to give notice of their
intention, and the Commissioner for the time being, rubbing his
hands with invisible soap and water would say, “ You want a
Surveyor sent out, do you ? All very busy just now I assure you,
but you shall have the first that can be spared. Go ahead with your
buildings, and as soon as possible the survey will be made, and
the section handed over to you in due course.” John Doe, highly
gratified with the affability of this personification of responsible
government, proceeds to lay out two or three thousand pounds in
permanent improvements on the “ public property,” expecting one
day to make it all his own. But while he is thus busy getting rid
of his hard cash a new Commissioner comes into power, and brings
a new principle with him. The selling of their “ homesteads” to
the squatters was originally a device of the Government to get
them to settle down, but now it is found that they settle down fast
enough without any inducement; therefore a change must be
made. From such changing Governments, as most colonies arc
blessed with, little can be expected but change and perpetual
oscillation from one extreme to the other. Because some foolish
surveys had been made by previous Governments a cry is got up
against the squatters in general that they are “ picking out the
eyes” of the country, and must not get any more special surveys.
New Commissioner being probably an Adelaide merchant, who was
never on a run in his life, sympathizes with the cry, and goes at it
as a thorough reformer. It is decreed that no more land shall be
sold until it has been previously declared into a Hundred. Not
only was the invaluable privilege of buying their “ homesteads”
thus arbitrarily withdrawn from the squatters, but in numerous
instances engagements which had been already made with them
were left unfulfilled. Many of them had been induced to expend
a great deal of money on improvements by the promise I have
mentioned before of surveying the site as soon as possible, and
offering it for sale. While they were still smarting under the
disappointment of obtaining no survey, round comes the Surveyor-
General himself, not to fulfil the old promise, however, but to
make a fresh start. He values the run as it stands, improvements
and all; for says he “ the lease expires next year, when of course


all improvements will belong to the landlord. You made them
yourself, it is true, and paid for them yourself; but still in the
absence of any special contract on the subject they must be dealt
with as the common law of England directs. If you want a new
lease you must be prepared to pay rent not only for the grass, but
for your own improvements. And as for compensation, that not
being in the bond, you must petition Parliament about it.” With
this prelude the Surveyor-General takes a look round, and jots
down in Column A a fabulous sum to represent the gross annual
value of the run. Next he values the improvements, dividing the
sum into five parts, one of which is to be deducted from each year’s
rent during the proposed renewal -of five years. The balance, or,
as we may term it, the grass value of the run is duly entered in
Column B, and the returns sent to the Commissioner of Crown
Lands. Column A gives, for the first eighteen runs reported on,
an average of £2O 3s. 3d. per square mile, the aggregate mileage
being 1,844, and the aggregate rental £37,174. Column B gives
an average rental of £l6 7s. 6d., the aggregate mileage being
1,844, and the aggregate rental £30,190. The returns were laid
before Parliament, and its decision asked i whether Column A
or Column B should be adopted. After much altercation in both
Houses, it was agreed to adopt Column B, whereupon the ultra-
auti-squatters made no small noise about throwing away public
money, &c. These gentlemen had become so suddenly learned in
the law that their perceptions of common justice were obscured.
They saw ouly that the Government had a feasible pretence for
appropriating all the squatters’ improvements if it chose. They
forgot that most of these improvements had been the subject of
tacit engagement with the Government, that they were made
under the supposed guarantee of certain promised surveys, or at
least of a promised renewal for five years at a valuation. Of
course the Government could have ejected the squatters in a body
if it had pleased; for was not the grass and every thing upon it
public property ? But such conduct in a benighted country like
Austria or Russia would be called despotic. In a colony it is
hailed as patriotic. To impartial observers it will appear that,
notwithstanding the boasted generosity of Parliament in adopting


Column B instead of Column A, the present lessees do in reality pay
under Column A. It is set up as the proper rental, but in consideration
of the present lessees having paid part of it before in the shape of
improvements that part is to be remitted to them. The actual rent
of the first eighteen runs is £2O 3s. 3d. per mile, against 40s. per
mile in New South Wales, or Is. lOd. per sheep against Bd. per
sheep in Victoria. Had the improvements not been allowed as the
rabid anti-squatters contended they should not, the lessees would
have had to pay for them twice over. Commend me to “ Jeddarb
justice” rather than to South Australian “ compensation.”
IV. The New South Wales system is superior to ours in retaining
the old principle of arbitration established by the Orders in Council.
Lastly, we come to the young colony of Queensland. There,
when a person wishes to commence squatting, his first step is to
apply to the District Commissioner of Crown Lands for a licence.
“ Every person who shall obtain a licence as aforesaid shall, on or
within ninety days after obtaining such licence, pay into the
Treasury of Brisbane as an occupation fee for the same the sum of
ten shillings per square mile, and unless such fee shall be so paid,
the licence shall be forfeited” (Clause 7 Act of 1860). This suffices
for the first year, and if the licensee is satisfied with his run, he
may, three months prior to the expiration of the licence, apply to
the Chief Commissioner of Crown Lands, through the District Com-
missioner, for a fourteen years’ lease on the following terms :—For
the first four years he shall continue to pay at the rate of ten
shillings per square mile. At the commencement of the next five
years an appraisement shall be made “ in proportion to the value
of the run, its capabilities, advantages, and disadvantages being
considered. Provided that in no case shall the rent be after a less
rate than £25, nor a greater than £50.” As the minimum size of
runs is fixed at twenty-five square miles, the rent for these five
years must range between one aud two pounds per mile. At the
commencement of the second five, or the final period of the lease,
a similar appraisement has to be made, the minimum this time
being £3O, and the maximum £7O. Therefore, the most that a
Queensland squatter can be made to pay is £2 16s. per mile. But
he is still further protected by the mode of appraisement. Clause


13 says:—“ In order to estimate the rent as provided by Section 12
of this Act, the lessee shall, within a period of not less than three
months previous to the expiration of the fourth year of his lease,
nominate in writing to a Commissioner of the district in which his
run is situated a valuer on behalf of himself, and such Commissioner
shall act as valuer on behalf of the Crown, or name one to act for
him, and these two valuers shall have the poiver to choose, if neces-
sary, an umpire, but if they cannot agree in the choice of an umpire ,
he shall be appointed by the Governor with the advice aforesaid
There, again, is the good old principle of threefold arbitration. As
to resumption and compensation for improvements, the Act provides
as follows :—Clause 17. “ The whole or any portion of a run may
be reserved for public purposes or resumed for sale or otherwise,
after giving twelve months' notice." Clause 18. “ Whenever it shall
be deemed expedient to resume for any purpose any land included
in a lease, and whenever the term of any lease shall expire, the lessee
may claim the value of improvements effected on land so sold or
resumed, or of which the lease shall so expire, if such claim is made
within two months after notice of such intended resumption, or
after the expiry of such term, such value to be ascertained by valua-
tion to be made in the manner prescribed by Section 13 of this
Act, and such valuation shall be conclusive, and payment shall be
made to the lessee according to such valuation.”
By a supplementary Act “ to provide for the leasing of Crown
lands previously occupied," it is enacted (clause 3) that “upon
application from the occupant six months before the expiration ot
any lease of Crown lands for pastoral purposes, the fair annual
value of lands comprised in such lease shall be determined for the
five years next ensuing the expiration of such lease, according to the
provisions of Clause 13 of the Unoccupied Crown Lands Occupa-
tion’s Act of 1860, and such valuation shall be based upon the
grazing capabilities and other advantages or disadvantages of such
lands, but shall not have reference to any valuable improvements that
may have been made thereon , and shall be the annual rent during the
currency of such lease.” The event of a new lessee entering at
the expiration of the lease is provided for on the same liberal terms.
Clause 5 says —“ Any person not being the previous occupant of


such lands who may obtain the renewed lease thereof shall, in addi-
tion to his rent, pay into the Treasury before entering upon such
lands the amount that may be fixed by arbitration in manner pro-
vided by Clause 13 of the Unoccupied Crown Lands Occupation
Act of 1860 as being the value of the permanent improvements on
such lands as may be comprised in any new lease to be granted
thereof, and such amount shall forthwith he paid to the outgoing
lessee ” Between the Queensland system and our own the following
differances may be observed :
I. The rental is fixed down to the moderate limit of 10s. a mile
for the first four years, 40s. a mile for the next five, and 565. a mile
for the last five.
11. The renewals are regulated by a uniform mode of appraise
ment.
111. Improvements are recognised as in every respect the pro-
perty of the lessee. lie is charged no rent upon them during a
subsequent lease, and should his run be transferred to another
lessee, the latter must pay him the value of them.
IV.—ln case of the land being required for sale or for any
public purpose the lessee gets twelve mouths’ notice instead of six,
as with us.
V.—The old plan of arbitration is retained in its integrity and
employed as a final appeal in all disputed cases.
This finishes our comparison of South Australia with the other
Australian colonies in respect of Waste Land Regulations. The
result of it is that throughout the whole of the Eastern Continent
we can find nothing to equal or even to approach Mr. Goyder’s
£ls per mile. Much less is there anything to set beside our new
policy of a single valuator and no appeal. But when we come to
speak of compensation for improvements, then do we, indeed, stand
alone. The other colonies, instead of practising the patriotic doctrine
that when a lease expires and the subject returns to the landlord
he is also entitled to all the improvements Avhich may have been
made upon it, take care to guard their tenants against so placing
themselves in the power of the public landlord. They either give
them a pre-emptive right to the land on which they made the
improvements, or they expressly provide means to compensate them


for them should they chance to lose possession of the subject. It
may be that the South Australians have law on their side, but
certainly the other colonies have equity.
CHAPTER IV.
THE ORDERS IN COUNCIL.
To those who are intimate with the circumstances under which
the leases of 1851 were issued, no part of the anti-squatters’ conduct
seems more absurd than their consigning the Orders in Council to
oblivion. That this plea has been invented for the occasion may
be inferred from the very different opinions expressed by some of
the parties in 1858. In Mr. Barrow’s report of the Select Com-
mittee on the Assessment Act, we read as follows ;—Paragraph 2,
“ That the covenant included in the squatters’ leases authorising
the imposition of an assessment on sheep and other stock, although,
possibly, in itself a sufficient warrant in a strictly legal sense, for
the levying of an assessment, ought not to he considered apart from the
Order in Council, and the official correspondence connected with the
authorization and issue of the leases .” This view, that the Orders in
Council were not to be thrown overboard at the pleasure of the Local
Legislature, is affirmed by an Imperial Act, 18 and 19 Yic., ch. 56,
clause 5, of which says, “ Provided, also, that nothing herein
contained, nor any Act to be passed as aforesaid by any of the said
Legislatures (Van Diemen’s Land and South Australia) shall affect
or he construed to affect any contract, or extend to prevent the
fulfilment of any promise or engagement made by or on behalf of
Her Majesty, with respect to any lands situate in either of the
said colonies where such contract, promise, or engagement shall
have been lawfully made before the time Avhcn this Act shall take
effect in such respective colony.”
Now, as to the mode of valuation, the Order in Council of 19th
June, 1850, provides (section 4) “ In order to estimate the quality
of the land before the granting of any such lease, the intended
lessee or occupier shall name a valuer, and the Commissioner of


Crown Lauds shall either act as valuer, or name one to act for him,
and these two valuers shall have power to choose, if necessary, an
umpire; but if they cannot agree in the choice of an umpire, he
shall be appointed by the said Governor.”
The principle is there laid down explicitly enough, and it does
not alter the case that, since the Order in Council was issued, we
have changed the criterion of value from the quality of the land to
its grazing capability. The threefold valuation prescribed is still
as applicable as ever. Some may object that the present renewals
ought rather to be regulated by section 11, which provides that
“ when any land, after being occupied, shall be forfeited or other-
wise become vacant, it shall be relet by public auction but then
the compromise of 1858 interposes to suspend the operation of this
clause. Had there been no such compromise made, the leases
would now have expired absolutely, and been renewed at
auction. The compromise was made, however, as every colonist
knows, and one of its principal stipulations was that renewals
should be granted for five years at a valuation. A valuation was
understood to mean such as the lessees had been accustomed to
under the Orders in Council, and as was practised in the other
colonies without exception. The idea of leaving the Crown lessees
at the mercy of a Government official was never seriously enter-
tained till the year of confusion, 1864. In 1860, when they were
dissatisfied with the assessment on stock, a Special Committee was
readily granted to them; and one of its recommendations was
(Par. 13 Mr. J, T. Bagot’s Report)—“ That any lessee of the Crown,
if dissatisfied with the classification of his run, shall be entitled to
appeal against such classification to the Commissioner of Crown
Lunds ; and the question shall, if the Commissioner see sufficient
cause, he referred to arbitration .” This, too, when the “ question”
was only about estimating the grazing capabilities of the runs for
the imposition of a twopenny assessment! Now, when nine times
the amount is at stake, Mr. Goyder’s dictum must be sufficient.
The next question we have to ask is, whether any contract,
promise, or engagement regarding compensation for improvements
may have arisen out of the Orders in Council ? When the New
South Wales Regulations were submitted to Mr. Bonney and others


to consider in how far they might be applicable to South Australia,
Mr. Bonney objected to the clause granting compensation for im-
provements, “ Because, in the first place,” said he, “ the more
expensive improvements, such as buildings, watertanks, &c., would
generally be on purchased lands.” It was very fair in him to say
so; because elsewhere in the same letter he affirmed, in opposition
to the proposed clause for keeping runs out of the market, that
“ nothing can work better than the system hitherto pursued in
this province, of allowing any land applied for to be put up to
auction” —( Vide Appendix to Mr. Barrow’s Report on the Assess-
ment Act of 1858),
This opinion was reiterated in "Sir Henry Young’s despatch to
the Home Government, of date 23rd February, 1849 —“ Permanent
improvements may he, and usually are, erected on purchased, and
not on leased land.” The Regulations in the Order in Council
were framed exactly according to Sir Henry’s suggestions, from
which it is clear that the selling of their “homesteads” to the
squatters was distinctly contemplated. We all know that the
practice was continued down to within eighteen months ago, when
the pedantic rule of selling land only in Hundreds was introduced.
It is not difficult to see how that change unjustly interfered with
the squatters’ improvements. No claim to compensation was
granted under the Orders in Council, because, when they were
framed, the squatter could compensate himself by buying the site
of his improvements. Now this solitary protection is arbitrarily
and summarily withdrawn, but still Shylock will stand by the letter
of his bond !
CHAPTER V.
THE COMPARATIVE IMPORTANCE AND USEFULNESS OF THE
WOOL TRADE.
One peculiar feature of the crusade against the squatters is, that
during its course the most fulsome flatter}’ has been poured out on


the farmers. They have been almost as good as told that agricul-
ture alone can contribute anything worth speaking of to the
wealth of a nation. Such crudities have been hatched and
disseminated before, but not in the present century. They were
rife at one period in the infancy of political economy, but since
then have gradually lost caste, until they fell into the hands of a
certain school in this part of the world, whose principles are
made on the rule of supply and demand. Out of South Australia
it may seem to savour more of party prejudice than of economical
sagacity, when the philosopher-in-chief of a daily paper reasons
thus—“ it is because we believe that every pound earned by a
farmer effects double the good of the same sum earned by a
squatter, that we advocate bringing as much land as possible into
the hands of farmers,” (vide Advertiser , 10th October, 18G4.y This
is an argamentum ad hominem, turning on the personal habits of
farmers and squatters with which the present discussion has
nothing to do ; it relates solely to the comparative merits of wool-
growing and wheatgrowing as a mode of employing laud in South
Australia. To bring the discussion to a practical issue, we must
proceed on other than general grounds, for it is impossible to
reason about land in the abstract: we must reason about some
particular land. All we have to do in fact is to ask ourselves
whether the remaining unsold lands in the colony are more suitable
for pasturage or for tillage. The answer to this we do not need to
seek from any newspaper editor, or the promiscuous “ friends of the
people.” It is a matter for professional men to deal with, and to
some extent it has already engaged their attention. The immacu-
late Mr. Goyder has pronounced a dictum on the subject, which
we extract from a Parliamentary Paper dated 27th April, 1861.
He had been asked to report on the propriety of allowing lands
which had passed the hammer and remained unsold to be taken
up by bona fide settlers on the principle of deferred payments, and
this is what he says about the quality of the lands in question. * “A
careful examination of the statistical returns shows that the higher
yields are only obtained on the alluvial flats, and in the undulating
and hilly districts of the south and south-eastern portions of the
province, whilst by far the greater area of lands that have passed


the hammer (and remained unsold) are on the plains between the
Light and Wakefield rivers, and those north of Kapunda, where
though the quality of the land is good, the crops are liable to be
cut off by causes that can never be anticipated or avoided, and
would rarely yield over a succession of years a greater average
than from three to five bushels per acre. It is therefore to be
considered whether inducements held out to cultivate such lands
would not tend to injure rather than to improve the condition of
the labouring man, and consequently to retard the satisfactory
development of the resources of the province, by the application
of lands only fitted for pasture to the purpose of agriculture.”
Many people in the colony would doubtless like to see the squat-
ters’ profits transferred to the pockets of the farmers next to having
them transferred to their own, but should the natural capabilities
of the country favour the squatter to the exclusion of the farmer,
then surely the will of Providence must be submitted to. If we do
not want to prove ourselves supremely foolish as well as grossly
partial, the squatter must have free scope for his industry and
capital, even though his personal habits may not be in accordance
with the democratic standard. A second arbitrary principle, which
has been applied to squatting in order to prejudice the public mind
against it, is the quantity of labour it employs as compared with
that employed in agriculture. There are two opposite conclusions
to which comparisons of this kind may lead. First, we may reason
as to the productive power of an industry and its consequent value
in a national point of view, from the quantity of produce it yields
to a given quantity of labour. In proportion to such yield does it
advance the wealth of a nation. Thus woolgrowing in South Aus-
tralia shows, according to the Advertiser’s own figures (October
10, 1864), an annual product per head for all employed in it, of
£l6O, while farming yields only £39 per head. Judged by this,
the true standard of political economy, woolgrowing is one of the
most productive and consequently most useful industries in exist-
ence. But the working man comes with a standard of his own,
which was first propounded during the anti-machinery riots in
England, and has been thrust forward here in various forms to the
prejudice and loss of the colony. The working man has a partiality


for those forms of industry in which mere labour plays the largest
part, whether profitably or unprofitably he does not enquire. But
even this arbitrary and erratic test proves very little against squat-
ting. Taking for our data the estimated number of labourers em-
ployed in both industries in 1861, and adding ten per cent, per
annum for increase to the present date (which is under the ascer-
tained rate of increase during the six years immediately preceding),
we may set down the number presently employed in farming at
10,620, and in squatting at 4,120. We confine ourselves, be it ob-
served, to male labourers, excluding employers and females, as they
would only complicate and confuse the question. When but one
kind of labour is employed on runs, it would be unfair to compare
it indiscriminately with the various kinds of labour employed on
farms. Like things with like things ; and therefore we shall limit
the comparison to the same form of labour in the two industries,
namely, adult male labour, which is the proper criterion for all
working men’s questions. In the agricultural returns we have to
allow for a great number of youths from ten to fourteen years of
age, sons of farmers, &c., who are returned as able-bodied labourers.
Striking off on this account say 1,620, or one for every five farmers
(8,000), we have about 9,000 bona fide labourers. Regarding the
squatters’ employees, it must be noticed that the 4,120 comprise
only shepherds, hutkeepers, and station labourers. At least a third
more are incidentally connected with runs, as in carting, well-
sinking, &c., say 1,380, which, added to the 4,120, gives 5,500.
Now for the statistics of production in the two cases. The
declared value of our agricultural exports last year (1864) was
£1,464,603. Add, for home consumption, at the rate of 6 bushels
per head of the population, say 900,000 bushels at 6s. per bushel,
£270,000. Total produce, £1,734,603, which, divided by the
total number of labourers (9,000), shows a product for each labourer
of £192. The declared value of our wool exports for the same
year (1864) was £775,656. Add, for home consumption, 3,000 sheep
per week, or 156,000 per annum, at 20s. each=£ls6,ooo; and 200
cattle per week, or 10,400 per annum, at £6 each=£62,4oo, total
£994,056, which, divided by the number of labourers (5,500),
shows an annual product per head of nearly £lßl. Here are no


conjectures or haphazard statements, but a simple appeal to the
statistical facts of the past year as set forth in the public records.
For ourselves, we attach no importance to this view of the case,
because it so happens that the working man here sets himself in
opposition to the principles of political economy. It is most for
the public benefit when a great deal is produced by a small amount
of labour, and, in that respect, our last years’ agricultural returns
do almost unparalleled credit to the colony. We might chal-
lenge the world to show another instance of breadstufts being pro-
duced at the rate of £192 for each hired labourer. However,
according to the working man’s logic, squatting beats agriculture,
because it employs a labourer for every £lßl produced against the
farmers’ £192.
The Advertiser has then considerably overshot the mark, in
asying “ that £IOO in the pocket of the farmer does more good to
the colony, than £2OO or £3OO in the pocket of a squatter.”
(October 10, 1864.) There is a difference we admit, but not in the
farmer’s favour, and one circumstance relating to it has been
generally overlooked hitherto — the difference is not nearly so great
as ti might be if the squatters chose to work their runs in the most
economical way. If they were to cut down their working expenses
as low as they could do, and will have to do should the new
valuations be enforced, a third of the labour they now employ might
be dispensed with. Improvements will be stopped, flocks reduced,
and the staff of hands curtailed to the lowest workable point. Thus
if the squatter is to be punished for not employing more labour in
proportion to his revenue than the farmer does, the consequences
will redound on the working men themselves, by compelling him
to employ still less labour, a kind of logic wdiich working men have
too often exercised to their own hurt. Viewing the squatter and
the farmer simply as capitalists, it is no credit to the one that he
employs comparatively much labour, and no discredit to the other
that he employs comparatively little. It is all the fault of nature.
She makes some things easy to produce and other things difficult:
wool is one of the things which are easy, and wheat one of those
which are difficult. We must take both as we find them, and
apply each to its proper use, neither on the one hand trying to eat


•wool because it is easily grown, nor on tbe other hand trying to
make trousers of wheat, because it would give liberal employment
to labour.
Before concluding this chapter there is another peculiarity cf
squatting to which the public attention requires to be specially
dr awn —its precariousness. Of all speculators the squatter is under
the greatest temptation to extend his operations, and consequently
the more fortunate he may be at one time the greater his misfor-
tunes may be the next. Everyone knows that opening up new
country oftener ruins than enriches the adventurer. We see an
almost appalling illustration of that now before us in the Far North.
For more than eighteen months no rain has fallen there; the water-
holes are drying up; the grass is consumed ; nearly all the lambs
and calves which dropped during the past season had to be knocked
in the head; the stock is perishing by hundreds daily; many flocks
of sheep have been turned adrift and the stations deserted; men
cannot remain for want of provisions, and provisions cannot be sent
to them almost at any cost. If the drought continues for a month
or two longer the runs of the Far North will be stocked with dead
carcases and the hundreds of thousands of pounds invested there
will be lost for ever. Now who bears this loss, and where did the
money come from which has been so tragically sacrificed to “ the
opening up of the country ?” To a great extent the squatters in the
neighbourhood of Adelaide, the men who grew rich under the orders
in Council and the favourable leases of 1851. Much of the money was
made on the runs we now propose to rackrent, and sent to the Far
North as fast as it was made. While this drought is sweeping away
the savings of years, Demos steps in and says, “ You shan’t have any
more of our grass; stump down fifteen pounds a mile or turn out.’*
It may be that Demos is killing his goose for the golden eggs. The
success of the men he envies so much, because “ they have had a
good time of it ” was in fact partly his own. They did not get their
annual profits shipped off to England in gold bars as he innocently
supposes but spent them in sending stock northward in the wake
of Stuart and McKinlay. Had their enterprise succeeded, Demos
would have been all the better for it. But seeing it has so deplor-
ably failed he will not mend matters by burning the candle at both


ends, and when the new runs are ruined by drought, mining the old
runs which in a large measure supported them, by rack rents. We
are not speaking at a venture, but on trustworthy evidence. One
stockholder we know who was among the very first to introduce
sheep into this colony, and who by a quarter of a century of industry
had amassed a considerable fortune invested one half of it several
years ago in the Far North, and he might as well have invested it
in Spencer's Gulf.
Here is a bona fide account of one of his runs in the Far North
kindly furnished by himself, and said to represent fairly the geneml
state of mattters in that district: —

* It is almost impossible to estimate the number of sheep and cattle now on the run.
Since the above return was made they attempted to remove portion of the stock, but
•without success; and the deaths have been so numerous of late that no reckoning has
been kept.
Very unsatisfactory as the past has been the present throws it
entirely into the shade. The overseer reports as follows on the
actual state of the run:—“All the lambs of 8,000 ewes dropped
last season are dead; one third of the old sheep may be
reckoned dead ; the rest are all spread over the country, and will
likely die too; there are no rations on the station ; the bullocks sent
for supplies have died on the road/’ The owner of the run as a
last resort started a dray loaded with flour from Port Augusta and
sent twenty horses along with it j only three of them reached the


station. In the face of such revelations the most rabid anti-squatter
cannot surely deny that a drought and new valuations are more
than even the pastoral interest ought to be made to bear in one
year. It has been shewn that the two classes of runs are intimately
connected a&d both misfortunes will fall to a great extent on the
same parties. Future experience will prove to us that by abusing
the country already settled we are employing the most effectual
means to retard the settlement of fresh country.
CHAPTER VI.
GENERAL OBJECTIONS TO THE NEW VALUATIONS.
We do not consider it necessary to revive any of the complaints
against the procedure of the Government which have been so
liberally made by the squatters themselves. We must leave it to
them to refute Mr, Goyder, if ever they should have a fair
opportunity of doing so. The practical details of the Valuations
do not lie at all in our way, but as simple citizens we feel interested
in the manner in which they have been made, and subsequently
bandied about in Parliament. The Government allege that in,
making them they have stuck to the letter of the law. But there
has been faith broken and well-founded hopes destroyed for al|
tli at. The squatters did not have every item specified in the
contract, because they regarded its spirit as a better guarantee than
mere words could be. And the circumstances under which the
leases were first accepted and then modified, ought surely to
receive as much consideration as the printed letter. From the
latter it is to be inferred that a single valuator was the worst
alternative offered by the law. From the former it is to be
inferred that in 1859 there was an actual understanding between
the then Government and the squatters, that by submitting to the
assessment over and above their stipulated rentals, the squatters
were favouring the Government and Avould have a claim for some
substantial return when their leases expired. That hope has not
only been utterly dispelled, but the ground of it has been
contemptuously repudiated. Apart, however, from any previous
contract there is ample cause to condemn the Valuations on grounds
of state policy. It is somewhat strange that a Government par
excellence the people’s own, should be much less liberal and fair

than the bureaucratic authorities of the colonial office. The old
Orders in Council provided for the safety of the tenant as well as for
that of the Crown, for, in determining the classification of the*
runs each party was to appoint a valuator, and these two were
to choose a third for umpire. This was not conferred as a
favour, but was made the common law of the colonies. Won-
derful to think, the Local Government which succeeded, the
elected of the people, took their cue, not from the Colonial Office,
but from the Bourbons and the Hapsburghs. There is but one law
for the squatters, and Goyder is its prophet! The very circumstance
of the fate of one of our principal exports being left to the deter-
mination of one individual, and that a mere official, ought to strike
the Government as absurd. If it is not seen to be so on the face
of it a specimen of its results may help to bring out the truth. It
is well-known that three years ago Mr. Morris went through part
of the work which has now fallen on the shoulders of Mr. Goyder.
A comparison of their respective estimates reveals discrepancies so
startling that we wonder why they have not been more attended to.
We subjoin a tabular statement of some of the leading rims

On these 22 specimens, taken at random from Mr. Goyder’s
reports, there is an excess over the previous valuations by Mr.
Morris of 157,257 sheep, or 72 sheep per mile on the entire area
valued. In other words, there is a difference of 43 per cent on the
total number of sheep, and of fully 50 per cent on the mileage. If
this reductio ad absurdam, applied to their pastoral policy, does not
help to enlighten our government, their eyes must be closed against
every consideration of justice and prudence. It may be objected,
indeed, to Mr. Morris’s figures, that he had the reputation of
being partial to the squatters, but it may be as fairly urged against
Mr. Goyder that he is partial to the squatters’ opponents.
The question then arises, should such an immense field for per-
sonal feeling be deliberately laid open by Government, to say
nothing of the necessary scope for mistakes and miscalculations ?
One superior feature in Mr. Morris’s reports is that he classes the
runs in districts and sets a uniform price on all in the same district.
Mr. Goyder’s plan is to take every run separately, and it has
happened, oftener than once, that one without surface water is esti-
mated as high as others in the same neighbourhood which enjoy
that advantage. But, in every reasonable mind, there can be only
one answer to such objections—that nothing else could have been
expected when a task of such magnitude and difficulty was
entrusted to a single individual.
Having considered the manner in which the valuations were
made, we would add a word or two on the treatment they
subsequently received in Parliament. It is right to enquire
first, how, at this premature stage, they found their way into
Parliament at all. Do they not lie solely within the juris-
diction of the Executive, guaranteed by its responsibility ? There
was no new law to make regarding the Pastoral Leases, but
an old law to execute, and with that the House of Assembly hud
no right to interfere. Their conduct towards the Government on
this question has been throughout unconstitutional and subversive
of the principle of a responsible ministry. The valuations should
have been first completed, and opportunity given to the lessees to
slate their objections to them; then the Government could have
matured a general scheme of renewals and taken the advice of the


Legislature upon it as a whole. Instead of tliis, the House of
Assembly demanded to have Mr. Goyder’s reports laid before them
as they were received, and the discussion, which should have been
both comprehensive and conclusive, was as fragmentary and point-
loss as can well be imagined. It degenerated into a party fight,
of which the rival shibboleths were Goyder or no Goyder, and the
final result, a premature dissolution. Though column B has been
carried instead of column A, and, under compulsion from the
ultra-Radicals, the Government have gazetted many of the valuations,
still the question is not decided for all time coming. The fate of
the existing lessees may be decided, but the principles which have
been brought to issue are as far as ever from any final settlement.
Out of the legislative chaos which'reigned during the past session
no foundation has emerged for the pastoral interest to be
permanently based upon. Despite all their hurry and zeal,
the House of Assembly have found no solution of the squatting
question. Had they allowed Mr. Goyder to go on quietly with
his work under the legitimate superintendence of Government,
at the proper time they might have enjoyed the honour of
solving the great problem. But their precipitancy destroyed them,
and their unfinished work will have to be taken up by a new Par-
liament. They are not the only victims, however. The storm
which they raised throughout the country took the squatters by
surprise, and nothing they could do subsequently would have availed
them against it in the slightest. The result of the new valuations
was not only an unexpected blow to them, but it came in an irre-
gular, insidious way, from which they had no means of defence
but to petition for a Select Committee. Their prayer was granted,
just as the law had been observed—merely in form. It kept up
the farce of legislative deliberation for a few weeks longer, but the
decision had long ago been predetermined. "W orst of all, a spirit
of envy and hostility to the squatters was infused into the public
mind; and now this was to be made the final Court of Appeal! The
electors are first biassed by all manner of mis-statements and false
arguments; then it is gravely urged that their will, and it alone,
must become law! The men who work this powerful instrument
know full well what such politics lead to. It has already borne


its fruit elsewhere, and the warning is easy to read. Should such
a destiny become ours, the consequences would be a hundredfold
more terrible in proportion as the people have more power. Here
they have not merely their own condition and privileges to fight
for, hut the whole country, with all its interests, i» at their toewy.
They claim the laud as theirs, and on the disposal of that land
depends the future prosperity of our agriculture and our commerce,
as well as of squatting. Serious as the present controversy may
seem, there is every likelihood that it will by and by merge into
one still more serious and more comprehensive. Should the anti-
squatters have their own way, and it prove to be the case that the
squatters are so greatly overrented as to be unable to continue their
runs, our exports of wool being of course greatly diminished in
consequence, a reaction may set in from the mother-country sub-
versive of certain theories which are now very popular among us.
It is confidently assumed that the waste lands of the colony are
the people’s lands —the patrimony of the people, as stump orators
have it. None will dispute that they have been handed over by
the Home Government to the management and control of the Local
Legislature, but there has been no absolute gift made of them. The
'colonists are not to dispose of them without responsibility or check.
On the contrary, the grant was qualified by conditions, the nature
of which may be inferred from the following extract from a despatch
of Lord John Russell’s to the Emigration Commissioners in 1840 :
“ The funds raised by the sale of land in the colonies shall be
applicable to the conveyance of emigrants thither so far, but only
so far as the use of the fund may be compatible with the pressing
and necessary demands of the local governments for which no other
resources can be found. While fully admitting and insisting on the
principle that the Crown lands in the Colonies are held in trust not
merely for the existing colonists , but for the people of the British
Empire collectively , it is perfectly consistent with that principle
to maintain that, in applying the proceeds of sales to local good
government which must be otherwise unprovided for, the real
interests of the empire at large, not less than those of the colony
itself, will be best provided for.”
This principle—that the general interests of the empire are to be


equally considered with those of the colonies themselves in the dis-
posal of colonial waste lands—is one which we are very liable to over-
look, but which the Home Government would naturally keep a sharp
eye upon were any practical necessity to arise. To our own Govern-
ment it suggests a new contingency for consideration beyond the
mere will and pleasure of the colonists. If, by their present ad-
ministration, they ruin the wool trade of South Australia for an in-
definite period, other authorities may step in and have something
to say about the Pastoral Leases. From a local question about the
•valuation of runs, it may rise to an imperial question about the
proprietorship of colonial waste lands. Should it ever come to that,
we cannot suppose that the English Parliament will listen for a
moment to our stump oratory about the “ people’s patrimony” and
the “ people’s grass,” whereby is meant to monopolize for a hun-
dred and fifty thousand people what belongs equally to the three
hundred million inhabitants of the empire.
CHAPTER VII.
THE VOICE OF THE COUNTRY.
Since the foregoing pages were written we have passed through
the ordeal of a general election, in which the people have given
their decision between the squatters and anti-squatters. The
latter entered the contest with great expectations and unlimited
braggadocio. Hardly a pro-squatting candidate but was jeeringly
informed that he need not expect to be returned—“ that he had
been seen and heard for the last time on North Terrace.” The most
prominent of them were singled out for personal attacks in the
anti-squatting newspaper —attacks so scurrilous and malicious that
many of the editor’s own friends protested against them. But
notwithstanding these desperate attempts to keep up the excite-
ment, people began to talk more moderately every day about the
valuations and the squatting question generally. Few candidates
would go so far as to promise to deny all appeal whatever to the
squatters, or to countenance the anti-squatting projects of selling


land on deferred payments, and of applying the increased rentals
to the remission of taxation instead of to making roads. When
the elections were over, the anti-squatting organ admitted
that the result “might not be altogether satisfactory.” In the
Lower House, two-thirds of the old members were returned,
namely, twenty-four out of thirty-six, none of them being extreme
men, but a large proportion of them pro-squatters. Of the twelve
who dropped out, at least one-half were dhti-squatters, and of the
twelve who came in their place two or three are pro-squatters,
while nearly all the others are at least moderate men. To admit a
loss of three or four in the Lower House is all that the squatters
can be fairly asked to do; and what a trifle is that after the threat-
enings of complete annihilation amid which they entered the con-
test ! Moreover, they have had the satisfaction of seeing all the rabid
anti-squatting candidates defeated, even in anti-squatting districts.
Adventurers, who could not have stood half-an-hour on their own
merits, expected to get in at the head of the poll by outbawling
their rivals with the anti-squatting cry; but where were Grundy
and Fawsett in the Light after all their bunkum about “ small
blocks” and high rentals ? The telegram very briefly consigned
them to “Nowhere!” Even a respectable manlike Mr. Homer-
sham, the arch anti-squatter, who would have the “ shepherd
kings” squeezed periodically in their own wool-presses, could not
prevail on West Torrens to help him out of his chronic condition
of “ nowhere.” Bad as the times were, they were too reasonable
for such men and for their editorial godfather.
Take now the Legislative Council. In it there were eight vacan-
cies, and, considering the aspect of affairs, the squatters thought they
would be lucky if they secured three places. They made up their
ticket accordingly, and it succeeded, and something more. Besides
the three of their own choosing a fourth got in who properly
belongs to them had he not, for reasons of his own, pledged
himself to support the valuations. The other four on the anti-
squatting side are all “ moderate men ” perhaps the best
which that side brought forward. The editorial nominees were
only able to get a tantalising sight of the winning post, and then
they stuck in the mud. The country clearly prefers men who


have legs of their own to stand on. To complete the romance of
the denouement, the ministry who dissolved the House and hurried
off to the country to receive the laurels which they conceived
to be due to them for their anti-squatting valour stumbled over a
squatting poll on the way back and broke their neck. Their Attorney
General was defeated in the squatting district of Victoria, and, for
want of a man to supply his place, they had to resign immediately
the elections were over. They and their friends have had the
additional mortification of seeing men step into their place, the
foremost of whom refused to pledge themselves against granting
any appeal to the squatters. Whatever may become of Goyder’s
valuations, we appear to be now in a better position than ever for
settling the land question on a permanent and equitable basis. In
such a case, it is to be hoped that the information herein presented
will not be altogether useless.
