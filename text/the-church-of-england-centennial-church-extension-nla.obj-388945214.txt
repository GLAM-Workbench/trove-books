1788. January 20 —Arrival of the first Chaplain, the Rev.
Richard Johnson. On the first Sunday after landing
divine service was performed under a great tree, supposed
to have stood near where the trams now start in Bridge
Street ; and subsequently service was held each Sunday,
soon after sunrise, in the open air, wherever a shady tree
could be found.

1797. The first part (the clock tower) of old St. Philip’s,
Church Hill, Sydney, built. In 1806 this fell down, and
was rebuilt of stone in the same year. The church itself
was commenced in 1800, but was not ready until 1809, when


the Rev. W. Cowper officiated therein for the fix’st time.
The Church was completed about a year afterwards.
The foundation of old St. John’s, Parramatta (without
the tower] was laid April 5, 1797- The Church was
opened April 10, 1803.
1809. A clergyman was lost in the bush returning to Sydney
from a funeral.

Cathedral, Sydney, on a site (the present one) one third
of a mile away from any house.
1825. The first Archdeacon arrived —the Rev, T. H. Scott.
1829. He was succeeded by the Venerable Archdeacon
Broughton. There were then only eight churches and
twelve clergymen in Australia.

4. To carry the Gospel to the heathen. Think of the
vast continent of New Guinea, so near our own shores, with
its untold millions who know not the true God and Jesus
Christ; of the Aborigines, from whom we took this country ;
of the Chinese in our midst. How little is being done to
bring to these poor people the knowledge of Christ !
5. To make grants or lend money for Church Buildings,
especially in struggling districts. Yon, who are privileged to
join in the public worship of God Sunday after Sunday,
think of those who have not such privileges. And ought we
not to try and build Churches to the honour and glory of God
more worthy of those who think of “ imperishable homes ?”
6. To help parishes to pay off Church debts by lending
them money free of interest, repayable by instalments on
easy terms. This will relieve many parishes of the burden
of that payment for interest, often 8 to 10 per cent, per
annum, which now so cripples their development.
You will see that all. these objects are for Glfmvcl)
©sterns inn, and to promote them it is sought to raise
a sum of ®nn? ©lpmscmb
How can such a large sum as £200,000 be raised P
Very easily, if every member of the Church of England
who reads this will make a donation as a
A moderate estimate of the number of professing members of
our Church in this colony is 400,000, and if only one-twentieth
of that number “ give what they are disposed in their hearts,
not grudgingly, nor of necessity, but as cheerful givers,” the
wnole amount will readily be raised. Donations may be
Payable over Five Years, but any offering must be a
Special one.
To give to thoS fund, and cease or reduce the contributions
you have been accustomed to give to any other, would he useless and
wrong, because it would make you appear to do that which you are
not doing.


The following will show the proposed classes of
donations :
Class 1— £0 4 0 per year, in 5 years, amounts to £1
~ 2- 0 8 0 „ ~ ~ 2
3—loo „ „ ~ 5
„ 4 2 0 0 ~ ~ ~ 10
~5 5 0 0 ~ ~ ~ 25
~ (i— 10 0 0 ~ „ ~ 50
~ 7—20 0 0 „ ~ „ 100
„ 8— 40 0 0 „ „ „ 200
~ 9 50 0 0 ~ „ ~ 250
~ 10— 60 0 0 ~ „ ~ 300
„ 11— 80 0 0 ~ „ ~ 400
~ 12—100 0 0 ~ ~ ~ 500
If from any cnw.se the circumstances of a donor should change,
the promise is no longer considered binding.
Can Donations be made to some work in my Parish P
Yes; and such donations will appear in the Centennial
Fund List, provided you make some donation to the
General Fund. It is left to yourself to decide how you will
apportion, or to what special object of the fund you will
make your donation ; but do not forget that the fund aims at
teaching unselfishness.
How will the Centennial Fund carry on its Work?
The fund is to be Provincial, that is, co-extensive with
the which at present is divided into six dioceses,
viz.,—Sydney, Newcastle, Goulburn, Grafton and Armidale,
Bathurst, Riverina.
The fund will be permanent, i.e , its principal cannot be
given away, but will remain as a standing
The distribution of the fund will be under the direction
of a Board consisting of representatives from each of the
dioceses, who will meet from time to time and decide in


what directions it will be most desirable to lend the principal
or make grants from the interest annually accruing.
But why should I subscribe?
for many reasons ; here are a few —
1. Because, if you love your country you must love your
Church, whose aim is to make men and women more
Christ-like, and to promote “that righteousness which
alone exalteth a nation.”
2. Because it is right and expedient that our Church Members
should co-operate in general church work upon the
Scriptural principle that “We are members one of
another” (Bom. xii. 5). Unity to be worth anything
implies co-operation.
3. Because it is written : “ There shohld be no schism in the
body, but that the members should have the same care
one for anotherand this Centennial Fund appeals to
unselfish love, and asks you to think of your Christian
brethren who have not the spiritual privileges which you
enjoy, and which you largely owe to the unselfishness of
past generations.
4 Because it is written : “ There is that scattereth and yet
increaseth ; there is that with-holdeth more than is meet,
but it tendeth to poverty. Moreover, Jesus Christ him,
self has said : “It is more blessed to give than to
receive,”
How can I make a Donation ?
You can fill in and sign one of the accompanying forms
of promise, and give it at any collection in church or forward
it direct to the Hon. Secretaries of the Centennial Fund, The
Diocesan Registry, Bathurst Street, Sydney, or to the Clergy-
man of your Parish ; and as the annual payments become due,
you will be asked for them.
