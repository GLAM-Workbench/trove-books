Report on Trade of Japan, 1918.
Commercial Commissioner in the East,
Government o£ the State in New South Wales,
: KobS, 15 April, 1919.
The Honorable The Premier of New South Wales.
Sir, —
I have the honor to submit iny report on the trade of Japan for the
year ended the 31st December last.
The year under review was a record one for Japanese exports and imports,
the figures being :
Exports £220,736,325
Imports ... ... ... ... ... 187,666,181
Balance in favour of Japan ... ... £33,070,144
In arriving at the above sterling values, I have taken the average rate
of exchange at 2s. 3d. The higher rate of exchange has added at tho least
10 per cent, to tho totals, as compared with tho pre-war rates of exchange.
Taking a review of the year’s operations in Japan, there was unprecedented
prosperity during the greater part of the year ; but towards the end of tho
year there was much unrest on account of the high price of food, especially
rice. Before tho war, rice was available at from £2 to £3 per koku (about
5 bushels). About July last, it was apparent that certain speculators were
-at work, and the price was rapidly forced up to £5 and £6 per koku. This
caused great discontent, and culminated in serious riots, with loss of life and
damage to property. As a result of the rice riots and general demands for
a change of Government, a new Government, with more pronounced views
in favour of the people, came into power, and matters quietened down—rice,
being mixed with imported rice, and the price considerably reduced. Atten-
tion was also focussed on either food supplies, such as flour and other products.
When the high price of food problem had settled down a little, other diffi-
culties appeared, and there was a sudden slump when the armistice was
signed, as a result of a general wave of commercial and manufacturing
inactivity.

Large numbers of men were thrown out of employment, and this, it is
feared, will cause greater trouble during. 1919, which, together with . a
probable revival of the rice and food problem, will doubtless cause much
unrest among the labourers and middle class people. In regard to food
supplies generally, demands have exceeded supplies and, as will appear by
statistics quoted later on, Japan has had to import largely j and, with her
rapidly increasing population and- demands by .the workers for the doctoral
franchise, there are, I fear, ■" breakers ahead".
. Exports and. Imports,
During 1918 Japan -exported to and imported from the following-
countries ;
It will be seen that exports to Australia have now overtaken imports
from Australia, as predicted in a,.former report, Japan haying a balance of
trade in her favor for 1918 to the*extent of 1',8’2fi,040. This loss is more
than accounted for by the wool imports from South Africa; amounting to
£2,905,334, But for the difficulties placed in the way of wool exports from
Australia, the, bulk of the imports - would have-conic from Australia. Not
only with wool imports, but'with "oilier desired imports as well, impediments,
have' been placed .in the. way,..and hence attention has been directed
to other countries, • If, now that -peace-seems- in sight, all restrictions on
Australian trade are removed, it is highly probable that we will rapidly regain
our old position—enjoyed so long—with a handsome balance of trade in our
favour. If, on the other hand, commerce.in Australia with Japan and the
East is to bo further restricted, • -the question of Eastern representation
should receive close attention, far we cannot expect to succeed when com-
mercially hobbled. .. ... ...

In regard to rice, the local production is very far short of requirements,
and in other rice-producing countries also shortage has been reported ; and,
generally speaking, with Asia’s shortage and increasing population, more and
more attention will be devoted to flour and such products as beans, millet,
&0., and the consumption of flour will gradually increase to much larger
proportions —not only in Japan, but also Java and other Asiatic countries.

In regard to exports, coal is Japan’s principal item of export in
competition on certain markets that could be controlled from Australia ; and
to demonstrate how Japan has built up her export trade, the following

.Total exports ... ... ... ... ... £155,623,000'

The above does not include Government stores, amounting to £10,846,000,
as follows: —lmports of merchandise, £9,287,000; exports of Indian
merclmndi.se, £1,478,000, and re-exports of foreign merchandise, £Bl,OOO.
Owing to the war, the demands of the Allies stimulated the exports of
commodities of vital or national importance, and at the same time practically
altered the pre-war directions of trade.
The higher price ruling in 1918 equalled fully 8 per cent for imports, and
9 per cent, for exports, compared with 1917.
Scarcity of tonnage added much to the restriction of both imports and
exports,

Conclusion.
In view of the fact that it is hopeless to expect trade with India and
Burma until normal conditions arc'resumed in regard to shipping, &c., I have
not gone into details in this report so extensively as in previous despatches,
still the particulars given should prove of interest to Now South Wales
importers and exporters.

Report on Trade of the Philippine Islands, 1918.
Commercial Commissioner in the East,
Government of the State of New South "Wales,
Kobe, 2 sth April, 1919.
The Honorable the Premier,
Sydney, Now South "Wales.
Sir,
I have the honor to submit my report on the trade of the Philippine
Islands for the calendar year 1918,
Taking the exchange at 2s. 2d. per peso.
the total imports equalled ... ... £31,1363,162
Total exports ... ... ... ... £39,292,138
Balance of Trade in favor of. the Islands ,£>7,928,970
In the exports an allowance must bo made for £6ll ,098, ■ representing
foreign merchandise re-exported.
Compared with the previous year, there was an increase* of £7,107,139 in
total imports, and £8,577,871 in total exports. Inflated values as a re.sult
of the war added considerably to the totals. With the exception of buffaloes,
cattle, motion pictures, dairy products, illuminating oils, paper, perfumery,
soap and sugar and molasses, there were increases in all lines of imports to
the Islands.

Now that peace would appear to he in sight and a possibility of normal
conditions being resumed at an early date, I can only hope that more atteu ti< »n
will be devoted to the Philippines; and in .addition to food supplier bliat
special efforts will be made to regain some of ■oar lost coal trade. 1 J i this
report I have not gone into details, as in former reports, owing to figures not
being to hand at time of writing. Should any further details bo required
later on, I will supply if necessary.
Yours faithfodly,

Report on the Trade of Java and Madoera, 1918.
Commercial Commissioner’ in tire East,
Government of the State of N.S.W.,
Kobe, 15th September, 1919.
The Honorable the Premier,
Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.
Sir,
I have the honor to submit my report on the trade of Java and
Madoerafor 1918.
In previous reports I have included for the whole of the Islands of the
Archipelago, but as the latter statistics are not available, I am only quoting
for the two leading commercial centres—viz ;—Java and Madoera.
General Merchandise.

Government imports ... ... ... ... £2,280,018

It will be seen from the above that the imports are in excess of the exports,
and thus giving a balance of trade against Java and Madoera.

During the war the trade of the Dutch East Indies was greatly hampered
owing to paucity of shipping and general unrest in regard to the war, and
even now that peace has been restored it will yet take some time before
normal conditions are resumed. The great epedemic of influenza and heavy
death rate added much to tho retarding influences of 1918.
Food Supplies,
During the year a great shortage of rice was apparent, and heavy demands
made upon Burma and elsewhere, but the supplies fell short of demands, and
hence a lot of attention was focussed on flour and other products, and
hence my cable to your office from Java in the early part of this year.
During my visit to the Dutch East Indies, and in order to overcome a
further contemplated rice shortage, the government had in view a scheme to
increase the area for rice cultivation by curtailing by 30 per cent, the area
under sugar cultivation.
For European food supplies of all grades, the inhabitants of the Dutch
East Indies are dependent on outside supplies, and I again specially invite
attention to the statistics quoted in this report, more especially in regard to
flour, tinned provisions, and all grades of food supplies, and not forgetting
coal, live stock, and iron and steel.
Already our competitors from across the Pacific are very active, and l
getting in close touch with all loading agents and consumers. If Australia
will only do likewise and specially cater for the market, and more especially
in the matter of tinned provisions and attractive “get up,” I feel that any
energetic efforts will be rewarded.
Your faithfully,
J. B. SUTTOB.

NEW SOUTH WALES.
REPORT TO THE PREMIER
ON THE
TRADE OF CHINA
FOR THE YEAR 1918.
BY J. B. SUTTOR, A.M.I.C.E.
Commercial Commissioner for New South Wales in the East,
SYDNEY:
W. A. GULUCK, GOVERNMENT PRINTER
1919.


Report on the Trade of China, 1918.
'Report to The Premier by the Commercial Commissioner in the East for
the Government of the State of New South Wales, on tho Trade of
China for the Year 1918.
Kobo, 24-th .June, 1919.
Sir,
Lhftvo tli0 : honor to submit my report on the, trade of China for 1918 b
.Jhe unsettled and disturbed.;conditions due. to ..the great : European, w.ar
continued in full force during 1918, and the available tonnage grow less and
leas by continuous withdrawals for war purposes, both of ocean liners and
coastal steamers—the result being that freight rates soared higher and higher.
In regard to goods generally—although the high rate of exchange favoured
imports—»atiU thq, enormous freights demanded , generally made, ;ppi«e», pro-
hibitive.-when the, gpods. were landed in China ports.. This, combined with
the restrictions of belligerent Governments with regard to imports and
exports, made it almost an impossibility in many lines to do business ; and
the outbreak of Bolshevism in Chimds- northern neighbour, Russia, heralded
in tho virtual extinction of Russian credit.
While Europe was plunged in a life and death struggle, China was bathed
in internal bloodshed and civil strife, which, according to the Statistical
Secretary for the Maritime Customs, partly laid waste some of tho largest
and fairest provinces in China. In addition to the above, in the early part
of 1918 China was again visited by an epidemic of pneumonic plague, which
started in the north and worked as far south as Nanking, with heavy loss of
life. Brigandage was also rampant during theyoar; and, all things considered,
China is yet far from getting her house in order, It is in such a state of
uncertainty and chaos that the commerce of China is carried on.
Currency.
The currency question was also full of interest during tho year; and, in
order to give an idea of the values in sterling of tho Haikwan tael, in which
Customs values are stated, I beg to quote the following:— a. d.
In 1909 the Haikwan tael equalled ... ... 2

The negotiations which hadibeen: started in 1917' between Great Britain
and the United States to stabilise the price of silver culminated in April,
1918, in an A’ct of Congress' empowering the United States Treasury to melt
into bullion and dispose of 350,000,000 gold dollars of the coined silver
reserve, in the United States Treasury., The price of. the metal was fixed at
one dollar gold per ounce. To replace-the coin disposed of, the Treasury is
bound to buy at the fixed standard price, but in its ■ own- good time, an
equivalent amount of silver produced by mines in the United States.
For a time, heavy shipments of silver went to China from, America, but
the urgent needs of Great Britain and India led the United States
Government in August last to raise the price of silver to. 101| cents;per
ounce, and at,the same time to replace restrictions on the export of. bullion
save under special license—the result being that very little, or no silver has
since been sent to China from America.
In harmony with the measures taken by the United States, Great Britain
raised the price, of silver, firstly, to 48[§ pence, and subsequently to 49J
pence per ounce, to bring it up to the United States rate of 101 cents gold
per ounce. On the Gth of. December, 1918, the. British rate.per ounce was
lowered to pence per ounce.
From the above, it is safe to predict that it will be along time- before the
silver dollars in China again fall to pre-war rates.
Foreign" Trade op China.
The direct foreign trade: of China for 1918 was the greatest,, on, record.
Reduced to sterling at 4s. 3J-sd. for 1917, and os. 3|d. for 1918, there was an
increase of ,£56,527,700 for 1918 compared with 1917, the total trade for
1917 being £218,573,277, and for 1918, £275,100,977; and* when the
adverse conditions mentioned on page 1 are taken into consideration, one
realises what a wonderful country China is. Under normal conditions, and
with freedom from internal troubles and complications, combined with
placing of the currency on . a sound footing, China is capable of becoming
one of, if nop the greatest trading centre in the -world. ,
Tariff Revision;
During tho year the Chinese tariff of 1902 was revised after much
discussion, and eventually the years 1912-16 were taken as a basis for values
for the,revised duties and agreed.upon. In some cases duty rates have been
more than doubled; in others■ they have been lowered; and it i,s also
reported that sense ad valorem rates have been. converted to .specific duties.
In such cases, seeing that the 1912-16 values were-much below’-those of
to-day, China' will not gain much by the con versionof ad' valorem to specific
duties. At the' same time,-tbe Inspector-General of‘Customs estimates an
increase of probably 25 per cent in revenue.

Conclusion.
There has been much activity by Japanese and others in exploiting the
metal and mineral resources of China owing to difficulties of obtaining
supplies from elsewhere, and hence the above details of Metal and Mineral!
exports should prove of interest to-New South Wales. •
Flour exports as per details at page 10 are also of interest from the fact
that China exported in 1918 two and a half times more than in 1917.
When in Java in the early part of this year, great demands were being made
on China for wheat flour to meet .the shortage in rice, and doubtless the-
influences were at work in other localities. Generally speaking, the Chinese
flour is of a very low grade, but when rice and other food supplies are scarce
readily finds a market ; but I question if China will have- the same export-
able surplus in 1919 that she had in 1918.

NEW SOUTH WALES.
REPORT TO THE PREMIER
ON THE
TRADE OF CEYLON
FOR THE YEAR 1918.
BY J. B. SUITOR, A.M.I.C.E.
Commercial Commissioner for New South Wales in the East
Sydney :
WILLIAM, Applegate Gullick, Government Printer.
XQKJ'


Report on the Trade of Ceylon, 1918.
Commercial Commissioner in the East)
Government of. the State of New. South Wales,
Kobe, 18 September, 1919'.
The Honorable the Premier,
Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.
Sir,
I have the honor to submit my report on the trade of Ceylon for the
year 1918.
During the year, and oven at time of writing, the continued shortage of
tonnage and food supplies' caused considerable anxiety, and the Government
was compelled to intervene, and the principal articles, such as flour, sugar,
coal, petrol, cotton goods, and rice wore brought under the control of the
customs authorities. The large demands made on India for flour by the-
British Government necessitated a considerable reduction on the demands,
for Ceylon, and local importations had to be regulated by a system of tele-
graphic licenses issued by the Ceylon Customs to regular importers, the
total quantity for the year being limited to two-thirds of the average importa-
tions for the two previous years.
The requisitioning of the Dutch steamers by the British and American.
Governments also cut off the supplies of sugar, and the general shortage o£
coal, petrol, and other goods was duo to paucity of shipping.
The shortage of rice caused the greatest anxiety, and is still a very critical
question from the fact that Ceylon has been hitherto at the mercy of India
and Burma, and the failure of the crop in Southern India forced more attention,
on Burma, but the shortage in tonnage proved a serious impediment, and,
it was not until the end of the year that arrangements were made for more,
satisfactory supplies. The rice question and general food supplies is not
only a burning question in Ceylon, but the greater portion of Asia can also,
be included, and if Australia can only be blest with an exportable surplus-
of flour and other food supplies the prospects are very hopeful.
■ Imports and Exports.
The total imports during the year equalled £11,847,784, and the total
exports equalled £14,088,356. Compared with 1917, there is a falling off
in both imports and exports.

Conclusion.
In concluding this report on the trade of Goylon for 1918, I hope that a
close' study will bo made of the imports of interest to Australia, while it is
true there is still a great shortage in available tonnage. Still, the time
should not bo far distant when normal conditions will be resumed on the
Suez route with all steamers, making Colombo a regular port of call as before
the war, and hence the prospects for increased business in general food supplies
should offer very favourable encouragement; but in regard to coal supplies
it is true there are difficulties unless sent by ordinary colliers, but without
any immediate prospects of return loading.
Prom now oti great changes are going to take place in Asia, of which the
Island of Ceylon is going to prove a more and more important commercial
centre in both imports and exports. 1 have, &0.,
