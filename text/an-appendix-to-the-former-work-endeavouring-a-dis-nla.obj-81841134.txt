AN
APPENDIX
TO THE
FORMER WORK,
Endeavouring a Difcovery of the
UNKNOWN PARTS of the WORLD.
SN D here we are upon a new and
ftrange Adventure , which no
Knight Errant ever undertook
before. Of things unknown, as
there is commonly no delire, fo
lefs Difcourfe can probably be
made upon them. By unknown
therefore we muft underftand lefs
known , or not well difeovered j
and in that fenfe we may as well endeavour' to fay fome-
what 6f them, as others with more pains and hazard to at-
tempt the Difcovery. And to fay truth,even in the known
parts of the World there is much unknown; as in the
beft and moft flourilhing Kingdoms of the Earth there is
fomewafte ground, either not cultivated at all, ornotfo
well inhabited as the reft of the Countrey. For befides
many vaft Tradis of ground in the North and North-weft
parts of Tartary , and fuch parts of India as lie North-
wards towards Delanguer, Nangrocot , the Eaft parts of
Caucafus , and the Realms of Camay ; it is conceived that
the greateft part of the Midlands of Africk are undifeo-
vered to this day, or the knowledge of them fo imperfedt
as comes near a Nefcience; and for America , not rec-
koning in the Northern Borders, (which are in part to be
the Subjeft of this Enquiry) it is affirmed of the Midlands
by John deLaet , (who hath made the moft exadl defecti-
on of it that ever was extant) minima, fui parte perlttftra-
tumeffe, that the leaftpartof them hath been difeove-
red hitherto to any purpofe. Leaving thefe therefore as
before without farther fearch, we will divide the Un-
KNOWN WORLD into thefe two parts; i .Terra
Incognita Borealis , and 2. Terra Incognita Aufiralis :
which with their Subdivifions we will now purfue.
TERRA INCOGNITA BOREALIS.
TERRA INCOGNITA BOREALIS is that part of
the Unknown World which lieth towards the North j ,
and is to bcconfidered in thefe three Notions, i. As di- (
redUy under the Pole, which for diftindfion fake we will I
call Orhis Arfticus ; 2. as lying to the North-eaft on the <
back of Europe and Afia jor3. on the North-weft, on the ;
back of America . 1
I. ORB IS ARCTIC US is that part of Terra i
Borealis Incognita which lieth under or about the Arftick r
Pole 5 the Situation and Dimenfions of which being ta- C
ken with the Aflrolahe by an Oxford Frier , are by Mer- C
cam thus defcribed out of the Itinerary of James Cnoxe v
of Bois le due, or the Brfche , a Town of Brabant. v
<e Under the Arttic\ Pole (faith he) is faid to be a J
black Rock of wondrous height, about 33 Leagues in 5
I tC compafie, the Land adjoyning being torn by the Sea ii>
? ?to four great Elands. For. the Ocean violently break-
? ing through it, and difgorging it felf by 19 Chanels,ma-
? kechfour Euripi or fierce Whirl-pools, by which the
? Waters are finally carried toward the North, and there
? fwallowed into the Bowels of the Earth. That Eurnus
?or Whirl-pool which is made by the Scythick Ocean
? hath five Inlets, and by reafon of his ftreight paffage
�� and violent courfe is never frozenjthe other on the back
?of Groenlandy being 37 Leagues long, hath three In-
ec letSj and remaineth frozen three moneths yearly. Be*
? tween thefe two there lieth an Eland on the North of
c< Lappia and they fay,by Pyamiesy the
? tailed of them not above four foot high. A certain Scho-
? Jar of OAr/W reporteth, that thefe four Euripi are car-
? ried with fuch furious violence towards fome Gulf, in
? which they are finally fwallowed up, that no Ship is able
�� with never fo ftrong a Gale to ftem the Current,and yet
C� that there is never fo ftrong a Wind as to blow a
�� Windmill. The like is reported by GiraldusCambrenHs
�� in his Book De mirahilihus Hibernia . So far and to this
purpofe he. But Btundevile our Countreyman is of ano-
ther opinion, (as indeed who not I) neither believing
that Pliny or any other of the Roman Writers came hither
to deferibe this Promontory } or that the Oxford Frier,
without the alliftence of fome cold Devil of the middle
Region of the Air, ( and confequently able to endure all
Weathers ) could approach fo near as to measure thefe
cold Countreys with his Afrolaie, or take the height of
this black Rock with his JacoVs Staff. Leaving this
therefore as more fit for Lucians, Dialogues then any fc-
rious Difcourfe, we will proceed to matters of more truth
and certainty.
2. The NORTH-WEST partsef Terra Incog-
nita Borealis are thofe which lie on the back of Efotilandy
the moft Northern Province of America : by which it
hath been much endeavoured to find out a paflage to Ca-
thay and China, and not to go fo far about as either by the
Cape of Good Hope , or the Streights of Magellan. At-
tempted firftby Sebaftian Cabot, Anno 1497�at the charge
of Henry the 7. of England. But having difcovered as far
as to the 67. Degree of Northern Latitude, by the muti-
ny of his Mariners he was forced to return; when find-
ing great preparations for a War with Scotland , that bufi-
nefle for the prefent was laid afide. Refumed by Gafpar
Carter ialis a Portugal , Anno I $OO, and after by Stephen
Gomez, a Spaniard, in the year 152$ 5 but neither of them
went fo far to the North as Cabot. The Spaniards not-
withftanding would not fo give over, but firft with five
Ships from the Groyn , and afterwards by two from New ?
Spain, fent out by Cortez, ? purfued the Hntcrprife: which


proving as fuccefslefs as the former had been, odealioned
Charles the 5. then preparing for Italy , on the payment
of 35000 Ducats by King John the third, to fufpend the
profecuiion of it. Followed with greater industry, but
as bad fuccefs, by Sir Martin Frohijher , who made three
Voiages for thefe parts, (the firft of them in the year
1579,) aad brought home fome of the Natives, a Sea-U-
-nicorn?s Horn, ({fill kept in the great Wardrobe of Wind-
for Caftle ) and a great deal of the Ore of that Countrey,
found upon trial, when in England , not to quit the Colt.
A great Promontory which he paffed by he called Queen
kli&aheth' s Foreland , in whofe name he took poffeffion of
it; and the Sea running not far off he called Frohijher $
Sfreights. The Seas full fet with Icie islands, fome of them
half a mile about, and eighty Fathoms above Water;
the People like the Samoeds , the worft kind of Tmars, in
their Lives and Habit. John Davies followed the DeSign
Anno 1585, at the encouragement of Sir Francis Wolfing-
ham, then principal Secretary of Eftate; and having in
three Voiages difeovered to the Latitude of 73, by rea-
fon of the many difficulties which he found in the Enter-
prife, and the death of Mr. Secretary, he was fain to give
over; leaving unto a narrow Sea on the North of Efioti-
land the name of Fretum Davies , in the Latitude of 6$
and 2oMmutes,by which name it is ftill called. After him
followed Weymouth, Hall, Hudfon, Button, Baffin, Smith,
all Englifh, The refult of whofe Endeavours was the
finding of fome cold Ifles and points of Land, which they
named King James his Cape, Qs&tnAnns Cape, Prince
Henrie's Foreland , Saddlflfland, Barren-Ijland, Red-
goof e Ijland, Diggs his Ijland ; all of them betwixt 80 and
si : and theimpofing on fome paffages and parts of the
Sea the names of Hackluyt?s Headland , Smith?s Bay,
Hudfon s Streights. Maudlin's Sound, Fair Haven , and
the like marks and monuments of their Undertakings.
Nothingatchieved ofpublick moment, but the Difcovery
of an island called Cherry Ijland in the Latitude of 74,
and the Shores of a large piece of the Continent, which
they caufed to be called King James his Nets Land, moft
commonly Greenland ; where they found many white
Bears, with white, gray and dun Foxes,Partridges,Geefe,
and fome other Provisions* Sea-Unicorns Horns, great
ftoreof Morfes , (or Sea-Horfes) the Oil and Teeth
whereof yield no fmall Commodity. But moft considera-
ble for the Trade qf Whale-fifhing, which our men ufe
yearly upon thofe Coafts; of whofe Oil, Bones and Brain
f this laft fuppofed to be the true Sperma Ceti , now ufed
as Medicinal ) they raifed very great profit.
3. The NO RTH-E A ST parts of Terra Incogni-
ta Borealis are thofe - vybich lie on the North of Rujfia
and Tart ary, by which the like paflage towards Cathay and
China hath been oft attempted ? and hitherto with like
fuccefs. Endeavoured firft by Sebaflian Cabot, the Son of
John Cabot , fo oftentnentroned before, by him trained
up in the Difcovery of the Nonh-eaft parts of America,
His Employment failing here in England , he betook him-
felf unto the fervice of the King of Spain ; and coming
out of Spain , Anno 1 $49, was by King Edward the Sixth
made grand Pilot of Englandy with an Annual Penfion of
166 /. 13 s. 4d. In the year 1553 he was the chief Dea-
ler and Procurer of the Difcovery of Rujfia and the
North-eaft Voiages, undertaken and performed by Sir
Hugh Willoughby , Chancellour , Burroughs Jenkjnfon > and
after profecuted by Pet and Jackman. Some of which pe-
rished in the Action, and were frozen to death ?, their
Ship being found the next year hemmed about with Ice,
and a particular account of all things which had happened
to them. Others with better fortunes found the way to
Rujfia, (Since that time made a common Voiage without
dread or danger ) and palling down the Volga to the Ca-
ffian Sea, and by that to were kindly entertained
m the Court of the Sophie. The Hollanders in the year
1594, and in fome years after, tried their Fortune al-
fo, under the Condudt and Direction of one william Ba-
rendfonthzw chief Pilot; but vvf nt no farther then the
Engli/hhld gone before them* yet gave un-
to all places as theypatfed, as if they had been the firft
Difcoverers, with Pride and Arrogance enough. No-
thing fince done of any note or confideration for the 0-
pemngof thisNorth-eaft paflage, or giving us any bet-
ter account of the North of Tart ary ,orany Countreys
beyond that, but vVhat we had many fince out of
Panins Venitus : fo that we are but where we were, in a
Terr a Incognita. And though I would not willingly dif-
couragc any noble A�t ions, or brave and gallant Under-
takings ; yet when I look upon the natures of thofe Shores
and Seas, thofe tedious Winters of ten moneths, with no
Summer following, the Winds continually inihe North,
and the main Ckean paved with Ice fo long together ; I
cannotchufe but rank the hopes of thefe Northern Paf-
fages amongft thofe Adventures which are onely com-
mendable for the Difficulties prefented in them.
TERRA AUSTRALIS INCOGNITA.
With better hopes we may go forwards on the next
Difcovery, and try what may be done on Te?a
Auftralis, or the Southern Continent, though hitherto
Incognita alfo,. almoft as much unknown as the
Iflands* which none but my good Frier of Oxon had the
hap to meet with. A Continent conceived by our Lear-
ned Breremod to be aS large as Europe , Afia and Africa :
and that upon fuch ftrength of Reafons as cannot oe ea~
fily over-born by any oppofite. His Arguments in brief
arethefe. i. That as touching Latitude, feme parts
thereof come very near to the 9 if they come not
alfo on this fide of it: and as for Longitude, it keepetb a*
long, though at feveral difiances, the whole continual
courfe of the other Continents. 2. It is clearly known,
that in the other two Continents the Land which lieth
on the North-fide of that Line is four times at the leaft
as large as that which lieth South thereof; and therefore,
fince the Earth is equally poized on both fides of the
Centre, it muft needs be that the Earth in anfwerable
meafure and proportion muft advance it felf in feme pla-
ces above the Sea on the South-fide of the Line, as it doth
in others on the North. By confequence, what is wanting
in the South parts of the other two Continents to coun-
tervail the North-parts of them, muft of necelfitybe fup-
plied in the Southern Continent.
The Countrey being fo large, fofree from the Incum-
brances of Frofts and Ice and endlefle Winters , I have
oft marvelled with my felf that no farther progrefle hath
been made in Difcovery of it: confidering chiefly by the
Site and Pofition of the Countrey, efpecially in thofe
parts which lie neareft Afia , that there is nothing to be
looked for elfewhere, either of profit or of pleafure, but
may there be found. Whether it be that there is fomc
Nil ultra put to humane endeavours j or that this people
are not yet made ripe enough to receive the Gofpel; or
that the great Princes of the Earth think it no good Po-
licy to engage themfelves in new Difcoveries,till the old
be throughly planted and made lure unto them; or that
the Merchant, who in matters of this nature hath a pow-
erful! influence, thinks his hands full enough already, and
being fettled in fo many and fo wealthy Fa&ories,will not
adventure upon more: Which of all thefe ,or whether
all thefe together be the caufe of this-Stop, lam not able
to determine. Certain it is, that here is a large Field, e-
nough for Covetoufneffe, Ambition, or defire of Glory,


to t'pend chemfelves in j eiiough to fatisfie the greateil and ?
molt hungry appetite of Empire, Wealdi and world-
ly pleafures; befide the Gallantry and Meric ot fo brave
an Aftion. Molt which hath hitherto been done in it
hath been "by the encouragement of the Vice-Roys oiNew
Spain and Peru : by the firftof which we came acquain-
ted with theCoalts of Nova Guinea ; by the latter, with
thofe Countreys called the I/lands of Solemn, but whether
Continent or Iflands, not yet fully known. -
And vet we mult not rob Magellanns of his part ot the ,
Honour, who, parting through the Streights which now
bear his name , difcovered thofe parts of it which, from
the Fire thence feen, he called Terra del Fuego , found by
the Hollanders of late under James le Maire to be an I-
{land. Nordothe��g/i/& or the Dutch want their parts
herein, though what they did was rather Accidental then
upon Defigh. For in the year 15,93, Sir Richard Haw-
kins, being bound for the Streights of Magellan, was by a
crolfe Wm<4 driven on feme parts of this Continent, to
which he gave the name of Hawkins his Maj.de n~land $
a Promontory of it fhooting into the Sea vyith three Points
be called Point Tremontain ? and a pleaiant Ifle not tar
off, by the name of Fair I [land. Sailing along thefe
Coafts in the 50, Degree of Southern Latitude, for the
fpace of fixty miles and upwards, he Found the Countrey
as he palfed to be very pleafant ; and by the Fires which
he faw in the night, to be well inhabited. By the like ac-
cident, Anno 1599) Sibaldde Weert, a Hollander , in his
return from the Streights of Magellan, fell upon fome
Iflands of this Southern Continent, in the Latitude ot
fifty Degrees and forty Minutes, which he caufed to be
called Sibald* s Iflands. And befides thefe we owe to the
Portugals the Difcovery of fuch parts hereof as they fell
on in their way to the Eaftern Indies , of Which we have
Jittk but the names: as i.PfittacorumTerraJo called from
the abundance of Parrots which they faw on the Coafls
over againft the Cape of good Hope '?> 2. Beach, a Region yiel-
ding Gold,and poffeffed by Idolaters* with the two King-
doms of, 3. Lucach , and 4. Maletur * all three againft
the Ifles of Java, from which little diftant.
But the greateft light we have to fee by into this dark
bufindfe is by the Voiages and Adventures ot the Spa-
niards, employed by the two Vice-Roys of Peru and
Mexico, as before was faid. For in the year is 43
Governour of New Spain then being fent Villa Lobos with
a Fleet towards the Moluccas , who in that Voiage made
a Difcovery of a rich and flourifhing Countrey, which he
named Nova Guinea , by others ftnee his time called Terra
de Piccinacoli : and in the year 1563 Caftro the Licen
tiate , then Vice-Roy of Peru, fent a Fleet from Lima,
which under the Conduct of Lopez. Garcia de Caftro dif-
fered the Iflands of Solomon. To which if we fubjoin
the fuccefs of the Hollanders in the Difcovery of F return
le Maire, and the Lands ad joyning, the heft Defcription
we can make of this Southern Continent muft be in the
Chovography and Hiftory of their Adventures ; viz..
I.Terra del Fogo, l.lnfuhe Sokmonis, 3- Nova Guinea :
beginning firft with Terra del Fogo , becaufe neareft
ERR A DEL FUEGO lies on the other fide
of the Streights of Magellan , heretofore thought to be
a part of Terra Auftraits Incognita, or the Southern Con-
tinent* but is now difcovered to be an Ifland by one Ja-
cob Maire of Amflerdam , accompanied by Cornelius
Schmen of Hoorn, both Hollanders . They began their
Voiage on the 15. of June, Anno i6is, and on the 19*
of January following they fell even with the Streight, of
Magellan. On the 24. of the fume Moneth they had the
fight of another Streight, which Teemed to feparate this
Terra del Fuego from the reft of the Southern Continent 5
and on the 2y. they entred into it. That part of the Land
which (being entred into the Streights) they had on the
Weft,they called Terra Mauritiide Najfau ; that on the
Eaft, Statenland 3 the Streight it left?, Freturn le Maire.
The entrance into the Streight they found to be in s<3
Degrees ot Southern Latitude and $0 Minutes j the Wa-
ter running into the North Sea with fo violent an Eddie,
ut adverfum marts <tjh*m difficuher fuperare pojfemus, faith
he who in the way of Journal or Ephemendes hath de-
ferred the whole courfe of this Voiage. In the whole
courfe thereof nothing fo much obfervable (befides the
Difcovery ) as that they found that at their coming home
they had loft a Day, ( as muft needs happen unto fuch as
info tedious a Voiage had travelled Weft ward) that be-
ing Saturday to them which was Sunday to the Hollander *
and the reft of Europe ; though they had calculated the
Days fine? their going out with all exa&neffe. So that if
there were any fuch Morality in the Sabbath as fome
men pretend, thefe men muft either keep their Sabbath
on a different day from the reft of their Countreymen, or
otherwife, to comply with them, muft be guilty of the
breach.of the Sabbath all the reft of their Lives. But of.
this more at large elfewhere. To return therefore to
this Streight : it is faid to be feven Dutch miles or 28 of
ours in length, and of a fair and equal breadth; plentiful!
of good Fifh, efpecially of Sea-Calves and Whales. A-
bout the inferring of which Streight into the third Edition
of my Microcofm, I received a Letter at fuch time as the
Parliament was held in Oxon Anno 162 y , fubferibed
G ? B. and a little under that. Sub granda floridus : which
whether it were the Gentleman?s Motto, or the Anagram
of his Name, I am not able to fay,having never heard more
of him from that time forwards, though his defire were
fatisfied in the next Edition of that Work. For my en*
couragement wherein he gave me this direction follow*
ing. ?The News (faith he J of this New Streight com*
?mg into Spain , it pleafed the King, in the year 1618,
? to fend and fearch whether the truth were anfwerable
? unto the Report. And finding it to be much broader
? then the other, and not above feven Dutch miles long ,
? he decreed, that being the more eafie and compendious
? way for Navigators, and lefs fubjeft to dangers, his
? Auxiliary Forces fhould be fent that way into the Eaft-.
? Indies,to defend the Philippine and Molucca Iflands, and
? the way by the Cape of good Hope to be left. In regard
? that every fuch Voiage required] twice as much time ?
? befides the variety of Winds, and often change of the
?Air, notonelytroublefomejbutfullof Difeafes, con**
?fumeth the one half of the men before they return.
� Whereas this way gained] lime (and, if need be, they
?may difpatch bufinefs .they travel into
? the Eaft ) without any extraordinary danger or loffe of
? men. So far the very words of my Letter. The In-
telligence given me in this find confirm?d in a
Relation of the Voiage made by Captain Don Juan de
More, Anno 1618, at the command and charge of the
King of Spain, who prefently arm?d and furnifh?d eight
call Ships to fend this new way unto his Philippines and
Molucca s , under the Condudf of Petrus Michael us dt
Cor doe lea. Since it hath been found by experience that
even from our parts to the Molucca's through this Fre~
turn de Maire , is but a paffage of eight Moneths, fine ul-
la inflgni navigantium clade , faith the Narratour. But of
this Streight enough to fatisfie my unknown Well-willer?s
Requeft, and inform my Reader: being extreamly forry
that the Gentleman was not pleafed to impart his name,
that fohis Memory might have lived in thefe Papers, if
they themfelves be deftinate to a longer Life.
Now for the nature of the Soil , it is faid to be very
full of Mountains ; but thofe Hills apparelled with
l 59
terra incognita


Woods , intermixt with Valleys; the Valleys for the
moft part full of little Brooks, which fall down from the
Mountains, and afford good Pafturage i the Sea-coafts
well provided with Bays and Roads, not unfafe for Ship-
ping: though the Air every-wbere, but chiefly near the
Sea, be much fubjeft toTempefts. As for the People,
they are raid to be of a white Complexion but their
Faces, Arms and Thighs, coloured with a kind of Oker :
of full Stature and well-proportioned, their Hair black,
which they wear long, to feem more terrible. The Men
moft generally naked, the Women onely lhaded on their
fecret parts with a piece of Leather.
Towns they have none, nor any Habitations which de-
face the name of Houfes; fo that the moft which we can
doe is to coaft the Ifland. In which we find towards Ma-
re del Noordt , T. A large Arm of the Sea called Entra-
dodi S. Sehajlian, 2 ? The Capeo/ S. Ives. Mauri-
tius Land. 4. Promontorio de Buen Sufeio ,or the Cape
of GoodSuccefs. Oppofite whereunto in another Ifland
is the Cape of S. Bartholomews , and betwixt them the
Streight called Fretum le Maire. Then in the New
South-fea , as they call it, there are , $. Barnevelt's Ifland.
6. The Iflands of S . Ildefonfo* 7* Cap t Horn, on a fair
Promontory* in the South-weft Ande, which doubled
the Countrey goes along with a ftraight Shore, on which
I find fome Bays and Capes, but no names unto them *
till we come to the Weftern entrances of the Streight
of Magellan, oppofite unto Cape Viftoria, fo often men-
tioned,
2. IN S ULt/E SOLO MON IS, or the Iflands
of Solomon , are fituate on the Weft of Terra del Fooo,
II Degrees on the South of the ALquinaftial. Difcove-
red in the year 1567, by Lopez. Garcia de Cafire, fent by
the Vice-Roy .of Peru to find out new Countreys. By
him thus named , in hope that men would be rather in-
duced to inhabit in them; imagining that Solomon had his
Gold from thefe Lands of Ophir.
In number they are many, but 18 the principal.- Some
of which 300 miles incompafs, others 200, and others of
them lefs,till we come to fifty,and beneath that,none. ' All 1
liberally furnilhed with Dogs, Hogs, Hens, Cloves, Gin- 1
ger, Cinnamon, and fome Veins of Gold. The chief of
thefe eighteen are, 1. Guadalcanal, fuppofed to be the
greateftof them : upon the Coaft whereof the Spaniards <
failed Iso Leagues, where they found a Town which they f
burned and facked, becaufe the people of it, by a fudden r
furprize, had killed fourteen of their men. 2. S. Ifahella , v
Iso Leagues in length,and 18 in breadth j the Inhabitants n
fome black, fome white, fome of brown Complexion, k
.3. S. Nicholas, 100 Leagues in compafs, inhabited by a w
People which are black of hue, but raid to be more wit- p
ty then the otherSayages. Aft of them fituate betwixt the tl
Streights of Magellan and the Iflands of Thieves', and n
yet not well agreed upon amongft our Authours, whether fi
to be accounted Iflands, or a part of the Continent; the pc
Spaniards having failed 700 Leagues on the Coafts here- dt
or, and yet not able to attain unto any certainty. But tf
being they pafs generally in account for Iflands, and by R
that name are under the Vice-Roy of Peru, who ap-' J\
points their Governours, let them pafle fo ftill.
3, NOV A GUINEA lieth beyond the Iflands ve
of Solomonm refpeft of us, proceeding, as we have be- is
gun, from the Land of Fire.Difcovered,as before was faid, va
Anno 1543? by Villa Lohos', ( Herrera Dif- re
covery of it to Alvarez, de Saavedra , and lets it higher, tr
in the year 1527, ) more perfectly made known, if I Pi
gueffe aright, by Ferdinando de Quir , who being fent D.
with two, Ships to make a more full Difcovery of the I- foi
Hands of Solomon , and taking his courfe about the height or
of the Magellan Streights, difeovered a main Land coming idi
h � up clofe to the .Equinoaial, on the Coafts whereof he
he failed Bod Leagues, ti� he found hrmfelf at laft in the Ha-
fts titude of 15 Degrees, difcovering a large Bay into which
p- ell two great Rivers, where he purpofed to fettle aPlan.
he ration, and to that end prefented a Petition to the Kina of

: ' r ?L ?V� be N � v f Guinea. coming up clofe as that doth to
V- and alter turning to the South towards

ir the Reader this Defcnpcion of it, out of his Memorials,
in which U is foberly affirmed to be a Terreftnal Paradife
!- for Wealth and Pleafures. The Countrey is plentiful! of
in I rruits, Cora-nuts, Almonds of four forts, Pome-citrons

w feemmgto promife much felicity within the Land. The

ir to be full of Bays, Havens,and the Exits of Rivers, makinp
1, r fliew as of another China . The Inhabitants he affirmeth
h to be innumerable, fome white, fome like the Mulattos

J dicated to the Lady of Loretto.
_ The precife time of this Difcovery I hive no-vvhere
found, but that the time fpent about it is by him affirmed
5? to tiie no fmall of his
Health and Fortunes. Nor do I find that any care was
taken of his Petition, or any thing elfe done by others in
purfuance of his Proportions. Whether it were on any
ot the Reafons before laid down, or that there was no
credit given to his affirmations, I determine nor. Nor
find I that he gave any names to the Bays or Promonto-
ries as he paffed along; but he either took fuch names as
were given before, or found not any thing worth the na-
ming. And for fuch names as were given before, ( ftjfl ta-
km% Ferdinando Quir's new Countrey for Nova Guinea)
we find a Promontory called Cap eHermofo, in the Eait
parts hereof, near the Iflands of Solomon y and not far from
the 2. Another in the Weftern part, but as
j near the called Point Primiro, 3. A third in the
firlt bendings of the Coaft towards the South, called Ca-
po de Buena Defeada , or the Cape of goodDe/ire. 4. Rh
de Talcanesyj.Rio de Lorenz.o , 6. Rio de S. Augufiino.on
the halt of Cap eFormofo towards the Streights. 7. The
Rivers of S. Peter, 8. S.Paul, 9* S* Andrew , and 10. S.
James , betwixt Cape Formofo and Primiro.
But being there is little certain of thefe laft Difco-
yenes, and the greateft certainty we have of that little
is nothing but a Lift of names without any thin CT obfer-
vable in the ftate and ftory of the fame, they may ftill
retain the old name of Terra Incognita. And therefore !
try my Fortune, and without troubling the Vice-Roys of
Peru and Mexico , or taking out Commilfion for a new
Difcovery, will make afeaich into this Terra Auflralis
for fome other Regions, which muft be found either here
orno-where. The names of which are, 1. Mundw alter &
idem, 2* Utopia , 3- New Atlantis } 4. Fairy Land, 5. The


Painters Wive' Si/land, 6. The Lands of Chivalry , and
7 The new World in the Moon .
t '.MIINDH S ALTER ET IDEM, Another
and yet the fame, is a witty and ingenious Inven-
tion of a Learned Prehte,writ by him in his younger days,
(but well enough becoming the aufterityof the gravel*
Head) in vVhich he diftinguifheth the Vices, Palfions,
Humours, and ill Affections moft commonly incident to
ma nkind, into feveral Provinces; gives us the Character
of ?:ach, as in the Defcription of a Countrey, People and
thief Cities of it; and lets them forth to the Eye in
fuc h lively Col ours,that the Vicious man may fee therein
his own Deformities* and the well-minded man his own
Im perfections. The Scene of this Defign is laid by the
Re verend Authour in this Terra Auftralis ?, the Decorum
happily prefervedin the vVhole Difcovery i the Style a-
cut ely clear, the Invention fingular. Of whom and his
Ni'w World I fhall give you that Eulogy which the Hi-
iferian doth of Homer, Nec ante ilium quern ille imitaretur ,
nequepoft ilium qui eum imitari pojfet, inventus eft .
2. JIT OP / A is a Countrey fivft difeovered by Sir
Thomas More, after Lord Chancellour of England, and by
him made a Scene of a Commonwealth, vVhich neither
Solon, nor Lycurgtts, nor any of the Legiflators of former
times did ever dream of; nor had been fanfied by Plato,
Ariftotle, Tally, or any who have written the Idea's of a
Form of Government $ though not reducible to praCfice.
Some of his Plots we have taken notice of already; as viz..
his device to bring Gold and Silver into contempt by ma-
king of thofe Metalls Chains and Fetters for their Male-
factors, Pans of Clofe-ftools, Chamber-pots and Veffels
of fuch unclean ufe ; by impofmg it as a Penalty on infa-
mous perfons, to wear Gold Rings upon their Fingers,
and the like devices; as alfo his device to prevent mif-
takes and diflikes in Marriages, by giving the parties a
full view of each other naked. Many more ProjeCtsof
this nature, fome of. them poflible enough, but fo unpra-
Cticable, fo beyond hope of being looked on in the model-
ling of a Commonwealth, that we may reckon this de-
vice amongft thofe ftrange Fancies, qua nunquam anteafpe
concept a, nedumopere tentata erant. The man indeed (con-
jfidenng the times he lived in)was of rare but this
Utopia fitted onely to, the Meridian of this Southern Con-
tinent , this Terra Auftralis Incognita , in which now we
ire, and io no place elfe.
3. NEW ATLANTIS is an Ifland of this
Southern Continent difeovered by Sir Francis Bacon, the
Learned Vifcountof S. Albans one of Sir Thomas Mere?s
Succelfors in ths place of Lord Chancellour* But far be-
fore him in the excellency and fecibility of his Inventi-
on. It had this name with reference to Atlantis, an Ifland
pf the Weftern or Atlantic^ Ocean , mentioned in the
Works of Plato, both alike invifible. But for his falling
into this Ifland, his Eiefcription of it, the City of Benfa-
lem, and the manner of his reception there, fuch hand-
fome probabilities, and fo fairly carried, that to one not
acquainted with the State of the World it would feem a
Reality. But above all things, the Inventions and De-
figns of Solomons Houfe,for perfe&ing the works ofNa-
ture, or rather improving Nature to the beft advantages
of Life and the benefit of mankind, are beyond compan-
ion. The man I mufl confefle had his perfonal errours, (I
know none Without them ) of good and bad qualities e-
qually compounded ; Mores ejus vigor e & levitate mixtif-
ftmi, as Paterculus once faid of Pijo : not one amongft
many thoufand ( to purfue that Cnara6ier ) quiaut otium
validih diligat, aut fadlius fujfiriat ntgotio. A man of a
moft ftrong Brain, and a Chymical Head. Who, if he had
been entertained with feme liberal Salary,abftra&ed from
all Affairs both of State andjudicature,and furniftied with
fufticiency both of means and helps for the going on in
his Defign,would,l am confident,have given us fuch a Bo-
dy of Natural Philofophy, and made it fo fubfervient to
the publick good, that neither Ariftotle nor Theophra-
ftm amongft the Ancients, nor Paracelfus , or the reft of
our later Chymifts, would have been confiderable.
4. FAIR T-L A N D is another part of this Terra
Incognita, the habitation of the Fairies , a pretty kind of
little Fiends or Pigmey-Devils, but more inclined to
fport then mifehief, of which old Women, who remem-
ber the times of Popery, tell us many fine Stories. A
cleanlier and move innocent Cheat was never put upon
poor ignorant People by the Monks and Friers. Their
habitation here or no-where j though fent occafionally by
Oberon, and their other Kings, to our parts of the World .
For not being reckoned amongft the good Angels,nor ha-
ving malice enough to make them Devils, (but fuch a kind
of middling Spirits as the Latines call Lemures or Lar-
va ) we muft find out fome place for them, neither Hea-
ven nor Hell, and moft likely this. Their Countrey ne-
ver more ennobled then by being made the Scene of that
excellent Poem called the Fairy Queen. Intended to
the honour of Queen Elizabeth, and the greateft perfons
in her Court: but fhadowed in fuch lively colours,framed
fo exa&ly by the Rules of Poefie, and reprefenting fudi
Idea?s of all Moral goodnefle; that as there never was a
Poem more artificial, fo can no Ethical difcoiirfe more
falhion and enflame (he mind to the love of Vertue. Invi-
furum fadlius aliquem qudm imitaturum ) flaall be Spencer?s
Motto; and fo 1 leave him to his reft.
The PAINTER SwITES ISLAND is
an Ifland of this Tra&,mentioned by Sir Walter Raleigh, in
his Hiftory of the World. Of which he was informed by
Don Pedro de Sarmiento, a Spanifh Gentleman, employed
by his King in planting fome Colonies on the Streights of
Magellan, ( which we have touched upon before ) who
being taken Prifoner by Sir Walter in his going home, was
asked of him about fome Ifland which the Maps prelec-
ted in thofe Streights, and might have been of great ufe
to Him in his Undertaking. To which he merrily replied,
that it was to be called the Painter's Wive's / ftahd,
that vvhilft the Painter drew that Map, his Wife fitting
by, dejired him to put in one Csuntrey for her, that [he in
her imagination might have an Ifland of her own. His
meaning was, that there was no fuch Ifland as the Maps
prefented. And I fear the Painter?s Wife hath many
Iflands and fome Countreys too upon the Continent in
our common Maps, which are not really to be found ori
the ftrkft eft feaixh.
6. the LA NDS of CHI TAL RIE are fuch
Iflands, Provinces and Kingdoms*, .in the Books of Erran-
try, which have no being in any4jpo*ft p|ttx>f the World,
and therefore muft be fought in this. A g�>is abfurdity,bpt
frequent in thofe kind of Writers wfio, in deferibing the
Adventures of their Knights, in defpight of
( with which indeed they had no acquaintance ) have not
onely disjoyned Countreys which are near together, and
laid together Countreys which are far remote *, but given
us the defcription of many Iflands, Provinces and mighty
Kingdoms,which,as the ingenious Authour of the Hiftory
of Don QuixotmtnWy obferveth, are not to be found in
al| the Map. Of this fort is the Ifle of Adamants in. Sir
Huonoi Bordeaux', the Firm Ifland, in the Hiftory of A~
madis de Gaul ; the hidden Ifland , and that of (he Sage
Aliart, in Sir Palmerin of England the Iflands of Linda*
raz,a, and the devilifh Fauna, with the Kingdom pf Lyra ,
( of which the Amazonian Lady Archifilora was the right-
full Queen) and many others of that kind, in the Mirrour
of Knighthood ; and divers of like nature in Palmerin de
Oliva , Prmalioni*rd�ilidnisotGr(tecei?arifmus,ibt Ro-


mance of Romance j,and indeed whom not of all that�abble?
handfomly humoured by Michael de Cervantes in his Ifiand
of Barutaria , of which the famous Sanco Panca was fome-
time Govemour, and the Kingdom of Micomicona. And
yet I cannot but confefs(tor I have been a great Student in
thefe�ooks of Chivalry)that they may be of very good ufe
to Children or young Boys in their Adolefcency. Forbe-
fides that they divert the mind from worfe cogitations,
they perfeft him that takes pleafure in them in the way of
Reading, beget in him an habit of fpeaking, and animate
him many times to fuch high conceptions as really may
make him fit for great Undertakings.
7. The NEW WORLD. IN THE MOON was
fir�of Lucian?s difeoveringja man of eminent parts, but
as ill a Confidence,apoflatizing from the Faith in which he
was bred. Arifiophanes had before told us in one of his
Comedies of a Nephelococcygia , or a City of Cuckoes in
the Clouds. But Lucian was the fir� who found out this
New World in the Moon*, of which, and of the Inhabi-
tants of it, he affordeth us in one of his Dialogues a con-
ceited Charafter. But of late times, that World which
he there fanfied, and propofed but as a Fanfie onely, is
become a matter of a more ferious Debate; and fome have,
laboured with great pains to make it probable, that there
5s another world in the Moon , inhabited as this is by per-
rons of divers Languages, Cu�oms, Polities and Reli-
gions : and more then fo, fome means and ways propofed
to confideration for maintaining an entercourfe and Com-
merce betwixt that and this. But being there are like
Endeavours to prove that the Earth may be a Planet, why
may not this Southern Continent be that Planet,and more
particularly that Moon, in which this other World is fup-
pofed to be ? Certainly there are Rronger hopes of find-
ing a New World in this Terra Aujlralis then in the bo-
dy of that Planet } and fuch perhaps as might exceed both
in profit and pleafure the later Difcoveries of America .
But I am no difeourager of Indu�ry and Ingenuity,which
I love and honour wherefoever I find- it. I know great
Truths have many times been Rarted upon lefs prefump-
tions. Nor would Ibe mi�ook, as if in my purfuit of this
Terra Incognita I put fcorn on any of fublimer thoughts $
or that I would have any man fo much in love with
the prefent World, not to look foranother World
in Heaven above. It is reported, that in fome Con-
troverfie betwixt the Polander and the Duke of Mof-
eovy, the King of Poland fent the Mofcovite a cu-
rious Globe, reprefenting the whole Heavenly Bodies,
with the particular motion of each feveral Sphere. To
which the Mofcovite returned this unworthy anfwer Th
mihi Cceium minis , at redde mihiTerras de qaibuscomen-
dimtu i You fend me Heaven, faith he, but that will not
fatisfie, unlefle you give me back thofe Lands which are
now in queftion. And much I fear there are too many of
this mind, who would not lofe their part on Earth for all
Heaven icfelf : whom I defirc, if any fuch perufe-tlhefe
Papers, to confider, that as much as the molt flourishing
Countrey which is here defcribed doth fall fhort of that
Paradife wherein God placed our Father
and infinitely more did that Earthly Paradife fall fhort of
the unfpeakable glories of the Kingdom of Heaven, To
the diligent and carefull fearch of which Heavenly King-
dom I heartily commit the Reader ; not doubting but the
Works of God which are here prefented , and that
vicilfltude of humane Affairs which is herein touched at,
may prompt him to fome ferious thoughts of that mighty
God who made all thefe Works, in whom is no fhew
nor fhadort of change 5 to whom be given all Glory both
in this World, and that to come.

The Verfes are G.Buchanans, in his Book Ve Sahara ;
which I thus tranflate, and therewithal! conclude this
Work ;
The world beneath the Moon its fliapes doth vary,
And change from this to that; nor can it tarry
Long in one ftate, but with it felf doth jar.
Kills and is kill'd in endlefs Civil War.

Neither of Bodies nor of Minds the fame.
But that above the Spheres , the Heavens on high,
In which GOD reigns in glorious Majefty,
Free from old Age, unchang?d, and of one face,
Always prefents it felf in equal Grace.
