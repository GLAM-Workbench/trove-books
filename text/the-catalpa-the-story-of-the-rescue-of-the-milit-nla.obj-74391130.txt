? IfieUMit) a tlAUion.?
No. 15. MARCH, 1903.
BOOKS OUR PEOPLE SHOULD READ.
We are often asked by clergymen and others, both
at home and in America, as to the most suitable Irish
books for parochial libraries and the private libraries
of people of limited means. We have given
the best advice we could. To meet what is an ap-
parent want we have come to the conclusion to com-
mence in the April number of the Monthly a list of
the books we consider every Irishman should read.
This will be made up for the most part of inexpensive
books. Might we ask the co-operation of our readers
in this good work ? Any suggestions should reach us
not later than the 15th of the month.
Many readers, especially among the Irish clergy,
in sending their second annual subscription, take the
opportunity to say a kindly word for the Monthly
and its work. A schoolmaster in the west of Ireland
writes: ?Now that it is almost obligatory to have
libraries in all our National schools, I don?t know of


any cheaper way of furnishing them than by teachers
supporting your enterprise. On the excellence of the
literature I need not dwell, as it speaks for itself.?
We thank our friend for his suggestion.
s e a n C us.
No. 6 of our Books of Songs and Recitations is now
ready. It will be seen from the following list that
its contents are of an attractive and varied character :
? Battle Eve of the Brigade,? ? Caoch the Piper,?
? Clare?s Dragoons,? ? Erin my country,? ? Erin?s
sons in England,? ? God save our native land,? ? Exile
of Erin,? ? The Irishman,? ?Is the time come,?
? Kathleen Mavourneen,? ?To Katie,? ? Little
Noreen,? ?Merry March wind,? ?Nationality,?
? Song from the backwoods,? ? Hymn to St. Patrick,?
?Songsof our land,? ?She lived beside the Anner,?
?St. Patrick?s Day,? and ?United,?
One of the pieces, ? Erin?s Sons in England,?
always brings back a pleasant memory to the present
writer, for it was written at his request by Mr.
Sullivan, to commemorate one of his visits to Liver-
pool, when he lectured on ?Irish Poetry? before a
vast assembly of his fellow-countrymen.
Mr. MacSweeny?s fine song, ? StAiuce ua ngAe-oeAl,?
has already appeared in the ceot Sine series of song
books, but many requests have reached him and our-
selves for the music of the air to which it was written
to be given along with the words of the song. Mr,
Mac Sweeny has very kindly supplied this, and we
are pleased to give the Irish words and music in the
present number, together with a very able translation
of the song into English.
Few men did more for National literature than Sir
Charles Gavan Duffy, who has recently passed from
amongst us, after a long and honoured life. His
latest service in this field was in connection with the
? New Irish Library,? six volumes of which?one a
? Life of Thomas Davis ? from his own pen?we are
able to place in the hands of our readers, as may be
seen in another page, on unusually favourable terms.

THE CATALPA:
THE STORY OF THE
RESCUE OF THE MILITARY FENIANS
COMPILED FROM THE STIRRING NARRATIVE OF
JOHN BRESLIN,
The IRISH-AMERICAN NEWSPAPERS, and OTHER SOURCES,
BY
JOHN DENYIR.
CHAPTER I.
The Military Fenians.
is a well known fact that nothing in
(j# Ifeu connec ti� n with the revolutionary associa-
IMk Ifli ti�n known as the Fenian Brotherhood
alarmed England more than the knowledge
a very considerable portion of her army
~ had been gained over to the Irish National
cause by able and indefatigable agents, wearing
V her own scarlet livery. Among these were the
six men whose escape from Freemantle, in Westeri?
Australia, on Easter Monday, 17th April, 1876, thrilled
with pleasure every true Irish heart throughout the
world. In the same degree was there consternation
in the councils of Britain ] for the whole affair showed
unexpected capacity and secrecy on the part of the
? Irish enemy.? The following narrative embodies
a sketch of the past lives of the rescued and rescuers,
together with the leading facts connected with the

ably conceived and daringly executed plan which
resulted in the restoration to freedom of the men to
whom mercy had been refused by the British Govern-
ment.
Short biographies of these soldiers of Irish freedom
are here appended?principally taken from the New
York Irish World , and other Irish-American news-
papers :
?I.?MARTIN HARRINGTON was born at Macrocm,
County Cork, in May, 1825, enlisted in the 61st regiment
British Infantry, 18th November, 1844, and left Cork for Cal-
cutta, June, 1845. He fought in the Punjaub campaign, and
in the Indian Mutiny, and received medals and clasps for his
bravery. He left India and landed at Portsmouth in October,
1860. He was arrested in Dublin on the 10th MaVch, 1866,
for desertion, and on suspicion of being connected with the
insurrectionary movement in Ireland, was tried, found guilty,
and sentenced to penal servitude for life. In 1867 he embarked
from Portland for the convict settlement of Western Australia,
and arrived at Freemantle 10th January, 1868.
?2. ?THOMAS DARRAGH was born at Bvoomhall, County
Wicklow, in January, 1834, and enlisted in the 2nd Queen's
Royal Regiment of Infantry on the 12th November, 1852.
He was sent to the Cape of Good Hope and Kafir Land, and
afterwards received a medal and two clasps for his bravery in
the Chinese War. He returned to England in May, 1860, was
arrested at the School of Musketry, at Fleetwood, on 22nd
September, 1865, was tried by court martial on 21st February,
1866, and found guilty on the evidence of the spies Warner and
Nagle, Private Connor, and Corporals Cavanagh, Grain, and
Arnott, was sentenced to be shot ?a sentence which was after-
wards commuted to imprisonment for life. He arrived in
Australia on the 10th Januaiy, 1868, in the transport ? Hugue-
mont. ?
?3.?JAMES WILSON, whose real name is McNally, wa
6orn in Newry on 6th February, 1836. He served seven years
in the Bombay Artillery, and was at various times in America,
India, and Syria. Returning to Ireland, he enlisted in the sth
Dragoon Guards about ?6O or ?6l, and became a member of the.
Fenian organization in '64. He and Martin Hogan deserted
together in November, 1865, finding the regiment too hot for
them, after embning a large proportion of the men with their
own principles. He was arrested in Dublin on 10th February,

1866, and was tried by general court-martial on 20th August.
On the evidence of Talbot, Meara, and Foley, he was, of course,
found guilty and sentenced to penal servitude lor life. Trans-
ferred to Western Australia, where he landed on 10th January,
1868. It was Wilson who suggested getting a whaler for th"
escape, and who started the project for the rescue.
?4.?MARTIN JOSEPH HOGAN was born in Limerick,
on the 11th November, 1833, apprenticed to coach painting,
and worked at his trade up to 1857, when he enlisted in the sth
Dragoon Guards. He joined the Fenian organization in 1864,
and deserted to avoid arrest at the latter end of 1865. He was
arrested in February, 1866, and tried for desertion, mutiny, and
conspiracy to raise civil war in Ireland. On the evidence ol
Talbot, Foley, and Meara, he was found guilty and sentenced
to penal servitude for life. He was sent to Australia, and his
resolute disposition more than once brought upon him the
severity of his taskmasters.
?5. ?ROBERT CRANSTON was born in Stewartstown,
County Tyrone, on the 18th March, 1842, and enlisted in the
61st British Infantry in June, 1863. He was arrested in Dublin
in April, 1866, tried by general court-martial on the 18th June,
1866, and found guilty on the evidence of Talbot, John
Abraham, John Doyle, and Michael Lacy, Sentence, penal
servitude for life. He was sent to Australia in 1868, and was
working in the Accountant?s stores when the ?Catalpa ? arrived.
?6?THOMAS HENRY HASSETT was born on the 12th
December, 1841, in Doneraile, County Cork, and was a carpenter
by trade. He joined the Phoenix organization in 1859, and
went out afterwards with the Papal Brigade to Italy, and served
through that brief campaign. He enlisted in the 24th foot in
1861, and joined the Fenian organization in 1864. It is said
he swore in himself 270 members of the regiment, and it was he
who suggested that the contemplated fight begin in Dublin by
seizing the Pigeon House, which contained 25,000 stand of arms.
When?it was considered to be in danger a guard of ninety men
vas placed on it, and of these sixty were Fenians. Hassett
suggested a plan of capture to his superiors in the organization,
but the proposal was rejected on the ground that they were not
ready for a general fight. In January, 1866, he deserted, and
marched into the Fenian rendezvous in his uniform with his
gun upon his shoulder. ? Most of the fellows who desert for
Ireland?s sake,?said he to John Devoy, ? come to you empty
handed, but here am I ready for work.? He was arrested in
Dublin, on 28th February, 1866, and tried by general court-
martial, on 12th August, 1866. On the evidence of Meara,

Fitzmaurice, Neil, and Handcut, he was found guilty and sen-
tenced to penal servitude for life. With the other prisoners he
was sent to Australia, and in 1873 he escaped from prison in
Western Australia, lived on the Irish farmers for a time, but it
being a bad season they could not give him an outfit. After
two months had passed he made a dash for the coast, stowed
himself away on an outgoing vessel, was captured by the water
police, and brought back to the convict establishment, and for
two years afterwards he was kept in irons with the chain gang.
When he escaped on the ? Catalpa ? he was engaged as a car-
penter in the prison workshop at Freemantle. ?
CHAPTER II.
The Rescuers.
�]& UNDOUBTEDLY the chief actor in the
rescue was John Breslin. The following
||l|r biographies of himself and brave com-
panions are from the Irish-American jour-
JOHN BRESLIN was born in Drogheda, and is about
0%: forty years of age. His father was a County Tyrone man.
wHI!i John received a good education, was very studious, a hard
reader, and always very pushing and energetic. He was a
Nationalist all his life, but had no connection with any organi-
zation until 1865. In the escape of Stephens he was the princi-
pal agent, being an official in Richmond prison, but was not
suspected of complicity at the time. When at length suspicion
began to rest on bim he came to the United States, and .soon
after returned to Ireland as an envoy from the Eenian Brother-
hood. He was in America at the time of the rising in ?67, but
it is his proud family boast that his five brothers went forth
from their father?s house to take part in it, bearing with them
the fervent blessing of their father and their mother, than whom
a more patriotic pair never lived. The father died in New
York while John was on his mission to Australia, and he had
but one regret in dying, and that was that he could not see his
son, of whose success he had heard at the time. John went to
Ireland a second time, and on his return settled in Boston,
where he was principally engaged in business. Cool-headed,
62

DENVIr?s PENNY IRISH LIBRARY.


courageous, cautious, and a strict disciplinarian, he always
proved himself the right man in the right place when there was
stern work to be done for Ireland. He is about 5 feet 10 inches,
splendidly built, with light brown hair and flowing beard, and
blue-grey eyes of singular clearness and brightness.
Captain THOMAS DESMOND was born in Queenstown,
County Cork, about thirty-five years ago. He has spent most
of his time in the West and California, and was living in Los
Angeles when selected to act in concert with Breslin, with whom
he sailed from San Francisco for Australia.
JOHN KING was born in Tallagh, County Dublin, is about
thirty years old, and has lived for a number of years in New
South Wales. He was chosen by the Nationalists there to pro-
ceed to Freemantle, taking with him the �7OO collected for the
rescue project.
THOMAS BRENNAN was born in Dublin, and is aged about
thirty-four. He received a good education, learned the trade
of shoemaking, and becoming identified with the Fenian Brother-
hood, proved one of its most active and energetic members.
He was engaged in the attack on Stepaside and Glencullen
Barracks, went to England soon after, worked there for a time,
and afterwards settled in America, taking up his residence in
New York.
DENIS DUGGAN was born in Dublin, learned the trade of
coachmaking, joined the organization in 1861, and was in charge
of a section of one of the largest circles in Dublin, being a man
of great activity. He worked in England, was a member of
the London Irish Volunteers, and went over to Dublin for the
fight at the end of 1865, taking a rifle in his tool chest. He
was arrested in February, 1866, and was confined successively in
Mountjoy, Belfast, and again in Mountjoy prisons. Being
released on bail, he remained in Dublin until the rising of '67,
and was in the band that captured Stepaside and Glencullen
Barracks under Patrick Lennon.
Such is a short outline of the lives of some of those
who aided in the release of their captive brethren;
but it is only, perhaps, when Emmet?s epitaph is
written by a free Ireland that the history of all the
rescuers can be given to the world.

CHAPTER III.
HOW THE ?CATALPA? GOES A WHALING, BUT FINDS HER
way to Australia.
If AMES WILSON, one of the six rescued
Prisoners, it was who wrote from Free-
mantle to friends in America, urging them
to attempt the release of himself and
companions, while the opportunity was
favourable, and before the convict establishment
f'w would be broken up.
W2 It was determined to make the attempt, and
the chief credit of putting this determination into
operation rests with John Devoy, of New York.
Among others who also aided in the furtherance of the
object were John Boyle O?Beilly (himself an escaped
Fenian convict), and Captain Hathaway, city marshal
of New Bedford. In the beginning of March, 1875, the
American barque ? Catalpa,? 202 tons, of New Bedford,
was secured, and converted into a whaler, the bettei
to conceal the real object for which she was intended.
Richardson, of New Bedford, was the shipping agent
and one-eighth owner, the other seven-eighths being
held in trust for the Irish Nationalists who were car-
rying out the affair, by James Reynolds, of New Haven,
Connecticut. George S. Anthony, an American, the
son-in-law of the agent, was captain, and it was his
first cruise in that capacity. To him was confided the
object of the expedition. Smith, the mate, also an
American, was only informed of the real nature of the
enterprise some months after the ?Catalpa? had been
to sea, but then entered into it with a will. The only
Irishman on board the ?Catalpa,? Denis Duggan,
sailed as carpenter. He, as an old soldier of Irish
freedom, of course, knew the mission on which they
were bound. Twenty-four men were shipped as a crew,
but were not informed of the real object of the voyage.

DENVIR?S PENNY IRISH LIBRARY.


On 29th April, 18 15, the ?Catalpa? sailed on a two
years? cruize. For about six months the pretence of
her being on a whaling voyage in the North Atlantic
was kept up. On the 20th October she was at
the Azores, having taken 210 barrels of sperm oil,
which were shipped to the States from Fayal, and
helped to pay expenses. Thence the ? Catalpa ? pro-
ceeded to Teneriffe, where fresh water was taken in,
after which her course was shaped for the River Platte,
which place the crew thought the object of her voyage,
but after proceeding a little way her course was
changed to the east, around the Cape of Good Hope,
past St. Paul s in the Indian Ocean, until at length
the stout barque cast anchor at Bunbury, in Australia,
there to await instructions from John Breslin, who, as
we shall see, had, already, with his companions, arrived
at the scene of operations, and was in full communica-
tion with the prisoners.
CHAPTER IV.
Breslin and Desmond arrive in Frbemantle.?They
ARE JOINED BY KING AND BRENNAN. THE FLIGHT
from Frbemantle.
*OHN BRESLIN and Captain Desmond
sailed from San Francisco on the 13th Sep-
tember, 1875, and arrived at Freemantle on
16th November. What followed is best
given in Breslin?s own graphic language :
?Rode to Perth the following day, and, finding
Freemantle the best base for operations, determined
to make it my headquarters. Engaged a room at the
Emerald Isle Hotel, Patrick Maloney, proprietor, and Desmond
went on to Perth and found immediate employment in a carriage
factory. Having learned during the following week that one of

THE CATALPA.


the Fenian ex-prisoners, named William Foley, was at large in
Freeman tie, I made use of him to convey to James Wilson
notice of my arrival, and arrange our method of commute? nation.
About the middle of December I visited the prison, or, as ??.hey
call it in the colony, ? The Establishment, ? and, in company
with two other gentlemen, was shown through the intfetW'
by the superintendent, Mr. Donan, visiting all the corridoir
both chapels, punishment cells, hospital, cook-house, work
shops and storeroom, and found it to be very secure and
well guarded. By the Ist January, 1876, I had several inter-
views with Wilson and determined the plan for escape.
? ? All the prisoners I wanted were working outside the prison,
and communication with them was comparatively easy. Not
expecting the * Catalpa ? to arrive at Bunbury before the last
week in January, and as some parties in Freemantle began to
express surprise that I remained there so long without any osten-
sible business, I determined to take a trip inland, and accord-
ingly visited Perth, Guildford, York, North am, Newcastle, and
the smaller villages on the route.?
In this way passed January and February, and up to
the sth March, when John King arrived with gold from
the organizers in New Zealand, and Australia. King
vemamod, -and passed, under the name of ?Jones,? as a
gold miner, and was supposed to have come to the
colony on the reports of gold being discovered in the
north-west. All this time it may in, -"*11 imagined that
the ? Catalpa ? was most anxiously looked for. At
length the welcome news of her arrival came :
?March 29. 1876, 6.30 a.m.? Found by the telegraph bulletin
board that the ? Catalpa? had put into Bunbury the day before,
28th March. ?As soon as the office opened, at ten o?clock a.m.,
I telegraphed Captain Anthony:?
? ?Any news from New Bedford ? When can you come to
Freemantle ??
?I received in reply in the afternoon
? ?No news from New Bedford. Shall not come to Free-
mantle ? ?
?I engaged a seat by the mail car for Bunbury, and left Free-
mantle the following morning, arriving in Bunbury at 4 o?clock
p.m., Friday, 31st. I met Captain Anthony ashore and ex-
plained to him what I purposed doing with the ship. He
expressed himself perfectly willing to do what I required of
him, but his crew were in a discontented state and attempting
to desert the ship. Four of them took a boat forcibly and

made off for the hush. Three of these were brought hack and
Sut in irons on board, and the fourth was confined in the
unbury lock-up. The part of the coast I had selected for em-
barking from was distant from Freemantle about twenty miles
south at a place named Rockingham. It lies at the head of
the sound, and a narrow passage at the end of Garden Island
leads out to sea. 1 intended the ?Catalpa? should stand well
out to sea ten or twelve miles outside Garden Island, and a
whaleboat put into Rockingham and pull out to ship,
when we could get on board, a distance of fourteen to sixteen
miles, which could easily be done under ordinary circum-
stances in four or five hours. 1 was anxious that the captain
should see the coast outside of Rockingham, and know exactly
where his ship should be, so I arranged with him to come
up with me to Freemantle by the ?Georgette,? which was due
in Bunbury with the colonial mails on Saturday, Ist April. By
this arrangement the Captain would have time to see the
coast, know the spot where I intended to embark the men,
and be back in time to put to sea and leave me free to make
the rescue on the morning of Thursday, 6th April. Saturday
evening, while waiting for the ?Georgette? to leave Freemantle,
Thomas Brennan, who left New York to join the ?Catalpa. at
Fayal turned up most unexpectedly as a passenger from
Melbourne on board the ?Georgette.? He recognised the
?Catalpa/ and came ashore to find out what he was to do.
I had already more men than I could conveniently undertake
to provide for, and again, he could not go on board the ship
at Bunbury without exciting suspicion, so I determined to
let him come on to Freemantle and then to do the best I
could for him. Sunday morning, April 2.?From the bridge
of the ?Georgette,? Captain Anthony had a good view of the
coast outside Rockingham, and noted the positions of Rottnest,
Garden Island, and other principal landmarks. Arrived in
Freemantle harbour, I found her Britannic Majesty?s gunboat
?Conflict,? carrying two guns and thirty men, schooner rigged
and fast sailing, had arrived and anchored on the previous
day. As the wind was for the most part light and variable,
and the ? Catalpa? a dull sailer unless with a full breeze, the
chance of escape from pursuit was too slim to he risked. So
the presence of the gunboat upset my plan for Thursday
morning. On the afternoon of Monday 1 learned that the
gunboat came to Freemantle on an annual visit, would remain
for eight or nine days and then proceed to Adelaide or Sydney;
also that another gunboat was expected to call at Freemantle
and take Governor Robinson to visit the # North-west. I asked
Captain Anthony to overhaul his vessel, paint her and be in
57

THE CATALPA.


no hurry to get his wood and water on board, as we must
wait until the gunboat sailed. I also explained to him the
details of my plan, and drove him out to Rockingham, that
he might see and know the spot I. intended to embark from.
The road from Freemantle to Rockingham, for the first ten
miles, is good for Western Australia. From the Ten-Mile
Well to Rockingham Hotel, about six miles, heavy and cut
up with sand patches, from the hotel to the beach, about
four miles, a mere track through the sand and bush. We
made the distance without stopping, in two hours and twentj
minutes.?
By an ingenious preconcerted arrangement, telegrams
so worded as to deceive all but themselves, passed
between John Breslin and Captain Anthony, so that
each was well posted as to what was going on at
Rockingham and Freemantle respectively. The gun-
boat having left Freemantle, it was determined to fix the
escape for Saturday, 15th April. Preparations were
made. The six men were kept ready through Wilson,
with whom Breslin had an interview, and horses and
wagons were engaged to carry off the prisoners, when
there had to be a postponement, consequent on a
message from Captain Anthony, saying it had blown
heavily, and the ship had dragged both anchors.
On the Saturday, however, came another message, from
the Captain, by which Breslin that the attempt
might be made on the Monday. He tells us :
? I then engaged the same horses for Sunday and Monday,
and sent King to Perth, on a horse I bought some months
before, to give Desmond notice to get his team and come to
Freemantle on Sunday evening. Saturday afternoon I walked
';o the jetty, and when I was sure Wilson saw me, I gave him
the signal which meant, ?We start to-morrow morning. * The
following morning being Sunday, I saw he was somewhat
puzzled ; so keeping him in sight I walked leisurely across to
where the prisoners were working and sufficiently near to say?
?Monday morning/ without being observed by the warder or
any of the other prisoners.
? Easter Sunday Desmond came to Freemantle about two
o?clock p.m., with a very poor-looking pair of horses, the
former pair having been engaged to go to York when he returned
them on Saturday. He offered the ostler �2 to get him a good

pair, but they were all engaged. 1 then went to get the horse�
1 had engaged, and found that Albert, the owner, had given
the best horse of the pair to Mr. Stone, the superintendent of
water police, to go to Perth with, his brother-in-law, the sheriff,
having been thrown from his horse in Perth, and lying in a
critical condition. Albert also informed me that I could not
have the horses I had engaged on Monday morning, that his
clerk had done wrong in hiring them to me, as he himself had
promised them to Mr. Thompson a week before to go to th
Perth Regatta on Easter Monday.
?Monday, 17th April.?At half-past five a.m., I had the
/Stler called and the valises put in the trap, waked up King and
Desmond?Brennan was already awake and dressed?and left
for Rockingham at six a.m. At seven o?clock a.m. I went to
Albert?s stables and found the pair of horses I wanted and a
nice light four-wheel trap already harnessed up and waiting. I
told the ostler to let them stand for about twenty minutes, and
then went and told Desmond to get his horses harnessed up
and be ready to leave at half-past seven a.m. I had arranged
with Desmond for him to leave Freemantle by a side street,
which, after a few turns, took him on to the Rockingham-road,
whilst I drove up High-street, as if going to Perth, turning
sharp round by the prison and on to the same road. King,
being well mounted, was to remain after we started for a reason-
able time, and then to follow and let us know if the alarm was
given. At half-past seven a.m. I drove slowly up the principal
street, and, turning to the right, walked my horses by the
warders? quarters and pensioners? barracks. The men were
beginning to assemble for parade. I had arranged with our
men that I would have the traps in position on the road at a
quarter to eight, and would remain so, the nearest being within
five minutes? run of the prison, until nine o?clock a.m. Being
ahead of my time I drove slowly along the Rockingham-road,
and Desmond, coming up shortly after, drove by me. Coming
to a shaded part of the road \re halted, and having divided the
hats and coats, three of each to each trap, I commenced to
drive back to Freemantle, Desmond following; time, five
minutes to eight. A few moments after I saw three men in the
prison dress wheel round and inarch down the Rockingham-
road. Driving up to them I found the men were Wilson,
Cranston, and Harrington. I directed them to pass on, get into
the trap with Desmond, and drive away. Desmond wheeled
his horses around, and they were only seated and ready to start
when the other three came in sight, and on driving up to them
I found one man carrying a spade and another a large tin kero-
sene can. As soon as 1 came near enough to be recognized, he

who carried the spade flung it from him into the bush, and the
holder of the kerosene can bestowed a strong kick upon it in
good football fashion. I found the men were Darragh, Hogan,
and Hassett. I now had all the men I wanted and left glad.
My horses got restive and refused to wheel around. Darragh
jaught one by the head but he jibed and kicked so I was afraid
he would break the harness. I told Darragh to let him go, and
whipping both of them up smartly, they started fairly together,
and when I got them on a wider part of the road they wheeled
around nicely. I now drove back and took up my men. Des-
mond was already well out of sight, and King shortly after
rode up and told me all was quiet when he left.
?With regard to the method or plan of communciation
between the prisoners themselves it may be well to state that
their good conduct and length of imprisonment had entitled them
to the rank of constables, which enabled them to communicate
with each other with greater ease and freedom than the other
prisoners. Wilson and Harrington worked in the same party
at the construction of harbour works in Freemantle. Hogan
was a painter by trade, and on the morning of the escape was
employed painting the house of Mr. Fauntleroy, outside the
prison wall. Cranston was employed in the stores and as mes-
senger occasionally. Darragh was clerk and attendant to the
Church of England chaplain, and enjoyed considerable facilities
for communication with the other prisoners, and on the morning
of the escape took Hassett with him to plant potatoes in the
garden of Mr. Broomhole, the clerk of works for the convict
department. After breakfast on the morning of the 17th April
all the political prisoners were engaged outside the prison wall.
Cranston passed out as if going on a message, and having over-
taken the warder, who was marching the working party in
which Wilson and Harrington worked, showed him a key, and
told him that he had been sent to take Wilson and Harrington
to move some furniture in the Governor?s house, which was the
nearest point to where they expected to meet me. The warder
told Wilson and Harrington to go with Cranston and they
marched off. Darragh took Hassett, as if going to work, in
the same direction, and was joined by Hogan, who made an
excuse for temporary absence to the warder who had charge oi
him. Both parties met at the Rockingham-road.
?I now drove on, letting King fall behind, and in half an
hour was close behind Desmond. We held on without accident
or incident until we reached the Rockingham Hotel, when
Somers, the proprietor, who knew me called out to know what
time was the ?Georgette? expected to be at the timber jetty. I
told him the ?Georgette was at the jetty at Freemantle when I

left, but I did not know when she would be at Rockingham.
At half-past ten a.m. we made the beach and got aboard the
whale boat. The men had been instructed to stow themselves
in the smallest possible space, so as not to interfere with the
men at the oars, and in a few moments all was ready, and the
word was given, * shove off, men ; shove off.? ?
We shall see in the next chapter how affairs went
on, meanwhile, at Freemantle.
CHAPTER V.
The Pursuit.
T was between nine and ten o?clock on the
p same morning that Hogan, who had been
p painting at the Comptroller?s residence, was
I** missed from his work, and could not be found,
p Suspicion was roused, and soon the officials
? found, to their consternation, that six Fenian
prisoners had escaped! At first it was
thought that the men had made for the bush, and the
police and native trackers sought them in that direc-
tion. But as information came in of the carriage?
having been seen driving towards Rockingham, the
pursuit was turned towards that quarter. In an houi
and a half after leaving Freemantle the mounted
police arrived in hot haste at Rockingham, only to
find that the fugitives had slipped from their grasp,
and were on the open sea. The horses and carriages
used by the escaped prisoners and their friends were
found where they had been left, with the exception of
the saddle horse, which had been taken by a Rocking-
ham man named Bell, who rode the animal into Free-
mantle. He arrived there at half-past twelve, and gave
a detailed statement of how he had seen the party
embarking in the whaler?s boat. The authorities
determined to telegraph to Albany (King George?s
61

Sound) for the assistance of the gunboat ? Conflict,?
then at that place. To their discomfiture it was
found that the wily Fenians had provided for
such a contingency by cutting the telegraph wires
between Perth and Albany on the previous night.
At half-past one in the afternoon the water police
were sent off in the direction it was thought most
likely the whaler?s boat and the whaler herself might
be fallen in with. Meanwhile, the place where the
telegraph wires had been cut was being traced out,
and at length found and repaired. It was a quarter to
three before the Governor?s message reached Albany.
It was too late ?the ? Conflict? had gone ! Baffled in
this direction the authorities then engaged the ? Geor-
gette? to go in pursuit, the steamer?s agent only allow-
ing her to go on condition of the owners being indem-
nified against any risk. She was fully equipped and
armed for any possible encounter, and placed in com-
mand of Stone, the superintendent of the water police.
She had on board, in addition to her usual crew,
eight policemen and eighteen pensioners under Major
Finnerty, all armed. It was nine o?clock that evening
before the ?Georgette? steamed away from the jetty.
There was a scene of great excitement on her departure,
the streets of Freemantle being crowded with people
discussing the probable issue of the affair.
In the meantime, the police boat, which had started
early in the afternoon, coasted along shore until half
pastseven in the evening, when she reached Murray Head.
She then steered out to sea, keeping a good look-out
all night. She had to return to Murray Head, which
she regained at half-past seven next morning, without
having seen anything of the whaler or her boat,
although, while coasting along on the previous aftep
noon she had received information from a fishing boat
of having seen the whaler?s boat off Garden Island.
After an hour or two the police boat acain started off,

making short tacks to the southward, until it was
getting towards noon, when, off Cape Bonvard, she
sighted a vessel in the west. While making for this
ship the water-police fell in with the ?Georgette, and
learned that the sail in sight was the ? Catalpa.
The ?Georgette,? which had also been out at sea all
night, had sighted the ?Catalpa? at eight o?clock
that morning standing south under light canvas. ihe
barque stood off, but the wind being light the ? Geor-
gette ? was able by about ten o?clock to steam along-
side, when the vessel proved to be the ? Catalpa, of
New Bedford, bearing the American flag. The pursuing
force was got under arms. A demand was made to be
allowed to board and search the barque, but this the
mate, who appeared to be in command, refused. As it was
found that there was a short supply of coal on board
the ? Georgette ? it was then determined to return to
Freemantle, which the steamer was doing when she
met the police boat. Leaving the water police to
watch for the whaler?s boat, which had evidently not
yet rejoined the ship, the ?Georgette? proceeded on
her homeward course, and arrived back at Freemantle '
at four o?clock that (Tuesday) afternoon. Up to this
point neither the steamer nor police boat had caught
sight of the whaler?s boat, whereas, as we shall see by
John Breslin?s narrative in the following chapter, his
party had actually seen the ? Georgette ? overhauling
the ? Catalpa,? and had yet themselves continued to
remain unnoticed.
Very many of the people of Freemantle were not
sorry to see the ? Georgette ? returning unsuccessful.
The Government officials, however, were determined
to make another effort to recapture the prisoners.
Accordingly the steamer was now fully coaled and
provisioned for a cruize of several days, if necessary.
The pensioners and police were again put aboard, fully
armed, and a twelve-pounder field piece fixed in the
63
THE CATALPA.


gangway. At eleven o?clock the same night the
? Georgette ? steamed out again, and early on the
Wednesday morning she -was outside of Rottnest. At
daylight she sighted a ship bearing S.S.E. under full
sail. The steamer then hoisted the British pennant,
and all on board were put under arms. As had been
expected the vessel again proved to be the ? Catalpa.?
CHAPTER VI.
Under the Stars and Stripes.
)iW/w HAT followed will be found in the
course of John Breslin?s narrative, which
is here resumed from the point where
he and his party were left pulling
away from Rockingham in the whale
fairly afloat the word was ? Out oars and pull
lives ! ? ? Pull as if you were pulling after a
. The boat?s crew were somewhat disconcerted
and scared at the sudden appearance of so many strangers armed
with rifles and revolvers, and pulled badly at first, but the voice
of the steersman rallied them, aud the cries, ?Come down,
Mopsa; ? ? Come down, you big Lf ,iis; ? ? Pull, Toby, pull; ???
?Give them stroke, Mr. Silvee;? ?What do you say, men;?
? Come down altogether; ? ?Pull away, my men, pull away,?
soon warmed them to their work, and they fell into stroke and
pulled well. When about two miles off shore we saw the
mounted police ride up to the spot where we had embarked, and
then slowly drive the horses and wagons we had used up the
beach towards the Rockingham jetty.
At half-past twelve we were clear of the reefs seaward of
Garden Island, and, hoisting the boat?s sails stood away to
the south-east in search of the ship ; held on this course until
four o?clock p.m., when, there being no sign of the ship, we
took in sail and rowed to the westward ; about half-past five
p.m., Toby raised the ship about fifteen miles ahead of us,
and the men bent to their oars in order to get as near to her as
possible before dark; at half-nast six we had gained on the ship,

and could see her topsails quite plain from the crests of the
waves ; made sail on the boat. At this time the weather had
become gloomy with rain squalls, and we were all pretty
thoroughly soaked. The boat made good headway under sail,
and we were rapidly overhauling the ship, carrying all sail and
the whole boat?s crew, sixteen men in all, perched on the
weather gunwale, with the water rushing in from time to time
on the lee side, when, about seven o?clock, a squall struck us,
carrving away the mast, which broke short off at the thwart,
and' by the time we had the mast and sail stowed away, the
ship had disappeared in the increasing darkness. We pulled
in the direction of the ship until about ten o?clock in the hope
of being able to see her lights, but without success. We then
hoisted the jib on an oar, and steered the course we supposed the
vessel had gone. There was an ugly sea running, and the
weather threatening to become more severe. However, towards
morning, it moderated considerably. At quarter to seven a.m,
we raised the ship and we steered for her. She was coming
towards us, and we could see her lower sails, when, on looking
behind I saw the smoke of a steamer, and soon after was able
to make out the ?Georgette? steaming out from Freemantle, with
all sails set. It was her regular day for sailing to Albany, with and
for the Colonial mails, and for a short time we were in doubt'
whether she was in pursuit or going on her regular trip. A
little further observation convinced me that she was too far out
of her regular course to be going to Albany, and a slight altera-
tion in her steering decided the question, showing us that she
was making for the ?Catalpa,? which she must have seen
before we did. We now plied oar and sail to reach the ship,
but it soon became apparent that the ? Georgette ? was gaining
too fast on us, and would fetch the ship much sooner than we
could. She was also coming close enough to make us out, under
sail, so we determined to take down the sail and lie to, taking
the chance of her passing by without seeing us. The
? Georgette ? passed without having seen our boat, steering
iirectfor the ?Catalpa,? now distant about five miles. As
soon as she had passed far enough ahead we pulled after in hei
wake, judging it to be the safest position we could occupy if
she was in search of us, and also bringing us nearer to the ship.
Situated thus, we saw the ?Georgette? run alongside the
? Catalpa, ? and, after remaining alongside about ten minutes,
steam slowly away, the ship holding on her course and the
?Georgette? steaming in the same direction, but gradually
sheering off and going more in shore. It was now about half-past
eight a.m., and we made all the sail we could, and put out
every oaf and paddle to overtake the ship. The ship held on

her course on the wind, heading south-south-east, and both the
our P bnaf th 4i Ge �rgette ? kept increasing their distance from
our boat. About half-past eleven a.m., watching the steamei
and the ship alternately, the ship being about twelve and the
steamei about eight miles distant, I noticed the steamer heading
too close in shore to be on her course for Bunbury, where we
thought she was bound after parting with the ?Catalna.?
Observing her movements more closely we shortly afterwards
saw the steamer turn right around, and, heading for Freemantle
come under steam and sail along the coast, evidently in search

Oataipa was sailing, although she was fast receding from our
vimy and some of our men began to call her the ??phantom
ship, as the more we strove to approach her the farther off
she appeared to sail. The ? Georgette ? now began to get
angerously close to our boat, and we took down our temporary
mast and sail, but continued to work our oars and paddles. The
slSff r StIU C � ntinucd t0 come cl �ser, and we had but
slight hopes of escaping unseen. We lay as low as possible in
the boat and ceased rowing for a short time. About half-past
twelve p.m. the Georgette passed across our wake so close
that we could distinguish men on her deck, and a look-out man
at her mast-head. lor a time I expected to see her turn and
bear right down on us, but she passed on, and as soon as we
sunk her hull we made sail again and stood after the ? Catalna ?
We now commenced to gradually gain upon the ship, which

standing on her course inside of two minutes. The police-boat

and kissed my hand to the gentlemen who had lost the race.
Their boat dropped astern and their officer shouted, ? Good
by, Captain, good by. ?
t Twenty-eight hours in an open boat, with a liberal allow-
ance of rain and sea water, cramped for want of room and
cheered with a glorious uncertainty as to whether we should
gain freedom or the chain-gang; a suit of dry clothes, a glass
of New England rum and a mug of hot coffee were just the
things to put ? where they would do the most good, ? and
were put accordingly. After supper we walked about the
deck and enjoyed what we supposed to be a last look at the
shores of Western Australia, the ship working to windward
with a light breeze in the direction of Cape Naturaliste.
All hands except the watch on deck retired for the night
about nine o?clock p.m. and slept soundly. At five a.m. I
came on deck and found the ship?s course had been altered
and we were working to windward on a light breeze, steering
north-north-west, which would bring us past Freemantle
again outside Rottnest Island. About half-past five o clock
the man on the lookout reported a sail on the lee bow. 1
thought when I first saw her she was a small coasting vessel,
but Mr. Smith quickly pronounced her to be the ?Georgette?
As the daylight advanced we saw that he was right; it was
the steamer 4 ?Georgette? standing across our course, and
evidently in search of us. About six a.m. we passed the
? Georgette,? she lying about half a mile to windward of us,
with a man-of-war ship and vice-admiral?s flag flying. We set
the Stars and Stripes as we passed and held on oar course. The
? Georgette? turned and followed us still keeping to windward.
The breeze freshened about seven o?clock and the ?Catalpa? began
to drop the ?Georgette? astern. They then fired up and made
all sail on the ?Georgette,? and, the breeze dying away, they
began to overhaul us very fast. At a quarter to eight o?clock
the ?Georgette? was so near that I could see she had guns, an
artillery force and the water police on board; a whaleboa'
oelonging to the water police hung at her davits, to be used
in boarding, and they seemed quite eager and determined to
capture us. The men of our party were all assembled in the
cabin with their rifles and revolvers ready. Of the watch not
a man visible from the ? ?Georgette? but the lookout and the man
at the wheel. I now stepped down into the cabin and ex-
plained to the men the position in which we stood. I told
them that if the officials on board the ?Georgette? were deter-

mined to fight for their recapture they would most probably
succeed, as they had the advantage of us in every way more
men, better armed, cannon, and a steamer with which they
could sail round and round us. I also explained to them that,
whilst those of our party who had not been in prison could
only suffer imprisonment, the men who had been imprisoned
could be hanged in case any life was lost by their resistance.
1 then said it was simply a matter of dying now or waiting to
die in prison, and gave them the option of lighting or surren-
dering if the officials in the ? Georgette? fired into or
boarded us.
Their answer was ?We?ll do whatever you say.? I then
said, 111 hold out to the last, ? and went on deck again. The
? Georgette ? was now very close on the weather side, with a
company of artillery on board, a field piece pointed at our ship,
and the gunners at their quarters. At eight o?clock a.m. the
Georgette steamed ahead and fired a round shot across our
bows. Captain Anthony then put a question to me, to which I
replied ? Hold on, and dont take any notice of the shot yet.?
After the lapse of about three minutes, the artillery-men
having got through all the regulation motions of spunging out,
reloading and pointing their field piece, and the steamer and the
Oatalpa sailing side by side within easy speaking distance, I
said, Now ask him what does he want.?
Captain Anthony stepped on to the weather rail and raised
his speaking trumpet. As he did so the ?Georgette ? hailed
Barque ahoy!? and the answer went back ?What do you
want ? ? ? Heave to ! ? came back from the ? Georgette.? ?He
says heave to.? ?Ask him what for.? ? What for ?? shouted
our captain through his trumpet. No reply, and the question
is repeated still louder.
What am I to heave to for?? After quite a pause the
Georgette? hailed, ?Have you any convict prisoners on
board? Answer??No prisoners here; no prisoners that I
know of.? The ?Georgette? then hailed, ?I telegraphed to
your government; dont yob. know that you are amenable to
British law in this colouy ? You have six convict prisoners on
board. I see some of them on deck now.? I then said to the
captain, ? This fellow is lying and trying to bluff us ; he cannot
send a message before Saturday next.? The ? Georgette ? then
hailed, ? ? I give you fifteen minutes to consider and you must
take the consequences ; I have the means to do it, and if you
dont heave to I?ll blow the masts out of you.? ?Tell him that?s
the American flag; you are on the high seas ;if he fires on the
ship he fires on the American flag. ? The captain then shouted
pointing to his flag, ?That?s the American flag; I am on the

nigh seas ; my flag protects me ; if you fire on this ship you fire
on the American flag. 99
The threat to fire on the flag highly incensed the first mate,
Mr. Smith. He damned the scoundrel in good, strong, nautical
phrase, and he exclaimed ? Damn him ; let him sink us ; we?ll
go down with the ship. I?ll never start sheet or tack for him.?
Mr. Smith now asked me, ?What will you do if he tries to
board us ? ? I replied, ?Sink his boat when it comes along-
side ; you have a couple of heavy grindstones, let us have them
handy to heave over the side. ,, The captain now reminded Mr.
Smith of some short heavy logs of timber which were in the
hold, and bade him order the crew to put them on deck. These
logs were quickly passed on deck and laid on the main hatch
ready for use. The lookout reported a sail on the lee bow, and
we saw a small sail between us and Rottnest Island. This
called the captain?s particular attention to the position of our
ship, and judging that we were coming too close in to the land,
and liable to run into British waters, he wore ship and stood on
the other tack, bearing down close on the ? Georgette/' which
backed out of our way. This movement seemed to disconcert
the parties on board the ?Georgette." Our fifteen minutes?
grace and several other minutes had expired, and as the
?Georgette? steamed slowly across our stern, I looked fora
�aking shot among our masts. She did not fire, and as she
ringed alongside again I knew that the game of bluff was
flayed out. The party on board the ? Georgette," with their
battery of glasses and their spokesman whom I believed to be
Colonel Harvest, called out, ?Wont you surrender to our
government ?? No reply ; and again he called out, ? I see three
of those men on board now.? Our captain replied, ?You are
mistaken, sir ; the men you see are my ship?s crew.? Our men
were all in the cabin from the time the ?Georgette? first bore
down on us, with strict orders not to come on deck until I called
them. After about ten minutes? more sailing, side by side, the
?Georgette? hailed ? Can I come on board ?? To this Captain
Anthony replied, ?No, sir ; I?m bound for sea and can?t stop.??
The ? Georgette? still kept us company, as if loth to part, until
half-past nine a. m., when she slowly swung off, and without
having the courtesy to bid us bon voyage , steamed back to Free-
mantle. The remaining incidents of the voyage are written in
the log of the good ship ? Catalpa."

The arrival of the ? Catalpa 99 in America was eagerly
and anxiously looked forward to by Irishmen. During
the four months that followed nothing was heard of

her, until at length she cast anchor in New York Bay,
at one o?clock on the mommy; of Saturday, 18th
August.
At daybreak, John Breslin proceeded to O?Donovan
Rossa?s hotel, where the first man he met was William
Foley (since dead), whose term of imprisonment in
Western Australia had expired just about the time the
rescue plan was approaching its culmination.
The news of the arrival spread like wildfire, and a
party went aboard the ? Catalpa ? to give the men a
cordial greeting, and to see to their comforts after so
long a voyage. They were conveyed to O?Donovan
Rossa?s hotel, which, on their arrival and during the
whole of their stay there, was besieged by immense
numbers of warm-hearted Irish-Americans, anxious to
give them an enthusiastic welcome.
But it was not in America alone but everywhere
throughout the world that Irishmen rejoiced at the
news of their safe arrival, and applauded the gallant
deed that had given the military Fenians their freedom.
In America, however, they were looked upon as being
peculiarly the guests of the Irishmen of the great
Western Republic, who not satisfied with rejoicing
at their escape and giving them a hearty welcome,
raised a handsome fund for the rescued men, to give
them a new start in the life to which they had beeu
restored.

THE HEALTH OF THE GAEL.
God bless the true men and women of our land,
And God rest her heroes low lying,
Who in darkest days, with courage proud and grand,
bull nobly kept her green flag flying.
Fill high the bumper with wine or good ale I
And drink to the brave of our Sireland.
Here?s to our kindred, the seed of Clanna Gael,
And slainte slainte feear to old Ireland I
Long live and flourish each branch of Clanna Gael,
Hy bhannon, or Boyne, or wherever,
The stock spreads its root in the soil of Innisfail,
May it brave storm and tempest forever.
Fill high the bumper, etc.
to the exiles in strange lands o?er the sea,
Tis my sorrow they?re far from old Erin;
kind heaven guard them our constant prayer shall be,
Wherever round the wide world they?re farin?.
Fill high the bumper, etc.
Pledge now the young blood, the hope of Innisfail,
Up from the green vale and heather;
Fill up the gold cup, the jorum of the Gael,
And let?s drink to our kin altogether.
Fill high the bumper etc.

IN this village is carried on the manufacture of
Soap from plant ashes in the way it was made
ioo years ago. When soda began to be made from
salt, by treating it with vitriol, the manufacturers of
M?Clinton?s Soap continued to make it in the old way.
Prof. Kirk, of Edinburgh, says of it in his Papers
on Health:?
11 There is somethin*: in the composition of this Soap which
makes it astonishingly curative and most agreeable on the
skin. Lather made from it, instead of drying and so far
burning the skin of those using it, has the most soothing and
delightful effect-?
We will send 3 tablets of Toilet Soap, a cake of
exquisite Shaving Soap, or a tablet of Tooth Soap
(which is quite free from the nauseous taste of caustic
soda), to anyone who sends us Is.
With these we send FREE a pretty enamelled tin
Match-holder, representing a cottage fire-side in this
Irish Village
Wc guarantee this Soap to prevent chapped hands
*nd will return the money to any user of it who suffers
from them.
