44 There standeth One among
you whom ye know not.”


Tbe A\ysterious
Stranger
HE scorching
sun blazed on
the Eastern
World. Hot
sand burnt brown sandalled
feet. Palm trees waved feathery
leaves. Loaded camels made
their way slowly over the
glistening desert. In Nature
there was nothing to indicate
anything unusual days
dawned and slipped away
behind the flaming west';
nights came clear and still,


lit with millions of stars —just
as they had always done.
But the people of the East
were deeply stirred. Great
crowds moved eagerly towards
the glittering desert ; whole
villages were forsaken, and
o
poured their white-robed in-
habitants into the wilderness,
where a Voice thundered his
uncompromising message.
The people felt suddenly
weighted with their sins.
Covetousness weighted, mean-
ness weighted, anger, malice,
envy, spite, evil-speaking,
vanity, frivolity, every sin
weighted and threatened to
crush them, as they listened
to that wonderful Voice.


They became anxious,afraid;
for what would be the result
of those awful sins ?
They returned to their daily
tasks in distress.
THE R S were made
angry. How dared
that Voice thunder
at them ? Were they
not already religious ?
Nr*
Did they not fast,
observe all the ordinances
laid down by their fathers ?
Did they not pray much ?
Were not all their actions
moral and strictly legal ? Did
not the common people look
up to them ? Were they
not teachers and preachers ?
Why should that Voice speak
to them—what need had they
of anything else ?


But the masses felt burdened
by their sins. The Voice
made them strangely uneasy
and sad. Yet he also aroused
a feeling ol expectancy among
them. He spoke of Someone
else Who should come, had
come, to take away their sins.
They were looking for that
Someone else.
T this time a Mys-
■ terious Stranger
appeared in their
midst. He walked up
and down their streets.
He healed the sick;
spoke words of comfort to the
sorrowing ; wept with the
weeping ; He even raised their
dead. He took little children
into His arms and loved them.
He helped those in difficulties.


He sat down on sea-shore, and
hill-top, and taught the people
about Heavenly things. He
fed thousands with a few loaves,
afraid to let them return home
hungry, lest they fainted by the
way. He showed love and
pity to all. He told them
strange things about Himself.
The people felt instinctively
drawn to Him ; His mysterious
personality fascinated them ;
His words impressed them ;
His eyes held them.
HO was this Mysteri-
ous' Stranger with
the searching yet tender eyes,
humble mien, yet dominant
personality ?
Who was He ?
They knew Him not.
He stood amongst them,


walked amongst them, spoke
to them, looked at them, taught
them, fed them, healed them,
loved them. But they knew
Him not. And after three
years of faithful, untiring, self-
forgetful ministry among them
—they crucified Him.
The Voice had said :
“There standeth One among
you, whom ye know not.”
It was true then.
Is it not true now’ ?
Is not this Mysterious
Stranger still standing among
us —unrecognised ?
He moves about our busy
streets. He walks about our


brilliant shops, our factories
our offices. He stands outside
our luxurious homes. We fly
past Him in our motors. We
sail by Him in our magnificent
ships. We rush away from
Him to our pleasures, our
excitements, our frivolities.
We push Him aside as we
speed into all kinds of sin.
He is ever moving in our
midst ; ever looking at us ;
always trying to gain our
attention.
But —we pass Him by.
We meet Him in our
churches. He walks up and
down the aisles. He bends
silently over our pews.
But we see Him not.
He stands watching and
waiting for a faint gleam of
O O
recognition ; but —in vain.


. sing to Him. We
listen to sermons
about Him. We are there
to worship Him. We love
the beautiful service, the
music, the rich tones of the
organ, the sweet chanting of
the white-surpliced choir boys.
We gaze in awe at the stained-
glass windows; we listen in
tears to the Passion of His
Cross. We bow our heads, we
bend our knees. We confess
creeds, our belie! in Him. We
vow to serve Him. We own
Him as our Judge ; but—
wonder of wonders—Himself
we pass by!
We push Him aside in the
pews ; we jostle against Him
in the aisles, unnoticed, un-
recognised.


We celebrate His birthday.
We love Christmas with its
summer joys, its laughter and
sunshine, the happy children’s
voices, the festive air, the joy-
ous greetings, the presents, the
glad surprises, the holidays,
the gay family gatherings—
we love all that Christmas
brings! We keep His birth-
day in church, in our homes,
among our friends. We give
donations to the poor, to the
hospitals. We make everyone
happy except Him, Whose
birthday it is. We have shut
Him out.
Why have we shut Him out?
As was the case with the
people of old, we do not know
Him.


I are so busy. Our
lives are already full.
We have so many plans ; so
many engagements claim our
attention. We have no time
to recognize Him, and—let
me say it softly, in tones of
deepest shame—we do not
want to know Him. Suppose
we knew Him, and He
could speak to us, might He
not interfere too much with
our lives ? Might we not hear
Him say, as He said of old,
“ Go and sin no more ? ”
Might we not also hear
Him say, “Love not the world,
neither the things that are in
the world. If any man love
the world, the love of the
Father is not in Him.”
We are having such a good
time ; is it not a pity to disturb


it ? Life is all right as it is ;
surely, as long as we pay our
debts, go to church, and have
all the beautiful feelings about
the service, the organ, the
stained-glass windows, the
cross, the chanting choir boys ;
if we bow our heads and bend
our knees, if we recite creeds,
if we pay pew-rents, if we
keep holy-days, give to the
poor; surely, all this is enough ?
And yet, that Figure halts
so yearningly by our side, as if
He wanted more, as if He had
so much to say to us.
■toasar
But we sweep past Him.
Why should we stop ? Life
is too full of delightful, intoxi-
cating folly. We do not know
this Stranger. Why should we


trouble about Him? We have
our friends ; we do not need
Him. The far-off god we
think of and worship in church
suits us far better. He makes
no awkward claims upon us ;
He is easily pacified, easily
hood-winked ; He can be molli-
fied by a big cheque. Oh,
yes, this god is more to our
taste ! But the halting Stran-
ger with the pure brow and
searching eyes: if we knew
Him, what demands might He
not make ? What censure
would He not pronounce on
our lives, our pleasures, our
frivolities, the way we spend
our days, the words we utter,
the thoughts we think, the
deeds we do. We are afraid.
We turn from that burning
gaze, those pure lips, which
might say all we fear to hear.


OMETIMES we
I think of Eternity.
We shudder for a
moment, it is so un-
known, so strange.
A vague longing to
know someone who
knew, who had been there,
creeps into our hearts. If
only we knew ! If only when
we come to cross the narrow
border-line some familiar friend
could go with us, take us by
the hand and lead us safely
beyond the cold regions of
death !
The Mysterious Stranger
suddenly stands beside us.
“ I have come from Eternity,
I can tell you about it, I can
lead you securely through the
dark valley of death,” He
whispers.
But we do not heed Him.


We think of the church ; the
pictures of the angels there,
the sermons we have heard
about Heaven, the lovely harp-
music, the golden city, the
merciful God who is so kind,
so gentle —oh yes, it must be
all right; are we not members
of His visible Church ? Have
we not sung hymns of Heaven
and all its radiant splendour !
Yes, yes, there is nothing to
fear ;it will be all right. We
need not trouble now.
Then Death comes into our
home. Some loved one is
suddenly snatched from us.
We see life slowly ebb away —
light fade from tired, feverish
eyes. Only a sigh —and she


has passed into the Great Un-
known. We look at the empty
casket which held the soul we
loved. All becomes dark.
We shudder. We tremble.
Loneliness lays cold hands
upon us. All light, all joy
has gone.
People are moving about us,
voices are talking, but none
have power to come near us.
They are far away and remote.
. They are in the sunshine. We
are in the impenetrable shadow
of sorrow.
We call to them. We are
desperate. We want to hear
words of love, of comfort. But
our call falls unheeded into the
shrouded darkness. We realise
our cruel isolation. Sorrow
has set us apart, removed us
far from those who live iiTthe
sunshine. We sink into des-


pair. We can weep no more.
All our tears have gone. We
lie prostrate in the silent
darkness.
HEN we hear a foot-
step a footstep we
have heard before. It had
often halted at our side, but
it was sunshine then, and
we did not heed. Now we
are glad to hear any foot-
step ; it is a relief to know
someone can reach us in the
midnight blackness.
It is the Mysterious Stran-
ger. A dim light filters
through the gloom. We see
Him standing before us with
outstretched hands, and we
suddenly discover they are
scarred.
We look at Him in surprise.


“It was for you,” He
whispers.
His snowy brow is scarred
too —we have time to notice
Him now.
“ For you,” He murmurs
ag-ain.
O
Suddenly our eyes meet the
love-blaze in His.
We tremble, but not with
fear. What makes His eyes
burn like this, we wonder
quiveringly.
“Love for you,” He breathes.
NEW light bursts
L through the dark-
ness. A strange emo-
tion floods the soul,
we are loved the
crowning joy of the
universe is ours! Love
is mighty, love has power, it
elates, it thrills, it exalts, it


completes, it uplifts and pours
sunshine into every crevice of
our being!
But the love of this Stranger
is different to any we have ever
felt before. It burns more, it
stirs deeper depths, it lifts
higher, beyond all sorrow,
loneliness, and darkness.
Oh, why had we ignored
Him all those years? What
had we not missed ? What
might not have been ours ?
Why did we not listen before ?
Why did we not know Him ?
But who was He ? We raise
our eyes questioningly to
Him.
Suddenly a blinding light
shines round the Stranger.
His form becomes dazzlingly


white, His face glistens with
the might of the sun, His eyes
burn with the glory of a million
stars, and His voice, though
sweet as the fragrance of
flowers, vibrates with majesty
and power.
“ I am the God of the
Universe,” He says, “the God
you profess to worship and
serve, the God you sang to,
about whom you heard ser-
mons, the God whose birthday
you kept, the God you have
shunned and slighted all the
days of your life. You promised
to keep My commandments ;
you have only obeyed your
own desires. You promised
to love Me; you have only
loved yourself, your friends,
your pleasures, your sins. You


pretended to worship Me ; you
only bowed down to a person-
less god of your own fancy.
You thought you were serving
Me in church ; you were only
gratifying your own cravings
for sensuous beauty. You
observed My Birthday, but Me,
you shut out. You shut Me
out of your mind, your heart,
your life, your words, your
thoughts, your deeds. I came
to you a thousand times, but
you heeded Me not. I tried
to arrest your attention, to
speak to you, and
show you your
false, worldly life ;
to turn you from
folly, to make you
at last fulfil some
of your empty,
broken vows. But,
all was in vain.


“ Unless sorrow had cast
you into its abyss of darkness,
where everyone and everything
else was shut out; unless your
proud, selfish heart had been
broken, you would never have
let Me speak to you, and I
should have had to say to you,
on the day when you stood
before the Great White Throne:
“ I never knew you ; depart
from Me. But now,” He
added, His tones trembling
with tenderest passion, “ you
have listened to My voice
at last; you have seen the
mockery of your past service,
your sensuous worship, your
empty, worldly life, and,” He
came closer, arms ready to
enfold, “ will you fulfil those
vows now? Will you love Me
as you promised ? Will you


lead the pure, holy life,
I would have you live ?
Will you forsake all in p)J 'M
which I have no part?” "mi U
His face bent lower, His
eyes shone with burning, quest-
ioning love, “ I have brought
you My All, My Father, My
Home, My Glory, My Riches,
My Throne, and —Myself. I
want you and your love.—Will
you give yourself to Me now
and for all Eternity —
Will You?"


“ Out in the dew and cold He stands,
The drops of night are on His hair;
In patient love He waits without ;
And who, who keeps Him there ?
All Heaven is in His earnest voice,
All glory on His brow so fair;
In sorrowing love he stands without,
And you, you keep Him there 1
* Open to Me, beloved one!
With Me thy heart and dwelling share’?
But still at the barred doors He stands:
And who, who keeps Him there ?
But now no more we shut Thee out,
Oh Thou, the Fairest of the fair!
Come in, Thou Blessed One! we will
No longer keep Thee there.”
