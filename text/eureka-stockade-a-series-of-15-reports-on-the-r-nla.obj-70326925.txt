FIRST REPORT.
The Select Committee of the Legislative Council, appointed on the 18th of January, 1856,
to which was referred the Petition presented by Mr. Lalor from certain persons
residing at Ballaarat, and to which also were referred copies of Petitions from
certain persons claiming compensation for losses occasioned by the riots at
Ballaarat, have the honor to present to your Honorable Council the following
Progress Export.
1. Your Committee, in entering upon the consideration of the question referred to
them, have arrived at the following resolutions: ?
? That this Committee are of opinion, that no claims for compensation not hitherto
submitted to the Government should be entertained.?
? That this Committee, in examining the question submitted for their consideration
and report, are of opinion, that compensation for the property of private
individuals destroyed or injured in this case by the military authorities in the
preservation and maintenance of public order, may be fairly charged upon the
public revenues, when the owners of such property have not been legally proved
to be engaged in resistance to such authorities.
2. Your Committee have considered the question of the propriety of recommending
the appointment of a Local Board to enquire into the details of the claims for compensation,
referred to your Committee by your Honorable Council; but, having regard to the nature of
the evidence to be tendered, and the expense of such a tribunal, your Committee were of
opinion that substantial justice would be done to the claimants by their claims being
adjudicated upon by your Committee.
3. In deciding on the amounts to be recommended for payment in liquidation of the
various claims, your Committee, taking into consideration the great lapse of time since the
occurrence of the outbreak, have been guided by general circumstances, and in most cases
by the testimony of the several claimants, your Committee believing that it would amount
to exclusion to require exact proof of the various items, as, in many cases, all documents
were destroyed with the property.


4. Your Committee beg to recommend that the following sums be paid to the several
undermentioned claimants, in liquidation of their claims, viz.:?
s ?
Patrick Curtain 1000 0 0
Jeremiah Foster 129 4 0
Anne Diamond 600 0 0
Matthew Ryan 60 0 0
Patrick Donoghue . 180 0 0

5. Your Committee have had under their consideration the Petition of Mr. Benden
Sherrall Hassall, referred to them by your Honorable Council, and have determined upon
* � - m � > ?? *� t r
presenting to your Honorable Council a distinct report upon this case.

APPENDIX A.
CLAIMS FOR COMPENSATION.
Portions of Evidence taken before the Board of Enquiry.
THOMAS ALLEN (Old Waterloo), Examined.
I was kept a prisoner inside the Stockade on the morning of the 3rd December when it
was stormed by the military. I believe every tent inside the Stockade was burned, with the
exception of one, which was left standing, as there was a sick man in it. There might be about
twenty tents inside the Stockade. After the military retired with the prisoners I do not believe
that any tent, either inside or outside, was set fire to.
(Signed) THOMAS ALLEN.
LIEUTENANT GrARDYNE (40th Regiment), Examined.
I had command of a portion of the mounted men at Ballaarat on the 3rd December.
Captain Thomas gave me orders to cover his retirement from the entrenchment after it had
been stormed.
I saw the police set fire to some tents within the entrenchment, but I did not see any set
fire to outside.
I saw some shots fired from tents outside the entrenchment which were flanking the troops
as Captain Thomas advanced to the Stockade. I could distinctly see that those shots were fired
upon the advancing skirmishers.
I know of no instance where a tent was wantonly destroyed by the military or police
outside the entrenchment.

Melbourne, this 6th day of July,
1855.

CAPTAIN THOMAS (40th Regiment), Examined.
I recollect the morning of the 3rd December last; I was then in command of the troops
at Ballaarat. I had previously received information from Mr. Amos and others, that the rioters
had erected an entrenchment on the Eureka, for the purpose of opposing the advance of Sir
Robert Nickle with reinforcements of troops. I also heard the position was occupied by a large
D t ?No. 10, c .


body of armed men. In any case I deemed it necessary to destroy this entrenchment. I
accordingly led the troops thither. Advancing to the place we were fired upon by the armed men
who occupied the entrenchment, and after considerable resistance it was stormed and taken by
the troops. The firing then ceased. I withdrew the troops, and handed over the position to
Mr. Inspector Garter, of the foot police, giving him orders to destroy it by fire. There were several
tents inside the entrenchment, some of which were filled by armed men, who came out and fought
at the doors. I was about ten minutes on the ground outside the position after it had been
taken. The firing on our part had then been ordered to cease. I heard a few stray shots after
the firing at the entrenchment ceased, just when it was reported to me that the troops were being
fired on from some tents outside the entrenchment. I did not see any tent damaged or destroyed
by the soldiers or police outside the Stockade, with the exception of one the troops broke into for
the purpose of procuring blankets to carry a wounded man. Those blankets were afterwards paid
for, and the parties compensated for the damage done to their tent, by order of the Major-General,
on my recommendation. I did not give orders to have any other tent outside the entrenchment
destroyed or damaged.
I know a person called Allen. I believe he has a claim for compensation for his tent and
property, which were destroyed within the entrenchment. I believe him to be loyal, as he came
to the Camp previous to the occurrence on the 3rd, and reported that he had been detained a
prisoner within the entrenchment.
Do you recollect any firing taking place at the Government Camp on the evening of the
4th December ??ln reply to that question, as near as I can recollect, there were several shots
fired into the Camp on that evening; and it was reported to me by the officer of the guard, that
the sentries had returned the fire. Some of those shots had previously struck the mess room, and
the fence round the Camp. It was afterwards reported to me, that a man who had advanced up
the road towards the Camp while the firing was going on, had been wounded. Ido not believe
this man was connected with the insurgents, but foolishly placed himself in such a dangerous
position.
The officer of the guard reported to me, that shots had been fired in the direction this man
came from. The wounded man was taken charge of. His leg was obliged to be amputated; and
I have heard that he has since died.
