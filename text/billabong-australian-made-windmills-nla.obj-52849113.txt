“BILLABONG” Windmills
are Made in Australia
and contain many patented features which cannot be obtained in any
other Windmill. The workmanship throughout is second to none.
In no way has quality been sacrificed for apparent cheapness or
economy; and out en-
deavor to produfce a mill
approaching perfection
has been amply justified
by results.
Easy Running
Qualities
in order to develop the
maximum power on the
low wind velocities pre-
vailing in some districts
during the dry season,
the gears and all moving
parts have had most
careful attention. Con-
sequently, there is no
undue friction, and the
utmost power available
from light breezes is con-
verted to useful work.

Strength
A specially noticeable feature of the Bip-
Übong Windmill is its great strength.
The illustrations given here are repro-
duced from actual photographs, and
clearly show the ample proportions and
exceptional strength of all parts that are
subjected to strain.
The Mill Head is exceptionally compact.
This is a feature of Biij.abonc. design—
the bearings which carry the wheel gearing
and crank having been confined to reas-
onable space limits. Ample hearing sur-
faces are provided throughout, and the
load is accurately distributed to avoid side
strain and uneven wear.
All bolted parts in the Bii.i.abong Mill
which are subjected to strain are fitted
with double-nutted holts. The extra or
check nut forms a reliable and effective
'‘lock.’'
Stability The main shaft which carries
the wind wheel is situated lo%v
down in the main Casting (see Fig. 6502)
and the whole weight of the Mill is kept

close down to the lower-top, avoiding top heaviness. The lift is car-
ried centrally between two bearings, doing away with the lop-sided
strain which occurs when there is a bearing on one side only.

Only Five Four main and one crank. The large beating surface pro-
Bearings vided is a feature which greatly helps in maintaining
alignment, and considerably lengthens service. Reduc-
tion of parts without the sacrifice of “ easy motion ” has been our aim.
Consequently, the mill is not To liable to get out of order.
Alignment The boxes which carry the main hearings are integral
parts of the main casting (see F'ig. 6502, page 3). The
boxes and covers for both the upper and lower pairs of hearings are all
bored together with a special machine, thus making an automatic cer-
tainty of their correct alignment.
The Main Bearings are large and long. They are of the split or parted
tvpe, and are fitted with Fillers of “Velocite,” an anti-friction bearing
metal of our own manufacture, which has a reputation of many years’
standing. It withstands very great heat and forms an excellent cool
running surface.
Accessibility These Bearings are so easy of access that they may he
removed and replaced without removing any gearing
from the mill. Any person of ordinary intelligence can do it. An-
other advantage is the low' cost of renewals.

A Brass Ring hangs over the shaft and dips into the Oil Well below.
As the Shaft revolves, the ring revolves with it and
lifts the oil on to the Shaft, the bearings being coNTlNl’orsLV and
automatically lubricated as long as the mill is working.
Oil Supply Con- In the Biluabong Mill the Bearings are supplied
trolled by Mill with just the requisite quantity of oil according as
the Mill works quickly or slowly.
As the Biu.abong Oil supply ceases IMMkdiatrt.y the Mill is stopped,
there is no wastage of lubricant. This feature aids to lengthy running
on one filling of the Oil Wells.
Oil runs more freely during Summer weather than in Winter, but no
matter what the temperature the Bu.i.abong automatically lubricates
itself ON'I.V ACCORDING TO DEMANDS. Compare the Bidlabong
method with syphon cups or compression grease
cups, which continue to supply lubricant when the
mill is idle,
“ Billabong” Oil Use good Oil it pays every time.
the Proper Oil There isn't a great difference in
price between a poor and a good
quality oil, but there’s a remarkable difference in
results. Billahono Oil is of just the proper vis-
cosity for use in ring-oiled bearings, and allows
perfectly free action of the revolving rings. It is
reasonably priced, and has been subjected to severe
tests before being offered to the public.

cover for the balls. Compare this method to that of the mill which
swivels upon a flat surface. Is there any wonder that the Billahong

No Side In the Bili.abong Mill, all “overhanging” or “side" strain
Strain is eliminated. The direct, central lift concentrates all the
power just where it is needed, without any loss due to
imperfect balance which is unavoidable in Mills with bearings on one
side only. The perfect balance of the Bii.babong Mill conduces to
evenness of wear and consequent long service.

Shafts Are made of Cold Rolled Polished Steel, and are of large dia-
meter and uniform gauge.
Crank Pin The Crank Pin is so constructed that it locks in position
with all the effect of a solid piece, and cannot twist or un-
screw. It gives the security of the solid or cast; crank with the added
advantage that it may be renewed if necessary. It is covered by a
sleeve which fits into both gear and disc wheels, thus avoiding any
turning strain on the Crank Pin.
Gears Are moulded from machine cut patterns, ensuring smooth run-
ning. The Crank ('.ear Wheel is placed above the pinion (see
Fig. 6501, page 2).

Improved Guide Rod
Fig. 5513 shows the Guide Rod of the Billa-
bong Windmill. It is fitted with a wheel upon
which it moves smoothly and noiselessly up and
down, thus greatly minimising friction.
Pump Rod Swivel
The function of the Pump Rod Swivel (and its
necessary fittings) is to allow the mill head to re-
volve freely on its bed plate without transmitting
any twisting motion to the pump rod and bucket,
thus obviating unnecessary wear and tear. The
Pump Rod Swivel of the BillabonG Mill is re-
markably simple and effective. It is made of cast
steel, and is of ample strength.
Should any cause necessitate
a renewal of this part, same can
be effected easily, and at a trifling
cost. On many other mills no
such provision for renewing is
made, consequently when wear
takes place at this part a complete
guide rod has to be substituted.
This is only one of the many
money-saving and time-saving
points to be found throughout the
Biuabong Windmill.
Fig, 6514 illustrates the parts
that comprise the Pump Rod
.Swivel, shown in the lower por-
tion of Fig. 6513.

Patent
Pull-out
Swivel
An Important
“Billabong” Feature
With the Billauoxg pull-
out device comes a great ad-
vance in Windmill construc-
tion.
This device does notin any
way interfere with the align-
ment of the pump rod, but
is entirely subservient to the
central lift principle. In
other words the central
alignment of the pump rod
has not been sacrificed to ac-
commodate Hie pull-out
gear. This is an important
Bii,[.abong feature.
The apparatus is most ef-
fective and is easy to operate.
The wire and chain are kept
clear of working parts, and
on this account will seldom,
if ever, require renewing.
F'ig 5519 is an enlarged
and sectional view of the
pull-out swivel showing it in
position on the pump rod

Speed Regulator and Governor
(Patent 19711.)
Fig. 6520
This invention is protected by Patent Rights. It has neither
springs nor weights. It will govern the speed of the mill automatically,
reliably, and evenly in heavy winds. The Mill comes back into the
wind promptly, yet cannot race. The rale of the Mill's speed can also
be altered by simply turning the Regulating Screw A 2. This is of great
advantage when changing size and stroke of pump, or for adapting the
speed of the mill to suit the local average wind velocity.

In Windmills where the Tail Pins are part of the casting, an en-
tire main casting would have to be replaced should any cause necessitate
the renewing of the pins. This is not the case with the Bii,i,ABONO
Mills, for the Crucible Steel Brackets which carry the Biij.abong’s
Tail are fastened to the mill head or main casting by means of heavy
bolts, and can be renewed cheaply. (See Fig. 6520 page 14).
The Tail
To keep the mill wheel facing the breeze is not the only function of
the Tail. It plays an important partin the control or governing of
the mill, therefore special care has been exercised in the designing of
the Bl PI, A BONG’S Tail.
The Tail is properly proportioned to suit size of mill for which it is
Sheet intend :d. Strongly made of galvanised sheet steel. Edges
(k) are wire bound. Flat Steel Braces (j) are rivetted
across to ensure rigidity.
The Tail is constructed of two angle steel bars. It is rigid and neat.
Stem (») This style of tail stem is decidedly more satisfactory and re-
liable than the single stem so often employed.
The Tail (c) is one solid casting of extra
Bracket strength. It is equipped with
shock absorbers which take the
jar when the mill “shuts off ’’ (see Fig. 6523
page 16) and when the mill swings back again
(see Fig. 6520 page 14).
Pull-out Winch
F'or pulling the Mill out of the wind when
pumping is not required. Simple in con-
struction, and more easily operated than a
lever. Clamps securely to corner post of
tower.

The Wheel
The wheel of the Bit.labong is Strong, Rigid, and

The Sail The Inner Sail Clip shown. H Fig 6528 page 17, is made of
Clips heavy galvanised sheet steel stamped into shape and secure-
ly rivetted on to sail. The Outer Sail Clip, G Fig. 6528 page
17, is made of heavy galvanised sheet steel, and is composed of two
parts which are rivetted together at the ends. The back of this clip
forms an effective support for the complete curve of the sail. Both
clips reliably maintain the angle and curvature of the sails, am! are
easily fitted.
Wheel Bolts All bolts are double nutted (except tbe stove bolts which
and Nuts fasten the sail clips to rims ; these bolts should be slight-
ly rivetted on screwed end after being fitter! in position).
Thus every precaution has been taken to prevent parts of wheel from
working loose.
Another Surprised User
“ 1 founder that the Billabong can give points to every make of mill from top
to bottom. She controls perfectly. Just to show how easily the mill works, I have
had people come to look at it when there has not been enough wind to blow her
into gea r ; yet when I have gone up and.’ tu. rued her to the wind she will pump.

method of construction of
a 50 foot tower.
The diagonal brace bands
are made of flat steel, and
are arranged so as to pro-
vide a means of adjustment
with which to obtain rigid-
ity .
Horizont •! bands are also
made of angle steel. If
desired. Towers can be sup-
plied with Anoi.e Stkei,
Brace Bands instead of Flat
Bands at an extra cost.

Platform Strongly constructed of suitable timber, and carries two
pieces of angle steel across the underside, as shown in
Tower illustration—Fig. 6529, page 22. These crosspieces fit square
on Tower, and are firmly connected to corner posts by means of bolts ;
the whole producing a thoroughly safe and reliable platform.
Ladder Made of Bar Steel. All sec-
tions, except the top one, are
of uniform length, and the bolt holes
so arranged as to make it optional which
ends are connected.
Note. —The Tower Bands are drilled
so that the ladder may be fitted to any
side of Tower.

Anchor Posts Reliable anchorage is decid-
edly necessary for your Mill’s
safety. Bii.l.abonG Tower Anchor Posts are
made of heavy angle steel, thoroughly gal-
vanised. The foot or base is of ample
strength and size to make a firm connection
to the foundation planks or logs.
Test proved quality. User buys another Billabong—
An Agent writes :—We might mention that we, told Mr. a flillahong Wind-
mill, and he compared its worh with threeother makes he has on the pnmertp, and
he was so so tisfied with the superiority of the Billa hong that he has erected anoth-
er. Every one we have sold is giving satisfaction."

Little Bill
n This Windmill has been
■ designed specially to meet
the demand for a lower-
priced Mill for use on mod-
erate working loads.
The quality and workman-
ship throughout ere of the same
high standard as in the larger and
high-priced Bii.LabonG Mills de-
scribed in the preceding pages.
The difference in price has been
made possible by modifications of
some structural details, which are
shown in the illustration given
here (Fig. 6535.)
It will tie seen that the I jttlk
Bill is a single-geared Mill, and
is fitted with a solid cast Crank.
Gears are moulded from machine-
cut patterns, and are of 4to 1
ratio. Lubrication has been amply
provided for by means of glass
bottle Lubricators with Needle
feed.
The ball bearing Bedplate as-
sists in making the Mill sensitive
to varying wind piessures. The
steel Falls run in specially hard-
ened cast steel Ball-races. The
Main Bearings are lined with
“Velocite.” as in the Btllahong
Mills.
Generally, other construc-
tional details of the Little Bill
Windmills are the same as those
in the Billabong. Therefore, a
dependable Mill is provided at a
low price without the sacrifice of
quality and durability.

General Notes
Pipe Diameters The inside diameter of Suction ami Discharge Pipes
should not be less than half the internal diameter of
the Pump Barrel, but may often exceed this with advantage.
Pipes to Tanks Always arrange the Discharge Pipe from pump
to deliver over top of tank as shown in Figs. 6538-9
not into bottom of tank —using a separate discharge pipe from tank
for distributing purposes.
Vertical Suction Lift -from water to pump -should not exceed 25 ft.
Be sure your suction pipe is air tight.
Elevation of Mill Towers must be elevated at least 10 to 15 feet above
Mill Towers all trees, buildings, or any other obstructions in close
proximity'.
