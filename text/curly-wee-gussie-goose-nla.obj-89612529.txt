CURLY WEE
GUSSIE GOOSE
9d


ELECTION PROSPECTS
Here are the Buns at breakfast time.
They read the DAILY SQUEAK.
The Baron reads of politics and
speeches of the week.
The Baroness scans recipes and also
household tips
While Gwendoline the Hon (like us)
absorbs the comic strips.
“Aha, I see,” squeaked Baron Bun
as up his eyebrows went,
“Sir Darcy Whiskers has resigned his
seat in Parliament.
That means that Fur and Feather
Town must have a Member
new . .
(I say ! I wonder whom they’ll
choose, and so I’m sure do you.)
PROPER PARLIAMENT
“A Member new for Parliament . . .
(For you must understand
They have a proper Parliament in
Fur and Feather Land.
It isn't like our Parliament with
party system blessed.
No. Every Member’s on his own and
does his very best.)
A vacant seat in Parliament ! A seat
that must be filled !
The folk of Fur and Feather Town
were absolutely thrilled.
In street and office, house and club,
and over cups of tea
They all debated whom they’d choose
to be their new M.P.


WHO?
Oh, who should be the new M.P. ?
He must be good and kind.
(Ah, Children, can you guess the
name that jumped to every mind?)
He must oe honest, true and fair
. .sincere and yet polite . . .
(l‘ think I know the one they’ll choose
... I wonder if I’m right ?)
Now, who are these so tnrn and
grave, as solemn as can be ?
They re Baron Bun and Friend who ve
ccme to call cn Curly Wee.
“We want to see the noble count
and talk to him alone . .
And Jenkyns answers, “Step tms
way.” in reverential tone.
A SURPRISE
“Please, Sir, a deputation’s called.”
said Jenkyns with a grin.
Count Curly smoothes his bristles
down and grunted, “Show it in. . .”
He closed his book (which was a
work on Politics and Law).
“This is a nice surprise.” he smiled,
and shook the Baron’s paw.
“Count Curly Wee,” the Baron said>
in ringing squeak and clear.
“We want you in our Parliament.
(His friend remarked. Hear, hear.)
“So will you graciously consent the
vacant seat to fill ?”
Count Curly thought . . .hut not
fcr long . . . and then replied, I
will !”


A UNANIMOUS VOTE
Count Curly Wee for Parliament !
Oh. what a splendid choice !
There will not (as the saying is) he
cne dissentient voice.
He’ll take his seat in Parliament
without a bit of fuss.
“The vote will be,” I hear you say,
“quite, quite unanimous !”
Oh. Children, there’s a blow to come.
Did you forget the Rats ?
The ones who live beneath the town
in Drain and Sewer fiats ?
“What ? Vote for Curly Wee ?” they
snarl as in night clubs they meet.
“Wo want no honest candidate to
fill the vacant seat l”
ANOTHER CANDIDATE
“Curly goes to Parliament” (the
Rats are waving claws),
“We know that Pig will help to pass
a lot of noble laws.
Will try to stop the evil ways in
which our lives are spent.
We MUST NOT let Count Curly Wee
get into Parliament !”
“Come in, my friend,” called Mr.
Fox, as in his honse he sat.
“You needn’t tell me. why you’ve
called,” he told the crafty Rat.
“You want to know if I’m prepared
to stand for Parliament . . .”
He closed his . book on “How to
Bribe,” and chuckled, “I consent !”


SIGN THEIR NAME
To-day is Nomination Day for nam-
ing Candidates,
And I need hardly tell the name
that Ginger nominates !
(Twelve Citizens of age mature must
sign that form, you see,
To say they want the Noble Pig to
be their new M.P.)
Twelve Citizens have signed their
names. “And now,” smiles Baron
“I B think that I may fairly squeak
that is a good job DONE.
No other Candidate will dare our
Curly to oppose. „
We won’t have an election fight . . .
(Alas ! He little knows . . .)
MR. FOX NOMINATED
“See, there they go,” said Mrs, Hen
in cluck benign and warm,
“Look, Chick, our friends are hand-
ing in the Nomination Form . . .
The crowd who’d gathered round the
Hall to watch this solemn rite
Cried, “Curly Wee is named ! There
won’t be any fightt”
And then there fell a sudden hush
as through the crowd there came
The Rats, who bore another Form
which held another name.
With spiteful grins and nasty
squeak they called, “We nominate
The brilliant, clever Mr. Fox to be
our Candidate !”


WRONG v RIGHT
Two Candidates for Parliament ! Oh,
won't there be a fight !
Count Curly Wee v. Mr. Fox. The
Wrung against the Right !
. . . There’s Curley Wee's Committee
Room where his Supporters meet—
With open door and polished bell
and window curtains neat.
And there, next door, as you can
see, is Mr. Fox’s Roem,
With windows cracked and curtain-
less, it has an air of gloom,
And there are his Committee Rats, a
really cunning three—
They’re not the sort of helpers that
I’d like a-helping me !
RIVAL HELPERS
Count Curly Wee’s Committee Room
is such a pleasant place,
And on it from the wall beams down
his bland and noble face.
His helpers are all working hard
with happy, cheerful smiles
Arranging lists of voters’ names and
stacking them in files.
But look at Mr. Fox’s room, where
all is mess and grime,
His Helpers play (and cheat) at
cards to pass away the time.
(That cunning face upon the Willi
with dirt and dust is dim—
But even if they cleared it up, I
wouldn’t vote for HIM !)


CONTRAST IN CALLERS
Count Curly’s Canvassers set out.
From door to door they go.
They squeak, “Please vote for Curly
Wee. I hope you won’t say ‘no/ ”
And nearly everyone replies to Can-
vassers who call.
“If I had fifty votes to give, the pig
should get them all t”
The rats go round a-canvassing.
They snarl in manner rude.
“Now mind you vote for Mr. Pox,
That Curly Wee’s no good !”
And when a householder says, “No !”
or seems in any doubt,
They show their claws and bare
their teeth and scream, “We’ll pay
you out !”
MRS. HEN SUPPORTS CURLY WEE
Now, Mrs. Hen’s for Curly Wee. She
says to Mrs. Goat,
“Of course, my dear, you mean to
give Count Curly Wee your vote ?”
“Er . . well . .” bleats Mrs. Nanny
Goat, “I’ll ask my husband first.”
Which makes the Hen so very cross
that I’m afraid she’ll burst !
(For Mrs. Hen long, long ago, I beg
you won’t forget,
Was once in Fur and Feather Town
the leading suffragette.
She used to cackle, “Votes for
Hens !’’ and wear a shirt and tie—
And as for asking male advice, she
vowed she’d rather die !)


A NASTY SHOCK
The great Election Fight proceeds.
On every vacant space,
Our friends are sticking posters up
of Curly’s noble face.
It gazes down upon the town from
board and wall and tree,
“The Perfect Pig for Parliament !”
and “Vote for Curly Wee !”
The rats are busy too, but not with
placards. No !
With bits of chalk inside their claws
around the town they go.
One morning Mrs. Hen receives tne
nastiest of shocks:
The rats have chalked upon her
gate (imagine !) “VOTE FOR
FOX !”
CURLY WEE’S PLEDGE
The great Election Fight is on, witn
meetings every day,
And all his friends turn up to hear
what Curly has to say.
“I stand for all that’s Good ana
True, for Just and Splendid
Laws !”
Oh, listen to the thunder of ap-
plauding hooves and paws !
That Rat had come prepared to hiss,
His spirit failed him when
He saw on either side of him the
Mesdames Horse and Hen.
I cannot really wonder that he
didn’t risk a squeak,
And quailed beneath the Horse’s eye
and her companion’s beak !


MR. FOX STANDS
The great Election Fight is on. Free
speech for one and all,
So Mr. Fox holds meetings too, in-
side the big Town Hall.
“I si and for Slackness, Ease ana
Sloth. . . ” (His smile is sly and
sweet),
“I want to see a Gambling Den in
every road and street !”
“And I protest !” clucks Mrs. Hen,
who cackles loud and long.
(Well done, the cackling, heckling
Hen : “I think your plans are
WRONG !” , „ .
(N.B. It took a lot of Rats —a dozen
Rats or more-
To grab that erstwhile suffragette
and push her through the door !)
COMPARE THE TWO
The great Election Fight is on. One
Candidate you see.
Behaving as he always does, witn
kindly dignitee,
He never grunts, “Please vote tor
me,” but. Children, all the same,
Miss Mouse has vowed that she wilt
put a cross beside his name.
And there’s the other Candidate. Al-
though he’s base and vile.
He’s greeting all his enemies with
almost saintly smile :
(Oh dear. I fear some simple souls
may well be taken in,
And think, “This Fox is really nice.
Perhaps he ought to win !”)


REBUFF FOR MR. FOX
The great. Election Fight is on,
There’s Curly Wee once more,
Who’s chatting to the Rabbits as he
stands beside their door.
He grunts (as he would always
grunt), in kind and friendly tone.
While patting Baby Rabbit’s head,
“This little chap has grown. . .”
But Mr. Fox, sly Mr. Fox, who comes
along to call,
Cries, “What a SPLENDID little
chap, as handsome as he’s tall t
Come, let me shake your little paw !”
But little Baby R.
Squeaks, “Go away, you nasty fing !
I fink you’re horrid ! Yah !”
“AULD LANG SYNE”
The great Election Fight is on. Elec-
tion songs are sung.
Oh, hear this stirring chorus ring in
voices shrill and young.
(They have composed the lines them-
selves, so do not thing they’re
mine,
And set them to that well-known
tune, the tune of Auld Lang Syne).
“Oh, you can search from north to
south and search from east to
west,
You’ll never find a finer Pig, for
CURLY is the best.
Oh, he’s the only one we want to
be our new M.P.,
So come along in thousands strong
and VOTE FOR CURLY WEE !”


A SONG AND A THREAT
The great Election Fight is on. It
grows to fever heat ■
Just see the little Rodent band
parading down the street.
They sing a song about the Fox.
It’s a tune I cannot tell,
For every Rat sings sharp or flat,
and out of tune as well.
“If you don’t vote for Mr. Fox,”
they squeak in chorus high,
“Then twenty-thousand Sewer Rats
will know the reason why !”
(Oh, what a bit of boastful swank !
For you must understand
There are NOT twenty-thousano
Rats in Fur and Feather land.)
THE COLORS
The great Election Fight is on.
Around the streets are sold
The colors of the candidates. The
Black rosettes and gold.
Black for black-hearted Mr. Fox,
whose deeds are daru and bad:
Gold for the golden-hearted Pig, as
I need hardly add.
“I won’t be black !” Pat Porker
cries, “I’ll tell you what I’ll do —
I’ll paint myself from snout to tail
a lovely golden hue !”
“What HAVE you done?” his mother
gasps. He beams, “Now all can see
I am not black for Mr. Fox, but
gold for Curly wee !”


RATTLES AND SQUEAKS
The Baby Rats inside their prams
are decked with sable bows;
From underneath each dirty hood
there peeps a pointed nose.
They wave their (stolen) rattles
round, in grating squeaks they
cry,
“Oo’s GOT to vote for Mr. Fox!”
to every passer-by.
And Mr. Fox the Candidate must
kiss each rodent face,
The which he does, I will admit,
without the least grimace. s
(If Mr. Fox were not so bad, I’d
give him praise for that— »
For Fifty Pounds I would not kiss
a nasty Baby Rat!). 1
CANVASSING
But please observe the darling Ducks
and precious little Lambs,
Who go around in golden bows in
decorated prams.
Each shining face beneath its hood
is such a joy to see,
And oh, it’s sweet to hear them lisp
•‘Pleathe Vote for Curly Wee 1”
Count Curly stops to greet them all,
But I must firmly state ,
He doesn’t try to kiss them like a
fawning candidate. .
He lets them listen to his watch.
He even plays “Peep-Bo !”
But that’s because he really loves,
to make them laugh and crow. :


BRIBES FOR VOTES
The great Election Fight is on. Elec-
tion Day s in sight !
And now the Rats do lots of things
that are not really right.
They think up many nasty tricks
that I will not describe,
But, worst of all at such a time,
they start and try to BRIBE !
“If you will vote for Mr. Fox,” to
Mrs. Horse they saia,
“We’ll give you this, the smartest
hat that ever graced a head !”
(But Mrs. Horse could not be bribed,
I could have told them that !
Her loyal hoof came crashing down
upon the proffered hat !)
A TEMPTING OFFER
But still the Rats go round with
bribes. At nothing will they stop!
They bought the Goose a lovely
cake with icing on the top.
“We’ll give you this to eat, yourself,
likewise a box of chocs.
If you will only promise us to vote
for Mr. Fox.
You know I honor Gussie Goose,
The fight was fierce and grim,
What would be hard enough for us
was agony to him !
He shut his eyes. He set his beak,
“Take back your cake,” cried he,
“I will NOT vote for Mr. Fox. I’ll
vote for Curly Wee !”


BEFORE ELECTION DAY
And now it’s the Election Eve. Ob-
serve Count Curly Wee,
Who’s found a clover with FOUR
leaves instead of only three.
And Gus (a superstitious goose) cries
with a happy grin,
“Oh, Curly, what a bit of luck! That
means you’re SURE to win !”
<3
But Mr. Fox won’t be outdone by any
lucky Pig.
Inside his buttonhole he flaunts a
large white heather sprig.
(I cannot really think that sprig will
be of much avail—
It was a purple one he’d dipped in-
side a whitewash pail.)
NIGHT BEFORE
The night before Election Day ! The
time is almost ten,
The Fox —who doesn’t think of bed—
is in a gambling den.
He’s drinking toasts in cowslip wine
as though he’d won the fight.
And boasting to applauding Rats,
“Oh, I’ll get in all right!”
And see those evil friends of his ar-
rayed in hat and cloak,
The sort of garb that’s never worn
by honest kindly folk.
They’re off upon some evil job (but
what, I cannot tell)
With little packets in their claws—
the kind the chemists sell.


AN EVIL DAY
The night before Election Day t ‘“Oh,
Jenkyns,” Curly said,
“I think it would be wise for me to
seek an early bed.
Bting up some cocoa to my room.
I’ll drink it down last thing.”
‘‘l’ll make it now,” the Butler said,
“upon my own gas ring.”
“The cocoa will be boiling soon,”
thinks Jenkyns to himself,
The while he turns away to put the
tin upon the shelf.
He does not see the skinny claw
that through the window slips,
And into Curly’s evening drink a
powder packet tips !
NIGHTCAP
‘‘l’ve brought your cup of cocoa, Sir,”
obliging Jenkyns said,
And gave it on a silver tray to Curly
Wee in bed.
“It makes a splendid nightcap, Sir,
I’ve always found it grand . .
(This ISN’T an advertisement. I’ve
named no firm or brand !)
Stop, Curly Wee ! Don’t drink it up !
Oh, dash it from your lips !
That drink will have a dire effect on
anyone who sips !
How can we tell our gallant Pig he
is on danger’s brink ?
. . Too late for any warnings now !
He has begun to drink !


PETS CERLY TO SLEEP
Count Curly drank the fatal cup. He
drained it to the dregs.
“Oh, dear,” he yawned, “how tired 1
feel, with leaden brow and legs.
A drowsy numbness and an ache
across my senses creep . . .”
(More symptoms he could not de-
scribe because he fell asleep.)
Oh, see, up to his window ledge two
stealthy figures climb.
Two Rats who by their garb proclaim
that they’re engaged on CRIME.
(Conspirators all dress like that in
Fur and Feather Land,
And why they’re not “had up” on
sight. I cannot understand !)
THE DRUG
Outside Count Curly’s bedroom door
the Butler stopped and smiled.
“He’s sleeping, oh so soundly, like a
little pigling child.”
“He’s breathing deep,” agreed the
Cook (Count Curly does NOT
snore).
“Well, happy dreams!” they mur-
mured, and tip-trottered past the
door.
Inside the room the window’s raised,
Two evil Rats look in.
‘The drug is working nicely !” says
one villain with a grin.
‘We needn’t hush our squeals at all,”
he adds with such a leer,
‘He wouldn’t wake although we went
and shouted in his ear !”


ELECTION EVE
The night before Election Day . . .
The bells of midnight chime,
Inspector Goat’s asleep in bed. He
has no though of crime.
Awake, Awake. Inspector Goat, for
danger is ahoof !
(Alas, he only gives a snort which
nearly lifts the roof.)
Oh, see the pair of evil Rats around
Count Curly’s bed !
They’ve wrapped him in a blanket
from his trotters to his head.
“The sheets will have to do as
ropes,” the wicked creatures smile.
And truss our sleeping hero up in
really expert style.
KIDNAPPED
The evil Rats are leaning out across
the window sill . . .
(Will no one come to Curly’s aid ?
I fear that no one will !)
They must be letting something
down upon the ground below,
And what it is the picture on the
right hand side will show.
It well might be a cotton bale they
lower to the ground,
See. there it lands upon the flowers
with gently thudding sound.
But that’s no bale of cotton there,
Alack and woe is me !
It is the drugged and helpless form
of noble Curly Wee.


HOODWINKING
The Rats have slithered to the
ground. They find a barrow near,
"Good egg !” they snigger to them-
selves, “We’ll put our prize in
here
We’ll drape our cloaks across the
top to hide his form from sight.
And then we’ll wheel him far away
into the moonlit night !
•‘Hey ! What are you a-wheeling
off?” an old Policedog cries.
“A sack of Seed Potatoes. Sir,” one
crafty Rat replies.
"We want to plant them early, Sir-
in our allotment plot.”
“Good work the genial Dog ap-
proves (But good work that is
no t!)
THE GREAT DAY
Election Day has dawned at last, a
day that’s fine and warm,
And drawn out here, as clear as
clear, is the Election Form.
Beside each name, as you can see,
there is a vacant space.
(T know where I would place my
cross, if I’d a cross to place !)
To Polling Booth the voters come,
The first is Mrs. Sheep.
Although the vote’s a secret one, I
vote we take a peep !
On second thoughts we’d better not,
And so I’ll only say
She means to vote as we would vote
. . . i.e., the Proper Way.


RECORDS HIS VOTE
Outside the City Polling Booth the
gallant Bulldog stood,
He told the voters where to vote (but
never how they should).'
“You’re Richard Rodent, 12 The
Drain ? Then you turn left,” he
said,
“Record your vote inside the room
that’s labelled M. to Z.”
“Where do I vote?” asked Cuthbert
Colt. “I fear you don’t, my son,
“You’ll have to wait,” the Colonel
laughed, “until you’re twenty-one.”
The Colt looked cross and stamped
his hoof, “Oh, what a beastly
shame !”
I’m sure my younger readers must
have often felt the same !)
NO TRICKERY
The voters all came trooping up in
ones and twos and threes,
And Colonel Bulldog asks, “What
name?” and tells them “This way,
please.”
“I’m Mrs. Hen. Where do 1 vote?”
(What’s happened to her? Gosh!
She looks as thin as if she’d shrunk
or dwindled in the wash !)
The Colonel might have let “her"’ in
(for Mr. Fox to vote !)
If he had not observed a tail that
trailed beneath “her” coat.
He quickly grabbed “her” beak and
comb which both came clean
away !
‘‘You sly, impersonating Rat, you
shan’t vote twice to-day.”


ELECTION DAY
Election Day ! There’s Mr. Fox, in
all his best arrayed,
He’s driving round inside a car (for
which he has not paid).
“Midst many boo’s” and some
“Hurrah’s” he keeps serene and
bright,
And doffs his hat with charming
smiles, and bows from left to
right.
“Where’s Curly Wee?” the Rats in-
quire with most unpleasant sneer,
“Perhaps your precious Candidate’s
too lazy to appear?”
To those who wear Count Curly’s
badge they verj rudely shout.
“Your Curly Wee is too ashamed
to show his silly snout !” ,
GETS A SHOCK
“It’s queer,” said Jenkyns to him-
self, “my master doesn’t stir . . .”
He tapped upon the bedroom door
“You should oe rising, Sir !
They’re voting at the Polling Booth,
I think it’s time you woke;
You should be out and driving
round among the cheering folk!”
He turned the handle of the door
and saw the empty bed.
“My master’s got up early ! Good t*
in some relief he said.
And then he stopped, his goggling
eyes fixed in a glassy stare,
For there were all Count Curly’s
clothes laid out upon the chair !


COUNT CURLY DISAPPEARS
Poor Jenkyns tore his bristles grey,
He wrung nis -rotters two.
•‘Count Curly Wee has disappeared!
Whatever shall I do?
He’s gone away without a grunt. He
hasn’t left a note !”
And Jenkyns seized the telephone.
“I want Inspector Goat !”
“Tut, Jenkyns,” said Inspector Goat
with really maddening calm,
“I don’t suppose my noble friend
has come to any harm.
Perhaps he’s walking in his sleep.
I’ll ask if he’s been seen—
A fine somnambulating Pig, in
striped pyjamas green, . . .”
“YOUR CANDIDATE?”
The morning hours tick swiftly by.
No Curly Wee is found.
Although they try to keep it dark,
the news soon travels round,
And through the town the rumor
runs in whispered squeak and
neigh,
“Count Curly Wee has disappeared
upon Election Day !”
Of course the Rats are jubilant. Be-
side tlhe booths they wait,
And ask the friends of Curly Wee,
“Huh, where’s your Candidate?
How like a pig to sneak away ! Ha-
ha ! Ho-ho ! Hee-hee !
And that’s the sort of chap you’d
choose to be your new M.P.”


DUTY BOUND
The fox is driving round the town.
He has a megaphone,
“You ought to vote for me,” he
barks in most beguiling tone.
“I don’t desert my post!” he cries
in his persuasive way.
“I stay to do my duty here upon
Election Day !”
And lots of folks who came to vote
for noble Curly Wee
Began to think, “Now, should we
vote for such an absentee ?
Perhaps he will behave like this
when he’s in Parliament . . .?
We will not vote for anyone . .
And home again they went.
INSPECTOR GOAT
Inspector Goat is worried now. He
starts—a little late—
To go along to Curly’s house and
there investigate.
“You’re sure chat nothing has been
touched ?” he asks the sobbing
cook . .
(Inspectors always say that first.
I’ve read that in a book.)
“There’s where my master slept last
night,” the butler showed the bed.
“And on that dented pillow there
he laid his noble head.
And that’s the chair beside the bed
with all his clothes laid out . .
Poor Jenkyns drew his hanky out
and loudly blew his snout . . .


A GOAT INDEED
The Goat looked down at Curly’s
bed. “No sheets and blankets
here !
Noi, why should sheets and blan-
kets, too, with Curly disappear ?”
Quite simple !” said the silly Goat,
“There hasn’t been foul play,
-Our friend has just slipped off up-
on a camping holiday !”
“Slipped off upon Election Day ?
Oh, are you sure you’re right ?”
In answer to poor Jenkyns’ grunt
the Goat re-bleated “Quite !
It’s very mean of Curly Wee. He
shall not have my vote !”
(You know, I am inclined to think
he’s rightly named a Goat ’•)
NOT FORGOTTEN
The Rats were simply wild with joy.
They almost danced a jig !
They quoted the Inspector’s view
about the missing- Pig.
To Mr. Fox the news was pie. He
made the most of it.
“I grieve to think the Pig’s slipped
off . . (Ugh. What a hypocrite '■)
Do all believe that Curly’s gone ?
Alas, I fear they do !
No ! I am wrong. Not everyone.
There are a faithful few.
Young Michael Mouse and Cuthhert
Colt and also Patrick P.
Will not believe the shameful tale
about Count Curly Wee.


CURLY'S CHAMPIONS ARE REBUFFED
Yes, Michael Mouse and Cuthbert
Colt are Curly’s champions now,
With Patrick Porker as a third, they
vow a mighty vow.
“We’ll find the missing Curly Wee,
and clear his noble name !”
“I vow !’’ squeaks Mike. “I vow !”
grunts Pat, and Cuthbert neighs
the same.
The three proceed to Curly’s house,
Alas, it must be told
That their reception at the door
was very, very cold.
“Detectives ? Stuff ! You can’t
come in and see Count Curly’s
room !”
And Jenkyns slammed the door on
them with a resounding BOOM !
A CLUE
Our young detectives, undeterred by
their reception rude,
Crept round the garden till all three
by Curly’s window stood;
“His bedroom window . . .” neighed
the Colt, and then he whistled long,
“Whew, chaps ! This wall’s been
badly scraped. Now, that means
something wrong !”
“Ho ! Look at this !” And Michael’s
eyes in great excitement flashed,
“The flowers that bloomed upon this
bed have all been badly bashed !”
“Some heavy load’s been dropped
down here!” shrieked little Pat-
rick P,
“It measures . . (and he paced it
out) “. . . the length of Curly
Wee !”


WELL-MARKED TRACKS
“How dare you loiter round this
house !” there came a sudden
shout
As from the window there appeared
a red and angry snout.
If Jenkyns hadn’t been so cross—
because he was upset—
He would have heard of Cuthbert s
clue . . . the most important yet !
For Cuthbert Colt found something
else He gave a breathless squeal.
He pointed to the well-marked tracks
made by a barrow wheel,
“The load that might be Curly Wee
was in a barrow laid !”
“ Get out ! GET OUT !” came
Jenkyns’ grunt. (His nerves were
rather frayed.)
CURLY’S HOUSE
The young detectives, Cuthbert Colt
Pat Porker, Michael Mouse,
Turn tail along the garden path
away from Curly’s house.
It’s not with fear their heads are
bent, I’d have my readers know,
They’re following the barrow’s
tracks, as down the path they go,
Out through the garden gate thej
file, pursued by Jenkyns’ cries,
And still tneir heads are bowed and
bent, and on the ground then
“Don’t bump into my wings like
that !” clucks someone in wax.
(Pat can’t see people coming when
his gaze is fixed on tracks !)


THE FOX
Along the pavements, down the
streets the three detectives go.
Sometimes they almost lose the
tracks because they hardly show.
(“Just see those youngsters,” grown-
ups smile, “at some new game they
wfvich is the sort cl silly thing that
Grown-ups often say !)
Honk ! Honk ! The Fox goes driv-
ing by, so arrogant and proud.
The cheers that greet his progress
now are getting rather loud.
His car stirs up a lot of mud which
slashes Michael’s coai.
The Fox just laughs. He doesn t
care. (For Michael has no vote).
THE RIVER’S BRINK
On, on the three detectives go. And
Patrick Porker sighs,
“This looking-out for barrow tracks
IS hard upon the eyes
Besides, it’s nearly dinner time. MS
tummy tells me so . . .”
•We must go on !” stern Cuthbert
neighs . . . And on and on they
go.
The wheel tracks to the river lead,
right to the river’s brink.
The three sit down upon the bank
and pause awhile to think.
“The barrow has been rowed across
. . .” Young Patrick says no more,
But points towards a boat Wiat’s
moored upon the FARTHER
shore.


NO TURNING BACK
If you and I’d been in their place
we might have turned away.
We might have cried, “Let’s give it
up !” or “Let’s call it a day !”
“I won’t attempt to swim that
stream.” you might have said to
me.
Adding (if you’re a peevish child
“Oh. bother Curly Wee !”
But Patrick Porker, Cuthvert Con
and little Michael M.
Are not a bit like you or me. NO
turning back for them.
Would Sherlock Holmes or Sexton
Blake turn back, do you suppose?
Would Wimsey mind if he got wet ?
A hundred thousand No’s!
TOWNS-FOLK SAY
Meanwhile beside the polling booths
the Bulldog pleads in vain.
“Oh, won’t you vote for Curly Wee?
He’ll soon be home again.”
“We meant to vote for Curly Wee ..
But since he’s gone away
We will not vote for anyone” the
sulky townsfolk say.
And even Mrs. Hen clucks, “No !”
and from the booth turns tail.
“This shows,” the suffragette re-
marks, “one cannot trust a MALE !
If he’d been Mrs. Curly Wee, he’d
not have failed us now
I won’t vote for an absentee ! My
conscience won’t allow !”


TRACK CLEAR AGAIN
The three have -eached thi farther
shore. They are a dripping sight !
I can’t think what their parents dear
will say to them to-night !
(Detectives in detective tales are
luckier by far.
They don’t get told, “you’ve spoilt
your suit” by any cross mamma !)
“Hurrah ! The harrow track again !”
Pat Porker jumped with glee.
“It’s clear as clear across this field
for everyone to see !
Whoever wheeled this barrow here
was someone far from good—
He’s wheeled it right across the
crops, which no one ever should !”
VOTES FOR CURLY WEE
From field to field the tracks went
on, through gates left open wide
(Just fancy leaving gates ajar across
the countryside
•‘That’s further proof,” cried Pat-
rick P. (the clever little lad 0
“That he who pushed the barrow
here was someone very bad !”
(The tellers counting up the votes
in Fur and Feather Town
Are looking at results so fax with
very worried frown.
The Rats are voting to a rat for
Francis Fawcett Fox,
But votes for Curly Wee are few
inside each ballot box.)


WHEEL TRACKS
The track is leading to a wood . . .
I don’t know how you feel,
But I am tired of looking at the
traces of that wheel.
Besides, the wood is thick and dark.
It looks so grim and black,
I know if I were standing there
I’d jolly well turn back !
“I say, you two.” neighs Cuthbert
Colt, “Let’s chucK this tracKins
biz
(He doesn’t say that he’s afraid, but
I can see he is.)
“I should go home,” grunts little
Pat. “I’ve messages to do . .
(Some messages ! That’s some ex-
cuse ! Young Pat is nervous
too !)
JOB RIGHT THROUGH
But Mike’s a Chartermousian, a
prefect of his House.
There is the honor of his school, the
code of Chartermouse .
“I could not face my fellow mice if
I forgot my vow !
I can’t turn back when once my
claw is set upon the plough !”
In stirring squeaks the Mouse
harangued the Colt and little Pig.
“Look here, you chaps, we must go
on. Don’t think me, please, a prig,
But I have learnt at Chartermouse
to see a Job Right Through.
And for the Honor of my School,
that’s what I mean to do !”


HIGHWAY RATS
Young Michael’s squeaks have done
the trick. Hurray, hurray, hurray .
For Cuthbert Colt recalls the cuae
of Horse Academy.
The honor of his school (Pig’s Prep.)
is saved by Patrick P.
And all go off into the wood to look
for Curly Wee.
It’s not at all a pleasant wood. In
days of long ago
It was a haunt of Highway rate
who were not nice to know.
They’d lie in wait for travelling
Mice with blunderbuss or knife,
And in a dreadful manner snarl
“Your money or your life t”
A HARMLESS BUSH
The barrow track leads through the
wood. “Ah !” Cuthbert neighs
‘‘What’s that?
I’m sure I see the crouching form
of some old Highway rat !”
(He’s wrong. It’s just a harmless
bush . . . Don’t laugh at Cuthbert
please.
It did look like some Highway rat
a-lurking in the trees !)
The harrow track leads through the
wood. Pat Porker goes in front.
“We’re coming to a clearing now I”
the others hear him grunt.
“Oh, (here’s an inn where we can
rest!” He runs on full of hope.
And stops beneath a swinging sign
which says. “THE RAT AND
ROPE.”


END OF THE TRAIL
“THE RAT AND ROPE,” says Cuth-
bert Colt, whose neigh is very low.
“That wasn’t whai this inn was
called in days of long ago.
Another name was on the sign that
swings upon the pole.
For it was called THE GALLOWs
INN when granddad was a foal!
“Look, look !” Young Michael’s
squeak is shrill. He turns to both
his friends.
“The track we’ve followed all this
way, see, this is where it ends!”
That’s true enough. For Mike has
seen what I observed before—
The barrow tracks go up the steps
and underneath the door !
CONQUERED FEAR
“Oh, let’s go back !” neighed Cuth-
bert Colt. “Yes, let’s !” (Thas
grunt was Pat’s.)
“This inn gives me the horribles !
I bet it’s full of rats !”
“If Curly Wee’s inside,” said Par
with slightly paling snout,
“I don’t see how the three of us can
hope to get him out.”
Well, Michael, are you turning bach?
you are ? Oh, no, I’m wrong !
He might have ... if he hadn’t
thought about the old School song.
High (in nis little mind, of course)
the sweet young squeaks ring
clear:
“Fight for yo ir House and Charter-
mouse and (if) Conquer Fear !”


A RAT-TAT-TAT-TAT
Up to the tavern doer they go. the
valiant little three.
(Yes, all have plucked their courage
up I’m very glad to see.)
They tfy the latch. It doesn’t lift.
“What shall we do ?” asks Pat.
Young Michael boldly squeaks, “We
knock !” Rat-tat. Rat-tat. RAT-
TAT !
Hark ! Here come footsteps shuffling
along a stone-flagged floor.
A key is turning in the lock and
loudly creaks the door.
.... If I believed in witches now
like little Patrick P.
I’d quickly put a mile or more be-
tween that Rat and me !
GINGER BEER
The old Rat bared her toothless
gums in such a horrid grin.
(It would have been as horrid if
she d had her dentures in !)
She mumbled slowly, “What j’ya
want ?” in such an evil croak,
That ycu’d have almost thought it
was a slimy frog that spoke.
“Er . .” Michael’s squeak was rather
low because he was afraid.
“Er .... Have you any ginger beer
or fizzy lemonade. . . ?”
(But w'hile he squeaked his little
eyes kept sharp look-out to see
If down the passage he could spot
some signs of Curly Wee.)


VERY WICKED RAT
The old Rat laughed a croaking
laugh, a hateful laugh to hear.
“We don’t sell fizzy lemonade or
harmless ginger beer.
But in you come, my little dears,"
She gave a beckoning sign,
"And I will sell you all a glass of
dandelion wine !”
She’ll sell them dandelion wine ! Oh,
I AM in a rage !
She’ll sell intox-i-cating drink to
minors UNDER AGE !
Oh, what a very wicked Rat to break
the country’s law.
No wonder Cuthbert looks appalled
and Michael bites his claw.
DECISION
Oh, dear, this is extremely hard for
our detectives three.
For if they DON’T go in the Inn
they mayn’t find Curly Wee.
And if they DO they’ll have to drink
the dandelion wine—
A prospect which (quite rightly !)
gives them shivers down the spine.
They’re go-ing in. They’ve made
their choice, and, Children, it is
true
That they have done what Sherlock
Holmes and Sexton Blake would do.
(But Sexton Blake and Sherlock
Holmes drank wine without a
qualm:
Because they were grown-up, vou
know, it didn’t do them harm.)


THEY POUR THE WINE AWAY
Three dirty tumblers full of wine
are set before the three.
(This is a sight which, I confess, I
cannot bear to see.)
“Here is the money,” Michael
squeaks, and tenders half-a-crown.
“Just tuppence change,” the old Rat
croaks. “I’ll bring the money
down.”
Hurray ! Hurray : the three are saved
from foul intox-i-cant !
For Michael pours his wine upon an
aspidistra plant.
And Cuthbert quickly follows suit,
and so does little Pat.
(It kills the aspidistra, but I do not
grieve at that !)
A LARGE TRAP DOOR
Now, as they’re waiting for their
change, the three gaze round
about.
“Hark !” Michael’s ears are all agog
“I heard a muffled shout.
It came from underneath this room !
Hark ! There it is once more !”
And Michael laid his ear upon the
carpet on the floor.
“Roll back the carpet !” Patrick
grunts. (Oh dear, be quick you
three !
Fcr when the Rat returns with
change how angry she will be !)
They roll the dusty carpet back upon
the dusty floor
And find (Oh, Children, what a
thrill !) a large and square TRAP
DOOR !


TRAP DOOR IS LIFTED
The ancient Rat is coming back !
She’s almost at the door !
At once the dusty carpet’s pulled
across the grimy floor.
. . . “Here is your change, young
gents,” she croaks. The pence are
counted out.
(And what a tinny clink they have
They’re bad, I have no doubt !)
“More dandelion wine !” cries Mike,
and orders glasses three.
He gives the Rat his last half-crown.
“I’ll bring more change,” says she
As soon as she has shuffled off with
dragging steps and slow.
The carpet’s back, and trap door’s
up, and all gaze down below.
A BUNDLE
There is a cellar underneath, with
barrels full of beer.
But something else is there as well,
A muffled grunt they hear !
“I say, you chaps, keep watch for
me,” Pat Porker tells his friends.
He puts a trotter on the step and
downward he descends.
Look, Pat is in the cellar now ! He’s
peering all around.
He sees, against two barrels laid, a
bundle on the ground.
It’s SOMETHING in a blanket
trussed, Whatever can it be ?
(Oh, bother ! I must end this verse,
you’ll have to wait and see !)


FOUND AT LAST
Young Patrick whipped his clasp-
knife out. He cut the bonds in
two.
“Count Curly Wee !” he gasped with
joy, “Count Curly Wee, it’s you
Count Curly, still a little dazed, and
in pyjamas clad.
(But dignified and noble still '■)
cried, “Thank you, Pat, my lad !”
Now, to the room above the vault
the ancient Rat came back.
•‘l’ve brought you down your
change,” she croaks. “But where’s
the Pigling black ?”
•‘He’s looking for a friend,” says
Mike, “who may be passing by .
(That is so very nearly true it can’t
oe called a lie !)
AN UGLY CROWD
Count Curly Wee and Patrick P are
in the vault below.
let them both come up.” you
say. Oh, children, children, NO !
For at this moment Michael hears a
really awful din,
As through the wood some hundred
Rats advance towards the Inn !
Yes, through the wood the Rats ad-
vance in dirty garments clad,
Large, nasty Rats with cudgels
armed, as ugly as they’re bad.
(They are a band of roving Rats
who round the country roam,
And use the Inn (“The Rat and
Rope”) as we would use our home.)


NOT A SECOND TO WASTE
The old Rat to the front door ran,
She gave a cackling squeal.
“Come in, my merry lads,” she
croaked, “I’ve cooked you all a
meal.
There’s three young gents a-drinking
here,” she told the leading Rat,
Who said “That so?” and made a
face and (please forgive me! —
spat !
“Quick, Pat ! Come up ! squeaks
Michael Mouse. “Make haste, oh
do make haste !’•
“Don’t dawdle, Pat !” neighed Cuth-
hert Colt, “We’ve not a sec. to
waste !“
“Right ! Half a mo. ! I’m coming
up !” grunts little Patrick P.
(You note he does not say a word
about Count Curly Wee.)
CHANGE IN PATRICK P.
The Rats came crowding to the Inn.
There is no time to lose.
No wonder Mike and Cuthbert Colt
are trembling in their shoes !
Oh good! Here’s Patrick coming up.
His dusky head I see.
Now, roll the carpet back again as
quickly as can be !
The carpet’s back, all straightened
out across the big tiap door.
The three around the table sit, just
as they sat before.
. . . But, Children, took at Patrick,
please. He doesn’t seem so black.
His clothes (so roomy once) appear
as though the seams would crack !


TOO GREAT ODDS
The Rats into the tavern stride,
They’re crowding through (he door.
There are at least a hundred Rats,
(as I have said before.)
How silly now to think our friends
can rescue Curly Wee —
The odds against them are too great
... A hundred versus three !
“Get out, you youngsters !” snarl
the Rats. “Just leave your wine
and go !”
The three get up without a word.
They think it better so.
Oh, look at Pat! He still looks grey.
That shows that he’s afraid.
(When anyone is terrified his color’s
apt to fade.)
JUST THREE HARMLESS STRIPLINGS
Away our little comrades ran as
quickly as they could,
Pat Porker, Mike and Cuthbert Colt
all tearing through the wood.
(You know Pat Porker puzzles me.
I’m SURE that he has grown.
Besides, his squeaking grunt’s be-
come a fruity baritone !)
The Rats who loitered in the wood
let the three friends run through.
“They’re just three striplings,”
sneered the Rats, “no harm to us
they’ll do !”
(Yes, I’m afraid the Rats are right,
They need not fear our three.
There’s really nothing to be done to
help Count Curly Wee.)


“THE PIG IS NICELY QUEERED!”
The Rats inside the RAT AND ROPE
were full of evil glee.
They toasted Mr. Fox’s name. “Here’s
to our new M.P. !
The Great Elec ion Fight is won
The Pig is nicely queered :
Oh, no one votes for Curly Wee be-
cause he’s disappeared
They shouted down the cellar steps.
“You’re beaten Pig !” they cried.
They mocked the trussed and pros-
trate form that rolled from side to
side.
They listened to the muffled grunt
and chuckled with delight.
“His voice has gone all shrill and
high. He must be in a fright!”
NO VOTES FOR CURLY WEE
The wood is past. “Oh, Mike,”
grunts Pat in his deep baritone.
“Just lend me tuppence, if you
please. I want to use that phone.”
(I see. He means to phone for help
to rescue Curly Wee . . .
Too late ! Before that help arrives
the Fox will be M.P.!)
Now there you see the Polling Booth.
Business, alas, is slow.
The Rats for cunning Mr. Fox have
voted long ago.
Our Pig’s supporters (to their shame)
inside (heir houses stay.
They will not vote for Curly Wee be-
cause he’s gone away.


JUST ONE HOUR TO GO
The Polling Booth must close at
nine. That is the law you know.
And now it’s close on eight o’clock.
There's just one hour to go.
By jove, the Fox is locking smug,
“I bet I’ve won,” says he,
“For hardly anyone has come to vote
for Curly Wee !”
And then the Fox goes very pale. He
givas a sudden start.
One paw is to his forehead clapped,
the other's on his heart.
The sweat stands out upon his brow.
His pulse in panic beats . . .
For what’s that noble grunt he hears
a-ringing through the streets?
CURLY WEE IS BACK IN TOWN
Oh, Children, Children, look at that!
We are not mad I hope,
We KNOW that Curly Wee lies hound
beneath the RAT AND ROPE.
Yet there he stands, our noble Pig,
in his election car.
And (through the microphone) his
grunt is ringing near and far
“Count Curly Wee is in the town!
He hasn’t gone away :
He’s here, he’s here to win the fight
upon Election Day!’
From house to house the cry went
round, it rose from every throat,
“Quick! To the Polling Booth we’ll
go to give the Pig our vote !”


FROM EVERY HOUSE THE INMATES RAN
“Count Curly’s back!” the cry went
round. “Ine time is after eight;
We ll have to vote for him at once,
or it will be too latei
Oh, hurry, hurry! Do be quick!”
(For everybody knows
That on the stroke of nine o’clock
the Polling Booth must close).
The supper plates were left unwash-
ed,the papers left unread,
The little ones were left alone to
put themseives to bed.
From every house the inmates ran
—wi'hout a hat or coat —
To reach the Polling Booth in time
to give our Pig their vote.
MANY VOTES FOR CURLY WEE
“Count Curly’s back! Count Curly’s
back ! He didn’t go away !”
These words rang through the the-
atre in the middle of a play.
As if they’d heard the shout of
“Fire !” before you could count
three
The audience through the exit rush-
ed to vote for Curly Wee.
(“And were the actors cross?” you
ask. You needn’t be distressed,
For actors, yes, and actresses had
votes like all the rest.
With grease paint thick on every
face, in costume clad they came
Up to the Booth to put a cross
against Count Curly s name.)


DOWN THE CELLAR STEPS TREY GO
The Fox beside the Polling Booth
sees voters rushing in.
He knows they will not vote for him.
. . . He’s lost his oilv grin.
He snar’s at a Conspirator (the Rat
in hat and cape).
“You silly chump ! Your friends
and you have let the Pig escape !”
The tavern Rats have heard the news,
“It isn’t true !” they swear,
“Count Curly Wee lies trussed and
bound beneath the cellar stair !”
And one by one they hurry down
the cellar steps to see
The bundle on the cellar floor they
know is Curly Wee.
A GREAT SURPRISE
There IS a Pig trussed up, all
right. The Rats are quite cor-
rect . . .
But, when the bundle is untied, it’s
not what they expect.
This Pig. in large pyjamas clad, is
small and round and fat —
Instead of gallant Curly Wee they
see . . . the Pigling Pat!
(Yes, Pat had taken Curly’s place.
Count Curly had gone black ■
He’d smeared himself with cellar
grime, of which there was no lack.
He’d dressed himself in Patrick’s
clothes and joined the other two—
A trick which had deceived the Rats
as well as me and you !)


INSPECTOR GOAT APPEARS
My goodness me, those Rats were
WILD to find they had been
tricked !
They squeaked. “We’ll punish Pig-
ling Pat ! He shall be scratched
and kicked !”
But just as they advanced on Pat
they heard a whistle clear.
And someone yelled, “Police !
Police : Inspector Goat is here !”
The Rats went tearing through the
wood. They tried to get away.
But only one or two escaped. I’m
very glad to say.
Against Inspector Goat and Co.
they fought without avail,
And they were caught by scruff and
paw, by whisker and by tail !
ON THE STROKE OF NINE
It’s five to nine on Pollihg night.
Five minutes yet to go.
The voters still come pouring up in
steady, ceaseless flow.
They know for whom they mean to
vote. Oh, no one has a doubt.
They put their cross beside one
name, and quickly hurry out.
Police dogs stand with watch in
paw. “Two minutes now ! Be
quick !”
Oh, see this bathchair bringing in
the Aunt of Ginger Dick !
Oh, dear, I fear she is too late. No,
no, she’s not ! That’s fine t
She puts her cross by Curly’s name
.TUST AS THE CLOCK STRIKES
NINE !


TOO LATE TO VOTE
The Town Hall clock is striking
nine. There goes the final note.
And see. the Polling Booth is closed
and no one now can vote.
We do net knew if Mr. Fox or Curly
Wee has won.
One thing alone is certain now:
Election Day is done ’■
The old Rat from the Tavern comes.
hobbling and breathless too
“Here, let me in to give my vote !”
She asks the Dog in Blue.
“No use,” the large Police Dog barks
with calm, uplifted paw.
“You’ve come along too late to
vote. And that. Ma’am, is the
law.”
SMILES AND FROWNS
The Counters by the ballot box are
counting out the slips.
And, as you see. a happy smile
curves Colonel Bulldog’s lips
His chest (a fine one, anyway) seems
further to expand,
And every now and then he bar Ks.
“By gad, Sir, this is GRAND.”
The other counter is a Rat. He
doesn’t look so gay.
He grits his little pointed teeth in
quite a worried way
(The slips for the two Candidates
are put in separate piles . .
I wonder why the Rat seems glum
and Colonel Bulldog smiles?)


WHO IS THE WINNER?
“Who’s won the Great Election
Fight?” So everybody squeaks.
I’m glad to say they’ve not to wait
(as some have done) for weeks.
They’ll hear the great result to-
night. Late, late to-night they’ll
know.
That’s why some wait in dressing-
gowns beside the radio.
And round the floodlit City Hall
great crowds assemble there.
The Corporation all turn out. So
likewise does the Mayor.
From far and near the folk have
come, to stand and wait and see
If Curly Wee or Mr. Fox will be
their new M.P.
THE ELECTION RESULT
The crowd have waited there for
hours ... As night approaches
morn
A whisper ripples through tne
throng like wind across the corn.
And every face with one accord is
turning up to see
The gallant Bulldog who appears
upon the balconee.
A hush, as though before a storm
falls on the waiting crowd.
Then, through the microphone,
there comes the Colonel’s accents
loud.
“Here is the news you’re waiting
for !” (Just see the Colonel’s
grin:)
“By over twenty thousand votes
COUNT CURLY WEE IS IN.”


WINNER AND LOSER MEET
Then out upon the balcony came
the opponents two.
Count Curly got a mighty cheer, the
Fox a ditto 800 !
(You'd think the Rats would cheer
the Fox. But that is not their way.
Instead they all desert their friend,
because he’s lost the day.)
Count Curly put his trotter out with
gesture truly great.
And, “Shake !” he cried to Mr. Fox,
the beaten Candidate.
But Mr. Fox just bared his teeth
and looked extremely black.
And with a snarl he placed—and
kept—his paw behind his back.
CURLY WEE, M.P.
Count Curly makes a little speech,
a speech of gratitude.
I’m glad the Press Hounds write it
down, because it is so good.
I’m glad it will appear in print, for
now I must admit
The crowd are far too overjoyed to
hear a word of it !
Oh, there is dancing in the streets
around the bonfires red.
And there are streamers tossed
about and flags waved overhead.
Bells, trumpets and moutn organs,
too, ring out in merry glee,
Because the Pig has won the fight
and is the new M.P.


GOOD REFORMS
So Curly went to Parliament to help
to rule the land,
And what a statespig Curly made !
Why, he was simply grand.
You’ve heard of Gladstone and of
Pitt ? Well, I can only say
He was as fine as both of them in
every kind of way !
And oh the great and good Reforms
that Curly voted for.
His maiden speech (that means his
first) was Anti-Slums and War.
Back benchers wakened up from
sleep as though they sat in front,
And. waving papers, brayed “Hear!
Hear !” at every other grunt.
RIGHTING EVERY WRONG
Yes, Curly kept his promise to Fur
and Feather Town,
And not one citizen could squeak,
“Our Member’s let us down !”
He listened to all grievances, how-
ever dull and long
And (when within his power of
course) he righted every wrong.
And oh, the laws he helped to pass
in just one little year !
His Family Allowance Bill made Fa-
ther Rabbit cheer !
And long will Parliament recall how
Curly raised his snout
And grunted, “As for Tacome Tax,
I vote we CUT IT OUT!”


THE PIG IN PARLIAMENT
When folks were left without a home
they didn’t fret or wail,
They didn’t search advertisements to
find a House for Sale,
They didn’t have to live w r ith friends
or furnished quarters rent,
They simply wrote a letter to the
Pig in Parliament.
And Curly Wee would smile, “A
house ? They’ve only got to ask !”
And with a gentle grunt he’d set
the builders to their task.
(For Parliament had passed a law by
Curly Wee inspired
That houses must be built at once
the moment they’re required !)
TOO NEAT AND CLEAN FOR RATS
Count Curly had the sewers cleared
of all the nasty Rats.
He built them —on an open space—
a block of airy flats.
Mind you, the Rais were not as
pleased as others might have been:
They grumbled. “Ugh ! D’you call
this home ? It’s far too neat and
clean !”)
As for evil Gambling Dens where
Rats were wont to gams,
When Curly Wee had done with
them they didn’t look the same !
No wonder Mr. Fox is cross, and
looks extremely glum
To see instead of “GamDiing Den”
the word “Gymnas-i-um.”


MOUNTAINS TO RE FREE TO ALL
Oh, Curly Wee’s a great M.P. And
all remember still
His speech made in his Access-Free-
to-every-Mountain Bill.
“Why should some Mountains,”
Curly cried, “be owned by Grouse
and Deer ?
I think they should be FREE
TO ALL ! (You should have heard
the cheer i)
The Grojuse and Deer, I’m glad to
say, agreed with Curly Wee.
They pulled each PRIVATE notice
down, and put up ACCESS FREE.
So now to every mountainside the
picnickers can go,
And eat the purple bilberries that
in the heather grow.
CURLY WEE REPAID THE GALLANT THREE
“But what of Mike and Pat ?” you
ask. “And what of Cuthbert C.?
Has Curly Wee forgotten all he owes
that gallant tnree ?
Has he forgotten what they did
upon Election uay ?
When Mr. box's wicKed friends had
smuggled him away ?”
Count Curly Wee forget, Indeed !
How can you be so rude!
To think our Pig should be accused
of base ingratitude !
He gives a watch (pure gold) to
each. And in each lid you see
The words inscribed. “With Grateful
Thanks from Curly Wee, M.P.”
