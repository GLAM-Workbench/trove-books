NEW ZEALAND, &c.
The subject of Emigration has been from year to
year increasing in importance to this country, and
certainly it never was of greater interest and im-
portance than at the present moment. The de-
pressed state of trade and manufactures, and-the
consequent overstocked state of the labour market,
has forced attention to emigration to our extensive
and valuable colonies as a means of relief. Thou-
sands of the labouring classes, unable to find con-
stant employment, or a sufficient reward for their
labour when employed, and of those having small
capital, who find it impossible to use their little
capital with profit in this country, are looking
anxiously to the shores of Canada, and of our
Australasian settlements, as fields where their
labour and their exertions will be duly rewarded.
The purpose of the following work is not to ad-
vise or persuade to emigration. The necessity of
this being extensively resorted to, has become too
apparent to require this; and the benefit to the
sober and industrious emigrant so indisputable, as
no longer to require evidence to establish its truth.
The great benefit likely ultimately to arise to this
country from extensive emigration to her various
colonies is now also generally admitted.
New Zealand consists chiefly of three islands,
called the North, or E?Ahinomauwe in the native
language, Middle Island, or Te Wai Poenenamu,
called by Polack Victoria Island, and South or
Stewart?s Island. North Island and Middle Is-


land are separated from each other by Cook?s
Straits; and Middle Island from South Island by
Foveaux?s Straits. Numerous smaller islands are
scattered around the shores of the larger islands.
They lie in the great Southern or Pacific Ocean,
in an easterly direction from the south-eastern
shores of Australia, from which island-continent
they are distant about 1200 miles, hut they belong
to the same great division of tho'globe, Austra-
lasia. They are about the same distance from the
New Hebrides and the Friendly Islands, about
3000 from the Marquesas, 3600 from the Sand-
wich Islands, about 1800 from South Australia,
5000 from China, and the same distance from
Valparaiso on the coast of South America. The
New Zealand group lie between the 34th and 48th
degrees of south latitude, and the 166 th and 179 th
degrees of east longitude. In fact they are the
lands nearest to the antipodes of Great Britain?
Queen Charlotte?s sound on the southern shore of
Cook?s Straits being only 700 miles from the
Equator. North Island is about 400 miles long,
and varies from sto 30 miles in breadth. Middle
Island is about 500 miles long, and from 100 to
120 in breadth. South Island is but of small ex-
tent, being only about 50 in length, by 30 in
breadth. The two larger islands are estimated to
contain nearly 95,000 square miles, of which about
two-thirds are fit for cultivation. The distance of
New Zealand from Great Britain is rather more
than to New South Wales, or about 16,000 miles.
The line of voyage is the same, round the Cape of
Good Hope, and the return is made by Cape Horn.
The average time occupied by the voyage out, is
6 months.


196. New Zealand was first discovered in 1642 by
Tasman, a Dutch navigator, who, however, did not land,
supposing it to form a part of the southern continent.
Captain Cook first sailed round the islands, and sur-
veyed their shores with so much accuracy, that his
charts are depended upon even to the present day.
These islands are evidently of volcanic origin, there
being many extinct and a few active volcanoes in the
interior. According to Mr Darwin, a naturalist who
visited the islands in the ship Beagle, ?the soil is vol-
canic ; in several parts we passed over slaggy and
vesicular lavas, and the form of a crater could clearly
be distinguished in several of the neighbouring hills.?
Hot springs have also been found, some of which are
described as higher than boiling heat, and most of them
?of a sufficient temperature to cook any kind of native
food. There is one spring of a very remarkable
quality; it is to the touch as soft as oil, and, without
the use of soap or any alkali except what the water
itself contains, will cleanse the dirtiest garments, re-
moving every particle of grease, however sullied they
may be with it.?
197. These islands exhibit every variety of moun-
tain, hill, dale and valley. The principal chain of
mountains runs through a considerable part of the
north island and the whole of the middle island. Some
of these mountains are as high as 14,000 feet above
the level of the sea, their tops being covered with per-
petual snow, and their sides with forest-trees and
luxuriant ferns. Besides this chain of mountains,
there are other subordinate ranges, which for the
most part, are covered with vegetation to the top.
From their volcanic origin, these mountains are
studded with large caves; the diameter of whose
openings was ascertained in some cases to be above
thirty feet. The mountains are all abrupt, and highly
picturesque in appearance, the perpetual snow on the
tops forming a fine contrast to the agreeable climate
and rich vegetation of the valleys below. ? The hill
country in New Zealand,? says Mr Heaphy, who


assisted in surveying the country, ?is at the same
time far from being useless ; it is always preferred by
the natives for their plantations of potatoes and maize,
and yields, by hand labour, a good return. Through-
out the various parts of New Zealand which I have
visited, I have seen but little land, with the exception
of the snowy summits, which would not produce the
vine and olive, as well as in Italy or Switzerland, all
the hills being covered with rich mould, which at pre-
sent gives root to the loftiest forest trees. Between
the mountain ranges the valleys extend parallel with
them; and are generally covered with a soil of alluvial
deposit, which is productive in the extreme.? New
Zealand is probably more similar in character to Scot-
land, than it is to any other European country, being,
like it, mountainous, at the same time that it contains
much beautiful and fertile level land. The geology of
New Zealand is even now but little known ; and it is
impossible to say whether the country contains valu-
able minerals or not. Of the existence of precious
metals, there have been found but few indications.
Copper ore was discovered by Dr Dieffenbach; and,
in many parts of the country, the magnetic sand near
the sides of rivers, proves that the stream has washed
ferreous matter. But these signs cannot be. stated as
indicative of the existence of those metals in quantity.
198. These mountains give rise to a greater num-
ber of streams than appear to exist on the same extent
qf surface in any other country so near to the tropics,
the consequence of which is a perennial vegetation on
the most gigantic scale. Several of the rivers are
navigable to a considerable extent, and possess water-
falls which afford the means of establishing mills in
most parts of the country. From the shape of the
islands, and the mountains which intersect them, the
rivers do not run to any great length, from 100 to 200
miles being the average. In 1838, the ship Pelorus
entered a river in Middle island falling into Cook?s
Straits, and sailed up nearly forty miles, and her boats
continued the navigation for twenty miles farther.


The river Hokianga, in North island, situated almost
opposite the Bay of Islands, has been navigated thirty
miles by vessels of 500 tons burthen. Another river,
the Haritoua, which falls into Port Nicholson, is said
to be navigable for nearly 100 miles. Mr Yates says,
?the River Thames, the mouth of which lies about a
hundred miles from the head of the Bay of Islands, is
a splendid run of water, which from Aotea, or Barrier
Islands, as far as Kopu,?a native fortification just
within the narrows, ?is navigable for vessels of 130
tons burthen.? The Knowsley river, laid down in re-
cent charts, empties itself into Foveaux?s Straits, and is
said to be navigable for large ships. Besides these,
there are numerous streams which cross and intersect
the country in all directions, affording abundant means
for irrigation where this is necessary. The waterfalls,
as affording mechanical power in all parts of the
country, are very important. As specimens, we may
refer to the falls of the Kerikeri. ? The river rolls
over a rock, whose perpendicular height is about
ninety feet.? ? The Waianiwaniwa, a mountain
stream, passes swiftly through a deep ravine, for
nearly the space of a mile, when it joins another
stream, and rolls peaceably on for a few hundred
yards ; the united streams then fall over another rock
about thirty feet high, and then, rushing on to the
Kerikeri settlement, the river again falls ten feet, and
then mingles with the ocean.? ?The Wairoa, another
stream, though not so considerable, falls at least sixty
feet?The Hararu, though not a perpendicular fall,
is a greater current of water than the preceding; it
is rather a succession of rapids, which is the case with
the Hokianga and a great many others. All these
are in the northern island, and are described by Mr
Yates,
199. It will be apparent, from an inspection of
Cook?s chart, in which soundings are given, that, for
the size of it, no country possesses finer harbours, in
greater number, or better situated. ? They are now
generally known from the vast number of whaling and


other vessels which visit all parts of the coast for tim-
ber and flax, and for supplies of fresh provisions.?
Commencing to the northward, the harbour of Wan-
garoa, lying twenty-five miles to the north-east of the
Bay of Islands, is beautiful, romantic, and capacious,
?capable of containing the largest fleet, and of obtain-
ing good anchorage, in from five to eleven fathoms,
completely sheltered from the sea and all winds.?
The Bay of Islands ?properly so called from the
number of islands with which it is studded?is a re-
markably fine and capacious harbour, affording security
for an almost unlimited number of vessels, in all
weathers, and at all seasons of the year. The value
of this harbour is enhanced, from the perfect ease and
safety with which vessels are able to enter it.? Shour-
aki Bay, or the Frith of the Thames, affords excellent
shelter and anchorage, and is navigable for a consider-
able distance. The ? Bay of Plenty? may be con-
sidered an immense roadstead, affording anchorage, to
a great extent, for the purpose of shipping produce,?
having also the advantage of several bays and harbours,
which afford shelter to small vessels. Proceeding to
the south, Poverty Bay?the first place where Cook
landed, accompanied by Banks and Solander, on the
evening of Sunday, October 8, 1769, a day for ever
memorable in the history of these islands?is consider-
ed by that great navigator to be a safe anchorage.
Hawices? Bay is capacious, and affords shelter from
the prevalent winds. Port Nicholson is thus de-
scribed by Mr Heaphy?? On entering Port Nicholson,
one is struck with the grandeur of the view. The
harbour resembles an inland lake rather than an arm
of the sea, and in beauty, certainly far surpasses that
of our English lakes. As we worked up to the
anchorage, the noble expanse of water, surrounded
by a country of the most picturesque character, formed
a scene of indescribable beauty; and as the valley of
the Hutt river opened to our view, apparently ex-
tending far inland until bounded by the snowy range,
we wondered that a place which seemed so much to


invite settlement, had not before been colonized.?
The bay is about twelve miles long and three broad,
perfectly sheltered, and ships may enter or leave with
any wind. The depth of water is from seven to eleven
fathoms, and the whole bay is described as of suffi-
cient capacity to hold a navy. The River Haritoua
falls into this port, the banks of which are high and
well wooded. Port Nicholson has the disadvantage
of being upon a lee shore; but this objection can only
have weight with regard to the navigation of Cook?s
Straits, not to vessels lying in the port itself. The
harbours and bays on the western side of the south
island are numerous; but, owing to the prevalence of
the westerly winds, have not been much frequented,
except that of Hokianga, which, on account of its bar,
is only accessible to vessels of light burthen; but from
its contiguity to the lake Maupero, abounding in fish,
to the Bay nf Islands, and to the harbour of Wan-
garoa, has already become important. The harbours
on the middle island are also numerous and excellent.
In the southern island, within Cook?s Straits, is the
fine harbour of Queen Charlotte?s Sound, which is
nearly thirty miles long. Ship Cove, within this
sound, is a very fine harbour, to which European
vessels have long repaired, in consequence of its having
been described by Captain Cook. The harbour is
perfectly sheltered, and the soundings show ten
fathoms, a cable?s length from the shore. At the
north-western extremity of this island is Cloudy Bay,
which runs fifteen miles inland, and is about four
miles broad. This bay is thought the best station for
the black-whale fishery, and, in consequence, several
Europeans have already settled on its shores. Be-
sides these two harbours, there are many others in
the island, such as Lookers-on Bay, visited by Captain
Cook, Port Gore, Blind Bay, Admiralty Bay, and
others which have not yet been properly surveyed.
200. New Zealand, from the great length to which
it extends north and south, presents considerable
variety of climate. From every account, however, it


appears to be highly salubrious, and most favourable
for British constitutions. Mr Yates says of its cli-
mate?? Those who come here sickly are soon restored
to health ; the healthy become robust, and the robust
fat. North of the Thames snows are unknown ; and
frosts are off the ground by nine o?clock in the morn-
ing. The country, during six months in the year, is
subject to heavy gales from the east and north-east,
which generally last for three days, and are accom-
panied with tremendous falls of rain. These gales
usually commence in the east, and gradually haul
round to the north-west, where they terminate in a
violent gust almost approaching to a hurricane; the
clouds then pass away, and the westerly wind blows
again with some violence. In the winter season the
moon rarely either changes or wanes without raising
one of these tempestuous gales; and during the whole
year the wind is sure to blow, though, it be only for a
few hours, from the east, every full and change of the
moon. The spring and autumn are delightfully tem-
perate, but subject to showers from the west-south-
west. Indeed, however fine the summer may be, we
are frequently visited by refreshing rains, which give
a peculiar richness to the vegetation and fertility of
the land. The prevailing winds are from the south-
west and north-west, which, within this range, blow
upwards of nine months in the year ; more frequently
the wind is due west. During five months, sea-breezes
set in from either coast, and meet each other half-way
across the island.?
201. Colonel Wakefield compares the climate to
that of the north of Portugal; and another writer, Mr
Ward, to ? that of the land lying between the south
of Portugal and the north of France?pervading but
without exceeding the most favoured part of the tem-
perate region; and numerous l witnesses, of ample ex-
perience, concur in describing the extremes of cold in
winter, and heat in summer, as being within peculiarly
narrow limits; which is to describe the climate as one
of the most equable in the world.? Mr Watkins, in


his examination before the Committee of the House
of Lords, on being asked if the vicissitudes appeared
great as compared with the European climates, said?
? Not anything like our climate. The frost was there
at one time, a very gentle frost indeed ?the ice was
not entirely over a small pool of water: they told me
that they saw ice sometimes in the bay the thickness
of a shilling, but I did not see any near that thick-
ness. I have slept out frequently in the bush. The
fern grows in great abundance. I found myself very
comfortable and warm in my greatcoat and a bed of
fern, rather than sleeping in the houses, which are
very unfit for English people.? Augustus Earle says,
? Although we were situated in the same latitude as
Sydney, we found the climate of New Zealand infinite-
ly superior. Moderate heats and beautifully clear
skies succeeded each other every day. We were quite
free from those oppressive heats which in-
variably prevail in the middle of the day at Sydney,
and from those hot pestilential winds which are the ter-
ror of the inhabitants of New South Wales ; nor were
we subject to those long droughts, which are often the
ruin of the Australian farmer. The temperature here
was neither too hot nor too cold, neither too wet nor
too dry.? Mr Cruise, in his ? Ten Months? Residence
in New Zealand,??which period included the whole
of the winter season, but neither of the two finest
months in the year, namely, January and February,
corresponding to July and August with us, and who
kept a record of the indications of the thermometer?
informs us that the lowest degree of heat during his
residence in the islands, (though he does not inform
us at what hour of the day the observations were
made,) was 40�, and that only on three days?the
highest was 78�; another writer informs us, that the
annual range is from 40� to 80�. The climate is not
more healthy than it is pleasant. In the summer sea-
son, which may be said to last for eight months, the
weather is particularly fine, while even then it is
never oppressively hot. The thermometer In the


middle of summer ranges between 65� and 75�, rarely
exceeding the latter, and in winter seldom falls below
40�. It does not appear that there are any diseases
peculiar to the climate of New Zealand : all accounts
agree in describing the inhabitants as a robust and
healthy-looking people. The climate of New Zealand
has a great advantage over that of Australia, in not
being subject to the severe droughts which have so
often there destroyed the hopes of the farmer. Its
insular position, and the great height of its mountains,
ensure a constant supply of rain. This circumstance
alone gives it a decided superiority over Australia, in
an agricultural point of view, rendering it more suit-
able for the growth of grain.
202. In general, throughout these islands, the soil
appears to be excellent, and well adapted for the cul-
tivation of all sorts of grain. ? That the soil,? says
Mr Heaphy, ?is pre-eminently of that nature suitable
for the production of grain, cannot now be doubted,
as the specimens already obtained prove that, with
but little attention being paid to its culture, wheat
especially will thrive. Wheat grown in the valley of
the River Hutt was of the first quality, and has been
pronounced excellent by competent judges in England,
It was grown on rank ground which had just been
cleared, and from being planted in the wrong season,
was not expected to turn out well. For some time,
it was feared that it would run to stalk, from the great
height of the straw ; but with the straw between five
and six feet in height, the ear was in length as many
inches. Oats, also, flourish in Port Nicholson; and
may be seen growing wild in many of the deserted
potato grounds. Of the other kind of grains I have-
met with no specimen in Port Nicholson, but I re-
member having seen before the house of one of the
missionaries, in the Hokianga, country a fine field of
nearly ripe barley, the state of which was fully satis-
factory to the owner. It is certain that before long.
New Zealand will supply the Australian colonies with
wheat; the climate of New Holland not being adapt-


ed for its culture, in consequence of the excessive
drought to which it is liable. The South American
States now export grain and flour to Sydney and Van
Diemen?s Land, but that from New Zealand will, of
course, forestall it in the market, through the smaller
expense of shipment, and by taking the Australian
staple in return.? Mr Yates says?? we have here
almost every variety of soil. Large tracts of good
land, available for the cultivation of wheat, barley,
maize, beans, pease, &c., with extensive valleys of rich
alluvial soil, deposited from the hills and mountains,
and covered with the richest vegetation, which it sup-
ports summer and winter. We have also a deep, rank,
vegetable mould, with a stiff marly subsoil, capable of
being slaked or pulverized with the ashes of the fern.
All English grasses flourish well, but the white clover
never seeds ; and, where the fern has been destroyed,
a strong native grass, something of the nature of the
canary grass, grows in its place, and effectually pre-
vents the fern from springing up again. Every diver-
sity of European fruit and vegetable flourishes in New
Zealand.? Mr Yates then enumerates all the most
important productions of Europe which are raised in
New Zealand, and adds, ? where the rich alluvial
valleys are cultivated, the labourer receives an ample
harvest as the reward of his labour.? Mr Nicholas
says ?the lands,in this country, which are at present
overrun with fern, might be brought to produce
grasses of every description; were the experiment
tried, I doubt not but it would prove invariably suc-
cessful, and that the islands in general would afford as
fine pasturage for sheep and cattle as any part of the
known world.? The experiment has been successfully
tried by the missionaries. Augustus Earle says, ?in
whatever direction I travelled, the soil appeared to bo
fat and rich, and also well watered. From every part
of it which the natives have cultivated the produce
has been immense. Here, where the finest samples
of the human race are to be found, the largest and
finest timber grows, and every vegetable yet planted


thrives; the introduction of the European grasses,
fruits, &c., is a desideratum. Were this done, in a
very short time farms would be sought after more
eagerly than they are in New South Wales. All the
fruits and plants introduced by the missionaries have
succeeded wonderfully. Peaches and water-melons
were now in full season ; the natives brought baskets
full of them to my door every day, which they ex-
changed with us for the merest trifles, such as a,fish-
hook or a button. Indian corn was very abundant,
but the natives had no means of grinding it.
203. Mr Earle saw 100 head of fat cattle at a mis-
sionary station, and was surprised to find, ? that, al-
though they never tasted anything but fern, they gave
as good milk, and were in as healthy a condition as
when they grazed on the rich grasses of Lincolnshire.?
Mr Yates says, in another place, ? the forest land is
peculiarly rich ; indeed, were it not so, it would be
utterly impossible for it to support the immense vege-
tation constantly going on. In spring and summer,
autumn and winter, there is no visible change in the
appearance of the woods; they are as beautiful in
the depth of winter as in the height of summer ; leaves
no sooner fall to the ground than others directly as-
sume their station ; no branch withers from its trunk,
but another, and a more vigorous one puts out in its
stead. The fairest and most tender shrubs shrink not
from the southern blast, nor faint beneath the rays of
the sun, when he rides highest in the heavens.? It
may be briefly mentioned here, that ? the only animals
indigenous to the country are the field-rat and a harm-
less lizard ; there are no snakes, nor any venomous
creatures of any description, large or small.?
204. The forests of New Zealand abound in timber
of gigantic size, peculiarly fitted for naval purposes,
and for house building; and from its workable quality
much more economically convertible and serviceable
than the timber of any other country in the southern
hemisphere, most of which from extreme hardness is
almost unmanageable. In particular, these forests


afford the finest spars for masts and yards in the world;
and the consequence is, that these have now become
one of the staple articles of export. It is impossible
to enumerate all the varieties of timber with which it
is enriched, but a few of them may be mentioned.
205. ? The Kauri or yellow pine has hitherto at-
tracted most attention, and will challenge comparison
for beauty and tapering height, with any forest-tree
known. This tree exudes a large quantity of gum.
The trunk grows to the height of from fifty to nearly
one hundred feet without a branch protruding. The
western coast produces the best timber and largest of
the tribe, from the effect of stormy winds, which have
a serviceable effect in stopping its hasty growth. The
attention of the British government was first called to
the value of the timber of the country by Cook; but
an attempt to procure a cargo was not made until
1820, when the store-ships, * Dromedary and Coro-
mandel,? were sent expressly for this purpose from
England, and a small vessel, the ?Prince Regent,?
from Sydney. It is never regularly applied for in our
dock yards. The spars of this timber contracted to
be furnished by respectable traders in Hokianga and
the river Thames, or Mercury Bay, to the British
government, are required to be in length, from seventy-
four to eighty-four feet long, from twenty-one to
twenty-four inches in diameter, perfectly straight,
without the knots caused by branches interfering, and
ready squared for stowage on board. The Kahikatea
is very similar in outward appearance to the Kauri,
for which it has been often mistaken by strangers.
The name by which it is distinguished is that of white
pine ; it is found in forests, but principally in alluvial
or swampy soils. The timber is very light in colour
and weight, and exceedingly sappy; and the weather
produces on the plank of this tree a barometrical
effect, for after it has been worked up as inside lining
for rooms, for which it is most calculated, it shrinks
and gives with every change of weather, even after
the lapse of years.


206. ? I'anikd/id is a very valuable species of pine,
and extremely serviceable to the shipwright and gen-
eral builder. This wood is hard and tough. Unlike
the preceding tree, it is less affected by change of
season than any other pine in the country; it is seldom
seen beyond the height of fifty feet, with a circum-
ference of twelve feet. It is remarkably durable, but
suffers mueh from worms; when exposed to mud or
water, and perforated like a honeycomb, yet it re-
tained its pristine hardness. It is in mueh
for quarterings, stanchions, and exposed flooring,
such as for ships? decks, verandas, thrashing-floors,
&c. It exudes less gum than others of its tribe, has
less sap, and of a darker hue,
207. ? Totdrd is similar in colour to the former wood,
and is known as the red pine. It grows to the height of
sixty feet, with a circumference often above twenty feet.
The timber is brittle, snapping short, and consequently
splits well into shingles, and is very serviceable to the
builder. This tree is a great favourite among the
natives, especially to the southward of the River
Thames, who make their canoes principally of the
Totara. It flourishes best on the west coast, where
it often grows thirty feet in circumference. It is
found on the banks of rivers of a size so immense as to
give a name to the locality in which perhaps a single
tree only is to be found.
208. ? The Rdtd is an invaluable wood to the ship-
wright. The branches of this tree are twisted in a
natural manner, that form, when dressed, excellent
timbers and knees for the largest ships. It grows to
the height of sixty feet, and the head and branches
extend very far; the wood is close grained and stringy,
and when polished, of a deep mahogany red?the grain
is remarkably handsome, and well fitted for furni-
ture.
209. The Pohutokaua or Potikaioa is the hardi-
est of timber-trees, and is found jutting out in im-
mense crooked limbs from every nook, however craggy,
or exposed rocky headlands on the sea-side, and often


surprises the traveller, that so many cubical feet of
heavy timber can be attached to its station, with the
extremely scanty proportion of soil around its stem.
It is well adapted for ship timbers, is crooked, close
grained, brittle, tough, and of a deep brown colour.
It is difficult to work up by the joiner, for its extreme
hardness, but when polished, forms a beautiful and
durable article for furniture.
210. ? The Puriri is a wood whose durability equals
an}' of the timbers in the country; it is very tough
and close grained, and has been termed the Oak of the
Pacific; but the Teak would be more appropriate, as
its properties more resemble the latter w'ood; as
similar to that eastern production, it does not lessen
in value by lying exposed in salt water; it is equally
hard, and of a pale olive colour. This wood has been
taken out of a river, where it had been used as a stake
to fasten canoes, for perhaps upwards of twenty years,
and found to be in no degree affected by the immer-
sion or by worms.
211. ? The Jlimu is one of the most graceful trees
of the country. The w r ood is tough and brittle; the
grain is very beautiful when polished, and will be
much admired by future connoisseurs in ornamental
woods.
212. ? The Kaihatod is remarkably hard and dur-
able, and through the country is an especial favourite
with the natives, who make their spears, paddles,
fishing-rods, &c., of this useful timber. It has an
oleaginous moisture, scarcely any sap, and similar in
colour to our oak.
213. ? The Kaikatoa, in the middle island of Vic-
toria, grows often to the height of fifty feet, the tem-
perature being more agreeable to this hardy tree. A
very similar w'ood exists to the southw?ard, called
Jiohilo, of which carved boxes, for holding small
trinkets and feathers, are made by the people.
214. ? The Hinou is a handsome tree. Its plank
is very frangible on exposure to the sun or air. It is
in much request by the native tribes, who make use of


the bark for dyeing jet black the threads of the rriuka
or dressed flax, of which they either wholly make, or
interweave with, their superior garments. The bark,
which is easily pulverized, is kept some time immersed
in water, and this infusion forms the dye. The leaves
terminate in a point, and in colour are of a deep green.
213. ? Towd or Taua, is a useful timber for board-
ing the interior of houses; and though entirely differ-
ing in genus or outward appearance from the Kahi-
katea, is of a similar shortlived service to that wood.
It attains a large size?its branches are irregular?
leaves pointed, and the colour of chrysolite?it cuts
easily
216. ? Mairi Maidi, is the closest grained and
toughest of woods in the country. It is found to grow'
largest on the west coast, where it attains the height
of sixty feet. It is extremely durable, and so very
hard as to turn the edge of the tools applied to it.
Besides these there is a great variety of other useful
and elegant timber throughout the forests.?
217. The next great staple of the country is the
native or indigenous flax, or Phormium Tenax , which
grow's in great plenty throughout the country. It is
found most abundant in the vicinity of swamps. There
is a variety of the species?principally caused by
climate and soil?some flax-plants, to the northward,
scarcely attaining the height of six feet; others, to the
southward, attain the height of sixteen feet. Sir
Joseph Banks was the first discoverer of this staple,
and says?? A plant, which, with such advantages,
might be applied to so many useful and important
purposes, would certainly be a great acquisition to
England, where it would probably thrive with very
little trouble, as it seems to be hardy, and to affect no
particular soil, being found equally in hill and valley,
in the driest mould, and the deepest bogs.? From
the experiments of M. Labillardidre, the strength
of the fibre of this plant, as compared with that of the
Agave Americana , flax, hemp, and silk, is as fol-
lows;


The fibre of the Agave breaks under a weight of 7
~ Flax 1) ? 11^
? Phormium ~ ~ 23 7-11
? Silk ~ ~ 24
Thus, it appears of all vegetable fibres, the phor-
mium is the strongest. It possesses this advantage
over the hemp and flax, that it is of a brilliant white-
ness, which gives it a satiny appearance ; so that the
clothes made of it do not need to be bleached by a
tedious process, or through those other means by
which flax is injured. Flax is prepared in New
Zealand by the females and slaves. Simple as appears
the native mode of separating the flax from the leaf by
a shell, the European has not succeeded in his endeav-
ours to prepare the fibre for himself, either by that,
or any other means that have been tried ; nor has any
instrument or piece of machinery yet been invented
to enable him to strip off and prepare this valuable
filament for the English market. The Port Jackson
traders must still be dependent on the native women
and their shells for the cargoes they obtain. The flax
thus obtained by the merchants of Sydney undergoes
no heckling, cleaning, or other preparation, previously
to its being shipped for the English market; but is
merely made into bales, by being put into a press and
screwed down. It is subsequently manufactured into
every species of cordage, excepting cables, and its
superiority of strength to the hemp of the Baltic has
been attested both by experiments made at Sydney,
and in the Queen?s yards at Deptford. The phormium
has been in use for many years past, made up into
tacks, sheets, braces, stays, &c., and its superiority in
bearing a great strain over hemp has been well at-
tested. Were mills erected for the preparation of
the flax, as there is abundant water-power to propel
them, it would prove an incalculable source of riches
to those engaged in its cultivation.
218. The whale fishing is another source of profit-
able industry for which New Zealand is most eligibly


situated. Even before the British government had
taken possession of this colony, the number of ship-
ping engaged in whale-fishing that entered the Bay of
Islands annually, was 160. This trade, however, has
hitherto been pursued to a great extent by French
and American whalers; but as New Zealand becomes
colonized, there can be little doubt that it will be pro-
secuted to a greater extent by the British than has
hitherto been done.
219. Various settlers had located themselves around
the Bay of Islands, and a missionary station existed
there long before the British government formally took
possession of the country. At length, in 1840, the
attention of government having been called to the
value of New Zealand as a British colony, Captain
Hobson, R.N. was sent out as lieutenant-governor,
and by him Ackland, the capital, was founded. It is
situated on the west coast of the North Island, oppo-
site to the Bay of Islands. The other settlements which
have been made are Wellington, at Port Nicholson,
in Cook?s Straits, New Plymouth, at Taranakie, on
the west coast, both on North Island, and Nelson, at
Blind, or Tasman?s Bay, on the Middle Island, at the
entrance of Cook?s Straits. These settlements, with
the exception of the capital, are all within the district
belonging to the New Zealand Land Company. The
progress of these settlements has been retarded by
the unfortunate disputes which have taken place be-
tween the settlers and Governor Hobson, and between
the New Zealand Land Company and the British
government; still, notwithstanding, their progress has
been very great, and all that is wanting to render
New Zealand one of the most flourishing of the British
colonies, is a continued flow of the tide of emigration,
especially of emigrants of the labouring class.
220. Up to the end of the year 1840, the New Zea-
land Company had despatched 19 ships to Welling-
ton, its first and principal settlement, carrying out 341
cabin passengers, and 2061 emigrants of the labouring


class.* A ship had also been despatched to the set-
tlement of New Plymouth,f with 14 cabin passengers,
and 148 labouring emigrants. This settlement is
situated in the fertile district of Taranakie, on the west
coast of the North Island; and a number of the Wel-
lington people having formed a location in the Waga-
nui district, lower down the coast, there appears no
doubt that the progress of the settlement will rapidly
spread, so as to embrace the whole line of the western
coast, as well as Cook?s Straits. This has been ma-
terially facilitated by the formation of a road from
Wellington to a place called Porirua, whence the
country is practicable for the whole distance to Wa-
ganui, for cattle.
221. In the early part of the year, the Company
determined on forming another settlement, to be
called Nelson. A number of persons left England
in a body for Nelson, in the autumn, and the total
number gone to that settlement is 1736, including 148
cabin passengers. A steady succession of emigrant
ships, also, was kept up by the Company during the
whole of the year to Wellington and New Plymouth,
with 163 cabin passengers, and 2046 labouring emi-
grants; so that, up to 1842, 43 ships, conveying alto-
gether 667 cabin passengers, and 5843 emigrants of
the labouring class, making a total of 6510 persons,
have been sent out by the Company to their different
settlements; and if we add to this number the immi-
grants who are said to have arrived from the neigh-
bouring colonies, we can scarcely fix the white popu-
lation of the Company?s settlements at less than 7500.
222. Wellington, the principal settlement formed
by the Company, has made rapid progress in pros-
perity and wealth. Colonel Wakefield, in one of his
published despatches, dated the 20th February, 1842,
says, ?
* These details, as well as others following, are extracted from do-
cuments published by the New Zealand Company.
t The formation of this settlement was originally undertaken by a
Company under the name of the ? Plymouth Company of New Zea.
land,? since merged in the New Zealand Company.


? Let us now glance at our present state and future
prospects. These I cannot but regard as in a high
degree satisfactory. It is established, almost without
doubt, that the north side of Cook?s Straits will be co-
lonized by Englishmen, in immediate connexion with
the Company. A considerable number of settlers are
already at Wanganui, preparing to select the land
which has been surveyed for them with praiseworthy
despatch, and which will be open for selection in a few
days. Large reinforcements to their number may now
be daily expected.
? Proceeding higher up the Straits, we find the
foundation of New Plymouth already laid in the vast
and fertile district of Taranakie. The surveyor-general
of the Plymouth Company, with assistants, is employ-
ed in marking out the site of the future city. From
Taranakie and Wanganui immense supplies of agricul-
tural produce and of flax will be conveyed to Port
Nicholson, and the fisheries on the coast will also be-
come the source of much profitable employment. In
anticipation of a large coasting-trade, numerous small
vessels are now building in the various harbours and
inlets on both sides of the Straits.
? It i$ impossible to overrate the value of flax as a
staple article of commerce; and the only impediment
to the introduction of the phormium tenax, into Eu-
rope and America, has been removed by the discovery
of a cheap method of preparing large quantities for
export, in reduced bulk, and without injury to the
fibre. A short time only will elapse before our set-
tlement will provide a profitable return-cargo for the
foreign vessels visiting Cook?s Straits. Already, and
before the agricultural resources of the settlement
have had time for development, the shipping belonging
to Port Nicholson has become worth 5000/.; and this
is almost exclusively employed in bringing pigs and
potatoes, in return for blankets, guns, and other arti-
cles sought after by the natives.
? The houses erected in Wellington have cost at
least 18,000/.; and the merchandise and provisions now


in the place may be safely put down at not less than
200,000/. In every direction large stores and private
buildings are springing up. Within a few weeks,
measures have been in progress for the erection of a large
steam saw and flour mill, brought from England by
Messrs Hopper, Petre, and Molesworth. A company
is formed with sufficient capital to carry on the busi-
ness ; and ships, not full of flax and oil, will be sup-
plied with sawn timber for home consumption, and for
the neighbouring colonics of New South Wales and
Van Diemen?s Land.?
?My confidence in the success of this settlement,
rests in no slight degree on the vigour with which
many gentlemen arc now employed in raising stock,
and in farming operations. Even inferior land has pro-
duced some excellent wheat and barley, whilst some
of that grown on the banks of the Hutt is the finest I
ever saw. The importation of cattle from New South
Wales supplies us with the means of increasing the
best breeds.?
? All that has been said or written of the extraor-
dinary healthiness of this place, has been borne out
by experience. I believe that every temperate and
well-conducted person in the colony, is entirely free
from disease of every description.?
223. Previous to Mr Petre?s departure for England,
the settlers had had under their consideration the best
means of cultivating the phormium tenax: a reward
had been offered for the invention of a suitable machine
for the preparation of the plant, and a considerable
subscription entered into for that object. Mr Petre
says,?
? The production which I think is likely to yield a
larger profit than any other, and is therefore better
calculated to engage the attention of the colonists, is
the phormium tenax , or New Zealand flax.
? This plant grows in great abundance in every part
of New Zealand. No soil seems to be unsuited to it;
but as there are several varieties of this indigenous
plant, it yet remains to be ascertained which is the


best species, and on what soils it may be most benefi-
cially grown. Formerly tbe phormium tennx was ex-
tensively cultivated by the natives; but at this time
all that is gathered grows spontaneously. The best
kinds flourish at Port Nicholson, at that part of the
Taranakie district which has been chosen for the New
Plymouth settlement, and, it is said, around Hawke?s
Hay. Taranakie formerly yielded the largest quantity
for exportation ; but the natives abandoned that part
of the country some years since for Port Nicholson,
where they occupied the place of the original inha-
bitants, who emigrated to the Chatham Islands.?

224. The following letters from Mr Perry, late of
Glasgow, to his father, Dr Perry, will give a better
idea of the state of the principal settlement, that at
Wellington, than anything which could be said upon
the subject;?
? Wellington, 3d January, 1842.
? My Dear Friend, ? I have never been able until
now to command time enough to reply to your kind
letter. You cannot conceive how cheering it is at this
distance to receive a communication from a friend. Mr
W. did quite right, having a saw-mill, to leave this.
There is none of the Cowrie pine here, which is the
only wood yet exported; and, although every hill and
valley is thickly clothed with timber, owing to the
rugged nature of the country, and the want of large
navigable rivers to float it down, persons clearing land
are obliged to burn and destroy the most splendid tim-
ber, wdiich, could they manage to get it to the sea,
would pay them well, so that there is scarcely enough
cut here to serve the local consumpt; and we often
can buy imported seasoned timber cheaper than that
raised here.
? The country is much intersected with hills and deep
gullies; they are unlike the hills of any other country.
They do not run regularly in ranges, but are scattered


about, and those that do run in ranges are divided by
deep indentations, and, in the sides, almost into separ-
ate hills, merely connected by a ridge at the top,
along which the Maoris (or natives) form their foot-
paths, thereby avoiding all the gullies. The valleys,
too, are, in general, small and isolated, which will
make the expense of roads to each very heavy. I
have only had time to make one excursion into the
country?for one sees nothing of it here but the pre-
cipitous ends of hills running down into the bay, like
the gable ends of so many houses, and the flat at one end
of the bay, on which the town is built, and the valley
of the Hutt at the other, stretching away to the high
mountains in the interior, which are often covered
with snow. The day was very fine, and Mr J. and a
number more of us set off, early in the morning, to go
to a valley called the Makara, which had lately been
surveyed and given out. Our way (for road there -was
none, except a Maori footpath, or a surveyor?s line,
cut through the bush), lay through Yuill?s section in
the Karori district. We had tea in their cottage, and
they accompanied us on the day?s excursion. The
Karori district, as far as I saw of it, is perfectly level,
and thickly covered with timber of a most gigantic
growth?the trees towering as straight as an arrow to
their very top, with few branches. It is situated on a
higher level than the Makara, which is of quite a dif-
ferent character, being covered with low brushwood
much more easily cleared. The soil, too, seems to be
richer, with more vegetable matter and less clay, than
the Karori, and would raise every plant cultivated at
home, and many which we never see but in the green-
house. Every one declared it was the finest soil they
ever saw. In these valleys the wind, which blows
with so much violence in the bay, is scarcely felt. It
would be a beautiful place for growing fruit, surpassing
even the banks of the Clyde from Hamilton to Lanark;
and did any one go there with a little capital (espe-
cially a man with a good active family), they could
soon raise everything they would require; but it will


be a long time, I am afraid, before they can get a road
to convey their produce to market. New Zealand is
a strange country in that respect?where you find a
good harbour, you have no - cxtent of land whose pro-
duce can be easily brought to market; and where you
find the largest extent of available land you have no
harbour.
? Here, in consequence of the small quantity of avail-
able land in the immediate neighbourhood of the town,
many people are living about as regardless of agricul-
ture as if they were in a large town at home; in this
way many who came out with a little capital have
spent their all; there is a good deal, however, of clear-
ing going on about the Hutt, and the land, judging
from the crops, is of the greatest fertility. If there is
any failure of the crops, it will be from over-luxurious-
ncss, the grain has stooled so much; onc-fourth of the
seed required at home will do here. In a walk of a
few miles up the banks of the river Hutt we w r ere
quite delighted. The trees are of immense size on the
uncleared parts, and very thick set. Wc could not help
looking back on Wellington, and, seeing the improve-
ments going on around, thinking here they are doing
something substantial for their living. There they are
living one upon another. We dined with S , who
came out with us; he lives with his cousin, who saw's
timber. We drank tea with Dr L ;he seems
pretty comfortable, and is as sanguine as ever about
the country, although he is getting very frail and can
do little. I spent New-year?s-day with Mr S ;
we had a pleasant party, and most excellent hotch-
potch made by Mrs S , as good as ever we had
at home; they are very kind, and would have me of-
tener than I can spare time. The people here are
unfortunately divided into two parties, called the Com-
pany?s and Governor?s; the one blames the Company
for everything wrong, and the other the Governor,
not always with right judgment. You will see by the
newspapers I have sent the result of the inquiry into
the circumstances of Milne?s murder; it is said little


doubt rests with those who were on the inquest but
that it was perpetrated by a native, yet the authori-
ties seem afraid to apprehend him for fear of offend-
ing the rest, although I believe nothing is to be appre-
hended from them, as they neither, as a body, approve
of the deed, nor would interfere to prevent him being
punished, if found guilty. The whalers and others who
know them best laugh at the cowardliness of the autho-
rities, and say, that, if any one of them were desired,
they would apprehend the suspected native amongst
five hundred. They are perfectly aware of the power
of the law, and always, when wronged or assaulted by
Europeans, claim its protection; as for fighting and
quarrelling with one another in the same tribe that
is what you never see; they live in their pahs like one
family, having all things in common, and come nearer
to Owen?s idea of Socialism than any other people I
know of; they are a very good-natured people, great
mimics, and have a keen perception of the ludicrous;
the young children are the best behaved of any I ever
saw; you seldom hear them crying or squalling like
European children; they repose quite peaceably on
the backs of their parents, covered with their mat or
blanket. Many of the natives have great quantities of
European clothing, but they seldom wear it, preferring
their mats or blankets. I have seen Warepori one
day dressed in a fine suit of blue clothes, trousers,
waistcoat, and surtout, and the next day with nothing
but a blanket, and I confess I like him better in the
latter than in the former dress. Their seriousness and
attention whilst in church is most remarkable, and du-
ring the time of prayer every one?s head is buried in
his blanket; many of them can read and write. They
are a most shrewd people, and the veriest Jews alive
in their dealings. When they adopt our customs, and
turn their attention to business, the Europeans will
have no chance with them. Few of them act as ser-
vants to the whites here. They stay altogether in
their pahs and cultivate potatoes, catch fish, &c.,
which they sell for their own benefit. In the middle


island it is said they are more serviceable to the Euro-
peans, and have adopted more of their customs, living
in houses and wearing European clothing, and instead
of the native canoe they have well appointed whale
boats. Although not Christians, they seem to be more
civilized than those here, from the fewer number of
themselves, and the greater number of whalers settled
amongst them. Their language is much different
from that spoken here, so that those who understand
the one often do not understand the other. The cli-
mate of the middle island nearly equals this, and sur-
passes that of Port Nicholson in one respect, which,
from its position, is the most variable in New Zealand.
Have the New Zealand Company an agent in Glas-
gow? Are the Company?s means to be squandered
in sending out unfit people from the large towns of
England, when plenty of emigrants of the best class
could be got from the country districts of Scotland?
? Monday, 24 th January. ?This has been a most
joyous and merry day to the settlers, the 2d anniver-
sary of the first settlement, warm, the sun brilliant,
with a gentle breeze. The turn-out of people was
surprising. I am certain there were upwards of two
thousand collected on the flat to witness the different
sports of the day?boat-racing, horse-racing, hurdles,
&c. The natives joined in the sports; of all the sights
and sports what pleased me most was the horticultural
exhibition. It was truly gratifying to see such splen-
did vegetables raised in a colony of such short stand-
ing, and reminded me of the passage in Numbers
describing the return of the spies, with specimens of
the produce of the land of promise. I left the rifle-
shooting, pole-climbing, &c., &c., and went on board
of the Fifeshire, arrived from London, to make in-
quiry about a young man who had been asking about
me, expecting to hear some news from home, but
missed him. I have got off from the evening party,
and am occupying the time in writing you, but 1 must
to bed; so good night, wishing you many happy re-
turns of the season. ?I am, &c., ? A. Perry.?


? Wellington, 10 th Feb, 1842.
225. ?Dear Father, ?On the 7th, the Auckland
arrived and brought me letters and papers from home,
which, you may be sure, have proved a great treat. I
am happy to see you continue all well. Mr Imric has
gone from Wanganui to Nelson, and writes me in high
spirits about that settlement, but 1 expect him here
again soon.
? Notwithstanding the rage for Nelson, and the gen-
eral agreement as to the seeming extent of available
and flat land in the neighbourhood, and the snugness
of its harbour, I am inclined, from all I have learned,
to think that Port Levi, or Port Couper, which the
Company would have gone to in preference, had they
not been hindered by the Governor, would have been
a more eligible place. These are two ports on the
north of Bank?s Peninsula, separated from each other
merely by a headland, forming a sort of angle. They
run up until they nearly meet. Port Couper is the
largest and most sheltered.
? None should come out to this colony without capi-
tal, except as labourers, and the two ought always to go
together. It is worse than folly to send out labourers
without capital to employ them. It should not, there-
fore, be undertaken by government. Much of the land
here is owned by absentee proprietors, who expend
no capital upon it. This is a great evil to a colony, as
small capitalists, who wish to become farmers, arc
unwilling to lease land when they can buy it out and
out at a cheap rate, and clear it as their capital in-
creases.
? I have thus sketched out a scheme of emigration,
and urged the occupation of Port Couper by a Scottish
Company, because I think it would be of immense
benefit to both countries, and this is probably the last
and best opportunity a Scottish Company will have.
It is a good thing to secure a good harbour. Look at
thePlymouthCompany?ssettlementatTaranakie,which,
although located in confessedly the finest agricultural
district in New Zealand, yet, from want of a port,


will be many years before it does any good. A vessel
could, on an average, run down to Port Cooper as
soon, if not sooner, than she could enter this port, and
be snugger when she is in. A newspaper, bank, and
other companies, would require to be established from
the very commencement of the settlement. These the
directors could keep in their own hands. They would
be a profitable way of investing any capital they might
choose to advance. Your last letter was written in
autumn, and you complain of the coldness and wetness of
the weather. This is written in our autumn, and if one
could think about complaining of such delightful weather
as we have had for some time past, it would be that it
was too dry and warm. What crops have been har-
vested have been got in, in the finest condition, without
a shower. I saw a crop of oats which was beginning to
ripen (before Colonel Wakefield?s house, in one of the
most exposed situations here), before it was cut down
for cattle, sending up a second vigorous growth from the
same roots; indeed, I believe both wheat and oats
turn perennial in most parts of the country after they
have been once sown. What I have admired most in
the weather lately is the cessation of the high winds
which generally prevail, and which, were they to con-
tinue to blow as they sometimes do, would shake and
scatter the ripened grain. But it seems wisely ordered
by Providence that they should cease about this time, and
that the weather should be dry and warm, in order to
allow the crops to be secured in good condition. What
shows that this is the usual weather we may expect
about this time is, that the Maoris wait till this time
to burn the trees they have cut down in clearing the
land. There is just as much rain as is required to bring
forward the crops, after which it clears up, and the
sun shines in an unclouded sky of ethereal blue. If
we had just a country with as much level available
land as Great Britain, and such a climate as this, it
would be the first in the world; but nothing here be-
low is perfect, Providence having wisely balanced
the advantages which one country or one situation has


over another, by countervailing' disadvantages, so as to
call forth our faculties into exercise. I have just now
got a letter from my friend Mr Imrie at Nelson. He
is quite in raptures with it, and says he feels confident,
from what he has seen, that it will become one of the
most flourishing settlements in New Zealand, and you
know he is not one of the most sanguine. Should the
middle island be colonized, the seat of government
must be changed. The governor, in the new Muni-
cipal Bill, has given universal suffrage in the election
of councillors. But I must close this, and believe me,
dear Father, yours.
? A. Perry."
?April, 1842.
226. ? I think the climate even here, although from
its situation and exposure, not nearly so good as that of
other parts of the island, is delightful; and were it not
for the high winds which prevail as much, I am told,
in summer as in winter, would be unexceptionable,
otherwise the weather is most excellent. Enough of
rain, succeeded by warmth and sunshine, vegetables
of all sorts, and animals, grow and thrive surprisingly;
indeed, I think they are in general more indebted to
the climate than the soil, for you see vegetables grow-
ing luxuriantly amongst mere sand and gravel, which
at home would produce nothing.
? Before the house in which I lodge, there is a little
plot of ground about 17 yards long, by 13 broad,
which supplies us with as many vegetables as we re-
quire, so that we have very frequently broth. We
have always a new crop of pease, turnips, and cab-
bages, coming forward in succession to supply the
place of those we are using. Mr Imrie has taken the
whole charge of it, and it is certainly one of the best
kept little gardens in the colony. I content myself
with showing a proper appreciation of Mr Imrie's
labours, by consuming the fruits of them.
? Many in passing stop and look into it, and two or
three of tnc newly arrived immigrants have come in and


requested to be allowed to pluck a piece of the mig-
nonette which lines the walk from the road to the
house, and which, in the morning and evening, sends
forth a delicious perfume.
? We have also some Indian corn which is thriving
well, and beginning to send forth ears. By the time
you come out we may, perhaps, also be able to give
you a bunch of grapes from the same garden, as Mr
Imrie has planted a vine on each side of the door.
Colonel Wakefield, and others, had a quantity of ripe
cherries in their gardens this year, and I have seen
beautiful apples grown up the Hutt. I have no doubt
the fig would thrive well if planted, so that in a few
years one might ? sit under their own vine and fig-
tree, no one daring to make them afraid," in a land
where, a few years since, one was thought to run the
risk of their life even to land, amongst what was then
esteemed the most ferocious of cannibals. But the
New Zealanders may say, tempora mutantur et nos
mutamur in tilts, for they are now a quiet, peaceable,
good-natured, well-behaved, pork-and-potatoe-eating
race of savages, ?if you will, although I think many
at home are more deserving of the appellation. They
are perfectly aware of all that is going on around
them, and are much better acquainted with their own
country, and its productions, than most Europeans are
with theirs. They can give you a name for every
plant in the country. The house in which I now
write is built upon what was formerly the site of one
of their pahs or village, called Kumo toti, the chiefs
name is Etako; he and his family, which consists of all
his relations, and a number of cookees, there may be
about 20 or 30 of them altogether. He lives in a house
built after the European style, just one remove from
where I reside. 1 wish all our other neighbours
were as quiet and well behaved as he. Etako himself
is a most gentlemanly fellow.
?As to the healthiness of the climate?l lodge next
door to a young gentleman who came out, attended
by a brother, for the benefit of his health, apparently


in a deep decline, and who is now going about quite
recovered. I think we shall get many to reside here
insteafl of going home from India and China. And
they will have all the advantage of a change of climate
without having to undergo the severe winter which is
so trying at home. Here the winter, according to
those who have experienced it long, although colder
and wetter, upon the. whole, is as good as the sum-
mer, the weather is more equal, and not so stormy
inland. At the Manewatu, for instance, where Mr
J. has a fine section, the climate is described by
all who have been there, as much superior to this, al-
though even this, I believe, in w?inter, is superior to
what you usually have in the finest summers at home.
No frost or snow, and none of that continual drizzle
for weeks together, more disagreeable than either. It
rains heavily for a day or two, and then clears up for,
perhaps, a week. In summer, although as hot in the
day-time, as you have it at home, I have never been
so incommoded by it at night, but that I could enjoy
the warmth of a blanket.
? Farming here requires a great deal of capital, from
the thickly wooded nature of the country; but the
chief drawback is the want of roads on which to con-
vey the produce raised, to market. These will not be
easily formed, from the hilly or rather mountainous
character of the country; however, I am in hopes that
something will be done to remedy this deficiency. A
great number of the labourers who have lately come
out, will not, I am afraid, get employment for some
time, from private individuals; and till once they are
so employed, the company will have to give work,
and pay them for making roads or other improve-
ments for the benefit of the country ?the great want
now is capital, not labour, of which there is abundance.
It is men with some capital, who have a knowledge
of, and are fit for, country work, that are wanted. Had
those who came out been generally of that description
the colony would have been much farther advanced
than it is to-day. Mr R has fallen into the error


which many commit who come out with the intention
of engaging in other than mercantile pursuits, of
bringing out a good deal of money in goods, such as
agricultural implements, which he finds will be of no
use for himself or any other body for years, and for
which he will never get cost price, besides locking up
his money which he might be turning to better account.
He has put all his things into my store for me to sell
them. I would advise no one, except he means to
engage in business, to bring out his money in goods,
and even then he would require to have a varied and
judiciously selected stock until he once knew the nature
of the market. Twelve months? supply of good com-
mon clothes is all that one, not going into business,
need bring, and a small assortment of the most com-
mon and useful tools; fine clothes, or large lots of
seeds, and ironmongery, are of no use, and have often
to be parted with at a sacrifice. Mr R , now
that he has got his things ashore, will immediately go
into the bush, and commence clearing one of his sec-
tions. And B intends setting out next week to
see his land at Wanganui, where, if he finds he cannot
get possession of it without being disturbed by the
natives, who have been lately annoying the settlers
there, he will either return to this, or go to Sydney and
purchase some sheep and cattle, and commence grazing.
Hence, nothing will yield a surer or more profitable
return; indeed, that and dairy farming are just now,
and likely to continue to be, for a long time, the most
profitable and sure way in the colony of investing
money. As long as beef and mutton continue at Is.
per lb., and butter at 3s. Gd,, those who invest their
capital in cattle must make a splendid thing of it, even
if prices should fall a half, which will not happen for
years. M?Donald, who came out in the Blenheim
with the Highlanders, sold, the other day, a lot of
young cows (he purchased 3 or 4 months since, at
14/. each,) and cleared nearly 10/. a-head on the lot;
and sheep which can be purchased in Australia for
125., and which will bring, when imported here, from


20.5. to 255., are sold to the butchers after fatten-
ingl for a short time, at two guineas a-head, and the
butchers are obliged to go, and probably lose a day in
catching them, so that I cannot see but if Mr B
conducts himself well he will make money, provided,
as I said before, he ?is not annoyed by the natives,
who now, that a good deal of the land is giving out,
are preventing settlers from locating themselves on
their sections, saying they have never got paid by the
company for the land.? The other day Rangehaiti, a
chief, who has all along been hostile to the whites
settling on his land, came with a band of followers,
and totally demolished some houses which some newly
arrived emigrants had erected at Porirua, about 8 or
10 miles from this. You will see by the papers, we
have had a meeting upon the subject, and passed a re-
solution calling upon the sheriff to issue his warrants
for his apprehension, in pursuance of an indictment
which has been filed against him, and offering to turn
out to his assistance if he thought the force at his dis-
posal insufficient ?but how it will end I don?t Jcnow.
There is no fear of the natives if they are firmly and
promptly dealt with, but the authorities seem neither to
have the power nor the inclination so to deal with them.
Although four-fifths of the European population are
now settled along Cook?s straits, we have not a soldier
in case of need, the whole force being kept at Auck-
land, ? the proclamation capital,? as the editor of the
Gazette calls it, 400 miles off. From the neglect with
which this settlement has been treated, and the tardy
extension to it of the benefits of law and government,
one would almost be inclined to suppose with Dr
Evans, the Auckland authorities were trying the solu-
tion of the problem, at how little expense, and with
how small a degree of protection, and encouragement,
a community can be kept together in a taxable form.
At Wanganui the settlers cannot go on their land for
fear of the natives, which will be the case until they
are in sufficient numbers to overcome them, or are
supported by the government. Although the company


had not fairly paid them, which I believe is not the
case, they will be making fresh demands for hute, or
payment, as their land rises in value by the influx of
Europeans, unless restrained by the idea of a superior
force. Now that the lands of the company are held
like others from the government, it is surely its duty
to see that the company have fairly extinguished the
native title, and that settlers holding from them are
allowed quietly to go on their land without molesta-
tion. People have enough to contend with in the
hilly nature, and thickly timbered character of the
country, and above all, in the want of roads, without
being obliged to maintain their title to their land by
force of arms against the natives. I hope Commis-
sioner Spaine, who has arrived to-day in the govern-
ment brig, from Auckland, to investigate the land
claims, will settle this question. But, as I formerly
said, there is not much to be apprehended from the
natives; they are well aware of the advantages they
derive from the colonists, although they are good cus-
tomers to the shop-keepers, and have hitherto been of
the greatest service in furnishing a supply of pigs and
potatoes, yet they are not much employed by the
settlers as labourers?you cannot depend upon them?
they may work well for a short time, but they have no
idea of continuing at it with the perseverance of a
European. They are more lazy, or rather, their wants
are fewer and more easily supplied. It is different
with the settlers round the coast. There European la-
bour is not to be had, and they employ the natives, and
get them to do a great deal more for them, and have
a greater command over them than we have here,
where, you may say, they only work for their own
benefit. The natives and the settlers here have
hitherto been on the best terms?people are continu-
ally travelling about amongst them, from one district
to another, trading and bartering with them, and are
not only not molested, but treated most kindly, and
always made welcome to a share of what they have.
In those parts where there are none or few European


inhabitants, pork, potatoes, and fish, are very plenti-
ful and cheap, so that a person can live at little or no
expense, but it is different here, where the presence
of so many people makes every sort of provisions very
dear. Fresh pork is B d., mutton Is., bread Is. 4 d.,
the 4 lb. loaf; raw sugar Qd. to 7 d.; tea varies according
to the supply, from 4s. Qd. to Bs.; cheese, from 2s. to
2s. 6c/.; and salt-butter, from 2s. 3d. to 2s. B d.; fresh
do., 3s. Qd.; and other things in proportion, so that
the expense of living comes high.
? Wages are proportionally high, ss. a-day for a
common labourer, 10s. for carpenters, and other skilled
workmen. One would imagine that, in such a coun-
try, enjoying such a climate, and soil, farming would
be a sure and profitable undertaking, but the labour
required to be employed before one can prepare the
ground for a crop, comes so expensive that very few
can afford it.
? The country is so thickly wooded that it takes 20/.
or 30/. per acre to clear it, but even that expense
will be returned with a profit by the first crop. It is
as cheap, and ultimately is much more profitable, to
cultivate such thickly wooded land, rather than fern
land, with which all the unwooded land is covered;
The fern is generally found growing either on exposed
situations, or on very poor land. It impoverishes the
land so much, and is so difficult to extirpate, requiring
to be so often ploughed and harrowed, that the expense
necessary to be incurred is little less than on wooded
land, and the return is neither so sure nor so profit-
able; you will see by this that it requires a consider-
able capital to commence cultivating even a few acres.
Independent of the expenditure for labour, one would
require to have as much as maintain himself for 12
months, till once his crops come forward.
? The loss is, we have very few who can afford to do
that, and many of those who could are afraid to begin,
being quite unacquainted with agriculture, having
been brought up all their days in large towns. What
we want is an importation of bien farmers, with grown


up working families, from Ayrshire, or the Lothians,?
they would soon become wealthy. Were a number
of such to come out and set a proper example, and the
government or company at the same time to assist
them in opening up the country by making roads, I
have no fear but the colony would come on quickly.
It is a country of great resources, were these devel-
oped, capable of supporting a very large population.
Every day is discovering fresh tracts of land which
were before unknown. The country is so hilly, and
so thickly wooded, as to be almost impenetrable, ex-
cept by the mauri or native footpaths, so that the
surveyors have first to discover them, and then cut
their way into the different valleys, and often in cut-
ting through one valley they discover another.
? But business, not farming, is what you and I are
more interested in, and here, I would say, you would
find a field suitable to your active and enterprising
disposition, You know what a new country is, and
what are its drawbacks, and you can put up without
repining with the loss of many of the little comforts
and conveniences you have been accustomed to at
home; you have done so before in a country where
you lost your health, and where you were frozen up
for half the year, and would think nothing of them in
such a healthy and temperate climate as this, so that
I have no hesitation in advising you to come out.
With others it is different, and glad as I would be to
see all my friends out here, I would not take the re-
sponsibility. of advising them. If they had been
brought up farmers at home, and could come out here
with a little capital, especially if they had a large
grown up family to assist them, they must do well ;
but for one unaccustomed to such work, or without,
capital, to come out, his chance of bettering his con-
dition is uncertain, although to a pushing fellow with
a little money the opportunities of turning it to advan.
tage are numerous.
** In sight of where I write there are no less than five
large three-masted vessels at anchor, besides two


schooners, and other smaller vessels. One of the
three-masters is the Maria Theresa, a Yankee barque,
full of Boston notions, all sorts of provisions and fur-
niture. This is the second barque from America,
similarly ladened, which has been here since I came.
They are a sort of floating warehouses. It is wonder-
ful to see such a young country dealing in such a
variety of fancy articles, as they generally have on
board, beautifully finished chairs, tables, sofas, clocks,
&c., which they can afford to sell at a cheaper rate
than the same can be imported from England, not-
withstanding our low wages, and small profits, and
overcrowded population. The whaling season will
soon commence; it begins in May, and a great quantity
of goods will then be required for the supply of the
different parties along the coast, so that 1 expect
business to be brisker than it has been for some time
past. The worst thing with me now is, that almost
all my saleable goods are, for the present, disposed of,
and to purchase other goods from the wholesale
houses, except to sell in a retail way, would not an-
swer. I have hitherto done only a wholesale business
indeed, without going to a considerable expense. I
have not convenience in my present premises to carry
on any other. But were you coming out, I would ad-
vise you to open a retail place principally for the sale
of provisions. If we could get a partner, resident at
home, with a little cash, to send out such goods as we
deal in, and beat up for consignments, a very good busi-
ness might be carried on.
Were a company got up at home to send out a
Scotch colony to Port Couper, as I have recom-
mended in some of my letters, that would be the
opportunity to start a good business. From all I can
learn, I think a company formed to colonize that
Port, and the country to the south of it, would succeed
better than in any other part of New Zealand. lam
inclined, from all I have heard, to think that Port
Levi, and Port Couper, to which the Nelson settlers
would have gone in preference, had they not been


hindered by the governor, would have been a more
eligible place. There are two ports to the north of
Banks? peninsula, separated from each other merely
by a head-land, forming a sort of angle. They run
up until they nearly meet. Port Couper is the
largest and most sheltered. A river runs into it, and
a large tract of fine grazing land, immediately available
for grazing, is seen stretching far into the interior.
? But what renders it particularly valuable is, that it
is the resort of so many whaling vessels of all nations,
particularly American, who find it a very lucrative
business. Not like this, and the Bay of Islands, which
are resorted to solely for the purpose of procuring
supplies; but there they lie off and on it, to catch the
fish and bring them in to prepare the oil.* It is to
the southward where the most vessels resort, and
where the best fishing stations are. Now that there
exists so much distress at home, which could be greatly
.relieved by emigration, could not a company be got
up in Scotland to colonize Port Couper, and share
tnese advantages? The government, I am sure,
would be friendly to the scheme, as it would be the
most effectual way to put down French pretensions,
by swamping their colony at Banks? Peninsula, by a
large British population in the neighbourhood. All
the merchants in the large towns would be found to
take an interest in it, as it would be a fine opening
for getting quit of their surplus hands and goods; and
the landlords might be got to take an interest in it, in
order to get rid of their superabundant tenantry. Be-
sides, what an opening it would be for the merchants
and shipowners of Glasgow and Greenock, who are at
present quite shut out by the London company from
any participation in the trade or profits derived from
this and the Nelson settlements. Almost all the
money required would be derived from the sale of
land, which they could sell at the same price as in the
Nelson settlement. Very little capital would require

Sea whale fishery.


-to be invested, and that I think might be easily and
beneficially raised by dividing it into a number of
shares of small amount, so as to interest the greater
number of people.
? I would recommend that the township, instead of
consisting of 1100 acres, like Wellington and Nelson,
should only contain 600, and those divided into quarter-
acre lots which might be sold at 51. along with 50
acres of country land, at 80s., in all 80/., quite enough
for any one either to buy or cultivate for the first two
or three years. As many as possible should be sold
in the first place to parties actually coming out, and
the remainder taken by the different boards of direc-
tors in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee, Aberdeen, and
other towns.
? Their agents in those different towns should be in-
structed to go into the villages around, in order to
beat up for emigrants, and converse with intending
ones, who ought principally to be selected from the
country, or country villages, where a better class of
emigrants can be got than from large towns ; for even
tradesmen in small villages, although not so expert at
any one thing, as those in towns, from being used to
turn their hands to a variety of work, are on that
account better fitted for a new country. The lowland
Scotch, from what I have seen of them, are best fitted
for a new colony. They are not only more enterpris-
ing and industrious, but being worse off at home, think
less than the English of the hardships and want of
comfort, which they must at first undergo on their
arrival in a new country, where everything is to be
done and created. I have no doubt, a Scotch colony
placed in the same circumstances would sooner com-
mence the work of production, and spend less in keep-
ing themselves in the mean time than an English one;
who, however uncomfortable their houses may be, or
however shabby their clothes, must live well, and are
besides more stupid and impracticable. Every en-
couragement may be confidently held out to farmers
of small capital, who could support themselves for one


year, till their first crop was brought home,?every
year after would increase their comforts and their
capital, and in a very few they would be independent
lairds and none to make them afraid. What with the
climate, the soil, and the abundance of moisture, there
is no other colony to be compared with it for agricul-
tural purposes, not shut up for six months of the year
with frost as in Canada, or burnt up with heat and
drought for four or six months as in Australia. A
country in which every kind of European productions
thrives. One valley has lately been discovered, near
Wellington, extending for about fifty miles, covered
with luxuriant grass fit for pasturing innumerable herds
of cattle. And the wool of the sheep pastured in the
island of Mana, in the straits, is equal to any pro-
duced in Australia. 10th June?in an excursion I
lately made a short way into the country with the
surveyor, I slept two nights on the ground in the
open air with impunity?and, as I formerly mentioned,
fevers in this part of the island are unknown. So you
see there is nothing wanting in this colony but capital,
and Scotch farmers, to make it the most flourishing
under the British crown.
? Purchasing cattle is the rage just now, so that I
hope every cottager will soon have his cow. It
has blown such a violent gale from the south-east, for
the last week, that no vessel could possibly arrive from
Nelson. The weather has been very stormy and cold
for the last fortnight, but the wind has taken off to-
night, and it feels more mild; I expect that it will be
round to the north-west to-morrow morning, and then
we will have fine weather again. This is our winter,
but I have never seen ice yet ?and I am now writing
in a room without a fire?there is, indeed, neither fire
nor fire-place in any room of the house except the
kitchen. Mr H. has just gathered a dish of green
peas from the little garden before the house; and the
border of mignionette (sown by Mr Imrie), which has
been cut four or five times, is sending out fresh shoots,
and a most delicious perfume. We have from this


little garden a constant succession of vegetables for
the kitchen.
<� Our society is good?many of the surveyors come
about the house I lodge in, so that I am well ac-
quainted with them ?all the young surveyors lately
come out are connected with most respectable families,
and are fine looking young men, accustomed to good
society. I have enjoyed good health, and feel my-
self very happy in Mrs Miller?s. She thinks you will
be pleased that lam with her. Remember me kindly
to all my friends.
?A. Perry.?
? Wellington, July , 1842.
227. ? Vessels from Sydney principally bring flour,
tea, sugar, rice, &c., which are now much cheaper than
they were some time ago. Most of the larger vessels
which have arrived have brought down cargoes of cattle
from Sydney or its neighbourhood?one from Brulee
and Two-fold Bay , and others are daily expected from
the same places; so that we are likely soon to be over-
stocked from want of land to feed them on. Not but
what there are plenty of districts in the neighbour-
hood available for that purpose if we had access to
them by roads. Indeed, I believe it will be found
that the quantity of land in the neighbourhood de-
pendent on this part for its supplies, and for an outlet
to its produce, is very great, and this port is second to
none in the country. Within a few hours? sail of this,
running up from Palliser Bay, for at least fifty or
sixty miles, is a large fine valley called the Wyrairapa
or Wydrop, consisting mostly of clear land, covered
with the finest grass, capable of supporting thousands
of cattle.
? The surveyors having gone up the fine river, the
Manuwatia, for ninety miles, found it connected with
this valley by a fine level country, through which they
entered it, and after coming down it a considerable
way crossed the mountains to the Hutt.
? Thus proving this part to be the centre and the


outlet to one, the finest agricultural, and the other
the finest pastoral districts yet discovered in this island.
Unless the Wydrop or some other grazing district is
speedily opened up, many of the cottagers and labour-
ers who have contrived to purchase a cow or two,
will be obliged to part with them from the impossibility
of finding food for them, ?hitherto they have allowed
them to pick up what they can get on the unoccupied
sites of the town, and the sections round about it ; but
a great part of the former is getting enclosed, and the
proprietors of the latter are either keeping cattle on
their sections, or letting them for that purpose to
others. A dairy is one of the best paying things
here?and cattle have been for some time the favourite
investment. Were a ship coming from the Clyde they
could not bring out a better thing than a good Ayr-
shire cow' and bull?they w?ould fetch a high price.
Mrs Miller, who purchased the cow brought out in the
Bengal Merchant, for 27/., has refused 100/. for it;
and she has been offered 50/. for its calf, not a year
old. Good stock of any kind, either horses, cows, or
sheep, would sell if brought out. I wish we had a
good stallion and draught mare of the Lanarkshire
breed. Land here is likely to rise rapidly. No. 116
Town Acre sold the other day for 950/. There were
buildings on it worth about 300/.; and an acre at the
head of the bay, with a water fontage, sold by Mr
Bid well for 1,200/.; and were this made the seat of
government, lands would rise very rapidly.
?A. Perry.?
Section 7.?Van Diemen?s Island, or Tasmania.
228. Van Diemen?s Island is situated on the S. E.
coast of New Holland, from which it is separated by
Bass?s Straits, between the parallels of 41� 20', and
43� 40' S., and the meridians of 144� 40?, and 148�
20' E. Its greatest extent from N. to S. is estimated
at about 210 miles, and from E. to W. 150 miles, and
containing an area nearly equal to Ireland.


229. The face of the interior is diversified, but very
mountainous, more in isolated peaks than in continued
ranges, with lofty table land occasionally, and exten-
sive fertile valleys. Numerous bays and harbours are
around the coast that afford secure anchorage. The
entrance from the ocean to the Derwent, on the banks
of which Hobart Town is built, presents two lines of
continuous bays or anchorage of unrivalled excellence;
the one most commonly used leads through Storm
Bay, and the other through D?Entrecasteaux?s Chan-
nel, which is one string of little bays or anchorages
for nearly 40 miles.
230. The capital is Hobart Town, the seat of go-
vernment : it is extensive and well laid out, and neatly
built, and situated on the River Derwent, about 20
miles from its mouth. The cove or bay, upon the
banks of which Hobart Town is built, affords one of
the best and most secure anchorages in the world, for
any number of vessels, and of any burthen. An am-
phitheatre of gently rising hills, beautifully clothed
with trees, and having Mount Wellington (4000 feet
elevation) as the highest, defends it from the westerly
winds, and bounds the horizon on that quarter?while
the magnificent estuary of the Derwent, (with its
boats and shipping, and picturesque points of land
along its winding banks, forming beautiful bays and
lakes), skirts it on the E. The town itself stands upon
a gently rising ground, and covers rather more than one
square mile. Its streets wide, long, and intersecting
each other at right angles. The suburbs of Hobart
Town have lately undergone considerable improve-
ment?handsome villas and enclosures occupying
ground in every direction, which, in some places,
would have been supposed to bid defiance to the hand
of art. A noble wharf has been constructed, so as to
allow vessels of the largest burthen to lade or unlade
close alongside the shore, without the assistance of
boats.
231. Next in rank and commercial importance, is
Launceston, on the north side of the island, distant,


by a good road, 121 miles from Hobart Town. It is
the richest land in the island, backed by gently rising
hills, at the confluence of the N. and S. Esk Rivers,
which there form the Tamar, flowing about 45 miles,
when it disembogues into the ocean at Bass?s Straits.
The town is thriving greatly, owing to its being the
maritime key of a large and fertile country, and afford-
ing sufficient water for vessels upwards of 400 tons
burthen, to load alongside the wharfs.
232. The geology of the island is very varied?ba-
salt is supposed to be the principal stratum ?limestone
is almost the only mineral that has yet been brought
into general use?marble of a white mixed gray colour,
susceptible of a good polish, has frequently been found,
though never yet dug up or applied to use. Iron ore
is very frequent, both of a red, brown, and black,
colour. In one or two instances it has been analyzed,
and found to contain eighty per cent, of the perfect
mineral. The soil is very varied, in some places a
rich, black, alluvial mould, in others sandy or argilla-
ceous; its fertility is shown by the excellent crops
produced, the land being cultivated for years without
being manured.
233. Van Diemen?s Land is a lieutenant govern-
ment of New South Wales, but in local matters since
1825, the lieutenant governor with the aid of an
executive and legislative council, administers the
affairs of the island after the same manner as they are
carried on in New South Wales, and independent of
that government. The governor of New South Wales
is ex-officio general of the district, which includes Van
Diemen?s Island; the lieut.-governor of the colony
being only colonel, and in that capacity, commanding
the troops stationed in the island.
234. The trade of this colony may be judged of,
that it has increased with Great Britain sevenfold in
12 years, and the whole imports of the settlement
have been augmented nearly tenfold. The exports
have been augmented from 14,000/. to 420,000/. per
annum, and the tonnage has been extended in the


proportion of sto 1. The value of land and cattle has
increased during the same period 400 per cent. The
principal exports of the colony are wool, whale and
seal oil, whalebone and bark, to England; and provi-
sions and live stock to the neighbouring colonies. The
quantity of wool exported in 1827, was 192,075 lbs.;
in 1835, 1,942,800 lbs,, price Is. Qd. to 2s. 6d. per ll>.
235. In 1824, there was but one Bank in the colony
with a capital of 20,000/. j in 1835, there were six
banks, with a paid vp capital of 200,000/. The
amount of specie in the colony was estimated, in
1835, at about 130,000/., which sum comprises British
gold, silver, and copper, money, and dollars of the
South American States, as well as sicca rupees.
236. The climate is exceedingly pleasant and salu-
brious, and well suited for European constitutions.
In summer the heat is not so great as in Australia,
and the cold in winter is more intense and of longer
duration, although it is mild compared to the winter
temperature of Great Britain. The island possesses a
great variety of trees and shrubs. The gum tree is the
largest, and there are numerous others well adapted
for ship and house building. The trees are all tall and
straight, branching only at the top, and they are nearly
all evergreens. All the vegetables and fruits, known
and cultivated in England and Scotland, are raised
without difficulty, in great abundance, and of excellent
quality. Both the climate and soil are sufficiently
favourable to the production of most descriptions of
grain; wheat thrives well, and potatoes are in general
a good crop. In a word, the island is fitted for all
agricultural purposes attempted in Great Britain; the
soil differing little, and the climate being much the
same, though rather milder. Several good roads have
been made through the island, but it still labours
under a want in this respect*


Section 8. ?Conclusion of Australasia.
237. In concluding the subject of our Australasian
colonies, we have to remark that they are all fitted for
the growth of wool, for the cultivation of grain, and
the prosecution of the whale fishing. The Australian
colonies are probably the best suited for rearing sheep,
and consequently for the production of wool} but
New Zealand and Van Diemen?s Land have the de-
cided preference in raising grain crops, and the former
seems the best situated for its settlers engaging in the
whale fishing. New Zealand is also likely, for many
years to come, to possess a valuable trade in timber,
and to be w r ell fitted for colonial ship-building. New
South Wales and Van Diemen?s Land possess all the
advantages and disadvantages of being penal colonies,
which none of the other Australasian colonies are.
The free settlers have the advantage of convict labour,
but they suffer under the deterioration of manners and
morals which the habits of the convicts and the state
of slavery to which they are reduced is too apt to pro-
duce, and they are also from time to time harassed
with the depredations of bush rangers and escaped
convicts, as well as from the native inhabitants. In
New Zealand the natives are greatly improved by their
intercourse with Europeans, and appear to have been
much benefited by the missionaries resident among
them. They appear to be much more capable of im-
provement than the natives of Australia, are ready of
apprehension, and tractable. They make excellent
steersmen of ships, and one is mentioned, by Polack,
as having risen to be mate of a colonial vessel. They
generally dwell in small villages. On all occasions
they have manifested a desire to learn, have exhibited
great aptitude in acquiring civilized customs, and are
curious to know the use of everything they see, not
being content with a mere childish admiration. Oc-
casional instances of theft have occurred among these


people, but on the whole, their faculties seem of a
superior order.
238. The great disadvantage under which the whole
of the Australasian colonies labour is, their extreme
distance from Great Britain, which makes it next to im-
possible for labouring emigrants to pay the expense of
their passage out, so that colonists with capital sufferfrom
want of workmen and labourers. This has been to a cer-
tain extent provided against by government, and the
New Zealand and other companies, setting apart a por-
tion of the price of land sold by them for the conveyance
out, of labourers of a certain description. It is under-
stood, however, that government do not intend, in the
mean time, to send out more emigrants on this plan,
and the New Zealand company having, in consequence
of their disputes with government, come to the con-
clusion of letting no more land, are necessarily obliged
to stop shipping labourers to their settlements on these
islands. The Western Australian company, however,
continue to send labourers to Australind and Swan
River. .The terms on which this is done, and the
qualifications necessary, and manner of application,
can be ascertained by application to C. H. Smith,
Esq., Secretary, Western Australian Company,?
Office, 33, Old Broad Street, London.
239. The great advantages of New Zealand, as a place
for colonization, has given rise to proposals in London
for a new mode of effecting this, which it is hoped will
be carried into execution during the present year. It is
proposed to form a company of real settlers, not mere
purchasers of land, who shall jointly advance a certain
capital; that a block of land be purchased from the
British government, to be afterwards sold out to the
setlers individually in proper sections; that a town
be laid out, and that a portion of the funds be set
apart for the conveyance of labourers and workmen,
which is to be continued from the produce of the sale
of land as the colony advances. By purchasing from
government, any dispute as to the title to the land
will be prevented; and by the partners being all real


settlers, the disadvantage of absentee proprietors will
be avoided. The Government minimum price of
land, throughout the whole of the Australian colonies,
is at present 20s. per acre; and at this price sections
are from time to time set up and disposed of by auc-
tion.
CHAPTER 111.
AFRICA AND SOUTH AMERICA.
Section I.?Cape of Good Hope.
240. The Cape of Good Hope, situated at the
southern extremity of Africa, is bounded by the vast
southern ocean on the S.; on the W. by the Atlantic;
on the E. by the Indian ocean; and on the N. by the
Gariep or Orange River, and by unexplored terri-
tories. It is difficult to state the exact area of South
Africa, extending from Cape Point, in S. latitude
34� 23' to Delagoa bay, a Portuguese settlement, on
the E. coast, in latitude 26�. In order to explain the
nature of the country, it is necessary to consider the
British territory, which after its conquest from the
Dutch was thus defined by Mr Barrow in 1801;
length of the colony, from W. to E., Cape Point to
Kafferland, 580 miles ; from River Koussie to Zuure-
berg, 520 ; breadth from S. to N. River Koussie to
Cape Point, 815 miles; Nieuwveld mountains to
Plettenburg?s Bay, 160; mouth of the Tush River to
Plettenburg?s baaken, 225 miles; which gives a par-
allelogram, whose mean length is 550, and mean


breadth 233 English miles, comprising an area of
128,150 square miles. The boundaries may be con-
sidered as the Keiskamma River on the E., and the
Gariep or Orange River on the N., estimated at 600
miles from E. to W., and 330 miles from N. to S.,
comprising an area of about 200,000 square miles,
with a sea-coast of upwards of 1200 miles, from the
Gariep on the western or Atlantic shore to the Keis-
kamma, on the eastern or Indian Ocean coast.
241. Southern Africa is composed of chains of
mountains and intervening valleys, extending east and
west, excepting one range beginning at Table Bay,
and stretching northward along the western coast
about 200 miles, as far as Olifant?s River. The first
great chain has, along the southern coast, a belt of un-
dulating land, varying from 10 to 30 miles in width,
indented by several bays, and intersected by numerous
streamlets; the soil is rich, the hills are well wooded,
and the climate equable and mild, from its proximity
to the ocean. The next is the Zvvaarte Bergen or
Black Mountains; more lofty and rugged than the
coast chain, and divided from it by an interval of from
10 to 20 miles wide, the surface of which is very
varied, in some places barren hills predominating, in
others naked and arid plains of clay, termed by the
colonists the karroo, while widely interspersed are
patches of well watered, fertile and beautifnl grounds.
The third range is the Nieuwveld?s Bergen?between
these mountains and the second range is the Great
Karroo, or Desert, an elevated steppe or terrace,
nearly 300 miles in length from E. to W., 80 in
breadth, and 1000 feet above the sea. Along the
western coast the country also ascends in successive
terraces, the most elevated of which (the Roggeveldt)
unites with the last mentioned chain of mountain, (the
Nieuwveldt). Indeed the Roggeveldt Bergen range
may be said to commence in nearly 30� S. latitude,
running nearly south for two and a-half degrees, when
its course is bent to the E., and subsequently to the
N. E. until the range reaches Delagoa Bay, that part


of it forming the north boundary of the Great Karroo,
being termed Nieuwvelds Bergen.
242. Cape Town, built immediately at the foot of
Table Mountain, along the shores of Table Bay, on a
plain which rises with an easy ascent towards the
mountain, is regularly constructed, with straight and
parallel streets intersecting each other at right angles,
and shaded with elm or oak trees; the houses chiefly
of red brick or stone, of a good size, and generally
with a sioup, or terrace, before the door, shaded with
trees. The population of the metropolis of South
Africa is at present more than 20,000, of whom nearly
15,000 are white inhabitants?the majority being
Dutch, or of Dutch descent. The squares are well
laid out, the streets extremely clean, the public edifices
numerous and substantial. The colony is divided into
eleven districts. These are Cape Town, Cape, Stel-
lenbosch, Worcester, Swellendam, George, Uiten-
hage, GraafF Reinet, Beaufort, Albany, and Somerset
districts.
24 b. Southern Africa is of diluvian origin ; the for-
mation of the peninsula being indicated by the struc-
ture of Table Mountain, which is composed of strata,
piled on each other in large tabular masses lying close
together without any veins of earthy matter. The
plain round the mountain is a blue schistus, running
in parallel ridges N. W. and S. E., and interrupted
by masses of a hard blue flinty rock. The schistus
rests on a stratum of strong iron-coloured clay, abound-
ing with brown foliated mica, and interspersed with
immense blocks of granite. A stratum of coal found
on the banks of a deep rivulet flowing from the
Tigerberg, was horizontal with a super-stratum of
pipe-clay and white sandstone, and a substratum of
indurated clay. The coaly seam from ten inches to
two feet in thickness, differed in quality at various
places?sometimes it was in large ligneous blocks with
visible traces of the bark, knots, and grain, of timber.
Other parts of the stratum consisted of laminated coal
of the nature of turf, burning with a clear flame, and


leaving a light white ash. A vein of coal has recently
been discovered near the mouth of the Kroom River,
which is accessible to small craft. Ironstone is every-
where observable in Kaffraria, and likewise consider-
able quantities of ochre of different kinds. In the
Graaff Reinet district abundance of limestone is found.
244. The soil throughout the colony is very varied
?in some places a naked sand, in others a stiff clay,
and in many parts a rich dark vegetable mould; fre-
quently the surface appears a dry sand, but on re-
moving it to the depth of a few inches, a black mould
is found beneath; the stiff clayey soil, sometimes red,
and sometimes met with of a yellowish colour, is very
fertile when irrigated. The east coast border is gen-
erally an alluvial loam, is in the case with many
valleys, particularly among the ravines and windings
of the Fish River. At Camtoos Bay (20 miles W. of
Algoa Bay) a rich lead ore of the species knowm by
the name of galena, (lead mineralized with sulphur),
has been found in the steep sides of a deep glen; the
masses seen by Mr Barrow had no appearance of cubic
crystallization, but w r ere granular or amorphous in
some species; the surfaces, in others, made up of
small facets, called by miners white silver ore: the
vein of the ore was three inches wide and one thick,
increasing in size as it advanced under the stratum of
rock with which it was covered. The matrix, is a
quartzoze sandstone of a yellowish tinge, cellular and
fibrous, harsh to the touch, and easily broken. This
ore, when assayed by Major Van. Dheu, an officer in
the Dutch service, yielded from 200 lbs. weight, 100
lbs. of pure lead and 8 oz. of silver.
245. The healthiness of the Cape district is evinced
by the fact, that in 1830, out of a population of 1500,
at Hottentot?s Holland, the total number of deaths
was only five ; of which four were coloured persons,
one an old Mozambiquer, another an old slave, both
of whom died of chronic diseases ; the third, a young
child, died suddenly; the fourth, a Kaffre girl, was
burnt; and the fifth, a European gentleman of 50,


principally of a mental affection. The mean tempera-
ture of Cape Town (which is heated by its proximity
to Table Mountain) inferred from a meteorological
journal kept for several years, is The mean
temperature of the coldest month is, perhaps, 37�;
hottest, 79?; mean of three recent winters, 58� ; of
three summer months> 77�; least heat during sum-
mer, 63�. The temperature of the district of Stellen-
bosch, deduced from the observations of a single
twelvemonth, is 66�� ; extremes 87� and 50�. In this
colony, as in the S. of Europe, and most of the warm
climates of a temperate zone, the wind commonly
blows cold in summer, at the same time that the sun
shines powerfully. The total population of South
Africa in 1836, was 130,110.
246. The number of persons to the square mile in
the Cape District, including Cape town, is but nine ;
in Stellenbosch, seven; in Worcester there are nearly
three square miles to each individual; in Clan-Wil-
liam more than two; in Swellendam and George
there are two persons to each square mile ; in Uiten-
hage, little more than one ; in Albany six; in Somer-
set nearly two; in Graaff Reinet, not quite one ; and
in Beaufort there are nearly three square miles to each
individual. The total proportion of population to
area is about one person to each square mile. The
proportion of births to deaths, in 1836, was more than
two to one.
247. The affairs of the colony are administered by
a governor (salary 6000/. per annum), nominated by
the crown, aided by an executive council, composed
of the commander of the forces, the chief justice, the
auditor-general, treasurer, and accountant-general,
the secretary to the government. There is a legisla-
tive council appointed by the government in England,
at the recommendation of course of the colonial govern-
ment. The members of this council (of whom five
are official) after two years? sitting, hold their seats
for life; their debates are carried on with open
doors.


248; Of the commerce of the colony an idea may be
formed from the following statement of the total value
of Imports and Exports: Cape Town,imports 780,673/.,
exports 336,199/,; Port Elizabeth, imports 87,246/.,
exports 47,307/.; Simon?s town imports 23,243/., ex-
ports 877/.; grand total colony, imports, 891,162/.,
exports 384,383/. The above exports are exclusive
of the value of articles shipped as stores to merchant
vessels, or supplies to H. M, Navy, the latter amount-
ing this year to 3,082/.
249. The imports at the Cape consist of every variety
of articles of British manufacture, and the extent to
which our trade can be carried is difficult to state,
for an outlet has now been opened for calicoes, ker-
seys, ironmongery, gunpowder, &c., in exchange for
ivory, hides, gums, horns, &c.
250. Corn, wine, wool, provisions, wine, aloes, and
fruits, are the staples of this fine colony, but many
other articles are either produced in the country, or
obtained from the neighbouring nations. There is
an annual exportation of corn, and it brings, as flour,
a higher price at the Mauritius, and other markets,
than the best American. Two crops of potatoes are
raised in the year, of a succulent and yet mealy quali-
ty; and the nutritive property of every article of pro-
visions is abundantly exemplified in the fat and healthy
appearance of the people. The property embarked in
England, and in the colony, in the trade in Cape wine,
was recently estimated as follows; Vineyard lands
and growing vines, 1,200,000/.; buildings, stores, vats,
&c., in the country, 60,000/.; buildings, vats, &c., in
Cape Town, 300,000/.; brandy, casks, &c., 100,000/.;
wine in Cape Town, 125,000/.; stock in bond, in
England, about 10,000 pipes, at 12/. each, 120,000/.:
total, 1,905.000/.
251. The produce of wine and brandy in 1841, and
subsequent years,is thus given in a manuscript prepared
at the Colonial Office. The quantity in leaguers (a
leaguer being 152 gallons) 1821, 16,254 of wine; 1205
of brandy; 1824, w. 16183, b. 1,326; 1828, w.


20,405, b. 1413; 1831, w. 18,467, b. 1382; 1832,
w. 16,973, b. 1,394 J.
252. Wool will, in time, be one of the greatest and
most profitable staples of the Cape ; by an unaccount-
able want of foresight it has long been neglected, but,
stimulated by the example of New South Wales, the
colonists are now actively engaged in endeavouring
to replace the coarse woolled, or rather hairy sheep
(of which they possess 3,000,000) for the fine and
pure-blood breed of that animal, whose numbers at
the Cape now amount to upwards of 50,000 ?the
wool from which has brought 2s. Qd. per lb. in the
London market. The British settlers in Albany have
taken the lead, and are at present importing Saxon
and Merino rams from England and New South
Wales, the former bringing 15/. per head, and the
latter 30/. per head. Algoa Bay or Port Elizabeth, as
it is now called, has thus increased its exportation of
fine wool: 1830, 4500 lbs./value 222/.; 1831, 10,600
lbs.,value 551/.; 1832, 19,700 lbs.,value93s/.; 1833,
44,896 lbs., value 2649/.; 1834,'59,266 lbs., value
3279/.
253. The fineness of the climate, requiring no winter
provender, and the great extent of upland soil and
park-like downs, with the numerous salsola and saline
plants, so admirably adapted to prevent the fluke or
rot, show the adaptation of the colony fora vast sheep-
fold, capable of supplying an almost indefinite quan-
tity of the finest wool; and, together with New South
Wales and Van Diemen?s Land, rendering England
not only totally independent of supplies from Ger-
many and Spain, but really furnishing a much finer
and more durable and elastic wool, which will enable
us to maintain our superiority in woollens against fo-
reign competition: this is a view of the subject which
it behoves a statesman to attend to.
254. Provisions, particularly salt beef, ought to be
larger staple than it is, but no doubt will augment in
quantity as it certainly has improved in quality. At
present, cured meat is pretty largely exported to the


Mauritius, and other places, but it should be used for
victualling 1 our navy at the Cape, India, and West
Africa stations, the contractors being placed under
the same supervision as at home, every cask being
examined and branded before shipment, and a heavy
penalty attending any default.
255. The fisheries of the Cape have not yet been
sufficiently attended to: during the calving season,
whales come into every bay on the coast, to bring
forth their young, and thus, in some seasons, a good
number of these immense creatures are taken; but
there have been no vessels fitted out for whaling
along the coast, or among the islands to the north-
ward of Madagascar, where the sperm whale abounds,
and where, under a genial clime, and an atmosphere
never troubled with tempests, the American whalers
fill up in a few weeks. Even in Delagoa Bay, almost
a part of the colony, 20 whale ships,' English and
American, have been seen, but not one from the
contiguous settlers at the Cape. Oil from vege-
tables might also be extensively collected ; the olive
thrives luxuriantly where planted, and a rich and
peculiar oil, collected by expression, from the sesa~
mum plant, may be obtained in large quantities from
the native tribes to the eastward and northward. The
aloe plant grows indigenously in most parts of the
colony, and a considerable quantity of the inspissated
juice has been exported for some years, a large por-
tion being probably used as a substitute for taxed hops
in England. Fruits of a dried nature, including
apples, apricots, peaches, pears, &c., have been long
in great demand. Hides, horns, ivory, gums, are
also valuable branches of produce.
256. The Cape of Good Hope has not hitherto
been favourably viewed as a field for emigration, yet
it seems not unworthy of the attention of those who
possess capital. Like all the distant colonies belong-
ing to Great Britain, the want of a labouring popula-
tion is much felt. The following letter from Graham-
ston, a thriving settlement on Albany district, shows


the prospects held out on this colony to labouring
emigrants: ?
? Graham?s Town, 24 th Nov., 1842.
257. ? My Dear Sir, ?Some of the emigrants by the
Anne have arrived here, and I am glad to inform you
that I have obtained situations for the whole of them;
but they are not entirely the description of emi-
grants we require; clerks and storemen are not wanted
here, and those who do not follow trades and are not
acquainted with country work will have much difficulty
in obtaining situations. In a letter from Algoa Bay,
a gentleman says, that out of the whole, only one
man appeared to be really of the description required;
he was dressed in a good smock-frock and Belcher
handkerchief. Such men will easily find employment;
for there are only two descriptions of emigrants which
ought to be sent, either the capitalist or the hard-
working man. Pray do not send us too many trades-
men. Bricklayers, stone-masons, and carpenters, will
find ready employment. A good copper-smith and
brazier is much wanted. Bakers and butchers, shoe-
makers, saddlers and harness-makers, wheelwrights,
turners, cabinet-makers, smiths, plasterers, and pain-
ters, can all, to a limited number, find employment,
provided they be good workmen. One or two good
cutlers would also get business. But the emigrant
who will most readily find employment, is the country-
farm servant, who with you obtains from Bs. to 10s. a
week, and has to support himself. Such a man, if
really industrious and sober, may very soon be inde-
pendent. I would strongly recommend you to corres-
pond with some person in Scotland, to obtain shepherds
and ploughmen, as these are reared to a hard life in a
hilly country, and are better suited to our wants. They
are sober, generally educated, their wants are few,
and their notions of luxury not so enlarged as your
countrymen. Shepherds from any part of England
where the flocks are kept on cultivated soil, and where
flocks are small, are not suited to this country; but
those from the Cheviots, or that range of mountains


which crosses the country on the borders of England
and Scotland, or those from the Highlands, are the
most suited to this country ; they consider all the
bodily hardships they may endure minor to the safety
and welfare of their flocks; they are inured from
their cradle to hardship, and their wants are small.
Such men will be greedily caught up here at wages
which they have been unaccustomed to, and not only
can they obtain fair wages, but their masters will
readily afford them opportunities to acquire flocks of
their own. So that in a few years, if sober, indus-
trious, and attentive to their masters? interests, they
may become small flock-masters. If you have no
correspondent on whom you can rely to obtain such
men, I recommend you to write to my brother.
?To conclude this subject; the emigrants we re-
quire most are hard-working men, who will be willing
to turn their hands to anything which may be required
of them, and capitalists. Gentlemen with small capi-
tal, requiring others to labour for them, have a poor
chance of success; and even farmers, with a good
knowledge of agriculture, and the management of cattle
and sheep, seeking situations as overseers of farms are
not in demand.
? I hoped to have remitted to you before this 300/. to
commence emigration on account of the Eastern Dis-
tricts Emigration Association. 1 have obtained a bill
for 200/., payable at Messrs Ransom and Co., Bankers,
London, the first of which I now enclose; and so
soon as I can obtain other bills on London, you may
expect a further remittance. I am, &c.,
?J. S. Christophers, Esq. ?E. R. Bell, Secy.?
Section 2.?Falkland Islands.
258. The Falkland islands are about 90 in number.
They are situated between the parallels of 50� 58' and
52� 46' south, and the meridian 57� 20' and 61� 29'
west, near the Straits of Magellan. They were first
discovered during the reign of queen Elizabeth, but


little was known of them until Commodore Byron
visited them in 1765, and formally took possession of
them for his majesty George 111.
259. The two largest of the islands are nearly 100
miles in length, and 50 in breadth, and divided by a
channel 12 leagues in length, and from one to three
in breadth. The harbours are large, and well de-
fended by small islands, most happily disposed. The
smallest vessels may ride in safety j fresh water is
easily to be obtained ; there is seldom any thunder or
lightning, nor is the weather hot or- cold to any ex-
traordinary degree. Throughout the year the nights
are in general serene and fair ; and upon the whole,
the climate is favourable to the constitution. The
depth of the soil in the valleys is more than sufficient
for the purpose of ploughing. Since 1767j they fell
into comparative insignificance ; and for many years
past, little notice has been taken of them by our
government. Ships of war, on their passage round
Cape Horn, have occasionally touched there for sup-
plies of water, &c., and South Sea whalers and other
merchant vessels; but the navigation being little
known, they have not, until lately, been much fre-
quented, although very nearly in the track of ships
homeward bound from the Pacific.
260. In the month of December, 1832, Commander
Onslow, in H. M. S. Clio , proceeded to Port Egmont,
and found on Saunders? Island the ruins of our former
establishment. The town stood on the south side of
a mountain not less than 600 feet high. The settlers
had extended their gardens to the westward, the re-
mains of which are still perceptible. East Falkland
Island possesses large and secure harbours for first
rate ships of war, with facilities for exercising the
crews on shore without the risk of losing them, and
with abundance of wild cattle, anti-scorbutic herbs,
and fish, for their support.
261. The soil of East Falkland Island has been
found well adapted to cultivation, consisting generally
of from six to eight inches of black vegetable mould,


below which is either gravel or clay. The meadows
are spacious, well watered, and producing excellent
grasses. Wheat and flax were both raised of quality
equal, if not superior to the seed sown, which was
procured from Buenos Ayres j and potatoes, cab-
bage, turnips, and other kinds of vegetables pro-
duced largely, and of excellent quality. Fruit trees
were not tried, the plants sent from Buenos Ayres
having perished before they arrived.
262. The soil also produces different kinds of vege-
tables wild, as celery, cresses, &c., and many other
esculent plants, the proper names of which were not
known to the settlers, but their palatable taste and
valuable anti-scorbutic properties were abundantly
ascertained by them. Among others is one which
they called the tea-plant, growing close to the ground,
and producing a berry of the size of a large pea,
white with a tinge of rose colour, and of exquisite
flavour. ? A decoction of its leaves is a good sub-
stitute for tea, whence its name. It is very abun-
dant.
263. No trees grow on the island, but wood for
building was obtained tolerably easy from the adjoin-
ing Straits of Magellan. For fuel, besides peat and
turf, which are abundant in many places, and may be
procured dry out of the penguins? holes, three kinds
of bushes are found, called fachinal, matajo, and gruil-
lera. The first of these grows straight, from two to
five feet high, the second is more abundant in the
southern than in the northern part of the island ; its
trunk is never higher than three feet, and the gruillera
is the smallest of the three, growing close to the
ground, but is abundant all over the island.
264. Only one species of animal was found in the
island, a kind of wolf-fox, which Byron describes as
extremely fierce, running from a great distance to
attack the sailors when they landed, and even pur-
suing them into the boat. It is about the size of a
shepherd?s dog, and kennels under ground, subsisting
on the seals and birds, which it catches along the


shore. Sea lions, wallrusses, and seals, are abundant
about the coast, many of them of great size, and very
fierce. Swans, wild green ducks, teal, and all kinds
of sea-fowl, are found in great numbers.
265, Herds of wild horned cattle, to the extent of
many thousands, exist on the island, sufficient to main-
tain a great many settlers ; and wild hogs are abun-
dant in the northern peninsula. Wild horses are also
found there of small size, but very hardy, which,
when broken in, as some were without difficulty,
were found of great service to the settlement. Rabbits
are in great numbers, of a large size and fine fur.
266. Fish abounds in all the bays and inlets, espe-
cially in spring, when they come to spawn at the
mouths of the fresh water rivulets.
267. Various proposals have been made from time to
time for the colonization of these islands, but hitherto
without being carried into effect. Government, how-
ever, has now seriously turned its attention to their
immediate colonization; and proposals have just been
issued by her Majesty?s colonization commissioners,
for the sale of lands in these islands. Land is offered
at 12s. per acre, and a proportion of the price obtained,
is to be set apart for the free conveyance of emigrants
considered eligible. The passage money for those who
do not come within the description entitled to free
conveyance, is 10/.

justices, by the admission of such party or otherwise, that no
sufficient distress can be had whereon to levy the monies so ad-
judged to be paid, they may, if they think fit, refrain from issuing
such warrant of distress; and in such case, or if such warrant
shall have been issued, and upon the return thereof such insuffi-
ciency as aforesaid shall be made to appear to the justices, they
shall by warrant cause the party ordered to pay such monies and
costs as aforesaid to be committed to gaol, there to remain with-
out bail for any term not exceeding three months, unless such
monies and costs ordered to be paid, and such costs of distress
and sale as aforesaid, be sooner paid and satisfied.
XXX. If in any proceeding before any justices under this act,
or upon any action whatsoever, against any person for anything
done either contrary to or in pursuance of this act, a question

given of such fact, and shall be deemed legal and sufficient evi-
dence.
XXXI. Any passenger suing for any sum of money made re-
coverable by this act as return of passage-money, subsistence-

?witness in any proceeding for the recovery thereof, notwithstand-
ing the same, if recovered, shall be applicable to his own use and
benefit.
XXXII. Where any distress shall he made for any penalty,
to he levied hy virtue of this act, the distress itself shall not be
deemed unlawful, nor the party making the same be deemed a
trespasser, on account of any defect or want of form in the in-
formation, summons, conviction, warrant of distress, or other
proceedings, nor shall the party distraining he deemed a tres-
passer ah initio on account of any irregularity which shall be
afterwards committed by the party so distraining, but the person
aggrieved may recover full satisfaction for the special damage in
an action upon the case.
XXXIII. No plaintiff shall recover in any action against any
person for anything done in pursuance of this act if tender of
sufficient amends shall have been made before such action
brought, or if after action brought, a sufficient sum of money
shall have been paid into coUrt, with costs, on behalf of the
defendant.
XXXIV. No action shall be commenced against any person
under the authority of this act, until 21 days? notice has been
given thereof in writing to the party against whom such action
is intended to be brought, nor after three calendar months next
after the act committed for which such action shall be so brought;
and every such action shall be brought, laid, and tried, where the
cause of action shall have arisen, and not in any other place; and
the defendant in such action may plead the general issue, and
give this act and any special matter in evidence at any trial
which shall he had thereupon ; and if the matter shall appear to
have been done under this act, or it shall appear that such action
was brought before 21 days? notice given, or if any action shall
not be commenced within the time before limited, or shall be
brought in any other place than as aforesaid, then the jury shall

clamation, to be issued for that purpose, that this act shall be
extended and shall apply to the carriage of passengers by sea
from such colony to such places as may by him be named for the
purpose in such proclamation, and this act shall be thenceforth
so extended and shall so apply accordingly.
XXXIX. It shall be lawful for the governor or officer admin-
istering the government of any of the British colonies to which
the act, as respects the carriage of passengers by sea therefrom,

proclamation to be by him from time to time for that purpose, to
declare the rule of computation by which the length of the voy-
age of any ship carrying passengers from such colony to any
other place shall be estimated for the purposes of the act: pro-
vided nevertheless, that the act shall not, except as respects the
West Indies, extend or apply to any such voyage, if the length
thereof so computed shall not be three weeks or upwards.
XL. It shall be lawful for the governor of any of the British
colonies to which the act has been hereby extended, by any pro-
clamation or proclamations to be by him from time to time
issued for that purpose, to substitute for the articles of food and

provisions as shall be a full equivalent for the same. ?
XLI. Every such proclamation shall be transmitted by the
governor by whom the same 'may have been issued to Her
Majesty, through one of Her Majesty?s principal secretaries of
state, for Her. Majesty?s confirmation or disallowance; and in
case the same shall be disallowed by any order to be made by
Her Majesty for that purpose, with the advice of her privy
council, then from and after the promulgation of any such order
in council within any such colony, any such proclamation shall
cease to be of any force or authority, but until so disallowed the
same shall be duly observed and obeyed : provided also, that on
the production at any one of the colonies of an attested copy of
any such proclamation, under the hand of the governor of the
colony, and under the public seal of such colony, such copy shall,
in the colony wherein the same shall be so produced, be received
as sufficient evidence of the issuing and of the contents of such
proclamation.
XLII. All the powers and authorities vested by the act, in
the collector and comptroller of the customs, for determining the
seaworthiness of any ship carrying passengers from any port in
the united kingdom, shall, in respect of any ship carrying pas-

duration than three weeks, the owner or charterer of a ship may,
if he think fit, contract with the passengers engaging passages
therein, that they shall respectively provide themselves with
necessary food (not including water) for the voyage; and in
such case the regulations of this act respecting the issue of pro-
visions by the master shall not be applicable to the passengers
on such voyage.
XLVI. It shall be lawful for the governor of any British
colony (other than the West Indies) to which this act, as respects
the carnage of passengers by sea therefrom, has been extended,
by proclamation to declare that the enactment herein-before
contained respecting voyages from the West Indies of shorter
duration than three weeks shall extend to voyages from the
colony, such voyage being of less duration than three days; and
thereupon such enactment shall extend and apply to such voyage.
XLVII. Nothing in the act contained shall be construed to
extend to prevent the enactment by the respective governors,
councils, and assemblies, or other local legislatures, in the British
West Indies and South America, and in the Bahama Islands,
and in Bermuda, or by Her Majesty, with the advico of her
privy council, of any such acts of general assembly, or ordin-
ances, or orders in council, as may be requisite for establishing
such regulations as are required by this act, or any of them,
or for carrying the same into full and complete effect; but it
shall not be lawful for any such governor, council, and assembly,
or for any such local legislature, or for Her Majesty in council,
acts of assembly, ordinances, or orders in council, to make
or establish any enactment, provision, rule, or order which shall
be in anywise repugnant or contradictory to this act or any part
thereof, and every such enactment, regulation, provision, rule,
or order shall be, and is hereby declared to be absolutely null
and void and of no effect.
XLYIII. Nothing in the act shall be construed to apply to
any of the territories under the government of the East India
Company, or to any of the governors appointed by the said Com-
pany ; nor shall anything in the act be construed to affect the
powers now vested in the governor general of India in council
to make laws and regulations whereby the provisions of this act,
or such of them as to the said governor general shall seem ex-
pedient, shall be extended to the territories under the govern-
ment of the said company, or in respect of which the said gover-
nor general has now by law a power of legislation; but it shall
be lawful for the governor general, from time to time, by any
act to be passed for that purpose, to declare that this act, with
such exceptions as are herein-before mentioned, shall extend to
the carriage of passengers upon any voyage from any ports within


the territories of the East India Company, to he specified in such
act, to any other places ?whatsoever, to be also specified, and also
in like manner to authorize the substitution of other equivalent
articles of food and provisions for those before enumerated, and
to declare the rule of computation by which the length of any
voyage shall be estimated, and to confer the powers herein-before
conferred upon government emigration agents, and collectors and
comptrollers of the customs, with respect to ascertaining and
deciding on the seaworthiness of a ship, upon such officers of the
East India Company, as the said governor general may think
proper; and from and after the passing of such act, and whilst
the same shall remain in force, this act shall, with such excep-
tions as are herein-before made as respects voyages from the
colonies, apply to and extend to the carriage of passengers upon
such voyages as in the said act or acts shall be specified ; which
acts shall nevertheless be subject to disallowance and repeal, and
shall in the same manner be transmitted to England, and be laid
before both houses of parliament, as in the case of any other laws
or regulations which the said governor general in council is now
by law empowered to make.
XLIX. It shall be lawful for the governor general of India in
council, from time to time, by any act, to declare in what man-
ner, and before what authorities, and by what form of proceed-
ings, the penalties imposed and the sums of money made re-
coverable by this act shall be sued for and recovered within any
places or territories under the government of the East India
Company, and to what uses the penalties shall be applied.
L. The provisions, regulations, penalties, and forfeitures set
forth in this act shall extend and be deemed to extend to foreign
vessels carrying passengers upon any voyage from any port or
place in the United Kingdom, to or for any port or place out of
Europe, and not being within the Mediterranean Sea, or upon
any other voyage to which the provisions of this act shall for the
time being extend.
LI. Wherever the term ? passage? or ? passenger? is used in
