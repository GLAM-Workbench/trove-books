INTRODUCTION.
The subject matter of this little Handbook would
assuredly admit of much eloquent language, and page
upon page might be occupied in discussing the probable
revolution of our present monetary system, together
with other important features inseparable from the
recent discoveries in 4 The Two Lands of Gold.? But
in a Synopsis of this form, which chiefly answers to the
character of a descriptive catalogue, no space can be
devoted to dry discussion, or poetical imagery. My
business is with practical matter, my aim to afford our
Emigrants in esse, the best information I have been able
to collect, information that may some day be turned to
good account, and to those who mean to rest quietly
at home, and who have not the smallest notion of aban-
doning the land of their birth, and the friends of their
lifetime, I offer some interesting particulars* which may
possibly serve to break the monotony of a long ?evening.
I address myself however more particularly to the
former class, who are turning over in their minds
the policy of seeking an honest livelihood abroad, in
preference to remaining in utter poverty at home; but
I have no desire to dwell on the sad detail of parting
from every tie made long dear to us by fond association,
we can all, as Englishmen, understand this to the


full; sentiment I must altogether decline, it has little
part with the object I have in view, and I should also
premise, that it is not my wish either here, at the very
starting place, or throughout our mimic journey, to
exhibit a false, though may be pleasant, colouring to.
picture and story. There can be no reason, because
we are this moment at our ease in a comfortable locale,
with the gas burning brilliantly around, that the glow-
ing hues of unreality should be made to do the work
of plain honest truth. Let every one see, hear, and
judge for themselves?judge, whether or no they are fit
subjects for Emigration, whether it is likely to be of
advantage to them, and to those who are dependent
upon them. I have striven to obtain the most reliable
information, and I now leave it to others to declare,
whether or no my sources are authentic. Mr. Catlix
the well-known American traveller ; Mr. Wm. Kelly,
in the foremost flight of those who undertook the over-
land route to California, and whose charming little
works, ?Across the Rocky Mountains,? and ?A Stroll
through the Diggings of California,? are doubtless fresh
in the memory of my readers, have severally contribu-
ted their knowledge and experience. Two of my own
relatives, who have been resident in different parts of
Australia for many years, and who are well versed in
its pastoral and mineral wealth, have also lent their
valuable aid. The sketches both by Mr. Catlin and


Mr. Chas. Robinson, have been taken on the very spots;,
and in the Vocal department, (if my humble efforts
have the slightest claim to be called vocal,) I have been
materially assisted by my friend, Henry Russell. Let me
hope then very sincerely, that the Captain of the Ship
may succeed in bringing his little voyage to a cheer-
ful end.
I shall now suppose that all present have positively
decided upon accompanying me to far distant lands,
that the fares being paid, and the places taken, they
mean to trust implicitly on their Guide, and gird up
their loins, and shoulder their wallets, for honorable
expatriation. And although we are about to become
exiles for perhaps many a long year, if not for ever,,
there is still the one star ?hope! of exceeding bright-
ness, the property of the poor, as well as of the rich,
which will point in the distance to better days and
better deeds. Hor shall we be utter strangers in either
land of promise. Our own tongue, our own manners,,
our own religion, will all be there to lighten our
pilgrimage ;so that however bitter first alienation
from home and kindred, we shall have sympathy in our
toil, and memory will follow as the sun upon our path,
bracing our hands, and cheering our hearts.

MEMORANDA
FOR INTENDING EMIGRANTS-
There are two great classes of Emigrants. First?those families
who can afford to pay for the voyage out themselves, ?secondly ;
those who obtain free passages from The Colonial Land and Emi-
gration Funds. With regard to the former, the best vessels for
America or California direct, sail from London and Liverpool; for
the Australian Colonies, from London. The prices both to California
and Australia vary from �lOO to �lO : according to the excellence
of vessel and accommodation ; under all circumstances provisions
are included in the fare, but no liquor of any description, except
water. Children under fourteen years of age are usually taken at
half-price ; infants under twelve months are altogether free?but it
is advisable for the head of a large family, to come to some definite
arrangement with the owners of a vessel, this can be usually
arranged on more favorable terms than by paying the steerage
price at so much per head.
The Californian Eoute for a poor man is beyond question in a
sailing vessel round Cape Horn, but for the man of enterprise
and capital by Chagres and the Isthmus of Panama, where there is
a railway, partly completed, which connects the Atlantic with the
Pacific Ocean. This journey is something under 4,500 miles. The
Eoute by the States and Eocky Mountains is still difficult and la-
borious, although almost trifling when compared to what it was some
two years since. It presents objects of interest, that the tedium of
a long sea voyage could not of course afford, and as I mean to
include among my passenger Emigrants to the United States, (who
on their arrival,will have the option of proceeding to San Francisco,)
I have selected this Route for illustration.


The Colonies of Australia are much about sixteen thousand miles
??iistaat from Charing Cross. Both Steam and Sailing vessels are
-constantly starting from England. The former usually touch at
Madeira and the Cape ; the latter rarely, and a good Clipper ship
howling along in the trade winds, is fully as comfortable as any
Screw vessel. Agents for the Colonial Land and Emigration Com-
missioners are to be found at the principal ports of Great Britain.
They will afford all necessary information on the subject of free
passages, and, in fact, every particular that relates to Emigration.
For their names and addresses, see page 36.
The number of Emigrants proceeding from our twelve prin-
cipal Ports, during the first four months of the last year, (1852)
was according to the Twelfth General Report of the Commissioners,
'103,216 souls. During the first four mouths of the proceeding year,
<TBSI) the number of Emigrants to the United States, was 87,502,
and to the Australian Colonies 4343 only. The corresponding
months of 1852 give the following returns ?United States, 83,029 ;
Australia, 11,258 ; shewing a decrease in the former of 4473 ;
and an increase in the latter of 6905 souls.
Bya return made in the House of Commons, during the last session,
it appears that out of 5,964 vessels, which had sailed during the
last five years, from Ports under the superintendance of the Emi-
gration Officers, only thirty had been lost, being a fraction over one
half per cent.! The necessary qualifications for Emigrants, as laid
-down by the Commissioners, I have given in full, they may prove useful
in averting a fruitless and speculative journey to any one of the
appointed Agents, (see page 37.)
The best classes to emigrate are naturally stout able-bodied men,
no matter whether shepherds, labourers, navvies, mechanics, or what
not, so that they be strong of limb as well as of heart. If married, so
much the better, they are more likely to remain steady, and attend
to the work they have in hand. The man with a good head and
some capital, will readily gain more than a living, either by pur-
chasing the dust at the ? diggins,? and ro-selling in town ; or by
what is termed the Prospective Line, which means the hurrying like
ajackall, in advance of the diggers and miners, and from a geo-
graphical and mineral knowledge, determining upon the most pro-
mising spots, and forthwith setting to work, and seizing the lion?s
share, before the advance of the multitude. As a general rule, all
Emigrants should saddle themselves with as little baggage, and as
much money as they can possibly scrape together. The mangles,


and beds, and drawers, and chairs, and tables, and in fact everything:
not absolutely necessary for the voyage out, should be turned into-
current coin of the realm, it is far and away the best furniture a man
can land with,'and finally, the proper period to leave England, is, from
the month of May to the month of August, there is less chance at
that time of encountering bad weather.
Scene I.?The Liverpool Docks.
We have arrived at the Liverpool Docks, with our wives, our
little ones, and indeed all our worldly goods and chattels. Onr bravo
ship, ? The Duke of Wellington? is receiving the last of her cargo,
bale upon bale, boxes upon boxes, are tumbled about in wild diaorder.
The babe nestles closer to her mother, the mother to her babe, as
each appears to think they may still be parted at the last moment.
The deck of our Craft is so encumbered with human beings, that it
is a matter of difficulty to force a passage at all, and we begin to-
doubt her capacity of becoming such a veritable Noah?s Ark. But
the last article, whether man or box, is at length stowed happily-
away, and the jolly pilot steps on board, ?what has care and sorrow
to do with him ? little enough if we may judge from his fresh good-
humoured countenance ; he has braved all gales and tempests for
five and thirty years, and looks upon the howling blast as most
excellent music. And the Skipper too ! was there ever such a kind
and hopeful chief, with his bright gaze and cheerful voice ? But see!*
the anchor is weighed, the sails are set, the tow vessel has departed,
and launching forth on oar long journey, we ever and anon turn
wistfully back, as the shores of Old England fast fade from onr view*
FRESH BLOWS THE BREEZE,
Fresh blows the breeze, the sun is brightly shining-*
Care all has fled boys, hope for new success ;
Faint grows the heart, that ceases not repining.
Leave England?s sorrow, but do not love her less I
Spread full the sails, the land is fading fast,
Still though we linger o?er each vanished scene ;?
Tell not the tale of griefs that now are past.
Breathe not a wish boys, to be as we have been^


Speed, speed our ship ! the sun is brightly shining,
Care all has fled now, hope for new success ;
Paint grows the heart, that ceases not repining.
Leave England?s sorrow, but do not love her less!
Hope is our sun, our darlings yet shall meet us.
This be the end boys, toil by day and night;
Yet once again for those we love to greet us.
Friends of our youth, oh ! we?ll fight a gallant fight !
Though memory?s voice some pleasant dream?s recalling.
Farewell to home is charm?d of its despair ;
Life shall no longer prove a weary calling,
Stout hearts no more be doomed to ill and care.
Speed, speed our ship, etc., etc.
Happily for us all, the spirit of man is buoyant, and cannot dwell
for ever on the past. The many little incidents of the voyage, our
new circle of acquaintances, and the constant excitement of looking
to a land of promise, all contribute to cheer us on, so that when the
first week is past and gone, we look upon our former trials as a tale
that is told.
Scene 11. A Gale in the Atlantic.
And a thoroughly disagreeable business, to say the least of it; the
upsetting of various little domestic arrangements, is a terrible trial to
the female passengers. Pots and pans, kettles and bottles, are tum-
bled and pitched about in the wildest disorder; a portly Dame cele-
brated for her strict ideas of propriety, scuds bodily into the out-
stretched arms of a limp, unhealthy-looking Gentleman, who is
literally put out of sight in the embrace. Eatables are shot from our
plates as if from Australian Boomerangs. We administer to our
neighbour?s hunger, in the most uncivil manner, pelting his face and
garments with biscuits, potatoes, aud bacon, till he is a disgrace to
civilised society. A dense mass of infants are jerked from their
mothers? laps into mid air. The hopeless confusion of all and every
thing, is only to be equalled by the terror so unmistakeably written
on the pallid faces around. Each motion of the vessel is looked upon
as her last, aud our only astonishment is, that the reckless captain


has not been among us long before to announce our inevitable fate,
but no such thing?when our wretchedness is at the culminating
point, when the ship does her best to turn head over heels, so that
we are perfectly certain she must manage it the very next attempt,
when the wind whistles through the cordage like a dozen railway
engines, and a score of pantomime devils to boot, there stands the
jolly Skipper, hard by the helm, Pea jacket, Waterproof leggings, and
Sou? Wester complete ; not a soul regards him as a terrestrial body,
had he been one, he never could have screwed his legs to the deck in
that style. Bye and bye, and when a heavy lurch has put everyone
below on their backs for the twentieth time, he swaggers ?positively
swaggers ?till we should just like, as a matter of curiosity, to set
him on dry land, and see what sort of a walk he would make of it
there. But as everything in this world has an end, so with the lull
comes our instant reaction of spirit, and we are considerably taken
aback, by over-hearing one of the Captain?s familial? spirits, half man
half fish, telling a comrade something about the wind blowing
a little fresh the evening previous. We don?t ask a question,
but inwardly resolve, if last night's horrors came under the de-
nomination of ? a little fresh,' we should be curious to learn what a gen-
uine gale is, not practically, of course, but simply as a piece of private
information. The time on board ship, during fine weather, will be
occupied in many a pleasant way. We recount to one another the
adventures?of our life, enlarging and embellishing the most important
items with something more than fiction. The merry song and dance
also contribute to lessen the monotony of our journey. The latter
exhibitions gratify our vanity not a little, each performer executing
his own favorite step, that was wont to call down such thunders of
applause in his native village. Our cut and shuffle, toe and heel
gymnastics, excite unequivocal admiration, until even the jolly Cap-
tain, no matter what marvels he can accomplish as to steadiness of
legs, is fain to admit, like Mr. Cheggs, of Dick Swiveller, that to
have such a dancer as that on board, is indeed a matter of con-
gratulation ; and so we journey on, take us for all in all, a merry
crew, now being wildly tossed on the foaming waves ; now gliding
gracefully o?er the surface of the deep, till we at last sight the High-
lands of New Jersey, and shortly after a low spit of land, terminated
by a Light-House looms in the distance. In a few hours we arrive
at Sandy Hook, and sailing round Staten Island, we find ourselves
safe and sound in the magnificent Bay of New York,


Scene 111. New York.
_ To attempt any detailed description of New York, would, in a
little work of such slight pretension, be simply absurd. The city
itself stands on the Island of Manhattan, at the mouth of the Hudson,
and the view in approaching it by the narrows from the sea, is par-
ticularly fine. The Bay contains many small Islands with forts or
castles built upon them, and the lofty spires of the city are visible
at a considerable distance; the Bay is everywhere deep, and the
'Current rapid. New York was founded by the Dutch in 1614,
under the title of New Amsterdam. Broadway, the principal street,
begins at the Battery Gardens, and terminates in a country road ;
it is nearly four miles in length, and eighty feet in breadth. Charles
Dickens well describes the glare of colour, which is positively blind-
ing to a stranger on first setting foot in this marvellous street?
? Was there ever such a sunny street as this Broadway??the pave-
ment stones are polished with the tread of feet till they shine again,
the red bricks of the houses might be yet in the dry hot kilns, and
the roofs of those Omnibusses look as though, if water were poured
upon them, they would hiss and smoke and smell like half-quenched
fire. No stint of Omnibusses here ! half-a-dozen have gone by within
as many minutes; plenty of hackney cabs and coaches too, gigs,
phaetons, large wheeled tilburies and private carriages.? ? Heaven
save the ladies!?how they dress! we have more colours in these
ten minutes, than we should have seen elsewhere in as many days.
What various parasols, what rainbow silks and satins, what pinking
of their stockings, and pinching of their shoes, and fluttering of
ribbons, and silk tassels, and display of rich cloaks with gaudy hoods
and linings !We are going to cross here?take care of the pigs !
two portly sows are trotting up behind this carriage, and a select
party of half-a-dozen gentlemen hogs have just now turned the
?corner. Here is a solitary swine lounging homeward by himself,
he has only one ear, having parted with the other to vagrant dogs in
the course of his rambles. But he gets on very well without it, and
leads a roving, gentlemanly,vagabond kind of life, somewhat answer-
dug to that of our club-men, at home.?
Scene IV.
Winnebago Indians Spearing Salmon en Lake Erie .
Leaving the gay City as soon as may be, for fear the gentler sex
'.should be tempted to part with their little store of money, in exchange


for shawls, bonnets, or other finery, we commence our route by the
great Erie and Hudson Canal, from Albany to Buffalo. This stu-
pendous work was begun in 1817, and completed in 1825, at the
cost of above nine millions of dollars. It is 363 miles long, 40 feet
wide, and 14 feet deep; beginning at Albany on the Hudson, it
passes up the W. bank, along the Mohawk to Schenectady, from
thence it proceeds to Rome. The long level commences at Frank-
fort, and terminates near Syracuse ; the Canal then approaches
Montezuma, and on to the great embankment. The Genesee level
here begins, which extends to Lockport, and from thence to Pendleton
village, the canal enters TonneAvanta Creek, and passing up the east
shore of Niagara river, joins Lake Erie at Buffalo. There are �3
locks, and 18 aqueducts in the whole length of the canal, the former
are each 90 feet long and 15 feet wide. We have now arrived at
the Lake, which is 565 feet above the Hudson at Albany. Our scene
represents a party of Winnebago Indians spearing the Salmon, which
are very abundant; it is a beautiful sight to witness. The Indians
fix their torches to their birch bark canoes, and watch intently for
the fish, which they positively spear at a depth of tAventy and some-
times five and twenty feet. The salmon in Lake Erie attain an
enormous size, frequently Aveighing forty pounds each.
Scene V. A Race between two high pressure Steam Boats
on the Mississippi.
This enormous river, more than 3000 miles in length, rises, in a
number of head streams, in about 47 N. latitude, and flows into the
Gulf of Mexico, in latitude 296 N.; a little South of latitude 39 :
its Avaters are augmented by the Missouri?the largest river in the
world. On the high alluvial banks, grow enormous cotton wood
trees, which are constantly undermined, and tumbling with loud
crashes into the river, form ? snags,? ? sawyers,? ? planters,? and
'?chutes.? The look-out man onboard these floating Palaces or Steam
boats, has a bell, Avhich he rings when the masses of timber appear,
and the engineer shuts of the steam ?not quietly, but with a bang,
completely knocking at head all digestive processes. When the night
is dark, the 'snags? are exceedingly dangerous, and have frequently
been driven by main force through the keel of a vessel. These boats
are generally constructed Avith a water-tight forecastle, called a
? snag room,? by which precaution, the bows may be stove in, with-
out sinking the vessel. The artist has illustrated one of those dis-
graceful proceedings that are now-a-days severely punished by the
American Government, and time enough, for the loss of life a short
time since, was frightful to read about.


Scene VI. A Nigger Fete at Independence.
We have arrived at Independence, West of the Missouri, the last
town previous to our launching forth on the broad Prairie, the line
of demarcation between the white man and the red skin. Our party
are just about starting into the wide expanse, and passing the Di-
rection Post, which indicates the distance to Fort Larimie, and
Independence, they come unexpectedly upon a Nigger Fete. These
Palis and Fetes are productive of intense amusement, but the Masters
of the Ceremonies are very suspicious about admitting white guests
at all, so many cruel jokes having been practised upon ? the
coloured pantomimists, and admirable pantomimists they are,
very far removed from our dreary English Ethiopians, who-
parade the bye streets of London with horse-hair wigs and sooty
faces. Ihe ladies wear very low dresses, pulled tightly round the
waist, with an indentation rather resembling a narrow girth, than a
pair of stays. Their ear-rings are prodigious, and more allied in
shape to Schweppe?s soda water bottles than the established drop of
a few years since. The old folk of the assembly, who are too passe
to dance, hold either a pair of bones, or a tin rattle fixed in their
canes, with which they beat time. It is beyond everything ludicrous to
witness the Dinah?s, and the Lucy?s, and the Phoebes, executing the
most bewildering gyrations, while the Caesars, and the Pompeys, and
the Sambos, rallied on by the energetic old fiddler, woi'k themselves
into the cruellest stage of exhaustion.
Scene VII. The Prairie on Fire y Emigrants Firing
and Cutting away a space.
Launching forth on the broad Prairie, we are impressed with
a feeling of awe hardly to be described. The Prairie presents a
series of immense undulations, although its vast extent gives it
the distant appearance of a perfect level, and very often neither
tree or shrub is to be seen for many a weary mile. Language
is more than feeble when compared to the awful reality of a
Prairie on Fire; the heat is perfectly painful, and frequently throws
people into convulsions. These occurrences arise from natural
causes, or through the agency of the Indians, who bum away
the grass, either to secure a fresh crop the following season, or
to drive a Buffalo herd up to a certain point, where they destroy
vast numbers. They have also been accused of firing the Prairie
solely for the purpose of destroying a white encampment. The


illustration represents our party hard at work, digging trenches,
and clearing a space large enough to contain their waggons and
cattle. Two of them have been in search of the latter, who in-
variably become paralysed the very instant they smell the smoke.
THE PRAIRIE ON EIRE.
Oh! weary are our failing limbs, the wind breathes
hot and dry,
Our beasts exhausted by the drought along the prairie
lie ;
And fainter grow our hearts, as scorching e neath the
sun?s bright beams,
This makes the second day we?ve searched in vain for
welcome streams;
Courage my comrades ! help is nigh, stretching along
the plain,
A low black cloud predicts to all, a good supply of rain;
Alas ! vain hope, it nears us now, a long black line of
smoke
Rides swiftly on, and soon the murky flames the prairie
choke,
Circling in fiery wreaths, the mules stand trembling
at the sight,
Breaking their ties, and plunging madly through in wild
affright; .
And as the roaring monster still glides on with awful
sound !
We try the one chance left us, and we fire the space
around;
Down for your lives! the burning wisps fly brightly
o?er our head,
One moment more, for aught we know we?re numbered
with the dead ;
Closer and closer yet we lie, oppressed with choking
pain,


The flames speed o?er us, God be praised ! and leave a
blackened plain ;
And in the distance far we hear, the dread destroyer?s
note,
Licking up every blade of pasture down his parching
throat.
Pour forth your thanks to one above,
Who?s shewn us in this fearful hour,
How great his mercy and his love.
How frail and feeble human power,
How saddle mules and horses, boys, and let?s be quick
away,
We must find water somewhere near, before the close
of day;
On, on we press our weary limbs ?till night sets slowly
in,
At last one cries ?Tis here my lads an Indian Camp has
been;
That belt of timber yonder there, without a hill or
bluff,
Tells us of water near, and see ! a brave stream sure
enough;
So here we?ll halt, and smoke our pipes, and drink the
best success,
To future prospects, absent friends, and health, and
happiness.
Scene VIII , Emigrants fording the river Platte, in pursuit
of a herd of Buffalos.
Buffalo hunting is full of excitement, and rendered more lively
perhaps, by its being attended with some degree of danger. The
scene represents the River Platte, which must be forded by our
whole party, women, children, waggons, and all. The Platte
flows from the hills, uniting with the Missouri, at a certain point*


the Indian name is ? Nebraska,? signifying ?shallow water.?
During the thaws in the rocky mountains, this river becomes
much swollen, and is exceedingly dangerous to cross. Some of
the most enterprising of our party have plunged boldly in on
horseback, eager to have the first shot at the vast herd grazing
on the opposite bank.
Scene IX- Buffalo at Bay.
And a very unpleasant customer too, for when wounded and
hard pressed, they become mad with fury, and will boldly turn
upon man and beast. The delicacy and exquisite flavor of the
hump has been elaborately described by Cooper and others,
their skins make admirable blankets, and Buffalo chip is in-
valuable for firing purposes.
Scene X. The Sioux Indians executing a War Dance.
By far the most important tribe of Indians, are the Sioux or
Sues. They are deadly enemies with the Snakes and Pawnees,
and immeasurably their superiors in every respect. They are a
fine manly race, and although clever adepts at driving bargains,
are nevertheless straightforward and honest, and look upon the
thieving propensities of their neighbours with profound disgust.
The women are, generally speaking, handsome. Our party are
passing the encampment at the moment of the Sioux war dance,
which is the preparatory movement of a fierce battle with one
of the above-mentioned tribes. Their disputes almost invariably
arise, from the encroachment on one another?s hunting grounds.
Scene XI. A Prairie Dog Village.
The habitations of these little animals extend for many miles.
Like rabbits, they burrow in the earth, leaving the tumuli re-
presented in the picture, and are much about the same size,
with the tail and yelp of a young puppy. They utterly destroy
all vegetation, in and about their villages, so that it is frequently
necessary to turn miles out of the direct route to seek fresh pas-
ture. They are tolerable eating, but very difficult to obtain, for
they post their sentinels at regular intervals, and although at a
distance of two hundred yards, thousands of these queer little
creatures are visible, upon the nearer approach of our party, not
one individual member of the community is to be seen.


Scene XII. Attack on the Emigrant's Camp hy a party
of Crow Indians.
Still farther and farther into the wilderness, we enter the Crow
country, where good fires and vigilant watches are more than
ever necessary, especially at nightfall. The Crows lie in the long
Prairie grass for hours together, without the least perceptible
motion, and when the camp is hushed in sleep, they will en-
deavour to loose the beasts, discharging a shower of arrows
among the tents, and frequently wounding both man and beast
Mr. Kelly and Mr. Catlin take a somewhat different estimate of
the character of this tribe, but from the long experience and
knowledge of the latter, 1 am more inclined to coincide in his
-opinion.
THE ATTACK ON THE CAMP.
Not a sound, not a breath, to disturb the still night.
The blue vault of heaven is studded with light;
? Tis the hour for sweet thought, so peaceful and calm,
When we?re conscious of good, and forgetful of harm ;*
Hush! hush! what is that % not a sigh sweeps the air,
Yet mark how the frighted beasts tremble and stare ;
*Twas but Morris, our guard, with whiskey well dos?d.
Forgetful of duty, asleep on his post ;
Hark again ! no more fancy?the grass moves about,
And now a grim Savage creeps stealthily out ;
While his glittering orbs take a rapid survey.
Of our Emigrant?s Camp, where unconscious we lay ;
Stooping down, stretching close to the Prairie his ear,
He listens intent, firmly grasping his spear.
Oh ! softly to our welcome slaughter,
All is hushed in gentle sleep ;
Soon, oh! soon, each pale-faced daughter,
For her mate shall wail and weep;


A fierce bloody yell rings the Prairie about,
Returned from our Camp by an Englishman's shout ;
For when Morris, the rascal, he snored in the night,
Pat Kelly look'd round, just to see all was right,
And his nerves being sharpened by one extra glass.
He felt there was more than the dew in the grass.
Up! be stirring, danger's near,
Prepare ye for a deadly meeting;
Steady boys! the moment's here,
"We'd give these imps a proper greeting.
The battle is o'er and the Squaws now lament,
Some score of dark Crows to their last judgement sent;
While the rest mad and wounded escape to their lair,
And relate to the tribe their defeat and despair.
Gaily, gaily, morn is breaking,
The sun shines brightly from above ;
The mules are loos?d, the Camp is waking.
Ready for an instant move.
Scene XIII, The Great Salt Lake, with a distant view of
the Mormon Colony .
This Lake is confessedly one of Nature?s marvels. Five gal-
lons of the water, roughly evaporated, will yield nearly fourteen
pints of salt. Not a tree or a shrub is to be seen throughout the
entire length of its shores, which, during the dry weather, are
completely flaked with fine white particles of salt. No fish or
animal life of any kind exists in the Lake, but there are several
fertile islands, upon some of which the Latter Day Saints pasture
their oxen. We are now 12,60 miles from Independence, and
have still 900 more to traverse before we reach Sacramento City.
The celebrated Colony of Mormons was founded by the well
known Mr. Smith, who assuredly took more heed to wealth than
morals. They are a flourishing race, and exceedingly hospitable,
but their Government is oddly arranged,?the same gentleman
filling the post of Chancellor of the Exchequer, Bishop of the-


Diocese, Judge of the Circuit, or Manager of the Theatre, Their
moral code is especially lax, spiritual and earthly wives being
supplied to all members of the community without stint. We
shall now continue our journey, until we arrive at
'Scene XIV.
Encounter with Grisly Bears in ike Snowy Mountains.
The Sierra Nevada, or Snowy Mountains, are part of the
great range which extends from the Peninsula of California, to
Russian America. ? Their great volcanic peaks rise singly like
pyramids into the region of perpetual snow, to the height of
sixteen and seventeen thousand feet above the level of the sea.
Ihe two sides of the Sierra Nevada embrace two distinct climates,
the eastern side exhibiting in December, the aspect of confirmed
winter, the western, that of a beautiful spring.? During our pro-
gress over this range, we are in danger of attacks from the Grisly
-Bear, who seldom turns his back upon man, but will often be-
come the aggressor, and with his enormous claws tear the flesh of
our beasts from the hip to the fetlock joint, so although bears?
steak is far better than our English beef steak, and their skins
make admirable blankets, Emigrants will do wisely to leave their
steaks and their skins to themselves.
Scene XV. The Escape from Judge lynch .
This scene represents a memorable circumstance that occurred
near Sacramento some months since, the result was more ludi-
crous than dangerous, had it been otherwise, the illustration
w?ould never have been transferred to canvas.
Scene XVI. The Interior of a Sacramento Hotel.
The City of Sacramento stands in a hollow, several feet below
the level of the river bank. The streets were nearly all laid out
at right angles, and named alphabetically. Both houses and
population had increased enormously, until the disastrous fire
which broke out on the 7th of last November, and destroyed
nearly every habitation, as well as sacrificing many lives. The
loss was estimated at ten hundred thousand dollars, so some idea
may be formed of the enormous wealth of this Citv ; and as a
wondrous proof of energy and capital, it may be'mentioned,
that in nine days from the commencement of the fire, no less
than 350 new buildings had been erected ! Property is of


extraordinary value in Sacramento, and wages are very high.
The interior of an Hotel presents the most motley assemblage
of guests. Copper coloured, white coloured, black coloured,
mahogany coloured, yellow coloured, and dirty coloured dele-
gates, from nearly every nation under the sun, attend to eat, or
to indulge in post prandial excitement. In the several bars are
ranged bottles and kegs of all shapes and colours, with billiard
tables, chuck-a-luck tables, and all kinds of tables, chairs, rock-
ing, ricketty, and broken. The noise of the waiters, the rattling
of cups, plates, and glasses, and the constant jargon of scores of
busy tongues, chattering away in twenty different languages,
contribute to render the bar room of a Californian Hotel, a
scene of the utmost wonder and excitement.
Scene XVII . A Gambling House in full work.
However novel and noisy the bar of our Sacramento Hotel,
it sinks into comparative insignificance when brought into con-
trast with a Californian Pandemonium, Turks, Greeks, English,
Indians, French, Yankees, Irish, and Italians, muster day and
night in these detestable dens, to lose their little fortunes, ob-
tained by immense labour, if not suffering, and to quit the most
abject beggars, with no choice but go dig another. The
varieties of temper, as each individual arrives at his turn of ill
luck, (an inevitable result,) most amusingly manifests the na-
tional character. The Britisher, with his broadside of unmis-
takeable expletives. The Frenchman, who rends his hair and
his wardrobe amid a hurricane of * sacres.? The Mahomedan,
who pitches into Mahomet right and left; and the strongly pro-
filed American, who ? darns,? and ? spits,? and ? calculates??and
? calculates,? and ? spits,? and * darns,? till he discovers a hole in
his pocket too big to darn any longer. One need?nt be a ? man of
sentiment? to assert the abomination of these places, and the misery
they entail upon their unhappy victims, but the day is near at
hand, when California will be compelled to adopt our civilization
of morals, as well as of manners.
Scene XVIII. The Town and Bay of San Francisco.
The Bay of San Francisco is one of the finest in the world,
and is separated from the sea by a succession of moun-
tain ridges. Its latitudinal position is that of Lisbon,
and its climate that of Southern Italy. The fertile valley of
San Joachim, consists of a narrow plain of rich alluvial soil,


SSif g fc - th of the Bay ? which is q uite a little of
itself, opening out between seventy and eighty miles to the
right and left upon a breadth of fifteen, deep enough for the

town of such tender years, incredible. A very destructive fire
broke out on the 10th of November last, the loss being estimated
at one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. San Francisco is
distant from Independence, 2346 miles. With this view, the
First Part of our journey ends, and I shall give my Passengers
five minutes for refreshment, when I expect then/to meetme
without fail, on our outward passage to the Antipodes.
Between the First and Second Parts, there will be an interval of ten
minutes, during which, a view of Cape Town will be exhibited.


CAPE TOWN.
Cape Town, the Capital of Cape Colony, is situated on the South
East Angle of Table Bay, on a plain sloping down from the Table
Mountain. The Bay is exceedingly boisterous during the months of
June, July, and August, and the harbour at no time particularly
safe. The first view of the Town, backed by the immense precipice
of Table Mountain, is very imposing. During a greater part of the
Summer, when a South Easterly wind prevails, a white cloud, called by
Sailors ? ? The Table Cloth,? is seen resting on the mountain, presenting
all the appearance of a ponderous substance, and as long as this cloth
is spread over the top, it is difficult to enter the Bay, The Lion?s Head
Mountain exhibits the form of a Lion Couchant, its fore-paws forming
the Southern point of Camps Bay, while the tail is represented by the
flat land of Green Point. Cape Town consists of numerous Streets,
which intersecting one another at right angles, run either in a North
Westerly direction parallel to the Btrand, or South Westerly from the
Sea to Table Mountain; the houses are chiefly built of brick, faced
with lime, and the roofs are almost flat, with just sufficient inclination
to throw off the rain water. The Winters are so mild that fireplaces
are useless except in the kitchen; the rooms are for the most part lofty
and spacious, and the habitations of even the poorer classes exhibit a
neat and architectural form. The Burgher Senate House, stands in the
?centre of the Town, on one side of the Grente Plain, where the Vege-
table Market is held. The Castle, a large pentagonal fortress, commands
the Jetty, and part of Table Bay, and completely controls the road
between the Town and Country; on the North Western side of the
Castle is the Parade. Provisions in Cape Town are very cheap, but
house rent exceedingly dear. The promontory was first discovered in
1487 by Bartholomew Diaz, a Portuguese Officer, and named by him
41 Cabo Tormentoso? or ? Stormy Cape,? John the 11, King of Portugal,
gave it its present title of better omen; in 1815 at the settlement of
European affairs, the Cape was finally and formally ceded to British
dominion by the Dutch. In this view is seen a Detachment of the
Eifle Brigade escorting a party of Caffre Prisoners.

PART 11,
� THE PASTORAL AND MINERAL WEALTH
OF THE ANTIPODES.?
As we shall sight Botany Bay on onr voyage to Mel-
bourne, it may be as well briefly to state, that the Bay
was discovered by Captain Cook, in the year 1770,
and was so called by him in consequence of the
numerous botanical specimens he there discovered. Its
verv brief employment as a Penal Settlement obtained
for it a most unjust celebrity. The place was found to
be wholly unfit for such a purpose, and in a few weeks
the convicts were removed to Port Jackson. Botany
Bay, even at this present time, does not boast of more
than twenty habitations!
Scene I. The Town of Melbourne.
Melbourne, the capital of Port Philip, is situated at the head
of Port Philip Bay, at the mouth of the ? Yarra Yarra,? or ? ever
flowing ? river, in Bourke Country. The port itself is about
six miles distant, and only vessels of small tonnage can sail up
the entire course of the river. The Town is built on the right
bank, and occupies more than a square mile in extent. The
population numbers at least 20,000. Steamers ply regularly from
hence to Geelong, Sydney, and other places. There are numer-
ous churches, chapels, institutions, and schools, and four news-
papers are now established, ? The Port Philip Gazette ? and
? The Patriot,? being the oldest. The soil about Melbourne is
peculiarly rich and bears magnificent crops ?wheat, potatoes,
and all kinds of fruit and vegetables growing in abundance. The
country is well watered by numerous rivers, and the scenery
around remarkably picturesque. Many beautiful villas have
been erected on the banks of the ? Yarra Yarra,? by the Nabobs
of the place. The shops are generally good, and as in San
Francisco, tempt many a fair damsel to cast a longing, lingering
glance at the brilliant display of finery.


"Beene 11. The Port of Geelong .
Geelong is a pretty sea-port town, about fifty miles distant
from Melbourne, and is to the latter, what Margate is to London.
It is built on the Bay of Corio,which forms an arm of Port Philip
Bay. The Town is situated between the beach and the river
Barwon, a beautiful stream. Fronting it is the Basin of Corio,
where ships can ride at anchor in safety. The space between
the Bay and the River is about a mile, and the latter affords ex-
cellent water. The situation of this little town is remarkably
picturesque, and the corapletest that Port Philip presents. It is
a delightful summer day?s visit from Melbourne, and is eagerly
resorted to by all classes. To the westward lie the Barrabool
hills, the river before-mentioned, and a series of beautiful Lakes,
charmingly variegated with islands. The gold diggings of
Bunninyong and Ballarat are fifty miles to the north-west, and Wardy
Yallock the same distance to the west. The large territory known
as ? The Western Plains? containing 3,200,000 acres of first-rate
land, is also situated west of the Geelong district. The Town con-
tains about 5,500 inhabitants, and has several churches, schools, and
institutions.
Scene 111. The Annual Mustering and Branding of Cattle*
The annual branding of cattle constitutes an important feature
in Australian Bush Life. It is altogether a jovial meeting,
simple and primitive, but not a whit the less pleasant. The
evening previous to the muster, the proprietor invites all his
friends at comeatable distance, and abundantly spreads his hos-
pitable board with meat, pipes and tobacco. The merry song,,
(chaunfed hoarsely enough by the sturdy Stockman) is agreeably
diversified by many an exciting scene of bush life, and as grey
morning dawns, the beaters part off to drive the cattle, grazing*
for miles around, into a large enclosure erected for the purpose.
It is fine sport to see these stout horsemen taking creeks, fallen
trees, bushes, and tangled underwood, in a style quite worthy a
hard man in Leicestershire. The bullocks double like hares, but
a well trained horse will double quite as rapidly, and when they
are at last driven into the allotted space, many break away again,
tearing through and topping the fences with surprising spirit; and
should a young bull get a tolerable start, it takes a good horse and
a good rider to turn him .again. It is most exciting to witness


such a result. Away goes the Stockman, helter, skelter, with
his gay handkerchiefs tied around him, his hat off, and his strag-
gling hair and grizzled beard floating over his shoulders like an
exaggerated Madge Wildfire. These hardy race of men, though
rude of manner, are courageous, industrious, and hospitable*
jealous of their master?s rights and untiring in their interest.
Scene IV. Emigrants Encamping hy Night on their ivay
to the Diggings.
This view represents our party bushing it for the night. Our
fires and our pipes are all lit, our wives and our little ones have
retired to rest, and we, the Fords of the Creation, are gravely
musing over the fragrant weed, and inwardly trusting, that the battle
of life may for the time-to-come, be well and manfully fought.
No one is better versed in the art of ? roughing it? both by day
?and night, than that true friend of the poor, Mrs. Chisholm. It is
mainly by her philanthropic exertions, that so much real benefit has
resulted to our principal class of Emigrants, and her labour of charity
will long outlive this generation, all honour and praise be to her
kindly heart I
Scene VDingoes attaching a Sheep Fold hy Night.
The most deadly enemy of the Sheep Farmer, is the Dingoe or
native dog, an animal half-dog, and half-wolf in appearance, but
partaking of the latter only in character.?They usually attack
the sheep by night, but have been known in open day to run through
a flock, biting, tearing, and committing the greatest mischief and
comusion?On dark nights, it is absolutely necessary to keep the
fires constantly lighted, and watch vigilantly for these rascally
Dingoes?This is usually the post of the Shepherds? children, who
go on duty at sun-set, and have a wooden box placed close to the
fold as a protection against storm and rain. These boxes are con-
structed of ribs of wood, covered with tough sheets of bark, and are
very warm.?Shepherds arc paid from �3O to �35 a year, with
board and lodging; watchmen from �2O to �2s.?The weekly
rations allowed, are, 10-lbs. of beef or mutton ; 10-lbs. of flour or
one peck of wheat; 2-lbs. of sugar, |-lb. of tea, and as much salt
as they require- They are usually given the use of a cow, and
possess a good stock of poultry, and a well-stored garden A
Sheep farmer should not commence business with less than five or six
hundred ewes, and a half-score of rams, which will cost him on
an average about �l7O- He can either buy laud or hire it. For


a beginner the latter is the most politic course. This illustration
represents an attack on the fold by the aforementioned destructive
animal s*
Scene VI. Working at Ojphir.
Our party have now fairly arrived at the diggings, Ophir, one of
the Bathurst Diggings, is situated on the Macquerie River.
Mr. Edward Hammond Hargreaves was, to all intents and
purposes, the practical discoverer of gold in Australia, The first
successful issue of his labours took place on the 12th of February,
1851, in the Bathurst and Wellington Districts, which Districts
were originally discovered by Wentworth Lawson & Bloxland,
in the year 1813. Unlike the Turon diggings, the gold is here found
in large as well as small-sized pieces. When first the intelligence of
the Bathurst discoveries was bruited abroad, the excitement became
absolutely intoxicating, nothing was thought, heard, or spoke
of, but gold!? Tailors, Clerks, Servants, Policemen, Laborers,
Tradesmen, and Gentlemen ran the same road, at the same mad
pace. The Blacksmiths of Sydney could not turn out the picks fast
enough, and tho manufacture of cradles became a trade of itself.
The roads were alive with expectant diggers who had turned to
account every implement they could lay hands on.?Poles, spades,
pokers, basting ladles, and spits. The sheds depicted in this
illustration are now the only homes of father, mother, husband,
and wife; rough and unfinished, ?tis true, but happv enough for
all that.
Scene VII. Government House and Farm Cove, at Sidney .
Farm Cove is a small and deep basin set apart exclusively for
Her Majesty?s Ships. The New Government House, a handsome
stone building, is situated between Wooloomooloo Bay and Sydney
Cove,' and although close to the Town, enjoys all the quiet and
privacy of a country residence. Just beyond the outer pailings is
the Public Park, embracing about four miles of carriage and foot-
path.?The arrangement of the grounds was confided to the
taste and talent of Mrs. Macquarie, wife of the Governor of
that name, and was entirely executed by convict labour.?The
Botanical Gardens, containing most valuable specimens of all kinds
of vegetable productions, are situated at the head of Farm Cove.


Scene VIII? The City of Sidney.
Sydney, the Capital of New South Wales, is situated upon the
S. Coast of the Bay of Port Jackson, about seven miles from the Sea.
The City is built upon two necks of laud, with the Valley of Sydney
Cove between. Vessels of the largest tonnage can lie close to the
wharves and land their freights. In 1810, the population of this
Colony amounted to 8293, of which by far the greater number were
Convicts; in 1852 the population was 262,000, and as exclusively
English, as Manchester or Birmingham.?The Streets rise in
Terraces to the apex of the hill, the highest buildings (among
which are the Barracks and Government Offices) commanding
magnificent views. The Bay and situation of the Town is quite
as beautiful as Cork. Vessels to and from Van Deiman's Land
and New Zealand arc constantly arriving, and a considerable trade
in ship building is carried on, 219 vessels of a total tonnage of
110,95 tons, having been launched between the years 1842 and
?52. George Street, the Oxford Street of Sydney, is two miles
in length. The Shops and Stores are excellent and of considerable
dimensions. ? There is a good sprinkling of Public Houses and Gin
Palaces, and Markets, Schools, Banks, Hotels, Breweries, and
Institutions, are scattered about in profusion. The Streets almost
all run at right angles, and are built of brick and stone. The wool
trade is enormous, in 1846, wool to the amount of �1,200,000 was
exported from this Colony alone ! There are several Newspapers
established here, which teem with the most heterogeneous advertise-
ments. Auctions are for ever going on, whether for the disposal of
sheep runs, houses, pickled pork, cast off wardrobes, feather beds,
jams, bath bricks, horses, ships, pianos, lozenges, or boots. The whole
of the articles are muddled together, and disposed of at the same
time- Sydney is, beyond all question, the best destination for the
Emigrant- The communication with Victoria, Southern and West-
ern Australia, and Van Dieman?s Land, is abundant by means of
steam and sailing vessels.?The best information can here be obtained
from squatters, settlers, and the daily and weekly papers, and
whether for the investment of capital, or the discovering the
proper fields for industry, Sydney is the leading point for rich
and poor.


Scene IX. Hunting the Kangaroo.
Hunting the Kangaroo, is the favourite sport of Australia.
The dogs employed are a sort of half breed between a deer and
a greyhound. ? Red flyers,? or ? Old Soldiers,? (the sporting
term for the larger kind of Kangaroos) are exceedingly fleet, and
at full speed can spring the most marvellous distances, the fore
feet never touching the ground- Down hill, both dogs and horse-
men are frequently left far, far, in the rear of their two-legged
game, and are so completely exhausted as to be compelled to re-
linquish the chase. The average height of a ? Red Flyer ? is about
five feet, but the ? Boomahs ? or Kangeroos of the largest
magnitude, stand at least seven feet- Their flesh is excellent, much
resembling venison, and the bushman can dress a Kangaroo haunch
or steak to perfection. The fallen trees, stump holes, and sun
cracks, render the sport sufficiently dangerous to prove exciting.
Scene X. The lieturn of the Kray with the produce of the
Colonist's first Market.
The bread gained by honest industry is doubly sweet. This is a
cheerful pleasant scene, and one that I trust all my fellow-travellers,
who are bent upon making something more than a mimic journey,
will themselves experience. The return of the Dray is the signal
lor a family rejoicing. The colonist having disposed of his produce
is returning home, laden with the little luxuries that cannot be ob-
tained in the bush ;?dresses and caps for his � missus,? jackets
and corduroys for the little chaps, and a tin of tobacco for the elder
ones. More than that, he brings home a double-barrelled gun,
telling his worthy spouse, (who is working herself up to a state of
madness with a very broad Vermillion ribbon,) that ? he?s blow?d if
he don?t mean to have a slap at them ?ere birds, and that?s all about
? a a , j�y� us moment when the Dray first appears in sight,
and the well-known oxen, each called by some endearing appellation,
are seen toiling up the hill, dragging along their valuable cargo.


? WELCOME HOME!"
Loud welcome! run, run, boys! our good Dray?s return?d
Well stored with the riches stout labour has earned;
There is ? Short Horn/ and ? Speckle/ and ? Crumple,?'

Forward young idlers ! bear a hand here, ?now steady p
I have caps for my Jane, and fine jackets for Neddy,
With a dress for the Missus, that wont wash and run.
And the brightest of colours, Sal, under the sun !
There are prints and good linen, for all you girls wear.
And broadcloth, strong texture, that wont ruff or tear ;
Of ribands and bonnets, I?ve plenty to choose,
Here are grown-up lad's boots, and my little chap?s
shoes ;
A stout barrel?d gun, polished kettles and tins,
A box filled with cotton, and needles, and pins
Good knives, and good scissors, a hymn book, a shawl.
For the youngsters, some marbles, and trap, bat and

Our hearts grateful praise, that we?ve once again met ;
And as honour brings comfort, dishonesty pain,
We?ve a labour of love as well as of gain;

And Sam, Dick, and Father, a right merry lot;
Full gladly we welcome, our good Dray?s return?d.
Well stored with the riches stout labour has earned..


Scene XL Issuing the Licenses.
This is a busy scene, and one that every Gold Digger must of necessity
take part in. The cost of a License is Thirty Shillings, and the form thereof,
is ,annexed :
GOLD LICENSE,
No. April, 1853
The bearer, having paid to me
the sum of one pound ten shillings on account of the Territorial
Revenue, I hereby license him to dig , search for , and remove
Gold , on and from any such Crown Land within the County
of Bathurst , as I shall assign to him for that purpose, during
the month of April, 1853.
This License must be produced whenever demanded ly me
or any other person , acting under the authority of the Govcr-
ment.
Signed, Commissioner.
There was a great attempt made to reduce the price of a
License from 30s- to 7s 6d., but Mr- Hardy, the Commissioner,
very properly refused to recommend the adoption of any such mea-
sure. The enormous mass of pure gold, weighing upwards of one
hundredweight, discovered on the sheep run of Doctor Kerr,
of Wallawa, was positively taken from him in the first
instance, by reason of his having worked without a License, but it
was eventually restored by an equitable arrangement, viz : that he
should pay to Government, 10 per cent- Thus no respect is paid
to persons, hut every digger, high or low?rich or poor, must pro-
cure his License before handling a pick, or working a cradle.
Scene XII. The Turon Diggings.
The Turon is a tributary of the river Macquarie, running about
thirty miles north of Bathurst, through a valley some miles in width.
The adjacent hills are of mica slate, with no quartz veins, as at
Somraerhill Creek- The Turon gold is mostly found in small
pieces, and the yield is abundant, beyond all conception, both the
entire bed of the creek and the banks being immensely productive.
In this district, wet feet are inevitable ; the earth is taken in buckets
or bags, a quantity is placed in the sieve, and the digger rocks the
cradle with his left hand, dipping the water with his right, and


pouring it into the sieve, till the earth is clear. Any piece of gold
too large to go through the holes, is called a ? nugget.? When
about fifty sieves full have been washed, the machine is cleared out,
and the deposit is placed in the washing pan, where the gold being
the heavier matter, eventually settles*
PULL AWAY CHEERILY.
Pull away cheerily,
Not slow or wearily,
Rocking your cradles boys, fast to and fro;
Working the hand about,
Sifting the sand about,
Seeking for treasures that lie hid below.
Here?s a brave 66 nugget,?
Like children we hug it;
Courage my lads, fortune favors the bold!
What are our thoughts about,
Knocking this quartz about?
Thoughts?that we?ll soon send our parents
some gold.
Chorus ?So pull away cheerily, &c.
Dick, a four year old Digger,
Works a cradle much bigger
Than his own> little self; while Sally, she must,
Add her mite to the store,
By collecting the ore.
And filling her apron with glittering dust.


Here?s a mere Maimakin !
Bringing a pannakin,
He scarcely can grasp in his small tiny hand ;
While tilting his dish up,
We merrily fish up,
Another supply of the bright yellow sand.
And thus we are cheerily,
Not slow or wearily,
Rocking our cradles boys, fast to and fro,
Working the hand about,
Sifting the sand about.
Seeking for treasures that lie hid below.
Chorus Pull away cheerily, &c
Scene XIII. Crushing the Quartz .
This scene represents the crushing of quartz by manucl labour, the
strength required is considerable, and none but the able-bodied should
venture upon this department of gold digging.
Scene XIV. Time for Vinner.
As we cannot live literally upon gold, it will be necessary in the
course of our daily labour to examine the contents of our pots, which
are bubbling and steaming forth a most fragrant soupeon of excellence.
I of course assume we have one and all made a capital day's work
of it. and although we cannot dignify our primitive life and habits
as the ? otium cum dignitatc,? still we are hungry and happy, with
plenty to eat, and very much to be thankful for.


Scene XV.
Home again.?The arrival at the Easton Square Terminus.
It was altogether out of the question my leaving my friends in
such a distant land, and as the Emigrant vessel which I have the
honor to command, starts on a similar voyage every evening, at *he
same hour, and at the same fares, I have thought it advisable to
bring them back bodily with me to London, sincerely trusting, that
should any of them make the little journey we have just taken, a
reality, they will make their well-doing at the Bush or at the
Diggings a reality likewise.

Qualifications of Emigrants.? l. The emigrants must he of those
callings which from time to time are most in demand in the colony. They
must be sober, industrious, and of general good moral character, of all of
which decisive certificates will be required. They must also be in good
health, free from all bodily or mental defects, and the adults must in all
respects be capable of labour and going out to work for wages. The candi-
dates most acceptable are young married couples without children.
2. The separation of husbands and wives, and of parents from children
under 18, will in no case be allowed.
3. Single women cannot be taken without their parents, unless they go
under the immediate care of some near relative. Single women with ille-
gitimate children can in no case be taken.
4. Single men cannot be taken except in a number not exceeding that
of the single women by the same ship.
5. Widowers, and widows with young children, persons who intend to
buy land, or to invest capital in trade, or who are in the habitual rece'ipt of
parish relief, or who have not been vaccinated or had the small-pox, or
whose families comprise more than four children under 12, cannot be
accepted.
Application and Approval. ?C. Applications must be made to the Com-
missioners in a Form to be obtained at their office, to be duly filled up and
attested, as explained in the Form itself. The filling up ?of the Form,
however, confers no claim to a passage, and implies no pledge that the can-
didates, though apparently within the regulations, will be accepted.
7. If approved of, the applicants will receive a printed ?Approval
Circular,? calling for the contribution required by Article 8, and pointing
out how it is to be paid. After it is paid they will as soon as practicable,
receive an embarkation order, (which is not transferable,) naming the ship
in which they are to embark, and the time and place of joining her. They
must not leave their homes before the receipt of this order.

Passages to the port of embarkation from Dublin, Cork, Granton Pier,
and Hull, are provided by the Commissioners for Emigrants proceeding
through those ports; all other travelling expenses must be borne by the
emigrants themselves.
Cautions to Applicants. ?9. No preparations must on any account be
made by the applicants, either by withdrawing from employment or other-
wise, until they receive the ?Approval Circular.? Applicants who fail to
attend to this warning will do so at their own risk, and will have no claim
whatever on the Commissioners.
10. The selecting agents of the Board have no authority to promise
passages in any case, nor to receive money. If, therefore, applicants wish
to make their payments through the agents, instead of in the manner pointed
out in the ?Approval Circular,? they must understand that they do so at
their own risk, and that the Commissioners will be in no way responsible.
11. Should any signatures attached to an applicant's paper prove to be
not genuine, or should any false representations be made in the papers,
not only will the application be rejected, but the offenders will be liable,
under the Passengers' Act, 12 and 13 Yict. cap. 38, to a penalty not
exceeding �5O.
12. Should any applicants be found on personal examination at the depot,
or on board, to have made any mis-statement in theii papers, or to have
any infectious disorder, or otherwise not to be in fit state of health to
embark, or to have any mental or bodily defect likely to inpair their
usefulness as labourers, or to have left any of their young children behind,
or to have brought w r ith them more children than are mentioned in their


Application Form, or expressly sanctioned by the Commissioners, or to have
attempted any deception whatever, or evasion of these rules, they will be
refused admission on board the ship; or, if embarked, will be landed with-
out having any claim on the Commissioners.
13, If applicants fail to attend at the appointed time and place for embark-
ation, without having previously given to the Commissioners timely notice
and a satisfactory reason, or if they fail to proceed in the ship, or are rejec-
ted for any of the reasons specified in the proceeding article, they will forfeit
their contributions, and will have no claim to a passage at any future time.
Outfit, &c.?l 4. The Commissioners supply provisions, medical attend-
ance, and cooking utensils at their depot and on board the ship. Also new
mattresses, bolsters, blankets, and counterpanes, canvas bags to contain
linen, &c,, knives and forks, spoons, metal plates, and drinking mugs, which
articles will be given after arrival in the colony to the emigrants who have
behaved well on the voyage.
-15. The emigrants must bring their own clothing, which will be inspec-
ted at the port by an officer of the Commissioners, and they will not be
allowed to embark unless they have a sufficient stock for the voyage, not
less for each person than?
For Males.
For Females.
Six Shifts

Six pairs stockings
Two ditto shoes
Two flannel petticoats
Six pairs stockings
Two ditto shoes
Two complete suits of
exterior clothing
Two gowns.
With sheets, towels, and soap. But the larger the stock of clothing the
better for health and comfort during the voyage, which usually lasts alxmt
four months, and as the emigrants have always to pass through very hot
and very cold weather, they should be prepared for both; two or three serge
shirts for men, and flannel for women arid children, are strongly recommen-
ded.
16. The emigrants should take out with them the necessary tools of their
trades that are not bulky. But the whole quantity of baggage for each
adult must not measure more than 20 cubic or solid feet, nor exceed half
a ton in weight. It must be closely packed in one or more boxes, but no
box must exceed in size 10 cubic feet. Large packages and extra baggage,
if it can be taken at all, must be paid for. Mattresses and feather beds will
in no case be taken.
17. On arrival in the colony the emigrants will be at perfect liberty to
engage themselves to any one willing to employ them and to make their
own bargain for wages; but if they quit the colony within four years after
landing, they must repay to the Colonial Government a proportionate part
of their passage-money, at the rate of �3 per adult for each year wanting to
complete four years residence.
18. All applications should be addressed, post-paid to S. Walcott, Esq.,
No. 8, Park-street, Westminster.?Colonization Circular, 1852.
